Have fun

---
The Pale Tree is actually a carnivore.
---
the daily category is already way too bloated with lots of trash that - outside of few exceptions - is neither motivating nor gives players a direction.
---

---
that bloat needs to go. however an entirely separate "daily tasks" panel, that even includes stuff like ascended crafting might do the job. then again i also feel like it's not much to ask off players to keep track of most of that.
---
overall, considering how easy and plentiful alternatives are, i'd give this a very low priority rating.
---
ive always wondered from the standpoint of a developer why making outfits capable of being able to be mixed with other pieces such a thing that hasnt been implemented yet...
---
I see your Schwartz is as big as mine.
---
I mean we already see that
---
Hats must come back!
---
When I first started doing harder stuff in the game I would test myself by finding champs to solo in the world that were actually difficult (this was pre-HoTs). Recently I challenged myself to do all of the story mode dungeons solo which is a great test of how well you know your class and the game, and any exploits in between). 
---
The dungeons are designed for 5 but power creep over the years have made that less necessary.  
---
that is EXCELLENT work, wow. 
---
Heterosexuality is deleted from the game and grenth is the only male god, plus he is hated by everyone because he is litelarry god of death.
---
Oh wait we already have that
---
I would have made C&amp;C if I could get rid of the tiger arrows.
---
Now let's see how well you handle it.
---
Shit, is that true? That might be a bug. I though SW was going to be unaffected.
---
That's right, but that' an other topic.
---
That's cool. Your community can fuck itself. There are much better MMOs anyway. 
---
Well, he's not wrong
---
what prices are driven sky high?
---
There is always a good 8 hours before reset to get in dailies before the official first day starts.
---
That was right, when HoT and PoF were announced, but now it doesn't matter, because you can't *pre*-order these Expansions anymore. 
---
Without another Epansion announced, I think it would only confuse people, if you talk about getting char slots from standard editions. 
---
Try submitting another ticket? 
---
I had the same problem and sent in a ticket. The billing team fixed it within the same day.
---
I’ve complained many times on map chat about it ... makes class mobility and taking any objective highly punishable especially if solo or with a super small 1-5 player group. Makes the game faster paced but less interesting. The map is in essence smaller 
---
**Obsidian Edge**
---
The rarest sword in all of GW1. https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/b/be/Obsidian_Edge.jpg
---
Sleek design with shiny obsidian. Black trails but more clean and sharp than Eternity.
---
Whereas Eternity is more bulky, Obsidian Edge could focus on being more thin and practical. Much like how the Ebonblade looks with its sleeker design relative to other greatswords.
---
When you slash the sword, slashing sfx could be hanged to something that sounds very... sharp. 
---
Now look what Article 13 makes us do!
---
Nah it’s for Zerg warfare not roaming! In fact unless you are in a squad of at least 10 you shouldn’t even be able to join WvW! And when you die in a Zerg fight and run back, you should be invulnerable until 2000 range of commander.

'They sound like auctioneers!' 
---
'YOU try moving 40 players around in real time.'
---
I think it's what herding cats would sound like.
---
Because this is a proxy and not the proper way to implement D3D 12 support. Implementing support involves a significant amount of work, including maintaining a D3D 9 implementation for your without Win 10 or a D3D 12 capable card.
---
No sane company would implement a proxy like this. It is an unmaintainable solution.
---
Sadly, I agree. That's part of the reason I posted this. To communicate that I appreciate this behavior, hoping they keep at it. Our at least they try to.
---
Let's hope we're wrong, though.
---
Meanwhile I name every one of mine caromi tengu brave in hopes of tengu playable race....a man can dream
---
Of course you can.
---
You can even play 5min a week, but what's the point? MMORPG genre requires a lot of time to fully enjoy it. 
---
I personally would play something else. But I'm not you. 
---
Need less light.
---
Start with infantile mode to learn the lay out of the zones. Then try tribulation mode which will take a while. 
---
I got my first Ascended chest, it comes with Rampager's stats. Is there any effective class/build that would use this class piece well, or should I just salvage it?
---
You should let him at least try SAB as it was intended to be. Software like that is for players who lack the skill to do it properly and have no pride in accomplishments.

We need this in the US!
---
And will finish your pain aswell
---
I was chatting with my Guildies last weekend during Guild Missions about this very same topic actually and got some interesting takes from a few different people. I'll share a few ideas that were tossed around.
---
• Elemental Greatsword. You right click it and can select what form it takes out of Fire, Water, Air or Earth.
---
• Aurene Branded Greatsword. Think Caithe's new dagger but more flashy with legendary effects.
---
• Finis. This was brought up cause someone wanted a Greatsword that matched the whole Legendary Armor + Ad Infinitum set. It opens up when drawn and closes itself when put away. Ad Infinitum in Latin means endless more or less and Finis is Latin for 'The End', which is what you'll be doing to enemies.
---
I figured that was the case, but I've seen people reducing the argument like this so much I started to wonder if they thought the unid greens were an ecto source on their own somehow.   
---
I'm torn on the change, since I've always argued they've ruined the economy and watered down the rewards simultaneously somehow while providing more rares than ever before.
---
But YOU arent the ones anet makes fractals for. There arent gonna be any more CM fractals.
---
And seriously, what exactly do you think "scaling" means? Artificial difficulty, LMAO. Maybe next time think before clicking that "save" button.
---
Also, be glad there was still SOME fractal developement. Chances are high that there is now zero. The dev team responsible for raids/fractals got pretty much disbanded. Some got laid off, others re-assigned.
---
Wanna bet that "garbage" was the last new fractal for a veeeeeery long time?
---
Too soon.
---
And yet we can’t have human female idle animations. 
---
You dont' need DH at all if you have FB Heal mantra. The reason you want(ed) distort/aegis for gorse for push knock backs is because it actually does create dps loss if you're knocked down or during your dodge animation. 
---
The issue is still the community at large not exploring and not being able to adapt. During raid nights for me for example I rotate to at least 5 different classes as both my role and our comps require it. One trick pony-ing is fine to get into when you start but ultimately you want to diversify or be so damn good at your job that you do feel irreplaceable.
---
So should you send your unidentified gear to the bag alt or open it on your 80?
---
Another thing to note as a Thief main is that roaming open world with Deadeye feels like absolute shit, you don't do any AOE damage so trying to farm or cleave through mobs is a huge pain in the butt - on the other hand Daredevil is one of the best at massive AOE damage, so it's good to have both on hand. For bosses/raids/world bosses/etc where there's a requirement for tons of single target DPS, Deadeye feels awesome for the relatively easy rotation and enormous crit numbers.
---
Do the normal mode first. Get all weapons and secret stuff they will make your runs so much easier. Dulfy have a guide on how to get them all if you get stuck.
---
If you go for tribulation mode, imo do it without markers first. Imo the markers is just dumbing the game down and you loose the first time feeling and that can never be re-done. After you done it all one time at least by your self then sure if you like to have markers go for it. It is not a bad thing then.
---
Start by soloing random champions in open world. The low level ones will probably be pretty boring but teach you not to facetank everything.
---
Try the champion hero points in heart of thorns. They are definitely soloable, especially with proper classes. The downside here is that a random player could pass by, stop, and help you.
---
Pof champion bounties are soloable but much easier with specific classes as they are on a timer. You can dodge every attack and heal all the dmg, if you don't kill them in time you will fail.
---
Some (not all) dungeons are soloable but be prepared to learn how to. Without stealth or skips some can become quite difficult.
---
Fractals are similar to dungeons in a sense that not all are soloable and its much easier if you know the skips. Low level fractals are soloable without much effort but you really have to know what you are doing if you want to solo t4 fractals.
---
Unfortunately, raids are not soloable as you would just die to enrage. To my knowledge the only raid boss that is soloable is cairn as the enrage is quite tame (you're just slow af in your movement). However, this takes a LONG time so be prepared to sit there for hours as one slip up can lead to a reset.
---
We already have one canon thing along this vein. Kasmeer is naked and conjures illusory clothing. Baffling really.nyoud think if she could do that then she could actually wear something warm but still make it look like something else anyway.
---
while i agree, wasnt eblade and crystalline more rare?
---
It's taking up space from the scenery and draws attention to itself.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who uses their GW2 characters as D&amp;D characters.  Haha.  Wish I could play a Sylvari in D&amp;D. 
---
That's the thing, these small drops from the legendary bounties though, who actually cares for them they're literally just copies of other easily obtainable skins aren't they?  
---
Ascended drops isn't really the problem IMO, I think it's simply the lack of any incentive to even do bounties. The rewards from doing a bounty train and world boss train are minimal, the only reason I would ever do a world boss train is because I am "that bored", and the last time I did one was before PoF launched.   
---
Let's say you do 1 AB, you get more loot than like 5 world bosses combined along with 5 chances at a rare \~3k drop. All of which within like 10 minutes.   
---
Silverwastes, sure it gets boring eventually but the concept is really nice, you get lots of loot, lots of things to kill, boss fight at the end, and shovels as well for down time as well as the boss having 3 distinct lanes, groups and even giving a possible \~3k drop at the end. Also get map currency to buy carapace skins.  
---
Then I run around in PoF, do a meta and get one bag and pittance. 
---
That first group of people is pretty much just always lying. When the posts get traction a GM typically outs the person pretty quickly.
---
Things that get you banned, such as botting or cheating tools actually effect the data being passed to the server. They alter data, or replicate data in a specific pattern. Reshade not only doesn’t do this, it’s completely impossible for it to (having looked at the code).
---
The mistake a while back was egg on anets face, but they did reverse it afterwards. 
---
Anyway, to each their own. 
---
LS2 achievements. They were so frustrating to get right, but gave me so much sense of pride and accomplishment after I finished them all.
---
At his rate I expect it to literally just be a giant dead fish. 
---
&gt; I know that toughness tanking doesnt exist in Fotm like in raids
---
?? It existed forever in basically all of the game (almost). This is why classes with toughness traits seem to get a lot more dmg in fractals in fights with random adds. 
---
In raids the difference is that toughness is the *only* rule they follow unless fixation mechanic (distance, picking a target etc.) while rest of the game toughness is one of the reasons but not only.
---
Many guilds are very casual oriented. Don't be shy to ask around, our community have all kinds of guild types that focus on different activities in the game and since you can have up to 5 at a time, make sure to explore your possibilities :) 
---
People complained that having a human female stretch their arms during a cutscene like this broke immersion; ArenaNet removed three key animations from all human female models and tried to cover it up.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People praised the fact that they could jinx dramatic situations like this for years; ArenaNet did nothing.
---
I seriously don't get it...
---
There are lots of map metas that one cannot solo, and world bosses, among the things listed here as more 'explicit' group content. (dungeons, fractals and raids) Have a look in the lfg window ( Y, then lfg/spyglass icon) and I'm sure there will be something going on in any given map as long as it's not 2 am, though sometimes people run Dragon Stand at 2 am!
---
Maybe you need a guild or community to stick to. 
---
Also check out this link: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame
---
Yes, the thing is, if it's really really fun, people will do it anyway, unfortunately, rewards are just not non-existent for much of the game. I do honestly prefer other MMO's in terms of rewards as it feels so much more satisfying. Like getting boss specific drops, if they made boss specific tokens in the wallet for instance, that'd be cool but that seems like a lot of work and a lot of unique tokens to make. They could then buy boss specific backpieces or weapons and even armor or something after they finish boss achievements but that doesn't make money I guess so eh.
---
He means that "Rouge" and "Rogue" mean different things.
---
Anyone know how much damage epi bouncing does? Just curious since the epi duration nerf happened, it stopped being used everywhere to being used nowhere (apart from SH)
---
Really? Wow.
---
That was the worst part of the run when I did it
---
i'd love something norn themed, that actually looks like a realistic greatsword (proper shape, like a claymore) and doesn't look like something from an anime with a square tip or some crap like that.
---
Where do I go? Main website somewhere? Can I do this from forums? How do I know if I’ve alresdy done it?
---
According to [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=skins&amp;filter.rarity=7), it's the least made legendary with 674 unlocks. It's not in last by a small margin, either. It's more than 10% behind HMS Divinity (765). If the number doubles, it'd still be behind the most recently released legendary Pharus.
---
Considering that Juggernaut (11.5k) and Kudzu (10.4k) are approximately equal, it's noteworthy that Pharus lags so far behind.
---
Yeah, it’s been awhile since I’ve done but because of the way portal works the mes can just drop one at the start, blink their way through the maze, drop one at the end and bam, orb run is done. 
---
Sweet! Thanks for the info!

Hello. I'm an old returning player and since the game **is** now f2p, what's in it for people that bought the game in the past? Can't seem to find this info anywhere online.

If someone is having you run celestial scourge, they are very wrong. you gain a whopping 500 barrier on f3 and 1k barrier on your heal. stat for stat, power beats the shit out of condi on a scourge since the dhuumfire nerf last year.

So far the rest of the comments have been about Tribulation Mode and to learn advanced tactics which is not the best thing as nobody is gonna go "YEP, TRIB" and take the angry cloud. Hell, you have to  EVEN SELECT TRIB.
---
I can't agree with this. Continue coins are really cheap if you buy them beforehand (Moto racks up the prices in the game over room). If you've gone through normal mode first you should be able to afford more than enough continue coins to blunder your way through W1Z1 tribulation, and successful tribulation mode runs give you a massive amount of baubles so you should always be running a profit from then on no matter how hard you find it.  
---
Also, once you're done continue coins can be converted back into baubles at no loss so there's no need to be conservative. Convert all your baubles into coins!
---

Enough for daily and a couple of world boss. Also crafting and manage to flip some TP. Or a step in Stroy

How y’all MFers look when doing a repetitive chore weekly for a cash shop key.

- The Devil Wears Auras
---
You are correct  - just focused on fracs, since that was the question there.
---
P.S. not sure if any mobs decide depending on Vitality... does not really matter at the end anyway tho
---
The infinite coin prevent me to deal with everything you said, putting my mind at peace once and for all. No micromanagement or fear of ever running out.
---
Every continue coin I collect can safely be converted.
---
I've owned the coin since the first SAB and I never regretted it.
---
I don’t PvE too much, are you referring to them removing participation outside of the metas or was there more?  If so I prefer not to have to show up at a specific time and spend hours in a zone to get some rewards (I only go for legendary mats).  
---
I do think there should be additional benefit for participation, like a guaranteed exotic or better, and achievements.  However I think it’s better overall to not make it all about timing and participation.  
---
No it doesn't. Unless I am missing something, you have to manually mark the ones you do daily.
---
Complaining. How bad of a game it is for someone who wants to plays more than 1hr a day, everyday.

they are designed for solo players -&gt; solo content, even if you can run them with more people.
---
dungeons, raids, fractal are designed for groups -&gt; group content, even if some of them are soloable
---
join a guild, do dungeon/fractals/raids.

thats the most social thing you can do in gw2. the rest is an mmo simulator (fun gameplay though)

Hmmm for that one I didn’t actually complete my challenge. Got to the final boss then had to get help after failing a whole bunch from like 2 other people. 
---
I was running a scourge minion god build from necro version back around September that I don’t think works the same way anymore
---
Yes it is. Without a doubt i'd say GW2 offers the best experience for those with limited time of any other MMO.  
---
Also, if you own the game (as in not f2p) you get Daily login rewards and you can complete Daily achievements.  
---
The daily achievements take 15 minutes and will give you 2 gold a day on top of the \~50 gold a month you get for just logging in daily.  
---
Good luck have fun.

If you want an easy way to update your .dat files when a new patch hits.  You can use [GW2Launcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher/master/Gw2Launcher/bin64/Release/Gw2Launcher.exe).
---
1. Once downloaded create a shortcut to it some where. 
---
2. Next go to `%appdata%\GW2 Launchbuddy` and hold shift and right click on the Loginfiles folder and click on Copy as path.
---
3. Next go to the location to where the shortcut was created.  Right click and go to properties and in the target location put in `-update &lt;paste location here with Ctrl + V&gt;` (without &lt; &gt; brackets, but keep quotations) and at the end before the " put in `\*.dat`  so it would end like `Loginfiles\*.dat"`
---
4. Once you load the shortcut, it automatically updates all the .dat files 1 by 1.  No BS messing with creating new login files when each new patch drops.  Think of it as the unofficial launchbuddy mass account updater.
---
enabling javascript worked for me
---
For the link the person who answered 1st was mentioning:
---
[Stat changing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) on the wiki
---
I really wish items would not auto deposit into invisible bags, and instead your inventory would treat itself as full, unless you  manually dragged items in.
---
Yeah, because spam filters are too hard to set up.
---
If we assume its not some scam...and while it could be it seems a bit not quite scammy enough to definitely say its a scam. It could just as easily be that someone random got an email about the purchase. Said email had sisters email somewhere but it got sent to other persons email. Often purchases come with this purchase was made with xxxip at the bottom and random person sees it and says wtf not my ip why am i getting this email. So he emails your sister but doesnt explain very well. Maybe your sister entered her email wrong somewhere? Maybe it was just a technical glitch.
---
Oh thank you sir for the inconvenience. Thank you. 
---
The biggest problem with GW2 is lack of developer focus and vision. It is more like "lets please the fanboying". Anet miss the main question all the time: **"What does it bring to gameplay table?"**
---
What does mount bring to WvW?
---
- Ability to move faster? Well gliding is kind of the same, works both ways, irrelevant. It just cosmetic permaish swiftness.
---
- Siege skills? Do not hit the point. Useless.
---
- Engage skill? Kind of useless in big fights.
---
- Sniff? Well it just made life of inexperienced commanders easier, making life of everyone else harder. **But this the only real gameplay change.**
---
Same comes to any living world map. Just same fanboy food over and over and over again. The last real new gameplay to the date is Oasis Casino race. All metas after is either bland fanboy food (Augry Rock, Thunderhead Keep, Gandara the Moon Fortress) or just really bad from gameplay standpoint (Serpents Ire, Istan, Desolation one...)
---
Frac 99 is soloable, VG is soloable, Cairn is soloable...
---
[removed]
---
You kind of right. But it making mount even more bland. It just useless for WvW aside perma-swiftness and noob commander saving sniff.
---
depending on the ratio of charr in the group, that is literally that
---
That would definetly make me craft it even though I have Eternity and scythe staff skins
---
Bro go stroke off your ego somewhere else and let us enjoy a free skin. Haha, acting like we were just screwed out of a million bucks.
---
There's at least one person that removed them, eh.
---
I personally think the date at which they start sending these out is rather specific and interesting:
---
1. Unless I'm wrong I haven't seen the purple skin in our clients yet
---
2. *"Allow 8 weeks after April 29, 2019 for this item to be distributed."* means they plan to start sending these out on the 30th
---
3. April 30th is a Tuesday, aka patch day so they'll probably add it to our clients on that day
---
4. They're currently doing a highlight of each season 4 episode the coming weeks, if they're doing one a week it would all lead up to April 30th.
---
In short: something something April 30th.
---
Liked :D.
---
You're a monkey, and in game wvw currently isn't much more active than before the update....and it has been one month.
---
Yeah, I can handle receiving a month of newsletters and then turning it back off.
---
Ah, remember a few years back, when you could join instance before the end, so people would sell their runs. I made so much money.
---
But can it use asura as ammo ?
---
am i only worried u dye ur cat , blue ?
---
No. Both had the same issue.
---
Instabilities were sold as "permanent annoyance, but ways to get advantage of it".
---
Stability duration bonus ? That doesn't event counter said effect ? Let me laugh hard. This one was purely negative, nothing to keep about it.
---
If you were able to stay on tag, gankers were never an issue.
---
Gw2 is full of players with the attention span of a goldfish who expect to get carried through wvw the same way they get carried through open world.
---
Is there any way to change your account's email address? I still use an old one I can't access anymore, so I can't confirm my subscription to the newsletter
---
It's called convergent evolution. Businesses that are completely unrelated all over the world do what works. I mean the guys who founded Anet came from Blizzard in the first place. So yeah, they're going to do a lot of the same stuff, being in the same industry and having the same general needs. Nothing to see here.

Imagine for the first 10 sec you get something easy, like toxic trail and boon overload.
---
And then you get that -30% hp insta and outflanked, and right then you get hit by a mob from behind and get rekt.
---
That would be too much random even for my taste.
---
For the layoffs: Act/Blizz is such a huge company that such events can actually trigger a domino effect. shareholders get scared. its not unusuall to have stocks in both companies. Game industry is going thorugh rufd times atm (at least in the shareholders eye), so could be coinicence as well. you would need a market expert/insider to answer this correctly.
---
For the returning players event: could also be a coinsidence, but i think there are enough smart marketing people that may have noticed that march is a good month to extend marketing stategies. if i remember correctly, we had a similiar thing march last year. but here again we would need an expert with their data sheets. March is also at the End of the first quarter, which is important for shareholders/companies aswell. but im just fully speculating here.
---
There's very little dungeon-type content in GW2 that requires more than an hour investment. Even raids can be done in little chunks of boss by boss, or just a wing at a time.
---
So yeah, he should be more than fine :)
---
RemindMe! 8 Weeks "Unsubscribe"
---
yes i do
---
As far as I remember only the Bauble Bubbles and Continue Coin from the end chest are once per day and you'll always get the Z- tokens.
---
I have the same issue as you, first attempt to log-in fail, than seccond works without any messages in "news" section at launcher, than log-out right after load to the map.
---
This change is proper confusing. First I thought they made it so you can not get a higher item tier anymore at all through identification (blue -&gt; blue, green -&gt; green, yellow -&gt; yellow).
---
But apparently it is still possible to get exotics from identifying?
---
So now it is a flat base chance instead of MF?

Looking at the fact that multiple people are having issues im guessing its someone at anet messing around with stuff to prepare for SAB

I think the end of first calendar quorter is when companies close their financials after last year and make plans for next one. 
---
What if i dont have that email :c

I was being sarcastic. He brands buildings and mountains and rivers and everything else living or not. Even if Blish is still alive, he would not be in a good state.

Dragons eat magic. His personality was copied onto a matrix of magical energy. I'm not saying there can't be an ass pull recovery but I am saying he had to go to make room for Golem Taimi
---
I don't believe any character is dead until I see a body. You can thank Marvel Comics for that.
---
There's external pages for that purpose. Best example I can think of (I wonder why) is [timer.silversunshine.net](http://timer.silversunshine.net).

Then send support a mail, they might be able to fax it over to you.

it’s good GPM if you value keys at all; buying a key costs about 20g if you get the 25-pack when they’re on sale. you can knock this out in like 10 minutes and it’s once a week.
---
How do the weapons\skills work? Do I have to unlock then for every run? Do they reset? Or is it like bloodstone fen glider skills that you only have to unlock once?
---
Me neither. I'm assuming the email that's supposed to be sent is automated so I was expecting to find it immediately in my inbox. Wasn't in my spam folder either. 
---
Hey, thanks for this! Pretty awesome of your guild.
---
Off to the friendship camp with you.

I have no problem being an asshole to dumb idiots like you.

Ah I missed that :) thanks for taking the time to explain:)
---
He's a really really skilled person, currently have my 6th commission going can't wait to see the finished artwork!
---
I've spent a while not playing but am surprised also at the lack of new hairstyles and makeover items that are not added to this game. Usually that's something a mmo updates a lot.
---
You could use an ancient method called pen and paper. You write down the name of each thing you want to do daily. On first day you put a 1 infromt of each. On the second day a 2 and so on.
---
Have you tried bounties or the LFG feature?
---
I feel that area could use a revamp.
---
Perhaps a way for people to say "I'm interested" and then a UI to form group when a sufficient number of people queued up to join the group?
---
More tips.
---
It's longuer but if you have a 40 anniversary tome or even more then lvl 40. Do the story until the meating at the lion arch (lvl 40 in story mode). You'll get a second black lion key for free.
---
BTW my personal time is 17'58''. No record but can try to record the next one. 
---
Does the Prototype Position Rewinder works here ?
---
That's why they are outfits and not armor. They are designed to not be mixed.
---
not likely. your entire skill bar changes, you can relax in Sab though, fall damage doesnt apply. but you can fall off and it takes a life from you 
---
a star wars lightsaber with the same attack sounds
---
emerald was a dungeon drop and quite common once the scs got popular. but i agree about the  design
---
Since it is now weekly most players I talk to do the 4 keys run.
---
You do the lvl 10, 40 and 60 story steps + the season 2 EP 6 "Tangled Paths" for the 4 keys.
---
Takes me close to 3 hours but I don't REALLY speedrun it.
---
Look through /r/guildrecruitment for guilds, there are often posts for casual/do-everything guilds (as versus hardcore fractal/raid or WvW-focused guilds).
---
Well it is marketing, but it's really the opposite of asshole design. They are giving something away for "free" for subscribing to their newsletter, because you know, they actually want people to read the newsletter lol (who would have figured mirite).
---
The truth is that it isn't free, but instead of paying for the skin with gems, real money or even play time, they just ask your permission to add you to their mailing list which is less then they charge for anything else in the gem store. A tv advertisement is honestly more "asshole design" because it takes your time, is disruptive and demands your attention without giving you anything in return for that.
---
No, I don't want to look edgy.
---
Festival is not live for ~5hrs but you can read some of the [changes here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72311/game-update-notes-march-26-2019).
---
Good thing they can ban people on tumblr
---
Hmmm, i think was still ok. I didn't feel much pressure dodging wise on my power reaper. What I dont like about the whole situation is some people on the gw2 forum and reddit kept saying there was no counter to slippery slope which is not true. I think if the average players understood better what the counters were they probably would have atleast been -ok- with slippery slope.
---
Maybe try all capslock?
---
1. You can't.
---
2. Renown-Hearts in post HoT maps (i.e. LS3, PoF, LS4) are repeatable and reset daily. You will only need to clear them once for map completion.
---
3. Metabattle is updated semi-regularly. Some builds will be outdated. However, since you are asking about open-world, this doesn't matter whatsoever.
---
no problems here (EU)

This already failed for him so there was no use in mentioning it.

---
I don't think you can call it not being a priority when it's here after 7 years. It never saw The Table.
---
My favourite challenging solo content is Arah paths 2 and 3 (1 can't be soloed, 4 is a bit too hard for my tastes), and for some reason, T4 Aetherblade fractal. Lots of great fractals to solo though.
---
It seems to say per gear in the header, so a random piece of gear of a certain level if I understand right. Or the rates of blue gear dropping out of champ bags and unid gear would differ?
---
So long we have waited. 
---
that's your own opinion, personally prefer using my mouse buttons for utility skills and keeping my dodge to default considering it's right above spacebar and I don't have to move my hand. but that's my choice 
---
I said that in my answer. However people still die, people still join late to the maps, when the squad is already somewhere else, or people maybe deviate from the commander to capture a camp or something or are simply roaming a bit. 
---
I would gladly join with my chrono.
---
PM me if you are still interested: altsax.1463

good thing they can ban people on facebook
---
Ha! You were gonna unsubscribe right away. I see you!
---
Probably you are right, every person is different. 
---
Combine 2 eternities to craft it.

I'm pretty sure that even if the comic book character gets killed they just make another universe to bring them back anyway.

---
I'll definitely spread this tradition ! I don't know where it comes from but that's awesome ! And so sweet ! We need more things like this. Anywhere, anytime !
---
Some bounties actually do provide you with unique skins and miniatures like hydra heads from a Legendary Starcaller. But about everything else... You're arguing with a wrong person, after i've finished the luminescent armor collection i've changed my priorities and instead of playing what gives me the most reward i started to focus on activities which gives me the most fun, because otherwise i might get stuck with the thing i don't want to do.
---
Would you consider Soulbeast easy to play and decently non-squishy?
---
You might be remembering that March 30 is, indeed, a Saturday. But I believe that\_shaman is referring to April 30, which you may confirm does pop on a Tuesday
---
No u
---
Maybe . Do you think people will relist some of their items at lower rates in accordance once it levels out/ inflation is partially fixed ? 
---
Things like Ascended Crafting mats, Exotic skins ( looking at you Exotic hunter achievement.. okay well 4 of the skins from you), And a few lower-tier mats would take amounts of time similar to crafting a legendary if they weren't adjusted down post-'Leveling Out' of the markets
---
Well, *something's* leaking. Just a matter of how long it takes for ANet to plug the hole.
---

---
At first I didnt recognize that name, but once wiki shows image I remember. That Centaur. Once it hit my buddy with attack in middle of his dodge, we both saw it. That was giant "fuck you" from game.
---
I think Aurene is a rightful queen in her own right.
---
Like I said, this is not something you can predict but this was more of an educated guess.
---
If there is a lower amount of unidentified gear through drops in the game then this will effect the acquisition of skins, materials through salvage and sigils and runes. The lower the amount you will get the lower the supply will be. On the other hand, you still have the demand for those items that was, in some cases, dwarfed by the supply because of Silverwaste or Istan farming spots. Because of those farms the market was flooded with stuff and the prices got lower.
---
If the supply gets lower then the demand will eat up the buffer of extremely low prices and players will list them to higher prices. And with everything, at some point it will balance itself out but at a higher price as it is now.
---
Sure, you could speculate to buy a lot of those cheap materials or other things and wait for them to rise in value and then sell them for a profit but this is a risky endeavour because you don't know what ArenaNet is planning (friend of me invested into orichalcum before the Ascended crafting patch went live and made a huge loss), for all we know they could adjust the drops after noticing a decline or introduce another farm spot with the next patch that then is available for a year.
---
Those slippery birbs
---
Yeah I mean we can't start caring about characters, or the story. That would be ridiculous. We might even enjoy it.
---
They don’t operate the subreddit or post news here.
---
Dood revive orbs are at least useful. Meanwhile at I have all the sigils and runes I need and the perfect hairstyles town...: [https://imgur.com/BDApNZs](https://imgur.com/BDApNZs)
---
"...and NCSOFT family of products" idk, but x-man cyclops toons is coming xd
---
MF affected the level of dropped gear, as the higher it is, the more likely you are to get gear your level as a drop. 
---
But with the new UNID change, any gear that drops for a lvl 80 that isn't exotic is UNID, which is always in the range of about 75-80.
---
If you've got a mystic forge node, I really don't care much if you get precursors.
---
Oh cool! That makes perfect sense, I guess we just didn't have a mes in the party.
---
We can't buy keys anymore in Belgium because of the RNG.. 🤔
---
Condi dps got rekt because there were pulling ahead on a golem, vocal people didn't understand the inherent advantage of power dd dynamics and complained about it. A-net listened to complaints (sigh), now condi dps only exist if it can make use of conditional conditions like confusion and torment.  
---
Plus condi scourge and non-torch condi slb are kinda dumb and too simplistic to really be on top of a list anyway. 
---
Go insta-nerfed after the usual outrage.
---
That's all you got?
---
take zen meditation lessons before starting tribulation mode
---
I never got a confirmation email :(
---
Everything is viable, Minstrel was never meta. Wanna play Minstrel, go play Minstrel.
---
Afaik the gem store and the tp are just an ingame frontend for a webpage. They're pretty much always slow
---
Kind of boring
---
Anything that has to be done daily to avoid missing stuff?
---
it straight-up says, "if you're subscribed to our newsletter"
---
!remindme 7 hours
---
When you have to tank a non trivial boss (KC and Gorseval are trivial to tank while Xera is not for example) with training groups or random people Minstrel Chrono is still very useful as it gives you extra safety to deal with mechanics and mean your healers can focus more on the rest of the group than you.
---
However it has lost some of its power because of the way Chaos work now. So you can still use you feel you need it but it's less powerful than before.
---
Tempest heal is also viable but if you put a Minstrel armor on it you will have too much toughness to not be the tank in many cases.
---
Looks so much like Mikasa from Attack on titan Anime. Love this! 
---
Cycle all of my toons to do a double flax (draconis and VB farm) then elder wood (sirens and paggas wp ) and lastly thunderhead peak (iron ore) (need another quick to port spot not costly in wp to get to a mining ore so i have 2x of each i guess....
---
pd:making between 14 gold to 16 gold per hour doing this on all my toons...
---
I named my last key run character Keela Farmer and I like it so much I just might keep her around
---
If you press the up arrow  while in the text box itll cycle through older things you've typed, so you could do that to bring up a shorter msg to delete
---
I'm sure you could probably get away with "meta builds" or something though.
---
Since purple mask isn't in .dat
---
Does this confirm LS4 finale date?
---
And I asked if people who haven't bought the game can get the skin, What did I do wrong there exactly?
---
my question to you is, "why wouldn't they be able to get it?"
---
They're not a guarantee of anything.
---
Too the Druid thing, simply no. When they kill the Spirtes the Ranger will complety disapper out of the Meta. Why u ask? First Druid is a Bad healer, nearly all healer in the Meta can better heal, beside that the tempest is a much better fury, Might and protection support.(with a Skill that is like SoI) The only thing what hold the Druid at that time in the meta is Spirtes, not even the spotter is good enough to help something. As a explonation SC did last week a Sloth Speedkill without any Druid only Slb with Spirtes and Stance Share.
---
There are a lot of things that is not working well in WvW and that needs attention. Food is like on the bottom of that loooooooooong list.
---
Removing Spirit effects without buffing the healing output or the boons from Spirits is a bit harsh. Every healer and their grandmothers have ways to give 25 Might to their group while having comparable if not better healing output than Druid, among other things (see FB, Ren, Scourge and maybe even Tempest). 
---
This also would further push Druid out of Fractals, where they are also in a flimsy place. Noone would care about a 50 precision increase on Fractals where you get free crit chance from pots anyway.
---
This cuts into me like a helmet on horns, yo. ;_;
---
Just load it up and play/enjoy it.  Ignore everything else here for now and just enjoy it.
---
Doesn't matter, with mount it's easy on all of them.
---
Extractors are golden! You could never have enough of those (except you got the perma)
---
"Glowing mask skin for increased spam."
---
Meh.
---
"It is also purple."
---
**You filthy bastards.**  You know my weakness.
---
i don't see anywhere that it says "only subscribers" actually. all i see is "if you're subscribed to our newsletter."
---
since English isn't your first language, it should help you to know that a subscription generally involves a repeated payment, like paying for WoW every month, or something like that.
---
I bet endurance regen will be nerfed eventually, but removing food from WvW? Thats not wise.
---
Its viable in raids. Keep playing minstrel, get magnetite shards, get diviner gear. Have a dps set and a safe set. EZ.
---
* Upgrades are character bound. So take one character to make your dedicated "SAB character" (mine is my sylvari thief, but it doesn't matter as all profession skills/traits are nulled in SAB).
---
* You will not be able to collect pick-up Baubles beyond your cap. Initial cap is 250. So whenever you leave a SAB zone and rejoin at the SAB hub, talk to the trader and exchange your Baubles: 10 Baubles for 1 Continue Coin (you can convert them to Baubles later) and 250 Baubles for 1 Bauble Bubble.
---
   * As you get 25 Continue Coins that you don't plan on keeping on hand for e.g., Tribulation Mode, convert them back to Baubles then into a Bauble Bubble.
---
* For fun, do your first run through SAB blind.
---
* After said first blind run, look up a guide for where the wallets are. They'll be the thing you want to get first. If you're low on Baubles, then go for Shovel instead as that'll get you Baubles fast. Bomb is third priority. Then work on other upgrades.
---
* If you get to Tribulation Mode runs, download TacO. It's a godsend. Tribulation is basically a memory punishment game where one mishap = death and restart from checkpoint. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might want to get the Infinite Continue Coin; if you don't enjoy that sort of thing, just get TacO for the achievements / weapons you do want.
---
Weekly keys is like one of the most known things in this game. Every monday you see hordes of players running it. Some even make it to the lvl 40 and lvl 60 key as well. Some even pull it further and make the season 2 key and they HoT key too. There is litterally hundreds of videos on youtube about it so it is not a new thing. 
---
But then again we have new players so telling them about it is not a bad thing. If they realise they do not have to buy all their keys but can have many for free then that is also a good thing.
---
We shouldn't get build templates in competitive modes. Pve would be fine. 
---
only the lvl 10 key is weekly, all other keys you can get is when ever. You can get free key at the first level 40 chapter, and doing the lvl 60 chapters. You can also get a key from living story season 2 and from Hot the auric basin chapter with the bunny.
---
And on top of that you always have a chance of getting a key when you do map completion. It is a chance so wont always happen but it is not impossible and i would say i got most of my free keys out of that,
---
There was an update last night. Do you have arc dps meter installed? If so that is likely why. 
---
 *"There are two things that people should never see: how sausages are made and the long reach of the Xunlai."\_*[Kazuma, Xunlai pastry Chef](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kazuma)
---
It's all about Xunlais. Always.
---
Well Druid healing can always be buffed to pre-nerf levels. I don't think it's a huge deal. But I appreciate your concern.
---
As for the SC Sloth kill, it is a specific example where they chose to go with a Renegade healer instead of Druid. Their latest VG kill still has a Druid and a Diviner Renegade ([https://dps.report/LTPF-20190317-233343\_vg](https://dps.report/LTPF-20190317-233343_vg)). But even in the case of a Renegade healer they had to use a Soulbeast for Spirits (probably not the only reason, since Stance Share can improve DPS significantly, but it was probably the main reason). That's why I think Spirits can be a limiting factor when it comes to diversifying comps.

Ice GS does sound... cool

It was meant to be a nerf. But Arenanet did it in such a genius way that people in the community love the changes because it fixes inventory management to a pretty big degree.

---
Let's be honest here, this episode is going to take longer than usual to release.
---
We're due a raid wing, a legendary GREATSWORD, a living story legendary trinket, and the story patch. They're not gonna release anything until it's all ready to go. 
---
You may not be into PvP, but try what I did at the start: queue for an unranked game once per day.
---
With the way dailies are structured, you will often get 2/3 tasks done for your daily even if you lose. It will also get you into the game mode in a no-stakes environment. Then, when the new PvP season starts, queue for ranked the same way. You don't care about PvP, so don't stress about your rating, you get the same rewards if you're a bronze or a platinum.
---
I guess I didn't consider that an "issue". I don't use them either but I just ignore them. If simply seeing something on your screen that isn't really doing anything triggers you then :\`(
---
Mine aren't from reward tracks, they're from the league chests. I have 500 atm and I just went on a skinning spree.
---
They might be talking about the august sale or something. I don't follow the sales religiously, though. Also it's irrelevant because there's no law of the universe that says they can't put them on sale on different days. Neither is there a guarantee that they will.
---
Did the same too, also checked some speedrun videos for possible skips. In the end the runs ended up being really quick
---
I’m quite disappointed that I have to make 2-3 classes or hardcore pugs/guilds would drop me because 2xChrono is meta and we need 6 mirages and your Alacrigade/Condigade is much inferior... Or Power Herald which is so mediocre that I doubt would be seen some life in pugs (the easiest spec to build and play for new or returning Revs). 
---
I hope “meta” thing would change or would be completely gone. This isn’t moba. This is RPG. WoW had a lot of classes with different dps numbers, and people wouldn’t prefer specific specs, although raid composition had 25 people so more space to breath. I’ve been playing Firemage through whole WOTLK and no one complained about my dps or tried to replace me with Arcanes because I was good at doing my job. In GW2 if you wanna be good - have all geared professions because you need to be in meta...
---
I think it should be fine.  I didn't get one either.
---
If you cared about the story you'd notice that most new characters are either forgotten or sacrificed
---
Fair enough. I just need to find a consistent group that needs a ConDps Mirage (Axe/Torch And Staff ) 
---
If you want to know why Staff, It's because the evasion / extra clones are really damn useful versus Defiance bars.. And I'm used to Pugging where sometimes I have to finish off Frac-end encounters on my own. 
---
I'm gonna agree with you here
---
There is another item called "Black Lion Chests". The keys are a cashshop item that open these chests and they are given out or drop rarely. In those chests there is a random selection of cashshop items, such things as hairstyling kits, total makeover kits (which alter your characters appearance), wardrobe unlocks (which unlocks a random skin you haven't unlocked yet) or other skins. 
---
The level 10 story can be done once per week per account to get a key, so people who want a chance at those items for free will try to get one every week.
---
When I want to log in from diferent network. Past 3 numbers came from a diferent number yes. It happend to me after I checked the autoriztion in my profile for the purple mask skin. 
---
&gt; The pull is already a longer distance compared to the Focus Pull (600 vs. 450 units)
---
You're looking at the wrong part of the skill. While the placement on focus pull is 450 range, the important part of the skill is Into the Void, which is 600 range. It's instant, doesn't suffer from LoS issues, and gives you complete control over where you want to place 5 enemies, whether it be on or off the stack, without having to move yourself out there. Oh, and it reflects projectiles too, but that's just icing on how stupidly overpowered this skill is compared to every other pull in the game.
---
\&gt; I did my solo story and then the other solo story and then the other solo story and then the other solo story and then the other solo story 
---
Just curious: where did you get the idea that the stories had to be done solo? Sure they are instanced, so if you aren't in a party there won't be others with you when you do them. But that's the same for any MMO that has instanced dungeon content (lots of MMOs).
---
There's also no reason why you can't do other stuff between stories. I think the biggest criticism of GW2 is that the Story guide is the most obvious play guide so it might make it seem like that's what you're "supposed" to do. But I've learned to ignore it lol.
---
When you get your Daily bouncy chest, you get a window of Dailies you can do. That should give you a start of other activities you could be doing. Good luck!
---
which class is better to do this? warrior?
---
You use to open one of [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest)
---
Sometimes I get codes titled Verify, sometimes from an unnamed number. But the same happens for my google verification so I think you're safe.
---
Simply said. You asked for a code wich you need to get online. If there would be a third side party stealing these codes, you are not able to do anything about it. They would already have the code because it would be their number who have sending it to ou the first place. So ... even if .. you are not able to do anything about it. But its normal so dont worry ;) 
---
Meta is an encompassing issue across all games, not just MOBAs. Even in games like Apex, there's a meta dictating what guns/items are best, and which characters are picked above others.
---
It's not even unique to multiplayer games. Even single player RPGs like Dragon Age: Inquisition or Divinity have "meta" builds. It's human nature to try to optimize their setups to be faster, better and to complete their goal easier. It's not something that the developers can just make go away. 
---
So just the Guild Wars 2 newsletter and not the others? If so I guess I have nothing to worry about or is this one of those instances where I have to unsubscribe then re-subscribe again?
---
What you're saying is, we should market the API?
---
&gt; AAAAAAAAAPI!

No, I'm not stupid enough to expect my charr to look like a humanoid, nor a dog.

Anything can top that simple legendary.

/r/GuildWarsDyeJob is a good place to find this kind of stuff.

Don't forget step 5.  Wait 2 months
---
Pretty sure that's [Magitech Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magitech_armor). It's a gem store armor set but it's not currently available.
---
Just to point out that you don't really need Taco. Just watch Youtube videos and follow step by step (or jump by jump).
---
I'm still wondering if we will get just one or are Legendary Great Swords a special case where we get three?
---
Indeed. It cannot be changed by devs. I just hope pugs and some guilds will see their raiders as humans not just “meta/non-meta spec”. 
---
I’d rather play slowly and carefully with my unorganized non-meta friends in raids and Fractals. 
---
Just my opinion and vision, no offense to anyone.
---
Are you farming downvotes or something?
---
enabled all the newsletters, but im not getting a confirmation email..

Excuse me? How dare you conflate my majestic feline with that disgusting canine! I'll have you know my Charr looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/p6dXT4j.jpg).
---
just adjust your monitor brightness....

I think one thing that is often overlooked is that Anet rarely makes encounters that force the players to step outside of the meta "comfort zone" to solve. There isn't really a need to swap off the established "status quo" because there's rarely situations that call for more healing, more barrier, more boonstrip, etc. Encounters themselves may differ from each other, but what they *require* is often the same, bar a class or two.
---
It also doesn't help that Anet's release schedule is slower than a turtle in a slow contest, but they really need to make future encounters push the limits of GW2's build and combat system.
---
I feel like the flashy, overdone effects just distract from what you can do with the character... or what you, personally, are incapable of making unique. So I choose to present my characters in a unique way from the base up - it doesn't always work, But I think it ends up being better more times than it isn't.
---
OK, I actually double checked this before I finished the post. The wiki states the following:
---
**The pulled enemies will always travel 450 units in the direction of the curtain's center, unless blocked by terrain.** 
---
I thought the radius is 600, which defines the range enemies can be pulled from, but the pull itself is 450 units. So if an enemy is at the border of the circle radius, it would not be pulled directly into the middle. Did I get it wrong?
---
FIRST
---
Is this the real TJ?
---
Was there more communication that I missed? I feel like I miss so much by not trawling the forums, but there's no way in hell I'm going there.
---
How does one truly emit WvW?
---
With sheer force of will
---
&gt;A-net listened to complaints (sigh)
---
I feel like I just walked into opposite world.
---
DPS-wise I definitely think confusion needs a rework again. While I and others realise we don't *have* to go Mirage when we play DPS on the bosses it's good for, it's just that Mirage is so effective (combined with its inherent mobility - and lo and behold, Matthias and SH are bosses where having mobility is very beneficial) playing other stuff I can't help but feel I'm not bringing my all.
---
Support-wise I'm actually really glad that we've finally gone beyond 2xchrono on every boss. It's a nice change of pace and as someone that's been in groups playing the Fire Brigade comps of both types (2x FB + 1 Ren or 1 Chrono, 1 FB, 1 Ren) since Diviner's got added, the 1 Chrono, 1 FB, 1 Ren comp is just really nice to play with and around. Felt like there was a noticeable increase in efficacy, and it also helps that Renegade can also be changed to be the second healer if you need it, and since it brings some offensive buffs like AP and Soulcleave it's far less redundant than a second druid.
---
As for spirits, I have no idea how to feel about them, although I feel like Druid will always be strong as long as it can do 10-man might, and as a druid main I'd be biased. 
---
Thanks I'll try this when I get home!
---
It is. I solo'ed it on all my story characters. Though, one must not be frustrated easily. You learn something from every death and in the end it isnt actually that difficult.
---
&gt; In the Power DPS department the game looks much more balanced compared to what it was a year ago (remember when Weaver used to do over 40k in large hitboxes?). A lot of specs are very close to each other dps-wise and pugs today don't really care about which Power DPS joins the squad. Even Reaper does respectable DPS in the current meta. When it comes to hardcore guilds you would see that different power dps classes are being used on different bosses which is a very good sign. It shows that as of now there is no dominant power dps class in the game and certain classes are optimal for certain bosses due to the nature of their DPS (burst DPS vs. others) and other boss-specific factors. I think the power dps meta is in a healthy state. 
---
Being "very close to each other dps-wise" is not necessarily good. In fact, it is almost certainly bad. Why? Because it creates a risk/reward disbalance where easier, less risky builds are hugely favoured. Let's take a look at the stats from the last "completed" balance iteration ([Dec 11](https://www.gw2raidar.com/global_stats/12/All%20raid%20bosses)):
---
* Despite being near the top of the chart, both Power Chrono and Weaver have relatively small sample sizes (10415 and 8229 respectively).
---
* The hugely popular builds all have somewhat lower dps: Daredevil (**16500**), Dragonhunter (**22514**)  and Holosmith (**19059**).
---
* An interesting observation is that while Chrono and Weaver are higher in the 99th and 90th percentile, they are substantially lower in the 50th percentile: Chrono (10898), Weaver (11148), Daredevil (13344), Dragonhunter (14507) and Holosmith (16487).
---
The correlation between popularity and **average** performance is obvious. All that "healthy balance" does is greatly skew the popularity toward easier, more reliable builds. That's problematic, as it puts complex, riskier builds at a huge disadvantage. Not only you aren't given an incentive to learn one, you're being penalized heavily. And before you say "L2P", the very nature of the term "90th percentile" means that only 1 out of 10 players has the potential to learn such a build. And out of these 10%, how many would bother?
---
A boat.
---
I'm not sure how it would work, but I'd like to see more bosses like VG with reasons to take *both* condi DPS and power DPS, but maybe not in the way VG does it where condi DPS is just for the red guardian. 
---
For the longest time my Sylvari druid was parked with the name Ryun Grayfeather, I finally renamed her recently to a more salad appropriate name.
---
OK, couple of things:
---
1) I never said Firebrand can't tank. I said Chrono is the better tank overall. Try tanking the Hydra on Qadim with a FB. You'll see what I mean.
---
2) I never said FB needs SoI to keep up Quickness. SoI is just a nice bonus that extends other boons as well and also allows Firebrand to go with less boon duration if you wanted to push more dps.
---
3) If FB or Ren goes heal in any of those comps and you don't take Druid as a healer you wouldn't have Spirits unless you went with a Soulbeast. And that's not that great.
---
4) Giving Largos as an example is a bit odd since it's the only encounter in the game where you split. Portal tactic is a pretty bad tactic that no one really uses. The fact that you split makes it interesting but still Double Chrono is best since you can play Condi Chrono. But yeah Chrono+FB+Ren works good there as well. But keep in mind you still have to provide 25 Vulnerability on one side (no Storm Spirit) and that side won't have Sun Spirit either.
---
5) I really don't think you should play with 2 FBs on Matthias. It will be near impossible to keep everyone in Mantra range to give Quickness due to constant movement of the boss.
---
6) Firebrand tome 1 skill 3 is the worst pull in the game. Literally. Near useless in a raid environment.
---
The main reason people would bring Druid over other healers in Fractals is that they already have a Chrono and Druid covers the rest of the important boons, CC, and supplies Frost Spirit and GoE I think. Fractals GoE should even be more valuable as fights are shorter and there are frequent breakbars for extra damage, which GoE %damage buff should scale multiplicatively. 
---
But without Frost Spirit it won't be enough to bring a Druid I think. Druid healing output was nerfed supposedly because they didn't have to choose between healing and offensive support, but since then we have specs like FB and Ren which can provide the offensive boons with superior healing and CC. I think Frost Spirit is the only thing holding Druid in a spot at the moment, if at all.
---
I've used, last year to complete W1 Tribulation (for Red Moto Infusion) a macro made with my mouse software (razer) and i didnt get banned or something. 
---
To the top this comment goes!
---
Balance may not be the best but, shoot me if I'm wrong, I feel like it has been steadily improving a lot over the past year. We've gone from staff weavers on every bloody boss and 2x chronomancers always being a given, with any alternative FB/Ren compositions being laughed off, to somewhat better power class variety and FB/Ren compositions being seriously considered on some bosses instead of the standard 2x Chronomancer composition. 
---
Nah wiki is just wrong on that one. Go test it ingame, it's a 600 radius pull.
---
Seriously. It just gets to the point I don't let myself get attached to characters. 
---
One can argue that this is exactly what you have right now. High skill cap builds are topping the charts by a 2-3k margin, but are played by 2-3 **times** less players. Is that "healthy" in your book?
---
The differences should be measured on the 50th percentile. If hard builds had 10-20% advantage there, it would create a reasonable choice of "potential performance" vs "reliability". But the same advantage on the 90th percentile is meaningless. It affects only a handful of people. 
---
By the way, a 50th percentile advantage would more or less shoehorn the hardcore players into hard builds, as it will be way more pronounced on the 90th. But I'd say this is preferable to what we have now.
---
Its still viable to tank don't worry that much. Just don't run Chaos, there is no point on that
---
Thanks Bro!
---
Oh wow that is odd... I hope you will manage to fix it!
---
It hasn't been updated in a while to my knowledge, but [GW2 POA](https://samhurne.github.io/gw2pao/) can track daily tasks based on coordinates. 
---
In many situations, you can place the coordinate checker at a logical location to show completion, AB 1st chest for example.
---
OK cool, that's the number I had in my mind before writing everything. I guess wiki managed to meme me. I will edit the post. Thanks for the clarification.
---
The only problem with this is that spirits and turrets are able to be attacked and destroyed by the enemy. If you make a change like that where you try to homologize spirits and turrets to be pseudo banners, you'd either have to make banners able to be attacked, or make spirits and turrets unable to be attacked. 
---
In the case of engineer, making turrets unable to be attacked would further need to change them to either not have attack capabilities (yes, they're super niche utility choices for DPS, but that takes the last shred of uniqueness away from them) or severely limit their offensive capabilities to avoid them becoming a huge issue again in PvP (I don't think that skill split could work in this case, nor do I believe that it even should be attempted in this situation).
---
I don't want to rule out your opinion as a non-option; I think it could work as a last resort if they wanted to go this route. I just hope that there are more elegant and interesting solutions out there rather than just making turrets and spirits reskinned banners.
---
&gt; Has anyone even made that?
---
Saw the Orr-themed zombie hammer, made Juggernaut instead. Y-Y
---
You're not alone no, its a commonly failed event. That doesn't mean it needs nerfed into easy mode though just because it takes coordination and actual setup from the players and not just the hosting guild or group. I've been pug runs that worked out, but they still asked everyone to bring all the CC they could and did plenty of demonstrations on how and when to CC the bosses so that everyone knew what was up without voice comms. I do agree the rewards are very lackluster, but that's an entirely different issue since we are discussing the difficulty. I feel the event is fine. Takes more work than spamming 1, requires a group that doesn't just use all skills off of cooldown either. It takes game knowledge but can still be completed with randoms so long as it's organized beforehand. I know its rare for events in this game not to become as second nature as breathing.. I remember when Teq and TT nearly never succeeded either, but the right groups running them got the job done, and now the roles are known and easy to complete. Ire is different though, simply because of the breakbars. Fail that and you fail the event itself, and it isn't as forgiving as bone wall on Teq. 
---
I think you have this mindset that just because a guild is hosting it, that pugs aren't allowed.. and that is so rarely the case. Pugs often make up the majority of the group attending, and just because you have pugs, it doesn't mean the event automatically fails.. you've obviously had bad run ins with the event, i've had them too, it sucks, but there are dedicated runs several times a week that easily succeed, just that without good reward nobody a reason to get it done so only a few guilds host it that are actually coordinated enough to succeed it. Other than the idea that it is an event and should be completed regularly, whats your reason for wanting to succeed it. Are you missing collection items and getting pissed that there are no good runs of the event when you're on, or do you legitimately just like the event and want to see it succeed more. If it's the latter, you and your guild need to rethink how they approached the pugs last time, and try to take it on more. Experience is key, and explaining the mechanics is very vital. 
---
My guess is that they will be sending a code that can be added to an account through their website, to the email address that is subscribed to the newsletters. So (in theory) you open the email, get the code, log in to account.arenanet.com, then find the page to 'redeem code' and it will be added to your account. Which will then unlock the skin when you log in to the game.
---
TL;DR - yes this can be claimed by f2p accounts as well, as long as they are subscribed to the newsletter.
---
Imagine if ArenaNet will spam you about GW1 news. I won't unsubscribe from that.
---
There’s really only two options with banners and spirits though. They’re always going to be mandatory just through the nature of existing. So either you give more options to create variety, or you totally remove them, which I think is the far less “elegant” solution. 
---
Eh, I think it LOOKS awesome. But this is my 4th characters leveling to 80 and every time I get to HoT content.... I just can't. It's like I'm going to a job I hate.

I don't know how you enjoy it, but that whole area feels like torture to me.

dodge jump macro is allowed nowadays
---
I know TaCo was here even last SaB . Thats why there were problems and discussions. Thats why Im not sure if we can use it or not. 
---
I don't think so. From what I see the best you could probably go for is running something like the open world farming build so your GS ambushes tag lots of people in fight.
---
I'm on the same boat with you. I dislike TaCo making the event easy and removing all the "fun". Sadly TaCo isn't going anywhere tho.
---
There not much micro management to do on Ranger since you only have your cooldowns to worry about.
---
I can think of 2 variants that are fun to play:
---
* [Power Greatsword Soulbeast](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_Greatsword), very fun to play, big numbers will display (which always feel nice). For the rune you could with any cheaper power rune alternative that you know of (Rune of Strength, Rune of the Eagle or Rune of the Thief are pretty interesting here)
---
* [Condi Trapper Soulbeast](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Condi_Trapper), very easy to play. It's condi so it's a bit less efficient while running around than a power build but will work out ok too (cheap alternative to viper gear is provided in the build guide)
---
Most veteran players have some stockpiled for whatever crafting needs they may have, and trash the rest and/or use a gobbler. See the link below for info. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter
---
I have TaCo myself . Never used it for any events. Only for Desert Highlands for treasures. I got really good memory for Trib and with Taco it wouldnt be fun. But I might use it this time to save time. We shall see how it will be this time. 
---
Do not nerf mirage. If it wasn't for the incredible busted Confusion the class would be dead. Rework Confusion.... again; Some bosses simply give this Condition too much damage.
---
&gt; Cat ears with glasses.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Wait, that's three words.
---
Wait, that's four words.
---
Nah man the technology is there and I allrdy saw it, back in the days townscloathing (or whatever it was called) could be individually matched with other equipment and normal skins alike.
---
Then 2 years after release they locked those newly called armorsets and therefore killed a lot of variety.
---
What you guys want was allrdy there, I still got screenshots from it. It was so cool...
---
really dont know why they removed it.
---
I went through the trouble of learning all the traps etc while speedrunning the maps. I'm just hoping they don't do any patches to W1Z3 so I can get my record back.
---
That's correct, it wouldn't surprise me if Druid would still be popular if they removed the passive effects of spirits.
---
It brings a lot of utility to the table. Just imagine VG and Gorse pug squads without Entangle. It would take them a while to adjust ot that. Or Soulless Horror without a Druid push. That's something to watch for \^\^
---
Then don't use it.
---
If your fun requires that other people don't use it, then this isn't about fun, its about a soap box.
---
What about minstrel guard *huehue*...

daggers to attack and short bow to move faster inside missions

that's because you can make both sunrise and twilight, unlock their skins, put them into the mystic forge to create eternity, and then sell eternity to get both sunrise and twilight skins at a massive discount
---
GW2 is a glorified online single player game that is trying to be a TV show.
---
There isn't much of a reason to talk to people or group up for a lot of content unless you really want to.
---
"Working on a new mounted skill to dismount other players"
---
That is huge ! And could make me enter seriously into WvW. Just for the fun this update could provide ! (-:
---
Chronos are still valuable to zergs by providing portal bombs, alacrity and Focus 4 and 5 which are powerful team fighting tools.
---
I think there are some lunatics which also run Danger Time Chrono and unload their entire arsenal on the enemy before backing off. 
---
Scourge is a touchy subject. I main it btw. 
---
Scourge is underrated. First, it can provide good 5 man barrier (8k+). Second, can provide might too (although you will always be running a support that can do this so it doesn't matter so much). Has condi cleanse on low cd (that converts condis instead of just removing them which is a bonus) and can corrupt boons with ease. 
---
Plus, it has epi which is still useful in some bosses. 
---
All the qualities above make Scourge a kinda good dps on noob comps, for instance, kiting at Largos Twins, kiting at Sab, epis for sloth/Trio/Xera/MO/Desmina. Even tho epis aren't meta in all those bosses, it still is insanely useful. Not only that, current meta scourge has 21k+ HP, with self barrier and self cleanse, it is pretty sustainy too. So if we're to buff scourge, it needs to be a very small one. I agree 29K is kinda low, but I wouldn't buff it much higher than that. 
---
I was with you until you got to the part with Druids. I think they're actually fine where they are. Attempting to nerf their offensive support just to buff their meh healing will just make them have to compete with other stronger healers who already offer good support like Heal Ele/FB (and to a lesser extent, Renegade/Necro) while also impacting the option of carrying Spirits on Soulbeast.
---
The only real issue with Druid as a healer is that the tradeoff (lower healing, stronger offensive buffs) doesnt matter much because the content isnt always delivering damage that makes needing a dedicated, high-healing setup mandatory in good groups since they can mitigate the risks enough to get away with having just one. That doesnt mean that you wont be safer still having that Heal Ele/Necro/FB around to cover mistakes, but just that its not "necessary' if your group is good enough at avoidance/mitigation. So before asking for changes like that, I'd like to see more content that makes the idea of having stronger healing actually realized and potentially preferable first.
---
How often do you use them?  I have 10 level 80 toons and they all have a custom look... I still have like 300 of them and use them like crazy.  I mostly WvW, maybe you get more there or something.
---
On condi boss, druid buff are not that much important (only sun spirit). I think a tempest give way more boon, heal and condi clean which make him a really good alternative.
---
On zerk boss like Samarog and Sloth, CC is so much important than the renegade become opti.
---
On other zerk boss (like VG, KC, Amalg), druid buff can't be compete. (+ glyph is lot more usefull on burst boss)
---
Just no.
---
👍
---
Portal bomb is never used. Alacrity you can't share and focus 5 is useless. 
---
Danger time chronos also aren't lunatics, but try to bring as much as they can from the class. 
---
I understand they dont instantly get better. I dont understand how they think game design will help them bypass this process. I know for a fact it will not. 
---
Obviously for a small time after the mount patch, meta and strategy goes out of the window entirely... but that doesn't last.
---
Making the game more forgiving in a pvp scenario just makes pushing an advantage harder. And this just makes another aspect of wvw harder, but that's the side these new players dont notice so they pretend it's a magic improvement.
---
Are all of them limited to three per week?
---
Silverwastes and a WvW spawn come to my mind.
---
My comment was generally within the context of higher level play.
---
Without spirits, FB/ren/chrono has much greater offensive support. Might really isn’t particularly an issue with the comp due to the renegade and the warrior. Might doesn’t need to come from only one source.
---
Obviously the utility of the comp is lackluster, but I suggested an improvement of that anyway. Regardless, high level groups are able to work around that anyway if it isn’t. 
---
Do people actually think food is too strong in wvw? Like is that actually a complaint people have? I'm genuinely curious why people would think that this is an issue.
---

You don't fix that... there one aspect of balance you forgot and it's player skill. Since you talkin mainly raids: people (#notall) need a low skill class in order to enter raids.

I wanted to edit my OP but the edit button wasnt where it was supposed to be, it wasnt there at all.

By Ogden's Hammer, what savings!!!
---
* First Tab: 1k Blue Unid Gear salvaged directly with CFSOM (30s salvage cost)
---
* 2nd Tab: 1k Blue Unid Gear salvaged directly with RCSOM (3g salvage cost)
---
* 3rd Tab: 1k Blue Unid Gear salvaged directly with SFSOM (6g salvage cost)
---
* 4th Tab 1k: Blue Unid Gear identified and then salvaged blues and greens with CFSOM (30s salvage cost)
---
* 5th Tab: 11 rares and 1 exotic dropped from the identified batch of 1k blue unids that were salvaged into tab 4
---
-------------
---
Nothing really surprising here. When salvaging Blue Unids directly, the rarity of the salvage kit doesnt really have an impact, so use your copper fed or basic kit. 
---
1k Blue Unids salvaged directly currently yield around 14-15g (lowest listing value), the small differences in value I would attribute to RNG and my relatively small sample size.
---
And just like with green and rare unids, its more profitable to identify blue unids first and then salvage the results because with this method, you get additional rare and exotic drops that add about 10-20% of value, including a very low chance of a shiny precursor dropping.
---
devs actually like being told how someone uses their platform vs the bosses coming up with random shit. If you make it and they aren't going to use it, why are you making it? Devs can make almost anything happen, if they know what it is you want done, otherwise you are getting a bunch of garbage interface from non-users.

Hmm now that I think about it maybe Nomad's could be better than Minstrel's for WvW. Boon duration is not really important any more.

Playing Mesmer got a bit pointless for most squads though.  You can still play it but it's definitely not the best choice.

If that's the case, then I guess it's time to quit the game.

Hello there!
---
I feel like I might get downvoted for this, but I don't see any problem with current meta. In fact I love it. Each of the support combinations can be used with similar results, the power creep is a lot less than it was before and doesn't need any more nerfs imo, and most classes do pretty similar dps so that you can bring almost any class to any encounter and pull comparable dps. Only thing that I agree needs a nerf is mirage. That class is the only outlier in my eyes, everything else seems pretty close and balanced right now, and honestly I do not see any reason for nerfs anymore. Instead I would suggest playing around with buffs for some of the weaker classes (power reaper? condi scourge?) again, since I'm sure we all can agree that seeing a class being buffed is more fun than seeing a other classes being nerfed, and in the end it is more about fun than about having the perfect balance imo, especially since as I said i find the meta that we have right now to be incredibely balanced and diverse already.
---
That was removed because town clothing was basically like a 4th armor set. They had to check every new piece against every other piece that would be adjacent to it, and that limited the kind of stuff they could do, like skirts of different sizes, baggy pants and boots that go up to the knees.  
---
Appearances would have to be much more complex and detached from armor to allow such variety, and pieces would have to have many variations to avid clipping.  
---
So it was simpler to scratch all of that and do outfits with fixed appearances instead. 
---
But hats are particularly different, since they go on the head and they are already split in every outfit, as Personal Story cinematics require outfits to hide the head.  
---
Having hats split and up the next won't eliminate clipping, but it greatly reduces the chances of getting it.
---
If they split outfits into hats and costumes there would be still a few hats that would clip, like the hood from the Arcane Outfit, and the things on the neck of the Ghostly outfit, so in those cases it could be like with the armors that override other slots, like the light flame legion chest armor that covers the legs.  
---
For those the hat would still be limited to just the hat of that armor and those that stay on top of the head or on the face and won't clip, but for the rest that won't clip, it'll allow many interesting combinations. 
---

Anet, you know how your pvp slumbering mistforged chest armors do not transform while in combat? Please let there be a "slumbering" raid medium chest armor so it does not transform into that "trenchcoat".

Since it would not transform, it would be less work and players will be happier with no "trenchcoat".

Last year he was at prision in rata sum, have you searched there? You need to jump off limits of the rata sum cube and you'll get inside the prision.

I've actually been subscribed to the newsletter for years and honestly, only ever get a mail when a new episode is out and it's always later after the episode has been out (strangely). It's def not a spammy one.

My mesmer has been blind. Now she gets to see again.

Also pls 4th dye channel for the freaking glow for all the armors

Yes

My personnal record is 12:25 iirc, that abusing the home instance node to skip tutorial area, and insta killing last boss by precasting meteor shower, also mounts and executioner axe.
---
Seems like you need to do it in order as the crown NPC was asking me for a hat 
---
Thanks for the 3 threads with all the research.
---
Sugoooii xD i like it so cool
---
Bet you had a lot of fun(loot) there ^^
---
Key Farm:
---
1. Make a human (any class, I use warrior), in the character creation choose to be a "commoner" middle option, rest doesn't matter.
---
2. Finish tutorial zone, you should be level 2 now, use 8 tomes of knowledge to lvl up to 10.
---
3. Do the 5 story missions, last one should get you a key.
---
But to do it fast there are many strategies. It would take a long time to explain how to cut time in every story missions (and even in tutorial area). So watch some video, maybe this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4WjSnuoyDE
---
Yes, that is absolutely healthy. Guild Wars 2 is not a game where time commitment, gear progression, variable raid difficulties and secondary power progression systems can cover up issues with imbalance. In WoW, if your preferred class ends up under powered with a particular balance change, your position in a long term group with your main is probably fine because you've already levelled the character and progressed in both gear and secondary systems.
---
That isn't the case with Guild Wars 2 as the systems are not in place to support. There is no time commitment to levelling once you've reached the stage of clearing raids - use tomes of knowledge. There is very little commitment for getting geared in ascended items - if you've been raiding or doing fractals for a while you are probably swimming in ascended gear. There are no secondary power systems. There are no variable difficulties. There are no variable rotations that necessitate frequent practice due to different stat breakpoints.
---
As a result, if the balance of professions is not good, a large number of players will switch to the most successful profession. We saw it with Tempest, with Weaver, with Deadeye, with Scourge and currently with Mirage. Therefore, professions absolutely need to be within a reasonable range of damage output otherwise people will feel that they cannot, and should not, play what they enjoy. That the current power professions that are more difficult to play have a higher maximum DPS output is absolutely fine. For DPS, condi options really need work to be in a similar situation. 
---
Just confirmed, the hidden room isn't a new one, it's the one reached by activating checkpoint 3 and using the boost to go back the way you came.
---
The problem is that most PvE balance is being done around Raids. And raids are a just a fraction of the PvE experience.
---
Ah right I completely forgot about that, thanks :)
---
Ah that's right - I was thinking after CP2 because you use the jump from CP3 or the shrubs after CP3 to backtrack into that stretch!
---
&gt; Two words:

Also reddit users tend to dislike subs run by companies for obvious reasons.

I found the tree for Epic Apple accidentally in the secret cave in the hub. You need to transform into a Bee Dog in the clouds then fly down there.
---
I'd go with a little rework on luck mechanics:
---
* Increase luck from legendary essences to 10000k, make legendary luck drops rarer accordingly.
---
 * Add recipes to craft 1 legendary luck from 20 exotic essences. 
---
 * Allow salvaging essences of luck to get lower tiers.
---
 * Add a material slot for legendary essences of luck.
---
 * This would let people store more luck for crafting recipes in less space.
---
* Increase account luck cap to 777.
---
 * The cost per tier stops at 30K at 218 luck. This would be changed to keep going. The total luck cost at 300 luck would be the same, but the cost per tier would not stop at 218 and increase every tier up to 777.
---
 * This cap won't be increased with free consumables, banners, environment effects, weekly events or festival effects, with the exception of the canthan new year bonus, that would be increased to 111 and stack with the base, giving a base of 888.
---
 * Only gemstore boosters like those from the BL chests would go past this cap. 
---
 * This means that after a certain point stacking MF would be easier as it won't require foods, banners guild effects and the like once you've consumed enough luck. But MF from paying gems would still work, so it won't discourage spending gems.  
---
* Add a luck gobbler that can be earned, purchased or bought in the gemstore during canthan new year (and during gesmtore sales or from the festival vendor the rest of the year). 
---
Returning player. Could someone tell me what happened to the [greatsaw](https://www.gw2spidy.com/item/36340) item?  Was it re-released or what?  Have one from the original event and unsure whether to sell, use, or hold without knowing why the price crashed.
---
Can you log in to manage your account on the website? You can change your email that way.

Less than a minute

And imagine some ppl still thinks TacO is cheating:-P
---
You tell it as a joke, but an emote panel would be a good idea.
---
It could be a new button in the chat panel.
---
I mean it's not like I have anything else to spend the Baubles on anyways. And I like SAB.
---
True on both points. Was more thinking they could make different designed glowing eyes if they were all dyable. E.g., like the difference between glowing mask and bloodstone visage (or w/e it's called).
---
Oh yea I maybe expressed myself badly, I mostly responded to the "what do you think of current meta?" part of your post.
---
I don't think the pull changes would be bad of course, I mean I'd love seing skill #3 of firebrand's tome pulling in a bigger range, that would definitely be a qol increase for comps that don't provide a chrono. The spirit change, I don't know.. Thing is I don't mind some specific buffs being pretty strong right now (banners, spirits, AP, Spotter etc.), I think it is an interesting way to make a class meta even if it doesn't have very strong dps, such as soulbeast in the renbrand comp. If spirits would be nerfed a lot that would simply result into the druid being replaced by a tempest in the double chrono comp and the soulbeast being replaced by another dps in the renbrand comp. GoE isn't worth bringing a druid for its very low dps, tempest also buffs the party by a bit while doing way more dps than a druid ever could, making it effectively better than a druid that only can provide GoE. Same goes for spotter, it wouldn't justify bringing a ranger/druid, except if they would increase auras to be 10man, which I honestly wouldn't even mind, but that's a whole other story.
---
Regarding power reaper, yea, I guess you are right.
---
ArenaNet treats us like cows, they keep milking us for our money. Play gw2 but don't buy skins or any of that new harvesting tools they recently added. Wait until they fix their game. Play gw1

Not likely at this point in time, sales are almost over and hopefully one of them will be KEYS

Yes, any image of someone sitting down is an opportunity for this old chestnut.

Unlikely, considering the vendor didn't open until the event started.
---
&gt; they are designed for solo players -&gt; solo content,
---
"they"?
---
It's what I said before, it's your choice how much interaction with other players you want (except for dedicated group content ofc). Solo, together with a friend, as a party of 5 ppl or up to 50 ppl for open world stuff, whatever you want.

This is fake and not rendered in-game because there is no clipping!

Talkin about a Group of Snakes at the end of the Acid Maze? Because i cant seem to find an exit to that one
---
save it till you need it for something is my recommendation

I don't do pve, sorry if expecting competency from other players is elitism but that used to be normal.

Do you mind sharing some more info? I can't find the cannon, nor the snakes.

Bit of a corollary: [S4 Stuff](#s "Revs can channel the spirit of Joko to convince the guards to let them out of jail. But Joko isn't dead i.e. living in the Mists as a denizen rather than visitor.")

Food on its own isn't an issue. The issue arises when effects stack too much with each other. Endurance food + endurance traits + endurance runes + endurance skills... and a Berserker thief can spam Vault for half an our and survive spamming in the middle of an enemy zerg as long as nobody puts down a ward. 
---
It would be better if there was fixed caps to certain effects that can currently be stacked, so adding too much of them together is a waste, and diversification is more efficient. 
---
You have a material storage you can deposit your stuff into, you can either use the mats for crafting new items, or selling them for general profit.
---
Typically you get so much gear in this game salvaging is necessary to reduce clutter.  Especially since when you reach 80 you will either be crafting weapons or armor or saving up currency to purchase from a vendor, materials will be useful to sell or have in either situation.

If more people would do it sandswept isles is freaking fantastic with t3 Karmic retribution.

I remember when we would get allot of people there and you could easily get 35-40k karma for 8 min work off of either of the 2 meta events &amp; that was in addition to decent amounts of drops and magic.

Wow I created a content creation platform that's the basis of a patreon content creator now :D Now I feel real startup-hipster-y. :D
---
You need to find the hidden cannon in 1-3, which is through a bombable wall back up behind the zone start.  You need to loop around before the bottomless pit to get up there.  Once you launch via the cannon, you can go up and over to find an area with a ton of acid set up like a maze.  Find your way through that to get past the snakes and to the chest.

2 letters and 1 digit for a license plate ? Did you remove characters in the white areas ? Or is that in Vatican ?
---
I'm at work as well, really busy this week too :(
---
All I want to do is finish tribulation mode so I can get my blue cube infusion. 
---
For Most food  your correct.
---
Endurance regen food is broken on a couple specs however (most notably mesmer, guardian &amp; warrior who have on dodge traits which can account for a ton of damage or utility)
---
In the Vatican, with Minnesota plates.
---
I'm curious what old games SAB is based on, or if there is anything similar I could play on my ipad, since we won't be getting any new worlds..  
---
That look when your charr mate leaves you for an asura to RP with...

Hehe:-P
---
Aurene aimed for kralks head, see how that worked out?
---
I wish more classes had pulls like Chrono's focus 4.
---
Minnesota has less population than Vatican ?

I mean, I know about Jack O'Neill when he goes there fishing, so that's 1. How many other people live there ?

Staff 1 (everyone the beam pass through) 
---
Staff 2
---
Staff 3 (+blast finisher)
---
Staff 5 (combo field that can be blasted) 
---
Your healskill will heal all depending on which one you use + traits 
---
Horn 5 to blast staff 5 another time (staff 5 - 3 - swap - warhorn 5)
---
The big bomb is very nice, 5 baubles per use but a big blast  :)  
---
&gt;y
---
ahh, that one. thanks. appreciate it
---
Was actually keeping an eye out for the outfit to use on one of my Holosmiths!
---
Well the prices of unid gear tanked
---
Use your heal skill (glyph, spirit active, or trap, depending on the situation), blast the water field from staff 5 with staff 3/warhorn 5, cast staff 2 often, and remember to cast glyphs on top of your allies to hit them with lesser seed of life (verdant etching trait).
---
"TacO is cheating!!!"

*Alt tabs back and forth between the game and a dulfy guide*

Yep, I found that place and the cannon. I'm having problems with the maze :P Do I need a chest key to open the final chest?

!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING IF MY GUESS TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT!!!
---
You mean died so she could ascended to godhood?
---
That's why I think it would be cool if Tempest would get a pull that works in a similar way as a Chrono pull does.
---
But honestly even then the best pull would belong to the Chrono since you can cast it from distance. The skill is simply too good \^\^
---
Why would they want arc to do it when they could profit from it?
---
For w2:
---
Cheese: Start of 2-1 (does not work in infantile mode)
---
Cake
---
Banners and spirits being removed is ok, but I think it’s be fine to give the effects to other classes. Why can’t you just slap warrior banners on necro pets? Why not just add Druid spirits to guardian summons? There are plenty of useless or “meh” skills that can be spiced up by giving them these unique effects without really buffing the skill to an OP level. 
---
As a zoologist with 13 years of experience, charr actually could be more closely related with Canus Aureus originally found in Africa. Some bone structure such as the ecdysone is present for dry and savana-like region adaptation. Charr mimics these characteristics for realism and probably to reduce the uncanny valley effect. Literally everything you just read is a lie and is random stuff I got from google.
---
Thank god this was one of my biggest worries this year, if I’d miss a few days I wouldn’t get the infusion 
---
...*meganeko*?
---
That's what I'm hoping it is, just a technical glitch.
---
For the Mythic Cake: Progress through Storm Top until you reach the Yeti. At the corner of the large ice platform is a Cliff face. Pull out your flute and play 332331 to open its mouth. Then play 133133 by the ice block to shatter it.
---
SAB is most heavily inspired by Zelda and Mario, but there are also Sonic, Castlevania, and even Frogger references. Basically any old school games you could play on console.
---
Does the upgraded bomb still cost 1 bauble per throw or is it more expensive?
---
Keys are probably the worst thing you could ever spend gems on. They're mobile game level of microtransactions. The fact that companies are even allowed to sell items like BLTC keys in a game that minors can play is disgusting.
---
Source: have spent too much money on keys and had to stop because it quickly became a very real gambling addiction.
---
Is there a place to report mistakes in poi files? All-in-one pack (a least) has a broken default-icon marker in TD at that platform with chak eggs (near ley line adventure) that's visible from everywhere in the zone. It drove me mad until I located the cause and fixed it.
---
That’s not his point, whatsoever. A game which allows you to play with other players might be a co-op campaign, but is in no way an MMO. Truth is, a lot of what gw2 has designed for open world and story is very solo centric. Ofc there are places where it does feel like an MMO, but these places tend to get a lot less focus that the open world
---
Start in staff. 
---
* Staff 2, Glyph of Empowerment, weapon swap
---
*  Quickdraw warhorn 5, warhorn 4, enter CA 
---
*  4, 5 when healing is not needed but might is, stay in CA for at least 9 seconds and use skills, 2, leave CA
---
* Quickdraw warhorn 5
---
You stay in CA for 9 seconds to wait for the Quickdraw cooldown. Do not leave CA while using a skill because Quickdraw wil be applied on the CA kill. Using seed of life before leaving CA makes the seed explode after leaving it, therefore charging up your next CA again. Warhorn 5 applies regeneration which in many cases is enough to maintain your group until CA is ready again. If not, use heal, if still not, swap to staff.
---
The incredible reward is at the end of the poison labyrinth. There is a chest standing on the poison with a platform in front of it where you can stand. You use the key to open it and tadaaa!:
---
you get &gt;!A big bomb version that consumes 5 baubles each time it is used!&lt;
---
What about the other four eyes?
---
I think they tried to encourage playing non-meta classes in the fractal Siren's Reef: The final boss has a lot of adds, so the encounter becomes a lot easier when you bring necro with Epidemic.
---
But it seems a lot of players really don't like this fractal.
---
Anyone found the "Mythic Cake" in W2? I've gone to the YETI boss in Z3 but nothing there.
---
I mean, build templates was a free feature in gw1. If anything people would flame if it was a paid for feature. I would pay and wouldn’t care. I honestly want a native dps meter and build template. But seems to me Anet isn’t making that a priority. If anything Anet should be adding more then just build templates and a native dps meter. 
---
Honestly I would say it also goes against their plan of trying to make their game as non toxic. Even though they allow arc, our community isn’t as bad as others. But if they make meters and build templates to native, it would kind of change the community. If you can ping your build, everyone has a meter, it might get more toxic, which is probably why Anet has avoided a native version. 
---
For example in raids, you already ask for kp, ping armor chest/weapon. Imagine if people could show the traits they have on. People who argue in a pug raid. Which could be bad. But also could be a good thing for training raids. Same thing for fracs. People have to look at the bigger picture. How would our community truly react to this new feature that doesn’t even give us more content. 
---
While I generally agree with your overall reasons for the game being in its current state, I still think there's justification for remaking the personal story.
---
I mean, WP's video is proof enough. It's not inherently engaging and hasn't aged well in a lot of areas. That's a new player's introduction to the game, so it's genuinely important. Plus, it's not like it would need to be remade again and again over the years as ANet gets better-- they just need to remake it once in a way that makes it less embarrassing when viewed within the context of their more recent work.
---
Making it replayable wouldn't be an awful idea either, given how much advancement has been made in story delivery. Just make the choices players originally made concrete and unable to be changed in a later playthrough.
---
And since you pointed out how people want *new* content instead of remade old content, the thing is that LS1 was wildly popular among players who actually had the time to experience it fully. And while I don't know how they'd actually be able to remake it in a replayable way, I think the content they delivered would feel very fresh to newer players who missed it, and maybe even bring back old players who were sad to see it go.
---
On that same note, imagine the excitement if ANet were to say "yo, we remade the personal story in a way that matches our modern standards. The story is the same but we hope you'll find the delivery more engaging. Also it's replayable now." I guarantee people would adore that. Just look at how much people got into the underwater combat rework.
---
I'm totally into the story of this game. I want to keep it moving as much as possible. But even I would gladly put that aside for a while if ANet was going to focus on making the game as a whole more fun again.
---
Hmm, this would be an interesting concept. I'm not against this, but this would probably take considerable time and effort to develop. So it would probably not the best solution short term. But yeah, it's a cool idea for sure. I will try to brainstorm on this.
---
Really bad advice.
---
Ohh
---
Now that I think about it I havent seen a player with legendary armor for some time.
---
Build Template could totally be native but IMO they didnt want to rush it but do it right.
---
Imagine if they add Build template that could save 1 build by character and more slots sell by gemstore like slot bag. Gear save wasnt in your bag but store in the build template. They might even have other/better idea.
---
They'll refresh each week, so on Monday when guild missions/raid clears reset you'll be able to buy more then.
---
oh hey i was there

This is awesome. I much prefer seeing art like this on my feed than commissions of GW couples characters making out. Bad ass

Is this still correct, because the CRIMSON Assassin Backpack got updated to include an infusion in it.. just wanted to make sure this wasn't a typo

I wish I knew anything about what you're talking about, but unfortunately even the guild I joined *specifically to learn how to do raids* won't let me.

So I hope y'all are having fun, I guess.

---
Burst healing comes from Staff 5 + staff 3 combo field OR staff 5 + Warhorn 5 OR Healing spring (don't run healing spirit in fractals) this is also a water field.
---
But your best healing is from Regen ticking around 500. 
---
People in T4 should not be taking random 50% damage! And once you know the boss mechanics you can anticipate burst heal after it hits you.
---
In a good group staff isn't even needed just a safety heal.
---
Figures was abroad for work .. dang
---
Well yeah it does stretch it a tiny bit, but it still took time and effort and I couldn't be more happier with the finished product :) 
---
sharur is also my favorite legendary that i'll never have. mostly because i'm kind of.. put off by the crafting process and don't really do anything that'd require it? but also because my main is a necro and so far, no hammer weapon for necro.
---
that said, i LOVE the aesthetic of it (and the aesthetic of orr in general) and the colours of it would go amazingly with my necro. maybe in the future if there's an elite spec for necros with the hammer.
---
BlackDesertOnline staff does this as well. You only get copy/paste responses to your appeal tickets. They won't even provide logs or proof. Their way is the highway.
---
I just paid a handful of in game gold, not very much at all :)
---
Im certain he wouldn't mind ;) 
---
Maybe DH wasnt the best exemple but you understand my points ;D.
---
About classes swap, I know players that does that too and play nearly all 9 classes with different build, but they clearly not understand 50% of them. This wasn't to problematic when you play Dps without giving support and stick to the Dps rotation, but its problematic for role that can support and didnt do it correctly. 
---
IMO its better to stick with fewer classes but know how to adapt his build for the situation and master how to play them. With Specialisation you can clearly custom your build for your team and bosses. It might not be the best in slot classes/build for the fight but it might the best for you and your team.
---
Ah, ok. :) 
---
Where can I find the new adventures? I went through W1Z1 on normal mode and didn't see it.
---
&gt; Rouge
---
LOL Right clearly I spelt it rightts 
---
&gt; IMO its better to stick with fewer classes but know how to adapt his build for the situation and master how to play them. 
---
If this were true and taken to heart then you'd want them to only play holosmith and mirage as they are on average the best regardless of situation. 
---
All I run is zerker so i dont need no build template.
---
People act like this is all new. Dude, let's roll back to core launch where we had a three year content drought, or how about those months and months of pro-HoT where nothing was said or done to the game...
---
Are you saying you want two actions with one keypress?

Let's be real here, most of the medium armours are ugly

Wait, do you need to subscribe to all 3 newsletters?

Thanks!  I see now it's forgable under a different item ID, that would explain it.
---
Calm down. This one has been specifically allowed.
---
If you have an alt account, multibox. Or have a ~~slave~~ friend ready with a character parked there.
---
It's achievement so it's doable on any character. 
---
do chests of legendary shards stack?
---
Ah I did wonder if it was their end - I'll just wait it out then in any case. Thanks for the reply :)
---
Yes and no, you base you analyse only on Dps output. But IMO both are a pretty selfish build and bring nearly nothing outside of there Dps. But there classes can be play with other build that can provide support if needed. Scrapper Dps can really help support and still output good Dps. Chrono Dps can bring good support too and do high Dps.
---
But if the players only know how to play Mirage but the team always dies due to lack of support, he couldnt do anything and the team will still wipe. Yeah, you can blame the support classes to be bad or other players to get hit by mechanics but it didnt help to clear the fight...
---
Classes like Guardian can play DH or Firebrand, both can help with Boons lacking ,block with Aegis, help healer with F2, support with F3, etc...
---
Revenant can carry Boons with Herald or be more Dps with Renegade and still help Might, Alacrity and survivability with Kalla.

Is it still very difficult with taco? im debating trying W2 on trib x16. Thoughts?

yes! :)

Did you only talk to the Hillybilly next to the prize machine? You have to interact with the machine to trade whip for boomerang and vice versa.

Try repeating the pattern a few times. If it still doesn't work you may not have unlocked the melody. You need to reach the end of the ice waterfall maze on the same level.
---
Oh man, I'm with you on this one...
---
You still have to do all the jumps, and avoid the spikes.  Taco just tells you where to go.  It's still not easy, you just don't have to memorize the layout, which makes it easier.
---
yes.. now i have it..

Dude that's a trippy theory that makes no sense to my understanding of the lore.

I don't remember the last time Anet told us anything about the changes they're thinking about making and their reasoning before they've basically already committed to those changes.
---
This feels *so. Damn. Nice.*
---
Please keep doing this, Anet.
---
Eternity has without a doubt the best effects in a legendary up till now in my opinion. But considering you throw two legendaries into the toilet to get it has to be extraordinary.

As a weeb I want a dragon themed gs :p maybe combine them with a Phoenix themed one.

Zosin pretty much sum 95% of the basic:
---
What's important about Druid is when using your skills and how to chain them.
---
When on Staff:
---
- Be sure to have a target and the players you want to heal are between you and your target.
---
- Spam skills 2 on CD on the target players you wanna heal are.
---
- Keep skills 3 for spike heal and skills 5 for more heal with skills 3 (Blast into Water Field).
---
- Use your Healing skill for spike heal.
---
On Warhorn:

- Skill 5 is a blast Finisher and will heal if combo on Water Field.
---
In Celestial Avatar:
---
- Skill 4 for Might Stack and some passive heal.
---
- Skill 3 for spike Heal.
---
- Skill 2 for condition Removal. 
---
- Skill 2 + Skill 3 (Light Field with Blast) will provide 2 Condition removal and really nice heal.
---
- Use Skill 1 if you need more heal when 3 and 4 are on CD.
---
haha i guess it was one of the ways they could regulate the market..
---
they either could overshoot the requirement needed to farm it... OR they could have them harder to farm make the nodes more relevant again and less required to make the legendaries.
---
If you don't mind me asking, was there a reason for the bird mobs spawning and then not counting for rallying and such?  Seemed a good bit lopsided as a negative instab as opposed to having pros and cons, even if you could transfer the DoT effect to mobs.  Was especially apparent when stuff like We Bleed Fire or Afflicted meant they caused a lot more chaos.  Hoping you're doing well with your Minecraft job!
---
Is literally the first tree you see when you zone into zone 2. 
---
Hey, silly question - do you have an icon description somewhere? Im wondering what the leaping person means with the red/blue circle underneath. It shows up e.g. at the waterfall in W2Z1. Do you mean we are meant to leap between the edges and not just use the logs?
---
This is great. It makes a really refreshing change from all the action poses. I like the pensive pose, and the sense that he’s seen some shit.
---
Good collectathons put their items behind some hidden or tricky parts, encouraging exploration and overcoming challaneges. Hunting moons in Mario Oddessey is a great recent example.
---
dunno if you can do it but you can just remap jump and dodge to your mouse buttons which makes it very easy
---
that icon marking jump-dodge:-)

jesus...these are sweet rewards

And for the secound achievement you will get boomerang =P

arnt both 50% off till april?

Sorry. I just started getting deep into GW2 for the first time ever a few weeks ago, can someone explain to me what this is?
---
It's amazing! Too bad it's only available if you have played gw1, I made jormag's breath but it doesn't have the same feel to it.
---
i dont think he died; i think it was like when he was in crate at amnoon customs turned off; hes just going crazy in a complete void without solace of sleep... tbh seems worse than death... but opens up the option of bringing him back
---
I don’t really remember I’m afraid. The bird mobs were added in a bit late so it could have been oversight, or a design decision for balance.
---
No it seems to have ended yesterday
---
You can try to ask my magical crystal ball for 50g.
---
is there a trick to jumping up in world 1 zone 1? No matter how high up i look i always jump short
---
Like being locked in a coffin for eternity.
---
...That friggin sucks!
---
Tempest has to give up way too much as a healer to maintain might, and even then the hard reliance on blasting fire fields is concerning from a "plug and play" raid comp perspective when any other random class can be spamming non-fire fields over the course of a fight. No other healer can do 10-man might at all.
---
There are some hybrid DPS options like Deadeye and Herald, but these do not fill the healer spot in a party. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but it does require further adaptation. I also can't find an up to date benchmark for FfE Deadeye, and Herald's might generation relies on external boon extension for consistency and ramps unacceptably slowly.
---
Druid is honestly safe as long as 10-man might remains so hard to acquire. The main thing they need to do to address with respect to Druid is the accessibility of 10-man might. Increasing the target cap on Renegade's Heroic Command when traited is a good start. Herald should ramp faster. Deadeye should actually provide 25 stacks instead of 24. Tempest should be more consistent and have fewer tradeoffs. Engineer could use some love in this space as well since it provides basically zero critical boons when healing.
---
The path to "nerfing Druid" is giving other classes access to might. *Then* once there are realistic alternatives, you can look at toning down Druid in the context of that updated meta.
---
bless you

You can to unlock the secret song first in W2 Zone 1 to be able to play the song and have it work. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wooden_Whistle

Are Mystic Crystals and Philosopher stones worth buying with Baubles? 
---
For what its worth, shortbow druid is pretty fun. I realllllly like staff, so I use that as offhand, but usually once I've put down traps and used SB 2, most things have melted away. I've never played a condi build before now and it's really satisfying :)
---
&gt; story content is *also* designed for solo play
---
You forgott a word.
---
&gt;in the past there were many bugs for co-op which didn’t appear when solo
---
That's bugs, not design. That's a difference...
---
Make sure your character actually learned the secret song 123123.

So it turned out either I didn't have the note, or I "lost" it with the patch, but after interacting with the note log in W2Z1 i could summon the clouds. Prev. I had all the achievements and everything, so I think I should have have it, but who knows...
---
Congrats!  May I ask what were some of the final(latest) achievements you did to get you there?
---
I've actually managed to get a nice condi SB/staff going and it's working really nicely. 
---
yes I am on W2Z2 and god damn, no one tested this shit? the biggest design flow in history of this game, I am top mad
---
But we can already tell that it’s different because they are still communicating with us for more than just “here’s the patch notes” and then going to hid away for a few months

Don’t quote me on this but I want to say it started as an April Fools day joke years ago that just got incredible reception so it keeps coming back.

He is dreading going back into the SAB with all those jumps just to get anywhere ;)

Portal is used by organized group.

...waiting for content.

For full endgame you need both. For good part of end game - either one. Check dlgamer website for sales.
---
That's a hammer
---
Congratz, you can now quit this game with a light heart.
---
In my experience, dying during an adventure didn't actually stop the adventure (though I guess falling into a bottomless pit isn't actually dying now, unless it takes off your last heart).  When I fell into a pit, I was able to resume the adventure from the checkpoint.  That might be useful for skips sometimes to speed things along in certain adventures...
---
I bought Vanilla, but never got the Expansions.
---
I love this.
---
If you receive an unknown error - try again later after exepting the payment your account is most likely under restriction. Had the same issue and the only way to solve this was to contact the support via hp. Do not use the report function ingame. They cannot help you. The response of the support was that the restriction got lifted but they could not say why I received it in the first place. Had never any problems with payment or my bank account. Given by the amounts of reddit / forum posts it happens quite often.
---
Do you have an alternative route for [this location?](https://i.imgur.com/VPQGes0.jpg)
---
I have to dodge-jump onto a very slippery/clunky collision with no margin of error and it's driving me insane. I've spent at least 200 hundred lives on that part alone despite going through the rest fairly well.
---
Is there really no alternatives? :(
---
It's unfortunately not true. There are still plenty of mandatory dodge-jumps.

[Yep!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallant_Hammer_Skin)

It's rotational, it shows up on the gem store once a year (I waited last year to get it).

The normal run continues a bit right where you jump on those large logs and then join back right behind this platform:-)

Where is gourdon in 2-3 ? can't find it ... :(
---
Elonian rares might be messing with the ecto salvage rate. I assume they still only have a 50% chance to yield ectos
---
so i just started trying to obtain the warclaw mount, but i had no idea that you were not supposed to use to the items. I already used up 2 of the items, (emblem, and helmet). Did i just mess up my chances of getting the warclaw? ;-;
---
So you won't have any of the free to play restrictions and the game will pretty much be the same up till 80 where the expansions start to matter for elite specializations, stat choices, and raids. You'll also be missing the mastery system (gliding and mounts included), the revenant profession, story, access to living story, the new zones. 
---
Personally I'd say the expansions are a must if you are at end game and enjoying it or just want more content. Lots of meta events, maps, and content in them.
---
So a player who doesnt have much bag space is theoretically building up hundreds of unids without ever managing their inventory? And id this is the circumstance, that player can always split stacks. This type of neglectful player already has this issue with building up stacks of loot bags.
---
I got something below 3 minutes (don't remember the exact time) by getting the checkpoint before the last 2 coins and jumping in the void after the 6th coin to respawn at that checkpoint (the adventure doesn't end).
---
Oh yeah, it did. It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't add it to the branded pack. But who knows. Maybe there's hope for a branded beetle in the future. In any case, there are no new skins in this pack.
---
Collections unlock as soon as you get the item or skin unlocked and don't revert back. If part of the collection is done you're done with that item. Usually the items say "this item only has value as part of a collection" and you can safely get rid of them but since these give you a reward they just have the double click to consume text. So just use them when you get them for a small added bonus.
---
You blobbed a smaller amount of people and your group can't even do damage properly and are using fucking dps firebrand lmfaoooooo!
---
It's a festival that comes around every April.
---
An area is opened up in Rata Sum that you can get exclusive rewards from for doing festival activities. If you like jumping puzzles it's a really fun one.
---
I never said anything bad to them, I swear on God's life I never did. But you'd believe the Earth is flat so who am I to argue? I uninstalled the game, reached my  breaking point and I spent 100$/mo. So you should be more worried about players like me quitting rather than not believing us when people actually do harass us for stupid reasons.
---
Can't tell if this sarcasm :( lol
---
Don't worry they will support DX12 right after build templates
---
Exactly what I did :D
---
If they were smart, they could've invited me to the guild to be part of it. I had no guild at the time for WvW. I never intruded, I saw a squad and came to help them, that's literally all that happened but people are giving me shit for it.
---
 As a fungleberry main, I can confirm. 
---
DPS isn't the only metric available and can be biased by the player who play. IMO it's important to take the player into consideration when you build a team comp.
---
For numerical metric, you could use the average number of pull needed to down a boss with X or Y comp.
---
You could create a social analyse too, like ask how smooth this pull was, etc...
---
Higher Dps didnt mean most efficient way to kill the boss. Its the fastest but not the most efficent.
---
Uninstalled the game just now anyways after playing daily since November and spending 100$/mo. You should be worried since the game relies on players like me to keep it alive. I hit my breaking point.
---
He has left his diary at the start. The hint is "behind the 2 octopus", so on the tribulation trail behind the pagoda octopus.
---
A nice blue color on the hologram part of the outfit and mounts works well with guardian too. Fits the color of their abilities pretty well. Pair it with SAB weapons and you've got a cyber paladin. 
---
Fungleberries have been JimbleGames’ favorite child for ages, though. It’s time classes that actually require skill like Grumbleflaps and Borisnaps have a chance to actually shine in the meta instead of it just being Fungleberry v. Fungleberry for every competitive match.
---
So did Anet...
---
Anyone else have problems with Fabled Drumstick? I found the cloud no problem, play the correct notes (1-2-3, 1-2-3), but the jumping puzzle clouds don't appear ....

I got the first two World 2 items without issue, and I submitted a bug report, but figured I'd check here as well.

---
Profit meaning net gain obviously.  Value of the salvaged materials, on average, minus the cost of the salvage.
---
Getting more or less rares with upgrades does not change anything because the data is sorted by quality and whether or not they have upgrades.
---
Now if the salvage loot tables were changed then of course the data is invalidated.  
---
Looking at these data pools people like you create, I'm not interested in which kit is more often applicable, that's something each person can decide for themselves whether it's worth it or not.  I'm simply looking for which kit is the highest profit margin for a given category of gear.
---
All is vain.
---
Can confirm!
---
I play daily and still need icons and explanations.
---
Is he waiting for new content?
---
Sorry, but no it's not sarcasm. Mystic Crystals and Philosopher's Stone are otherwise bought with [Spirit Shard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_Shard). And those usually come easy once you have maxxed out your character. Plus Crystals and Stones are not need that often.
---
Cool, thanks

Loosmks dope, ill have to get it.

That's the Dream!

GW2 is mostly a single player game. Or "open world zerg" game. If you are searching for team- or guildcontent GW2 is the wrong game for you.

Look, if he likes it, he likes it, and if the agreed-upon price was some in-game gold, I don't think he lost out. I'd let it be.

We left because it was our end raid time. It's cute that you think you kicked our asses though lol. 16 of us vs 27 of you guys plus another SBI tag that you couldn't fight without all night. GG fam keep being terrible
---
Epi necro does nothing in T4 that will significantly help the team. If it could clear 5 adds with every epi, sure, it might be nice. However, epi currently wont kill the adds as 1) they are vets with a lot of HP and 2) you need to get a ton of condi on the boss to make epi really dangerous (but again, even if you have 25 of everything, it still wont kill a vet)...oh, and 3) even if you kill 5 adds every 15-ish seconds, that still wont really stop too much damage since there are like 20 adds. You can compare this to a class with higher burst and youll end up killing her faster, which means you have to deal with fewer mechanics, which means you have fewer chances to fail.
---
It's not necessarily real world money. Gold to gems exists and that's how I got my ICC way back when. The bee dog mail carrier is a nice bonus too!
---
Damn i was hoping so bad that at least blues could be salvaged immediately without too much of a loss. Bag wars is now just rescheduled instead of reduced...

Gw1 is just a low res copy. I was talking of one we use in pof story.

Screenshot of your character in their full flaming glory?
---
That's cute ! 
---
Sabetha and MO favor power classes? Unless I missed a recent change, they've always favored condi classes. Sab has a few, very long phases, and MO only has one phase, so you don't have to ramp up your condi damage from scratch much.
---
What are you, a skill clicker?
---
while the lack of a customizable hot bar for food and certain items is a factor that has been criticized since launch, the lack of a completely reorganizable skill bar is hardly an issue.
---
for one, slots are organized in specific ways (1-3 mainhand weapon, 4-5 offhand weapon, 6 heal, 7-9 utility skills, 0 elite skill). this is simply a categorization many other games - including wow - don't have.
---
further, due to characters being limited to a maximum of 17 available skills (including weapon swap - another feature unique to the game and relevant to this topic, and the special action hotkey), it is not unreasonable to give each skill slot a dedicated keybind, while other games - again including wow - are no strangers to having far more skills seem useful and slotable than can reasonably be mapped.
---
Well this is awkward. Imagine him holding a phone and sitting on a toilet. That was me, looking at the portrait.

Good pasta though.

scrapper doesn't give any where near the amount of stability that firebrand gives.
---
If you have a guild with a guild tavern, you can get an xp enhancement from the tavern in the guild hall. You also get Heart of Maguuma mastery points from doing HoT dailies when they come up. Doing metas give a really good amount of experience, both from completion and from doing things along the way. Also, map exploration does as well, just like with normal leveling.
---
I mean, you're technically not wrong.
---
Stop? No. No.
---
Time to make a Youtube video and share the secrets.
---
How can you tell the difference?
---
I didn't scroll as far up as I should have, so what? I never did say anything to warrant the harassment. You can ask the devs for my chat logs as proof if you're that small minded.
---
Gonna be a nightmare for Anet to figure this out on the back end lol. 
---
You literally intruded on organized play, and they asked you to leave multiple times, you should learn the culture of a community before screaming about it. GvG's aren't something anyone can join
---
I mean it was discovered on streams within about 2 mins of the patch.
---
to Cantha.
---
Been waiting for the exo suit outfit to be back in store but then again I got winter's presence a few months ago and it's not visible on the outfits...
---
Stop describing me
---
The skill needs to be reworked if they want to make it a support skill. Even in the bugged implementation that it was post-patch, it wasnt enough barrier to tank damage properly.
---
You are wrong. End of story.
---
Hell yeah
---
Yes, because deleting something is as difficult as fixing something. Not.
---
YES! 
---
Assuming computers work the same way in GW2 as they do in the real world, Blish was dead before we ever met him.

"Moving" data from one storage unit to another is an inaccurate colloquialism, no matter what form it comes in data doesn't actually occupy space, and cannot be moved.  Think of it like writing, when you say you're copying notes you're not actually copying them, you're creating them over again on a new sheet of paper.
---
Similarly when you "move" data from one storage unit to another, you're not actually moving anything, you're effectively recreating it in a second storage unit identical to the original, and then deleting the original to create the illusion that it was "copied" instead of recreated.
---
The saddest thing is, Taimi and Gorrick are more than intelligent enough to know that's how data works, they're just in complete and utter denial about the death of their brother and friend.
---
You are *never* gonna convince me that the dodge jump onto the pillar by the purple ninja in 2-2 is the best choice.
