ok dude i guess condi holo isn't meta for VG because you say so
---

---
power, condi holo and condi engi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kitless holos of all times
---
---
---
&gt; I'm aware that GS is meta for level 80 warriors
---
Is it though? I think GS is only played in Boonstrip Builds. The other Bannerslave Builds usually use Axe/Axe + Mace/Mace.
---
practicing your rotation on a golem won't help if mechanics go to shit
---
why can't i play a multiplayer game on my own
---
why can't you play solo games with others
---
New Fractal instability... at any given moment you get randomly attacked by a bunch of ravens. Bonus: sometimes, if your fractal has "afflicted" they'll give you random conditions, too, while they're biting your face off.
---
completely different genre of game, but whatever
---
"Hackers in pvp!"
---
"Just played Episode 5! Here are my theories!"
---
"Anet banned my account again! I'm quitting this game and here's my story!"
---
I want a jump puzzle raid with puzzle bosses and ecto gambling.
---
Interesting looks, but I just couldn't notice how different armor pieces were colored so differently on the Mesmer and the Guardian. There is a clear color theme on the others but not on these two. Why is that?
---
It's nice if the more recent PvE content has had an actual purpose for Scourges to exist. That said, the overwhelming majority of PoF content does not. I don't see a point to return to the game for a single fractal. I'm just completely done with the game. Power reaper was never something I enjoyed. 
---
Like you, I mained condition necro builds. Until they revise PvE content on a drastic scale, I'm not coming back. 
---
I adapted so many times, changed my build and gear so many times, all for nothing... I'm just completely burned out and uninterested in coming back to the game. 
---
For me, it's too little too late. 
---
Farming home instance can be a bit slow sometimes thats why I'm thinking of working on a (almost) unlimited quickness build to farm the home instance with, anyone know the best proffesion/class/build to achieve this?
---
&gt;Ever since wing 3 only the last boss in each wing can be considered challenging, yet people still want easy mode.
---
soulless horror and largos are not 'not challenging' bosses for 99% of groups 
---
When did they annoucne alliances? Seems like it's been forever ago.
---
I'd be down with Quaggan but they're pretty much like the Murlocpeople wanna play them but we wont get them
---
good communication makes a good community
---
no communication? dying community. community has nothing to care about. 
---
And also an entirely different genre. There's no real comparison here at all. This just feels like someone jerking themselves off by trying to feel like they have a superior taste in games.
---
I can't come up with one, but believe me that I'm trying.
---
Don't give them any ideas please T_T
---
Yeah. I'm not feeling too great about the game lately.
---
Finally stopped playing it as often I used to (and I played it a lot) once I realised I was more or less of a slave to daily fractals and that I was trying to clear raids for the sake of having raids cleared by the end of the week. Wasn't really a healthy reason to play. And I'm bored of most open world stuff as well. So... I have little reason to play now, and on top of that the game's future feels very uncertain to boot. 
---
oof
---
I'm sorry heh.  
---
I'll upvote you!

I don't think the people at the casino are that bleak. They probably think that the mysterious foreign "commander" will fail, but someone else will kill Kralkatorrik. 
---
I wouldn't call what we got with HoT a ton of sylvari lore. We got one huge thing that was promptly made irrelevant, and we never got anything remotely related to the aftermath since.
---
You've averaged about 6 hours a day playing? Nice job getting the legendary.  (1k hours over 707 days - I've gone for 3 full sets of ascended armour/weapons instead)
---
Can't stop laughing =))
---
I commented on the wrong comment
---
I forgot about SH and I meant w3 included. I killed largos on my first try because we just used mirages, nothing fascinating about that fight. Pugs aren't a good indicator of difficulty level since most of them don't even know what they are doing with their class.
---
W1 and w2 have perfect variety of boss difficulty. Beginners can easily kill cairn, mo and samarog, but plenty of them will struggle on gorse. I've also seen trio fail more often than those 3 together, even in exp groups.
---
&gt; It's nice if the more recent PvE content has had an actual purpose for Scourges to exist. 
---
Necros are actually at a good place right now. Support Scourge are accepted in fractals and popular as a second healer in raids. I hear you about changing builds, when I still main necro every balance patch felt like heading towards the gallows. 
---
&gt; Power reaper was never something I enjoyed.
---
That's what I thought too, then I geared one after hearing good things about the buffs and dare I say I like it more than playing condi builds.  
---
The new instabilities made boon corruption and also epidemic more important than ever. It made me feel like playing a scourge for fractals. But I already have 5 fractal toons and not enthusiastic about learning the rotations for a 6th heh. For now I really enjoy playing a Minion Master for soloing legendary collections. Yesterday I soloed a Champion mob in HoT! That was so fun :)
---
&gt; I'm just completely burned out 
---
Fair enough. Just wanted to update your info on the current state of necros. 
---
Yep! I've also completed 2 1/2 full ascended sets (shout out to my bank account). I crafted the Leg completely from farming in game but my first Ascended was 1/2 paid for with the almighty credit cardo.
---
haha it's all good! 
---
Then just git gud like everyone else and stop whining? 
---
If it had a sub fee at launch I wouldn't have bought it.
---
If it got a sub fee 6 years down the line I would be extremely angry.
---
you make it sound like a problem
---
Wing 1-3 (and 4 too) need the following masteries:
---
* Gliding: tier 6 (necessary)
---
* Itzel: tier 1 (necessary, otherwise you would need a mesmerportal after sloth), 6 (recommended - adrenal and speed mushrooms at wing 1)
---
* Nuhoch: tier 4 (recommended - you won't see the saboteurs at trio without it, depends on the group if you as dps have to cc them)
---
* Raids: tier 3 (necessary\*), tier 4 (recommended)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*As the raid-masteries can only be unlocked by killing a raid-boss, not every boss needs it - tier 2 is needed for sabetha (cannons) and trio, tier 3 for matthias and the cave at escort and tier 4 to use the towers at escort and for better suvivability at xera and tc.
---
Hope I didn't forget anything.
---
Assuming they aren't just shitposting, it's possible those people are among those who generally dislike how human culture has been portrayed in GW2. I know there are still a few people who see Balthazar's betrayal as an unforgivable character assassination, given his portrayal in GW1. That could possibly be the reason behind it, idk.
---
Pritty sure that would kill mirage.  People really don't know how to suggest balance changes without a sledge hammer.
---
and now try to find a raid guild that does thier weekly clear from 4 am till 6 am (2 days a week). wish it was so easy.
---
Shortbow 2 can't be placed directly underneath your target in order to get the reactive usage of 2. Aka, exploding #2.
---
You can fire it wherever you want, as long as you follow up with an immediate double tap of 2 in order to explode it.
---
I was using SB2 explosion to catch his kite. He was using no-port spots to deny my usage of Sword followup so SB was my only option in this case. If you watch, the SB2 was exploded *every time* and he actually dodges 2 of them / invulns one of them.
---
Ask Sindrener if you don't believe me about SB2.
---
May Raven bless you with vision to see and the wisdom to understand
---
That would certainly help. They seem to have forgotten that Kralk should also have Mord's powers to control sylvari as well.
---
Look who's trolling now... gonna try to insult my wife and kids next and how they spend their time? If anything you are throwing shots at yourself at this point. Do you not realize that you are also on the same platform talking shit about someone else using the platform? How interesting. Instead let's talk about something relevant, the fact that I still dabble in guildwars waiting for a change of direction in game design, or that they are working on glaring issues instead doing my best to design clickbait posts like you, harassing users who think your content is trash and not even a decent meme. 
---
How stupid does one need to be before they realize they are whining about someone complaining. You may be the first person on reddit I have ever blocked. 
---
Let me guess another TLDR response, how literate of you.
---
Would love a permanent ascalonian tonic. Sadly even the non-permanent ones got nerfed a while back and aren't combat tonics anymore.
---
Largos or bust.
---
Full knights is not a good choice for the most part. Toughness as the primary attribute and no ferocity really hurts one's damage. 
---
I know this sub is a fan of "zerkers or nothing" and usually will frown on anything else, but if someone wants to be a bit tankier either mix half zerkers with half valk/knights depending whether you need crit or ferocity more or run full marauder's. Marauder armor is really not a bad combo of extra survivability and most of the damage of zerkers. 
---
Well they did fix the bagpack glitch sooo maybe???
---
100% right, but i guess a lot of people got used to running full damage builds and staying alive because of healers/supports.
---
We killed t4 Mai without a healer (we did have chrono) in a pug, didnt require titles or whatever. Took 2 tries. People just need to realize it's not about damage, it's about staying alive.
---
Well they are still working on T4 Fractals and raids, just not at the speed you'd like them too. Why should they announce they're not working on something they're working on. They have a team for Raids/Fractals. It's a small team. They release stuff as it's ready. What they won't give you is a date for the next one or a schedule. My guess is because it's not a priority. 
---
I'm guessing the more a specific content is played, the more people who play it the more likely it will become a focus. That's what happened with Guild Wars 1. It started as a PvP game, focused on that, but there were a whole lot of people who were playing the game as a PvE game and gradually, over years, that's what it started becoming. 
---
Anet isn't making more raid difficulties. They're not stopping raids, at least not now. They have a raid team. So what is it you want to know specifically. If you want to know if this game is going to get lots of raids fast, or if it will be focused on that content, I think the answer is a pretty clear no.
---
I just want to go to Cantha...
---
Lol a lot of classes beat warrior in disengage what does that even mean? If the thief has used his shadowstep in the fight, which they will if they fight for a meaningful amount of time. After shadowstep is down they are easily caught. Especially with 2 1200 range rocket boot leaps, super speed, perma swiftness, and ranged projectiles. A well played thief is a thief who chooses not to engage on fights they know they won't win in the first place. 
---
Umm... Kratos?!? That you?
---
Tfw yu drink Elixir X and turn into Tornado, so yu whirl away in shame dreaming of being a Hulk. 
---
Holy shit i stopped playing over a year ago and theyre still not done? I already considered gw2 a  dead game but the fact that theyre not even producing content they promised that long ago confirms theres no hope for it ever coming back lol, anyone still defending them is delusional
---
Except that they never said there wouldn't be an expansion, just that season 5 will follow season 4. So maybe the expansion isn't close to ready, and they wanted more time on it, or maybe it was the plan all along. Anet has not said there's be no more expansions only not one directly after Season 4. 
---
Most games, when they're flagging and not doing well add an expansion to bring people back, even games doing much worse than this one. This game isn't doing bad enough yet to worry about it. Just take a look at the industry. Many games less popular than this come out with fairly regular expansions just to keep people playing and making the money they're making.
---
that icy tundra place
---
They only really need to reference it in an off hand comment after the defeat stings a bit less
---
Might want to scroll up and double check, because I didn't create this post. If you're not drunk, you may be having a stroke or a dissociative event. In either case you should probably seek medical attention.
---
Laughed
---
I use a shortbow Daredevil (there are some shadowstep shortcuts). Glyph of Industry for pick and axe, and a leather glyph for Consortium  Sickle. The quickness utility is enough to cover Sickle use even for guild nodes gathering. 
---
thx I will check it out
---
Though the Industry glyph Is mighty expensive... 
---
(Got one from the Fire elementals axe I bought worth!)
---
U can solo both expansions just fine. The difference is now u need to actually start to play the game instead of pressing one. What do i mean by that.
---
1) Learn your enemies abilities through practice.HoT enemies can be nasty so u have to adapt your tactics.For example smokescales. They seem too hard at first but all uou need is disables. One stun/daze and u can burst them in a sec.Others require blocks or reflects or simply go ranged if it gets too hard.
---
2) Learn to time your dodges.No matter how tanky you are or how much dmg mitigation u have dodge is the most basic thing to keep you alive.In base game u never had to dodge a thing. Its different in HoT.
---
3) Play a class/build/spec that helps with what specifically u wanna do.Switch up yor traits accordingly. U will find that with a little tweak in traits you can do open world really ez. For example ele. Base ele and weaver are crap for open world.They lack self buffing and have no defenses. Tempest FA with fire has good fmg but squishy af. Now take d/d or s/d or d/w tempest switch fire to earth and u have permanent fury/protection and a ton of healing by sacrificing a bit of dmg. U can even solo champion HP with this build,even though there are better classes for doing that. This is just a simple example. There are builds in this game that can solo anything and even make HoT seem like a walk in the park.
---
To conclude u just have to get more experienced at the game y know....take your gameplay up a notch and start paying attention to the things that u took gor granted b4. 
---
It's not that HoT is hard or unsoloable , it's that core game is so ridiculously easy that it spoils you,makes you think spamming one and running random crappy builds with no synergy or purpose should be enough to clear all open world/story content without any effort.

You used the links from the arcdps page? Give it a try again. I once had a similar issue and a reinstall of the links from the page made it work. 
---
awwww... there's the f-bomb. I knew it had to be coming soon since you were running out of other words.
---
Yeah I used to only run one Glyph of Industry (got it for free during glyph update). But the mismatch timing of quickness used for mining and harvesting got to me after many months. Bought the Firestorm axe for the glyph, improved my QoL so much. No regrets :)
---
My partner and I started GW2 a bit over a year ago. After playing the free version for a week or so, we both invested in the expansions and haven’t looked back!  Now we are high levels and love helping others too. The community is very friendly in general. When you’re running around doing events, killing bosses, etc., you’ll often find others who will jump in and help you even if you haven’t asked yet. On the other hand, if you do want to ask for help on a specific boss/event/achievement, they’ll jump in and help too! Most of the time, all you need to do is ask in map chat. 
---
I would highly recommend the expansions. GW2 has some of the best lore and voice acting I’ve ever seen and heard. The characters get you attached and it’s very fun to fight bosses and dragons alongside them. There is so much to do! 
---
As much as free to play has plenty to explore, you won’t regret upgrading. Welcome to gw2 :) 
---
Yeah it was the link from the website, then i started testing different versions/SP's of some redistributables still without success, didnt wanna open a thread about it but i did literally everything i could find and didnt work this time.
---
Hey, awesome! Glad it helps :D
---
Just completed this for the diving point and oh boy this is literally the worst thing anet 
---
Replace Fortnite and apex with WvW and PvP and it works
---
I mean I understood tangled depths a little hard for some people (given I’m the guy who plays on the highest difficulty in single player games) all that happened their was that they over nerfed it but it’s still easily fixable 
---
^ apparently the op likes zooming in and looking at all the maps I guess 
---
Guessing you haven’t played Sense ember bay came out, that was a bug when it did happen and anet sense fixed it 
---
Having recently doubled my commute, right there man, right there.
---
Season 3 has a lot of useful gear if you want to farm it. The maps are generally not very active, but there's not a whole lot you can't solo on several of the maps.
---
That said, it's mostly trinkets with one map having an ascended aquabreather.
---
Tengu no more no less! :)
---
Yes, if you are strong enough to survive the initial attack, most just stealth and run like a mofo.
---
People keep saying they promised the legendaries on release but they never did. They said pretty early on before the expac launched that it will come with just 3 at the start and others will release later.
---
The problem occurred when they decided that they would stop releasing them "indefinitely", which made many players think it just wasn't going to happen at all. They then brought them back but with just 1 per living world episode, which many consider quite slow (at the very least expected them all released before PoF). I do think that would have been an okay model to begin with as an ongoing thing, but it's definitely not what people have been lead to think early on and really fell short.
---
I see groups in season 3 maps all the time, I wouldn't say they're dead. The maps were the whole draw for me, gear was a minor concern for me.
---
The maps are fun! I totally thought they made season 3 worth it.
---
There may be a kind whale on here who'd be willing to get you Heart of Thorns. It's not terribly expensive anymore, but I can understand if you're not in a financial situation where you can get it. 
---
Ascended viper gear isn't too difficult to pay your way through; a few Auric Basin meta events should get you all the aurillium you need for the inscription and insignia recipes.
---

Truth. Even though GW2 is super stale, you think of all the time you invested in the game /age &lt;/3

Achievements are just extra hassle that add artificial replayability to the content.  When I'm playing a story episode unless an achievement adds extra lore, narrative, storytelling or a nifty title I'm not interested.  I don't want to spend an extra 3-5 hours on grinding achievements that vary in scope, design, difficulty and frustration.  Achievements are great value for completionists, but for most everyone else one look at those meta-achievement panels makes the game look like a 9-5 job.  
---
Positive reinforcement, 
---
There are players out there who spend many hours practicing rotations, study and learn every detail and also have semi static groups or fully static groups. 
---
Other players are really talented. 
---
For these types of players this type of painful content is their moment to shine. And a subset of these players are very very vocal that all content should be tailored for them. 
---
Other of these dedicated or talented players are not vocal and are really nice people to share a game with.  
---
Who gets heard? The very vocal ones that lavish praise on anet  for painful content that allows them to shine.  
---
Anet hears an abundance of praise for painful content. 
---
The main criticism encouraged in reddit is that there is a lack of content and that content is too easy or too boring.  
---
My criticism which I know is shared in game, although not in reddit, is that fractals were medium difficulty content that could be done by any pug group regardless of composition with a modicum of effort and strategy. 
---
In my opinion if a fractal requires a specific composition, it is not medium content, it’s a raid, not a fractal. A slightly shorter raid. 
---
It stops being a casual friendly game that can be shared easily in some content by some guilds that are composed of casual family members. 
---
Raids should be elite content mainly, and fractals medium content mainly. 
---
Just my opinion, doesn’t have to be everybody’s. 
---
I recall being the last player alive and finishing thaumanova, now if you are the last player alive you get punished by increasing instabilities for each player that dies.  That is not much fun in a pug group. 
---
What I did was getting the 1600 gems pack and buying seasons 3 and 4 instead. Season 2 can be played through for free if you have a friend who has it. You won't get the rewards I think (please someone correct me here if applicable) but you get to experience the story at least.
---
Hey in a livestream, a dev said that it was simply so he stood apart from the others. Since he was only going to be around for a short time, they didnt want us to mistake him for Aurene/Glint etc at any point. No lore connection sadly, as far as i'm aware. 
---
Yeah you are right, it's more than 2 hours. Doing the Kourna meta to not get progress toward the achievement for doing the Kourna meta ten times took much longer than 2 hours. Did they ever fix that? Guess we will never know.
---
I feel it's actually the other way, people trying to give feedback and point the flaws of the game and its current state, and then people coming and "LOL MY BOYFRIEND DRAW A FURRY CHARR YOU LIKE IT?! LOOK IT HAS ABS!"
---
This entire response basically amounts to a toddler saying, "no u" to end an argument. You just say, "No absolutely not" with no reasoning and then literally say,"Actually thats what you do" like a child, also with no supportive reasoning. Show some adult level of how logic and reason works rather than this. The absolute level of nothing in relation to the game or Mordremoth is also still a valid point that you have not addressed even after this amount of time, it's baffling.
---
&gt;Also am i not a high end fractal player if i don't agree with you? 
---
I dunno why you're trying to turn this into a personal attack. I literally don't give a shit what you do on a daily basis.
---
&gt;Like, check CMs. A CM without instas would be a walk in the park. T4s without instas would be stack and spank.
---
And I'm saying that the current instabilities make them an annoying walk in the park. It doesn't make them difficult.
---
Buying from tp is cheapest.
---
You skipped the achievement for doing the Kourna meta 10 times. Ignoring the fact and it was bugged and didn't give you any progress, imagine all the hours you can sink in this game achievement hunting!
---
The wiki should have the TP price on it,
---
Or check GW2 efficiency
---
Is getting comm tag worth it? And what is the cheapest way to get berserker asc gear and weapons.
---
Deservedly so! 
---
i'd say that out of your priorities try to make the comm tag the least important one. sure having a tag helps if you want to set up your own raiding groups, but raid squads CAN be created without one so it is not 100% necessary. also you can always try to join one of the several raid training discord servers that exist to start getting your feet wet.
---
continuing to regularly do fractals (doing the higher levels as you get more asc gear+agony) will also help you get your asc gear since they drop fairly frequently from daily chests, and are also a nice source of ingame gold to get the last pieces you miss
---
Huh I'm pretty new, I thought this game had fishing?  When an MMO has a cool fishing system, I know it's quality shit. ;-)
---
Apparently in deimos, the devs didn't intend for a hand kiter. So they had planned for a more chaotic movement oriented fight.
---
And more choices on weapons!
---
Nostalgia damn!
---
I agree with him to be honest
---
I'd like at least, "we've finished testing the scripting for w7 and it will be ready for release eith ep6 after voice work is complete. Dont expect the ring to ship with it though, we are bundling that with w7 which is slated for release in ls5. In the meantime, we've already started preproduction on the next fractal. Thanks for all of the sirens reef feedback, we've heard you."
---
No kidding, they manage to come off as more arrogant than the asura, and the asura at least can be funny in their cockiness, the kodan are just irritatingly condescending.
---
None of the gods really showed up directly except in special cases, but you learn a lot about them and there's a lot more cultural influence from them.
---
Balthazar was an honorable god who stood to encourage humanity that the world would someday belong to them. PvP was run on the Battle Isles, run by the Zaishen, who all worshipped Balthazar. It could be argued that PvP was all about strengthening humanity for the battles ahead.
---
Other than that, Balthazar was the one who forged the chains that bound Abaddon, and Balthazar was waging war against his shadowy and conniving half-brother, Menzies.
---
So, like, everything painted Balthazar as this noble, reliable, honor-bound titan of a god who wanted the best for his people.
---
What is the difference between "artificial replayability", as you call it, and the replayability of content that is so often desired from this subreddit? I often see "old" dungeons and HoT metas cited as examples of this "good" replayabilty. Is it just the higher gold/hour rate that helps to fill up a virtual currency faster? Are HoT metas so much more fun than the metas on LW maps? Was speed running the same dungeon paths every day really the pinnacle of replayability? I don't see much of a difference honestly, in all cases you do the same content over and over again. You fill up collections with skins or raise your imaginary bank balance to get a dopamin kick.
---
Obviously my view of the game is colored by my preferences, what sort of comment is that? I prefer instanced dungeons and guild content for that matter, both of which anet has specifically said they will no longer be supporting. It hurts, but I appreciated the honesty. I'm sticking around for the final episode of this season, hoping they've been waiting for it to wrap up before announcing something. If it really is just gemstore updates and single player story content from here on out, I'll just move on.
---
Anet has the numbers, I do not. I cant imagine the current release schedule of lw is going to support the game for much longer, but anet made the decision to abandon dungeons and guilds in favor of lw content, so it was probably a sound financial decision in the companies best interest. 
---
I'm pretty sure my current state isn't WvW viable considering I just get smashed in PVP when I do it for the dailies. It will likely be a *lot* of suffering to reach the end of that track once, never mind three times.
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** Pixel5015! ^(hug)
---
That's one reason why I keep my revive orbs in a shared inventory slot.
---
&gt; rehashing GW1
---
I don't think it's all purely to pander to nostalgia. It's just, that's the lore they built up and have around to play with. It's probably easier than coming up with something totally new. The fact that people love nostalgia is just a bonus.
---
&gt; the Mists
---
I love a lot of the ideas you put forth there. The Mists are definitely a big deal but I can see how people wouldn't be quite as invested since the Mists aren't really a place we can linger. It's more of a plot vessel.
---
But yeah, you mentioned the birth of stars relating to the Elder Dragon cycle. That's why I was a bit disappointed that Ancient Jotun was one of the least popular races. I love ancient races and all those pre-human mysteries.
---
I do hope, eventually, we will dive into the *really* old lore, from long before humanity arrived. I imagine we'd have to travel to parts of the world never before seen in order to tell that story, though.
---
I hope that's vaguely on ANet's radar for the distant future, at least.
---
You'll want Season 2 if you are going after achievements though.
---
Oh don't worry at all...I play a relatively tank build, quite high concentration and follow zergs as a boonmancer. Armour up with givers gear and you'll be fine. It's quite rare I engage in direct combat because it's not a power build. Stick on commander, get discord to hear the calls and have a blast. 
---
The only karma that is salty and bitter is found exclusively in pve and www maps. 😂
---
Season 3 for Aurora for sure.
---
I read that as "I prefer to see your girlfriend's quaggans" for some reason.
---
After having to do that for Astralaria, I gotta say it's a lot less difficult than I dreaded it being.
---
Polar Vortex: Delay WvW update.

The man doesn't know...

The birbs are out for blood.

I'll accept time travel in this game if it's not Asuran technology-based  and is instead Mesmer-based via Queen Jennah unlocking Chronomancer. 
---
&gt; kill kralk when he was weak enough?
---
but wouldnt that destroy the world? wasnt it a whole plot thing earlier that we couldnt kill more dragons or the world would die basically. with aurene not being able to take over as elder dragon when kralk dies we cant kill him anymore if we want the world to not die?
---
Thanks, my point exactly.

That's interesting. When I read the lore on him, I got the impression he was a little unstable. The first red flag I saw was when he arrived on Tyria carrying the severed head of his father. Between that and his brother Menzies, it sounds like Abaddon didn't have the best situation at home.
---
There's an obvious bias.. or.. well.. at least a large difference between the options one can choose between, say,  'How interested are you in exploring the Unending Ocean?' and 'How satisfied are you with our current coverage of Orr?'.
---
I'm not saying that's bias at play, but I do wonder why you opted to suddenly use a different format when the basic question is the same (i.e.: do you want to see more of X). Just the fact that in the former you start with the most negative option (towards a desire for more of X) whereas with the latter you start with the more positive option makes it look markedly different to me. 
---
I know, I know, one set is for regions we have already set foot in in GuildWars2 and one set is for those we haven't, but does that warrent such a difference? Also notable is the second-most positive question is.. not *that* positive*.* Intrigued but hesitant?• Of course it's not even the same within sets as Cantha's option sounds less.. tentative.
---
\*It's not that I object to the formulation per sé, but rather the formulation when compared to the others you've used.
---
Anyway, formulating poll questions and answers is difficult. I could go on dissecting, but it's not really necessary, is it? Most important thing is that I love the idea of your poll and the fact you made it in the first place. For that, you have my thanks. :o)
---
This still works! Just did it this week for the Diving Spot, after dying on the way down :(
---
Do we know anything about these other lands from the books or games?
---
somewhere has to be a line that ensures a balance between challange and fun. you simply cant adjust the difficulty to the very lowest denominator out there.
---
There is no higher level gear in GW. The bests gear in core game ist still the best in the xpacks
---
&gt;Do the heart the first time, it turns gold and xp, as they do now. Thereafter, it's blue (or purple or whatever) showing that it's been done once, but ready to be done again 🤔
---
Erm, there is that infinity symbol on the heart after you done it the first time...
---
The only time I ever used one was to get that dive.
---
"other teams involved", you mean the Janitor? They even admitted in the stream that their WvW team has not the greatest number of devs. Simplified: The Janitor, and no one else.
---
Hey that's my guild
---
That's just simply a lie!
---
Mamcompletion status does not reset on daily restet. once you done a heart, it's done
---
&gt;(except for slippery slope)  
---
  
---
Fuck off. Slippery Slope is the best instability :)
---
Why is the thief bitching about the mesmer not dying when he's just autoattacking with shortbow?
---
Apex is amazing. I never had so much fun in a game before. Like seriously. 
---
I don't remember who it was but there was a mesmer that ressed and portet me up a few times till I made it. so fucking annoying to jump through the texture and hope to not hit a pipe. and the jumppads that throw you anywhere if you are unlucky.
---
most sardistic part of the game.
---
and you have to go there for bolt too...
---
only good thing you can skip most of it with the jump gun you can buy for a few coppers. unfortunately not the most shitty part at the end...
---
There should be a separate option for Heart of Maguuma. Maguuma Jungle is very different from Heart of Maguuma.
---
In the upper left corner of your screen you should see a row of icons.  One of them is that of a Lion.  That's the market window.  You can buy gems, sell gems, and trade on the auction house.  Just use the search filters to narrow down each piece of gear based on level and rarity type.  When you see something you like, click on it, buy it, it gets delivered to your mailbox.
---
Imagine knowing nothing about video game development, and yet still posting this.
---
Tbh towards the last few we weren’t really getting any information and a majority of the questions answered was shitty fluff like “which quaggan is your favorite”. I don’t want to have to designate a time for them to be upfront with us regaywjere this game is going. 
---
But its totally clear that these two options are different because we already have four Orr maps but not a single Unending Ocean map. 
---
&gt; Yes, sometimes it wasn't much, but it was the best way of communication past HoT.
---
For us? Yes. For them? Too many uncomfortable questions that get visibly ignored with no possible way to bury or delete them.
---
He wrote he do not own HoT and there for can not make viper
---
I mean there really isn't a reason for Canach to bet against the commander. If the commander loses, he knows Tyria is basically doomed
---
When you see things like this you start to wonder if maybe Primordus isn't so bad after all.
---
And of course you get downvoted for speaking the truth. Other game subreddits would have upvoted this but not the innocent casuals you find here lmao
---
You do not need a tag to create a squad and in the raids you can use squad marks instead.
---
In the end a com tag is ofc something that can be useful for you but it is nothing you should focus on when you do not even have gear yet. So gear first then you can go for a com tag.
---
Someone please correct me if I’m wrong but can you even access raids without an expansion pack? 
---
This poll is great and reading the results was very interesting. Thank you for making it!
---
The guy ask about gear and a com tag in which nothing have anything to do with salvage. Maybe stick to the topic?
---
I didn't think a 'jungle' theme expac was something I would be into. Anet won me over with the oppressive, dark, fight-for-survival environment.
---
I sighed when it was announced a 'desert' theme expac was next. I've played enough desert zones in games to know what to expect! I wasn't wowed with Amnoon but I was blown away by what followed - highlands, riverlands, torrential rains, sulfurous and branded wastes... they won me over again, and I ate my words.
---
I guess what I'm saying is that wherever Anet goes next I have faith that they'll do it creatively. If I had to pick, there's really nothing I'd like to see more than Kaineng City in GW2! I'll be on board with whatever flavor is next, though.
---
dont worry, ull learn the support class during level up
---
also in gw2 any class can be damage dealer but may also have a build that is more team orientated
---
All professions can do that. Play the one that looks cool :)
---
I like they moved AMAs to forums because this way they proved how useless their own platform is.
---
Anything with snow coverage. I like Desert and Jungle the least.
---
Unsure which route you use, but this is the route I usually follow: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72zceh/gw2_pof_26_hphearo_point_run_guid/
---
Just in case you wanted to check your route vs another. Good luck on the markers. 
---
also, stab is stacking in charges, not in duration.
---
gaile, whats your most favorite quaggan color?  
---
^^^^^^the bait is set.
---
if you have a free account i would say that the top dps that you can get with only the core game is probably guardian, but it is pretty much a tie with warrior, thief, elementalist and engineer the others can do dmg as well but the highest you will get without any expac is probably guardian. 
---
Pvp is diferrent you cant only rely on pure dmg to win (at least not on solo queueing, but thats may be only me) in pvp with only the free account i would defenetily play thief or enginner.
---
 
---
but dont worrie too much about that all classes can do pretty much everything in gw2, go with the one that you like the most.
---
While they didn't answer all the questions people might want, let's not get angry over stuff that didn't even happen. Nothing close to the "majority" of questions were that kind of fluff.
---
i raid on an almost daily basis. even if i got all my weekly kills i repeat bosses because guildies need help, i want to train other builds, etc.
---
so i think i know what difficult and challenging content looks like. and i enjoy it - otherwise i wouldnt repeat it without getting anything out of it, except some trashy green loot bags.
---
i also used to run T4 and sometimes CM fractals on a daily basis. but my motivation to do them started dropping with the AoE clutter the last couple of fractals were. and the new instabs are the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
So.... we gonna travel back in time when Kralk is still an egg, and run him over with a ~~van~~ roller beetle?•_•
---
Looks more familiar in grayscale, right?
---
the last communication we got on that is that the next raid will be shipped with next episode and season 4 will have a full set of legendary trinkets when its done. If nothing changed on that front, why would they need to tell us?
---
Hello!
---
I have currently boosted my character to 80 and was wondering if i needed to complete the Heart of Thorns story to unlock important game play or can i skip to Path of Fire? I'm not really following the story line so that doesn't bother me.
---
I sleep from 19:00 (sometime 20:00) to 04:00 am daily :P
---
No worries, Taimi's clock already stopped, what worse could happen?
---
And maybe that will let us save Sieran...
---
Yes bring it back I miss people asking questions about nothing to do with the release even though Z or MO said in the introduction post thats the AMA would only answer questions about the release. I also miss people bitching and moaning that their questions didn't get answered as if the devs can answer everyones question. I agree bring it back to reddit because the structure was better here but until the reddit can accept that its only about the release, that the devs can't answer everything and that there are things they can't answer.
---
I like having options instead of being shoehorned into the whole, "... But achievements are content too," arguments.  I don't really care about farming anymore truth be told.  I just want some new, unique and fun experiences that are more than some dynamic checklist.  Whether we're talking mini dungeons, jumping puzzles or collections and scavenger hunts that don't drive me bankrupt.  
---
Achievements don't really give me that magical dopamine experience.  Most people eople I know that have 30k+ AP do them to say they've done them or stay busy rather than because they actually enjoy them.  It's not a rabbit hole interested in when I play or watch different games, movies or shows. 
---
Yes communication, i just want gw1 missions in gw2 pls!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Try boonbeast, way more powerful. 
---
Bot just a costumet, but a Creative partner.
---
Dude, dont be such a wanker
---
If you care for lore and following the story, go for all seasons, and s3 maps are still active but depends of time of a day, some are more active like berries farming, some or less,but still so far they are the best place to farm ascended trinkets, even if you just collect "map currency" daily, and like ppl said S2 so good for Tyria masteries, if you can afford go for both seasons.
---
Well they already prepped maintenance mode with the 20-year achievements on all holidays, luck sink is in, ecto and mat sink is in (Zephyrite-Festival), automated tournaments etc.
---
We can only hope for one last hurra (Cantha) before we go full skeleton crew.
---
I just hope there is enough fire and spirit left in the crew (and in us players if I look at the comments sometimes to be honest) to keep the vision for the game up to standard (which is, by comparison, a high standard).
---
I think I understand joke you wanted to make, but it's poor one, and you seem a bit biased.
---
Play 1st episode of HoT story to unlock Gliders, and 1st story of HoT to unlock Raptor mounts. 
---
Been there
---
okay :) thanks!
---
The only "gameplay" you would miss out by skipping HoT would be gliding, but that is unlocked at the beginning of the first map, like mounts i PoF.
---
&gt; There wont be another expansion. There wont be anymore elite specs.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This statement is pretty disingenuous.
---
This is kind of the point of the whole thread. Without any kind of knowledge about what is actually happening other than vague statements about "going straight into season five" and "living world containing things that might usually be in an expansion" we have no idea what's going on so people just make up random things like that and promote it as truth.
---
They could well release a new set of elite specs with season five, but does that mean they could possibly use them as a source of micro-transaction income, because let's face it, they are 50% of the reason we even bought HoT and PoF. If they are giving up on expansions or putting them on hiatus, they must have another plan for revenue.
---
Again, without knowing anything other than vague vapid statements, you can jump to any conclusion.
---
Let me spell out exactly what is coming to the game in the following years:
---
1. Communications will remain as silent as it is now forever, until the studio closes.
---
2. Season 5 will continue season 4.
---
3. Expansion 3 will continue season 5.
---
4. PvP and WvW will get one small update per year.
---
5. After expansion 3, the game will repeat the shti cycle it is experiencing right now.
---
That's it.
---
He was already super unstable in GW1 but people choose to ignore that because they dislike any form of change.
---
Yes
---
*A FEMALE developer
---
I also miss AMA's when devs answer what their favorite Quaggan is while ignoring question that concern the players since day one.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking yeah!
---
Dude even has a book to check on what today's dailies are.
---
At least you can't get banned from the game here.
---
The last few there were posts trying to control the conversation before the AMA’s effectively saying these are the only question they wanted it was becoming hostile towards the devs and other members of the community. It didn’t take into account that the ama was mostly to do with the new episode, that the relevant devs may not be present, it ignored the fact that fluff takes devs 2 seconds to answer over more complex questions which only specific devs could answer, which have to be careful worded as to not become false promises or reveal info about stuff they can’t talk about or had been answered before or people completely ignored the answers and would say “but what if” when they didn’t like the answer. I remember dev explained why we don’t have dyeable weapons and people kept pestering her about getting it completely ignoring the fact she said it will never happen because it was a design choice that effected the way they coded them and the trading post.
---
And 2 devs were fired because of interactions with community, I wouldn’t want to risk my job over an interaction on the internet if it isn’t my job to talk to the playerbase.
---
Wow you're touchy
---
I guess I can consider myself lucky with 8-9h work a day, overall 1h per day to get to work and home. Just hope it's worth it for you guys.
---
So much rando asshattery in one comment.
---
I agree. Games can be easy to learn but has a high skill ceiling.
---
But the base content is easy while expansions are difficult is kinda ok imo. The base content would be enough tutorial for players. But if people just use 80 level boost straight away, they will struggle.
---
No, the game fucking sucks right now. But I know Gaile personally and she is the warmest person I know. Fuck you and everyone else that insults her. She doesn't have any say in how the game is directed or what information she can reveal on the game. She is just here for the community.
---
Hope much is a safe boon duration?
---
The shiro skill does not apply quickness anymore. Instead it strikes the enemy an additional time for each of your attacks, internal cooldown 0.25 seconds. Superspeed is still applied.
---
they are probably being overly cautious because of the crazy one
---
no reddit witch hunted an innocent dev defending herself against a sexist pig 
---
/s
---
Minion Mancer Reaper is one of the best open world PvE classes and will be perfect for map completion.  As far as WvW is concerned, Mesmer is better for roaming, and Scourge necro is better for groups.  Mesmer is pretty much dead in the current meta for competent groups in WvW, and Scourge is one of the strongest classes.  Roamers are generally Mesmers, Rangers, or Thieves.  Check the metabattle website for current builds.  My recommendation is Necro.
---
I have 70%. Is that overkill for a safe boon duration? I don't want to speed clear or min max DPS.
---
I'd rather they just release more blog-posts or dev-posts talking about the future of the game.   Host them on the GW2 main-site and just be done with them.  Maybe a few dev comments when it gets cross-posted to reddit. 
---
they really just need more transparency in general, AMA's wouldn't necessarily fix that if they aren't willing to answer anything that isn't fluff. as many others have said, they need a roadmap, they need to let us know what the future is gonna be for this game, what they are working on. if they don't, it's only going to harm the population and attitude of the community, people can find those things elsewhere and they will if they are kept in the dark
---
This doesn't make sense, you work 12 hours a day? Then thats your fault, lower your monthly expenses, and work less. I can still save up money, play games 5-6 hours a day and go on vacation. You're doing it wrong
---
[&lt; Poll's results &gt;](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelSjndiw9CYPcOBKxx3EFCgAshKM5WnqvsCsdLfLrBteB1_Q/viewanalytics)
---
Basically, the incident involving Jessica Price (just google it) spelt the death of meaningful communication between Anet and players on a platform not their own.
---
The devtracker sees them responding on reddit mostly to fluff these days, sometimes to clarify policy or correct someone's misinformation.
---
Whoo is best quaggan and why is it poobadoo?
---
The point was that the jump in the difficulty is kinda high. Once you've been able to play some 50+ hours without much sweat suddenly starting to die to every mob isn't cool. The base game should ramp up the difficulty more in the end to avoid that sort of issue (although someone did say LWS2 is perhaps somewhere in between the core game and HoT difficulty wise)
---
There is no DAD in picture.
---
You're basically saying that a war criminal shouldn't be prosecuted unless Reddit says something about it
---
thief is the easiest class with high damage
---
"But now we're raising the stakes and we're actually starting to release what we'd consider expansion-level features, alongside these things, when they come online, when they're ready.
---
We're not saving things for big expansions anymore. These things come online when they're ready and we're going to keep releasing them."
---
[Source](https://www.shacknews.com/article/107195/guild-wars-2-sixth-birthday-interview-mike-zadorojny-talks-the-living-world)
---
They would need to replace upper management and CM staff for AMAs to work.
---
Ah yes, the "we're a majority so all content should be for us" argument yet again. 
---
They doubled down on this "majority". Lets see how it goes for the future of the game :) 
---
&gt; And 2 devs were fired because of **interactions** with community, I wouldn’t want to risk my job over an **interaction** on the internet if it isn’t my job to talk to the playerbase.
---
I suppose insulting is a form of interaction so technically true.
---
I also really hope that we will see cantha one day in GW2.
---
Ruined and devestated by bubbles in a postapocalypic state where half the continent is flooded. that would finally make this terrible ugly city that makes up half the continent interesting. the lower parts flodded and full of eldrich horrors of the deep sea, the upper parts of the buldings and roofs where the surviving people live, maybe the palace area as the last non ruined fortess of the canthean empire while the rest is in anarchy where survivors and gangs fight for survival against each other and the things that come up from the lower levels of the town and from within the twisted half collapsed buildings.
---
Meanwhile further south we have the former Jade sea with the luxon that first: due to the sea becoming alive again and second thanks to bubbles flooding were able to gte back to their seafaring roots, while the stone forest, also somehow back to its old state but still with some remaining influence from the jadewind is some island in the sea of bubbeling terror. And important: after the nearly destruction of the empire both are idnependant again after they became destroyed and assimilated by the empire between g1 and gw2.
---
And each area should be an terror loaded hard mess like the HoT maps where you constanly feel threatend.
---
Masterys could go from anything underwater in the flooded tunnels and buildings from climbing/grapling hock stuff for traveling between the buildings etc.  
---
This would be my fav setting for cantha.  
---
Alternativly i would like some War scenario between Tyria (maybe in alliance with Elona) against the canthean empire. We knew that the last one pretty much estabilshed some kind of nazi regime and purged non humans. (again. canthean tradition it seems. i bet tengus are now extinct there)
---
Maybe the gloryious canthean empire, master of mankind wants to conquer new lands...?  Hell invading that place would be awesome. Let me burn down canthas ugly city!
---
Huh you're right.
---
I do use pots when going into dungeons, fractals got its own potions.
---
My guess on why no saurians, mordrem, awakened, branded, forged etc potions is because anet doesn't wana bring any more power creep happening. Especially PoF ads are easier imo than HoT and having pots would make it too ez
---
https://i.imgur.com/EZDRW3W.png
---
its been a while.
---
Thankj you for your help! it worked. The game starts now and can be played,  but with (expected) high FPS drops (rata Sum = 15 FPS) even with the -dx9single command added
---
Ok I think the best way to go about it is.
---
1. Let's get you ascended gear mainly so that you can slowly work onto t4 fractals. Best way to go about it make the weapons first then work on the armor (you may need people help craft some t7 mats for you since it's time gated)
---
2. Ascended trinkets (rings can be infused and attuned - from 10 pristine relics ea), ascended accessories best get with guild commendations, ascended amulet get via WvW vendors at a discount for 20 laurels and some badges of honor. Ascended backpiece you can get via grinding fractals and upgrade beta fractal capacitors.
---
3. Last but not least, you can still practice DPS rotations via training golem. Learn your rotations and you're ready to do be useful when the time comes for you to raid with HoT
---
&gt; so the Tonic of slaying Centaurs or Ogre is a Dungeon Tonic too?
---
No, they are fillers to level cooking
---

Hmm... didn´t they tease a timetravel plot back with this one charr at the lake with the portals/rifts?
---
Where his dialoges uncover that he is somehow wishy washy in time and our dialoges with him are totally mixed up and our char is like "wait what? but you told me that...and now i... ohh.... what?"
---
don´t know it excatly anymore but it was part of the current story back then and sneak patched in during LS3.
---
Not only isn't it what I said, but you can't even remotely get that from what I said. The problem with a conversation is you have to include all of it, and I was replying to someone who was saying this is what he expects from a game, despite the fact that this game wasn't pushing that agenda, pretty much ever. None of the stuff he asked for was stuff that was pushed by the company. Sure they mentioned dungeons, but most of what they talked about was a living breathing world. I don't go to a classic concert and complain it's not rock.
---
More to the point, hard core games tend to have smaller audiences that casual games, which is why games continually get dumbed down. As the age of the average gamer rises (it's now over 30), more and more you're seeing compromises to people who have lives, jobs, families, responsibilities. Maybe they can't live in a game or take a game seriously. Maybe they just want to come home from work and kill some shit before bed.  I'm going to guess that there are plenty of people like that playing this game.
---
But no, I never said the game shouldn't have content for everyone, I simply said the company has a priority and that priority is obvious and there's a reason for that priority.
---
You don't think Anet has the numbers on who does what? Because I'm pretty sure they do. And I'm pretty sure when your business is running, you're going to cater to a majority first and foremost as well.
---
Doesn't mean there shouldn't be other content. Does mean that coming off as all surprised that you can't get meat at a vegetarian place is probably a bit silly.
---
"When the time is right, birds will bite your face". XD

---
The beginning game is pretty boring compared to later on. It gets more fun. I remember my first few hours with the game I was so lost and hated how slow it was and then quit for a year-ish. I came back and have been addicted after pulling myself out of the atrocious starter maps
---
the way you will play gs in the "meta" situations is vastly different than your open world experience
---
often bosses won't move that much and you can position yourself in a better way plus you will have quickness so the animation will be finished a lot faster
---
you can also just not play gs if you hate it obviously..but when you get comfortable with the weapon and the class, you will know how to use more effectively
---
it's a strong weapon and part of warrior's identity but you can get by in any content without ever using it if you just genuinely hate it
---
if you don't have mounts though, the mobility is a lot more important than damage for a faster leveling experience
---
it's quite good advice to spec "massive condie clear" to survive mirage..and when everybody else has adjust around countering 1 single spec, what does it mean? that it's overpowered? no
---
will speccing "massive condie clear" cripple you against every other build except maybe scourge? probably! but who cares about losing to engis, thieves, warriors, rangers, revenants, guards anyway! as long as you beat the mirage it's a victory in my eyes no matter what the scoreboard says
---
It isn't, its fine. To be honest I'd love it if warriors didn't actually use it off cooldown. That would be great.
---
When I got my first windows XP PC in 2008 I never ran windows update on it, and I ran it till 2012 because using PC cautiously (especially with power user  knowledge) is the best protection measure. With windows 7 it should be even easier as operating system core is more secure.
---
All classes are DPS. There is no dedicated support or tank class, outside of a few specialized builds which are only needed for Raids in PvE, or certain roles in PvP/WvW. So just pick what you like.
---
I think Season 4 will close the lore in Elona for good, and we'll move to Tyria's matters in Season 5. I think we'll see the war between the races, and the Commander will try to unite them once more, it won't be easy because the PC screwed up in Ep 5, so noone will be willing to listen to us anymore, we'll be abandoned. 
---
Guild Wars 4 will begin - Factions anti- and pro- killing the Elder Dragons. 
---
The races will divide and the Pale Tree will stay indifferent, because Sylvari will be reshaped in a new crystalline form, reshaped by Aurene that will unite with the Pale Tree, and we'll be able to get to Kralkatorrik's mind (as Snaff tried to) and we'll kill him from the inside. Also we'll get to know the whole history of this Elder Dragon, seeing the pictures of his past inside of his brain that is divided by hatred and the vision of hope and his fight to throw away this vision that haunts him. 
---
Kralkatorrik is a very interesting dragon, because it seems that only he could feel how powerful hope is, he among his hatred felt hope... It puts an Elder Dragon in a different light, they actually can feel positive emotions, and not knowing them, he fights them. 
---
Haven't you wondered why he even had a daughter? A family? Other Dragons create minions that are far from being their family members, but Kralkatorrik actually created his minion to have a family, still under his control, but as family. Also Kralkatorrik trusted Glint to reveal his secret, and that she saw the hope for the world when he said that to her, BUT why would Kralkatorrik reveal his secret to the purified Glaust? He must have told Glint about this vision before she was cleansed. So Glaust (Glint) had actually free will so she could actually think that it's hope, not doom for Tyria. His creations have some part of their own will, but still under his command, and the Forgotten actually noticed that Glaust have the potential to say by his will: "I want to be purified" and so Glint replaced Glaust. 
---
It's very interesting that Kralkatorrik didn't have any control over his grandchildren, he gave them free will, but still his part of brain full of hatred wanted to bad to rid of them, so he just wanted to smash them away, but this vision of hope will haunt him forever, unless he accepts it. 
---
The Forgotten dared to try to convert Kralkatorrik, so they saw the possibility that Kralkatorrik may accept this hope, but he didn't, he had too much hatred, and not a full sense of hope. 
---
And the Pale Tree as the last beacon of hope and creation of Mordremoth, the Elder Dragon can actually show Kralkatorrik that hope can help him to understand he is just lost, and he actually has the power to defy his dark path, and be cleansed in hope, in the Dream. 
---
So that's actually my looong speculation about the future. 
---
It will be 1 week exp boost event in wvw xD.
---
What word would you use to describe two hours of content every 4 months compared to an active MMO like WOW or FF14?
---
Engineer does sometimes feel like Anet had all these cool ideas for mechanics and just wanted a class to compile them all. Unfortunately the only worthwhile kit does seem to be Med Kit - every ability is useful. Flamethrower and Elixer Gun have their uses. Tool Kit has a little bit of utility, but ultimately usually not worth the slot. Grenade Kit plays well with traits, but it's the same spell in five different flavors taking up your weapon bar.
---
Bomb kit, you don't deserve the time of day.
---
That being said, my favorite support class is Scrapper. My favorite combat/pure damage class is core Engineer. Even with these skill options that get passed over without a second though, I find immense satisfaction in the gameplay of the class. It'd still be cool to see some more useful options, however.
---
The game is a completely different experience with and without an elite specialization fully unlocked with a good build and an understanding of how to play it. 
---
Thanks!
---
k
---
How do you even live with such a thin skin.
---
Which is good, because it gives us stability, but has a dark side, since there's no healthy competition to grow and get better.
---
Bye bye then. I like how they made fractals "not too easy gold per hour". Fractals beat literally everything except farms when it comes to gold/hour.
---
There’s is an event where a svanir beast attacks the owl shrine. Do that once and it gives you the first Owl part. Then wait for it to come up a second time and it gives you the second Owl part. 
---
The event where there is waves of svanir is spawning super rarely or gets bugged out in my observations. 
---
I had trouble with that one too. Tbh I just waited for daily reset S:
---
I know. But I'd argue you'd clear faster with industry+superspeed to get between nodes.
---
Same, and also the reason why I stopped playing on a daily basis. Now I clear raids weekly. Nothing else to do. Oh well. I have fun in other games now, there is a lot out there. :)
---
Pretty much. JP had already explained a lot of the narrative questions that Deroir asked about during the reddit AMA so it is probably perceived by Anet as simply better to avoid any situation that might lead to something similar in the future. 
---
Been standing at the area for over 3 hours now, not a single event has triggered.
---
Oh darn then that instance is whacked. The Beast event is supposed to spawn every 20 mins
---
Do you advice I return on tuesday after the reset? Or should I keep waiting?
---
Feminist rages at promotional partner on twitter for "mansplaining" when he engaged in open discussion with her about the games lore. Proceeds to behave like an entitled narcissist. gets fired. blames men. Kotaku supports her. everyone sees her tantrum and entitlement for what it is.
---
Was hoping for some advice from some more knowledgeable people  than myself. I have managed to grind myself the gems for 2 harvesting tools and 1 log 1 mining with glyphs of forester, prospector, leatherworker and herbalist over time but only just realised glyphs can be swapped (what a moron). So - 1 full set of tools stays on my farm character and the spare harvesting tool is on my WvW main. Given that the WvW nodes will only drop me the t5 &amp; 6 items depending on the glyph - which would be best for WvW or least bad to loose the efficiency of gathering the equivalent of all tiers of mats. Thanks in advance.
---
You don't want to become one of those horrible pug commanders. Even if you inform and educate yourself about the encounters, you're still missing a lot of just trial and error experience which a good comm should have.
---
So save your money and do not get that comm tag yet.
---
Go to r/guildrecruitment and browse it for the training guilds. I'd recommend joining one of the largest training discords (advertised on Snowcrows training section) AND join a smaller more intimate training guild in-game. 
---
Why joint to two, you may ask - well the large training discords have thousands of members in them and since there is only a limited amount of experienced commanders, the spots to training runs are often raffled. In a smaller guild the commander might not be as battle hardened as in those big discords, but you have a spot guaranteed in almost every raid there is and you can even actually experience the joy of getting a kill after lengthy trial and error struggle, which really teaches you the most. 
---
Give necro a shield next elite spec. I miss when necros were raid bosses. 
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted tbh, this is exactly what good players have been saying, publicly and privately. "The game is just not for me, I have to accept that or leave."
---
I've found that ele's rotation, other than staff, is quite difficult to utilize without some serious practice and knowledge of the rotation. I'd say head to YouTube for help man.
---
Spellbreaker isn't a terrible choice. I believe weaver and mirage also work pretty well, for both the guards and for other players. Rangers aren't half bad either.
---
If you want to kill players as a focus, I'd say do Mirage or maybe even Deadeye
---
That Chat Picture in the HUD section isn't very intuitive though! (Just saying) xD
---
yea and those that aren't good enough don't succeed..just like in other games, just like in real life!
---
this participation trophy bullshit has to stop
---
No, opposite to e.g. weapon-skins, minis aren't unlocked when you use them in the mystic forge, so you have to buy the heads two times.
---
For chronos, it’s more important to keep up boons than to do damage, so take however much BD you need to keep em up.
---
Theoretically taking mimic should allow you to reduce your BD even more since SoI is a flat 5 seconds of boon duration increase, but I tend to just keep the same amount just to be safe.
---
&gt; Anet decided to fire those two
---
This is one possible interpretation. There was never a clear statement beyond "they do not work here any more".
---
They might have quit on their own because they felt the company does not have their back.
---
They might have agreed mutually that parting ways was the best way to go forward in that situation.
---
Maybe one of them was fired and that made the other quit as a reaction.
---
We just don't know what happened exactly.
---
Necromancer's are healers?
---
I agree, it feels like we rarely hear pretty much anything from the devs these days and that's exactly how people become out of touch with their audience. Compared to something like Warframe which is a skyscraper of communication in comparison to GW2, it leaves more to be desired. I'd hope for some communication from ANet monthly, that can't be too much ask for can it? I especially wanna know what we can expect after the next living world season as at the point it will be quite a long time before we get an expansion. Can we expect another expansion after, do they have other plans? 
---
Balance patches are too few and far between. Even when they do come, they fail to really change anything. How long have classes like Scrapper been considered practically garbage-tier? Thank god for the upcoming WvW update which has been pushed off by a whole week unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.
---
What exactly are they benefiting from by remaining mostly silent? How does giving the community nothing to be excited about help them anyway? Does the future look grim and that's why they're silent, should we be ultimately worried? That's all I can assume given the situation, which sucks because GW2 is the only MMORPG that could hold my attention for awhile.
---
Dagger is meta on support scourge for the life generation. ;)
---
Because raids except for maybe 2 bosses **are** easy. I cleared wing 1,4 and 5 with 10 scourges
---
So dagger would be "best in slot" for lifeforce generation?
---
As stated by others, warrior gives overpowered buffs to team that is unique to their class. But simultaneously they also do good dps. Logically these classes that can support and do great dps are the best choice. Another example is chrono. But if you want pure dps only then there is thief.
---
Warrior gameplay will be like this:
---
1. Drop banner at appropriate location so everyone gets buff good amount of time.
---
2. Focus on dps.
---
3. If banners are off cooldown drop them again at favourable position. And back to dps.
---
Thats it.
---
I understand that they overstepped and it had repercussion but if anyone in that situation feels uncomfortable that they may say something that could get them fired I wouldn't blame them for one second, to not talk with the community in mass. And we are talking about devs, and the devs job isn't to communicate with community it is to develop, there are people who handle that said.
---
other people already explained to you why you are wrong about slotting a bunch of diviner and that potato sigil..so imma focus on something else
---
&gt; Holosmith using some Diviner is nice to to buff some nearby allies, while still being competitive in damge using the sigil.
---
with what? hard light arena and..?? regen is useless without healing power anyway, fury can be provided from a billion other sources..the only worthwhile boon is protection and it's probably less dps loss to drop the explosives traitline and go into inventions for overshield
---
also yea totally "competitive in damage" with 50% bd gear
---
Then there's also the omnipresent toxicity that seems to became present through every gaming subreddit ...
---
1. Bone Fiend immobilizes on command and I THINK cripples on normal attacks.
---
2. The teleport is kind of dumb but it is a 5 second chill, so good for defiance bar damage.
---
3. Dagger MH is mostly used for the insane heal it gives with its 2 ability, almost healing as much as a normal heal ability in most cases. Otherwise, deals decent damage. You typically use the heal minion in open world pve which is bad for burst healing so this works as a good replacement for a real heal skill.
---
Some questions regarding these qol items.
---
How much gold it takes to get copper fed? And which episode i need to get the best map(bitterfrost that you mentioned) for ascended items? I think 1 episode costs ~60gold if you convert.
---
I dont know about griffon, i never felt the need. Also i lack so many things that i would feel like i wasted money if i get griffon. Its 300g and i only have 600.
---
Also i watch teapot's stream. I like how he has new concepts for raids some days. Its entertaining.
---
Can someone point me in the direction of an up-to-date ascended gear guide? Specifically looking for vipers. Is the best way still to craft something else and mystic forge into vipers? Thanks
---
&gt; What is the purpose of the Bone Fiend?
---
You mean bone minions. They give lifeforce to every nearby necro when they explode and leave a poison field if you have the trait.
---
&gt; What is the purpose of Shroud2 
---
Follow up with 5 and 4. Gap closing.
---
&gt; What's the purpose of Dagger Mainhand?
---
Life force and selfheal.
---
"Not so secret" really was a fun experience the first time. I know it took me like 3 hours to complete it but what i love most is that it's not really that hard after you get used to it and you get faster each time you do it. Once you get used to all the mechanics it's such a walk in the park and only takes like 10 min even now i'm wondering how i had ever any trouble with it.
---
I wouldn’t go that far, but improvement can always be done ^^
---
Right, and with online games you can't just add a difficulty slider to suit everyone but it *is* kinda counterintuitive: Imagine being a someon who actually likes the way the core game is and wants more of that so he buys the expansions. I totally understand why the sudden ramp-up in the difficulty would be frustrating I've heard enough of HoT to not expect a walk in the park myself).
---
Also, I don't like the implication that people who aren't good want some kind "participation trophies", that's just condescending. We just want to have fun with the game like everyone else.
---
Thank you Schimmi! &lt;3 I love the way most people downvote a question and don't answer it :P
---
Can we buy each episode separately to only get things we really need. For me, i really need the map which gives ascended items easily and signet of agony. Is it possible?
---
You mean arc's .dlls on the bin64 folder? Or should i check every single dll each VS C++ downloads?
---
ok
---
handsome 
---
This, axe 5 is like GS 2 but allows you to move which makes a huge difference for open world content.
---
for example this one, helped me  : [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-visual-errors](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-visual-errors)  
---
when you are on this page : [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/)  , simply scroll down, there is troubleshooting with 4 different cases
---
Bit late but recommend you start with HoT raids as it has become easier and there are more people who will join training runs in w1-4 .
---
No he means bone fiend. The single devourer looking one. I'm pretty sure it's used in condi reaper for the projectile finisher. 
---
Is it possible to complete your core tyria masteries without season2? Im stick in last tier which gives auto loot by good amount of points.
---
I think that hissing at each other for voicing opinions is unhealthy.
---
There's a balance.
---
Communities should also get a say but not in a hostile manner.
---
Tbh, I think that the community Q&amp;As over at /r/2007scape work really well, and that game definitely has a less pleasant community than this one.
---
Oh whoops lol. Apparently demons are just a lot of imps though. Thanks.
---
Thanks so much, I missed that article somehow. So essentially it's farm trinkets and craft weapon and armor? Probably some stat-swapping on the armor needed too. thanks
---
Is the story season over? Are we waiting for the next expansion now or will there be another episode?
---
Bone Minion has a guaranteed double projectile finisher on its auto which is key for cReaper.
---
Thanks so much, this is very helpful. So essentially, farm trinkets in lw3 etc as per that guide, and craft weapon and armor outright?
---
They are quite open about there only being a few of them... they haven’t just admitted, but they’ve been transparent about it.
---
Also, they implied in their latest stream that the announcement coming this week for WvW is not a new map, because that takes too many other people from other areas. Believe it or not, a-nets email poured do work together on things even if they’re not on the same individual team within the company. 
---
Just as he said. I main an elementalist and have a blast playing as one. Elementalists are extremely squishy, you have to roll some survival gear mixed with some power/condi for weaver (Marshal Runes are pretty good) usually if you are doing a sword in main hand. Watch some videos, practice, die, practice some more. Know your rotations through the elements, some traits give useful buffs as you cycle through them.
---
and you can keep doing that if thats your thing but why do you want me to be one of the scourges and tell me how to play that content?
---
[You forgot one picture](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gKfhYM2If44/hqdefault.jpg)
---
Apologies if I'm sidetracking the discussion, but I played a lot when the game first came out, but ended up too busy when some of the early Living Story stuff happened, and since I was just sort of behind on the plot, I stopped playing. If I want to get back into it, since so much plot stuff has already happened and I won't be able to experience it firsthand, is there a decent synopsis somewhere to catch me up, or a good set of youtube videos to watch? In other words, a "kind of beginner's guide to the plot."
---
That was a great survey. Now excuse me while I go pray to my Cantha-shrine.
---
The land itself is no longer actively hostile to life. Forests can regrow there, whereas only sparse hardy plants would survive before. We basically un-salted the earth with the initial "cleansing of Orr," what's going on now is just replanting and getting rid of all the other junk Zhaitan left lying around.
---
Thank you for providing me the source. 
---
Though, I'm not sure they actually will release expansion features through LW episodes. I wouldn't feel nice if they did because then it gets so mixed up. When they release an expansion I know I can expect big features and major changes, and when they release a LW episode I know they are just doing some minor features if any at all.
---
I hope they don't discontinue expansions, one of the reasons being that expansions offer them a larger opportunity to promote the game. 
---
This reminds me of how much I appreciated the effort to put in some really nice hair and face styles for humans to actually look African/Elonian. It's ridiculous how many games just think you can throw in a round ball "afro" and call it a day. 
---
She was a good community manager back then when gw was a thing but not anymore. And she being an amazing person irl doesn't mean she's good at her job which is the reason why some in this subreddit critizise her for.
---
yeah, should specify that it needs the HOT elite spec like it does with druid.
---
What's funny is that she was actually great during the AMA. So either she just got questions she liked, or she actually WAS pretending to like us here. 
---
Congrats! I made mine about a month after I started doing t4 fractals regularly, about 2 years ago. I probably had 1.5k hours and 4 years invested at that point.
---
right after we get profession specific keybinds. k, thx, bye.
---
&gt; Tbh, I think that the community Q&amp;As over at /r/2007scape work really well, and that game definitely has a less pleasant community than this one.
---
That game is literally built on it's community. They poll virtually everything to make sure a large percent (75% or more) want their content.
---
It doesn't work here because entire gamemodes and balance gets completely neglected and most of the time it's story shit.
---
I don't thin that's the case. After the events many employees and most of them women said that they love working for Anet and that they feel like it's a very inclusive workplace as opposed to what JP said after she was fired.
---

You can boost safely in that case. If you struggle with class/content you can easily visit older maps since they are a lot easier.
---
Gold making advice? I lucked out with selling some rare skins so now I have about 1.5k gold in liquid. Looking for ways to use this to earn even more gold. What are the (not necessary best) methods of making more gold without becoming utterly bored at the game?
---
The teleport on shoroud 2 is a gap closer something you want when you play PvP or WvW. This game have more game modes then PvE :)
---
The bone fiend is what it is. Minion Master in mostly played by people who just started the game and people who afk farm or gather stuff to keep off aggro. You don't really use a minion master build in instanced PvE nor in PvP or WvW. If you do you have a huge arrow on your head saying this person have no clue and will die instantly and draw death to them because of it. 
---
You questions are a bit odd, because when you ask what the purpose of Dagger main hand is and then you answer it. So what answer are you looking for there?
---
Core guardian has a semi meta DPS build. Granted, you won't be doing raids on a free account, it's probably your best choice for damage without the expansions. I don't know much about them in PvP, but I think they do well.
---
Core Warrior is good in PvP, and is good in everything else for their banners, not so much damage. However, again, you won't have access to raids, so that won't be much of a problem since people generally take core Warrior for fractals. It's also a very simple class that's more or less "use skills off cool down" with a very simple opening rotation. They still don't do awful DPS, even when full support. I've been top DPS more than once as my core Warrior, though this is much easier done with my condi banners.
---
You could easily setup inventory for each character to look the same, it takes like 3 seconds per character. 
---
&gt;And 2 devs were fired because of interactions with community,
---
Those 2 devs were fired for reasons outside of Reddit, and the forum chats don't really prevent that from happening again. In fact, if I recall correctly, one of the things the dev was complaining about was from the forum chat, not Reddit.
---
&gt; Ruined and devestated by bubbles in a postapocalypic state
---
Fuck off. This is what I HATE about how GW2's been introducing new maps of the old world. We don't see X map's future version. We see X map entirely reimagined to fit the boring dragon narrative for the 7th year in a row.
---
I couldn't give less of a shit about dargon devastated map \#32834324632. I want to see Cantha, not a dragon infested generic shithole for the nth time.
---
Good job, you deserved your [apple cider].
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Get more 32 bag slots. Job done.
---
No extra ones made by windows? Good. Another option is to redowload gw2 which takes a long time.  
---
I’m no expert software guy, I just try stuff till it starts going, lol. 
---
But the extra dll happened some weeks ago to me. 
---
Southsun Survival*
---
Did you just reply twice?
---
If you dig around on Linkedin you can see some Anet people being hired to work on a mobile game for at least 3 years now.
---
The trick is starting your own party asking for specific things.
---
Which is a point that doesn't matter. Every class can do absurd damage if specced for it. Only one class can do that damage from so far away that there is no risk or counterplay to it. Certain classes literally have no chance to reach the soulbeast before it's over. Your point was a little random and off topic. Other classes using combos to do damage while soulbeast can auto attack the damage numbers you listed safely is kind of the point of the thread you just keep pointing at others going "BUT WHAT ABOUT THEMMMM" 
---
Look for Istan farm and RIBA (silverwastes). Both get boring after a while though. 
---
I have 3 fractal amulets. I can stat swap them from the thing in wvw to get whatever i stat i want. I again cannot thanks you enough for all this information. I will make sure to spend my gold well.
---
yes i hate mirage and its monopoly on condi fights
---
So instead of a legitimate addition to your argument you chose to just say l2p? I've mained all the medium classes and have had my thief in the top 250 for 3 seasons. None of this really matters since gw2 isn't competitive any longer but I can rest easy knowing I could roll you on thief blind folded. 
---
Now you mention fractals? Weird you mention holo is a meme due to it only being meta on a few raid bosses when it's a staple in fractal meta atm if you want burst power damage. Raids are played by a small portion of the game you're going to need to include a bit more than one game mode to label a spec a meme there Brazil. 
---
Leveling is very fast if you know what to do and maybe irrelevant if you are experienced so feel free to use the boost. If anything you should know that the boost gives you Defense gear so you should buy some offensive armor and weapons right after using it. 
---
No women allowed beyond this point! 
---
"Would you like some friiiEES with that?"
---
Maybe forget about the bags (don't let GW2 show them to you), but instead use one, continuous inventory. Then each character can have the same width. Would that solve your problem?
---
I'm trying to complete the Shatterer achievements, but can't seem to progress on No-Fly Zone or get Smash the Dragon because no one uses bombs to cc him when his breakbar is up.
---
Does anyone know if there is a guild/community/commander on Eu that tries to do these achievements?
---
That's one of the reasons I'm not crafting any of the 20+ bags.
---
As much as I enjoyed the humor of the chat hub with the "I regret buying PoF", I really hope this doesn't give wrong vibes to newcomers. 
---
Yes it's incredibly annoying! 
---
Unf 😍😍😍
---
1.5k gold is probably more gold than Ive earned in 6 years of playing the game. With that much gold you might try forging legendaries
---
I wanna go to Depths of Tyria and Northern Shiverpeaks.
---
Maybe deal with Jormag.
---
Norn are underrepresented. 
---
 ***O H M Y*** 
---
I hate battle Royale games. And everybody and their mother wants to make one these days.
---
Fucking genre needs to die. 
---
Lol, well for the USA it's February...
---
. . . The shortest month out the year.
---
Lol, it was me vs Rom. And, yes mirage needs a change (at least in his current state). 
---
Submit a ticket to support explaining your problem and if you are lucky they will send you the collection item.
---
i was about to say the same thing
---
What is the point of your post?  You cant play elementalist so you went back to soulbeast. Got it.  No one cares
---
GW2 business model is b2p. In 2015 Mike o'Brien confirmed it's never going to be changed. You can discuss all you want about optional sub, it will never happen.
---
I would say start leveling and see if you have fun doing that.
---
It wasnt mine although I had to go to this because there was no level boost. I find my fun later in game and love what i found like raids and fotm. Feel free to use the boost as well as to try out some classes @lvl 80 before you choose your first character. you can also go in pvp and get a feeling about the classes
---
Weird you suck their cock so hard disagree with this top tier guild and say it's shit. So what is it? Are they world first top tier theorycrafters to believe or should I believe you? Since you're directly disagreeing with the site you posted lmao. See how opinions work?
---
how is playing sword dagger harder then staff rota?
---
So the mounts are account-wide and you can use the mount from the boost on your leveling toon you're saying?
---
Yup
---
Pretty good idea ! Use the boost and get the mount. You will be able to explore fast and to discover the game peacefully
---
That is a great game, I would not recommend rushing it 
---
Like?
---
What's the right composition?
---
Yeah. Ideally, this would be some kind of living story ep so everyone can experience it, but I could also see it done as a current event along with some kind of festival. 
---
Yes, as a result of her doubling down and attacking the community after that.
---
Maybe stereotypical is a stretch. They added a LOT of textured hair styles that took inspiration from African cultures, but are still Elonian.
---
&gt;	Brock Eirson (whatever his name is)
---
This is the new “Tony Stank“.
---
Thank you for that.
---
You can use skills that let you jump to the next platform like Wings of Resolve or you can weapon swap mid air to shorten the jump. You can practise that on the first set of wheels inside the cave without dying every time you make a mistake.
---
Or just ask a mesmer to port you up and explain the jump. 
---
If there is not already a mesmer I like to spend some time there and help people "beat" this jp and I do check lfg for people who need help with this too. If you're on the Eu servers feel free to send me a pm if you need help.
---
Exactly. What's the difference. If you want to pay anet you can do this already. Except... you want a gold star for your money spent, to feel "special".
---
It has never been the only way. But it is the only way for quick and smooth run. 
---
Wakanda forevah
---
The difference is that with the sub you'll have to keep paying while the TP is a one-off and can be earned ingame.
---
I would be fine with that.  One of the things that originally made me fall in love with GW2 was watching the development posts leading up to release.  It would be great to have more insight into their design process/choices.
---
Once you get the mount (do the first part of Path of Fire for the raptor) you can use it with all your characters, it makes map exploration and leveling so much more enjoyable.
---
Yep, but the open world pve and fractals playerbase is, at least numbers-wise, the only one that matters to ANet. And to most players as well. Only a very small percentage of people are doing some serious WvW/PvP/Raids so while those parts of playerbase might not be "healthy" it is not that much detrimental to the whole game, which is mainly a casual open world and story experience for the majority of players.
---
Not that I wouldn't like to see improvements to those modes... especially WvW. But if I were to choose a superpack of features for PvP/WvW/Raids instead of a story/open world expansion I wouldn't hesitate a second to pick the latter.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character is an updated version of the above guide, with PoF gear. May help.
---
It's not like I downvote questions, but for small questions like these, it's best to go [there](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ar8muv/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_february_16/).
---
I don't think that'd work great because the number of bag spaces is off between the OPs characters. One has 32-slot bags, and the rest have 20-slot bags. So they may have issues with the rows not being even or something (they mentioned OCD with their bags so this could be a concern).
---
Mlk was a socialist goodbyeeeeeee
---
Actually stop
---
The rest of the world's GW2 wont implement a system like that because the incentive for you is the legendary box at the end. Hell, on GW2China, you can buy legendaries and infusions for a straightforward, non-fluxuating price.
---
How would you entice American players to buy premium? It wouldn't be making cosmetic infusions and legendaries available in the gemstore....it would be taking away specific services and options so that you may offer it in a premium system. 
---
If the players find it super necessary, they will buy it and if they buy it, include boosts because they're obviously paying monthly for this, so why not allow them boosts because they're working and don't have much time to play? Is that a good idea? Sure! But more of the playerbase are part of the younger generation that also have a decent amount of time to play. So what happens? Everyone wants those boosts that go along with the service. So they buy it, and it makes money.

Condi Daredevils don't run through their condis fast enough to keep up with power builds in the typically short fights you find in fractals. Some burn-focused builds can manage it, but you won't find anything like that on Daredevil, which is more at home in raids.
---
I wouldn't say you have to buy the expansions right away, but its definitely something that you should consider if you get back into the game over the next month or so. The type of game that GW2 is (MMORPG) tend to take a lot more invested time than 5 hours for the player to truly receive the value from the game. The best part in my opinion of GW2 is later/end game, once you are comfortable with the mechanics, and have decent gear and a decent build - there is hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of content once you reach max level.
---
The expansions offer more content, other fun mechanics such as mounts and gliding, meta events, different gear stats that are often useful, new specializations that give you access to new abilities and builds, and a lot more. 
---
Also, I would wait until the spring break sale (mid March) to see if the expansions come on sale, in which case you can often get 25-50% off depending on the price a-net decides. 
---
No problem, my mom isn't a native English speaker so I'm used to explaining these sorts of mistakes.
---
I hope the nerd Mirage and soulbeast only in PvP and WvW, I find them really fun in PvE I hope this won’t kill them 
---
But why does it say 'upgrade to full account' as if I'm playing a trial version, when I already downed 50 euros on gw2 at the release?
---
&gt; It feels like im playing a free trial version even though i got the pre-order for like 50 euros back then.
---
and what makes it feel like that exactly?
---
tons of features and content that have been added to the core game since release... even without getting the expansions or Living World episodes you're playing a game that is way more fleshed out than what you poked at for a few hours 6 years ago.
---
Boy, you can do anything to me
---
Tier 4 artwork 👌🏻
---
i saw the dude in Heart of the mists, his character name was Samuel Lockwood
---
try messaging him :D EU btw
---
Pictured; a babe
---
They set the Charr up as so important to the story, their legacy and conquest, their legions' barely fleshed-out lands (like Flame and Blood), In fact, Flame doesn't stay relevant long during the story despite being ever-present in Ascalonian life.
---
Then they feed so much into Pact technology, early airship, "tanks", weapons, and their contributions are just skimmed over. They have so much to offer, especially with the (slightly shoehorned, but still great) Olmakhan now, but they are pretty much ignored in the last few DLC aside.
---
Norn are also a bit ignored, but I feel their history doesn't have the most places it can go still. I'd certainly love to learn more about Kodan and Kodan culture.
---
You can't escape April Stewart. She's [all over the place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Stewart#Video_games). And I agree with you. She tries way too hard to be dramatic.
---
You can already stick an Eboga inside you...and you want a junundu now? Yikes.
---
Damn right we are. Gaming communities can be incredibly whiny and toxic. They can also be very nice and welcoming, but MMOs have some of the whiniest man children I've encountered. 
---
1. pretty much because infinite would be... strange
---
2. In the current lore, yes, there are only six elder dragons. Omadd's Machines showed us the vision of 6 orbs that get associated with the Elder Dragons. But I mean, we are talking about a game here, ArenaNet could add new elder dragons as they want.
---
3. Technically they don't consume "all" Magic in Tyria but so much Magic that most will not be present anymore. 
---
4. That is correct. Currently, we have seen Elder Dragons being close or even on top of big Ley-Line Energy hubs which could mean that either they slumber there because of the high concentration of Energy or that those hubs form there because of the Energy that the elder dragons "emit"
---
5. Exactly. And that is why we want to have a replacement for an Elder Dragon that doesn't want to consume most of the Magic in the world every  10 thousand years.
---
6. While I wouldn't say the same because it can still fluctuate depending on which Dragon has how much still left etc. You could basically compare it with Oxygen.
---
Red herring.
---
Just read through the toxicity in this entire page and you'll see why the devs don't want to touch this community with a 10 foot pole.
---
I wished so badly that there would come a time where we could change our voices in the game. I play as a human female (hey it's the meta) but I love the Sylvari female voice, in every instance. Hell, I would have played as a Sylvari but their body proportions completely alter heavy armor in the worst way.
---
Tl;dr I want to play as a vegetable with curves.
---
I would say its definitely worth a shot. Give them all the information you can. There is a pretty good chance they wont be able to due to the length of time that has passed, and not being able to verify that it was you botting or not. 
---
If you are able to give them the CD/Product Key, your full name, e-mail, character name, and old password, they may be able to.
---
It's not guaranteed, though. 
---
On the bright side, most of the content that was available on your purchased account is available on your free account, with some minor limitations. There should be dozens of hours of playable content to go through on your free account and if you like it,  in March there is likely to be an expansion sale during the spring sale. 
---
Haven’t played GW for almost 2 years, but that looks like:
---
- Head: Thief starting mask
---
- Shoulder: Caudecus Armor (I would hide them)
---
- Chest: Carapax Set
---
- Gloves: dunno, but I think every pair can work
---
- Pants: Falconers Set
---
- Boots: Falconers Set
---
For dyes probably white, celestial or whatever whitey dye, red just try your dyes, might be crimson or blood etc don’t know how they look on leather. 
---
For the brown parts, he probably used the remove color option.
---
WvW?
---
**IRRELEVANTt GAME MODE!**
---
Sounds like Anet allright. 
---
That's valid, but I feel like the "slave to doing things just for the sake of doing them" mentality is pretty much how every MMO ropes in the hardcores. Every game I've ever become a hardcore raider in has turned me into the same robot, and I always end up with the same feeling -- I finally realize that I'm not really having fun, and outside of raids/highend content, there's nothing left that interests me. Personally, GW2 is the only game I've ever played where this *hasn't* happened. I enjoy doing everything in this game, including basic leveling new characters, and I just do different stuff depending on my mood.
---
So I certainly don't think this is GW2-exclusive problem. It's more of an issue with the MMO model in general, exacerbated in some people depending on their personality type and what they happen to enjoy.
---
 I do agree, however, that the game as a whole needs more communication, and more content coming, in order to stay healthy. People are already in full-panic "this game is dead" mode for some reason, and while I don't really understand that, it's still valid and needs attention.
---
I mean, you're the one calling peolpe manchildren here. Like any grown and mentally stable adult would ever do that.
---
buy
---
Staff 4* it is the only good utility ons taff.
---
Ahem it's pronounced Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo.
---
You can make a staff power Daredevil or a dagger/dagger Deadeye and both will do fine in fractals. I don't know what you mean by 'the proc system', but [here's a decent guide for power Thief builds](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/thief/daredevil/power/).
---
From the first one, aim just a bit to the right of the cog on the second one; there's a little thing sticking up you can catch yourself on.  Here's a video (go to 6:18 if the direct link doesn't work):
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJVY2s3eUJk&amp;t=378](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJVY2s3eUJk&amp;t=378)
---
Yes, power is much stronger on Daredevil and Deadeye. There is a Grieving Deadeye build, which isn't as strong, that you may want to check out. https://youtu.be/nIbyydq8jww
---
Currently condi daredevil needs a bit of a buff for instanced PvE and it is even weaker in open world PvE. 
---
No, 5 and 6 do not in any way contradict 1. He said *finite*, not *constant*. The magic in Tyria fluctuates, as seen through the story. What we don't know is whether Tyria is a closed system, separated from the Mists at large. If magic from the mists constantly seeps into Tyria, then it wouldn't be wrong to say that there's infinite magic in Tyria, assuming the mists are infinite, but we don't know. All we know is that the Dragons go to sleep once there's little magic left to consume, which necessitates there being a finite amount of magic, that *might* trend towards infinity given enough time.
---
Didn't think id ever change my characters looks or make any new ones until I got access to better looking black hair ^^
---
Bone fiends really have no purpose beyond passive damage. They don’t respawn automatically on a cooldown and have a cast time (unlike Rise), so it doesn’t make sense blowing them up—also, they might not be in the spot you want them to blow up in anyway since you have no control. 
---
Honestly, if they made bone fiend respawn on their own, it would make the skill more desirable since the explosion is nice damagw when you can stick it, but isn’t worth ruining a rotation by recasting them. This is especially true when shade does similar possible damage, doesn’t require recasting, and the trigger is instant and useful (when it works). 
---
Most core necro skills are actually bad without an elected spec. For example, Dagger is just bad for core. No damage, no real utility—2 is nice, but it drops damage even lower and doesn’t heal for an overwhelming amount. But if you combo it with scourge, you find that the high LF generation is super nice with a healer setup. 
---
Keep an eye out for "Aurion Legacy of the Kori-Odan".
---
What I'd love to happen is that if you done a heart before, the time required to do it again halves (or more).
---
Usually I only repeat hearts to finish collections that I didn't get first time around as I didn't have enough currency available when I originally did the heart.
---
*weary stare* go away
---
Sure, maybe not *all* magic, but let's not descend into pedantry, shall we?
---
That said, it has in fact been made *very* clear that Elder Dragons eat magic while awake. Remember the Mouth of Zhaithan, or isn't that suggestive enough? 
---
&gt; causing all the magic to go back to the world.
---
Please look into Arah and the Asura central transfer chamber, and why they ended up being at their respective locations. (hint: an Elder Dragon slept nearby)
---
&gt;Plus, 5 and 6 contradict 1.
---
Please elaborate.
---
Thanks!  I tried to die somewhere that anyone who's been through that JP would recognize!
---
Hell yes! From the moment I first noticed that a cabbage commander is voiced by commander shepard I wanted to play sylvari so bad. 
---
Ah the autoattack. Now I feel stupid. All the other weapons use skills for lifeforce. Autoattack on a fast weapon makes more sense.  (I'm not counting GS since that's super slow.)
---
Oh look, this thread again. We get it what, once every week or so? And what's the point? Just a place for bitter gamers with nothing else to do to wank about how much better they think they could do someone else's job
---
That's why I swapped from Human female to Sylvari female starting with HoT. The Sylvari female voice work is excellent.
---
I suppose you are talking about a certain... avian variety?
---
ANet is a very, hmm, "SJW" company, I think it's supposed to be their dig at perceived misogyny, because all we do is sit around drinking and talk about excluding women from everything lol. 
---
I love how people still like wvw despite marked change. No chance in hell for any group stealth stacking to gank you...i miss that surprise though. No longer fun for me :(
---
You are not a 4 meter tall awakened.
---
to be fair, it is rather silly that all the Legends are called "Legendary ____ Stance"
---
1. Ah old Shroud1 makes current Shroud2 more sense. --Though honestly I find core Shroud5 nice in PvP. It's one of the few Reveal skills in game. Really trips Thieves and Mirages with correct timing.
---

epic scene from family guy. 
---
Ah but I don't Minion mancy. I find that Mininos are sort of like Mantras. Charge them up, then release at the opportune moments. Just the Bone Fiend is meh. An Imbolize when all the others do neat stuff?
---
For the most part, yes, though I'll toss in one extra note:
---
The bloodstones were made in hopes of keeping some magic hidden away from the dragons. It is [implied](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thrulnn_the_Lost) that this may have slowly lead to the downfall of ancient races such as the jotun, as it lowered the amount of magic available to them.
---
With one of the Bloodstones now blown up, it has released a ton of magic back into the system.  This, paired with leftover magic from Zhaitan and Mordremoth, has lead to [magical anomalies](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Ley-Line_Anomaly) being born out of concentrations of pure magic.
---
There are still four more bloodstones in Tyria, meaning there's still a ton of magic that could eventually be released back into the world. However, given how destructive one has been so far, we probably won't hunt down the other bloodstones until we have a way to regulate and purify the magical balance, such as a benevolent Elder Dragon (or equivalent entity).
---
But that's a ways off still, it seems.
---
Exactly, that's why I'm asking what is is for, or was maybe before updates.
---
weaver is a tricky class to begin with, ele has 4 attunements, each with its own set of weapon skills &amp; associated cooldowns. adding weaver into the mix adds 4 more dual skills you need to keep a rough cool-down timer in your head &amp; makes for a higher learning curve. 
---
adding dagger &amp; unravel into the mix further complicates this concept by adding an option to fully attune to elements as opposed to dual skills for 5 seconds, as well as granting a boon &amp; resetting the global attunement icd of 4 seconds(3.5 traited), while this makes unravel an extremely powerful tool \~ it also makes the class vastly more complicated to play. I'll give an example of what happens through a rotation burst I like:
---
1. (air/fire attunement to start)
---
2. lightning touch (weakness for 15% crit chance &amp; fury)
---
3. ring of fire (burn application)
---
4. plasma burst (initial opener burst &amp; blast finisher)
---
5. unravel (this brings you into air/air &amp; reset your global attunement cool-downs)
---
6. updraft (for CC to ensure this next skill lands)
---
7. Fire attunement (your now in fire/fire since you casted the swap while unravel is still in effect)
---
8. burning speed
---
9. flame grab
---
thats one way i do that combo, but the thing about D/D weaver is its so impossibly open-ended you can perform different variations of this combo by being in fire/air, or earth/water &amp; instantly go into fire/fire in a split instant to  hit somebody with burning speed.
---
 fun way of putting it is like having a rubix cube for a controller. You'll see in the video I posted that unravel is not to be used on cool-down, it's to be used tactically, where the player thinks it will make the largest impact on a fight.
---
I've been playing D/D weaver since a month after PoF dropped, &amp; almost exclusively since the dagger buffs &amp; unravel change, I still screw up by making bad anticipations &amp; fat fingering combos. Your probably gonna be frustrated with it at first, but patience &amp; practicing it will leave you with a build that has a lot of tools, that can be as good or as bad as you want it to be, particularly in wvw roaming.
---
If you plan on using it in spvp, thats different. It still works, but has more noticeable flaws due to decreased stats from the nerf to celestial amulet. I've fought plenty of top 100 pvp players with it &amp; have won. Even some of my guildies who are in the \[love\] AT team (general jenkins/the mighty lubu/thane/clown/drydude) who are top 10 players regularly, i've seen good results against.
---
 Not saying that the build performs any specific role that spvp requires at a meta level, but if i had to relate it to something, I'd say it would compete closely with holosmith in function. 
---
pros: very versitile, high mobility, top tier damage
---
cons: you are your own worst enemy if you mess up a rotation, can be focused down with large power damage if evade frames are used poorly. vulnerable to boon strip.
---
Still missing explanation of Interrupts. :(
---
Though including Break Bar is good enough.
---
Hmm, I don't know man. Thinking about it again, i guess you're right. It's just that we're talking about the nature of the world here, how magic works in the world of Tyria, so I feel that it is reeeally hard to actually affirm anything in this matter.
---
I'm getting there.
---
My motivation to log in the game every day is wearing thin. I feel like I've done (almost all) the endgame content that interests me, and I think I've reached the point of diminishing returns for the amount of effort that logging in requires. Especially because I know there's other games strongly competing for my time with tighter, more novel experiences.
---
I'm somewhat interested in seeing where the story goes, but in the absence of any sort of development roadmap or an idea as to when to expect the next release (aside from it being announced between one and two weeks before launch), then how can I keep being excited about the game?
---
And as for things becoming samey, I get that too. There's many members of the community trying to keep things fresh by holding their own events to keep people playing. I've not engaged directly with ArenaNet on such things for a while, but if the current community party planners have any sort of similar relationship with them that I had in 2015/16, then I can say that ArenaNet doesn't really do a lot to support such initiatives during the times where they're busy developing the next release.
---
Yeh and all this is fab and all; but wasn’t it a really clumsy story telling convention they fell into?
---
Like they wanted to make a big bad, so we had the dragons. Then we had to go after one of our own gods cause he turned into a twat.
---
Then they decided all of this was too simple and wanted to add jeopardy to the planet from us killing the dragons. That if we killed too many, the balance of magic in Tyria would be lost forever and signal the end of tyria.
---
So we’re now at a point where we’re stuck with a bunch of dragons being pricks, that we can’t really kill anymore. Which is fine.... but the way the magic system works in tyria is really bloody sketchy.
---
Like it’s confirmed that the elder dragons ooze magic. Theirs no proof that they ooze out all the magic they consumed or if this is just a natural state of their being. Like I know that sounds pedantic. However for me it’s an important difference... are they vampires that feed on the magic of the planet to replenish their own strength, that diminishes because they just naturally exude magic OR do they exude so much magic, because they consume so much of it; like a leaky bag?
---
The reason that’s important to me; is that one speaks to a parasitic relationship, while the other is almost symbiotic. Also in the latter example it means the dragons can only ever give out a finite amount of magic, dependant on what they consumed. Whereas if they’re just magical vampires, exuding magic could just be part of their inherent properties, irrespective of consumption. Which means theoretically they could emit more magic than they actually consume, through some odd mechanism of generation. 
---
It’s all very convoluted and I still think they only did it, to force the narrative away from “let’s go kill all the dragons”
---
Either learn to adapt your playstyle or your build. With condis spam in the meta you need mass condie clears or the skill to avoid the high stacking combos or a balance of the two.  I can beat mirage consistently on my war ranger theif ele and holo. Without weakening myself against any other matchup, my advice is to learn to do the same
---
Awesome looking character and great art!
---
...
---
But did you *have* to call him "boy" when referring to black history month?
---
Please make a video of wiping in fractals from birds and put this song in it 
---
I'd prefer sand shark
---
Do they even have black people?
---
https://psdh.eu/index.php?page=psdh_calendar
---
They pretty regularly get smash the dragon done.
---
My friend suggested I start Aurora too, but man it seems like such a daunting expensive task 😅
---
Nice! I was so hardcore into fractals for such a long time that I had no choice but to do this. I actually wish I could make WoE but I don’t like playing PVP so I probably won’t ever get it 😓
---
What about Hydra? The npc soulbeast was wanting to tame one. The first time I read that dialogue I chuckled and went "Well, that soulbeast chasing hydras just got beat."
---
I like female sylvari the most, human male is my 2nd favorite.
---
The only support class you can play without expansions is warrior with banners. They deal fairly high damage. However, if all you’re going to do is open world, any class will do enough damage. 
---
I’m not sure you can do any raids or fractals with just the base game. If anything, possibly fractals, and then the only class that can work in t4 with base skills is warrior—but even then you’ll be expected to go spellbreaker when there are certain instability days. 
---
Besides the "all" part of the devouring possibly being a hyperbole, those are indeed facts as far as we know.
---
What i would like to do is bring up to your attention how a lot of these facts don't necessarily match up with previous established lore. A few examples off the top of my head:
---
- Abaddon supposedly gave magic to the world and was punished for it. Not /necessarily/ (but probably) a contradiction but it also makes us ask whether or not this cycle has been in place for as long as we think.
---
Additionally, the Bloodstones were supposedly made by the gods for humanity to better control magic. From our latest sources, the Bloodstones were made by the Seers and the Mursaat to hide away magic from the EDs.
---
- Souls have been established to be magic under a specific form. But when one of our known races die, including dragons (Glint), these souls are displaced to another realm. Additionally, it's implicit that when one of our known races is born, then their souls (and thus magic) are introduced back into Tyria. This make our supposedly set and finite amount of magic open to some weird fuckery. For example, in theory, the amount of magic in our realm drastically increased when the Forged were being made, since the souls powering them were drained from the UW.
---
With that said, I think it would be more correct to say that magic is finite within the Mists.
---
All that to say that in the end, our latest sources will most likely end up being the right ones as the story is being shaped by the writers to go in the direction that they want. It's just a shame that they couldn't make it fit with the beautiful world and lore that GW1 had already established.
---
Judging by the content of that subreddit, I disagree. 
---
yeah i wasn’t trying to be racist at myself. i was saying in sort of a fun meme way 
---
Looks great, and handsome. 
---
Nice!
---
Oh man. The feeling when you put up some harmless art of your character and try to just add bit of African flare and people start sending you borderline racist messages.  
---
Found him and get the armor names thank you.
---
Too tired to ~~enjoy anything after~~ work... 
---
Junundu? No no no no. Why set our sights so low? EVOLVED OR BUST!
---
Right after we get reasonable content release cadences. ^K,thx,bye

Apex legends is pretty good though maybe you can just be chill and let people play the games they like

---
Hopefully every 3 months. Realistically once a year or two. 
---
sitting only in fire is no staff rotation. damage is maximised in a not so simple rotation between fire earth and air. and what a shock, you have to be in melee range since they just simply run towards you out of the (aoe)damage.  
---
on power sword weaver you do not use earth and you are in water only for 1 skill to instantly double tap into air via freshair.  
---
the rota there is quite simple since its the usual air -&gt; fire -&gt; fire -&gt; water -&gt; air (doubletap) with always using conjoures / glpyhs in the same place when on fireair.  
---
dunno what you are on about. enemies die to weaver in no time. but after reading your other comment i can already see that you can't really play weaver. having defensive gear on a class which has a 10 second blind. lul.
---
I think a dev mentioned that they wanted to add sand shark but they cut it because if you're not on sand it would look super derpy. 
---
Forget the sand wurm.
---
\[Ebelek Eze is trying to merge with a HYDRA\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebelek\_Eze](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebelek_Eze)).

I want to merge with my mounts and gain cool griffon powers most of all.
---
you can edit your post but you can’t edit your sins 
---
Istan and AB meta. 
---
I really LOVE the male sylvari voice actor, there is so much emotion without it feeling overacted in any way. It's by far my favorite from the rest of the characters, it just somehow stands out the most.
---
You can flip tier 5 materials to tier 6 for profit. Easy way to earn gold if you have limited time to play. All you need is starting investment and spirit shards. I funded my legendary weapons with that method.
---
Tbh it's the little things like this where Anet could have easily done something else but instead they put the effort in where other devs would not have  that makes me love them. It turns these little things like environment art, flying, mounts, and world exploration, into these hugely influential parts of the game. Take mounts for example they could have easily done it like any other mmo but they didnt and it turned the mount feature from such a small thing into probably one of, if not the best features of path of fire
---
New minion elite spec confirmed
---
Alright so here is my condi mirrage. I can tell you I beat nearly everyone I come across.

It's a meme of how cancer it is and it doesn't take too much skill to play.

Traits: https://i.imgur.com/Mo3g5gA.jpg
---
For the Chaos line: 
---
* [Master of Manipulations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_Manipulation) super good for Blink and Arcane Thievery recharge + mirror for reflecting all those pew pew.
---
* [Chaotic Dampening](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaotic_Dampening) for the staff recharge and protection.
---
* [Bountiful Disillusionment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Disillusionment) amazing for securing those stomps, use the F2 a lot to get that 150 condi damage from Vigor
---
For the Dueling Line:
---
* Decoy or I use [Phantasmal Fury](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phantasmal_Fury). The fury is meh but I always get revealed by the stealth from Decoy
---
* [Evasive Mirror](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evasive_Mirror) again, more reflect is great. Lots of Longbow rangers out there, deadeyes
---
* [Deceptive Evasion] is the choice for that clone production. Always be dodging
---
For the Mirage Line: 
---
* [Renewing Oasis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Renewing_Oasis) love that lowered condi duration time. 
---
* [Mirage Mantle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage_Mantle) protection is always good I guess
---
* [Infitite Horizon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Horizon) **THIS** is the trait, everytime you do your Ambush skill, your clones do it too. This is the main source of your damage. 
---
I use **Staff** and **Sceptor**/Torch. Some people use Axe torch but I love the Sceptor 2 block and the Sceptor 3 beam does a like 3-4k damage + the confusion&gt;
---
**Staff Ambush** [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex) (staff 1)  skill is a MAIN source of damage. You + 3 clones doing this sends purple balls of damage to your opponent.  You get like 12 stacks of bleeding torment and some confusion in there while you dance around your target
---
**Staff**
---
Staff 2 ([Phase Retreat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phase_Retreat)) is great to get you out of range of your target, Staff 4([Chaos Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Armor)) is great for when melee enemies are on you. Staff 5 ([Chaos Storm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Storm)) also limits people from coming close to you. Doing staff 2 ([Phase Retreat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phase_Retreat)) while in the Staff 5's ([Chaos Storm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Storm)) field is a great combo to give you chaos armor (basically staff 4)
---
**Sceptor/Torch**
---
Sceptor 2 is a block that u should use very often. Super easy to get a free block. just hold it out and it summons a clone who applys 5 stacks of torment to the enemy. VERY Useful, use it often. Use Sceptor 3 to hit people at a long range that does 3-5k dmg. 
---
**Torch 4 and 5 both have fire skills that require you to be pretty dang close to the person.** Torch 4 explodes fire around you after 3 sec so be close to the person if u want to use it offensively.
---
Torch 5 does flame damage up close when you activate it so try to stand close to the enemy.

Your ambush skill (that is revealed when you dodge) is ... "okay". it is called [Ether Barrage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ether_Barrage). I prefer to use staff 1's ambush skill for a lot of damage.
---
Utilities: https://i.imgur.com/ZDruxyq.jpg
---
* [Illusionary Ambush](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusionary_Ambush) This is skill is amazing. Take you + 3 clones and randomly put you around your target breaking their target WHILE giving you access to your ambush skills.
---
* Blink - obviously has its advantage
---
* [Arcane Thievery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Thievery) I have to have this one. Low cool down, send 3 condis, steal 3 boons, 4 sec of quickness **AND** 2 seconds of mirror.  unblockable at 1200 range!
---
Mmm boon stealing. send that reaper's chill back to them.
---
and of Jaunt is nice, it can get you up to some ledges as a smol blink, 1 condi clear and some condi dmg.
---
**Stats**: 
---
Trailblazer everything (armor, weapon, trinkets). (expensive)
---
**Runes of Tormenting**
---
WvW Malign Infusions. Energy sigils on both torch and staff. The rest is up to you. Cleansing, bursting tormenting sigils work.
---
**Playstyle** 
---
It is so cancerous (be prepared for salty PMs) because get 3 clones, dodge and use your [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex) so you and your clones shoot out 4 chaos vortex orbs.
---
Dodge again and do the same thing
---
Then use Illusionary ambush and do the same thing while removing their target on you.
---
The bleeds and torment stack up so fast. Just dance around and use your ambush skills like [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex).
---
Norn is worst, human is just human and always sounded meh but i at least have my headphones on when i play and can listen. Best is still all sylvari and asura. Charr is kind of ok except for the spitting but it is better then norn :)
---
Lmao, angry white guy much?
---
Racist much?
---
My life over the past year. 
---
10am-8pm work. 
---
8pm-8:30pm power nap while on Discord with guildies. 
---
8:30pm-3:30am gw2. Even if we're parking on game while playing stupid music or CAH. 
---
Worth it. Lol
---
Actually it seems less daunting as it seems. The first Collection asks you to do "(map name) master", which needs to complete nearly all the achivements of the lw s3 map + gather some items by killing bosses or doing events. They are easier as they seems, i did nearly 1 master per day. Draconis mons is the most difficult as it asks you to complete a loooong item (wayfarer henge), so i'd suggest you to start buying druid runestones. You'll need a ton. You can buy 5 per day, so try doing the hearts each day in order to buy them while you do the other maps master 
---
Well I mean, as far I know, in American history. White people didn’t have the identity beaten from them for years, have laws in place that said they were less than human or have their native language, culture and roots almost expunged. Black history isn’t just about “Oh look at all the cool stuff these African Americans did.” It’s to also acknowledge the fact that we almost didn’t even have a history or a culture. 
---
It boggles my mind whenever I even mention the premise of black history month or MLK jr day alone, people automatically get offended or enraged. It’s just people celebrating their culture and things that happened in the past to make nation a little more equal not just for black people but other minorities. Like, why are you mad at that?
---
Only reason to be silent is when you've nothing to say none of which is encouraging or good for the game's health. This same nonsense occurred during the last gap prior to HoT, we all know how well that went. Perhaps Anet needs to take a lesson from some of the bigger companies like Blizzard, Activision and EA and not try sit in the shadows hoping the s... doesn't hit the fan. Communities need to know what's happening to keep them engaged and the silence only fuels rumors and negativity, none of which is good for a company. I can honestly say i miss Mike O' and his interaction, Mike Z on the other hand seems way too much like Colin J. keeping things too close to the chest.
---
Heavily depends on the way of gathering said map resources. If they are plants you can harvest from a sickle, or just contained in a cache, the droprate is 100%. However, Mining nodes and Lumbering node tend to have a random (low in my experience) droprate, where the hearts always give you 5 of the currency. (Some events in some maps too)
---
Male Sylvari and male/female Asura VAs are my favourite, I don't play any other races/genders because of that.
---
Only to apoplectic morons 
---
Take your logic out of here!
---
Looks like someone has drawn a fanfic or two.
---
I'm not American so unfortunately I can't relate. Also I'm not enraged or offended. I'm just baffled by the fact you need a month to "celebrate" it. You can celebrate it every day of your life by implementing traditions in your daily life.  
---
What's in the past is in the past, right now you have all the freedom to take those African traditions and do something with it. Problem is though that there's no such thing as "Black History". That's such a gross oversimplification that you're doing your ancestors a great disservice.  
---
Personally I think it's really typically American, all you see is the history of people of African descent IN AMERICA.
---
I remember reading somewhere that it was originally planned to be a pet, but due to how Sandsharks travel, if the platform they were on was too thin, they would stick out the bottom and it would look really awkward. Probably why we don't have any wurm pets either, sadly.
---
First time i even heard of gw2. I have this number for 10+ years.
---
I'm not angry, just baffled at the stupidity of this "Black History Month". It's put into words pretty well by Morgan Freeman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0p_pQ7PTYU&amp;ab_channel=FappyMeals
---
To be fair, it was probably the owner of the accounts number at the time of signing up for the Two Factor Authentication and he probably got a new carrier/phone number and this guy got his old one.
---
Can this cause me any trouble? Like any costs?
---
And got several job offers from affirmative action employers thereafter, which was pretty abhorrent.
---
This answer is perfect.
---
Thank you for your time!
---
Just because one famous black dude disagrees with it doesn’t make this Month or the reason it’s a thing, any less valid. You or anybody else can put a black face in a high place and let him say anything to use as a strawman or some excuse to help you emphasize with you discomfort for minority acceptance.
---
 But, that’s one of the most basic practices of racism and that’s call Tokenism. The only person lowering said bar is yourself. This is literally harmless celebration and just some guy sharing a picture of his GW2 character. If you REALLY didn’t like it, then you had the option to keep scrolling.
---
I approached the world of gw1 the 25th of december of so many years ago, probably 12. One of My christmas gift was gw nightfall. I was totally fascinated by it, being My first online game. I played that game so long, and bought all the expansions. Elona was a piece of art both visually and in the storyline. I loved margonites and their design and loved the concept behind the realm of torment.
---
So many good memories related to guild wars. I'm a bit sad that Gw2 can't give me the same thrill of Gw1. Maybe a grew up? Maybe i'm feelingless? Who knows... 
---
Yeah, tbh I just read the summary on the Wikipedia, so take it with a pinch of salt.
---
I think my phone was busy being smarter than me ;)
---
They fall into the same genre, and yes I realized that the game was built to be different. I am just saying it fails to deliver. Naw you arent feeding the troll. I am authentically disappointed in almost ever design decision and I've been playing since release.
---
Isn't it same now? You don't have to worry about any schedules. 
---
Login anytime, create/join LFG with certain requirements, wait till group is filled, get the stuff done, game over, you can logout now. 
---
I'm doin raids and CMs+T4 like that all the time. Well recently started to do raids with "monday clear static", cuz it's more fun to raid with mates. 
---
That’s not what I said. I just said he put my thoughts into words quite well. 
---
You are the one who made it about the whole black guy thing. That’s why I always say, the people that claim they’re fighting racism are usually the racists. You see color everywhere.  
---
And given your opinion and also mentioning BHM it’s clearly not “just some guy sharing his character”. You’re pushing a political agenda here. And if you are you can expect people with a different opinion to express it.
---
If a build requires your group to be bad in order to be useful then it's not really a meta build. I do agree that heal scourge for example can be very useful, but that's not meta.
---
Pug meta is as much of a thing as open world meta.
---
Ha okay I missed that.
---
Not enough. Valentine’s Day maybe over for me, but not for my OC. 
---
&gt; It used to be fun if you didn't tryhard.
---
Yeah, you could just do stuff *considerably faster* ( = more efficiently) with good play vs. with a 5-necro party. But either was fun in its own merit.
---
I was talking about scheduling your gameplay. 
---
Regarding instabilities rework: agree, it's terrible. Many of them simply annoying.
---
joke is not a sin, soft skin on the other hand...
---
mind sharing the build? I would like to see what you are using
---
You can do metagaming for each content, each objective, meta depends on the objective you wanna achieve too: just like fractal speedclear meta is not simply taking half a speedclear raid meta composition (or the other way around), PUG safe kill meta does not have all the same attributes as the speedclearing one.
---
It does not require bad players to be useful, it also works with average players as a safety net: nobody's perfect and if you do make a mistake at some point it's nice to be able to smoothly recover when you mostly want the kill. And do you know who also used Support Scourge during W6 discovery? A lot of top guilds, because it provides a safety net and it was needed/useful even for them at this time: it's also part of the discovery meta.
---
What Nike is doing with the "meta event builds" for example is some kind of metagaming applied to open word meta-events where you know you will have a lot of random people with "unique" builds and playstyles.
---
But if you're on the side of "meta only means the thing that kills the boss the fastest" then I'm not willing to get in yet-another-discussion of what "meta" means (because that would also mean this thread was started by me using a different definition as you and thus any further discusiion would probably be fruitless as we do not use the same point of reference).
---
Can't be the case because OP states:
---
&gt; I have this number for 10+ years.
---
You've never heard of Arenanet but you play Guild Wars 2. How does that make any sense.
---

---
My friends today have Wakanda. I will always have Elona. 
---
&gt;In majority of cases
---
In majority of cases these people talking do not understand what meta means because they have not been doing metagaming, like ever (or have not realised they had done metagaming at some point).
---
THefrefore you (and some other) do not understand what meta (ie. metagamming) actually means and put a wrong meaning on it (which is pretty close to saying that meta means "most efficient tactic available" :p).
---
&gt;Why would anyone ask about those though? 
---
Because they are parts of the game, metagaming takes into account the parameter that you have (ie. you want a safer kill, you want a safety net, you want to improve overall DPS of a big open world squad while also dealing good DPS while taking into account the random people that are in those squads, etc) to create solutions/builds/strats/whatever.
---
But as I said, not gonna go and explain what metagaming actually means when you favourite search engine can do that for you.
---
&gt; Solo money making? 
---
Probably best doing smuggling runs for the Hutts in the outer rim territories. 
---
Oh wait, wrong Solo.
---
But if you want safer kill you can run 5 healers and never die. Is that meta too? If there's meta for every aspect then what's the point of meta even existing? 
---
No problem here whasoever. They trigger consistently every 20 seconds while in combat.
---
It is. There are lots of core Tyria Mastery points, but they're harder. You have to do stuff like all the Silverwastes ones. The ones from Triple Trouble (make sure you find a guild doing it, big guilds do this content every day, but not all day).
---
Also, there are 9 communes scattered throughout Tyria, you can find them listed in the general section of achievements under mastery insights.
---
Fractal ones are good too.
---
The amount of ppl that want this mans dick is astounding. And I'm one if them. 
---
Not only in HoT to be honest...
---
How about no.
---
And female sylvari, I love it!
---
Hahaha, one can dream.
---
Enter in Discord: https://discord.gg/tMzwrqx
---
The wiki has lists of all releases if you want to get a more accurate average, but 3 months seems about right.
---
Another episode, but chapters are slow to release anyways. The last one came out on January 8th so don't expect anything till March 8th at the earliest but probably closer to April.
---
Ditto. I also really appreciated that they made these styles all available without the gemstore item. I think they understood that it would look pretty bad if making a black character look good was a special edition thing behind a paywall when we can all make realistic looking white or asian characters already. 
---
Well, there are dredge digging through their grid-like structures since the game's release (you know, their melee guys with that digging charge) and there's the sonic tunneling tool in the novelty section, enabling every player to do so, but when a sand shark does that, it's not ok all of a sudden.
---
Again, you are directly resorting back to a juvenile whine of nothing amounting more than a toddler saying "no u." You took exactly what I said, slightly re-phrased it, and then just tried to use it as a counter-argument. Not only are you incapable of said logic, you can't even produce a suitable and appropriate, intelligent criticism of what is in front of you. 
---
Well yes, you can do that, but I'd still suggest a training guild/discord. Those usually have no li requirements and the explanations are done in voice by knowledgeable people.
---
You can also think that as a way to get yourself more experience leading and organising groups. The training guild I am still in allows anyone to gather and command groups, there are experienced leaders ready to advice and mentors to help with classes. 
---
Ofc not, first you should ask reddit for help. Read the post, he never heard of arenanet, and the message isnt even shown in his messages. Only in mine as in sent from his number.
---
Could someone be using my number deliberatly? Is there anyway someone could gain smth by this? 
---
Oh yeah. Worth 2000g
