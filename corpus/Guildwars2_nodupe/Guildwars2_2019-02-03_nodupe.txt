Thanks, I hate it

That all comes from practice and common sense. You want to use your aoes for mobs, but save the big cooldowns for the boss (unless boss isnt coming up any sooner). You want to save your burst for breakbar on bosses (breaking it gives you I think 25% more damage for 5 seconds)
---
&gt; I'd stay away from GS and learn the pDPS rotations.
---

---
Domi GS, hello?
---
Whoa there friend! Hold something back.
---
I disagree, if they actually said something like we're coming out with a new expansion or X feature players would get excited at the game feeling still alive. 
---
&gt; but devs definitely moved on to something else
---
I don't think that's the case. The resources are there, they're just being wasted on "cool flashy moments", which isn't bad per se. The problem is that they spend a lot of resources on little content.
---
If you want an example, GW2 spends the whole budget on 5 minutes of explosions, instead of smaller less flashy things that last far longer.
---
Wildly accurate in multiple levels across time and space.
---
Some people love creating new threads to reply to other threads instead of, you know, posting on ]those actual threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/amdqwm/what_the_hell_happened_to_primordus_size)...
---
 /r/Grenbur plsssss
---
The existing WvW players not shitting on anyone who dares come into their game mode.
---
On the 3 servers (Northern Shiverpeaks, Ring of Fire, Blackgate) I have tried it has been a serious problem.
---
Imagine thinking a game mode is bad because you can't shit talk people. 
---
I'd still stay away from it.  These aren't experienced players so there's too much a chance of forming bad habits. It's more important they learn how to melee imo. With GS there's always the problem of it's incredibly weak aa chain. 
---
I did not miss that, actually.
---
That also has nothing to do with "gw2" vs "wow" being fucking dumb.
---
Guild wars2 is also not the only game which uses gw2 as abbreviation so...
---
Guess they need to stop banning people for no reason then lol
---
Okay, interesting. That's pretty cool that they reach out to that community.
---
I don't know if it explains the screenshots coming out before the patch hits, though.
---
Mute the toxic folk, have a few drinks and enjoy the chaos.  It's easier to handle when you stop caring so much.
---
&gt; Sun's Refuge
---
What? We know that, surely? It's being used as a temporary base of operations for the pact in that part of Elona, after being used by the Sunspears during Nightfall. I'm not sure if it was ever implied it would be anything else.
---
This is going to sound crazy, but I've seen this solution come up here before with a new computer build - are you sure your computer is using your graphics card?
---
Most motherboards these days have on-board graphics (which are usually good enough for non-gaming purposes, and will in some cases even run some games quite well). It's possible you may be using the on-board graphics instead of your actual graphics card.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66904/about-the-mount-bug-not-loading-and-character-stuck-sitting-in-the-ground-a-band-aid-solution
---
&gt;There's speculation that...
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
I had assumed up until this point it was going to be revealed before now. My theory, which is kinda baseless, is that ANet didn't realise how much the mystery would grab people, and their original plan for the identity of E would be underwhelming given fan reaction, so they've just decided not to reveal it.
---
I still want more mention of Zojja in-game somewhere, just so it doesn't feel like she's been forgotten lately. Especially with the last couple of episodes... some reference to her would have been very appropriate.
---
It's an interesting detail about how those Mordrem and Blighting pods worked, though. I can do something with that tidbit of information.
---
im not blaming anyone, im reporting what happened
---
&gt;Guilds have no dev working on them
---
do we have Guilds in gw2? :O
---
Currently trying out quickbrand, which is better to gear for fractals?
---
Yeah, him specifically, all rich people should just send him one gold, while wearing a com tag iirc
---
You can get them from achievement chests, but that takes a long time.
---
Only trust the statics you rigged yourself.
---
Bullshit, with achievements it's way above 3 hours of content.
---
Meg needs to be way uglier, and Lois needs to be hotter with the red lipstick face. The Brian needs to look way more like an asshole and Stewie needs to be shorter. Lois needs to be taller as she is almost as tall as Peter. 
---
Call it what you will but I assure that in any pvp it's really possible to lose 10 times in a row and not be the bad factor in all of those losses....you just have to take a look at the average player and you'll see what I mean...there's a reason people say only 1-5% of the people actually do raids.
---
In addition to enjoying the challenges it poses, in my case I can't really structure my life around the game and am not really interested in structuring my play around others, nor would I want or expect others to do so for me. Scoffing at the "recommended party size" not only lets you feel like an **absolute badass**, it lets you accomplish your play goals on your timetable.
---
This means less time trying to form groups and less negative experiences outside of a player's control. I don't want to play GW2 to make friends or learn valuable life lessons or develop my social skills. I want to kill all the things and get all the things. Looking good doing it is nice. Having the **option** of doing it with others is also nice. Only being able to do it when other people feel like showing up and sticking around to the end is decidedly less nice.
---
Someone bitch.. block right away... you might lose... but it'll be peaceful
---
I get the idea but Google search trends aren't exactly active player numbers. They can hint at certain tendencies but that's about it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stop giving a fuck about what other people say. As long as there are people to play with it doesn't matter how big that number is. Nobody except Arenanet(or Blizzard in the case of WoW for that matter) knows the actual numbers anyway.
---
So very much this. I swear Brawn of Koda is the only heavy armour chest in the entire game that manages to be neither overly bulky or weirdly revealing.
---
I have 2 questions:
---
1) Playing with my friend and he only has the free trial (I have both expansions). When leveling up, I can get some hero points, but for some reason he says he can't get hero points. There are some in the Sylvari starting zone that I can get, but he can't. Is that a free trial limitation?
---
2) When does the game go on sale usually? My friend wants to buy both expansion packs? 
---
I did some looking into this after it was recommended and the general consensus seems best summed up by Snow Crows.
---
&gt;Power Chronomancer has a high learning curve and is primarily recommended for people who enjoyed playing Condition Engineer in the past. This is because the rotation is fast paced and not easily learnt by beginners. 
---
It seems to have a high payout, so keep at it!
---
Your end game is not the same as everyone elses. 
---
good question, imo I have no idea if it would matter that much as there are a lot of people WvW dedicated \^\^
---
Not is yours so if you want raids and shit go back to wow or even better ffxiv where raids drop every month but most of them actually take a few hours for people to start farming them, speaking from experience on this one. 
---
That Stewie asura made me lol :D
---
Everything you do currently will have an impact in the future. Screw hard resets every xpac. 
---
Can you show stats that actually matter? 
---
You know, like player count?
---
No? Then take your misleading stats to CNN.
---
I did not, if you look at the huge difference between the two searches it’s because the term wow encompasses the word too not just the game therefore giving false impression about how much the difference actually is. 
---
It's not "No, we won't do it" - it's more like "*At this point in time* we couldn't give a fuck, maybe later".
---
AnetBenP frequently comes to my stream and has spoken regarding the bots. He provided no dates or to what extent, but did express they were working to remove them from play. Report them and aid them in this process.
---
Red seems surprisingly reasonable and respectful (and, probably, kinda green, he looks too soft for me), yellow is likely a complete noob, blue is one of those blocking autists that can't comprehend chat/take stress and just want that everybody be quiet regardless of what is happening.
---
Overall I give this NA, low gold out of 10.
---
- More dynamic fluid combat
---
- No RnG dependencies in gearing
---
- PvP is way fuckin better (PvE isn't tho imo, I miss mythic raiding)
---
- The casual element of not feeling left behind after not farming mythic+ 24/7
---
No idea, I moved to another server few days ago. 
---
lmao using cuck 2 times and friendzone in the same sentence I'm sure you are an expert in relationship stuff
---
Combat is more dynamic, I like Sylvari as a race, and there are more opportunities to play solo.
---
Oh, and it doesn't have subscription model, even if you can literally buy mats, currencies and gold for $$$.
---
GW2 raids take a few hours for people to get the tactics down. Try comparing the first Qadim CM kills with anything approaching an end boss at Mythic difficulty in WoW.
---
The sad thing is, Guild Wars 2 could easily have far more healthy raids if the balance team weren't ridiculous in their approach to unique boons and Chronomancer and were more content to reuse assets beyond boss models. An easy mode would also help (one reason why FFXIV and WoW raids are seen as better) since at least then the spending of resources on raids is validated by more players seeing and engaging in the content.
---
Both WoW and FFXIV learnt from the raiding content 101 stuff taught by EQ and early WoW. GW2 and Anet haven't. 
---
This is very nice!
---
&gt; Draconis Mons
---
I mean, you could absolutely be right with the scale of that one. In terms of its height as could be estimated by the height of the internal map, that's gotta be one of the tallest mountains in-game. Or at least the one most resembling an actual mountain in terms of sheer size.
---
&gt; Especially if the Great Destroyer, a mere dragon champion, was causing earthquakes *in Cantha.*
---
Well there's a difference between spreading one's destructive forces (physically sending hordes of Destroyers to cause earthquakes) and being the sole cause of the earthquakes personally. I don't think they elaborate in-game.
---
But if any entity is single-handedly causing earthquakes that far apart, they must be *massive.* Like, they-would-have-no-problem-tearing-the-world-to-shreds massive.
---
&gt; "we never said that statue was Primordus, it could have just been another dragon champion"
---
That's honestly ridiculous. It's simple math putting the pieces together that spell out that the statue was Primordus. That's like saying Darth Vader wasn't actually Luke's father. They just both happened to have pasts that line up convincingly to make them both believe they're related. *Just wait until you see Luke's REAL father!*
---
&gt; while the old model looked truly unique and a bit eldritch with the tendrils.
---
It totally does. We better get some eldritch dragons real fast. The horror of the large only lasts so long. We need the horror of the freaky to keep this going.
---
&gt; give the opportunity to make something smaller without retconning his appearance.
---
I just don't know what to even expect for dealing with a dragon that big. I *want* to see more than just its snout, but if it's that big mclarge mchuge, I sincerely doubt we'd be able to get anything other than another head-battle. Honestly a smaller dragon that's simply more powerful/cunning/malicious would probably be more terrifying (and way more interesting).
---
I was really hoping Mordremoth would turn out looking [like his concept art](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Dragon_15_concept_art.jpg) with the tail being rooted in the Heart Of Thorns or something to make it feel more natural and connected with the world. *Like a necessary part of the All rather than a pug-faced snake-dragon.* Something like that would be ancient and bizarre and unsettling. And the GW1 Primordus fits that perfectly. Retconning it very likely ruined the natural-but-unnatural angle it could have had.
---
Thanks for easing it in
---
Oh sorry forgot about the achievements since I don't do them. But if you like them that's cool. And I'd rather that instead of getting a new map every episode we have longer living story episodes given that there old living story and POF maps are very quiet (except istan)
---
Neither.  You can get 100% Quickness with [full Zerk.](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand)
---
what drugs are u on, i did not refer to the video in my comment.

It's not their problem you don't do them since a lot of people do or else they wouldn't bother making them. 
---
Also: Thanks bro!
---
They were slaughtered like the animals they were. Glory to the empire!

were you in my match yesterday :D same thing happened to me

because of that comp we decided to play sides

Weekends are shit in all games because that is when the weekend warriors come out of the woodworks. The people with the shitty attitude that they don't have to put in their best game because the weekends are the only days they are not obligated to do their best since they have done so for the entire week during their shitty jobs. And now they finally have time for themselves because their kids are asleep and the woman is out of the house with friends and they can finally enjoy some of that free time they miss so much.
---
&gt;The real-world reason for Zojja’s continured absence, last I heard, was that her voice actress is taking a hiatus from work for family things. Not gone for good, just a break, which is probably why anet hasn’t been looking for a replacement or anything.
---
Despite if she is currently on hiatus or not. She has mentioned that she would have been happy to reprise Zojja, shes just wasn't asked to. 
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Alright, this is much more clear to me than what you initially wrote, thank you.
---
You monster.... 
---
You have an extremely warped perspective if you think trash talking your team is helping them, or the game. That sort of behavior drives people out of the PvP player base, it doesn’t motivate them to become better. This is just straight up selfish and misguided.
---
My best advice for someone who boosted without thinking: Go the the Asura starter level and cross all of core Tryia doing hearts, waypoints, PoIs, and hero challenges until you get 100% completion. The gear you were given (Probably Soldiers or Valkyrie?) will be fine for that.
---
While you're doing that research builds for your profession, do the Personal Story to break up the monotony, and then go into Verdant Brink and get your ass kicked within minutes. Don't feel too bad because all of us got our asses kicked the first few times we stepped into the jungle. Then take some kind Commander's offer to lead you through it.
---
dude
---
The devs actually treat us well and don't openly make fun of the player base.
---
downside: bountiful theft will only give you ONE stack of stability, no matter how many stacks you manage to remove from your target. in fact, it'll only give you one stack of any boon removed.
---
it's great, but not nearly effective enough for zerg situations. that one stack of stability won't be enough to save you.
---
&gt;when people say gw2 is dead 
---
Dead games don't put out new, fully voice-acted content three or four times a year.
---
Are you getting killed in the lower levels while still lugging around your level 80 gear?
---
It's stupid how this is always upvoted. The guy can easily play just as if he hadn't boosted. Play through starting zones with all skills available, rack up hero points. There's no downside to boosting. 
---
tfw you're experienced but just awful at navigating three dimensional spaces and doing puzzles
---
As someone who never played WoW, hard resets? 
---
Not just the men, but the women and children too
---
Oh right, I see. Thank you!
---
Looks like you missed the bottom graph "guild wars 2 vs world of Warcraft"
---
And now only need support for radial mount!!
---
portrait on character selection screen has problems on account of how everything is loaded. If you enable and disable (or vice versa) vsync on graphics menu all portraits show up.
---
You can complete dungeon tracks on pvp and wvw, making dungeon armor craftable would make dungeons even more dead... So please no
---
Except that you have to redo this every time. It won't fix it the first time you manage to do it. 
---
*Has flashbacks to pre-mount days when you could die running down stairs.*
---
It's a terrible map. If one team gets ahead or wins a team fight at mid, 90% of the time it is over and they can either spawn camp or grab every point because they are way too close to each other. The spawn gates are too close and go to the same place so when spawn camping happens there is no escaping it. The spawn rooms are too close and the map is too small leading to it being too easy to return to a team fight or decap/cap points, also further pushing how easy it is to spawn camp. Thieves have a field day here since it is so small and they can easily not only decap, but cap too. Everyone ignores the djinn event thing, it really does not do enough and I have yet to see it change the outcome of a team fight. I hope it never comes to ranked like spirit watch and champion's dusk. It just is not tuned well enough to be a competitive map. 
---
There's a few big things others have covered, and a lot of little things. But the biggest of the little things for me is character "maintenance." IE weeklies for artifact power, making sure I do a Mythic 10 on every character I want to play every week. Checking WQs for upgrades constantly for alts, making sure not to miss world bosses (and praying to RNG to get something usable). The feeling of being "behind" or holding my group back if I didn't farm M+ constantly as much gear as the people I was playing with.
---
I like swapping classes a lot, I play every class in GW. The mere idea of trying to maintain more than 3 characters in World of Warcraft in a playable state that can join my friends in group content is numbing.
---

1. Start the Path of Fire story and do the first mission so you have the raptor mount. 
---
2. Quit the above story line. Begin the Heart of Thorns story. Work through the first two stories and unlock basic glider skills. 
---
3. NOW quit the above and head back to your race starting zone. Follow the guided points until you complete all of the map achievements. By this point you should have a good feel for your class and the general game mechanics. 
---
4. Start your personal story and play it through completely. 
---
Trust me, you’ll thank me for 1. &amp; 2. above. 
---
Ignore all these other people chastising you for boosting. Especially if you chose Mesmer to boost. 
---
Enjoy!
---
Doing more than 1 spam.

I’m sorry! I know it’s the worst thing to tell someone to do, even writing it and thinking about that one vet smokescale by the noble camp in VB sends shivers down my spine

DECAP

This is wonderful advice for someone who has never had a decent laptop. Thank you very much! 
---
How come the guild wars website only sells the POF bundles? Does that mean HOT is out of the game or something? I am a new player.
---
what zone is that?
---
I promise you, at 1400LI you are no more experienced than I am at 600.
---
Istan, probably. I'd say the corsair area 
---
Brian and Stewie have seen some shit. They have that thousand-yard stare.
---
“Fight on point,” is the mantra of bronze-silver-gold players.
---
I am not sure what the score was when the red guy quit, but nothing he said seemed too toxic.
---
Also, judging from the comments, there were multiple Mirages and Soulbeasts on the other team. These are the most broken specs at the moment.
---
Because plants versus zombies garden wars 2 is probably a significant search item. 
---
Engi all the way! Not the most played class but once you learn the combos with the skills and the kits it so satisfying. 
---
Cursed image. How do I delete a game? 
---
I was in a similar scenario as you last summer. Didn’t play for a while and when I jumped back in there was just so much stuff. My suggestion to you would be to roll it back. You feel stuck because you’re trying to do stuff you aren’t meant to be able to do yet. Have you finished your personal story? Have you gone through the HoT or PoF story yet? How much exploration have you done? You’re trying to rush through your elite and mastery points when there is only so much you can get at a time. Go back to the stuff I mentioned and just play. All of that stuff you’re after will come to you naturally. You’ll get the mounts and the glider skills and the elite spec skills. All of it, but you can’t rush through it all in just a few hours the way you’re trying to.
---
As a UI design hobbyist, I'm a fan of this sort of design. If it simply stopped when full, you might not notice that your inventory's entirely packed out, and not have a clue why the auto-salvage stopped. Even if it popped open an empty "inventory full!" menu, you can be sure that someone will simply click it away and still not know why auto-salvage isn't working anymore.
---
It seems like a weird distinction, but the psychology behind UI design has to take into account how much information our brains simply erase or ignore as "irrelevant".
---
You can still buy HoT, it just doesn't have any bundle deals. You can add it to your cart when you add PoF, or you can buy it standalone [here](https://buy.guildwars2.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_IE&amp;SiteID=gw2&amp;cid=104%3A5%3A%3A%3A%3AGlobal%3A290%3A%3A%3A&amp;pbPage=heartofthorns&amp;themeID=4785548000)
---
Revenant, engineer, mesmer and ele are the most interactive classes imo because they have complex rotations and require a lot of improvisation when things aren't going smoothly.
---
Firebrand is up there too.
---
Ok another approach then
---
Take a player that boosts a character to 80: he logically has all traits and skills of the core class available to him. But he doesnt know the basics of the game in any way. In addition to that he doesnt know what the traits/skills he suddenly has do. He gets thrown into the „endgame“ just like that without knowing anything about the game or even his class that he boosted with the assumption that he may like it.
---
You tell that person to go through the starter zones where he will just do stuff but doesnt see any progress while doing so because he already is max lvl. I can assure you most players will be bored by doing so because it is in no way rewarding. They will skip to where all the „endgame“ stuff happens.
---
Instead that player could have started with a new character. He explores the starter zones and so on with visible progress, unlocks skills/traits by leveling, gets new weapons and armor. He will learn the basics of the game like the combat system or the way traits work and affect the character you play. While doing so he will be evaluating the class he plays and decide if he wants to play it all the way.
---
Telling people to just boost a character and then go play starter zones is in many ways misleading as they probably will have a harder time understanding the game maybe leading to the player disliking the game as even GW can be very overwhelming to a new player especially if he want to play solo like our friend in questions is.
---
Flock to meee^e^^e^^ee^^^^ee^e^^e^^!
---
The guy boosted and is asking for advice.
---
As much as you may obfuscate, this is not advice.
---
Leveling 1-80 is not a two hour thing.
---
Watching a YouTube video then rolling around a boosted toon can take about two hours to learn the basics skills.
---
Seriously, it's shit advice that I think is mostly aimed at getting noobs out of dungeons and fractals and it's nonsensical. Players have more at their disposal if they boost.
---
If you run illu/due dps chronos you can take the quickness trait in illu and just have one chrono giving alacrity or have no chrono with shield but distribute the alacrity responsibility. 
---
Something else to think about is that you can prestack a ton of quick and alac if everyone helps. So maybe you will only need a few soi’s on boss fights. 
---
I believe it's only like that if you choose the physique with the really large forearms because that scales weapons up slightly and unfortunately causes that clipping through the ground. The other physique options don't cause that to happen, or at least not as bad.
---
&gt; I am not sure what the score was when the red guy quit
---
Around 450 - 200
---
You can tell by checking the time of the message, and comparing with the time reward were distributed. There is only a 1 minute difference.
---
If assume 2 cap points are held, that is 2 points every 2 seconds, plus the points from kills. If we go by that 1 minute gap in time, then that is only 60 seconds. Meaning the enemy's score had to be around 440... which may seem like a reasonable time to ragequit when you are only 200. (Not that I haven't seen an epic turnaround once or twice.)
---
I'm red guy btw. 
---
Funny thing is this is why I quit GW2 when it came out, because I was all about getting those upgrades and trying to be the best on the server. 6 years later and I'm now a farther and have way less time to play, this is now a benifit to me and I've quit wow to come back to GW2 because of this.
---

Only things I miss about wow are world pvp ( which they kinda ruined anyway), and mythic dungeons (fractals don't scratch that itch for me). Oh and as wonderful as the ui is... Keeping track of my buffs and opponents buffs and tells is somehow much more annoying in this game. I feel a loss of precision there. And honestly the lore in wow is better but I love the gw2 teams different direction.  
---
In pretty much every other respect gw2 comes out ahead in all three game modes. Character customization in wow is BEYOND stone age graphically, lack of dodge, their need to re invent classes and specs every expansion, and the general sense that you aren't playing an mmo but another part time job just to keep up with everyone else. Eff the gear grind. 
---
Gw2 can be so much more immersive just messing around in Queens dale. I remember when wow had immersive magic but it's long since gone. 
---
I've gotten bored of playing Necromancer and I've been debating on whether playing Mesmer or Elementalist to level 80, but I heard both can be a pain to level (in different ways). 
---
  
---
It's kinda hard to figure out which one I want play. lol  
---
(also, I have neither expansion)  
---
 I do but not soon, for sure. To be honest, I don't think we'll get enough expacs before anet move on to fill up even Warrior's weapon set
---
Inspiring :D TY for posting :) 
---
I would've checked the things like 10 times over to see I didnt just randomly threw bunch of random gear in by accident. Gz!
---
Agreed
---
Man, that's such a bad excuse for fucking up what was canon in the game. Way to ruin everyone's hype after Eye of the North after like a decade.
---
Engineer, Holosmith tho. Guardian as well.
---
I feel bad, I got tired of being a Holo because I didn't do good and some people harrassed me in fracs because of it so I deleted. Now I want him back, but the grueling leveling process plus the increase in price of runes and sigils make it a no-go for my tight schedule :(
---
When farming for clovers go for the one at a time recipe instead of the 10 stack recipe that can save you some gold other than that The pack supply network can help you get some of your tier 6 mats 
---
This is already in the game. Desert highlands, the Waypoint where you get the bunny, I know because I've died there. So. Many. Times.
---
5 is not to be spammed. Daredevil is one with the highest dps class, probably you are doing it in the wrong way 
---
My theory is that it can actually be a bit binary, when it comes to relying on your team.
---
a) If your team knows what they're doing and makes optimal decisions, you can easily predict the positions of players and outcomes of fights, and thus devote more of your brainpower to playing well. This gets you great results.
---
b) If your team is noob, or even just slightly out of sync with your level of play, they'll do things that flabbergast you and your plays end up being suboptimal in light of your teammates' plays. You need to get around this by devoting substantial brainpower towards predicting your teammates' actions in addition to the enemy's. If you lack this skill, you'll suddenly have horrible games when you were dominating just an hour ago with a different team.
---
I can kind of see the source if frustration though: If we just won a team fight at mid, and an enemy is decapping home, I should be allowed to decap far as a thief and EXPECT two of my 4 idle team members to head home. I shouldn't have to account for the possibility of my reaper running around 20 seconds looking for the stealted scrapper who actually died 5 seconds ago.
---
\-Story. Blizzard clearly considers gameplay first and then shoves the story in the hole that fits the gameplay. This leads to a lot of retconning and characters changing drastically for strange reasons. Moreso, the player characters are just expected to be okay with everything that happens (on their side). Which is lazy writing (handwaving the possible consequences of important developments). Also, handing the idiot ball to the player characters and simply denying them a choice (I *believe* a dev even once said that players could then simply choose not to do that quest even though a lot of quests are linked so these players would then have to choose not to do not that one quest but all following quests as well).
---
This is especially the case for the broad strokes, the main story arcs - some minor quests and sidestories can actually be quite fun or good. And minor characters don't run as much risk of being sacrificed to the gameplay gods.
---
\-Character creation. This shouldn't require any explanation, even though I personally prefer WoW's artstyle.
---
\-Worldbuilding. It is sometimes said that certain MMOs are 'theme parks'. Comparing Guild Wars 2 and WoW, WoW really does come out feeling as a theme park. It just feels a lot more cardboard. Like a movie set. Moreso, the way the world is used - in WoW you rarely if ever return to lower level areas, even if said areas are important in the lore of various races. It feels like areas are.. 'used up'. This is highly connected to the leveling system in WoW (i.e: characters outlevel areas as they progress). While yes, in Guild Wars 2 people will flock to the latest content the rest of the world doesn't feel abandoned.

I really enjoyed auramancer tempest. Mitigating damage, condition cleanses, consistent healing, burst healing, might stacks, CC, all while managing cooldowns and chaining together pseudo-rotations depending on the circumstances. And a lot of this required tight attunement changes, dodges for blasts and decisions like, "do I want to change to earth for the sand squall and overload earth, or do I stay in water in case I need overload water soon?"
---
I had no intentions to read the Rytlock's story that just relased. But your voice and accent is so nice that im listening to it right now as i farm some materials around. Thanks for the video.  
---
You may want to do some videos about fall of ascalon, the searing, Rise of Orr. you name it. And do 10-15 minute lore videos about them with your soothing voice. It could act both as entertainment, Or some lore for the people to learn while they play the game on the background. Also it would maybe incrase your editing skills at one point and will build even more self confidence.  
---
So much stuff is account bound instead of soulbound. I can't play only 1 or 2 classes, i need to switch often to have fun. Being able to freely swap gear, switching classes in the middle of a raid, etc is huge for me

Well, it may have a little bit worse lore. But not denying gw2 has much better story, and better implemented one.

I get an error saying d3d12.dll is not found
---
Class balance and roles are very very different in pve and pvp, you don't have to main the same one in both modes. For example guardian is the best support in game in pvp but it's usually a dps in pve (although it can be support but it's less popular). I'd recommend making a support class for pve, and another support class for pvp (you can pvp at lvl2, it'll boost you to lvl80 and give you lvl80 stat gear as long as you're in a pvp area).
---
For PVE: lots of people are recommending chrono, it's true it will always be in high demand (27 different specs, but you almost always want 1/5 or 2/10 players to be chrono). But I really wouldn't recommend it if you're new, chrono needs to know mechanics (if you fail a dodge as dps, you go down. if you fail a block as chrono, your whole raid goes down).
---
Instead i'd recommend making a warrior, it's a hybrid dps/support role in PvE that's easy to gear, easy to play and always needed. You could also make a healer (druid is most needed but others are viable) but know you'll also be expected to know fights and do extra mechanics compared to dps.
---
Thank you!
---
The thing I like most is no group loot! no rolling need or greed! and not having to compete for resource nodes!
---
the only time I consistently found it fun was back when the server tournaments existed, competing for first place and multiple achievements. back then it actually felt like servers were populated and always having a queue just to get in. 
---
Even the old EoTM were exciting and even a matchmaking system that didn't require you to have a specific world so the map was always populated was fun and engaging for me, but since the weekly reward chests were introduced and not earnable there I've barely seen anyone venturing around there.
---
These days only motivation I have for WvW is gift of battle. 
---
I know, I'm speaking about Anet giving weak answers of which you can't determine a concrete standpoint
---
Great comeback!
---
I had a match like this on khylo the other night, losing by about 150-200 points all game, got a 3cap when the opposing team got greedy on our home point, at that point they were at ~450and we were at ~300, I rushed far and held a 2v1 for a minute or so until my teammates showed up, had our memser covering mid and home for decaps and we just perpetually stomped them at their home until we won.  
---
Such an awesome feeling. Plat tends to be hardcore blowouts, but all it takes is a bit of coordination and smart plays to turn it all around. Never say gg until the game is over boys.

What news for a game mode [already out?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hall_of_the_Mists)
---
Are you on Windows 10? If so, double check your graphics card and Windows updates are all up to date. Also check you've installed it or the correct folder etc. 
---
If not, you cannot use it the proxy uses technology that requires Windows 10. 
---
I play berserker Dagonhunter and nearly got it full asc. 
---
Now I want to play the new skilltree, Firebrand. I bought all the condition gear that was recommended (a build I found), the condi dmg really stacks up high but it‘s so far from what my DH dps nukes out. 
---
Also, i have close to zero sustain skills and get in downstate really fast. Am I doing something wrong? 
---
Second question, is firebrand heal skill more fun than the dps one?
---
I play mostly fractals and HoT/PoF Meta maps for farm
---
p2w smh
---
Story-wise I prefer them as the huge behemoths they are now.
---
Gameplay-wise, yeah I agree with you. I believe that is exactly what happened with Zaitan. He was meant to be much bigger, but they had to reduce his size to make it work in-game
---
I am struggling to understand how some people can perceive this as begging?
---
Are you folks the type of people that just leech and leech from your "friends" until that one day they ask you to buy them a coffee after having spent a hundred dollars on coffe for; and you loose your shit (and their friendship finally) ?
---
not latest arcdps i suppose
---
Could be cool, again I'm not opposed to the size of them and think it's genuinely cool that they are big. I remember seeing kralk in eotn while dormant and he looked huge. I know primordus has more or less been reimagined because he was a small dragon compared to now.
---
It does feel right imo. But I'm worried that they might have overdone the scale personally. That's all.
---
I'm not sure I'd like a map that takes place on the back of a dragon. But that's simply because I've never seen it before. So I'm open to the idea.
---
If youre going solo for a high goal such as ranked pvp, a bunch of tickets for ascended armor/ obsidian weapons/ legendary backpack /legendary armor then its pretty much a total grind nowdays with the situation you explained.
---
You might wanna wish to change your profession every so often for a change of flavor since getting killed and loosing matches over and over again wont matter as you still get some progress towards your end goal.

To test out elite specs you can go to the PvP lobby and try out any elite spec if you have the expansion unlocked.
---
You can try them out with different stats,sigils runes, weapons on golem dummies or throw your self in the free for all pit against other players, or play some pvp matches instead. 
---
For testing out various core profession i prefer using the lvl 80 booster trial
---
Repeatable hard raids every six months is still better than one raid every 9+ months that has a hard difficulty that doesn't encourage replaying, sadly.

SLI 1080Ti = same FPS with GTX 980
---
i7 3770k to i7 8086k@5.2 ghz = 30% fps increase
---
Old rigs: 20 fps in LA, 10-15 fps during wvw zerg, world boss

New rigs with 8086k: 40-50 fps in LA, 30-40 fps during wvw/world boss (all setting high including character count)

Now do you see why?

I've been wanting to try out FFXIV for a long time but the price kept me off. You post made me research a bit more and holy shit there's a lancer class, i'll try out the game just for that

Hey, is anyone able to run it with a double GPU?
---
I'm still seeing the benefits of [dx12](https://i.imgur.com/ErTDeYA.jpg) vs [dx9 single](https://i.imgur.com/cq7GTEM.jpg) or [dx9 sli](https://i.imgur.com/5NyzqxP.jpg) though.
---
Is it something specific to dx12?
---
So CPU is the answer, unfortunately.
---
engi, or reaper both tend to get me to smile
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Malyck 
---
It wasn't really developed further and a lot of evidence indicates it was an idea for Heart of Thorns that got scrapped. 
---
I tried several times today (including daily reset) and I didn't see anything. I only was able to find this during my last trip there because it's hard to spot since you have to angle your camera a certain way.
---
I very much prefer FA rotation over Bolt To The Heart one.
---
\o7
---
Thanks! I'll look it up.
---
Answer to what, exactly? Your CPU didn't change at all, correct? If so, then it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. You changed the GPU and are getting less performance from an objectively more powerful graphics card.
---
I would start with running DDU to completely clear out any old drivers on the system, then do a clean installation of the latest drivers for the 2070. It may not solve the issue, but its the most basic start troubleshooting.
---
Yikes, dude.
---
That sucks. Have you tried opening a ticket with the support? I can imagine they might be able to revive your character. They certainly have done it before, not sure how long they save deleted characters.
---
Ele is hard for beginners yes but they are one of the big dps classes so damage shouldn't be a problem. Leveling try scepter dagger or dagger dagger and when reaching 80 HoT elite Tempest is good. Check out openworld builds on metabattle.com aswell for traits gears etc.
---
Thank you it's working! :)
---
And it's probably one carrying the invisible shoes too 😂
---
I'm not "you people", stop generalizing.
---
Bans should only happen when someone *breaks the fucking game*, not hurts someone's feelings. Grow the fuck up, it's just someone talking on the internet.
---
First, stop exaggerating -- GPU absolutely matters in GW2. Yes, strong single-core CPU performance is a big factor in getting higher framerates in this game -- but a strong GPU does also matter. "SLI 1080Ti = same FPS with GTX 980" is absolutely untrue -- the former will get better framerates in every situation.
---
Second, and more importantly: what does any of that have to do with the actual question within the thread? The OP isn't asking if he should upgrade his GPU -- he already has an he's getting lower framerates than before. The CPU that he didn't touch at all isn't a factor here, so it makes zero sense that you're bringing it up.
---
What do your gear stats look like?
---
Pug group fights it should be enough for 2x bound to position yourself in their back line where you aren't likely to hit a line of warding, but it's definitely not enough by itself for big blob fights you're right
---
2k gold just sitting there waiting to be picked up :(
---
&gt; side note, there is really no farming in the traditional sense: you tag stuff during events with other people but going around alone and murdering mobs is very bad profit per time spent
---
Yeah, I guess I expressed myself poorly.  
---
With farming I meant literally gathering ingredients for crafting.  
---
The idea being having one character that goes around quickly, so that it can farm ingredients for all others.  
---
That's why I look for a good combination of survivability and damage output and, if possible, also mobility.
---
Yep, seems I didn't choose exactly the best class for a beginner but the skills are so cool that I don't care, been just using greatsword and spamming illusions and clones to confuse foes. Haven't yet unlocked the whole chrono tree
---
Do you play gw2? Do you play pvp? Do you have an opinion regarding bans? If the answer is yes then you belong to the "you ppl" im talking about. Besides that, my point/question flew over your head as you just wanna rage it seems..
---
Anet has always been inefficient.
---
Thanks I have more videos to share soon ! \^\_\^/
---
Best to look for best single core performance of course.  Since this game can run on a single core, might as well look for a CPU that can perform the best on a single core if it has to (not saying to buy a CPU with only 1 core).
---
double GPU is tricky part, i use nothing from dx12 multi gpu API, but drivers still should do their work on splitting load between GPU's.
---
So best case is to tweak drivers settings on this and check GPU load.
---
SLI doesn't work in gw2.. just fyi.  I know a few people that have done it with no difference at all.
---
I personally went from a 780 Ti to a 1070, Got maybe 5 fps increase with my current settings.. which is not much of a difference.
---
and the G stands for Game, not chat.
---
Technically speaking, of course.
---
its not the RP, its the Mosly Male Online Role Playing Girls that cause the cancer.
---
um... are male norn shoulder always look that weird?
---
Clean install of drivers for sure.  Having old drivers installed while mounting new hardware can cause some problems.
---
I guess one of the dyes is shadow abyss but whats the other one?
---
I'm more of a casual player so raids aren't my thing but I like the dungeons - I even like the stories and I wish they would add more paths / dungeons. At first they said Anet would stop focusing on dungeons because it's not they way they want people to play the game (too isolated) but why are they then adding raids?
---
Actually, yes.
---
Rytlock, in front of Big Snaff: I'm glad Zojja doesn't have to see this.

---
You know, if you're not a prick about it trying to ridicule what I'm asking for to make it look worse than it is just to strengthen your own condescending and dismissive position. But hey, we're on the internet. Jerking our ego by shitting on others if what it's there for!

---
You can go back to core Tyria too for hero points. I was able to max out both my elite specs fairly easily by doing the story and exploring. The mounts come along in the story of PoF and as long as you don’t rush through you shouldn’t have too much of an issue training them. The jackal, beetle, and griffon are the 3 optional mounts with the jackal and beetle needed for world completion. You could also dip into fractals now if you’d like. The early levels aren’t any harder than a dungeon and are actually much shorter. I’d offer to play with you but I saw somewhere else you’re on EU. You’re right though, just take it easy and enjoy the game one step at a time.
---
Fractals actually prefer power damage to burst the mobs and bosses down faster rather than wait for conditions to ramp up. [dT](https://discretize.eu/) has fractal specific info and builds if you wanted to check that out. [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) also has the raid specific builds and guides. In fractals now the combination of a hybrid renegade and hybrid firebrand can give out alacrity and quickness while still dealing a lot of damage. 
---
Looks more like darkness to me.

I’m assuming I wouldn’t be able to see him anymore once we changed instances, but I’m not certain.
---
Last time I checked heartstone wasn't a team game. It was you, your opponent, and the RNG (which is probably the most important player out of three). 
---
In such game if the only player in the room is bad, you just go and punish him yourself ingame, no talking needed. In "team, but random" game like current gw2 spvp you can do nothing to a bad player that get paired with you, at least directly. 
---
Oh right. Why would we need a coordination in the team-based game. 
---
That would be nice. Purifying community one person at a time lol.
---
Cool. Makes it feel more worthwhile to get them.
---
A necromancer. Scourge not fully unlocked, but the traits I wanna use are. And with Blood Magic and Curses. I like being support, so that'll probably be my spec for groupplay.

 I've read alot about necros not being the best of classes, or something. But they should be fine in the lower tiers? I'm pretty casual, so will likely never get to T4 anyway.

Because it can be completed several times (once per year). If you click it, it should say "You have completed this 1 time".
---
It's a repeatable achievement: once it's done, it resets. Look at the achievement details and it will tell you: "You've completed this achievement x times"
---
Is is, once. Hover over the achievement and you see "Repeated 1 times". If you check the achievement in detail, you see you finished 50/1000 AP (yeah, in theory you can repeat the achievement 20 times, meaning at least 20 years)
---
I know it but i dont have his information. 0ap/1000ap

It being "opt-out" or "opt-in" says something about the game philosophy, true. But it doesn't change anything from a player's perspective. Every player have the ability to choose wether they want to disable the chat or not.
---
Also, why would you not be banned for telling somebody that sucks that they suck ? It benefits *nobody.* All it brings is toxicity. If somebody sucks and you want to say something, give him advice in a way that doesn't make you sound like an asshole. If you can't control yourself and have to vent your frustration on others through the chat, then you're part of the problem.
---
Interesting. Most of my concerns in that area stemmed from the lack of people doing dungeons or joining groups when I was on. You could always go in alone, the idea was just to be able to do the content rather than hoping someone would join. Hopefully people are now joining in my random timeslots now, but either way so many people have suggested Reaper i'd feel bad if I didn't try it.

I mostly use daggers and scepter / focus and rarely staff, and Fire and Wind specialization.

Thanks for the info!

You can see in the screenshot that you got 50ap from it.
---
Thank you. I'll look into that when I need a break from the campaign. 
---
But I still want to unlock some of Reaper to see what playstyle I like the most.
---
I have a lot of materials in my bank. Do you recommend using it on crafting so I can craft my own ascended gear, when time comes, or can others craft for me if I have the materials? If others can craft, then I might as well sell all my low level materials.
---
Focus isn't really necessary (or particularly good) in open world. I'd recommend using offhand Dagger over it, or Warhorn when you get Tempest - it is really awesome.
---
How is the survivability of Sword/shield holo and is it decent at open-world as well? Is it even still a good dps build at all, or kind of outdated?
---
How do you know they faked li lol and how do you know when a person joins and says i have x amount of li is honest.
---
We could tie her to a stick, like the choya!
---
Stronghold and that one conquest map with the keep assault are the closest Anet got to anything remotely like GW1's GvG, and that's pretty much it. If they have any future plans for something similar, they haven't said them out loud.
---
Thanks for the reply. What is Stronghold? Are you saying it has GvG elements?
---
Seems fake to me:
---
[Here are my result](https://imgur.com/a/N4b8E5t)
---
I have 2li and i bet i can beat you at any raid wing in dps/support role in 1 week lol. Just because someone is new does not mean they are bad. There are a lot of competitive games out there that require 100times more focus and precision. Gw2 can be played while half sleeping. Showing elitism in this game is... sad honestly.
---
Trident is pretty much a staff, harpoon gun is pretty much a bow or rifle. Different skills yes, but they wouldn't really have their own niche?
---
Yes, but chat is a subset of the game, so it's automatically included. Technically speaking.
---
Yeah, it's an [infusion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polysaturating_Reverberating_Infusion_(Red))
---
Is plaguedoctor another new stat set?
---
ah so warrior is the only class that has that "idgaf i go deep" style? i just enjoy the feel of all in type classes in mmos
---
Yeah, it's the [Polysaturating Reverberating Infusion (Red)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polysaturating_Reverberating_Infusion)
---
Damn, that's some good fashion on the armor
---
Well they are unique and as long as they increase the build variety it‘s worth. I finally wanna use a spear on my mesmer, it‘s a great underwater weapon that would work on ground if they just tweak skill 5 a bit to be like a black hole instead od a water vortex.
---
Yes, introduced in Kourna. Getting full set is bit of a mission on itself, as it takes quite a bit of inscribed shards, unless you can buy stat selectable ascended gear with plaguedoctor, like fractal or raid 
---
Revenant is pretty trash in PvP. You have good burst but against anybody competent you will lose.
---
Someone's never played Zork.
---
That's really interesting - where can I read about those abandoned plans you described?
---
Reaper. Very high damage in a melee range, but susceptible to CC, can be kited, out-ranged, low mobility and ofc lacks sustain which means you'll probably end up loosing 1v1s to most other classes (built for 1v1s), thus you will need a support class (like a firebrand) who will keep you alive whilst you do the damage.
---
Though holo is probably better, it's actually more tanky, way more sustain, a lot more mobility, don't have to worry about getting cc'd, and has strong damage in both melee (not as much as reaper) and ranged.
---
It's on purpose.
---
If you pay attention when they go into idle combat stance, you will see how they actually plant the staff into the ground.
---
Nice my dude. Yes and hopefully people will stay composed and keep playing, I have now been on both the giving and receiving end of these match ups but this one no one flamed each other in chat here which I think was a reason for our success
---
In GW2, "casual" has little to nothing to do with howmuch you play. The term is instead used for the a special snowflake attitude.
---
"Hardcore casual" is a euphemism for "learning disability". 
---
Warrior has a lot of sustain (though some of it is reliant on your opponent attacking you, so you will struggle against skilled ones), more mitigation and mobility.
---
Here's a build for you. Fire 111, air 322, arcane 133 (if you have balls of steel, run 123, since you are level 60, you prob don't have a third slot, so ignore arcane until you are level 71), glyph heal, fire signet, glyph of storm, lightning hammer, fiery great sword. 
---
Run scepter dagger. Armor should have main stat power. 
---
Your rotation go like this: drop glyph of storm in air, swap to fire right away, use fire 2,3,4,5, swap back to air and cast lightning hammer/fgs, and lightning hammer skill 4/fgs 5 and 4.
---
Fill in the downtime with auto attack using lightning hammer or fiery great sword whatever is in your hands. Rinse and repeat. Tho all mobs should be dead by then, if it isn't, just swap back to fire if you want. 
---
Final advice, if you are level 70, and you have an item booster either from drops or from laurals merchant, use it and go level your cooking to level 400, free 10 levels. Make sure to use a cooking leveling guide to save money and time. GL. 
---
Well we have 15v15 deathmatch that we call GvG. Completely community driven.
---
Okay. Crafting will be something in the "far future". I've never been fond of crafting in mmos, so I'll just play and see what I'll get with time.

I believe some diaper loving charr who acted out their fetish in public scared everyone away.

*Answer this, hummingbirds: how does one fight the wind?*

Fun to see a thif who starts with the zerg. How does this build deal with condibombs? Is it just a case of don't get hit/let your team cleanse?
---
Yeah but that's like asking if you can play uno with a normal deck of cards and people just really want to play uno instead.
---
Mace is the typical heal weapon from its symbol and the block giving some mitigation boons like aegis or protection (which compliments Shield doing the same thing).
---
Axe is a damage alternative if your group isnt losing too much health with just your heals and utility skills. Also brings some CC.
---
Sword is great for when your group lacks Fury or cant generate it sufficiently.
---
Staff same thing but with Might. Has a minor CC but packs a respectable 1,200 unit airdrop heal (not counting symbol heal traits, then you also have the Symbol Of Swiftness as another "heal"). Scepter is in a similar vein ad Staff as a might gen but more focused on concentrated damage that gens Might as a side effect (scepter 2 but only if people stand in the symbol long enough to get several stacks, unlike Fury from Sword just refreshing/extending the duration).
---
What. Do you actually play pvp? Rev ist top tier
---
I'll go on a limb here and say: have you checked if your computer is running on Full Performance? You would be surprised the number of people that don't check it after hardware updates (windows tends to change that setting auto for some reason)

reaper looks really interesting, whats their mainhand/playstyle? and what do they excel in?

That's all fine and dandy, but you need to include many many more things in your report if you want it to be helpful at all. Just saying "crashed, doesn't work." does nothing. Every system is different.

Yea people do this in raids too, it's more of a GW2 problem than just a WvW problem. 
---
Especially in NA, most people will never LFG a raid group and would rather play with only their static. 
---
That’s funny because I never would have expected GS to be good dps in melee range. I was always told max range for max damage or just switch to sword if you can’t. 
---
&gt; There's no downside to boosting.
---
there is a pretty critical one: you miss out on the journey.
---
the levelling process is specifically laid out to give you new things to learn one at a time, rather than just opening the firehose in your mouth and letting you drown.

..and leaving you to wonder: "ok..so what do I actually *do* in this game?"

Yeah, I said the same thing when I learned of this.  Anyways.  Charr RP happens usually in guilds these days.  There's still a line of charr sometimes in the citadel near the bank though.
---
I an usually not one to get triggered over slang terms, but the term "toon", I think it ... just sounds kind of undignified and retarded. 
---
Well, people are different. 
---
And Chris looks older than Peter.
---
Chat is a subset of any game. I was just making a smart ass comment based on the logic of the OPs post.
---
but thats honestly what im going for, i just want a class that goes deep and can do some scary damage. looks like ill go reaper
---
You untangled the depths!
---
i see thanks. 
---
Oh god, passed these just yesterday - and I usually never go to BC. One of them made a joke that went something like: 
---
"What do you call a burnt out flame legion shaman?"
---
"I have no idea. What?" 
---
"A CharrCoal."
---
"Huehue."
---
You know how you get creating recipe dropped once in a blue moon in fractals? I think Anet meant for f2p players to grind that. Oh shit that's actually awful. Why has no one called them out for that? 
---
lol
---
But why would that be so difficult? Just match skill rating or something? 10v10 sounds cool! 
---
1) combat is way more active.
---
2) flat gear progression... you won't out-gear everything in the world a few weeks after a patch comes out.  I like that I need to watch my butt when out in the open world, rather than two shot everything in sight that isn't a raid boss.
---
3) Fractals &gt; Mythic Plus.  I *hate* the time limit on m+, i would rather take a second and make a good pull than rush, rush, rush.
---
Well I don't really consider gen 1 comparable to a gen 2 grind by any means and I want to complete more then just the legendary. I actually want the collections completed as I am an account completionist.
---
I have no issues with working patiently for something, what I do have an issue with is no clear explanation for failure. It leaves the player feeling needlessly frustrated. Only a handful of achievements/collections have had this affect on me.
---
Devs have mentioned quite a few of their original plans for Season 4, PoF, HoT and even Season 2 in guild chats (where Peter Fries mentioned the Awakened assassin idea), dev story playthroughs (they answered quite a few questions from me and other folks in the recent Thunderhead Peaks exploration longplay stream on Twitch!), Reddit AMAs and comments (via themselves or references posted by fans as was the case with [GW2 China launch lore bombs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/25iqrv/i_attended_the_gw2_china_beta_festival_heres_some/) regarding the Infinity Ball stuff creating fractal copies and how the multiverse works in Tyria in wvw and otherwise) and [ArenaNet Forum Chats](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/arenanet-forum-chats) (which are well worth reading on the GW2 forums as they're as much of a treasure trove of lore knowledge as the devs' Reddit comments are) here and there. The most recent reveal was Caithe's planned but cut death in Ep5 from guild chat as well as in the interview you linked.
---
Here's what I could dig up on short notice out of their swarm of replies on the subject. I've been in the process of gathering these snippets as sources to use for the respective character pages in wiki:
---
[Clayton Kisko on Episode 2:](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/439249/#Comment_439249)
---
&gt; Our original plans had us fighting Boticca as a villain :)  
---
&gt; There were plans to make a poke'mon snap like collection where you find specific rare animals and scan them for data collections  
---
&gt; We originally had Olmakhan riding Jackals but looking into the lore some more we realized this wouldn't make sense and so they now ride skimmers  
---
&gt; Early designs of the map had a giant Volcano to the north and the Cube to the south. @_@  
---
&gt; Originally the Inquest were going to have all these crazy biomes in the central island like snow/forest/lava/rock where they would do crazy experiments on animals and dino like creatures  
---
&gt; We had this idea for a cool sparring like event where you trained with a Olmakhan in combat but this was later cut and moved to a narrative only scene  
---
&gt; Gorrik and Blish are amazing! But originally we had Taimi in their position :)  
---
&gt; We joked at first but for a hot second we really wanted the player and Braham to have a hug it out scene  
---
[Peter Fries on Episode 2:](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/45957/destinys-edge)
---
&gt; Zojja was in earlier drafts of Episode 2. We haven't forgotten her, either.  
---
&gt; [She was not included because we realized] we would have had two episodes in a row with a female asura genius being captured and threatened by the bad guy.  
---
[Peter Fries on Episode 3 plans for Joko:](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/583066/#Comment_583066)
---
&gt; We originally planned some content where you were researching Joko's past in order to find his weakness, a way to defeat his immortality. That honestly wasn't anywhere near as compelling as the storyline we released. We've seen it demonstrated again and again that Joko rewrote Elonian history and embellished his omnipotence over the generations in order to subjugate his citizens. Why shouldn't the Commander (who has killed two Elder Dragons and a god) just assume the tales of this tyrant's immortality weren't as phony as any of his other lies?  
---
[Peter Fries on Episode 3 plans for Turai Ossa:](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/583015/#Comment_583015)
---
&gt; In an earlier iteration of the episode, Turai himself was going to show up in ghost form to gloat over Joko's defeat. It didn't fit the final cinematic version of that moment, but hopefully the state of the Domain of Kourna makes it plain that Joko still harbored a grudge over his defeat in Jahai and that he made a project of persecuting the homeland of the Kournan army that once defeated him.  
---
[Jessica Price on Joko and Aurene in Season 4:](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8vm8jv/living_world_season_4_long_live_the_lich_devs/e1oj7w5/):
---
&gt; My perspective on this is a bit limited, as I joined ArenaNet just as Path of Fire was shipping, so I can give you insight as to why we're doing what we're doing for S4, but I can't really say much about story decisions made before I got here.  
---
&gt; When I came in, the Living World team was in the midst of rebreaking the overall S4 arc. A bunch of work had already been done for Eps 1-3, and they were already in production, so we couldn't start from scratch.  
---
&gt; Given where the story left Joko in PoF, it was important that we NOT just leave that hanging, but we also had Kralkatorrik as the implied overarching threat from the epilogue to PoF.  
---
&gt; So:  
---
&gt; Joko being a part of this season was already a given. For various reasons that I'm not going to spoil, he couldn't be the main villain for the entire season.
---
&gt; And maybe this is revealing too much of how the sausage gets made--game development is a ton of working around constraints that players rarely know exist--but given that we had a largely new/rehauled writing team and I started weeks before the script had to be finalized for Ep 1, we had to redo it SUPER fast and simply take a lot of the work that had already been done as a given we needed to include.  
---
&gt; We didn't really know yet how to handle Joko. So we kept him largely offstage in that episode to buy some time to figure it out. Eventually we worked out our template for his behavior--he's actually initially shaken by what the Commander did to him, so he's more serious in Eps 1 and 2 because he's genuinely angry. In Ep 3 he's feeling good that he's got everything under control, so he's back to his old arch self. He does respect the fact that you were able to screw him over--it's the sort of thing HE would do--so when he's finally got you face-to-face, he drops a lot of the performative aspect and speaks to you in a way that's much more honest. His final cinematic is probably as close to genuine as he ever gets.  
---
&gt; When it came to how to handle his exit, we had to decide what we wanted the POINT of the exit to be. And we figured someone needed to articulate the thing that had been bothering a lot of us as writers, which is that there's an argument to be made that the Commander has--with the best of intentions--done a lot of things that actually made the world's situation worse.  
---
&gt; We figured Joko was the right character to say it in a way that the Commander would be tempted to dismiss, but that would get under your skin. He's saying it in the most blame-y way possible, but is the SUBSTANCE of what he's saying wrong?  
---
&gt; The problem with that is it becomes less interesting storytelling if you can tie him to a chair and beat answers to this stuff out of him, and if it were me, I wouldn't want to kill him, because I'd want those answers.  
---
&gt; So that was a challenge: how do we let him say just enough to get you thinking, but not enough to answer the questions you're going to have?  
---
&gt; In parallel, we were struggling with the idea of how to convey that Aurene is different now, and she's not your cute little pet, and she's not mini-you, either. She's a DRAGON. She's not always going to do things in a way that humans are comfortable with.  
---
&gt; One of the major themes in your relationship with Aurene--in the way that speculative fiction intensifies and makes literal, through scifi or fantasy situations, questions that we deal with in real life--is the question of how much you have to understand someone in order to be able to love and trust them. That's a question that every parent of a teenager has to face up to eventually--your kid is their own person.  
---
&gt; So, we needed Joko to say his piece and then not be able to say anymore, we needed to take him offstage as a villain in a way that hopefully would be the way he'd LEAST want to go out, and we needed Aurene to do something on her own initiative that wasn't done the way the Commander--or the audience, since your relationship to the Commander as a character is more direct than it is with a movie or book protagonist--would likely want it to go.  
---
&gt; We toyed with leaving him around for another half-episode, which was about as far as we could stretch it, but opted to take him out at the height of his likability. The danger with characters like him--like Heath Ledger's Joko, like Jack Sparrow, etc.--is they're good in smaller doses but if the audience gets too much of them, they lose their charm.  
---
&gt; That probably doesn't answer your actual question--the truth is I don't know why the decision to bring him back got made. (That isn't, by the way, intended to imply that I think it was the wrong decision or anything--just that I wasn't around when it was made.) [...]  
---
&gt; [about why PoF narrative team did not inform S4 narrative team of what they had in mind for Joko before the S4 rewrites] Yes and no. Sometimes people leave, and sometimes decisions get made for other reasons than storytelling. [...]  
---
&gt; We had other story debt we needed to pay off this season, and a limited number of episodes in which to do it. We kept him around as long as we could justify to tie up his arc from PoF, but we couldn't make him the main threat this season.  
---
(Continued from above.)
---
[Jessica Price on the rebreaking of S4 arc:](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/82j01l/living_world_season_4_a_bug_in_the_system_devs/dvagr8s/)
---
&gt; While doing story breaking (and re-breaking) for the entire season, we changed the plot and framing of [Episode 2] a lot, but there were already map assets, gameplay, etc. designed, so we had to retrofit some stuff. :-)  
---
[Matthew Medina on PoF rewrites:](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7z5whi/looking_for_a_path_of_fire_playthrough_on_charr/dump65w/)
---
&gt; In the case of Path of Fire, the heavy script revisions that we underwent in the back half of the project ate into most of the time we had left, and we chose to focus on getting the story in tip top shape for shipping it on time and at our quality bar. As such, we were pretty light on a lot of racial-specific dialogue in Path of Fire, but it's certainly something we strive for as much as we can without it blowing up scope.  
---
[Peter Fries on Malyck for S4 or beyond:](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8vm8jv/living_world_season_4_long_live_the_lich_devs/e1pzd9o/)
---
&gt; Though we aren't working on that kind of one-off 'Tales of Tyria' currently, we've talked about it as a possibility someday.  
---
&gt; In case it's not obvious, the problem with tying off Malyck's story in a satisfying way during Heart of Thorns was that the only players who would be familiar with that story would be the ones who rolled a sylvari and played one branch of three in act two of the sylvari personal story. We'd have to catch up the rest of the player population on who Malyck was before we could pick up his six year old arc, and that would have been a significant amount of time spent away from the main storyline.  
---
I hope these snippets are enlightening enough. The process of hunting down these written or audio dev comments and adding them to wiki (either to the actual pages or for my own personal work-in-progress [Lore Portal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Kossage/Lore_Portal) subpage when I need to remind myself of this or that lore trivia) is timeconsuming but worth it to get a better view of how storytelling works in design and how it shapes the world and lore of Tyria. :)

---
Yes.
---
Berserker is love, Viper is love 
---
That’s awesome thanks.
---
I legitimately wasn't sure whether I was in unintended territory until I saw this flat place and some other glitches. 
---
Yes, you can find the list here - [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s#Trinkets\_2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s#Trinkets_2)
---
You either quit the game as a hero or continue to play as a mirage. (That’s what I did) 
---
Although GW2 uses Havok for a few things, it does seem like there's really simulated wind like in a game with actual physics simulation (e.g.: wind pushing people, raising dust clouds, and affecting tree leaves and the surface of water), but areas appear to have a 'wind vector', then some parts of models appear to use that vector to change how they move, so particles and 'stretchy' parts of models like hair and cloth 'nudge' in that direction.
---
You can also see it working with hanging cloths like banners and flags.
---
WvW is currently decided by one's server. ANet has stated plans to create guild alliances which will remove the idea of servers altogether (since servers really only affect one's WvW team nowadays). With this system, guilds will be able to join up in alliances and one's chosen alliance will determine their WvW team.
---
So at some point WvW will effectively become large-scale GvG.
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
Look at xera. 
---
I mean sure you can go deep, but you won't have anyway to get out and if your team doesn't follow you die.
---
Imo, what you must know right off the bat is that *every* class has different types of weapons, that can be either meele or ranged. You can choose which one you prefer that fits your gameplay style better.
---
Unfortunately, despite the different weapons, they are not all well balanced, and eventually you'll understand that some are much better than others. That doesn't stop you from using the one you like most for simpler content, like open world exploration.
---
On the other hand, as many people have said in the comments, the game requires you to actively play during combats, which means you have to be ready to move out of some attacks, dodge others, change your skills to better prepare against some enemies, etc. This is specially true when facing mobs from the expansions, because those hit like a truck. In GW2 you *cannot* just sit in place an expect to kill everything. If you try that, you *will* die. 
---
You have a vareity of different traits, weapons and utility skills at your disposal, and the game not only encourages you to change those constantly, but in some cases you *have to*, in order to overcome specific foes. In this sense, my advice woukd be to carefully read each of your utility skills and understand how they can be of use to you. For example, if you're dying frequently to ranged enemies, maybe try a trait that decrease the damage you take from those; similarly if what troubles you are numerous meele foes, try an defensive utility skill that gives you blocks or the protection boon.
---
In case you bought Heart of Thorns, I suggest you to try the huge map-wide meta events either in Verdant Brink, Auric Basin, Tangled Depths or Dragon Stand. You'll likely feel completely lost at first, but soon you'll grasp what I said about active combat and how your class works.
---
Also, by participating in such events you'll be able to interact with the game's community. Don't let the reddit saltiness get to you, inside the game players are - in the huge majority - very helpful and friendly towards new players.
---
I hope you enjoy.

Looking only at the bottom graph. What are you on about?
---
Ran for an hour including 4 zerg fights without crashing. It's come a long way!
---
Totally crashed when I changed my in-game graphics settings though.
---
*gasp*
---
So having more power is just too overwhelming for some people?
---
I don't understand just how pathetic some people assume others are. The guy is here asking for advice to learn the game, and people tell him to go figure it out on his own.
---
The counter argument is that the game is overwhelming after boosting. Leveling 1-80 is STUPID FUCKING ADVICE
---
I never got toon.  I don't think anyone 'gets' it, they just heard other people use it and thought it sounded cute or something.  Isn't it short for cartoon?  How does 'character' turn into 'cartoon'?  
---
Like someone else said, power reaper is pretty good. You can give yourself 25 might, quickness and 100% crit chance -- all via traits alone, so you aren't reliant on a support class. Utility-wise, you can boon corrupt (which is hugeeeee in T4s where No Pain, No Gain or boon-buffing bosses are common), AoE heal with Well of Blood, provide blindness via Well of Darkness or dark fields, give might and condi clease with Well of Power, as well as good amounts of CC and vulnerability.
---
Depending on what else you trait, you can also provide limited group support, through providing a lifesteal aura, and either making your wells pulse protection (and lifesteal) with Vampiric Rituals, or spec into Transfusion and have Reaper Shroud 4 (Soul Spiral) turn into an impromptu burst heal  and pull downed allies to your location so you can rez them -- it can do about 3-4k in healing for a full zerk reaper, so it's quite powerful. 
---
I think a scourge is even better though. You can clear conditions better with the trait Abrasive Grit and provide barriers that prevent people from getting down, and stack might better. If you build a scourge correctly, you can pretty much force your team to stay alive and DPS. Plus, it can also boon corrupt, use the Transfusion trait like the reaper... the only drawbacks I'd say is that condi DPS is not as effective in fractals, and IMO the scourge lacks a bit in CC compared to reaper (but this may be because I'm not entirely used to playing it).
---
It depends on what you enjoy playing though. Reaper is more fun IMO, but scourge is much more effective.
---
I used to love just going to the Black Citadel to hang around and see what crazy rp was going on. 
---
Usually with an anti flatulence tablet. 
---
Thats after someone is already in. What i meant was there is no distinguishing players based on li as it can be easily faked and many people are doing it thus its an unnecessary system this community has developed and doesnt help with their run. 
---
The case you are saying is when your precious time is already wasted for which you put requirements up. Knowing someone faked li after he wasted your time is worthless. 
---
A Acronym
---
As sad as it is, it's also kind of funny how you try to draw upon my mocking of your patronizing. But primarily just scary.
---
Is there much buffing a necro can bring to help others, or is it more of a “you’re all dead but I’ll solo this myself”?
---
No

Thanks for posting this, I never did this achievement and now I have something fun to do.  All 4 of the HoT maps are absolute treasures as far as I am concerned
---
I always got confused about POF being an explorers expansion as I have more fun still looking around AB and the rest of HOT maps
---
Yep. The got even better once I got my Griffon 😄
---
Enjoy Tarir 👍😊
---
Axe torch an shortbow with traps and jakaranda pet. Easy Tagging.
---
Same thoughts here 😅
---
i thought we were all joking? i forgot reddit doesnt really have a sense of humor
---
Axe mainhand gives you a bouncing projectile and is your upclose weapon.
---
Longbow is your ranged piercing weapon (when traited with marksmanship).
---
Druid has a staff but obviously that's a different specialization.
---
I didn't see you have a heal tempest, with that, 3 power chronos and a boon chrono it can actually work quite well. 
---
That case need a good ol frame debugging.
---
You need to turn on your RTX, according to Nvidia it makes everything better /s
---
PANIC
---
It definitely depends on the group. There’s plenty of guilds that go to different spots and do while storylines and such, but most of the randos tend to just flock to two or three slots and chill there.

Found the guy who doesn't play Chrono....

spb is basicly WORST spec from pof,used only in some fractals if you need to remove boons,rotation is booring and dmg is low,core is better in everything basicly :D

---
Not 100% sure about Draconis Mons, but the treasure mushroom just runs around with no event. When someone hits it, then the event initiates.

thing is.... theres so few skimpy armor pieces,that i known already how you gona look like.
---
You can use the [time machine](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/time-machine) feature to compare snapshots and see what changed.
---
Buying both is cheaper than buying just one expansion. But if you can't afford one, then it depends on what you prefer. 
---
PoF tends to be more casual in content, and has mounts, while HoT has more engaging and rewarding meta events, and gliding. Both also have their own elite specs, so if you want say, a chronomancer, you will need to get HoT. 
---
If you're willing to deal with some drawbacks (like TP limitations), you might want to try the base game until level 80, which is free. After that, you can decide if the game is for you.
---
Gemstore-wise, I'd say hold off until you're sure you want to play in the long-term, because gems are a huge cost when converted from gold, and you shouldn't spend real money if you're not sure on the game. But permanent gathering tools and salvage kits are always a good start. I'd suggest extra bank slots as well.
---
Can't say I like mine feels useless in most scenarios, you just need to chop and slice nothing interesting happening, it gets bored after awhile. I couldn't find any use for dagger too, at least in pve.
---
There are some of us who do this, but I have to say you're right, the vast majority of RP I've seen in this game is people standing around in cities. My guild is typically in constant RP mode, but we usually just play the game and chat in guild chat as our characters, and go on adventures and respond to things in character.
---
It's a nice place for a picnic.
---
So I was looking into some stuff and it turns out the viper gear I suggested can only be crafted. An alternative would be a rabid set which if bought now would come out to about 4g for 6 pieces of armor. Another 2g-ish for a weapon. So about 8g 
---
-10g and you’ll be set for whatever content you’d like to run with. If you decide to change it up you’ll have enough saved up to switch pretty easily.
---
But yes, ascended crafting is a long term end game goal a lot of people end up not even going for because it’s such an extended process. It’s really only useful if you’re in master tier fractals anyway. The 5% bump in stats is marginal at best.
---
The gm had thought of that on the ticket. This just feels hopeless right now, i had stopped playing when the gm had given up and marked the ticket as resolved lol. Tried so many things already and got no clue how it started, one day was perfectly fine and the next day after an update the fps just went straight to hell for me.
---
Good basically for raids only (and open world, but you can play w/e is solo play anyway).
---
Aka "DotA clone". but instead of farming minions or avoiding towers to make game longer, you can just cheese it to end and the game is over with zero comeback mechanics since dead lord means GG.
---
That is a good enough explanation :) 
---
I am also a completionist and have more ap then i wish to admit, but the second generation is really getting to me and i have to take long time outs from them when i make one because i burn out. 
---
Points for jojo pose
---
That's amazing. Thank you. 
---
After getting The Golden Child title (as many others have), I can still say doing Tarir's meta soundtrack always makes me hair-raisingly excited. It's easily one of the nicest teamwork orientated metas in the game imo.
---
I never quite nailed down what caused it, but I feel it's somewhere between the sick environmental armor they give us (never going to forget the time I had to do south as a solo armor. oof.) and the ability to fairly *lose*. Not overwhelming, but it can definitely occur for the sleepy European megaservers at 00:00-02:00. It always feels a nice level of risk in metas that doesn't feel bullshit. 
---
Another thing that sets it apart from the others is that it's full of  teamwork! I've been around with maps where a set of comms from one instance won, took their loot, then bounced to the second instance that was up that night to help the comms struggling with that. Both instances ended up winning, even if the second one was cutting it close.

Totally true. However, if people keep adjusting the pug requirements to the limit, there will be a total of 50 players left at some point that would actually be "legal" to join. We raiders already have gotten quite the reputation and being too restrictive will only make raids worse than dungeons dev-attention-wise. We need new raids to keep the community engaged and we need new active members to complement veterans leaving for whatever reasons. 
---
back at it with the 2012 memes
---
The fallen "God" would've gone after Vlast whether or not the commander thought things. Vlast was bound by the "God" when we arrived in that part of the instance. Probably to be used in the same way as Aurene. I'm assuming he didn't have the means to escape and chose death instead. If Glint were alive though, Vlast would be too.
---
Ah, clear! That makes sense then why I can't find it... Thanks!
---
Thank you for answering all my questions!  
---
You say the heal renegade is the one that should most likely the support, and the reasoning you give makes sense, thank you! What gear should the rev most ideally run then?
---
Biggest recommendation: say it's a relaxed, off-meta group in the LFG. I find that attracts much more chilled out players who are much more tolerant of imperfect play and willing to try again without ragequits or kicking people with no discussion. 
---
I'm not saying it's the norm, but you do get lovelies who will kick you for having low DPS or trying to *actually* do the mechanics after your third wipe... then tell you it's your fault for being kicked. 
---
Being upfront in the LFG makes PUG life 100% less gross. I've always had more fun and actual success with groups I've started myself, explicitly asking for chilled out friendly players.
---
HoT has a lot more complexity and nuance to the map design than PoF for sure... but PoF has a whole lot more in regards to easter eggs or discoverable NPC mini-events.
---
I guess a good way of putting it is that HoT is fun for wanderlust whereas PoF is fun for world building?
---
PICk NICk and let's go!
---
Probably same what druid would use. I'm not sure what was meta for boon healers since PoF, but I mostly hear how harrier/minstrel (and even magi I think) mix works quite well.
---
\+ Combat movement, feel of playing the game, more satisfaction when playing a DPS role, being able to gather all nodes you come across, better aesthetic world and gear design, PvP is far more fun and I prefer the human character design.
---
\- PvE balance, amount of instanced PvE content, no goblins, no proper or satisfying healing, too little progression options
---
woke up to this, was a good laugh - hope it sells for whoever listed it

You'll most commonly find it in and around the taverns in Divinity's Reach.

gib4eu
---
That's pretty cheap. Especially if I don't craft anything at all and just sell all the materials I find.
---
I'm not in a rush to get ascended gear, so the tiny chance for drops in fractals will do.
---
I actually never did the dungeons. Maybe a few, so I still have both story and exploration to do in almost all of them. I guess I can loot some item skins there? The gear probably won't be worth it when I but a full set of exotic?
---
Seems a bit off though... Svanir Gauntlets 1400 g x 3 (light, medium, heavy). No idea how it is calculated, but I'd never give 1400g for this skin lol
---
Last time I properly played WoW was before GW2 was released so I apologise if anything I say about it is no longer true. 
---
For me personally, I love how alt friendly GW2 is. Like so much of what you've done can be/is shared across different characters and I love it! Achievements, gear, cosmetic unlocks and a lot of the game content like fractals and raids too! However, I think WoW has been catching up to this by making more of their stuff account bound.
---
I also love the combat. Like 99% of abilities can be used while moving. I remember playing as a Mage in WoW and accidentally interrupting a skill by moving. The next step I'm hoping anet take is to allow skills to begin casting while in the air! It's not THAT important but things like being able to immediately begin casting my next skill while jumping over a shock wave will only help in making the combat feeling even more smooth.
---
I love being able to exchange my spare gold in game for premium currency to buy cash shop items. I think WoW has this now but definitely didn't when I stopped playing.
---
There's plenty more but I don't want to end up with a wall of text that's capable of keeping illegal immigrants out of America.
---
That all being said, there are however things from WoW I do often miss for example quest text. I definitely felt more immersed when I played WoW compared to GW2. Though maybe this is just a result of me growing up.

It looks sooo cool, bit different for Women, but i think it went pretty well [https://puu.sh/CGGzA/ffdbeca2e6.png](https://puu.sh/CGGzA/ffdbeca2e6.png)
---
My friend used Give Diabetes on a dragon once. DM allowed it. 2 weeks later we find out the DM has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Guess he missed his target.
---
I still think they should've added crafting stations, bank, and tp. Maybe make tarir its own zone, and auric basin an exterior of sorts.
---
Females inferior

I liked the pavilions. I did someone similar but made them a bit bigger. Like the lantern stacking and the way it looks for a distance. The big black wall around the tavern was odd though.

Love makes you do stupid stuff. Logan choose the Queen over Destiny's Edge its a troupe as old as time its self. I don't blame Logan Glint probably knew she was going to die at the hands of Kralkatorrik as part of the prophecy of Aurene killing Kralkatorrik eventually with her champion (next season Kralkatorrik dies that my prediction).
---
They could take chunks of current WvW maps to make some GvG modes with then make a mirror test server or something like that for open world pvp and guilds can take some structures with buffs and all that with alliances, mounts, and all stuff the normal mega server has. It would probably be a mess but I'd have a hard time logging out.
---
I didn't criticize the character, I criticized the writing. Rytlock is the main representative of the Charr race in-game. &gt;!If that character is written to put aside his race's traditions, that can cause the players to view those traditions as "wrong" since we empathize with the main characters. If Anet wanted to explore the idea of a Charr putting aside his race's traditions, they should have done it with a more secondary character that wasn't such a representative of the whole race in our eyes.!&lt;
---
framerate in gw2 is almost always cpu-bound (meaning you could throw in as powerful a gpu as you can and see 0 perfprmance gain) as long as your gpu is at least somewhat new. 
---
Specifically, this game is pretty much all about single-threaded performance, meaning your clockrate is pretty much all that matters
---
It is Braham all over again. IMO the main representatives of a race in a game should actually represent their race - not become "human".
---
&gt; Its called evolving
---
So you're saying that Charr are lesser beings that have to "evolve" into humans in order to grow?
---
I’d recommend picking up a full set of exotic gear as soon as you can regardless. It’ll make everything so much easier to get through and if you decide to switch elite specs later down the line it’s not all lost because that set will still be useful.
---
The reason to do dungeons today is just for money, not really the gear, though there are chances at some decent stuff. The thing with gear though is the power comes from sets, not really the armor itself. You can have a full set of exotic armor but if the set bonuses from the runes don’t match up you’ll be much less effective. However, there are dungeon currencies used to buy dungeon skins which are pretty cool if you’re in a collecting mood. Keep in mind though you can only get the full reward for each dungeon once per day so running AC P1 for example more than once per day won’t do you any good.
---
Rework tempest please!
---
Why? Why can't Rytlock question their society and way of life? Rytlock is probably the Charr that have the most reason to question the charr way of life, since he is the one who have seen most of the other sides of the world.
---
It is of course also worth pointing out that we have had Charr moving away from the High Legion way of life before as well.
---
Heck, we have a whole freaking tribe that does not live like the High Legions at all. 
---
it sells for 2.5k usually, but to list the item at 10k he had to pay 2.5k just in tax\^
---
Wish I could get into roleplaying. I just don't have the creativity of some of those players. That and the 300 wpm typing speeds you see with some of them. 
---
hey :D
---
Well I wasn't asking you to join? And as I said, we RP in guild chat so it doesn't impact the gameplay experience of people like you who would rather not see it. So I really have no idea why it should bother you.
---
No I'm saying after 250 years they learn from other races, they have evolved from working with other races and learning their strengths. Thats what happens in writing. Look at Lord of the Rings those characters evolved, Harry Potter the same. All stories have characters evolving and learning from others. It happens in real life too it doesn't make someone lesser beings because they aren't the same as they were many years ago it means they are growing as people and characters.
---
Not a bug. Scaling with a transformation. 
---
I kept rereading this and didn't understand. I'm stupid. Thanks.
---
Wow that is unexpected! I wonder if mesmers are OP...
---
The PvP is better when looking at the big picture and that’s the main reason I play an MMO typically.  A few issues with certain class elite specializations being a bit ridiculous but I can live with that.  I also enjoy achievement hunting and exploration during downtime and I feel like this game does that much better than WoW.  Last but not least, no sub fee.
---
Yup she’s learning to scepter/warhorn support in magi right now.

Also out of bounds in TD

Auris Basin must be one of the top tier maps in all GW2
---
Because they lose a big part of individuality when it usually comes up not as character evolving past  the point of it's origin, but as rejecting that origin and making a character into more of a uniformed balnk slade that you write as a typical human.
---
I won't talk about Rythlock, this is some shoddy side story written by a noname, and a-net really shouldn't fucking touch their most valuable character in the story, but there is also Rox. 
---
She wan't ever much of a character, but the whole point of her motivations lied in charr traiditons. And now she seemingly left for a conviniently emancipated 21-th century bland village she found on the side of the road. Who is she now? What is she? Is she even a charr? Would you be able to tell that with your eyes closed? Go also make her transsexual, why not. I've heard this shit is hot atm. 
---
? It's a fairly independent build, grabs boons from the Zerg but otherwise is off in the enemy's backline alone
---
the problem is that mostly all main characters go down that route.
---
no matter the race and the racial background...
---
&gt; Iboga: F2 is a 1200 ranged
---
pull.
---
No one really runs condi in wvw fights right now so it hasn't been a big problem, the only thing that stacks up is torment which is cured by withdrawl. But seriously, don't get hit with this build or you melt lol
---
Tyty

PvP for time of knowledge. I have over 1000
---
&gt; No I'm saying after 250 years they learn from other races, they have evolved from working with other races and learning their strengths.
---
not really, they are learning the human strangth. all the humans or sylvari dont learn anything from charr or norn.
---
&gt;Because they lose a big part of individuality when it usually comes up not as character evolving past the point of it's origin, but as rejecting that origin and making a character into more of a uniformed blank slade that you write as a typical human.
---
Ah yes, because being a robot who follows ones society is gives sooooo much more individuality? 
---
&gt;I won't talk about Rythlock, this is some shoddy side story written by a noname, and a-net really shouldn't fucking touch their most valuable character in the story, but there is also Rox.
---
Ah yes, the narrative time (the ones who write the story and the lore) are a bunch of nonames with no bearing whatsoever about the story, right?
---
Charr are in truce with other races only for few years, not 250. They still shoukd be savage and agressive and their change shoud be a progress, a topic of a game or a book not a status quo.
---
I was referring to the merged skills.
---
Maybe for gw3 - if even for that. It'd be super great to revive GW1 GvG. People want similar stuff but won't and can't play the original thing.
---
Tarir is certainly special. Honestly, all the heart of thorns map are all amazing. 
---
&gt; they learn from other races, they have evolved from working with other races
---
So you see it as a positive for one race to &gt;!set aside their traditions to take another race's traditions.!&lt;
---
I think we all know the answer:
---
Maybe?
---
I've spent too much time in the Royal Terrace area in DR were one of the infamous RP inns is just over the wall and in chat range.
---
Based on the speed in which those people respond to each other, I imagine they are alt-tabbing, writing every line in Word, using spell check, opening up a thesaurus, and then mailing the lines to their old English teacher for proof-reading.
---
All so they can candoozle their fiblourous beer glasses and explain something about Sylvari that we all already know.
---
It's funny, and I know that's not anywhere near the peak of RP, but even if it was I could not see why people want to kill it.
---
People have vastly different suggestions and opinions on this topic so idk how much my voice will be heard here but it seems to me you are just looking for any of the "bunker" builds that deal dmg as well (so not firebrand nor weaver). Soulbeast is currently the top tier bunker build but holo (protection variant), chrono and spellbreaker (NOT the tetherbreaker sword+shield/gs build) are also viable and fit a very similar role. Some reference sites I'd recommend are (metabattle)\[[https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest)\] and (godsofpvp)\[[https://www.godsofpvp.net/](https://www.godsofpvp.net/)\].
---
I have a feeling that if Kralktorik died then, all of the other dragons would've awoken earlier, and we may have not been able to stop zhaitan or mordremoth.
---
Any tips and tricks for someone who just started thief after years of other proff and is having a blast? I remember dodge+steal for a spike was a thing but maybe it was nerfed? 
---
PoF is a travellers expansion. HoT is an adventurers expansion.
---
For reals though AB was very cool. I never spent time in most of the actual city despite doing the meta 100+ times. Did the tablet achieve and suddenly I realize it actually is a city, not just 4 gates and a lootpit.
---
pve: Don't care
---
PVP:
---
I would like to see dps reduced nearly accross the board. Seems  abit like the last patch may be moving in that direction.
---
Mirage: reduction of condi stack applied from skills. I would rather Mirage be forced to choose between evasion uptime and dps, but as that is a problem with skills not traits I don't see how they can do it without a rework
---
Boonbeast: cooldown on dolyak and moa stance increased. Protection duration on some skills reduced. Soulbeast Sic em is too strong, lower amount of dps gain when melded with pet.
---
Holosmith: Cooldown on holoforge 3 and 5 increased, heat generation increased.
---
Reaper:  I would like to see heal numbers on blighters boon bufffed.
---
Scourge: I think it is OK
---
Core necro: Increase speed or dps of shroud auto. Rework Death Magic so it is usefulto take in some sitiation. Maybe add protection uptime somewhere on a trait. Or increase healing somewhere. Heal on vampiric presense scale much higher with healing power. Transfusion heal lowered.
---
Warrior: I think warrior is OK, core warrior is fun and a valid alternative to spellbreaker. Spellbreaker lost a lot of damage on the f2 last patch and now is I think OK. Take a look at berserker I don't see many about. Out of the sidenoders/duellist I think boonbeast and mirage are clearly superior, and I would like to see them more equal. I would rather they are nerfed to spellbreaker level rather than spellbreaker buffed.
---
Thief: Not sure. Haven't played it in months. Deadeye isn't really fun to play against with all the stealth and one shot potential. I think daredevil/core is much more effective in matches though. I prefered the way lead attacks worked before last patch. 
---
Ele: Buff dps a little on sword skills, reduce healing amount from water 2 or increase cooldown, increase cooldown on twist of fate, maybe only make it 1 charge. Reduce cd on attuenement swap by .5 secs or more for weaver. Basically I would like to see weaver more of a threat but easier to kill.
---
Increase base dps on fresh air trait. Increase dps on scepter skills.
---
Guard: core guard - Reduce the amount of free crit chance in radiance as it is too good. I would like to see firebrands have less access to condi cleanse to make them more vulnerable to condis.
---
Rev: I think herald is good. It could see a nerf to burst dps. Renegade I think the summons could have their health buffed, or spawn with 3 secs of stab or something. 
---
&gt; I still think it's a project with a lot of promise and am amazed at how quickly problems are being solved.
---
Maybe you are just too used to ANet's pace of bugfixes &gt;_&gt;
---
What is in ur opnion wrong with Banners and Ghost?
---
HoT was made because players wanted harder content, but with the level 80 boost new players got throw in over thier heads before learning to play. The expansion achieved what they meant it to do
---
And what exactly is the problem with changing traditions? Especially when those traditions are not necessarily a good thing.
---
They should probably revamp it somehow, honestly. No other class has to choose between weapon skills or utility skills.
---
“Making a norn into a whiny brat” so Braham?
---
Because pve isn't the only game mode in game, eSpec mechanic requires your target to stand still for 8 seconds and regen is widely accessible boon?
---
Idk, I hated it too. It was way too whiney. 
---
Nope. It is positive to look what others do, compare it with what you do, and come up with something better than both based on that.
---
The olmakhan do not act like humans, but they have families and keep their kids around like many other races have, including humans. They may have a societal structure similar to humans, but they still have very different values, and they got shocked when they saw the behavior of humans in the Bazaar. 
---
A 'tradition' is just something people have been doing for a long time. It isn't good, bad or valuable just because of that.  
---
If a tradition has no value, there's no shame in only keeping it in the history books. 
---
Many societies of Abrahamic religions had traditions of slavery. Some still do. It wasn't "setting aside your traditions" when muslims enslavers stopped selling slaves to christian slave traders who them sold the slaves off to protestant slave owners.  It was leaving behind a crap custom that should not have existed in the first place.
---
Sending your kids off to die in war is a bad idea no matter what your race is. Specially now that there's peace between the races.
---
I don’t pay $15 a month
---
Charr are not that unique. We also had (and probably have already) warlike societies like the charr legions, in which children are taken from their parents to be raised for war.  And they also suck.
---
You have to use a trait to get ONE stack of stability while casting a 4 second overload.
---
It's always Logan' fault. Logan i fucking hate you.
---
just because a character grew up in a certain society, that doesn't mean they can't dislike parts or even the very foundation of it. further rytlock specifically went through some traumatic shit in his life as a soldier, and has to deal with the guilt of being responsible for balthazar's release, which ultimately caused kralk to gain his current mist powers.
---
this is also just an inner monologue, meaning no traditions were actually thrown out yet. it's a glimpse into rytlock's past, as well as his current psyche and emotional state.
---
in comparison, braham (who you brought up in one of your comments) went full edgy *human* teenager. sure, he lost his mother, however lacked the experience with other races to pick up on such foreign behaviour, *and* didn't just brood over it, but immediately acted on it.
---
Rytlock becoming a revenant is a real change.  He came from the mists, after seeing what's behind our reality and that clearly changed his way of understanding the world and probably made him losing the interest in the cultural matters and traditions.
---
It still is, you can't vault+steal anymore but you can bound+steal. Biggest tip I can give is play somewhat erratically so people have a hard time bombing you when you're stuck in an animation. If you do get caught in an animation, use your heal to get out before the hits land as it cancels your current animation and evades
---
Yup, I tag up for KRTA on mondays =P
---
Short answer: no. 
---
A strange behaviour I saw was if you were standing on a cliff or ledge and you use projectile attacks horizontally over it, the grasses at the bottom of the cliff also parted as if you were shooting it at ground level. 
---
Sorry you're getting downvoted to hell. You're completely right, but this subreddit is overrun with snowflakes who want everyone to get in touch with their inner wimp.
---
I knew it!
---
He isn't necessarily throwing out Charr traditions though.  Sohothin has become a burden to him on a number of levels.  One, its presence dictates a duty to cleanse the Foefire from Ascalon.  A duty he has chosen not to fulfull at the moment for reasons the Citadel apparently accept (I can't even imagine what reason would be good enough but he isn't rotting in the jail).  
---
Even though he wasn't in command, he was part of a battle that lost a lot of people who put their faith in us and him, and a moment of questioning one's self after such a defeat is not a true sign of weakness.  
---
Notice he isn't telling it to us in the Requiem, he is contemplating to himself; The biggest plus for them putting this into some out of game medium was because it would spoil the character too much for us to hear these thoughts spoken by him.  Steriotypically (which ultimately is what each race of Tyria is... a specific steriotype of irl humanity), a Charr would keep stuff like this to themselves.
---
With that said, if he goes all weepy/emo (like braham) or we see the Destiny's Edge crybaby crap reborn anew with any of Destiny's Edge or Dragons Watch's surviving members then Anet will be flagrantly out of bounds... And rehashing, for a third damn time, a lame and predictable story most people I know go to *fantasy* to get away from.
---
I never said it did. I said that this character is the main representative of the Charr in our stories. They should have explored this with someone less important.
---
Depends on what you learn.
---
organized groups don't run healer because it's useless
---
the ideal comp is probably phalanx banners, soulbeast, weaver then either alacrity renegade+quickbrand or chrono+dh
---
the most pug friendly comp is probably like 3dh 1bannerbot 1chrono 
---
I knew it would be. But thanks :D
---
You do very much keep implying that they are changing the whole race though. 
---
But why? Why shouldn't they use a character where it would make most sense to actually see such change? How effective and meaningful would it be if Charr Soldier #5 had the same thoughts? It would be completely pointless. 
---
When using Rytlock (which makes total sense) on the other hand it could very much lead up to future story threads that keeps the story moving. 
---
It would have been a LOOOONG time before I put two and two together lol  
---
I have heard they give 10 in expansion content, but my question then is... how much of the expansion story do you actually have to play through to access the locations?
---
Not sure if it is really "wind". They probably just move the particles in one fixed direction (x/y 0,0 maybe). It would be too resource intensive to calculate changing wind directions for every player, especially in GW2 where there is no character LOD, so the game would have to calculate the particle directions for 100+ players when you are in a big city or WvW.
---
Found the guy without full legendaries?
---
Search volume is used all the time as a rough measure of interest in a topic. Comparing an abbreviation to a full name is no good, but I'm not sure why you're saying keyword comparisons are not "valid representative statistics," whatever you mean by that.
---
Any benchmarks or actual meaningful data?
---
🅱️ A N I C
---
No, it's called difference of opinion. And just plain being wrong but you wouldn't know that, now would you?
---
no....its kinda cute, but in a scary wtf run type of way
---
You've done 4000 dungeons paths with LFG. Someone needs to build this dude a statue in their honor
---
I honestly miss the harsher open world.
---
Sure it was a pain if someone got to a node before you or tagged a mob before you hit it.
---
But there is a sense of relatability that is lost and I think it has bigger effects on the game as a whole that are hard to fully see without real data on it.
---
Except Rytlock isn't really a main character, is he? He's a side character, an important one but not the focus.
---
Well what if Charr #602 went and had an internal monologue about Charr ways and his own self worth after having witnessed Aurene dying? 
---
Who's Charr #602 again? Exactly.
---
You haven't read a lot of fiction, have you?
---
There damage is strong atm but the problem is they effectively function like a condi build while being a power build so they only really shine on a boss with long continues phases that doesnt favor condi damage. 
---
Otherwise there phantams just slam into phases. 
---
Out. Everyone of you out. None of you are free of sin. 
---
Idk how much you PvP/how many classes you play but if it's the only game/gammemode you play, after some time you begin to understand enemy's tells and debuffs/buffs.
---
Being able to identify the 'dangerous' wind ups can be enjoyable.
---
The other option is something similar to wildstar PvP where there were colors all over the ground.
---
If anyone is interested, I'm selling 2 of those chests for 1250g
---
I got to roam with the wvw team once when they we're on their lunch break lol... They are pretty fun.
---
I've played GW2 a lot since launch and sometimes it's good to be reminded of why I really enjoy the game.  Thank you.
---
Mirages and deadeyes are freaking horrible
---
Please don't rework banners or spirits. Sorting out crit chance and boon coverage is not interesting at all, I'd much rather be forced into taking a specific class and not have to deal with it.
---
Either somebody trying to inflate their account value on gw2efficiency or trying to move large amounts of gold around without the 500g/week limit.
---
It's not bad for races or the trek because you can finish them fast, but two times "Save our supplies" is the horror.
---
If you boost to 30. Then from creation to end of lvl 30 story gives 4.5 levels. That's all I know  sorry :)
---
It all comes down to personal preferences. I adore PoF and still visit it almost daily. HoT? Barely go there since PoF release. Don't get me wrong, I like HoT metas and map design, but that's not the type of exploration I can enjoy on almost daily basis, esp coming home after work and wanting to relax.
---
TL;DR: To each their own :)
---
The other reason why I like Auric Basin is, that it's the only zone from HoT that you dont get lost around every corner xd
---
pretty sure the missions are rng so it's bound to happen
---
I would argue that 'guild wars' would be a better search term, since many people won't bother with the 2 and the original game is probably generating a negligible amount of interest searches at this point.
---
Thanks for the tip, I've been briefly trying the shield but I always resort back to GS which has more... *noticeable* impact if that makes sense.
---
yeah alot of things that make gw2 great (guild missions, dungeons and wvw) don't get love, yet they try to reinvent the wheel or just add gemstore/ grinding
---
I am really interested in this. Anyone knows what gear it is ? 
---
Or Yanonka the Rat-Wrangler &gt;&lt;
---
They're not dead.
---
They're in a coma.
---
And we're thinking of pulling the plug.
---
I feel rich in game, always have around 6k gold, and/or have the ability to make 10k in a month. But, i am nowhere near as wealthy as the guy who listed that item just to pass "10k" gold to his alt account, That guy must be doing well!
---
profane chest and legs, accolyte boots, sheepskin head
---
Dual axes is also fun, with fire sigil on each. Not optimal by any means, but another wide, piercing projectile + blender tag a lot of stuff. Torch is only useful for fire field.
---
I'm fairly certain that HoT is widely regarded within the community as one of the best pieces of content to date and this isn't at all some unpopular opinion.
---
Oh snap! Always happy to run with you guys, you have guts lol. i've seen you guys push on groups with 10+ more than you haha. 
---
im usually 80 by the time i reach the claw island mission. i have so many toons that abandon story at the start of this.
---
&gt;1-Druid and chrono is the safest and most pugfriendly in my opinion. The fb/ren set up is a bit of a mess in lfg. You'll see a variety of healer ren or fb or no healers depending on the group. The ones without healers I've found are pure RNG of the player skill you join with. Bosses like the 100cm boss 2 can be a total mess of downstates without a healer if the dps aren't cleaving or doing good damage in general. Nightmare 99CM for MAMA and siax suffer similar problems where either you have people that do high DPS to phase or they don't dodge and it turns into a huge mess of downstates and wipes again. You won't get a pug that phases bosses in 2-5s like you've probably seen in some videos and that's where the comp starts to fail in LFG.
---
Ofc you are entitled to your opinion, however in terms of raw defense, and no matter which variant you actually choose (power quickbrand and harrier renegade or vice versa), druid and chrono are so much worse off. The reason fb/ren is a mess in lfg grps isnt due to the comp itself. Rather people arent playing the builds even remotely correct. Atm you get most often heal fbs that dont even know that their symbols heal, and that they have a reflect on third tome. You get renegades that dont know what energymanagement is. Put plainly: people are just copy&amp;pasting the builds and then autoattacking, without even reading traits and skills. If you had a druid only autoattacking on staff, or a chrono using SoI before wells apply boons.... then you'd say that comp is bad for pugs?
---
Its really been quite eyeopening for me, to see people ping 300+ kp and  then not even knowing pure basics. Im not talking about things like using elite on ventari before switching off.... basic stuff, like wheres my condi cleanse... wheres additional aegis / protection... what to do when might is lacking... how to cc on fb... which legend to start off on, etc.
---
To add insult to injury, theres some players running weird wvw fb builds in fractals now. They cant maintain 100% quickness - which as a firebrand really is saying something, since you only need around 30% boon duration for comfortable uptime. You can usually spot them when they whip out staff or hammer at beginning of the fight.
---
So, all in all, I wouldnt be so hasty with your condemnations. Best thing you can do atm, is to find a buddy and play fb/ren yourself. For pugs, harrier renegade + power firebrand does quite nicely, that duo can support via dps, heals and defense. Make sure to camp scepter long enough for sufficient might, and carry pugs through fractals. If you really, really make sure everything works out nicely, you can go for diviners trinkets + pack rune to get 100% uptime on boons like swiftness, fury and shared empowerment trait for 25 might - without relying on bannerwarrior.
---
You say that, but i am the guy who just converted gold to gems to get the Exalted Shoulders, needless to say, RNGeesus was not on my side. Got the Skin in 97 keys, i shit you not. Costed over 2k gold.
---
Oh yeah, gotta dive in!
---
Personally, I came from a roaming gank style gameplay. Always trying to pick people off or like _start the fight_, haha.
---
Do you know where? I tried searching for videos/guides but couldn't find any :(
---
The only way you could have made this better would have been to take a photo of your screen with your phone and post it.
---
Was one of the first post i had seen when the gm gave up. Tried nearly everything but other than just completely changing up my pc i don't really any solution to this fps thing &gt;_&lt;
---
Well from what i've been told is that some vpns make the connection shorter without having to go through protals or gates, i don't have much knowledge about that but, is there anyway to reduce the ping ? or am i just stuck with it until i leave this part of the world ?
---
A VPN will not decrease ping unless your ISP sucks are you have massive packet loss. As a VPN basically replaces the ISP's routing with a private service. 
---
Since your ping is 230, that's pretty good over the average 400ms people get when connection to EU or US from faraway territories, and you probably do not have high packet loss.
---
You could star the game with [-diag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-diag) to check if you have packet loss, but I doubt it. 
---
Just go with full harriers + monks. Or harrier/cleric mix with water runes. You should make sure to hit 90+% boon duration, while trying to get as much power as possible for kalla elite dmg.
---
Nice!
---
Had that last week.  We laughed our way through it but dang, it felt like it took awhile.
---
It’s character growth. You can’t write a good character without having them change due to the circumstances of their arc/journey/situation. All the story does is add new layers to a character that has been famously guarded when it came to his emotions. This is very important growth for Rytlock. 
---
His time with the legions still shaped him. He’s still a man of few words, a little too gruff, and a complete bad ass. 
---
Having a multi-faceted personality absolutely does not take away from the Charr’s traditions or their way of life. 
---
And here I thought showing characters have genuine doubts and fears, as well as actual attachment to their peers made them less shallow. The things you learn on the internet
---
r/Trehearnejokes
---
u/MithranArkanere is wrong. Jennah gave Logan a scarf. Logan gave said scarf to Rytlock, who in turn gave Logan a Blood Legion medallion/amulet.
---
We did kill a god...
---
well in pvp sb is trash,went from S to C in one year,dunno about wvw,since i dont like running around for 1 g per hour.
---
Unique identifier probably. You can have accounts with same name, but the numbers are different. 
---
Hey did you have to rename anything? Tried dropping it in bin64 and no go
---
it's still very active, that's not really a concern for us.
---
Low level zones tend to be slightly less active because there isn't as much to do there, so it's largely just low level players or specific events happening. 
---
HoT maps are still wildly active, and PoF maps are active but often not quite as much as HoT (a lot more of a solo/duo experience for the most part in PoF)
---
That being said, you might see less people doing things right now because there's the lunar new year festival going on, so people are possibly in divinity's reach
---
sure,i dont force anyone in t4 fractals,whats stoping you in doing t1-t3? i sure you gona find plenty of CHILLED ppl there XD
---
Active enough. There's at least one post weekly on same topic, try using search bar.
---
You mostly see it in Divinity's Reach, but I've also seen it in the other cities, mostly around bars/taverns. 
---
&gt;  stirred Primordus, he was put to sleep thanks to an ultimate sacrifice of the whole Race of Dwarves. And then Zhaitan rose and Orr which was sunk, rose up with the undead, then Scarlet caused the awakening of Mordremoth, and then Mordremoth's death caused Primordus and Jormag to awake,
---
Little correction: 
---
The Dwarves didn't put him to sleep, he wasn't awake at that time. He was going to wake up, but the Dwarves and the defeat of the great destroyer delayed it. 
---
Also Primordus didn't wake up until Mordremoth died. Even if delayed, Primordus was the first Elder Dragon who rose, at 1120AE. Zhaitan woke up later. Except for Mordremoth all Elder Dragon were awake at the begin of the personal story.
---
At Flashpoint we put Primordus and Jormag to sleep, again. Which indeed is a bit strange, because we (actually Balthazar) put them to sleep by sucking out their magic. But the original cycle says, that the Elder Dragons suck magic from the world, when they are awake and release it, when they sleep. If their magic is low, they wake up and start sucking magic again. 
---
So actually Primordus and Jormag should be way more activ after that story, to get their magic back.
---
A VPN should increase ping if anything, because it adds additional layers and potentially routes worse than normal, since you first route to the VPN server and then out.
---
In some cases ISPs have dumb routing to the game servers or are throttling what looks like game traffic, and a VPN can help those cases
---
Kralkatorrik never saw one of Jennah's illusions. The Kralkatorrik in that scene \*was\* the illusion.
---
But keep in mind, that when Jennah called Logan, she was reeling from looking into Kralkatorrik's mind which exhausted her from the energy backlash. The battle probably took 30 minutes with dozens if not hundreds of casualties before Jennah recovered enough to perform that illusion, which she no doubt had to spend some time to prepare.
---
When Logan showed up, the branded were literally at the gates of the keep Jennah was brought to for safekeeping. They were mere minutes from reaching Jennah and killing her without Logan showing up on time. She **would** be dead without Logan, no doubt.
---
And if Jennah died, that means Caudecus got free reach of Kryta's throne, which in turn means no charr-human peace and no Krytan aid for the Pact. No peace means the Iron Legion are too occupied to assist the Pact, meaning no tanks or submarines, and no charr and human assistance means no airships. No airships means no taking down Zhaitan as the Pact suddenly loses all possible air power.
---
no its not good for pvp,is reedit full of potato players? war is now weakest duelist have no place in teamfight. gl with that fc hitting for 800 in full zerk tho.
---
Well, an ex-god. He was stripped of his status when he was sent to the mists I'm pretty sure. That's why we were able to fight him, because he wasn't at his most powerful state I guess.
---
Guardian for aegis share, pulls on demand, and big CC; all things chronomancers also bring on the table. You also have a small group heal if needed. The animations and skills are neat and survivability is better than what weaver has. The rotation is simple but has some depth, you really need to know a bit about your damage modifiers. Wonderful class. 
---
Is nobody gonna mention  that Logan is touching the edge of burning Sohothin with his bare hands? Like wtf so much wrong with this image.
---
wvw: cut ranger longbow damage in half
---
wvw: reduce soulbeast mobility by 50%, seriously... nothing can catch it
---
I see RP happening sometimes and I don't see why people get so mad about it. If they're doing anything inappropriate you can report them, but otherwise they're not doing anything wrong so just ignore them if you don't like RP. Those people probably play fashion wars pretty intensely too so they probably buy cosmetic stuff that helps keep the game alive. I say let them have fun the way they want to.
---
I got 2 of during prebuff before chaos endboss last night, it was awesome!
---
Usually, a VPN does not decrease ping-times, but increases them. The reason is that usually, packet have "a longer way to travel" when using a VPN.
---
Now, there are cases, where a VPN might actually help. In those cases, traffic without VPN isn't going the optimal route or is throttled (which might just be a political decision, not a technical one).
---
For you route, a ping of 230ms is likely close to the best you can get. Assuming 10Mm distance EU-Asia and 200Mm/s speed of light in fiber optics, 100ms alone just come from the light traveling, if it were a "straight line" (Earth surface). In addition to that, you likely do have some hops on that route, each adding their share (longer distance + delay from routing).
---
Congrats, you found a skilled player with a bunker build, welcome to pvp
---
99% sure you are correct. In one of my guilds a guy has his main and 2 alts in it. The account name is the same for all 3 but the numbers are different.
---
That legit sounds fun (not being sarcastic)
---
calling rytlock a side character is... bold.
---
everyone that is in "our" guild and were in destinies edge is a main character. even marjory and kas still are.
---
Are they actually RPing? I've been there and thought they were just sorta hanging out
---
it's just a matter of time and they will get tired of updating it and it won't be enough money people start leaving and then they will  shut down the game just like the did City of Heroes.
---
I will never forgive them for that.
---
The only class that can truly live up to that, IMO, is Necromancer. Either in Power Reaper, Condi Scourge, or Vanilla Power variants. They have pretty much double the HP of other classes but lack much of the active mitigation and stability spam that most classes have. 
---
However, it's important to note that every Necro spec is incredibly weak in 1vX scenarios due to their passive mitigation mechanics not scaling at all with the number of people you're fighting. (For example, Engineer Elixir S makes you immune to damage, no matter how many people you fight. Death Shroud goes down twice as fast against 2 people, 3 times as fast against 3, etc.). This actually make you entirely unable to wade into group fights without a support. Plus low mobility is a massive downside in all PvP modes.
---
My recommendation for you is to play Spellbreaker, Holosmith, or Firebrand. Those three classes are extremely tanky through their active mitigation abilities and heals while dishing out incredible damage and are more than capable of taking large fights without dedicated suppor.
---
Well if you read the novel you'd know that's what happens when you let a mesmer in your head. She could have escaped through the Asura gate, but chose to talk to Logan.
---
You can alao rightclick the launch icon and under 'run with graphic processor" you choose the nvidia high performance chip
---
sure didn't in the Desert Highlands though. where we first chased him.
---
It's not even remotely like Braham, though. Whereas Braham became horribly self-destructive and generally unlikable. And ANet wrote it to all be very in-your-face and we just had to sit through it.
---
But this is clearly something Rytlock has been dealing with for years, only now really coming to a head. And even then, he's still dealing with it in a pretty mature manner. In fact, I love the idea of him wanting to distance himself from Sohothin.
---
This is totally not an issue to me.
---
Yes, I remember this week, I guess most barrels in this mission are lost because people fall asleep.
---
I'm really glad they didn't nerf Tarir's difficulty into the ground the way they did with the Chak Gerent fight.  For the first 5 or 6 months of HoT, Gerent was a boss fight on the level of like Tequatl and Great Jungle Wurm.  You needed a crapload of communication and commanders who knew the fight backwards, or you'd fail.  Now you can do it fairly easily, and I kind of miss old Gerent.  Tarir still being a failable event kind of makes me happy, in a weird way.
---
For me at least, I hated HoT because at release it had an absolutely abysmal ratio of time spent to rewards earned.  You would spend an hour grinding events in Verdant Brink to get maybe 150 airship parts.  The "HoT 2.0" patch they did about 6 months after release fixed a LOT, and now I'm absolutely one of those people who loves that expansion.
---
Yeah I have it. The ride back up is my therapy and has saved me from launching my mouse across the room is all ;)
---
There’s a small patch of green beneath Vault Nu, or whatever the vault outside of Rata Arcanum is, the Treasure Mushroom spawns there. So it should just be above were you currently are
---
Turning off chat and chat bubbles makes PvP a bit more bearable. 
---
Except Tangled Depths.  Screw Tangled.
---
yeah, the code is in ancient latin so who know how it works or how to change it. just rng. praise the old code gods. /s
---
miss the forged? only when I'm blinded
---
WTFast needs to be directed to the right server for gw2. 
---
The auto detection doesn't work since they moved to amazon servers.
---
If you launched the game and then installed Geforce Experience and then launched the game again to test, then your results are probably flawed. It will boot up and load faster the second time unless you were doing a bunch of other stuff or restarted between tests.
---
From my experience, Geforce Experience is just bloatware that more often auto-configures to baffling settings (e.g. I've had it turn graphics way up and set games to 4:3 on a 1080p display multiple times). You can force a game to use your dedicated GPU instead of integrated graphics without it.
---
All the appreciation!
---
Attack on Tarir is still my favourite soundtrack track.
---
Hm. I'll check it out later today, thanks :)
---
4 mesmers and a healer could def do all fractals as a group, T4's may be harder depending on what instabs you get but could absolutely work in any fractal tier
---
Im rich you know.
---
It's so cool of you to do a run like this. I do not have the PoF story complete, but next month I would love to participate if I'm ready.
---
Thank you for this! If it's okay, I'll add you in advance! 
---
Probably not the place to say this but I've honestly stopped playing the game much at all due to ANet seemingly ignoring too many things that could use updating or just some sort of attention, meanwhile new gemstore stuff pops up constantly.  I get you're putting time into what makes you money, but at this point I have more fun playing GW1 still.  There is too big of a list Anet readily ignores of player wants/needs, but look a new single-piece gemstore outfit you can't make your own!
---
PvP, WvW, Dungeons, Guild Missions, actual GvG, ***BUILD TEMPLATES***, the list goes on.  It's frustrating, sincerely frustrating.  I mean, ***the fucking community*** ***had to bring your game into DX12 for you***.  I don't know what Anet's employment looks like, how stretched they might be across different departments, all I can sincerely say is I don't like how this game's dev time is being managed from a player standpoint.  And that may attract tons of disagreement downvotes, but I just hope someone on the team sees this and can add this to their jar of complaints to ignore they keep by the water cooler when they need a laugh.
---
I mean... that guy is right about Mirage.
---
&gt; Caithe and Zojja where running around in circles back and forth going "Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop!" 
---
You made my day.
---
You measure time...? On a consistent environment, which is not for 95% of the game
---
&gt;toon
---
Are you serious? They've been extremely overpowered in PvE for 6 years. Banners even moreso than Spirits.
---
The most efficient farming methods involve doing world events with large groups of players, so your race or class is really not relevant at all.
---
Experience Booster: +50% Experience in **ALL GAME TYPES**
---
**+50% Reward Track Gain in PvP** and WvW
---
Celebration Bonus: 100% boost to magic find, WvW rank gain, experience from kills, and gold from kills. **10% bonus to PvP** and WvW reward track progress.
---
wrong sub
---
Advice: do some research before ignorantly proclaiming the meta is still the same. 
---
Exactly, reward track gain.
---
You do not get experience in PvP and WvW. Thus the bonus to experience is irrelevant.
---
The thing that you are looking at is rank points, not experience points. And the boosters do not effect rank points. 
---
Chronomancer is still overpowered, but Renegade + Firebrand together can do almost everything a single Chronomancer can do.
---
It's much more fun and it's a nice change of pace from the never-ending 3-year-running Chronomancer-dominant meta.
---
Could you post a link to your or a similar build? Sounds interesting and I'd like to try it, but haven't played firebrand at all, so I've got no idea how to trait and equip.
---
Do you run CMs or T4 only with such group setups?  
---
Ok, so why wasn't I gaining extra Reward track either.
---
Idk, I thought mordremoth was *perfect*. The first time I did dragons stand I was absolutely blown away. 
---
You never mentioned reward track gain in your original post. Was that also part of the issue? 
---
So the next one will be on March 4th? Will it be 9:30pm EST again?
---
Yes! Exact same time frame :)
---
1st generation legendaries are way too easy to get, meaning that you can just outright buy it on the TP. This probably was a problem in the Devs' eyes, hence the  "If you want it, you gotta earn it" I am actually a fan of this philosophy.
---
I wish I could :(
---
Ya please add me! Hope to see you at the next one!
---
Tangled Depths is the only map that I've ever managed to get out of using mounts so far. So... I'm not *that* surprised.
---
Grats! ^^now ^^repeat ^^it ^^on ^^your ^^8 ^^characters
---
;)
---
Awesome, marking my calendar! 😄
---
That was an amazing fight though. It was so intense, and my commanders VA did a great job pacing the fight. 
---
I will take this week's double puzzle over last week's double Save Our Supplies any day ;_;
---
In all seriousness though, it appears to be abandoned content and I just wish they'd admit it at this point. I still remember a developer saying how this current system would allow for more Guild Missions to be added, right before HoT was released. 
---
It seems to me that Rytlock has been, from the very beginning, the kind of Charr who never really enjoyed their traditions in the first place. If he did, he wouldn’t have put distance between himself and his warband, he wouldn’t have stayed away from his Tribune duties back in the Citadel, and he wouldn’t be galavanting across Tyria with The Commander and Friends. Rytlock tried to conform to Charr traditions, but, clearly, they just aren’t suited for him. Just like they aren’t suited for Rox. 
---
It’s 110% okay for these characters to part with tradition. 
---
I’m really sorry this is a sticking point for you, because you are clearly very frustrated with it. And I can understand that, sometimes, when an author decides to go a different route than the one we were expecting, it can be jarring and unsettling. 
---
Maybe skip the requiem stories?? And try to focus on in game instead. 
---
one per week? more like one per hour
---
Probably not having to be terrified of taking a week off. In WoW, a week of this expansion means in free gear from: warfront, M+, Conquest cap, Lfr-Heroic, and world quests.  Not having to deal with the stress of missing that “free” loot is pretty sweet imo.
---
It's only the middle of January where you live?
---
The problem I had with the dream version is the dragon itself was just so uninspired. This incredibly powerful elder dragon we spent so long fighting and talking to while he snakes his way across the world, killing so many people, creating such awesome looking creatures. Then we got a wood textured Peter Griffin 
---
hey, i have a [herald of glint](https://imgur.com/a/5uTyW0z) too! i love the darkness of yours though! 
---
PoF is fun for world building if you care about humans and/or GW1
---
to be fair, mirage really is that fucking obnoxious. Gw2 combat is so fluid and action-based. The actions are well animated, and dodging feels smooth.
---
In comes mirage, mesmer alone has a lot of visual vomit, on top of this, mirage has built in target breakers, ambush attacks (which can be tripled with infinite horizon) that eat screen space. Shatters already have no telegraph.
---
Now, add in the fact that mirage has the highest burst-condi potential in the game means you have to spend most of your time staring at the little condi icons at the bottom of your screen to know when to clear to avoid 5k ticks (which should be impossible with condi builds, because the whole point of condi is not dealing that much damage in 1 tick).
---
It doesn’t help that it’s also a multi-condi build, so you never know exactly what’s killing you.
---
My main is called "Golden Child Anri". What title she has should be obvious. I love Tarir so much. 
---
I've set my sight on a legendary, which makes every meta event and nearly everything I do worth it to some extent. That's what I do, besides fractals and raids. 
---
I do some events, farm some stuff, but never enough of the same to get burnt out.
---
I love the herald armor as a herald main myself. But it bugs me that the silver parts always stay silver, even when you paint them black...
---
I am running 32gb, and it happens to me after waypointing mostly. Annoying as heck.
---
Guild name checks out.
---
^gz!
---
I'm honestly getting fed up with so many people in the community behaving as if the PvP scene is this endless cesspool of filth and human cancers. 
---
There are ENOUGH good players out there that are respectful and only want a nice and fair game. 
---
And regardless, it does not take long to block these people, or remove map/talk chat if really necessary. 
---
Yes, there are a notable amount of bad apples in the pvp community but helping the community heal is done by helping it give the tools to become better, not by shitting on it over and over again with posts like these!
---
If you like pvp in the game, and want to see it thrive, then stop demonizing it and actually help it become better by making it better yourself.
---
Got some pretty noticeable artifacting, when using the map button it take at least 15 seconds to actually see it and my mini map is black. Anyone else have the same issue?
---
I don't harass them, but I find it extremely weird to be 'playing pretend' in an actual game..
---
Mate... that's not how anything works. How is Animation connected to RAM in any way, shape or form? If you said VRAM, alright... but there is no GPU with 16gigs, and even then it would be GDDR5 or HBM2, not DDR4. You have no clue what you're talking about, so shut the hell up before you start blaming this or that.
---
Renegade! Healing Renegade, Power Alacrigade, Condi Renegade, I like em all.
---
I don't think so.
---
I just have a grudge against Anet.  They closed down City of Heroes.  I believe it's a matter a time for them to close GW2.  
---
I can say as level 80 arrives you should finish the main story of your character first. Gearwise check the website metabattle.com and check Open World builds for now. There are some core builds there ( no expansion required ) which you can do. Exotic gears will be enough but if you cannot get them yet rare gear is good enough but may struggle. If you still enjoy playing the game after completing map and stuff you can buy the expansion and will be ready for most of the contents but i recommend a friendly guild to help you through the earlier parts and hero points in expansion.
---
Allocation of memory is allocation of memory. A GPU is just a CPU with more memory for storage. You wanna argue  about allocating, or raiding RAM argue with someone else.
---
The ammount of cosplay you can pull off in this game is insanely impressive.
---
[This is my second favourite after the family guy one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acjnou/the_futurama_crew/)
---
Dragon Stand not so much, three lanes just like in mobas.
---
Necromancer because I dislike dying. Right now I'm running a stupid as hell vampire scourge build that is ridiculously healthy and it's tons of fun running around map completing with it.
---
Second from necro is probably Thief on a gunslinger build.
---
God bless
---
As a little bit of input - if you decide to run with no healer, then the FB/Ren combo offers more sustain because of the crazy lifesteal that Kalla's elite offers. If you just play it safe with a healer, then druid or Ren are what I think offer the most, tho some ppl prefer other healers and have valid arguments, no question.
---
Elementalist! I stayed by Tempest for a long time after PoF's release but now main Weaver. The special oomf all their skills have, the fast reflexes, the huge amount of skills to learn make it really fun for me. 
---
Right but, Jennah would have died otherwise. And without Jennah, there'd be no peace treaty between humans and charr. Without that, there'd be no Pact to stop Zhaitan. And even if the Pact still happened it'd be significantly weaker without contributions from the Iron Legion. Without the Pact, Zhaitan would've successfully invaded Lion's Arch and then the rest of Tyria.
---
Jennah is one of the most significant characters in GW2. Even if Logan only saved Jennah because he was madly in love with her, Tyria likely would have been fucked had he chosen not to.
---
Why would you playing it forcefully if you hate it? Fresh air and unravel can help in certain builds/situations, but you'll still have to fully attune on 4 second cooldown most of the time.
---
You'll either have to adapt to that or not fully attune and both of those can be, depending on content, either irrelevant or required.
---
WHen I'm not raiding or doing fractals, I like sPVP.  When I'm PvP'd out, winterberry farm and map completions.  
---
He had been sealed beforehand, but I don't know how much he was really weakened.  It took all five other gods teaming up on him to seal him away, after all, and when he was breaking free in Nightfall the only help the five gods could give was essentially "You can do it, mortals, believe in yourselves."
---
So the GW1 hero PC and companions did what the five gods themselves couldn't do, by actually killing Abaddon.  Fortunately, Kormir was there to absorb his power after his death and take his position, or else things might have gotten really out of hand!
---
I want to enjoy my ele, it was my main for over 5 years, but I suck at Weaver. I guess I just need more practice. 
---
No, Jennah wouldn't have died otherwise, Logan was an absolute non factor. Jennah pulled some city wide illusion to save everyone from getting branded when Kralk flew by, Logan killed a few dudes, opened a gate, and talked to a crowd. Did nothing that someone else like, I dunno, a mesmer with citywide powers couldn't.
---
Quagganmire?
---
I hope gw2 will be like gw1, by the time they even consider "pulling the plug" it takes up so little server space they might as well keep it. 
---
Refresh my memory  but can some ok be not un the guild check for him? If im ever on the map and I hear a guild asking for help with this mission im always willing to help if I can
---
Well you said it yourself. Soulbeast and dragonhunter dps have some of the highest support capabilities among all dps. As far as playstyle goes, they are actually quite similar; they both have incredible burst and similar logic behind their rotation - stack all the big dmg skills with the big dmg modifiers. For guardian you'd use greatsword for your big dmg burst and scepter+focus to fill downtime; soulbeast also uses greatsword though it's big burst comes from axe off-hand, the main-hand weapon there can be dagger, sword or axe (the latter bringing less dmg in organised content but notably better solo due to range and might stacking).
---
Agree with this post. Illusions actually make mesmer kind of tanky. Greatsword/staff is the same combination that I use in open world. 
---
For ele, use the elemental glyphs to summon the magic critters to tank for you. 
---
Farm what? 
---
I assume he has max model limit and quality.
---
so do I.
---
Don't insult the 660ti like that... 
---
I miss mine :(
---
Norn are Dumb
---
Spellbreaker Warrior. I use full Ventari stats and essentially rely on outlasting whatever I fight rather than destroying it outright.
---
Comes in handy during story chapters as well, as most of the time the fights are balanced around the idea that the person might be going full berserker. So having a short block(Full Counter) a long block(Shield 5) and the anti projectile elite(The giant bubble, forget its exact name) means that I have plenty of time to pick up how the fight is supposed to go, and survive most hits that were meant to punish.
---
There have been only two times this has ever backfired on me. The first was the Tarir trials during HoT(I hate stoneheads) and the second was the fight against the boss during the Domain of the lost segment of PoF. That heal was particularly nasty since it set it to pretty much full health on a dime.
---
Otherwise, its rather hilarious to go mano-a-legion and walk away relatively alive. And at rare times I'll find a random person who didn't go full cookie cutter in WvW that can't actually kill me. I'm looking at you random mesmer who tried to keep me from getting that monument for the daily. Your stealth spam was your downfall.
---
I'm trying to somewhat replicate the idea with a Deadeye, with what I call the "Tank Sniper", but I have yet to succeed in that endeavor. One day I'll make it a reality though...
---
Beautiful.
---
You already have alternative means. The repeatable achievements and pvp/wvw. Making hem craft able to is not a solution to people not playing the content 
---
The problem is that Josh Foreman is exceptionally good at his job of environment design, and it's very easy to keep him extremely busy with the current Living World style and cadence. Without a large amount of his time (and others' time), there's just no way to get SAB finished. ANet just won't invest their money that way, which is unfortunate in my opinion.
---
love it
---
Even the story behind Tarir, (#s "that it was built by the forgotten to house the legacy of Glint") is amazing, especially when you realize how relevant it is right now. I'm replaying the whole story at the moment (just got to Act III of HoT), I always find it crazy that every event has lead us to where we are now, rather than just some big event happening with no correlation. 
---
Well not paying attention to you is still better then them openly mocking and making fun of you.
---
No gear inflation. Ascended is difficult to get but not impossibly so, and makes getting a set feel like you're earning something. More reactive combat. Better economy. Professions (crafting) actually matter. Class identity hasn't been destroyed by endless homogenization. 
---
