Wow, hard to believe nobody actually reported that bug with Matthias. Do you think maybe it was reported in-game but just got buried in all the other reports? But yeah, it seems like posting something to Reddit gets more attention than actual in-game reports.
---

---
I don't remember seeing any posts on Reddit about the exploit, so maybe that's why it took so long for them to realize it.
---
---
---
Nice job on making us look like a bunch of tossers..
---
Warbringer, The Ascension and beginning the journey towards a set of WvW legendary armor.
---
There's a precedent for this, and I'm saying this as someone who loves to wield Juggernaut in front of people who don't have it yet. But my second legendary was Chuka and Champawat, and one of the steps in that collection is to discover a bunch of tiger dens, and afterwards, you get the Spirit Tiger mini. I had that done before I even considered getting the shortbow. So perhaps if they did something like that... do the hunt around the maps for the various oozes to put in your terrarium, akin to the Tiger Den hunt.
---
Perfect, thanks.

If you can do fractal cm's you will be fine in raids.

Snap! Thanks
---
This is the kind of shit I'm talking about that has enabled it lol
---
Tbh, unless you're into raiding, end-game is still kinda farming silverwastes for gold, haha. 
---
Forgot about this map lol. it's the meta event that was never finished. Let's release something and never finish it or update it ever. Exploiting it? Now we care
---
Honestly I would rather them just make the item endless actually with an on and off switch that way you can stack it with whatever other novelty item you want.  Much like the tigers on your back from Chuka.
---
people already got 24h suspensions earlier today.
---
Idk, but I think reporting a bug is not that common as it should be. 
---
A few times, when I saw someone complaining about a bug and how long it takes to fix it, is asked if he reported it. Some really did, but there were also answers like "this bug exists for so long, they must know about it" or "How could that bug be unseen, don't they play their own game" and so on. Also on Reddit I saw statements like "It was posted on reddit several times, they should know about it".
---
I think it's likely that the bug with matthias really wasn't reported officially. 
---
The helmet kind of looks like [Canthan Armo](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warrior_Canthan_armorr).
---
But it doesn't really resemble any particular GW1 armor.
---
Well your account is on a home server. I for instance am on Fort Aspenwood. I ask because it is nice to know when suggesting wvw things to players. If you are on a link server it might also be nice to know who is your host server you are paired with. 
---
It's close enough to the promotion, if you contact support you might be able to get a partial refund.
---
I like this game :)

ANet never puts HoT up for sale by itself anymore.  DLGamer would be the best option for that.

How many gold did you throw to get 2 ? Just curious

That's the spirit! :D

Give me some for my endless upgrade extractor hahahaha. I will never ever have more gold than I need lolol
---
Fun Fact: the Runescape map is actually up-side down. It was originally going to have The Wild to the South and the Kharidian Desert to the north, but one of the Gower Brothers had mistakenly put it as it currently is.
---
As was foretold. Or speculated heavily, anyway.
---
Find applications for what cannot be applied.
---
Note: DLGamer is an official ArenaNet Retailer, so you are safe to use this deal!
---
just a correction: that's alacrity renegade, not power. the power revenant build still runs Herald, and pulls less DPS than a core warrior iirc. the utilities it brings aren't better than support renegade's alacrity share, so, power herald is not even mentioned as a meme (like power reaper)
---
1. power dps revenant in pve ~~is Herald~~ doesn't exist.
---
2. condi dps reventant is renegade
---
3. healer revenant is renegade
---
4. power support (diviner's) revenant is renegade
---
5. condi support revenant is renegade
---
6. hands kiter revenant is Herald.

7. pvp gamemodes revenant is herald.

Been playing since release. Only have 8,284. Man, I've been slacking.

Oh looks...its the armor skins that came out right around the release of Legendary Raid armor....that didn't have dyeable auras and permanent silver tint

Would I be able to upgrade to PoF collectors this way?
---
Wow that short?
---
Working my Daredevil build, and now it felt fun to use. Decent damage, Condi cleanse, evade, i love it. 
---
Actually being new to gw2 and having played Tera back in the day for years, I think gw2 combat feels very much like teras did. Positioning, movement, combos, ect.    
---
Had I realized this game was so similar (I always thought gw2 would be like 1 with mostly instanced areas and stuff, never knew it was a full fledged mmo) I would have started it years ago.   
---
It has a lot on Tera as well with multiple weapons, builds, Ellie specs per class. I'm enjoying it a lot! Bought both xpacs. Steal at 25 bucks.

oh yes, but then WB underestimated how much making a mmo costs.

So the game was almost done, it was in fact almost at alfa testing phase. When the money ran out and it was canceled. I remember following it being made.

Yeah, that time investment of forging is something I didn't consider when I wrote that, lmao.

Is SAB really starting on THURSDAY? Unexpected for an event to not start on Tuesday. I wouldn't care expected I want to take the day off to enjoy it, and if it's not tomorrow, I need to work tomorrow :D

I always see the achievement point log as a way to figure out what I'm going to do next. I just pick achievements and track the ones I want to work on at any given time. 
---
For example, at this moment I only have one achievement left in Elon Riverlands, so that's something I'm eventually going to want to do, just to put it behind me.
---
There are tons of collections to work on in this game. Find a set of skins you want, and go for it.  If you're looking for ideas, I like both the funerary weapon skins and the Stellar weapons as well.

&gt; what gem store things to buy
---
In my opinion, these are the priorities for gem store items. You should definitely get all of these before you start purchasing cosmetics and such:
---
1. **Living Story Season 3 episodes**, especially "A Crack in the Ice". While it's not truly *pay to win*, this season is one of the best ways to acquire ascended trinkets for your characters. Plus, being able to experience the story is nice. If you're interested in getting as much of the story as possible, **Living Story 2** is a good buy as well. Note that this content requires a Level 80 character, but getting to Level 80 is pretty quick in this game even if you're avoiding using the boosts that come with the game. In particular, though, the Living Story 2 episode "Tangled Paths" also offers a reward that keeps on giving the more characters you make: it costs 200 gems and provides you with a Black Lion Key once per character on completion. This means you're getting five keys for 200 gems base, and adding a key's worth of value to every character you make in the future. **Living Story Season 4 episodes** are also usually a good buy, but it looks like ArenaNet is giving them away for free in this event one week at a time so just grab them one by one for zero gems as they become available. Future Living Story episodes are free as long as you log in during the episode!
---
1. Basic account enhancements like **character slots**, **bank space**, or other such items. If you have HoT and PoF, you already have two shared inventory slots, which should be enough for the two most important convenience items gems can buy. 
---
1. The first of the two convenience items is the **Mistlock Sanctuary Pass**. Seriously, this offers so much more up front compared to every other convenience item in the game. It's the best crafting/shop hub. Because it gives you the ability to use its facilities without losing your place in the open world, it's also basically a slightly less convenient version of the salvage-o-matics and infinite harvesting tools for all your characters due to the ability to buy regular tools and basic salvage kits in your pocket dimension. Other lounge passes like the Royal Terrace or Lava Lounge actually teleport you to another map. If you do Fractals, you can even park alts at resource farms or JP chests and still bring them into fractals without losing that place in the world. It's the best convenience item in the game, bar none. If you'd rather have a battle arena and access to WvW team chat than a Fractal entrance, you could also pick up the **Armistice Bastion pass** which also works like the Mistlock Sanctuary and stores your open world position.
---
1. The second (and often mistakenly told to newbies as the first and most important gem upgrade in the whole game) convenience item is the Copper-fed salvage-o-matic. Don't bother with silver or runecrafter, their return over using silver instead of mystic for rares and runecrafter over copper for greens will take an eternity to pay off and the runecrafter in particular will make "right click salvage all" more of a hassle than just sticking with the copper. Note: With the changes to how gear drops (it'll drop in "unidentified gear" items that stack instead of individual weapons and armor that clogs up the inventory), filled inventory should be a lot smaller of a QoL issue.
---
Trying not to leave the game and never come back while waiting on wing 7 that we will probably get in 105 days.

It's super cool to see the leaders of the meta pack encouraging people to try out off-meta builds and compositions. I really appreciate you guys for prompting this. Kudos to all the creative participants as well :)
---
good point tbh
---
i made two legendaries when i only had 8 characters; i now have 27 and still only have two legendaries; altoholicsm is damn expensive
---
Getting my Engineer caught up in story. All of my other characters have completed All or Nothing. I'm also about 4k Fractal Relics away from getting the Infinite Mist Omnipotion, so I'm doing T4s every so often. Eventually, I may complete making Quip since I did the collection for making the precursor Chaos Gun.
---
After all that, I intend to make a Human Revenant.
---
Realtalk; How do people like you get so much money? Investments? Farming?
---
Cause i tried to start Nevermore Vol 2 today and dropped down to 7 liquid gold before realizing “hey maybe i should slow my roll” ^^;;
---
There needs to be 3 servers for WvW and they need to make it cheap and easy for people to transfer, just like back in season 1. I miss those days.
---
I want gw3, brand new experience, new engine, better class balance, better graphics. But the same core aspects that make gw2 so great, easy trading post, easy character customization, good story lines, awesome ideas such as fractals and wvw(besides server restrictions).
---
Reminded me of the [Elite Templar Armor](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Warrior_Elite_Templar_armor_m.jpg)

It's way more fun with a friend! Can't play the game withtout one anymore and still trying to get one friend to do Story with me on our alts, but she's too busy recently so rip

\- While it's nice to have LA or DR hosts the events and have the decorations there. Claw island would be a perfect place to put everything.

\- A big memorial (Memorial Island) for all of the fallen soldiers from the orders that helped you and the one that you join. (Tybalt) The only charr I liked.
---
\- Update the island, more stuff I can't remember atm.
---
Yeah , same here i bought PoF at a higher price :/
---
Thanks for the reply. I understand your point, but since I primarily play open world PvE, I'll stick with my PowerHerald rather than Renegade.
---
there's no real future planned as far as we can see, its season 5 and then we have no idea. i doubt anet will actually tell us anything, they might have a plan or they might not, we probably wont find out until after season 5. if you don't have confidence in the future of the game then you are just gonna have to wait and see. i'm in the same boat, i still play but a lot less now, just not gonna spend any more money on the game until i see evidence of a future.

I dont. with the state MMOS are rn I dont think gw3 would survive

---
&gt;continuously attack without dismounting.
---
They said it will be fixed today as well as nerf to jump and stealth.
---
They are fixing some of that stuff too.  [You would knownif you could be bothered to search a bit instead of going full-grump mode.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/71944/upcoming-warclaw-bug-fixes-changes)
---
Nothing is certain in life except death and taxes. Just play to have fun and move on when when it’s time. I love the game and will play until servers shut down.
---
Ofcourse they don't owe any customer anything but they need us to survive.
---
They could've invested the money lost in FAILED projects to create another expansion and make more money but not only did they lose money, they also lost trust of many PAYING customers.
---
Dude! We're getting a swamp!
---
Anet is a company. Saying they're working on a shoestring is ridiculous. Do you realize how few MMOs work with 400 people in the staff? This is not a reasonable thought process.
---
Anet isn't obligated to tell you everything they do. You play the game based on what you like or don't like about the game. What difference does it make if there are 200 people or 250 people or 275 people working on the game?  How would you even know the difference?
---
How many people are working on any game from any developer? 
---
What's infuriating to me is people who haven't got a fucking clue how businesses are run and they come to reddit, and talk through their ass. 
---
You're entitled to access to a game. You don't know what the budget is. You don't know how many people are working on the  game. You don't know if it's a lot or it's not a lot and you never have. 
---
I'm not sure where this entitlement comes from, but you are entitled to a buy to play game for which you paid and presumably have access too.  You're entitled to very little else. 
---
I think this is what I am about to do :D
---
I did search, I mentioned it above. Clearly not hard enough. Also, not full grump mode, this mode has been out 20 days, and was delayed 2 weeks, it came out with gamebreaking bugs, I'm only posting now.
---
Also, although alot of changes were mentioned in that post, neither of the ones I mentioned were. The first one being the major one.
---
&gt;We're working on a fix for the issue where people can get stuck on their mount, and still have their 3 evades and such. There may be more than one bug that causes this, but we think we're getting the most egregious one.
---
This mentions the evades, which was an issue, I'm talking about the ability 1, that's a player pouncing without dismounting, the ability 1 causes damage to other players, that's not the evade.
---
You linked the changes posed, but perhaps you should of read both the changes and my post. Because what I mentioned, is not in the post for changes.
---
Next specialisation: punctuationbreaker
---
If it’s most likely covered that’s fine, but would be nice if it were mentioned, seeing as a mounted attack without dismount sounds like a bigger issue to just call ‘and such’.
---
I only said you perhaps hadn’t read my post as you seemed to imply that what I had written was in the forum post, even though the only thing that was, was the dismounting jump, which I was already semi aware of.
---
&gt; But in the past month, we haven't really heard anything about the future. Is anything changing? Will there be another Living World season? Is an expansion coming eventually? What's planned for raids, fractals, PvP, and WvW? What about new features?
---
Its not like they didnt address these questions in their first statement after the lay-offs:
---
&gt; The next episodes of Living World are already in development, Swiss tournament support is coming to PvP, we’re looking at more WvW events coming soon, and the return of the Super Adventure Festival is imminent. Our long-term plans for the game like World Restructuring and large-scale improvements to quality of life are still in the works.
---
Fair point, I get my miscommunication now, sorry about that.
---
I’m interpreting the “and such” meant that the dismounting bug is putting the mount piece of the state machine that controls the player character transforms.
---
I assume it puts the player into a weird state that causes a whole slew of issues depending on the existing state when the bug occurs.  I.e. depending on when/how the bug happens causes varying effects and unintended interactions (like the issues you described)
---
Yeah I stopped spending immediately as soon as the news broke. This game is already old and I was on the fence about supporting it already because the news PoF is last expansion.
---
The game's entire future is a map and some 10 min story chapters every 4 months? With some crappy grindy achievements that give 2ap? Count me out sry.
---
I did love this game, but I don't want to be on board the ship while it slowly sinks. 
---
They are usually pretty agreeable about that.  File a support ticket.
---
Can I use the Welcome back discount to buy the Ultimate Edition, even though I already have PoF?
---
Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire—Digital Deluxe Upgrade (worth 2,400 Gems)
---
4000 Gems	(worth 4,000 gems)
---
Total value = 6,400 gems
---
6,400 Gems in Gems store = £68.00
---
Ultimate Edition with discount = £35
---
Definitely goes out to a week or so, for both cash purchase or gem store purchase.
---
I just did this back in December for a gem store sale.
---
I think you broke that spell
---
Technically I can. Got asc and legendary gear, but the kp is killing me. Same in raids. Sitting in low li makes life difficult :P 
---
Sucks that it's not 50% for just HoT. I wanted to buy 3 more accounts, but HoT only, for log in rewards and dailies. (PoF Dailies bore me)
---
You mean, thirsty?
---
Why not?
---
Wasn't it level 49?
---
THANK YOU!! i didn't know about this site. HoT is currently 40% off, i'm grabbing 3 keys :)
---
They say it how it is
---
Did you not read the post? This is a strange question
---
I have it every other level 60 key run I do with a friend and has probably been reported quite a few times since but since the bug is at the very start of the instance if it ever becomes blocking (because most of the time I can manage to get out) you can always restart quickly.
---
(Also that was not a question which is kinda what this thread is all about)
---
&gt; Is anything changing?
---
yes
---
&gt; Will there be another Living World season?
---
they already told us last anniversary that there will be a season 5 directly after season 4. why are you asking this?
---
&gt; Is an expansion coming eventually?
---
no.
---
&gt; What's planned for raids?
---
wing 7 is in the finalization phase (twitch comments of a few devs)
---
&gt; fractals
---
they still get released with every 2nd LS release.
---
&gt; PvP
---
swiss tournaments, player generated automated tournaments, new conquest and 2v2 maps (Djinn's Dominion, Asura Arena are the latest), new rewards, new special tournaments
---
&gt; WvW
---
the mount already forgotten? alliance system is in the works, new rewards.
---
&gt; What about new features?
---
we get them all the time... today we will get a new loot system.
---
Quite good.  I play with my partner, and we enjoy it a lot.  Also has a nice system where it downlevels you to the area you are in but you still get drops at your level, so while a character can't usefully go to a higher level area a higher level character can always play with lower level characters in their areas.
---
Tip: do the personal story individually at levels 10, 20, and 30, then choose the same faction at the end of the level 30 chapter and you can play the story together from then on (you can play together before that, but it doesn't advance the story unless you are the exact same race and background, so you'd have to do it for each player and they're the only one who will get rewards).
---
Oh, you may also need to all pick races that can do the same "racial sympathy" path ([see here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Racial_sympathy)), if staying together as much as possible is important for you.  That's basically just for the level 50 chapter.  After that, you're good indefinitely as long as you're all ok with the same story choices.

HoT and PoF are literally superhero films. Your ragtag team of oddballs regroup for a last hurrah against the wicked forces of evil, throwing out quippy one-liners right up until someone dies tragically. I'd care if any of the characters had more depth than a puddle.

P.S  Bring somthing to start a fire, we must burn these Heretics out!!

Dear OP, the dismount jump allows you to climb  into several objectives without breaching walls or gates. A nice example is blue EB keep or alpine garri.

Welcome to the forums and sub-reddits, where angry people type complaints and content people play the game.
---
If you have a guild im sure some1 will be more than willing to teach you about fractals.
---
Tier 1 fractals are also very easy to do so dont fret too much about them. Free xp and masteries. Aswell as a chance for ascended drops decent gold and a taste of near endgame content.
---
....
---
Yeah well, I came here to stay away from Sekiro discussions so that I can wait for a discount but my will is getting weaker, especially as a fan of souls games and dmc like action games alike. Looks like it is worth the full price, eh?

You're right. There should be more tiers during the peak 6-hours!

"Winning faction for the week gets to claim all the rewards from their current reward track based on participation pips. Losing factions get to a claim up to half of reward track progress based on participation pips."
---
I like your idea, everyone will be motivated to win, wouldn't people who's on the losing side be little too frustrated?
---
This is far from being worst case scenario. Currently we can expect about 2 years of guaranteed content releases through season 5. We still have no confirmation what (if any) comes after.
---
I can't imagine it getting any worse than that. 
---
It's a trowel.
---
&gt; What did they tell us before the layoffs
---
Before LW3 started we already knew another expansion is in works so we had something to speculate on. Today all we know there is yet another season of the same coming after season 5. What's coming after? Is 3rd expansion ever going to be released? Is there anything planned after season 5 at all?
---
The situation is not the same as "always".
---
I once got Skyrim Legendary Edition for £2.50 and nothing will ever compare to that value. That being said, this is still a great bargain, shame I've already got the games :(
---
The map I reeeally want unlocked is the Arah map where we fight Zhaitan in our final personal story instance. It's such a beautiful map, you can see a lot of thought went into it and there's probably a lot of lore hidden there as well. If I remember correctly, Wooden Potatoes once said that Anet intended for us to get off the airship and fight the dragon on the ground, but then they had to cut the encounter short and we got the lame canon spam instead. 
---
But there is one thing even the most intricate game design cannot fix - thats player mentality. You mentioned it, " *You need to flock players together with a desire to win.* " Sadly that's almost impossible because while most players want to win, they don't want to invest themselves, and the moment the odds are against them, they give up.
---
I play Battlefield V daily, mostly 64 player conquest, and i damn love that game. But more often than not these 32 v 32 games bring to light how the average player operates: as long as the sun shines for them, they're out and about, but if they're met with the slightest obstacle, they give up and hang back even though that further decimates their chances of winning. The whole issue of players not playing the objective is another story and not really applicable for GW2 WvW, but the player mentality is a 1:1 carbon copy of what i am used to from my server.

Character slots are worth more than bank slots but having a bank slot is nice. If you are a hoarder then extra deposit storage is a good choice too. Character bag slots is when you are confident that you will play this character alot.

My guilty pleasure is a good outfit because it can just make leveling a new character less ugly and i don't have to constantly transmutate every new gear. Till i get my ascended done i use outfits just to keep my character in style a lil bit.
---
Welp, our devs got fired. Less content updates from now on. Welcome back players!
---
Enjoy our new sky-high gem store prices.
---
Why waste time on that when they are working on Alliances?
---
You're right we got some meme material here.
---
For the sake of the daily and some extra, I bought around 4g worth of lvl80 rare shields. The first one was in that batch. After feeling lucky I bought  around 30g worth of the lvl 80 rare shields to get the 2nd one. 
---
Zommoros had to be in a very good mood.
---
Reporting a bug here because it's not worth a full reddit post. 
---
It's a very rare shield drop from the Mystic Forge. I got them by throwing in lvl80 rare shields. 
---
Maybe even a little 'quest' with a mentor specific item? I carry around the Tybalt themed accessory purely for RP purposes.
---
I have Asperger's but I joke about it all the time, like calling other people (mainly friends) autistic b/c it's ironic, or saying "Asperger's" like "ass burgers" (although it sounds like that no matter how I say it for some reason)
---
Nobodys AFK that's surprising. 
---
You should host a full event!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the whole point of a tournament was to compete against other people. Would that not make it competitive?
---
Been playing a bunker lately, and my experience is being 1v2 for several minutes on an owned point while my team still somehow manage to lose the other two points and die far away from them.
---
*when doing raids*
---
Or they want to finish those those unfinished gw2 features faster before moving on. From what was posted during lay offs period, gw2 was more or less on life support, being developed by few devs to keep it alive and milking it while anet was roleplaying big developer with multiple projects. That would suggest many things were spread across many months of work which now they could want to speed up.
---
Anyway, unless they announce new expansion, I don't think this game has any future after lw5.
---
Was responding to OP's question:
---
&gt; Also, is there any way of earning Laurels fast?
---
Since the achievement rewards are an alternate way of getting laurels faster than just the time gated login bonus.
---
Also as I said: "really your best bet is actually doing WvW" If this was back in the season 1 days AP wasn't that hard to get but with the small amounts we get now it's kind of hard to keep up a good pace.
---
Hi. I have a 26 warrior.
---
I am running GS/ &amp; A/W.
---
I find the axe has solid burst damage. Why would we want to use the sword instead? I'm newish so I have no idea. I just saw the axe has good burst.
---
Also thought about shield instead of warhorn, but the warhorn lets me accelerate and its much less painful when you're moving quicker haha
---
lol this what actually you do when you could not drive your car in other country. Grow up.
---

For those who don't know who Slaanesh is (cringe) here is a video on the 2D4Chans Green Text about He/Her/It. Yes that is how you pronounce Slaanesh.
---
Alliances keep those guilds together, that's great. But even now guilds have been sticking together for years.
---
What they dont do is glue different guilds, alliances and pugs into working for a common goal. Your group is your alliance, but there are a lot of players outside of any alliance on a server. The same issues persist.
---
Why would I bother training pugs unless they're within my alliance? 2 months later they'll be somewhere else. Why would people play for their server if that server disbands after 2 months? Why would pugs do an effort to work with their guilds and comms if they get new ones every 2 months? What glues players together to actually put in effort when they are losing?
---
Guilds continue to fight and play among eachother in their select circles, while gvg is unsupported and most of them dont have any reason to care for or play with their pugs. And pugs do the exact same, abusing guilds for their enjoyment at the expense of the guild.
---
What does alliances fix? 
---
Yea the hype train at release could have kept going strong IMO but nope. Population on some servers really suck off peak.
---
Warclaw screwed with roaming in general and can confirm, skilllag seems to be more prevalent now from my experience. 
---
I love WvW but eh, there are and were some pretty big problems with it IMO.
---
So many times I've been bunkering 2v4 in close while whole team still managed to not cap even single point 3v1 some mirage or something. Frustrating but not really blaming people tunneling a bit.
---
Wish you could communicate better in matches. Voicechat or better pings (that maybe also appear in chat like "X warns people, Y wants to defend"
---
I think having players joining a guild would be beneficial. We dont know how the system is going to be implemented. Maybe it has some sort of persistence where your alliance only disbands if some drastic change happens. I would like to leave this kind of discussion to when we actually have the implementation.
---
Idk the pings are pretty clear what they mean people just ignore it
---
* Improved population balance (ArenaNet will have a lot more finegrained control of server populations)
---
* Being able to actually lock servers (Linking introduced this problem with servers that are full which can still get people in due to their link being medium population)
---
* Easier to play with your friends.
---
* Pugs will get to experience more playstyles over time and hopefully that can encourage them to join guilds in order to stick with people they like to play with.  
---
Alliances wont fix all of WvWs issues. If population balance starts becoming better, it would be a natural fit to start adding better reward structures that would encourage people to try and win.
---
Now this makes me want to gamble in the Mystic Toilet again. I've had abysmal luck with it. 
---
dude, noone likes Siren's reef
---
How does engineer do in living world story? Created one after the PVP hype thinking I would just PVP on this toon, but finding I rather like it in PVE too. Other than PVP all I do are the living world chapters. 
---
Does anyone know any NA guild that frequently organises Serpent's Ire meta event? It stalls my IG-6417 collection, and it seems that hardly anyone runs it anymore... :( Also, is it bound to anything else than the golem backpack thingie and Exaltation of the Guardians collection?
---
that silence after he fell off the wall in the claw island instance
---
i feel ya
---
or they could rework the chapter and make it replayable
---
Population balance cant exist without coverage balance which will not be added at release. As I described above trying to divide players over servers is irrelevant in current state of gw2. Most pugs play only when their side doesn't need them which is what really creates the imbalance.
---
Locking servers only bandaids an issue they created with links and doesn't prevent stacking. Again player hours are very relevant for coverage (ppt) dominated out of prime, but barely affect population balance at any given time, or strength during prime for example.
---
Pugs will experience the same as with links now. Frequent times of 2 months downtime because their play style doesn't align with guilds. Guilds will face the same as their pugs dont align with them, and 2 months of downtime isn't acceptable for many guilds.
---
As long as ppt is dominated by off-prime ktrain the strongest groups and players wont care about it. Again, not providing a common goal leading to a mentality split between different alliances and pugs on one server.
---
So we work years towards an update that accomplishes very little. Wont fix coverage balance, population balance, provide stable communities, align players, promote healthy interaction between different groups and pugs on a server. All not taken into account for alliances.
---
We know plenty of specifics showing it's not going towards what you claim... you should carefully reread their posts.
---
What's the point of waiting 2 years for an update knowing its mostly a waste of effort due to flawed initial design?
---
🔥🔝😂😂🔝😂😂🔝🔝💯🔥🔥🔥💯😂🔝💯🔝💯💯💯😂🔝🔥🔥🔝😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
Like I say, I'm only looking for the bare minimum to be able to log in and play some pvp while on the road. I don't know enough about laptops but with gw2 being a 6 year old game I think it should be fine. I've seen on board graphics chip benchmarks on YouTube hitting 20-30 frames which would be fine. I have my top end machine back home 
---
Funny editing, and I agree on a lot of parts about the core story. It feels a lot of times that devs didn't get enough time to do it properly.
---
Mr group leader, we are for the big.
---
Sword and Warhorn isn’t used for combat, in this case. You would use this set for mobility with Sword 2 for a short cool down leap, and Warhorn 4 for Swiftness. The Greatsword also helps with its own set of mobility skills. 
---
A /u/Monstrum27 &amp; /u/Portrait_Prophecies [collaboration comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/awv7fz/flat_injustice_iii/), maybe? :P
---
What the duck is this duckery?
---
If you have PoF then power Holo will work very well general PvE.
---
If you're into kits you can play with those, but if you don't like them or just would like to play without them then there is room for that too!
---
Rifle or Sword+[Pistol (for a bit more damage) or Shield (for style and a bit more survival/utility)].
---

---
(Linked builds/guides closer to what you seek and not specifically stuff from SC website).
---
This is something that silver and gold players need to learn to move up, but they don't so they get stuck in the lower divisions.
---
but it'd still be better then having a random episode where we time travel back just to do the same chapter again but good
---
The past season was my first PvP season, and wow this is so spot on.  Although maybe because I'm new to PvP, I don't get the Platinum reference.  High pvp level thrower?  I remember going to mid then mid-fight realizing it was myself and 1 or 2 others.  My own fault for not paying attention to who's behind me when I lead the charge in I guess.  Still learning.
---
Speaking of... I *still* haven't figured out how to re-sheathe my weapons so I can run on all fours when I'm out of combat. I'm certain there's a button for it somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.
---
I think TTS is NA and runs the meta every week, see [their calendar](https://ttsgamers.com/event-calendar/)
---
I am currently stuck on a story step with my necro, the final boss fight of HoT. Haven't been successful in finding somebody to help yet. I can't imagine any class being as easy as my minionmancer, but something close to it would be nice. I am often playing when other people aren't, so having a very self-sufficient class is important to me.  
---
uoooh i really want pof , just started playing for 2 weeks and been enjoying HoT  
---
too bad i have no form of payment available on myself, no cc / paysafecard  
---
ah well, just hope there will be more influx of people coming to do more hot meta on off hour lol
---
Wow... until now I didn't know I could have AIDS while I already had cancer and syphilis
---
Oh of course not. https://gfycat.com/formalabsolutejuliabutterfly-politics
---
What are you looking to do? Are you looking for another support build? Do you want a DPS build? Do you want to stay on your ranger?
---
Pretty much every class has a couple viable builds for PvE, but it's hard to make recommendations without knowing more about what you're interested in.
---
While your intentions are good, this isn't the thread for it. This thread's mainly players asking other players for answers to their questions, not so much bringing things to the attention of the game developers. Your best bet is to submit a ticket or wait for when the upcoming patch goes live for the Patch Bug Thread which gets stickied.
---
I love this. Platinum guy should blame his team in the last panel though. Very accurate overall.
---
Do you have any issues with Freestyle not saving your settings? I've started using filters after seeing this thread, but it seems every reboot wipes all my preferences.
---
For story and open world Zerk will also work way better because mobs usually have low armor/health there so you are not affected by condi ramp up.
---
Kitless Holo is definitively fun and the Shield bring a bit more safety. For the rune if you don't wanna go for Scholar because it's expensive (and you're not into raid/fractals) then I think you could go for Strength, Flame legion (if you are sure the enemy is gonna have Burning very often) or idk what the other "cheap" runes are currently.
---
What is SB ? SoulBeast ? SpellBreaker ? ShortBow ? It helps if you add another letter to differentiate, for example: Soulbeast= Slb, Spellbreaker=Spb. What gamemode are you asking about? Condi/power ?
---
 Anyways from the build it sounds like its pSlb, go weapons-&gt;trinkets-&gt;armor as someone else already said.
---
And it was inferior to direct damage in zergs for at least a year anyway.
---
Oh no my bad, it's a soubeast
---
This is how i flip my rare shields too :).
---
Reaper is very good for soloing content and is very self sufficient too, but then again this very last instance is not be that easy solo anyway so do try LFG if you play in a peak time.
---
Do you remember which part gives you the most trouble? And if you are in EU I could always give you a hand for this story bit and to handle a Reaper a bit better.
---
Unfortunately I am on a US server. I am running reaper and it's been going well for the most part so far. Did struggle a bit on the parts with the snipers and sniper trails going all over the place. I can't remember the name of the story step I'm stuck on now, but it's when you have to go into the dream to fight the dragon. 
---
Really bad idea. It would strip the festivals of their entire reason being there for a quick profit but a permanent nerf to half of a year's updates.
---
A SAB Lounge Pass tho...
---
We should make a weekly keyfarm shenanigans thread.
---
Hmm, shouldn't it be the other way around? Runescape had their map up before GW franchise
---
For someone that never really played pvp in gw2 this is more than confusing.
---
People sneak into places because ppt is dominated by capping undefended objectives rather than competing for objectives as is the result of continuous buffs to the defenders advantage, including this mount.
---
Whether they glitch, backcap or wait for the middle of the night makes little difference to me.
---
Tournaments are [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_\(sport\)). 
---
As long as you got qualifying points, you can go in. 
---
Nice, dude. I like your theories.
---
For me every year a new update with some "support" is better than the same soup over and over.
---
Thanks
---
Returning Player can't decide between Thief/Deadeye or Ranger/Soulbeast-  
---
Hey guys, I last played GW2 in 2012 when it came out and got a thief to level 55. Decided to come back and check it out (right on time for the sale!) but I can't decide which class I want to play.
---
I'm starting over from scratch just to get the hang of things. The Thief interests me more than the Ranger but I keep reading that they are currently underperforming.(?)
---
In all the MMOs I've ever played I'm always either a Ranger-type with a bow, or an Assassin-type with daggers and stealth.
---
Any insight appreciated :)
---
Because _fashion_
---
Is that promotion for free Daybreak episode let me claim it to play it forever or I need to finish it before 1 April? Just started LW 2, still long way for me to get to 4 :(
---
Oh dip. Did you just do the hunter yourself, or did you find a guide? I really want to get mine up there.
---
It took me an hour to find it when I heard about it, very fun place
---
The remaining enemy players had better rotations then. 
---
It's the off season though, most of the players don't really care that much. 
---
I completely agree, but I'm not sure if it would work well in a videogame
---
Once an episode is claimed it is unlocked for your account forever so you can play it whenever you want.
---
Gonna craft me 10 legendaries at once. Currently on 80% of my 3rd world completion.
---
Thanks so much! (Could not for the life of me remember which form of Griffon is used in gw2 so I went with flap flap instead X'D)
---
Since it's gonna end soon and I doubt customer support will reply in time: can someone please tell me if I can buy codes like this and save them for my GF's cake day?
---
Hey dumb question. If I haven't finished episode 5 when 6 comes out will I not have access to the rest of the episode? 🤔
---
You also don't need to wait 30 seconds to be useful to your team. Usefulness is overrated anyway.
---
All "moral codes" are pragmatic in their essence. 
---
Thiefs are strong in both pvp and pve content. At pve they are strong single target dps and for pvp a roaming machine.
---
Pvp wise theres a misconception for thief that they are an Assassin but no they are not. They are thiefs they fight unfair and run if needs be. They can be strong gankers tho.
---
Pve wise they are squishy which makes mistakes more costly but it has one of the easiest rotations in the game.
---
Both elite specs are used for end game aswell.
---
Rangers are pvp wise not in a great position except for roaming in WvW. 
---
Pve they are the go to healer via Druid spec and a solid dps class via Soulbeast.
---
to be honest i think you'r being a smartass but whatever :shrug:
---
Are you sure there is a Warclaw balance patch? They said short-term was weeks out. 
---
No.  
---
He himself asks if evading is a skill in his stream. Dodges are skills. I'm only responding to that since I wasn't there when he asked. 
---
The thing about GW2 engine is that everything characters do is basically a skill.  
---
That's the point. It's impossible do anything without skills since anything a character does is a skill, movement (WADS) probably being the only exception. 
---
I would not be surprised if even crafting was actually done through some form of skill, even the mail carriers that appear when you send or receive messages are probably triggered with a skill. 
---
Nope, still trying too hard. Troll somewhere else.
---
&gt;'nobody likes to grind'
---
This is to appeal to people that don't play people because of the grind MMOs are known to have. They took the risk that it wouldn't turn away people that do enjoy a grind.
---
&gt;Also, how do you want to make yourself a legendary weapon if you don't grind?
---
I've made 100,000 gold without ever playing the TP or doing anything that seemed like a "grind", but I definitely would have reached my goals faster if I did grind.
---
I am not a mirror, do not posts messages to me when speaking to yourself.
---
The cannon has skills, but jumps and dodges are not skills unless you trait into making them activate a skill.
---
However, every finisher is a different skill.
---
Position rewinder is needed in there and maybe xera portal
---
Finally investing in my bank guild to get all of the WvW upgrades so I can help claim things. This is going to take awhile LOL
---
FB is strong if you have no boon removal.
---
Once you do it goes down like a rock.
---
Hence why I suggest standardizing some buffs and spreading boon removal around a bit more.
---
That way more comps cant deal with it and more comps can fill the meta for raids/fractals.
---
:'( a man can only hope
---
if you have excess tier 6 gemstones, it's cheaper to just craft the amalgs. roll the 25 25 25 for 10 recipe and you come out even, if not slightly ahead. Also I like to MF my excess t5 ones as they have pretty high chance of turning out t6, and fill out the rest so I can dump 25 stacks into the MF.
---
Just don't use the freshwater pearls, silver doubloons, maguuma lilies, or platinum doubloons. the rest of the t6 gems I tend to toss into the forge for amalgs. If you have the glyph of bounty (extra chance of dropping stuff) you can coral farm in sandswept isles and bitterfrost frontier
---
Haha...
---
Yup boss bought one last year.
---
Cost about 100 grand, but damn does it make creating anything with metal a heck of allot easier &amp; faster.
---
Most modern laptops should be able to handle GW2. The graphics won't exactly be ultra HD, not to mention the FPS, but it'll definitely be playable.
---
My old laptop from 2011 (about €600 back then) managed the game just fine, although it rarely went above 30 FPS.
---
Hell, good laptops in general don't exist in that range.
---
is skill lag in wvw caused by hardware or internet connection? 
---
I mean, I agree with you but there's plenty of other areas that are only accessible in story quests that in my opinion are far more interesting locations. 
---
Honestly it blows my mind the level of detail in some of the maps that are only used once or twice.
---
I am sorry to put it like this, but I am starting to feel as if you are trying to get me to allow you something which I cannot allow any player to do. 
---
The rules are, I have to repeat, clear. You must be playing actively. If you are unable to do so on several accounts, then you cannot play several accounts. If you are able to do so, then go ahead. I cannot provide 'wiggle room' to let folks find loopholes or exceptions to this. 
---
I am all up to little events like Pirate Day in a lot of games or even the little Valentine's Day events. Still, SAB is something so different that it must be exclusive to remain fresh and desirable.
---
Remember old LA? People want it back even as a Lounge Pass just because it's absent, but it was not so great to have it always. The LA outpost during the Scarlet War was the same and some people just like the feeling of something that was temporary but different.
---
SAB even more is something that makes you play an entire different game yet you keep it in your personal daily schedule of GW2 gameplay. Having the access all the year would make the content bland and stale very, very quick. Even 3 weeks of it is seen as an exaggeration by many.
---
Unlimited access to festival areas would make them bland and much less fresh. I don't even care that much about SAB since I've played every release of it, but the little addition and new dailies will keep it enjoyable as long as it's a little distraction between proper releases.
---
You *could*, but if you've already bought another character slot and are leveling another character anyway, why not just make another guardian so that you don't have to fiddle with carrying around a whole bag full of gear and swapping specs all the time?
---
Also, it's a great excuse to dress up a brand new character for Fashion Wars.
---
That's good to know. I've always felt intimidated by figuring out gear for the later fractals. 
---
They're still moral.  Otherwise, that's just edgelord-speak for an excuse to behave immorally.  
---
There are no environmental conditions that cause cheating in GW2 to jeopardize your survival.
---
Is it amount of people who farmed APs/Masteries per episode?
---
this is fucking me up 
---
This is beautiful. Shows exactly when people lost interest: end of season 3 and start of Path of Fire, to never really recover after. HoT and season 3 were my favourite content this game has done. PoF and season 3 probably my least favourite. If this keeps up, I won't have enough interest to even login wehn new patch will hit.
---
so more people have finished migraine then completed the metachievo for anything since pof except for pof act 2 and daybreak
---
that's a good sign
---
Elementalist summons have both long durations and long recharges, so they are not something one carriers to keep up at all times like necromancer minions, but something to help you and take fire off your back when outnumbered. 
---
Conjures are not bad, but they also have long recharges. If they were something more like engineer kits they may be more fun to use, but at they are they are mostly something one uses to get a dps or CC boost and take down a boss faster. 
---
My friends and I are in the same boat as well. We enjoyed doing achievements in season 3, but the season 4 achievements just aren't as enticing. However my friends and I are distracted by games that are not guild wars 2 during the entirety of season 4. I suppose there were less distractions from guild wars 2 during season 3 on the console front.
---
The most powerfull ele builds always used 2 conjures. Fiery Greatsword and Frostbow/Lightning Hammer.
---
Excuse you, magnetic shield is great for the pressure plates in fresh fractal 😤

I wish there were a way for SAB fan to tell the dev we really want world 3 and would gladly pay for it, instead of yelling futilely on reddit and forums like this
---
SAB also ends on the 18th of April :P

Festivals are no longer tied to updates. Maps can be dynamically altered on the fly without even having to reload the map. 
---
So while a update may mean more content for a festival, it doesn't mean the festival will start at the same time as the update.

I'm not sure if this set will work for a human as well, but my asura has been mummy-themed for ages. That's Carapace Chest (really looks like wrapped bandages if you dye it right), Wrappings and Walkers of the Lich (Arah hands and boots), and Dry Bones Leggings, with Hypnotic Scepter and Moonshank for weapons. (He was created long before PoF and all those nice desert-themed weapons sets came out, and I still like his original weapons enough to keep them.)
---
Unfortunately, the shoulder piece is the Genius Epaulets, which is asura cultural, but I'm sure your friend could find something that works better for whatever their race is.
---
I kept the Skull Masque because I think it looks adorable on asura, but for a true mummy look I'm sure there are better options.
---
I did that every episode up until this season. Now i can not be arsed to do it because making something that might take hours and get 1 ap it simply is not worth my time. And i am pretty high on ap and don't mind working for them but 1 ap just sucks and made ap hunting boring and by the look of it many more feel the same. 
---
I think Noxxians video describe exactly how we feel about it and it is still valid like a year later.

Keep in mind, fractal groups are VERY composition dependent compared to raids. If you don’t have classes pumping out quickness, alacrity and 25 might then stuff like elementalist is borderline useless in fractals. If you’re pugging, I would recommend builds that are more self sufficient in boons because you can’t rely on your team as much. Power firebrand is a favorite of mine in that regard. Pretty much the same as Dragonhunter, but you just use firebrand for lots of quickness uptime.

&gt;- Fixed a bug that could cause two copies of a Cage boss to appear.
---
&gt;- Reduced the number of pointing hands in some sections of Infantile Mode.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that could cause the Infantile Mode achievements to stop progressing in rare cases.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that prevented some text boxes from properly displaying.
---
&gt;## World Polish
---
&gt;Across _Guild Wars 2_, gear has been through countless changes and iterations. Generally we&amp;#39;ve sought to improve the player experience and smoothness of bag management so that more active gameplay can take center stage. With the _Path of Fire_™ expansion, several rarities of unidentified gear were added to the game to replace the reward supply of uncommon, masterwork, and rare drops. Today&amp;#39;s release rolls out the unidentified gear reward system to the rest of Tyria.
---
&gt;There are three major goals that we hope to achieve with these changes. First, we want to separate regional drops more clearly, so players get jungle loot in the jungle, desert loot in the desert, and so on. Secondly, we want to make unidentified gear worth equal value to all players, and not worth more to players with higher magic-find potential. And last, but definitely not least, we hope to improve the play experience by reducing the number of times players need to stop and deal with full bags!
---
&gt;- Updated level-80 rewards in most areas of the game to drop unidentified gear instead of common, masterwork, or rare items. Some items that are only available in certain areas or tied to specific content will still drop directly.
---
&gt;- Removed the chance to acquire Eyes of Kormir, Congealed Putrescence, and Pulsing Brandsparks when salvaging unidentified gear. These will now drop occasionally as loot from creatures in the Crystal Desert instead.
---
&gt;- Magic find no longer affects the identification of unidentified gear.
---
&gt;- Significantly reduced the chances of acquiring rare Sunspear weapons from pieces of rare unidentified gear.

---
&gt;- The right-click menu for legendary equipment will now include the Select Stats option while the item is equipped.

---
I'd suspect that this sample is biased a bit towards more veteran players.  But it's probably a decent cross-section of the type of people who'd bother completing mastery achievements.
---
yeah, I stopped bothering  after pof story. I found masterys in HOT interesting even though most arnt good. POF is all eggs in one basket (mounts) which i find more boring
---
Fantastic thank you, been waiting on that Grand Lion!
---
Wonder what the dye colors look like
---
Alfred Hitchcock would probably be the only GW2 player upset by this update.
---
Could we just have the old Sneak Gyro back? It was awesome and allowed for lots of interesting counter play. The new one is now just mass invisibility for engineers.
---
&gt;firmed it unlock tomorrow.
---
Not to mention you will have 6 years worth of [Birthday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift) spread across however many characters you have. Each character will have an [Experience Scroll (level 60)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience_Scroll_(level_60)).
---
Congrats, now Sneak Gyro - an elite skill - is barely better than Toss Elixir S (and without the invincibility).
---
"Witch Hunter Dendeta, flies through the wall"
---
I heared there was heresy here, so i came as fast as i could!!
---
We are the QA, so its working :p
---
&gt;Magic find no longer affects the identification of unidentified gear.
---
I have both old and newly acquired unidentified gear that says, "Identification gains bonuses from account magic find."
---
&gt; To allow adventurers to earn the Crimson Assassin Backpack Cover faster, it is now sold by the Super Adventure Box Trader. The achievement that rewarded it, The Crimson Assassin, will now reward an ascended-quality version of the Super Assassin Backpack.
---
[I called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b46vw4/super_adventure_festival_returns_next_week/ej56yvc/?context=1)
---
&gt; New adventures have been added to each zone! Look for adventure flags and their racing attendants to embark on a timed coin hunt.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Two new achievements have been added to unlock new tool upgrades. Seek out hidden secrets and trade items with the denizens of the Super Adventure Box to earn your way up to the powerful mega bomb and stunning boomerang! 
---
SAB got new content?!?!? O.o !!!!!!!!!!! SAB NEW CONTENT HYPE!!!!
---
&gt;Birds and Slippery Slope have been removed from the list of possible mistlock instabilities. Slippery Slope is still available on the Fractal Console guild decoration.
---
Good riddance.
---
Yeah it’s extremely cheesy. 
---
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!
---
Couldnt they make that backpack as a shield skin? I would love it as it reminds my GW1 exalted egidy skin..
---
thats it for sab...
---
&gt; Fixed a bug that caused the Super Adventure Box rewards vendors to sometimes swap positions.
---
What was the reason for this? I remember some dev explained it with technical details but I can't find it. It was interesting.
---
Unnoted change: Warclaw cannot gain stealth anymore (at least in WvW)
---
I found slippery slope super funny, this is sad
---
There are no brokers in this train.
---
Endless wealth was destroyed anyway.
---
But th3 game and by extension the world revolves around me, the (PVE) commander of tyria
---
&gt; Secondly, we want to make unidentified gear worth equal value to all players, and not worth more to players with higher magic-find potential.
---
I would be salty if I had spent time on maximizing magic find. How dare veterans get something nice.
---
No fix for stealth mounts?  I hope it's just unlisted and they still implemented the fix.  
---
To the bottom with you!
---
It's miniature golems with top hats.
---
I know I want one, and so do you.
---
Great news, I was okay with SS for the most part but Birds was genuinely horrible. I think simply fixing it, instead outright removal is fine, but I'm not gonna complain. 
---
Think WBF got nerfed too hard though. 3 seconds feels a little short, and I think most people are going to ignore reflects and just facetank it now.
---
There are already glass weapons in the game. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiant_Glass_Shield_Skin
---
What were you expecting? Scrapper nerfed from god-tier in PvP/WvW, Birds/Slippery Slope removed, and We bleed Fire made decent. These are all solid. Why do people think we need class reworks every fucking patch?
---
Shame they got rid of birds, that instab made some encounters way easier
---
GG Anet, finally!
---
Honestly my fiancees Lenovo legion is quite good and can run at max settings outside wvw. 
---
I have a salary of 1300 Euros.
---
The worse part is when you're literally 450-400, and instead of holding points, your team keeps roaming like crazy.
---
JUST HOLD CLOSE, THE MATCH IS OVER.
---
Oh no, someone on the enemy team had a brain, and decapped close. Now we lost 480-500.
---
Great job guys. Great fucking job.
---
They clearly said it was the 28th
---
IIRC, they shared the same spawn points, but would only spawn once and only one NPC could spawn at that spot, so every instance of the map had their spawn order randomized, thus they swapped around randomly every IP.
---
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU AGAIN
---
And there can't be both? If you think that, you are wrong. 
---
Even the same person can be very moral and fair in one part of his life, for example at soccer or whatever his hobby is, but also can be a total abusive jerk in another part of his life, for example at his work. 
---
If you think a person is either 100% moral or 100% abusive, than you are just wrong. Humans are way more complex than that. 
---
I don't know what you are talikng about in this comment. But the Order of the Silverhammer suspect one of you is a heretical Slaanesh cultist, but i do not know whom it is. So we made the Desition to burn you all in this comment+ replies at the stakes in LA plaza.
---
Finally fractals can be more enjoyable now :) Thanks!
---
It's unlisted, but they forgot to make it also immune to the unique mesmer stealth "Hide in Shadows", so people can still do mount stealth shenanigans with Veil and Mass  Invisibility.
---
I'm psyched. I just have one Crimson Assassin token that I honestly have no idea where I got from because every SAB it's felt like there was so much that was impossible to get.
---
What’s this in reference to?
---
If you mean the reward track bug, that got fixed within a week. You need to buy the helm from the Warclaw Tender vender.
---
Isn't mordrem loop the reward for migraine (act 4)?  At the time, stat selection was rarer for the new HoT stats, so this doesn't surprise me.
---
But RIBA still exists...
---
After crafting Frostfang it dropped me down to 1 gold and some change.  So close.  
---
Both forms of stealth don't work now 
---
There was a thread awhile back measuring rarity drops that basically showed magic find is only one-tenth as effective it should be, so you should be fuming if you already were maximizing it.
---
That is, +800% magic find actually only gives +80% chance of higher rarity drops.
---
It's something that breaks up the game from it's usual pace and also calls to nostalgia of 8bit jump&amp;&amp;runs. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Noooooo! Not Slippery Slope ;(
---
&gt; Significantly reduced the chances of acquiring rare Sunspear weapons from pieces of rare unidentified gear.
---
I'm not sure if this should bother me or not.
---
I was on a core elementalist and he was on something with pvp wings. Lol.  
---
He was all over the map so keeping home capped probably wasn't the issue.  Good benefit of the doubt though.
---
Offers: Retro weapon skins in various colors, old school gaming aesthetic.
---
Lore: An asura whose name references Shigeru Miyamoto made a virtual world.
---
Why: For fun.
---
End Goal: Upgrade yourself and get prizes, just like everywhere else in the game.
---
Is it worth it: I don't believe there's any sort of farm associated with it like the other festivals. That said, some of the food available through here seems very good/unique stat combos.
---
i love this quote, Jeff didn't work on SAB for 4 years, hell he didn't even work on GW2 for atleast last 2 years but his layoff is the reason why there won't be new content for SAB
---
I can confirm, jump is still possible.
---
easily doable in one festival
---
I like the S4 rewards but having to complete all 38 achievements for the metas is ridiculous. You get so burnt out.
---
The LS achievement system is deeply flawed - starting from *terrible* ease of access, mediocre objective clarity, subpar intermediary rewards, and ending with the achievements themselves. I don't remember intending to do a *single* achievement because it was fun, and not because I needed that for some other carrot on the larger stick.
---
If I need the reward nowadays, I'll just go for the PvP reward track instead, since that somehow brings *less* frustration to my game session.
---
Thank you Anet &lt;3 I love these changes.
---
Good.
---
Ok that makes sense. Thought I missing something. “I kept thinking there has to be more right?!”
---
The problem with data like this is that it is point-in-time snapshot only.  I’d be more interested to see the deltas in each category to measure an actual pulse of what players are doing.
---
Really bad change, what's this thing even good for now, it wasn't really used in fights before and now it's just another thing randoms can use to fuck up stealth tactica.
---
I CAN PLAY MY FAVORITE MODE AGAIN YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
I appreciate the brevity. I think I understand a bit better now. I kept thinking to myself, “I got to be missing something or there’s got to be more right?!” Thank for the response.
---
Great! I'll grab the tradesman package and throw the consumables to the pile in the bank.
---
It's a fun activity you can throw yourself into and explore this beautiful world-nostalgia.  
---
It also has very cool skins to obtain from rewards.
---
It's an old school platformer style dungeon that started as an April Fool's joke in 2013 and became a permanent festival afterwards. No gold farms or anything like that. Comes with a "tribulation mode" for those who like brutal and unfair challenges. It's quite fun if the platformer genre is your kind of thing. 
---
thx
---
That’s sounds kinda easy, I will try to do it this way, thanks for your tips guys! I have cleared the cm’s by now and but it’s really hard to find groups with 1 kp :) I opened Training runs and try to manage it through. Kinda worked more or less successfully tho. I won’t give up 
---
Wait so, does unidentified gear still have a chance to improve rarity (rare to exotic) when you open it? Can't tell if the change means it's a static value or if they just did away with it
---
Crimson weapons easier to get this year?
---
I am upset about this update. Aside from npc bird spawn this was a pretty good insability. But no, a-net is going to cave in to whiners again. 
---
SS can go back to SAB tho.
---
Why didnt they say they are removing slippery slope? I would’ve done fractal just for one last time of fun.... heard it was on 109cm yesterday too :(  
---
so much for “communication” i guess....... did they not realise there’s actually ppl that enjoy slippery slope and since we enjoy it there was no need to shout bloody murder everytime? I’m just ranting at this point, just it irritates me to no end that they mentioned majority of the changes YET NOT THIS ONE
---
Removed birds. I can die in peace now.
---
I really appreciate the offer, unfortunately NA here.😄
---
Faster map-movement, which has been a huge complaint of a lot of players for a very very long time.  It doesn't have to be an earth-shattering mechanic to be helpful. 
---
Stealthing mounts was allowing for insanely degenerate gameplay where you could gyro or blast smoke literally outside of render range for most players and run on top of them and engage. Plus it had a slew of visual bugs/glitches with dismount interaction that made trying to read a zerg impossible
---
Tbh the direct damage part of we bleed fire always was the main reason why ppl downed. Burn always can be removed relatively quickly, so I don't see a problem in that, there is still a reason to dodge which I appreciate
---
WHAT  
---
I thought my guild was joking when they posted it on discord!
---
Best backpack ever, I took a piece of a broken window and carrying it with me everywhere!
---
It's structured completely differently than the other festivals because it wasn't originally a festival. There are hours of content available, but it probably will appeal more to fans of platforming, jumping puzzles, and especially retro games (80s). Most of the upgrades you get are only useful inside the Box itself. There are secrets in every level: hidden skill upgrades, caves you can bomb open, branching pathways, hidden shops with weapon upgrades, and tons of nods to old video game tropes.
---
Rewards you can earn for outside the Box include the 5 holographic weapon sets (blue, orange, green, yellow, red), 2 pixel-effect infusions, 1 cat for your home instance, and a few minis.
---
Bottom line: play it if you love exploring retro platformer games.
---
Same. It was at least fun with friends.
---
But I enjoyed both
---
I liked those stealth attacks, you actually needed quick reactions and skill, back to the pirate ship I guess.
---

---
Draconis Mons JP [still gives guaranteed rare](https://i.imgur.com/ZB3Dh97.png) :D
---
I guess it depends on how the difficulty is achieved. I love challenging games (every soulsbourne game, currently playing through Sekiro right now, I wouldn’t call them difficult/hard but instead challenging the difference being more pattern recognition than artificial difficulty spikes.) I’ll give the tribulation a shot though when I get time between work (full time) and college. I’ve been finding it harder to make time for GW2 with everything going on in my life right now, so this post was made to help see if it was “worth my time”. Trying to say that in the most respectful way possible.
---
I appreciate the help.
---
I convinced my husband last week to start playing again.  (I came back after a couple year break a few weeks ago, but he's been gone much longer.)  I told him to make sure he logged in and got the living world episode and he's all, "The what?"  So yeah, you're right on that part at least.
---
I think this campaign, more than bringing back people, might help people like me who have come back to stick around.  I continue to struggle with understanding what I'm supposed to be doing outside of the story things, exploring the world, etc.  I unlocked Istan because people said to do it to make money and I'm a bit poor, but then got there and was still pretty clueless.  (I haven't finished LWS3 or PoF yet, just recently finished HoT, so I don't have a lot of context.)
---
I wonder how many more patches are needed until Anet realizes the concept of global instabilities is bad design and they should focus on developing boss/fractal unique instabilities instead.
---
Probably never, cause it requires more work.
---
Definitely not since I was a kid and that was a while ago.
---
Yeah I agree. Birds could have been tuned to just a hovering effect like a gyro and didn't count as an enemy unit. Also I don't think the special effect was working where the bird would attack enemies when you got rid of it. 
---
yeeey another fully covered body outfit with some random shit on one side,never seen that before.
---
birds were fine if it was a single blind that cleansed on dodge, rather than pulsing blinds. Although to be fair, birds always seemed to spawn whenever I overloaded
---
Thank you for the breakdown. Definitely helped make a good decision to see if it was “worth my time”. I say that only because between full time job, college, wife, and life I’ve been finding it harder and harder to play GW2 over that last few weeks. So I’ve been having to basically decide what needs/deserves my attention day to day, week to week.
---
Mounts ruined open world IMO. Everything is so spread out now, and any little platforming/navigation puzzle becomes about wallhugging with the Springer.
---
Birds were good, they taught you save your endurance instead of pressing dodge when you are just too lazy to walk. The only bad part about birds were the actual bird np that spawned. They should have been removed, maybe even made frienly and forced to attack enemies. Instead they listened to our great community and just cut them. Like hell these people are actually going to play fractals more now, at best the will be bored instead of annoyed.
---
SS was kinda fun, but got old very fast and  didn't fit in fractals at all. SA is left intact for some reason.
---
Mounts was a success, financially. Designwise PoF was a failure.
---
I would rarely say people are wrong when they have opinions, but that's fucked up dude, whats to like about getting blown up by 60 players in complete stealth, there's absolutely zero counterplay other than equally degenerate preparation (e.g. putting down stealth traps every 500 units your group moves across the map)
---
Artificial time gates are not content, something that anet still can't get, even though people explained that to them at HoT release.
---
what is that last item?
---
"Magic find no longer affects the identification of unidentified gear" and unidentified gear drop instead of the usual items. Silly question maybe, but what does MF have an influence on now ?
---
Thank god 
---
MF was a terrible idea and crippled the game for long. When it launched, MF was a gear stat. It couldn't go very high (we had like omnomberry food, basic 50% booster, and not more than that even from full MF gear), but problem was conflict between using real gear stats or using MF ... aaaand conflict between players using MF and other players especially in dungeons.
---
So they had to do something. Of course, removing MF from the game was not possible, too late. They removed from gear and created account MF, which many veteran or very active players maxed asap ... Also along the way, be it for reward reasons, gemstore, or gameplay (sw buffs to try and keep players in an instance instead of jumping), or provide access to MF to ppl who didn't have full account MF yet ... In the end, many players run around with hundreds of MF all the time, and if we look at mf-rdy containers (like unid gear), ability to reach insane MF numbers.
---
All this wasn't part of the game when loot systems were designed (reachable MF numbers were low). In the long run it made the economy unbalanceable, many items and item rarities became too easy to get because of the high avg MF among playerbase. Also impossible to make any rng-loot-reliant system feel rewarding for everyone (incl. low-mf people) with chances at nice stuff while not having top-mf players get more than intended and making the nice stuff worthless.
---
I'm pretty sure that the new change is, for anet, an occasion to try to regain better control over the whole reward system and economy, game-wide, all while providing QoL. Unified unidentified gear means : inventories slower to fill, easier to manage our loot from time to time, no burden of having to manage unid gear in a way to not lose value (aka don't let it go into auto salvage, sell, or keep for weeks+ until you do sw max-mf session by yourself...), but also easier game-wide balance of loot (so they can try to get the difference of rewards between areas lower), easier balance of economy (including base mats ... if they want to make silk rarer for example they just have to change ONE loot table and give lower % of light armor and boom, silk value increases).
---
I do have max MF (incl. from top AP), I maxed it very long ago and it cost me a lot more than ppl who maxed it in the past years (no high MF output from festival containers, only salvage as a source, all salvages were net loss of money ... and no auto-salvage : I manually salvaged many tens of thousands of greens !). So I am by far not unaffected by the change and could easily be part of the people who dislike the change for the very reasons that you and Zosin point out. But I understand why they do it. And I support it. I hope that moving forward, they can make this system as universal as possible and that it helps them maintain a healthy economy.
---
The difficulty in Tribulation Mode, much like I Wanna Be The Guy, is very much unfair.  Oh, you walked on that patch of grass?  Have some instant death spikes.  Did you step on this side of the platform?  It actually doesn't exist, now you're falling into lava.  And so on.  The game will do its best to kill you in unexpected ways and you need to learn the one or two proper paths to get through intact.  There'll be some hard platforming challenges along the way, but most of it is trial and error to find out where you can step and where you can't.
---
But that's just Tribulation Mode.  The normal Super Adventure Box isn't nearly as punishing.  World 2 was rough when it was first released, but has had its difficulty greatly reduced in the reappearances since then.  And there's lots of easter eggs to find along the way, too, from the Zelda jingle when you find a hidden room with a bomb to the Super Mario-esque underground GW2 theme rendition, to the Street Fighter 2-style vehicle destruction bonus stage.

&gt; name calling 
---
This statement quite obviously implies a personal attack.
---
Perhaps it's you that should re-read the thread.
---
I'll have to look it up from home, I'm at work currently. Dulfy had a gallery listed for a short while, wonder why it was taken down
---
Thanks! Fun so far, love the combat. Action camera mode makes it feel just like Tera! Glad I stumbled on that little gem.
---
They’ve added an ascended back piece in its place! :)
---
I guess we shouldn't have balance patches because dodges and stability exist! /s 
---
t's the same banal logic as: That "X" OP class/ability isn't really OP if you learn to just CC them!
---
So is that your argument for every broken "feature" in the game?  
---
There are two really cool infusions you can get called Moto's Unstable Bauble Infusion: Red and Moto's Unstable Bauble Infusion: Blue. 
---
Little 8-Bit bubbles float around your character.  It's really cool but difficult to get.  I got it a few years ago and it's been on my engi ever since.  I'd do it again if I could.  
---
I think TTS does this meta successfully every friday night or something. : P
---
yeah thank you anet for introducing obviously bad instabs and then removing them again after ppl complained for weeks
---
I really hope they will add a way to enable slippery in fractals again. Not as an instability, more like low gravity in the lobby for example.  
---
Though I can fully understand why people didn't enjoy it as much as I did, I'd love to have the option to play with it when I feel like it.
---
Am I correct in thinking that the only value of buying these for my second account would be accessing the expansion areas and their respective dailies? I'm only really using it for login rewards at the moment. If anyone has any experience with this decision let me know!
---
Bye
---
i thought it was only me who thought you were supposed to be able to bird the enemies, guess my reading abilities isn't as bad as a i thought and the instab just didn't work as intended
---
Just dodge the damage animations from stealth 4Head! 
---
You've demonstrated you don't know anything about wvw in two posts lmao
---
Oops I multiple tabs of the same post open and edited the wrong tab, will reupload it. 
---
&gt; Mounts was a success, financially.
---
I wouldn't be so sure. Short term? Yes. Long term? Let's see about that. The gem store has a tendency to burn away monetization potential pretty easily. Gliders, finishers, mail carriers, infinite gathering tools, miniatures...
---
Kinda feels like my years of magic find grinding are useless now tbh. 
---
If by "roaming" you mean "an asshole thief ganking low level players out of stealth, only he decides when to disengage" then _good_. At least some counterplay. Want to fight someone who doesn't want to fight you cause their build is simply not going to survive against hit-stealth-hit-stealth gameplay? Sorry, go do PvP or something.
---
no,keep in mind that this game is 10x harder than darks souls,90% of combat is parry. all your attacks will do like 2% dmg for half of the game. if you dont mind that and dying every 5 mins,than i whoud recomend it.

"Fun game content"
---
God forbid we have actual handcrafted challenges instead of randomly generated mechanics that don't even change how you deal with the fractal.
---
You know how games like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls get praised for good gameplay? Because it's every encounter has mechanics that are all designed with thought and intention, not a lazy and sloppy global paintbrush of mechanics that just force you to burn dodges or have no counter play.
---
Nightmare and Shattered Observatory are fun game content even without stupid nonsensical instabilities, because the challenge and fun is in the well telegraphed mechanics. Environments that are entirely up to the player skill, environments that are stable and conducive so feel good getting better than content, not having different crap every day.
---
No worries! Thank you!
---
&gt; I wouldn't be so sure. Short term? Yes. Long term? Let's see about that.
---
Considering anet's content design, I believe short-term is what anet wants.
---
&gt;  the concept of global instabilities is bad design
---
HoT also has a much higher amount of mastery points needed to unlock everything than PoF does. I'm not super hardcore about achievements, but unlocking all the mastery skills was important to me, so I went for easy ones. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that mindset isn't super uncommon?
---
And what's the rest of the message? Cutting things out of context is called manipulation :)
---
Can confirm. It also respawns *fast* for a map meta. 
---
God forbid anything in this game have any challenge.
---
"Waaaaah, I couldn't get carried through CMs because of slippery slope! Bad game design, bad game design!"

I’m surprised they fully removed birds instead of just reworking, but I’m anyways grateful
---
you can get some of the weapon skins from the end chests and sell them on the TP.

Oh, whoops. Somehow I read it as warrior, since that was an issue as well :')

So I can make everything bad just by calling it annoying?  Great.  
---
Yup, and with only 21 days of the festival per year, it’s 37 coins per year, or 45 coins per year depending on your status of Course Load at the beginning of the festival.  
---
And you need 200 to complete the collection.
---
I hope this year part of that weekly purchase is buying crimson tokens...
---
roughly 10 per zealot for cc.. cleared it plenty of times with those numbers, so it isn't anything on the dev side, it's player error.   
---
If you're having that much trouble with it, try with a group that is experienced with the event, rather than a 'raid guild' with extra players.
---
Gw2 players: open world is so easy, you can basically do every group event by spamming 1.
---
Also gw2 players: event X is so hard, you cant even complete it by using all skills you have. 
---
If only Anet would make harder events more profitable instead of having the biggest gold farm in game be running around map and tagging mobs and events... 
---
Same here.  Even as a primarily WvW player, I still login on patch days to see what's changed.  On content days, I've always logged in so that I could at least have something to do.  Even if its been the same cookie cutter releases, I still did them because it was new.  It was content in one of my favorite games of all time.  Now I finish the story and wander the map for 30 minutes at most and logout.  If they keep doing this release schedule, I won't even bother.  More of the same will completely ruin any interest I have left.  I'm hoping with all the layoffs that the bright side of things is that Anet will get back on some kind of track again.  They will have some actual direction on where to take this game and realize they need to make some minor and major changes to the game if they want to continue their success.
---
About the latter, are you changing builds often/craft stuff or convert gold to gems? From my experience it takes quite a bit of gold :3
---
I need that chair.
---
Demon as opposed to assassin or renegade? Demon is largely centered around condition damage and condition mitigation. With a proper build, it can be powerful but it entirely depends on what the rest of your build looks like. Renegade+runes of tormenting+demon gives you a huge amount of sustain if you choose to run conditions for example.
---
This [raid build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/) uses demon and renegade
---
Herald is not really all that much easier to play tbh, mostly because neither build is inherently all THAT difficult to. It provides a lot of boons to allies really easily, along with assassin's presence, but it loses out on the renegade's ability to generate alacrity as easily.
---
 
---
So you go to an event for the 1. time bring a bad build and fail. 
---
And you want better rewards?
---
I want to have some chalange in this game, plz do not take that away from us. Maybe you should research what you did wrong , improve yourself, maybe edjukate others like you what they can do better and help everyone to overcome this "I wiped on my 1. try, but give me more loot" mentality.
---
saves a lot of management time, but the 1 rare per day might stack up over time in individual slots though.
---
...and we're back to buttcapes!
---
What the hell is this ugly monstrosity?
---
Thank you for saving fractals &lt;3
---
Great, even more huge flashy noisy SAB stuff to pollute our screens all year round...
---
Did they really develop an entire outfit set just so they could make that pun? Lmaoo
---
Outfit itself looks great! 
---
yeah it's a good time. The player base is healthy, and if you haven't played much as you said, then there's still a lot of content for you to uncover.
---
That being said, the yearly event Super Adventure Box is starting up on Thursday, which might make the player count seem a little lower than normal in most areas of the game 
---
Oh, that makes open world a lot more fun on some classes! And I agree, the combat and movement make me spoiled for other games. I can't deal with mounts in other games after using the ones from PoF. And the ability to jump and dodge in combat makes it feel more dynamic.
---
If you're very new to the game: remember to try out different weapons on your character. It'll make everything feel different as well. Some weapons will be far superior for end game content, but some will be great for utility in open world. 
---
For example, I play as a thief and have it as a Daredevil (elite spec from HoT) most of the time in open world. Its best weapon for pure damage is a staff that you whack your enemies with, but I also tend to take a shortbow for mobility as my off hand. Sometimes I take dagger/pistol for easy access to stealth. Other times I feel like taking sword/dagger. And other times I just swap to the elite spec from PoF, Deadeye, and run around with a rifle. Or two pistols. 
---
Also, if you use the Instant Level 80 ticket you get from buying the expansions you can try out all classes at lvl 80 (though with vanilla specs) in a lvl 80 map that is a lot of fun. You can use that to figure out what you want your next character to be. You can use the level boost in your shared inventory slot and as long as you don't consume it (which requires a confirmation so you won't accidentally do it) you can just keep it in the shared slot and make a new character to try it out at level 80 again. 
---
Have fun and test shit!
---
If you want to do condition damage, demon/renegade is the better option.
---
Herald typically shares a lot of boons, so I wouldn't say it's selfish. It might be easier to play since you have more passive skills.
---
Is it... Is it safe for me to return to fractals yet?
---
dw, I saw that and deleted it asap.
---
I won't tell since it's kinda an exploit. I don't play soulbeast so it's not like I'm abusing it. It goes away when going downstate or mounting so it's not that useful for open world.
---
I love the "Collect 8 Magic Coins" reference to the 8 Red Coins in Super Mario!
---
I think a lot of that is due to the main reward being stat selectable items. S4 can't really use those as a draw, because S3 already did it, and they really didn't come up with something new that has the same draw.
---
I see your point. Still it was an interesting instability for groups that breezed through fractals, but didn't "speedrun" them. It fucked newer players and more hardcore players. So I am okay that Anet removed it (for now).
---
You're done. don't make more
---
🦀JAGEX POWERLESS AGAINST A PVP CLAN🦀
---
Yes, Demon as opposed to Assassin.  Thank you for this input.  I'm having a really hard time figuring out what I'm doing.  All of the Renegade utilities have a reticle which throws me off.  I'm also always forgetting which one buffs the group, which one debuffs the mobs, etc.  So I'm kind of just "pressing everything" until I deplete energy.  It's utter garbage, and if I ever want to play with a skilled group, I had better get my stuff together.  I just can't figure out really, just plain out what to do.  I don't intend to get into any sort of condi build because I'm thinking that will exacerbate my current problem.  I think Power DPS is my best bet - would you agree?  I don't know anything about Herald, so I was more or less poking around to see if it's a bit more auto-pilot than Renegade.  And to think I benched my Mesmer due to having a hard time understanding the play style. 
---
Assassin for damage
---
Dwarf for stability with the road ability and damage reduction AOE damage if needed
---
Demon if you need boon removal (useful in fractals) , you can also create dark fields if needed
---
Well no that’s not what I mean - I’m talking about scenarios where the Warclaw evades through a Zerg safely and where 2 players are on a warclaw and neither wants to dismount because it’s not advantageous. Also the constant flipping of camps due to how fast each player is due to the mount. Solo/duo roamers are at a huge disadvantage not to mention those without the mount. 
---
Ideally I’d like to see the evade frames be shorter or making the warclaw travel less distance when evading. 
---
I'm pretty sure the grind but it's referring to the leveling process
---
Ever since ls3 ascended back packs are as easy as ascended rings, hopefully it comes with both bauble infusions!
---
So was it also useless before PoF?
---
Herald does have kind of an auto-pilot type of style, but the better you are at playing herald, the less you are constantly on auto
---
Try the power build, I think it's easier to manage yourself because it's burstier and works better on short fights. 
---
The herald skills have two pieces. The first click toggles on a passive boon generation, the second click uses the active skill and disables the boon generation with a cooldown. So it does still require some management, especially since the passives decrease your energy generation. But it might be easier at least to get used to first.
---
Renegade on the other hand, the utilities are like this
---
6) your heal, does a burst heal first and then small ticks of healing afterwards, pretty straightforward
---
7-9) you have one skill which bleeds, one skill which generates vulnerability, and one skill which CCs and stunbreaks. I have it organized 7:bleed, 8:vuln, 9:CC, which I think is the default, but maybe try organizing it in a way that makes sense to you? With herald you'll still have to remember which one gives fury, which one gives might, and which one gives swiftness so remembering your skill order is still important
---
10) life steal and extra dps, this one is toggled on and off, unlike the other 4 skills which are on a timer
---
Necromancers are a great choice for a new player because they're so tough. A minionmancer can solo many champions, and scourges and reapers are good in most game modes. You picked well for that second choice!
---
I've played since launch and took a break in the middle but am now getting back into group content. I've had some experienced friends help me ease into lower-tier fractals, and they can be quite fun, if a little overwhelming at first because of the sheer number of them to remember mechanics for. Are you on an American or European server? I have characters on both and would be happy to help guide you through some low-level fractals with friends so you can learn the mechanics. No elitism or judgment, no dps meters, nothing like that. Just some dorks having fun.
---
That dude must be really happy to be away from here.
---
If they were effort based then choices could still mean something.  But instead it’s time based. :(
---
It's not like this game is called Guild Wars 2 or anything... oh wait
---
I can’t recall exactly off the top of my head but I want to say the lava skipping segment in zone 1-2?
---
I’ll be open to suggestions from people on improving my runs for sure. Right now the biggest thing holding me back are simple mistakes, I hope to iron out the run this month!
---
Theoretically possible.
---
It includes additional red one.
---
While you are correct that OP needs to improve, let's be real.
---
The rewards for all of the PoF Meta Events are crap, which is one of the reasons almost noone does them.
---
Why would I ever go through the trouble of getting enough people to the Map (in Serpent's Ire case ~50, so you have 10 ppl on every Zealot) coordinating them so that we actually are 10 per Zealot and go through the trouble of explaining them their CC's (as someone else said, this one is on the Devs for having absolutely no Info on CC in the game) in order to do an event that takes what? 20 minutes? and then gives me the same loot any other Event in the PoF Region would've gotten me.
---
HoT Meta Events see huge numbers of players doing them every day for more than 3 years now, because they are fast (DS aside, though I do think a lot of people do this daily) you don't need a shitton of people to do them and the loot is pretty good on all of them.
---
Meanwhile PoF Metas only get done every other day if you're lucky. They need change or will stay dead
---
chestception: did the wyvern during VB meta, got a map specific rare container which i opened to get a rare unid gear which then finally give me the rare gear :D
---
OwO
---
I'm kind of confused by the unidentified gear changes. They said one of their major goals was
---
&gt;to separate regional drops more clearly, so players get jungle loot in the jungle, desert loot in the desert, and so on.
---
but it doesn't sound like they've added different types of unidentified gear. One of the changes is 
---
&gt;Added fine and masterwork Reclaimed weapons to the pool of items available from fine and masterwork unidentified gear
---
as well as
---
&gt;Significantly reduced the chances of acquiring rare Sunspear weapons from pieces of rare unidentified gear.
---
So now you get unidentified gear anywhere in the game, and have a chance to get either PoF or HoT skins from them? That seems like it's going in the opposite direction of one of their major stated goals.
---
Just finished getting my warrior to max level and realized that I didn't really enjoy playing as that profession. Currently thinking about using Elementalist, but I've stumbled upon many many posts about how it's a very weak class, especially solo. Is that true? I'm looking for a class I can enjoy, get to level 80, then hopefully get into WvW and Fractals with. I've chosen ele because of how complicated and colourful the combat is which is something I missed playing as warrior. Are Elementalists really that weak?

i'm not against the mount in general, i'm just tired of these "i told you so" situations. and instead of many old issues getting properly addressed, we now just see attempted band aid fixes for exploits that were the exact reason many people kept saying that the mode isn't ready for mounts.
---
Which general purpose herald build do you fancy?  Would you say the herald has higher burst dps than renegade?  I'm going to at least give it a try, and who knows, maybe it will click.  Thanks for all this info too.
---
It's a mix, honestly. I started doing it because I wanted to get everything unlocked that SAB offered - and I found out last year that trying to speedrun it was actually extremely fun. I also wanted to do it without ever using an overlay to help, so I had to learn the paths from testing and watching other people speedrun.
---
Now it's more of a tradition and personal challenge - I'd like to have the best run for it at least once. I also use it as a reason to enjoy SAB when it comes around since we haven't had new content in it in awhile, plus it keeps me motivated to slowly earn the red skin rewards each year.
---
If i remember, they did respond last year and said it could be problematic to change the achievment to work on get X out of the collection. Makes sense what they did tbh.
---
JAGEX POWERLESS AGAINST A PVP CLAN
---
Weak? No, not at all
---
In PvE, they dominate DPS consistently, and in WvW they are great backline fighters with high range and AoE potential
---
They do fall flat in PvP often though
---
What elementalists are is not weak. It's that they're squishy. Like, a good strong breeze will blow them down
---
1. I already did an bug report.
---
2. Exactly the same bug was shown on this reddit before with at least 300 upvotes I just show that the fix didn't change anything.
---
We already did that after HoT, if you didn't notice. Game tried to take turn to the better, but it's established audience dragged it down.
---
I made a promise to myself to never buy outfits again. 
---
because they keep adding stupid grind like the armor/weapon collections to the story achievements tab, instead of adding them to collections. as person who did every single story achievement tab (also in season 1), requiem armor and the dragonsblood collection i still didn't do (cuz of dead game, dont feel like playing)
---
Okay thank you, I will start an elementalist. You mentioned they fall flat in PvP, do you think I can still play PvP as one and do ok or is that kind of out of question as I'll just keep dying? For this character I was hoping to do some of the leveling through getting tomes of knowledge in PvP and WvW just to switch things up a bit.
---
aaaah I'm always hoping for mount skins lmao... but this is looking good!
---
I know they want to make UNID gear equal across the board but you don't do that by punishing players with max MF. What they really need to do is let MF affect *everything* if they want to keep that change. Boss chests for example would be huge if they were affected by it. All this change does is knock down vets with max MF to give new players a equal field.
---
Oh. And if they're on it, they just could add gliders for the Spinal Blades
---
Theres also a higher chance of getting a Kaiser snake weapon box in Trib mode which sell for a pretty penny.  Or if you're trying to unlock them all, this is the way to do it.  
---
i think i did this with the super glider too. The stance, the trail, the giggles...i loved it

I really hope the SAB chair isn't the only new SAB gemstore item or its just another wasted opportunity. I really wish Anet knew how to capitalize on monetizing events because they're doing a poor job.
---
&gt; This is horrible news. Instead of fixing the problems, anet AGAIN went with the cheap solution and just removed it. Nothing changed. Nothing learned.
---
&gt; 
---
I don't agree with you here. Fractals were bleeding players hard and fast, and removing this before finding a solution or replacement was imho the right move. Just because it's fast, easy and you can't do anything wrong.
---
I really do like the difficulty of this event. However I do agree that the rewards for this event are something to be desired. Which makes the meta far more difficult to complete because there are few players that will want to do this event now. I hope they will look into the event but keep the difficulty just boost the rewards to get more players to join it.

Just try out [this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Glint) build, it should be enough to get you set up

Actually fits together rather well. Spruce up some of the clipping and that would be armor I would gladly go for.

They just forgot the comma, it is really called "Guild, Wars 2"

Im actually pretty glad there's no SAB mounts. Honestly the glider from a few years back personally annoyed me a bit and I feel like mounts would make me wanna just play the game muted in high pop areas. However I have a mighty fucking need for that Legion Jetpack
---
Just started Chuka and Champawat and already having fun with it. Shame the Largos is still bugged. 
---
did all cc skills on my list, all giving 150-200 cc bar dmg but well, dunno man, maybe i was the only one trying to knock the cc bar
---
try it yourself
---
&gt; Anet has no idea how to capitalize on monetizing events because they're doing a poor job at it.
---
Or they still hold on to what's left of this game's visual consistency.
---
I only played pvp a little bit a few years ago. Yet I still understand this very well.
---
Some things never change it would seem.

Commander will call for "ranged damage" = drop marks.
---
Commander will call for "shades" = drop F1, F2, F4, F5 (use F3 a little more wisely).

Commander will call for "wells" = drop Well of Corruption and Well of Suffering.
---
Commander will call for "breach" = drop Ghastly Breach on the thickest clump of players you can reasonably stand on without dying.

That's it. Just have good positioning and follow directions and you're good to go.

chrono is dead now 
---
* Chrono/Druid is fine for pugging.  Consumable CC is helpful.

I was hoping for a sort of stone-skin look, as if your character was carved from stone like a gargoyle on the side of a church or something to that effect. Would have been the first outfit I bought tbh
---
Ah god....  already better.  Haven't actually played yet, but I notice ONE F-key ability.  So good.
---
This meta has been talked about before and complained about before too.  You need a good tag to explain to ppl up front before zealot phase and describe best hard CC to equip imo.  TTS has been running it for a while and one method is to have 4 groups with maybe 5-7 ppl with really hard CC each on a zealot, and a fast kill group mob of the rest of the ppl burning one and moving to the next.  This seems to work well, but I used to see the split up into equal groups method work in the past but it hasn't been done that way successfully very much lately that I have seen.  
---
The big thing I have seen is how well the tag explains the mechanics and locations. If by zealot phase ppl haven't been told anything or don't listen its pretty much a guaranteed failure.  Ppl generally don't want to listen to map chat comments, sad really but that's the way it is .
---
Can Istan still be used as a regular gold farm? How is it compared to something like SW? I haven't gotten there yet.

Or just normal tiered fracs for starters. Certain combos on certain days basically meant, "Guess Im just not doing fracs today" shrug*
---
The only thing that chrono does better is the 600 range pull that does not get body blocked.
---
prices already tanked.  such a shame.  I went to cursed shore and did events that usually get tons of loot.  I got a whopping 2 blue bags.  Such a shame.  
---
If it reduces the inventory clutter just a little bit, it was needed. Up until now in all loot heavy content you had to sort your inventory like every 10-15 minutes, I hope this change will make this interval much longer.
---
T1-T3 the burning stacks were absolutely killing players.  Condition cleanses are far more plentiful at T4.  Problem is that players at lower tiers are much slower to adapt unless you specifically tell them which skills and traits to use.  It's a little saddening, but par for course.  Most players just don't have particularly high class knowledge or adaptability knowledge. 
---
Slippery Slope was fine for normal T4's mostly, but in CMs it was an unmitigated disaster.  I only did CMs a couple of times with Slippery Slope.  You need more precise movement, and having that stolen away from you was really frustrating.  I won't be sad to see it go from Fractals like Deepstone either.  Well, I may miss the ragequits that give me a free daily, but ehhhh majority &gt; few haha. 
---
Birds was cool in theory, but annoying in practice.  It procced far too often and became a lifestyle rather than an instability.  I think the majority of the new instabilities -- especially the harder one's were based around fractal potions.  The difference between WBF with an omni-potion and default experience was like night and day -- you don't have enough dodges to mitigate burning at lower tiers without outside condition-cleansing support, whereas with potions it's pretty much a joke so long as you're paying attention. 
---
Unique food, yes. Good food, no
---
when i see the d bar, hard and soft cc all into it before anything else lol
---
Just not by birds
---
Not really, no. It's good to do once a day, but you can't mindlessly sit on it all day to farm nearly as well anymore
---
Slippery Slope was absolute cancer in 100 CM and/or any time you wanted to use a leap attack. I didn't mind it in places like Molten Furnace where the overall difficulty of the fractal was low so it was just funny/silly to deal with, but I hated it in a lot of other places.
---
Yeah. I'd be nice if they got reworked into kits, this way elementalists could always bring an alternate melee or ranged weapon when their main weapon is only ranged like a staff or only melee like the sword.

We Bleed Fire was arson at T1-T3.  Players would burn to death left and right unless I told them exactly which traits and utilities to take to help them mitigate condition pressure.  It was kind of silly, but it really goes to show how little people know their classes; swapping a single utility skill or their heal to benefit the group.  
---
Birds would be okay if they didn't linger around so much.  It felt like 2 instabilities in one because of the interaction.  You had the ticking HP damage and blind plus the "transferable" birds that should have been charged loitering fines.  Getting blinded when you were trying to use pulls like GS5, Focus 4 or Axe 3 was really irritating.  
---
Slippery Slope should never have been allowed to be active on Deepstone, Nightmare or Shattered Observatory.  I think the challenge mote Fractals are hard enough without having to worry about whether you're going to slide into OHKO orange circles or whether your CC is going to put compromise your positioning.  Deepstone is all about positioning and denial of space too.  Yuck.  
---
Who needs gold, when you have Faith in Sigmar Heldenhammer?!

All or nothing? Looks like it's nothing after all.

well for some its quite an effort to log in every day...

I mean, yes. That's was the general consensus pre-PoF.

That would be the best QoL change an ele can hope for to be honest.

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently  maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own  journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't  leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of  Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.

now im hoping for a molten jetpack glider skin

wait wat, serpent's ire has junundu supports like Branded Shatterer?  first time i've heard of that

Rarity of the UG drops themselves are affected by MF:  
---
 * Piece of Common Unidentified Gear  (blue)
---
 * Piece of Unidentified Gear  (green)
---
 * Piece of Rare Unidentified Gear  (yellow)
---
 * Exotic (identified only, orange)
---
The contents of the UG are not affected by MF.
---
Not sure what the current description is, or if it clearly explains this or that.
---
is one of them lyssa ?
---
as a mesmer geek , i would be soooooo fucking excited to see Lyssa.
---
Ive done a good majority of them across all seasons and episodes... the issue with the latest ones is how annoyingly intricate alot of the achieves are or time consuming.  Plus the AP aint worth it... and some of the story mission related ones are a fucking pain in the ass and dont have respawns making you go through the whole fuckin mission in some cases... fuck that.
---
Same here.  I'm wanting to finish all the weapon skins and any other random achievements this year.  I used to speed run and sell 2-2 trib mode when you could do that and i got pretty quick so learning the others probably wouldn't be that difficult.  
---
Aw I'm kinda sad they're gone :(  
---
I know I'm probably one of the very few players that liked those instabilities, but I found them fun and challenging!  
---
Maybe they will tweak them a bit before putting them back to the game, like slippery slope affecting all the movement skills... that really was a pain, I agree.
---
More instabilities would be amazing too, they make daily fractals more fun and less repetitive :D  
---
this is what i was wondering, seems so uncomfortable
---
Ridiculous
---
Especially considering massive fps drop once things start uncloaking en masse in your face.
---
If you are in a cc subgroup (from my experience 5 people per group on Eu) you can bring [purchasable bundles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purchasable_bundles) that offer cc skills on top of your class specific ones to make this phase a bit easier. 
---
Even as someone who likes glow, this outfit seems like it would be ugly either way.
---
Ah, I remember the days when people complained about the twilight oasis being annoying.
---
Then the Birds+Skating+Deep stone came out..
---
Did you not read the thread about their plans for Warclaw? Everything that you're conplaining abiut they said that they are working on and /or considering but it won't be ready for the next update which would have... Exactly what we got.
---
What's the pun?
---
The best is if you have a good build for just trolling the other team and get 3 people tied up trying to kill you off point, yet your team seems incapable of killing anything.
---
To Amtur Arena! 
---
A man cam dream.
---
I think he has a setup to check for any file that gets updated or added whenever there is an update. Updated map tiles would definitely trigger this.
---
[There was word about it a week ago](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/71944/upcoming-warclaw-bug-fixes-changes)
---
I accidentally read your user name as Lysis buffer queen.
---
Chrono does what they do easier and without as much positioning restrictions.
---
That being said Renegade healer with Zerk FB (with some diviners) has better over all DPS.
---
&gt;No. They are skills. Just because it doesn't go in a square skill slot doesn't mean it isn't a skill. The default dodge is a 'context' skill like the finisher and revive used with F. A context skill.
---
No.
---
&gt;Some traits adds skills when they are used, like the warrior damage on dodge, but other traits replace the dodge skill. Traits that add on top of the dodge work more like the skills triggered by a sigil, on top of the skill that triggers them.
---
Traits that replace the dodge, like mirage, daredevil and mount dodges change the skill for a different on altogether.
---
Thieves and revenants use a slightly different version with a different animation. It's not just "a visual played when dodging", it's a different skill with a different visual, like when gathering with different gathering tools. Each tool triggers a different skill with the gathering points at different times in the channeling.
---
Unhindered Combatant adds a new skill, Dash, to your dodge.
---
He datamines stuff so he prolly got it from something that was added to the game files.
---
ah that makes sense, thanks
---
Your getting bad FB's then.
---
When done right the only thing chrono does that FB/Ren cannot is portals.
---
-10 downvotes because no one got this obvious pun. Really GW2 reddit? Cut him some slack.
---
I have to stop grinding Silverwastes and just finish the gw1 campaign. I'm not appreciating the lore D:
---
It's just a supply road for a NPC army that helps peons at serpents ire
---
I'm expecting a raid as well. Ahdashim's size seems perfect for that.
---
It would also be a living story maps but lore wise there's really nothing much there that would justify this destination. 
---
I feel you, but try a PvP server in WoW post fly mounts. Sounds like about the same to me, but idk. I dont really play WvW...
---
honestly birds and slippery first if they don't mix together and slippery not on any platform T4 like deepstone everything else is fine. Birds' is nothing but just little annoying, what concerns me is the 30% HP off with outflanked get you one shot if you mess just a little and got hit in your back lol
---
They keep adding all this random stuff to the SAB lobby instead of actually finishing World 3 and 4.
---
You may not advertise any items or services, in-game or in real-life, you are selling/trading. Selling art/commissions is excluded from this rule.
---
Referral links are also prohibited, exception being referral links to the official Guild Wars 2 store provided by ArenaNet themselves to their partners.
---
True. However, most of them make fractals more challenging. Birds on the other hand isn’t necessarily hard to deal with. You literally just dodge. The issue is that it’s extremely frustrating to play with.
---
The pun is on the word shatter and how it is being used both figuratively and literally (as in shattering glass).
---
Oh, sorry I read about them on the Super adventure Festival page. I figured the festival and the box happen at the same time.
---
In my experience, all you have to do is hit the jump key shortly after dismounting. Very easy to time right.
---
Those two could not be counter-acted though.
---
You could not work around them, they were a pure hindrance.
---
I'm thinking about making the Shining Blade, which would be the first 2nd gen Legendary for me (I have Bolt and Bifrost). Aside from the gold grind and leveling up crafting, what other kinds of commitments/work are there? 
---
I was thinking that we bleed fire is the next most punishing instability but that was nerfed and looks manageable.
---
I'm still stuck at Green Rose Dye \**sobs**
---
The sense of modesty of the male population in Tyria strikes again. Also why the extra 'tunic' piece of fabric? (Unless I'm just not catching that it's on the female model too. At work, so can't check in-game yet).
---
Or you know, they can make actual interesting, fun, and challenging encounters instead of relying on artificial difficulty with shitty instabilities. Give us more 99/100 CM type fractals instead of the garbage we've been getting like Siren's Reef.
---
My theory is that Balthazar will rekindle his fire after being reunited with his sword inside Kralkatorrik, making a triumphant return by slashing his throat from the inside.
---
oh wow that sucks
---
**NYOOM MOTHERFLUFFERS**
---
Damn, that looks good.
---
But it fits the *theme*
---
^^yeah ^^a ^^new ^^color ^^would ^^be ^^great
---
crystalline ingots and HoT map completion for the gift of maguuma mastery, and the gift of battle from WvW for the gift of the mists  
---
A steep drop after Flashpoint (S3E5), surprising because the last episode (S3E6) is also needed for Aurora. Looks like many players gave up midway through the Wayfarer's Henge collection.
---
eye blink log in loot logout &gt; character select login again without even i could right click to report , yeah you can consider that AUTO LOOT lol
---
Why?  It still impacts the drops, just not a second time when identified.
---
As someone who loves outfits/armor/weapons/etc based on the gods, I kind of wish they would have released the Grenth/Melandru weapons and Melandru's Regalia (the only missing one, unless you count Kormir).
---
Awesome! Now we just need Asuras as ammunition to cover those SM defenders in 25 stacks of smart-ass.
---
Thus, medium term plans?
---
Just a sidenote: They introduced a skip button long ago. You can simply teleport to the boss battle when starting the mission. :-) Also I remember there were some tricks for doing the avoiding the ice attack achievement. Something about special spots where you could stand or something like that. It's been a long time since I've done this, so I don't remember everything, but it was not that hard to get. Maybe I'll find the guide I used...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b5tofb/are_firebrand_and_renegade_viable_as_support/ejfzqyt/
---
actually yes things have finally changed a bit
---
They should do a jetpack "springer" mount.  When you are walking/running, it just does little jump spurts.  Then you can charge it for a big leap.
---
I also just like the WvW community. More relaxed by far
---
Lol so basically everyone is a Druid with flight form... Great...
---
&gt;I don't recall having these issues when I first started the game
---
Might be the area you are in. FPS is notably lower in newer areas.
---
Personally I get ~100+ FPS in Bloodtide Coast, and ~50 FPS in Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Easy ways to gain FPS are to lower player count, disable post processing, lower shaders/shadows. I would do it in that order, as lower shaders will have a significant impact on your graphics quality.
---
My Iron legion Engineer is gonna be SO happy.
---
How much time does your route save over the TacO route? I am planning on going ham on SAB to try to get the blue infusion.
---
Air Keep:
---
You'll find bosses and interesting stuff here and there, there are, however bigger, bladder scheduled bosses, World Bosses, as they call them, but I'd say, find some friends to play with, it'll be more fun :D
---
The container rolls on 2 tables: map currency and rare gear. All the regular rare gear that used to drop got replaced with the Unid bag, but the Reclaimed rares are still on the table.
---
The generic Bag of Rare gear that drops from the metas is really awful though, as it's just a single piece of Rare Unid inside.
---
Source: opened 40~ of each on my HoT toons and got Rare Unids and Reclamed weapons.
---
explore the map, clear the heart quests and you will unlock the story in due time.
---
GW2 is a very open sandbox style game.  You have the freedom to go where you want and do what you want, and you'll earn XP as you do it.  When you were done the tutorial, you should have been placed in the open world in your race's newbie section, and there will be several "renown heart" areas around you.  Completing various tasks there will fill the heart and get you an XP reward, but that's not the only thing you can do.  Look for dynamic events as well, they offer more interesting tasks for you, sometimes advance the area's story, and give you more XP.
---
In terms of boss battles and quests, all the newbie zones except the Charr zone Plains of Ashford have a world boss in them, though you'll want to be level 10-15 to have a better chance of surviving in the areas they are.  Those world bosses are on a two hour timer, spawning at either :15 or :45 after depending on the boss.  And your Personal Story (quest) will open up to you once you hit level 10, letting you advance your individual storyline via instanced content.
---
If you have other questions, just let me know!
---
This is one of the best and worst parts of Guild Wars 2. The game kinda just throws you into the world after a short tutorial. You can essentially do whatever you want, but keep in mind your level. Every 10 levels, starting at 10 you will unlock a new segment of the main story. To level in-between the quests you can explore the map and do what is known as heart quests. You get xp for just about anything you do in GW2. If your looking to fight some tougher opponents, “world events” will happen around you. This events will be shown usually as orange circles in an area with an objective or sometimes a boss monster will be the objective.
---
Bed advice I can give is to take it at your own pace and have fun exploring the world. 
---
See you around in Tyria!
---
Yeah but the casual group/pve players that are just there to farm stuff by capping love it and shoot anyone down that doesnt.
---
They say that they love their safe passage with no risk to their group.
---
I don't think an average DH or FB can solo a champion bounty. A druid with his pet tanking might be able to pull it off.
---
I do wonder, was that section the same before the map change? Anyone (\*coughOPcough\*) been up there before?  
---
Additionally, they really didn't make it hard to get there at all. I was able to just griffon over the rocky ledge on the west side of this area. And there's a ledge east of it that you can get here with the skimmer. 
---
Man, that's still the best trailer anet has ever done for this game *and I'm not even shitting on their other trailers*.
---
I'm not entirely sure, as I've never used TacO Route! TacO Route might recommend a lot of the same time skips -- I based my route off of Torvagent's videos with some very slight modifications from other player's speedruns of the individual stages. 
---
However, Taco might also recommend safer routes that are less likely to result in a death - for instance, the corner jump in 1-1, instead of taking the long way around towards the Mother Bee Hive, saves a ton of time but is ridiculously tough to nail every time.
---
As a somewhat new (2 weeks lvl 70) csn someone explain this?
---
They will never finish those worlds, especially without Josh Foreman.
---
Agree with this, though it's worth nothing that the WvW and PvP legendary armors don't share the PvE legendary armor skin.
---
10/10 for somehow making chaos gloves work my dude
---

---
What comp did you have?
---
Most Unid'd gear comes from containers that aren't impacted at all by magic find anyways.
---
Why so blue?
---
Sorry. :oP
---
sorting inventory? right click copperfed, salvage all, deposit all, time spent 5seconds
---
You should!
---
Please don't play with my emotions like this. I loved Balthazar as a villain, and I think he left us too soon. 
---
And maybe I'm being optimistic, but this could make spvp a contender for profit?
---
&gt; Put everything on the lowest possible settings and enjoy a game that looks like shit.
---
gw2 is theme park, not sandbox
---
When Bloodstone Fen and Ember Bay came out I was still excited as to what they would bring, but there is basically nothing that rewarding to do in the maps after the story. I think they needa change up the type of content in each new map. Stat selectable trinkets is one thing that is good, but other that that, I dont find myself playing the maps, even then. I can just WvW the map currency if I want to, the map itself doesn't bring much to the table IMO. 
---
Dry Top and SW are even more interesting maps to me than most of the new maps.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Completion of HOT or POF maps.

800 of each HOT map currency.
---
A few thousand unbound magic (or HOT map currency,  UM is much easier to collect IMHO).
---
Crystalline ingots as mentioned in the other reply, which is the biggest timesync.  You might need to spend other map currency to buy machetes for dragon stand for the ores.
---
Your questions are subjective.  Maybe you'd enjoy the game for a week.  Maybe with a good guild/community you'd enjoy it for a few months.  Do you see where I'm going with this...? 
---
Playing on your own will inevitably get "boring," unless you're willing to learn new classes, setup new builds and do things differently.  Playing with other players can help you improve your solo play as well.  PoF is more solo friendly than HoT is, but they're both more difficult than core GW2.  You should expect to occasionally run into bottlenecks where you'll want or need to ask for help. 
---
Don't leave me now! I need your strength!

there's barely anyone left at anet who even worked on fractals etc.
---
Hello everyone!
---
First things first I played vanilla gw2 I know many things have changed. For start I want to level up new character and I have few questions:
---
1. What server should I pick, I want an active server where I can do WvW (or whatever it was called) I really enjoyed it but on my first account I played on a server where WvW was pretty dead.
---
2. Second question is about class pick. I want to pick viable class for PvP and raids and I like to play casters (I hope it's not too much to ask). I was playing in semi - hardcore guilds in WoW, and I like to clear content (I know raids are different here in gw2 and content is not that hardcore but I don't have that much time theese days).
---
3. Are there any guides for returning players? I'm MMO veteran so I know the basics.
---
I want to focus mainly on PvP I know probb most of classes are viable for anything as long as I'm not a hardcore player but still I don't want to pick something that's underpower and regret it. Thanks for any response!
---
Playing it seems like a good idea? I'd suggest finding a friendly guild that has fun and engages in varied activities. 
---
Yeah i think this is the crux of the issue. On paper, Firebrigade looks great, but in practice the runs are just so incredibly sloppy in comparison to when I'm on Chrono and in the driver's seat, so to speak. I think it's mostly just an issue of me having years and years of practice on Chrono, vs the FB and Ren just being completely clueless. 
---
I think this makes the most sense. I don't really see the main story segwaying into Ahdashim, but with our lair of zomorros raid, this would be a good follow up. 
---
99 CM is like that sometimes. Usually it's harder than 100CM, with MAMA and 2nd boss being quite difficult with certain instabilities, esp if you dont have good breakbar dmg. 
---
If it's that bad, just skip to T4s.
---
I more think the Celestial Chicken is the soul of the chicken on the Left!
---
This is the correct answer. Patch dropped and prices still being figured out, so figure it out yourself too. Cannot hand out info we don’t have yet.
---
Damage from confusion is only not shown if it's triggered by the boss using an instant cast skill (your game doesn't know it triggered confusion). That is mainly the case on Soulless Horror (~half of confusion damage, indeed up to 10k) and Mursaat Overseer (all confusion damage).
---
On Twin Largos specifically, the damage is rather accurate. You'd see at most 1-1.5k more dps in self stats (that basically uses the combat data you see in your combat log chat which is accurate for all *your* confusion) there.
---
Of course on Soulless Horror you'd have to ask the mirages for their self stats dps to compare.
---
No Lunar Year celestial mounts either :(.
---
Having to put a 6-7 year old game on lowest settings to have a smooth fps should not be a thing.
---
1) [NA tier list](https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/na/wvw), [EU tier list](https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/eu/wvw). Generally, the higher tier servers are going to be the more populated WvW servers. 
---
2) Elementalist is high aoe dps, complicated rotation, easy to get wrecked if you're not careful. It's the most classic "caster" type if you use a staff. Great in PvE and WvW, not as good in sPvP.
---
Mesmer is high evasion/block, medium dps, great support build if that's what you're interested in instead. It does well in PvP, and for a long time was pretty much a guaranteed raid pick due to its support and tanking ability (as strange as that seems)
---
Necro is medium dps, although getting substantially better. In PvE, it's built into two separate builds primarily. Melee DPS (huge life pooi + secondary life bar with shroud), or support (tons of barrier potential, grants allies effectively an extra temporary life bar)
---
It would help if you described what you want from a caster class
---
3) [sidebar](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Also could be related to Shiny the saltspray dragon and Goren. Cantha confirmed?
---
Sounds like a cool and easy option to get back into skills and mechanics!
---
But I would prefer an other asura as host since newly joined players or reeeaaally long gone players would fuck up their timeline if they get introduced to "grown up" taimi before they even start LWS 2 / HoT (not to mention it's already kinda fucked up without replayable LWS 1)
---
Every day, all fractals have extra difficulties (instabilities) For T4, there are 3 random instabilities. Birds and slippery slope were two oft those instabilities that everyone just hated
---
TO VABBI!
---
(I don't think you understood the reference)[https://youtu.be/DxmkAoLC6_4]
---
I'll miss Slippery Slope in fractals, birds not so much.
---
This was always a thing. De-sync between your game client and the server, one side thinks you are still on the mount, the other you are not. WvW servers were always a bit wonky, that's why it's happening there the most.
---
Fun fact, the stealth you get from the glider mastery is the same as the one you get from mesmers. I was going to test out if you can get the achievement/collection for each class if you glide close to a Mesmer that uses mass invisibility but never got around to it. 
---
Thanks you, to specify in WoW I played as a shadow priest which is DoT based really high apm caster. I'd like to play complicated but rewarding class. For what you've written I can assume elementalist is something that I'd appreciate. Also what could you reccomend for sPvP again I'd appreciate if it'd be a caster.
---
Here are some resources to check out: 
---
* [WvW stats](https://wvwstats.com/na) has more detailed WvW info including what times are most active for each server

* [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) has raid benchmarks, builds, and guides, including the [weaver rotation](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/) to look at.[Conditon firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/), [condition scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/), [condition renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/), and [power holosmith](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/) might also be to your liking though the last two aren't really casters and firebrand is more of a melee caster with their tomes.

* Metabattle has a bunch of builds as well for all game modes [including sPvP](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest), I'd suggest scourge as a good PvP option for you.
---
The issues you've raised are just bugs..  not an actual issue with the warclaw itself. 
---
And bugs can take time depending on the issue.. some bugs are easier and more simple to fix and therefore are released sooner. 
---
There are also other threads about people's opinions and issues with warclaw that another post this late Into it's release is not needed when you can simply post a comment in those.
---
It wasn't that so much as the stealth glitch that looked fine from your end, but to the enemy you looked like you were still on a mount and rubberbanding like mad all over the screen so it was impossible to tell where you really were. No fun.
---
I do hope it's a raid wing and not a LW map. All I want is to go to the start of the brand! Gief Kralkatorik's lair LW map!
---
Good riddance to that nightmare
---
Why do you say raids wrecked the game?
---
This is certainly a faster reaction time to community input than SA bullshit which we had for 3 years.
---
I meant in the patch notes...
---
As in actually fixed...

It fucks hard with certain professions and skills like ranger axe 5.

When you get to making the shards it is highly suggested that you make [off-hand shards and convert them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards#Notes) to save a lot of gold.
---
Soo punishing vets who worked on maxing out MF.
---
Why do we have it again if its not gonna be used like it should.
---
Sad day.
---
This can't get enough upvotes. All good links needed to be known by all players to really get into and fully explore this game. 
---
Im gonna throw in this one as well. Good for different character builds:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki
---
Oh boo hoo
---
Necromancer (scourge) probably fits more thematically when it comes to aoe DoTs and death theme, but if you want high apm caster, ele (specifically weaver elite spec) is what you want.
---
Good thing about gw2 is that you dont need to invest almost anything in order to play pvp so having alt characters is a pretty good thing. Both mesmer and necro have strong builds there, ele's meta pvp build is more of a fencer than a caster.
---
On Q2'12 CPU?
---
Anyone else feel like this outfit is a but same same with a lot of other existing outfits? It doesn't really jump out for me
---
Now this, I like.
---
No you didn't know BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT. This AMA occurred after the announcement. I'm sorry if you don't remember the arguments between people who said there'd be no expansion and people who said one was coming, or the whoop of excitement when Anet did say at that event that the first expansion was coming, but I remember it quite clearly. 
---
Sure after they announced it, they talked about it. But there was no mention of it before the announcement.
---
I just finished my last heavy armor piece i rather not change class. But ill ask him if hes willing to switch he have more gear then me he might say yes, thanks!
---
It's the other way around, he would be the happiest. I don't think the takeaway from his film is supposed to be that birds are cool because they're elite assassins.
---
If I want mats for myself, what seems best? ID or straight salvage
---
My whole argument is about PoF, not HoT. 
---
People can be in dichotomy, especially if you take two dofferent parts of their life. That can't be denied, no matter how many blogs you post, from a guy who advertise his "15 secret books that help you excel at your career" at the end of his blogs.
---
Raids are faster than PvP and WvW
---
PvP is actually faster than WvW
---
WvW and PvP share the skin, raid one is special
---
Just from the point of play-time.
---
If i miscalculated something half a year ago, please correct me
---
Fucking fights like twilight oasis end boss where you already have to dodge a ton of shit on top of birds on a class that doesn't have any blocks/invul. Literally the peak of aids. 
---
I’m curious as well. Do champ bags still give loot if opened on a sub 80?

It doesn't drop from dungeons but it drops from dungeons boxes/bags etc. So technically it does? I got plenty from my runs today. And yes, it's still included and it's awful.

SAMEEEE

I don't really care what npc hosts the thing zoja maybe

I play both Chrono and Druid in raids regularly. My raid leader gave us some support quickbrand and alacrigade builds to try out. While mechanically I like the tablet skill, as a healer renegade just feels fucking bad. I've played every other support healing build out there and Renegade is by far the worst. Quickbrand is not much better, it has more healing output than Renegade but 40 seconds on your heal book just feels awful compared to how frequently Druid gets CA. Once it's on cooldown you only have weapon skills to apply heals, plus aegis application.  
---
And this is more personal opinion, but both support classes feel so fucking braindead to play. The way you apply quickness and alacrity, compared to chrono, is mindnumbingly boring. Firebrand healing is at least fun, but the delay on Renegade heal skills is fucking stupid. Druid is way more fun to play.

I ended up making a boon tempest, and while it's not best in slot it's 1000x more fun to play.  
---
I'm going to make the dps variants of quickbrand and alacrigade next, and give them a try. I think that is where those classes will find their niche, but not as healers.
---
I'm not understanding the changes. If we salvage without identifying, that still gives us less stuff right?
---
not true. I bought it twice for alt's during this sale and in both cases had to log in to complete purchase **then** manually redeem the serial code.
---
Had my own issue with the discount code though in that after one purchase it wouldn't work again, had to use a browser to purchase the second one, they probably store a redeemed status in a cookie.

I'm sad about SS. That was actually my favorite instability. ):

Plot twist?: It was Menzies who was chained and pretended to be Balthazar the whole time.

You shouldn't get unidentified gear on characters below 80. 
---
Well, the problem is... making  meta event in open world in abandoned map, with close-to-zero reward, that rely on people to properly play thhe game is not a very smart move
