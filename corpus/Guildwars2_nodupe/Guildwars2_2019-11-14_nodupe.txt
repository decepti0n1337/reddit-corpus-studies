People are overanalyzing this. It is not lack or resources or bad code or anything. Before the layoffs and after PoF they had gw2 on minimal effort and were making new games. After the Layoffs the kept gw2 on minimal effort and are making a new game again. The other post about an investment in Ncsoft was pretty much gives it away.
---
I don't feel like subscribtion fee is the problem.
---
Especially when you had a cosmetic or whatever shop for real money currency for such a long time and sold expansions.
---
I don't want mmo genre to become In-game Shop + Expansion + Sub fee. What the fuck? For all these 3 we should have expansion sized content every 2-3 months, but we won't. So no thank you.

#GET 15 MINUTES OF QUICKNESS WHEN KILLING 30 VIGILANCE ENEMIES

What on earth are you basing this off of? I'm not going to claim that there aren't people who think that way but out of all places, the west coast is known for being open minded and accepting. There certainly isn't any sort of widespread Russian hate here. To say "it is western US coast" as if the west coast is the prime example of Russian hatred...this just leaves me very confused.
---
it's actually related to the template patch. the extra life event had its own marker and displayed its content correctly.
---
&gt; they do have the same ressources if the dev teams are comparable in size. 
---
Exactly, we're comparing the size of the dev team that creates content. For all major MMORPGs that's around 200-300 devs.
---
Yes, GW2 doesn't earn as much as FFXIV and WoW, that explains why we don't have a CGI studio for expensive trailers or large marketing campaigns (Kung Fu Tea, Quiznos) or merchandise items. They have a fractal of the customer support since they don't have to handle the same amount of players. FFXIV has its own orchestra to record the music. 
---
These things are nice to have but don't change the amount of playable content provided by the dev team.
---
It's gw1...they are clearly lost.
---
It encourages exploration and going off the beaten path. If you go to places other people aren't, the leveling process is super fast. (I did 60-80 in under 2 hours just killing trash in harathi, for example)
---
I guess it would depend on what you get that character slot for. Just a birthday bot, I'd agree with you. As an alt to play? I made 10+ characters because I was told about birthday gifts and planned to play Gw2 for a long time and have many alts. I've played most of those characters and made many more over the years.   
---
And for anyone looking to grind WvW rank. Birthday boosts are 100% to WvW Rank and last 24h of play time. If you don't waste the booster time, you can rack up a lot of ranks in a much shorter time.
---

I think it's worth mentioning that they just took a new direction to PvP and WvW balance with a new designer put in charge. [Here is his statement](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/90773/lets-talk-about-pvp-balance) with recent comments in the [WvW feedback](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1090643#Comment_1090643) and [PvP feedback](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1090642#Comment_1090642) threads. So hopefully we will see some better focus and balance going forward.

GW2 has one raid setting, both the other big raid MMO's have at least 2, and one has 4.
---
"Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."
---
Nah, it's a matter of minutes. Speak to text. Rethink what? Wanting this dude to get out and stop discouraging new players because he has some beef with GW2.
---
What you call "stalking" is looking public information; welcome to the internet. Which is why you were "stalking" me. So you might want to rethink your life choices and not be a hypocrite spending their time on the internet "stalking" someone on Reddit. 
---
I'm sick of seeing people who don't even play filling up this sub with low effort posts to intentionally discouraging new players.
---
 Yeah, I look into posters before actually making a discussion or argument. Knowing the sources of your information isn't a bad thing bud. Or would you rather be a moron jumping on trains of misinformation? That's another thing you might want to rethink.
---
The reason you say it's not casual is also why it is casual, but there's a twist.  
---
It's casul in the sense that, in some games your choices matter, and you might have to make a new character for a new build, here you fiddle around whenever you feel like it.   
---
for comparison, D3 is the same, however in D2 you spend skillpoints and attributes and will have to make a new character if you make mistakes.  
---
There's no gear treadmill, so if you get ascended, you are basically at the peak, no late hours raiding for the best gear, no dedicating hours of your time for an item your build needs at said raid. and if you just haven't got time, but the know how, your skills and traits matter more, you can get by with exotics.  
---
where this works the other way around is pvp and wvw. here you rely solely on your own skills due to everyone more or less playing at a leveld playing field in wvw. And everything completely even in spvp.  
---
and tbf, most of the people I know don't care about gold to gem conversion for fashion wars, because everything is outfits and there's so little room for personality, which is a HYUUGE marketingflop on anets side. Items would sell better if sold as a outfit but with seperate pieces, that's why you see so many more running around with pieces of profane armor etc than outfits. Outfits are a great choice however for those who just want something decent looking but doesn't care for fashion wars.  
---
Anets bad marketing aside, most fashion wars stuff is farmed through achievements, karma, straight up gold for tp and dungeons etc, which is fairly casual.  
---
So it all depends on what you want from the game, it's casual friendly, but truly shines for those who invest their time into it. (which is why outfits over skins is such a baaad marketing move, I'd be interested to see how much of a better state the game would be in if they raked in so much more money through skins over the years than their outfits, I can only see outfits catering to whales who want to min/max their account and unlock everything, but the same would apply the other way around if they didn't focus on outfits, except more dedicated players who care about fashion wars would also get in on it.)
---
&gt; "Building a fully voice-acted, highly polished open world."
---
Btw that reminds me of ESO, as far as I know every quest NPC is fully voice acted (?). They also had a team of 230 - 250 people at release. However they don't have the dynamic events of GW2 and I don't know much about the DLC content.
---
But at the same time they aren't even investing into those player pool that could be a good buck and increase even further the MMO population and thuse the income...  
---
I mean, why we see no housing ? The system is already there and not only we perfectly know that all the "casual" community would love it, but also it would bring many new and returning players...as well as giving Anet a big source of monetization for what...designing a table with no animations, clipping etc ? I call it a win win situation...and on this system they could build so many other systems for players that want their MMO fluff like farming, raising animals, fishing etc...  
---
I mean, I understand where GW2 wants to aim and i could accept it without a problem. I work etc, so while i like hard content etc...I realize that I do not have much time to play anymore. I also still love the fluff anyway while being a somehow "elitist" player, so I would also love the fluff content...yet GW2 isn't going anywhere right now...or at least it feels so. We're getting more LS stuff and i'm fine, but where is the fluff they're cathering to ? Damn...at this point I would kill for a nice housing system in GW2....anything that gives me extra optional play time that i can dump in the game.
---
I'm.. happy there's no race in GW2 with such hideous eyebrows.
---
&gt; Mismanagement
---
Why are we still debating this? Mismanagement at Anet has been horrendous for such a long time. They might have the resources and devs but someone is making the final decision and deciding its not good enough on so much stuff.
---
That's awesome pal tyvm üëç
---
monthly subscription is not the problem, even all players who are against it will still pay it, should GW2 take that approach.
---
But here is where things become interesting: GW2 will never have a sub fee, Anet will not allow it, as at that point Anet will have to deliver and Anet is not able to commit to content delivery.
---
I exactely meant that. I realize that for them people that want dungeon/raids etc aren't good for the cashing in...
---
Then expand the fluff side. Housing, farming, fishing etc etc etc. Not only it would increase the playerbase, it would also be another easy source of monetization. What I meant is that they aren't doing it either.
---
Right now they keep developing on open world/story etc...and it's fine. But if they want the MMO to keep going for longer they need to improve and invest. Every kind of industry, and especially Americans', know that you have to costantly grow to be successful. You can't stall in any case.
---
But right now they aren't growing, they aren't making anything now...they just keep dishing out the "same old" formula...and the playerbase and revenue are slowly going down ( the quarter sales confirms it)...and the build templates fiasco and...meh. As a 7yo veteran I feel like I have no idea where the game is going, but I feel like it's not going anywhere...and as i said it's not about "hard content" or whatever endgame people think the game need from other MMO. It's just that it's not moving anywhere at all...and i think that's the main reason people felt bummed about having no xpac after LS4.
---
Nice.

I'm not saying that addons are the secret sauce. I am saying that addons have definitely helped.

WoW's quest text has remained essentially the same since launch. When GW2 was released with 3D character models voicing out the lines, it was goddamn revolutionary! WoW has that same feature, now, via addons.

They were Viera in FFTA, Viera in FFXII, Viera and Feol-Viera in FFXII-RW, Viera in FFTA2, etc etc and now they're giving them a new name in some secret backstory for FFXIV? Nah, they're Viera. If it was some big secret/spoiler, than this "true name" shouldn't have been stated in the first place
---
5/7
---
FFXIV was rebuilt from the ground up after an initial flop. You know that situation where you say "If I could do it over I would do [x]". That's basically what the FF team got. Their code probably wound up nice and shiny because they already knew what they wanted to do and what mistakes to avoid.
---
I'm sorry, but is that good?

You wont have 3 and 4, you may have 2. 2 came out 5 years ago.

Whats the first chestpiece? Asking for a friend.

Honestly one of the best looking outfits when dyed properly.
---
Could also be that WoW has attract, or rather retained, veterans and people of great talent to their side a long time ago. If we are looking at this through a linear scope, the defense that people use are still bad. But if you look at it from a more nuance perspective, 1 dev =/= 1 dev 
---
Many people have also mentioned mismanagement or a lack of clear direction or cohesion of ideas, or a terrible line of communication and free will.
---
...so that's the reason for map wide lag spikes. GW2 shit servers made out of plywood and cardboard, and powered by thoughts and prayers simply cannot calculate Steal results.
---
Meanwhile it's pretty hard for me to create a male stripper look, and if I can it's a very limited supply to work with
---
It's a bug. A couple of weeks back it was added as a part of charity event, and devs can't remove it without breaking the game, because there's nobody left in ANet who knows game's code at all.
---
lmao, and what are the GW2 maps if not zones to grind the same boring "dynamic" events that consist of HP sack bosses that get autoattacked to death or groups of mobs that are to be killed, all to grind for currency.
---
After completing the PoF story. For the skyscale you need every season 4 episode.
---
I agree with what most of your saying but I would say that Shadowbringers makes FFXIV trump both GW2 and WoW when it comes to storytelling in both delivery and writing. Most of it was voice acted with some REALLY good voice acting (like Gendry from GoT) as well as excellent camerawork.
---
I'd like to have that too please, if anymore available
---
Anet gives shit Vozt what people want generally
---
I think anyone who has been closely watching can tell you that Anet's problems were not budget-based. At this point they might be.
---
I was ready to say that "well they have less now, when HoT came out they were doing great!" but then I have to remember the cut content from dragons stand, the many problems that took years to properly address. While I'm generally happy with HoT Anet has never been able to deliver a polished finished product that appealed to most of the user base, on time. Usually they hit 2 out of 4 at best.
---
This should give us a little hope, in two eays:
---
1. We've been sad at all the devs leaving, but the truth is we don't know who was good and who was bad. What we do know is what they had wasn't working. So maybe the staff changes and cuts aren't a bad thing.
---
2. Anet still has the resources to push out great content IF they get their shit together. We can hope. They aren't dismally screwed.
---
And here we have necro who depends entirely on his shroud mechanic skill... Does it give anything? Nope. Not like its the core mechanic of the fcking class
---
Mounts are unlocked account wide, so as soon as one character has it all characters do
---
That being said, the griffon isn't cheap, sitting at 250 total gold, plus a set of achievements after finishing the PoF story. So while you can rush for it, it's going to still take some time
---
And the skyscale is a dragon mount that can change elevation and hover in place, but it does have a limit to how high in the air you can get.
---
We were both unaware at the time and just excited to play again. The in game restrictions read of upgrading your account, but also say something about new accounts needing 4 days to be verified. Was holding out hope that the 4 days applied to the F2P accounts, but I guess not. Back to support I go. Thanks for the reply
---
HoT also did a lot of damage to WvW. 
---
WvW is the only reason I still play this game every now and then and before HoT is was great. With HoT came poor skill balance and power creep which was the beginning of the end. On top of that, the devs decided to completely ignore WvW for last 3-4 years. Makes me angry reflecting on how good WvW once was and what it is now.
---
But we literally crave for expansions and many of us buy the priciest versions to support the game. There are many of us who do this and people who do that usually don't spend money on aesthetics just because stuff gets offered. I'm not gonna go spend 10 bucks because the Saga is beginning. 
---
But if they had wanted to sell me a whole expansions for 30 bucks, I would have even bought the special edition f√ºr 80 bucks, including bonuses and 4000 gems - just like they have already did. Not gonna spend money because there's another soulless new map that no one will be on in 3 months.
---
"Gentlemen. A short view back to the past, Niki Lauda told us ‚Äòtake a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.‚Äô"

I laughed that some comments are saying WvW and PvP so that's why Anet can't do so much with their big dev team. And I'm thinking "doesn't Anet have basically no one working on WvW and PvP?"

Thief in general is overloaded.

Shadowstep is a 2x teleport, 2x stunbreak, 1x condi cleanse. 50 sec cd.
---
Ele lightning flash is a 40 sec cd, does not stunbreak, single teleport.
---
Mesmer blink is a stunbreak, teleport, still 2 blinks with 2 stuns is 10 sec longer cd than shadow step, has an effective 30 sec icd on using 2x teleports+stunbreak, and doesn't even cleanse a condition.
---
Same for the heals, all of them fairly low cd with not only strong healing, but either evades/stealth+condi cleanse/endurance regen.
---
you are fucking idiot. go buy more gems. EAnet loves you.
---
Probably most popular because when you solo content, it‚Äôs faster than tanking and healing usually. I enjoy playing healer classes but if I‚Äôm out grinding dailies or farming, I usually prefer DPSing everything.
---
I wonder if it's somehow possible setup SBS 3D utilizing the game's support for Nvidia 3D Vision in order to get proper depth.
---
I don't think support would assist in removing assets of a F2P account, that's the whole point of that particular restriction. You would need to attach a retail key to the f2p account in order to get stuff of it.
---
Havent played since build templates were added. But been creeping on the sub to see if shit changes. The feature i most look forward to and i wish it never came. But hey i got destiny 2 to fill the void never thought i would say that.
---
One the plus side mobile is down and all 5 mmos are up financially.
---
...fair enough, so GW2 is a 1st class race car with a BMW driver behind the wheel.
---
What the hell are you talking about? How is this relevant? This comment chain is about naming. Player character race is literally called Viera, just like it was in all other FF games. Both player subraces come from Viera tribes of the original world that were established in Stormblood's lore and they are all doing quite well. Maybe check your facts before trying to sound smart?
---
It's actually Kappa or KappaHD, not kappa. Get it right. Do I have to teach you everything?

Object permanency is supposed to be a basic human function, fyi. Your hyperbole may be misplaced

I too have left gw2, as a player for destiny 2.
---
They all have daily limit except the charged quartz I believe.

 You can buy provisioner tokens for 30-50s each, generally you shouldn't use more valuable resources on them. At their peak Charged Quartz can go to 1-5g+ each.
---
You have the burden of proof lmao. Imagine being this dense.

You are refuting his claim, therefore you bring the evidence.

This guy sounds unnervingly like me, just slightly more powerful delivery, but his inflections, slight slurring and speech patterns all sound oddly like me.

Are you kidding me? Just last week we beat fa 30 v 60 in fights. Our ppt was the reason why we lost. They kept camping SMC. Even yesterday YB 20 v 10 pugs outside SMC they tried spawn camping us and that failed so after the pugs wiped them. FC STRM have been the most cowardly guild I've seen though so i will stand by my point. In my time of roaming / scouting the only time I've seen tags run into towers / keeps is when we're getting 2 v 1 (by 2 server blobs so that's usually a 4 v 1 server wise). But then again it's not like we have much tags anyway. Our pugmanders are meh and sometimes defend and at most they get is about 10 people. The ones we actually follow do great fights. Esp against BoB guild. When we were roaming they hit bay. 10 v 30 they'll bully. But we managed to wipe them at bay no siege just strat and proper pushes. No voice involved too. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
SoS/FA/YB roamers are terrible though 70% of the time it's a pew pew / one shot build and your guarenteed to get ganked. They have a 6th sense of sensing one your about to down one of their kind and bam at least 3-5 others on you.

Diablo 2: LOD and Guild Wars 1 were/ are great!

[We know that pre-layoffs, Anet had on the order of 400 employees total.](https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804)  This number is a bit higher than the figures I recall hearing earlier for headcount at Anet (~300), but I don't have sources for that.  Given that we know Anet was hiring up until the layoffs however, the smaller figure for the active team at Anet makes sense.  We were told that at the time of the layoffs, every other internal project that wasn't Gw2 was axed, and that approximately 200 were laid off.  So now we're at a 200 employee count for GW2 to run the game, except we need to carve a chunk out for the ops teams and senior management, let's say 50 (probably on the lower side).  Take off another 25 people to work on non gw2 shit (because anet still needs to keep exploring new game concepts), and we're at a team of 125 for GW2.
---
So yeah, GW2 doesn't have an industry standard team.  And if the rumors surrounding the layoff were true, it probably was even fewer people actually working on the game.

They were communicating with us a few years ago as well. They had this vote system via in game mail that I thought was neat. 
---
Honestly though, I expect absolutely nothing from Anet. The WvW community is either gone or completely despises Anet.
---
Just curious, why all the sudden after Q3 2018 the revenue goes down that much?
---
Who would bot boosters?
---
It's a cool idea, but didn't fit in any other map. I liked the mechanics of it, but it's such a tiny map that I never return to that as a mastery, it's fairly forgettable.
---
Things like using the skimmer to go over quicksand when in the desert, or bounce mushrooms while in the jungle, feel better overall to me because it's applied to several maps in a region, so I hope these new ones are throughout the shiverpeaks.
---
More specifically, the allocation of resources.  
---
Most of their developers are assigned to work on the living world maps and story instances. If you look purely at the detail, the work involved in these releases, it is impressive.  
---
The problem is the vast amount of resources they expend on this does not translate well into gameplay value. It's pretty to look at, to experience a single time, and that's it.  
---
They simply do not have enough people dedicated to substantive content.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Spam spam spam. Love the gameplay, but every skill has 5 conditions/boons and there are a zillion skills/builds so it‚Äôs tough to have any idea what‚Äôs going on.
---
A quick guess. It's probably after the anniversary announcement that LWS5 will be after LWS4 and there would be no expansion.
---
If there‚Äôs a team working on WvW they should be fired because they have done absolutely nothing for years.
---
You can have all of those effects more effectively with other classes. But it is true that if some other class had thief's skill it would be super op.
---
daily craft one have no limit either, i know that its probably a waste to use it for provisioner token, but I'm one of those lazy people :p
---
The thing I found surprising is that people don't realize this after the end of Season 3.
---
Speaking as that guy who charges quartz crystals every other day and had to get Customer Support to refund almost 100 lumps of mithrillium and globs of elder spirit residue prepared after ArenaNet announced the resumption of Legendary Weapons (Recap for those out of the loop: The Heart of Thorns Legendaries after Chuka &amp; Chumpawat had a different paradigm for consuming Mithril and Elder Wood compared to the original 4)
---
I‚Äôm wondering how well build templates have sold. Generally when something hot enters the gem store gold to gem prices sky rocket. I saw no increase with build templates.

What do you want to buy that they aren't specifically selling?

so is that implying that all millennials are thieves or all thieves are millennials?

The way I see it, the game currently caters to players who like new maps and solo story instances and this subreddit is demanding it cater to *their* style instead.

Yep, both are definitely covering more regions than gw2, Guild Wars' lack of Korean version is particularly notable.

you have my curiosity aswell
---
I have been playing for more than 4 years. This game has way too much content to be completed.
---
Probably never. :(  
---
They've made it clear they're not willing to push changes to the game engine required.
---
This sounds like elite specs.
---
GW2 has only a chinese version, and although we haven't heard much about it, it reportedly hasn't ever fared that well.  We certainly haven't seen features added to the game tailored for the chinese market.
---
Every single thing they do, they insist in re-inventing from scratch, claiming it's some big robust thing they can reuse forever, and then never use it ever again.
---
I am jealous D:
---
That's exactly what was said? After you finish all the achievements and collections what do you still do LW maps for?
---
New ways to combine existing abilities...you mean like combo fields? Those things which used to be important and one of the more interesting things about the combat system which are now mostly irrelevant outside of the stealth fields?! Imo fractals and the infusion system should/could be how we add a bit of vertical progression and personality to our characters and gear but right now its kind of boring and lame, you get the +9ar+5 stat infusions for whatever stat you want which can be done entirely through gold now and then you're done and never touch it again.....woohoo....
---
THIS. Pretty much any major software product out there suffers from the same issue, from Oracle to operating systems. No one makes money off of refactoring old code, everyone makes money off selling updates with new features. End result, miles of crap legacy code that no one knows or understands and everyone is afraid to break. Eventually you need a clean break and to start over with a new product, taking the lessons you learned from the old one to make something better or be crushed by your own weight. Some games can get away with this easily with sequels every few years, some take longer, and some, never at all and eventually they just go to the graveyard. Apple went through a major overhaul from old MacOS to OS X. Windows has tried to do this time and time again with each iteration but they need their legacy compatibility to not lose their base.
---
Anyway, it's unlikely it will ever happen with GW2. They'll just move on to GW3, something else entirely, or fold up shop. But stay strong, EQ1 and UO are _still_ running and there are plenty of MUDs still kicking it after 20-30 years.

---
Be fair now, much of the coding practices 'at the time' could very well have been the best known, at that time. Improvements in coding techniques happen over time as well and are built on what developers did in the past with the tools available to them at the time.
---
Just build your own home instance / loot the from someone else and have some storage expanders, then you will always have a stack spare of stuff
---
But Aion has all but failed in the West and there are fewer people who play these games in the West. This is a complete non-argument. It's not like the same demographic or groups of people are competing here. Once you go into china and korea you get far more players than the west.

One week into project: "I don't know why this doesn't work! Oh well, fuck it."
---
One week *left* in project: "I don't know why this *does* work...oh well, fuck it."
---
don't want a code  I want my Quiznos back
---
And possibly because there was no living story release in Q4 2018.
---
That doggo looks a bit like Fenrir/Garm in Hellblade: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8YDqw
---
Yep, this. And with so much put into LWS1, GW2 story from a newer player perspective is like if FFXIV made HW inaccessible and you had to get it from a cutscene, 1.0 style.
---
&gt; What was actually going on with GW2 in all these years? 
---
The question is how easy is it to add or modify content?  
---
I remember devs said before that dungeons are very hard/impossible to modify without breaking other stuff and thus were left alone, most likely forever.  
---
Maybe its very hard to create new content and takes alot more time than other MMO games. Perhaps due to the engine or the way the core was created. Or the design pipeline could have inefficiency where several concepts have to be debated for weeks before being unanimously approved to be added.  
---
Well, unless the devs talk about all the reasons why, we can all just speculate.
---
Yes, I think I know what that is.  Fleshing out more ways to play is a great way to breathe new life into old, static content, and give existing long-term players new ways to enhance their play-style.
---
Example.  I just like the flamethrower.  I have figured out through build guides and so on what works well for me.  Lots of AOE, pretty survivable, move quickly.  Most importantly, FIRE EVERYWHERE!   I've tried builds that are "viable" but this is like BiS for WoW - it limits each class to a small set of what's available.   Most people don't need to be the best, but they do want to feel powerful and effective - and to feel there's some reward to their overcoming challenges.  Horizontal progression in gameplay styles is one way of doing that.
---
stop it, or else I'll complain to HR for you being ageist :(
---
Im just shocked with ppl like you and your attitude. This is obviously an artistic "meme" of couple walking, where guy is looking at the "better looking" chick. And GW2 is definitely better looking than WOW. So, FYI, i do know what im posting, but i see that similarities between WOW refugees in GW2 and the refugees in FFXIV that you obviously can't see. Im sorry if I've offended you, or anybody else, but (again) FYI I've been playing FFXIV as well before. Cheers mate.
---
[removed]
---
The Ogre Wars meta event still will routinely stall out, and that's in a core/base game map.
---
I don't play games for their story..which is your entire reasoning for thinking GW2 is better. At least in WoW and FF I know they have a plan and they lay it out. I know we will get new content in WoW and FF at certain dates. Who knows what the fuck were getting in GW2 and when we are getting it. The last time they even looked at WvW was years ago. They throw us a bone here and there to maybe hope we will stick around..but WvW is dead.
---
This is not horizontal progression. It's a mastery that straight up buffs your power. Doesn't even seem like a fun mechanic.
---
I don't think they know what to do with masteries anymore.
---
It‚Äôs trash developers making a garbage game, bad management and fake news marketing.
---
Funnily enough the reason we have the system we currently have was that they didn't want there to be a big bloat of buffs/debuffs.
---
it's just 200g, that's nothing. change it for some gems and gift smth to your main acc (if that works)
---
I still find it absurd how poorly the game runs compared to other more intensive ones
---
As a Dota 2 player it tilts me even more because I'm hearing this argument over and over
---
It's Rudolf the Rednose Reindeer but for celebrating christmas in hell.
---
Let's see how it plays out. I was soooo so hyped before they mentioned this moronic map gating.
---
Couldn't it be a nice addition to the whole game instead just a new flashy chunk of it???
---
Where are combat skills for gliding from Bloodstone Fen? Development was wasted yet again, because you guys wished to create one, flashy, DAMNED gimmick which I am using nowadays anyway. Cool right? You know why? Because there is a skill SPAM daily quest without any rotation. That's where my "mastery of gliding" went. To spam 3-4 3-4 over and over everyday, without any meaningful effect because map is either dead or people just don't give a damn to glide along while being useful (1 bloodstone ruby yeeeeey...).
---
Where are lacking mount skills (2-5, 9-0)? 
---
Why there is no system for mounted combat? 
---
Why we get the same systems with different animations? 
---
Why templates were blatantly monetized? We are sitting on Central Tyria Mastery Points. Couldn't it be a nice spin to UNLOCK THE FEATURE WITHIN THE GAME with systems THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE?
---
Why we have no DPS meter? Same as with templates. This could be Pact Commander Mastery tier EASY.
---
O_O Anet, you have a success in front of you! Lean down, and pick it up already.. :/
---
Poison and weakness are on opposite ends of the list. Number of allies affected is on there twice. Range is on there twice, but *with differing distances*.
---
If you're going to use sources/quotes then you should actually use them instead of choosing numbers that intentionally mislead your audience.
---
1. In 2012, your quote says they moved up to 220-225 people. Still less than GW2's 270 at the time, but far more than the 140 you put in the graphic.
---
2. In 2015 you use the 225 figure instead of 225 + 50% (330 ish).
---
3. Your figure for WoW in 2017 says 260 and indicates the number is for 2016, not 2017.
---
\#1 Would have actually helped prove your point, since WoW's number was smaller.
---
\#2 Gives the appearance that you're trying to intentionally deceive your audience and hurts your credibility.
---
\#3 Similar to \#2, you lose credibility because you're fabricating numbers out of thin air.
---
What. Season 2 had amazing encounters and story. Maybe the execution hasn't aged well, but it was way better than the angsty Braham stuff we've been dealing with.
---
It‚Äôs either A: Mismanagement
---
Or B: They were working on other things such as a mobile game or anything else, all of which was subsequently cancelled due to the layoffs, which is why they have a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù focus on gw2
---
However, if B is the case (which I‚Äôm sure it is) this renewed focus is also mismanaged considering there‚Äôs no word on fractals, raids and most of PvP and WvW. While I do play mostly pve and open world, living world isn‚Äôt everything
---
&gt; GuildWars3
---
Any rumors you heard about GW3 are completely unfounded. This community has a very poor grasp on storytelling basics, like what an antagonist is, and how resolution works.
---
Guild Wars 2 has 6 antagonists (the elder dragons). The framework for these 6 antagonists goes all the way back to Guild Wars 1, as far back as 2006. ANet has set up these 6 antagonists, and for the story of GW2 to reach a resolution they have to be dealt with. Whether that means killing them, converting them, absorbing them, cosmically deleting them, etc doesn't really matter. One way or another all six have to be dealt with.
---
One was defeated when GW2 launched in 2012, and two others since then. That means there's 3 left. They have to be dealt with before GW2's story is done being told. ANet isn't going to cut off GW2 and start a brand new game. This just isn't going to happen.
---
If GW2 follows the same cadence it has had in the past, it'll take another decade to finish all 6 antagonists. They've hinted in the past about dealing with two antagonists at once, and it's certainly possible we do a hat trick and defeat the remaining three all at once, but this seems unlikely. However, if we do defeat 2 or 3 at the same time that shortens how much time is remaining in GW2's story.
---
GW2 is profitable and being actively developed. Whether it takes a decade to finish or not is just something we'll have to wait and see. But there is no indication that GW2 will shutdown in the next year or two, so you have plenty of time to get in and play. New content is coming out on a regular basis, with the next bit of free content coming out in 6 days.
---
really wish I could give Anet some money for a good build swapping system.  Oh well, I'll just keep using the multiple characters I bought years ago instead.
---
Its 5/7
---
Okay then. Thank you for clarifying
---
Gw2 not having that is the number 1 reason i play it.
---
You're so brave!
---
Dont get me started on ESO performance, as low as 30fps in cities with low distance view / lowest particles / medium shadows on a ryzen3600/2060super.
---
Makes sense.  I really don't know what the market looks like (who does?) so I don't know if many/most people want to have alts or hate alts or whatever else.  I love alts, but I also love having a "main" I can focus on.  Ultimately, the grind to "best" in GW2 is IMO brutal.  How long do you think it would take to go from yellow gear (no idea what that's called) to whatever "max" gear is?  (without a guild to help you)
---
That was one big appeal of Arena PvP in WoW. You could see what buffs they had and had the ability to make a legit decision based on that.
---
I think it just goes to whatever recent character you were playing. In my case, it went to my WvW Herald. He does use Nevermore, but it‚Äôs actually a transmuted Bo.
---
Or in the case of condi deadeye you can just spam rifle (while kneeling) or pistol 2 and watch them slowly die unable to reach you.
---
Yet rock, paper, scissor mastery and strike missions made it into the game. I can‚Äôt imagine what stuff they have discarded.
---
i thought they were all more inspired by Leshy's than wendigos
---
Complete opposite, they had to work off of the old codebase which was full of spaghetti code, and to this day it still limits what the devs can do
---
Thanks for the info. Didnt know that movie exist. Cant wait to pirate it.
---
&gt;Vision needed 250 of everything in LWS4
---
Almost. Skyscale needed 250 of each. Vision needed skyscale done, plus 100 of each, plus a bunch more for some maps such as Kralk Ore for Ep. 1 weapons and Branded Mass for Ep. 5 weapons.
---
There were also some creatures called [Berserker Wendigo](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Berserking_Wendigo) in Guild Wars Eye of the Norht through they reassembled a cross between a Minotaur and a Grawl.
---
It's funny how the skill was originally intended to be a cool gimmick where you steal utility skills from enemies and now it's used mainly for buffs/debuffs and teleportation.
---
Definitely makes my rifle thief satisfying to use in PvP.
---
Contrary to what some people think, but this reddit isnt here for selfpreening with zerovalue posts. This isnt instagram or twitter.
---
While I understand that this kind of "look at my accomplishment" is part of playing an mmorpg for most people, theres the official forums for it and ofc your guild. If you dont have one, then get one.
---
Im sick of having to scroll through "look I made my first map completion/screenshot/legendary" posts every day. Of people I dont care about, Ive never seen before and will never see again.
---
Map completion isnt some kind of great accomplishment like a new record (yes, there are record runs on map completion) or worlds first. But even those new record posts at least offer \*VALUE\*. Not just a stupid title and screenshot.
---
&gt;she said that it was kinda boring to just spam the same attack button, and I just had no idea what to say - she of course said that she hopes that it gets better over time
---
another victim of new player experience patch
---
also you can't make someone like something
---
&gt;The thing I found surprising is that people don't realize this after the end of Season 3.
---
If you did Aurora, you probably should have realized, but many people didn't
---
ANET delivering expansion quality with LW was a lie. This tuesday we will get just another LW episode and nothing more.
---
ANET "refocused on GW2" since february was a lie. We are playing a maintenance mode game  + some living world episodes made by 10 devs.
---
Either they are working at something new or working at ANET is a long/payed holiday.
---
yes great idea just break up and get a new one in gw2
---
It is because of Aion and Blade and Soul gets their revenue in Korea. 
---
If we look earning by region, it is 24,452 for the whole NA/EU region. We know that 15,138 of that is from Guild Wars 2, so that left 9k for Aion, Blade &amp; Soul and Lineage 2 combined.
---
The Ancient Magus' Bride. One my favorite and best animes.
---
i never counted that cuz too me it was a Grawl reskin though nice one remembering about it hahaha.
---
Oh so it's not just me.
---
Mounts killed it for me.
---
Wait you think it takes to long to get max gear?  I'm taking max gear to mean ascended because that has the best stats (legendary has same stats, but can also stat swap).  I have like, 30 full sets of max gear, and I have the currencies built up to buy a bunch more.  My story isn't rare among raiders. Most of that is from fractals and raids (end game instanced pve content).  So my view point is that its very fast to get max gear, so end game progression is getting more sets for more specific builds.  
---
Your saying you think its too slow to get max gear? It depends a lot on what you play. Your first set is of course your slowest.
---
Another mass firing of 7 poeple?
---
So what I'm hearing is...thief is a good class?
---
So....the official forums then? :P
---
Actually, these problems are the same, and have a reasonable explanation: the vigor is to all allies within that range, as is the boon rip, but at an even broader range.
---
True but this PSA likely wasn't targeted at them anyway and my comment certainly wasn't targeted at them.  I'm directing it at those who had done Aurora and whined about map currencies for Skyscale and Vision.
---
I wish it was the opposite: start with something useful and then marginally upgrade it through traits. Otherwise it just feels like it‚Äôs useless unless you heavily modify it and it forces you to use very specific traits if you want to use those select options.
---
I might be alone on this but I find the graphics and the assets used in the new content to be super bland and repetitive. Itms not even that impressive looking.
---
Saved me the hassle of writing this the next time i see this arguement.
---
I recently found a ghostly spineguard and am confused. Why is that thing so pricey? I see them listed for 133 gold but that cant be right. Theres also people offering to instabuy for 12g. What am I supposed to do with this? Do people actually buy at 133g?
---
they mail it to your most recently played character. i got one for my weekly keyfarmer.
---
rekt.
---
I tried to play wow but it was hella boring. The graphics are trash even the new one. Design of armor/weapon e.t.c are nothing compare to gw2. For me, Gw2 are far superior. People are probably playing wow because it was their first mmo. Want to feel nostalgic
---
... or Guild Wars 1. There were basic things like "protects from x damage" but most enhancements, curses, shouts, boons, etc. were all unique effects that you had to pay special attention to. Spiteful Spirit, for example, was an AoE curse that made all surrounding enemies take damage every attack or spell cast, instantly forcing groups to scatter. We lost all of that uniqueness in this game to "applies weak" "applies regen and stability", etc. which was a big reason I took so long to come back and get into the 2nd game.
---
Oh, well it would have been a nice detail‚Ä¶
---
Take a look at it‚Äôs [wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ghostly_Spineguard) and [the tp information](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/46445-Ghostly-Spineguard). These two webpages should be the first things you check when selling a weird item like this. There is no right answer to what to do since no one can perfectly predict how the tp will behave. But with these 2 websites, you can make a informed guess as what is best to do.
---
The points to notice are that it is a non wardrobe skin. This means it is useless for gear, but for either looks or salvaging. I guess the [skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ghostly_Spineguard_(skin)) is literally invisible (?) and there are other [stat combos](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/tp/search?name=Ghostly%20spineguard%20) that are much more common to drop. 
---
I can‚Äôt explain why your specific gear is super expensive, so your guess is as good as mine. But, from the second link, you can see supply is horrendously low, and demand is low as well. There has been none bought or sold recently, and only 1 bid was made.
---
Using this information, it is up to you to make a decision. Do you list it for 300 gold and pray some random will buy it? Do you sell it at a much lower price to try to sell it quick? If so how low? Is it even worth trying? This is the fun of ‚Äúplaying the tp‚Äù. It‚Äôs like smart gambling.
---
&gt; what I'm asking is if it's ever worth a full 800 gems for one characters worth of gifts  
---
Wasn't really talking about OP but ok...
---
Thieves are the definition of one-trick-pony, typically spamming a single weapon skill running full signets. It's literally a meme. If that's overloaded, I don't know what to tell ya. Nobody wants ten passives on their Steal, but the trait lines are gummed up by worthless condi dps, compulsory crit dps, and the mess we see above. Every single Thief utility skill has a half minute cooldown or more. Between Weapons, Traits, and Skills, Thieves have almost no Condi Removal or CC. They're only good for damage. It's almost tragic.
---
That‚Äôs literally the context to the content you replied to
---
&gt; Both of them are horrible at telling story.
---
Another day, another person compares GW2 to a game they never played.
---
In "The Ritual" that thing was a Jotun. But yeah, i liked the movie.
---
Am I late? I would like a code as well please if you have any left :)
---
We don't know, but you can leave your request [here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/348/gemstore-requests-new-items-items-offered-again/p69)
---
Branded Skyscale is available only as a mount pack for 2000 gems.
---
This build is fun but at any serious level of PvP it will struggle. It is really squishy due to the lack stability and mobility (nowadays you need both worm and spectral walk), wells are easily avoidable, and Lich Form is just like a "I am a big training dummy, kill me pls" for any expierenced player.
---
The video by itself is good tho. Keep it up!
---
I had over 30 lying around from god knows what project that I abandoned
---
or maybe it was just creating them for some reason, idk
---
You also still have the option of just accepting the time gate and making them yourself while still playing how you like; it's not like making one doesn't take longer than 5 minutes.  Heck if you've got a kitted out home instance all you have to do is make sure you take 25 with you per day when you raid it.
---
But if you decide to buy it, you are the one that made that choice, not anet, and we the players were the ones that set the price.
---
There's nothing wrong with criticizing the skyscale for its timegates.  But you're just entitled if you're blaming anet for offering a skip method that your fellow players have priced so high.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Piece_of_Skyscale_Food
---
i mean in pvp stolen items are incredibly powerful
---
Potassium
---
Glenna did quite a lot tho, intel, bombing gates, selling us cool skins.
---
Some of the reasons items like this can become very expensive is because either
---
* There is a very high demand of it
---
* There is an extremely low (or non-existent) drop rate or it
---
For this kind of gear I would say it's probably the other 2nd one: some items no longer drop in-game so the number of this very specific item (same chat code) is either constant or decreasing so for some people they can become kind of relics (just like it would work IRL for some limited edition of a product or a never opened box/packet of a figurine/comics/etc) so that would be why the price of such a basic item could go up.
---
the preview window always looks different than your actual in game model.
---
resdahe or gw2hook can help with sharpening if anti aliasing doesn't get you what you want.
---
I would like a code please.
---
Thx!
---
Spend some time in Nazjatar or Mechagon, before you piss all over the GW2 maps.
---
There's fucking nothing to them. And those are the only two zones WoW has gotten over the past year.
---
I have thousands of hours in all 3 games.
---
But those are free maps, not unlockeables.
---
Designing more handholding mechanics to make ktrainers able to escape PvP situations even better, probably ones that can sell skins like mounts.
---
Hm I did it so much time ago that I honestly forgot. I remember the grinding but it may has been for skyscale instead.
---
Well that's on you. If you don't like what they give you it probably isn't gonna change. You simply aren't the focus of the development team. If you get anything at all.
---
Anet has been trying a lot of different content delivery systems. And that's probably not good for the community in the end. But content wise, anet has delivered a comparable amount of content to the other games, they just don't have a consistent structure, and that scares people.
---
Yeah, normal. The past thing serms a lille wrong for me.
---
Mismanagement is one thing. Before launch, I was hyped by the game after seeing their manifesto. It looked like they knew they were doing. Couple years later I saw an interview with Colin, during which he said that the manifesto was a spontaneous thing, just a couple devs recording random thoughts about what they want to achieve. I was stunned.
---
Looking back at their every decision actually makes sense now. GW2 was not a carefully planed game, it was (and is) a huge experiment. Which in my opinion sucks. Imagine what they could have done if they had a clear vision.
---
At this point, id ve happy if they did this, got 750+ chilis just chillin in my bank
---
The main trouble with other strategies is that players can feel overwhelmed like they need to do everything in every map. The player base could also spread too thin.
---
It's a hard thing to balance out... How do you keep them engaging, but not grindy... Worthwhile but not a chore.
---
The quality of the writing is subjective. The delivery is point. Comparing it to ESO as it's the only one I have played doesn't give enough credit. ESOs Main focus is on story. They use most of their time on developing the story.
---
Yeah I never got to experience the original kessex kills. I really dislike how parts of the map look like a junkyard.
---
I feel confused alright
---
They must not know 90% of the playerbase has player model set to lowest  :')
---
Having played through shadowbringers it really isn't that great for delivery. It uses the same format as ever with most scenes being just text bubbles between you and whoever you are talking to. With the occasional scene of voiced dialogue. The quality of the writing is pretty much up to personal taste.
---
They didn't add them to the maps that much. They said it would be this wonderful new thing then pretty much scrapped them on the next LS map. Beetle doors could be scattered around the maps more (especially if they added fun underground race tracks , just an idea, i have many more) but it seems like it was just a gimmick.
---
It depends on how easy it is to get a certain currency. Istan map required alot because it was easy to farm.
---
Thank you!
---
Ofc they do because ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are not a monolith. There are a myriad of different opinions possessed by a plethora of different, individual people. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to make everyone happy, so yes, someone will always complain 99.999% of the time
---
Oh, please no! That could go horribly wrong!!!
---
It can be if dirt paths weave in and out drifting around tree OR had beetle doors that led to dipping underground for shortcuts or zoom zoom tracks. It's all about how you lay it out. Any map could be revisited for a massive underground beetle track of not 1 but many races. I'm sure you could ask any guild hall beetle track architect for some tips! :)
---
And Greedfall creatures too !
---
Stockholm Syndrome: The Anime

World of Warcraft has almost the same creature in the woods of an Alliance map in BFa.
---
Did this really need to be put on the wiki..... for the love of pete.....
---
XD
---
At yes. The only feedback thread they listen to.
---
Especially when  you are mesmer vs thief and they land steal, vonsume plasma and get every boon in the game.
---
I get this reference
---
valuable meaning...?  they're account bound, aren't they?
---
10/10 quote. Less buttons more?
---
Correct, I have enough empyreal fragments to build a house, a working graphing calculator, or a second, bigger house.
---
I have heard this before, and I have no reson to doubt it. It just seems insane to me. South Korea has a smaller population than the UK, or Germany. The amount of the population that plays, or spends a lot on MMORPG's must be insane considering how many MMORPG's make most of their income from Korea.
---
Is there in report, any info about player base size? Or can i assume that 12mega divided by game price is amount of new players?
---
I work in the feature film industry, and if games are similar, tons of people are not credited, and credits are very dependent on the people in charge. There have been movies that I fully expected to get a credit on, but didn‚Äôt, and others I barely helped on, but received a credit. There was a recent story about how Rockstar wouldn‚Äôt credit anyone who left the company before a game shipped, no matter how long they were involved in it.
---
I've always preferred d/p
---
(if you were seriously asking, those are helicopters from an event)
---
&gt;0% of what is left goes to the marketing budget.
---
What marketing do you mean lul.
---
It even follows me here.
---
its always been my pet theory that all games make your new "young" characters look grainy and pixelated or low quality with low level gear, and as you level up to cap, you get better looking gear, shiny and accomplished in appearance.
---
Well.. they didnt move and no animation etc.
---
Took me some time to figure out wtf that is.
---
Elias can be a little creepy, but once you get to know him he can be a real friend.
---
Have a look at your inbox, I've sent you a PM.
---
taking damage is subjective, you have two heal on hit traits
---
I would also like a code, if you have extras.
---
I spelled it out for you a million times.
---
The game has a shitty reward system.
---
The game lacks content which makes earning the rewards even worse.
---
You just like to cover your ears and go lalala because you can‚Äôt stand to see your beloved MMO criticized.
---
Target: *random dodge in the middle of nowhere*
---
Yes, you shouting things, doesn't make them true. First, you would actually need an argument that supports your theory. That's what we were discussing in the beginning by the way. Our disagreement about the reward structure. Which you then derailed with your ramblings about lack of content. Which is not the same discussion. At least to reasonable people.
---
Although, what do I expect from someone who actually wastes his time bitching and whining on a gaming forum about a game he doesn't like to play.
---
you can buy legendaries for gems in the chinese version lol
---
On paper this works but because we have sites like metabattle, everybody will just copy and paste the build as their new meta, and all thieves will be built like that until either everybody plays a thief because it‚Äôs supposedly OP now, or Anet decides to nerf it.
---
You play the content to get the rewards. Getting rewards isnt fun when you dont have a variety of content to choose from.
---
If the game is so fun to play why are YOU wasting your time on the forums instead of playing it?
---
Scourge and Spellbreaker, probably.
---
Oof Anet are celestial gear
---
i think it's the other way around
---
&gt; People are probably playing wow because it was their first mmo. Want to feel nostalgic
---
TBF That's the only reason I'm still playing GW2 too, because it's in the Guild Wars universe. Most of the time I'm bored while playing and just want to get the story over with so I can move back to other games. I don't even bother with the maps or skins anymore, since they're just a grind (remember how they said they didn't want grind in GW2?)
---
thats the joke
---
&gt; Their best bet in the long run is STOP 95% of development for GW1
---
What development for GW1?
---
They had a great game and they abandoned it, leaving updating it to  two passionate developers in their free time. That's right. The only updates it got after GW2 was released was done by people on their own time.
---
Actually I think if they want to make games they should just split them up. Split up the casual PvE MMO, the "competitive" PvP game, and the large scale PvP WvWvW game. Then they can focus on these individually without having PvE updates break a PvP mode.
---
The Secret World MMO has all kinds of creatures from folklore like this in it. :D
---
Know if there's gonna be any discounts for the expansions?
---
r/woooosh
---
Came here to mention Secret World. 
---
Here's TSW's [Wendigo](https://secretworld.fandom.com/wiki/Wendigo).
---
Ok but what I like to know is does it work the other way around?
---
So for example If I am "attuned" to Valor, I am stronger against Vigilance - ok!

But will I be **weaker** to Resilience? (do less dmg, take more dmg?)
---
And what happens when I pick up two different essences? overide? collect all? 
---
Can I be the imba-super-uber- all three essence guy?
---
It is FACTUALLY a FF armor set are you all fucking high or something?   
---
Is it similar? Sure, can be I guess if you don't know a lot about armor design. Is it THAT armor and can it appear in both games? No it fucking isn't and that would be fucking plagarism if it did.   
---
Have fun commenting all you want about it fam but don't pretend like it's a gw2 character when it's a FACT that it's a FF meme and it will never ever represent a GW2 character because that's not what the artist fucking drew.   
---
You don't get to make up your own little version of reality and expect others to not call you out on it.

Cheers, enjoy your "100% gw2 desert based armor" (then proceed to link the lumi set from HoT) - ayy lmao on both, acquire eyes

Gw2 open world takes a lot more work to accomplish for a lot more reason then having meta events. For starters events might be equivalent to quests in function but they more definitely take a lot more work to make from a development point of view. In your typical quest the quest giver is a static npc. Only work that goes into making them is the model / textures, an idle animation, quest text and scripted objectives. Dynamic events include all that but way more. The quest giver more often then not accompanies you, or gets involved in the quest, hence it requires walking / running / attack animations and while obviously a lot of these are used it still requires a lot more testing, and tuning if they have non standard size / armor set etc.. But beyond that than the devs need to set way points on where the npc is going to go, they have to script whatever happens along the way. Set spawn points and take the time to place them in such a way that they dont appear out of nothing but rather seem like they're storming from behind trees or hills or whatever cover the terrain can give to maintain the immersion. Some dynamic events also involve custom animations, things like npc attacking a message to raven and getting it to fly away etc.. then there is balancing. they have to make sure that npcs alone cant beat the event without player interaction but on the other side they have to at least be useful to some degree else whats the point? to achieve that takes design effort. All this also makes for a lot more testing. While with quest all you need to check is if quest text is properly delivered, that objectives are properly assigned and that whatever task you're given actually gives / sets proper states when completed with dynamic events, all the above has to be tested as well. 
---
But thats not all, anet tend to introduce mechanics with their map launches. Either some new movement mechanic like thermal propulsion or oakheart's reach or even new activities like say the brandstone impact site mining in domain of istan. Every map had something new that most likely required engine changes. Than you have a lot of ancinellary content too, collections hidden throughout the map, races, vista, pois... they may not take a lot of work to place but they do take a lot of work to design and thats also not including that sometimes anet changes them just a little bit to give them a less repetitive flavor such as changing a race to include objectives within it too such as delivering items etc.. It may seem something small to the player but that functionality needs to be developed and integrated into whatever systems handles racing to work. Anet also tends to hide Easter eggs so to speak like say there is a bunny in thunderhead keeps, just a regular fauna non aggressive bunny, that runs away when you approach him and if you keep chasing him, it will run all the way down the mountain where its fun, until if you chase it long enough it will go inside a bush and out comes a seriously violent jackalope. Talking of fauna Anet also like to put quite  a large variety of it and not only that but rather then give it one single idle animation like most games do they tend to put numerous ones that alternate at random making the fauma feel more alive. 
---
Something else that they tend to do is include a lot of variety in their maps and that obviously takes a lot of work. In other games when you get a new map especially outside of an expansion that map is likely to have the same theme through out. If its swampy it will be all swampy etc.. That helps cut down development time as you only need to worry about one art style and you an also reuse assets since all the map has the same feel. Anet tend to put variety. Like Thunderhead peak is probably an extreme example of this. You have the icey biome outside, you have the dwarven architecture inside the complex thats 1/2 the map, you have the molten lava environments in the ruin catacombs, you have the crystalline domain in glint's lair and finally you have the branded cave aesthetic of the final fight. All that packed in one release!
---
Now ofcourse I get your point that most of this isnt exactly playable content but obviously they still need to make it and it still takes time to do.
---
Man, you got a build for me as a druid?

Wow this subreddit is toxic... it‚Äôs just an announcement and already so much hate without seeing how it will actually look.
---
I‚Äôm exited to try this new system anyway and hope other less hateful people won‚Äôt be pushed away from here by all these bitter reactions.
---
Also GW1 servers cost almost nothing when we are at that - link to reddit dev comment needed
---
Had Anet rolled with the generic MMO content release formula from day 1, GW2 might've been a true competitor for WoW.
---
Instead they just had to be special..
---
I'm not talking about the Guild Bank but the Treasury, which is only used to deposite materials for available Guild Upgrades.
---
Users on Reddit and the official forums were defending that release policy as "the best idea ever!" and even back then more longtime thinking players questioned the future of such a system.
---
That's the problem if your official canals only enforce positive feedback loops...
---
Some of those animations are really disturbing if you pay attention. 
---
Try killing a rabbit with shock for example. =S
---
Except when the sub is optional, and mostly for convenience, as it is in the case of ESO. ESO, you just buy the game once, have access to the base game (which has easily hundreds, maybe even a thousand or so hours worth of content, without touching group content), and maybe even the expansions.
---
As far as content is concerned, ESO's sub only gives you cheap access to all current and future DLC for the duration of the sub, most of which add at most 10 or so hours worth of quest content, each.
---
I'm worried that devs are more concerned with extending playtime, than with making it fun to play.

Note that Might and Fury appear separately and that when they are given as part of the Fire for Effect trait, the bottom two, they are listed as 5 targets instead of 10.

The Fire for Effect boons should also be on the Stolen Skill.

I'll just buy the home node, and I'll have way more than 250 whenever a future skyskale or collection comes.

I better comparison would be with ESO, since the whole game is voiced acted even more so than GW2. I wonder how many devs they have in comparison, they seem to pump out a bit. |
---
So far I've gotten the email targeted at my main (first email) that I used to play all the time but not so much recently (2,8k hours), my 2nd guard (41 hours) and my ranger (231 hours) that I played recently (second and third emails). I'm pretty sure they choose a point in time and go with recently played characters from that particular point.

ah i do remember that appealing the leshen with a ritual quest from the witcher 3, good times!

well ofcourse lol the secret world revolves around that kind of monsters :D

Its 2019. Every normal company uses AI to create new maps and items. Bots does it. And people can focus on doing new playable content. Meantime in ArenaNet doing new items and maps consumes all their resources...

I can concur this as well...

F2P cannot gem-gold exchange, that's correct.

Settings have little to do with previews afaik. Also most skins look better in a real environment, 
---
Make sure your gpu isn‚Äôt trying to override the game settings either. ‚ÄúLet the application decide‚Äù is best imo. Looks weird if it‚Äôs trying to force its own antialiasing onto the game. Also check if your monitor and game are the highest possible refresh rate.

Other than that gw2hook would be another possible solution.

BnS is the biggest whale fiesta NCsoft has ever produced , also BnS is available world wide .

These games are dead in na/eu but it's pretty alive in asia. They like p2w games.
---
Ye... no.
---
Gw2 pumps out more open world maps than the other 2.
---
I came to reddit expecting people to be as excited as I am for this mastery. :{ I am excited to grind again. But I guess we all just wanted an expansion and completely free build/equipment templates.
---
Well done.
---
To make the enemy also enter combat, so they do not hop on a mount and run away.
---
It is always better to play sometimes for a bit and build up storage than need to grind it in single week constantly.
---
It would have been worse if each skill had individual effects, tho.
---
These games are dead in na/eu but it's pretty alive in asia. They like p2w games. Also their market is bigger than ours. And that's why in recent years we seen a lot of p2w mmorpg's. For us it may be weird why companies do such a bad games. And why over time they destroy all of them with p2w. Its simple. All these games were made mainly for customers from the east. Not for us. If you look at new mmorpg then always check who's creating it. To which market. And you will avoid a lot of bad games :)
---
If you still have one to give out, I would appreciate a code :) Thanks for doing this anyways!

---
Hi guys,
---
I'm still looking to play gw2 again but when i played the endgame was horrible there was just nothing to do except for fractals pve wise.
---
Is there any new stuff going on?
---
I saw there are raids. Will these raids drop some special gear or something?
---
I just wanna know some new features.
---
Help me to get back into the game. this game had a lot of potential back in the dayz
---
nobody wants you to farm it...that's the point. you can get it by randomly playing stuff like once or twice per month and that alone will give you enough supply to get anything....lol
---
Anet defo over value things like VO.
---
Sure it's nice the first time but the people who are going to replay it usually couldn't give a shit.
---
Just look at all the caves scattered across the world with a dead end and nothing like a rich node or a chest in it. They would have been perfect to add a rollerbeetle wall at the end, with an extra reward behind it.
---
So yall are saying that someone should stock up 250 map currency on day one of the new episode just because we will need it on the end of the season, like one and a half year from now?  
---
  
---
This sub can be so retarded some times...
---
I see. Assuming you can deposit something there as f2p, then I could see maybe someone paying account1 to have account2 deposit something, true. I forgot about the treasury because it was a long time that ANet added something new to save for in there and all guilds I am in have been at maximum for ages.
---
No, mesmer is jack of all trades. Everything thief can do, mesmer can do better and even has stuff that thief can't do.
---
Some of them, anyway. Others are so useless you basicall skip em entirely.
---
&gt; I am excited to grind again.
---
That would make you unique. Most of us want no grind at all and easy leveling was the attraction to play this game.

They actually used a simian rig, minus tail. 
---
Grawl had a different gait when walking.
---
There's a secondary camera somewhere under the map that casts the character as texture for preview window, it has it's own settings. Not 100% sure, but devs like to do that.
---
That is the second best metaphor used to describe ArenaNet.
---
Thief is absolutely absurd in terms of just how much you can shove into this one skill.

I mean seriously, look at this.

OP said `there was just nothing to do except for fractals pve wise` so I assumed that it was the only thing they could do at that time which was before HoT and Raid releases and since Fractals were introduced on November 26, 2013 with the Fractured Living world update this was the earliest point they could have not played.
---
You can't get people to do content they don't want to do by locking the cool stuff behind that kind of content. All you do is drive people to play games that reward them for doing content they like. Anet knew that, once upon a time. Exclusivity and elitism are bad business strategies. That's why raids are so dead in GW2.
---
As to why, probably because there are already a fuckzillion of WoW clones out there that work in exactly that way, and Anet decided to not compete with that section of the genre, but instead cater to a different kind of gameplay.
---
On a sidenote: way back when, that's how all MMOs worked. You went to farm whatever had the highest gold/hour ratio on the market, sold your stuff and bought whatever you wanted. Drak'Rethor The World-Eater didn't drop from some boss, you killed fivehundred bandits, dragged their 'a rusty short-sword' to whatever crafter you worked with, who salvaged all the stuff and created your 'a sharp steel-blade'. For Drak'Rethor The World-Eater you did the same, but also dragged 50 demon eyes, 2 dragon bloods and 20.000 souls of the damned to your crafter.
---
...or sold it all and bought it off the market.
---
All Anet did is remove the crafter. You can still get phat loot. Your dragon blood and lost souls and whatnot check boxes in your collection tab, and you don't have to sell it all or bring it to a crafter, but get it rewarded directly.
---
[Nike does a good job going over it](https://youtu.be/SsZApZ-JV-o). Ascended items (depending on when you left we now have full ascended gear) is still the top tier in term of stats and we have min/maxing with stat infusions and legendary gear (now includes sigils, runes, armor, and some trinkets in addition to the original legendary weapons). In terms of new stuff we are getting a new living story chapter in less than a week (and past living story just went on sale), with it we are getting 3 new strike missions (10 man content that is meant to be an intro to raids so it's easier and single fights) as well as a new map, this is in addition to the last chapter we got for the prologue.
---
There are 7 raid wings so far, they want you to be geared in the correct stats and builds but there isn't any tier of gear past ascended. The idea is that you become a better player with more class and build options rather than just grinding better gear.
---
Depending on exactly when you left (before HoT?) the game is vastly different I mean you can see [*some* of the major changes here](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_36.png). Lots of guides and info out there if you need/want it.
---
&gt; This is ~~the~~ one of several major flaw*s* with your entire system.
---
FTFY
---
It's probably not just Korea but that region as a whole including China and Japan.
---
They mentioned pvp templates deserved a system of their own and were coming, but they wanted to release templates ahead of their pvp implementation. While I agree with the outrage, just keep this in mind. 
---
Though it makes one wonder why they didn't just wait for a bit more and release it all in one go instead of tampering with QoL for a few months while we wait for pvp templates.
---
Can't say however if this is going to be of much help for WvW. Probably not.
---
Cool, now where content?
---
oh man its really sad to hear that about rs.  I had to quit rs in 2010 to focus on college, but I constantly compare gw2 to runescape's updates.  So many side quests and building up the world.  At the time, I think rs did a quest update every month. I've always felt like gw2's world (outside of main story) is incredibly shallow in comparison because they have no sidequests, or at least no sidequests with memorable characters and events, essentially.  
---
But now I see rs has microtransactions, I wouldn't play it again.  Really sad to hear they were destroyed by microtransactions.
---
Does anyone know when the sale will be over? I'm hoping for GW2 to have the same black Friday sale this year as last and to pick up PoF Ultimate. Then I could pick up all the season episodes I'm missing.
---
Where your players come from doesn't matter when it comes to overall spending tho. If the game costs more to maintain/update than it's making it will get scrapped eventually. 
---
NCSoft has no obligation to maintain it's presence in the West.
---
you're assuming wages are the only cost, I'd bet they're not even the biggest cost marketing/support probably gets that crown. keep in mind that Gw2 is only released in NA, EU and china (through a separate publisher) 
---
while Aion is release in south korea, china, japan, australia, taiwan, EU, NA and russa. Korea, Japan, Taiwan and NA are all under ncsoft umbrella, so support / marketing costs are incurred directly by ncsoft. Furthermore while 3rd party publishers incur some of that cost, they still need to be provided with some support / marketing so no I wouldnt say its a given that overall Aion is more profitable then Gw2 at all. 
---
&gt; Anet failed to make an expac, which should be a known fact by know AND said they have no plans to make an expac.
---
You're making a lot of assumption, what they said was that they dont have an answer now not that they have no plans to make another Expac. Also you're completely ignoring that saga isnt just a new fancy name for season but is also a new content delivery model. We've already seen it has a different release cadence rather then the usual 3 month release window, episode 1 is coming just 2 months after last release. That it will consist of 6 episodes is an assumption could very well have more. More then that its too early. Anet uses a team schedule to work on content and as such all teams are most likely fully engaged on living world right now and that will probably not change until they get to the 4 episodes to go mark which is probably when work on what comes next starts. Until then there is no point in committing to either expansions or not. That doesnt mean they cant plan for it though. My guess is they'll probably see if the new format can drive up revenue, if it fails its going to be another Expac if it does they'll probably just keep the momentum going. 
---
&gt;Compared to other MMO's the content we get is VASTLY less for story alone already. 
---
This I disagree with.
---
&gt;other mmo's get new raids basically every 3months. 
---
you are aware there are other MMOs besides FFXIV and WoW right? and while its true those games get a raid every 3 months or so they get nearly no open world content in between expansions.
---
&gt;Anet does not manage to keep proper release schedules and is heavily meme'd for that.
---
Seems to me like anet is just held up to an impossible standard because yeah they're heavily memed for it but its not like they're the only ones that dont adhere to their schedule to the day. Lets see FFXIV season 4 release shall we? They too have a 3 month release schedule right? so they had 5 major releases and time in between was:
---
112 days, 113 days, 119 days, 112 days
---
On the other Hand season 4 for Gw2 had the following release delta:
---
99, 112, 84, 112, 127 days. 
---
That makes FFXIV average at 114 days and Gw2 average was 107 days. Yet like you said Gw2 is meme'd for its "bad" release schedule while FFXIV is praised like the golden standard everyone should follow even though overall gw2 was actually more consistent. Its even more "tragic" when you consider that FFXIV doesnt really get any content updates in between those 3 months while gw2 had 6 festivals with new / revamped content, rune and sigil salvaging, a couple of new pvp arenas , new mount and roller bettle racing. 
---
&gt;gw2 is not only the least profitable part of NCsoft, but also the one that is in the hardest declining rate.
---
Really? You really seem to love underestimating Gw2 because lets take last quarter (Q3) It was a particular good one for Gw2 just 15m won yet when you put things into perspective NCsoft West did 24.4m won in total. Ergo Aion, Lineage 2 and Blade and soul combined did 9.4m won. All of them combined did just a tad bit more then 1/2 of what Gw2 did on its own. If ncsoft were to write off gw2 like you're suggesting exactly why would it keep ncsoft west? And if they intend to close it down why invest $130m in it?
---
&gt; that's hosted and dealt with by another company where anet basically has nothing to do with.
---
how is that a bad thing? thats free money, they get to pay for distribution marketing and localization, you get a free royalty cheque!
---
Thanks for clarifying the GDPR story, I managed to track it down, turns out people jumped too quickly to the conclusion this was malicious from Anet side. That story has been updated:
---
"PS. Everyone relax, my account was never in danger. All they deleted was personal information tied to my account. Theres no fear of losing your account by doing this (at least there shouldn't be).
---
Update: Well, I made another ticket to their support platform and got this reply. I also got some data, but I doubt that its all "Personal information" as they state. It only includes a long list of IP addresses, my emails and phone number. No names, nor anything else. Now I requested my Account information as well, so we will see what happens next."
---
The swap is instant, slap your builds on a shortcut.

Those are Pact Chopers. The rotating blades have a special blur effect to make them seem like they're spinning fast. The clouds have a weird glitch with that effect.
---
I saw it yesterday.
---
Nice assumption but no. I spent zero on that. If you want I can post a screenshot and just make you look bad but I rather not.
---
Ah, good old boonshare Thief, made even better as boonshare Deadeye. Such a fun build to run.
---
Yeah, that adds to it.
---
You have legendary armor (collections to complete in raids, then crafting), legendary ring(raids + crafting), legendary trinket (second one, LWS4), legendary runes and sigils. Then you have tons of new maps with cool events. New maps + events are the most fun thing to do in PVE. If you want hardcore content, the game might not be for you. But you have high level fracta;s with challenge modes, the raids have both normal and challenge mode.
---
Completely valid, and why I'm not a fan of Anet's concept that new content comes in the form of a new map. If you are concerned with spreading the playerbase too thin, then adding a new map every living story is a really terrible idea. I am not saying they shouldn't add new maps, but S2 we saw what...3? new maps? Maybe 2, i don't ever remember which season Southsun was. I think it is telling how Southsun Cove and Silverwastes in particular remain popular even though they are the oldest of the new content maps added by Living Story updates. And though their popularity has dropped off, they are still more popular than say Draconis.
---
This game desperately needs the devs to revisit old content and update it and add new content within (especially post mounts and post gliding), which ironically was kind of the point of the Living Seasons... originally we saw major content changes happening to the original content... now we can argue the quality of some of those changes... the point is.. it was the correct idea.
---
Incarnate Vest (gemstore). Similar options would be Feathered, Sorcerer (human T3), Winged, Conjurer (2nd screenshot) and my personal favorite: Carapace, if ~~you're~~ your friend is looking for non-gemstore alternatives with similar uhhh qualities.
---
On the contrary I could say that I've never been more lucky with black lion chests than I am now and they shouldn't change anything. Its almost like it's an rng system and we're taking a gamble every time we open chests and even in large batches they aren't always going to be as rewarding as you might like.
---
And all that wasted when your target dodges üò†
---
doesn't even need such a UI change. the game could just remember the last active slot in a given gamemode.
---
He could elaborate all he wants. He will still get downvotes and spite. So is the nature of the internet culture.
---
The original comment was imagine being on the same level as Aion and Blade and Soul. That comment has an implication. 
---
Since we don't know the relative costs of running any of these games, we can't know if this game is or isn't making profit. It's all guess work.
---
But the implication that this game is doing badly specifically because of those numbers is itself a misleading statement and that's all I was commenting on.

The soccer world cup gets a lot more eyes on it than the baseball world series.  Doesn't mean baseball is having a problem.  It's watched in far more countries by far more people.

They should either sepperate PvP/WvW builds like they did before or increase the amount of free build slots to 4 instead of 2.

Pretty sure AWS costs continue to decrease, not increase. That has at least been my experience with it.

Announce this on Map chat or pop an LFG to find other people. You are not alone on needing them so other might join as well.
---
There's a lot of content for someone like you, get back into the game, buy the Living Story episodes you missed  (they are on discount) and play, there's also new dev in the balance department and he seems to care a lot about balancing, so the competitive game modes are probably going to a better state in the future.

In all honesty, Domain of Kourna didn't even really show players how to drift. The races do a far better job for that.
---
Are you aware that swapping legendary pieces out removes their sigil and infusion? Yea it's a 3-4 second fix but it doesn't "eliminate clicks".
---
That absolutely do not, unless you're considering gem store cosmetic skins as content. Then maybe you have an argument.
---
Spvp wasn't really that good. It was obvious to me and many others that it would not become. It just wasn't good as a pvp game, there are better pvp games out there. The major flaw is that gw2 is basically an action game with no execution (like aiming).

So far I've been doing my story slowly. If I'm playing alone I generally will hit the story quests. If I'm playing with wife or kids we usually just explore and do heart quests.

I said the statues are a good thing. But, on the other side, you can always use the gems to buy what you want in the first time.....chests were made to be a gamble
---
I don't want them to be rewarding, I want a larger spectrum of items. If you open 40 chests you will get the same thing, most of the time. A bag, a statue, a crafting material and a voucher or egg....no longer boosters, comunal fire, primers are not as common as they used to etc.

But honestly I found playing GW2 in VR slightly better with the flat panel view but still filling my FOV. Mainly because it performs better for me and its a nice balance between the two.
---
Which isnt relevant for a company.
---
A company, namely NCSoft only cares for the profits, not where it they come from.
---
And, of course GW2 having similar numbers to AION is bad for these reasons:
---
- Its 4 years older
---
- Pretty much only played in Korea nowadays (which means that it has a far smaller target audience than GW2.)
---
- Its surely cheaper to maintain (GW2 content needs more work hours than aion-content, which is basic-mmo-stuff and fetch-quests)
---
GW2 is definitely less profitable than AION, or BnS, which is also why NCSoft makes ANet monetize things like Templates. (A Developer wants to make a good game, not make it worse through Monetization - but when the Publisher says, developers do, because in the end they get paid by the publisher.)
---
Does this mean GW2 is in any danger? - No, if it stays stable, but not if it drops by another 40-50%, thats when the revenue will get awfully close to the costs of running ANet and doing all the things needed for GW2.
---
Games are a business, therefore business Points of View are the only ones that NCSoft cares for, which is also why AION 2 is a mobile thing.
---
It may be easier to tweak for balance, but it would be way worse to show on screen.
---
In GW1 you could have at most the effects from 8 allies and 16 enemies at the same time.
---
In GW2 you can have at most 100 allies and 200 enemies.
---
Yeah, I agree. I really liked the ESO experience when I played it for free. What kept me from immersing myself into that MMO is that the cash shop is riddiculous.
---
It‚Äôs very much a pop culture look though, the actual tales of wendigos have never mentioned antlers or deer skulls. Traditionally, wendigo are supposed to look like large, sickly skinny humans. Because that‚Äôs what they are, cannibals that are supernatural to varying degrees due to their cannibalism.
---
Gw1 also had an outrageous bloat of class effects.  Anet basically just needs self control, not everything needs a buff or de buff, and if they do give something it should be just one effect
---
Thank you; what a person of culture!
---
WvW doesn't need extra power. It needs less overall power and more tactics across all builds, and more reasons to spread and to keep full supply lines defended, and to encourage player vs player encounters of all sizes.  
---
And something new to shake things up, like more elite specs; a powerful mobile siege machine that can be captured with a 3-way event that happens once every skirmish and won't start until at least 5 players from each team are present, and that takes 2 players to ride, like [this big boy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/91/Charr_Tank_Token.jpg); and maybe also a 3rd jungle-theme borderland with more sneaky topography and features like locations with tall grass and bushes that hide those inside from those outside while out of combat, favoring guerilla tactics and ambushes.
---
And once alliances are done and there's 3 or more borderlands, allow each world to vote which borderlands they want for their world for the next match or season. 
---
Also, at least as test during a week, WvW should get Special event to test a "Cowardice" effect that gains stacks when defeating enemies while outnumbering them near an objective:
---
* Stacks would be given only while in range of a contestable objective, that is, the area in which a player would get the Objective Aura if it was active for their team. 
---
* Stacks will be given at the moment of defeating a player when players of a team involved in the fight outnumber by at least 40% the players of the team of the defeated player. It could be counted like this:
---
 * Count only players within 2000 units of the defeater and the defeater.
---
 * Ignore players from the 3rd team.
---
 * Count only players in combat with players of the two teams involved. Ignore players not in combat or in combat only with the 3rd team or NPCs.
---
 * Then compare the numbers of the remaining players from each team. Stacks will be given when the team of the defeater has at least 40% more players than the team of the defeated player. 
---
 * The number of stacks given will be the half difference between those numbers, rounded down. Fighting 5v3 will not cause stacks of cowardice, but fighting 5v2 will cause 1 stack when the first outnumbered player is defeated, and another 2 when the second one is defeated. 
---
* Each stack lasts 10 minutes and increases the time it takes to capture a point by 1%. When players with different stack sizes try to capture a point, the lowest count will be used so players with higher counts are not harassed into leaving the circle. Each stack could also decrease downed health by 2%.
---
* For players with 25 stacks or more, WXP and warscore from defeating individual players and guards is disabled. Warscore and points from objectives will not be affected. 
---
* Players with 50 or more stacks cannot capture or contest objectives.  
---
* Players with more than 50 stacks will skip downed state and go directly to being defeated. 
---
* To lose stacks, they'll have to either wait for the timer of each stack to run its course, or defeat enemies while outnumbered. The calculation on how many stacks will be lost will be the same: half the difference between enemies and allies on the 'aggro tables' of the player defeated and the player who defeated them, rounded down. Being defeated by players from a different team also clears all stacks, but no other type of death will do that. Leaving WvW won't clear the stacks either. They will not be shown outside WvW, but they will be visible again when returning to WvW if they didn't run out, and like participation, they will be shared across all characters.  The stacks will not tick while outside WvW or logged off either.  
---
* The Outnumbered effect would prevent getting stacks of cowardice.  
---
* When defeating a player that has stacks, your team will get +1 warscore point for every 10 stacks, and you will get +10% WXP for each stack and +1 loot bag for every 20 stacks. Making cowards very juicy targets.
---
I doubt it, it looks like a leshi, which is from slavic mythology.
---
Pop culture has sort of pushed the appearance of the leshi onto the wendigo as well, but that‚Äôs a native american myth, so still not nordic mythology.
---
there is enough time between epidodes to complete 100 reward tracks for thousands excess materials/currencies
---
*bonk* And dazed
---
fucking whisper them and ask
---
The cash shop offerings aren't ridiculous, imo. But the prices are. Everything needs a 50% price cut, for sure.
---
That, and the fact that updates aren't free. One year of updates (dungeon dlc, big story zone, dungeon dlc, small story zone) costs about 90-100 dollars. 
---
It's still better than a mandatory 15 dollar sub (180 dollars) and it allows you to just skip whatever content you aren't interested in, but ESO is still a pricy game.
---
Things have changed quite a bit recently in the PVP and WVW area. A whole new mount, not to mention a new Dev team member devoted to improving balance.
---
Have you tried adding each account to the friend list of the other account?
---
F2P are less limited when it comes to friends. Although you may still have to wait a bit and try again.
---
NA wvw players are moving to play on EU (make your own opinion as to how wvw on NA is).
---
EU wvw is active during EU prime time (not even close to being active as you know it from before HoT). Apart from prime time, wvw on EU is slowly dying aswell.
---
The most annoying part is that these are loadouts and not templates.
---
I constantly keep screwing up my PvE equipment templates in PvP because I'm using different weapons there and they keep overriding random PvE templates.
---
Stop spreading misinformations. They said the EQUIPMENT templates in PvP need extra work and would be added later. Build templates in PvP are already enabled and work as intended.
---
And it makes totally sense. The equipment in PvE and WvW is shared while PvP uses its own system.
---
An auto-switch function is not related to this ‚Äúmissing feature‚Äú since your equipment ‚Äústats‚Äú are already automatically changed in PvP.
---
That's a brilliant idea actually
---
Ideal game plan would be to play each day different map, based on your momentary taste, to have some fun here and there, without big repeats...
---
but no, that is not acceptable in a world of ideal "gold per hour"...
---
omega ceiling cat
---
Not a single disconnect here for two weeks now. Small lag spikes in PvE bounty runs.
---
It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the Aion revenue is ONLY from the NA version because NCSoft sold the EU game off to Gameforge years ago.
---
&gt;why they didn't just wait for a bit more
---
The president of the company just hauled ass. They needed a PR diversion, whether the feature was half-baked or not.
---
*Laughs in auramancer*
---
Seriously, those overloads can get huge
---
Great, now we have to find [what to feed her](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hungry_cat_scavenger_hunt). I'm guessing 2 pact aircrafts, but I don't have any for testing.
---
The best
---
Right, their appearance in [Until Dawn](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/f2/7d/15f27deac1af7817455350b9e9b87c0b.png) is much more fitting to the classical lore you described.
---
I became The Hero of Shaemoor in 5 minutes after starting the game! Is it just me, or am I amazing? ...
---
&gt; I wonder if this is really them not properly utilizing resources or simply its content that doesnt resonate with players. 
---
The problem there is you can't release the perfect content. You have to invest time and resources until it's good. If you throw it away the moment it isn't a total success, you'll never have any decent content in the game.
---
Many things in this game don't get resources because they aren't popular. That's just one side of the story though, for many were strangled by said lack of resources in the first place. You can't let a game mode die, then deprecate it altogether because it isn't popular anymore. No shit, Sherlock. So yeah, that's half the game for you.
---
This reminds me of the toothless meme
---
Does it override it completely? As in, it doesn't exist anymore and you have to remake it from the ground?
---
More like a guy who uses 6 different runes because "versatility".
---
The thing they overvalue the most is the goddamn story. Literally no one I know gives a shit about it, they play it just because, afking when they start to talk too much.
---
Yeah, I'm sure some people love it, but I'm pretty confident it's a minority. Story was never this game's strongest point, and it never will.
---
It's neat an fast. 
---
It could be a bit more compact, tho, at least on smaller resolutions.
---
‚ÄúSo the Quiznos diversion from the template debacle was not successful... what are we going to come out with next to get them to quit thinking about how we‚Äôre milking them for money.‚Äù ~ANET/NCSoft sometime probably, 2019
---
On it üôÇ
---
GW1 is still the better game.
---
It's kinda weird that the Daredevil "gimmick" is "We halve the range of your special skill".
---
Pog
---
So the new Galarian Meowth?
---
We,ll that is not enough for my theeeeef. Can anet please add more?
---
Follow a zerg, defense of objectives, kill dolyaks, flip camps/sentries, kill roamers, repair etc. You are acting like WvW is a scary thing, go join a zerg and just follow the commander, yes you'll die, yes you'll get lost but that's normal until you get the hang of the map, maybe you'll find you even like it
---
Roaming, you can do just about anything.  You can battle other players, take camps, towers, and keeps (once you get a bit more experienced).  The only thing I haven't done solo is take over SM.  Roaming is a really rewarding playstyle and being solo, you decide what to do.  So many ways to have fun.
---
If you're new to WvW with little PvP experience, however, take it slow.  If you just dash out with "Pve glass cannon meta build", you'll get crushed fast.
---
There is a lot to learn.  I learned myself but have also enjoyed teaching others.  One of the best things to do is look for or ask for another solo roamer to take you with them and mentor you some.
---
Some people just pop in for dailies especially the vet daily.  But that isn't fast.
---
A much easier thing to do is get at least a halfway build and tackle and take over one camp at least every 10 minutes.  It's very easy, but it can get pretty boring.
---
Ideally, I suggest my first option of finding a mentor for solo WvW.  They can help you to build a character and give you some experience.  If you never PvPed before, it can also be good to get a bit of practice doing 1vs1 in SPvP with a mentor.  You may find that you'll have more gifts of battle than you know what to do with if you find out just how fun roaming solo can be. :)
---
I also remember being hyped about everything that was presented on their website when the game launched. None of it made it though.
---
A personal story that evolves according to your own choices and personality? Dumped.
---
Living World? Glad they changed the name to Saga, because the world isn't "living" post-LA Invasion.
---
Renown Hearts changing the world around you and making you feel your questing had impact? Interesting choice but only half of that was implemented.
---
And the most baffling of all... the colaborative design iniciative, in which we would be able to "work" alongside the devs to make the game the public wanted. Dead.
---
I had the same issue but I found a workaround that works for me.
---
Go to your installed programs and find Guild Wars 2 on the list. Then you click it and select uninstall.
---
The templates have not been an issue for me ever since. Note that this fix will only work on pc but i'm sure that are something similar for the people playing on Mac.
---
You can solo roam. It's harder than zerging and you will die a lot at the start. Look up a roaming build for your class on reddit or youtube (look for recent ones), and start taking sentries, supply dolyaks, camps and ruins. I recommend sticking to Borderlands maps, they're easier for roamers to get around without too much fighting. When you get attacked by other solo roamers, fight back and slowly get better at dueling.
---
Edge of the Mists is also fine for roaming for sentries/camps and stuff but you won't get pips for additional WvW rewards. Pips don't matter for your reward track, but the rewards are good, I wouldn't want to miss out on those.
---
welcome to game dev.
---
I was wondering if you finish your daily?
---
You can do like me, previously a PvE player only... you can accidentally learn to love WvW in the process of waiting it out. It‚Äôs actually pretty awesome.
---
There's no real way to speedrun reward tracks. You have to earn participation and keep it at tier 6 to get through it as fast as possible.
---
To start, I'd recommend finding a pugmander and following them for a bit to kick-start your participation to tier 6.
---
Then, the easy care-free way of keeping that participation up is running yaks. Go to a camp nearby your team's keep, and walk the yak that spawns to the keep and then run back for the next one. Throw up a movie on a second monitor to keep you preoccupied.
---
If you have anything that boosts your WvW reward track, now is the time to use it. Candy Corn Gobbler can give you a boost with 50%+ reward track progression.
---
Also for a little extra progress, do your [WvW dailies](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily#WvW_daily_achievements) for [potions of WvW rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potion_of_WvW_Rewards).
---
Boring. If u uninstalled for this u are dumb
---
Really neat and very helpful. Thanks!
---
In 1-2 hours in WvW.
---
Any option that already is limited on crafting step can be bought in a single go. So just remember to do daily crafts and you get access to pretty expensive, but much more universal option.
---
Blizzard belonged to Sierra/Vivendi
---
I log into the game after some weeks to test the templates, I was very happy at the beginning then  I got into a pvp match and realize that they remove the excellent gear and build system for pvp and replace it with the templates. I just log off. 
---
How the hell anet screw this so bad!!!
---
Holy crap! How can we implant this in the game UI?! This is great!
---
I would love to try this for JPs!
---
I was going to try this tonight and make a video :D
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm also wondering why they don‚Äôt have it in the game. There are over 650 WPs now with more to come.
---
no more half measures walter
---
This is a great way to look at it.  I'm in the same boat now too.  I don't really play anymore like I used to so I guess I'm technically part of that crowd now too.  I've played for 7 years and have accomplished everything I want to.  I'm not interested in grinding anymore.  I can see WvW will never be what I hoped for.  Sooo I just login to talk to some people and maybe roam a bit then logout.  There's no more daily crafting, gathering, or routines I do.  I just wait for the next living story every few months and then leave the game again after I finish (which is usually story + map completion and a reward from the currency but I'm done with minis and tonics).
---
I could see this placed as a small search box in a corner.
---
Yup, on the map UI
---
Shrine Guardian Outfit, the aura (tiny floating balls) is part of it.
---
mom's spaghetti (code)
---
yesss please :D
---
I was thinking of starting with Morgans Leap, seeing as its a easy one and if that goes well a hard one.. any suggestions? :D
---
Anet "polishing an issue".  FUcking lol.
---
I do the same
---
Story is god awful, not sure why they even continue with it.
---
People play it just to see if there is any good rewards and get access to maps.
---
This should be in game.  I spent a solid minute one time trying to figure out where a map was so I could get a daily done.  I had quit the game for a few months and couldn't remember where any of the maps were lol.
---

Yes there are some one-shotter builds, like couple days ago my full glass character went from 100% -&gt; 0% when a deadeye stealth stabbed once from behind.
---
don't remind me oh god oh fuck 2009 to 2012 jesus oh god fuck
---
B&amp;S is on 9 regions not just korea. But yeah the amount of gamer in Korea is far beyond European countries. The korean gaming market is sth like the 4th in the world.
---
Exactly....primers can be crafted, boosters became useless....what's the point to open chests anymore? Skins are cool, wardrobe unlocks are super epic, but they drop slowly....all you get is crafting mats, mats you can farm in pve very easly.
---
Why to not support them? And what's the point with euros? My price is displayed in euro.
---
Should be a list of locations on the map like in FFXIV and ESO, be much easier moving around
---
Welcome to bad dev practices. Not everyone is this short sighted.
---
I'm also a player of all 3 game modes, and yes GW2 has a lot of good content (and a lot of really bad and abandoned things as well), but they still lack a unified vision in that company after 7 years still!
---
First they want to focus on Living World content, so they implemented season 1... which is unplayable anymore so it doesn't even count as content.
---
Then they switched to expansion content, which was a great hit to most players (after all the massive bug fixes), but that took a whole lot of resources and took them 3 years to finish the promised generation 2 legendaries.
---
They then went back to Living World content for season 2.
---
Then they had POF, which was a flop content wise, as there is almost no reason to repeatedly go back to those maps (unless you are working on achievements or collections). Devs realized again that the expansion model is not viable.
---
So we then get 2 Living World seasons back to back, which there was some improvement in season 4 (but most maps again lack any repeatability)
---
Finally, for whatever reason, they are changing Living World to 'Sagas' (which is going to be a fancy way of saying LW seasons) instead moving forward as of now.
---
They are constantly changing their expansion model, because they never had a proper roadmap and/or business model. The only thing that was consistent with making money for them was the gem store, but as a veteran player, I'm noticing I'm using it less and less recently because it's not giving me anything new besides skins.
---
&gt;  (I am not a gambling addict, I just enjoy surprise items)

---
Yes. But instead of AFK you could play the game. It wouldn't give more progress for the reward tracks, but hey - it's a game. You might like it.
---
Doesn't work in preview menus though, isn't it? I remember back in the 32bit client days, I've used exterior smaa injector for that.
---
I was about to suggest do the hardcore now! lolllll like southsun or Not so Secret, but yes, easy ones first! I think it will be really fun tho for the Winstersday JP!
---
Wouldn't it be simpler to make a reddit post with a gif that contains the player's name?
---
&gt; Get the mount then, it will vastly improve your capability of acting.
---
That likely will take longer than completing the track if you don't know your way around already.
---
That may be true, previews UI in gw2 are subpar in every way.
---
I re-read the blog post "Developing Essence Manipulation" and couldn't find anything if it's strictly for PvE or is it for all gamemodes. Guess we'll see when it's released!
---
Remember to AFK in the obsidian sanctum if you're playing during your servers prime time. You still get your reward track but don't take a slot in a queue.
---
They want to do one reward track to get a Gift of Battle and your answer is to get the mount as it will make it easier. So basically: do this reward track to get a mount to make it easier for you to do this other reward track. ;)
---
Sounds like you should take a look at your build
---
It's definitely doable in one festival run if you're committed. You'll need to do all three World 1 zones on tribulation mode 16 times each (not daily gated). I recommend using TacO to guide yourself through since tribulation mode is extremely punishing if you don't know where the traps are. It's gonna suck when you're just getting started, but trust me, it gets easier with every completion. Good luck!
---
Imo BLC have been improved a lot over the years, the "notes" section in the Wiki is a good summary for this. Also, in the past, one of the slots was a guaranteed booster, so still two RNG slots and 1 guaranteed item like now. They still don't "feel" good/ rewarding but that might be just gambling in general.
---
&amp; You can't drop any boosters anymore at all, there are no T3-4 bags either. We might be opening different chests
---
And never forget: Infinite Continue Coin
---
Just pay someone to accountshare and play for you. What should go wrong?^/s
---
&gt; We don't know if black lion chests are true RNG, or if they're the digital equivalent of a claw machine.
---
It's a claw machine.
---
TBH, I'm not just talking shit about GW2. All MMORPGs are trash in 2019. 
---
So stupid to make players play boring dungeon over and over again just to get all the gears. Or make you pay actual money to buy those gear.
---
why can't they make MMORPG like CS:GO, when you get in the game, you already got every gear u need.
---
You may be forced to engage depending on your class, and which class you come up against, and whether you get jumped by them randomly from a direction you didn't expect. Unless you're a thief (and perhaps certain builds of ranger, engineer and mesmer), you might have some trouble.

https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/gems

Templates came out Oct. 29th. Gems have been steadily priced 35-40 gold per 100 gems (290-320 gold per 800). Prices have been this high, or higher, since July. The spike they had on Oct 29th was pretty small as compared to most big releases in the past. Generally see 25% or more, with spikes when something popular comes out in gemstore. For a release as hyped as templates (7 years in the making), it wasn't more then a 10% spike that had corrected itself in less then a day. 
---
*Sometimes that website doesn't catch the extreme spikes right after something is released, but it is good for general trends (checks every 30 minutes or so). I was playing at the release time of the patch, and when manually checking gem prices (several times) there weren't any significant spikes. It was nothing like a new BLC or something. 
---
This coming Tuesday, Nov. 19, will be a big release day (probably a new BLC and saga) and gem prices will spike significantly more if you want to compare. I bet prices will spike higher then they did for templates.
---
&gt;and what activities would i be doing at max level?
---
GW2 is very self-guided, so this depends on what you want to do (I realize how unhelpful that is, but it's true). The daily achievements and daily Tequatl the Sunless boss fight are good to do every day because they don't take too long and give you a guaranteed 3g plus other rewards. 
---
IIRC there's a guide in the sidebar called something like "I hit 80, now what?" that has a lot of good ideas of max level activities. Regardless of what you decide, a good first step would be getting all exotic armor, which you can do through a variety of methods like dungeons or just buying on the TP.
---
Just drop a fractal tonic
---
You running around with bad gear vs a player with ascended/legendary gear sounds sounds perfectly balanced to me. 
---
Also you dont need real money to beat a player running around in bad gear
---
 all MMORPGs look identic. 
---
you choose ur race, profession, level up , respawning monsters, all standard classes, killed by good geared players.......( PVP in GW2 is balanced I admit that)
---
&gt;Aka, Guildies are fine, but everyone else is shitting on everyone else on world chat
---
99% of player interactions that I have in game are extremely friendly. You occasionally get some looney toons in LA chat but far less than other MMO's that I've played.
---
Get your power soulbeast with longbow and delete enemies from 1500 ranger while hiding in a tower. And don't forget to spam /sit on them and throw siege on their bodies once dead.
---
no there isnt
---
Not from a roamer
---
This is really really great, good job bro!
---
Yeah, friends with a few. While they defend anet in general hearing them vent makes me feel it is a bit of an industry expectation mindset.
---
Feels like running shit through google translate would produce better results...
---
Why people like this always play rangers?
---
No you have to play the game mode to get the rewards....
---
Hi there, just a quick note. The result of a search also contains waypoints where the search term is in the link code. I assume this is not wanted. For example the term "Jo" returns an unrelated waypoint as the first result.
---
Weeks passed and I, despite trying to get used to it, still randomly find myself on a pve build in wvw and vice versa. Kills all the desire to play tbh.
---
Muckstalker that gets permaheals pretty regularly...
---
&gt;ut this PSA likely wasn't targeted at them anyway and my comment certainly wasn't targeted at them.  I'm directing it at those who had done Aurora 
---
This... collect daily... makes it very easy to amass large amounts of mats for the different maps.  At this point I have between 1000 and 2000 of each currency.  Makes getting new ascended trinkets, rings and, amulets for stat changes with the balance patches very easy and quick.
---
Escort dolys
---
Technically you can play also non-dailies, all completed fractals do give tokens. However yes, the best rewards are those that are dailies, and are once per day. You can even repeat same fractals over and ove with different parties to get more tokens, but it costs time.
---
No other way to speed it up than playing, though.
---
No they don't . Gw2 is mainly about exploration .PvP is a joke and wvw is abandoned to itself.
---
Pve is good if u like that king of endgame
---
you can buy gems directly ingame in the gemstore
---
Ye pretty much .. I like living story as a filler in between xpacs , even tho I always felt like living story was a part of the addon, since they cannot release like 10 maps 3 raids , fractals and big story in one go 
---
The move to calling it ‚Äúsaga‚Äù was just to give it a bigger vibe , in fact there is no expansion like selling point in it yet.
---
"did", past tense. current day ANet only addresses the most blatant issues and bugs and then moves on to release the next unfinished feature. friendly reminder that there still was no word on legendary rune fixes.
---
Good find! I will look into it.
---
Admittedly it was the president who had steered them into this mess, so..
---
Personally I play WvW and achievement hunt. Achievements can be anything from kill x creatures of y type, to essentially full on quests with exclusive rewards.
---
Population is great overall. For WvW it's pretty sparse during off hours but there's a lot of action during primetime.
---
Its got almost nothing to do with your gear... its 100% skill...  Your build is 10000% more important than your gear.  Yes your gear stats matter but the difference between yellow and even ascended gear is minimal... your talking 10% maybe...  So its you, your skill and, your build.
---
probably only till 19.
---
I think you can unlock seasons before you even have the expention tho
---
Its kind of crappy that there is near zero incentive to do fractals (or any other game mode) more than once a day, and even then, only specific ones. I get that you dont want to make people feel like they need to run 50x a day. Though as a person who enjoys fractals, I have gotten to the point where my static can knock out daily T4 and CMs in about 30-40 mins and thats pretty much all there is to do--even recs are hardly worth doing at this point. However, I say this without any real idea how this could be fixed such that fractals are rewarding enough to be able to keep running them as your main game mode, yet not overbearing in terms of "needing" to run tons.
---
Heck, if they had taken their initial approach of halloween, lost shores and wintersday releases and made the living world that (leaving repeatable content in its wake) it would have done wayyyyyyy better.
---
Oh and giving a real ending to the personal story... jesus christ does that whole thing need scrapping. What a joke. (And no i don't think they should bother at this point. But i also think gw2 over gw3 is a bad move too, the game is done in my eyes)
---
Because not everyone wants 20 charactsrs?
---
So, you suck, game sucks because you suck. Makes sense.

I made an alt account in a different server and lab farmed it up to level 72 and equipped with all greens/yellows all just to surprise and ambush my friend on a full ascended mirage build and I managed to down him before other people came so gear rarity might matter, but build and skill definitely matters more.
---
It‚Äôs common in a lot of companies, for sure.

Chests were fine until they started adding RNG weapons, gliders, mounts, outfits... etc...
---
You know what they said once, "when it's ready". How the turntables
---
I wish they would do this with all kinds of things. It seems like such a no brainier sales tactic to me too. Like wouldn't you want expansion features to be teased all over central tyria so the F2P players want to buy that much more?
---
There are so many spots in early maps you can get to now with mounts that you could totally add expansion related collections and secrets to and players without mounts wouldn't be able to get them. Yet more incentive to get expansions.

Season 2 when please
---
Yea, after about 12k ToT bags from Lab farm I was getting pretty burned out, but if I have a goal to work towards it's much more rewarding and I'll stick to it for sure ^_^
---
This entire game in a nutshell.
---
Your best bet if you want to farm out more relics is to find a 42 farm group and do that. Pretty much if you want extra relics you gotta do as many extra fractals as possible. Any way you slice it there is no way to get the infinite pots quickly with out getting lucky drop(s).
---
Gear means nothing in spvp its all in the pvp build
---
Same here. It all depends on how nuanced it feels. I really hope it provides opportunities for creativity instead of being the only way to deal with certain things.
---
Well, they kinda tried doing that with Season 1 but I still remember the backlash everywhere from people wanting more GW1 related stuff...
---
GW1 is still live, they can go there.
---
I'd have preferred a map that I can just click on the waypoint and copy the code.  But then again can't I just go in game and shift-click a waypoint to share it?  I guess I don't see the utility here.
---
I was expecting to see, "Epstein didn't kill himself" in there somewhere
---
Now you just need to limit it to 6 waypoints only, unlock them per characters with gems, and give 2 for free and anet will be looking for hiring you!
---
Joke apart nice work :)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vb0pBWtEus - This has been noted before (around 0:46)
---
I mean, those maps only came into existence because of LWS2. It really doesn't matter that the content wasn't specifically locked behind it for those specific players. That's a really poor argument that is founded purely on an inconsequential technicality.
---
Think it's more about not having to do 6 maps x 250 currency all in one go, but more spread out across time.
---
Either suffer through it or do the daily achievements for a while.
---
Am I? Idk, I just said that the build is not broken as it has quite an easy counter to it.
---
I imagine using this tool is measurably faster than waiting on the wiki search to process, then scanning the results to make sure you're going to the correct page, etc.
---
Well as a Game Developer yes it can be hard, but working off and on of mistakes by a limited engine and removing certain changes that made it easier for a group of people in your game for their game modes is bad.
---
This shows some level of incompetency they could of tested the system a bit more than adhere to the Crunch of time. Most of the errors and problems comes from their extremely limited system that they don't go back and fix.
---
So as Shithouse said: "Welcome to bad dev practices".
---
i used to use gw2timer, its a website that mimics the games full screen map, with api integration so that it knows your position and keeps it updated. at any point you can zoom out and find the wp you want, click it and it copies the wp code so you can paste it into game chat.
---
but it hasnt been updated since pof release and has none of the season 4 maps.
---
The designer was focused on Raids not UI improvement or PvP/WvW, so no loss to the those teams.
---
A loss to the raid team yes...
---
&gt; even recs are hardly worth doing at this point
---
I guess you are swimming in more gold than you know what to do with?
---
Yes, but you used to be able to go from far point to home point instantly.  They nerfed the range in it hard.
---
You could do that. But, presumably, you found out about said WP from a guide in your browser, not ingame. Plus that, while using GW2WP, you can find waypoints faster, usually, there's no need to type the whole name. And, also, there's one-click copy.
---
^^^ This, not everyone plays with more than like 5 or 9 chars, I have 14 to 18 myself but that's because I wanted mostly charr after a while.
---
People with characters like me and 20+ up are the minority, regular peeps just want functioning build templates that work so they don't have to make extra characters.
---
It's sad when character slots are cheaper than build templates themselves.
---
I'm a jack of all trades in real life _(and I love to travel)_
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I guess that trait carries over in videogames - my first ascended sets in any armour weight has always been **Celestial Gear** with **Runes of the Traveler** - all stats with pretty jack of all trades runes that also grants passive 25% movement speed - perfect gear for me!
---
* Celestial Ranger
---
* Celestial Guardian
---
* Celestial Necromancer
---
Those three can really benefit from celestial stats. I remember in the old days dueling people in WvW and they'd always try to guess my build based on the weapons I'd then use, and to their surprise I'd win 95% of the time.
---
Because of my affinity to Celestial Stats, I've always **always** charged quartz pieces - things became much simpler when they introduced the Quartz node &amp; the source of power in the player's home instance!
---
#I'm swimming in charged quartz
---
And I suggest you do the same!
---
This is such a funny comment to me remembering how long GS was essentially the only usable weapon for Warrior.
---
I've recently come back and looking to get the ascalonian armor set for fashion reasons. Is it quicker to do the wvw track or dungeon runs right now? Most of the time I go to wvw my server is in bad shape and has nobody doing anything. I also havent ran a dungeon since before the expansions, so I'd be pretty clueless. Just looking for some suggestions.
---
How do you do this and not lose participation?
---
But it's not true. Thief has better stealth (obviously), better mobility with the short bow, it has more evades on the daredevil, especially if playing with staff or sword/pistol, and better one shot potential with dagger or riffle on deadeye. It even has better boon application as long as there is a mesmer in the enemy team. Also, since thief got a portal, there isn't much stuff that mesmer can do that thief can't
---
Those lamps were so good. Made me so damn much gold.
---
When making the maps I'm also talking about the voice acting and writing for the events and achievements in the map.
---
Most of that work goes into open world instances rather than story specific ones.
---
Just wait until you see the smile
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be everything in game on one skill.....
---
Cheers!

Lua and XML.
---
You're right, WoW default UI is total garbage, they never put any effort into it *BUT* they always worked on the backend API, put a Lua interpreter inside the client and also a couple of commands that let you export the whole code source and arts, so anyone can rewrite the entire UI from scratch, if they wish to do so.
---
That's all free work done by the community instead of the devs. Very smart decision.
---
&gt; Sounds like a good opportunity to learn:
---
Well, TIL!
---
Hey, this is really cool, and a *heck* of a lot better UI-wise than I could do. Really sleek, simple, and nice!
---
I did notice you're using a hard-coded list of waypoints. That's probly fine for now, but it may get a little tough to maintain later when new maps are added. To that end, I've written a quick script to scrape the GW2 API's `/continents/&lt;n&gt;/floors` for all waypoints, filter out any duplicates/non-waypoints, and then dump them all in a giant array. It doesn't yet do map names, tho that should be relatively trivial. 
---
It's a little slow (multiple nested loops ftl), but I was unsure exactly as to how the 'floor' parameters on the API work. For example, the Dolyak Pass waypoint is recorded on *four* different floors, so I'd have to filter out ones like that (for comparison, the full waypoint list without filters is 2848 items long; the filtered one is *apparently* 763 waypoints long, tho that still seems too big).
---
Pastebin:  [https://pastebin.com/9QcQ45XM](https://pastebin.com/9QcQ45XM)

Yup; pretty much only logged in to unlock stuff for the last several months; meanwhile, over in Eorzia, we got wing 1 of a new Raid, some hardcore content, a new Crafter/Gatherer-focused zone... and I pay less/month than I used to on Gems.
---
Server costs are pretty low these days, it's very different from even a few years ago thanks to some pretty big gains in multithreaded performance and the rise of cheap but fairly fast mass storage in HDDs, as well as the growing size of flash storage.
---
And Tidal!
---
If the rumours were true, it was likely a mobile game, and after what happened at Blizzcon last year, any western developer that wants to get their PC-based fans hyped about a brand new mobile game coming to their favourite content lacking title probably thought twice about ever mentioning it again.

Low demand + high value is usually the sign of an item used to transfer money between accounts (either legitimately or not in the case of external gold selling sites).

Thanks! This is amazing!
---
I did it with a static JSON that I'm building from a Google Sheet. It's rudimentary, but kinda the only way I knew how to do it. I'm not that much of a coder. üòÄ
---
And, with a new map added once every few months, which means 2-3 more WPs, it's not that hard to maintain. And having it built static means it's as fast as it could be.
---
Actually I found a database in http://gw2maptool.net/tools/cliente/mapa/mainMap.html already in spanish. Can you use that one?
---
Gotta agree with this. Total asshole move on Anet's side. This is super inconvenient.
---
Not even close. FFXIV patches are roughly every three to four months too, and the patch notes are like a small novel to get through. That's not even counting the huge expansions every two years. It's similar with WoW.
---
I remember saying that the development team wasn't that smaller then WoW before and got downvoted into oblivion. I'm so glad someone actually getting some karma for it now!
---
By grabbing I mean redeeming too.... obviously. lol
---
Mindless enemy spam and mechanics that overlap horrible with Instabilities is what i would call bad game design. Its not a hard fight because the mechanics are challenging its hard because you get bombarded with adds
---
I'm pretty sure even the most badass player in full whites won't be able to do much against a mediocre player in full exotics or ascended.
---
They were good *quality* fractals, but stepped up *difficulty*. You really need to pay attention to your composition, and some instabilities make it deadly trap. 
---
Funny is that people ask so much about CMs but when regular fractal gets hard, they don't like the challenge...
---
You jsut got one CM with Aquatic rework. It is jsut automatically on.
---
It's also been.... 0 days since the last bitching.
---
&gt; At some point they switched away from bundling fractals/raids into episodes. Did they switch back to it?
---
Id argue your wrong...  
---
1) I don't think you can get level 80 white items.  You'd be on Green or Blues.
---
2) Once again, the 20% stat difference is easily made up in skill.
---
Does anyone have the link with the traits on how to do this?
---
Came here for this. Lol
---
Teleport RNG.  "The Voice," is like those pesky Abra's in Pokemon Red/Blue just outside of Cerulean City.  With about 3-4 people doing competent damage it consistently teleports like 2000-3000 units away multiple times within the span of 1-2m.  It clearly wasn't designed for groups that deal competent damage and it really shows.
---
Nah, just macro it.
---
I wish they would just make more dungeons. That agony resist mechanic has always seemed like a pointless gate to me.
---
Doesn't GW2 support 3D? I think in the video settings you can enable stereoscopic 3D.
---
I believe they added the whole scavenger hunt/collection for Cats to put in your home instance specifically for this situation.
---
They took away something that was in place for 6 years and added a feature leaps and bounds better...  How is that not an improvement? 
---
Now the pvp stuff, I get they havent added those templates yet.  So thats a step back.  But WVW and PVE have NOTHING to complain about and if you are a PVEr or WVWr and your complaining, please fuck off.
---
Ah fair enough
---
Well, I mean take Mai Trin today.  Both Horrik &amp; Trin herself proc **BigBoy** WeBleedFire fireballs that crit for like 7-8k and apply 4 stacks of long-lasting burning.  If you don't have an experienced healer on something with strong condition cleanse like an experienced Firebrand and an experienced Renegade to provide condition buffer via Kalla Heal/Elite?  Not a fun instability.
---
Often times in inexperienced pugs people die in a corner somewhere.  Congrats you're 4 manning the Fractal.  Furthermore, when someone goes down people prioritize their own survivability over having to 4 man the Fractal; Okay now we're 3/5.  Fun times gents!  Things like that snowball out of control when people are inexperienced and have lone-wolf mentalities.
---
Rad!! Ok for light armor... Definitely recommend the Houndskin mantle, one of my favorite shoulder pieces in the game. 
---
The Aurora set (Orr karma) has some fur-lined pieces. I particularly like the boots for female characters. Very "regal" looking for male characters, kind of cutsey for the ladies but certain pieces work. 
---
Vigil Honor's Mantle is another great shoulder armor that looks like a scarf without being too bulky. Devout mantle as well but that's a little more on the "nun" side. 
---
Lawless boots from the gemstore look fur-lined and work for all armor weights. I also think the shoulder scarf skin actually looks pretty nice on a lot of asura. Ebon shoulders is also great for all armor weights, that built in lil scarf is *chef's kiss*
---
Medium armor the Mistwalker Coat from WvW has a fur lining. I also like a lot of the low level leather chests like studded coat, seeker coat, etc. 
---
For heavy armor I particularly like the gladiator gloves and boots. Very cozy looking. :D Another gemstore set but Braham's armor is FANTASTIC for heavy armor characters. So much fur!
---
Generally any piece in general with a high neck is going to look more winter-friendly especially on asura and charr, so things like Rampart's Warplate, Primeval Warplate, or the Illustrious Brestplate are going to look nice on those races especially. 
---
Also check out all the armor sets from Honor of the Waves, great stuff there too!
---
Definitely not. But tag along with a good commander on the field and you‚Äôll start to feel the love.
---
Add spam =/= challenge
---
Good fractals ended with Nightmare CM. Change my mind.
---
overall the 2700X will run the game better especially running multiple instances.  2700X has about the same single core performance as your i5 but boost clocks are 20% higher and the extra cores ensure no background processes will fight GW2 for CPU resources.
---
The people who dont like challenging T4's dont do CM's
---
Do home instance farm daily and this is never a issue. A lot of you act as if you have to go to the zone and farm endlessly when its not true. I consistently sit at 2k(max storage) map currency because of home instance farm.
---
Strike Missions are cool, but... This is really not the game for people who primarily play instanced PvE group content.
---
Yeah lots of activity. I recently got back after months of just logging in here and there, and I've been enjoying it, almost done w my skyscale too. 
---
Also new episode next week
---
It really, really doesn't.
---
&gt; No, elite specs are meant to be side grades rather than upgrades
---
feels that way for some but not all classes.  do people play core Rev or Necro much anymore?  I never see those core classes around since the elite specs.
---
Where is the difficulty in Twilight Oasis and Deepstone you speak off? Both are just artificially long to make you spend more time on completing dailies. The only difficult part of TO was nerfed but a few weeks after its release by adding a checkpoint to the Amala fight. 
---
"Funny is that people ask so much about CMs but when regular fractal gets hard, they don't like the challenge..."
---
Bullshit
---
Thanks! I did pick up S4 last night so far. May grab the others tonight.
---
This. Doing the easy dailies whenever they are up will yield you 3-4 potions per week, and 80 potions will instantly finish a reward track. 
---
Of course this won't sound very helpful when you need something *now*, but it's good to do them even when you don't. You never know when there might be a time you need a reward track for an extra GoB, something like the Warclaw, or even quick LS currencies.
---
&gt; They were good quality fractals, but stepped up difficulty
---
Frustrating =/= difficult
---
honestly not surprised someone wake me up when there is a new cm or raid
---
I've burned out on fractals doing dailies for last year, if they added at least 3 new ones I might have return to doing them daily.
---
Yeah but a new player might not know how to build an engi properly while also not dying, aside from Scrapper with the Sneaky gyro.
---
Stability doesn't work vs. Tempests; inconsistent mitigation = bad design.  Try doing Siren's Reef with a single-target DPS composition, a lack of cleave/boon-strip and resistance.  Have fun.
---
Imho agony is there to simulate gear progression
---
Has it really been 311 days without a new Fractal? That is just too long.
---
Relative to other mmos it was very good. The base infrastructure in its separation from the PvE side of the game is well designed. The combat is smooth. Its issues were that ongoing development focused in the wrong areas: no other game modes; ranked pvp seasons were done far to late etc etc.
---
Hey, thanks.  That looks fun.  It's a really long video and it's been long enough since I've played I have no idea what I'm looking at, though.  I will try to find some other resources.
---
How dare you disrespect shattered observatory
---
Sure but the game would still be better off than it is now.
---
Well, there's 25 dungeon explorable paths, and the fractal panel has 26 slots, 25 fractals plus the random slot. Why not making tiered level 80 versions of all dungeon explorable paths? Fractal dungeons.  
---
It would take less resources since the models and voices are all recorded, and it'll give a new life to dungeons.
---
* First, they could move the story paths to actual story, like how they did to Victory or Death, so people don't get to the last mission after forgetting about Destiny's Edge. 
---
* Then, make the Explorable paths account-wide unlocks too so players only need to play the story once to have the explorable modes unlocked for all characters. 
---
* Finally, since there's 25 explorable paths, it could be possible to make the fractal gate a hub point to them all, using the same interface as fractals since that panel has 26 entries. 
---
Players could walk to the fractal gate as usual, and they would get the fractal panel as usual, but there would be a new button to switch to a new Fractal Dungeons tab. There, filling the 26 slots in the lists, players could find all existing 25 explorable paths, plus an 26th entry to go to a random one. 
---
Better still,  the 25 explorable paths visited from the fractal gate could also get 4 tiers of difficulty set in a similar way to fractal difficulties, with instabilities and the like. With T1 difficulty being easier than the current dungeon difficulty, T2 just as hard, and  T3 and T4 being slightly harder with added mechanics in the final bosses, and maybe even CM that kills all the adds and clutter to focus only on killing the bosses.   
---
Then, fractal dungeons would give fractal relics, plus dungeon tokens instead pristine relics, and the dungeon vendor could get new items that can be purchased with those currencies, gold, and maybe other currencies like karma and matrices, depending on the item. Examples of possible 'new' dungeon rewards could be:
---
* Ascended gear with dungeon skins.
---
* Recipes to make novelty versions of dungeon tonics.
---
* Infusions that give effects seen in dungeons like the ghostly appearance of ascalonian ghosts.  
---
* A few new skins, like: 
---
 * Breathers skin versions of dungeon headgear like the Sorrow's Embrace helmets. 
---
 * Actually visible [spine guards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Back_item#Loot "spine guards"). 
---
 * Restored Orrian weapons, that look how they would have looked before they spent ages underwater and getting corrupted. 
---
* Items with alternate versions of dungeon skins, or recipes to craft them out of the original items, like:
---
 * Day-only and night-only versions of Ascalonian weapons.
---
 * Ghostly ascalonian armor with a dyeable ghostly glow. 
---
 * Clean and polished versions of the tattered council ministry armors. 
---
 * Actually golden golden wing weapons.
---
 * Aetherized nightmare court armors with dyable aether effects. 
---
 * Glowing yellow nightmare weapons, since we already have magenta and cyan weapons. 
---
 * Overloaded forgeman armor with dyeable flames and glowing eyes and flames coming off the glowing parts. 
---
 * Green glyphic/dark asuran weapons, as we have red and blue already. 
---
 * Flame legion armor with dyeable flames. 
---
 * Ignited flame legion weapons with flames and smoke coming off them. 
---
 * Kodan weapons that do not have ice. 
---
 * Icy Kodan armor.
---
 * Charged inquest armor with glowing neon edges and moving parts like ticking gears.
---
 * Green inquest weapons since we already have blue and red inquest/mystic forge weapons.
---
 * Purified Dragon's Deep weapons. Softened, rounder, white and gold. Without spikes and faces, so they no longer look like they are possessed by a demon.
---
 * Purified orr armor, that look what they may have looked before their wearers became risen, without bones, claws and spikes and the like.
---
Yeh it is there but its always grayed out. When I researched it trying to get that to turn on I think it only works when you have a compatible monitor like an old 3d monitor or TV. I read a lot of people no able to turn it on. I think Nvidia used to have some option to enable it but not anymore, I have AMD and there is nothing I can do it enable it.
---
I did W1 Trib 2 years ago (around 20min per run of all 3 levels) and W2 Trib last year, W2 definitly takes longer (around 40 mins per run)..
---
Everyone knows new fractals are after Alliances in WvW. 
---
Wait your turn!
---
so youre trying to pretend this isnt something worth complaining about? lol ok, lets just never update any of the core game modes, thats fine, everyone will leave your game except the 12 people who wear rosey glasses and dont do anything but RP in lions arch
---
wvw and pvp are in the worst state they ever been, if pvp is what you are looking for don't come back, you'll be dissapointed to say the least
---
Sounds like the good ol' Aegis system they had in Secret World!
---
The last few fractals were really unfun but that doesn't excuse the wait. I really hope that following the feedback thread we get something closer to 99CM which remains my most enjoyed fractal instead of chores like TO, Deepstone and Siren's Reef.
---
/s people.
---
Uhhh they are pretty core content right next to raids/WvW and PvP
---
0 days without a trip to the salt mines
---
CM? maybe. 
---
Raid? Enjoy your eternal slumber
---
Steal was never a gimmick it was always use as a way to land backstab / any skill that got an animation.
---
Steal blinding powder for rev, still dagger 5 for invi+easy invisible attack.
---
Using steal for dmge and condition application is gimmick.
---
Do you know what /s means
---
Yep called it. New meta will be defending the keep from the icebrood colossus. We'll need to use an ability to chain it down, maybe topple it so we can damage it. 
---
What do I win if I'm right?
---
I also recommend using the word "fun". Its a great buzzword no one would be able to take away from you, just  call someone **unfun** and you've won!
---
actually they keep on adding interesting stuff but hey i suppose everyone has it's own preferences. the game is better now than ever and i've been playing since day one.
---
the game changed but i suppose and hope your life changed in 7 years in the same way. you are supposed to have less free time and to be less interested in everlasting farming. not to mention the horizontal progress let you still play using what u got when u were younger.
---
the whole point of gw2 is this : it's a game for ppl which are skilled but have less time than 7 years ago. there is a reason for the dead of mmo as a genre compared to 10 years ago.
---
so i'm sorry but game it's ok. if u are leaving may i have your stuff ? if it's account bound sell and send gold it's ok to me
---
"I have to play the content to get rewards reeeeee"
---
"I rushed all day one to get rewards, why no content reeeeee"
---
&gt; We'll need to use an ability to chain it down, maybe topple it so we can damage it. 
---
Gonna have to harpoon it and ~~snow speeder~~skimmer around it in circles.
---
If people start comparing Fractals to dungeons i loose all respect for them. If you have ever played dungeons on a high level you will know that Fractals play very very different to your Basegame dungeons.
---
I think it would be fine as fractal if:
---
- bosses werent so boring, generic spark, spider, minotaur and last boss is just generic dude. 
---
- none of the fights really have any mechanics. spark has tornado and last boss has to be spammed with special key off cooldown (which kinda makes it meaningless)
---
- it had follow up fractal like they did with chaos, nightmare and SO
---
What ya gonna do, cancel your subscription?
---
Arenanet are amazing at gathering feedback, still not sure what they do with it tho....
---
Yep.
---
What's the rush to have the next thing literally everyone else will also soon have.
---
FIXED. FOCUS. CONCENTRATION!
---
Temporary content isn't inherently bad if you implement it in a intelligent way. Especially if it actually moves the world forward. They just have no ability to sanely release ongoing content in any model.
---
no. gold sink is easy.
---
gen 1 and gen 2.5 (the one without story) are boring and easy legendaries.
---
but those with collections like astralaria or nevermore are weapons u deserved.
---
gold it's really easy to farm. u do daily fractal and it's 20 gold easy a day . it's 600 gold a month. ucan get a legenary every 4 months without no hurry playing 2 hours a day. 
---
only stupid stupid gold sink it's the mystic coin since u can't farm those yourself. which is so plain stupid
---
&gt;  If you don't have an experienced healer on something with strong condition cleanse like an experienced Firebrand and an experienced Renegade to provide condition buffer via Kalla Heal/Elite? Not a fun instability.
---
Or, like, switch shiro with horse and turn on bubble for a second when a HUGE TRIGGER FOR BIGBOY WBF happens. I happened to play rene in today's run and did just that. Unfun? What? It made me make a minor change in my build and press a button on a timer, omg. 
---
Also shitty, ahem, "inexperienced" people should rightfully suffer. This is t4 fractals, pretty much the hardest 5ppl content in the game, if they don't have experience for it, they can always go and do some t3s. Or t1s.
---
Nice, my troll quickdraw lb4 ranger just evolved!
---
Why does this boss remind me so much of the ice giant from the Barbie and Nutcracker movie?
---
It was datamined. It's coming. Be patient. Tuesday is almost here
---
In the other trailer there was chains right?  Wondering/read as expecting it to be like several other enough chains stop it from moving briefly mechanic.
---
Just buy it in the gemstore, 4head
---
Hi Cameron. Sorry for the 'Necro, but I've finally got some time to write some responses!
---
What aspects of these keep you coming back?
---
1.  Boss fights! I like it when GW2 tells its stories via gameplay instead of narrative.  I think that the dungeon-style narrative experience that you guys like to put out works well for casual T1/T2 players and feels like "forced roleplay," for more experienced players; especially those of us that do 99/100cm.  
---
2.  I like that there are consistent damage mitigation methods; stability, aegis, reflects and tons of attack patterns.  They're very well-structured fights with well-defined phases and can be optimized for in creative ways.
---
3.  I like the integration of break-bars and the opportunity for "fast-breaks" such as at the Ensolysus opening.  I think that initial break-bar really gives experienced and motivated groups an opportunity to "flex" on the boss and feel rewarded for an abnormal amount of coordination.  
---
4.  Normal 99/100 feel "tame" to me; I like a little more "chaos" than normal now; and typically play in 50-100 essence groups.  I think that mechanics that are open to everyone and pressure players like temporal anomalies are outstanding.
---
5.  I like the chance of dropping some of the chase drops like the Blue/Red Celestial Infusions and being able to exercise enough consistent mastery over the Fractals to help other players earn "The Archdesigner" or "Leaves No Heroes Behind."  
---
What do you wish was different?
---
1.  This is a tough question.  I think that Mama is far more difficult than Ensolysus; and while thematically, I'm fine with going from normal Ensolysus to CM Ensolysus; I felt that CM Ensolysus is a little lacking in-terms of boss mechanics.  
---
1.  I think that Chrono/Druid really got shafted by balance patches.  They need some FoTM love man! Whether we're talking about instantaneous quickness/alacrity relative to Firebrigade or the lack of Stability they feel almost ancient/inferior to Firebrigade which has extreme adaptability via Revenant Legends and innate Guardian Utility. 
---
2.  Generally not a fan of mechanics that punish lower DPS groups or force them to run a Sabetha-esque "Kiter." I think that they basically remove one-player from the fun and detach them from their ability impact or support their group. 
---
3.  I wish the arena damage on Artsari IV was a little dialed back and there was an "extra" mechanic instead.  I think that a lot of groups that try the CM get stuck on Artsari IV indefinitely because they don't have the DPS to push phases.  
---
5. I wish there were more rewards for Cosmic Essences to display experience, mastery &amp; prestige.
---
What could we have done better?
---
1.  I think allowing players to "prep" bosses is questionable (eg; Mama Knights + Siax).  I think a mini-boss should be integrated into the encounters and that players shouldn't be able abuse Mistlock Singularities quite as much in CMs. 
---
2.  I think certain AoEs such as smaller, expanding "burn" circles on the 66/33 Skorvald are too inconspicuous.  I see players get hit by these all the time for upwards of 15-20 stacks of burning and losing their singularity isn't fun. 
---
3.  I think demonstration of the Nova Launch + Marble Mechanic could be done by an NPC ahead of time? I see players that don't understand that they can Nova Launch vs. "Running" the marble all the time.  It makes me sad inside. 
---
4.  Embracing Consumable CC via some sort of extra-Fractal specific reward or "benefit" would be amazing.  Having to click in my bag for planks, metal rods, peg legs, rifles and other various consumables is a little awkward.  Hotkeys?
---
5.  Arkk - It should not be possible to fail the tower mechanic multiple times and phase Arkk to 70%, 40% or kill him.  Groups struggle with the "clockwise" strategy all the time, and a nudge or suggestion how to handle the mechanic in the normal version of the Fractal would go a long way; whether we're talking little clock-wise arrows or some dialogue. 
---
What did we do well?
---
1.  The Fractal CMs are very structured boss fights.  Mama is an absolute BEAST and absolutely sets the standard for a Fractal Boss that isn't afraid to get up in your face and go full Dark Souls on you (especially her Leap Slam/Shockwaves!).  I like that she's phase-centric in 99cm, but I think that it's too easy to torch her in the regular variation of the Fractal and this results in difficulty adapting to the challenge mote version.  
---
2.  I like the emphasis on pattern-based (bullet-hell) altars as a filler mechanic (especially used in 66/33 phase @ Ensolysus).  I think it's a great way to introduce agony to players @ T1 24/25, but that some sort of help box should pop up if players die due to taking agony damage; as gear progression via AR isn't super intuitive!
---
3.  I like that there is "carry potential," for the 66/33 split-phases at Ensolysus; biding out time and catching blue orbs.  It always feels great to carry people through the CM variants; and it's super satisfying for brute-force to be a mistake vs. patiently learning the phase, patterns and blue-cycle for sustaining until the circles can all be capped. 
---
4.  I like that it's possible to use Night/Serpent Slaying/Krait-Slaying/Power Potions of Scarlet Slaying for free damage.  I think that being able to do little things to optimize your gameplay outside of Mist-Pots &amp; Stat-Infusions is awesome! 
---
5.  I think that both 99/100cm feel very fair for the most part; they have very well documented combat-logs.  I really like Fractals where mastery of the special action key is fun (Enhanced Reflexes, Nova Launch) and scales.  I think the scaling of Nova Launch as a powerful skill is lost on people in lower/nonCM tiers, but that it's a super cool upgrade progression!
---
I have to disagree here, There is no way for you to better gauge the situation then arenanet who has access to all the data. Your conclusion comes I'd imagine from feedback and other people you talked to which is a very limited dataset, under a 1000 I'd guess. While Arenanet knows exactly how many people tried it, how many failed to finish it and how many times they tried and perhaps still didn't manage to finish it after x times only to never come back. 
---
Of course thats assuming they were genuine with the reason they gave!
---
Well you're generalizing a bit here, like edge of the mists was simply introduced as stop gap to give WvW players something to do if there was a queue to get on actual WvW maps. That and perhaps to entice people who where using wvw to farm karma to move there, freeing slots for people who wanted to do wvw more seriously. Wasnt exactly abandoned just had one limited purpose. 
---
Guild halls I wouldnt say they're abandoned either, true last new guild halls we got was with the release of path of fire, but they still release new decorations from time to time. Besides we dont exactly need a new guild halls every year. Those maps are pretty large and take considerable resources to make, I'd rather they focus that on more meaningful content!
---
As for hardcore world bosses well hopefully strike missions will take that role and personally I think that would be a good thing because while open world bosses are fun the hardcore version have a big issue thats a bit hard to fix. IF you're not early and get to join one of the main maps chances are you'll end up in a relative small group that has no realistic chance of winning and from there things will spiral down with people giving up and moving away ensuring that you have no chance of at least building up strength just in time to actually win, though realistically that would be a long shot. 
---
They did make mistakes too ofcourse, not saying they're perfect but you are being a little too hard here in my opinion.
---
Put it on the table
---
So basically the same ability you use to stop the rampaging Hydra in PoF.
---
It was shit.  It looked cool but it wasn't engaging and the final boss is arguably the worst one in the game.
---
What?   
---
Those are (maybe) wendigo, leshy, and an OP mage who looks that way only because he wants to.
---
Learn more about ‚ÄúWhisper in the Dark‚Äù gameplay on tomorrow‚Äôs episode of Guild Chat! **just dont ask about PVP/WVW AND FRACTALS THX!**
---
So again, who would be bot redeeming boosters?
---
Siren's reef was such a colossal failure it actually fooled some into thinking that it was well designed. You don't design a fractal which goes in the opposite direction of all of the other ones since you're supposed to do all three daily fractals in a row. Siren's reef's only purpose is to be a pain for meta-builds groups. At least when I look back everytime they make a new fractal, I start thinking that the previous one is so much better!
---
I must refrain myself from listening to it, it is way too good and I become incredibly nostalgic everytime. That Factions OST is something. Shame we never went back to Cantha...
---
Why would that be?
---
Sorry, but by the time a player has accumulated the required amount of ascended armor, weapons and accessories to be viable in T4, they should be familiar with how the GW2 wiki works, and be able to get that information for themselves.
---
That doesn't excuse ANET's lack of in game information, but I highly doubt there were hordes of players buying +11 infusions off the TP without knowing they could get by with +9's
---
As a new player, I can't wrap my head around how people seem so concerned about declining profits, and people leaving leaving the company; and yet they complain so much about having to buy anything. 
---
It's like the fact that we're all customers, and they have to pay their employees to make this game, is completely lost on them.
---
If by GoT you mean the story north of the wall, then kind of?
---
Honestly with t4s and recs you will have the omnipotion much faster than u think.
---
Is there a way that you could have it so that a user could have there own set of favorite waypoints listed off to the side? Say 5 or 10 that one might like to keep handy for gathering and dailies? Or maybe the last 5 or 10 that were copied? With the same one-click copy functionality?  Nicely done.. definitely bookmarking this.
---
&gt; 1) I don't think you can get level 80 white items. You'd be on Green or Blues.

Can't waiting for an engaging gameplay icebrood construct provides. I expect Oasis Pinata complexity.
---
Next fractal is going to be a quaggan fractal that will be 2 minutes long. I'm calling it.
---
I agree with you OP. It's a pretty poor decision on their part. 
---
Devs I wish we knew what was going on over there. I feel management aka Anet and ncsoft are fucking up big time with all of this shit going down. 
---
Who is making these asshat decisions?
---
From the season trailer and this, it's pretty clear they're taking inspiration from GoT.
---
They already have the disappointing climaxes down to a T so they're not too far off before they even began!
---
This sounds so sad.
---
Assuming GoT was original itself in any way.
---
Be a daredevil and add unblockable to that list.
---
I know you meme but that would be incredible
---
&gt;What do I win if I'm right?
---
The ability to fight it again in the Strike Mission afterwards, complete with a svanir dude hiding inside its chest that bursts open.
---
It's gonna be a moving jumping puzzle where you have to poke a spot somewhere around it's body! Cheers if you get the reference.
---
Lmao you're making an ass of yourself. It stands for sarcasm
---
If a player has reached T4 then obviously they're familiar with the system. What you're saying is silly.
---
A player starting out does not know how many infusion slots they will eventually have. A new player does not necessarily even know the wiki exists. A new player is not someone who has already been playing the game for years.
---
And the AR system does not add anything meaningful to the game, either. It's literally a number gate that baits people into spending more gold than they have to.
---
He explained that. I‚Äôm an ass for not knowing reddit lingo, that‚Äôs really cool :)
---
Elite specs are just optional subclasses that alter the base profession's mechanic is a variety of ways.
---
You can still use all weapons, skills, and traits from the base profession but some options are exclusive to elite specs.
---
However, you can't use 3 base profession specializations (traitlines) because the 3rd specialization will always be your elite specialization line. This is a big reason for not playing with an elite spec, if you choose.
---
Just prepare yourself with harvest jumping puzzles right now. From time to time. And you'll be ok.
---
I'll add that Taco is a very usefull tool when you're discovering the paths. 
---
Then it'll be a matter of memory and reflex.
---
Oh, don't forget the infinite coin. Even if you're good enough, and don't really need it, this item can make your stress go away. 
---
Good luck and have fun with these collection. (-:
---
I didn‚Äôt run out... I got busted by Quiznos corporate. I tried to answer everyone‚Äôs dms explaining the situation. Sorry you slipped through the cracks.
---
We DON'T know how this freedom will be used, though? We have only had the prologue, which was just to tide us over til the Saga started. Which will be the 19th. If they haven't even started on the 'not-season' proper, how can you say that you know exactly what they're gonna do with it re: fractals and such??
---
And there was literally only ONE asshole. Literally one.
---
Yep its actually not worth using multiple equipment templates with legendary equipment. Its just functionally poor design. And its coupled with the unbelievably bad redesign of the stat swapping UI making it even worse. Who approves these changes at EAnet?
---
It's okay, at least we lost our minds together. Just remember OP, the TacO guide markers are your best friend.
---
You have a few options. 
---
**Ingame:**
---
* Ingame supersampling + smaa/fxaa
---
**Amd drivers:**
---
* Morphological aa
---
* Radeon image sharpening
---
* Virtual Super Resolution to 1440p or 4k (the best solution imo, but it requires a bit more than what the Rx 580 can handle, specially at 4k)
---
**ReShade or GW2Hook**
---
* Inject Anti Aliasing and sharpening effect
---
I feel like on an emotional level.
---
install gw2 taco + tekkit for the guides to help learn it quick.  Bind dodge jump to an easy to reach key.  Once you do that, its pretty easy to get the achievements.  I did both sets in 1 year.  Although, it did require some extra grinding on the weekends as I couldn't do a full clear every night.
---
* Land Claimer - any "Flag", even Edge of the Mists.
---
* Monument Claimer - capture points in middle of non Desert maps
---
* Guard killer - any 5 non animal ncps from any tower, keep, camp, etc. even Edge of the Mists
---
* Camp - can be taken solo in off hours any Borderlands
---
Maybe instead of putting out 2 fractals and 1 raid a year. They want to do a strike mission with rotating bosses every episode. #feelsamazing #somuchcontent #fractalgodwaitingforfractal
---
With the leaving of Crystal Reid she kinda left us a hint on what is going on with Raids, fractles and dungeons IMO. They don't seem to be getting a shit worth of time by Anet. This is what she said: 
---
"I moved out of creative development over two years ago is why I haven't had a lot to say here in a while. I suspect that trend will continue, such is the life of management. Go forth and be excellent to each other"
---
The part about "I suspect that trend will continue" makes me think she drop a hint on that kind of content is being developed. If you want raids, fractles and dungeons to be updated. I'm sorry but the outlook does not look good. 
---
I think they are moving towards strike missions to take over. Which is a big shame and a really bad move on their part IMO. For vets it's looking grim as fuck. But for new players you are ok. 
---
New players still have a couple of years worth of gameplay even if no updates happen from 19th onward. The community is still strong with new blood coming in. The game is freaking awesome just not a lot of loyalty on NCsofts part. Not sure about Anet as we are always in the dark about inner politics. 
---
So if you've never played gw2 before I highly recommend it. To me it's the best MMORPG on the market right now. But if your looking for a competitive game GW2 has lost its edge and doesn't seem it will ever get it back. 
---
It's quite distressing to know what a good game NCsoft/Anet had and how much they f*** it up. I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about the devs. I'm talking about the mismanagement of GW2 by NCsoft and Anet. 
---
Their marketing is one of the worst campaigns I've ever seen in ANY product. How marketing still has their jobs and so many good developers don't is beyond me. If they paid me WA State minimum wage I would have given them a way better marketing campaign. All I would need to do is spend and hour Googling shit. 
---
Most of the distress that the Guild Wars 2 community has can be linked back to NCsoft management and Anet management (still unsure how much is Anet's part) making very poor decisions. After Reid's comment I have very little to no hope GW2 will ever live up to it's potential or  ever be truly competitive.
---
Not sure how to natively get this in Twitter, but here's a slightly better version: https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1195080672081170432/pu/vid/1280x720/5OcCt3Rrgk6JZszk.mp4 (720p)
---
Guards are at camps or at sentries. Taking out a camp is usually a good way to get all the npc guards at once.
---
 Soloing towers and keeps is generally going to be a hard task, and definitely a time consuming one. Building the siege by yourself to get in will definitely call attention to you. And taking out a keep lord solo is possible, but a specialised task for sure. If your home tower on any BL is not owned by your side you can usually get some help by asking in team chat to help take back your home tower. A couple of people can take a tower relatively easily as long as there's no response from the enemy.
---
Sure, but I feel the focus has more of an impact. Look at guild wars 1. The game was ground up made to be a skill building pvp game with no pve. Late in development they decided to make pve, so did they do normal pve? They decided to make all pve instanced with small groups of curated monsters using mostly player skills, the closest to pvp they could make it.
---
The whole game has extreme focus and that's why it was so well received and why it still has so many players.
---
Additionally you can just look at other Japanese titles with a lack of focus that are subpar, and likewise with Korean titles that lack focus.
---
Such an `u n d e r r a t e d g e m`
---
Yes and no, since ascended gear is stupid easy to get once you start doing end game content so having something ontop of that is nice. It also keeps fractals more profitable
---
It was clear to me 5 months after launch that the manifesto was bunk.
---
[I remember one old game..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVNcmGjNW6c)
---
Lol that's not story content so Anet doesn't care.
---
I think they had to sell the table.
---
Most people who think this is not a problem will overlook it and then come back years later, crying, when they finally realize how trash the system is because they are finally able to afford multiple legendaries.
---
Well if we compare to the dirts and other props around, that giant doesn't seem *that big*... Well definitely not Shatterer/Tequatl worth of big. Taller than a giant, maybe twice one at most I'd say. So I'm not sure if it really required new technologies for that one.
---
Darn, of course, rookie mistake!
---
Such thing exist for SAB too, but those are the ‚ÄùCrimson Assassin‚Äù weapons, which are the red version of the super weapons. You can only get about 4 each year depending on which weapon you choose.
---
It's just the skin. Fashion Wars 2!
---
Aye, sorry we are not smiling, waving our hands and yelling that everything is fine and that nothing is mismanaged. Criticism and complaints are evil indeed!
---
It's more fun to imagine what he said.
---
I loved the mobility built into GS back when I played it. GS/Rifle Warrior was my jam back pre-HoT. #SkillShot
---
I suspect that trend will continue
---
surely is referencing the fact that she will be in a management role in the new company as well, and will not have much to say about specific design decisions.
---
...A bot?...
---
What do you think how those bots work and what the maker of these bots think? 
---
"Hey, there is a new code for boosters, I will make a bot that scan only for these codes" or what? 
---
They write one bot that grab **everything** that looks like a code. And then they try to redeem these codes everywhere they can redeem codes. For GW2 it's at creating new accounts or ingame at the gemstore (redeeming gem codes or item codes). 
---
A booster package might not their main target, sure, but this won't stop bots from grabbing and redeeming them anyway.
---
It's mostly about cosmetics.  You can select any stat on bladed armor from Verdant Brink which *is* useful for more difficult to acquire sets like Diviners, Commanders, Minstrels, Trailblazers, Vipers -- stuff like that.  Unfortunately, ascended gear isn't a huge upgrade either; weapon damage improves about **10%** but most armor pieces are like 2-3% each; so if you want gear progression this really isn't that sort of game -- the impetus is on you to get better as a player.
---
I still think that, considering the mechanics, the deepstone boss must have been a trashed raid encounter.
---
inb4 it's an outfit.
---
I see. Then that would make most of what I said was moot on that part lol. My feelings on the matter are still the same though. As in outlook doesn't look good. Thanks for chiming in.
---
Its usually still not enough though. Double Despair.
---
Idk, if it'll help but the wiki does have this page [List of chat link codes for Waypoints and POI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link_format/0x04_codes) . And I know the wiki does have a Spanish version. Perhaps you can go to the Spanish version of this and copy the names?
---
You're aware you can farm gold -&gt; gems right
---
The future is brain dead strike missions, forgot these old systems of raids and fractals!
---
I don't care about more ice gloves (there's a bizarrely large number of them already) but that helmet looks amazing
---
Looks like a strike mission room so probably one of them. What I'm most looking forward to is the s'mores roasting camping kit.
---
Lol, typical you guys can't take criticism when you're so fond of dishing it out.
---
Not saying you can't be unhappy and complaint. But it's one thing to let A-Net know you're unhappy with something and constructively telling them they're doign something bad and it's another thing entirely to act like little bitches. 
---
Might as well as call this sub /r/gw2whinylilbitches.
---
But, what the fuck do I know? I'm just a A-Net shill, white knight that gets paid 8k gems a week just to come and praise the sun.
---
Now you contradict your self. You specifically told me we are talking about one character and not what you get from all others. 
---
Either way at this point i lost interest in this topic because you keep on changing it so i just agree that we disagree.
---
Stop getting me so aroused.
---
What about "surprise mechanics"? EA would love this guy.
---
a little bit about the skin, but moreso because that armor is stat-selectable.  you can use it on a power class that is looking for 'zerker gear (Power, precision, ferocity) or a healer that needs other different stats.
---
once you select the stats you can't change them, but you can get another stat selectable copy by tier 4'ing the map again.
---
I have wanted to see some bosses with breakable parts that can disable certain attack or put the boss in vulnerable state for a while, I don't think that will be this but would be awesome if it was.
---
You're talking to a brick wall.
---
Game has been dead for years.
---
It's nonsense. You swap from your PvE build to your PvP build back and forth without issue.
---
Use keybinds.
---
They decoupled the build templates and allow people to assign them as they please. You can just have a template for PvP and swap to that for PvP.
---
If you're going into this game focused on ever increasing stats, man are you going to be disappointed. 
---
Top stats are easy to get. Specific skins, on the other hand, which unlock on your entire account, are what sells most things.
---
You'll often find 2 or 3 things in the trading post with the exact same stats and wildly different prices. The prices are almost always based on 3 things: the skin, whether you need it for an achievement, or what sigil or rune you can salvage from it.
---
In most games stats are the be all end all, but this is more of a skill based game, in that how you execute is at least important (and some would say more important) than your stats.
---
Every class "is" viable in PvE depending on your build
---
Zerker gear is probably cheaper to buy off TP if you are looking for those stats. You want to use that for stuff like Viper's
---
[Still applies](https://imgur.com/gallery/2qMRlXX)
---
Implies mismanagement, then.
---
Well considering Halloween existed in those last two months and tons of people farmed the labyrinth, I'd guess that's what most people were doing.
---
I was doing a lot of stuff, including catching up on achievements in the new zone, getting multiple alts through because I do that, and all the halloween stuff.
---
Halloween came with a couple of new races, but also two new weapon collections for a shield and greatsword.
---
Plus I made a couple of legendary weapons.
---
&gt;  Hero Points on HoT 
---
Sure, as with all classes. But solo? Nope. You can only tank so much until the tools given to you for self sustain ( [Invigorated Precision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invigorating_Precision) and [Signet of Malice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Malice) in particular) lose their effectiveness.
---
&gt;  end content on raids 
---
Yep. Both power and condition based builds, though condi is more niche.
---
&gt; How actively (or not) were you in game? 
---
I'm on the *"*not" part, just saying.
---
However, if no one every bought gems and then used those to buy gold, gems would continue to cost more and more gold over time.
