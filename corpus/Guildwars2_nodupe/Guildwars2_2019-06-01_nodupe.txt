Mostly only good for some WvW builds. It used to be good in PvP when it had significantly more total stats than other amulets, but has since been nerfed to mediocrity. It's basically useless in PvE.

Every map is basicly an island.
---
They even pulled them after the boss was broken jifdnfgdln
---
A lot of people were expecting a true flying mount. So because it's slower than the griffon it gets written off.
---
The rabbit was actually buffed!
---
Yes.

---
If somebody has something that bothers them, triggers them, whatever, and someone blows it off or worse actively derides them for it that person is an asshole.
---
"You haven't suffered enough for me to treat you with kindness" is an astonishingly awful mindset.
---
But do you love this Marius guy or not!? 
---
Who cares about Anet
---
How do you know they're writing a ticket on you
---
There's no safe investments in GW2. You will always risk it. It's part of the game. 
---
Sorry, but at any moment they may decide to do an update like making dyes account bound that ended up with dyes so cheap they had to become salvageable, for the sake of making them more accessible.   
---
The reason I suggest things like that is because I beleive they are plausible and would make that content fit better spirit of GW2.
---
This is not me 'suggesting' things to be like that. It's me explaining to you how inevitable it has always been. Even before they did things like adding quest in pre-ascalon so people could get  Legendary Defender without death-leveling, ot adding Heroes in GW1. 
---
You can panic all you want, but me suggesting things like that or you speaking against them won't make it happen any sooner or later. But it's bound to happen sooner or later, as it has always happened. 
---
GW2 is not the kind of game in which things will stay working for the 1% forever. Sooner or later a dev will go "Well, the few had their fun, time to let the other kids play" and change some things a bit to become more accessible or reasonable, while adding other new things to be the next rare shiny to show off.
---
Why can't you just enjoy it while it last, then let others have their fun too?
---
I'll tell you why.
---
**GREED.** 
---
It is eating you inside.
---
Fight it. Get rid of it. You will enjoy things more without it.
---
Haven't you learned anything from the Lego movies?
---
&gt; Given that Polyreverberating and Mystic Infusion relies on post-processing, that's pretty much a given.
---
Do you mean to work together, because I can see the poly-reverberating effect without postprocessing on, thought same would apply to mystic infusion.
---
Reason I had thought post processing was on was because of the glow the snow on the cliff was giving off on the left side of the image.
---
I've only played a bit of Elder Scrolls, so I can only parrot what I've heard from friends who play both. The general consensus of my friends is that the single player experience in ESO is probably better, but it does feel more like a single player game, when doing stuff in the open world. 
---
Guild Wars 2 excels at a completely different type of experience. You always feel like there are people around doing the same sorts of things you're doing. 
---
Both seem to be good well liked games with strong and weak points.
---
who said i dont like gw2, he asked which is better and i stated my opinion if you dont like it that's ur problem not mine
---
Thanks! Yeah I totally get the logarithmic feel to stats. I’m planning to crunch the numbers with a few ideas for builds. And yeah, my elementalist is the short range facemelter kind. Lol. Thanks for your advice!
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the advice! I also really appreciate the history/story too. Makes sense. Thank you! This helped a lot.
---
I am not dev of this addon, so I believe you should face this feedback to him. I *think* theres a feedback sorta page at his github, not sure tho, might wanna check.
---
If you come to a point where you can't enjoy leveling in the game. It is perfectly fine to use a 80 boost. It is perfectly fine. With level scaling, all zones, including ones that you are outleveled, will remain forever relevant. 
---
&gt;It’ll screw up your learning curve.
---
You can just learn while being 80 and asking questions in the guild. Just do map completion and run around in the explorable world. You have more freedom in experimenting with builds.
---
&gt;Because then you will post one of the many "I used the lvl 80 boost, what do I do now?" posts that regularly appear here. 
---
If you find yourself asking this question, here is what you can do:
---
The first and main thing you can do is **Level up your mastery.** When you are level 80, you have a new exp bar called the [Mastery system](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery). The primary purpose of the mastery is that You unlock abilities such as auto-loot. You can level it up with exp and it is account-wide. What you also need to know is that you have to go out and find [mastery points](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery#Mastery_points), which is what you will need in order to progress further for mastery. You can find the location of where to get mastery points by looking through your achievements, which is done by pressing H -&gt; clicking on achievement tab -&gt; Looking for the red dots that look like [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Mastery_point_%28Central_Tyria%29.png/20px-Mastery_point_%28Central_Tyria%29.png). 
---
You can level up your mastery by getting experience. This can be done through:
---
* Exploring the world. If you are lost, just hold W, and see where you end up.
---
* Do every random events you find.
---
* Do Map completion such as finishing hearts, finding vistas and PoI, do the Hero point challenges.
---
* Do Dungeons.
---
* Kill everything you see.
---
* Mine/chop/gather everything you see.  
---
* Completing the personal storyline.
---
Basically, the mastery system is the leveling system that you missed out by boosting.
---
for raids you want to reach 70,48% critchance, so you sit on 100% with fury (20%), banner (4,76%) and spotter OR food (4,76%).  
---
in fractals you get 10,71% critchance from pots if you sit exactly on 150 AR, so it would be 64,53% of you can only expect banners. if you can expect spotter or use the food, 4,76% less.  
---
now depending on if you can expect good uptimes danger time which is a 15% critchance increase, you can plan your gear accordingly depending on the content you want to do if you want to minmax for everything.
---
I use shift + keys around wasd + some imagination
---
Shift + R for raptor,  Raptor’s R...
---
Shift + D for bunny, cause it looks dumb 
---
Shift + S for skimmer, Skimmer’s S...
---
Shift + A for Jackal, Jackal’s A
---
Shift + F for griffon, griffin’s F
---
Shift + E for roller beetle, cause it escapes quick
---
Shift + C for skyscale,.. cause I ran out of keys!!
---
yep, not a stalker, you're just a very public figure and I have a good memory
---
Tahnnakai is one of my favorites, I always grab that mission on multiple characters every time I see it.
---
That is amazingly accurate!
---
Does scrapping unidentified gear end up with better rewards(selling on TP) than just selling the unID gear itself?
---
The infusions are worth it, but they're at the bottom of the to-do list due to the cost. 
---
If you don't have the omnipotion yet, do work on that one first. 
---
After that, go for account wide Mist Attunement upgrade. Or if you're itching for a legendary you can do that too.
---
Speaking as someone with 18x Malign infusions, while I enjoyed the dps boost, I wish I went for mist attunement upgrade first. Though I'm only at Fractal Prodigy atm, I've been getting more encryption chests than the daily 30 deeply discounted keys can open (T4 + Recs).
---
Tbf I farmed all my Stabilising Matrices, which is why it's taking so long for me.
---
As much of a KKC fan as I am, it's almost certainly just a lamp. Grow Lamps predate KKC by many, many decades.
---
Plague Signet is the most broken signet in GW2... See it that way, its a condition removal for allies arround you and its a condition removal for you too when you activate it. On top of that, necromancer is the master of condition transfer. You have plenty of way to use those condition to your advantage/Dps. You talk about a traits, the one transfer your condition to your minion and to mobs, that you didnt like. Mix hit with some minions+Plague Signet and you just create an amazing interaction that pull condition from your allies and dump them on ennemies really easily. 
---
Spectral Armor and Spectral walk have been change and no longer work exactly the same. One still be power damage protection but the other one is condition protection.
---
I do think this could help, although I do have many sets already.
---
But its already winter!
---
The way I see it, Vision is basically just an alternative way to acquire something like Aurora, but for PoF players.  It's more or less just "the Living World Season legendary accessory".  I think the **concept** of stacking two legy trinkets together to "rank up" the effect is a cool idea, but the way they've implemented it with the stupid lava lamp balls is crap lol.

Damn, that's sure to win some awards solely for the use of puppeteering alone
---
Harrier, because if you're taking a Renegade that isn't Condi, it should be in a Support slot.
---
I just finished getting up there and was disappointed not to see a tree on top of the tree... Or a quiet party.  Was one quite a trek though.

---
Every month or so the weapon sets rotate, and gem store offerings have both seasonal and weekly rotations. However, there's not any sort of pattern to it.
---
Did you really play Condi Scourge or Power Reaper?
---
If you didnt see the utility that those 2 build could bring to a group than you might start trying to deal with mechanics without relying on others.
---
What Condi Scourge could bring to the group: some barrier, condition removal, boon corruption,   Aoe burst with epidemy, block projectile, huge CC, some might and stable good Dps.
---
What Power Reaper could bring to the group: boon corruption, condition removal, block projectile, CC and good Dps. On top of that, this build is one of the only build to be able to keep permanent 25 might, fury and quickness. That make it one of the top solo Dps. On top of that, this build could bring a lot to yourself alone (more condition removal, stability, life gain, etc...).
---
Just compare it to some classic meta dps build like Thief, DH, etc... Yeah, those build could deal higher Dps but they bring nothing outside of there Dps. They need other in group to buff, help survivability and deal with some mechanics. In a group with only thief and 1 Reaper with similar experience im 99% sure that Reaper will be top Dps.
---
Self-survivability wasn't the only reason why necro couldn't be top Dps class. Its because he bring to much of everything. If necro was the top Dps class you wouldn't need other classes than necro.

---
With +5% damage increase to greatsword auto-attack chain 3? So we get punish even harder when we interrupt AA...
---
&gt;is the game still alive?
---
Yes. With zone scaling, you can return to the old levels anytime you want. 
---
&gt;The chat is tiny and I've enlarged the interface size and chat text as far as it will go, is there no other fix for this? Can I do fine without bothering with the chat for the most part otherwise?
---
Nope. 
---
&gt;I've looked up plenty of videos on the game including one of LazyPeon's more recent ones about the end game of the...game, lol, but, I would like more opinions from those of you who really play the game often.
---
I would like to get into this, but I don't have the time to list and explain them all. Here is a [wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame) on the matter. 
---
There is your traditional instanced group content, and there is a endgame for open world only if that is your thing.
---
&gt;I'm also kind of looking to be more of a casual player, I'm just coming off of a four month obsession with FFXIV and I want to try and pace myself a bit more now, as much as I can anyways before obsession may take over. That being said, is this game casual friendly at all?
---
Yes. 
---
&gt;How is the community in all? Friendly? Talkative? Inviting to newbies? Or more elitist.
---
Most will say Friendly. But there is a little bit of all types of players. Good ones and bad ones.
---
The thought occurred to me as well, but I'm about 99% sure it's just a coincidence.
---
I was planning on doing something like that, but I don't have the gold for the infusions yet. Eventually.
---
Western hemi-sosasafrasosphere autumn I assume.

To me, the human leveling experience has always been more mundane than that of the other races.

I figured it out! I changed my default input method to another language as the new Windows update allows. I thought this was an amazing new feature. I guess TacO doesn't like that, so I have to switch back when I launch it. Weird. I swear it didn't crash when I changed languages like this before.
---
What about CMs, how much harder is it to tank with the fireballs? Is the f4, SW 2, shield 4 enough?
---
I was thinking of video drivers, reinstalling things like directx and visualC. But glad you figured it out cause those were way off.
---
That makes more sense. :)
---
I'm not sure, that's the one I use.
---
&gt; I expected that it would be natural to run in the opposite direction of the Eater's life steal attack which would negate his ability to both deal damage and heal. 
---
Wooow, this is cool to find out about.
---
See, I always thought the fight was kinda tricky because I assumed the intended mechanic was to CC, but the CC bar appears very briefly, and only as the Eater performs an animation that looks like an attack that should be dodged. I realized that running away from the Eater during his life steal negates it pretty well and that makes the fight super easy, but somehow I always thought that was a cheese, maybe even unintended mechanic xP.

Thanks a lot for the incredibly insightful post! Great read.

To all the people trashing infusions in the comments: 75% of the “effects” and “glow” you’re seeing are from the armor and dye choices he’s made, not the infusions. The infusions in this case only affect his skin texture and the outline of his armor, everything else is a dye choice or armor effect.
---
17
---
I would take this seriously if it wasn't utter bullshit. For 1. Aurene was a major part of the story before Jessica Price even joined Anet, 2. Aurene consumed more magic than Kralk because she consumed Jokos magic. The commander comes back from the dead. Also the story has to be agreed by a whole team so maybe talk in facts and not spout rubbish because you don't like someone.
---
I have to say, I'm happy at least they're putting the effort now.
---
That said I also agree that we can relax and see the game going back to its glory; it's gocus on open world and story has ironically been its own demise. It's original and fun, but it's simply not sustainable in the long term.
---
If you don't encounter the ritualist boss with fomf.
---
&gt;Any males that are significant to the story are either mostly ignored (Gorik and Logan) or reduced to menial labor and alcoholism (Braham).
---
Where'd did Majory and Kasmeer go tho.
---
Found the incel! 😂
---
Most of the effects In this post are armor pieces and dye choices, NOT infusions.
---
I wanted to combo this as well. Too bad those shoulders were rng to get.. Or thousands of gold.
---
STOP
---
STOOOOOOOP
---
I’m a little surprised it’s halfway to the griffon numbers. I guess it’s not as bad of a trip as it looks
---
50% of the reason his outfit looks like that is due to dyes...the infusions he has on only alter the skin...
---
&gt;I have also not seen a marked improvement in communication
---
I agree with you on everything but this.
---
I have seen them a little less reluctant on communication than when Gaile was on charge.
---
However, I don't believe their current course is enough to prevent the boat from sinking.  The last patch was a step on the right direction, but it took a couple years too late. Problems with PoE meta events were talked about since launch, and there's no way in heaven a half decent development team wouldn't pull this out at least months after expansion launch.
---
We still have S5 to see what they do. At this point and with the rushed conclusion of S4, I hold my breath. I wouldn't even call it Living World anymore, as the maps and situations don't evolve.
---
I bet S5 will be the last shot Anet's got at revitalizing GW2, because I'm pretty sure NCsoft has them walking the plank. I'd love to see the game big, I have hopes after the lay offs, and with the current dedication they're giving to fixing the game, this will happen.
---
But knowing Anet's quirk of going one step forward and three back, I'd rather not have high hopes. I don't like to be dissapointed.
---
It really is not. Nothing about it is difficult or expensive. All you've got to do is invest some time and patience.
---
It is very unlikely to be related to an API key, if you look at the API docs you see the endpoint for traits and skills doesn't even need an API key, so it will most likely ignore the API key when you send one.  
---
However the image endpoints return a http status 500 "Internal Server Error", with the message: "file couldn't be loaded", please explain how this is even related to API keys? The only thing that could make it related to an API key is some form of ACL, but that would make no sense for those resources at all. And if it was to be related the problem might be the browser doesn't send any API-key to those endpoints.  
---
As for how long, no-one knows.  
---
TL;DR it's an issue with the API not the API key that has most likely nothing to do with it. no-one knows how long it will take them to fix it this time.
---
To the left, you have an elementalist, powerful beyond measure. To the other left, her human sister.
---
Or instead of being a dick about it you can actually be reasonable, because very, very few people with *real problems* care about losing 5 minutes in fractals. Very boomer attitude tbh. 
---
Give me even one good reason why we should pug without heals and massively increase the risk of wiping? Several wipes take more time than a mediocre but otherwise smooth single run. This is always the case. I have never once seen a full dps group no heals that was in any way smooth outside of dedicated speedclear groups that wouldn't pug to begin with. I cannot expect people I have never known and likely never met, and likely will never meet again, to all be playing at the same skill level. I cannot expect them to be comfortable with every single strat. I can, however, expect them to understand mechanics, compositions, and burst phases, more than the non-CM pug. I can expect them to want boons, which unless you prestack, will be hard to come by in non-healer groups. Might and fury especially now that every warrior pug is running power berserker over core. And if you prestack, you are then premeditated on having extremely fast phases. You're going to be disappointed half the time if you expect that with any pugs that aren't from hardcore guilds. 
---
&gt;because only noobs play on purpose with healers in fractals
---
By the same logic: only noobs play Reaper in fractals. Also fucking listen to yourself, do you really want to be that kind of awful, judgemental person? You *should* know how awful this kind of judgement makes people feel, according to yourself you identify as trans. Yes, I'm bringing that up, it's a false equivalent but someone who suffers as much oppression as you do should know *better*. 
---
Also I know for a fucking fact this isn't true, unless a fair chunk of the people I know are noobs. And if you fucking dare imply that they are - several of whom have participated in psuedo-hardcore stuff like the ARP -  and got pretty far - then you're fucking deluded. 
---
Fucking join discretize or something if your standards are this fucking high, instead of pugging and making weird demands, btw, very, very few people have 1300 KP. There are literally less than 10 people with that on gw2efficiency.
---
Running dueling, domination, chrono? I'd suggest sword/focus in open world for the pull when it matters, helps grouping and is more cleave than sword (though sword is still great for the block and single target damage). Phantasmal defender and calamity are good cleave damage options, let me mock up a build and edit it in.
---
Looking at the post, it seems like they said the 25K was from 2017, when around PoF came out. Compared to now though, I'm seeing 97,181 people who have finished the last griffon achievement
---
Yes please, which abilities do I prioritise when fighting?
---
Are they different for single and multiple mobs?
---
Which shatters do I use?
---
Do I shatter as soon as I got 3 clones?
---
Using the traditional [wordless MMO communication system](https://i.imgur.com/WAAsnnu.jpg).
---
So for a cupful of gold and airship parts you have another reliable source of exotics with a wide range of stats? I’m sure those who did matriarch on a daily basis would be willing to break out their crowbars.
---
Is there any place in game where I can brush up on the lore for the PoF regions. I need a primer on what exactly the deal is with these places (what the fuck is a Joko?) and I'd prefer to get that information in game than by wiki-diving or being told by another player.
---
This is by far the best suggestion in the thread tbh.
---
Harrier Firebrand is godly for carrying pugs, so it's settling into a 'pug meta' role for most pug runs that aren't chrono/druid. 
---
Pack Runes also work significantly better on a Diviner Ren than a zerk FB, as the Ren loses far less DPS, and might/fury/swiftness tends to be a bit spottier otherwise in fb/ren fractal pugs, especially as most pug warriors don't seem run PS.
---
Overall it's a very safe combo that works very well. It's effective at what it does and overall I think by far the safest combo that still brings offensive buffs. 
---
However, probably lowest on the totem pole of effective comps in terms of DPS. (Heal FB/Diviner Ren &lt; Druid/Chrono / Heal Ren/FB &lt; Chrono + 3 dps + bs &lt; FB/Ren + 2 DPS + BS, ordered from least to theoretical most. However, if you care about that so much, find a premade and don't pug.)
---
If you wonder why GW2 does not have the usual trinity structure, the monk strike is likely part of it.
---
For open world, it doesn't matter imo. I have run both and find them both effective and powerful.
---
because everybody else just see a bad attempt at humor which isn't worth commenting on
---
Checked it later and, indeed, that's the main mechanic XD
---
Shadow hunters on Netflix also has Guildwars references, both 1 and 2
---
I believe a lot of the lore we encounter in PoF was first told to us in Guild Wars 1. That being said, the first mission makes sense in terms of continuity from the S3 finale before it - there's no need to understand any lore about Elona for it to make sense - and once you get to the crystal desert, you can definitely find stuff out by exploring the map, talking to npcs, doing hearts and events, playing through the story, just exploring and trying to learn in general. Otherwise, I'm not sure there's any in game sources.
---
Seems we found out who Invisiman from Vabbi meta is :o
---
18 Infusionslösung Slots with +5/+9Agony are 90 stats in general and more stats in Fractals since the agony is transferred into stats by the potions. So in Fractals they are great! In Raids and Open world they are good!
---
I started three weeks ago and absolutely love it! The game is free to try out so no reason not to. So get in and and get convinced!
---
A build [like this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAsdRnsICtfiVqBGqBEgilUjq8DOhCo+Zr2rlcAKhAA-jhRBAB4pPAgnAAlq/Y8pA4q9HlfmpEEA-e) for greatsword would work. Feel free to alter it to fit what you like, mainly disenchanter is there for damage but you can swap that for more utility, can also take danger time if you're getting some source of slow. Also you can run x/sword, x/focus, or x/shield as your second weapon (but then swap burden to anguish or go illusions instead) or instead of the focus. Sword is more DPS and shield is more utility (2x long block + CC and boons).
---
Most of your damage comes from your illusions, you want to prioritize casting them, resetting them (with ether), and doing as much of this as possible inside continuum split. The rest of your damage comes from mirror blade, your F1 shatter Mind Wrack, and blurred frenzy in that order (with autos in there as well). In general for open world you want to pull the mobs together (or at least try to cleave as many as possible) and burst them down. For shorter and more casual fights you don't need to worry about any kind of rotation just try to use all your phantasm skills then reset them with heal if you need more.

If you wanted to go into more advanced DPS rotations you can get an idea of what that [looks like here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ER-QS1dWo). And even though the API is having issue right now you can get a better idea on power chrono builds here: [dT \(fractals\)](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer), [snowcrows \(raids\)](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/), [metabattle \(openworld](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Sword/x_Phantasms) + [other mesmer builds\)](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer).
---
More people will get it now as you need it for the legendary trinket. I mainly WvW and only the AP hunters from my server were going for it until we found out you would need it for the trinket. If it wasn't part of the legendary trinket collection I imagine most people wouldn't bother (from a non PvE perspective).
---
And soulbeast rangers
---
Necros base versatility is also a problem but that doesnt negate our utility problem. I am not saying our abilities are not fun to play and especially the corruption tree brings some of the best and satisfying things you can bring. That doesnt change that both reaper and scourge bring a shadow fiend because it is literally the least bad DPS option. My argument is for raids and fractals where you usually have a dedicated support class. I know you can bring additional utility instead even in those cases but I would rather have a +DPS option as well.

I remember seeing once an episode of some popular series a GW2 book or something, might have been on The Big Bang Theory, but not sure. I have seen it on the background of computers, or posters or books and others stuff in movies and series, so its definitely out there, just have to keep an eye out. It is like when you get this one item not many have, but suddenly now that you are aware of its existence, you actually pay attention to it when you come across it and remember it.
---
OH SHIT, it's THAT mission. Oh my fucking god, lmao. I don't remember how I did it to be honest, I just know my friend and I struggled to get it done.
---
According to efficiency only 62,088 (29.707%) have done “The End” which is the opening chapter of this episode.
---
Given its just effiency people its probably going to be more
---
Yea you should get the copper fed, silver is good only on rates and the price per use doesn't really make it worth it when you're salvaging trash gear.
---
Idk why you are downvoted
---
For max profit you need all 3 S-o-Ms. Green-&gt;Copper-Fed; Blue-&gt;Runecrafter's; Yellow-&gt;Silver-Fed; Gold-&gt;Black Lion Salvage Kit
---
Continuum split (CS) saves your current Hp, endurance, skills, etc and resets them to that value when you: run out of time, hit the skill again, die, or the rift is destroyed (never really happens). At a basic level all skills cast while inside CS are "free" and you want to use as many as you can. A more advanced trick is to start casting a skill (yellow bar that fills up means you're casting) and then before it finishes start CS so that they save time (didn't have to wait on the long cast) and still have the skill after (CS only checks if the skill is on cooldown when it starts and skills don't go on cooldown till after they fully cast). You can practice this by trying to fit as many skills as you can into a single split or just seeing exactly how long you can wait before hitting CS. Try looking at the rotations and doing them on the [training golem](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_Forces_Training_Area), keep in mind that in normal open world you won't have the quickness or alacrity to pull some of it off though.
---
Agree! The game has achieved a stage when it's almost impossible to have nothing to do. At the same time, the LFG is kinda of a huge categorized mess.
---
Lastly, (please don't take it as a personal attack, 'cause it is not; it's 2019 after all) if every commander would advertise their squad, if they are doing an open world event, then the LFG will be much more populated!
---
[removed]
---
the infusion, the backpack and the greatsword could really go so well together, why does the rest of that character have to look so eyecancerly aweful...
---
*Sweating*
---
&gt; They already have rather bad track record with GW2 of broken promises
---
They...do? The only thing I can think of is the Heart of Thorns set of legendary weapons, but even that we eventually got.
---
Could we... see your build/weapon usage?
---
It sounds like user error, not design error. I don't remember having an issue with scruffy 2.0..
---
Really? Well that doesn't make much sense since if you look that the story tab in LFG there's no groups, ever. Would have to spend hours finding someone. Even in a guild it would be hard to find somebody.
---
wait we are? i have done 100% of all the games story content solo, (replayed with friend/guildmates  for various reasons)
---
better git gud!
---
I was on the fence for trying out Diviner Soulbeast since the armour is hard to craft, but with easily accessible exotic pieces this got a lot more accessible.
---
except elite spec weapons
---
^This. Exactly this (oh except I play PvP lol)
---
I never got griffon since how useful is a expensive mount in the PvP outpost? (not very)
---
I went for skyscale since it’s perfectly timed for off season and free BUT then I found out I also needed it for the trinket so I’m okay with it.
---
I was working along easily with it and I even started the “vision quests” smoothly (even having never done a meta event ever!) only now I find there is a glitched quest as part of the “brandstone research” so you can’t finish “Vision of Istan” soooo yeah...
---
I also did all reward tracks so I didn’t think I would need ANY of the main AP achieves but nope anet got me again.. (stupid pve grind)
---
Now you can call me an AP hunter too because for the legendary trinket the one AP you can’t skip using reward tracks is Jahaii (“A Star to Guide Us”)... So PvP nor WvW players will get out of that one brother...... We all AP hunters now... freaking 38 of em’. 
---
*Fun fact: Thunderhead reward track does not show the item in preview BUT does reward the choice box upon completion (so you can skip thunderhead AP achievement box using reward track) so yes do the reward track not the living story FULL AP (holy crap that’s a lot of pve)
---
Anyway good luck finishing up your collections and trinkets and hopefully that helps (oh and if you see some lonely loser in full leg PvP armor failing at hunting AP... yeah that was me.. /sigh)
---
But one of these characters stows and draws his weapon. Do clones do that? I don't think I've ever seen them do that.
---
Sounds dumb but did you consume the recipethat gorrik have you?
---
This is why im hoping they find a way to let you hide the effects of the rings... like maybe ticking off one of them with downgrade it back to the previous level.
---
Yeah. Thankfully reward tracks get you a lot for both lws3 and 4 trinkets. I see the skyscale as the new Wayfarer's henge. I don't want either. Wont use either. But they will do them to get what I actual want eventually.
---
I just prefer to call them WvW exclusive skins rather than WvW lgendary armor. Same for PvP. While it's true that you can make legendary armors in both game modes you might probably just want the skin. If that's your goal the only problem is reaching the required rank since the currency you will get enough of it while getting your rank up.
---
But defense events in Orr do count...
---
I too like the prospect of a pet solar system
---
if that is true then the game might have lost "a bunch" of their most dedicated players, which is still bad. i suppose it depends on what you definition of a bunch is and how many inactive accounts there actually are.
---
It's really really awkward to fly, ironically especially in uneven terain (hitting flight height cap while being 1m above ground is just ridiculous). Does very few things the other mounts can't. There is really nothing that justifies the length of the colection. 
---
Dont get me wrong, i think the mount is fine and I think the collection is fine-ish. I just think the reward is not worth the effort, especially compared to the other mounts.
---
[deleted]
---
The series Chuck also regularly featured boxed GW1 versions in the background.
---
are you forgetting that skyscale has a nice "Mount 2" ability that works just the same ase the long horizontal raptor leap? You sure use the leap on raptor for speed right? Use it on skyscale too and it basically becomes a raptor on air with the advantadge that you don't have to switch to springer to bypass an obstacle since it's already built in on the skyscale.
---
copper fed + 250 charge [mystic salvage kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit) for rares all the way.
---
it is becasue gw2 api has issues. not websites themselves
---
"Fugly" wouldn't even begin to describe GW2's current aesthetic.
---
ask to escalate the ticket to the next higher up in a polite way.
---
The reason why people think this is because only having vision/aurora and not both after the patch gave your clones the duo effect anyways, but if you have both it gives your clones this effect.
---
It's therefore likely that this is a third part of the legendaries. Not guaranteed, just likely.
---
&gt;Found the Korean gamer. You are incorrect.
---
Jeez, you really know how to be robotic sounding.
---
Or that Ele boss whose aoes one shot half the squad, and he spawns with like 12 eles too! 
---
Without shelter it's instant wipe.
---
Really wanna play this mission now lol.
---
You perfectly captured the quaggan spirit &lt;3
---
I did. That was the first thing i did. Then i stumbled across this post and thought "it's worth a try".
---
I legit think that this ''bug'' is intentional.
---
 The Devs put this in game by '''''mistake'''''  to see what we say about it.
---
If the feedback is negative they willl say: Oh, yeah, that was a error in the coding, it was not suposed to be there, it wont make to the live version
---
If the feedback is positive they will say: Oh, yeah, we kinda by accident let the new trinket effect happen on mesmer clones, sorry about that, hihi xD enjoy the leak
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just my humble conspiract theory
---
These builds on Metabattle might be helpful for getting an idea of what works well.  
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Necromancer
---
Games lose dedicated players all the time. My sons played WoW religoiusly for years and then stopped playing dead. But they still go back for 3 months when an expansion hits.  
---
Saying everyone is going to keep playing the same game forever is at least naive. Some people leave because of changing life circumstances. Some leave because they find a new game. Some stop gaming and find new hobbies. Some people take long breaks. 
---
WoW went from 12.4 million people to under 4 million over a period of years that hasn't been as long as this game has been out. So it's logical some people play less or not at all. 
---
Saying a game loses a bunch of dedicated players is only bad of those dedicated players aren't replaced by new dedicated players.
---
This is still one of the more successful MMOs of the last decade. Pretty sure that the number of people who leave and return is pretty high because the barrier to return is so low.
---
I don't think you can compare an FPS to WvW. Besides, is PS2 still alive at all? When I quit a year ago or so, there were hardly any big fights left in that game.
---
Why did the story/characters/dialogue improve so much in LS4?
---
Check price, than salvage if you are not impressed, use any kit available. Orange kit if you want to remove the sig/run
---
join wvw &gt; portal to LA
---
get rekt economics
---
Your mailbox is full btw. When the mail symbol is red that means you have to delete old mail to be able to receive new mail. So you actually got even more stuff than you show in the video lol
---
Are you talking to eggs?
---
Thanks! How about runes and sigils specifically.
---
I noticed they are now all salvageable too.
---
Thank you kind stranger for giving me an excuse to watch this amazing series again
---
&gt; armour 
---
i'm also in favour of spelling this way.
---
to answer your op https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor#PvP_Components
---
You are traversing dozens of regions from LA to Istan, and even a considerable part of ocean. How do you think they should mantain the Waypoint network without that fair price?
---
Also, for real, 6 silver is too much when an event where you pet cows gave you one when you were a cub?
---
Pretty sure Istan has a portal scroll.
---
food + utility is probably that 2%,but even if full set was 1%  cost is completly bananas. 1% will not save anyone and your 1 mistake in rotation will completly negate whole 1000g+ investment. i whoud recommend it if you wana SPEEDRUN fractals CMs WITHOUT healer,other than than,its completly useless.
---
Sabotaging top comment.
---
I don't see what's the problem here. The first trinket offers 4 balls floating around. The second one makes those balls look like they try to divide from one another forming some structure. The third already formed something that looks like a support point for all the other points. You see the animation in the black sphere is somehow similar to the effects of two trinkets (aurora + vision for example).
---
Keep in mind that this is unfinished. More trinkets coming, this will get upgraded. I'm sure the end result will be quite amazing.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wrSjfMz.png
---
But that costs... stuff! He doesn't want to pay stuff.
---
Now everyone can easily run minstrel in raids to stay alive. xD
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Out of place, overly glowy. It doesn’t fit with the environment, or the general tone of GW2’s art direction.
---
&gt;Dont get me wrong, i think the mount is fine and I think the collection is fine-ish. I just think the reward is not worth the effort, especially compared to the other mounts.
---
Same as it was with the beetle, which was also awkward and borderline useless at launch. But then it got buffed and it's still niche, but in that niche it is awesome. I expect similar changes for the Skyscale.
---
Compensates for the AC poster up there.
---
Thanks for sharing. I totally missed that, and its pretty darn cool!
---
I did not played the game yet when legendary armor came, so I dont really know what happened there.
---
Maybe you are right, but it just too big of a mistake to go unnoticed, they may not change stuff but at least I think it serves some kind of purpose. We talking about professional devs, not a rookie company
---
Yes, there is an economy. Whether one could call it "thriving" depends on your definition, but you can definitely make money on crafting and selling stuff, if you know what to craft and when to sell.
---
You should probably just buy the portal scroll
---
So Anet should satisfy a few players wanting to annoy everyone else with overly expensive items?
---
What game have you been playing? Nothing in this game after base game "fit's with the environment". Even in the base game legendary weapons didn't fit in the "environment".
---
The Auction House is global though (except for Asia), making it much harder to corner a niche market than in many other MMOs
---
The elegy set is mvp of Fashion Wars in this LS season. Those light armor pants! Players have been asking for them for *years*. When you have a simple set, you can take any of the pieces and match with other skins much more easily and tastefully. Also Birthday armor sets were cool as well.
---
And then there's [this achievement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Star_to_Guide_Us_\(achievements\)#You_Can_Certainly_Try).
---
holy shite that's ugly
---
and only 5.655% have the skin and thus the mount unlocked
---
(Thereby Hangs a Tale)[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daybreak_(achievements)#achievement3972]
---
Wait for the ring then, this is the combined effect of all 3.
---
Also, if I remember correctly, Zombieland's protagonist was playing it in his appartment. Could have been WoW idk.
---
After you get all the legendary trinkets you can have a portable solar system following you around!
---
This is what [coalescence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coalescence),  [aurora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurora) and [vision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vision) look like together. This bug is showing up on mesmer clones with the current two legendary trinkets equipped (Coalescence isn't in the game for another few weeks at least). So once the new raid comes out you'll need all three to get this effect.
---
I should start playing mmo less for the loot and more for the story
---
He already is but is still asking for some reason.
---
&gt; The chat is tiny and I've enlarged the interface size and chat text as far as it will go, is there no other fix for this? Can I do fine without bothering with the chat for the most part otherwise?
---
You should toss this on r/criticalrole
---
This applies to anything in this game tho
---
Blinkprle
---
Infusions are now content, I guess. :/
---
So will the effect get even more crazy with the amulet from season 5 and the other ring from the next 3 raids of season 5 or will they have entirely new effect? And what about the runes and sigils?
---
&gt;but I do love crafting and selling stuff...
---
&gt;Can I enjoy with for a while without the expansions?
---
You need a paid account to sell most of the stuff in the trading post, btw, but aside from that you sure can enjoy it for a while.
---
Silver fed will make more likely to get rare material results from salvaging, like blood and bones. 
---
But it's so rare for anything except Globs of Ectoplasm and Reclaimed Metal Plates from Reclaimed weapons that you will actually lose money if you use silver for anything else.
---
The current best approach is like this:
---
* Black Lion Kit, or upgrade extractor and then a kit corresponding to the item without the upgrade: 
---
 * Item has a very valuable upgrade.
---
* Rare kit: 
---
 * Item can produce globs of ectoplasm.
---
 * Item has a Reclaimed weapon skin and you want Reclaimed Metal Plates.
---
* Runecrafters kit: 
---
 * Item cannot produce ectos and has an upgrade.
---
* Basic kit: 
---
 * Everything else.
---
Numpad keys can be bound differently than the number keys.
---
&gt; The first trinket offers 4 balls floating around
---
Many people, including me, simply do not like the first effect and there will be no alternative to it. The video most likely shows what Coalescence will look like with Aurora and Vision.
---
honestly i have no idea, I assume its still RIBA silverwastes, maybe some still farm in Istan (season 4 episode 1 map, was/is very profitable) maybe some play the latest map, dont know if its very profitable, but it has a lot of stuff to farm (achievements)   
---
there is also daily log in, fractals, pvp... some dedicated people might be doing Dungeons... but most organized groups do raids i guess
---
I started building Exitare and I just finished Malumres. Looks like that's all I needed to do to build Visiospei? Can I just... salvage it? o.O
---
because it was?
---
My wife, my wife, my wife lol.... we get it you're married lol
---
Would you not agree that the "armor" problem is largely a solved problem within GW2 at this point? There are far fewer unknowns that need to be answered per new armor asset being developed in 2019 than in, say, 2011.
---
Uhm, I don't think repeatedly linking keywords to own index works in, like, *2019*.
---
Slight upgrade?? Dude you can get twice as high (that’s not an exaggeration, I measured it) with the skyscale if there’s a wall you can latch onto. And while it isn’t as fast as the raptor on an entirely flat, open field, it’s flight makes it significantly more versatile and maneuverable. This is an incredible mount.
---
Why do so many people hate shiny stuff? it's been a gw2 circlejerk for a while now. I guess unpopulair opinion but I like it. We've been in the game a long time now and we are killing dragon gods. We should look powerful.
---
Ah yes! A Dev actually confirmed that easter egg in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9h0cex/critical_role_reference_in_one_achievement_of_the/) I made for another Critical Role reference in Episode 4 :)
---
Well, the tentative release for the armor is late Fall / early Winter. I'm going to go out on a limb here (not really) and predict it'll be closer to the latter than the former. A new armor set coming 5-6 months from now is... alright I guess... but I'm not so generous as to say it's really a big step up.
---
Yeah, I agreed with the people in the chat that it wasn’t very good. Then I pressed v, saw what it can do, and realized they were full of shit lmao
---
That's bad
---
Final product of all 5 trinkets? - A single big orb just hovering above you.
---
Its alright... nothing special.
---
&gt;5.655%
---
that percentage of 209k is probably somewhere around 12k

It's certainly not invalidated.

Thomas has seen enough. I was time for Thomas to stop playing GW
---
Is there an option to hide the visuals like on Back pieces?
---
You touched the Skull right?
---
Wow, that's quality armor (and a very nice drawing)!
---
Sure, but add cheaper to the list then.
---
How is that efficient? You have to take your right hand from the mouse, press key on the numpad and then move hand to the mouse again. It might even be troublesome if you miss mouse with your hand. You can't look around when mounting too if you do that. I have certain skills in mouse keys I use just before mounting too, to jump from monsters, and lws4 masteries. With my binds switching mounts is much faster because I can still move around, especially when you are in the air switching mounts by using mastery
---
At this point, skins that aren't glowy are the minority that dont fit the environment.

Try using the recipe components in the Discovery section in the Chef crafting UI. Worked for me the first time- then use the regular recipe in Production section.

Ugh, because of this I can't get traits for Power Berserker :(

Help needed!

Tbh imo trade post is the true Endgame of Gw2.
---
Doing things brings you more value (resources\\drops\\map completion\\gameplay itself), but that may be subjective. 
---
If the purpose of crafting now is basically for you to "buy stuff directly" where would the gold come from? Gem to gold? I mean for me the logical chain would be: you do stuff (any type of gameplay) -&gt; you get rewards which move your progression (resources\\xp\\collection completion) -&gt; then you can trade achieved resources for some additional goodies, but what would be the incentive for using the "uglier" less entertaining way?
---
I hope you get my point, phrasing and examples may be off. T\_T
---
Ayyyyy
---
What a lonely looking tree.
---
Spoiler: we won’t
---
Depends on what type of player you are. I do all raids and daily fractal CM's. I rarely use my crafting professions as I get ascended gear dropped. All 9 of my characters are decked out in ascended armor and weapons, most of which has been from drops. I even have ascended underwater weapons as I had to reduce the amount of boxes I had. (The only craft I really use properly is chef, the others are just to compound matts for easy storage).
---
My recommendation is, actually rush to level 80, and get full exotic berserker gear. But don't use crafting as part of your leveling. Level up crafts casually using a guide, but don't rush it by buying matts. Get into fractals and start progressing up to level 100, and then 100 CM. By the time you make it there, you will have either lost interest, or bought/be looking to buy the expansions to get more diverse end game content.
---
even during core times crafting had limited value, and basically only served to level alts, or gear a character the quick and expensive way, while the smarter approach was to farm dungeons, karma, or wvw badges. nowadays it mostly serves to gate some cases of progression, like e.g. the weapon collections for istan and THP.
---
Pic 1 is Aurora, pic 2 is Aurora with Vision, Pic 3 is the bugged Mesmer clones, which appear to show Aurora+Vision+Coalescence (we assume).
---
Doing T4 without everything being ascended is pretty difficult. Crafting ascended pieces to most peope i know was purely for the first set. Achieving trinkets from LS is doable, then you can do T2, maybe T3 but for some people who have some gold already, they rather squeeze out a fully ascended first charater and start doing T4s.
---
You get plenty of mats from going to lvl 1-80 so crafting to level 500 shouldnt nearly be as expensive as some people make it out to be. Ofcourse the pieces themselves have a cost too but once you got your first set youre good to go and youll make way more gold by doing T4 rather then grinding T2, T3 etc untill you have all the pieces.
---
Wait there's a completely new effect if you have aurora and vision at the same time?
---
Yes, indeed.
---
O_o that's cool
---
I feel like they should really work on this to make sure the error stops because it could affect the amount of money spent on the game
---
I can't wait to see what having full Legendary accessories will look like.
---
Uff, you are right, too tiring.
---
Then you consider the small percentage of the playerbase that actually has legendary armor. I swear some of you guys cant seem to view the game from the average players perspective lol
---
Eternal alchemy.
---
It wouldn't be too difficult. You get to choose which guild you want as your WvW guild at the start, and then they'll charge gems to change your WvW guild to another guild. It's pretty much how server transfers already are.
---
It'll just play the entire cutscene from Omad's machine over your head on a loop? I'm in.
---
If any of you were a mesmer you would be slaughtered
---
Why in the world would you want to transmute a Legendary? Their stat increase is barely higher, the whole point of them is their visuals. They are deluxe skins, why would you make a legendary and not show off the skin.
---
https://youtu.be/OQGGytoNXk8 like this.
---
Good thing we have to wait 5 rates for birthday armor. I'm still so fucking salty about that, Gw2 probably won't even be around in 5 years. We need new skins today, not half a decade from now. I'll pay.
---
Remember when GW2 had excellent art direction? Seems like a very long time ago.
---
Good job!
---
I highly recommend doing recs, they're good money by themselves. Once I got 8g liquid gold just from doing recs. The pots and journals are a nice bonus.
---
Probably something like that. Not sure if that has anything to do with previous comment so I deleted it.
---
Looks like a little magical embryo. Cool. We already know the gods, dragons, and other mist entities are born of convalesced magic. I wonder if all 6 will be a little magical buddy floating behind us.
---
Would there be a possibilty of them increasing the limit of placable decoration in a certain space? I mean.. decoration is awesome and all.. but we can't really build the stuff we want if we're not allowed to place more than 20 objects in a tile.

---
I have DCs all the time 🤨
---
Oh, didnt see that, ty.
---
You can already get the convenience of legendary items without the visuals using the Blood Ruby trinkets from Bloodstone Fen, which have easily-reset stats.
---
Weren't they advertising the game with 11mil strong? Oof :x
---
because both suck
---
I'm positive about things I like tho
---
&gt; Players who actually want the stat swap will have to deal with this constant floating garbage or carry a huge amount trinkets.
---
Or carry Blood Ruby trinkets and the stat-reset item for them...
---
Ah ok thank you, I find the heavy pretty nice looking though.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.
---
Aren't Fractals available to F2P players?
---
ngl seeing the same pattern as griffon, more and more people unlocking it to the point that at least 1 persn has one if you rock up to a event/meta so it can't be that troubling to unlock.
---
How could i forget, ill try to add that, well done!
---
I love this! Some of those friendly interactions can be the most fun you have in World v World. 
---
Reminds me of a ["peace walk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBnBy5KE3Ho) we did one late night where we had a parade around SMC, balloons and tonics and just general silliness. Thanks to my friend for capturing it. Still something I look back on and laugh about.
---
Yeah I can’t believe I just realized how important rec is. I found they give most of the locked chests? And pots! Good stuff
---
There are no blood ruby accessories, so if you want a full stat-selectable set you have to use the Miata
---
Well said. Though the collection sucked tremendously, the mount was ultimately worth it.
---
&gt;When taking off and rising straight up from the ground, a skyscale can rise a tiny but ultimately negligible amount higher than the springer can get with a fully charged jump.
---
This happened to me in Dragonfall. I was semi afk-ing at a ledge on my skyscale waiting for events to spawn. Another player tried to use a springer to get on top of the cliff nearby without success. After he left, I raised my Skyscale to max hover altitude and it was well over the height of the cliff. That was when I knew the Skyscale was superior to springer even before masteries was involved.
---
[One thing I enjoy doing in cities is to compete with strangers on who can afk hover the highest xD](https://imgur.com/a/hB1A20X)
---
They cost more to buy and reset, but not nearly as much as a Legendary trinket costs.
---
they stated how it would work in the first detailed post they made. People would need to pay gems to transfer to another world if they want to transfer immediately (without waiting 8 weeks for re-worlding)
---
At least 9.
---
This has been so helpful, thank you very much.
---
Whew, was worried for a moment
---
Still better to craft an insignia or inscription to stat swap one of those armor pieces you get from fractals
---
&gt;mastering a crafting 0-400 cost around 10 gold (if i remember it right) and 400-500 is around 40g.
---
[It costs quite a bit more than that at the moment.](https://gw2crafts.net/total.html)
---
If it makes you feel any better, the anniversary skins are not that great. They are awful on any race that's not human (but I guess that goes for all armors) and even on human I'll just end up using one or two pieces
---
Oh no, my poor pc...
---
One mesmer is enough
---
Not quite, that's the issue. When they do world building, enemy designs and other lore related stuff, while definitely flashy, they always keep a balance. Do Elonian NPCs look like this to you ? Are the Olmakhan this level of shiny ? Balthazar, the GOD of war looks less flashy than some players out there. 
---
There's a reason why people thought the CGI trailer looked bad, and it wasn't just the uncanny valley asura or the overly plasticy look, It's because it was supposed to more or less realistically depict the game wolrd, and everything just looked gaudy and glowy. I can almost guarantee you that this is not how Tyria is supposed to look, bc if it was, no one would even be able to hit each other since everyone would be permablinded.
---
However, when it comes to player rewards or a lot of gemstore items, they opt for the flashy bc it sells and motivates people to play the game. Bc at the end of the day, as funny as skritt are, a lot of people are just like them when they see something shiny.
---
"HurrDurr infusions baaad QQ"
---
I've tried climbing. You can get close to the base of the tower...there is also another area where you can see some kind of symbol on the top
---
Kinda looks like the player character was copy/pasted into the photo from another, due to the giant purple outline, but otherwise, nice composition.
---
Oh man, now that I have the Position Rewinder, I should give it another go...
---
if you have *stairs* bunny gona be  10x faster than skycale,if you have just land raptor gona be  10x faster than skyscale,you guys are rly full of shit,sry.
---
Check out the Discord in the sidebar here, and the communities for any GW2 content creators you enjoy, but the best place (besides maybe in-game) to find others to play with is probably r/GuildRecruitment .
---
Not very unpopular, I can't find a single comment that does like the effects.
---
I play gw2 on and off all the time depending on what other games are holding my attention at the time, so like in this case I haven't finished the new chapter yet but I probably will fairly soon.
---
From my experience this is pretty common in MMOs, especially in ones without a subscription because they are so easy to get back into.
---
I really love guardian. Maining guard since release. U can dps, condi and support. All what I need. If I’m bored with dps I supp..
---
Crafting is more relevant in gw2 than in many mmos , and to have the "best" weapons in the game be crafted is almost unheard of.
---
If you like big hard hitting attacks then maybe you will like warrior? Both axe and greatsword feel very impactful and have some big damage skills on them. Guardian is also pretty nice but has more of a 'magical' aesthetic to it but maybe give it a try too! 
---
Also, I acknowledge what you said in your post already, but maybe also try your ranger with greatsword? If you own PoF expansion or plan to get it, power soulbeast also is really fun and does big damage :D
---
All that matters is being right.  The way the information is delivered is not important.
---
This is what happens when the progression system is tied to cosmetics.
---
Most of the crazy rich players got it by TP flipping, so it's relevant. But not by just crafting and selling.
---
I'll give it a try ty man
---
That just isn’t true.
---
Thanks for lots of info. I'll check them out
---
Aurora and vision looks nice, but personally for me they ruined it with step 3
---
Another hoorah for Guardian. Any flavor will do. Massive DPS Dragonhunter. Quickness Support DPS Power Firebrand. Big heals Heal Firebrand. A tool for every situation in every type of content.
---
&gt;  Do Elonian NPCs look like this to you ? Are the Olmakhan this level of shiny ? Balthazar and Kormir, two gods look less flashy than some players out there.
---
Ye... now you mix up NPC with Player's fashion...
---
By jumping A LOT
---
Imagine if, just for once, anet tied collections to events that didn’t bug
---
To rephrase not newbies, new to class sure.
---
Thank you!
---
I honestly really like the effect ( I am serious) but I understand all the people who wish that it can be turned off like a backpiece. 
---
A legendary trinket is very useful, but the look is only made for mesmers and guardians maybe, so rip fashion wars
---
A little less if youre rolling with a good fight guild but yea time is money 100%
---
Hah ha! I LOVE the Skyscale! :D
---
Copy your post, replace legendary with people who experiment on builds
---
Heavy mist shard is literally the best full heavy set in the game so far.
---
Slow uptime is much more reliable in raids, at least in my raid group. You may be 1 or 2% away from critcap in raid but I tend to swap my backpiece between zerkers/assassins to manage critcap but it's a small diff. If you're doing raid speedclears it'll matter more.
---
Because I like the current style of my character but like the convenience of being able to switch my stats, runes/sigils and infusions on the fly? I don't play the game to stand around looking good but for the combat and how enjoyable it is. Being able to swap stats helps immensely with the latter in raiding. 
---
On my thief alone I swap between berserker, vipers, magis, harriers, minstrels and diviner in a normal full clear and being able to have trinkets that allowed for swapping stats, without the bad visuals, would be far, far more appealing. Saves bag space, removes gold and materials from the economy and if I can hide the effect, let's people that want to look flashy feel more unique. Everyone wins!
---
You might be misinterpreting that. This statistic here is the number of players REGISTERED to this specific site meant for GW2 players. The number of players for GW2 proper is much higher. 11 million isn't totally accurate, however. It's a marketing ploy to draw in more players, but it is NOT a lie. 11 million accounts have been made and played on. Some of those (a lot) are inactive due to death, changing life circumstances, and lack of interest. On the other hand, this practice of saying their total player count isn't unprecedented in the industry. Many other MMOs have done this in the past.
---
Ohhh, and there's Uranus! :D
---
Reaper is so much fun and the scythe feels very hard-hitting
---
I think it looks neat, not my favorite, and suffers from the same problems I mentioned above imo but it's definitely down to personal preference. I'm glad you can get something out of it though :)
---

---
isn't necro just spawns tons of things to fight for himself. that is actually what i am trying to avoid
---
Imagine if, just for once, people understood that bugs isn't something you put in because you feel like it.
---
Well, not really. While leveling is important, especially first hero, I'd say the game is totally different. You can't really switch builds early on, you won't experience support/healers and team comps unless teamed with 80lv players for dungeons. 
---
All you have during leveling is to explore, struggle with dungeons, with gear and so on. Once you hit 80 and gear up, you are free to do anything.
---
Game does change a lot.
---
Wait, hold the damn phone. All of them?!
---
Nobody's mentioned tomes yet, they use the sigils from the weapon you had equipped before opening the tome.
---
Because the post above him says the sky scale is "halfway to griffin numbers" and it clearly isn't?
---
Because that much visual noise on other peoples avatars is cancer.
---
Quite silly how many people in the thread seems to think that ArenaNet are just holding back on a fix for it, or it being a simple: "Push the button" deal.
---

To avoid seeing this atrocity
---
Alkali’s been bugged since before the Vision patch. Anet shouldn’t release collections where progress is blocked due to a pre-existing bug
---
I don't think so. I still tend to craft ascended to fill missing pieces after I drop or buy all other pieces and run out of currencies. It's the fastest actually.
---
Hm? Quite sure I managed to do it just a week or so ago when working on Kralkitite for Skyscale.
---
I just came back to GW2 after like 1.5 years gone and I am not gonna be in this chapter for a long time. I hadn't even started Path of Fire when I left, so I have like 10 new maps to play before getting to the latest one.
---
Ahh yes, you managed to do it once so it was never bugged at all! Infallible logic
---
Dyes look different on different armours, kinda depends on the material of your armour (like cloth, leather, metal) , so it’s pretty tied to the different armour types (light, medium, heavy)
---
Try a different dye? Celestial is the whitest hair colour, but the whitest armour colour is permafrost
---
gw2 like any other mmo is boring to watch play it. most wow streamers play the game for 1/3 of their stream and the other 2/3 react to youtube videos
---
That is not at all what I am saying. I am simply pointing out that it was clearly doable before while you seemed to imply that it was not even before the update.
---
You can play it as minion master or melee walking death. Leveling is always easier with minions/pets just like in every other game.
---
should have thrown away the pre and gifts earlier to save some space smh
---
I’m saying it bugged before the patch, evidently not always, and yet Anet still decided to ignore the bug and release Vision anyways (because Anet never, ever learn)
---
Mighty teapot is probably the only one.
---
Ye, i hope coalesence will have a different effect
---
I’m making a gen 1 to sell instead
---
You buy an item that resets the trinkets. You can’t bring that into raids or it doesn’t work there?
---
And what if he bugs out on something else further down? Wouldn't you rather they fix it right the first time?  Let anet do their job. I will admit the lack of communication from them on this is annoying though.
---
Kudzu fits the environment.
---
Thank you again for your answer 
---
With the new ryzen available soon, i hope that the 9600k Will be found at lower price. Ill get it if its the case (i have already a pure Rock to make it cooler)
---
Lol I 100% DISAGREE. Leveling can get tedious. Sometimes having all your skills and traits unlocked is all you need to start really enjoying the game. I don’t think I would love elementalist so much if I didn’t boost mine. I can’t imagine not having all of my attunements.
---
so i need to wait a week or 2 before they fix a simple bug, nice
---
I think there's definitely a disparity between the cost of crafted stuff and the cost of map rewards (Bladed armor is, at most, 1 gold, or free if you do well enough at the meta, crafted exotics can be much, much more expensive). I don't think it's invalidated, but I think there's a mismatch of cost and reward in crafting.
---
See, I could understand expensive exotic crafting if it, say, rewarded you with a nice-looking skin. GW2 has always been about grinding for looks rather than for stats. But the HoT crafted sets don't come with unique looks like the PoF ones do, so it feels dumb to craft those.
---
Viper is almost always the best set for condi, and its much harder to get than berserker because of how easy zerk gear is to get, id get that stat set and buy a zerk one on tp, otherwise you waste money and time.
---
Holy shit, this is beyond ugly. I am very much a "stop whining about visual noise" kind of guy in most instances, the most egregious examples being rare exclusions. But this is awful. So awful.
---
Your single experience does not match those of the many players who still do engage in large fights, proof can be seen by those who record and post footage on YouTube and to the community on a daily basis. The game mode is dead in that it's stagnating but it's definitely still got the appeal and player base, perhaps only limited by timezone or server.
---
Everyone arguing about impact of light effect in this thread is -1 minimum, only some " punchline " comments are upvoted and not that many.
---
  
---
When every comments glorifying Anet about that same statement is +3 minimum.
---
Also "majority".
---
It's only content if it's something you want to do. If you don't care about it then it's bloat.
---
Well its technically still a timegate that belongs to this specific chain of activities necessary to acquire Vision. Just because you did it when that LS episode launched doesn't mean you didn't spend time on it. And if you weren't interested in the weapon skins, there was no reason at all to do Brandstone Research. Now there is, if you are interested in Vision, so yeah, its part of the Vision collections.
---
Still doesn't mean its bad. A few days of waiting are no problem - being forced to wait because Akili is bugging is a much bigger bummer.
---
They should be doing fractals for practice and full ascended before touching raids
---
He/she compared early numbers of the griffon to (early) numbers of the skyscale.
---
*\weary warclaw stare*\
---
I'd love to know which raids, exactly, where the difference between winning and losing is of your theif is wearing marauders or zerker.  Or what is the qualitative difference between magi and minstrel
---
&gt; if part of the reason you preferred this game over the competition is because it was less visually noisy
---
If this is the reason you started playing the game then you did literally 0 research on it because it has been this way since the beta
---
Thanks everyone for clarifying. I bought a shared slot and copper. :)
---
Hrm. All the other responses are quite thorough but kinda miss the point. ESO really puts the RPG in MMORPG, but GW2 puts the MMO in it. They're kinda opposites.
---
The biggest difference GW2 has from other MMOs is that they don't disguise how meaningless it all is. There are no NPCs charging you with a list of quests, there's no gear treadmill, hitting max level takes no more than two weeks, drops only have value for their salvageable mats, and 95% of the content can be soloed. So usually about halfway to max level MMO vets feel the freedom of the game turn to existential meaninglessness.
---
But that's just it: GW2 isn't a game to escape *to* (though it is pretty), but a game that in many ways mirrors real life. If you're good at giving yourself goals, feel that growth is more about your achievements and improving your own skills, and enjoy the camaraderie of drop-in-drop-out play, GW2 is an incredibly freeing MMO, with great combat and genuine choices in class, build, and content. In many ways it's more of a MOBA, or FPS, or even Breath of the Wild than a MMORPG.
---
Complete rubbish. The particle and infusion creep has been *real*. It's always been *fashion* wars, not zero taste technicolor vomit wars.
---
invisible Something that knockback lol
---
Not really, only the legendary weapons had super flashy effects at launch. There was the Fiery Dragon Sword that not everyone had, but that I always saw as an acceptable level of flashy. 
---
This, this right here is a goddamn eyesore. I thought the wings were bad but this is another level.
---
I find the competitors to be the ones that are more moderate with shiny armor and weapons.... GW2 has always been about making everything shiny
---
cba, busy with WvW
---
Bladed Armor cannot be sold on the TP.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought most all stat selectable armor was Account Bound (outside of legendary, of course)?
---
Not at launch, it has been slowly creeping in over the years. 
---
At least we’re not at Tera levels of gaudiness yet.
---
It means getting exotic Minstrel and Trailblazer is much cheaper. Other than that I don't think it makes much difference.
---
Doesn't make much difference for me since I go straight to ascended now anyway if I need to outfit a new character.
---
The thing about those traits where you get a % from one stat into another is that often you will get more of the converted stat from straight up gearing for it. For example, if you get 10% vit converted into precision, sounds great, get some valks gear and you can now get pow/pre/fero/vit; well, if you just went zerker, youd have way more precision since instead of just 10% of the stat, youd get 100%...and since vitality is a luxury stat (at best) you are now running a less than optimal build. (This is of course assuming no new armor sets come out that have very specific stat combos that allow you to actually get more total useful stats through conversion, though to my knowledge, there arent any specs/builds that have this.)
---
Now, that isnt to say people should never bother with vitality in PvE. One example is heal/boon tempest. You can just go full harriers, but you dont need full harrier to max out boon duration. So you can easily get 2 magi pieces in there and up your vitality. The vitality isnt necessary, but in this situation, it is a luxury stat since you capped out/dont need the more important one.
---
I think he means vendoring item to NPC for more than 1 gold (not coppers/silvers when you sell junk).
---
GGG have something like 300+ employees. And they pump content every 3 month on a schedule, no excuses. And that have their pay off with huge spike of popularity over last years.
---
Dauntless, while way smaller game and developer, with HUGE backing of Epic Games publishing them, yep.
---
Double this advice. Try dragon hunter with gs. Chain your enemy, leap into it, slice it to shreds.
---
Animations are fluid, best burst in the game, tons of damage and a couple of oh shi buttons.
---
No, just a bit of taste. I know that's hard for folks like you to see.
---
Make sure their responses weren't lost in spam, that you provided an accurate email (don't autofill anything in the form, to be sure), and that you didn't message them multiple times about the same issue.
---
I've honestly had stupendous response time with sending tickets in (1 week at most, when they were under heavy load.) so I can only imagine it might be user error on your side.
---
That said, shit happens. Try again in a week and put your previous ticket numbers in your ticket as well.
---
Thanks for this; this was a good answer to a question I didn’t even think of asking yet
---
Thanks for pointing this out!
---
The core specializations are underwhelming across the board in my opinion.  They just haven't aged particularly well.
---
Thank you, I was just confused as to whether or not they would boost my other abilities as well, thanks!
---
Thank you for clearing that up ^_^
---
Elementalist best RANGED dps? Thief best MELEE dps? Guardian for CC? Warrior for tanking? What the hell are you on about?  
---
Weaver is a good melee dps, thief can be melee or ranged but rifle dominates on small hitboxes, DH has some breakbar potential but it's not support, if you mean support then it's firebrand which doesn't have much in the way of CC, and I've never read anything about a warrior tanking.  
---
Spreading misinformation is bad m'kay.
---
[https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)
---
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO,vision have same effect as aurora. IF you have aurora allready you will get NEW effect.
---
I was unclear, I guess. What I meant is that Bladed Armor can be bought from the NPC for 1 gold (and 500 airship parts). So, it will cost you 1 gold to buy the bladed armor. But there's no sense in keeping around the Living World armor that sells to a vendor for 2.5 gold (aside from the chest piece as noted).
---
Thanks for replying I was initially assuming that a sigil would only boost the abilities given by the weapon it’s slotted to, glad to see that isn’t the case. Do you know how I can get 100% burn duration with grieving stats by the way?
---
Thank you for replying.
---
Do you know how I can get 100% burn duration with grieving stats by the way?
---
Yeah, Reaper sounds like what OP is looking for - such a juicy and tanky feeling melee class (especially for light armor).
---
Alternatively, I also recommend Holosmith. Playing Sword/Shield Holo feels so different than normal Engineer kits. Definitely another tanky melee class that focuses less on kits.
---
Bladed COSTS 1 gold if you buy it from the vendor. Living world armor gets you 2.5 gold selling it to a vendor.
---
D o you know how I can get 100% burn duration with grieving stats by the way?
---
That would be a question for someone with much better understanding of how stats stack than me!
---
I think I bought in 2012 something along the lines "PvP focused game, with constantly evolving PvE world and whole gamemode dedicated to Realm vs Realm, where you can level from 1 to 80 and never leave."
---
**6 raids a year...**
---
Try biggest frog and balloon :-)
---
Nothing feels more like hitting than a warrior with an axe. Not only the autoattack hits 6 times, the Burst and Primal burst of axe have a split second pause that really makes it feel like it's hitting  hard.
---
No, those swap are to costly for what it does and slow. It's better that you just buy multiple trinket set and swap them. Anyway they are account bound, so it's never wasted. 
---
You lose infusion too when you swap stats, so you will need infusion extractor.
---
Raid in whatever, T1 and train
---
Skyscale isn't worth it :^)

what armor piece are these feathers around this character's shoulders?

With the changes to stat-selected gear if you have the resources you could pretty much just buy the 5 or so pieces from VB's Bladed set and do the Night Meta for the chest and stat select yourself a full set of exotic viper armor. Weapons and trinkets you'd need to fend for yourself on, but comparing the two they're easier to get than a full set of viper armor.
---
bruh there's one (maybe 2) infusions in that picture and both of them are ghostly.  The rest of it is from armor and legendary effects...
---
I'm gonna need captain obvious for this one.
---
There was the Battle of Five Armies in hobbit. We have three lanes, commander and Kralk. Coincidence? I think not!
---
Preview window uses an entirely different lighting system then in-game does. You'd need to try with brighter or darker dyes. Thankfully the Jormag dye kit is back so dyes like Permafrost and Eternal Ice (two really great white dyes, one being the whitest dye in the game, the other being the whitest dye in the game that doesn't much remove all detail from your gear).
---
They said they're looking for a way to turn it off and on

#DONTDRAGYOURPOLITICSINTOMYGAME

"focused on helping LGBTQ+ individuals escape persecution and violence" you making this ppl victims,no1 else. stop treating ppl like they are special. we are all same,with same rights. this not gona help anyone.
---
Ya I've had that pointed out to me by a Guildie last night. Most fights happen at ~900 Range. Mostly because Necro's shades, wells, and scepter 3 all cap out at that range. 1200 may be where you can get spiked down and 300 may allow melee to shine, but 900 range is where the REAL damage is that can make or break a fight.
---
Honestly I kind of like it. I know people hate pirate ship but I liked it in a tactical way. So a Mid/Long Range Meta is kind of the best of both worlds especially with scrapper stealth and veils still giving the small window to push past 900 into melee.
---
i like the effects.  Not as much as the 2nd stage though
---
infusions are hardly the problem in most situations, especially after the phospholuminescent nerf.  The above post for example only has 1 infusion, most of it is just armor effects
---
I would inform you that being gay isn't a choice, but it seems you've already decided to remain ignorant. Pity how you just disproved your own point by being a raging bigot
---
BTW - we have a bunch of pre-events going on, if you're interested, here are the deets:
---
**Mini-Marches**
---
*The mini-marches are our way of visiting the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire areas, and a way to get the word out about Tyria Pride to those hanging out in those zones \^\^ If you'd like to join, come along!* 
---
* June 1: Tyria Pride HoT
---
* June 8: Tyria Pride PoF
---
Both marches start at **16:00 CEST on EU** and **4 PM EDT on NA!** Look for us in LFG, join us by connecting to Teamspeak.
---
**Fashion Wars** 
---
*Since we don't visit them throughout the march, we'll be visiting each racial capital with the Fashion Wars event! We'll visit a different city each Saturday or Sunday, and in each city, members of that race will compete in a fashion wars event, with an overall winner being announced on Day 1 of the main Tyria Pride event!*
---
* June 2: Rata Sum
---
* June 8: Black Citadel
---
* June 9: Divinity's Reach
---
* June 15: Hoelbrak
---
* June 16: The Grove
---
All Fashion Wars events start at **20:00 CEST on EU**, and at **3 PM EDT on NA**! The theme is "Rainbow", and the grand prize for the overall winner includes custom character artwork done by friend to GGB - [Malchemist](https://www.artstation.com/malchemist)!

He posts in MGTOW so OP just making mention of a woman is going to trigger him.
---
The problem is that I cannot turn this effect off on me **or** (importantly) other players.
---
I wanted to play Guild Wars 2. As it is, the game already struggles enough with combat becoming one giant disco floor the moment more than 2 players are using abilities. These legendaries - weapons, armor, trinkets, everything - make the issue **significantly** worse.
---
Guild Wars 2 is an **incredibly** pretty game. Only half the time you can't see that because there's just a blob of overlapping visual f/x on your screen.
---
[And with Quaggan](https://youtu.be/yUVUUZ8ef1E?t=23)
---
If anyone wants a reminder for the event, feel free to reply to this message. I can send everyone a PM a couple days before the main event \^\^
---
If you want to try out different things warrior can use the most weapons in the game. Necro has quite a few things you can experiement with while leveling. Minions, power, condi, hybrid, decent AOE.
---
Yeah because dying your armor all pink is the height of Taste. Also taste is subjective, if someone wants to be a fucking walking light show so be it. Get that stick out of your ass and loosen up.
---
My interpretation of the thing in the middle is different.  It looks more like an unstable (or unbound or volatile) glob of dark matter behind contained in blue-ish white forcefield suppled by the elder dragons orbiting it.   If we lose too many Elder Dragons, watch out.
---
Mine and other LGBT people's indentities aren't politics, and it's not your damn game alone.
---
What's an easy way to get mid level crafting materials these days? It used to be that I would save bags from WvW and open them on my level 53 alt, but that doesn't seem to work anymore and it just gives level 80 materials. Same for unidentified gear. Is there a new method or do I just have to go out and manually farm level 55 zones?
---
proud gamer never excluded due to gender gets triggered by inclusivity, more news at 8
---
What is your problem?
---
IF i write "he" its wrong, if i neutrally write "you people" - meaning all people.. its wrong too?
---
So.. tell me, if i dont know "what" someone is, how shall i neutrally talk to these people without calling them "people", which is neutral.
---
Tell me, what is wrong with that?
---
Happy Pride Month and good luck to people involved! This ought to be a fun one :D
---
It’s been like this before and is the main hold up for most people (myself included) for finishing the quest... “vision of istan”
---
If they are going to use well known to be bugged quests... they need to include/add new ways to skip the step (like the skyscale food at the djinn spawn that was glitched)
---
This isn’t a “timegate” (which is fair for me) it’s unintentional exclusion from a basic lack of full run through beta testing... any scrub could catch this by just being told.. sit.. start from zero and do it (report back).
---
So change the brandstone quest to do this OR buy/craft this item to skip bugged steps
---
As Catholic I'll celebrate The Feast of Corpus Christi in June.

Rainbow is a symbol of G-d and so it happens I were born to be person of light.

Lion of Judah is my Lord and I'm grateful to be part of his pride!
---
What part of "i dont care what someone is" didnt you get?
---
gonna get everyone else in my trans commune to quit wow and d2 for gw2's pride events 😎
---
Only in combat which is the main place that you don't want visual clutter if you are doing challenging content...
---
I really like the subtle purple aura and would gladly have advanced my collections to getting the legendary if it was just that but the orbs are awful.
---
You're not on a high horse, no matter how badly you perceive it, bud. "Bigot" this, "ignorant" that, your tired accusations wash over me like LGBTBBQ sauce. I oppose you. Deal with it, sweaty.
---
Just stop replying already. There's obviously some kind of language barrier. He probably thought you were being condescending with the "you people", as there's a very real problem of some straight people othering the LGBT community and treating them like an alien species.
---
I get that you didn't intend any harm, but your comments came off as ignorant and dismissive of the LGBT community. 
---
This literally isn't going anywhere. As long as you're aware that the existence of real people who happen to be gay can't be reduced to just "politics", there's nothing more to argue about.
---
you sound like you care bud
---
What is KC?
---
Yep, but have fun getting the Ascended kit.
---
I never understood why people actually go out of their way to click the endurance bar instead of setting a hotkey.  It's no wonder people can't dodge anything.
---
Depending on what time you're on, [EVA] runs a HoT meta train (TD-AB-DS-AB-VB) on the NA server every weekday starting at 12:30 PM UTC (12 hours after reset). They start the VB meta at 3:45 PM UTC, and every time I've done it with them, they get to T4 (which is a free bladed armor box)!
---
I thought it was supposed to be a feature?  Raptor for long jumping, Jackal for precision jumping.
---
Allows you to jump around corners easily by blinking then turning your camera 90deg and blinking again.

Superior runes of Balthazar, the Flame Legion, or the Forgeman will give you +50%, sigil of smouldering will give you +20%, the trait Radiant Fire for +20%, and then for the final 10%, you need food like bowl of spiced meat chili.
---
Well, in that case the sudden increase of interest in the "event that doesn't bug" will drastically increase the chances of it bugging out.
---
Because it's a sensitive topic and your argument sounded similar to some tactics that homophobes use against the community. 
---
Again, I get that you weren't trying to be hateful, just came off insensitive. Which is w/e, shit happens. 
---
And frankly (with regards to your original comment)... I've played GW2 for years. I lurk at Pride because my own country doesn't allow pride parades. Every single year, like clockwork, the trolls show up in these Reddit threads. That doesn't mean there's something inherently wrong with the parades themselves. It's unfortunate that the topic of LGBT rights is still considered controversial, but it's not gay people's fault.
---
Anyway, like I said, I don't really want to argue against you, since I get that you weren't trying to be hateful. It's something like a cultural difference where you're not part of the community and you just don't get why it's tiring to hear arguments that were similar to yours. People making fun of your language doesn't really help
---
Blue, green and yellow salvage kits and a mystic forge stone in the magic lag vortex. Knowing that one recipe saves a lot of nonsense.
---
Maybe the stacking effects only apply to living world legendaries and the third could be a legendary for LW5
---
moi, ty
---
it's most effective for single target, but you can mix the traits up a bit to cater for multiple enemies
---
I never claimed that I represented the player base. You are the one making that leap. I stated that some people will be put off making the trinket because of the visual effects. That much is clear from other comments in this thread.
---
I'm not sure why *more* people would want something with a forced visual effect. By reducing options (ability to transmute legendaries, you only diminish the number of people that will make something. It isn't exactly a subtle legendary to fit in with character fashion either...
---
My boyfriend and I run a couple sets:
---
 - Partially Celestial/Marauder Weaver and Assassin/Berserker Daredevil. I'm the lightning rod that draws agg so he can freely get kills on enemies. Good for 2v5s and below, depending on enemy player skill we've pulled off 2v8's. Generally Spellbreakers give us some difficulty because of Feel No Pain, Signet of the Dolyak, and their excessive boon removal, but if they're solo then it's fine.
---
 - Marauder/Assassin Dragon Hunter and Grieving Mirage. He confounds them with clones that hit like buses while I pull and push them around like shopping carts. Less effective, but very fun and different feel. 2v4 is generally the sweet spot for that combo, cannot really justify fighting above 2v5s with it though. We have some issues when we come up against stealth-heavy Thief crews (3+ roaming Thieves/Daredevils) however as they break LoS and targeting which screws my entire rotation and keeps Mirage clones at bay.
---
 - Marauder/Berserker+Valkyrie Herald and Diviner/Berserker Tempest. Solo I can 1v3, but with the added boons of the Tempest and the added group control, I've pulled off 2v7 with relative ease. I'm terrible against Scourges though, I have to kill them first due to their Fear, Torment, Bleed, Poison, etc etc that very quickly tears me apart (just the variety of conditions becomes overwhelming at times). If the Scourge is alone though it's generally fine.
---
There are tons of fun and worthwhile combos to play as. If you like Rangers then either you can support her as a Druid, or you can run Soulbeast and she can support you. Or both of you can go on the offensive. Generally I recommend at least one of you plays offensively, you want kill potential. Being two brick walls may prolong defeat but without some damage of your own you will eventually crumble
---
&gt; Can I enjoy with for a while without the expansions?
---
Yes, but if you enjoy it, get the expansions. They add to the *game enormously*. The core game is now, effectively, the trial run for the "real" game, which means the full game with expansions.
---
Economy-wise, you have to be quit canny. There are certain things that will reliably make you money, such as time-gated materials, but the market is saturated for a lot of things so cheap items in bulk will normally make you more than one masterwork creation.
---
ty for the nice info man. i appriciate it
---
80v80 doesn't work either. It doesn't turn into an unplayable shitshow like 50v50v50, but it still isn't something expected from high tier MMO. Some early access game, maybe.
---
Also wut, what does my CPU have to do with a skill lag. Because I'm not even talking about fps drops, that problem isn't unique to wvw (but surely doesn't help).
---
Gold flows much more readily at level 80, so as long as you have enough for waypoints, you'll be fine.
---
Getting a craft 0-500 takes you up seven levels.
---
No you were definitely a dick about it and said it should be deleted.
---
Did it ever occur to you that not all artists are looking to make art their career and they just do it for fun?
---
"Stylistically restrictive" is not only my favorite phrase now, but it's also an understatement. Why the fuck would you make something that everyone wants for the functionality not only unable to be toggled off, but fucking PURPLE?!
---
Oh, I get you. I didn't originally speak English, either. But it eventually surpassed my mother tongue. If I tried to speak in Chinese to a true native speaker, I'm sure I would make mistakes.
---
Frankly, I didn't take offence at the "you people" thing - I thought it was obvious you were referring to the people in this thread (specifically the ones who were replying to you). Although, it *is* possible to use that phrase in a slightly arrogant manner, and not just to gay people. Depends on the context though, and it's not always offensive.
---
Ultimately, no harm done. You were just trying to express concern. I think we can walk away with a better understanding of this whole thing. And that's cool.
---
It's good the way it is.
---
wow so it links with the others... dammmm
---
I’m not mixing up GW2’s environments and other games... if anything, you are. GW2 environments go for a painterly aesthetic. While the character models are a little cartoony, it’s not overly so, and the environments certainly not.
---
I think it’s absolutely nuts to say that this effect works perfectly. Sparkling mounts? They’re just as out of place. I hate them. Anything overly shiny, anything overly sparkly just stands out so goddamned much versus the beautiful backgrounds they’re placed in.
---
Minions is just one way to play. Necro has a lot of different options just like other classes. There's condi/damage over time, a corruption condi necro, minion master, power necro, and a support blood magic. If you have Reaper or scourge it opens up a lot more playstyles as well.
---
I wonder if that floating piece of mithril ore that the orbs are connected to is supposed to remind us of something that happened in Tyria, when Vision got released...
---
Basically you're looking for big numbers and strong feeling animations. I'd recommend warrior, guardian, thief, elementalist.
---
looooooool.
---
There are many legendary collections to do in orr for the precursor crafting, unless they changed that since I made Astralaria.
---
Directly? No, no problem at all. My issue is that not everyone has/wants a purple character/theme and it isn't exactly a subtle purple aura. I'm almost completely white and purple is pretty removed from what I am.
---
Omg, he is stinking cute.
---
That is what makes jackal's movement style unique and fun.
---
I play on maxed gfx
---
hm alright, I mean, the issue here is, they look exactly the same in preview, but then ingame quite different, which kind of sucks, also celestial is my whitest die, anything else costs like 70gp+
---
Finally get around to watching this and its gone :/
---
How your armor looks in game will be affected by lighting changes and post processing then. Play with those settings a bit and see if it helps. I usually run with post processing on low or off, because I think it just looks better.
---
Yeah true. I was mostly kidding actually. 
---
I think at the very least we should be able to turn it off. They need to update the wardrobe system to handle infusions better, and tie in legendary effects to allow them to be toggled.
---
Agreed. Something's gotta change.
---
It looks more like the entrance to Sharkmaw Caverns to me.
---
Wait, people do that?!
---
Good point! I didn’t see it before but I do now!
---
&gt; one of the worst games I have ever played in regards to visual clutter.
---
you've never played Star Trek Online then, I presume.
---
If you find the leveling experience boring, I'd just use the boost.  If you played the game for a year I'd imagine you still remember how to play a little bit at least.
---
lol stonewall's 50th anniversary is this month and you're out here telling an uppity queer to sit down for respectability politics. haven't we learned anything, mr. hay?
---
nah, most maps dont have edges at water level
---
They could make special mastery for us to be able to land on the sea floor in order to use melee weapons. It could be quite interesting, land combat then swap on underwater weapons for extra skills (that will require to take off from the floor).
---
That can be really refreshing gameplay wise..
---
Just cut the crap and make all the lists. It's fun to see the games history being recorded
---
You say that as if people were not farming this specific event like crazy
---
So happy to see this going on again, I still have a folder packed full of screenshots from last year. Bless you all for running it. &lt;3
---
I had a great time and met several new friends, it's a great event. Enjoy!
---
[Leaked image of underwater mount](https://i.imgur.com/lckNtbT.png).
---
Warrior, axes.
---
If we do get an underwater mount, there better be a "Fast Ascent" skill to escape the really deep waters..
---
I'll take you up on that, thanks!
---
I mean, it's good that pride month gets a lot of attention but for some reason in gw2 pride month gets waaaaaay more attention than any other awareness/acceptance month. Can we please, after pride also celebrate the other months?
---
I did like how he accidentally made our points for us, though. 
---
&gt;I hope someday the LGBTQ community will escape the big bad boot they're under!
---
Here's hoping.
---
Ahh I see. Thanks. If you don't mind me asking, should I also do this with the lower rarity items, and which kit do you recommend I use?
---
No this would be a stupid concept stopping mounts cause path of fire is technically done. Mounts have been incredibly successful to drop them would be one of the dumbest things Anet could do feature wise and financially.
---
so you gona push your agenda and your belives into game? why?
---
how GAME gona HELP with your issue? focus on REAL PPL AND REAL LIFE ISSUES and dont spread your effort to divide ppl into VIDEOGAME. thx.
---
I feel like I should make these lists but my character is just lowkey enough to not be known big time. So... Reddit. Is my character Homicidal Cat in one of these lists? 👀
---
Magic find affects which gear you get, not what comes out of the gear when you identify it any more. So higher magic find will give you more rares etc. 
---
Level 80 rewards have been changed so unidentified gear is much more common, so the prices have tanked.
---
Dragonfall provides a lot of rare unidentified gear, which means the price of ectoplasm has tanked.
---
Open and salvage. Use the materials to make time-gated stuff and turn into into gold that way. The economy now is nothing like the economy six months ago, but I seem to have more gold so I feel like this seems to work out.
---
Sounds like you dislike passive, distanced play, and want to see enemies "react" to your hits. For the core-spec-only levelling experience:
---
Warrior axe/axe -- spin2win attack does a ton of damage and is generally fun; axe burst skill has a brief hitstop and feels like it has "impact", and you can combo it with a kick beforehand to be like a real melee juggernaut, getting up in their face and stuff. Kick them down and then leap over with an axe to their face...! Plus there's the trait Peak Performance which just makes that a natural thing you should do anyway. I feel like a large part of satisfaction comes from being able to punt and knock your enemies around, and clobbering them once they're down. Hammer is nice for that too. Greatsword feels more clunky and floaty to me.
---
Guardian greatsword has a high burst damage combo you can do once you get your traits going. Hits like a truck. Hammer has skills that push and launch enemies for fun.
---
Core necromancer attacks and kills stuff generally slowly so I never felt great going through the lower zones with it. Reaper is great, though, but only for the big numbers.
---
Wow that's alots choices, even Viper available.
---
iirc before patch Bladed only have like 4 options.
---
I wonder about DS exo boxes.
---
I remember doing HOPE when the event in Brisban with the spider was bugged... It sucked for sure, but it wasn't preventing me from completing it as i had a lot of other stuff i could do in the meantime. Ended up getting that event before it was preventing me from progressing. 
---
People should be glad that Vision requires this event because now it'll actually get fixed. If it was just bugged for people farming Istan, it probably wouldn't be a big priority (obviously it hasn't been) for them to fix.
---
That videogame can be used to reach people who might not be aware of the issues going on and to give a pleasant environment for LGBT folk, closeted people ans allies alike? And they're literally helping the issue with a fundraiser, anyway.
---
We're not here to divide them either. This whole event and all those like it are meant to bring people together on this matter to bring awareness in a place that is relatively safe for people for people to be in, even if theyr real life location and situation might be dangerous. Your and your likeminded asshole brigade's bigotry and shitty ""no politics in muh videogames"" is the divisive agenda here. And also a belief, a shitty one, to push into games and their communities. Grow the fuck up.
---
I mean in the situation you're describing it has even less to do with auras/etc. in large zergs and a lot more to do with how many character models there are, regardless of their individual effects.  That's why one of the biggest fps gains you can get is from lowering your Character Model Limit and turning on Effect LoD.  
---
As you say, we need updated engine performance.  More culling options won't really help too much as it is (we already have the biggest culling option possible anyway, Character Model Limit: Lowest, Character Model Quality: Lowest, and that *still* doesn't solve the problem fully).  So the hate against infusions is misguided especially when most of the effects aren't even infusions at this point; they're armor/weapons/dyes and on top of that the issue is, like you say, an engine issue.
---
Yeah I’m using the requiem armor’s glow like this :D
---
We literally only had 2 weeks to prepare for Tyria Pride because we just finished doing Toga Party for Multiple Sclerosis in May, and then we're going to go straight into overhauling our structure in July and start preparing for Pink Day in LA for cancer research in August.
---
There's only so much time in a year, but if you want to organise an event to highlight an important cause, we'll be happy to give you shoutout on our social media!
---
No idea why the hell you're getting downvoted for explaining to people how they can get basically free gold? I did the same as you, vendored it all once I saw that you could for easy money.
---
Then you will have to contact Support at support.guildwars2.com
---
Make sure you select Billing/Payments, they should be able to fix what ever error is causing the purchases to not go through.
---
&gt; I hate them.
---
That's the problem. It's not the environment, it's just like you don't like the sparkling/shiny parts of the game's style. 
---
It's your own opinion (which is fine, everybody has a different taste), but not the game style. 
---
Just an example, take Fractals, the shattered observatory or even the mistlock sanctuary. Aurora/Vision and also Ad Infinitum fit perfect in that environment. Ofcourse it won't fit everywhere, but a ice styled char wouldn't fit into Ember Bay or other flame styled maps.
---
Wahoo! Does anyone else remember Vee Wee?
---
BTW - we never get these comments on the multiple sclerosis fundraiser, and we only ever get them when Pink Day is mentioned in relation to breast cancer specifically, never if we just mention it's fundraising for all forms of cancer research. Makes you thonk.
---
so whats next? you gona bring abortion politics? racial issues? feminist issues? YOU ARE IN ONLINE GAME,NO1 GIVE A FUCK. IF YOU WANA SOLVE ISSUES LIKE THIS,DONT BE A LAZY ASS,GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TALK TO REAL PPL IN REAL WORLD. ppl playing game to have fun,you taking REAL LIFE SHIT here,why for the god sake? you wana help them? fine,go speak to some campus with 500 ppl in audience,they care,we just PLAYING A GAME,WHEN WE ARE TIRED OF REAL LIFE BS. btw,do you have some hobby? like fishing maybe? imagine you go fishing and group of ppl go to you and they are like HEY BRO,WE ARE LFGQWDF AND WE WANA YOUR SUPPORT,JUST LISTEN TO US FOR NEXT 2 HOURS AND LISTEN TO ISSUES OF GAY PPL WHICH ARE  KILLED IN 11 COUNTRIES. whoud you like that? maybe they gona add some pictures of dead ppl too? game is basicly WORST place you can bring such issue,bcs its anonymous and you gona only feed trolls. find real ppl,which wana help,this is just sad move. reedit is visited by 5% of GW 2 players,why you wasting your time? to get attention of 1000 ppl which looking for vision and new infusions pictures?
---
I posted a video of it the last time someone made a thread about this, you used to be able to do it with rabbit and then it was nerfed. But you've always been able to get there with griffon
---
So not possible unless you had the recipes from halloween?
---
Congrats! Selling or crafting?
---
no
---
The whole "everything is valid" has me often feeling a lack of progression.. is there a list of engane things to do/pursue?
---
Understood.
---
I have a feeling, when 4th Leg Trinket release, its gonna be like pic 3 but the balls shape like pic 2.
---
I dont think that would be considered an exploit and tbh if you only gain 10s... whats the big deal honestly
---
There already are lgbt issues, racial issues, and feminist issues embedded in the game itself.  Have you not played _any_ of the story?? o_O

Yes but the mount system is locked behind PoF. Unless mounts from S5 become their own independent system, I wouldn’t be surprised if we never get additional mounts.
---
And if gliders are any reference, they can still push additional skins post S4 just fine. It’s not because the main focus is onto something else that previous mechanics automatically become irrelevant.
---
it was WoW
---
You're very welcome :)
---
realistically speaking may be right
---
that helps me exactlly not at all, that's what I did with celestial... and you know the results with that already
---
Funny how identity politics keeps following sad little edgelords everywhere.... Almost like they turn any existence of marganized people into such to piss and moan about it 🤔🤔🤔
---
Drop down is futureproof, you don't have to worry about running out of space whenever they add more stats to the list, unlike your solution.
---
your whole comment is exactly why we dont wana politics in games,you got offended by someone just playing a game and you instantly insulting him. this is all we can get from this event,offended and insulted.
---
pfff with seeing how much acceptance mounts had im pretty sure they will make up something for S5 involving mounts...hell maybe promotion you get access to mounts if you get S5E1...but would be nice to have a whole new game mechanic introduced aside from gliders and mounts but cant think of anything as good as that...
---
I play games to get away from [transphobic &amp; homophobic garbage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/201003857835327488/584489227257905162/who_is_even_surprised.png) and yet here you are, commenting on my post, so I guess we can't win 'em all, huh?
---
Was about to say… I think this might be the wrong game for this troll^^
---
That's even worse and more time waster than a drop down, you have to check every tooltip to find what you want.
---
I’m not sure. While I would like an underwater mount I’m not convinced it’s necessary? 
---
Land mounts ended being a great addition since we could mostly move on two axis. Theredore it felt pertinent to give us traversal means to cross gaps, climb walls, fly even and so on. 
---
An underwater mount would give us what exactly? We can already move in all axis, there is no gravity so we don’t need to cross anything... Swim Speed infusions are already a thing and “speed boost mounts” kinda don’t feel great after the innovative mounts we got.
---
Unless they do an underwater version of Desolation, where unique environment conditions (like the sulfur) push forward a need (water current? Pressure?), I currently don’t see why an underwater mount would be a safe bet. It would need to be more than a simple recycling of the mount system.
---
An upgradable and customizable submarine? Giving us the possibility to walk underwater?
---
I don't know who this group of people is you reference by 'we', but I'm pretty sure that I don't care one bit what 'you' get from such an event. 
---
The rest of us on the other hand will have a great time, connect, raise money for supportive structures and, you know, just be ourselves =)
---
&lt;3
---
Oh I remember this, I think I saw it on the Under Night sub - based on one of its own. 
---
I admit, it does a small bit, need more of those defined cheekbones that Kralk really  __rocks__
---
Yeah that's what i had to do in that HOPE event, i went there right after a patch and got a fresh instance and it was up.
---
Just want to add my Kaiser bow didn't get reset, so likely the other ascended SAB weapons didn't either.
---
I reported this bug ingame either yesterday or the day before. Hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Newsflash:
---
1. no-one cares what you want, bigot.
---
2. We're not spreading here, we've always been here. 
---
3. Especially in regards to gw2 you're comment betrays an immense amount of ignorance. There are a lot of queer players, there are a lot of queer devs, there is all kind of queer representation in the game. If you don't like that, I'm afraid you'll have to be the one who leaves.
---
I don't see how they can make underwater interesting without the mount being a speed buff or another version of jackals/nuloch wallows.
---
Actually, Griffon's "go here and press F" / alt+tab to dulfy was not the issue.  (And cell phone beats alt-tab.)
---
The killer was the group events.  Once the crowd of folks who wanted their Griffon had it, the group events became all but impossible to find enough players to complete in the allotted time.  (Corrupted Facet legendary, Elon Riverlands Deadhouse, Desert Highlands Kanuz Cache POI event, &amp; Elon Riverlands Champion unbound djinn - I'm looking at you.)
---
In contrast, everything else is just tedious makework.  But those group events.  Ouch!
---
I can't help but think that these sort of things would go over a lot easier if Anet would offer multiple paths forward.  Some involving group events, some involving time gating, some involving gold or buying item off the AH, etc.  And then let folks pick the route they want to take, based on when they can play, what they can do, their number of in-game friends willing to help them out, etc.
---
OFC OFC,GO CRY FOR HELP,PRESS THAT REPORT BUTTON :DDDD
---
thats gona help your cause,bcs you are fucking useless,you doing nothing,you go to reedit,without any effort you puke your topic and than you reporting ppl for telling you the truth,in normal life,ppl whoud just cross street to avoid you... oh god. saving world one comment after another..... XD
---
Bad strategy. I had hard time figuring out where to put and in what format tekkit taco markers. Ended up using like 4 different options,figured it out in the end, but did not remove the faulty tries. Of course I have forgotten now which way was the working one.
---
I don't know what 80% of stat combos are besides the popular ones, unless I want to look it up in the wiki I have to manually swap the gear each time to know its stats.. a tooltip showing the stats would be really good.
---
Aww, I really wish they would see this and make that tradable. It has a fun icon, too.
---
My suggestion is use someone else's home.  Either a guildee's or one of the many people who call out in map chat with invitations.
---
People who have full home have been developing them for years.  If you start a home from scratch at this point, it would take a lot of effort and gold to complete it.  It's much easier to use someone else's, especially since they are so easy to get into now a days.
---
Mesmer clones seem to show the next stage of the trinket. if you only have one equipped, they show the effect of both combined. if you have both, they presumably show the 3rd stage that's not released yet.
---
it might just be a placeholder, but it looks pretty fleshed out already so chances are, that's close to the final version of the 3rd stage (unless they decide to change it now, because it got leaked).
---
whether it's tied to coalescence or some other legendary is unknown, though the next one is expected to come after season 5, which is a long way off, while the ring should be finished sometime in June with the new raid. hard to say which way they'll go, as tying raids to otherwise open world only legendaries seems a bit of a stretch, but having the effect over a year before it should be released also seems less than plausible.
---
Ahhh Jil...I've unfortunately had him in squads before. He harassed one of my guild members (who at the time was 16) and consistently messed up mechanics. I kicked and blocked him but one time I joined a Dhuum pug and the commander let him tank. Bad idea, he kept making Dhuum face team members doing the green mechanic and killing them. Eventually he gave up and left lol
---
get ready to JUMP on those bridges!!
---
go back to the hole you came creeping out of, ..fucking incel
---
I'm confused, the picture you uploaded has percentages working just fine.
---
I'm curious how often are you switching stats that this is even a problem at all, they are using an existing system, you want them to create a new design just because you don't want to spend 1 click on a drop down? I'm assuming the scrolling doesn't bother you since you want it in your proposed solution as well.
---
Take care now, bye bye then.
---
https://img04.deviantart.net/ae81/i/2012/104/1/a/rainbow_banhammer_by_kayniner-d4w49rp.png
---
Yeah, I just feel really uncomfortable not constantly running around, especially when there are multiple mobs.  I will say, against a single level 80 mob, I melt them like two skills into the rotation.  I'm very impressed.  This is a big change from my Mesmer.  But, I have nothing tanking for me, so all damage is directed squarely at me.
---
I haven't played since LS4E3 but logged occasionally to get the new episodes.
---
I want to play again but I am tired of playing my main (necro since PoF launch).  I played Guard and Ele during GW2 launch.  Looking to try another class for LS4 E4-6.  I have enough tombs/whatever to get a class to 80 and enough wvw currency to get the expansion masteries.
---
Looking for thoughts on a class/build/stats for primarily pve content.  While I have a Guard/Ele, I haven't played them since launch, so I am willing to play them again if their PoF spec is good.
---
Also, my necro was geared in fractals but I'd like to try another class for end game pve.  Since I haven't played in a while - what class/specs are desirable for fractals/raids?
---
Thanks!
---
Seriously I have no issues in 80v80 fights, skill lag only adds with third side.
---
I have dated i5 3570K overclocked to 3.8 MHz. 32 GB of DDR3 RAM. GW2 on SSD. Nothing really over the top. And my GPU is pure shit from scrapyard.
---
We live in hope. Context is knowledge and knowledge is power. 
---
Also, I've had had three glasses of wine so I'm in that dangerous state between righteous indignation and spending too much money on things I don't need on eBay, so it kept me busy.
---
Is it lucrative though?
---
Not necessarily. Each mount is separate. There's no mastery in PoF that unlock the use of mounts. They can simply add a mount and a new mastery track. Unlike with the glider where you need HoT to unlock the use of a glider. See this is why Anet needs to explain season 5 sooner rather than later to clear up the confusions the community has.
---
Honestly if that aint a whole mood then I don't know what is.
---
To be fair, the quick mockup is just a dirty copy/paste attempt at showing how much space is left unused and can easily fit the selection screen instead of the dropdown menu.  
---
A filter like the wiki could be nice but then you could potentially start to clutter the screen, I still think simply filtering through Assaulter/Malicious/Defender/Healer is a cleaner approach.
---
Oy. Flashbacks to the Engineer forums.
---
Am I the only one here who actually appreciates Hizen?
---
Thanks Hizen. Kek'd.
---
Am I the only one that actually likes this? I feel so alone.
---
Oh nice, we can get Condi sets fairly easy now! :)
---
Hey, I am a max level 810 cp player in ESO and just switched to this game few weeks ago (burned out in ESO) , and I really enjoy it so far. I am not an end game player, currently 78 level on my necromancer.
---
1. Gw 2 is same as ESO, not your traditional MMO like FFXIV or WOW that force you to quest which kill x monster, go to y point. The game allows you to explore the map and do whatever you want while leveling at the same time.
---
2. The region is semi level scale, in ESO every region monster is the same difficulty, however in GW 2 low level travel to high level zone is dangerous, but when you travel to low level zone you will be scale down.
---
3. The combat is similar to ESO, require you to roll dodge actively, however unlike ESO the blocking is a skill effect, not hold something to block.
---
4. Like ESO, theres a ton of build varieties. Checkout metabattle for more infos.
---
5. Story is freaking great, I thought ESO story telling already is top notch but this game is actually better by a little bit than ESO, really enjoying the quest and lores.
---
6. Similar to ESO theres no limitation on class, every class can play any role.
---
7. One thing I like about this game is the race dont affect your attribute, so you can freely pick whatever race you like !
---
8. The community is as friendly as in ESO one, yeah of course sometime theres a jerk but most people are really helpful.
---
9. The business model is waaay better than ESO.
---
10. The server are actually performing well ( look at you ESO)
---
11. The fashion customisation is better than ESO because you can had a lot of flashy things.
---
12. The mount is the best in any MMOs, in ESO whatever mount is just a skin, while in GW 2 every mount plays differently and had their own purpose.
---
13. Unlike ESO, you no need to grind gear to have a good build for sPVP ( similar to ESO battleground). 
---
13. YOU CAN FLY IN THE SKY AND TRAVEL UNDERWATER.
---
 Both game are great, but GW2 is a better MMORPG in my opinion.
---
Keep him if you have the room.  You may change your mind later and come back to the class and you can still collect the birthday gifts.
---
Side panel doesn't work when screen resolutions change like over generations.
---
Thank you so much as always Tekkit. I'm having a problem tho, whenever i load in markers the only thing that loads are these yellow diamond shaped things. No routes or whatever, any idea?
---
I agree  they are great, but they were meant to be a reward from a challenging dungeon (dungeons were planned to be quite hard) and it wasn't that common. Then Anet decided to put 100s of super shiny skins in the gemstore and in game for not much effort so they are now super common. 
---
I just wish super shines were rarer and/or more tasteful rather than making the game looking like an Eastern mobile game that burns my retinas.
---
yeah, that sucks, my hair always stays the same color, but my armor changes... it's stupid
---
Yeah lol, not letting people write hateful stuff despite it clearly being in the sub's rules is SUCH an SJW move.
---
It's a jump puzzle. Not too difficult, really. As others have said, do a /dance in the middle of the lab for a hidden achievement.
---
well, unless they change it you can keep being excited as it probably will be added at some point in the future, so just be patient =) 
---
since I kinda doubt they added the effects already when the plan was to add the next stage in 1.5 years, and making it reliant on raids seems strange as well, I think it might be available sooner - maybe within 2-3 episodes or so. we'll just have to wait an see. expect it to come at the end of LS5 and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised when it drops sooner than expected.
---
I haven't been able to attend one of these since the very first march, but I'm glad it's still going on!
---
I keep using pieces of the Carapace set for so many of my characters
---
I guess you've unzip that archive:-) You have to put it into POIs Folder without unpacking:-)
---
Still going strong! I hope you'll be able to join us this year!
---
Finally guild mm is on the list. Heart of gold. Knew the dude on TC wvw before he did the JQ buyout.
---
If you do a list of wvw commanders, let their driving videos speak for themselves.
---
I’m not arguing it can’t be done but mounts as a selling feature for S5 would oppose PoF’s very own pillars and features. It would be a repetition. PoF’s official page has a section specifically for mounts and S5 would too? 
---
Mount races, mount unlocks, the metroidvania design of maps, everything in PoF was designed ariund mounts and now S5, an independent release, should too?
---
I don’t see them giving more of the same through S5. The simple fact we need to discuss workarounds kinda show it wouldn’t feel natural.
---
There are tons of different means they can explore for underwater movements without resorting to mounts.
---
Hang in there! For all we know the upcoming official release of build templates (whenever the hell it actually releases) may also solve this UI issue. If it doesn't then I'll be sure to repost your complaint for you!
---
The bosom is a bit higher.
---
That's fair, I completely understand where you're coming from in terms of not being able to run around when engaging multiple mobs. 
---
This DPS rotation is probably best used against mobs with large HP pools - champs and maybe elites. As you said, against single 80 mobs they should die instantly. Personally I'd use holographic shockwave pretty often in the open world due to the AoE CC for some breathing room. 
---
To be honest, I wouldn't worry too much about completing your DPS rotation or not interrupting your autoattack chain in the open world. It will drop your DPS but against multiple mobs, your suvivability comes first. I would swap the photon wall for hard light arena in almost all open world cases, as it gives you fury, protection and regen as well as giving you a massive AoE pull on your toolbelt skill similar to the mesmer's focus 4. It's nice to swap it back to photon wall against single targets. 
---
In the open world, I'd also swap out the turret for grenades so that you have the option for running around/range DPSing if needed. This will reduce the efficiency of static discharge, so you could swap that out for Reactive Lenses. 
---
Overall, these changes sacrifice single target DPS for the sake of versatility and survivability; when you're fighting multiple mobs in the open world, you really don't need THAT much DPS.
---
They can add fix to gemstore.
---
I don't know if that's true but if it is then the german translation, which calls the thing "Himmelsschuppe" (Sky Scale) is even more awful than I previously assumed
---
This is the build I run most often in the open world: 
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQJAsenEIDlIjlYBWIDcJjFIkqvkT5YGcb+mT4LAimpB-jxRBQBA4BAkk9HwjeiIoE8BnAgio8Lgq/AA-e
---
I do swap grenade for almost any other skill depending on the situation and swap the grenadier (explosives) for blasting zone when not using grenades. 
---
Vampirism is an amazing open world rune as it heals you as you bash through mobs. Alternatively you could use rune of Strength as you'll be generating might pretty frequently. 
---
You might prefer the healing turret for burst heals with blast finishers, but I like the frost aura. It's probably not optimal, haha.
---
They actively admitted they were starting to focus on other projects and not on GW2, but sure, keep thinking everything was flowers and rainbows.  
---
Also, maintenance mode doesn't mean "do jack shit", i means do bare minimum. Even Diablo 3 still adds stuff and that game IS 100% in maintenance mode.
---
More like this sub loves to suck up to Anet at every single opportunity.
---
Yeah I wanted to upgrade my own home instance with all the nodes, so far I only have the quartz and spockets which I got a long time ago. But it looks like to be a bad investment right now.
---
what region are you
---
Well isn't it sad you have to create new accounts just to "protest" something that doesn't even has to do with you?
---
vision is easier imo. you have more timegates to deal with, but you don't rely on RNG for the most part, and the currencies are easier to accumulate... also helps that S4 maps currently enjoy a decent population injection.
---
Gamers Giving Back has a guild. You can contact one of the people listed in the graphic (spoiler alert: one of them is me!) and we can invite you. We're also on discord. If you want to send me a PM on discord (AngelWriter428#3999) I can get you an invite there as well :)
---
Looks more like a lobster to me
---
Oh wow! I don't play enough to get legendary armor or a bazillion different ascended pieces, I only have one full set of ascended armor after 6 and a half years of playing lol! But I do have a bazillion airship parts, this will be great for trying out new builds.
---
As per May 24 update from [Arcdps website](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/):
---
&gt;may.24.2019: disable drawtext (healthbar) on any chainload (for dx9vk).
---
I'm not using dx12 but using Gw2Hook, and still can't see the healthbar too, hopefully this will be fixed on next releases.
---
I'll be there, dyed in black-grey-white-purple. B)
---
Skyscales: praise burning joko
---
Flame Legion: what is this, a cross over episode
---
Oh noe. How dare we celebrate an event that is not all about you.
---
TIL that scale also means something like climb.
---
I went on removeddit to see the deleted comments, I find it astounding that people that play a game like GW2 which lets be honest is a pretty campy, game could have such a issue with something like this.
---
\&gt;when you can't refute what the other person is saying so you dig through their comment history
---
Cute.
---
P.S. Facts aren't transphobic &amp; homophobic garbage.
---
I think the main difference is that Aurora needs more achievements/events/certain tasks, while Vision needs more raw map currencies.
---
The set is called "Mistward Armor" and it is acquired through a set of collections that are unlocked upon completing one school of traits with a Revenant-class character. For example, learning all "Salvation" school traits will unlock the collection achievement that rewards the chestplate.
---
The collections are very simple. Essentially they are completed by unlocking the wardrobe skins of 4 other sets of heavy armor, participating in one world boss encounter or meta-event, and purchasing one item from a merchant with that map's specific currency. The chestpiece part is bought with nuhoch crystals in tangled depths, the boot part is bought with bandit crests in the silverwastes, and so on.
---
I hate them solely because they look out of place in their environment.
---
Funny how all those countries are full of black and brown people.
---
Really activates the almonds.
---
Username checks out
---
This slacktivism always seems so hollow regardless of what game it happens to be in. But everyone is free to participate or not after all.
---
It's not a true meta but it is on that timer. Gives the same loot as before
---
Both the Holosmith elite spec and mounts are all tied to the purchase of Path of Fire expansion.
---
Funny thing is everyone's known about the Akili bugs for a long time lmfao.
---
Don't worry, on the main event, the love overwhelmingly drowns out the haters :P Last year we even had some visits from ANet peeps and that made a difference too!
---
Im all for auras and stuff... but this seems... just a bit too much.
---
I'd say less timegating really. Aurora requires the Henge from S3E5 and that takes weeks.
---
Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient. you are neonazi hidden in mod robe.
---
I think the early bits in Dragonfall sort of outstay their welcome, I get the narrative point they wanted to include but really it feels bad when you are basically going to (effectively) the same places twice once for the egg and once for the sick skyscale (which you likely saw on your first trip but couldn't do anything about).
---
Outside of that the collection has honestly been really fun, say what you will about the currency grind I think it is just good design, even though the caps on the meta's do make it feel really artificial.
---
I generally disagree. I'm using the medium set pretty heavily and none of my mediums are human.
---
I'd say that necro is fun even while leveling up, but it's been 6years since I actually did it. Warrior too can be fun while leveling
---
&gt; I wasn't trying to refute anything cause you didn't make any points.
---
There it is. The cop-out.
---
&gt;I'm just saying... you play games to get away from queer people 
---
Nice strawman. I said I play games to get away from "identity politics" such as...
---
&gt;given its plethora of queer characters, but anyway
---
People having to wear their identity like ticks in beard.
---
&gt;and I play games to get away from people who hate queer people
---
WEW LAD
---
&gt;Looks like neither of us are getting what we want, but I knew that going in
---
Did you know going in that I'm not straight? You should have since you dug through **5 fucking pages of comments I made** and overlooked a similar comment I made in a subreddit for ogling pictures of naked men.
---
&gt;you're the one that's triggered by some queer people walking.
---
["I'M NOT TRIGGERED, YOU'RE TRIGGERED!"](https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/096/564/2f7.jpg)
---
So you got basically nothing other than you.
---
Happy to be of help. It's something I've struggled with as well, and I've answered this question for others too. Warrior physical skills are really the best answer.
---
Here's a link to a guide I found on a thread a few days ago here, and the warrior section lines up well with what you might be wanting:
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/870015
---
You can do cook+jeweler for less than 20 gold.
---
Can the springer stick to the tree while you reach up and grab the ball?
---
Like it says in the actual post, the fundraiser is on [JustGiving](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tyria-pride-2019). The donations go directly to Rainbow Railroad.
---
People can also donate directly to Rainbow Railroad through their website if they wish, but we use the donation tracker on JustGiving for the various prize giveaways.
---
I'm saying that their time and effort is best put elsewhere because even with the removal of all particle effects you're not going to achieve anything greater than what you can already achieve with the current settings.  "More options" are not always better if those "more options" take development time that could be spent on getting a real fix to the underlying issue.  It's not like waving a magic wand and all of a sudden we have an additional 20 graphics options, ya know?
---
Eu
---
I can never hit the ones in the air. Have to fly through them 3 or 4 times to get it to register.
---
i would love to join but i don't play the game much anymore :( HAVE FUN!!!!!!
---
No skyscale I  guess? Skyscale makes it very easy (even though you sometimes you need to fly over it few time to get).
---
It's better, because of gemstones  
---
However it would be very benefitial if those metas were 'moved around' so that they don't overlap, atm if you do Augury Rock (which is on its own strange, you have to wait 20 min for the last events for the chest) you're missing out on Casino and A Desolation meta
---
###NOTMYPARADE
---
Central Tyria is HUGE. You can spend a good six months just exploring the Core maps. The only real gottcha with purchasing is storage space but that's more of video game players being natural hoarders, pack-rats.
---
Same rewards in each chest, but you can get to more chests per meta.  Much less annoying to do solo/duo.
---
Oh also
---
&gt;Hopefully the people who are able to network online can bring real change and have real events to create the movements needed to bring LGBT rights to their home countries :)
---
Despite what all the haters are commenting here, I'd say most attendees of the event are not actually interested in politics :P They just want to have a fun event where they can talk about queer topics and make some friends, which tbh is valid too.
---
There are much more effective avenues to enact social change than getting together in Guild Wars 2, but for some people, it makes the game they love that much more of an accepting place. We do what we can, but we know the fight for LGBTQ rights will not be won in Guild Wars 2 :P
---
But knowing that there's a whole community of people out there that loves and supports them, might make a few people's days better, and for those going through the hardest times in their lives, might even be lifesaving, like my gaming community was for me 10 years ago. I'm just trying to pay it forward.
---
Did not think I would enjoy these as much as I did! Very cool to see content about the community that isn't creator-centered.
---
It should be illegal to gay and a fucking trans subhuman mongol everywhere in the world.
---
You don't have to be a regular player to enjoy the event :P And since GW2 has no subscription, you don't have to do anything special to join, just hop in on June 22 and join in on the fun! :D
---
This is one of those comments that could be playfully tongue in cheek or astoundingly insensitive. Lack of context makes it hard to tell.
---
**GIVE US WARDROBE FOR TRINKETS!**
---
Lets us hide/apply legendary auras and lets us swap out the appearance of our items for the **hundreds** of unused trinkets that are filled with loving flavour text scattered around the world. It's win/win/win!
