Gratz! I really love opening unid gears, droped Spark from blue ones :3

Missed again T\_\_\_\_\_\_\_T.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ty anyway :D It's nice to see people giving out some Quiznos codes. Hope I can get one in the future! :D
---
Well that's also normal. Been playing for 6 years and there's only so much a game can do to keep you fresh. Game hoping is actually healthy.
---
&gt; Oh btw you should be afraid of alfred.very afraid
---
I know. Isn't he like some ex secret agent or something for the MI6?
---
GW2 is partnered with Quiznos which is a mostly dead sandwich chain. Back in the 2000’s prior to a bankruptcy, Quiznos also had weird advertisement choices. This is comparing the choice by Anet to use sugarcube’s “AAAAHHHHHH” quote to that of the mutant hamsters by Quiznos in 2004.
---
Huh. Then what was that sub place I went to that was NOT Subway?
---
Yes, you are still talking. I know you are a bit slow but cmon!!!
---
You should try sex one of these days btw!
---
Player returning after about 6 years of inactivity, got a question with gem store stuff. 
---
I've just found out that you can buy Shared inventory slots, Material Bank slots, and a couple of other things I seem to need (read: want), but I've also missed the September anniversary sale. 
---
They don't seem to come on sale often, but is it worth waiting for another one or just suck it up and grab them now?
---
I went to a Quiznos not too long ago. And I'm not even in the US.
---
Ya. Nope. Not allowed.
---
As far as I'm aware the only time you can do anything like this is got musical instruments.
---
According to their UK site there's total of 3 in entire London out of 6 in UK overall. ~~Un~~fortunately the offer is only for US and Canada anyway.
---
i neeevar heard anything about any of these, but thanks, will look into it xD
---
I would honestly rather have a tempest or healren than a scourge anyway, they have better healing output from range. 1200-1500 range heals on the reapers means you can be in the middle of the arena and heal any Reaper that needs it. 
---
Everything comes down to group exp though. Most exp groups only run 1 healer in most fights nowadays anyway, as their DPS can avoid almost all the mechanics and know their classes well enough to self sustain with a druid pumping boons to them. No fight is IMPOSSIBLE with 2 druids, but I would say that Zosin is correct in saying it's meta to run 2 on Largos/Dhuum but most fights are usually Druid, Chrono, Healbrand, Alacren, BS and 5 DPS.
---
No one said this was going to be a 3D representation of Cthulhu. Taking inspirations from something isn't copying it. When they say they look into eldritch horrors for inspiration they mean taking visual elements to instill a sense of power, dread and the unknown. Not necessarily something cosmic and unimaginable.
---
Takes lots of dedication to reach rank 2k in WvW and max out your pips weekly, that alone is deserving enough of an armor IMO.
---
As for PvP, haven't played enough of the game mode lately to know how hard or long it is to get it there.
---
Is this gonna be a WvW only change? I'm sick of necro getting shafted in PvE :(
---
One. You got Dusk after opening the 1 green UG that dropped Dusk.
---
Inexcusable that they haven't done anything about performance in all these years. I'm starting to think the reason they don't isn't shit to do with the engine but rather that with every one running around with higher FPS, unloading a ton of skills in meta would highlight even more blatantly how bad the servers are. A posisbiity maybe. Or just like bug fixing, ANet can't be added because working on that shit doesn't earn money. Remember they have a whole team working on Gem store skins and 1 person working on bug fixes lol (I wish I was joking when I said that).
---
Actually no, it is useful, especially for new characters you make and we'd to TP to new areas. Also, saves you loading up a Weweb page anyway and allows quick teleporting. Since it's only 400 gems I don't think it's that bad a price and is worth it. There's plenty of junk on the store that is more expensive.
---
Choosing charr is the hard mode of Fashion Wars.
---
I recommend buying it. The game right now for someone new is great! There's tons of things to do, hours upon HOURS of gameplay and overall it is still a **good game**.
---
The issue you will run into WAY later that us vets are having a problem with is that the company is changing for the worse and you'll see that maybe 300+-ish hours in perhaps of essentially wasted potential. You'll see a game that could be the best ever, the ground work is there and you'll see what it is currently unless they change their ways.
---
It's one of those scenarios where I kinda wish I were you right now and being able to relive all the content fresh from the start as weird as that may sound...
---
I asked for evidence to support your premise. You provided none.
---
After entering stealth, I keep finding myself getting target/hit. How come?
---
Also, I was just roaming around and I came across that one big event where there's a huge boss in the Godslost Swamp and despite the fact that having so many other players around dropped my FPS enough to be counted with a single hand, I suddenly instadied to something that seemingly had no 'indication/charge-up/telegraphed' animation. I know oftentimes there are red range indicators for when that area will deal damage but I just get hit by 'something' instantly chunking 80% to 90% of my health. I try to dive away and get as far away as I can but by that point something else would've just killed me or I need to completely 'leave' combat just to get health back (which I doubt is optimal).
---
Next, as ranger, what's the main differences between greatsword as opposed to sword/dagger?
---
And finally, is the Alpine Wolf at least an average pet? It's so damn cute but I'm afraid it might not be at least average.
---
I’d like to remind you that they have shafted necro the moment gw2 launched. No plans to change that pattern have emerged. Just expect it every patch.
---
The external benchmark says inflation.
---
The internal benchmark from the only common item which hasn't received a significant additional source says inflation.
---
You are lying. Stop.
---
Open world. Doesn’t matter.
---
Woodenpotatoes has a series going about Open world builds. Here is the Ele build he suggests: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esD3qMYRWf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esD3qMYRWf8)
---
WoodenPotatoes is a Youtuber who has done amazing lore videos going back to guild wars 1.  At some point he became “video game famous” and his new videos can somewhat reflect that, in that he’s become very opinionated.  But his older stuff is so good he almost should get a free pass forever.
---
Heard this as well.  There's no way in hell a $12 prime rib sandwich doesn't make a profit unless the store is paying retail for all of the ingredients.
---
Thanks for the link I'll be sure to check It out when I get time!
---
neither pvp nor wvw leggy armor have unique skins. they share the one of whatever t2 or t3 piece you upgrade.
---
that being said the t3 skins do still hold some prestige.
---
Thanks for the welcome! The game looks like a lot of fun
---
Yeah I know right? It's probably an actively worse decision I do agree. Any other major sub chain could have hit a lot more potential takers be it veterans or new players getting promotional stuff. I give Kung Fu Tea one other thing too, at least they're slightly international, GW2 is not just a US game, but it's definitely not simple to do promos like that with brands crossing borders that's for sure
---
Lol sounds familiar to some other games I have played. I'll ask around in game
---
It was confirmed in the Charity Live Stream that Anet did that Necromancer is the most popular profession in the game, so... You make a comment like that then guess what? They're gonna flag your post my dude.
---
That sounds great I'll be sure to add you when I can hop on next!
---
Didn't know there was in game books. I'll be sure to look out for them. Thanks!
---
I'm not "lying" about anything, I am *disagreeing* with you. 
---
You cited gem -&gt; gold conversion of evidence of inflation. That is not how inflation works. 
---
If the USD were subject to inflation, then the cost of gas would go up, bread, milk, various other staple goods. 
---
If the exchange rate between the USD and, say, the British Pound were to rise, such that $1 would convert into less pounds than it did give years ago, then that would not be inflation. Inflation might be taking place *alongside* that change, but that isn't necessarily what is happening, and you could not take that change in exchange rate as evidence of inflation. You would *only* be able to measure inflation *internally* to the US economy. 
---
So likewise, the gold-&gt;gem exchange rate is irrelevant to inflation. To measure the inflation rate in Tyria, you would need to track the prices of a variety of staple items in the game, things that tend to always be useful, and see how their prices have shifted over time. If they have not risen vs. gold significantly over time, then that is not inflation. 
---
What matters to inflation is not how many games 10K gold costs to buy, but rather, what items you can purchase for 10K gold off the economy.
---
You don't need to be rank 2k to get WvW ledgie armor. Thata just a different skin.
---
Maybe it’s because KFT and Quizno’s are the only brands that are willing to have anything to do with Anet. GW2 is a very niche game I doubt they could catch the interest of any bigger corporation. 
---
Or Anet’s marketing is lazy af and only choosing food places around Seattle that they like.
---
Omg I almost forgot about this one. Incredible
---
Staff is great for open world, since it has a bit of everything; decent healing, great aoe damage, and a bunch of crowd control to defend yourself or smash boss breakbars.
---
The rotations for it are really obvious, in general you just use fire for damage, cast abilities when ready, switch into other attunements when you need an ability. The elite specs and more complex builds spend more time swapping attunements and can get truly insane rotations.
---
&gt; It's a good thing I provided an example of the in-game value of gold via mystic coins for you to lie about then, isn't it. 
---
When was this? I honestly did not notice it. Let me go back through the comments. . . Oh, you edited a previous post. That's fine, but don't accuse me of "lying" for having responded to you prior to that edit. 
---
Ok, mystic coins have risen in value over time, but over the past two years they've only risen by 60%, and that's just one item. Individual items can change significantly in game if their usefulness is improved, or if the methods of acquiring them change. Compare that to something like Orichalcum Ore, which has dropped in price to 1/10th as much over that period, or Ecto, which has dropped by 60%. You would need a pretty wide spectrum of items to determine actual inflation in the Tyrian economy. I don't claim to have all those figures at hand, and apparently neither do you, which is fine, but if you *do* want to make any claims that the Tyrian economy is inflating, you would *need* to acquire that data.
---
&gt;New system is worse than the old. &lt;- Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.
---
I would argue that for those that use the same weapons and play multiple game modes but only have 1 build per gamemode it is worse than the old.
---
BUT it has potential to be better with a simple change to let you tag a build for auto swapping
---
They are supposed to give you a code with the purchase of any sub, but some locations are willing to give people multiple. Some locations just have a big stack of them up for grabs, no purchase required.
---
Everyone is justifying the ban with "You called him dumb," which is implying that that is all it takes. Someone else said that personal attacks, if reported, always get you a suspension.
---
It would seem the goal of this new age censorship is to make everyone weaker, and have them cry to authority at the slightest test of their fortitude.
---
Dude, there's legendary armor in WvW  that you can get with minimal crafting.  The gen 2 legendaries don't really take much beyond a bunch of crafting that can also be done with rewards from WvW reward tracks.  There's really no excuse to have played that long and have no legendaries.
---
That's the t3 skin. Legendary can be made with the t2.
---
[removed]
---
Careful, correlation does not always equal causation. Whether or not you agree with past changes, that does not mean they are balancing for a game they don't play. Lack of communication does not mean that either.
---
There *is* an RP community in this game, but personally? I don't really think this game really encourages roleplaying due to the lack of immersive qualities, lack of roleplay support or attention (like emotes and things of that nature), massive quality of life features that pull you out of the game, and the general arcady nature of the game. To me, RPing in this,would be like RPing in a Jack and Daxter game or something.
---
I'm leaning more towards the latter given how unaware  some of the devs seem to be about things that go on outside their bubble.
---
You can check the sale history of each on the wiki but if it were me I'd wait at least a month to see if they do any good wintersday sales. Past that it's up to you how long you hold out since the QoL is pretty high with storage upgrades. Also of note is that you do get 2 shared slots with the expansions if you haven't already gotten them ([like $20 on sale here](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807)).

Lol, I'll never get that many. gj!
---
Some people prefer to actually play the game.
---
The solution is more strips, and reducing the number of boon ticks in favour of longer duration. The point is to make the strips have a meaningful impact on gameplay. Pulsing  / low cooldown boons should never have been a thing (stability possibly being the only exception).

Corrupts need to be handled with more care, else we will end up in the condi cancer spam pit again.

Comparing items that have changed rarity and had additional sources of acquisition added is utterly and completely dishonest. You are not comparing like for like at all.

---
Stealth isn't invulnerability, it's invisibility.  Against NPCs, if any of them are mid-attack when you stealth, their attacks will still finish.  If an attack is a channelled ability such as the Ranger's Rapid Fire that uses multiple attacks, even if you stealth mid-skill all the rest of the arrows will come at you even though you're invisible, though after that the Ranger will be unable to target you further.
---
NPCs are stupid and won't initiate new attacks on you while you're stealthed.  PCs are not stupid in PvP, and will continue to swing their weapons while you're invisible because they know you're somewhere and they might be able to hit you.  Furthermore, if you're hit by someone's auto-attack while invisible, they'll move on to the second hit in their auto-attack chain, so even though there's no sound that they hit you or damage numbers, they'll know they made contact with something.  I know your question is probably made with PvE in mind, but sharing some info never hurts.
---
Against the Shadow Behemoth in Godslost Swamp, the area in the middle where it eventually appears pulses heavy damage.  If you're very laggy due to the number of players, it's possible you won't notice the visual cue of dark black energy swirling there, as there are no red AoE indicators.  It's just a murky mess of death that you need to not go into.
---

I never understand these stupid posts. 2 days walking around Queensdale? Really? Were you on mushrooms at least?
---
The seeds come from specific plants, the plants are in specific zones. [Varietal Peppercorn Seeds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Varietal_Peppercorn_Seed) for instance come from: Herb Patch (Queensdale), Herb Seedlings (looks like any region, need to check wayfarer still), Herb Sprouts (any region), Mature Herbs (Timberline Falls), Verdant Herbs (Thunderhead Peaks/Bitterfrost Frontier), and Young Herbs (Ascalon/Shiverpeaks). Region determines which 4 things an herb node drops.

This is like insta kill for all minis collector players, especially if you live outside of US.
---
Im not sure about ANet marketing, but in my work place, disappointing customer = less income.
---
I think the problem that the systems announcement seems to have addressed was that while balance was sometimes split across modes, there wasn't really a dedicated balance split in their team's workflow, so devs who mainly focused on PvE could push balance changes that negatively impact PvP and vice versa.
---
I would love to have that great axe
---
Can’t post my build, but i really like playing Weaver with sword and dagger, it’s incredibly fun.
---
Who ever does marketing for guild wars 2 needs to explain why they are so afraid of doing twitch drops like warframe does or eternal? Why cant i link my account and watch twitch and get drops like dye outfits or armor?
---
Ez bait. Mad much?
---
Nearest Quizons is 4500 km, while nearest Kung Fu Tea is 6000 km, too. It's quite an improvement ...
---
Going to be 100% honest, I don’t see this as a problem and what the hell did you expect when you asked him for his opinion? That it was going to be the exact same as yours?
---
They should add a Fractal set. But, you know,  resources and stuff.
---
:o that's from the original GW1 outside of ascalon - that might help your search better - it was in "lakeside county" in presearing

I've been playing WoW classic since launch, and leveling is the most tedious borefest. 
---
It's specifically designed to be as annoying as possible, and I will never ever level another toon. Everything about it screams, "drag this out as along as possible to get more sub months".
---
It's awful. The ONLY thing that makes it tolerable is playing with friends. 
---
Haven't played lost ark, although watched a decent amount on twitch, but as d4 is seemingly ripping off all its features,  I'll try that when it comes out I guess.
---
WvW looks pretty good.  They're actually announcing changes and shifting up the meta.
---
Useful comment. Hopefully your big brain allows to read sarcasm
---
That's just setting yourself up to be disappointed. Again.
---
That makes sense. I accept it as armor now.
---
This. Silverwastes RIBA farm is pretty much similar.
---
You can also try the world boss. There’s always people doing them.
---
And if you have HoT one day, the meta events are very fun to do. The last map is somewhat similar to the lab.
---
Yeah, there are a whole lot of posts rotating between denial, anger, and bargaining as of late. It's the denial folks that make me the most upset.
---
For me, at least, this system is comparable to alcohol in a way. It has done some good for the world as well as some bad. I personally don't like the taste but that is just me, plenty of people love it. But plenty of people also agree when it comes to the basic rules of alcohol: no kids and (try to strive for) moderation; don't treat every afternoon like a frat party. Beyond those two points things start to get bad: substance abuse, violence, addiction, long term health issues, etc. And this stuff effects the community when it becomes to widespread. The rules are in place to protect not only the people from the alcohol, but the people from the people. These things have and will happened without these rules.
---
The problem I have with certain microtransactions (loot boxes, certain "pay to win faster" or "pay for convenience") is that it has ZERO regulation behind it. They aren't even 'micro' anymore. Right now, anything goes. You get games like Battlefront II that where so designed around boxes that it literally destroyed the game's progression from them being removed for their rework. People feeling obligated or guilt tripped into paying with some games preying off the human desire to fit into society. And talking about JUST FIFA's payment system alone could be its own college class (at my school it fucking was)(microtransaction and game payment system elective was basically 60% FIFA and EA)). The community and the games around it are being damaged. Its just going too far.
---
GW2 has not even come close to the level of the Triple A industry and probably never will, but every time they do stuff like this it inches closer to this mentality of creating to extract. The way they created this system was 1st about getting people to pay money, then about adding convenience. It also doesn't help considering the problem of the souring community right now, which started on top of other problems needing to be addressed. 
---
Sry for the walls but I strongly believe that without some form of moderation or limits things will only get worse for the industry as a whole.
---
Nope, never heard of this before. It's before my time on the internet and kind of far from the stuff I watched at the time.
---
Tough question.
---
The thing is that, if you're gonna make an investment into this game, you have to pretty much accept you're buying a single-player, shared world experience, and not an MMO. As of now, endgame content has been pretty much abandoned in favor of expanding the single player experience, which is 2-3 hours of extra content + grinding every 3 months.
---
Our release cadence is abysmal compared to other multiplayer online games. Destiny 2 is cheaper than GW2 (sans season pass business model) and I've found it to pack a bigger punch for the price tag, and is way more polished.
---
That said, GW2 is a blast as a new player, but in the long shot it might not be the best investment, depending on what you're looking for. The Witcher 3 on a sale will net you even more maybe.
---
Every single one of the 10+ Quiznos in my city is permanently closed according to Google Maps, but hey, at least the promo got me to look.
---
New ded gaem mode, find a Quiznos...
---
Mint only drops from mature (Bloodtide Coast, Blazeridge Steppes, Iron Marches) and verdant nodes (Fireheart Rise, Lake Doric). I'd suggest going to any of those zones, finding the nodes you need and then farming them on multiple characters. You can also use [bounty sickles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Harvesting_Sickle_of_Bounty) to get extra strikes (very useful when harvesting the finished herbs)
---
Not bad. Not one of my favorites but still a great song. This game has a lot of really good music.
---
Doesnt have to be an either/or. Sometimes you want might want engaging gameplay (pvp) and sometimes you just want to chill and enjoy a theme park.
---
I'm aware of boonshare chrono and how it operated, yes. I'm saying that wasn't the source of the toilet bowl meta. Toilet Bowl meta occurred because Reapers had the ability to put out an absurd amount of conditions (on top of their strips) that nothing could realistically clear, so the only counter was to maintain resistance and hope that wasn't the thing that got corrupted. Something like that can't happen again because 1. SoI is dead. 2. Condi clears are in a far better place and 3. Boon spam gets nullified by Winds.
---
The counter play comes from them being on the same level and then utilizing coordination to down/finish small subsets of players INFREQUENTLY. The more corrupt spam there is the more the playing field tilts and flip flops all over the place, the lower TTK is, and the less fun fights are due to unclear win conditions beyond 'Hit the enemy with everything'.

And thanks for the response! I'd like to think the devs will wander in and see this and get a slightly better picture of the game, from both our perspectives.

You just explained why the point of GW2 was to bring more players in. Not change business models.

Yep, really wish they had 1 person checking this stuff each time. I actually love this outfit (minus hat, like mask but not feathers shape on it) for the strange fantasy/80s hybrid, so might get eventually, but still I wholly agree about dyes. Even some armour sets have adjoining details merged into different dye channels sometimes x.x

Canadian with same opinion here. They're my favourite fast food fry.

There was one across the street from me. Closed 5 years ago and I am still sad.

Quiznos, while it was still in business.

The norn shaman outfits... I used to want them so much, but now it's a bit too low res maybe. :/

Sup

There's not even a Quiznos in my state.
---
A-Net partnered up with Quiznos for a promotion, buy a sub to eat and you get a Icebrood Saga code with a mini in it. People are bitching because Quiznos closed in most states.
---
In other words, this sub Reddit is clawing at anything just to rant on A-Net.

I don't know, but seems to me Quiznos would get far more GW2 customers than GW2 would get Quiznos customers.
---
I'd suspect Quiznos was the one looking for a promotion.
---
Remember that well thought out and wonderful promo with kungfu tea? ......this one is even better.......lol
---
Hey, I dropped the lover after opening 10k blue UGs and that's all my RNG gone
---
Lol at the nostalgia goggles. McDonald’s fries taste better now than they did in the past 30 years.
---
That's not a cost cutting measure, that's from the pushback against saturated fats. They haven't used tallow in their fries in years, probably for longer than I've been alive.
---
WP'$ per$onal unbia$ed opinion.
---
i wish, but nah, the game is just shet
---
Only noobies die to raptors.
---
Well, the pizza place was absolutely cost cutting in addition to chasing pizza hut.  They simplified the sauce and added a ton of sugar to try to match the sweetness of pizza hut.  The result was terrible, and their stores started closing left and right.
---
No thank you. I'm good with my own homemade crunchy exterior, fluffy interior, perfectly seasoned and delicious fries, not the soggy salty floppiness that is... all right, time to stop there.
---
I loved it when my girl and I drove 56 miles to kung fu tea and that location "wasn't participating in the promotion".
---
you cant say anything that could even remotely be construed as not positive on the forums.
---
So isn't than an indication of fast food places *improving* by showing cost cutting doesn't always result in franchise diffusion? That's literally capitalism killing the worse chain off for being too cheap.
---
Find a world boss train. Reset is best since you start with Tequatl.
---
There used to be a Quiznos in Bellevue, a very short hop away from ANet's offices, right next to the transit station; and they couldn't even keep that open.
---
It closed up shop and rotated through a couple places before settling with a place that served some absolutely stellar spicy bibimbap bowls. I hope it's still there.
---
especially with my warrior I had a lot of trouble with them.

they use to be made with beef fat and were to some much better

A local book store recently had an event where you could grab as many pc games as you can carry in one hand and pay only 15 Euros for them and they had 2 copies of the original Guild Wars 2. Apparently they sell less than 10 games a month so they decided to get rid of them to not waste anymore space they could instead use for books and obviously there were no AAA-titles from the last 2 years since they sold those on ebay. Those were the last hard copies of GW2 in our town afaik
---
I don't think any ele open world build is better than Scepter/WH Tempest. Several builds work well too.
---
I like Air/Arcane/Tempest which runs permanent protection buffed to -40% damage, stacks might extremely well, has 100% fury uptime, and hits 290% crit damage. It's good solo and great in groups.
---
That skill went away with templates... a person who buys them all is 4 times more likely to be able to counter you because they spent money.
---
Almost as if this post has absolutely no context...
---
AB is nice because the meta is short and will give you a good amount of XP. Dragon's Stand is very interesting too because even if it usually lasts a bit over an hour you get a lot of XP from it, especially if you take some boosters.
---
Then again any of the 4 meta-event will get you a good amount of XP for the time spent on it.
---
Weeds in Cali though! Maybe it's Ashland.

GW2E account value works in mysterious ways ... middle of last month it dropped by around 5000g then slowly went back up and then it is 2000g over previous value(before the 5000g drop). I definitely didn't get anything new during that time for the 2000g to show up.

Lay low for two weeks, then enjoy the next LS episode for a few days and then wait for wintersday to come :D at least thats what I do...

There are actually 5 Quiznos open in the Baltimore suburbs. And I do like their subs better than Subway. My main question is, is it worth the stop just for a mini and a (checks notes) 10 slot bag?
---
this is the kinda outfit that could look  L I T  on charr but mark my words
---
it'll be clippy af, stretched and ruined
---
Quiznos on my Area (Europe) - 0
---
If you have PoF you should already have HoT as well, now.
---
It would be useful to have this close on exit of GW2
---
The Zhaitan battle is solo-able, but it's a massive pain in the ass solo because of the adds that appear when you're trying to shoot the dragon. At least as a ranger I had a pet who could tank for a little bit before they switched aggro to me.

That's how I can afford purchases in BDO and pay for my WoW sub.

Tbh, leather Farm on Lake doric is basically labfarm, just a bit more dangerous.

I got that sweet storm dagger on the first black lion chest I ever opened. I thought "wow these chests arent so bad". 100 chests later full of junk..... "fuck loot boxes"
---
This game is great for a casual player but if you want to make it your main game dont. As soon as you run out of old content this game basicly turn into play for a few days every 2-3 months and wait for new story update or grind gold or farm old content (fractals, raids, pvp, www). There is quite a lot of content so i would say its worth it to pay for whats there but i no longer have faith that the game will improve. We wil get our story update every 2-3 months until they stop developing the game but i dont think there will be any major changes to the game (new game systems, classes, expansions, races).
---
wasnt a thing back then
---
Anet: SHIP IT NOW!
---
Quiznos is dead? Man I liked Quiznos. We only had them for a short time here.
---
Thats how they get you
---
Meh... my helicopter Reaper is not impressed :p
---
Even if you had Quiznos in your area, the promo only available in US and Canada.

Also those small mushrooms, the knockback of those headbutts

I feel like HoT was one big social experiment. They were like: "Lets put all our players into a adrenaline-park zoo with pre-historic dinosaurs, massive bugs, walking mushrooms, acrobatic frogs and talking plants and lets see what happens!"

Yeah, it absolutely doesn't matter. Weaver's not weak against condi at all in general, if played well   
---
\- Sunspot + Smothering Auras synergy basically means they get to remove 1, with extra 2 by transmuting if you need it - every 4-ish seconds. Best bet on fighting one is forcing out both Twists of Fate, after which you just time a CC-into-burst wombocombo when they're waffling about - Doom's poison simply won't stick long enough to be of much consequence on chucking their sustain, so big bursts are a way, as they generally run Signet Of Never Press for healskill and Arcane for minor heals upon every swap, relying on combos for sustain after (water 2 into blasts, etc).   
---
Slb sic'em doesn't really generate a lot of quickness, but for it not having quickness on swaps ain't that crucial at all, maybe channeling 5 will be sometimes clutchy, but nothing else, really.

And What is wrong on that? It is quite expensiv to make worldwide campainges, beside that this is hard to organize, and get threw all that poltical nonsens. And most of this worldwide compaines like twitch and co. a quite expensiv to cooperate with them.

This minipet seems to mean a lot for some of you, right?

Pocket raptor: You’re landing in the wrong neighborhood homie!
---
There's a few in the UK, but nevertheless the campaign is only for US and Canada (and even there some Q's shops have no idea about this action)
---
Probably good idea to spend some time with expansions first, as new epizode will definitely need those masteries.
---
how do you know? That is the problem. you cant always tell if somebody is using it because funny frog meme. Or because they are a white nationalist. They've developed their own code language which makes it difficult to tell. So i don't blame A-net for outright blocking it. Better some people disappointed over over a frog pic, than having a community full of nazi's.

More like random plastic toy.

"Simply "make the account storage for builds unlimited for free, as they are actual templates. Then let players purchase build slots for 500gems each across all characters (limited to 3), and 100g each for a single character (limited to 4) for a total of 10 build slots.
---
Enable players to make equipped (legendary!) items account wide usable across all characters. Enable strings for gear that then searches the account storage for items that have the same stats and runes as in the string. Let players purchase account storage slots for equipment to use across all characters. Start with 30, increase in sets of 30 for 600 gems each. You can decide which items you put in there and then in hero panel equip either from inventory or from account storage. Increase standard gear slots to 3, make additional slots work like build slots. Enable players to link build and gear slots. Enable account storage for gear strings like for build strings and make it unlimited. You can then load strings from the account storage into your actual gear slots which will search automatically for fitting items in account storage and inventory.
---
Enable transmutation slots. Start with 1 Slot and make additional up to 10 purchasable. The slot stores all your transmutation settings independently from the gear you have equipped. Changing items within a slot requires transmutation charges, stwitching between slots does not. Enable players to link transmutation slots to gear slots.
---
Finished. That would be a complete and satisfying system
---
Hey :) I have a new version coming that can be configured to do that
---
&gt; Why is having all build templates unlocked the gold standard of what people expect for free? 
---
Because that's what you'd have in a subscription game. Also because we already had it with arc.
---
It is 2am and I am laughing like a maniac
---
It's been almost 2 months and not a single person has finished this achievement. Good design for a story achi.
---
Email address is already in use, try a different one e
---
G. One you create just for the game
---
I'm no expert but maybe someone is pulling money out of the corp at this point. Would be interesting to know what they paid for the ads.
---
They upped the drop rate at the start of October but I imagine less people are doing the content
---
I remember enjoying this game for its superb graphics... barely... jesus, first the codpiece fiasko outfit, now this. Its getting more ridiculous each outfit.
---
This is a problem in general with most games. I prefer to have a hard copy of my game. Call it old school but that’s the way i like it. But that’s not the Trent in 2019. Same with early access games, you buy even before the the game is ready. Push the game out of the door unfinished and we sell the rest and call it dlc. And yes I do have steam and use it heavily. I do have a preference doesn’t mean I will not use the other.
---
Imagine being able to play - AND STREAM - two different games :o
---
Upped is a bad word. They increased the drop rate but also added new items to the drop table - lowering the drop rate.
---
It's weird they went for this balerina animation for a firebrand who is very much a heavy armour class.
---
i dig the moa but the bubblehead of the ranger is a bit creepy IMO
---
I thought there was something in the GDPR that said that if you request your data and hey delete it so as to not give it to you it is a violation, correct me if my memory is wrong.
---
Of course there are excuses for thing, the biggest is that the support team is still human and they make mistakes.
---
Maybe mad is a wrong choice of words but whatever, in the midst of some posts that are unrealistic, there were many super realistic, yet they were bundled in as internet whining. See my post history and you will see I'm actually very reasonable about what I hoped build templates would be like.
---
I got no further quest text but looked up that I should have gotten "reclaim your purpose" as the next part of the quest and then an npc bird flies down to continue it. But that never happened so I'm not about to sit through that quest again since it's about the fun level and length of a timeshare pitch.
---
&gt; It could be that GDPR being a euro thing seems kind of alien to Americans
---
It's more than alien. After GDPR law went live, many murican websites started to block access for anyone with EU IP adress,
---
Well he wants all his data. Can't be more clear than than. If their support is illiterate its not his fault.
---
Yeah, gotta agree with ya! I guess I wanted to make her more of a chibi, but I completely neglected to put more attention on her face..
---
I might do a follow up where she has a more normal face lol
---
only that this wasn't mean to be an excuse. Explanation, yes but no excuse. there is a difference between those two.
---
They obviously should read the tickets carefully but this can unfortunately happen and happens a lot because those are also just people sitting behind them.
---
For all we know it could be a mistake but sure let's grab our pitchforks because this sub seems to be so eager to do that in the last few years. That is why I said to submit it again and make it formal.
---
Again, this is not an excuse...
---
there's a substantial difference between "didn't read the request properly" and "fuck it delete everything lmao"
---
Well if you take a break for weeks just because you have to do a mission again I think you don't enjoy the game very much.
---
Almost spilled my fancy tetrapack red wine from Aldi x3
---
not reading a request properly is a mistake that humans can make
---
Why not just throw some cosmetic shit out on twitch prime? Maybe a new player stater pack too? I mean FFS it can't be that hard, can it.
---
Even these days with mounts, running along with a skyscale, pocket raptors..... jump, fly, ascend...... fucking pocket raptors are still on me :-|
---
You never skimmed something and understood something differently, it can happen. It shouldn't but they are also just human beings and they do mistakes.
---
I also didn't say that this is OPs fault... and I don't know how you get that Idea which proves my point a bit ;)
---
You can't you have to wait until they fix the bug.
---
Maybe it is a controversial opinion but I would trade the gold-to-gems conversion for having actual MICRO transactions. There are far too many items that cost upwards of $5 (where I personally draw the line when it comes to Micro) on the gemstore imo. For context I've bought 35,200 gems with real money and 16,447 gems with gold. (I love my spreadsheets)
---
Why not just play the AT times and start a real team to try to win the mAT.
---
Or am I confused?
---
You are trying to get people to pvp for “in house” (which a lot of the pvp guilds already do)
---
Look up the guild Absolute Legends [AL] they host in house pvp tournaments almost daily with 100-250g prizes. Sometimes it’s 1v, sometimes it’s 2v, and other times it’s team vs team BUT it’s always a nice prize!! 
---
Mike is the guy who runs them (porteck in game) and yes we are all NA.
---
So while I think the idea is great there are already huge pvp guilds they organize and do this so... why not join one of the larger pvp only guilds in NA (BGW or AL) and set something up inside the guild itself.
---
You’ll get tons of players because those guilds are ONLY pvp. (Well technically speaking AL also does some WvW but not with true commanders or anything so much... We pvp so we are pretty okay with roaming no problem lol)
---
Anyway good luck and have fun, hope to see you around.
---
Try MediaMarkt or Saturn! Got some Gemcard there recently (used it for Extra Life pack)!
---
I take it as you are not a big Twitch user or at least don't use FFZ or BetterTTV. And I guess sodapoppin has a lot of people who might be secret nazis: https://imgur.com/a/sBj1KhT
---
And I guess Trihex himself is a secret Nazi considering he has added several frog emotes to his channel through FFZ: https://imgur.com/a/GQ97ZMi
---
Well then you have to wait for the bug to be fixed, which can take a while especially with bugs that do not happen often.
---
I'mnot saying you are not, just saying a huge chunk of posts are. Just saw a post called "O had a dream Anet did the right thing" or something along those lines, apparently for that guy, the right thing was free unlimited templates, which is a perfect example or unreasonable criticism.
---
Sadly, all the posts that bring reasonable criticism get diluted in an ocean of posts like that, can't blame Anet for not listening when 90% of the feedback is just unreasonable self-entitled crap.
---
People say that Anet fails on communication but the truth is both sides fail miserably, Anet fails on understanding what the playerbase wants in general, and the community (not all, but as I said, gets diluted) fails at presenting a realistic view on a product they would like.
---
&gt; You can't have "well here goes" attitude when messing around with someones personal information
---
I totally agree with that but we all should know how humans work. Everyone makes mistakes and it all could have been a mistake on their part and the message got accidentally deleted (new support staff).
---
What I wanted to say with this is that, how bad this situation is, we don't know the explanation and getting all riled up because of it (since this seems to be THE thing at the moment for this sub) won't help anyone.
---
Submit a formal request and not just a one-liner.
---
Playing the game in English instead of Deutsch omegalul
---
That's some sick mistakes. "Whoupsie I just deleted customer's account and all his traces in the system. Shit happens LOL."
---
&gt;If the ticket got deleted submit a new one and be very clear in what you want instead of just "I want all the data".
---
Implies that its OP's fault for not compensating for possible incompetence of data officer.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cMfkFGP.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/cMfkFGP.mp4)
---
And the items that just had their value added were recently added to said chest in August, my guess is gw2efficiency recently added that new data as previous items in the box had their value tied to the price of the box.
---
Actually, yes. Being a mini collector is something I've simply set my mind on. And you don't stay in Top 25 with missing out on these opportunities.
---
can someone explain the AAAHHHHH thing i keep seeing it around but like what is the original what is the context what is sugarcube etc
---
Each game mode has it's own method to achieve legendary armor.
---
Even though PVE was the first gamemode to get legendary armor it's true that nowadays is probably the hardest was to get, Just because it's tied to the most difficult content of the game.
---
You can get legendary armor in PVP / WvW even being a noob player, but not on PvE. There should be a way to get basic skin legendary armor in PVE with the same level of difficulty that there is in PvP/WvW but of course with the same limitations. For example, pick a common PvE currency (for example karma, it's just an example) and allow to purchase legendary tokens with that currency, with the limitation of only being able to purchase X amount of tokens per month. Then decide how many tokens you need per piece and you are done.
---
&gt; He plays GW2 on stream because that's all his viewers ever want to talk about and frankly, his streams lately are almost entirely chatting with his viewers and reacting to things such as youtube/reddit. To quote what he said a few days ago "GW2 is just a stream wallpaper to me at the moment".
---
Well, if I was a videogame streamer, I would stream the games I like to play and not a game that my audience wants me to bitch about but to each their own i guess.
---
What? Are they insane? That is absolutely a violation. Deleting the account instead of giving the report is ridiculous. And even so they should have at least given you the report first and then deleted the data.
---
I wish that was a thing
---
But Reality is often disappointing
---
These people only like complaining about complaining. The counterarguments have no real substance, other than negativity shouldn't be allowed. They also can't seem to differentiate between criticism and just emotional venting. It's like they're taking the whole thing personally.
---
I agree with that, but when the game is saturated with players where does the money come from. When they sell skins only they can have a steady stream of money.  That’s why i prefer a sub for my mmo long term. B2p is fun as long as it lasts.
---
You must never make mistakes at work huh. And you are completely wrong in your thinking if you want problems like these solved. You should definitely look for reasons why this happened.
---
Heh, good joke, but i'm having similar problems. I mean i'm running out of easy to remember key combinations for everything and then there are other applications that capture certain key combinations. For example i found that some key combinations interfere with the graphic card key shortcuts to start/stop recording or even with the Yolomouse ckey system for setting different cursors.
---
same thing happening to me, ISP Cogent Communications UK
---
isn't there multiple references to this meme in gw2?
---
Where does Anet state that?
---
I can show you the woooorld
---
Having a Charr main sure helps me save money
---
Thank man
---
&gt; He has not paid a single gem for any of the build templates. Stop assuming to know his motivations and ideas, you have put zero time into listening what he has to say apart from out of context clips posted to this reddit and yet you claim to know it all. Stop it, you're looking more stupid and arrogant by the second.
---
I based my statement not only on the posted clip here but on a [conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dm2wrf/build_templates_and_third_party_addons/f4xxlab/?context=3) I had with him on reddit.
---
My account was recently disabled and flagged for deletion after mentioning GDPR (not even requesting anything) with a support communication... I very nearly soiled myself.
---
They didn't delete my account. Seems they deleted all the personal information tied to my account though
---
There’s another one to Eir in the final HoT story in VB
---
Those are probably the BL exclusives that you can also get in a choice box that sells for 2k on the tp while it's not available in BL chests.
---
IMHO it doesn't make sense to value those skins at the overprice of this box.
---
don't know. example?
---
Of course you should look for reasons. 
---
Since it's not the first time, and it hasn't changed, it's most likely a problem with the system - not enough training, not enough emphasis on the issue, no clearly written procedures how to handle these by the support team. It's _not_ an issue with a particular support team member, and a particular team member that reacted this way is not at fault (unless they ignored clearly written and communicated procedures).
---
We are terribly sorry we have deleted your account, please take these complementary 500 gems.
---
[With arcdps](https://i.imgur.com/DXJkVbG.jpg)
---
Wait. You guys believe it'll be fixed? I've already accepted this as a permanent feature 😌
---
I understand that human mistakes happen, and if that was the case on this case then it was, not much you can do about it. That's ok for me, shit happens. The problem lies in their support service automation as well, because this mistake shows that somehow my message that is classed as personal information request got handled as a information deletion request.
---
I just want that they fix their support automation so that this doesn't happen anymore. And the situation is still that this happened a few years back when all the GDPR stuff started and people were asking their private information and they were back then deleting data when people were requesting data. I thought that all was already sorted out and fixed.
---
Actually on their Google+
---
Arenanet is running a promo with Quiznos.
---
They chose a dead restaurant for a dead game
---
I Think you will have more success getting attention to this issue by using Twitter or any other social media directly instead of reddit.
---
You can prove them wrong.
---
Dragonhunter guardian is the way to go. Just aggro them all. Pop a trap and bye bye raptors
---
I'm tired of seeing this bullshit being repeated all the time. It's been used both ways countless times over years (both ways = when you don't have gold or when you have gold). Anet lets you farm a lot of gold ? Yeah, that's because they want you to buy gems with gold so they earn more money. Anet makes something too expensive ? Yeah, that's because they want you to buy gold with gems so they earn more money. Just stop trying to link ingame economy balance with the gold/gem exchange. Seriously just stop.
---
Btw, their gemstore revenue is ultimately tied only to gemstore purchases. It doesn't matter if you buy gemstore stuff with gold, with $£€, if you exchange gems for gold or gold for gems. In all cases, the $£€ they get corresponds directly to gemstore purchases. 1 character slot reward them 10€ : if you buy 800 gems with 10€ they get 10€, if you buy 800 gems with whatever gold it takes then someone else paid the 10€ for you and sold the gems, if you buy 800 gems with 10€ and sell them for gold then they're bought by someone who will use them (for a character slot for example). Gold/gem exchange has a gold tax but then it's only a gold sink : no gems are created or destroyed there (yes it's true, no it's not my opinion or theory, yes there are dev comments confirming that and no I won't search them for you). The only time their revenue doesn't equal gemstore purchases is when they gift you gems for some pvp tournament, AP chests, giveaways ; or on the other hand when you hoard gems (until you spend them).
---
But did they die?
---
Not GDPR-compliant, just that no one could ask them to comply since they didn't operate it for EU users.
---
Yes, I still do have access to my account. Also yes, I could be more definitive about what I want, but I really do want all the data tied to my account or that is some way linkable to me. That is one of the reasons GDPR was made so people would have a possibility to access all data that is tied to them from companies.
---
I'm just baffled that something like this could even happen, that they would only skim over a GDPR request and accidently delete information without double checking the request. And this has happened before, why isn't there some fail safes for something like this
---
Personal information is not your account though .... they just won't be able to determine the ownership of the account but it isn't gone.
---
Ayy u got the good stuff homie?
---
[Yooooooo?](https://imgur.com/a/w4FSN0q)
---
It's cancer in gamemodes with no nearby objectives. Stealth is less of an issue in PVP because you know enemies will always be in the vicinity and lots of cover is provided to prevent snipe and run tactics.
---
The rules are bullshit in the first place. Thanking them for granting exceptions is... kinda pathetic.
---
We should have a proper API for providing UX extensions and tools.
---
But it seems they're doubling down on the casual players, so why bother?
---
I hate those things, they hunt me in my nightmares!
---
Nothing left to do in classic until phase 2.
---
Delta did a better job... again
---
From what I hear, the raider scene is actually much more healthy in Europe than in the US. Atleast, I never really see the empty LFGs that those US screenshots sometimes post
---
When your job description is to read, not to skim - you're clearly not doing your job if you're skimming.
---
again, you seem to more interested in discussing myself than the topic at hand.
---
Well that's nothing new, all their marketing campaigns have been aimed at only US &amp; Canada as far as I remember
---
which is still, technically, GDPR-compliant
---
I like this style :) well done
---
Nice strawman you got there
---
&gt; He has not paid a single gem for any of the build templates
---
 Yes he did. For his main necro.
---
Can someone give any advice to how should I play WvW?
---
I have no guild, I play alone, I join WvW and don't what to do. Area is large and I have no mount so it takes soo long to get anywhere. I don't know where people from "my" world are. I don't know where should I go, how to farm currency (this is all I care about in this mode tbh). Oh and 2/3 of Battlegrounds are non-english. So even when there is a commander I don't know what he says

And pvp, and wvw. If you want to see the direction these modes are headed, you can always just look at NA.

Incoming: "Doing something good does get rid of what Anet did wrong" or "They just did it because they needed good press"  
---
But yes it is nice to hear that Anet and we can help such a good cause :)
---
I agree. Whales are the target audience.
---
The rest of you? Fuck off and find another game to play. You're too ungrateful to develop content for.
---
To give you an idea of the marketing black hole that ANet has hitched themselves to:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuPTZWhz46M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuPTZWhz46M)
---
I feel bad for people who want the mini and can't get it, but at least they won't be subjected to this disgusting 'food'.
---
I'd go further and say that non-spending players are part of the **content** sold to spending players. That is, there's reason to keep a certain "base" amount of them around to serve as window dressing for the game, to make it look better and more engaging for those players you actually want to engage because they pay your bills.
---
Nope just to give credit where credit is due.
---
Looks like we had about 10 in the UK with 3 still operating in the south.
---
Yep I'm sure you that is what you wanted :) But I was speaking of this sub ;)
---
Their marketing campaigns have been aimed at companies that are non existing on the market. They actually benefit from these campaigns, unlike Anet who doesnt get almost anything out of it.
---
Stop making sense. Anet bad!
---
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH. random nobody 2017
---
Not necessarily. The new items could just occupy part of the previous unid slot, we have zero idea how they implemented it actually
---
They work as a single armor piece. You dye everything as a whole (3/4 different dyeable channels that is) with dyes that you own. You cant mix and match with other armor pieces.
---
Because they have no clue about twitch, they ban random emotes they think are "bad", their chat is moderated like their forums, everything thats negativ or legitimate questions getting timeouted or banned.
---
That's not how it works. Drops for a slot are rolled from the most rare to the least rare. For example, if you roll equipment from blue unid gear:  
---
* you first roll 0.3% (1:333) chance to get exotic piece  
---
* next you roll 1% (1:100) chance to get rare piece  
---
* finally you roll 11% (1:9) chance to get masterwork piece  
---
* if you still were unlucky - you got piece of fine rarity.  
---
What is also possible is that chest in question is contained in additional loot slot that just checks if it should drop or not.
---
By the way - it's also explanation why magic find is so good in GW2 in some cases. Previous to the unidentified gear it was possible to completely eliminate fine rarity drops from blue gear - because any of higher rarity rolled first. That also explains why "common" or drops from Lucky Envelopes are surprisingly much rarer than "uncommon" drops when opened with high MF.
---
That's a good point, thanks. The marketing for this game is almost curiously bad.
---
You imply that if you deny sth it automatically didnt happen :)
---
Might boon is the problem since the Dawn of this game, which allowed for even faster instanced content clearing, ele celestial builds back in days, melee trains in WvW, and just overall working in conjunction with any dmg increase we got as the game progressed. It is the big source of dmg increase, even for one player, but when combined with many more, it is just so much stronger and allows for insane powercreep. It is also combined with vulnerability conditions that are easily applied in stacks these days. I wish might boon and vulnerability see a drastic change in how they work, how they are applied, and how strong they are.   
---
The stability boon is also a problem. I do not think that CC should be as ignored as it is. I do not think that it is a good idea to allow zergs to always be on top of each other and not allow anyone to get caught in CC unless they themselves make a big mistake which is actually almost impossible these days. Stability is too spammable and lasts for too long.  
---
While having stacks of stability as a mechanic is alright, I actually would rather change it as the 100% immunity for that duration. No more stacks, but much shorter duration, for example, just 2 seconds. That way you need to time your stability, like back in days.   
---
Would that be bad for melee? Yes probably, but that is why there are numerous ways to gain personal stability. I just do not want stability to be AoE applied and spammable as it is currently.   
---
Also, to hell with weakness condition, it is too strong condition and always was, but making it stack in duration is just dumb - it should have never been like that. GW2 has a big problem - since the early days - in allowing all players to count - every condition and every boon needs to be put into a damage table so we do not make someone feel bad because their boon or condition didn't count - that is why conditions were overhauled in the first place. While it is good to make people feel good about themselves, it is counterproductive for the healthy status of the game because it just allows for powercreep.   
---
Also, cleaving in this game is insane. Can we reduce everything to be applied to the max. 5 players? Why is there a need to affect 10 players with 1 skill? I can understand if it happened for raids to allow for more variety in group compositions, but it has no place in WvW. I would also change the way boons are applied - they are applied only to those who are in the same party - not in a raid group - but in a party. I would srsly like to see more motivation for people to really care about what they are doing then just mindlessly spam just because everyone is rewarded anyway. 
---
I do not say that my proposed changes are of good quality, but I truly believe that some fundamental mechanics in this game are just broken in their current versions, so for those who know how to,  do better changes.
---
&gt; Cmcs balance is more interesting than any of these pve and gemstore patches to me. 
---
True. Just to see someone actually listening is gold. We need a PvE version of cmc. Where are fractals and raids?
---
Which is a very different question altogether.
---
Pocket Raptors exist to facilitate maximum bloodlust/corruption stacks.
---
I agree we dont need to expect much from anet. Especially for wvw and pvp content.
---
That said I'm certain they can manage numerical changes to improve balance. And if those are well thought out then it can be very beneficial to the competitive modes.
---
It's one dev that can make both modes less repetitive and more fun again by giving us variety and options that should be standard for mmorpgs. Low effort high reward. And so far the direction of these changes is well liked.
---
That bug has been reported constantly since Beta.
---
Can you reset the dye to it's original color?
---
My area looks the same. It’s kind of upsetting because their Baja chicken sub was banging.
---
tbh, I'm fine with small local promotions ...
---
Join a squad/join a guild. WvW is by very definition not meant to be played alone.
---
So many people from medford.
---
remember gw1?
---
de hab Banana scythes 
---
pickaxes which were Hammers with Piercing dmg 
---
etc...
---
ye i would Love some twohanded axes as hammerskins
---
It's well known?
---
It's the first time i hear this
---
Yep sad to see that but it is easier to hate than to think :/
---
The average chance to drop a pre from greens is roughly 1 in 400,000 bags if I remember correctly.
---
Then dropping the most valuable one feels pretty nice, gz.
---
Except what the gem store sells isn't 'content', at least not by my definition.
---
Content in GW2 is living story, festivals, events, new fractals, raids, competitive maps or modes, all of which are given for free so long as you are logged in upon release.
---
The argument could be made that ANET isn't releasing enough content, as they seem to be prioritizing gem store releases instead.  But cosmetic gem store items remain just that - cosmetic, or in some cases, QoL improvements.  
---
Over 3.5k hours spent in a game that I spent about $100.00 on nearly two years ago?  Sorry, no complaints from me.
---
I really doubt they will change it.
---
Chances are this was like the invisible slippers. Someone in ANet wanted the skin added just for themselves and keeping it away from other players, but there's probably a policy against that, so they add the thing, make it ultra-rare, and have a GM account give them the item.
---
This way they get to keep the item for themselves, while having the illusion that other players can get it.
---
As crazy as it may sound, there's absolutely nothing else that makes any more sense than that when it comes to a story-related collection. There's no alternate ways to obtain it, no way to craft it, and there's no way to get more than one chest per day once you complete the map with all characters, so it will only turn more and more rare as less people have time to do the map events as most people give up on it since it hardly ever drops for anyone.
---
The solution is simple yuro. Start your own Quiznos franchise.
---
Hey, no.. . It's over already.
---
It finished yesterday.
---
yes it bothers me too
---
It got the same destiny that revenant's axe and mace from HoT's beta
---
We like the moon is 👌🏻
---
Yes, really I’m the same. On certain world bosses or fractals Sword/dagger is just super squishy still, even though my survival rate is getting better and better as I master the rotations... especially condition heavy fights.
---
If you just want currency/track progression - you can flip camps and easy objectives on your own, or with a small party. You have 4 maps to rotate around, taking the small objectives. Usually the large zergs don't care about those objectives so you'll be facing other small roaming squads.
---
To be fair, him « leaving » the game for the amazing, brilliant, definite death of Gw2, WoW classic was advertised over and over and over again few month back, so you have to expect these snarky comments now
---
I would love to have greataxe, crossbows and pikes/poles/halberds as new weapon types.
---
Same. There's actually one a long walk/short bike ride from my place.
---
Even though none of the promo items really especially appeal to me, I still might stop just because I like toasted subs.
---
The playerbase is neither big nor dedicated enough that the meta can be considered solved imo. And a big part of the PVP community is so bad that individual skill is way more relevant than playing meta. If you have success with it just keep playing it until you don't.
---
If they do that I'm even more in than I already am.
---
1: Mystic or Black Lion depending on whether you want the upgrade out of it.  For the Genesis, unless you want the skin for your own use, you should sell it for the gold.  You can sell any exotic for the gold, really, but check the price of the upgrade in it and determine if it's more valuable to salvage w/Black Lion for the upgrade and possible Ectos.
---
2: In theory, it's worth it to boost your Magic Find, but the effect won't be too high unless you save up a lot of those caches, which might be bothersome for your inventory/bank.  Remember, reward boxes from PvP/WvW reward tracks operate the same way, even if they don't explicitly say so.
---
3: Not sure, but I just delete my extra Bloodstone despite having both Herta and Mawdrey, so I'm not really a shining example for efficiency there.
---
4: Delete.  You can craft some into Auric Ingots if you want, if you intend to finish the Auric Weapons collection or if you're looking to make Legendary Armour someday (as you can get Provisioner Tokens for Auric Ingots now), but deletion is safe.  There's no way to turn Auric Dust into money.
---
5: Do you need XP?  If so, you can consume.  Do you want any of the items you can trade them for?  If so, trade them for items.  All the items they give are cosmetic/toys except for the green unidentified gear, which is 20 coins.
---
6: If you want to start/resume key-farming, those experience scrolls are helpful for that, letting you quickly get a character running to take through the level 10 story (and maybe the level 40 story) to get the free Black Lion Key waiting at the end.  You can get one level 10 key per week.  You can use this to check out early stories you haven't seen/picked before, or just run the quick Human Commoner storyline many players do to get done in 10-20 minutes.  If you have lots of scrolls/tomes, you can actually level a character fully to 80 and do the level 10/40 story, and Episode 6 of LW2, and map complete places like Bloodstone Fen and Dragonfall and Grothmar Valley and other easy/quick maps to get more keys!  Of course, that's not the best use of your time until you've already done all of that on the characters you already have...
---
Anets forum policy is as retarded as your ideas on wvw balance. :)
---
People warned Anet about these problems pre GW2 release. Stealth is always a highly problematic mechanic: either it is nearly useless  - or overpowered. Also not really fun to fight against.
---
Wait, live action meaning real actors?! Or "live *gameplay*?
---
If the former, can you link to that? I've never seen such a thing.
---
Stealth is one of the mechanics (among many others) which force GW2 into capture points pvp only. Deathmatch or teamdeathmatch won't work well with stealth.
---
Sounds good but not sure I can get Trailblazer's gear, craft is not rdy at all what is weaker alternative for this stats (Trailblazer's Apothecary) ? :)
---
[here you go](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HGRMWxg9ZcM)
---
No I'm completely pissed off that they don't even care about designing good in game rewards. 
---
I'm just saying that Blizzard isn't riding this store wave in any way heavy. You can be completely good not buying anything there and ending up in a wonderful position where it doesn't matter. A name change isn't something you need or that adds any value - it's a service. Automated or not. The few ingame things that are sold there are just if someone wants to support them - you have TONS of in game alternatives. In GW2 you can't get ONE mount skin with playing the game. 
---
Exchanging gold to gems doesn't really count btw. The gems aren't magically there that you buy with your gold. If no one would pay for ingame gold, you wouldn't have the option to exchange. That makes it even worse that they still feel the need of concentrating on Gemstorestuff. 
---
I'm GW2 the balance between the game and the store got more and more unbalanced and today it feels like literally everything new and cool is designed for the store. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the fools who spent thousands of Euros for the Store. Because I thought that's clever - supporting the creator and giving him the possibility to concentrate less on shady money greeding things and more on good content. Because I loved the first game so much, because I love the GW universe so much. But the money spent on the store wasn't even meant to make room for content - it was meant to act like in every single shitty mobile game out there.
---
I mean... you're not at all wrong, but it never ceases to amaze me how much gamers are like lemmings. The entire twitch phenomenon in general just makes me facepalm a bit, let alone seeing how much sway some of those people hold over large chunks of the player base.
---
You shouldn't have stopped reading at 'reference'. Dude's a point. Of your niche gets like 1 update a year tops, you're not the target audience. You're an afterthought.
---
It's more or less supposed to be "how much gold you need to get an acc like yours right now". Liquid gold is the stat that is "how much gold you could have once you sell everything"
---
Knowing GW2, their spaghetti code would self destruct if anyone ever wanted to find your email address.
---
Your art looks pretty good. The moa looks excellent. =)
---
wvw is definitely not the way to go. If i wanted the easiest and at the same time least grindy way i would go the pvp route, even in bronze league playing 2-3 games every day (statidistically you will win half of the games) will be enough to complete all the tiers and get enough tickets for 2 pieces, which is the maximum you can get each league.
---
Of course you are right in the affirmation that raid armor is the game mode that allows you to get more pieces faster.
---
I checked their store locator yesterday while posting in another thread, and I think there were exactly zero stores in mainland Europe, just a few in the UK.
---
wvw backpack requires 2 months of capping your tickets weekly. You cant grind it in 2 weekends.
---
As I was saying having people that grind rewards but dont interact with anyone isnt beneficial for a server. Generally the opposite. They are very taxing on the community aspect of a server.
---
Do you want to play WVW for what it is? Do you enjoy openworld pvp or battling for objectives?
---
&gt; Having paid for Raids to unlock masteries, I can safely say you also don't have to "do anything "hard"" to complete your Raid-based Legendary Armors if you have the resources.
---
Yeah... no. Buying 150 LI? Sure, if you take the cheap bosses it's only about 7500 gold. 
---
But you also need to do two collections. The first one is easily buyable for like ~1000 gold.
---
For the 2nd one you have to play by yourself. You can't buy things like "not missing green at Cairn" or surviving Deimos. 
---
But hey, 8500 gold + 2000 gold for the armor itself -&gt; 10500 gold, easy.
---
&gt; and while you're right in saying you don't have to be good or win so long as you play long enough to get the legendaries
---
Which isn't the case for raid legendaries *
---
&gt; it would take quite the masochist to tolerate losing and/or sucking for such an extended period of time.
---
It's literally (only) 3 time longer, if you lose *all* matches (vs. winning *all* matches). 
---
So is reality it's even less than 3 times longer, because if you are bad enough you will be teamed with similar bad people and win sometimes (plus getting carried by good players every now and then). 
---
If you think about legendary weapons and than people need a time between *a few weeks* and *years* to craft them. Compared to this a maximum of 3 times the minimum is pretty short imo. 
---
&gt; If you don't like these modes or the manner the legendaries have been deployed, fine.
---
I never said that I don't like PvP/WvW nor that I don't like the manner the legendaries have been deployed. I just said how it is in relation to "not easy to get". Don't put words in my mouth pls. 
---
&gt; Don't shit on what you haven't tried.
---
Yeah... no.... but I did... I tried and I even crafted some armor pieces in these modes...
---
&gt;  I don't raid and will probably never like raiding, but I'd never disabuse them of their content and effort needed. 
---
But saying "don't shit on what you haven't tried" just a sentence earlier....
---
You should have tried raiding to know all perspectives of this topic. If you did, you would see that getting legendary armors became much easier with PvP and WvW armors, than it was with Raiding.
---
Say what you want, but getting progress with every try (PvP) and conquering a camp every 10 minutes (WvW) *IS* much easier than killing 150 raid bosses + doing 2 collections including some challenges.
---
ded gaem
---
Ah, sorry. It's "2 hOuRs oF ConTenT eVerY 3 MontHs" now.
---
Still this comes from a percentage of the sales or certain bundles, which means this kind of campaings are good for the earnings of the company. 
---
Not really compaining thou, knowing that an small part of my spends are going to a charity makes the spending feel less hollow.
---
Does this also disable the window for normal world events? That's what I thought it does.
---
Anybody know the odds of getting the unique dyes from the norn dye kit? Do exclusive dyes typically all have the same drop rate or are certain exclusives rarer than others?
---
Thanks!
---
Toxic casual.
---
Knowing their history of bad decisions, yes.
---
By knowing what cannot be known.
---
So an axe with blunt damages? A mace. You're looking for a mace.
---
I thought I was doing such a good job that the game awarded me a gold star. I'll happily pay Anet money to keep it.
---
&gt; It's ANet stating that
---
He claims Anet *said* it. I know what Anet *does*, Captain Obvious.
---
I play a mix. I roam when I’m just trying to keep participation up, otherwise I Zerg it. 
---
DH wasn’t horrible a few years back. Can’t remember the exact timeframe though, it’s been too long to properly place it.
---
Lol it's a Ramones lyric.
---
I just don't understand how can you not donate and rather have your gold sitting there.
---
These ppl are not new, they are Raiders and fractals runners and have several legendarys and they buy gem stuff and bl keys, and most likely have some gold/gems sitting there for quite a while (i know i do)
---
new Episode Nov 19th. So about 2 months. Is that too long? Are there other MMORPGs pushing out content faster than 2 months? (honest questions as I don't know the answer.)
---
I am not sure what is ridiculous about the time between Ep 1 coming soon and the prologue. 
---
We also don't know what else is or isn't coming on Nov 19th. You might want to wait for more information.
---
We can say that it won't be a new Xpac or Race though. It's also super unlikely we are getting new elite specs any time soon. Everything else is possible, maybe not probable but possible.
---
The general attitude you seem to carry forth from here to other threads is one of anger. You are clearly upset. You have that right, I am just not sure how that is helpful to you or anyone else. Sorry you feel this way, I hope tomorrow is a better day
---
I like both GW2 and WoW for different reasons.
---
Never said GW2 was dying. Just the raid scene.
---
If simply asking for a source of a statement is ironic to you, ok. A statement is not equal to an action, just as written in his comment.
---
I prefer playing with newfriends in GW2, makes it more interesting hehe
---
&gt; i don't understand what you say. The important thing here is that raid armor has it's skin tied to the legendary status when in both pvp and wvw you can just unlock the skin without the need to make it legendary. In that department the Raid armor has more prestige for me.
---
That's what I meant with "Raid is only needed for the skins" (more or less). 
---
My keypoint was that legendary armors themselves (not the skin) lost much prestige when WvW/PvP legendary armors came out. While in PvE you had to do collections, some challenges and killing many raid bosses (needed some skill), in PvP and WvW you need literally nothing. You just have to keep your participation active in WvW and join ranked matches in PvP. It doesn't matter if you lose or don't even play the game seriously, you will get your progress/reward anyway. 
---
In PvP it's faster, if you win, but that's all. In WvW it doesn't matter if you run with the zerg, roam, play an insturment or are AFK, as long as you participation is active, you will always get the same reward after 5 minutes.
---
Armor sets maybe? We have some of them that also take some time to achieve. They're good. But there are basically three ingame armor sets, that are pretty basic, in relation to a huge amount of shiny and way better designed products available through lootboxes or the Gemstore. 
---
And yeah even if it won't happen you can't justify the heavy focus on the Gemstore with the option of exchanging gold to gems. That's just nuts.
---
I mean that mini sounds vaguely neat. Probably no quiznos in this small ass city though. Why are people upset over this?
---
well, by not having any EU related information any more on their servers it means they also can't get sued by the EU for it anymore, meaning they dont have to worry about the GDPR, which pretty much is the same end result as being compliant
---
You can check the changelog.

&gt; ### 2019-11-02
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; **Chores**
---
&gt; - *Account/Value:* Add value to various items (Thanks to @sutgon)
---
&gt; - *Account/Value:* Update gemstore values (Thanks to @sutgon)
---
It won't tell you the list of items that got their value changed, tho.
---
My account got a spike of about 15K gold.
---
&gt;  We've got plenty of wonderful weapon skins. How about putting some of that effort in to armors and outfits?
---
Weapons look identical on all races. Armor does not. Anet is not going to suddenly spend effort to make it look good on even the human races.
---
&gt; The game will die. It's not a question anymore.
---
That's the attitude to have! well done.
---
Also if you are posting here you are still part of the meme.
---
But at least 50 are working on the gem store! Look at how all these new store releases prove it! Oh wait right.
---
Well you can watch the rest of the stream for that lol
---
You mean [this](https://youtu.be/v7GD9asBtA8)?
---
It's [here](https://account.arena.net/register?alt=pgw2&amp;cid=93:5::::Global:40:::).
---
easiest in terms of speed, not in terms of skill. 
---
If you are not skilled in anything the easiest (fastest) is the pvp way, then the wvw way and lastly the pve way. Basically because the first 2 gamemodes can be soloed at your own pace. Believe me when i say that you can spend thousands of hours in wvw and still be a noob. 
---
But with that said, i can agree with you that a new player who starts from 0 in wvw will probably get bored of the game mode before reaching the ranks that can craft leg. armor if he doesn't get skilled enough to activelly participate with his team instead of doing more pasive playstile like solo flipping camps, killing cows and the like to maintain participation.
---
If you are skilled in all 3 game modes then of course, pve raid armor is the way to get more pieces faster.
---
yea affected by adblock
---
&gt; Do you raid? Howmuch li do you have?
---
Somewhat about 800+, but why does it matter?
---
&gt; Howmuch li do you think bad playere can get if they spend 15 hours a week trying for 21 weeks?
---
15 hours are like 4 tries/days a ~3,5h. If a bad player is alone and only uses lfg, ~5 hours are needed for searching groups who want to take you with them. 
---
With 4 days with 2,5h of actual raiding, they may be able to kill 3-4 bosses including Escort, Cairn and Mursaat. 
---
1 LI from pre Gorse and 1 from TC event *would* be available easily, *IF* the group are able to kill VG/KC. For bad players VG is possible I think, KC rather not. 
---
So I would say it's 5 LI per week, plus improvements over the time. Let's say it's an average of 6 LI per week. That's 126 LI in 21 weeks.
---
(Sometime I myself started raiding, so I know how hard it is to find groups when you don't know many bosses or ar bad and don't have much LI. 
---
Also I often play together with friend that are really bad at raiding (it's still funny), so I know how raid bosses can be with a bad group. Even the easy ones.)
---
Ah, forgot to mention 2 important things:
---
- I did it before the number of tickets was slightly nerfed several weeks after release???
---
- I already started with like 1000 tickets from those old WvW experiments they did in the past. I saved those tickets instead of spending them.
---
But yes, i did it in 2 weekends.
---
Then maybe they should do their own promotions through sites that don't "require" anything? Other game companies have figured out how to do that, ANet apparently hasn't realized that it's not 2002 anymore.
---
&gt; What it really comes down to is the question of how long we want to chase our own tails right now. If we nerf Scourge, then maybe we need to nerf boons and cleanses, then maybe we need to nerf conditions and corrupts, and on and on we go.
---
they are starting to realize the power creep they created and how every patch they did basically fucked up WvW even more. They are better off rolling back all changes to pre-HoT for WvW and starting from there.
---
Oh, this is very clever!  (And, yes, I say that because I came up with the same thing to make Skynet and a self-fixing AI with Docker containers as the code can recompile itself with a change, then load the new version when the container restarts.)
---
Marauders is a decent health buff, but you can do without it honestly and run around with full zerkers.
---
Playing a low health class teaches you good.habits of avoiding damage altogether, instead of going for more sustainy armour and trying to facetank everything. 
---
Experiment with your skills. Meta builds are damage oriented but it's have a plan to keep yourself alive too.
---
For example, know your dodges. dagger fire3 and air5 act as additional dodges, as do sword water2 and earth2. 
---
Look at blocks, blinds (warhorn earth5,glyph of storms in earth) and summons (earth elemental does less damage but is more tanky)
---
&gt; :) I like that game a whole lot.
---
but not as much as gw2
---
I've got a Quizno's near me if anyone wants a code. The cheapest subs are about $6. Lemme know if you want one and we can help each other out. :)
---
You knew very well what he meant. You're just being obtuse. So yes, complaining about someone explaining something to you that you very well understood in the first place and just chose to ignore so you could nitpick semantics is actually quite ironic. Enjoy, though. Everyone needs a hobby.
---
Just stop yourself here bro the cringe is already too strong.
---
yeah, and here i am, a 900 rank player in wvw without having really played the game mode since i basically log in for the fast and easy dailies (camps, veteran, scouts, gurds, cows). The most i spent continously on wvw was when the leg. backpiece was released. I spent 2 weekends flipping camps, go figure.
---
I want GW2 wvw classic, pre HoT, with no elite specs, and conditions being the old school ones (only 1 stack of poison/burning)
---
I would say any class can deal with them easily. People would probably find it easier with the classes they play most.
---
Yeah and theres many people who buy raids.
---
They spent 1/10 of the time farming gold than you did farming 900 levels, they bought the raids for legendary armor and they still have gold left for whatever.
---
That little enraged spark is MVP + Arstari IV buckshot @ 7:08ish is when you lost your Mistlock Singularity.  Such a painful looking smack.  I suppose that's the peril of running a condition build with adrenaline rush.  Then again, I wouldn't want to try and do a solo without quickness, and when you're not breaking boss break-bar there's no reason not to play Quickbrand.  Great solo! Some of those marble+bomb combinations gave me anxiety.
---
That's why I mentioned we have some armor sets that are well implemented. 
---
Though, they're pretty basic in relation to the stuff you get from the lootboxes or the store, which is pretty sad and why people often decide to not get them.
---
I have more fun playing WoW than GW2 right now. I don't think I'll ever get my GW2 flair back unfortunately.  
---
I prefer streaming GW2 though, conversing with the chat is the real endless content.
---
Probably older than you are. (at least I hope so)
---
And sure I am serious, what is wrong with what I said, you come across as angry.
---
We were getting fractals every 6 months (poor I know). Raids every 7-8 months? (I need to look this up) Both of which seem far too long and I think it's clear to most people that those teams or the resources spent there aren't nearly as much as they spend on story.
---
It's a shame because I prefer group instanced content and a lot of players dedicated to that type of content has moved on to other games which provide it a little more on the regular.
---
I do enjoy gambling. Regardless of that comment, I would say it's silly to think you won't get wvw / pvp / fractals or raids in 2020 (this year is more or less over, minus one release). You might get one of these things in 2019 but it's unlikely to get all of them in the last release of the year (minus wintersday).
---
As for other games, you generally see an expansion every 2 years, not every year. 
---
Back to GW2. Season 3 had story every 2 months more or less, before that we had content every 2 weeks (were you here for that?) So while it's true that season 4 and the time in-between hasn't been great (3 months-ish) there was a time where it was much better than that. As of right now we are on a better track and we'll have to see where it goes. Or maybe not.
---
I know that nothing I say here will change your mind. You seem set in your path now and that is a shame. But I still wish you all the best in whatever game or experience you have next.
---
What was his internet aliases? I don't remember any prominent pvper called cal cohen back then
---
You can do river and statues and you're up to 8. You can buy instances for gorse and TC open without much difficulties. 
---
If it takes 2.5 hours a day on average, minus finding a group, to clear things like esort and TC then YIKES. Sorry but escort or tc only groups arent exactly super demanding.
---
No really, 15 hours a week and for 6 li? That's a skill in and of itself.
---
wow your insults are constantly centered about getting laid and sex, you seem very frustrated sexually. incel much?
---
I understand. Think of this though, if the armor on the gemstore or loot boxes were boring would people spend money on it? I know that isn't entirely what this discussion is about but for them (the company) it is about making money, sad as that might be to someone who just wants a good game.
---
heh, in my case my main goal is to stack those green potions. They can be very useful to insta-unlock certain things when they are released.
---
And it doesn't need to be a new thing. For example, do i need a gift of battle? no prob, that's just 80 potions.
---
Right on, thanks!
---
&gt; 1- how do you quote hereee?
---
Just write a "&gt;" at the beginning of the row. :)
---
&gt; Yes if you fail raids you get nothing, but why would you? The raid 1-4 wings are pretty easy!!! You eventually get the kill.
---
I mean you don't start raiding with 500+ LI and knowledge about all bosses, nor with the right gear. And even W1-4 can be tough with 150 or even 50- LI groups.
---
&gt; As for WVW... Have you tried doing that? Maaan i would uninstall the game before afk farming that long... Especially since you can play and have fun instead?
---
I do it everytime I need a Gift of Battle for legendary weapons. I mostly just watch a series or some videos in the meantime.
---
&gt; Raids? Raids are a joke compared to WvW.
---
Not if you talk about effort and rewards. :P
---
Sure - [pic here](https://imgur.com/QdRxXeu).

---
Mine went down the day templates were released because i placed many items from inventories in the 2nd equipment slot. When it went back up i asummed that GW2E just asjusted their code to count items placed in equipment slots besides the first one.
---
The economic system of GW2 is way more complex than just rich players giving money to Anet so everyone can play for free. GW2 have some whales (players that will spend so much money you can even imagine) but they have a lot of Dolphins (players who gonna put some money like 100$ to 1000$ for 2 years). And Im certain that those Dolphins was there main sources of revenues these days and Im pretty sure we are pretty much all dolphins here.
---
Those dolphins will not buy everythings from the Gemstores but what they want. So Anet have no choice to fuel the Gemstore with different items and features because all Dolphins didnt want the same things. But those days, I dont know why, but Dolphins starts complaining about Anet releasing Gemstore items/features they didnt want, but didnt complain when they release Gemstore items/features they want. But that make a flow of different Dolphins complaining when the gemstore upgrade didnt suits there need...
---
About contents release, I didnt know your experience with GW2 or other MMO games but what GW2 is doing is pretty similar than other games. Sure some might thinks that is few content and to slow on release but its actually not that bad. Now, if you arent objective on contents sure you might found it smaller than they are...
---
Me too, what a great comment ty &lt;3 in all honesty it was only when i checked the recording that i noticed i had lost my mistlock at all :s
---
TY &lt;3
---
You take this WAY too seriously. All I did was ask for a source to an important statement. That's it.
---
I don't really know why existing players would be looking to buy subs.  The only thing that remotely benefits existing players is the mini, and what sort of in-game prestige is a palette-swapped version of an existing mini that no one uses going to give?
---
While I'm sure their view was that this was more to attract new players, I guess on the flip side they're realizing now how many people are willing to spend $8 to get a meal that comes with a minimum-effort miniature not available elsewhere.  There's way more people complaining that there is no Quiznos near them than there are players complaining about a mini they have to pay real money for, with no gold to gems alternative.  And, as I think can't be stated enough, the mini is just a palette swapped version of an existing Mini Icebrood Ogre that anyone with Bitterfrost Frontier can pick up.  If you've never used that mini, and I'm pretty sure no one reading this message has, what's the big deal about this one?
---
if chatmanding is your endgame, you could still do it while playing wow, a game that is more fun to you
---
You seem upset their industry leading efforts dont provide results up to the industry standard.
---
Disagreeing with me doesnt make you a whiteknight. Sucking anets dick does. But please do keep it up! We need more polarization.
---
nice
---
just wondering how much money you invested into classic wow since release
---
Drop rates from dye kits like that aren't great.  If there's a specific dye from it you're after, you're usually better off buying it individually from the Trading Post from others who do spend gems to obtain it.
---
Sometimes certain dyes have prices that spike really high.  In that case, the dye should eventually become available in a birthday gift down the road, which will bring the price back into line.  Of course, you have to be patient enough to wait that long... but there's usually cheaper dyes of similar colour that can tide you over in the meantime.
---
Hundreds of hours attempting to clear w1? Yikes. 
---
Well rip to you. Plenty of the raid statics I played with were wvwers cashing in on their free loot. After all 2 hours of clears a week would give them more loot than 3 hours of daily wvw.
---
Yeah, I had to do a quick double-take.  Once I knew adrenaline rush was active it was a matter of realizing that *something* was going to smack you at 10% HP for all your HP xD.  It's a little frustrating that it wasn't the boss that OHKO you, but I think that's a pretty fair overview of adrenaline rush lol.
---
Huh? Yeah that's what a discussion is about. Exchanging opinions. I highly respect yours because besides were having a pretty similar view on what we want from the game, you're very optimistic and still loyal to ANet. That's great because that's exactly what this game needs. And I wish it does. 
---
For me it's over for now, yes. I was a hardcore GW player and fairly hardcore on GW2 too. I've spent way too much money on the Gemstore and I never felt the same love for this game I felt for GW. Missing out Cantha and not bringing back great classes like the Ritualist and the Derv were things that really hurt, but because it was something very personal it was OK. 
---
But now, after those templates, the obvious statements that they don't care for the hardcore community, the let down of two very important game modes for years and an always boringly repeating story about dragons I feel so let down by this company I can't touch this game anymore.
---
I'm wishing you the best too, I really hope you'll keep having fun!
---
yeah i just checked their website for prices, subscription games just arent for me. But I am surprised that they didnt make a separate subscription for like half the price for wow classic, excluding regular wow
---
Glad you finally manage to find the way to get out this lab' :D
---
Yeah here we encounter the problem of this clip lol.
---
I was actually talking about the industry in general not GW2. In fact prior to this rather long (hours) conversation/debate about this I explicitly stated that I don't really include GW2 in the discussion because even with the build templates/mount skin fiasco GW2 remains very consumer friendly in my opinion.  
---
My major beef with the monetization is that the entire system is designed around it, cash first players second. There is no way that the system needed to be this elaborate with free inventory slots etc, it's that way so it's a justified sale.  
---
The system itself is excellent this is something I've always defended actually but it feels really rough when my consumer friendly game is selling me core gameplay features. I don't even think the pricing is unfair - I'm just sad about the state of the industry and how the build templates look a hell of a lot like the start of the disease infecting the whole of gaming.  
---
I really love GW2 and hope that they don't go to the dark side lmao.
---
I play FF14 at the same time than GW2. Both games have about the same amount of contents release. FF14 IMO is just better at reusing old contents by doing increasing difficulty on some fight.
---
I’ve raided a lot as healer scrapper
---
HoT gave me anxiety and stress issues. Great expansion but hellish to navigate through.
---
You can't get rid of the orange star.

The orange star get rid of you !... Of us ! O.o

I was going to keep hylie in there but Anet kicked me to metrica prov. during a foe door D:
---
That was a joke about ANet completely forgetting about this elite spec. Just FYI
---
dead server
---
Necro is only an excuse for gorseval. I do understand it makes pugging harder because it's difficult to get necro comps.
---
I've done VG on second try with wvw friends most of whom never did raids with a necro comp. Half of them used trailblazer instead of viper because thats what they had. Truthfully if you just tell people when to epi and what to epi then vg has no mechanics you cant ignore, and epi is enough dps to kill vg on it's own. Same for sab, except you need to know the mechanics. 
---
Heal scourge is legit on both too. Also after hundreds of hours in w1, have you considered trying easier starting wings like w4?
---
This is true, but it still made me chuckle. :)
---
And to add to what ppl said : You fo have progression, you have to kill a determined boss to go to the next one, and so on to finish a wing. It may not be what "real raiders" (whatever that means) want it, but all things in your definition are there.
---
Your disdain makes the content go away, therefore "bare bones content" becomes factually right!
---
Arc template users weren't in some kind of limbo state where they were using build templates but not playing the game.
---
They played the game, and many of them bought and spent gems just like normal players (possibly spending more gems on bag slots than typical players).
---
The agreement to allow Arc templates helped retain that playerbase and the income they generated until Anet could provide their own solution.
---
Actually I prefer real PvP than some Mass-PvP made for PvE players :) But thanks.
---
Yes, people still run the HoT metas everyday. The one your talking about, Chak Gerent, is still very popular and people still do it regularly due to a very rare infusion you can get from it. 
---
You can check the meta timers here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers
---
The one you are looking for is the Tangled Depths one.
---
I still wish for a little sidebar, where we could place consumables/utilities like stones, rods, potions etc. That said - nicely done!
---
People absolutely do it, check on LFG at :15-25 after the hour on the hour the meta takes place.  The one right after reset fills up quickly, but it still gets done other times too.  You're guaranteed at least one Chak Egg per meta completion.
---
Not in the US, can I get a code from the Quiznos not in US?
---
The problem with the word raid it is "tainted" from other games. We now have Strike Missions and I could name a few raid bosses, remove one mechanic and they could EASILY be a strike mission encounter and no one would notice it.
---
That's a lot of money. Cheers all.
---
Yes, of course. Maps start filling up anywhere from 30 to 10 mins before the meta, so check the LFG. And of course, the timer so see when it's up https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers
---
Oh no ! During a loot door ? Ask for revenge ! You should hire Steve ! I guess you're good friends now.
---
Ps: I'll try to do better next year than you did here. ^^ See you in Wintersday JP, probably.
---
At that point I bet it would be cheaper to buy it from someone than buying ticket to fly over there.

You must be fun at parties. 
---
And yet no viability.
---
fair enough, these days im only on reddit for the memes too, so who am I to judge.
---
Getting back to your original point made in OPs clip:
---
In general I agree that the video game industry changed over the last 2 decades because most developers stopped shipping finished products because they now got the ability to fix or evolve it later on with updates (paid or unpaid). But then again, games these days have to potential to grant you way more replayability as well. 
---
Personally I clocked over 14k hours in gw2 (granted, plenty of that is probably afk or on character screen but then again, I was afk or on character screen because I was busy doing something online related to gw2), thats probably more than the combined hours of me playing SNES and PS1 games in my youth.
---
And regarding your complaint that some MTX offers are more expensive than the actual game, thats certainly true but thats not because the MTX or so expensive but because they sell the game far below value, its just the hook to sell you MTX.
---
And thats not a business practice exclusive to video gaming. Printers are also usually dirt-cheap and sold below production value but in the end, the printer company will make enough profit with overpriced ink-cartridges, the same goes for these new modern coffee machines that use single-serving coffee pads or concentrate cartridges to make you an overpriced cup of coffee.
---
And regarding GW2, I think MTX is just an option, not a necessity.
---
Personally, I only ever paid real money for the base game and the 2 expacs, so 130 bucks because I am (arguably) good enough at playing the game to buy any gem store fluff/upgrades with gold i earned in game.
---
For me MTX is just an option that Anet implemented for other players that want to reach a certain goal faster than me, arent good enough to reach that goal as fast as me or dont have the same time to spare that I invest to reach that goal.
---
So from my point of view, GW2 isnt even an MTX game, which is probably the reason why I like it so much.
---
They're ingame. Mistrender and Mistbreaker.
---
I'm doing an "Explore the Lore" series with my guild where we're playing from personal story all the way up to the latest LW and immersing ourselves completely in the Lore. I would say we've run into bugs during story instances more often than we haven't at this point, throughout all stages of the story. It's a hot mess, but hey at least we've got build templates now!

Raids are just more content...
---
They aren't hard in normal mode. It's just the name "Raid" that scares most people off, because they know they suck at the game and now they have to join a group with 9 other players that will judge their skill and have some expectations of them.
---
But instead of getting good so they can enjoy that content, they refuse to learn and come to reddit to complain about how Raids shouldn't be in the game.
---
if your fashion is buying outfits you are doing something wrong
---
It's called casual because 90% if not more of the content is casual story or open world content that can be beat by any build or gear.
---
It's not really a childish insult if it has some truth to it. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The game is dead at this point to a lot of people
---
&gt; Most casuals don't want to care about their gear or traits or anything and will just slot in random stuff and move on
---
That's the thing, they don't and beat 95% of the game either way.
---
quick quick cuestion. How do I permanently remove a poi from a certain list? for example, when gathering theeggs for th Griphon, I went on erasing using "-" to remove when on top of a point. but after relaunch all poi reseted. (only check/uncheck work properlly)
---
This whole post was a giant final fantasy advertisement
---
Yep, I am glad you enjoyed it :D
---
We are NA :D
---
The undiluted contempt and arrogance. Impressive.
---
At the end of the day you realize that all people who call themselves casual and who play whenever they want are the ones who either play with their credit carda or the ones who don't even play, just afk in game while watching a movie or something.
---
In other words, mobile gamers.
---
Games that are based on microtransactions want to give players two options: 1) Grind -&gt; your time or 2) Dollars -&gt; your money
---
Skill is none of those options, that's why so many games are not based on skill any more. And that's how it also is in gw2
---
This.
---
Check Lfg for that map, evenings and weekends tend to be more popular.
---
The first run after reset is almost garunteed to have people, so check around daily reset.
---
Outfits are the antithesis to Fashion Wars. Ingame rewards is where it's at.
---
Depends on behavior set for the certain marker, but all disabled markers are stored in activationdata.xml in taco folder, just delete that file:-)
---
I didn't mention outfits in my post though.  I did mention 800 gem skins but I was referring to armor skins. You can buy outfits and a lot of people do.  There's also tons and tons of weapon skins in the gemstore.
---
That's the thing though, all other MMOs are like that with their open world.  You can solo pretty much anything so I didn't mention that because it's not a GW2 thing.  GW2 doesn't do anything special here in that regard.
---
So elite specs when?
---
Number of skills isn't really the same as difficulty, maybe expect for PvE when it means more complicated rotations. On holo you just spam random skills in photon forge then drop out before overheating, spam random rifle skills while heat is going down then repeat. Everything else is just situational like an invulnerability or stealth.

I bet you're a hoot at parties.

they got 2 months time for that , 90% of the data is automated anyway i can send you what blizzard send me no one died and no one suffered for that 100% guaranteed.
---
They spared no expense
---
That's not the minimum. It's capped at 20 million or 4% of annual revenue, whichever is higher.
---
In practice I'm not aware of any such fines being handed out. It would probably only happen for gross negligence of the regulations impacting thousands of clients. An error such as misunderstanding an email would not result in a ridiculous fine.
---
It will get reported to their data protection officer who will probably report it onwards as a self declaration, and detail steps to prevent a repeat.
---
What marketing dollars do they have if their best choice is "Quiznos coupon"?
---
I use a Razer Trinity but have always had multiple side buttons on my mice.
---
You should get used to it in time.
---
If the side buttons are contoured, feel for the differences and you'll get there.
---
Takes a while to get used to it, that's normal. I swapped from a logitech g600 (which also has 12 side buttons) to a corsair scimitar and I still took like 2 weeks to get used to the new one.
---
Is there really? I hear things changed a bit since I played, but storage was a massive issue in FFXIV because one character can play all classes. You just didn't have enough storage to hold all this gear. It's even worse if you are a crafter.
---
You bank is tied to these things called retainers. Also other things, like how many items you can list on the market, and you can send them out on missions to get items (which you can also sell) and so forth.
---
You can have a maximum of 8 of these retainers. Not too bad, right? Well... You can only get 2 in game. The rest cost 2 dollars...A MONTH! You need to spend an extra 12 dollars a month, on top of your sub, to have the maximum amount of retainers.
---
Say what you want about Anet and their microtransactions, but at the end of the day you can at least convert gold to buy them, and at least none of them are a monthly cost...
---
In America we have people who "exercise their rights" by walking into police stations with assault weapons. They are legally allowed to do so, doesn't make them any less of an asshole. Whether or not you are legally allowed to do something has no bearing whatsoever on whether doing it makes you an asshole.
---
The very premise of that website is to make some lowly employee at a corporations life harder. Doing that makes you an asshole.

Go to Lion's Arch with a support build and offer in map chat to create a Fractal party for people who have never tried them. Tell them you'll do 2-3 Fractals, that it's ok if they don't have a proper gear, and that you'll explain the encounter a bit.
---
The party will fill, players will join and some will thank you and even be upfront about not being very skilled.
---
I know, because I used to help people get their first Fractal experience by doing that a couple times a week.
---
Everyone wants to experience content and see what it's about. But for Raids it's harder to do, not because they shouldn't be in the game, but because the stigma around the word "Raid" and the entry level being high from the get-go with no chance of slowly progressing from a very low difficulty encounter makes it scary for most players.
---
If you compare apples to apples it's not even close.  Both GW2 and FFXIV have big patches every 4 months or so.  In GW2 it's Living World, or Saga now, and in FFXIV they are just X.Y patches.  In GW2 you usually get a new map, some gemstore skins, about an hour of story and some in game skins plus maybe some balance.  FFXIV gives a new dungeon, new trial (or extreme version of old trial), new raid (either 24 man or 8 man), new in game fashion items plus catchup mechanics, balance and more.  If you look at the LS4E6 patch notes compared to the FFXIV 5.1 patchnotes it's not even close.
---
If this is the same CMC that I'm thinking of then CMC.  Used to stream back in the day.  Most notably he gave a 2 or 3hr long presentation on why HoT murdered the PvP side of the game.  I don't remember any of the details, but do recall agreeing with most of what I heard.
---
It looks like I will be taking a break from pvp until i get used to the mouse. thx for the tip
---
The prologue was really well done so I'm looking forward to this. 
---
 Hopefully we get an update on Alliances  and how strike missions are going to continue going forward.  I hope they progress in difficulty.
---
Calm down, maybe, people? This is an official announcement that needs to exist in the [launcher window](https://i.imgur.com/xqY0nex.png) to directly provide the information that was only previously teased at another event.
---
Compare the content releases between expacs in WoW or FFXIV to GW2 and then get back to me.  It's not even remotely close.
---
Well no, if there is a behavior to reappear after daily reset it won't. To completely remove it you have to find that particular marker in xml file in the POIs folder and delete it manually from there.
---
Too obvious.
---
i guess i imagined this easier then it actually is :D
---
hmm.. what about a toggable extra line that only shows the chosen symbols? basicly like the edit page but without the line for the buildcode (and without the not chosen symbols).
---
I would send in a fresh ticket to get attention. Chances are, some exhausted agent who works nothing but these sorts of requests 24/7 simply misread, especially since the reply refers to "your request for us to delete your personal info" which isn't what you requested at all.

With any luck, they should be able to cancel the deletion and get you fixed up.

Here’s a rough template of what I run— it’s Berserker/Marauder/Diviner. 
---
People are sleeping on how good Arcane skills are with Elemental Surge and the skill cap it grants with fields, blasts, and attunement combos. 
---
1— In a target rich environment like open world PVE, your heal (Arcane Brilliance) is regularly a 5 target blind(air), 4k to 7k heal, and blast combo finisher on a 20 second cool down. Add might on fire, add 1.3k healing on water.
---
2— Arcane Power combined with your other Arcane skills is 450 ferocity for 30/36 seconds. More over, you pick whether this skill is a better version of Devourer Venom (earth), a minor version of Spider Venom (fire), or even more blinds that spread to all targets hit by you and allies (air).
---
3— You can easily spread 25 Might for 30+ seconds and add significant Fury to 10 targets with all your fire blasts (easy access to 5+ blast finishers), and Heat Sync. Fire overload can also add might. This carries lots of mediocre PvE players— which you tend to find in open world.
---
4— You pop into Earth, us earth #4, and use Aftershock to cycle a permanent uptime on protection for yourself and allies. Protection is also biffed to -40% which is stacking with your food (-10%). Popping earth periodically is easy with Fresh Air.
---
5— I think with Fresh Air and Arcane skills, you can hit close to 300% crit damage for most of your gameplay. I will have to check my build. If a Warrior is giving banners and you have spotter as well, your damage really is increased by a lot.
---
Roll up the core of daredevil and deadeye game play and animations into thief and sure, otherwise no, pre hot had it's problems also. You can go play rockemsockem robots if you want to just stand there and trade cooldowns.
---
I had 2 free to play alts I was no longer using info requested and subsequently deleted (2 separate requests for each of the accounts.)
---
They did not delete my account when I simply requested information, so I can tell you that (at least in my experience.) They did, however, delete as requested when I finally submitted the deletion request later down the line.
---
This is not at all their usual way of doing things and was probably a mistake in the reply from the support person.
---
Guild Wars 3.
---
I'd like to know how though.  Will they completely change the mechanics or add on to the existing ones, or will it be a completely different fight.  That sort of thing.  Anything that will get people into raiding is good so I'm very curious about more details regarding strike missions.
---
Before episode 6 they made it clear that raids from then on will have their own release, seperate from living world. Wing 6 was definetely being postponed to release it with an episode.
---
Storage isn't a problem in FFXIV unless you are a hoarder.  You get your 4 tab storage on your character, your armory for all your gear, a glamour dresser for glamour (fashion) pieces, a saddlebag on your mount (can access pretty much anywhere except instances) and 2 retainers all for the same base sub fee.  You can buy up to 3 additional retainers but not a single person I know does that or even needs to do that.  Yes, I'm sure some people do but they are more outliers.
---
As for the cash shop, it's all fashion and mounts EXCEPT, unlike GW2, there's tons and tons and tons of mounts and fashion to earn in game.  There's no pay for convenience trash like GW2 or anything of the sort.  Besides, most of the good fashion is in game, not cash shop.
---
There's a hell of a lot more zeroes there. Chak Egg Sac is sitting at a cool 0.0002% by my estimation, and since Festive Confetti is around that same rate, I imagine this is somewhere in that neighborhood.
---
&gt; I would 100% recommend FFXIV to someone who wants a long great storyline.
---
And you still have to say "it gets better after ARR, just stick with it". My friends who joined want to level and bash primals, not teleport-talk-teleport-repeat.   
---
I have to remind folks to treat XIV more like a the Final Fantasy that it is and an MMO second, or risk getting frustrated.  
---
Wheeling back to GW2, the "casual" nature of it is mostly in how easy it can be to pick up and put down the game. ...timer-driven content notwithstanding.   
---
Players don't need super top-end gear to accomplish goals, and there's no treadmill to follow. Any of the gold/material/etc grinds can be done on any character (aside from a few quirks) and done at any time.
---
the thing is the hardcore audience is non existing in gw2, except those 15people that are afraid to leave.
---
Thank you. This is great piece of useful informations!
---
Guardian ( core ) is probably the easiest
---
I’m currently working on my 3rd set of PvE legendary armor to finish getting all the skins and I can say I’d be personally fine with legendary armor being available from fractals as long as it requires CMs and doesn’t have the same skin as raid armor. 
---
I’m proud to show off my raid armor. Call me cocky or whatever but I worked hard for years to be able to get 3 full sets and get the CMs for raids etc. I don’t want that to be undermined by someone who can clear fractals which aren’t even that challenging. 
---
Are the raids as hard as FF or WoW? Nah. But they require coordination of at least 8 people (you can carry 2 trash players in most encounters) and it’s just something that I’m proud I’ve been able to complete.
---
&gt;Do you really expect me to pay for visa, take a flight to US, find that Quiznos, buy a sandwich, throw it to trash can and claim my code?
---
Uh, no - I'm pretty sure you're expected to realize that a US-based studio is going to run promotions with US-based companies.  It is what it is.  There will likely be plenty of promotions that you can participate more readily in in the future.
---
Kind of naive to expect every promotion to be available everywhere.
---
anet cares enough to dump money into it
---
A successful promotion would be good for the brand and the game
---
And unsuccessful promotion is a waste of money and resources that could have been used to make the game better
---
Not meaningless exactly
---
But since ANet is running this promo, they're not running another marketing event that would be more advantageous to the game's health.
---
I'd also say it's pretty worrying if ANet's looking at alternative income sources like a sandwich promo rather than actually trying to market their game to new customers.
---
Why wouldn't they call, to make sure the promotion is indeed going, so they don't make the trip for nothing?
---
Most MMOs are the casual MMO. But for some reason GW2 is the only one that refuses to add challenge while others do.
---
No, but shipping the uncompliant cars out of the country and not allowing them back in means that there's only compliant cars left in the country, satisfying the law
---
We know theres a new phase, achievs, and cm coming to the already released strike, so, theres that.
---
"We’re currently adding more polish to the final encounter in the next raid, which continues the story of Qadim and will get its own release after Episode 6. We’re utilizing one of the new team’s efforts to build some additional small-scale open world content so all of our players will have something to celebrate with the release of the raid." taken verbatim from the what's next for GW2 blog post no where does it say this will happen to with new raids.
---
I absolutely love Grothmar Valley. Especially as a long time GW1 fan, it really brought back a lot of nostalgia. 
---
I hope the new zones are a lot like Grothmar
---
Hylie, you're my MKLab God now and I can't wait for October 13, 2020! In the meantime, I'm looking forward to running around Tyria with you. ;)  
---
&lt;3 Raven &lt;3
---
Arent they renaming them to Strike Missions?
---
This sub is just getting more and more pathetic with each passing day...
---
Many American companies don't have dpos. Anet doesn't, 100%
---
Being pessimistic by default usually isn't too healthy for your soul
---
Dude, A-Net may be making blunders but that doesn't make them a failing company. They still make money off of their product. If making money means you're failing, then I can see why the US is the shitstorm it is now.
---
Probably not even that; I lived in the area near the Arenanet HQ and there were a couple quiznos in the area (a couple shut down over the years).
---
I can imagine someone in management went into a local store, chatted it up with the franchise owner or whatever, and got some hook ups lol.
---
There could be a lot of reasons for that.  From individually owned franchises not participating to Anet only issuing so many codes so they have a regional focus.
---
I went to one in Colombia a few months ago (shrug) and there was one here in Venezuela, but it closing has nothing to do with the actual chain going bankrupt. Everything closes here eventually.
---
This looks more like Quiznos marketing than anets.
---
Not many people are going to start playing a 7 year old game just because they got a free mini, but plenty GW2 players would go to Quiznos if they live near enough to one of the few that are still open.
---
These things are probably setup through 3rd party marketing companies anyway.
---
Reminds me of my government.
---
yikes
---
The games been so different ever since the introduced the baby skyscape mount for enemies
---
Some people stated that ap grind is the best way making gold in the long run, is it true?
---
A possibility, yes.
---
Then I take it back.
---
Of course it's vague, that's how marketing works. Slowly revealing things instead of dumping a spreadsheet of features all at once generates more interest towards the release
---
Agreed it’s not a 100% chance of someone looking gw2 up. However iv seen free game promotions and have looked them up just for curiosity. Not everyone will but some will just to see the game. But I doubt reddit is the first place people go to to look up the game. Agreed it’s trolling for arenanet to give a code that doesn’t work. And they need to fix it. However is the code truly enticing that you want the code? No.
---
Two weeks from now?
---
Huh, didn't know that! Thanks!
---
Can't you just buy them from the TP?
---
haha! nono, it fits all too well within that universe, just that sylvaris in general are so dope, i just love them too much!!
---
and nice! sylvaris are definitely meant to be weird looking humans :D
---
I feel sorry for the minimum wage workers that don't get paid nearly enough to deal with the kind of rabid fanism that ppl have over a mini.
---
I think the Alliances will be released in the end of February 2020.
---
True FashionWars uses few, if any, gem store pieces and NEVER a full outfit. If endgame is FashionWars then there's a huge variety of collection awards, achievement awards, crafted gear, dungeon gear, LW backpieces, etc that can make some really phenomenal looks, all obtainable by a casual player. If you want to grind gold for hours and hours just to get the shiniest skin on the gem store, that's perfectly fine, but to say that good fashion is locked behind a ton of gems/gold is simply not true.
---
I don't understand what their decision-making process was for that. Why make some containers affected by MF and not all of them?
---
Why do you think that story instances hurt LW? The content of those instances could've hurt LW, but the instances themselves?
---
Twitch drops are international, have to point that out.
---
[deleted]
---
the nearest quiznos to me is in niagra falls which is like an hour away lol, rip
---
Hey Z.
---
The point of the game is to have scalable difficulty.  The game has depth, but it's fairly optional.  Most players aren't going to open up Discretize, Snowcrows or Metabattle for their builds.  The sheer number of times newbies post their raw stats via their hero panel and ask for advice illustrates this pretty well.  Most newer players have a complete amalgamation of stats; especially the "free" exotics from the level up rewards -- Soldiers, Rampagers, Shaman or Carrion - stuff like that.  
---
Most players play the game outside of a vacuum where they have good boons (25x Might, Fury, Quickness, Alacrity).  They play the game based on what feels good to them both as an aesthetic, thematic and what *feels* like it does good damage.  They use the skills that feel nicely weighted like Rapid Fire or Point Black, Hundred Blades, Whirling Wrath (etc). 
---
I wouldn't necessarily say that GW2 is the "casual" MMO, but it's B2P funded by micro-transactions which makes it very accessible to folks that are RPG-illiterate and have very little experience with the Fantasy, DnD or MMO aRPG Trinity.  GW2 is essentially the game for introverts and anti-social - social people; it's a bit of an oxymoron, but the gist of it is that most people aren't going to look outside of the game in order to understand the mechanics or systems that comprise their "fun."
---
Doing so demystifies the game and on a certain level makes it less fun for them.  GW2 makes it pretty difficult for players to run truly terrible builds (see: multiple superior runes, no energy/mana management in GW1, mismatched weapon mods, insignias &amp; runes).  Most players don't attempt to run uniform stats or optimize their gameplay.  They run around, explore, do jumping puzzles, collect loot and y'know sell off their material storage to make various shinies.  That's GW2 in a nutshell. 
---
There's no reason for people to pursue Raids/Fractals or Competitive PvP/WvW content unless they're curious.  Some people do get curious, but the vast majority are happy to y'know run around an on-the-rails theme park experience.
---
I really hope not there is a 4 part 2 h meta that gives you a 0.0000000000000000000001 % chance to get a reward.
---
Shouldn't that experience bonus now be 10%?
---
They're based in the United States.  And depending on what kind of promotion they want to do, there's an awful lot of red tape to include said promotion in other countries.  That's why, for example, on any promotion that includes some form of lottery/random giveaway, even if Canada is allowed they'll specific "Quebec is ineligible".  Local regulations in the province of Quebec are too much hassle, so the promotion just doesn't happen there.
---
So sometimes it sucks to be in Europe, but that's just how it is.  It's not that they specifically hate you, but bureaucratic red tape is bureaucratic red tape, and that's not something they're in the business of dealing with when it's not absolutely necessary (like in Belgium w/the lootbox ban, where they had to do something).
---
Probably a combination of stricter laws over multiple borders and lack of interest for companies to pay anet to market to thier fan base.
---
Closed in my area and nearest would require a 4+ hour drive.
---
They should partner with KFC and make Quaggan Popcorn Chicken instead.
---
&gt; huge variety of collection awards
---
kinda ... depending on the weight some slots can be a too samey
---
Logistic complexity.
---
Youre talking finding a partner with a presence in multiple countries, navigating the different laws and processes for giveaways and contests that vary by country, having teams translating into multiple languages, etc. It's unfortunately just a way bigger cost for roughly equal payoff (from a raw numbers standpoint)
---
Have all my upvotes
---
That makes some sense to me. I guess what annoys me the most is the lack of clarity as far as drops are concerned. I would really appreciate some transparency on that, and specificity as to what is and isn't affected by MF, and to what degree. I guess that's not how they designed the game, but I've played enough RPGs and looter-shooters that make all that information public to know that it wouldn't be a bad thing.
---
Cringe
---
You don't even get anything good so why does it matter so much
---
All good. I stopped playing years ago but happened across this code while at Quiznos. Figured I'd share for someone who could use
---
Same reason why we haven't been getting meaningful content lately, gw2 was supposed to be on maintenance mode while the majority of the devs worked on other projects, but that backfired so now they're trying to milk gw2 without putting too much money or effort into it while silently dipping their toes in other projects again :x
---
Why? A ghostly is 100g, a peerless is 350g. Meanwhile chak and confetti are well over 10,000g and therefore non existant in the tp. Or do you just want to pray to rngesus so you can sell it?
---
Because resources are spent on "play once and forget" content, whereas the prologue gave us some of the best events of the game.
---
GW2 is strongest at the open world.
---
Man, are they, like a North American company or something??
---
It's likely the easiest thing and probably one of the cheaper options, I don't get why Anet refuses to do it.
---
I quit the game when they added celestial to the fractal challenge mote. I want casually-attainable items, not shit I have to dump gold into.
---
HoT was fine, you just needed a party. They failed at the design by not encouraging parties way more.
---
The Ruins of Orr were similar at release, and survived pretty well during the early karma farms.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

yeh but that kind of person isn't a gamer or someone with a computer that can run games smoothly either. They'd have to download and fully install GW2 which will most likely take a couple of hours, because they have no reason to get the more expensive internet speeds other than streaming some movies and 10mb/s is more than good for 2-4people to stream HD movies. If they finally got gw2 they prolly won't be able to run it at a decent framerate, because the only people I know that have decent enough PC's to game are people that game, work with software programs that are CPU/GPU intensive or are PC lovers and all of them would atleast check out games online to see if it's worth to download/install because one of the first thing you see when googling GuildWars 2 is that the release date was 7years ago and for non gamers that have 0 clue about MMO's most likely think it's incredible outdated.
---
Unless they got paid like 50-100k+ from quinzos for doing this, they just wasted time and effort.
---
I wouldn't call someone who reads what his skills do and understands what boons and stats actually mean  a 'hardcore player'.
---
You can always donate directly and skip the tax writeoff for Anet.
---
Hell you can probably get some sort of tax credit yourself if you do that.
---
No idea why anybody that wants to donate would need Anet to tell them to or would want to donate through another layer that takes a cut. I personally didnt care about the donation packages either so there was no reason at all to participate here, whether i want to donate to charity or not.
---
This didn’t even cross my mind. Yes, we absolutely need that. The old design is way too outdated plus I don’t like the music they use since the launch of PoF.
---
I just wait for them to stop their movement (right before they swarm you) and then do Thief Staff 5 two times. Easy Stacks for the Sigil that gives precision.
---
Yes but you're a gamer so you'd look it up, none of my brothers or sister or parents or other family members or non gamer friends would bother looking it up and just decline it.
---
&gt;However is the code truly enticing that you want the code?
---
I dont give a fuck about the code, I don't even bother entering any of the previous events. The only mini two mini's I use are dhuum and golden tiger spirit thingy, just because dhuum mini is one of the few "look I did hard content" stuff and the tiger because a random person offered her help in getting it cause I said it's a nice mini and asked where she got it from.
---
the boosters I literally delete or insta use so they dont waste any bank/inventory space.
---
There are ofc people that want the mini, not because it's free stuff. But they just want to collect everything so having something unavailable to you is just a dick move.
---
Also people complaining about the code doesnt mean they want it, they're just upset anet does another promo or colab with a random ass and basically unknown company that looks like 0 effort is put into.
---
Then its a pretty weak ass game
---
Be right there. Let me just take a quick plane from Europe to Colorado.
---
What the fuck? Why? You could have played the game and casually work your fractal level, one per day. Are you afraid of learning skill combos? Like dh f1+gs4+2? Are you afraid of playing together with other people in an mmo? Fractals are easy when you level up from 1 to 100. Quitting a game you enjoy over a low resolution pixel abomination, whatever makes you happy. Druids in celestial avatar automatically gain that visual effect.
---
Awesome. This is the only way to enjoy this and other games. It also lasts longer.
---
Exactly. The game industry has gone down the shitter during the last decade. Only a few indie studios survive against the loss of quality and morals.
---
We Hollywood now.
---
it was a post made by either fractal Ben or PvP Ben, I won't go digging for it but you are welcome to do it.
---
Too much varying laws for giveaways per country and better customer protection laws too.
---
username checks out
---
Actually surprised games don't do that.
---
not weak, just casual and not meant to have deep player retention.
---
umm really just USA, as a Canadian I think I got to participate in one but most of the others were USA only
---
I scanned [my face](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/171426/gw238.jpg) and now I can play as a centaur.
---
Woosh
---
He shows a bit of ugly arrogance here. That whole I am a Guild Wars expert spiel, and your views ar meaningless part. 
---
Regarding build templates I am actually in a similar place to WP. I pretty much never leave the heart of the mists any more, on any character. I have no use for them. I could switch build in the minute before a match starts before builds, and still will do now. My only hope for build templates is that they don't affect me in any way. Despite that I would support the players who play other modes to get a better deal for templates, due to basic empathy.
---
I don't think you can't be too mad at WP though. Anet could be commiting atrocities and he would probably try and smooth over the outcry. This isn't something new, he has always been like that. It is just the way it is, just like you can't get mad at helseth for being cocky, or Bik for being unhinged. It is thier mode of operation.
---
10/10
---
quiznos probably still has a bigger daily customer base than GW2 has streamers and viewers of gw2 content
---
US is still mainly console gaming and they're playing mostly sports, fighting games and FPS.
---
He "quit" GW2 as his main game, but he still plays it alongside other games.
---
Hype!
---
Just a note, never post them publicly. All publicly claimed codes might get disabled, as there is many people who seen them and thus can claim ownership of account where it was used (if they manage to get that idea, for example if claiming person responded here and someone knew them). Always send them in direct message to whoever will ask... :)
---
Done that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
smol
---
Not even that. This is all just a distraction from templates.
---
I'm not offended lol. It's called an opinion.
---
My first Experience going in the Heart of Thorns Maps felt straight out of a Jurassic Movie.
---
Is it being pessimistic when you have 7 years of evidence?
---
It takes two to tango. You teaming up with a dying brand is not good at all for you.
---
Because its "free". I dont live in the US and when i donate i do it to stuff closer to me, but this one you could donate with in-game stuff; the people i harrassed (lol, just told them once or twice) are quite in-game wealthy and 800 gems is nothing for them.   
---
I totally understand someone in the US or someone whos new/poor in game not donating.
---
At no point have I suggested anything about being casual or having player retention.   
---
But we can assume that you know, deep inside, what problems gw2 has :)
---
If this is about Shortbow being remove. That's just the mismatch of your Gear Loadout and Traits Loadout. Happens to me as well with any class when I switch Trait Loadouts that use different Elite specs.
---
I played many other MMOs and in comparison to other games, GW2 is extremely casual. You can leave this game for a year, come back and it wouldn't really make any difference at all, well maybe you would miss some events. Totally opposite to GW2 - hardcore MMOs are those where being absent for a couple of weeks means that other players geared up, leveled up when you were offline and you are now in a disadvantage, far behind other players. 
---
"Your Build" makes GW2 not-casual? Do you forget that other games also have builds, often way more complex than GW2?
---
And why doesnt GW2 have more twitch viewers and streamers? Because a) most of their official streams are quite bad and b) no incentive.
---
ESO started doing twitch drops a while ago, and they have an ever increasing viewer and streamer count. And in turn their latest expansion sold big. Even though ESO goes through a rough patch atm, with them having to fix server performance and overall re-balancing.
---
And if you can countenance doing promos with a company thats known for bad franchising, you can do twitch drops.
---
where do these more viewers come from? Only already existing gw2 players would watch gw2 streams in order to score the mini pet but non-gw2-players? Give me a break. 
---
There simply arent any good gw2 streamers in the first place that someone not familiar with the game would consider watching for more than half an hour but why should they do that in the first place? For a minipet, some boosters and a 33% rebate on a game they dont own?
---
Look deeper.
---
Yeah better time it with my 13 hour flight from NZ
---
Also happens when you have lets say dragonhunter and equip a longbow. Then you swap to firebrand. Longbow skills will show grey. Thats not the templates fault. Pretty useless post from op imho
---
Takes a while to get used to it, start by making sure that you bind your stun-breaks/blinks to the buttons you feel more comfortable with and the rest will come slowly.
---
Hey guys, if you are not able to get the codes for obvious reasons, I got you. 6$ through paypal and I will get you the code, just pm me for details - I respond fast!
---
Look at the skills not the weapon, shiro mixed with Glint ,that shouldn't be possible for a revenant
---
"Alright ladies and gentlemen. I need you to design an outfit for norn females that shows as much T&amp;A as possible while *also* minimizing the chance of actually giving anyone a boner. Think you can do that?"
---
good thing souls don't exist
---
And more new stuff so not everything screams like vanilla and hot. I know most don't care about assets and stuff but I really hope for a fresh new look for the areas to come.
---
But what we want to know is, can you outrun one?
---
This is a ridiculous question, don't you think? Yeah, they implemented *face scanning technology* into anything, first off, and into only one of the 5 races.
---
This would be possible if Google or Disney were investing everything they have into a single game. Anet is fuckin' broke, or they must be by now.
---
I see. 
---
Anyway, my point was that armor skins aren't really that much better off than outfits. Yes you have more freedom but we've had issues with mediums coats since forever although it has improved a bit. Light and heavy leggings suffer in a similar way but maybe lesser degree.
---
I swear there was a video game that had the ability to do this...
---
Try again then! It’s likely impossible to get YOUR exact look in, but keep trying to see how close you can get. Finding a close face works first, then see how much you can fine-tune it.
---
The rune still exists, it's fun for open world Daredevil and Mirage
---
Anet needs to choose their partners more carefully, no matter which side is doing the marketing pitch to the other, these marketing pushes have been awful.
---
&gt; And why doesnt GW2 have more twitch viewers and streamers? Because a) most of their official streams are quite bad and b) no incentive.
---
gw2 just isnt a good game to watch on twitch, if you dont know whats going on. No giveaways will change that.
---
And in Anets shoes, I rather have new customers experience the game directly and existing players rather log in and play the game than watching it on twitch.
---
way too easy is an understatement
---
The picture that showed the mastery was titled "Lens Barrier", that's all we know.  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Lens\_Barrier.jpeg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Lens_Barrier.jpeg)
---
\*laughs in reflect\*
---
Tbh I didn't even consider this. Quiznos paying Anet. Makes sense.
---
I'm gonna say the N word...
---
That... escalated quickly...
---
I am fractal level 100 with a full set of legendary armor but I got tired of the community surrounding difficult content + the time requirements of not having perfect runs. I am tired of content requiring kill proof or experience; the community is far too exclusive. Sure, I can do training runs but I just don’t care enough. I switched to being a casual a long time ago and I am having way more fun playing the game. That being said, all new content should be playable/completable/eligible for rewards to all players alike. Not a popular opinion, but that is how I see it. Hard content should only be done for the fun of a challenge and not a monetary reward. Many people have tried to convince me otherwise and pointed out motivations... I get it, trust me. It is my opinion that a portion of MMO players have a mental issue with needing to show things off to others and be better than others because of it. I don’t support that behavior, in my opinion, because I think it is unhealthy.
---
Wait...why should they cost money?
---
I think the Wing 7 bosses are harder to master than some other wing bosses. There is a lot of communication needed and fights get way harder as soon as a person dies.
---
I think they are pretty good designed in the way that they are extremely easy to 'just kill' but hard to master.
---
I agree, the background should get a change, and the music at the character select screen isn't my favorite either. The game does have [options to customize music](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack) though. I haven't tried it yet, but I might have to when I get home.
---
&gt; When did I imply that? I think it is despicable and I think the practice needs to die out. I was more trying to say that it can't and won't die out, nor is it endemic to MMOs because the entire games industry is predicated on increasing profits as much as possible - any industry is.
---
Honestly, I think being defeatist or cynical about it is the wrong approach though. We should repeatedly state this regardless of how effective it appears to be, just to make a stand if nothing else. Try not to buy into it, support games and devs that don't do it, and decry it wherever you can. It's the best we can do as consumers, and I don't think we should be shutting down statements like Teapot's, however obvious they may be to us.
---
Shiro and Glint skills. I like this although I hate those two legends.
---
Don't think it was ever different.  If I'm remembering right, the level 60 part of F2P was that you need to get to level 60 to be able to play World vs. World.
---
If I ever see you setting a foot in WvW i will stab you
---
Maybe that's what it was lol
---
I live in the US and its not really any better for me.  Out of curiosity I looked and the closest quiznos that is open is  a 3 hour drive.  There were 5 shops within 20 minutes but they all closed down years ago.  Cheaper than it is for a foreigner but still not worth it.
---
I'd have considered grabing lunch there sometime this week for the code but I'm not going that far out of my way for the thing.
---
Why would i want my character to look so stupid?
---
Idk I love crafting in gw2, I think some of it is a tad excessive such as the gap to crafting to ascended. 400 - 500 is such a wide canyon to cross and fails to gel properly at all with the climb from 1-400. And then when you get to ascended the amount of materials can sometimes border on absurd. It's about 1 full bank tab of shards, dragonite ore and bloodstone dust for one ascended suit of armor. And that's just to make the vision crystals. To make armor pieces you then need wildly expensive pieces of crafting material like bolts of damask and elonian leather. If you wanted to power through it and just buy all the materials as an f u to the awful ascended crafting mountain you are setting yourself back conservatively 450g which is a massive spike from exotic which is like 420% cheaper to outfit yourself in armor. I shudder to imagine life with ascended jewelcrafting. Gonna be like 800g to forge yourself ascended jewelry, yea nobody is gonna do that with laurels, fractals, living world seasons as an alternative.
---
I just said that you jumped to conclusions, trying to defend the parts of the game you deemed weak, even though no attack was attempted. 
---
This time XD
---
:(
---
I think ANet's biggest issue is that their "micro" transactions are very poor value and the so-called dolphins you speak of might've started looking at the rest of the industry and slowly realizing it. I've never seen prices inflated to such an extent anywhere else, it's astounding how little you can get for $60 in GW2, especially considering you already had to pay for the game itself (and if you're a vet, you paid three times almost full price, while if you're not you'll need to pay for living world instead).
---
Oh no, don't read my response as being cynical at all, what I was trying to imply with the *second* part of it is that perhaps we should begin considering games as integral parts of a neo-liberal capitalist apparatus and begin to ask ourselves why we allow creativity to be constrained and stamped out by studios who chase pure profit first and foremost. 
---
As Teapot himself pointed out, *I don't have the context of the rest of the stream either.* It's about structure, now, about the interactions of that structure on the medium we all know and love. I'd say that's the farthest thing from cynicism. We're fighting a new beast now, but we're fighting it none the less.
---
inb4 Anet charges you 600 gems to remove it...
---
per character
---
:*
---
I agree mostly, but I just find ff14 casual content to be extemely tedious and boring. It might be the same in amount as gw2, but its just really boring for me
---
The same marketing dollars that paid for live action release trailer that didn't even make it clear what was being promoted? Or the fake taxi promotion? Or the tea one? Is anyone really still surprised with anet's track record?
---
but the fact is that people keep falling to it. They have the confidence that they will be able to outrun them and don't even try to fight back when they are hit and keep runing, which causes their death. Pockets raptors are the embodiment of a glass cannon. They hit hard (but their main damage is due to being a big pack of raptors) but they have very low life and defenses. They don't even have active defenses (dodges, evades, blocks) to protect them so they are easy to kill. Cleaving and AoE works wonders against them.
---
i gave as many others but u do not want to hear.
---
Downvotes are 'cause most of people prefers DH, weavers, etc. And when u say that they classes are better than Holo (Because they are) it bothers them too much, almost as if you insult their mother.
---
 I don't know if they think that when you tell the truth, their classes will instantly be nerfed and the holo will do 50k of dps by pressing only 1.
---
But f\*ck it, Reddit is not just for writing just what most want to read =
---
Holo IS A BAD CLASS IN ALL ASPECTS, IS REALLY WORTHLESS TO PLAY IT IN SERIOUS RUNS and  The DH is actually a pretty broken class.
---
I can understand if Weaver or Chronomancer has good dps, cuz they rotations (or the squishy weaver  Survivability) are just hard. But the Dragonhunter / Condi Firebrand are broken afk dps classes (I know cuz I'm playing with them, even I have the heavy legendary raid's armor for my guardian)  
---
 
---
And Anet don't wanna have variety in their game (Ele &amp; DH are the main Power DPS  classes since HoT release; Holo was meta only like 3 months... And they still  nerfing it every fucking update)
---
Nice. That's a good one
---
aaah fuck thats some funny shit lol
---
Yeah, bad move for Quizno's to partner with a dying company
---
Didn't he quit the game? Move onto FFXIV or Classic WoW or something?
---
I'd love one for myself, as an EU resident who had never heard of Quiznos before this promo I very much would appreciate it!
---
Can I have one?
---
What about power or condi, my friend has issues on open content(we are doing Hot together) and when he is alone tells me that has a bad time with the mobs, can you recommend me if better going condi or power. (also I heard someway that condi has more Aoe skills than power) it's true or not
---
Just wait for the all the PvE changes to come, not to mention all the things you can press F on.
---
May I have a code? Much appreciated!
---
I would love one!  
---
But finding a streamer or a good platform to give them out on is best. I wouldn't just paste them into reddit outside of PMs because Bots can possibly grab them.  
---
Thanks for being awesome!
---
Good point, but in this specific case the value is highly volatile (above 2000g when the box is not in blc, 500g when it is. And people don't look at gw2efficiency's account value as "the money needed to replicate" but they look at their progress or compare to others. And every time something changes the account value in a noticeable way for a bunch of people at once, there are inevitably threads of people in panic (or happy) asking what happened as if gw2efficiency's count was an actual mirror of their accounts. So using volatile scales like the BL exclusives box may not be the best solution. It could either be tied to the drop rate of exclusives in BL chests, or to the box price on the tp at the average of the low values in its price cycle (I know it'd be a bit more complicated to do for the gw2efficiency guy). More generally, any item/skins which TP price follows a pattern (due to blc, festivals, whatever) should rather be valued at the average of its lows rather than the current price, imho.
---
Can I have? &lt;3
---
I would say Spelbreaker
---
So the marketing guy got free subs for a week ...
---
For some exp boosters and a mini I don't even want? nah
---
I’ve said it before, but I’m genuinely concerned about the credentials the marketing team has. Hell, I didn’t even get my degree in marketing and I could do a better job. Where’s the social media presence? Where are the Facebook campaigns? On instagram, they only ever show new outfits and gemstone updates. Give me snippets into the studio! Introduce me to more devs and employees. Make me want to relate to you and your game. Show me that this game is amazing and I am missing out by not playing it.
---
Where I live, all the Quiznos that haven’t shut down are across the border. This isn’t how you reach and appeal to new audiences.
---
People were giving out kung fuck up codes freely. Is this deal different?
---
If you have a spare, I'd love one
---
Are you a Quiznos employee?
---
i can;t wait for a whisper in the quiznos.
---
whats funny is theres one less then 10 mins from my house and im still not going
---
It's just a visual glitch, hasn't bothered me one bit, and I only got my rev fully leveled 1 month ago.
---
Certainly not, they even made a little easter egg in desert highlands. On the north of the map there is a place with a waterfall if i remember well, with an NPC you can interact with. That NPC explains you can't go cause of the branded and they got no ressources to move the rocks atm.
---
[Closed Passage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Closed_Passage) — [&amp;BBkKAAA=]
---
I think they said that going forward, fights like Caudecus and Balthazar will now make it to strike missions so those aren't just one off story things.
---
Why is this gw2 reddit titled 'Perfectly Balanced'?   
---
Don't we have enough flame wars?
---
Let's be honest, Quiznos checkmated ANet here. They've managed to turn the subreddit into a gigantic Quiznos commercial.
---
I guess I should've worded it differently - in some cases you go from 1:100 to 3:100 with 200%MF but in others you go from 1:00 to 21:100 with the same MF. Each point of MF increases roll chance by static percentage point value, ot multiplies already existing droprate. Basically the linear formula that looks like (base chance)+(x\*MF); not (base chance)\*(1+MF/100).
---
Sweet.  If you are doing it on the glass instead of auto feed.  U can prob for more if u stack them on each other win a way that put the top of the next one right below the code.
---
I would love to get one, if you are going to be sending to people directly. Hard to get here, in Europe. Thank you!
---
Well, yes. And maybe they don't care if you give away 100 codes for free on your stream that they didn't provide to you to distribute and that you probably didn't buy at a Quiznos. But maybe they do care? I wouldn't wanna find out. That's all I'm saying. OP here is definitely fine and I asked for one myself lol
---
If you want to kill things fast power will always be superior to condition damages in open world because conditions need to ramp up before they reach high enough damages over time and by then, your target is probably dead already. Power soulbeast with greatsword and whatever/axe is great though and allows you to burst packs of mobs really fast.
---
&gt; he is alone tells me that has a bad time with the mobs, can you recommend me if better going condi or power. 
---
Power, Greatsword Soulbeast
---
WH 5 -&gt; Strength of the Pack-&gt; Merge -&gt;  Sic 'em -&gt; Maul-&gt; Heal as One -&gt; Worldly Impact (for ~30-40k) -&gt; Maul -&gt; Hilt Bash -&gt; Maul. You just did about 75k-80k damage to a group of 5 things.
---
Dang, I wish I could be here for when you post them. Shame these Quiznos codes always pop up when I'm about to leave for work.
---
It's really bizzare to me, You can be pretty incompetent devs but if you open yourself to the playerbase, they will still love you.
---
As much as people give Hirez shit, they do have a social media presence and they know how to advertise. The playerbase literally loves some of the devs, despite any bugs or flaws the game has.
---
How/Why? They can be sold on tp now?
---
I wish they would put out some sort of roadmap.
---
I would gladly take one.
---
Mate do you really need a full list of what they said they'd do but ended up not doing? Because it goes all the way back to GW2 development promises that weren't held, and it'd deserve its own full subreddit.
---
Warhorn offhand with what more (axe/sword/dagger)?
---
I'd love one if you still have any left. Cheers!
---
I would love to take one.
---
It sucks that Anet keeps on doing these promotions.
---
I was lucky to have a Kung Fu Tea near my house. But their tea sucks. It's all fake powder.
---
Following - would love one.
---
I would go axe, just for the range, and it is decent.
---
can i get one please?
---
I largely agree with you here.  Anet, clearly have issues and struggle to meet player-base needs, while balancing funding vs. play acceptance.    I never experienced such problems with GW1.  Bought the expansions and that was it!  Here, it seems, that is no longer sufficient to meet their financial goals.    I wholly agree, I shouldn't have had to buy many of the QoL add-ons I have.  They knew they were a problem, else they wouldn't have created them.  Instead of giving them away, they money grabbed.  
---
Skins though, well that's not a need, nor fixing anything broken.  If the time/value of earning gold was more reasonable/profitable (as someone mentioned) , then very few would buy gems, and they won't have that.  So they break it to force some to toil or give money.
---
I ordered Quiznos today, two XL subs (12") and I got 4 of the cards. I did go out of my way to make sure they had the promotion and to include it in my delivery
---
I would love to have one too please! &lt;3
---
They probably did care about it, I'd imagine they had some concepts that involved it but it just didn't come through.
---
I'd be happy to help handing them out. This would mean you'd have to send me the codes to then distribute and I don't know if that makes life easier for you but I'd be happy to hand them out individually and give you credit for sourcing them
---
If there are any left, I would gladly redeem one!
---
This is normal, HoT/PoF are brutal if you are used to the facerolling zero difficulty of pre-80 stuff.
---
You will have to adjust your builds a bit and not just leeeeroy at things, possibly adjust your gear a little, and learn how to react to different enemy types. Keeping a few stunbreaks or condition removal skills handy may also help.
---
Thanks.
---
I love the game, hate the people behind it
---
I think your friend needs to spend more time in the game. Ranger's got at least one build that's strong in every game mode.
---
please dont let drakkar be as easy as tequatle.
---
Where are you getting that information? The wiki has a quote from Isaiah Cartwright:
---
&gt;For example if there is a 1 in 10 category, and you have 200% magic find you will have 3/10 chances to get that category.
---
Or to put it into a formula, (base chance) * (1+(MF/100)). [This is backed up by the research linked on the wiki.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/35063/research-drop-rates-of-materials-from-foes-and-influence-of-magic-find)
---
Wasn't there some npc in Desert Highlands that explained why the pass is not open? 
---
Since this season focuses on Norn and Charr there might be a small chance for a map release that would fill the spot between Fields of Ruin and Desert Highlands. Tho, it's more possible they would toss something between Plains of Ashford and Thunderhead Peaks - Wizard's Folly and Regent Valley were there in GW1. But then, in 7 years they didn't managed to provide a map north from Brisban Wildlands at bandits bridge spot...
---
what many people forget to consider is that there are many ways to hold a mouse. i myself have been using nagas since the first one released.. i don't know when, and despite multiple attempts i was never able to utilize anywhere near its full potential for the simple reason that the way i hold mice does not work for precise side button activation, and any attempt at adapting my grip would result in cramps.
---
nowadays, depending on what i'm doing, i have divided the buttons into 2-3 "zones" so i don't have to be overly accurate and still get some use out of the side pad.
---
this is the meme i was waiting for
---
Almost all of them have closed recently along the US West Coast (where ANet is located).  There was one in the city next to mine, and last time I was there, it was open.  No longer.  Why they'd partner with a "chain" that's nearly extinct is beyond me.
---
Not a very well point.  I don't know what Blimpie's is.
---
