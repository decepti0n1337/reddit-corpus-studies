I was going to leave this thread, because I made my point, but I feel like I need to reach out to you a bit.
---
You do not understand socialism then. Socialism is inheirently illiberal. It is counter to the liberal ideals of personal liberty, individual rights, meritocracy and property. You CANNOT be a socialist and believe in individual liberty, the two ideology are not compatible. Socialism REQUIRES the seizing of property by the state on a large scale, which completely ignores individual rights.
---
You can be a capitalist and being in strong social investment. Hell, the entire wing of Keynesian economics is devoted entirely to that idea, of a Capitalist system that uses tax revenue to reinvest into itself and provide a social safety net to it's poor and most vulnerable. Believing in that doesn't make you a socialist. Period.
---
Socialism is something very, very different. You may think of yourself as a socialist, but if you don't believe in a state controlled economy, you aren't one. You are a flavor of capitalist.
---
It's the same shit most the time gamers say they gonna go to this new game play the shit outta it, bitch on that game about lack of content, then they go back to what ever games they used to play for nostalgia. Then we repeat the cycle
---
They literally said they have people playing PoE as a job. What you said sounds like fiction.

My list is their list. I'm only drawing from the source.

Nah, GW2 was ahead with 29% before I posted the article here.

Even when they really fuck up.. they make a quick apology, make a change, and they announce what's coming in the short/interim and it's just really, really nice.
---
There is no interim, the role is straight up gone.
---
They’re using shared branding too. This was the Christmas card partners were sent this year: https://twitter.com/angeelspog/status/1209096607020539905?s=21

Yes :)

She had a swipe at jebro over star wars because he liked it and she didn't before she took a swipe at derior. So insulting guild wars 2 community members is nothing new for her. Like maybe don't be openly hostile to the people who do your games advertising for you when there not even trying to be nasty to you? Jessica had a severe chip on her shoulder for sure.
---
The story is dull at best, the writing is sub-par, and the cutscenes are plain cringey.  What gameplay there is feels pedantic and time-consuming.  It's been that way for awhile so I'm glad this sub is finally taking off its rose-colored glasses.  For me, playing through the story was always a barrier to the more fun activities this game offered.  That is, until the "story" became the *only* activity it offered.  
---
GW2 easily had the most potential of any MMO in the last 8 years and it was completely destroyed by devs who apparently don't even understand what made their game fun in the first place.
---
Enemy bad cuz evil is so boring...
---
Now this is quality shitpost.
---
Doesn't have anything to do with what I say, Google the individual tasks and flick through the inevitably countless StackOverflow results for yourself. Probably even hit tutorials if you phrase it right.
---
JP didnt say anything "controversial" that caused her to get fired. What caused her to get fired was treating a customer rudely in a totally unwarranted manner and then double downing on it when people called her out. No business will tolerate that.
---
This makes me sad, and I know it's got to be a real gutpunch to the team. 
---
But it's also pretty fair and accurate.
---
I hope, ***so much*** for better things next year. I loved this game more than any MMO I've ever played, all the way back to EverCrack. 
---
I want to love it that much again.
---
You're talking in absolutes and nothing is absolute. You're saying capitiism is great because we can also have social programs, but then it's not pure capitlism. You can say that socialism must take property but that's only pure socialism.
---
As an Australian who has a society that's essentially capitialist with socialized medicine, I abhor the way people lump any kind of caring in with socialism, because they're essentially scared of it. There's a difference between fair trade and free trade that has nothing to do with socialism.  But you know, this socialist is this way but capitilism can have socialist stuff in it is crap.  What you're talking about is a hybrid society where some things are capitilist and some are socialist, which probably have some advantages. I know having lived in the US and Australia I prefer the Australian medical system.

People who calls any type of social welfare program socialism are wrong. Anyone who supports a capitalist system with strong welfare programs while calling themselves a socialist is wrong. You and the people you are complaining about are both wrong, you're just wrong in different ways.
---
You mean like ignoring the fact, that you didn't know how this feature works, but claimed that you did and made several assumptions based on nothign but your imagination? ;)
---
Oh but you're right I see.  Socialized medicine is called socialized medicine. I didn't invent the term.

The trailer's shadow is more similar to the GW1 model.
---
I can literally copy this message for you, you only assumed that it will affect free items, I at leaast listed things it doesn't do
---
"socialists aren’t inherently fannies" 
---
Agree to disagree. :)
---
Basically you hate everything that everyone else says are the best parts and discount the massive amounts of multiplayer content because...well because you want to bitch about the game.
---
If you ignore pretty much everything there is to do, then yeah.  It's a single player game with nothing to do.
---
Also:  Nobody takes the trust system even remotely seriously.  It's there so if you need to clear dungeons for your main story quest that you dont get stuck.  After that they actually reset the npcs to the lowest levels for the expansion and make you GRIND to get them back up to discourage their use.  They are also WAY slower than grouping with players.
---
Did I say I was intentionally running a non-viable, non-Elite spec build, or did I say that I don't like running the elite specs of a certain profession? That Strike mission doesn't require Elite specs, but you assumed that I was running a non-viable build and being a leech because I pointed out that I should be required to run one that I don't enjoy, so you decided to pull a "holier than thou" reply that treats me like I am while being a passive aggressive ballbag. 
---
You and the person I was replying to have the same problem. Why not take a guess what it is.
---
Just a heads up first time posting and on mobile, so if I seemed hostile to ya for no reason it was meant for the OP on this thread about new world. I get being disappointed in lack of content but I hate how quick people will feel a new game will be the killer, take the rest of the population or whatever they say at the time. Just gets sad seeing it get said everytime
---
Firstly I didn’t downvote anything, as I don’t downvote people I disagree with.
---
Secondly your statement is absolutist and  doesn’t reflect modern day social theory, which doesn’t really deal in political theory in that black and white manner.
---
Also socialism itself is a broad church. Like you’ve not really touched on the concepts of market and non-market forms of socialism.
---
For example market socialism still incorporates concepts of profits and the like as motivators for human drive but instead focuses on those publicly owned goods generating a public dividend.
---
The whole topic is vastly more complex than what you’re attempting to expound in your above post, which is basically a GCSE level grasp of the basis of historic socialism. It’s just very very lacking.
---
It’s not a good look to assume ignorance on behalf of other posters, just because you disagree with their political viewpoints. So how about you not assume I’m a politically illiterate idiot and I won’t assume you’re a right wing corporate shill and we can both be happy in our lives?

It's fine for a new player. For vets it's kinda stale.

Except literally no free markets exist in any self defined capitalist country.
---
State interventionism is massive when it comes to corporate markets. In multiple different ways ranging from numerous tax laws, corporation laws, cash incentives and government funded research and bailouts... that all mean the fundamentals of a free market economy in capitalist society is somewhat of a misnomer.
---
We do not live in democratic capitalist meritocratic societies. That’s an illusion, sold to children. It’s also something most kids grow out of believing by adulthood.
---
When true meritocracy becomes a thing... then maybe we can have this debate about the benefits of capitalism; until then it’s impossible to have a conversation on it... as we have literally no working example of it in the world.
---
How about we just stick to the point that the female dev was wrong and made something about her sex, when it clearly wasn’t?

Uh... ok, you cand find hope in the gemstore :D

A [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) might improve game performance (loading time) as well.
---
**Solid-state drive**
---
A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk, although SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read-write heads used in hard drives ("HDD") or floppy disks.Compared with the electromechanical drives, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have quicker access time and lower latency. SSDs store data in semiconductor cells. As of 2019, cells can contain between 1 and 4 bits of data.

I just wish they'd change them to be like engi's kits. The skills already have cooldowns. would be nice to just put em on and keep the weapon on whenever you want. Also just change frost bow into a healing weapon + buff the other weapons to make up for the dmg lost off frost bow. Would add more usability across other builds.
---
Thank you. Of course I never said that.
---
MO
---
&gt; i was using the generalized version of "you" thus addressing everyone.
---
It's generally considered common courtesy to either make that more known, by literally putting in "by you I mean that in general, not you directly" or to word things so that's it's easier to tell. You did neither and came across as a "I'm going to lecture you because you appear to not be falling into line." This subreddit loves to pounce on anyone that dares to point out that the meta is not the end all be all and some content doesn't need it, because even open world has to have a "meta" and a site was built to direct people towards for that. You did exactly that, pouncing on my post in a passive aggressive manner and waggling the metaphorical "be a good player" finger at me without bothering to even comprehend the point of what I said. THAT is why I pushed back at you. You didn't even bother to understand what I wrote or why and then decide to lecture me on that exact same thing with this newest post.
---
&gt;  (while conveniently ignoring my consequential use of the word "if")
---
Your use of the word "if" in no way changes the meaning of what you were trying to get across in this situation. You came across as a passive aggressive ballbag.
---
&gt; or you can see that i made a very basic and general point by using the extremes of the spectrum that, as should be obvious, have a lot of grey area in between them.
---
And you needed to, why exactly? That's the part I really want to know. Why did you feel you needed to post at all in regards to me pointing out that not everyone wants to use Elite Specs? Non-Elite spec builds still have "meta" builds. They are still more than viable for all content but raids which I wouldn't step foot in on a non-spec'd character to begin with and even stated that. It seems like you were jumping in just to jump in without even comprehending the point of my post.
---
&gt; in this instance at least it certainly isn't "deciding to feel personally attacked and pressing that reply button too rashly to throw some insults back".
---
No, it's not even bothering to think, practice reading comprehension, or do anything but berate and then try and fall back on "but I was just trying to 'educate' and heeeeeelp. Don't take it so personally." You may not be a native speaker but there are other ways to post that don't come across as you did.
---

---
&gt;  in terms of single player game with multiplayer aspects you can argue it's doing great.
---
Can you really though? Because if you want to play by those rules, there's fucktons of singleplayer that are much much much better at it.
---
And the week after, and after....
---
they were all busy working on side projects and let the game die with 1 hour of new content every 4 months its their own fault for losing players.

I've played GW2 on a lot of different desktops, plus two gaming laptops (including acer predator helios 300 with an older, 7th gen i5 cpu) and the best results framerate-wise, by far, were on the i5 9300.
---
I get a steady 60 fps in 99% of the game (minus Lion's Arch in certain areas). I was kinda surprised how little effect the gpu had to the overall performance of the game.   SSD is basically a must.

I recommend something like ASUS TUF Gaming FX505GT (cheaper then ROG strix variant).

Social mobility has actually decreased slightly in most western democracies, over the last 20 years. Which is bad as social mobility has never actually been that high in the first place.
---
I can link some articles if you like:
---
Here’s one from the UK government, just for a quick reference. The trend however matches in nearly every developed first world country.

---
People from poorer backgrounds are still more than twice as likely to be unemployed. people born into richer backgrounds are more than 3 times more likely to gain employment in management positions or above.
---
Health outcomes still tend to be vastly lower for people of lower Socioeconomic standing. 
---
Our governing bodies are still massively over populated by people born into wealth and privilege, as is the judiciary.
---
Also when I’m discussing the poor, I’m discussing the poor within capitalist societies; as that’s the current topic of debate. Basically due to the fact that their is no true socialist government in existence and thus we have nothing to compare it too. (No China isn’t socialist)
---
Like I could just sit here listing how capitalism in its current form really really doesn’t work and how all statistics support that and that the wealth of information on this within the social science field is overwhelming.... I just don’t think you’re really open to being convinced on that fact by a random on the internet. 
---
So instead if you’re truly interested in the topic and it’s not just a narrative you want to push, by all means I invite you to read more around the topic. You’ll see we’re actually going backwards on the issues of social mobility and social inclusion.
---
I also deal with the fallout of this on a daily basis, as I’m a trainee doctor, specialising in depravation medicine in the UK. The health outcomes for poorer people truly are in stark contrast to those seen in richer communities. Have a wee gander at the raw data... it’s pretty clear that capitalism currently isn’t working well, as a vehicle for social mobility for the masses.
---
So let me get it straight, instead of actually disproving my points, you just said that i bitch about the game, when i expressed my opinion against yours? I shouldn't have expected more from a FFXIV fan.   
---
&gt; Basically you hate everything that everyone else says are the best parts 
---
I don't care what other people says. I played it and i didn't liked it. It was boring, it was bland, it was lazy, people are saying GW2 is more of the same, but they just didn't played FFXIV.
---
What multiplayer content? A literally useless Eureka? The only MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER ONLINE worthy piece of content are Hunts and may be boss fates, but they're even worse than GW2 bounties! Everything else is tied to matchmaking and there's a reason why games like PayDay2, Warframe, Overwatch or Deep Rock Galactic aren't considered MMO. Because they fucking aren't!   
---
My most memorable interaction with random players in GW2 was when i was leading a whole map worth of people, trying to finish a T4 meta.   
---
My most memorable interaction with random players in WoW was when i was doing a quest with a rare drop and on the spot i found 4 other people, we teamed up and we did this quest for 3 hours straight together, because even when any one of us got that drop, he wouldn't leave until every single person in the party would get it.   
---
My most memorable interaction with random players in FFXIV was an abundance of gold sellers and ERPing cats in Limsa.  
---
Yeah, i know that the henchman were added because nobody played early dungeons if they weren't on a roulette and i have no problems with this system particularly, it's a nice little crutch for what it was made for, my problem is with the game design which led to a necessity of adding them.
---
I agree dude
---
The circle thing seems to cast a resemblance but I'm pretty sure it's an eye for the ice column statue and a...teeth-hole for the drakkar concept art.
---
Other than that they don't look that similar to me.
---
I can see her foundations!
---
Did you not look at the achievement for collecting all of them?
---
Oh no. An easily ignored icon with a blue outline. That goes away the moment you visit the TP which isn't exactly a rare occurence for most people. Yes. Truly outstandingly aggressive marketing.
---
I was going to say that this idea makes absolutely no sense, considering the in-game story of what the beetle is and how you got it. But then I looked at my screen and my character in Lions Arch, and saw some random dude standing there in a cash shop outfit with flames pouring out of his face, helmet, chest and arms, and then another person running by on a Christmas raptor wearing a freaking Santa hat, and ... and then I thought no.... no, that ship has already sailed. Might as well just add any old thing to the cash shop now.
---
Literally no one cares about winning WvW anymore. Or about WvW at all really.
---
Are you hitting the notes when they touch the blue part in the center of the stage? That's the problem I had
---
It's mostly that I have terrible keybinds and I'm physically disabled. I can some how manage combat just fine but when it comes to playing an instrument my brain breaks.
---
That was a nice read, I share the same frustrations. I would be totally fine sinking several more thousand of hours and hundreds of dollars into this game, if I knew the people in charge at Arenanet actually cared about it. Right now progressing anything ingame feels meaningless because the game feels like on the way out.
---
I've heard some snippets (JP and some Glassdoor reviews mainly) about management being the major reason for the games shortcomings, can you share some details why this is? Seems like you know a fair bit more than us.
---
You should change banks.
---
I'd rather have a new interface for all portal scrolls. A "Teleport Panel" that could be added as a new tab to the "Contacts and LFG" panel.
---
It could look like the interface for the Teleport to friend, but as big as the LFG panel: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/xMlzNKV.jpg
---
And each line would be:
---
* Icon of the scroll instead portrait of ally.
---
* Name of the scroll instead name of ally.
---
* Location where it teleports to.
---
Each entry could have a checkbox in the corner, letting you pick a few favorites that would stay at the top.
---
Then, to add any scroll to your list, you just right click it, and you'll have ti available there. 
---
Other than lodge and living world scrolls, it could include all other teleporters like the HoM portal stone, home portal, exalted teleport stone, spearmarshal's plea (you could still get extras for its other uses), etc.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Portal_Scroll
---
Teleport to friends could also be integrated in this. They could be turned into a currency, and at the top of the teleport panel there would be a 'teleport to friend' entry. Click it, and if you have teleport to friend currency, the list of teleport scrolls changes to a list of party/squad members and works just like the usual teleport to friend.
---
I've had a lot of trouble with this too. I didn't even bother trying the previous years, this year I kind of learned how to not die in 2 seconds. I'd say keep trying?
---
Make sure when you RP her in slutty garb you make her a Norn so her knockers are the biggest they can be!
---
Yup, you get a free breather and underwater weapon at a really early level.
---
Can I know why gold to gem conversion doesn't count? I'm genuinely curious why do you think they don't count, because from my perspective they are a godsend for poor people like me. If I want something from the gemstore I can still buy it using gold and that can be my reason for playing. Is it just because saving gold is not fun?
---
Hey all looking to return to the game. Guild wars 2 was my first mmo about 2 years ago (I think?). At the time I really liked the game but was also exploring my options for other MMO’s to sink my teeth into. I played guild wars 2 for a number of months before moving on to other games. 
---
Ive now come full circle and have come to appreciate what guild wars offers after experiencing many other games in the genre. 
---
My question though, is it a good time to join the game and is the game still populated? I have both path of fire and heart of thorns expansions. Am I very far behind in content and if so what will it take to catch up?
---
Especially more than once.
---
Ah I'm also physically disabled, especially with fine motor skills (some days better than others, it's mostly chronic pain related) my hands are also way too small to reach most stuff so I just use the mouse to click the notes :)
---
Just change your keybinds before you go in and after you come back out. It takes like 30 seconds, i do it every time myself. Make your keybinds the normal 1-5 and 6-0 and it's so much easier to do the Bell Choir.
---
Imagine playing GW2!
---
J/k - I left for WoW Classic pvp server, but it has become stagnant already with phases and AV's (battleground) epic snoozefest. I played an unhealthy amount of WvW in Gw2 previously, but there's never any sign of updates to it and, as such, the population died out. I know a lot of people went to archeage, but no ty. I'm currently doing the Path of Exile binge and don't plan to return to GW2 any time soon, or even think about logging in. This thread just happened to jump out at me on my home feed. P.S. Magswag ;)
---
also try the lower part ... i think its the easyest
---
If it helps you can complete it only using 1 2 3 and 4, completely ignore 6-9.
---
Gates 1 Horses 0
---
\&gt;I was rewatching an episode of Big Bang Theory
---
why
---
I'll play this game until the day the servers go away (which likely will never happen being as GW1 is still running).
---
I really wish the game had some new and engaging content. The content *is* there, but it's always just rehashed living world episodes. So for, the "saga" thing is even less than the previous LW content.
---
C'mon, Anet. We're all routing for you. We want this game to be good, that's why we're all still here, even if we are just logging in to do dailies and some gathering.
---
It's 50% more expensive.  AU to USD.
---
The laptop they cited looks to go for about $550 USD.
---
Yes, there were a number of 1050/1050TI laptops on sale around $600 USD over the last few weeks, that's really where the OP should be looking.
---
Self-victimization? GamergAte idiots have been attacking her on social media since 2015.
---
Because it was true.
---
This is superbly well written and sums up my feelings also. They've lost their way... I love this game to death but holy hell has it gone downhill beyond words. Corporate greed for ya'. Shame.
---
&gt; Trust me, you'll be a happier gamer without them. 
---
Hell know. If we did that, we wouldn't laugh when they fail at Cuphead, complain about the music in DMCV \[when the devs revealed the music sucked because THEY sucked since it pumps up along with your style rank\] or when they're too dumb to read instructions in Astral Chain \[where the game constantly tells you you can change the difficulty, constantly tells you it only gives you a letter grade in specific difficulties, yet they wrote in their review that the game doesn't grade you at all, proving they played in the easiest difficulty and didn't even read\].
---
&gt;She literally said she was glad that totalbiscuit died too
---
Bullshit. She was quoting someone else who was quoting TotalBiscuit wishing death on someone he disliked.
---
[removed]
---
Because it's designed to force you to either grind for a ridiculous amount of time or just throw money at the game.
---
These conversions are NEVER done with the player in mind, they're done to force you to buy gems \[since you can convert them into easy gold\] or grind a ton of gold to get a couple of gems. Let's also not forget GW2 throws EVERYTHING into the gem store or into the lootboxes, meaning you HAVE to do the grind if you want anything without throwing ANet your wallet.
---
&gt;Me not knowing who it is already means they are not important and have absolutely no credibility.
---
Who the fuck is JaktheJoker?
---
Me not knowing who you are already means you are not important and have absolutely no credibility.
---
See how easy it is?
---
You want me to get the dude some ointment for that burn you gave him?
---
And leggings, can't forget the leggings! They saved this game!
---
&gt; Yes, GW2 has had a rough year because of JP &amp; layoffs. But would that have changed the game from the direction it was already heading?
---
Will definitely make it tougher. I spent over 6k in this game since launch. With the way this community behaved over Jessice Price, regurgitating far-right propaganda and talking points, I stopped spending money on GW2. So did a lot of my friends who spent thousands on this game. That's already thousands of income for Anet lost just within my social circle. And I imagine my social circle was not the only one to stop funding the entertainment of far-right social media trolls that Anet caved in to. So it will have definitely made the financial situation harder for Anet.
---
The amount of people who care way too much about what other people think about whatever they happen to enjoy is not at all surprising.
---
I don't really see what else they can do at this point. GW2 will fade away into obscurity, and if they have any sense Anet will pull the plug on development before it completely bleeds them dry and gets them axed by their overlords at NCsoft.
---
So, to recap:.

There is no problem here.  If you disagree, the problem *is you.*

Equally? It's more like ten haters for every white knight.

when vets and newbies argue..

[im just waiting for gw3..](https://i.imgur.com/kPqvjqP.png)
---
On the other hand PoF was disappointing in its own way ...
---
It really hasn't, people are just actively looking for it and sometimes constructing it themselves. ArenaNet has done some disappointing things recently, but not literally everything. Not even the majority.
---
Lol.  Yes definitely **trying** to be neutral.  
---
And failing horribly.
---
&gt; The songs are pretty much random afaik so no program could really do it for you
---
They are not random, but botting it is still a hard ‘no’ from the “is this ok” standpoint.
---
&gt;niche 
---
Maybe that's the point. I was never much of a fan of the BBT, so the motivation to do research myself is close to zero. Perhaps someone else can enlighten us.
---
So aggressive
---
I can see her bare arches!
---
im not surprised XD
---
Wish I had the talent and persistence to do this. What an amazing piece, thanks for sharing!
---
It's really easy to get tunnel vision and become intimidated when raids feel new and unfamiliar. They can be built up as elite/difficult endgame content. The stakes might be higher because success depends on 10 people pulling their weight (hopefully). 
---
However, going in with an open mind or without limiting preconceptions can make the learning process easier. It is much less stressful too in my experience.
---
I hate the GW2 Community.. i dont understand why yall hate this post
---
Not really. Someone made a thing that could play Guitar Hero. This should be easier.
---
MO :D Merry Christmas!!! We miss you but I hope all is well =]
---
To me the thing that’s “off” is that the game has simply become too easy. They haven’t added any more elite specs to master or fight against, spvp only focuses on conquest (a fully known and stagnant game mode), wvw gets no changes and is also a fully known stagnant mode.
---
All pve releases in the last year have been too easy. Even the last raid wing they put out, while mechanically interesting, allowed players to skip phases by dealing damage which should absolutely not be happening.
---
To me, at this rate, the game will bafflingly fade into obscurity not through quality or cadence, but by ArenaNet refusing to challenge their player base. It’s the single most bizarre way a game could die.
---
Oh no, they will destroy the world if we don't stop them!
---
Also there is a new region with new dangerous mobs!
---
Meanwhile in the region directly neighboring the new one:
---
Yeah well, nothing changed.
---
Either they give us new regions that are actually interesting and don't just give you stuff to grind for for a week or they make meaningful changes to the content already in the game, because leveling my Xth character to 80 just isn't fun anymore.
---
Noice
---
Too soon, too soon.
---
&gt;I'll play this game until the day the servers go away (which likely will never happen being as GW1 is still running).
---
I am not your doctor, but damn that's a threat to your mental health that has to be taken seriously by you, the other members of this subreddit and your loved ones.
---
GW2 is a blast. Its a huge world thats fun to explore, with map design that rewards you for just wandering around and sticking your nose into the world. The classes are fun to play, the combat is smooth and intuitive, and there is a ton of content backlog to explore.
---
Heartily recommend to new players. The community is very welcoming and helpful ingame as well. My wife started a little over a year ago and it has been a joy following her around as she experiences everything for the first time.
---
What are the items to the left and the right of the recharging teleport thing?
---
Jessica Price being an ass isn't an invitation for you to go on a reactionary screed. /r/KotakuInAction is that way.

We get it, you don't understand economics.

"Whatabout-"
---
WvW supply and xera's portal
---
just what I said, they are Charr,  they are botting, and they teleport from platform to platform to farm gifts.  The op is so amazing they are almost on par with them!
---
I honestly needed this smile today. Thank you, friend.
---
Hey np my dude hope everything runs smoothly
---
you're not wrong but you're also just karma whoring
---
Looks like it based off post history
---
You really dont need much to be more stronger than gods or elder dragons these days.
---
I was gonna say.. what about Bless Online, but then again that's 2018...
---
Ya'll are going to hate me for this but I'm drunk so I'm just gonna say it...
---
Keeping a premium shop running is PHENOMENALLY easy for ANY studio to do, and expecting them to not do the single thing that drives revenue between expansions is just plain ignorant. How many assets can go into any given FREE PVE content release in this game? Hundreds to possibly thousands? Compare to: How many assets go into the average gemstore outfit in GW2? 4 models + textures and some particle effects. High end mounts are basically a new model and a new texture+particles.
---
I'm not going to argue about studio mismanagement or the validity of price points/acquisition, that's been said by others hundreds of times over in this sub... but the idea that the gem store is taking content away from the game is asinine and needs to stop. Ugly truth that it may be, its probably the only reason NCSoft didn't pull the plug on the studio earlier this year.
---
&gt; I learned about the 'other projects' and what those were...
---
Could you elaborate on this?
---
&gt;  I learned what was going on behind the scenes with their announcement this summer...
---
And this?
---
&gt; I spoke to devs about what they deal with behind the scenes...
---
I think I have a pretty good idea what you mean by this: pressure from NCSoft on Arenanet to prioritize shallow depth but continous player time commitment, microtransactions, and internal lack of coherent vision or stamina from Arenanet management. I too feel for the devs, having heard the stories of many well respected devs from GW2 as well as GW1 after they left the company.
---
I am curious about the 2 aforementioned points because I wasn't able to discern what was happening with the "other projects" or "behind the scenes" of the summer announcement.
---
Oh man you are right. He must be doing this so he can use the karma to... 
---
.. buy ferrari?
---
... airplane?
---
...Stocks from apple?
---
Dude who cares?
---
Well we're never getting tengu at this point, so let's go with gates! Signed.
---
Is Memewhine a thing? Can I coin the term today?
---
This - exactly this...it makes it a ton easier for me as well.
---
Nope, because it'll cost 2000 Gems for 2 slots, and 400 gems per extra slot.
---
There's so many possible innuendos about entering and opening, the ERP community could really need this.
---
The talent can be learned. It's all about persistence. ;)
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I keep seeing shit about ERP, is that a big thing?
---
It's like.. heresy!
---
I'm pretty sure that's by design, most of their recent articles aren't anything new, from what I noticed they just take current trending narrative and put it in an article, bonus points if it's in the "outrage" category (internet is addicted to those).
---
Gotta admit, see you answering here made me tear up
---
&lt;3 love and Merry Xmas to you and Mana Works employees.
---
I mean at this point it’s pretty clear they’ve basically given up and are just trying to milk what they can still get out of it. It’s just a matter of time...
---
They don't market outside the game enough.
---
God knows everything else in game tries to remind you that the gemstore exists these days.
---
Oh it's a _big_ thing, alright. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I'm pretty new too. It's always the way with MMOs. The longtime players get burnt out (and often for good reason like the companies doing annoying crap.)
---
Us newbies to whatever game it happens to be often feel overwhelmed. Too much content. 
---
Its a fun MMO so far.
---
Or they can expand the paid universal slots and get you to pay them another 12 dollars.
---
That inventory is too clean ,something isn't right
---
pathetic for what?
---
&gt; Raid/Fractal/Dungeon guilds disbanded and left. People were saying thats its just a minority and doesnt matter.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; WvW guilds left. Alliances maybe in 3 years. People were saying its a minority and doesnt matter.
---
&gt; PvP died completely and we now have bots to fill the queue and gold players on platinum. It doesnt matter cause its a minority.
---
All of these things remain true. The sum total of all those elements do not add up to a significant playerbase.
---
Well the person did say they stay away from trash aye?
---
I lost all hope when they did that announcement back in late August.
---
and to add: ignore the characters animation at all. your char doesnt have to hit the note like its a mob
---
I suspect why it feels off is two fold: the first problem is that the resolution of Season 4 essentially wrapped up GW2's story in a neat bow. Aurene is an elder dragon now, but on our side; people like Braham are our buddies again, the remaining dragons, except for bubbles, are either dead, or they're peacefully and safely asleep. 
---
In terms of story, it makes all these releases feel like a weird zombie epilogue for a story that's already complete. 
---
Worse, though, is the fact that they've pretty explicitly told us that we're not going to be getting another expansion pack (or at least, that seems to be Anet's thinking this past little while). This sort of decision cannot come at a worse time for the game, because as I said, the story the game was trying to tell has already been wrapped up, and without something like an expansion to look forward to, it makes things like this saga feel completely and utterly pointless. 
---
These past few months have felt more like Anet scrambling to assemble some sort of plan to replace something they had at the beginning of the year. Even the way Season 4 ended makes me think there were things that got scrapped last minute-- the level of drama and empathise placed on Aurene's death makes the reversal at the very start of War Eternal feel very weird. I almost wonder if there were chapters in between that were meant to happen, or if she was supposed to remain dead to push the game narratively towards, say, GW3 or something similar. 
---
I can't help this is sort of supported by the way Caithe gets branded, and is used by Aurene to speak, only for Aurene to get better and suddenly have a voice of her own. If she was always going to be voiced, what was the purpose behind having Caithe crystal bloomed and used as an avatar?
---
If it gives someone a good feeling and there's no downside for other people then why complain?
---
sounds help to get the rhytm after a while, i do basically the same thing, except for 3 and 4 buttons since i use my left hand index for both, still not used to press 1 with my pinkie
---
Sounds are the worst thing if the other players on your stage are bad :D
---
I wouldn't even consider it super low effort. He saw a picture on r/all, thought about gw2 and combined the picture and a valid complaint into a meme.
---
That moment when you're going too fast that the snowflake platforms don't even have to respawn from the previous run.
---
Since I have weird keybinds I had to rebind my 1 to 4 weapon skills to 1234 and my healing and utility skills to 90-=
---
From there I just place my left pinky to index fingers on 1234 and my right pinky to index fingers on 90-= with my thumbs resting near the spacebar. From there it becomes a matter of building up the experience and muscle memory of pressing buttons on the right time for each circle. The right time being just as the circle fully passes the outer rim of the white line.
---
Gotta say, rebinding my keybinds every time I wanted to do the choir bell became really annoying so I eventually found an AHK script that rebinds my standard keybinds to 1234 and 90-= at the press of a button.
---
Coming soon: the Tome Tome
---
Wasn't LS5 announced before she even joined Anet? Or maybe around the same time..
---
I would've paid 500-1000 gems to unlock the feature.
---
Not ~500 per slot per character for *loadouts*.
---
I love this idea and want it in game but *idk why because it seems kind of overly complicated and useless at the same time* and Im torn so here's your upvote
---
I’d definitely buy a tonic that turned me into a gate.
---
Might as well get a job
---
Just to help you out, ERP in general means one thing, but GW2 has a second meaning for it.
---
It is either the *Elitist Raiding Party*, a community / guild doing raid related stuff.
---
Or, in this case, *Erotic Roleplay*, a specific type of rp revolving about the erotic side of things (or gates, in this case).
---
That’s last year event you idiot.
---
Meh. It started when the BLC skin "vendors" got a bigger damn building in the new LA than the dungeon equipment sellers. Gnashblade is ruining this game.
---
ArenaNet stated when they revealed that concept art that it is sunject to change. But yes, based on PAX concept art, Jormag's art looks like Drakkar's GW1 model, while Drakkar's art looks like the ice column statue.
---
That said, Drakkar is still Drakkar, since they reaffirmed with Bjora Marches that Drakkar was the voice heard by Svanir, and that Drakkar was in the ice.
---
In a few weeks, you won't even notice anymore.
---
product placement?
---
**If** the trailer shows Drakkar and not some icebrood shark, the head silhouette is very different and is closer to GW1's head.
---
Practice or give up
---
The only similarities is the spiraling design. The rest is very different. Head silhouette, existence / lack of legs, etc.
---
Yeah, perhaps. I feel like they would've had to wrap the dragon story up - at least for this cycle - in order to maintain discrete narratives. GW3 could do another time skip - maybe now that the Elder Dragons' reawakening has been cancelled, we can see a more advanced Tyria with better technology, more developed society (I mean, it's basically a handful of city-states right now) and meaningful progress that wasn't undone by the dragons' reset button.
---
Iunno, just spitballing. If they were somehow to wrap up the remaining Elder Dragons in a season or two, that's kinda the only way I see it making sense going forward.
---
I also think it wouldn't be called GW3 tbh. GW2 was offputting enough to people who hesitated to commit to an MMO that was a *sequel*. Some rebranding for the successor would be necessary. Like Pathfinder to Starfinder, yknow? Same universe, lots of concepts carried over but a whole new era rather than a 'here's more of the same'.
---
Idk I think they're cool
---
&gt; which likely will never happen being as GW1 is still running
---
GW1 is hosted on GW2 servers and costs next to nothing to maintain. 
---
Same can't be said about GW2, there is no GW3 on the horizon. 
---
Expect GW2 to get axed the moment is stops making money. And considering how "great" Anet is at communicating, it could come out of nowhere.
---
It's just the biggest MMO disappointment, period.
---
No that's too much work
---
They tried building an ultra casual adventure game on in-depth action combat system which is only used to the fullest potential in player vs. player combat and on franchise with competitive roots and history.
---
They casually walked over all of their games' advantages and focused on easily the worst part of it, not even succeeding into making story better than average in 8 years.
---
Also, overlooked a single game mode they had no MMO competition in - WvW - and have treated it as a joke for 7 years.
---
Good game, fucking awful company behind it. It's a miracle the game still somewhat holds up after years this shortsighted crew spent on screwing up what the OG gw2 has built.
---
Tell me how you were 100% certain a new expac was coming.
---
The best way I've found to deal with children like that is to report and then drop something in map chat that you hope they're happy the map will fail, before exiting and reentering on a different one. I've seem many times when one person leaves, the entire group falls apart.
---
I don't play it but still can be sad about it
---
Just quick pic I sketched on my **smartphone** \- this skin is sooo cute &lt;3
---
&gt; Truthfully, I'm disgusted with the way ANet is treating this fantastic game. 
---
Honestly I would love if another dev studio to take over but I'm not sure they could keep the spirit of the game alive.
---
Time for Guild Wars 3.
---
A return to Cantha (for pve’er)
---
A return to the Hall Of Heroes (for casual PvP)
---
A return to Guilds Vs Guilds as the premier mode and Ladder comp mode.
---
A return to “dual classing” because you know they didn’t take that away to protect players right? They took it away to make balance issues easier (so they did it to be lazy because the player base “out think”).
---
So no more lazy devs... want to make a real game? Want a return to the brain game that was the original “Build Wars”
---
Want to make money and milk the franchise for another round?
---
GUILD WARS 3 time is soon or else this was the last guild wars
---
(An embarrassment where builds are stale.. power creep has taken over from traditional balance oh and guilds don’t actually war except in guild chat “drama”)
---
So let’s light a candle for gw2 it’s truly either going to take the franchise to its death OR it’s death with rebirth something the player base will actually switch too for the future.
---
I came from gw1 started at factions preview weekend.. find me someplace to go and make a new game or else lose me (and all of the me’s to other games over time)
---
Gw2 is at the end of life and it’s not wrong or bad to say so.... it’s had a wonderful run but it’s lost direction, focus, and most of its player base are aging casuals (which sadly doesn’t lead to future sales).
---
We need something to bring youth and fresh eyes and new blood and the only way that happened is by allowing gw2 to float and die for a few more years at best (then maintenance mode like gw1 for you guys who can’t get out of the past)... AND gw3 for the kids and us old folks who want to see the franchise survive OVER the death of one game.
---
So I’d prefer to see a successful gw3 within 5yrs over them trying to even patch or play with gw2 ancient game engine (at that time gw2 will be like 13yr old.... the internal game engine is not optimal for new machines even now and in 5more years of PC development the old engine won’t even be good at that point)
---
So we need to let gw2 go
---
Idk if its doing great, eso suposedly has better story content and ff14 has a very good story and consistent updates.
---
GODAMMIT
---
Tell me when you found out
---
&gt; I actually put the same thing here as Blunder. I was horribly disappointed Blizzard’s conduct. I still am. While the award when to actual games, which is fair, I stand by my nomination. I had expected better of Blizzard. I don’t expect them to be good because they are far too arrogant for that, but I expected than the spectacle of rampant greed that we got.
---
And this guy gets paid to write professionally, presumably? What the fuck is with this writing?
---
The early seasons are actually good, where there is only 4 of them.
---
Is it really you?  I see a photo, and Izzy and the others....
---
If it is, best of luck of luck with the new studio and your future projects!  If they're anything like GW1/2, it'll turn a few thousand hours of our lives into happy gaming memories.  Cheers!
---
you’re not wrong but you’re also a party pooper
---
Tbf, the MOP readers always vote similar to the MOP crew. They have their own little echo chamber over there and everyone stating a different opinion gets deleted fast...
---
If it's hard and has minimal rewards then it's GW1.
---
(I slog through a GW1 dungeon, have 60% death penalty at the boss and only get 1 diamond.)
---
This raised more questions than it answered but okay!
---
Anet can do content, they really can. There are two main issues, they are ignoring content they made, and they cater exclusively to the bottom lane which, suprisingly as for an mmo, is on a mental level of kids eating sand from their sandbox
---
I bet that is jarring to new players who wonder why LA looks so different.
---
You realize that none of the devs that made Gw1 are still at Anet right?
---
They are now at r/Manaworks.
---
Hell yahhh...just bought the expansions yesterday ! Now im feeling like god
---
Isn't it at this point, now that you know the direction of the game, better for you to not play anymore instead of sticking around while not being happy with the situation?
---
Yeah you're right. I was trying to wake up on my desk and did take your comment too seriously. Sorry about that. I'm not trying to be a fanboy btw. I'm not even sure if i'm gonna preorder the game or not. But it is looking pretty interesting for what we know so far. I was pretty meh about it before knowing that it will be a pvp survival game but apparently it will be a pve centric full sized mmo with optional pvp.
---
Roamer bad, PvDoorer good.
---
Find a dell 7577
---
Are you auto attacking from range with your core warrior?
---
Enjoy the lash of the spanking.
---
Well, reddit should have been more specific before making them cave.
---
It almost like you dont even play the game and just did a quick read of ff14 related things lmao. its ok gw2 subreddit is a safe space. I for one can't wait for that expansion level gem store update baby.
---
I feel personally attacked.  But you're right.
---
At this point we will need Doctor Strange to do the bargain for us.
---
hasn't changed a bit. the only scenario in which you could harvest in more than one guild hall was if the different guilds had their synths at different levels. you not being able to harvest them anymore simply implies that one guild caught up to another.
---
Do downvotes take away from your total karma pool?

spend a bit more and get the asus laptops like this [one](https://www.amazon.com.au/ASUS-Gaming-FX505-Black-FX505DD-BQ002T/dp/B07QFCNWRR/ref=pd_sbs_147_5/358-5456643-0906931?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07QFCNWRR&amp;pd_rd_r=28d29e86-7f8a-4dfe-8eb9-cf71ebf85562&amp;pd_rd_w=r8ph8&amp;pd_rd_wg=I5qfu&amp;pf_rd_p=5ea2ae6a-6445-4b9a-9291-96f5b9b2b48d&amp;pf_rd_r=S0SXZF5XB2CKHRE21SX4&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=S0SXZF5XB2CKHRE21SX4). australia amazon has no variety man this is so sad.

VG(reds), Matthias, Cairn, Desmina, Largos, Sabir?
---
Post PoF
---
Those differences are well within the differential threshold of both game styles.
---
For example, these two are the same trolls:
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mountain_Troll  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Snow_Troll
---
These the same giants: 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Giant_Hunter  
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nomad_Giant
---
And these are the same crocodile-like drakes:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Drake  
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Steelfang_Drake
---
Considering the differences between game styles, these two totems may as well just be identical, comparatively.
---
The idea is pretty simple: Put all the teleport scrolls in a single panel.
---
My description is just long.
---
that sea one was a fanmade contruction which never got released and while PoF had a decent first impression the replay value is nonexistent
---
You can actually miss a note and only lose a bit of health, but not the score if you do hit it after that.  So don't be afraid to double tap when in doubt. Every "correct" note restores the health you lost, so with some practise you can complete your achievements without instantly dying. 
---
Good luck, pal!
---
Guild Wars 3, using the latest Unreal Engine... That’s all one can hope for.
---
Your suggestion is a great addition, thanks for sharing. To add onto it, if a person isn't using any of their F keys they can use those as double binds for instruments as well.
---
For me though my weapon set keybinds from left to right are 2134R so I still need the script to swap my 1 and 2 keys. Similarly outside of the choir bell minigame I like to rebind R with something when playing instruments and I've already bound my F1 to F4 keys to things. I'm also using 7890 and F6 to F11 for GW2radial though I could definitely use different keys for GW2radial to free up those keys for as double binds. 
---
Oh well, I could still use the script to change keybinds based on what build I'm playing I guess.
---
The conversion itself doesn't "force" a grind necessarily. 
---
Imagine you have an mmorpg where getting BiS gear is relatively easy. You still get some income from playing the game, no matter what it is, which can be spent on convenience, cosmetics, luxury items and so forth. As long as there is fun content and the rewards are distributed reasonably between various types of content. It lets rewards be an extra to fun gameplay, and game devs can use those rewards to promote desirable gameplay. Note that GW2, aside from reward balance, did this reasonably well at the start. Everything gemstore here is /extra/. 
---
But certain groups cared more about the rewards than the gameplay. In fact, they repeatedly demanded gameplay get slashed and rewards get upped. I'll call these skrit. The skrit ASKED for exceptionally rewarding content with minimal effort. And they ASKED for more fashionable gear to grind, a billion times over.
---
Whenever rewards were adjusted or rebalanced, the community went REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Remember HoT release? ANET HOW DARE YOU NERF MY REWARDS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Whenever broken types of farms such as ML and early istan were found this community defended it... While grinding the fun away themselves.
---
Think about how boring yet popular ML was. Consistent with semi blob east that was as afk as possible, only to press F and hop through 10 instances to press F some more. And yet people did that, every single day, billions of times. You could sometimes find multiloot groups in the middle of the night on EU. 
---
Gems didn't turn the game into a grind. Giving ridiculous rewards for literally braindead content did. And making any other type of content less rewarding due to economy works in the process only made it worse. 
---
Degenerate skrit told themselves the game is about shinies and fashion. To the point of demanding exceptionally rewarding yet braindead content... Then they go full braindead grind mode for a year; and after a year they realise it's pointless. 
---
I guess there's a reason skrit aren't the most intelligent creatures in tyria.
---
If you wanna prove gaming journalists aren't complete hacks then misreporting a story with hillariously massive bias and not even bothering to get your facts straight is probably bad optics.
---
Trying ton dismiss that point with faux accusations of racism even more so.
---
Come back to GW1 if you're not happy with GW2, the community is still alive and kicking and it's one of the best games ever mad for replayability
---
1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. **FUCK THE GEMSTORE!**

We need literal gatekeeping to fix WvW. Scrap alliances, give players full server control!
---
Like Zarurra said, PoF is pretty bland but the story was decent. Story began going downhill during LS4. I don't wanna spoil it for anyone that may think going back to the game so I won't go into details.
---
They tried to write at a level they can't exactly reach so any potential plot twist that they implemented had a painfully obvious outcome and as if that wasn't enough, they deployed a deus ex machina as well to get out of the hole they wrote themselves into. It doesn't really have a good flow, nor it makes you wonder about what's coming, it more reminds of watching a bad movie. To a big degree I imagine that's due to the ever shrinking duration of story per release since the final episode of LS4 is barely over 90 minutes.
---
I haven't played LS5 as I stopped playing GW2 a couple days after the last episode of LS4 went live but seeing how people in the GW2 forums were applauding the writing, I doubt anything has actually changed for the better.
---
But I xan excuse it with catering to the bottom line. Raids were... Let's say they tried to grow endgsme community but people cried as they fail to find 3 people to walk into greens on vg.
---
Personally I think it's not worth going back for easy mode raids, both because of stigma and because if you make easy mode easy it won't help you with normal raids, and if too hard people will cry. The same goes for strikes, which are 'definitely not raids,' so if you get challenge modes people will cry.
---
This, or they just bundled too much code together and they would have to edit several times more lines than we think

&gt;The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р; Голодомо́р в Украї́ні;[a][2] derived from морити голодом, "to kill by starvation")[3][4][5] was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine,[6][7][8] and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine[9] or the Ukrainian Genocide of 1932–33.[10] It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–33, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.[11] Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine[12] and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government.[13]

Imagine writing off one of the biggest genocides in recent history as "whatabout-"
---
Can't say I expected anything better from tankies.
---
Sounds like Google and messaging apps.
---
That's an issue for me because the tickets are needed to get armor and weapon skins. Other stuff can be earned elsewhere, but the skins sold for tickets can only be earned through spending massive amounts of time in WvW. It does not require any skill whatsoever, it's literally just a  timesink. And one with a timer at that since most of the tickets per week are given for later chests. So it's a lot better to spend every breathing moment in WvW one week and only get wood the next one than it is to spend 3-4 hours there every week.
---
They still, even to this day, have botting problems in pvp.  
---
And in gw1's engine, that is absolutely hell tier as mesmers become gods.
---
Anet announced in August that the map is going to be extended. The issue is that we got half a map after half the usual waiting time which means one map after 4 months, just as before. Nothing changed.
---
&gt; A return to Cantha (for pve’er)
---
&gt; A return to the Hall Of Heroes (for casual PvP)
---
&gt; A return to Guilds Vs Guilds as the premier mode and Ladder comp mode.
---
&gt; A return to “dual classing” because you know they didn’t take that away to protect players right? They took it away to make balance issues easier (so they did it to be lazy because the player base “out think”).
---
Why don't you play gw1?
---
wow. this is hilarious and sad at the same time. im glad i bailed on gw2 to finally get into ESO. I will always love gw2 for the 7 years of fun and the community, but sad to say they are now pandering to gemstore whales and twitch streamers. if they are desperate for money they should adopt an optional subscription system... this is so sad, im sorry for all those who truly loved this game and now have to watch it prostitute itself to make ends meet.
---
Unreal is not made for MMOs...
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e7kjwx/parody_rewards/
---
I've been talking with a few devs actually about rewards for WvW.  Gold making might not be the reason we play it but it would still be nice to be able to actually afford things especially considering that like raiders, we need to buy or make the best food to stay competitive.
---
I calculated it.  One hour of LS3/4 metas in PvE is about 35-39g.  One hour in WvW with a blob and three way fights + some minor karma training waiting for people to log on was 3-4g.  Buffs were about the same in each mode. 
---
 +10% karma guild buff in PvE versus the +10% reward track gain in WvW.
---
All the reward tracks are pretty bad in terms of making gold.  The absolute best technically is the gift of battle one but for the average player, its the living story ones.  Converting magic to mats and selling is your best bet to make more gold.  The skrimish track helps some but skirmish tickets are nearly worthless unless you need gear.  In terms of making gold though, I don't see any real opportunity.  You can open chests and sell the unidentified dyes which have cut in half in their value since the chests were introduced.  They are now hovering at about 6s each.  Using your chests on siege boxes or badges of honor is just a horrible conversion rate.  There is indeed gold to be made there but its literally not worth your time where you could be out playing instead making more gold.  Even after all this, you still need to be a high ranking player to see any real income of materials/gold.
---
The other problem we are seeing is that without the release of new materials (like we mostly see with expansions), is that the market is very saturated.  Items like "Eyes of Kormir" are nearly worthless now.  Millions upon millions of materials with no use for drops their value to just a few copper which is vendor price as well in many cases.
---
It just sucks when you see a hardcore WvW player with 100g in their bank and then a hardcore PvE player with 2,000g+ in theirs.  Speaks for itself really.  Don't get me wrong either, I don't think WvW needs to be THE gold making method in the game.  Maps are already capped with player counts so we don't need people filling the map just for rewards or going AFK/doing bare minimum just to get rewards like we saw when skirmish chests came out originally.  Everyone just AFK'd in SMC to repair walls from trebuchets and capped the map so people couldn't join.
---
nice downwotes kadokadowa. i see thats a trend on pretty much all your posts.
---
Let's face it: we're in maintaince mode. That's what's up
---
&gt; I would love to have another dev studio take over but I'm not sure they could keep the spirit of the game alive.
---
Anet have already killed that spirit themselves. I'd wager that another studio has a higher chance of resurrecting in than Anet does.
---
But the light flamekissed pants are a skirt...?
---
And there are two other different looking pants...?
---
Did you just see the fiery part and blurt out an answer without even checking?
---
I don't know how PoF was but there was a distinct flavour of "going downhill" during LS3 as well in my opinion.
---
IDK much about solo chrono atm, but I’m sure it’s good, since its dps build is still great pure dps wise.
---
But, the recent trend for solo speed runs is with condi firebrand. Basically guardian is busted right now with great self buffing, top class burst and dps, and crap loads of utility, so it’s pretty great for soloing stuff like dungeons and fractals.
---
Here’s a recent [Arah p3 solo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eazyvu/solo_arah_path_3_1200/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) posted on here.
---
There is also some crazy stuff going on with soloing fractal cm’s with bunch of different builds and classes which you might find cool.
---
Just search “solo (insert content you wanna solo)” in the subreddit.
---
&gt;you already had a direction...
---
They deviated from the manifesto they showed us almost immediately at launch, so forgive me if i feel they didn't really a full direction at all.
---
The Arenanet that made GW1 is dead. Current day Arenanet is just another greedy corporation.
---
&gt;WvW needs more scattering of players all over the maps, and having player skill evenly distributed between worlds, which would never happen if players had control.
---
It doesn't happen now, and it will never happen. It also doesn't happen in most other PvP games where they intentionally sort players more or less by skill because it allows everyone to compete at their own level, rather than at the average level. 
---
Beautiful ideal scenario but no sorting system anet makes will ever produce that.
---
i mean, aside from what they're called, what's the difference?
---
First we need the icebrood saga tome...
---
Because everyone else was unhelpful I did some research myself:
---
You forgot the massive amount of group content they delivered with Strikes, how tremendously fun and rewarding they are.
---
Every Raidgroup not seeing the value in Strikes, or the huge amount of people that got pulled into raiding by doing Strikes, definitely needs to quit and play something else.
---
&gt;Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.[1][2][3] It is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.[4][5][6] When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be "What about..." followed by an event in the Western world.[7][8][9] As Garry Kasparov noted, it is a word that was coined to describe the frequent use of a rhetorical diversion by Soviet apologists and dictators, who would counter charges of their oppression, "massacres, gulags, and forced deportations" by invoking American slavery, racism, lynchings, etc.[10] It has been adopted by other politicians and countries.
---
They've been shit in gw2 for 7 going on 8 years now sadly.
---
u/nwordcountbot
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
I have looked through adramolino's posting history and found 8 N-words, of which 7 were hard-Rs.
---
Servers are linked for two months and are then changed based on a matchmaking algorithm that only anet knows how it works. Guilds come and go on servers so I would suggest finding a guild of like minded individuals that you enjoy playing with. Having said that mag is a growing server, #magswag.
---
This is called neoliberlism, see Wendy brown lectures to see how far this has changed our society
---
Oh it's great for GemStore sales. 
---
Does shit to make an actual game though.
---
I played WVW when your server wins, your server get extra MF/karma/gathering boost. Idk if its still a thing but I guess not anymore, so what do you even get if your server wins?
---
VG you need conditions for red sure, but the boss itself doesn't favour condition damage somehow, the rest don't favour condition damage aswell..... Some of them favour confusion or torment, that's very different from condition damage because condi DD doesn't apply both a lot....
---
Well, shit that didn't work out as well as I thought.
---
And you think anet can?
---
&gt; we got a free bath towel. 
---
Are you refering to the guild cape or something else?
---
&gt; In fact, the new map was on the stake for being too small Despite obvious plans to expand it in the future, as Shaman figured out
---
ok
---
so?
---
How is expanding a map different from releasing another map is the time it takes for it to get expanded is the same as the time it takes for a new map to be released?
---
The end result is still the same ammount of content in the same ammount of time.
---
I don't follow your point
---
How is expanding a map different from releasing another map if the time it takes for it to get expanded is the same as the time it takes for a new map to be released in the first place?
---
so many people who tell themselves they're fine with this game come to this sub to be vocally upset at posts from people who have issues with it, completely missing their own point about not complaining and just going somewhere else if they don't like what they see. hilarious stupidity.
---
The issue is that a lot of us have genuine love for this game. We don't want to give up on it, which makes this powerlessness in face of current events that much more frustrating.
---
I've had this franchise be a part of my life since I was 12 years old. It literally drove me to who I am today by giving me my love for story-telling, and now I write for a living. I don't want to give up on Guild Wars. I don't think I could even if I wanted to.
---
I hope the rumors are true about GW2 being a dead game. I hope 2020 will prove them all wrong and hopefully ANet can bring this game back to its glory. ☹
---
I am just excited for Episode 2 of the LW Saga.
---
... We're finally going to meet Drakkar!!!! 😃😃🥶🥶
---
&gt; the bottom lane which, suprisingly as for an mmo, is on a mental level of kids eating sand from their sandbox
---
It's sad how true it is. It's incredible how big the skill difference can be in this game.
---
Yeah I totally agree that they could continue to develop a systems like bounties throughout new zones/expansions, but I can also reasonably see inventing a system specifically for one expansion and without being design-obligated to use it for future zones and expansions.  Sometimes past features, which could be amazing and fun, present serious design constraints on future content.  
---
For example, imagine how different future map design is now that mounts and all of their crazy abilities exist.  It's a completely different endeavor.  That's why in many MMOs, it's sometimes decided to not even allow the use of things like flying mounts in new content.  You must first complete your progression through the zones naturally before "unlocking" the ability to use your mounts to "break" navigation of the zones.  I'm not saying Anet will do this in GW2 - every current indication is that they love what mounts bring to zone design - I'm just using it as an example of what other developers have done in other MMOs in the past.  Even though this would be a reasonable thing for the developer to do, I'd imagine fan backlash would be similar: "Anet is abandoning old cool systems they invented!"
---
There wont be a GW3. I Still dont get why people are asking for that... GW2 was a huge improvement graphical wise from GW(1).
---
It's like asking for WoW2, 😅
---
This is exactly how i do it. Also note that the upper and lower and middle thing matter to when you hit the key. If you don't take that in to concideration it will be much harder to get it right. Lowest is probably easier for those that have trouble. As soon as i understood how that worked it became very easy and the last few years i even manage to hit most keys if it is a good day :)
---
You could also see a GW2 poster on the wall of the main character's room in Animal Kingdom.
---
Really cool to see GW2 here and there 😁
---
read my post above, ty
---
I wood like to play gates
---
Man, you 2nd person plural, you and those like you who play 5000 hours wow plus 5000 ff14 and God knows how many in wow and still want more content.( Is this your case, isn't it ?)
---
Maybe gw2 decided to love in. Adifferent way to get new players, maybe they decided they like their current playerbase and decided that they had enough increment in numbers to be satisfied . You do not know. Nor I do.
---
But while I am sure you do not even play anymore gw2 and just complain for the sake of doing I still play and I am happy of the current state of the game.
---
You said I live in. Abubble . The only bubble is this subreddit which is such a small part of the community and if full of ppl who do not play anymore .
---
I am sorry game changed in a way you do not like but since they moved using data collected to decide their direction I am sure they know what they are doing 
---
So you can complain as much as u  want the game is not closing for at least many months yet. Years probably after the go in maintenance bmode .
---
So why are u so angry ?
---
thank you! i finally got them to spawn
---
I feel like it's more based on an axolotl, especially considering the "horns" that look like external gills
---
we all know that they will fuck alliances up just as much they did with "build templates", and even if its ok its coming to late and still won't solve WvW other dozen issues, which wont get fixed because after alliances anet is done with wvw
---
The hypothesis is that Anet making GW3 would give them the ability to revamp and fix what's broken in GW2. For them to fix GW2 it would require too much resources for an old game. They would get a fresh start with new expectations and ideas. 
---
I personally love the idea of GW3. They find a middle ground between GW1 and 2 in terms of gameplay. Removed conditions as a main sources of damage. Which would ease up balancing issues. Put back in old classes and use the new ones. 
---
I get many sont want to see GW3 until gw2 is fixed but I wouldn't blame them if they stopped trying to keep this game alive in favor of doing something better in Gw3.
---
Orphans can live more than one year, you know. ;)
---
Griffon adventures replaced with token roller beetle race
---
For me, your missing the biggest one.  Build templates.
---
What a satire.   
---
I love it XD
---
Yeay, more story cutscenes. That's just what the game needs in his current state
---
I check this reddit every day and any genuine complaint or criticism of the game or the dev's actions is dwarfed by the utter maelstrom of simple spite. It's not even disillusionment at this point, hordes of people here just decided they'll hate and tear apart every single thing about this game, and you're downvoted and ridiculed to hell and back if you don't join the hivemind
---
At this point it's like some just really, genuinely WANT Guild Wars 2 to crash and burn, entirely so they can pat themselves in the back because they "saw it coming"
---
Ironically I found that MOP article on the official forums, the feelgood land, and GW2 was way ahead before posting it here. 
---
Cool that you still enjoy the game, but that doesn't invalidate the points made by others. This is just a bad jab at the people familiar enough for the game to critique it properly.
---
The content and atmosphere was there in GW1. That said, sometimes the story was pretty lame (*cough, cough* Factions *cough, cough*).
---
I love the poses, incredible how you can do that and keep anatomy correct. Way better than I could ever do!
---
The game was very successful because the management was ambitious.  But they made ambition their entire identity, so they've never bothered to see anything through until completion.  After they got a successful core game, they should have iterated on the best parts, instead of introducing unpolished concept after concept.
---
That said, we live in a gaming era which it has been proven you can deliver quality content WITHOUT a subscription model. Having no sub doesn't excuses devs from underdelivering anymore.
---
i was answering to that billion times dodge jumping XD
---
I also switched to FFXIV around March, and I haven’t regretted it one bit. Playing through each expansion and having the game progressively *get better* was honestly shocking to me. Also, Square Enix is wildly transparent with what new content is coming up and what classes are being balanced.
---
I keep looking at this sub hoping for a positive trend in GW2, since I have so many fond memories of the game. But it’s just so stagnant, constantly stewing in negativity.
---
As a returning player trying to level a new alt what is currently the best way to do so? I boosted to level 60 with a birthday level boost and was wondering what my next move should be. I've leveled enough characters at this point to not need to experience that again. Thanks!
---
Ouch I can't imagine what it must be like to think things are just peachy for the veterans of this game. Brings the river in Egypt to a whole new level.
---
Nothing wrong with liking the game; but, to ignore the problems with the game and the direction ANet seems to have taken is being willfully ignorant.
---
That also does not excuse idiots claiming anyone having a contradictory argument to a criticism as a "white knight".
---
There are idiots on both sides of the coin and they are usually the majority in any given community and population.
---
You people are a fucking bore.
---
Exactly guys, have some dignity and at least let the sick and burdened die in peace.
---
Did you know that you can use their pitch of their whine to cut sheet metal?
---
Critics always diss them, but fart jokes are a classic staple of comedy that deserves recognition.
---
Its more like the game is headed in a downward spiral that it can’t come back from and people are pissed that ANet are letting it happen.
---
yes they have to give each other awards cuz no one else will
---
Nah. Because I criticize them for gemstore stuff on things actually related to gemstore fuckery, I don’t put unoriginal dribble under a post about a narrative dev getting appreciation from his coworkers, because I’m not a cunt.
---
Yes, they're based on gemstore items though.
---
Bobby Stein is a cool dude who brought some of the good narrative design in raids. Let’s not drag single devs for their work because of bad decisions made by others.
---
that's some Witcher III level shit :p
---
The PvD is strong in this one.
---
Exactly :)
---
minus that these asura have 3x the average asura-leg-length. unless they are humans wearing asura head-masks?
---
&gt; There was just a post about a narrative dev getting an appreciation button and some jackass responded with “how much did he increase gemstore sales”.
---
Yes, and a lot of people put those jackasses in the same pot as the guy with 12k hours played describing his worries in a very well written 5 paragraph post, then generalize the sub as too toxic, when it's really just very critical. One example: OP's picture.
---
Yikes buddy.
---
And this is how you get an entire sub full of children to hate your comics.
---
But now it's Gem Wars.
---
Season one was a narrative masterwork. Every mystery we solved caused 5 new and all characters got an individual touch.
---
Season 4 was dragon chibbi fan service with a predictable and plain story without any twist.
---
Just look at Kasjory. In S1 there was this bad ass private investigator running a run down dirty pub in DR. And a fallen noble trying to jump out of the shadow of her family's name.
---
In S4 their only left character trait was: They are gay...
---
Anet narrative lost their Mojo over the last few years. Don't know wat you could learn at this mentorship
---
&gt; There are idiots on both sides of the coin and they are usually the majority in any given community and population.
---
...
---
You are comparing two stories of the same length (PoF and LSX). But !
---
The difference is that PoF is delivered in one shot. As such, it can structure itself as one block with a beginning and an end and making the pace your own (you like The oasis ? You're gonna stick around and do all the map. You hate the desolation ? You rush throught it to get to the next point. You feel that right now, in the story, the end of the world is starting and you have to act ? You go directly to the next story point).
---
The extension being one block, the map are made so you have reasons to come back after unlocking new skills (mounts in PoF case and their masteries) or new knowledge (griffon achievements). Yet again it fells more polished.
---
The LSs are fragmented content. The entire story they tell is delivered in a very very long time frame. You're going to feel less attached to an event if it involves something that (IRL) occured 9 months ago (3 LS-episodes), if you remember it at all. 
---
LS are a marketing tool : they are meant to make the player base continue to play (and hopefully buy gems) and stick around (for the next expansion... when it was a thing). As such they have to all feel self contained, offer some cliffhanger to make sure you play the next one while making you feel gratified in some way (very few people would play something always making them feeling bad).
---
Being self contained, except the legendaries trinket, you cannot have content mixing two LS episodes. Because maybe people didn't unlock that one. And mixing goes both way. They cannot add in the first map of LS5 something related to the last map of LS5 right now because they don't know what it's going to be (mechanic-wise). Or if they know, trust me, it's gonna change because too much time will pass in between.
---
All in all, while LS was quite fun to have something to crunch between our thumbs in between extensions, they always were worse than the main content simply because they are/were designed to be fillers.
---
And what happen when there is no main content anymore and only filler left ? We'll see in 2020 :P
---
It’s not a roadmap.  Roadmaps go farther than a quarter.  Let’s stop calling it what it already isn’t.
---
I agree to a certain degree. Yes, rotations are imo harder than most mmo's. Esp these older style mmo's with classic casters(which got to stand still to cast) , melees and ranged, tanks, and healers.
---
There are mmo's with complexer mechanics (like eso and light attack weaving) but all in all it's a tid bit complexer. When it comes down to endgame content and it's complexity, it comes always down to just how good your groups dps is and whether you can skip mechanics with it,which is basically the way you try to play endgame.
---
In terms of gear it just abdicates on the gear spiral and endless farming for new better gear (just like eso). This makes it a bit beginner and casual friendly than other mmos.
---
In terms of pvp esp wvw it has huge potential even in its complexity, but the catering of anet is so bad, that the ppl who would've cared and played in a hardcore environment are gone or never even transitioned from gw1 to gw2.
---
What? Where did you get that idea from?
---
Haha! Jessica, you twit. You've had you're month of fame. I hope you enjoyed it 'cause I sure as hell didn't.
---
we already got 6 expansion like features and the season just started
---
I can't agree more, your comics are one of the last things that keep me checking this depressing subreddit.
---
I didnt logged-in for a long time, but I wanted to thank you.
---
What I meant was golem benchmark. It's not really reasonable to expect people to pull off benchmark on bosses. However, here you need to know your class and your rotation (like my example with dh combo I mentioned somewhere earlier) to be able to perform. This is why you get people who do 2k dmg, they are focusing on not dying.
---
I never said that I like gear treadmill. I do like it. But the lack of it makes the whole balance of the combat be shifted to mechanics and personal skill. Which is... let's say quite contradictory to the 'we welcome casuals' mentality. We don't welcome casuals, we ask them for 200kp because we are tired of shit players who can't push buttons and not die.
---
Like what? Strike missions are just repackaged, lower effort raids. We didn't get elite specs. Masteries are trash and don't really have any new concepts like gliding and mounts had.
---
It definitely has been building longer, but it really wasn’t until War Eternal that the community disappointment and apathy hit critical mass and spilled over.
---
And you still dont get why some ppl likes to beat records or do challenges
---
cook 500, dyable backpieces, many new hud options, strike missions, new masteries (doesnt mattter if you like them or not), build templates, "rework" of fall damage and ressurection. two new maps and well.. the season just started and im 100% satisfied right now
---
It mocks black people, innocent or not, and is a phrase that attempts to strip sympathy from black communities in the wake of tragedy. [Source Example.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/961/094/857.png).
---
This is absurd. GW2 story content &gt; GW1 story content.
---
GW1 PvE was roundly mocked for its melodrama, reliance on pop culture references (before they were called "memes"), and how downright simple the combat was. Build making was theoretically more complicated just based on the sheer number of interchangeable skills, but once you knew what skills to take and what enemies you would face (or you read up on them on a wiki), the nature of the hard-counter skill system meant that you could trivialize almost anything. "C-space" was a running joke for a reason. 
---
I distinctly remember the POX/ROX/NOX fights, one of the last pieces of content added to the game, and thinking "man, **this** is what boss battles should have always been like". Almost every story boss in GW2 has been as or more interesting in terms of mechanics as those fights were. Complain all you want about the drip feed of content, but what we have (and are continuing to receive; the latest LS update is no slouch in this regard) is unequivocally better than what we had in GW1. 
---
And if you're not talking story content, but rather raids or group content? Come on. GW1 had UW, FoW, DoA, Urgoz, and the Deep. That's it for high-end PvE content. Oh and people occasionally ran some of the EotN dungeons, but those were easy to just do with Heroes anyway. Which isn't to say the others couldn't be soloed, but they were harder to solo at least.
---
I almost never access the TP from the icon or Hotkey, so I never noticed. The truth is, they integrated the Gem Store with the exchange and TP, so the window has to open on one of those selections. I'm not saying it wasn't done to promote viewing of the Gem Store, but imagine if the Hero panel opened to the mount page instead of the Equipment page.
---
I found this hilarious tbh
---
Good representation of this subreddit.
---
New maps are just normal season content. Build templates, ill give you that but it's very meh. Masteries are normal season content, fall damage rework is nothing, cook 500 is barely useful, dyable backpieces are gemstore. Gemstore is not content.
---
&gt; I’d rather rewatch The Last Jedi
---
Seemed almost plausible until this.
---
Don't give them ideas.
---
If the tragedy is you getting shot in the middle of a strongarm robbery or while trying to kill someone, and your community tries to pretend you were innocent then you fully deserve to be mocked. Why should you be beyond reproach for a crime you obviously commited?

Yes, praise her indeed! 😄

I like this comic and it hits my view of this sub. The worst problem in my opinion, is that some ppl stopped playing this game, but still post toxic comments without knowing anything. 
---
Some friend of mine, for example, stopped playing after hot and still tells me that some classes are plain bad or unbalanced. 
---
I like this game and it's combat more then other mmos combat and thats why i still play since beta.  I know that some aspects of gw2 are bad and some content is just not for me. But ppl not playing and still posting shit just to get their "dead game" will always be a joke in my opinion.
---
Not my style but very well done Indeed
---
I'm always amazed when i see inventories like this. Mine are always so cluttered.
---
Wouldn't know where to put my stuff otherwise.
---
Ya I have a handful of Tomes I'll use. To be honest I forgot the inconvenience of having a new character with no WPs unlocked so your suggestion to just explore is probably best. I suppose I can just travel through the world towards the expansion zones and hopefully pick up my final levels in the process. Thanks!
---
I like shorts, they're comfy and easy to wear.
---
If i had to criticize the story of GW2 in absolute... well, it wouldn't be fun. You cannot compare a lightweight story video game to a real story or a heavy narrative game. Even worse when we're talking about a MMO (look, there is only one guy who can defeat they mighty powerful evil ! Oh wait, in fact we're thousands dragon killing machines fighting in Dragon's End every hour !)

However we can compare LS episodes to expansion story. And what you describe is, imo, a direct consequence of the fragmented way of telling the Living Story.
---
 * Each episode self contained --&gt; harder to build something coherent
---
 * Fragmented way of delivery --&gt; cannot write everything before hand and / or polish/correct it once all is written.
---
 * Has to keep every hyped --&gt; "we" (the commander) has to fight bigger fight with lesser and lesser odd to win.
---
&gt;boohoo move on he's satirizing people but how dare you attack him back
---
FTFY
---
I am a veteran
---
 I am ok with the state of the game and get lotof shit and downvoted from other posters (non players) for this.
---
Nothing wrong with that, at least you're consequent with your ideals. Acting &gt; Talking, always.
---
And even then, at least religious ones are polite and leave me alone when I tell them I'm not interested. Can't say the same about the other spectrum, hellbent on making every single thing a battlefield for their bullshit ideals.
---
&gt;alas, however, if they stay with the game they will *eventually and inevitably encounter the issues that only increase in number, 
---
If u keep on living eventually sooner or later you will die
---
And that's the reason why we have such a huge schizm between hc and casual players. 
---
Casuals are told it's a casual game, which they believe because of a video from 8 years ago.
---
We know it's either faceroll or impossible w/o practice. Despite a video that told us we can play the way we want.
---
Silly murican
---
BBT=Fake Nerds.
---
Can't make it through watching a full episode.
---
Most of the people, including myself, that "quit" the game still play an hour or 2 a week and follow the patches and releases.  When we were playing the game for 20+ hours a week and pointing out problems apparently we were jaded veterans.  Now that we have "joined the casuals" we still can't comment because we don't play enough?  This reddit is pathetic.
---
When you want PvP and WvW updates or new raids or new fractals or new specs or new races or anything but 1 hour of story, some collections and cash shop items then, yes, the game is dead for you.  If you enjoy the drip feed of "content" every few months and radio silence from Anet then sure the game is "alive."  The fact of the matter is though this game has less content releases and less communication than a game like HotS which is confirmed to be in maintenance mode.
---
ArenaNet is in maintenance mode.
---
I feel like there is another level to this: players get by 80% off the content unpunished without having any skill.
---
Remember how utterly harsh HoT maps were on release? They tuned difficulty up by 3 knots. Other games counter this with the next level of gear, gw2 players countered this by whining about being unable to play the game until HoT open world was nerfed to be doable by Bearbows. After that story I cannot really remember any challenging open world content tbh.
---
State of the game and its future is only in anet hand
---
 They could decide this to change into a cooking simulator cause they want to attract that target and it will be ok to them
---
In that case if u do not like u can leave
---
I understand where you're coming from, but the reason people shift from genuine criticism to straight up complaining is because they don't feel listened to. ArenaNet has never treated the community well. Other games have community managers that regularly interact with the community and talk about what's coming and collect feedback for the developers. ArenaNet just doesn't do that. Even when they had Gaile Gray, didn't do that. This is the result.
---
I dunno, doesn't seem like a [quote](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1000045432007938048) to me
---
Can I get a TLDR? Can anyone join this thing?
---
*Something something* Be the bigger person *something something*
---
As always don't blame the actual devs who are badly paid for the industry.
---
Point your blame and criticism to the bad upper management of anet, for how badly they handle the community, the marketing and their direction of not only the game itself, but also them as a company, burning a very big chunk of the income whe paid them for gw2 on side projects which all got canceled and wasted lots of money and dev time.
---
The balance lies in the middle. The problem with the gem store, aside from the abuse of it, is that it's too expensive. 10-25€ purchases aren't microtransactions, 0.50-2€ are, period.
---
They only cater to whales because they decided to. I'm sorry, but I ain't gonna spend that money on poor quality skins with zero emotional value which will become outdated in a few months anyway. I'd rather spend my money on steam key bundles, and buy whole games for the price of half a GW2 mount skin.
---
That's how it is, but ArenaNet, like with many other things, are completely stuck in the past, and can't see beyond their own noses.
---
And before you complain about real microtransactions not being profitable enough, I'd send you learn some basic economics, or you can just look at how filthy rich the games which have those have become.
---
I even vaguely remember Derior sounding so legitimately gutted on Twitch in one of the days following it. He was looking for genuine discussion and got lambasted instead.
---
Just... sad that someone can be so filled with hate.
---
Paying per patch could be a good alternative too. Spend 5 bucks every 3 months to unlock the new stuff, with no season passes involved, and you'd have a clean customer-friendly business model.
---
You know, like expansions packs 10 fucking years ago.
---
Even the road to GWAMM is worth it. Definitely more fun and rewarding than any goal in GW2.
---
You're entirely missing out that a large portion of combat in many other mmos is done using a much simpler mechanic for battle. You've got set rotations you can follow that don't generally require much effort to follow through with (macros even work sometimes in games like WoW if it's too simplified), dodging isn't required the vast majority of the time and many mechanics or attacks can be ignored or just healed through, comboing with other people or fields isn't a thing so you're not forced to remember what attack does what specifically and which other abilities it combines with to get your damage buffs. That's just naming a few. The combat is entirely different compared to most other popular mmos and requires some effort on the persons part, so gearing isn't really the ONLY thing that props numbers up closer. In FFXIV for example there are plenty of times I've seen people in gear that should make them do somewhere between 14-16k dps and yet they are doing 4k or less.
---
It's not a "lie" just because you don't agree with it. You can disagree that something is racist/sexist but that doesn't mean the other person is lying. They just have a different point of view.
---
&gt; giving them a louder voice with which to be a nuisance with
---
Oh no, how dare they give minorities a louder voice, those nuisances! Oh get over it. I for one am happy that women and minority gamers are finally getting some ability to speak out without being ignored so easily.
---
Honestly, you just sound like [this dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy5rz1cft5w) to me.
---
Well, it could be worse. I mean, look at Star Wars fans.
---
Nowadays you can't stay with a single franchise forever. It will eventually die a slow agonizing death.
---
Meanwhile ESO is a big turn off because... of the exact same reason you think would be a good alternative.
---
&gt;season 1 was a narrative masterwork
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
I count 3. Including as fails waiting for snowballs instead of dodging through them, and the last presents before the chest.
---
I sense strong magic
---
They usually run it long enough to get a small, extremely loyal following, *then* yank the rug.
---
This is how I changed the script.  https://imgur.com/5fOZn2T 
---
When I use F1-4 it works. For F5 instead of pressing T (which my heal is bound to) it does nothing. For F6-F8 instead of using my utilities they all open the map even though my "open map" is only bound to "m". Any idea what's going on?
---
zia is my fav and kudos that there are still guilds out there, which are not dead yet with how badly anet handles guilds and communities
---
Projecting your obviously despised strawman figure onto me. Like you just did, again. 
---
&gt;Oh, look, Paw Patrol and Thomas the Tank Engine are fascist cartoons! That's an actual media headline.
---
I never stated near anywhere that I support that message or article,   
---
but you havent even read anything besides it's headline,   
---
maybe even just headlines talking about it's headline. So I guess thats not surprising. 
---
&gt;Most games have zero politics, 
---
Nice examples. \*Many \*(exclusively competitive) games have \*(not much) politics, and even fucking League of Legends has multiple political dilemmas and discussions embedded right into their lore.   
---
Activision claims they have no politics in their game, so their demon of a CEO can go around without answering to the planned out political outrage they face every year, while obviously gaining from it. 
---
&gt;and in fact, whenever "moral" situations arise, you can choose what to do (and most of the time it has no impact anyway).
---
Thats neither true nor accurate, even for RPGs where moral decisions are part of the game.   
---
Actually, when major decisions in an RPG have no consequences thats called bad game design, unless its the wirters intent to show f.e. the player being powerless.   
---
As much as AAA CEOs want to stay out of politics, you simply cant engagingly portray large scale conflict without having at least some form of political debate. 
---
&gt;And no, staying away from a game or a topic is not a statement. Lack of participation is not a form of participation. 
---
I didnt say that, and public, or even private, boycott is something very different than just staying away from something. 
---
&gt;Seeing politics in everything is no different than seeing the face of Jesus on your breakfast toast.
---
Thats barely even a comparison.   
---
I never even said ALL games are political - it's relatively easy avoiding political debate if you completely focus on interpersonal, or intrapersonal conflict like f.e. "GRIS". 
---
However, if your toaster happens to print fucking Jesus on every toast,   
---
there's Jesus on every goddamn toast wether you like it or not.
---
As always don't blame the actual devs who are badly paid in the industry and often work hard (many of the good ones moved to amazon and co tho).
---
Point your blame and criticism to the bad upper management of anet, for how badly they handle the community, the marketing and their direction of not only the game itself, but also them as a company, also burning a very big chunk of the income we paid them for gw2 on side projects which all got canceled and wasted lots of money and dev time.
---
Just imagine, for example, where we could have been if they never would have invested years of resources for the Chinese client, which still struggles to even make profit.
---
Anet is famous for delivering "new" stuff while abandoning old stuff. Instead of improving old stuff to new standards, they just ignore it. That's quite sad. Guild missions could have benefit a lot from Bounties, Dungeons could have benefit a lot from strike missions, etc.
---
That's why I don't.
---
It'll use the already existing teleport to friend UI.
---
America obsession for this show that is literally garbage is something the likes of me will never understand.
---
What's not true? That she left on her own or that she hurt the game's pr? 
---
Gaile avoided any kind of meaningful interaction with the community like the plague. A community manager is expected to both have fun/interact with the fans AND address positive/negative feedback. I can't think of a single instance where she had a hard conversation with us.
---
If you want to see community management done well, check out Rebecca Ford at Digital Extremes (Warframe). Near constant communication/conversations with the community, is without a doubt a driving force for Warframe's success.
---
They did have a lot more time to expand on the dwarves and Lazarus/white mantle though. She showed up and was there for... 2 episodes? I may be mistaken on that but it's been a really long time since I last played through LS3.
---
Totally and completely untrue. This sub has been weirdly negative for awhile. This is a positive thing and people are so cynical.
---
Tankies and genocide denial, name a more iconic duo.
---
&gt; I was wondering what a current gen Mesmer solo build would look like.
---
[This](http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Power_DPS) is pretty decent - or something like it. I tend to use two wells and I prefer shield to focus for the double stun, but it's a pretty good template to follow. 
---
Basic playstyle is to do burst damage with illusions and shatters then go into melee and smash things recharge. It's pretty sturdy and pretty fun and as long as you press the phantasm buttons when they cool down, you can pretty much play as a swash-buckling swordfighter type.
---
Right? All I did was post something I found interesting that I saw related to gw2 and now it seems as though what I watch is on trial to be judged as to why I would do such a thing as watch big bang theory???
---
I’ll never forget when Mike Z said that the studio was going to focus on “horizontal development”. I can only interpret that to mean that rather build on existing features to make them great, they will serially launch new unfinished features and abandon all of them just the same as everything else. GW2 needs vertical development.
---
This is how I feel right now. I play everyday for dailies and then I see if I want to play more, but sadly every decision Arenanets management does only makes me play less. I want content that keeps me playing, not only 2 hours of story and some achievements.
---
Part of the problem, though, is that you don't get to be the judge of how important different aspects of the game are to different people. What is a huge issue to others may not even matter to you, but that doesn't make them wrong. You may think the community is overreacting to things, but the scale of outrage is decided by each individual person, not by you. Right now, people are probably bandwagoning onto issues more than they really should, but that's because ArenaNet literally doesn't have a community team to manage the situation. People are a LOT more willing to overlook mistakes if they have a reason to give the company good will. Not only has ArenaNet not given that reason, they've actively taken advantage of the good will people gave them in the past.
---
I just tested your script with your keybinds and I don't know why your F5 isn't outputting T but to fix your numpad keys you need to encase them in { } like this {Numpad7}. Without the brackets it's trying to literally type out "Numpad7" in chat and the first possibly key press the game registers without the chatbox opens is m for the map haha.
---
Though since you haven't got your F keys bound to anything I suggest using [Solemba's solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eftpuf/for_those_who_are_struggling_with_the_choir_bell/fc2f7g3/) and to simply use your F keys as secondary binds for your weapon and utility skills. Functions the same but you won't have to fiddle with the AHK script.
---
&gt;I am a veteran I am ok with
---
&lt;5hrs of new content every 2 months supplemented by repeated holiday content. OK noted thanks
---
Idk, maybe 16-20 hours before hand. I didn't mean to play as much as I did and just wanted to get a feel for what he was struggling with. 2 hours flew by like they were nothing though.
---
&gt; At this point it's like some just really, genuinely WANT Guild Wars 2 to crash and burn, entirely so they can pat themselves in the back because they "saw it coming"
---
I can assure you that it is a thing on this subreddit, unfortunately, but moderating team doesn't have tools/don't want to deal with that.
---
That's a nice idea, but I'd not "rather" have it. Knowing anet and they UI, it'd take a loooong time.
---
Better implement OP's suggestion (right click) or LS-like tome asap : there is a chance that it can be done with not much work, using same tech we already have for LS scroll books. And THEN implement your suggestion. I don't want to wait unnecessarily long time for a "big" thing like a teleport panel, unless we get the simple version while waiting.
---
So you're saying it is preferential? But the leveling experience is nothing like the endgame, so if they give up on the game just because leveling isn't a roller coaster ride, won't they be missing out?
---
&gt; I check this reddit every day and any genuine complaint or criticism of the game or the dev's actions is dwarfed by the utter maelstrom of simple spite
---
People have been providing constructive criticism for about 5-6 years. 
---
Anet ignored almost everything, and the majority of the community was downvoting any legitimate criticism and even feedback, because suggestions implied GW2 wasn't perfect and we can't have that here.
---
People don't bother anymore. Suggestions are pointless, and Anet has created a mess from which the game can't recover. So now most people are just dissing Anet for good reason.
---
&gt;GuildWars had one thing in common with current gw2: Anet didn’t look back at old content. So with all their balance updates they made pve easier and easier because with skill reworks they took away most of the synergy that mob builds had. 
---
That's utterly ridiculous. Mobs barely ever had synergy at all, and that wasn't because of skill updates but because they were designed that way. Hell, most mobs were working with 1-3 skills total plus a weak autoattack. What build synergy? 
---
Elite area mobs and EotN mobs frequently **were** designed with skill synergy (remember the update specifically designed to fight Shadow Form in UW?) both in their own build and within mobs in the same groups. Doesn't mean the fights were appreciably difficult for well built teams.
---
Literally talking about female gates. Is you preclassified female gate not in fact female?
---
better than double the content every 4 which you will burn in 2 weeks anyway. 
---
not to mention this way new player can reach what we veteran achieved. do you know how many new players are there ? which maps they are playing ? no. you don't. they do.
---
With the right textures and dyes that'd be dope :P
---
&gt; We all know that they will fuck alliances up
---
Optimistic of you to think it will actually happen. 
---
Alliances have been talked about for around 3 years. I easily spent 90% of my my time in GW2 playing WvW. Lost interest sometime in 2015, waited around a bit for things to happen. Haven’t logged on since Sept 2017.
---
The game may be fantastic in your eyes, but majority of gamers think otherwise.  There's no update ANet could release that would revive this game.  It's boring from a core standpoint because it's so basic.  I think the game would've been wildly more successful if it was a true successor to GW1.
---
u are. your metaphor was terrible . you have a terrible idea of what your government do . no decision is arbitrary nor the government should care of its reputation .
---
and if u consider anet as the government the only income is not from taxes since we have no monthly fee but from what u decide to buy from the tp which, let's remember totally only aestetic and not p2w.
---
oh moreover if there iw no reason to open a new position government could suggest (not decide since it's not a dictatorship) to employ new one since they would be useless (but god know what the fuck did u meant with that).
---
oh silly muricans.
---
anyway how long since you last logged in in game ? weeks ? months ? years? let me have fun plz
---
Me?
---
I love the "Acquired In-game" category.
---
There are enough buffoons who actually spread such crap and think it's true. 
---
Should have added more WhiteKnight Blueberry sauce.
---
While it's true endgame is not exploration based, the concept of map completion is not too different from what we do with achievements for skins/AP. Also whenever they add new content what we get is pretty close to the leveling experience, a new map to explore, more map completion, more story, a new list of goals you can choose to do. If someone dislikes gw2 leveling enough to not continue they probably won't enjoy what the game offers every new patch.
---
Raids and fractals are the exception gameplay wise, but I don't think either of them can really hold a player here (considering how little both contents are supported)
---
Kas had a whole faith questioning thread in pof that jory was ya involved in. They only just returned in s5 and both started doing separate mesmer and detective things. Jory had a moment in the most recent story where she got Belinda flashbacks because of Jornag spoopy magic. 
---
It’s not brilliant story telling by any means but no, they aren’t ambient mobs or gay tokens.
---
Depends on how it’s feeling
---
This made me 😅 
---
They have a dozen people working on the story? Good thing I don't play for the plot because my 2 yr old niece could come up with better story with a box of crayons.
---
1 to 25 in 20 hours is fairly realistic
---
Dunno if this one helps. :)

---
We been knew.
---
In the last years three friends I made in other games tried GW2, after they noticed I play it alot. 
---
They all quit between level 13 and 25. The gaps between the story are just horrendous. Any other MMO keeps you entertained by some kind of Area storyline, or just by the main story tasks you fill with quests on the way.
---
In GW2 the most efficient way, basically the only one if you dont want to stretch it over months, to level is running in circles until you are done doing so just to do it another three times until you reached the next main quest. It has nothing to do with an MMO experience. I mean, the first Dungeon you can join and play with your friend IS AT LEVEL 30. It is ridiculous.
---
It's a [repost](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eclr86/thought_you_guys_might_find_this_interesting/) from a week ago.

(And last time it turned into a huge shit-flinging contest.)

Yeah, been a couple of years since we knew.

---
&gt; cook 500
---
Ascended crafting for Weaponsmith, Armorsmith, Tailoring, Artificer, Huntsman, and Leatherworker all came outside of expansions.
---
&gt; many new hud options
---
ANet has updated the HUD outside of expansions as well.  DPI scaling from two years ago, the new Hero panel, the new Black Lion Trading Post menu, the new transmute menu, etc.
---
&gt; "rework" of fall damage and ressurection
---
This is literally just a re-balance of existing traits.  This is no different than claiming the quarterly balance patches as expansion-level content.
---
&gt; new masteries (doesnt mattter if you like them or not)
---
Well, if we consider these expansion level content; They were introduced with an expansion, but were given retroactive use from season 2 and the core story and have become a feature that's expected within living world updates.
---
&gt; two new maps and well
---
Season 2, season 3, and season 4 all had new maps.  Season 2 was before expansions.
---
Now if ANet actually came out with what features that should be expected or what they consider "expansion level" instead of just using that buzzword to generate hype, ( Detailing things like New maps, new masteries, possibly new elite specializations, raids/fractals, maps). They'd likely have less sarcastic cynicism all over Reddit atm.  Right now, this saga just comes off as more of the same from PoF and Season 3.
---
I'm on NSP, signed in to do my WvW dailies since limited time on Christmas and laughed at the number of people that were playing. It's a day for family and fun not grinding WvW. Lol. I still flipped some AR camps on their home bl just for the laughs and to know someone would have to go unflip them.
---
Pretty on point, unlike most games where you level by rushing to the next exclamation point guild wars 2 is all about seeing everything the current map you are on has to offer.
---
You should be doing hearts, vistas, poi's, way points and whatever event happens to be close to you.
---
Do that along with story progression and you level up very fast in this game.
---
To combine with what others have said if for whatever reason exploration is not "your thing" most of guild wars 2 is going to be rough. I prefer gw2 style as many MMOs I have played felt stale of the same with the constant A-B traveling.....booooorrrrrring!
---
Fair enough, but it is still awfully convenient for them to fall back on the fact that PvP doesn't need gear.
---
Was gonna point out that the Skyscale was missing from Luminous, but you beat me to it lol
---
Gear treadmill exists only for chronos. 
---
The power dps is always zerk+scholar, support is always harrier, condi might have to change one or two pieces.
---
Gw2 is not a social game.   
---
It is not single player, however. I was able to get gwamm on my own with the exception of having someone terra uw for me. And I've done it after gw2 came out, so I did it in a game ridden with both and rmt. In gw2 i'd have no chance to do stuff like that.
---
assuming they enjoy PvP or similarly WvW...
---
Seriously. I wasn't a Reddit lurker back in the days of season one but I do remember all of the map chat absolutely hating it. None of us knew what the hell was going on at the time and just wanted an expansion or something. Every single one of my friends that I knew from other MMOs quit during season 1. I'll never forget how much everyone hated Scarlet, but we were excited to see a new fractal after the politics thing and just how disappointed the whole community was when LO AND BEHOLD, SCARLET IS BEHIND THIS TOO???

It is 15% starting from lv5 via the Halloween food and there are plenty of cheap utility consumables as well so that is +25% total ... from kills.
---
Let's see... botched Templates, WvW falling into pieces, brief Living Story chapters being considered content, and really nothing in the future.

Did they do anything right? You know it's sad when the biggest note of the year is .... Siren's Reef. Yikes.

Right, I'll tell my friends about this and they'll definitely flock to this game.

OP I want to genuinely ask you, are you satisfied with game's current state and do you genuinely believe that the development speed and content delivery for the endgame stuff is ok?
---
And my other point being, I was afraid of the subscription model because I didn't want to spend too much money.
---
However the money I spent on games like Hearthstone, Overwatch, and GW2 far exceeds what I've paid in FFXIV. And for much better game play and more content released.
---
It's easier for the devs to budget and make consistent money off subscription. And for me personally, when the game is so satisfying and there's so many things for me to unlock in game (and not via a cash shop) it turns out I spend way less money overall. Even if I'm paying $15 a month.
---
At a subscription rate you would've broken even with your $400 spent in one year but not spending anymore after that until now. Lol.
---
Except the game wouldn't be funneling resources into a cash shop.
---
And this, everybody, is how we can get out-of-college graduates to work for peanuts, cause it's such a wonderful "opportunity", it's the best you can do to your career, and I'm sure your next employer will totally appreciate this mentorship. (/s btw)

Severely mentally ill people really shouldn't have access to a keyboard on the internet.
---
I think thats most new players try to go for 100% map and that is totally not exp worth nor is it fun, you lose hours looking for PI and doing really annoying chores you could skip and keep leveling. As a guild master for years I've helped a lot of new players and they always were more inclined to complete every map until I tell them that they didn't have to at the start and could just explore and keep going doing only the hearts they think it will be fun.
---
If you think the comment is about the state of the game, you missed the point of the comment.
---
Spoiler: It's about the state of the subreddit community.
---
I'm sure NCSoft as a company have more information about the profits made through microtransactions than you could ever muster. They know what models work best and are just playing their cards right.

If you insist on defending criminals and those who protect them then I doubt you could have said anything of value in the first place.

And then the fractal turned out to be asuran failed experiment #90213874219037123 instead of the much cooler and actually interesting abbadon fractal thanks to their retarded voting system between the 2 fractals. Of course everyone chose to vote for the fractal that reduced waypoint cost or whatever it was. S1 was fucking fail I actually quit because of that for a long time, this game went sooooooooooooooooo long without any content and everyone just begging for an expac.
---
Pfft. I just click my skillbar like a pro
---
It was more the PAX announcement that led to perpetual overflowing hate for the game. There was still some hope in the buildup for that.
---
Though I feel like it's been in existence since the so-called "content drought" preceding HoT.
---
Week 3 is the rando asshat portion. Don't wanna miss that.
---
I don't know that I've seen that event chain bugged.  It is a decently-long event chain, though, and so it might be at a different part.  It's often stuck at "Defeat the Clanmarshal and Vizier", for example, the final event in the chain that requires a few more players than the earlier ones, so oftentimes it will get to that event and then people give up on it, leaving it there.
---
If you go and complete that event (with friends), it'll reset to the beginning after a while and you can get the event you're needing from the middle.
---
You're really completely misconstruing everything I'm saying. You sound just like a Kotaku article.

&gt; i have a GW related tattoo,

jesus christ. aghahahahhahahaha

even more jesus christ ahahahahahahahahaha

&gt;is that enough fun for you?
---
oh yes.more than i could ever dream
---
reallly but even if u are frustrated anet own nothing to you.
---
&gt;now kindly stop wasting my time.

sure.  i understand the reason u are so angry.  you invested too much time in game and now you realize everything has a end. even a franchise u loved. i'm really sorry.

People craft 32 slot bags
---
what are you talking about?
---
Oh, so you're working in the video game industry and hire fanfic writers? I could send you a few people who would be interested!
---
&gt; when I was doing the lv60 key run 
---
What's this?
---
I have thousands and thousands of tomes and birthday scrolls I'd like to cash in.
---
People keep on saying they are providing constructive criticism, yet the sub's frontpage is clogged with low effort shitty memes with hundreds of upvotes.
---
And we wonder why this sub is misrepresented. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
If people really don't want their valid feedback to be drowned in a sea of toxic negativity, may be they can start by disputing those threads with the same enthusiasm they have here.
---

---
No no, you got it wrong, I meant that in my industry we also have people like you who think crappy internships are the way to get ahead.
---
Fuck me, I'd rather have my balls cut off and stuck in my arse than working in the game industry.
---
The only way they keep that promise is if they add new elite specialisations and the weapon collections that go with it.
---
you can't sell that!

Why would one buy 20 slot bags for gold? They are free on Halloween
---
i mean... those that don't have any of the bag crafting professions leveled and don't look up recipes might or other bag option might, and there surely are quite a few of those. curious why you're asking now.
---
I mean. We have to wait and see. Maybe the new map is going to be really cool. Maybe there's unannouncecd features.
---
Q1 isn't what I've ever been concerned with. It's Q2 I'm worried about.
---
I mean business, buddy
---
And knowing is half the battle.
---
500 Gems in BL
---
If only we had something in the sidebar telling you not to make posts like this.
---
There is no business in crafting bags
---
nobody makes bags for profit, i can get as many 20 slot 3 silver bags as i want from fractals.
---
well, I have noticed that you get about 1.8 gold from a box as profit and am also broke, so trying to figure something out.
---
&gt; Sympathy and reading comprehension are in such short supply these days.
---
Self awareness and irony even more so.
---
use 20's as they are cheap, when you can afford to make 28's do it. 32 are just too expensive. IMHO.
---
Apart from the streaming part, this is me. I have spent an insane amount of hours in this game and I have loved it to death. 
---
I stopped playing a few months ago and haven’t looked back. The “amazing” build template system was the last drop for me. The game have so much ambition, but have failed to deliver on so many things. 
---
It is pretty obvious by now that the game has been put on life support and is getting milked through the gem store. It pisses me off, because the game could have been so much if it had a studio behind it who actually cared :/
---
On the default new reddit design, there is no sidebar

Eve from Guild Wars 1 is also found in the comic book store as well.  Someone on the show must like the franchise :D

My post boils down to "If it happened outside of expansions during season 1, 2, or appeared during a season between expansions, it's not expansion level."  ANet hasn't defined what they consider to be expansion level.
---
&gt; However, the entire point of Living World seasons is to give expansion content outside of expansions, both before and with Season 5.
---
Which, when coming down to it, they haven't really had much success in that regard.
---
that's what you took from that? jeez, need a hug buddy?
---
and just for the record, i'm not angry, i'm frustrated.
---
&gt; anet own nothing to you.
---
true to a degree, but they are also wasting a lot of potential, severely harming their own reputation in the process at this point, and that is just sad and will eventually affect all active players and fans. not even a fan like you can deny that to themselves at this point, unless you understand even less than i assume about the situation we're in.
---
I buy Fractal equipment boxes
---
Your Sacrifice is commended. thank you for your service
---
The entertainment industry is a whole lot different than most others. It's much more fickle, much more temporary. You want to write for a video game company? Cool! Go for it!
---
But be ready for the reality that the development cycle moves a lot slower than your writing cycle and your role will be superfluous quickly. You'll either have to find another project to work on in the mean time or take on other roles within the company/studio/garage making the game. Be ready for the fact that your favorite game's developers might not have the budget to hire a writer, or that the AAA studio that does also has thousands of other applicants and are more likely to pick the ones with experience in the industry already for a lateral move. Be ready for the reality that if you want to create your own game you're going to have to take the risk of a full time investment to learn how to code and/or find the means to developing the game beyond the idea stage.
---
For a games-as-a-service like GW2 or MMOs in general, sometimes you can find safety in the ongoing nature of the game. In a AAA studio you can move between projects as necessary. But ultimately your job starts and ends a lot sooner than the development cycle.
---
It's not just like the for video games. TV/Movies are similar. Hell, even for writing a book you could probably finish writing the book faster than you can find a publisher who would take it. In all forms of entertainment though, there is a huge risk cost for the time you put in not being rewarded. Video games and movies can cost millions to make, but if they flop then there's no payout for what you invested. It's risky to start up a studio with all new bloods and very few lenders or investors are willing to help out in those situations. That's how it becomes so insular, and that's why one of the goals of this program is to encourage newcomers to join in a more constructive environment.
---
Maybe the field you work in is different and is far more welcoming to newcomers, maybe you find security in the ball-cutting-and-arse-sticking business, but that's not what it's like for a writer in video games.
---
&gt; May be Eureka isn't useless and they didn't nerfed it to the ground in 5.1 so you could destroy it solo just for the sake of glamours? 
---
I mean that was pretty much the whole reason people did it in the first place? It's all for glamour and looking good. It's the same as GW2 where you wanna dress up. And it's a godsent they nerfed it. It's actually very active these days because you don't need massive trains to do things. The final part of Eureka also features an awesome raid.
---
&gt; May be there is some content that isn't instanced and actually requires coordination and other people, other than hunts? 
---
You're saying that as if 'instanced' is some magical form of criticism that is a negative right away and invalidates content. Like you can't come up with any legitimate criticism other than it being instanced. There's certainly pros and cons to both instanced and open world but FFXIV's instanced content is like 100x more complex than anything you would get with your proto-typical 'open-world' style encounter.
---
&gt; May be the encounter design is inventive and interesting and not copy-pasted avoiding circles/beams dance dance revolution minigame with like a couple of dungeons where you shoot adds with a cannon? 
---
I mean yeah you clearly have either watched a video or read a description about FFXIV or have never even gotten past level 50 in the game. The game has some extremely innovative design. The latest ultimate fight (hardest encounters in the game) has one of the most innovative 'time' themed mechanics from any game I've played. 
---
&gt; May be the story isn't an awkward, badly written and badly voiced (when it's even voiced) cringefest where the main heroes kill the main antagonist with a power of friendship and surprise soul linking? 
---
The game is critically acclaimed, has 91 on metacritic, the writer got a standing ovation at PAX for her work, and three of the VAs are Game of Thrones actors. You're entitled to your opinion but I think the vast majority of people would agree that you are wrong. 
---
Also as a tip, people are more likely to take you seriously when you don't sound like you are sperging out about the game like it physically hurt you. Like, take a step back man. It's just a game lol. You sound like you are about to get violent.
---
The main focus of GW2, whether you like it or not, is living story. So considering Anet is actively developing and pushing living story, we can't really say it's in maintenance mode.
---
there should be
---
A lot of those features I've listed were released before expansions.  To then follow up and claim that they're exclusive to expansions does it no justice.  See, when saying "expansion level features" people are going to expect things that are exclusive to expansions; however, a lot of what's coming in this saga aren't things.
---
&gt; So,even if we would get 5 new mounts,
---
Never said that.  Mounts were introduced with PoF and expanded upon in the LW season 4.
---
&gt; 10 new maps
---
 To me, the only maps that felt like expansion level was season 2's due to how it progressed week by week, a couple of maps from season 3 due to collections and other little quests being tied to lore, and some of season 4's as they had actual story progression outside the couple hours of actually following the green star.  The rest were one-off stories with disjointed collections that don't really expand on the lore of the realm as much as they just serve to progress the plot with the Destiny's Edge 2, and the maps are smaller than the maps that actually came with the expansions.  I think we're getting less maps anyways, which is good as that means ANet can actually focus on developing a big, single map that could fit snuggly in with and compete with the actual expac maps. 
---
&gt; 10 new legendarys
---
They already said these weren't coming, however, these are expansion level as they came with HoT.  The cadence was just with each living world release.  These were hard-line intended to be released with Heart of Thorns but development issues lead to them being released over the course of season 3 and four.
---
&gt; all crafting professions up to 600
---
Not only would this be useless, but anything they release to coincide with this would be against the horizontal progression they have.  And yes, this isn't expansion worthy; Ascended crafting isn't an expansion feature.
---
&gt; new raids/fractals
---
Raids I'd say are, especially if it's got a contained story like the first four that relates back to the story from season 3 or the following four that relates to the story of the expansion.  Fractals, I'd debate that they're not as they were part of the living world from back in the day.
---
&gt;  you would simply say, we got all that stuff in ls4, so its not expansion level?
---
As long as ANet hasn't defined what 'expansion level' is, we're to take it to the logical conclusion that anything that was purely introduced within an expansion is to be considered 'expansion level'.  Anything outside of that is conjecture.
---
Yes! And not splatting on the pavement below is the other half.
---
Incorrect. https://i.imgur.com/Cs17Nj4.png
---
The ending did feel a bit like *the* ending now that I think about it. Jormag and Primordus sleeping, Kralk dead and being kinda a tragic character and Aurene ascended to Elder Dragon-hood... it was perfect in a way.
---
Maybe they would've been better off, ending kinda in a high note. The reputation was not good at that point I think but I feel it only got worse since. I begin to have trouble justifying having the game installed to log in once new episode is live. I'd still mourn the game but I also feel like it is dead to me already, which is incredibly sad.
---
I've never played WoW, but I feel like them focusing on Instanced content rather than open world content also brings a lot to the "how do you handle developping a whole game for different types of players". 
---
PvE wise, WoW seems to focus on dungeons/raids with open world as a thing that has to be there with quests and all, but instances are the main thing. So devs focus on putting different difficulties in their main content, and everyone will be lead towards those instances and will be able to do them because they were designed for this purpose. And find difficulty in them if they want to because they are the center of the devs focus. (This is my own view of how things are done in WoW, but since I haven't played it I may be completely wrong, feel free to tell me if I am).
---
On the other side, Anet is mostly focused on Open World with events and all. So they really polish and create things to support the Open World side. Story is part of this, new materials every map with achievements, collections and everything. And then instances other than story somehow have to be there because that's what other MMOs do and what people like. So first we had dungeons at the very beginning. Then fractals. Then raids. Now Strike Missions (I wouldn't be surprised if Strike Missions were to be the next thing to be abandonned). Maybe the next instance concept is the Visions of the Past, if it doesn't fall in the "Story only instance" category. Now Anet can't put additional difficulties in Open World, it's against the concept. And they aren't focused on instanced content so they can't/won't add additional difficulties there. They either don't care, or just won't because their team is too focused on Story/Open World.
---
The solution, to satisfy a lot of people, would be to put different difficulties for Story because it's part of the main focus from Anet. But for that, the story instances would have to look more like dungeons, or have the "walking sim" part skippable, and each instance should have at least an good encounter. Which is basically what a Strike Mission is (but hey, still no CM in strikes for now).
---
Yeah because the thought 'GW2 is really disappointing right now' is something held by only one person. Nah they are just saying what we're all thinking.
---
Yep. I'll never understand how people look back at this with rose-tinted glasses. I wonder how many of them never even played it but say that it was the best time for this game.
---
Yes, there are folks buying 20 and 18 slot bags. It also wouldn't surprise me to see folks selling those bags for less than the cost of crafting them. There are also so many alternate methods to get bags outside of the trading post or crafting them. If you want to earn a profit off the TP, 20 and 18 slot bags don't seem like a good idea.
---
Bro, the combined cost of cobs is more than the average price of the cheapest 20 slot bag.
---
Use gw2efficiency's crafting calculator, so you know when crafting is worthwhile vs just selling the raw mats.
---
If you know how to level in Guild Wars 2, you can get a level every 5-10 minutes.  Not sure why more people don't know this. I've showed countless new players how to level faster, using buffs and bonus experience on kills.  And yeah, do some events on the way if they're fast ones, but just keep going and killing stuff with high bonus experience. 
---
If you think 10 minutes a level even with minimal buffs is too slow, not sure what to tell you.
---
But the people at Bethesda are still cool, I mean, it's a nice change of pace to jump from reading news about politics to news about their fuckups
---
Why does it matter what they leave around when the whole show is pretty trash to begin with.
---
I up voted jak cause I get his point, but this made me laugh so hard I cried.
---
&gt; In GW2 the most efficient way, ..., to level is running in circles 
---
What? Are we playing the same game?
---
And that half, and that half, and oh! That half over there!
---
I was looking for this comment. Wise man.
---
&gt; At a subscription rate you would've broken even with your $400 spent in one year but not spending anymore after that until now.
---
I used to play a sub-based game for 4 years. It was genuinely awful knowing that my paid time is wasted if I'm away for some reason. I felt chained and forced to play even if I wanted to do something else. Argue however you want, sub model is outdated and unkind.
---
But Seasons 1 and 2 were also "delivers expansion content without an expansion" like Season 5 so its still exactly as I said.
---
You're complaining that they're giving content expected of an expansion outside of an expansion when they said they'll provide content expected of an expansion outside of an expansion.
---
Just think. What did HoT and PoF both provide?
---
* Masteries
---
* New maps
---
* A full story
---
* New enemy types
---
* Elite Specializations
---
* A new coat of paint on old content types (bounties, Stronghold, etc.)
---
Expansions did *not* introduce raids, btw. They came after HoT over time. Legendary gear too.
---
So what do Living World Seasons provide since S1?
---
* Masteries (since S3)
---
* A full story per season
---
* A new coat of paint on old content (fractals, strikes, expanded crafting, etc.)
---
If you say they don't provide expansion like content, tell me, what **is** expansion like content? Because as I see it, the only thing lacking is elite specializations. And while I'd like to see more elite specializations, as you said, ANet never defined "expansion like content" thus need not include everything of expansions.
---
Thanks! \*salutes with remaining unbroken arm\*
---
what is a potential ? what do you know about which was what they wanted to do with the game ? 
---
what do you know about how much they are earning ? nothing
---
reputation ? m8 if even blizzard and bioware and lioned and bethesda (should i add more ? ) fucked up their reputation do you think anet would be differnt ? really ? do you think they should care about harming a reputation ? vg studios rise and die . ppl move from one to another. if a studio change all its members, is it the same studio ? do the reputation earned count ? 
---
sigh. so naive from you. not just you byut you all in this stupid toxic subreddit where everyone think anet owns them something.
---
it's a customer vendor relation. they sell something. you decide to buy. if selling is no more convenient for them and they must change target they do.  it doesn't matter how much time did u invested. if u are not profitable u are not important. 
---
is this clear to you ? ar are really looking trough pink glasses ?
---
now
---
game situation is not the one of a fast growing game but it is doing well. you should understand  mmo as a genre is dead. as a whole. maybe with vr something will change but mmo are no more a aaa type of game like 20 years ago when there were 3 new mmo a month and studios could try differnt stange options .
---
wow players and ff14 players are mostly ppl who spent so many hours in game and spent so much that they would not admit it and would still stand there whatever wopuld happen. jesus i know ppl who paid for a year wow sub even if they did not played anymore.
---
i am not a fan, just a consumer. i could not care less about gw2 destiny. it's a game like another. among the ones free is one of the best with huge maps and i like the style.
---
if elder scroll online would have started as free and started before gw2 when i left wow maybe i would have been playing that.
---
i left wow since i needed some less time consuming. what were you looking for in gw2? whatever you saw in it you got it wrong. the game is exactly was it was supposed to be from the beginning .
---
you see a kind of potential which is not here , never was. BUT it is a wonderful , amazing, excvellent single player game with a online component . that's all. i chose it for this and here it is exactly like i expected. and in this it is reaching it's full potential (plz add the stupid bots to fill a party for dungeon and raids and let us play and it would be PERFECT)
---
you say i am a delusional fan... which si this terrible situation you think the game is in ? 
---
gw2 can't compete with wow nor eso or ff14. it chose a different path. genius move. found a niche and excvellend in it.
---
it is SO MUCH FUN to see you all crying at a doomed game but everything has a end. is manteinance mode what u fear? is really that bad  ? once the game is stable and has enough to do is it really that bad ? and anyway we are far from that. 
---
on no , the tp is stealing our money!!! you can play without spending a single € on tp and still you should to let them maintain the server. 
---
when this will be cancelled who cares we all move to next one and everything will start again.
---
is this your first mmo ?  hope no
---
then just relax. your frustration is wasted here. relax and just play or move next  game
---
&gt;I've played off and on since the start of the game
---
cool story bro
---
I miss DAoC also!! Best RvR ever.  However, this was a great video.  Looked like some amazing good fights.  Great clips and awesome music.  Loved it.
---
&gt; Maybe there's unannouncecd features.
---
They outright stated they're not announcing everything due in Q1. For "surprise".
---
They said expansion level features would come with icebrood correct but not when in icebrood is that a problem yes but seeing as we are only starting the saga I'm giving it more time and will assess at the end like I did with living world and expansions,
---
I have a very similar machine setup as yours. In the short run, if you haven't done so already, do yourself a favor and move your whole gw2 folder to your ssd. Yes, just cut and paste. You'll need to reset a few things, but loading screen times drop immensely. Lions arch went from approx 60 secs down to 10.
---
Since Bjora was released loading screen times soared, and my game locks when exiting. Spaghetti code problems resurface evey time they update it seems
---
The totems of Jormag are made by Jormag's minions, which includes both Svanir and Icebrood (and now also Fallen and Aberrants).
---
The Svanir are claiming all the time that Dragon gave them power, and based on personal story, that doesn't mean just stats, but new abilities like summoning gigantic ice elementals or trapping a Havroun with an ice spike to hijack the powers to go into the mists.  
---
There's also grawl and jotun that appear to have them even without any sign of svanir involvement, which points towards Jormag teaching more than one race to make them.  
---
So it's perfectly within the realm of possibility that Icebrood have been making those ice-spreading totems before Svanir even learned to make them, and considering how things tend to be quiet and slow in icy locations, GW1's pillar could have been there untouched since the last time the dragons rose, raised by whoever sentient race Jormag corrupted back then. They could even be the previous owners of the bones inside the oldest icebrood colossi.
---
But again, it's all coincidences. Whether there's any link or not, there's nothing actually pointing to anything here.
---
i think your friends are thinking about leveling in gw2 like it usually is in other games (that being you get the most experience by killing/grinding monsters and doing quests/hearts) but on gw2 trying to level up that way is not only slow but also quite tedious, try telling them that they will get far more experience by exploring the map since very wp/poi/vista they discover gives a nice chunk of experience, also participating in events gives way more experience than grinding random mobs so encourage them to participate in any event they see
---
I stick to 15 for most alts, since I prefer to make the inventory 5 slots wide and hiding bags results in annoyances like now knowing where the edges of bags are.
---
&gt; I am not the most tech savvy but I am guessing this is due to the large number of people that want to do those game modes and the server makes space by taking people out, even though they just went to wash their hands from a spill accident or grab their plate from downstairs smh
---
the number of people doing these activities actually diminishes rather quickly after the first couple of days to a very managable amount. they are some of the oldest festival content, never got a facelift, and offer quite niche entertainment, so many people opt to not spend too much time on them, especially after getting their meta achievement progress.
---
the short idle timer originates from the fact that activities are modded PvP sub-modes, and simply inherited this characteristic from sPvP.
---
i experienced similar behaviour after a couple of updates. have you tried running a repair already?
---
A candy corn cob costs around 3g.
---
It takes 3 cobs to get a 20 slot bag.
---
The rune to make a 20 slot bag alone costs 10g.
---
That makes pails cheaper than crafted bags.
---
Even cheaper is getting the 20 slot bags from WvW.
---
I tried that as well. I suspected it was due to the snow making machines. I was able to deploy my glider before hitting the ground.
---
That takes relics that must be spent in Deroir's upgrades first.
---
I was giving you the time of when I started playing because you said I wasn't around during the early wvw days. That's the best answer you could come up with? Lol
---
Yeah, ran repair. No change, 64 bit has the issue, 32 bit runs perfectly
---
The thing that a lot of people don't want to admit though is they do this because they get away with it  
---
Despite all the bullshit Bethesda has pulled over the years, is there any doubt what so ever that people will mindlessly flock to the next Elder Scrolls game?  
---
EA makes untold amounts of cash just off their FIFA games alone.  
---
The guy who drops $30 so he can look fresh on a shiny mount, AFK in lions arch, is just as culpable in the degradation of GW2 as the devs
---
I'm a newbie - took me about a month of solid grinding about 2 hours per night to get from 1 - 80. That being said, I pretty much ONLY did story, map completions (exploration), and the first 4 or 5 areas worth of Hero Points. I didn't do any WvW or PVP, and still haven't seen a dungeon or fractal or raid.   
---
I think it really depends on what parts of the game you play and your playstyle. I think if I had just done WvW's and such from the jump, I'd have leveled MUCH faster. I just wanted to get the basic gist of the game and run a single toon to 80 to see what the game was like though, so my leveling experience was kinda slow.   
---
Not sure if any of that helps...but...yeah.
---
Halloween pail track reward is one of my faves. 👍
---
Looking back, I can agree with you on those points. But still, for such an important character (since it was probably meant to surprise GW1 players, she must have been memorable), I don't remember her name being ever mentioned.
---
rng is a massive aspect to speed running in some cases, even in gw2. world record times for deimos rely on getting the short dialog that is chosen randomly.
---
i'll grant you that this is near to your theoretical fastest time, but if you're point was to show the shortcuts this video doesn't come off as that
---
I was too busy laughing to glide the first time :D
---
It is just going through the story up to the lv60 instance in Claw Island.
---
The story gives at key at lv 10, 40, 60. The lv10 is limited to 1 per week.
---
So there really is no way to change color /opacity of inventory? Even though I couldn't find the setting, I just couldn't and still can't believe there isn't one.
---
Other games still require rotations.  
---
GW2 is unique in that you're not really required to actually do a good job to succeed. In other games, if your DPS drops too low your healer might run out of gas before the boss is dead and you wipe. Same goes for not understanding how to aggro. Same goes for a tank that can't hold focus or a healer who doesn't manage mana/MP/energy.  
---
If you're really hot garbage your team might just kick you or all leave and ditch you alone in the dungeon.  
---
In gw2, you can just sit and whittle the enemy all day. There's no resource management to say "beat the bad guy before I run out!". Peer pressure from your party used to be a thing here but went away with the retiring of dungeons and the (more or less) total abandonment of instanced content as primary income means.
---
The game's over reliance on overworld bosses also means that people who contribute nothing to the fight never even know it and still get the rewards the same as the guy meticulously rotating BiS skills.
---
It was. NSP took 80% of it before AR returned in any strength.
---
Current market value, yes, this works out to be about 1g less than the current cheapest 20 slot bag available.

That's because of where she fits in the story. &gt;!She was under a fake name and couldn't reveal her identity or what she was after as the player character wasn't part of the Shining Blade. And once we did join the Shining Blade, we finished the story and her revenge so there really wasn't much time there. She is quite old so I don't know how many NPCs know of her true identity, that aren't members of the Shining Blade.!&lt;

ArenaNet, of course; unless...
---
You reveal your true face!
---
It's still better than a subscription, and you get to choose if you want to purchase the content patch or not.
---
That *was* the issue, now the issue is that the game is in sort of a disguised maintenance mode and many players have yet to catch on. People were fired because they wanted to start working on other projects instead of milking the cash cow that is gw2. Eventually, this entire sub will realized what has happened. Gw2 is pretty much cooked. They will continue to milk the gemstore until the fan base dies off, then maintenance mode will become official.

Oh yeah, I'm sure NCSOFT is so great and efficient at their money-making, they'll never reach a point of incompetence where they need to fire half the employees of one of their companies!

By the way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority

**Argument from authority**
---
An argument from authority (argumentum ab auctoritate), also called an appeal to authority, or argumentum ad verecundiam, is a form of defeasible argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. It is well known as a fallacy, though some consider that it is used in a cogent form when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. Other authors consider it a fallacy in general to cite an authority on the discussed topic as the primary means of supporting an argument.
---
It is not. Players completely new to RPGs have no problems with it.
---
The problem arises for those used to RPGs in which you grind levels killing lots of enemies like Final Fantasy.
---
They come along, go kill some bandits, and they get little exp from that, as a deer with a yellow name 3 steps away ill give more likely to give way more exp from exploration bonus than the bandit everyone kills on respawn. 
---
Now that the game can have phased NPCs only the player can see, it could be possible to have the racial friend (Rytlock, Thackeray, Caithe, etc) or some other voice NPC accompany the player giving hints during the first levels, like how to dodge, that events and exploration give more exp than farming enemies on respawn in one spot, or that enemies with defiance bars take more damage after the bar breaks.
---
GW2 could really use something like that.
---
Deviating from the original manifesto is pretty common for many games after they "impact" with the community, sales, costs of production after launch and so on... That said what i meant was that they found a decent equilibrium in content and type of content so that most of the playerbase were pretty much happy (mainly on the pve side ofc, pvp was kinda forgotten after the esport fiasco)
---
But the situation now is different, it doesn't feel like they didn't "just" respect a manifesto and had to go other ways for various reasons. It feels like they're not aiming for anything big and just hope to survive with minimal content drops.
---
If you couldn't tell that was sarcasm, you probably would've lost track at some point during the comment anyways so why bother
---
I bought complete GW1 during the post-HoT drought and had loads of fun completing everything. Took me like 2-3 years to get GWAMM, playing now and then. Only missing a few annoying things, like hm WoC, Mallyx, and Dhuum.
---
Wish GW2 had that kind of longterm goals, but whatever.
---
Most of the people who bandwagon hate on gw2 so heavily like what OP is depicting dont even play the game anymore, and I have seen someone argue that the game is shit who quit the series during gw1... Yes, someone tried to argue and bicker that gw2 is shit and anet is a terrible company and they havent even so much as looked at gw2.
---
&gt;  this community as a whole has flipped to parroting the same negative buzzwords
---
I swear to god if I hear the expression "deus ex machina" used incorrectly in any discussion about the game's writing again i'm gonna set fire to my computer.
---
Well said. At a certain point you're expected to essentially pay per item what many game studios charge per game. It's so far beyond unreasonable I have no idea why people still defend it.
---
This includes if you were a speedclear player. If you are interested in getting back into speedclears, there is still a community for it. Go to Embark ae during NA hours and ee during euro hours and ask around.
---
The notable factor is that you remember "the JP incident" at all.   
---
A serial abuser got their comeuppance, that's all that happened.  It is completely irrelevant to GW2 other than the other longtime dev who was also fired and who unfortunately supported a serial abuser.
---
What a pathetic mindset
---
shhhh, shhhh its ok that silly game wont hurt you here, just keep buying capes from the gem store it'd be all right.
---
Loading in online games is almost always because of internet issues. If you live somewhere with crappy internet then your loading screens will take forever. Some options for less lag is to keep character model limit low. On the bottom of the graphics options, you will see 2 options about character model limit and quality, keep those both at low. Also playing the game in windowless border has been a lifesaver for me in particular.
---
After reading the comments here, then looking back at the image. I yikesed...
---
Wtf are you even talking about?
---
The journalist alluded to the event. I'm pointing out what they alluded to. People asked what happened, so I gave a timeline of it.
---
Again, what is my opinion?
---
People keep endlessly complaining about not much content in the new Saga when we're literally 2 episodes in. We *JUST* started, like dear god, have some patience before cricising the entire saga as trash.
---
No sub is why you get nickel and dimed with a cash shop, why sub games have more reliable updates than b2p or f2p games. And let's be honest, there's never a choice to not buy content patches, a good content patch will be designed in a way that you will pretty much HAVE to buy it.
---
Yikes — That’s a horrible take.
---
Don't worry, there will be an achi for it that gives 1 AP if you repeat the entire story 200 times. It will be the achi hunter's dream to get all of that sweet achievement points.
---
first quarter doesnt look good and more people doubt if it will be better
---
Also worth mentioning is that a majority of the money we pay to anet, wont get invested back into gw2 anymore and instant yet more side projects.
---
With how bad the management of anet is, they probably will flop just like the other ones which got shutdown ... essentially burning your money for nothing instant of improving the game you play.
---
Reminds me - where is my Awakened Roller Beetle?!
---
Jesus Christ shut the fuck up
---
I swear i don’t have any 😭. So is it that big of a file??
---
You can use external hard drive for that. Assuming you can get one.
---
I have one but will the game run properly?
---
Yes, the game is that large.
---
Wtf 😐
---
From my experience, yes it will. Judging from old posts, people even used flash drives for it.
---
Okay. Thanks!
---
Keep in mind, the faster that thing is, the less time you will spent on loading screens. Its not terrible to use relatively old HDD but 10 seconds and 30-60+ is a big difference.
---
Only 12$? It’s 700 gems ($8.75) for one slot, 1890 gems ($23.63) for 3 slots using the bulk discount, or 2800 gems ($35) for 5 slots using the bulk discount. Hopefully no one has more than one pass lol. Oh wait...
