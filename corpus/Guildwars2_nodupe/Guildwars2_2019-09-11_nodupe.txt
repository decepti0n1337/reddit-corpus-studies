Talking about shaders...
---

---
Could anybody point me how to make the Ambient Oclusion shader stronger?
---
---
---
If you ever plan on getting the Skyscale, I'd recommend farming the required materials (like charged quartz crystals) and the LW s4 currencies. It will save you a lot of time, trust me!
---
You have an hour or so listed in the LWS3 maps, but I'm interested what that entails. The Bitterfrost chest/berry farm, for example, doesn't take nearly that long. Siren's Landing is super short, so how did you spend your hour there? I'm very interested in your methodology for all the maps, but those in particular, considering I've done casual measuring myself and have noticed significantly higher returns than you listed.
---
The only map that I can think of that didn't provide vary much unique and good content was Kourna. Everything else I would argue brought plenty of content. In fact, I would argue that it was the main focus of THE *only* content we really would get.
---
Wow, that's so cool!
---
You must have grinded forever to get that! Or gotten a really rare drop! Or..... Oh wait, nevermind. Anyone with a wallet can get it.
---
I already have. Quite a few times.
---
I plan on 3d printing a charr too.
---
yeah, I guess. A launch day trailer isn't that weird.
---
Yup, this is very true. Thank you :)
---
GREATEST JAGRAS
---
I don't want more Collections but there's no reason not to have a few. And take it a step further: We have cosmetic Infusions as super rare drops, why not mount skins?
---
This is freaking awesome, well done! :D
---
And what are you doing with the extra drop once you have all the Mats, Tributes and Gifts etc, and get more drops while trying for the clovers at the end?  
---
You are losing gold anyway either selling the extra lower price if you need the cash immediately, or in listing/exchange fees.
---
Didn't they merge parts of the Anet marketing team with NCSoft during the layoffs? Someone also mentioned the poncho guy used to work for Anet but his position changed to NCSOFT at some point recently.
---
They don't make gemstore armor sets anymore - not entire sets. Gloves, boots, hats, occasionally shoulders. But the complete sets with chest and legs are pretty much exclusively from the first 1-2 years.
---
Roy bought leggings and is enjoying his leggings gameplay, and is too busy to play PvP
---
The Verdant Brink trick gets you most of the way, but some additional notes:
---
1. You can't buy the gear boxes for chest armor from the vendor. The only way to get them is to finish the night meta at T4. So you might get lucky and find a group doing it, or get it another way.
---
2. For weapons, your fastest bet is probably to do elite spec weapon collections.
---
3. For back/trinkets, you should farm Living Story maps. Since you don't have S3, you'll have to rely on what you can get from S4 maps. I'm pretty sure they made it so you can get the full set from the season's maps.
---
4. Probably your fastest way to patch any holes in your gear (i.e. if you can't get the chest armor from VB) is to do PvP reward tracks. I believe the Crystal Desert track should let you choose stats on the armor from the box at the end (choose Warbeast or Bounty Hunter armor since those require crafting and the elonian ones you get spammed with). You can also get weapons relatively quickly by playing the PvP season either to get the exptic obsidian weapons or getting the ascended ones for a higher cost.
---
I’m not angry just disa—wait already said that. I’m not angry just confused.
---
What I've been able to tell is that its going to be a new map, build templates, and possibly a shorter story since they are calling it an epilogue.  There will probably be usual changes that come with the patch notes where one item in particular will be a great QoL change.  I get the first major update from them after the layoffs would be smaller in size but the hype with the teasers in teasers for trailers and such is just weird.  Its like you said, I guess we'll see next week and for episode 1 or 2 (or whatever they want to call it) of the saga.
---
I don’t think it’s going to be our normal teaser trailer though. I think it’s going to be more like “play now” and they’ll try to advertise the release more. Giving a teaser a week before doesn’t really help people not playing the game though. They’ll see it and forget about it in a week.
---
Still not working. Also, there's no way I can install DirectX12 on W7.
---
I did forget that there are other ancillary features coming out with the prologue, technically. I was just looking at it from a purely Living Story/Saga release perspective, especially because the map is being built on itself with subsequent releases. I guess I can't rag on anet too much if there's an actual lack of content in the prologue, but after the failure (in my eyes) of the announcement, I'm kinda putting gw2 on the backburner in my mind.
---
I love how everyone who posts this is someone who has not posted/commented on this sub for at least months. This account hasn't been even active the last 3 years.
---
Also happens in [red sometimes.](https://imgur.com/a/p6Gmqsl) Almost think this is a glitch from someone having been there with a bunch of infusions, but not sure.
---
....mice leaving the ship.....
---
I think this is the biggest WTF year for Anet since pre-HoT content drought.  There are so many unanswered questions and then that event was the last straw for a lot of people and Anet blew it.  Unless you like lore, there's nothing to be excited about with this game anymore.  Build templates are nice but I mean, that's really it.
---

---
Please use search. Has been asked and answered like 20+ times.
---
Do we really need more?  What do we have now, 4?  5? (looks at wiki...oh 9).
---
Well I speak from firsthand experience. Which is why I am perfectly fine with getting downvoted into oblivion as long as I know the truth-- no one genuinely *wants* to die, they just are desperate to stop suffering and act on it. Depression guises itself as rational thought.
---
But I can definitely say that when you are at that low of a point, you know what to expect when telling people about it. You know people are going to freak out and/or tell you the same old stuff you've heard a thousand times, especially people that don't know you personally. The last thing you want to hear is "you need to get therapy" especially because you've tried that before and it was a waste of time and money. What you want is someone close that you can trust to confide in and tell them your situation, and see if they can tell you something substantial to actually help even if all feels hopeless. You want to be proven wrong, and you know that the only people who can do that for you are people who actually *know* you and care about you. Random people in a video game don't know jack shit about you and all of the things they can offer are just generic answers you've heard many times before. At best, you can appreciate the effort they put, but you know deep down that your existence is completely inconsequential to their life.
---
Well, at least that all applies to me.
---
Actually someone who was very vital to the good parts of the game :/
---
Now I want to hear a version of this using a mix of the dark/light with a male and female voice singing opposite eachother, where the two voices are at odds by way of how they time their lyrics.  In my case, the darkness would be slower and persistant, very much like Maclaine Diemer's vocals, while the hopeful voice would tend so sound like the original... But would interject when the darkness begins to cut into her que, and refuse to allow the dark voice to have the last line with "who needs the light"
---
It almost sounds comedic, which I believe that would not sound great, but I think if it were done as someone's inner hope refusing to be silenced/replaced it could add to the emotion of the Diemer's version.
---
big funny
---
Depends on the age of the character. [Birthday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift) are quite nice for older chars. Might be better to buy a new character slot.
---
Why don't they "just" make invisible walls up to the map ceiling around the upper perimeter of every objective, so that *nobody* can jump inside *any* structure for the foreseeable future, regardless of what travel methods get implemented?
---
This would require enemies to destroy a wall or gate to enter the structure, and allied players could only enter and exit through the gate portal or waypoint, which nerfs turtling just a bit in some specific cases.
---
Players caught inside when control of the structure changes from their team to another team could possibly be allowed a one-way exit through the gate portal; this preserves the option to have stealthy mesmer/thief portals to bypass destroying gates or walls.
---
Funny?
---

---
People want change, it's normal. Some are faithful till the end, that is also normal. Wish her the best.
---
Only if they don't take up a precious Shared Slot. 
---
Atm I have Royal Terrace because that was my first one (plus it's nice to have instant access to all WPs without changing map layers) and Mistlock because fractals. If I were to buy a third pass it would be the WvW one. Unless new passes have a special feature I see no reason to get more.
---
Well that's true. Or if someone takes him, he doesnt' even need to use the booster. Keep in mind this is only a basic raptor mount but it's still faster to get around than no mount at all.
---
I'd suffer at least 6 months with no content if it meant we got new specs. The living story is alright I guess but relative to new specs I could not give less of a shit about it.

---
Practice till you get a grip on the game again, just like you did to get a grip on the game in the first place.
---
Do PvP or map completion tiill you get the hang of it, follow the storylines, go Living World if you have any of them, etc.

Hey, I came here looking for the same thing and got lucky in a few searches. Here's what I found. :)

In my experience, userbench hasn't been as good at predicting performance in GW2.  But yeah, the 9600k is also a good choice.

... How would this be different from something like the Lava Lounge in Ember Bay? Sounds like ANet had the balls years ago.
---
My point isn't that one of us is right. My point is it's not that clear cut. For every person lost now, there was a person lost then. Both ways have advantages and disadvantages. As I said, I played it this way before the change was made, particularly for the reasons I listed. It's not objectively worse. It just creates a different set of problems.

&gt;and it’s okay, since it’s just convenience

a.k.a. you create the problem to sell the solution

Any yall get this to work? I posted a question about it but the only way I got reshade + d912pxy to work together was to install reshade by pointing at the gw2-64.exe -&gt; then moving the reshade files into the bin64 along with in stalling the d912pxy as standard d3d9.dll.
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/184
---
But now I can't do any screenshots, they are just black screen!
---
If you unlocked inventory spaces, you will lose them.
---
If your character is too old, you will lose future birthday gifts (this stopped me more than once when I wanted to delete my characters).
---
Any other soulbound item will be lost. 
---
Any crafting leveled up will be lost (this one stopped me too).
---
Warbeast heavy set is great
---
My own super murder kitty? Hells yes I would. I even know where I'd send it to train its murdering skills.
---
For me the trick was to install reshade with it's own installer to the same folder where gw2.exe and bin64 folder is. As far as I could figure it out, was that when ReShade is in a different folder than the d3d9.dll you don't need to chainload it. Then I installed the d912xpxy to the bin64 folder and it started working, screenshots work too.

---
i5 9600k = 2624
---
Single-core they are fairly comparable, but on multi-core tests the 3600(X) has been performing significantly better.  Those benches are close, but Passmark's single thread (not their general CPU bench) has still been the best predictor I've found for GW2.

So just to clarify:
---
No multithreading + official DX9 + Amateur DX12 wrapped around it = Massive performance increase.
---
No multithreading + official DX12 = No Performance increase.
---
Seems counterintuitive. But it doesn't even really matter, because nobody said anything about the implementation. All that matters are the results. They could make their own DX12 wrapper for all I care, if it comes with the same performance enhancements as d912pxy but with the issues ironed out, we would already be miles ahead of where we are now.
---
And it's not like they haven't had *years* to fix their performance now. First time I've read a post saying how multi-threading would be more beneficial than *insert random suggestion* was 2013. 6 years ago. The vanilla game still runs like ass.
---
I..  I would..
---
Alright, sorry for my choice of words. I know the bottlenecks and of course i'd love me some multithread optimiziation as a Ryzen owner. But i just don't see why they can't start out small like with this wrapper just to reduce the overhead first if they don't have ressources for a larger implementation. See, some friends of mine for example are afraid of installing this wrapper because ANet has not taken official stance on it. This annoys me to hell and back, because some of them could see a real big difference in performance.
---
I might download a Charr \~\_\^
---
Isn't Lily of the Elon exactly that? PoF only lounge.
---
First: show this also works on an enemy tower. Mounts do behave differently then and you cannot be sure it works then if you only tried while you owned it.
---
And second: why crying after an invisible wall? Even if this is exploitable also for enemy towers: why not change the actual tower a little so that this is visibly not possible anymore? Invisible walls should be the last resort only.

I run gw2 on ryzen 2600 at 4,1ghz with RX 580 8gb 1430mhz with 16gb ram on an ultrawide 1440p monitor with ultra graphics except for character model limit on medium/low.
---
It runs amazingly well! Stable 60fps solo playing/ 5 men content. In huge meta fights it dropps to around 40/30 lowest.
---
I can definitely reccomend ryzen cpus, it worked for me like a charm!
---
Holy shit that got nuked so fast even ceddit couldn't catch it.
---
Start with doing WvW dailes for Gift of Battle reward track, buying Mystic Clovers from fractal vendor (2 clovers per day) and Chests of Legendary Shards (1 chest per day for 10 Laurels). Start doing meta events (HoT and PoF) for Amalgamated Gemstones. You can earn 8 per day from events. I recommend you mix 80lvl orbs (+t6 dust) in Mystic Forge for more amalgamated gemstones (3x3 orbs, you have chance to get 5 gemstones).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Check what is needed for your legendary weapons in gw2efficiency. There is a little guide how to craft everything. But I would start with most valuable items like Coins, Gift of Battle and Gemstones.
---
PoF weapons require lots of Elder wood and mithril. You can spend whole month running with an axe and chop trees, or you can farm volatile magic and buy shipments. I crafted all my shards for The Shining Blade in less than 2 weeks.
---
I have though... every single one of them.
---
Article said LS 4 was on a 2-3 month schedule yet the only time there was a 2 month gap between episodes was between Long Live the Lich and A Star to Guide Us which was 2 months 22 days, which is closer to 3 months. 
---
Every other gap was 3 months or longer and sometimes even 4 months, so the schedule was actually 3-4 when its now advertised as 2-3
---
If it'll earn Anet money? The answer is yes.
---
Is it possible for it to figure out or add how many I consumed already, or is it only able to see the kp items currently in an inventory/bank?
---
Whatever's the definition, all they did is posted a piece of the same cinematic they showed at the event on 30th. We already know there's some charr music band. How is it supposed to build up hype?
---
Also Silverwastes
---
Eyy that's a thread i started , just to add in what I've experienced so far :
---
I submitted and in-game ticket with detailed screenshots , i posted on the forums (as you've seen) and i opened up a support ticket . The only response I've received thus far is the one you read on my forum post :/ 
---
At this point i believe we've missed the sale though i still hope - 
---
A. It gets fixed
---
B. The sale gets extended (at least for those who got screwed by this glitch in the matrix)
---
It's likely the name of the band, not an actual high legion
---
_You wouldn't steal an Ascalon [fromthe charr]_
---
If you dont know already: If you go on your mount or sit on a chair while your weapons are drawn the book stays
---
I've got a feeling that we're all severely  overestimating what's in the prologue.
---
Iirc there's been no definite announcement on what content we can expect in the prologue?
---
I call them "orange" and "yellow" because gold is somewhere in between on the colour scale... if someone said gold, I'd assume they meant exotic...
---
Can't catch a break with the incompetence of ArenaNet.
---
I'ts supposed to do something though, but the event may probably be bugged, sorry.
---
Because anet is in development hell right now and have terrible schedule and marketing skills. I hope they figure it out and we don't have to wait till january for ep1.
---
And how do I get exotic viper accessories? Everyone tell me to go to LS2/3 but I don’t have them.
---
I love the connected nature of GW2's account unlock system.  It's not quite the same as my preferred character system (FFXI, FFXIV, The Secret World, etc. where you just need a single character for all classes/jobs/professions) it sure does come close. So Ascended and Legendary gear really does help that out, being able to swap them around.  But finding a class that speaks to you can be really hard.  I didn't make my main character, my Necromancer, until March 2015, and didn't get him to 80 until late 2016 I think.
---
You can only destroy them, souldbound items can´t be sold, so in the trash with them if you dont need them.
---
Same! Queensdale has always been one of my favs, makes me think about when I started there 7 years ago and I get all nostalgic
---
The length of playtime you have doesn't correspond to how much bling you have. People play the game for different reasons and in different areas.
---
Depending on the quality of the object, some soulbound items are salvageable. If not... Yeah, I'm afraid throwing them is all yiu can do. If there's another option, I've been doing this wrong for a while.
---
Looks like it based on google pictures. Thanks.
---
just do 3 matches every day, cycle through 3 different classes and you should be done reasonably quickly. I'm in Ascension IV and only need 7 more wins for the completition. ;)
---
Also very good to keep your spirits high: Don't "try hard" for the wins. Enjoy the fights, enjoy an awesome 1v1, ect. Enjoy the awesome combat system in PvP. This way it's a lot of fun, no grind, easy daily (2g) reward and a bunch of reward track instant dropplets.
---
&gt; It will save you a lot of time, trust me!

And money!

If you are refering to gear you get from story instances and level up rewards than no.
---
You cant sell or salvage them.
---
However what you can do is keep them and wait till you have 4 of them. Then throw them into the mystic forge in lions arch in order to get a new random item with an average level between the 4.
---
This becomes more useful when you throw rare and exotic gear from high lvl up rewards as you have a chance to get some rly nice exotic items.
---
And even if they are bad  (for you) you can still sell them on tp for a gold or two
---
What are you even talking about, Pyre's lines are way better and actually have meaning behind them. GW2 is just edgy teen drama.
---
But the point is ARM Wine can only run ARM applications.
---
GwSetup.exe is x86, not ARM, thus cannot be started through ARM Wine
---
Raids weapons/armor, celestial red infusion (TBH I don't know why they don't add recolors of it and just slap them as rewards for other CM stuff), gen 2 legendary (this is pretty much buyable, you buy the mats, everything else is easy), etc.
---
But as I said, I'm not against having a mount skin as a reward for challenging stuff, I'm very much in favor of it, but you can probably imagine the outrage that people who don't want challenging stuff.
---
I'm just against making it a very easy/boring gold sink, cause at the end of the day would be the same as keeping them in the gemstore (hence the get gold convert to gems).
---
It's either a bug or oozes got hit while you werent paying attention. Try restarting the instance if all 6 happened in same one, otherwise report the bug. There's not much you can do really.
---
The rats abandon the sinking ship.
---
That is a seriously overweight beardy!
---
I've been using several versions of this, with default configurations. In general, my experience is positive, with a couple of asterisks next to that. I do definitely see the difference in performance, especially when panning around your camera in busy areas, it just goes much smoother with this plugin installed. Graphically, it does sometimes need to load in textures of new things in an area, showing up blue/orange before it properly gets textures, but that fixes itself rather quickly and once they are in memory you dont see it anymore.
---
There are crashes sometimes, though. With older versions these happened sporadically, and often when I had the game alt-tabbed away. With the current 1.7.1 version, the crashes have only happened at start-up so far, running into some unhandled exceptions. After rebooting the game a couple of times, it does get through and I haven't had issues afterwards. So I wouldn't say it is completely stable, but if you can live with these kind of hiccups it does feel great to play with.
---
&gt; It's like saying "check the wiki" when someone asks for advice. People just use it for the sake of using it.

---
You need to take a crappy phone picture of your Legendary
---
Regarding Fractals, are the rewards awarded to only one character or is it account-bount? In other words, can I do them again with alt chars and gain rewards again?
---
Remember when GW1 had no limit for minions? Good times, good times.
---
Don't you worry. I have played since the launch until 2013/14, then went on huge breaks playing on and off and only have I started focusing on a legendary this year. I am focusing on Twilight right now as I have also fell in love with the new necro I created *highfive*
---
So don't feel bad, you're ahead of me lol
---
Well, you could just update it yourself...
---
I'm trying to find a logical inconsistency here and failing on technicalities.
---
Very good point my dude
---
In case you haven't checked yet, it seems that the Astralaria cover has been unlocked!
---
so the *recap* takes the *Living world* section of the wiki?

&gt; Soul of Tyria
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; A 7th dragon called Tyria sleeping in the core of the planet
---
So what you're saying is planets are actually giant cocoons/incubators for ~~Titans~~ dragons and next expansion we'll be feeding our Heart of ~~Azeroth~~ Tyria with ~~Azerite~~ Tyriaite in order to heal the soul of ~~Azeroth~~ Tyria, which was damaged by ~~Sargeras' ginormous sword~~ the imbalance of magic.
---
Bring on the Battle for Tyria expac!
---
This is what happens when you download a Charr. RIP. #meta
---
Fascinatingly broken.
---
&gt; The entire top row is dedicated for minions ,and partially the 3rd passive trait as well tho.
---
Yeah, that is what I meant but missed a word there. One of each major not One major. Still, that are 8 traits left that are not minion specific.
---
&gt; I understand minions arent the best option in most cases, but death magic is the "defensive" line in necromancers, and they get an incredible amount of defense when playing alone with minions.
---
yeah, though most of the traits have either interaction with minions or shroud. More active defenses would be nice for a necromancer so that you actually are not blown to the mists and back just because you have two HP pools.
---
&gt; So much that soloing hard champions is a breeze. Top it up with shroud, cheese stats like full dire and curses you got infantile mode open world pve.
---
Yeah but other than that, minions are pretty useless, In WvW or PvP you either AoE the minions down and the Necromancer is completely vulnerable or focus them directly which doesn't make much of a difference.
---
Death magic is the right place for Minions but maybe we could see a bit more of those "downsides" they talked about so that you can make your minions "better" while them having some form of trade-off.
---
I personally do not care about the skins with a few exceptions. I wanted Astralaria for the skin and I realized that I will no longer go through the process of creating a Gen2 legendary ever again.
---
down with the bourgeoisie

I sell things that can be sold, like all of it.

i hope it's a massive rework so we'll get alot of aFK farmer salt

Learn to play the TP. r/gw2economy is your friend. Dont listen to any of these mindblowing guides for 20g/hour, these are pathetic gold/hour, compared to TP g/hour ratios

There's something fun about cheesing fights and watching things go exactly the opposite of how the encounter was intended. Also, not everyone shares your opinions on what's fun and not.

Bunch of pedos and pedo defenders. They're so insanely easy to troll too, just report users liberally and say you're offended.

It's also possible to get legendary armors from WvW - however it's bound to ranks like... rank 2000 for the ascended chest armor (which is needed for the legendary) --- if you're into wvw. :)
---
Dwayna's statue looks like "I'm already done with your problems, sorry"
---
You guys keep saying that to yourselves.
---
"Do not converse with myself or my progeny ever again"
---
I am going to assume that you are a newer player and there for be a bit careful with all the info so you don't get overwhelmed. 
---
Ok so some of the stuff that you get through the game when leveling up and also things you buy for karma from heart vendors are not possible to sell or salvage. If you leveling up then imo you can just destroy them. They are not possible to use on other characters and are not useful for the future either so no reason to save them.
---
How ever there is one thing that is possible on some of this items, not all but some that you can go to Lions Arch and the mystic forge and place 4 of this items in the mystic forge and get another item out of it that you can salvage. 
---
Again in your situation i would destroy them because when new and leveling you simply get to much junk in your back pack, but just mention this for the future that the Mystic Forge can be a option.
---
I am also guessing that you have items like trophys in your back pack. If you can not sell them then destroy them too. It is itmes from events or hearts that you had to many of. There is no reason to have them clogging up your back pack when you are leveling, you can get them back if you pass such event again or if they are important.

Getting some stronk L70ETC vibes from that teaser

You've never had to deal with this sort of thing (aside from your own issues and how you chose to confront them) if you think that way. Family and friends are, generally, the last people you go to about these sorts of things. I've spoken to my councellors, therapists and psychiatrists about things I still haven't talked to my family or friends about after fifteen years of help.
---
I am so looking forward to this! I left the game some time ago because I wasn't having fun anymore and none of the classes ever really clicked with me in PvE. Maybe it was just the wrong build. I'd like to be able to solo Champions again like I did back in 2012.
---
You don't need to pay for any raid as long as you have the expansions, or are you saying you don't have PoF? They just bundled the two together and gave HoT to everyone with PoF, although I'm not sure if it goes the other way. Could be worth a shot asking around?
---
I do know what you mean with raiding, though. It's not as hard to get into or do as you might think, but not as easy to get into (or as hard to play) as many raiders like to think. I wasn't able to get into raiding until my guild all decided we wanted to stumble through raiding together sometime between W5-6, iirc. 
---
Before then, every time I considered raiding, I took a look at lfg and was met with nothing but raid sellers, huge kp requirements, and groups recruiting for a raid...a few days later. Honestly, the current lfg raid section is terrible, both in design and content, and only serves to present an iron curtain to anyone wanting to get into raiding (and even people that just want to have fun raiding, I'm experienced now and I'm still turned off from most lfg posts). 
---
Unfortunately, until Anet fixes it (maybe make a separate hardcore and normal/casual/training section, either instead of or in addition to the looking-to-join page that no one uses), you probably have to find a guild or discord (there's a few in a guide linked in the sidebar). You shouldn't have to go outside of the game to find a group, but here we are.
---
A rock-charr ?
---
Going through the Scyscale stuff currently... makes me doubt that ANet hat any Game-Designers at all.
---
Thank you! Will try it out!
---
The living story usually doesn't deliver much content and in between updates you often do nothing. and after having done the festival once there is not much to do the next time it comes around.
---
If you're interested in getting into raids, check out Raid Academy. You're incredibly welcome to come learn, even if you're in exotic gear. Raids aren't brutally difficult and threatening content.
---
they'll probably polish the traits there as they are quite weird right now in terms of how the scale(or not) with your stats..looking at you death nova
---
i really hope they don't push minions the spirit weapon route, this game needs more permanent summons not less
---
However, it's not homework, it's a game someone is trying to have a better experience of. 
---
There is a dedicated Q&amp;A thread. If you don't want to answer the question adequately, then don't.
---
Minions serve zero purpose besides distracting the braindead AI from attacking you instead of your pets, which buys you time. Why would that get nerfed?
---
Most of the time I wish I was getting targeted myself so the damn paper things wouldnt be on cooldown half the time. 
---
I would like to see them buffed in competitve play to where they can survive more than one or two autoattacks. What a fucking waste.
---
As I prop myself back up on my mount, a smaller yet angrier ogre donkey punches me with a boulder.
---
The game isn't really consistent .. many vendors sell you armor yet some of it will be unsalvageable and some others will be .. like cultural armor I believe you can salvage, but the armor from the 3 orders for instance you cannot.
---
Using it for a week, the performance improvement is unbelievable. Only bugs for me are some pop-in during first loading the game (mounts not visible for first few seconds etc), character portraits are borked (often just hair missing or something), and when I swap armour the dye colour is still showing from the old set in the hero panel (fine in the game itself). All very minor bugs that I'm more than happy to overlook for the crazy smoothness.
---
For reference I'm using a Ryzen 2700X, GTX1070, 16GB RAM (3200MHz).
---
Thank you so much! Take a look.
---
because GW2 doesn't have a build template system in-game... I just decided to create a new characters for that build
---
And I bought these slots with gold converted to gem.
---
...not minions, though. Not death magic. Blood magic was the buffing/support attribute, just like in GW2.
---
Well, one-time account unlocks ARE the best investment for money... Billy is pretty smart.
---
Absolutely. Really is a joke they won't fix their mess of a game. Anet should be paying into this guys Patreon honestly for the good work hes doing.
---
I’ve been wanting it for years, mobile devices are more than capable of running the visuals. 
---
Mobile, tablet, switch. 
---
A new touch centric UI and mob rebalance. Movement in the game is already prepped for it because it includes click to move. 
---
Throw in some more HoM goals to reward mobile play in gw2
---
Anet should place the wall on the very top, to watch people spend an hour trying to get it right, just to get cockblocked at the very end.
---
Now that you know you will always be 7 years behind the others you can quit XDD
---
just kiding, but its true that some people feel like that
---
Are they salvageable? Just thinking if I should put expensive rune or not.
---
I have and still am playing gw1. The only support a pure minion master provides is a meat shield
---
I'll have you know I'm still gliding around!!
---
Actually I use bone minions quite often as scourge. Summon, explode, gain life-force faster than with shadow fiend.
---
Grats!  I made that one a few months back as well.
---
Now if only it could be reworked so Necromancers, the class most ideally suited to Ipos' asthetic, would actually want to equip it, that would be great....
---
What would be the point of public hangings when everyone around you could just press 'F'?
---
I actually had Koss or General Morgahn do that most of the time :D
---
Ok, makes sense. 
---
It was weird, and I had a guildmate come to see it to make sure it wasn't just my client and I wasn't crazy.
---
Minions are useless in endgame pve except two cases and don't even use those "miraculous death magic traits". No nerf needed
---
Yeah that's one name I miss the most. Siren's reef would probably be enjoyable if he were still around to listen.

Rumour is she's had to focus on her career for a while. She's still the gold standard for guides up to Dragonfall/end of Season 4. 
---
Season 4 brought out 6 new maps, one or two new fractals (can't remember which was when), a new raid and three new mounts (one of which is unlocked through WvW). 
---
The game releases part of the [Anet forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com) has all the updates, as does the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com). 
---
Season 5 "The Icebrood Saga" starts on the 17th with a prologue episode and a new map that will grow over time as the season progresses.
---
Exordium has more merit has you can just get Gen 1 stuff on the TP..
---
Exodium seems more fun cause of the animation but it looks like a mutlicolor keyblade, I prefer the huge greatsword look of Gen 1.
---
Would prob get exodium myself tbh, the animations are really something..
---
I know the context. But, like I said, is that any worse than a generic roast or stand-up act, or parody? He's not saying any harmful words or saying 'get out of the sub' like people act like he is. It's not like there's any dogwhistling or such going on either, from what I can see.
---
This is NCSoft's doing. ArenaNet had a culture that assumed job security until the most recent layoffs. After the surprise layoffs, it's normal that developers suddenly realize "Hey, these guys gave shit warning, and while I may love working in ArenaNet, I really need the job security." This is a normal reaction, on top of what we may speculate. It's also normal that after such a massive layoff, other companies suddenly put your workforce in their target sights and begin sniping away your workers.
---
My speculation is, either the incompetence over at the head of NCSoft West decided they couldn't cope with an ArenaNet that had as much independence as it did and they must have decided that sniping employees to work on other studios' (mobile dev) work in the same universe just wasn't going to work out without more direct involvement, or NCSoft just wants to close their NCSoft West division entirely because they'd much rather have more direct control in development over in South Korea with their central brands. Then there's the whole matter of the huge line of middlemen between ArenaNet and NCSoft Global, the South Korean head, and the very potential likelihood of friction between NCSoft West and NCSoft Global, with NCSoft West using ArenaNet as a bullet sponge to NCSoft Global's attempts to apply the brakes on them to try to work the nepotism out of the middle management.
---
I strongly vote against it! First, copying the mesmer is pretty lame and uninspired. Second, there should be a character that has its own little army with him. Third, "breeding bad players" is a pretty arrogant term - esp. since the game evolves around PvE!
---
Relatively new and have a question about combat.
---
I'm a Revanant so I figured I'd be able to take a few hits but it seems like I just get deleted by gold mobs in like 2-3 hits and I'm not sure what I should be doing? Like I dodge the "charged" attacks but then I still get killed by things either when I'm out of energy to dodge or something I'm not seeing.
---
What comtent would you like to play?
---
Yup, if they were harder to kill in WVW it would make for some fun strategy.  They don't need ther damage increased either.  I just want them to live longer for the nuisance factor.  Keep your opponent moving to avoid death by a thousand paper cuts, plus the condition transfer cleanse or Bone Fiend bombs.
---
No, instead they melt when sneezed on.  Beyond useless.
---
i hope they change it a lot because it's the most useless necro traitline.
---
i think they should let necros share fury, protection and alacrity so that heal scourge can be competitive support in raids and not a niche
---
A reasonable change would be renaming the **flesh golem** to **fish golem** while under water :-)
---
But I neeeeed that outfit that I will wear for a week before I decide I don’t like that the non removable cape clips through both my greatsword and my shield and also looks like a dress when I’m running.
---
Why are you such a negative person?
---
Are you saying completed fractals still give rewards sans the "daily rewards?
---
Champion mobs are usually hard to solo, especially for a new player that is far from having max-level equipment, so this is just normal no worries.
---
Yes, they drop relics and some small loot.
---
A sad yet also frustrating hero challenge.
---
Another hero challenge on that map is the wife of that branded ogre, who is training to kill her husband, and will tell the story of his corruption after you beat her.
---
But god damn they could have made the platform a *little* bigger for that knockback.
---
Metal Legion woo! Awesome!
---
The irony is that nobody will see his skins in WvW because everyone is using the character model override.
---
A little confusing since they're in low level zones but fair enough lol. Thanks for the quick response.
---
I guess Guardian burning burst. Only condition build I can think of from the top of my head without much of a ramp up.
---
They are underpowered, yes. But why always "active" gameplay? Why not have a passive one featured, too? Don't force all the players into one direction.
---

If only there were unique instances, voice-acting, and minigames created specifically for the skyscale acquisition, hmmmm

Maybe get through more than just the first couple of collections before you start bitching how every step is the same.

Good boy,  Anet approves.
---
LMAO
---
for curiosity's sake, what did your LFG message actually look like?
---
I'm filling pretty good with the game UI right now that I feel like it's time experiencing with Addons. I wonder if there's any staple addons that everyone use? I'm currently still leveling. Or - Unlike World of Warcraft where I couldn't play without some quality of life addons - GW2 is good enough to most people won't use Addons?
---
Also, Do addon have big impact on performance?
---
Selling jp in lfg is bit harsh.
---
But on the other hand you not really helping. Mean it’s in the same spectrum as selling raid wings.
---
Personally I dunno anets stance on it. But if this really the case seems like selling raid wings also could result in this.
---
Fractals are inherently easier to get into, since the amount of specific tasks are lower, as well as the treshhold of precision needed to complete them (they are more forgiving). You can go into tier 1 fractals in your open world gear without prior information or optimisation of gear and clear them.
---
Training groups for raids are a shortcut, but since usually a few experienced players cover key roles in successful training groups.
---
Both gaming modes have no gear requirements at entry level, but raids are a lot more demanding concerning individual optimisation (micro-positioning as in avoiding red fields etc, dps / boon / healoutput) and strategic optimisation (position of the group and individuals position within the group, anticipation of movement, etc.)
---
To sum it up: any potatoe can enter and consistently clear fractals, but one vg training does not make you a successful raider.

There were also a new ones released just a few weeks ago (first as part of the 4 week pack, and now as stand alone purchase) and there are plenty of people with those skins as well.
---
With the correct (and practiced) rotation Mirage mesmer can inflict over 30 Torment in a relatively short time. Up to 50+ under ideal conditions (pun not intended).
---
The Ambush mechanic means a high percentage of the fight time is spent dodging, i.e. invulnerability, which is responsible for the above mentioned feeling of safety that I also subscribe to.
---
Add to that the runes of Tormenting which, if you have all 6 slotted, heal you in proportion to the Torment applied. This means that I can sometimes fully heal just by performing a successful rotation, while at the same time evading attacks (in fact, I use the heal skill offensively 9 out of 10 times). 
---
Since ambush skills, via traits, apply to clones, you can even back away from the fight and just spam dodges/ambushes, while your clones (which inflict next to zero direct damage) kill average mobs on their own via stacks of Torment. This adds another layer of survivability. 
---
I basically play mesmer since launch and barely know any other classes. But from what I read, these qualitative differences are quite unique and, in my view, fun. Keep that in mind in your rankings.
---
They are meant to be beaten with a group of players, that's it. The level does not have anything with it, this principle is there through whole game. This game does require you to group up with other people to kill tougher mobs, and later on some maps are even dedicated to map-wide groups working together. 
---
Some minibosses are more lucrative to kill and then you can see shoutouts in map chat about them, mentor tags, and people naturally gathering in small group to kill those. Or even opening LFG for them, especially if those are part of some collection or such. Usually there is always someone around to join in fight, though.
---
It is possible to kill most of them solo, but not every build or every class is capable to do it effectively.
---
Anet said "RAID is content" so it's ok", so I guess JPs are not content.
---
there literally is an entire LFG section for personal story, which by definition is solo content. it just happens to have the same option to take people with you like your home instance.
---
i really don't see why looking for help on JPs, which in some cases can be more difficult and frustrating than personal story, and can just as well be aided with by other players, should somehow be an exception. heck, there even is an achievement category on the LFG, and JPs tend to give achievements.
---
They stated multiple times that selling Riads does NOT break any rules they set and thus is not bannable, so no, the Rule was not made to stop Raidselling, if anything, the way they justified it they made it it pretty clear they want Raidselling to be a thing, without actually acknowliding it.
---
I see a hardcore PvE player in a video and they have thousands of gold.  Hardcore WvW player and it’s less than 100g.  Even though we play for the fights, being able to afford stuff sure would be nice.  Instead it’s spent on transfers and build changes so we can keep playing.  What even is gold?  What does it feel like to have?
---
Been ages since I used the old shroud.
---
Good to see that they still have an eye on it.
---
You can try the exchange market.

My advice is build and use

Hi guys,
---
I was planning on starting an mmorpg again and as far it seems gw2 still seems the most fun so I'm planning to pick it back up.
---
I have a lvl 80 ranger and thief and been out for 2/3 years. Any good ideas what I should start doing with to pick it back up?
---
If there are any good friendly guilds with an open spot would be nice too.
---
yeah mmos are traditionally cpu heavy which is why i sprang for a higher cpu and lower gpu. But im also pretty sure i won the silicon lottery with both my cpu and gpu because i was able to OC them no problem well above what was projected
---
ikr? I'm sick of recasting my minions. In some places/occasions it feels like all I do is recast minions.
---
File -&gt; Download, then choose your format
---
OR

File -&gt; Make a copy, and it'll put a version of it on your own google drive

it still works

Beautiful woman.

It's not arbitrary rules. If people buy gems and convert them to gold to buy stuff from LFG it's allowed (i.e. raids) otherwise no.
---
Check the wiki is sometimes the correct answer.
---
We should teach people how to find answers themselves rather than ask someone all the time.
---
That said, a direct link to the correct wiki article is much better than just telling them to search.
---
Raids don't break LFG-selling rules because Anet get money from the people who buy gems and convert to gold in order to buy raid clears. Simple as
---
Interesting.  I always figured it was just buggy, not really a deliberate design choice.
---
Ofc, it doesn't take much to be OP in leveling zones.  Equipping gear is about all you need :)
---
tbh i just wish you had some sort of control over it like the ranger has
---
especially some way to recall them back to you
---
I recently did Siren's Landing on my 4th and 5th characters, and what a difference compared to just having the springer + griffon.  Didn't even need to use a portal to get the POI in Lyssa's Reliq.  
---
I rarely summon my Griffon at all these days, and the only time my Springer comes out is to bunny-bomb the Choya Pinata.
---
Need to save up gems to make sure I'm not stuck on a dead server come relinks
---
I'm all for removing the trigger from AutoModerator
---
&gt; Crafting legendary and selling that one is good way how to liquidate your material storage (if you have a lot of materials stored). Probably not that much worth it if you would be buying materials for it.
---
Except with current material prices, it costs more to craft Dawn than the OP could likely get for selling it.  
---
They would be better off using the Dawn as the precursor, then selling all the mats they would have used to make their own Dawn, or save them for the next Legendary they want.
---
F
---
More like, you find a more convinient solution afterwards and make it an own thing instead of crippling already existing cities. 
---
It would be just ugly to have everything in a small place in a city, it would destroy the aesthetics. And to be fair, the "problem" is that you have to walk a few steps more than in lounges.
---
wow, are we talking 100+ in a full on zerg v zerg scenario? 
---
cz thats insane.
---
Thank you! :D
---
&gt; the problem I have is that I’m grinding by myself 
---
Heart of Thorns *really* benefits from groups for unlocking the hero points. Ask in map chat - someone *will* help you and often a few people will stick around and do a few together. 
---
A build like [this one](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Sword/x_Phantasms) might help you as it's a good balance between offence and defence. Sword and shield both have a (timed) block and aegis from the well allows you to block another move. 
---
Also, check your gear is all exotic (or ascended) and has stats that help you. It's absolutely worth getting a set of 6 runes that match. Valkyrie stuff is good for open world stuff as it gives you decent damage output and extra hit points until you're comfortable and can swap it for something with slightly more damage. 
---
Heart of Thorns *is* hard for a new level 80 - don't worry. We all went through the same nightmare. 
---
Also, your English is great!
---
I wouldn't call raid and fractals a "large chunk of pve", but anyway. Yeah, he's probably not a good player, so what? You don't have to be a good player to enjoy the game. Heck, some people just join in, do some RP in lion's arch and that's it.
---
I just don't like the general direction that one has to be (or get) "good" and be able to do all the things and therefore must learn all the aspects of the game.
---
I think, a good game provides a large variety of options and then each player decides what part of it he likes and does that. And it is NOT the goal to (be able to) do all of it.
---
My quote refers to raid selling and your quote proces do they officially allow such 'sales'.
---
&gt;In fact, I'm pretty sure few of the most healthy gw2 players pretty much only play WvW, they just flip the TP during the off times
---
90% wvw player, been doing this for years =D
---
It's not the cost that's the problem. It's the fact that there's very little satisfaction from just buying skins. I want to earn them through completing content. Not mindlessly grind for gold in order to buy them in the cash shop.
---
I have, like, the opposite approach to my chrono so it's really interesting reading another person't playstyle. I wouldn't *dream* of running Inspiration and greatsword is my mirage farming weapon. 
---
Sword/sword/shield 4 lyfe (although focus is pretty good too). 
---
I have literally never used feedback or blink in combat outside of PvP. 
---
Thanks for posting all that - it's great to see how others play.
---
Because its objectively worse. Braindead gameplay = no gameplay. If you want passive effects and pretty much just pressing 1-2 buttons, go play WoW or something.
---
Druids change was really smart. You can heal your own pets and keep them alive longer and you're required to have some kind of map awareness to keep buffs next to the stack. Before that, you dropped those things and they would stay there for the entire kill, you wouldn't even touch the skills again. Thats fun?
---
We already have easy classes that press only or 2 keys. Also, no one forces you to take the minions. If you want passive gameplay take the signets. Or hell, still take the minions but don't use them properly. We should advocate for shit gameplay just because some people don't like it?
---
Just a point that I'd like to make before you get farther into the game
---
Armor class is not really the best indicator of tankiness in general in this game. Heavy armor classes have slightly higher defense than medium armor and light armor classes, but, especially as you get into the later game, that difference becomes a matter of maybe 1 to 2 extra hits before you're downed
---
I didn't share my opinion with my question, not sure why my opinion is any relevant to knowing why spamming things is fun.
---
People seem to like that sort of thing, unfortunately. FFXIV's warrior of light literally is the center of that game's universe (nothing important ever happens in that world without your involvement) and everyone praises that story.
---
I like vignette style storytelling more, because it gives the MMO a chance to be a world. But it can be hard to engage players with a bunch of different characters, especially if you do it in quick succession like the vanilla Living Story did.
---
[does the page look like this to you?](https://imgur.com/xyHU0Vx.png)
---
The problem you are not addressing is what is meaningful content.
---
You're arguing no meaningful content has been added to wvw but only recently we have had the war law. 
---
If you are arguing that their has been no meaningful content you should explain what is meaningful content first. Because otherwise his/her point was a counterexample because content was added which is meaningful to some people

I'm up for farming the gifts, right? But I don't have materials laying around to craft a legendary. Thanks for the tips.
---
I'm also on chrome.
---
I'm not sure why you can't see the tabs, now that's really odd. [For the missing bar at the top, do you see the arrow in the top-right?](https://imgur.com/11dJ6xQ.png). When I click on that, it collapses the top bar and makes everything disappear (or reappear) for me

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V8vd2ibDPI) a video of GW1 dances for anyone looking! (for some reason, the male warrior dance is sped up, but the rest of them are fine.)
---
And [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcR5vxI1AMs) an awesome MV made by someone using the GW1 dances!
---
I disagree. GW2's writing made me cringe far more than GW1, and more than most games in general.
---
It is a bit lackluster. People say it's hardly even worthy of being in a Black Lion weapon collection. No-one makes it because it isn't as flashy as say, Nevermore or Exordium.
---
But it's that fact which makes it attractive to me. No-one ever makes it. I never comes across other people that have Sharur.
---
I have a few legendaries but Sharur is the one I receive comments on the most. It's a point of conversation.
---
In an **MM**ORPG, that's make it legendary-worthy. For me, at least.
---
....Anet literally confirmed people do this a while back because they kept banning people who received the gold (as the buyer had bought it from 3rd party sites instead of with gems)
---
You didn't even share the two locations you know?
---
I've been using a spot in Bitterfrost for peppercorns. At the end of the jumping puzzle at the hot sprints there's two herb nodes right next to each other. Parked my alts and have been grabbing them every couple hours. The price has dropped a lot already, though peppercorns do seem to be the highest demand of the seeds.
---
Well done ArenaNet, well fucking done.
---
Sounds like you're fucked. If the ingame skins don't meet your taste, grinding gold instead of grinding whatever other currency and materials the ingame rewards require is too boring AND just paying for a sub is no alternative, you have no options left.
---
God damnit this sub really likes to hunt down every little tidbit just to make A-Net seem like they're imploding.
---
lol thx a lot man, these solves many problems of mine honestly. I was thinking about using some runes perm the running speed. i think guardian is the best for what i asked. fast kills.
---
There are people that pay for those gifts around as well, though. This goes in a way that they provide resources and you provide gifts and crafting, so you still get profit from your time (to do the gifts) but don't need to get the rest of resources. 
---
But that is already quite advanced trade and I think you would have to look for those people. And not all of them can be risk-free.
---
So it all stil lcomes towards the "how fast you need gold", I would say.
---
Then, my bad.
---
How about actually try to play the game? There are so many youtube videos available for every JP. Just follow them step by step.
---
I'm not all interested in Sunrise to be honest. Thanks for the tips.
---
Condi mirage is actually quite strong in open world if you keep moving and they can make a lot of annoying mobs like titled (elite, vet, legendary) and Hydra melt extremely fast with confusion.
---
&gt; Raid selling does NOT break the rules.
---
Then neither should jump puzzle selling.
---
You pay for content to be done for you in both.
---
The easiest would be to just borrow them the gold they need to buy the gems.
---
Not just planets. [Moons too.](https://youtu.be/pHOnGSFzd3Y?t=53)
---
It could be positive if everyone had access to it straight out the gate, and if they listened to concerns the community had from the get go.
---
Now it just excludes new players or those without PoF, made defending even easier, and introduced even more exploits. It had potential, and just like everything else that anet tries to bring to WvW it was poorly thought out and implemented and did more harm than good.
---
No arrow. Here's what I see
---
https://imgur.com/zVwZ5Cm

I just love [Sharur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/8/83/Sharur_day_draw_effect.jpg/674px-Sharur_day_draw_effect.jpg)! It's the best! It's like taking a part of a [swimming pool](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=1920x400:format=jpg/path/s197cdb5c9deeeff5/image/i6ea4166b72c24aea/version/1520516265/image.jpg) with you! And at night it's kinda creepy. But all without the over the top flashy stuff. That it is so underrepresented is a bonus.
---
A couple of things. One, look up youtuber Woodenpotatoes. He is preparing to release a series of open world builds, specifically designed of what you are talking about, for every class. 
---
The other thing is that Heart of Thorns represents a spike in difficulty going forward with the game. A lot of the hero challenges expect you to complete it with a small group (like two or three people). They can be soloed, but typically only for those looking for a challenge. 
---
Outside of that, I can't help too much since I don't play too much mesmer.
---
By my assessment FFXIV has the advantage of more consistent narrative pacing, as well as far greater use of cutscenes to emphasize main story moments. It also keeps to the standard MMO convention of your character being a cardboard cutout (with the addition of enough meaningless dialogue options to keep players attached) where GW2 took a risk by giving the Commander a distinct character, which has paid off in some areas but proven problematic in others, and tends to deliver its story in fewer, larger chunks. I personally think the actual plot, writing and VA of GW2 are a fair bit better, but FFXIV has far stronger presentation (with the exception of facial animation, something else GW2 does very well).
---
I used to visit him, to just sit and listen to him play, just because. Was so disappointed that he wasn’t selling any CDs. 😭
---
Well for "plain as day".. exactly the paragraph you copied prohibts EVERYTHING but selling a spot in a group. lol
---
("Players may use the tool to sell a spot in a group [...] but they may not use it [...] for any other purpose.")
---
haha wow... in all those screenshots, so am I. Now I'm really intrigued.
---
Is this a joke?
---
how about you remember your password or write it down somewhere instead like normal players, who dont have any problems to log in?
---
Buying, at the least, Bitterfrost Frontier (A Crack in the Ice) is a way better value for your gold than gearing characters in exotic trinkets. Also, you have Dragonfall which can get you ascended rings, earrings, and an amulet for map currency
---
&gt; they transfer conditions fairly quickly from you to foes
---
from a trait
---
&gt; have a ton of health, practically immune on aoes
---
if they aren't being targeted
---
&gt; and take agro off of you almost all the time.
---
enemy aggro isn't all that reliable ...
---
&gt; Maybe lower the pve hp of minions?
---
For that  I just want a keybind to toggle making minions unselectable.
---
&gt; The biggest change i can imagine is making minion skills have increased dmg, lower cooldown time, but make them all have permanent health degeneration such as those shambling horrors (think its 3.5% hp loss per second)
---
I think making them more active would be good. Of course all the people who just want to AFK their way through things will disagree. Maybe overhaul staff to have some minion support stuff?
---
So if I just give some random dude in LA some gold for no reason. I'll get banned??
---
You can be pusher as firebrand at desmina... That's something...
---
Unless they provide some substantial performance improvements, I’ll stick with Boot Camp for OSX. I’m on a MacPro “Trashcan” workstation, and get 12fps on low with subsampling in OSX, or ~60fps with most things cranked in Bootcamp with D912pxy.
---
Because it's pretty much the same thing. Noone is (creating) gold here. Its just changing hands.
---
...I completely forgot about the mac client.
---
Has got to be an immense amount of work to keep that stupid thing supported. Double the QA, double the bug fixing, double basically everything.
---
Since when defending an active gameplay style that this game's combat system totally supports, that in any way affects casual gameplay (because you can always play sub-par and still get shit done) be considered an elitist stance?
---
Get over yourself dude, people these days throw words randomly and think they're doing society a favor.
---
Hi guys, a noob question:  
---
Is there any viable mesmer build for conquest (doesn't have to be meta) that uses both a staff and a focus?  
---
If yes, what main hand, amulet and sigil can it use?  
---
Thank you!
---
It only lasted for a year, tho. They added the limit in the anniversary update in 2006.
---
Don't forget your stupid password then. How can people be this stupid and blame others for their own mistakes... I hate it
---
I mean... I needed 3 different sets of ascended armor (for 3 different toons) so I could best match what my squad needs.
---
That's not cheap!
---
Yeah I do when i play regularly but it has been a year so i had deleted the launcher causing it to forget my pw.
---
how many hours per day would you say you spend in the game? 
---
or per week
---
What if you had a participation link with someome of your choosing? If you linked up with a dps you would get the bags that they get, but only if your dps is really low to keep people from abusing it. That could be a thing right?
---
Where in lfg did you post your request?
---
If you are forced to change your password, you are probably using the same password in too many places, and the GW2 login server has detected your password in a dictionary of stolen passwords and it won't allow that password to be used again. 
---
Using the same password everywhere is really, really bad idea. 
---
If you have problems remembering your password, use a password manager tool like KeePass or Dashlane.
---
I can't tell if you're joking or not, but there are some tricks for this.  
---
On your phone or computer, save a document that has a list of colors and then a website next to that color.
---
Then, write your password on a sticky note that matches the same color as the website you wrote down on that document.  Then put your sticky notes in an empty snack bag locked inside your desk.
---
A dude I was gifting 100g was banned for a few days cause of suspicion of gold sell. Maybe he did after he get the gold from me. I don’t know. But it was kinda funny.
---
I know mine because I use the same name everywhere and because I've been playing for seven years. My wife was an entirely different beast. Thank God I had some old screenshot with the full name of her character.
---
open world &gt; parties   
---
got suspend after like 2mins
---
did you get your 3 jp's yet? EU/NA?
---
Same here.  I've generally run with smaller guilds so being able to flex between classes was pretty common.  10+ sets of ascended gear across all professions with their foods that changed from time to time.  Its crazy.  I eventually made a legendary set and probably should do the other two armor types but I don't raid with a guild anymore so its not really that important to min/max my builds.
---
You can make a secure note of which underwear you was wearing in 2014, in lastpass app. That in-stead would help you recover the password at any time in future.
---
Now all we need is for someone to make Sans and itll be GG
---
Thank you very much for letting me know! I had to go to sleep before the countdown ended, but I did get my pledge in so I'll go through the upgrade process now.
---
Uses Choya Pinata Tonic
---
What but that requires effort! No one wants to put any effort in! People need about a minute to understand some builds and that would be a minute too much!
---
(Sarcasm)
---
\[Fluff\] I mean... yes.
---
I guess it's more a thing of hammer being relativly bad in PvE. I would make it INSTANTLY if necro gets it with a new elite spec though.
---
I guess the same reason why there's Day One Release Trailers for big name games...and I'm not sure what that reason is tbh.
---
If current cities are still like ever even with lounges existing, then how would adding new ones be bad ? Lounges do exactly that, pushing every vendor and crafting station together. 
---
Asking for a new place in a new area that functions the same is too much ? Besides they removed TP access from those some time ago. I really don't see what the big deal would be about adding some more of these places ( with TP access ) It only matters to you if you want to keep people buying free lounge passes and buy a solution to something Anet themselves created the problem for.
---
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! You don't NEED to, but the gameplay is much smoother and more comfortable if you do! If you never enter a fractal or raid, there's literally NO POINT in setting up a non-optimal raid build for a gamemode you'll literally never play.
---
Is this the only teaser for today?
---
The problem I have with Kourna is that it's a long ass run from either waypoint or portal tome so if you're logging multiple characters for as many yields as you can get, it's kind of shitty in that regard. You're not wrong though; it's a good spot for cilantro.
---
I've also tried that Timberline route several times and I was not happy with the yield / spread of herbs.
---
I find Mint really easy at Lake Doric. Take the NW waypoint. Head east to in Noland's Homestead to the leather farm rest spot, where they put all the banners. Then head south from that to the forest.
---
Much of any rework should wait for next LS anyway.
---
Someone isn't a D&amp;D player with beloved characters. I always will know the names of six characters in my account at least because they are all names of characters I have played in D&amp;D and other games as well. Hell, one is my name here on reddit. 
---
Remembering character names is really not difficult.
---
did you learn nothing? you're not charging for your help with JPs, you're selling JP completion guides for a a little g. 
---
Or other way around, etc.
---
They can get to SW through Brisbane Wildlands and can farm for gold from there
---
At least you didn't mistakingly salvage Dawn because all the previous steps had you do that, two weeks ago and are still waiting for a GM response...
---
I guess next time you could offer tips instead without stating any exchange of gold. 
---
But yeah this is getting ridiculous...
---
Here to add in two cents- whether you use it on your first character or not, *do not* throw it away. After you commit to using it on a character, you get [all sort of other stuff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Level-80_Boost_Package), like [your choice of some very expensive dyes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebratory_Dye_Pack). (The most expensive dye you can currently get from it is about 300 gold on the trading post.) 
---
And if you decide to not use it for levels, you can still use it on a level 80 character. It doesn't give you any exp, but it still gives you the boost package.
---
\*prologue. Episode 1 won't be release for some time.
---
Sell dawn for quick money. Craft Sunrise and sell it for more profit but you need explo and wvw Gift + Gold for mats. Craft Sunrise pay for acc bound twilight and sell eternity for even more profit.
---
"i forgot my password, fuck ArenaNet"
---
.......you can't be serious.
---
What exact words did you use to ask for help, exactly?
---
&gt; kinda funny
---
unintentionally getting someone banned is "kinda funny"??????
---
One person like me who isn't a Mac person but gets stuck supporting them anyway.
---
&gt; If current cities are still like ever even with lounges existing, then how would adding new ones be bad ? Lounges do exactly that, pushing every vendor and crafting station together. 
---
Probably mostly because the teleport stones and the prominence. Lounges are a thing because the places you mentioned are (more or less) unknown and only the "real" cities plus ebonhawke has teleport stones which existance also is pretty unknown.
---
&gt; I really don't see what the big deal would be about adding some more of these places ( with TP access )
---
Tbh I would rather like to see a new city instead of a free lounge. Make a collection that rewards you with a teleport stone (or just make it buyable) and all sides should be happy.
---
What exactly is the intended context? I presume you exclude fractals and raids because we have dedicated sites for that but do you want general purpose builds, strong solo options, least effort/skill required, cheapest, most convenient to switch to a raid build or something completely different?
---
For example GS chrono makes mincemeat out of anything the open wilds can throw at you but I would never dare recommend it to a bearbow main. Nor can it carry a failing worldboss group like a diviner firebrand(/chrono) might.
---
I agree. If I get a skin , whether from the store or an achieve , I get it for my own design , for me to look at.
---
o/
---
Same
---
There is an entire section for achievements and living story, neither is group content.
---
Anet fucked up here.
---
It's not over the top or completely out there. It's a good looking hammer with bonus effects. Some people want the special effects and footfalls, but also want a more (relatively) grounded design. My personal opinion is that I quite like its Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of gimmick. The only real problem I have is that I dont use hammer that much, so I wouldn't use it that much if I crafted it. Plus I am still working on the Shining Blade, and after getting a taste of what it's like to make a gen 2 legendary I think I'll be good for a while.
---
Heart of Thorns is brutal.  Path of Fire hero points are just as good, and don't require taking down champions.
---
Open world power quickbrand is great. Perma self quickness for combat and gathering, mobility and damage from GS, Condi cleanse on f2-2. Pulls on f1-3, it's my go to for open world content. 
---
The build is easy to gear. It's full berserker with GS/Scepter Focus. You can also run sword instead of scepter for more mobility.
---
4: The growth of some things prevents the growth of others. If all things have the right to grow, then surely they have the right to do whatever they must to grow?

5: "Wrong" is subjective... and relative.

6: "Act with wisdom, but act" applies to anything, from the most altruistic to the most depraved action. "Wisdom", here, has nothing to do with morals.
---
I had arc, templates and ReShade all at the same time, ReShade in Root, rest in bin64 but don't remember the naming of tge DLL's. They all worked fine, dx12 thing aswell, messed up portraits and shader load times as an indicator of that. These days I only have arc and dx12 so unless something has been changed on the way how dx12 works, it should still work as I did it.
---
I tried to follow the instructions with reshade from the author of dx12 but never got it to work that way, then I ended up messing with stuff until I got it to work and that's how I did it.
---
Original ReShade into root (not the compiled one that some user made) Arc as D3d9.dll in Bin64 and dx12 as chainload iirc. I don't have the same setup anymore that I had when I made the original comment you replied to.
---
Yes , I agree lootboxes are predatory
---
But , in GW2 , I still doubt if you cut outfit or mount skin prices in half , that they would sell more. Plus , an outfit in GW2 is like $9. In POE a full set of armor skins is around $ 40-50. And in POE there are no decent in-game skins , unlike GW2. Everyone looks like a hobo , no matter how strong. Unless they spend. So GW2 isn't that bad ( in comparison).
---
This was a huge problem in Wrath 3/4 the way through that expansion. People wouldn't let dudes with gear worse than what dropped in heroic dungeons into their groups. If you tried to use the LFG tool people would bitch and afk until you left or were booted. Because you didn't have gear *better* than what dropped in the dungeon.
---
It was freakin dumb.
---
That's not what a title is.
---

It's hard to tell from the twitter video quality, but to my eye the GW2 clip looks very much in-engine - standard textures and models, nothing to indicate a higher level of rendering. GW2 doesn't actually have many pre-rendered cutscenes as they are more work, can take longer to load, and by necessity can't include the player character, and I see no reason why this one would be any different.
---
There was more range in terms of skills with ranger in guild wars 1 that just wasn’t brought over to gw2
---
this won't end well
---
Staff/staff is a very common mirage build. Lots of mobility and decent condi damage and boons. 
---
Focus is a tougher one, but it would pair well enough with scepter and give you a bit of range.  
---
Go for condi damage, so an amulet that provides condition damage and a bit of power.
---
&gt;Hardcore WvW player
---
Lol, time to graduate to sPVP.
---
hey, im time traveler from the present to answer your comment that we just found out it indeed is against the rules :))))
---
Keep crying I'm sure customer support can fix your degeneracy eventually.
---
No, but since I stopped playing GW2 for awhile I missed/skipped the story that showed you this amazing fellow I never knew about him till the last post about him.
---
As a wider warning, *all* 32-bit games (and software generally) will become unplayable if you upgrade to Catalina as they're removing backwards compatibility. 
---
Newer games should be okay or have already released a patch, but older stuff may become unplayable.
---
I'm very impressed they're keeping the client going.  I am  relieved. 
---
Thank you, ArenaNet.
---
Good job and a nice look. Enjoy!
---
Slow clap 😁
---
First person I'm seeing who has made that hammer.
---
There are only 762 people with it on efficiency. Hipster af
---
I'm pretty sure you don't, but it has been a long time since I messed with the setup, so I could be forgetting something. I'm certain you don't need to enable any special settings within gw2hook, at least.
---
Lucky you. It doesn’t run well at all on the MacPro. I could use the Transgaming client without issue, but their “native” binary runs terribly. I get decent performance on my significantly less powerful retina MacBook Pro 15”, but that machine also has Boot Camp installed.
---
The irony is that the WvW child is smart, farming gold to transfer gems is the worst possible gem/hour you can imagine unless you live in a 3rd world country :), spending 20 hours in silverwastes, or spending 2 hours at a job, I know what I prefer :)
---
3... counting yesterday maybe 10.
---
You should craft yourself some bags with more slots and when your lv 20 you can get 20 slots bag easily from fractals.
---
Depends on the request.  Account recovery gets backed up whenever there is a big promotion/sale, like with the recent bundling of HoT.
---
As long as you got an email confirming they received your request, then they will get back to you.  My guess is it'll happen before the weekend.
---
I love it!
---
The details of it are really nice, im glad i made it instead of being a chrome boy. Congrats you'll spook your friends for weeks when it turns to night
---
Fb tomes reset on some raid encounters lifting it easily into S tier. It can also buff quickness and is the most overloaded spec. Tons of support and buffs, very bursty. It does just everything
---
It's not that bad. After watching a guide on YT you'll feel less confused during encounter. Knowledge over dps.

---
I run Axe/Torch + Staff.  Pistol is considered meta, but frankly, I've never really like it.  The odd time I've done fractals I'll run Focus for Temporal Curtain.
---
Staff is really good for fighting something tough, like a champ, from range.  You can easily keep up 3 clones to distract and your ambush skill can light them up fairly effectively (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex).  I was able to solo many of the HoT heropoint champs, again wearing full glass (Viper) gear.  Between the clones, cloak, invis and the steady healing from Runes, so long as you can dodge the big hits, you'll eventually wear them down.

Many condi mesmers recommend running Chaos trait, and unless you're running Trailblazer, you're not losing much by swapping to Chaotic Dampening from Chaotic Transference.
---
I'm considering trying out Power Mirage just to see the difference in burst, but it will have less sustain because you won't get the healing from Tormenting runes.

Kinda strange that you can sell slots of your group but you cannot buy people for your group.

Last time i filed a report i got a response in 24hrs and had my refund soon after
---
How does the daily cap and reset work for the harvestable map currencies?
---
I’m working on the skyscale saddle achievement where you have to collect 250 of each of the living world map currencies.
---
It seems like each map currency might be capped somewhere around 50 per account per day?  I’ll go harvest a map and end up with 30 to 40, then start harvesting on another character, somewhere around 50 the harvesting nodes seem to disappear and are not there anymore.
---
As for when they reset... seems like it takes almost 24 hours, but maybe not a full 24 for them to reset? This part has been very confusing. I’ll seem to cap out early in the evening but then a couple hours later the nodes are there again and I can harvest more.
---
Depends if you compare super organized speed runs in a speedclear static or the average 400li pug because FB can be really good on lots of bosses there. Including sloth and gorseval and xera.
---
You have nearly 4k karma. Surely you know how to use Reddit properly :/
---
Why not just do it at the same time?? Would be much more efficient
---
Wouldn't you save a ton of money and stress by just buying the precursor off the TP? For anything other than like, Twilight?

Is that the minimum number of waypoints and POI that end up being completed after doing all the hearts, or is it possible to go even lower?
---
Mac is supported at my studio and most developers have a MacBook for that reason. Virtually everyone still develops on PC and just uses the Macs to test that their changes build, performance/stability unit tests pass, and to deploy to iOS.
---
Having to work on a Mac port or fix a Mac specific bug is like drawing the short straw.
---
If its not fake... then why? How? ... This should have been on twitch.
---
I'm pretty sure this ideology is backwards according to most people I've seen do map comp.
---
Good idea. Yes. I can put out more information on that. I can also out more information on the Silverwastes bags of gear as well. Thanks for that!
---
They get banned periodically in waves, not immediately when you report them. Also if there is a human available to respond to GM prompts, they aren't defined to be AFK farmers, so you could see them forever.
---
Lol no they’re both the first picture
---
If ANet would say that they do not tolerate raid selling, than the already low raid community would leave the game, and the already non-existent harcore community would disappear, thats why they close eyes above raid selling, this doesnt mean that asking for help should be punished like this, well, ANet is on destroying its leftup community base, all i can say is that I congratulate them on going on a path like this
---
Definitely possible to go lower. I got a few by accident (not watching where I was going). You could probably min/max it by checking all the maps on the wiki or another computer and then planning a route. I wasn't that obsessed with it :)
---
Here we can see a wild madlad in its natural habitat, careful kids.
---
This method of map completion is pure madness. 
---
Madness I say.
---
True endgame!
---
I WvW a lot with hammer rev so that's why I made it. Just in time to get nerfed!
---
Tier A isn't bad at all. Another spec I put there, condi weaver, becomes really strong on a lot of bosses as soon as phase times go down just a bit.
---
Just not like rene/mirage, which are unquestionably the best choice on their bosses in any situation. And even those specs are so insanely good only on specific bosses and only in  raids.
---
Jeweling is getting cap raised to 500, so it will most definitely have some use in end game.
---
A bit, yeah.
---
I was very pleasantly surprised to see all the moving pieces on it! You don't get that with the wiki screenshots.
---
what are you wearing? :O
---
You are a madman
---
agreed
---
Everyone is different. As I said in the snippet you quoted, how you dealt with it is different than how other people may deal with it.
---
For myself, it's easier to talk to a stranger online about things for a couple of reasons. Some of those strangers can even become close friends.
---
The first is that they don't know who I am. Even my best online friends (some of which rank higher than real life friends) don't know my real name, age or location. The most they know is the state I live in. They can't do anything with that information to hurt me anymore than how I'm already feeling. I can block them and have nothing to do with them if they opt to be insensitive assholes while speaking to those who do care or, at least, act like they care to help me feel better.
---
The second is that I don't have to worry about what I say being used as ammunition against me should our relationship go south. I have good friends online that are extremely supportive of me. It's nothing but verbal communications and I don't feel obligated to talk to them if I don't want to. They don't know my other online friends as they're spread across various mediums, so they can't spread the information to them.
---
My RL friends and family, on the other hand, I can't get away from them. They can drop in unexpectedly, they can use what I say against me if we have an argument and tell all my other friends. I'm bi-sexual. In my family, that's a big deal. So, they don't know. My dating habits are kept away from them. Very few of my friends know and that's because they found out. Now, every time they come by my place, I worry they'll let it slip. I've had one ex-friend use the fact that I was hurt (doesn't matter how in this discussion) as ammunition in an argument. It hurt to have that used against me and I couldn't just walk away from it while it was happening. I couldn't just close the chat tab or shut down discord to get away from it. Oh, and don't let me forget to mention that this argument took place in a public area where others around got to hear about my troubled past.
---
People online are much like Real Life therapists/councilors/psychologists. You can choose to no longer go to their office and speak with them. They won't come looking for you if you decide to do so. They can't speak to your family or friends about you unless they're given written consent to do so, except in the case where they think you're a danger to yourself or others. You can get away from them, basically.
---
One of the best looking weapon Imo. Congratulations !
---
hey everyone here making me second guess myself lol, i just dont ever see any stutter and anything under 90fps i can notice so thats what im going on. It could be that ive been playing too much console Apex lately which is hard locked at 60fps so by comparison 70-80ish would look smooth. Im also running boarder-less window'd at 1440p, we will see this weekend. Ill record on obs both my game and a resource monitor as well as show off my overclock settings. Ill run it in both 1080p full screen and 1440p full screen to get accurate results. I could be completely lying through my teeth but at this point even im not 100% sure. If i get some free time this week ill play around with setting and post a reddit thread with what i found works the best. Either way it will be a nice comparison for mid range modern systems
---
Condi weaver has a hard looking rotation at first, but after looking at it many times its clear why you do certain things in a way you do them.Also, on golem cWeaver has the highest DPS and the highest burst of all classes(condi classes) and not with only just one build but with more than one weaponset, it does really good damage, but on bosses like Dhuum or Matt who move a lot can place cWeaver behind against a renegade because cWeaver uses bleeding and burning as main DPS source, and renegade uses torment wich is doing 1.5x damage is the target is moving(? not sure about the exact multipication) also, if the boss moves a lot then it moves out of your AoEs so you lose a bit of damage. Overally its a very good dps, but comes with an annoying thing of having more than 1k toughness so it may cause some tanking issues if the chrono is too low on tougness(i think if the chrono is 1.3k or more its fine)
---
True.
---
Tybalt, recap
---
Probably for legendary trinkets which are quite irrelevant considering that ascended ones are basically free.
---
Besides, it's not available at the moment so there's no point of maxing it at all.
---
THIS! IS!! how I have fun in gw2 pls no flamerino!
---
Yes, let's ignore all those other PvE/PvP botters and cheaters who teleport around the map and concentrate on those true evil persons asking for help in the LFG!

Addendum:

Throw password paper in trash bin, forget it completely, bring trash outside and watch nearby residents go check it.

A random service man comes in with his own keys without permission, does his job (fixes dishwasher, fridge etc.) and steals something.
---
maybe it should be specified what type of PvE then, not everything is raids, and mirage is trash in both open world and fractals, except some weird specific cases like djinns
---
common sense dictates that a material that has a small amount of applications, is hard / tedious to get and not needed by most people would not be held in abundance by the majority of the playerbase. it's not rocket science. you don't need statistics for everything, especially such a basic line of thinking like this. i'm absolutely not in the wrong, the game does *not* throw obsidian shards at you, the sources for them are few and far between. so you say that i am not allowed to make assumptions based on common sense and simple reasoning, yet you are making an assumption based on less and saying the opposite? you keep using "common sense" in the wrong way, as a petty, spiteful way to try, and fail, to disprove me. the fact of the matter is, you are wrong and you aren't happy about it, that's it.
---
how many lady bushes do you actually get PMed?
---
It is called "Fashion Wars" not "Good Fashion Wars" for a reason
---
That message is received everytime you get banned. It's a copy paste. Same thing as the whole "we can't promise we can replace your item next time you send a ticket in" thing.
---
Am i the only one Who completed every map one after another?
---
Platinum ingots and cheaper shard/crystal/orb upgrading compared to buying on TP. Both of them are mostly irrelevant.
---
It's not, actually. They temp banned people for selling access to their home instance gardens too via LFG menu. They're being, for whatever reason, very strict with people selling anything in LFG. I have a feeling it's because they want to make abundantly clear that the LFG system is not to be used as an alternative for the TP, and they want to cut down on scams that are completely untraceable. 
---
Bottom line is: don't say WTB or WTS in LFG, except for raids and fractal groups I suppose.

Does ArenaNet define personal story to be solo content, or is that just "us"? I only play the personal story with at least one other player in my group at a time. We both get credit at the same time for doing it. It's very different from the actual solo-only personal stories of, say, FFXIV or ESO. I would say that under ArenaNet's definitions, the personal story is considered group content, and that's why it received its own category in Looking For Group.
---
18 poi? No way this aint fake
---
Late to the party, but the map breakout area in the Grove is also good.  I don't have any images on hand, but it's the big area outside the map filled with little blue wisps.
---
Haha I’m one of them.  I love that hammer, it’s one of my favorite skins
---
Hammer Guardian in PvP it is.
---
If you would like to get to chrono a little faster,  look for an HP Train that starts in Verdant Brink and goes to all areas.  You will have chronomancer completed before you even finish.  Usually the train has lots of people on it, and  you're pretty safe.  If you do die, someone is always there to rez you so you can complete your task.  Just take a look at LFG for a train...they're pretty frequent  and good luck!  =D
---
I would suggest maybe a book or something that you have in your home were you write down important passwords that might fall off from your memory. Just make sure to keep the book on a spot were others can not get access to it. Been a life saver for me many times.
---
Hammer Rev in WvW 🤤
---
Yeah, that's likely. My friends and I don't gift anything of value to each other anymore, unless it's through the gemstore gifting system. The banning system is hyper-aggressive.
---
I will never understand how people can leave a map unfinished when doing map completion.
---
I guess that also depends on other factors as well. For personal use I don't really need to do that with more than 3 characters and I use the glyph of bounty. Around once every 3 months with 3 characters should be enough.
---
The good players I saw always died and I solo'd it then. xD
---
&gt; How does the daily cap and reset work for the harvestable map currencies?
---
It seems to vary by map and by currency with no real rime or reason. Every 23 hours seems to be the base node respawn timer, but some are also governed by a per-character cap and some by an account cap and some seem to respawn at a fixed time of day, or on a new map instance if they have variable locations. 
---
tldr: Varies by currency. Consistently inconsistent between maps.
---
In LA at the jumping puzzle were you jump around whole LA, close to the end chest there are several nodes and i think at least 2 of them are herbs. They are easy to jump up too with your mount.
---
Sandswept Isle also have a location with all kinds of gathering nodes and there is also many herb nodes on other spots.
---
I came up with a cheese method for ALL hearts that have one. I completed most maps over 30 times.
---
And there's people who have done them over twice more times than me.
---
That only helps cementing which ones are the worst.
---
This is the textbook definition of witch hunting. This post has no substance, the screenshot is of a generic ban notification, OP can claim that it was for anything he wants you to believe.
---
And no, it doesn't line up very well with previous threads about the topic.
---
Actually skyscale is an amazing mount once you max it and learn it, it completely erases the springer in every aspect possible while being an all purpose tool instead of a jumping machine. With bond of vigor you leap 4 times in any angle and can cover amazing distances while you can combo it very successfully with the griffon by gaining a shitload of height, dismounting on air and taking griffon while gliding. I use it like 80% of the time and i truly feel it is overpowered.
---
As for the collection yeah, it was badly implemented.
---
The quartz nodes in Crystal Oasis are the only ones character-bound.  
---
There's 2 small nodes in the Forged areas, then a Rich one at the top of the mines. The rich one can be easily reached directly without going through the mines with a skyscale. 
---
All other quartz nodes in Dry Top (9 non-bonus gatherings, plus 10 gatherings in a rich node) and he Labyrinthine cliffs (21 non-bonus gatherings) store their gathering account-wide.
---
Hearts gave you stockholms did they
---
Because selling raids is not against the rules. You, however, risk being banned for abuse of the report system.
---
Every condi build except maybe weaver and fb in low dps pugs are trash in fractals. Mirage isnt that bad open world. Its good to solo some champs and can break some bounty bosses with confusion.
---
i am confused by how u even did these hearts without getting any waypoint in this map
---
whats suspicious about it? (considering they've suspended people for selling/ buying access to home instances
---
Na that's fine. I'll do it old school. I enjoy the story anyhow :-)
---
Hehe, yea, people sure are quick to jump the gun based on just one side of the story.
---
crying in holo, why doesn't anybody body else want arthritis!
---
I don’t understand why you would do that to yourself , the better way (IMO) is to complete the zone THEN move on to the next ... now you have to go back and just run around each zone mindlessly ..why tho :(
---
I hope this is fake , it’s making me upset
---
ummm, exordium doesn't have a trail either and isn't flashy, bad example. lots of ppl think exordium is underwhelming too
---
I'm impressed he even knew of the first three seasons, given that he died early in the personal story and didn't live to see any of it ;)
---
If you gather in Rata Sum, you can do the daily crafting there and then go straight to the home instance.   
---
Rata sum has the home instance nodes in a small circle, gathering there is the fastest.  The crafting stations are scattered, but they are just a raptor jump away from the central area, and the waypoints are so close together you don't get loading screens from the central one to any of the others within the city cube.
---
I do the daily crafting in Mistlock Sanctuary, which is ever better.
---
I'd love a spec where you can directly control mobs. Summon,  direct,  dismiss.
---
Finally. The one piece I needed for a character. Now it shall be mine!
---
It can get done pretty fast during the Behemoth. The shades and aatxes spawned by the event count towards the heart.  
---
I can't remember if the imps, fleshreavers and dhuum skeletons count, so they problably don't.
---
Unfortunately, the behemoth events themselves do not count.  The fairest thing would always completing a heart when you complete a meta-event within it.
---
&gt;I like that they're threatening to terminate your account if you continue asking for help with jumping puzzles.
---
They did the same thing to me when I was pressing the matter about an accidental infusion over-write.
---
Really late to this but as a casual its taken weeks for me to finally get around to this so id say youre right, the first 3 mounts were obviously easy, gryphon so long as you had the cash ready werent really that bad tbh but holy shit the time requirement to unlock the skyscale is nuts, ive been going for ages and still havent finished all the collections, atleast the gryphon is game changing imo once you unlock it, the skyscale from any use of it ive had from the ones around the map just feels clunky and useless 95% of the time, great for afking in LA though haha
---
Sidenote : the roller beetle was also damn worth the effort to unlock, and was a much shorter trek to get
---
First of many
---
Why? For fun.
---
How? Just run around and do the hearts and avoid the rest, not that difficult really.
---
Are you sure abt that? OP gonna lose that book and post here saying u/lovaa made me forget where I kept my book and now I can't log in.
---
Which is still a variation of "if you happen to be around at the right time which might be in 2 hour intervals".
---
&gt;They have clarified this and clearly stated why it doesn't break the rules.
---
When someone buys a raid boss kill, every time they're not required to do a damn thing in the raid.  They are, quite literally, buying the kill and not the spot on the team and the rest of the players low man the boss.
---
ANet, however, decides to declare it as the raiders selling a spot on their team to do the content together, which is completely wrong, but since their word is the word of god when it comes to what constitutes rule breaking in this regard, it doesn't matter.
---
I really loved HoT for its verticality and great metas. The initial timers and lack of rewards unless u really participated were sort of nice imo. Masteries being slower was also alright for me.
---
I don't get much time to play these days so I feel your pain! Just focus on one step at a time and don't worry about the pace.
---
Exactly, no way you do every single heart with zero HPs, Zero vistas and only a handful of waypoints/points of interest. You have to go out of your way to avoid those.
---
what if he posted "mystic coin" instead of gold?
---
We do seem to hear these stories only when a large group of people are returning. Coincidentally, both expansions are now on sale together for $30.
---
it would  be hilarious if Anet nerfs the maps on next patch.
---
i recognize this hatefull cunt,hes like a wolf in sheeps coat.
---
There are some cheap and fast WvW achievements that you can get easily. (repair buildings, deal dmg to doors with mount, tho requires mount).
---
If you're decent in platforming you can speed through most jumping puzzles.
---
Diving spots are also a thing, I think?
---
When there's a festival (e.g. halloween) you will get a lot there easily.
---
Playing story is a good one. (in case they're ok with skipping ahead)
---
I found the weapon achievements to be easy to get the first 1 or 2 tears. (500 kills per weapon) such search for white critters.
---
Leveling the crafting is extremely useful in end-game and gives AP.
---
Replay a different story (race) with a new character. Should go fast, also black lion keys every week and there's an AP for that.
---
Do the daily (+10AP every day).
---
\^\^\^ Just a few ideas. Basically almost any achievement gives AP and is easy to achieve for the first steps. Finishing them can be more tedious depending on which it is. Hope that helps.
---
People say it doesnt fit engineer in theme cause engineer was added to medium last minute, but trenchcoats and explosions do go together in a uh...different kind of aesthetic i think
---
Hmm hammer ranger could be cool
---
I don't mind a nice trenchcoat. The problem is, there too many of them and if it's not a trenchcoat, it has some weird half skirt hanging from behind.
---
More eye catching things? More?
---
It’s been working a lot, thank you(:
---
You give people options.
---
Unlock the weapon, then you gain access to a third legendary vendor in LA.  
---
This vendor will sell materials used to craft alternate versions of the skin. Cheaper than making a new legendary, but not too cheap. Like:
---
In mystic forge: 
---
 * Material from the vendor. It could be called something like "Soul of the &lt;Name of Legendary&gt;".
---
 * Gift that determines the modification.
---
 * Gift made out of Bloodstone Shard, Obsidian Shards (or lost Orrian Jewlery boxes), Mystic Runestone and Ectoplasmic Stones. To make it a sink for spirit shards, karma, coin and gear. 
---
 * Level 80 exotic weapon of the same type.
---
 * = Level 80 salvageable exotic with the skin variation. 
---
For example, you could use a Gift of Dragon Magic with the Soul of the Lover and the other materials to make a "Draconic Dreamer" that shoots dragons instead unicorns.
---
selfish assholes do not have to think about that sort of thing when making suggestions
---
bloodtide coat is the easy one, harathi hinterlands cannon when there are other people around because you can shoot other peoples as well sucks more, at least bloodtide cost is invididual targets that doesnt interfer with anyone elses
---
for me Kessex hill Fort Selma if no event, there is a dumb one in one of the Charr zones where you have to zap drakes or something and people can kill your drake
---
s someone else mentioned, the godslost portal one if there are people
---
i know there are some others where it's mindnumbingly slow unless there is an event going but i can't remember right now which ones
---
It's a little pit about 75% of the way through the JP.  If you fall in and don't die, you can't get out of it without waypointing.
---
I specified I'm not looking at exclusively damage. You can easily out dps an average mirage with a firebrand but a well played mirage will out dps a firebrand but also only with confusion. On it's own merit, Mirage is not overall a "good" or "balanced" condi class. It is niche but fills it's niche extremely well.
---
Just wanted to let you know that if you buy the second expansion, you get the first for free.
---
If they spend time on something like this I'd prefer that they'd just start a third generation of legendary weapons.
---
no fun allowed
---
It is actually, the guys name is [Andy.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-mcleod-7b91516)
---
What happens at night?
---
To be frank, I'd be glad for tuning all those effects down. On (almost) every legendary. I was trying (successfully ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶) to help someone today with Not So Secret and thanks to auras I couldn't see where I'm standing.
---
How many do you get there? Last couple times I went through I got a dozen sprigs of Rosemary, a bit of garlic and that's it.
---
Why would that be in the BC thought? We have 2 more fitting locations for that, no?
---
It's the easiest way for me. I tried the "do everything except hearts" the first time I did world completion and having to go back and do them all sucked big time. At least now it's broken up a bit.
