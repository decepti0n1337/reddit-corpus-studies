It'd be cooler if he turned around and snuck off into the water.

Mine are the mistforged obisidian weapons at 0.038% and sublimed mistforged triumphant armors at 0.676%
---
you're already on effi, so why not just use the currency tab?
---
&gt; Patch notes: we're also slightly increasing the penalty for holosmiths overheating, as it wasn't commensurate with the level of power granted by holoforge mode.
---

---
*slightly*
---
still dont understand the toolbelt skill lockout, as you never wanted to overheat in wvw/pvp anyway, and it only serves to make the pve rotation incredibly simple/boring
---
Holosmith could also use a rework like deadeye regarding weapons. Heat should have some effects on all weapons (and kits), not just on exceeds and sword.
---
If it wanted to target PvP/WvW it effectively missed it completely because you never intentionally overheat there, no clue what they wanted with that.
---
Serial :(
---
Yes the new chrono change is the worst thing anet has ever changed in a class. It isnt even very viable in wvw anymore because the clones die before you can generate more than 1.
---
Do you see Scrapper healer in PvP?
---
it would make more sense if they didn't actively reward you for overheating with the best PvE grandmaster trait Holo has aka PBM.
---
But they forgot to remove/change it if that was the case
---
Yep. Someone could do a 5 hour jawgeous holo compilation and you might see him overheat two times.
---
&gt; make the pve rotation incredibly simple/boring
---
Sounds like Mallyx rotation with the difference that it got buffed.
---
Well, it takes roughly two years - if not more - to successfully work out and approve a law or restriction.
---
It takes roughly two weeks, or less, for a staff of lawyers and clever designers to find loop holes or change the formula so that the restriction doesn't fit anymore.
---
The reason why blcs are blocked in belgium is most likely, that the amount of potential costumers is not worth the hassle to came up with an idea that can than also be regulated by the same law.. You wait for a big swing, and then you start taking actions. And noones says that what comes next will be better just because ppl think it is already at it's lowest.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example: There is a reason why the gemstore is selling keys and not black lion chests. For some of the early attempts of regulation of 2017-2018 (that never really come to live except for china where it was quickly worked around - eg blizzard with overwatch) this alone would be enough to exclude them from the list of bannable behaviors. Because you know exactly what you get for your buck. A key. Not more. Not less. For a normal person there would be no difference between buying the key or a box but for laws and lawyers there lies a world inbetween.
---
You can get everywhere with a griffon by reaching the ceiling of the map with mount masteries. But of course it takes time to reach that height. It’s how I got inside like 6 months ago
---
Love the depth to it, just one question - if there's a United Kingdom of Elona then will they have a referendum on leaving the rest of Tyria?
---
I loved the rifle build too, the hardest hit build is prolly the no kit newbie friendly build though, that one should way below 29.8k DPS.
---
The current Power holo has lower dps than the power core bomb engi during hot. It's that bad now.
---
The rotation feels just awful now and doesn't have anything worth optimizing. Wouldn't even play this if it still had ok dps. 
---
Solar focusing lens modifier part is still useless.
---
They wanted to add trade-offs. But what exactly are the benefits of engi as a whole now? Holo forge was always just a glorified kit with lockout. 
---
Why is overheating so punishing in the first place? Can't believe the dev responsible for this even plays engi outside of low rank spvp. It was sold as bursty glasscannon at start of pof but we got another bruiser spec instead.
---
Also holo was already dead in high level fractals before this patch. It will be impossible to join a decent cm group as engi now.
---
It is an annual festival since last year. It will drop around end of july or they are breaking with a seven year long tradition. Sure, they can change things up but it is very unlikely. That plus summer months are usally low engangement months for mmos if you are not releasing your newest expansion, it would be the smartest move to bridge over the holiday time with events back to back.
---
Let alone that it will buy them a huge chunk of time. Time that is most likely needed.
---
I didn't play my WvW chrono since the balance patch day.
---
pls upgrade the caps anet
---
This kind of info is letting new players who still didn't buy any expansion to get a chance into fractals and other group content and giving some decent numbers using core traits.
---
Cool!
---
ele was broken for YEARS (3+) and it was one of the biggest reasons why i left the game forever
---
i still remember this subreddit ranting how ele being op is fine back then because "its so hard and frail"
---
thankfully the game is fukin finally dying completely
---
Add a person on a friend list, check their ap level, if its low they are new if not iz a veteran, then unfriend and move on

WvW: Longbow DH is Good for Roaming With Trapper Runes or Scholar. Lb+sw sh/focus  
---
PvP: I Run 2 Builds  
---
\-Core Guard: GS/Scpter-shield  + Sw/F  
---
\-DH: LB + Sw/F \[Same Wvw Build Kinda\]  
---
Open World: You can Literally Run Anything \[ I Bust out my Lb when i wana leech\]
---
Fractals/Raids : No LB Ever... I Mean it ...Ever
---
It's shit in open world too
---
all the gems you dumped on this game are becoming worthless bro :D
---
This is not a bad 3D render, what did you use make it?
---
I meant organized cm fractals. Where holo had to dps race the banner bs before. Burst is also quite important. Soulbeast is able to reach 140k+ dps during phases. Weaver and dh are extremely high aswell with way better sustained dps.
---
Holo was ok'ish in average fractal groups before but now you lost your utility on top of a lot of dps. You can't use grenade barrage into breakbar anymore if you are overheated. Can't use it with 15% mod anymore. Can't even cc with aed. 
---
The dps was highly dependant on group dps. With high dps the cooling down period was simply too long. Dps was also garbage if the breakbar didnt line up with overheat. Damage and cc is all engi brings to a group. Soulbeast brings frost spirit + stance share AND higher damage. It also brings some stealth so engi can't even shine with that.
---
The condi modifier also doesn't really work in fractals. 9-10 condis is simply not really realistic lowering the dps even further into the 28k range. I really want to see how low it is in 200-500kp fractal pugs now but i have to get in there as holo first somehow. I can try it with my static but the bs will outdamage me hard for sure. Slb will probably do double my dps.
---
Ahhh... I remember the good old days like 3 years ago when gs/lb was good in fractals. Those days are long gone, alas.
---
Not 100% sure about pist Patch. But Support Scrapper is omegagood for heals/condicleanses. Way overkill for most groups, thats why it rarely sees play.
---
Sigh, I will miss cheesing Ensolyss and MAMA with AED.. oh well.
---
They finally let us have our own banners instead of taking them from the guild and now you want to put them back in the guild?
---
These started popping up for me when I was half way through the grind and I was so happy.
---
Possibly thinking of the skritt boxes from mining the gems
---
And if your play group isn't prone to going down often the rez is still useless just like before no? The barriers are only for you, if you were able to share them with medical dispersion field thatd be great but nah.
---
Those are a pain to get xD
---
missingno has fallen on rough times
---
Yea, I was previously playing heal scrapper in higher fractals so my post was about trying to optimize with what little engi has left in terms of support. I really dont like the selfish support scrapper brings. I want to support those around me.
---
And yet FFXIV and WoW still have Microtransactions. Regardless of what you think of F2P games, Sub-based games are just F2P games with a monthly fee and their content release schedules aren't any better
---
It's pretty hard to find those 5 others people tho and we probably wouldn't be qualified to do it :p
---
Watch out, catching that pokemon will break your game.
---
I recall they've said dungeons are the most tangled of spaghetti code. They don't want to double the dungeon playerbase for the same reason you don't want double the players in a game of jenga.
---
An upvote doesn't equate to funny.  It equates to good content.
---
Ty, that is a bit light on dps. And that dip is no bueno
---
I do, and I have criticisms for the game too, but I don't second guess ArenaNet's intention or competence the way you often do with statements like "if we don't get more content it's because of bad design decisions and not a lack of resources."
---
I have 7 years in the industry so far, 2 as an actual producer and writer and I wouldn't presume to be able to do a better job than the folks at ANet.
---
yeah, what you said about the tradeoff already being there is spot on.
---
For instance, when i look at chrono I’m like “I’d sooner play only 2 core specs than run 2 core specs AND chrono. Chrono is worse than no spec at all.

I'm glad to hear you met some good people!  I'm enjoying seeing more and more in game.
---
It's not tied to reset, it's tied to community progress. In the top right corner of your screen it mentions the boss rush, click on that and it will show a progress bar. As more people do bosses, the bar goes up. :)

There might be a discount for the anniversary in mid-August, or maybe when the next episode launches (no one knows when, but probably before October).

Interesting idea, but I doubt people will actually go for it even if you still get to see the special gem store gathering tool animations. Since, nowadays, it reallly doesn't bother people because they can just drop trash mobs in a picosecond. I could only see this being useful on PoF maps since those clumped together branded enemies are more annoying than pocket raptors.
---
PBM gets so weird with the lockout. 
---
The whole point of PBM is to overheat (it buffs your overheat with Heat Therapy and Laser's Edge), so locking damage skills after overheat is... weird. You also get caught in a lose-lose situation at high heat: you either ignore your forge skills or you lose your toolbar skills. There's no other options, since you can't discharge your heat (like Vent Exhaust) or wait for it to go down (with Enhanced).
---
Meta healer: Druid. Keep in mind it’s meta because it gives 25 might + fury and spotter, not because it has good heals. Its heals are actually bad compared to other healers.
---
Pug/Bad player carrier: Heal Scourge. Insane res potential, look at some clips from MighyTeapot’s twitch for examples. Doesn’t interfere with druid CA generation because it has very little healing, just tons of barrier.
---
Heavy condis (not necessary unless wiping a lot): heal tempest. Insane ticking heals, highest heal per second in the game over an extended duration afaik, also provides some defensive boons. Only really ever needed when groups are struggling and even then only on condi heavy bosses like sloth and matthias, or dhuum as a kiter.
---
Healbrand: push two roles (healing and quickness) into each other, just make sure the group has a way to have 25 might since running this usually means no druid.
---
Heal renegade: same as above
---
Boon thief/Heal thief: useless on most bosses, meta on a few. The bosses this build does anything on are bosses where the steal skill is “Detonate Plasma”, which gives every boon except alacrity to all teammates. With some boon duration all you need is one boon thief and one alacrity renegade and all boons are permanently covered. Only works on a few bosses though (check snowcrows for list)
---
Overheating with PBM also gets the added effect (flat out nerf) of getting "dynamic scaling" on Laser's Edge when cooling down when previously you just got the full buff for the entire cooling period.
---
Seems like a struck a nerve, sorry I think your character is an example of what's wrong with GW2's fashion direction. Deal with it.
---
Lootboxes won't be banned in the UK the government won't introduce the necessary legislation so in terms of the UK they are fine.
---
I disagree so bad with ranged being less damage than melee. if anything for pve content I would prefer ranged should have less utility (CC, dodges, blocks) but do more dps than melee.
---
Joke's on him, if he swaps maps it only shows one infusion until he re-equips them all
---
Hah, my rarest skins are the Divine Sovereign ones.  Took the time to grind them all out when the event returned.  Beyond that, mistforged hero's stuff.
---
My new wvw chrono spec is Ele now, and will be until there are some drastic changes. I'm also really pissed off and have met very few wvw chrono mains who are not.
---
People complain about it when it's shoehorned in, what a shocker...
---
You cant sit there and expect me to believe that their relationship adds anything to the story of elder dragons and magic overflow. Would revealing that Canach is bi be helpful to the story? Would revealing that taimi is pan be useful?
---
I was looking for info on viper gear and for some reason this thread popped up and so i started reading a few posts
---
 Revenant: Staff but only because there aren't many choices and it's mainly used as a weapon swap with staff 5 for CC. So many builds take it but only use it briefly.
---
Aren't you u/Niyumi3 (account now suspended) who detests GW2?
---
Right? Nobody bats an eye when two cliche-ridden characters get into a heterosexual relationship, but switch up one of the genders and you have people writing paragraphs about how this is a cardinal storytelling sin. Talk about holding LGBT character writing to a different standard.
---
Literally I just did that lol. 
---
I joined a train for like one hour during T1. I just got my boxes and pulled a teal infusion.
---
I really dislike your engineer toolbelt example. They exactly tried that this patch with overheat and guess what? Holo is dead in pve since grenade barrage is just way too powerfull to not have it. It also makes the rotation dull and takes utility away. Overheating will even lock you out of your heal if you take med kit.
---
The problem with Holo is that it lacks synergy between traitlines. Holo only really affects the forge. Heat only interacts with sword aswell for some reason. And yes i know that some skills count as explosions in forge but seriously, the only explosion interaction left is 1! low duration vuln stack and a slight chance of bleeding as grandmaster choice.
---
Core engi lacks weapon choices. There is no core melee weapon. No power offhand. The bombkit is close to melee but even that is 1/3 condi, 1/3 power and 1/3 utility. Grenade kit is almost the same as bomb kit but ranged without combo fields. Mortar is the grenade kit but with fields and no damage. You can't just remove toolbelts because the utilities without toolbelts just don't work on their own.
---
Nobody would probably disagree that scrapper is a design failure though. It doesn't really have a mechanic. The trade-off is not having a good traitline for taking hammer.
---
Losing the toolbelt skills sucks and is totally uncalled for. But the nerf to Laser's Edge is the true crime. It shows just how fundamentally detached from reality the balance team was when they made this change. While thematically, the change "makes sense" in reality it's terminally stupid. It's only more evident by the fact they provide no specific details about how the trait now works and no in-game feedback. Is 0% heat equal to 0% laser's edge damage? Do you only hit 10% damage at 100% heat? Does PBM retain 10% damage or does it scale down with cooling. Who the fuck knows. This is what happens when you have your Lore team do your game balance.
---
After the constant nerfs to the base damage of pretty much every Forge skill AND the base power of main hand Sword they slap a flat % based nerf to the entire spec on top of it. I'm entirely unconvinced that this is "part of Anet's plan" for holosmith going forward. Anet doesn't do balance patches frequently enough to get away with slowburn changes. Let's not give them the benefit of the doubt. Holosmith will get a half assed buff to something irrelevant next patch and still be just as useless for the next 6-12 months.
---
Give me a combat tonic and I'm all-in. I'm sick of my main character's face and too lazy to grind map completion just to get up to parity for a new toon with a new look. My salvation has been the olmakhan sand elemental endless combat tonic and the kodan endless combat tonic and now I need to have them all.
---
I'm frustrated with this change because it means the carpal-tunnel-inducing builds are the most valuable ones. I'm not as young as I used to be, and it hurts to run some of those more complex rotations now.
---
I don't know if it's necessary to completely override the base mechanic, but I think giving base professions and elite specs unique reasons for why you really want to play them is essential. Profession mechanics should evoke what the character is all about.
---
Scrapper's Function Gyro shouldn't be some 30 second cooldown fire-and-forget replacement for an elite toolbelt skill. I think the gyro should be like a Ranger's pet, with the typical F1 and F3 controls and the ability to toggle passive, except along with a typical set of attacks the gyro also uses toolbelt skills according to which utility skills you have equipped. F2 moves the gyro to an area, copying boons on the Scrapper nearby allies; F4 moves the gyro to an area, damaging and stomping enemies; F5 moves the gyro to an area, granting barrier and reviving downed allies.
---
Holosmith shouldn't take away your skills for doing what your trait told you to do, the other traits should just be good instead. Make Thermal Release Valve quicken your dodge (but retain the evasion frames) and make the animation look like you're being blasted around by jets of steam. When your heat is over 100 using Enhanced Capacity Storage Unit, retain Laser's Edge as if your heat were 50 lower while out of Photon Forge.
---
Base Engineer should have significantly better elite toolbelt skills now that they're the only ones who get them.
---
Druid shouldn't nerf your pet, Druids have had enough nerfing. Base Ranger should get a cool F5 pet buff skill instead. The buff is called "Lead The Way!" - it gives the pet superspeed, increases their action speed by 100% (e.g. 2012-style quickness) and their damage by 60% for 6 seconds, but reduces the Ranger's damage by 50% for the same duration. Cooldown: 25s.
---
Daredevils' Sweep should be changed to act as a fast leap with evasion frames that stuns your target on hit while acquiring a Stolen skill as usual. Sleight of Hand increases Sweep's stun duration to 2 seconds.
---
Oh boy, the day mantis gets to be a mount will be my last day in game 😂 
---
I mean, I appreciate the idea, but mantis...are creepy f*s straight from hell, and their sable arms/legs....yuk 😰😂  (girl, afraid of bugs here, hi 😂)
---
Haha well I suggest [looking here on gearing viper](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) (now that there is all stat selectable gear). As for weapons it was a toss up since sword/sword is used as a main weapon set for heal, alac, and power, mace/axe + sb are main weapons for renegade, hammer is meta in WvW, shield is an elite spec weapon like SB and is still used in some PvP and kiting. Last weapon they can use (besides underwater) is staff and it's taken as a weapon swap in a lot of builds but isn't the primary meta weapon on any so I left it as the "least used".
---
Damn thanks for the answer. At least I know I was doing my part correctly since I'm either the DH with the wall of reflections of the Firebrand with condi cleanse. 
---
It basically comes down to a common sense and DPS check of your party. 
---
Thanks for the answer and have fun!
---
This is is a very good rig why u want a better one ? 
---
I mean fps drop from time to time that’s normal.
---
- worldboss fight
---
- wvw blob fights 
---
Etc.
---
Maybe u need to clarify were u need better fps.
---
I should have been more specific but I couldn't figure out how to put a description on the post😂 I want my game to look better with few more fps I usually play at 20-30 fps with some settings on the lowest
---
Or.... gulp...  a single damn mount skin obtained in the same way? Or hey, maybe a very rare armor skin? Or weapon?
---
But we can’t have that, because it would undermine the cash shop, and also the “I deserve to have everything without grinding” crowd would also have a total hissy fit.
---
last 3 was dxgmms2.sys and before that it was atikmdag.sys. 
---
All the other times were random restarts without blue screen.
---
Yeah, Blossoming is quite cheap and fast to unlock once you have the basic pieces (and even those are cheap to craft).
---
This all sounds interesting and I personally feel like we could use this upcoming LW season to tie up some loose ends as you have suggested.  However, I have a couple of notes;
---
1. As someone who doesn't raid as much as they'd like (if at all) I don't feel like the raid story should tie that much into the main plot as that would make it harder for non-raid players to get the whole story
---
2. The wurm and rhino mounts sound interesting on paper but I don't see them working in game, especially the rhino mount. I personally don't think players would actually like being the passenger while someone else does all the driving
---
I usually make 2 hits on a mob to reduce their health bar and then leave them be for those who’s obviously leveling up there) idk, just feel like sharing in this game, can’t help) but I always wonder if maybe it looks annoying from their perspective x)
---
it makes me really mad that this is a new build (4 months) and psu is faulty/has to be changed. siiiiigh :(
---
cpu sits between 45-52! 
---
alot of people have been telling me about the PSU :/ i guess it's the PSU... even if it's a brand new one.
---
This is an excellent computer for playing games but if something's not running good, it's no doubt because GW2 somehow thinks you want the integrated CPU graphics (Intel "HD" graphics) to run the game, which has terrible performance and is used as either backup / laptop graphics. 
---
GW2 is old and doesnt run great, but its definitely not THAT bad.  
---
First try looking in ingame settings and see if there is a "graphics device" setting, there probably isn't, but that would be easiest. If there is none there, try more central settings on your computer, like control panel. If not:
---
You need to look in intel/nvidia graphics software and set it to use max performance, or make it use max performance only when running GuildWars2.exe  
---
If that somehow doesn't work, look it up to see if others have a similar problem, if not, something must be wrong with your software (drivers/updates)
---
Reaper does more damage though
---
I downloaded apex legends but it's just unplayable on it bad graphics and low for lol, thanks for the tip
---
I don't understand the real meaning of your comment under the edge.
---
Don’t forget model limit and quality, those are arguably the most important settings to lower.
---
To add to the other comments, the changes to Shadow Arts also entirely killed some niche Thief builds such as Deimos hand kiter while being so meager in other ways that alternatives such as a heal Deadeye boon share build is completely non-viable.
---
Perfect analogy, yes.
---
If it means "existence is pain" Braham is gonna be back I say let's go dive for bubbles and make it a Quaggan expansion instead.
---
Heroic is easier than the stellar (ascended) ones, but more painful than just the astral non ascended ones. (Assuming I had the name right lol)
---
Engineer changes make no sense unless there is something bigger coming, but I'm not hanging around another 3 months until next big patch for Anet to un-break my main class if there is no new content to keep me occupied.
---
Never felt this discouraged about GW2, wtf are they doing...
---
&gt; When are the World Boss Rush tier rewards given out?
---
Everytime you visit a city
---
Not shatter without clones? I'm a PvP only player so I'm not sure how it goes in PvE but using a quick Diversion without any clones to interrupt a heal or a stomp is gold. Or just standing next to your enemy and using F1 just because you needed the 2k dmg to get him down. I can live with many changes, but not the one that took my ability to shatter without clones.
---
Isn't super speed 66%?
---
This absence can also become a very interesting topic they could play with.  
---
How do you deal with coming from the best genius involved to kill a dragon to someone too weakened to be physically present or involved when you wanted ? Do you feel guilt? Determination to change it?  
---
How do you deal to not be able to get your revenge against the dragon that harmed you the most by killing the person you cared the most? What is your goal now that what was your fuel, the desire to get a revenge against dragons, is no longer actual?  
---
How do you deal being considered obsolete after everything you did?  
---
How do you react when you realize your apprentice (Taimi) became fully independent without you to help her? Do you feel proud? Jealous? Guilty?  
---
There are many interesting stuff that can be done. I totally understand why they finally decided to not introduced her in season 4 as they originally planned, and would rather have a late but meaningful reintroduction than just use her to do "btw, here is she and yay!". I also suppose getting the tone and the right mindset for her treatment is not an easy thing as well.
---
I am mostly put off by the ~30g overhead compared to a regular marshal stat weapon.
---
I haven't actually made the same comparison for diviner's
---
LoL, wtf are you saying? 
---
Scourge is meta on exactly one boss, that is soulless horror.
---
Does anyone actually use Herald shield? I use it purely for RP purposes as it is just garbage
---
there are guides on the web on how to get max level in crafting. you could use that to lower your gold cost.  
---
crafting is meant to be done along with the leveling.  if you don't do crafting while leveling then you have a lot to catch up in that area once you reach level 80. 
---
you can craft level 80 gear at level 400+ crafting if I'm not mistaken.
---
You can replace all greiving stuff by sinister but a little less dps.  
---
I only reach 27/27.5k with full sinister.  
---
FB is better but this build is a really good variante.
---
On adds boss, if grab is done well, your dps will be increase quite a lot.
---
I'm ready. I'm sure there are several more seasons of Asura and Inquest being involved in everything to get through first, though.
---
You sure your monitor is plugged in your graphics card output and not your motherboard? That should give you good framerate outside of world boss and wvw clusterfucks
---
I honestly don't know😂
---
I waited until level 80. Level 0-500 took me 50gold and 50minutes following an online guide.
---
Just checked it is connected bto my motherboard lol
---
I try both and signet seems to be better (and easier\^\^).
---
Plus, this build has no hard cc so signet give you one in emergency case.
---
Thinking that any open world content is hardcore. You truly are special.
---
It's kind of funny (sad?) how one of the main selling points of GW2 was that we were going from just humans to five races. The Norn's sticking point was how everything was about their legend, they sacrificed cooperation for combat and honor, and they became the embodiments of the spirits. Becoming the Bear, the Wolf, etc was *the reason* to be a Norn. Turns out they're just racial skills that are barely playable. Then, furthermore, transforming is just a backseat oddity that has essentially no place in the story, with only random NPCs tranforming on rare occasions. Eir never became the bear when it might have helped her to not die. Braham has never become the Wolf in the five+ years we've known him. And it's supposed to be *their thing*. The entire story of Jora in EotN was that she became an outcast because Svanir *prevented her from becoming the Bear*. 
---
It's a real shame. I love the Norn but we're nearly seven years on and I don't have a single one. Outside the personal story I can't imagine they have anything relevant to them to explore. Even the Charr, who are also close to dead last on the "they exist" scale, at least got Olmakhan in season four, even if their only real story role is to supplant having to write Legion Charr with a noble savage trope that's more palatable to general audiences.
---
Wow..somebody asking for more drastic changes on druids....no ranger is using druid in pvp and wvw already now, you only see druids in raids played by 10% of the playerbase...what else do you want nerf on druid?..the name?
---
Yes. Yes. A thousand, million times, YES.
---
Can Scrapper clean godlike amounts of condies?
---
Yes [X]
---
Do we need godlike amounts of condi cleans to survive in WvW?
---
Had a similar problem, low fps and insane loading times (5-10min for LA). my ssd had issues. got a new ssd re-installed windows and went smoothly again.
---
Check your drives for errors, maybe that helps?
---
We already had one. They all turned to stone at the end of GW:EotN and are mostly locked in a fight with destroyers and Primordus underground in depths of Tyria
---
Maybe they should share their expansion with the Charr like in Eye of the North. The Far Shiverpeaks and the Blood Legion Homelands are pretty close.
---
This direction, Cantha or Janthir are the interesting places to go atm
---
Zojja was always my favorite member of destinies edge. When HoTs happened literally my head canon motivation was to resume zojja and traherene I didn’t care about anything else. So the fact that Anet has had her be virtually non existent is so sad to me. Like I know people like to blame voice casting but that honestly can’t be it, it’s not a valid reason. They could at the very least have someone mention her damn name but it’s honestly like she never even existed. No one cares about her in story or in the writing room and it’s a shame. Hell I would have been happy to get a mail from a random ass Asura doctor that said something like “Zojja is still recovering in the hospital xoxo”
---
In addition to other comments, I highly suggest you do the Dragon's Stand meta event once, as it gives a different perspective on the fight against Mordremoth.
---
To me it feels like the Olmahakan are a cheap narrative device so Rox can have a "happy ending." The charr are supposed to be all about the legions, its very collectivist society, so much that you really don't have sons an daughters. I really thought that it was part of their nature, that they dont really see themselves as individuals, only as a part of a collective.
---
But I was wrong, apparently there is a tribe of treehugger charrs that are basically humans with horns and fur, lol.
---
Why would you call me out like that
---
What about sylvari who were the focus of the game in LS1, LS2 and HoT?
---
Basically they just ignore Norn and Charr.
---
&gt;In PoF it did as we visited established, separated nation that cut it's ties with outside world some time ago and professions we knew evolved there in their own way.
---
Wasn't Renegades PoF spec an exception?
---
A lot of people did. The annoying ding ding ding on airship proved that &gt;:(
---
But in long term, it wasnt really profitable way to do it. Since spirit shards can net you more gold (at least someone counted such) and that way you could buy sigils anyway.
---
But then again, one is easier and quaranteed one is not so much always
---

---
Captain Thackeray! What the hell are you doing?
---
If you think the gem store and the way the game caters to specific audiences isn't affecting content design and output, well, what can I say, you're a lost cause.
---
We've reached a point where the parent company had to step in and start firing people. You think that's a sign of competence? You think that's a sign of health?
---
Nah, just come and attack me because I dare show dissent. We should all bow down our heads and follow along, even if the whole thing is on flames, because the real problem is to point at the flames, not the fire itself.
---
Raid, WvW, PvP, Fractal, and Guild communities have been on shambles since years, and it only keeps getting worse and worse. But hey, they did their best!
---
Fun stats:
---
* Rarest achievement completed: Quip II : The Perfected Pistol   (0.338%)
---
* Rarest dye: Urn  (2.326%)
---
* Rarest mini: Mini Dragon Gourdon (0.453%)
---
* Rarest title: Ultra Shiny (2.305%)

* Rarest non-gemstore armor skin: Ornate Guild Vambraces (0.279%) (with other Ornate Guild armor as followups)
---
* Rarest non-gemstore weapon skin: Mistforged Hero's Spear  (0.231%) (unsurprisingly, the four follow ups are 3 pinnacle weapons and Sikandar)
---
I don't think Jormag will reawaken this soon. We'll probably go to Cantha or charr lands first.
---
Still, if it were on my hands, Far Shiverpeaks would be my top choice. I wish this had been the first expansion all along.
---
The next post will be this screenshot, inverted.
---
Talking of rares I could get dress up my toon with the skin no one even wants to wear.
---
In any case, I commend you for fashion wars gearing towards non gemstore even.
---
and its not even his first one, he already cried about holo few days ago
---
No screenshot of equipment tab screen so you're lying..
---
I know you pesky peeps are using full trinkets with full infusions and weapons. Hidden backpack, shoulders and gloves.
---
Engi is the worst power class now out of all classes.
---
When leveling new toons, mounts make it faster and more fun imo. But other than that all the expansion content is for lvl80, so it's irrelevant while leveling.  
---
If you're leveling your first toon - i think not having mount is ok. It lets you explore slower and appreciate the maps(even tho expansion areas are **much** higher quality.) When its your 10th toon, you just want to run fast between events, or go to hard to reach areas if you're exploring...
---
This is very odd so soon before the August anniversary sale. I mean , the big known date sales are usually when they bust out -25% to -30% on stuff rarely on sale , like account upgrades. Same with the Halloween stuff on discount. It isn't rare for stuff to pop back in to the store , but for costumes or account upgrades to be discounted is unusual outside one of the big sales that are at a set time.
---
Jesus fuck why
---
You can barely see the character behind all the ugly pastel colours and rainbow auras.
---
My pleasure. If you're on NA megaserver and ever need help ingame with something shoot me a DM
---
I find the reason, it's a laptop and it's mac
---
How did you notice this, you should have been watching the ledges!
---
Oh wow, I linked the wrong build of my open tabs, I updated to the correct build now :p
---
For WvW you could try [this build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Power_S/D_Roamer). WvW has felt weird for quite some time imo and there are quite a few werid build that can stack up tons of toughness/vitality while still doing good damage while otherd can't.
---
Note that for Thief your AA is probably you main damage source (THief AAs are among the strongest in the game) and the rest of the skills are way more about utility that straight up damage.
---
Really arenanet. Holosmith already had a tough time compared to Soulbeast (fractals), Dragonhunter, weaver, Even reaper (easier rotation), thief, power chrono etc.
---
Then you do this. Kit lockout after overheat, toolbelt lockout after PBM Take 4-6k damage after overheat. Jeezes arenanet, this is by far the highest downside ever, for a class not even have any special burst or cc (just ok to good if played right). What made holo's play holo was the fun factor. But you killed it completely. Crazy bad balance Arenanet, and one thing is for sure, whoever decided to do this, doenst play holo in pve, nor in fractals or raids, you simply don't, and that's a major requirement, to push a balance patch on pve/dps build. As for pvp punish, hello! under what rock do you live, nobody overheats in pvp arenanet. You missed the ball. Big time.
---
just like quaggan. who is next?
---
First i was like "oh no, this is not good for my holo main" but then i remebered that i haven't played in since dragonfall and it hardly matters that a game i don't play anymore is being ruined.
---
GW2 is a single player game at this point.
---
Damn. My rarest achi is "Underworld Slayer"  with 0.801%. Im guessing most got the corsair boots from PvP/WvW reward track then.
---
My rarest mini is **" Mini Blademaster Diarmid ".** (1%) People sure got better use for those crystalline ores :D
---
My rarest weapon skin is [Squeedily Spooch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Squeedily_Spooch) from wardrobe unlock :( then  Holographic Chosen (shield).
---
Oddest rare weapon skin is "[Riftstalker's Core](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Riftstalker%27s_Core)" which is from current event that was meant to be "pre-event" for dragonfall story.
---
Ahh, what I meant was that you don't need the expansions to do season 2 (unless I'm mistaken?)  As to whether or not OP has S2, who knows.
---
Oh I see. Yes , I think that's correct.
---
&gt; Soulbeast pet merge is not a trade-off because you have the option not to merge.
---
Soulbeast is probably one of the biggest offenders.
---
It's literally just ranger+ some extra skills and stats.
---
Well, dodging is in their rotation; this can put them in dicey locations (e.g. far enough to get Shared Agony, into somebody's Shared Agony, into a Displacement AoE, or into a Meteor Swarm). But even if the daredevil is skilled enough to avoid that sort of stuff, Cairn isn't a boss that one should take a power class into, generally speaking.
---
You stream it from your computer, so you need stable WiFI much more than a powerful phone.
---
Put your strongest defensive utilities/cleanses in underwater slots. If winds blow you in down in the water, it will save you without wasting normal skills CDs.
---
Eir did turn into a wolf tho, when you spar with her during a personal instance infront of her house.
---
They lost our trust? I did not know that people are disappointed after the said that there will be no addon after LWS4 but the will give us addon worth content in LWS5.
---
If you max out your crafting lvl (doable in maybe 40mins to 1 hour) you can craft your endgame armor (ascended) with the highest possible stats. Also once you have ascended armor, you can pretty much keep it forever, since you will be able to change it's stats by a small price. And it's not character bound, meaning other characters of the same weight class will be able to wear it, too. That is, honestly, a fair enough "grind". Pretty sure other MMOs require a much higher grind where you have to rely on RNG drops from bosses to get endgame armor.
---
Also you really don't need ascended armor right away. The second best armor (Exotics) can be bought dirt cheap from the trading post. So wait until you gathered up some gold and rescources before you start crafting a full set of ascended armor
---
I am more interested in Charr story, maybe Blood Legion Homelands. I think a good content would be Blood Legion Rebellion with Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer disagreeing with the treaty with the humans.
---
Thats ofcourse my subjective perspective based on the amount of angry topics with titles like "The game is dying"
---

Its not about tanking, its about trivializing certain mechanics with a 4 sec invuln like sloth shake or broken king ice which is a very clear nerf
---
The right thing to do would be cut them off when he gets grounded and they slowly grow back while attack timer is ticking. When boss is not dead by the end of the time limit they are fully grown back and he flies off.
---
And no, that's not rocket science to program.
---
I am a bit tired of dragons and i would rather prefer Asura or Charr and Inquest and legions since there is a lot behind this to pick from. With Asura i would love to know more about them over all and then maybe a plot around the Inquest. The Sandswept Isle and the story chapter was one of the most exciting chapters in season 4 in my personal opinion. The Inquest and the Olmakahns really and the whole Island is something i come back to more often then any other story chapter. I just talked to me. 
---
I want more of that :)
---
So Dragonfall, Silverwastes, Dragon's stand, Istan? Not exactly sure what you mean under repeatable content, but pretty much everything Anet release in last several years is repetable content.
---
Is Build templates all that is needed for people to stop complaining though? I kinda don't believe it.
---
Jeff just left GW2
---
If you listen to redditors:
---
WvW has been dead since HoT, PvP since PoF, PvE since S3 or S4 (or since lay-offs) depending do you ask since-HoT player or since-PoF player. Raids have been dead the day they got kicked from a pug.
---
Obviously these are not 100% true, but each to their own I guess.
---
It's repeatable, but the replayability isn't high. Silverwastes and DS are 5 and 4 years old already respectively. 
---
Most recent content desperately lacks the challenge to make it engaging enough to replay. With the exception of raids, nothing lately has been even close to something people can do every reset until the next patch without getting boring.
---
Oh the said that 1 Month after release, the said that before LWS1, before LWS2, Before HoT, before LWS3, before PoF and before LWS5.  
---
The game is not dying, it is only dying for them because after all these years they have nothing really something left to do or are just burned out because the played one game for 5+ years.   
---
People don´t realize that they can stop playing and come back later, there is no subscription forcing you to play the game to get your moneys worth or a gear treadmill where you are left behind if you don´t play for a year.
---
The thing is these threads have been appearing since 2013. There probably is a bit of a bigger influx right now with the (at least perceived) tad higher degree of uncertainty, but most posts of this kind tend to be salty fear pushing rather then well informed analysis.
---
Too dark, spooky and masculine for the new era of post-2016 SJW's
---
Try out some other games like FFXIV and PoE is my best advice at this point
---
Tbh most of all i think Arena Net need to comunicate with us because it is very easy to get that little thought in to your head, 
---
 because they are saying nothing about the future after ls 5, like litterally NOHTING. 
---
And if there is nothing how will we even know there will be something? Logically there should be, but not knowing makes that thought grow in the back of my head and i kind of take a step back and try to not get too involved and be ready just in case that thought becomes real. Will it? 
---
I played games that died, that closed and that feeling is awfull when it happens and there for i feel a bit off right now. I realize i am probably, actaully likely wrong but that is just the thing i don't know if it is, because we know nothing.
---
Earlier years we have either got clues about what is gonna happen and we got told there are plans for future. We knew at season 2 that a expansion is about to come and we also knew that they were working on season 3 becaus they told us. Not in so many words but they told us they were working on something so don' worry. 
---
Then they told us about PoF that was gonna move in to Season 4. Not so much about the whole thing, but they told us what was to come, so don't worry.
---
Now we know that we get no expac but we do get season 5 and maybe some expac feature without getting a expac and then some hum hum hum when it is ready and then nothing. We know there was layoffs, we know they recover, but it still leave us with season 5 and then nothing.
---
This is were comunication need to happen. Nothing is not a good thing to leave your players with. Talk to us and tell us something about the future! Kill that thought for us and let us know there is something more then hum hum hum....
---
maybe a full expansion no , but i would love to see secondary storylines to expand the personal races stories
---
You should not
---
we need a dark and gritty story
---
I think you're correct.  Whatever happens people will be saying the game is dying.  And if that is a sign of Anet losing community trust, the only conclusion possible is that anet can never regain the trust of the community. 
---
So the answer to your question in the op is: they can never regain the trust of the community.
---
Uhh we had this build on the SC discord for at least 3-4 months now as meme :D  
---
But Sword/Dagger instead of dagger. But it was never benched\^\^'  
---
How is sword vs dagger? The evade on Sw #2 is a bit annoying but it's a really strong heal. Same for Sword #3.  
---
Dagger offhand also offers better healing on Water #4 and #5 + Frost Aura. (But Focus has better cDMG I assume.)
---
  
---
But It's nice to see that a build that Roul (iirc) and I posted as a meme works now.\^\^' At least on golem.  
---
Btw with Smoldering Sigil you will overcap burning by 10%. I would choose Malice instead. This will boost the duration of your "support conditions" like weakess, vuln etc. without overcapping burning.   
---
As second sigil we used Transference, but more damage is more usefuli guess. Btw if you need more healing frost bow actually is quite nice. (But this depends on the team and the situation you play this.)
---
Are you sure? I did my 1st World boss at tier 3 and got the t3 and 4 reward but no t1 or 2.
---
Does more damage than my condi soulbeast.
---
Engi is dead in pve open world excluded of course.
---
Thanks SAND, had a good time today and I managed to get the last of the geodes I needed for Ambrite weapon recipes.
---
I posted a condi healer weaver with sword like over a year ago. Sword has a bit higher burst but definitely not worth imo because people actually have to stand in the sword water 2 whereas you can kind of manipulate where you turn with your cone of cold. From what I saw sword also has lower healing unless you are actually really good at finishing your auto attacks or would double attune to water. 
---
I agree that you should take a dagger offhand if you need the healing for the fight, you should also just rotate between fire and water in that case outside of weave self. Keep in mind that focus has really good cc too though.
---
I mainly didn't care about sigils and used what was in my inventory, just wanted to check what this build has become. Last I tried was before the aura rework so sword obviously won the race back then. Your sigil suggestions seem pretty solid though, I wouldn't personally run transference because gotta greed that dps.
---
You can probably swap the glyph out for something, but I would rather not take icebow, probably water signet maybe or the res glyph. Unravel might also work for sword to instantly fully attune to water especially with dagger offhand.
---
Change their way of communication. Right now they barely tell us anything and they don’t even give us an update regarding promised features in the works. They don’t say anything untill actual release, but even then it’s not worth the secrecy with the kind of content they give us.
---
In LS2 she didn't really sound the same, and they had the same VA back then lol.
---
At this point I'm not sure, if they themselves knew what they were trying to achieve here.
---
Shouldn't there be a long term plan? Something to be able to compare target performance and actual performance? Some document saying something along the lines of:"Holosmith is intended as a DPS spec that requires juggling heat, which amplifies damage but punishes players with significant self damage for overheating \[...\]". If a DPS spec fails at its intended purpose, then the designer has failed at his task.
---
Also, I'm at this point fully convinced that build diversity, a questionable goal in and of itself, will either manifest on its own, or never become a thing at all. Forcing it doesn't seem to work.
---
Talk about a serious case of dragon breathe.
---
I'm talking about the Requiem set design, I don't give a damn what you think about my character, lol. You got the wrong expectations when it comes to the high fantasy genre, that's all. You should probably update them, it seems that you duplicated your expectations from low fantasy.
---
Shutup or they will nerf reapers onslaught.
---
Oh man, my first thought was "we have the skimmer" but maybe this boat mount has a utility all its own. Maybe the first one is a little skiff, and you can ride it speedily around on top of the water, with you in the back turning the rudder to give it direction, with another control for the engine. And a toggle appears when it slows to a halt that allows you to stand up and walk around inside where new skills appear, like the ability to fish or something! Maybe boat mastery has you unlocking these skills.
---
And then the second boat mount is a submarine. And the third is something bigger than a skiff, like a house boat or a yacht. And you could move around inside of all of them.
---
And of course, this would be a fun way to introduce the group mounts that one can see in concept art. Have your friends on your boat! Share a drink with them from the cooler, cheer when they catch something big, play cards or belcher's bluff at the table in the submarine. Etc.
---
Ok, all of that is entirely unlikely to actually happen but god its So fun to think about.
---
full condi dagger/warhorn-for-heat-sync-sand-squall tempest clocks in at around 28k without spotter and EA but loses too much if you try to heal with it as well.
---
did you not see the pulsing damage aoe and the 4 afk players he was healing
---
I like it.
---
You’re always going to have people that don’t follow the norm, regardless of if it is their nature or culture. If Rox feels the way she does, odds are there’s at least a few others. If you happen to find them, why not make a small village that grows over time? They’re not just humans with fur, they’re Charr that didn’t like how things were. And they still have a bit of “the whole village raises the child” mindset.
---
Maybe a submarine too
---
Inquest show up everywhere. I'd like to have **one** season where they're not involved at all.
---
You make quaggan sad :(
---
Junundus could crawl underwater, burrow, and those kind of things.
---
just wanted to clarify that hard light arena is not "decent for support"
---
&gt; In pve is there pretty much no reason to take scrapper ~~over~~ **or** holo
---
fixed it for you
---
Season 5 story to be designed for 5 player groups. While I love the story in the game, I only play through it twice (once for the story, again for achievements). If they basically turned these instances into dungeons (with hard modes and unique rare drops), I'd be more likely to replay them over and over again with friends. Obviously keep a story mode version for the easy single player experience to remain.
---
Come to think of it, may as well ping /u/queicherius and see if he has anything to help us with. Maybe it would be possible to download the datasets from GW2Efficiency for our own accounts?
---
I'm scared of them adding water mounts, because that probably means underwater content, which means a lot of underwater combat...
---
After they turned the Norn in general into the most forgettable race in this game, the Breaking of the Fang into a bad joke, wasted the best Norn, Eir Stegalkin, and threw her into the trash and replaced her with one of the worst characters ever?
---
No, I'm convinced Anet is literally unable to do anything good with them.
---
Idk man people been sayng they want more communication from anet regarding a possible expansion, but it seems like people where not around when PoF dropped.
---
LW3 season barely finished and we got the PoF announcement. that stuff got the community excited.
---
Guild wars 2 is the only real game they have currently. sure there have been some layoffs and the team has to find a rythm again but there is still tons of devs working there i'm sure they will be working on something after season 5.
---
the arah infusion is so necrotic that it "skins* you alive ;3
---
&gt; shouldn't it have some good points?  
---
Comunity says no. Sadly... I mean Weaver is totally fine.. Yes it has 38k dps, but it offers nothing else. No easy accessible CC, almost no support or groupwide boons etc. And rota is cancer. :/  
---
Meanwhile DH performs mostly the same, has better utility and better support as weaver. And the rota is braindead... But thats fine I guess. And look at cChrono. Fucking 44k dps with superior CC (for little to no dps loss) and some useful utility and self sustain.
---
LOL. A vocal minority will complain no matter what. Nothing anet does will fix that.
---
&gt;  Maybe it would be possible to download the datasets from GW2Efficiency for our own accounts?
---
Already possible-ish. You can download all the data that gets shown in the charts via the API the charts on the site use, but since it's not a public API I am not giving any guarantee's for breaking schema changes.
---
For example, for account value ( https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/values.summary.value ) the API call is https://api.gw2efficiency.com/tracking/personal?tracking_key=values.summary.value&amp;access_token=API_TOKEN
---
I would personally live this but oh GODS the QQ that would pour from the orifices of every casual.
---
I would say ask around in-game.  
---
I can understand, if you are F2P, that Map Contacting is difficult.  
---
But you should be looking where other people play.
---
I dig this idea. Certain parts of the expansion stories are challenging, I think anyway. Scaling up the difficulty and reward in those specific encounters and making them 5-player would be fun.
---
I use PHP scripts to log the buys &amp; sells into my MariaDB. It's a bit different to Excel but what you want to do should be possible. You will need to use VBA and XMLHTTP I think to decode the JSON response from Anet's API.
---
The links are for buys:
---
 
---
 https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/transactions/history/buys?page_size=200&amp;access_token=
---
For sells:
---
 https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/transactions/history/sells?page_size=200&amp;access_token=
---
Once you have those, you need to parse the header to count the pages it returns (X-Page-Total) and then you can loop through it with the page argument.
---
 https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/transactions/history/buys?page_size=200&amp;access_token=&lt;XYZ&gt;&amp;page=1
---
This will return things like item ID, item price (coppers), item qty, the time in UTC I think and so on. You can match the item ID with the items API in a similar fashion.
---
You can see an example with my alt's API (use Chrome):
---
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/transactions/history/sells?page_size=200&amp;access_token=C6CC5079-5B9B-E443-846A-E7334EA4227C16675F1F-AA2A-43E7-B584-8F19F5911387&amp;page=0
---
Anyway the things you should google are how to use XMLHTTP or decode JSON in VBA. Or something like [this](http://excelerator.solutions/2017/08/16/import-json-to-excel-using-vba/).
---
Just [saw that](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/cfy8rp/the_eruption_creates_a_phoenix_on_the_side_of/) in /r/Europe and had to think of [Phoenix](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phoenix).
---
It is infectious an infection. They’ve even gotten me to feel negatively about gw2. I’ve stopped buying into it all.
---
page_size only goes up to 200 (so 200 per page). You need to paginate like do page=0,1,2,3.....1000000. The max is determined by the X-Page_total which you get from the headers.
---
So just add &amp;page=0 after your link or &amp;page=1 etc you will see them all.
---
That's cause core ranger just isnt working.
---
Ranger is supposed to be a pet class, but PvE - wise pets are literally useless, they're nothing more than glorified utilities.
---
So soulbeast ends up a being like core ranger cause ranger is a petless class by default.
---
The most fun i had with ranger was when iboga did a lot of dmg, core ranger actually felt like a pet class for once, but they nerfed it cause of druid....they could've just nerfed pets for druid only.....which later they did anyway.
---
I've seen the idea of making LW story instances into **optional** 5-man dungeon like challenges, a hard mode of sort if you like. That way they can save resources on creating totally new instances while giving something to both solo and group oriented players.
---
They never said expansion worth content. They said expansion worth features. It's not the same thing.
---
Disgusting bis players that care about pushing the limits of the game how dare they
---
Thank you
---
That explains angry toxic casuals barking every time something requiring a little engagement from them appears in game.
---
Because it takes fucking ages to swap all the stats on your gear, all the jewelry, all the runes and sigils and infusions. Being able to swap your load-outs with the press of a button is basically angels singing god's praises.
---
This is my current situation too, I got from zero to Fractal God on my engi, I probably have 700 or 800 LI of my total amount on engi alone.
---
Engi is my only character with most maps completed, I really liked to play Holo but it feels so clunky right now
---
Might have ignored it because my teacher doesnt play and I couldnt get a good angle to draw it. But psssh :D
---
North, South, West, and Oast? I'm confused :p Looks really cool! I like the feel.
---
Even if this post made it to r/all nothing would happen. You're just gonna have to change his name.
---
&gt;you will never have balance.
---
There are gaps on every class regarding performance but theses gaps can and will be ignored if whatever the class puts on the table is worthwhile for the team comp.
---
FF's balance works like that, even the less damaging DPS specs bring something else (like a group buff) that makes them desirable regardless of the personal bench.
---
In this particular case they widened the gap significantly for everyone, not just engi. Things like weaver and Firebrand got massive buffs over everything else.
---
Griffon from lighthouse to the top and skyscale from there on.
---
With this you show, that you don't know anything bout necro...
---
if you name a char like this, you have to expect that you have to change it at some point.  
---
just to make clear, idc about the name, its funny. but i can see why the support won't change it back to original.
---
No.
---
Just no.
---
Change that name and move on.
---
Ost
---
Norden Ostern Süden Westen
---
Its a cool mount.
---
Thank goodness.
---
Awesome job needs the toilet tho!
---
Gw2 used to be so simple back in 2012, dungeons &gt; currency &gt; skins,  and that was actually pretty motivating, the citadel of flame heavy armor was the bees knees and we all stood in front of the gate to lfg and do the event to open the dungeon for ez path 1 and 2, and competent groups did path 3 cause it was hard xD 
---
This needs to come back, no garbage loot and elitism inducing points and whatnot, just plenty of content with different difficulties and enough meaningful rewards, as in skins of any kind, not some bullshit achievement point or a title or some other junk loot to salvage and never pay attention to.
---
And more hard core content wouldn't be that bad either, skilled people should be rewarded for their efforts and deserve prestige hard to get skins, and they are fully in their right to prance about with said skins! 
---
Season 1 actually did everything right, except it was temporary and never improved on..
---
Burn me, it's a stingray.
---
Are you still F2P? I can give you a PoF key if you'd like it!
---
Oh God, not the cliff racers!
---
I understood that reference!
---
People have been suggesting kits as the class mechanic for a while now... I'm still on the fence about it. For one, it would require us to relearn how to play the entire class. For two, people who don't want to play with kits would essentially have it forced upon them. For three, it means the elite spec is "just another kit"
---
They do have a pyramid structure but not all pyramids end in a singular point. ;)
---
We don't really know much about the Sons of Svanir either. So its pretty par the course of typical lack of asura and norn lore beyond asura ex machinas.
---
As for Aetherblades: they're hiding out in the Edge of the Mists under Mai Trin. It's the Molten Alliance who truly disappeared. We never even learned who led the MA or TA for that matter.
---
As they should IMO. It's really shitty to not be able to play the profession you want optimally just because another race has a much better racial for it.
---
Not sure if you know, machinist doesn't over heat anymore.  Part of the new update.
---
Would it really be retreading GW1 if we're going after a renown gw2 villain who wasn't in gw1?
---
I mainly played Chrono and power Holo. Not anymore...
---
We won't be retreading anything. It's a different time line.
---
The game is set in the same world as the last, deal with it.
---
You're joking, but some culling would be nice.

I have the site datawars2.ie (was gw2.silveress.ie)  
---
One of the features I have is the ability to archive transaction data beyond the 90 day official api limit as well as improvements for folks who have too many transactions for gw2bltc to load well. (I compress the data down, up to 97% smaller)
---
A friend asked me earlier to make it available in Excel, and then when I was half way done another linked me to this thread.  
---
So I now have a csv endpoint for transaction history
---
Ye will need to get two things to use the endpoint: 
---
* ACCOUNTID: yer gw2 account ID, the one that has teh 4 numbers at the end
---
* SESSION: this is the session cookie from my site
---
Session:
---
1. Sign up/Login to https://datawars2.ie/login
---
2. Press F12
---
 * Chrome: Application
---
 *  Firefox: Storage
---
3. Cookies
---
4. Session, copy the big long session key.
---
*****
---
##Using it in excel
---
The links you will be using are as follows:
---
* ``https://api.datawars2.ie/gw2_site/v1/transactions/buy/csv?accountID=ACCOUNTID&amp;session=SESSION``
---
* ``https://api.datawars2.ie/gw2_site/v1/transactions/sell/csv?accountID=ACCOUNTID&amp;session=SESSION``
---
Then use https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-to-a-web-page-power-query-b2725d67-c9e8-43e6-a590-c0a175bd64d8#ID0EAAFAAA=Newer_versions to import the data into excel
---
The resulting data should be like: https://imgur.com/YiwJR0z.png

I wouldn't mind their presence being more than "oh hey something else the Inquest are studying in an evil fashion" but my point is that first, lets have an Inquest-free season.

when is the best time to exchange gem for gold?
---
I understand that you’re worried about the game. I really do. I was when I heard about the layoffs at ANet, but I still have faith in the community. (Even with all the jaded opinions, recently, they have a point) 
---
In regards to the raids and other competitive stuff without a hardcore community, there are still casuals who are willing to put in the effort to become more “hardcore.” I don’t like the distinction between the two because both sides automatically deem the other to be of less value. Hardcore players help the more competitive and hard parts of the game, while the casuals can help get their friends into the games and might even be more willing to spend money on the game. 
---
If too many hardcore players leave, I suppose ANet can tweak the difficulty scaling of the raid bosses and particularly hard meta events, and then it’d force them to pay more attention to PvP and WvW. I do hope they give those modes more than just a passing glance, though. I feel bad for the people who love those modes, but don’t get the attention they deserve.
---
All this breathing on your squad and you are not even using Fresh Air or Minty foods? Yikes.
---
^It looks fun to play and a good support!
---
Could it be [The Rebuilding of Lion's Arch](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/guild-wars-2-the-rebuilding-of-lions-arch-live)?
---
[10 people is far too many people.](https://youtu.be/-fSm5tdAUN8)
---
That'd be fluff, not content.
---
Sure, technically you're right and every new texture added can be considered new content, but let's be real here.
---
Norn were the most interesting to me out of all the races.
---
A buddy and I were so god damn happy that we were able to get back in after they blocked it off.
---
If it's impossible, please remove t1 shattered observatory from recommended fractals
---
Those stubby little legs and knees. Yikes
---
That's it! Thank bud
---
I can’t deny that the game doesn’t draw in nearly as many players as it could, or deserves. I’ve only known about it for two years, and really only because my friend told me about it. 
---
I agree that the more invested players tend to be the backbone of the community, but it’s a little disingenuous when people claim the hardcore community is all that matters. I’m glad you touched on that it’s more complicated than it seems. 
---
Regarding repeatable content, I personally think the content is extremely repeatable. I’ve played through the Personal Story more times than I care to count now, I play through the entire story on all my characters, go through all the maps I have available and I don’t truly get bored. I think the game has a problem with it’s hardcore community because they are likely the people who play for longer periods than most. Thus, I think they’re a lot more likely to feel burnt out. 
---
From what I’ve seen, people like to play the new content to death the first time it’s released, but then feel starved for even more content when they’ve played the previous one over a thousand times.
---
Two things are missing : Personal housing and the ability to unlock different classes on the same character.
---
Wasted potential.
---
Because there was also a maguuma expansion in GW1...
---
Going to the same locations isn't really a similar structure between games. Especially when the sequel goes to dozens of new locations (Orr and Dajkah being prime examples atm).
---
Make sure your monitor is plugged into the graphics card, not the motherboard.

The graphics card output is usually the one lower down which is where your graphics card is.

Each mound of snow takes 250 snowflakes to create. That ends up being 1,073,741,822,250 snowflakes. If you purchase all those at the current buy price (75 copper), that works out to be 8,053,063,666 gold, 87 silver, and 50 copper.
---
...I'm sure there's a lot of TP barons with a ton of money, but I don't think any of them have anything close to 8 BILLION gold...
---
&gt; As much as I want different things, ArenaNet have given us no reasons in the last seven years to believe they are capable of world building their own world anymore. Not the way they currently write their stories.
---
So very true. Its like they are playing in a ocean that is 2feet deep. It has been better with PoF and S4 i think (at least in some areas) than previous seasons but everything moves so fast in the story that it all feels so shallow.
---
Again, thank you for your continued work and dedication!
---
How does one update their current taco while also rentaining their current pack, like tekkit for example?
---
Just overwrite the old folder with the contents of the zip.
---
Thank you! \o/
---
If it helps you feel any better, I had the exact same thing happen with a customer that I built a powerful gaming computer for.
---
I only noticed it when I came out to do some updates on it.
---
He never complained because it was still an upgrade from his last PC.
---
Well, I have faith in the community because a lot of interactions I’ve had with it were with people in game. They are genuinely the nicest people I’ve met. (Except for one person, but that’s one out of thousands I’ve had the guts to talk to) 
---
When you talk about the casuals, I get the feeling you mean the ones that think they deserve everything for simply playing the game. Which, are a loud minority. I’m casual, I play the game when I have time, or when I feel like it. I’m still working on getting Skyscale, Griffon, and Beetle. But I don’t complain when it’s too hard. I just take a break, or look up a guide. 
---
It’s kinda rude and inconsiderate that you think casuals aren’t even real players. Just because they don’t play like you, or enjoy other things doesn’t mean they aren’t players.
---
You can kid yourself all you want but you do not have a community in open world, not anymore. It's a sham of what it once was just like every other part of the game. 
---
Face it Mr Hardcore Casual, spamming 1 together is not a fucking community lol, NOT EVEN FUCKING CLOSE.
---
The difference is the level of engangement, I don't know why people like you struggle to see that - open world is not engaging, there is zero investment in it. What do you call a community that's not invested at all in itself? It's a crowd, not a community.
---
Depends on the size of the market.
---
If EU regulations are created then ANet would be forced to comply.
---
That's not canon at all. The gods were initially unaware of the presence of Elder Dragons upon their arrival on Tyria, but then started to notice them. When they realized their presence and their usage of magic would draw the Elder Dragons to them, and that they could not kill them without endangering Tyria, they left the world behind. 
---
The origin of the dragons is still a mystery even to Anet (they've said so in GuildChat), what we know is that they've been around far longer than the gods and that they probably shaped the "magical ecosystem" through millennia of sleeping and feasting until it was dependent on their presence and the specifics of their metabolism (bleeding magic out slowly etc.).
---
I don't think so. I think the AoE Loot "skill" automatically places all loot in your inventory. Autoloot: Autopickup only applies to the Search interaction. If you have the autoloot mastery, you could try unchecking that option, but I don't know if that will work.
---
Man, it sucks that we lost Ben Arnold. :(
---
If ERP was 5 man we could XD
---
Oh hey looks like Orgrimmar
---
if you cc him, he gets invulnerable
---
Check gamevice out as controller. That was for me the dealmaker
---
GW2 is that game that looks great on the first glance. But do not take a second look at some things or get to invested because the illusion just shatters before your very eyes.
---
33k is the condi build. Extremely hard to play on most condi bosses requiring a stationary target. There is 1 boss where it's decent, maybe 2. Desmina and sab and you need like a lot of luck with walls at desmina to work. Core condi engi does probably the same damage as holo. Why can't the glass dps specilization you know, do dps?
---
30k after hours of golem grind is just too low. I can get 20% higher on weaver first try. Even higher as condi. Tried gorseval yesterday. Swapped to reaper after 2 tries. Wasn't even able to cc it on engi. Had also way higher dps on reaper and that build is far from meta aswell.
---
To me Wasted potential that i hope that the devs focus in and harness. Arguable one of  the best blends of action/traditional mmo gameplay, but there are elements from so many games they should be taking and adding to their game especially throughout the years. 
---
They do a lot right but a lot wrong as well they don't really have a good rewards system in the game which makes it easier to put down or run out of things to do(oh you could put it down and come back! Thats not what you usually play mmos for...a suitcase game). They have good ideas but often execute them poorly or half assed which sours what would be an excellent experience. The recent living world shows me they can still improve but i still worry.
---
whats the max amount of Legendary insight we can get in a week now?
---
nice work?
---
when you "kill off" dungeons, make new fractal releases easy af (99 &amp; 100 cm are regarded as one of the best fights in this game, why not more of that) and say raids is your new hard content now and then there is nothing coming...idk.  
---
we had 25 explorable dungeon paths at release. then 10 more fractals still in year 2012 with 5 additions end of year 2013 and then a big long nothing. few reworks here and there..."3 raids per year meme".
---
Plus, it's kittening hot out here on the east coast, we need this to cool down!
---
That's actually a really good description!
---
whos this character. srry im new to the game
---
ty :)
---
find yourself a nice community based guild in the guild recruitment subreddit :)
---
what are the benefits of doing world boss?
---
Thanks, let us be friends.
---
I think that’s what they meant, but they really needed a comma there...
---
This is sad, but I've been playing for 4 years now, and still don't know this...
---
In the first phase of the fight against Claw of Jormag, you can look at the Corrupted Ice Shield in front of him to tell how close it is to going down so you can finally rush in and do damage.
---
Is there anything like that for the 2nd phase?  I know you need to protect the golems going to him, but I never found a good way to tell if the golems safely reached him, or how many more hits we need before his shield breaks in the 2nd phase
---
i would have done it before lvl 80 for free lvling
---
It goes way beyond that canonically, but GW2 just butchered their lore. It's sad.
---
Giving up the swords is very difficult if you play Renegade in mostly overworld PvE. In raids or vs World Bosses, it makes sense to go Mace/Axe for the pure DPS, but the lack of utility just feels bad when roaming. That said, even in full Viper gear, Renegades get a passive +30% crit chance, which can cap the stat with Fury. This is why Condi Renegade is so strong; you don't have to compromise Power for Condi, you just build full Condi and get both for free. Right now I'm running around with Sword/Sword, Shortbow in Shiro/Kalla. Engage with Sword 5, Icerazor's Ire, f2 f4, swap weapons and invoke Shiro, roll back with Riposting Shadows, then unload all your bow skills. You open up any vet with 25 might and weakness, on top of full stacks of Kalla's Fervor. It's dumb.
---
Please no dragons for a while 🙆🏻‍♂️
---
LS1 was when Scarlett first became a nuisance. LS2 was when we started seeing the results of her actions as Mordremoth started causing trouble.
---
The fatal flaw of thieves is the utility is never better than the multitudinous +%damage traits. Yes you *can* go into cool builds that use stealth and combos and pistols...or you can press 51111111 but harder.
---
It’s a display bug when you look at décoration outside of the guild hall. If you check back while you are in the guild hall you will see the correct amount.
---
Our story is actually a little deeper than that, we met in GW1 in party for Domain of Anguish and got into an argument that ended up with us chatting for 4 hours.
---
Afterwards, we played GW1 everyday together until GW2 was released, then we started a guild over there together. And we grew closer and closer, I was with him through his ups and downs in his life and then he asked me to be his girlfriend. 
---
Flashforward a few years, we got married with some of our guild in attendance (my best friend, our two co-leaders and one of the upper officers) and I moved from my homeland of Canada to the States to be with him.
---
We still play GW2 everyday!
---
- Druid: +++Vitality on your pet but no pet-swap. so that even in PvE you have a use for your healing abilities.
---
Implying Mesmer GS doesn't actually hit things. Y'know, despite GS Shatter Mes being the most terrifying burst in the game kek.
---
You hardly need to dedicate your life to the game in order to play it properly lol.
---
I don't understand this notion of "I only have 2 hours a week so I can't put any effort into the game". It's completely ludicrous for the majority of an MMO community to well, hate playing the game as a fucking game over a social tool.
---
Only got 2 hours a week to play? That's fine, doesn't mean you have to reduce yourself to only logging in to do dailies or collections or fashion wars. I have/had plenty of people in my casual guild that only had 2 hours a week to play and half of them put effort into playing it and half just logged in to have a chat. Guess which half are actually -playing- the game.
---
Don't get me wrong, casual play is fine and I think it's an integral part of what makes MMOs so great. You have no idea how many hours I've spent AFK'ing in my guild hall just chatting with people or how many times I've went to Queensdale to help noobs or how many collections/achievements I've casually done. 
---
Just when you limit yourself to only playing 5% of what the game has to offer without putting any effort into it at all, I don't consider that playing a game lol.
---
It's a public 1. Make sure you name your game "Guild Wars 2" and it's the only public config.
---
Everyone says Engi is harder, which, granted, yes it is.
---
But kitless sword Holosmith is a thing that exists and is pretty good in every gamemode. It's also tons of fun with very little investment into a learning curve.
---
haha :D
---
But don't you think that the Commander being an actual Elder Dragon Aurene's unique weakness would be quite interesting?
---
It's not my desire to see everything I wrote happening. It's just a fanfiction.
---
Thank you, a brief visit to LA granted me my rewards! That's a bit weird though, isn't it? Especially since it isn't specified that only the cities give out the tier rewards. I probably wouldn't have gotten them until Wintersday, had I not known that they exist!
---
it's something i come back and play once every year or two for maybe a month. i always end up getting bored with the game and i have lost hope for the future so it's really just an itch that i occasionally need to scratch, my favourite thing was the style of the game until they started adding all the cancer infusions and ridiculous mount skins, all the skins that look even slightly weeby. i've never liked the story that much and i think the writing is awful but i used to be able to overlook that.
---
It’s not an excuse to not work for anything in the game, though. It’s just an explanation as to why someone can’t exactly do everything the game has to offer at once. I never said it was to get around having to earn anything in game, and a lot of people think like that too. 
---
Why would someone like me play PvP when I have no interest in it, or in my case, have severe anxiety when it comes to games. Would I not be playing the game simply because it’s not my cup of tea? Or would I just be a lowly, filthy, casual because I don’t invest as many hours into the game as I can? If you play the game how you like, why should someone get bent out of shape and tell them they aren’t playing the game right?
---
Yes, corruption skills inflict a condition on you, but most necros don't care about them anyways, but they don't lock you out of your shroud, or prevent you from gaining life force.
---
How able next balance patch they make it so that necros can't use shroud or gain life force while they have minions?
---
That’s understandable. I’ve been getting a bit more jaded towards the game as well, but I still enjoy a lot of what the game does right.
---
Yes, because that made sense, good job.
---
That’s really sweet!! I’m so happy that you guys still enjoy the game together!
---
That game that I used to love and now only play once a week to suffer through raids.
---
Are you on EU or NA server?
---
I agree.. I think this subreddit is a bit too busy with the “GW2 is dying” thing.. It sucks cause I love this game, but everyone is so quick to shit all over it.
---
It was a disappointment in the beginning. It became interesting and i got the glimps of Hope and excitment for the future. Now after all this w8ing. Sadness.
---
indeed, I also like it more simple :D
---
To add to what /u/BackIsBachus said, you can also earn 10 LD per week from the PoF raids (wings 5-7) and then convert them to LI 1:1.
---
I'm not a PvP person.
---
But what speaks against looking up guides and videos and then trying out what you might like?
---
Afaik you can hop into PvP with a lvl1 char. So just roll whatever, join PvP, try it out and Delete&amp;Repeat if you don't like it?
---
Wasted potential
---
The ritual is begun. What is set in motion can only be undone if we falter!
---
How would you personally make it better? What are you looking for in the game?
---
I won't call this enticed.....
---
How can you keep the community enticed by providing no info. at all??
---
Guild Wars 2 is a fun and engaging action adventure game that you can play with friends. You can be running around on your own, with your own agenda, and suddenly be thrust into a big event with tons of people, and hen part ways again with little fuss. You can contact others and try to get more organized to take on even greater challenges, and work together to do things you can’t possibly do on your own. The world is huge, there’s tons to do, tons to see, tons of things to collect, and you can do it all on your own time. There’s no pressure. You can minimize the stress, the anxiety, the addiction. You can drop the game and pick it back up again whenever you want without feeling like you’re going to be left behind.
---
These are all the things that I love about Guild Wars 2, and I hope the game never loses these qualities.
---
yup someone does it my friend told me to look on here for a group .
---
Peak vomit
---
Yes, but we don’t need to hear it now. They can leave for another living story season. Aurene must be out of picture for a long time. Dragon fatigue has hit gw2
---
he said thats how he done it to
---
OC Cpu to 5ghz with adequate cooling (probably a 360mm radiator) or try d912pxy tool.
---
Hey guys, does anybody have a link to guides and resources for returning players for me?
---
Reapers are OP in dps, definitely need a nerf or buff other professions.
---
Well heroic requires the weapon spefic achievements, but less overall map material than stellar/astral. However both ascended sets to complete require a load of ascended materials and vision crystals which can be a pain.
---
Heroic also requires the unique jewels which only come from the dwarven puzzle room sequence.
---
However, the sheer amount of kralkatite ore and dust you need for the stellar ascended ones is insane...
---
Check this video:
---
https://youtu.be/3dnu2tci8JI
---
&gt; you can overflow these?
---
Actually overflow the quantity? No. Cause a visual bug that only happens when you're outside the Guild Hall? Yep. Fairly easy to do.
---
Maybe the Commander finds him/herself in the middle of a deeply personal story, involving his/her family or something to that nature. That could be a situation where the commander asks everyone else to stay behind. Meet a bunch of new friends, see some fresh faces, and at the end, the commander ends up getting saved and learns that the whole squad has come to help in the final boss fight. Use all that to somehow segway us into Cantha :P
---
&gt;I noticed a ~~lot of people~~ *small percentage of whiners online* dissapointed
---
FTFY
---
100 people in an open world "boss" which respawns every 2h and from whom only the 20~ bother to dps while the other 60 just hold 1 and the last 20 hit the boss for 20k and now sit afk by alt-tabbing to their facebook while they are upscaling the "boss".
---
all of them get the same reward, a few silver
---
casuals have their fun with the cheap non deserving dopamine hits but thats it. once the casual starts playing a bit more/progresses he realizes that there is no fulfillment with the game and gives up, out of the 43 people i have in my friendlist only 1 is online its just sad.
---
you will find people having fun even if they are playing lineage 2 private servers but it doesn't change the fact that the game (in the official server at least) is dead with 95% players beings bots/non-stop macro setup
---
the point is, what is the game's future ? what is announced/scheduled ?
---
BDO got recently (last year i think) their DX11 upgraded (the remastered edition)
---
BNS is moving from DX9 to DX11 + from UE3 to UE4 fixing its trash client and upping its capabilities next year
---
every game i personally play has announced what they are going to do.
---
Riot with league and tft are always in touch with the community announced even 2-3 patches ahead that they are going to do and are open about the changes, people even boycott them from time to time.
---
Do we have any idea what is Arenanet doing right now ? The last announced schedule i can recall is the remake of WVWVW with the implementation of alliances which has been late for over a year now.
---
So in conclusion i agree with /u/Lovefully-kun
---
If they are good enough to displace the meta then being that race becomes mandatory for the new racial spec meta build and this would just make e.g. every ranger sylvari or something. 
---
Plus sell a ton of level 80 boosts and people are forced to reroll. 
---
If they aren't good enough to displace the meta then they'll be no different than what we currently have (i.e. pointless fluff you can use in open world where no one cares if you want to)
---
For just about everything in open world
---
I know this doesn’t answer your question since it seems you figured it out already, but if you didn’t know you: if you don’t have enough mistonium saved up yet you can map comp jahai (takes maybe 15-20min) on each character for a free +25 and seems to be a pretty high chance at dropping a BLK as well. Only mentioning this because I literally just finished requiem armor 3 days ago. ALSO. If you contribute to the World Boss rush the 4th tier box contains +50 mistonium too. 
---
Good luck on the collection!
---
~~but i cant have a loving wife cause everyone the commander loves dies ;w;~~
---
A video of that would definitely be useful, thanks.
---
On NA!
---
Thank you!
---
I´ll check it, thanks!
---
That is true. I think the Commander is destined to be forever alone :c
---
Does the Rev have a true place in raids? 
---
I've read a lot of answers are "no", but most of those are from years ago and I am wondering if that has changed?
---
Because they literally aren't playing the game lol. How hard is that to understand. If I go to a football match and refuse to run, would you say I'm playing it correctly? No.
---
How do I retweet a reddit comment?
---
I wouldn’t equate not wanting to try out an optional mode to not wanting to run in a football game. I’d equate it to a soccer player not wanting to do track because it’s not his thing. 
---
Also, thanks for insulting me and assuming I don’t understand. But listen, I don’t care how you play the game. That’s your business, and frankly not mine. But I care a lot when you go out of your way to shame people for playing the game how they like to, and calling them “fake players” or “casuals who dont wanna work for anything”. It’s needlessly rude, and it makes you come off as an elitist gate keeper. 
---
So kindly just accept that I don’t play the way you do, and move on. I’m not budging on my opinion, and I doubt I can make you. So let’s just agree to disagree. We ain’t hurting anyone by playing the game how we like to
---
Thanks a bunch! I read ahead a lil and saw the mistonium wall looming up ahead, full map completion on Jahai is a good tip
---
Nobody is "chastising" the noobs.
---
It's the people who have thousands of hours in the game and refuse to put any real effort into playing it, duh.
---
I miss Zojja
---
I believe that was sarcasm.
---
So does that mean they're actually cosplaying the Enforcer (more realistic scale) and they're just gonna run around and football tackle anyone in their way?
---
Random question but is it possible to use taco to magnify when you have the revealed rebuff?  It is so hard to see on my ui scale

I don’t doubt that you’re passionate about the game. I am too, despite me being a filthy casual. But you can’t go around blaming all casuals for making the game something that isn’t for you. If anything, it’s ANet you should be pointing your hatred at. Disrespecting other members of the community, no matter how casual or hardcore they are, gets you nowhere. 
---
I don’t doubt that you’re a good person, these comments don’t define you at all. But you ought to not aim your negativity at other players, it just makes people think the community is worse than it actually is and creates an even larger rift.
---
Okay. I’ve tried being reasonable, and it does seem to me that you’re just being downright toxic at this point. You’re aiming your negativity where it shouldn’t belong, and not only that, you’re insulting me yet again for something that was on you to begin with. I’m done with this conversation.
---
lol even Quaggans had a bigger spotlight then Norns on that episode...and the one were we go to Thunderhead also dosent have anything norn related, its basically dwarf and even the damn moles had attetion lol how can you show Dredge and forget about the norns lol
---
why not make core mesmer DPS,chrono SUP and mirage CONDI? too hard for anet?
---
Cant have individuality or personal prestige in this game, just a bunch of shiny rabbits chasing a carrots on sticks until sooner or later they realize that's all there is to it. Missed opportunities around practically every corner.
---
Cerebro lives!
---
People seem to want that. Personally I want offhand sword.
---
That’s a pretty good idea for engi’s...  They should completely remove toolbelt skills for them if they spec out if core, and replace the f-skills with slightly toned down versions of gyros and exceeds.
---
This is the internet, I disrespect whoever I feel like baby.
---
You can't really blame Arenanet for this, they're a business. 
---
They put resources into whatever thinks will earn them the most money, sadly the path of short-term profit has also been the path that ruined all of the potential this game could have been.
---
Running away from any hint of a challenge just like any old typical casual. ):
---
What is that making the light gloves shimmer rainbow?
---
ah unfortunately I'm on EU, however I did find people to play with before through Reddit so good luck \^\^
---
Maybe, but it doesn't even require separate animations. It should be relatively simple to code if -&gt; then statements.
---
Or have the holo belt adopt rebalanced versions of the exceed tool belt skills, regardless of what utilities you're using.
---
Though it would take more work, I'd rather see photon forge be removed, and instead you have a heat bar that interacts with the existing tool belt in positive and negative ways.
---
Maybe something like... your heat defaults to a -1/s rate, and gains +1/s for every tool belt skill that's currently cooling down. Heat empowers you, but you can't spam your tool belt so you have to use it with more precision to maintain the balance, with the sweet spot being high heat but only one belt skill on cooldown at a time.
---
buy character slots and play them all?
---
Or option 2, play unranked with every class cause that will let you play and unlock every class at its final stage
---
The back aura is tied to the chest, once transmuted you will no longer have the aura.
---
I got around it by using a poly orange to dye all the undyeable parts on the leggy armor due to having a gold theme, but ofc that wont change its over all style.
---
That does not change the fact that others might not feel the same, also them with diagnoses. Rules are there for a reason, they never relate to personal situation but to the big picuture.
---
Honestly, I'm pretty sure they don't know how to balance engi.
---
I would like the functionality of whirls + superspeed to remain intact if they remove it. Superspeed + a whirl makes your toon move ridiculously fast and, if the skill being used has a travel distance, makes your toon move the full runspeed + whirl distance while performing the skill. This mobility interaction is very under-rated and is why I sometimes run Zeph runes for WvW builds.
---
This John sounds like he wanted to no longer pursue the outside world but the inner one.
---
Other Johns with many monitors possibly want to increase their productivity so they can spend less time in the ever existing mind formed cage we endure as to allow him to pursue his personal desires outside of the cage.
---
One's cage is often another's freedom, one's freedom is often another's cage.
---
You'd probably have warranty on it still then if it's only 4 months old.
---
PSU is at least a much cheaper part to replace than most.
---
If Steve is there I'm in.
---
We even have fourth dimension maps that span time!
---
Didn't really like it before I unlocked it.
---
Now it's my go-to mount for generally getting around. It's got vertical mobility, a dash, it climbs walls and it lets me fly over terrain, obstacles and mobs.
---
These are what nightmares are made of.
---
I'd be interested to know what the larger player base thinks. My guess is that the player base complaining in Reddit and the forums are such a subset of a subset of players that the complaints about balance are knee jerk reactions.
---
The other thing I think many people forget about us that balance is iterative and (sometimes) cumulative. I got the distinct impression that they do what balance they can during each patch, but there is limited dev time to work on balance and so something has to be pushed back each patch due to time. Not to forget it's vacation season in the US, so dev time is probably more limited than usual.
---
ArenaNet also has a bigger picture of what is needed and what they want than any of the internet communities do (going back to Reddit and the forums already bring an incredibly small subset of players).
---
Of course, everyone has the right to complain and be upset. It's just that the more I work in dev, The more I understand why (well to a certain extent) ArenaNet does some things the way they do.
---
I maxed out my ele bag slots a fear years ago and haven't played it since PoF release except for a few raids. Such a waste of gems :(
---
Also, the way ECSU works is just pointless... It enhances only 5 sword skills and 2 traits. It does nothing to the Exceed skills/toolbelt. They need to rework it to actually enhance all the holo skills, making it rewarding for those who are able to play close to the overheating threshold but do not overheat
---
You're misunderstanding what I'm saying.
---
I'm not saying the augment professions with racial skills. I'm saying turning a race into a profession. The key points would be the race.
---
Which means it would be okay for people to ask for specific races, because it wouldn't be any different from professions.
---
&gt;Daredevils' Sweep should be changed to act as a fast leap with evasion frames that stuns your target on hit while acquiring a Stolen skill as usual. Sleight of Hand increases Sweep's stun duration to 2 seconds.
---
Pls no. Making Swipe not only short but also slow would kill it off completely. If there is one thing that has to stay, it is the instant cast port.

May she one day return to us from the Eternal Alchemy
---
The report of her death is an exaggeration.
---
Thank you so much. Take a look!
---
This MMO has the best combat, and probably the best aesthetics as well.
---
It's not #1 because of dumb mistakes.
---
worse than nam flashbacks
---
A million times this.
---
Have the next current events be collecting legendary materials to turn Zojja and Mr Sparkles into Blish 2.0, like 500 of each dungeon token and other things from core Tyria.
---
Secondary quest is build yourself a legendary golem mount using the same tech that can switch modes to mimic the capabilities of any unlocked mount you have. (essentially an ingame earnable skin pack for all mounts)
---
Ignore and move on.
---
"Condi on Xera is so selfish"  He is not wrong though. You can't clear shit with condi.
---
&gt; I'm a ~~Mage~~ Mesmer now
---
Hm. I’ve seen plenty of interaction when I play, though I have to speak up. 
---
As for the community, I still do believe it’s pretty fun and great. Despite how its representation here on Reddit is, it’s a pretty fun community. Really, communication has to start from somebody, and almost nobody wants to speak in chat other than a “ty” for reviving them.
---
This is how "a pug" tells a story, when they think they have the moral high-ground:
---
* No screenshots of DPS logs
---
* No screenshots of chat logs with names tastefully blanked out to respect privacy
---
* No text formatting
---
Sorry, I sympathize for the supposed situation, but this is post is... [mediocre.](https://i.imgur.com/dLUEc2d.gif)
---
Amen to that. So tired of the white knighting and fanboyism, this game wouldn't be where it is today had ArenaNet paid attention to criticism during the first months.
---
How some people think they're making the game and the company a favor by pretending everything is fine is outright insulting.
---
...Seriously, you're an Anet employee using a public account, right? Because you're really trying hard on this one.
---
https://i.redd.it/ljaalw15bqb31.png
---
This was the attached picture.
---
No, I’m just a casual player who’s willing to wait for a game to update. It’s not the only game I play, and acting like it’s the end of the world if I don’t get what I want is silly.
---
The part i care about when it comes to the guilds that im in are the people. Sure, it would be great if guild missions weren't so bland or the guild hall could hold more decorations, but thats not the main reason why i joined my guilds
---
All im saying here is that to me, gw2 is a place to hang out with pals in my guilds
---
I feel you. Had sth similar maybe two weeks ago and an other well known guild in the raiding scene. I was flamed for playing condi FB. They where quiet after I had 29k at 50%. 
---
Story short: I was over 1k before there best dps and now have 6ppl more on my BL. 
---
Also: dont talk back to these kind of ppl. Just play your stuff and leave afterwards.
---
&gt;It's a bunch of PvP nerfs that majorly hit PvE and for seemingly no reason.
---
This is an old meme, but nowhere neat true nowadays. Most of these changes are random because "drawbacks for fluff", but make as much sense for PvP as for PvE... so not very much. As a result, many builds that were not meta got nerfed even further, while the real op stuff gets only addressed really slowly in small steps or not at all.
---
Sometimes I think the subreddit is full of (paid or not) shills who flutter in with brainless positivity. They're specially visible every time there's a big controversy, and they all speak the same artificial way.
---
Like, seriously. It doesn't help the game. The problems won't go away just because you pretend we live in rainbowland all happy together.
---
That's actually really cute! I met my wife in Guild Wars 2 as well. We met in Nightmare Court dungeon, she was using a male character. Since I'm very socially awkward around girls, that helped (lol). For the longest time I threated her like I would threat any friend and that made me grow close to her, until the day the Guild decided to start using Discord and I listened to her voice and realized my friend all this time was a girl and I could talk to her normally; I was smitten.
---
We were living countries appart, and now we're married!
---
Until you get tired and they become meaningless. It's hard to care about rewards you gained without any challenge.
---
Could be a reference to the Mystic Forge too, ironically.
---
I'm all about proving people wrong with numbers.  But you shouldn't post an image w/ their names/account names to the sub.  It's kinda the rules, fam.
---
\*steaös popcorn\*
---
I really want to know your "not douchebag" route.
---
Yeah, I get it. But we see a lot of posts like this on here. Imagine if every time someone had a negative experience with another player, they made a reddit thread complaining about it. It gets really old, really fast.
---
If someone's being a dick, just understand that they're not worth your time and move on.
---
I can think of a number of ways to improve the raid window.
---
As for multiple API key support, the only way I see that it could work without too much of a hassle is if TacO somehow recognizes the account you're playing on and you can bind an API key to the specific account. The way this could be done right now is so that you'd have to set up the API key per character as TacO only has access to the name of your current char.
---
Probably just better to use an actual magnifier overlay for your buff area
---
When drama is the content keeping gw2 relevant these days
---
if u join a pug and act like u are god of gw2 ofc we will show u that ur not welcome :)
---
sadly u didnt post all u wrote guess u had no balls to show how u act in pugs. Nobody cared about dps ur a solid cweaver player but if u permanently act like a asshole nobody will ever appreciate it treat people like trash and they will do the same with u u can do a million dps but u are still the same inpatient toxic kid
---
Asking for spotter before the squad is full and ur not even in the instance or commander started making groups just shows what kind of person u are next time show all u write and not only teh flame u get as answer :)
---
They aren't being toxic or elitist. 
---
Just supplying reddit with content 😂
---
He posted the log, that's big enough detail into the encounter lul
---
It's useful as the most generic mount you can hop on to, but it is not indisposable, which was what people at the time thought made it "worthless". It is also my go-to mount now.
---
They define the high road as take every insult and make sure you don't out DPS the elite raiders so you don't hurt their feely weelys.
---
If only male Norns looked that good (bottom right image). Every time I roll one, I end up deleting it. Female Norns are like goddesses- male Norns are malformed brutes. Why aren't they like gods to match? Makes me sad.
---
Nah, don't worry, this subreddit has a downvote problem; and not just against overly positive posts, mind you.
---
feely weely sounds accurate or maybe digital penis?
---
your a genius !
---
Unfortunately if they can't monetise it, they won't do it. 
---
So gem store flashing lights and skins for it?
---
I agree completely! The amount of freedom this game has is wonderful!
---
if anything by following the guides on that site you will actually overshoot your desired level since it doesn't take into account random exp bonuses. so if you follow the guide to get to 300 you might actually get up to 310 from the bonuses
---
of course its at 9pm on a thursday when i work 
---
at 7am
---
You can try to flip keeps during off peak hours with a few people or even go to edge of the mists and try there because almost nobody defends those.
---
Guards are located in every enemy objective. All enemy npc's can be considered guards.
---
As for ts problem I guess that your only solution is joining a populated international server.
---
They could do the skin idea but a mount to mimic other mount abilities? Yeah that will never happen since everyone would just use that one mount.
---
Not posting this witch hunt. If every player that plays any online game has to start posting their shitty interactions with people we'd only have stupid posts like these. I killed someone in pvp and he started to call me names, should I also post that? I mean since you are doing it.
---
At this point, it might actually be easier to just rebuild the dungeon from the ground up.
---
They have the assets and designs to work off of already, so it's *a bit* easier than fiddling with older code they really should just yank out from the game entirely.
---
&gt; Edit: Here's the Raid lobby right now, peak hours on a weekend. Looks so fun and inviting doesn't it?
---
just because i feel this needs a little bit of context: it is the last day of the weekend, right before a work day *plus* raids reset on monday morning. most people interested in some kills already got them for this week.
---
I maxed out all of my professions to 400 / 500 using this site. I'd recommend it. 
---
Note: If you use crafting boosters you'll need less materials that stated.
---
The doomsayers and jaded folks will always be out there, I just hope that there’s at least a little more positivity and hope. Why be so gloom and doom when they can try to enjoy the game? 
---
Of course, I think I ought to lay low in this subreddit for a bit. XD I’ve caused quite a... Stir.
---
[Marshal's Stellar Avenger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marshal%27s_Stellar_Avenger)
---
So then he didnt waste your time then?
---
Not even last night's storm could wake you. I heard them say we've reached Morrowind. I'm sure they're let us go.
---
The year is 2019.  
---
All games are still wasted potential.  
---
There is no hope.  
---
Wish us luck.
---
&gt;  I’m going to wait over 3 months to play 2 hour content....LOL
---
It would be more credible if you won't use the standard phrase.... LOL
---
However, here is you standard answer: The story is not the only content. And if you don't play certain stuff, it's your problem and not a "lack of content". ;)
---
this was a pleasure to read, thank you!
---
What you could do, is next time they post the meetup, is see if you can get a group together from that post. I know often times there is a NA crew that wants to do it past 5 CST.
---
Jokes aside, the gaming industry is pretty trashy nowadays.
---
I miss the golden age of modding in the early 2000's :(.
---
A game of unrealised potential.
---
To me, Guild Wars 2 saved me from a depression. After I had my daughter, I really questioned who I was. I had depression and anxiety that accompanied this new life I brought into the world. I started playing in 2016 with my husband as something to do. As someone who has never played any computer game but The Sims and frequents Nintendo consoles, this was an entirely new experience for me. I had never played anything like it. This game helped me bond with my husband and gave us something we both really enjoyed doing.
---
We played for about six months before we finished map completion and lost interest. Six month later, we decided to re-enter the game. This time, my husband called out for a guild. We were invited to our guild and began doing end game content we didn't realize existed beforehand. This included doing WvW every night with our guild.
---
My husband lost interest after a few weeks, but I began to bond with my fellow guildies. My guild leader and my guildies became some of my best friends. I have friends irl, but we have families and we don't see each other regularly. This game gave me a way to bond with other players. I play every single night on TeamSpeak with my friends. I regularly exchange gifts with my guild leader irl. They were there through my miscarriage last year. They are there through my life events, and I am happy to be there for them when they need someone to talk to.
---
I think if someone isn't part of a guild like mine, they are missing out on something amazing that is unique to an MMO game. I like the game, but I would have stopped playing a long time ago if I wasn't involved with my guild. I am happy to say I have made lifelong friends. I have now been playing almost every night with my guildies since 2017.
---
i have no idea how to do that i have friends more advanced into the game but there always busy and doing wvw .... i enjoy pve
---
Stay tuned for the next episode of "casuals suck, get the fuck out of my game pls".
---
Coming soon to a shitty reddit thread near you!
---
Well you make a post like the guy did stating time of event, what you'll do etc. 
---
But yeah if you've never done it might be harder. I haven't either so we could follow the dulfy guide for example
---
yeah i have already started it iv done 2 areas complete and im sick of it already lol  i dont get to play games like i did when i was younger and didnt have kids. i just want the mount . with less work lol
---
So I can craft 3 pvp legendary pieces (just made the wings so no enough tokens for 4th piece)
---
But at 300 gold per piece...
---
That's like 6 pieces of ascended armor I can make and swap around for same price
---
I finished all 3 requiem sets in the first 3 days i think. Maybe even sooner, can't remember. But had I waited longer than that, I probably wouldn't have even made a single set. those sigils man. Wish i had the common sense to buy them up and resell them.
---
Autoattacking isn't a difficulty mode. It's a cutscene.
---
Now, if a player had to dodge crazy aoe patterns *while* autoattacking, that would at least be fun.
---
My best shot:
---
* Matthew Brenher - Demolitionist Platt / Trahearne / Various male asura NPCs

---
Nonsense.  I have it on good authority that skyscale was too hard, too expensive, too tedious and proof that anet hates us all.  Everyone actually quit the game when it was released because time gates.  You’re having a hallucination or something.
---
Did it. I read the install instructions, but I assumed it was just a link to the github files lol
---
It's the curse of non-monospace fonts. :D
---
Sorry for the bad experiences :(
---
The Warclaw collection is definitely a pain in the ass. Most of the action is in the evening hours of your WvW server - if you're on a mostly German server check out when they are at 6 in the evening (most ppl start around this time because they got home from work). Weekends are also prime time, especially Friday and Saturday evenings. Just keep at it honestly, at some point your server has to capture a keep.
---
As for the language barrier, if they ppl on your server aren't willing to include you, it would be best to change your WvW server. The price depends on how active the server is in WvW, the lower server costs 500 gems to convert to and the highest 1800 gems. Some servers can't be selected at all because they're full (what ever that means to Anet). 
---
What country are you from if you don't mind me asking? Maybe we can find out which server would be best for you.
---
To me, gw2 has a lot of meaning.
---
First: it gives me quality time with my favourite sibling that already moved out.  My older brother brought me into the game and taught me how to jump any jp there is. He is my role model since I was little and I played gw2 mostly because I wanted to spend more time with him. However he stopped playing approximately a year after I got into it, which made me really sad at first, but now every time he visits or he logs in for some JP-afk-mesmer time I can tell him about all the cool stuff I did in gw2 and we can talk for hours about it. 
---
Second: it makes it possible for me to let my mind wander. I often have very stressful weeks because of school and with gw2 I can relax at the end if the day.
---
Third: gw2 opened another community for me. Not the in-game community, I'm talking about the Instragram-Gw2 community  (which is really big imo and worth checking out). I discovered that taking screenshots could actually be part of the endgame and thus I met some amazing people that I ended up inviting to my own guild. So gw2 means a lot to me when it comes to friendship and also leadership. Which leads me to..
---
Fourth: gw2 teaches me. I've been a guild leader for 3 years by now and I've learned so much. I experienced a lot of difficult situations between individuals, I needed to make hard decisions, I needed to realise my own faults and own up to them, I believe it made me a better human in the end. 
---
Generally, it enhanced the quality of my overall life.
---
Oh my apologies, I reposted this from a different subreddit and didn't realise my previous comment wouldn't appear. let me fix that.
---
Just like everybody got bored with the griffon and roller beetle!
---
...Wait.
---
Good  morning Reddit! I'm currently levelling up a newborn Sylvari  Elementalist (seen above) and I'm really loving the look of the  Snapdragon Shirt, but i'm having difficulty pairing it with anything.
---
I'd  love to hear all your feedback on lower body armour (pants / skirts /  whatever) and boots, particuarly ones that would look good in white,  with light blue/green accents.
---
Thanks in advance for your kind help!!
---
I would definitely advice you to start a new character and play for a while on that since quite a lot of things have changed. Once your comfortable with the gameplay, feel free to switch to your high-level characters and try the lvl 80 maps to get a feel for it.
---
What type of gameplay do you enjoy the most? Maybe we can figure out which class would suit you.
---
I’m glad it enhanced your life! It’s amazing how much games can positively affect us!
---
The Wiki states that 7 Golems are neaded to stun the Claw of Jormag.
---
Ehhh... At this point it's more of a resurrection if she ever comes back into the game. God knows why Anet won't just kill her off. I swear that company is being run by cats, seeing as how many open plot threads they keep dangling around.
---
I really didn't think a game can have such an effect but I was wrong obviously. Of course gw2 also has it's dark sides. Being a guild leader and all I am often I involved in ridiculous drama between people, but I see it as an annoying challenge that will be over in no time. Compared to the positive things this game has brought me I can live with that little bit of drama.
---
Whats the difference then? 
---
Elite Specs are features. Mounts are Features. New map is kind of a given. Maybe they will even think of a new feature like in the other two Expansions. All of this is also content worthy of an expansion though. The two are, in this context, interchangeable
---
I've used it several times as well!

This patch introduced some giant outliers with all those weaver builds
