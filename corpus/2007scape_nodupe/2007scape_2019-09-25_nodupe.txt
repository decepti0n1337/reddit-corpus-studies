I bought some bonds to speed things up after coming back; I had an old account with 99att, wc, and cooking - but when I tried to recover it (forgot the password), I found out it'd been hacked and the recovery email changed.

I didn't buy enough for top gear or anything, just enough that I could play some decent content without having to grind both levels and cash.

Offers "expire" if you leave them in for too long, I think a week.
---
You're asking for downvotes and here's why if you fail to see these reasons on your own.
---
You have **0 PvP suggestions** (more on 50-70 wilderness later) in your post. More PvM/Skiller content in the wilderness is not going to help PvP but rather hurt it. Bulk of your suggestions are designed to attract PvMers and skillers, the other few are designed to make PvMers more easy to kill. These suggestions are clearly aimed at accommodating salad robe pkers against PvMers and skillers and definitely not "all parties" as you claim.
---
The deep level wilderness is absolutely laughable. Level 126 vs level 56 isn't the hot PvP content everyone is looking for. There was a post about World 45 deadman not too long ago talking about how the lack of combat bracket limitations turns away new players from the mode because high lvls pick on them.
---
Throwing new best gp/hr content into the wilderness is not "oldschool vide" but rather a death knoll for wilderness. We need content that makes it more profitable to attack other skulled PKers as opposed to PvMers. We also could use some limitations on gear that can be brought into wilderness (maybe seasonally changed) to change up the meta on a regular basis. More PvM/skilling content pretending to be "PvP updates" is going to get a consistent no from me.

pre-99 is library, for which you don't need essence either

No it has pretty decent stats against magic and melee

If you don't have the Slayer level for it I doubt you'd have the combat levels for it either.

↑ click this picture  
---
You will see the value of all the shapes and colours.
---
Indigo Pentagon = 30  
---
Orange Triangle = 6  
---
Yellow Square = 12  
---
30 + 6 + 12 = 48  
---
But of course this is not the only combination.... u can use blue triangle (15) + blue triangle (15) + indigo triangle (18) to get 48 too.
---
Each shape is given a value (i.e orange square is 8) you must make 3 shapes equal 48 in your case.  So for example you could do indigo Pentagon (20) + indigo Pentagon (20) + orange square (8) = 48.  There are of course multiple ways to get 48, but you can drop all your shapes and talk to the gnome to get more random shapes.

The time you spend equipping a dragonbone necklace (replacing your occult) is more dps lost than what the imbued heart adds. That should give you an idea of how little it matters if you bring it or not.
---
It depends on if they followed their non-cosmetic counterpart in having the same alch value and if they cost the same to obtain.  Also if they could be turned into the real one once a member or if you have to buy it all over again.

If cost less -&gt; it sets the possibility of Wildy risk manipulation with identical items.

You being a shit player who uses standard client doesn’t make you better than everyone else 
---
Runelite is used for ground markers, boss timers, loot trackers, stuff like that. I use it mostly for timers above anything else. It also reminds me which farming plots I’ve used and which ones I haven’t and when they’re done, and how many water can uses I have left. Otherwise It doesn’t do anything for me. I don’t use ground markers ever and I’m not bad so I can do Jad on official client and as a matter of fact I did it before I found Runelite.

Why does the ancient staff have a negative prayer bonus, and why does the ancient magic altar drain your prayer to 0? Zaros is a God, so it would make sense that the altar would not drain your prayer and that the ancient staff would not have a negative prayer bonus.

Mainly depends on you. If you have the mining level for the top level and want to keep mining go with that first. If you need more levels to get into the top(72) and are not very close or do not want to keep mining. Go with the coal bag.

I've tried scraping item prices using the grand exchange API instead of relying on the OSBuddy API. It's possible to do especially for a one off scrape, but it takes a very long time depending on the amount of requests you're imagining.
---
Like other people have noted, Jagex will temporarily block your IP if you make too many requests to their API in a short amount of time. When attempting to scrape using their API, you'll need to set a generous timer between each request. For my successful attempt, I ended up using a delay of ~5-6 seconds between individual requests, and used a cool down timer that paused longer every so often. For reference, I scraped the grand exchange data of every item in the game, including requests to "bad" item id's that did not correspond to a real or tradeable item. With the delays necessary to avoid being IP blocked, it took about two and a half days (!!!) to make about 40k~ requests to their API.
---
TLDR: It's possible, but you might look into seeing if another third party has an API for you to reference instead due to the lengths Jagex goes to stop extensive/overuse of their official APIs.

Range is much faster because dhcb is 30% and DHL is 20% 
---
I’ve heard of people getting sub 50s with range setup
---
The point is to show that we don't want to encourage any direct sale of in-game progress. By choosing to buy a subscription instead of bonds you make it easier for jagex to see that a subscription-only model is feasible.
---
Nice to see the remaining devs in a picture together
---
AHK can be used but only as a button/key remapper. So A can become Z or left click etc. But not anymore for emulating mousekeys

With DHCB elite void and Salve at 88 range my average kill time is 2:20, your specs play a huge roll in you kill time.
---
Before left click use bones, the intense prayer method was still the best; it was just harder to do for a lot of players. But while I still don't think clients should be changing the options like that, I am not as opposed to reworking the left click options to be the more relevant one.
---
As I said with Construction, it is still not super easy even with left click since it is more involved than just spam clicking and you still have more input with number keys. Not to say it is super hard either, even with right click, but I wouldn't say left click build and left click remove or whatever it is missing would ruin the skill.
---
Now if you could click an empty hotspot once and have it build, select oak door, and then remove, that is a completely different story... That is the kind of thing spam click prayer is doing. Kinda defeats the point of having different skills with different grinds if we boil them all down to spam click or even less effort with no drawbacks. If an AFK method or braindead (i.e. spam click) method exists, it should be worse than methods that involve more input, even if the more input is smoothed out a bit.

was just at a fight last saturday at rev cave, if you think these small 30v30 fights are big then you def are new to clan fights.  If you think big fights are going to happen over a pvm boss you are delusional.  This is what a boss would do, it will either be soloable by lures like the other pvm bosses, or it will be paid protected like rev cave.  Seeing how revs are 7m-8m a hour with paid protection, the boss would have to have the same gp/hr or more to make it not dead content on release.  So people will pay for protection, kill said boss and have zero risk, or they wont bother unless there are ways to kill it with zero risk.  How does that help pvp?  Hop around rev caves, most worlds are filled with pures just trying to spec rush each other, and the few occasional zero risk rev killers.  In about a hours time you might run into a team vs team fight, but what usually happens is the moment one team sees the other team is larger they run and log/tele, and if an actual clan walks into it the chance of a pkri happening is zero to none.  Rot is basically dead these days, and the other clans still around are not even worth mentioning since they are basically open cc teams at this point.  Clans died from the toxicity of clans (mainly rot throwing their weight around to get their own way and if they didn't they would dox, ddos, hack etc to break you to their will) and teams are mostly filled with those who dont want to risk above 200k.  Believe me, i been there done that, pvp in todays rs was killed by its community, no matter what update comes out it wont change or help it.
---
i had a series of HCIMS when i played, I got to my 7th, and after 3 or 4 i went to '5th Hcim yet', '6th Hcim yet' and so forth
---
Some people can't pay with cash for membership. At least bonds stoped some gold sellers as well.
---
I think the community reckons it's a necessary evil because people who want to buy gold have always been able to outside official channels. If its gonna happen anyway at least jagex can make some money off it.
---
It's sad watching this game rot because colorful AGS specs are more important than solving the real pressing issue, the one that caused the abandonment of this game by its creators to begin with. The magic of this "version" was not simply nostalgia. Unfortunately the updates I have witnessed have done irreparable harm to the reason this game was so well received -- the reason people even wanted this version back. Please, consider what I'm saying. Do not waste time focusing on repairing inflation and adding new content. Please do not ruin beginning-game content with end-game rewards. It destroys the charm of the game and removes all incentive to skill. What must be done is resolving the issue of bots and gold farmers, and clever tactics must be used - ones that aren't shared with the general public. This must be approached with the utmost urgency. The sirens should be going off. You know, there were aspects of the game that many people didn't like, for example: the absence of the grand exchange. However, some people don't understand WHY this game was appealing. Of course they WANT things to be more convenient, but getting what you want does not mean you will be happy. The first and PRIMARY focus should be to resolve the issue of botters and farmers. If this, along with "quality of life" updates continue (even if players vote for it) then this game will come to an end. Players need to understand that at some point, they have to let other people play the game, and you guys need to understand that the experience of the game should not be ruined because older players want more shit. Keep the integrity of the game FIRST, and then, and only then, add new content around that.

Turn off your computer lol

hard contracts are worth doing imo, you routinely get 100k+ in seeds for very little investment and you can get a ton of money if you pre-plant the likely contract requests (e.g. whiteberries, snape grass, etc). I didn't actively do farming contracts until I had already unlocked hard ones, so I don't know if the lower-tier ones are worth your while.
---
These will loosely fit a definition of "lower level" but:
---
- sulliuscep woodcutting is very decent exp and is quite afk while also getting you a ton of fossils, which help you complete museum exhibits. These in turn get you kudos (which are useful for diaries and also get you free experience lamps) and completing the exhibits also gives you experience lamps, which many players opt to put into runecrafting.
---
- Volcanic mine is also great mining exp with a team, and is super afk. It's more than double the exp rates you'll get at Motherlode, and is substantially more afk than any of the click-intensive mining methods like iron or 3t granite, but has a learning curve.
---
- Mutated Zygomites can be killed on a slayer task, as they're not a great task but are usually pretty quick for points.
---
- Seaweed harvesting is much more useful for ironmen than for mains, but is also the best way to go for the farming pet on a main
---
- Drift net fishing is a somewhat click-intensive and obscure skilling method but you can get roughly 100k Hunter and 75k Fishing xp/hr doing it
---
- Unlocking fossil island is also required for when you do dragon slayer 2 way down the line
---

With mobile, the lifespan of OSRS expanded immensely. If the community is able to come together on including a new skill, it could really solidify the longevity of the game. The only big obstacle is MTX. Jagex will find ways to incorporate more MTX; it's how we mitigate MTX that will be key.

I mostly agree with this, but bonds are an exception I'm more than willing to allow. By allowing people who may not otherwise be able to afford a membership(Yes, I know, $11 isn't much, but to some people it might be) to actually enjoy the full game, the community is improved by having more people, and Jagex is getting just as much or more money than if they relied on pure subs alone. There are basically no downsides to bonds.

I was about to say that I’d be gone for good after OSRS, but I lied, I’d come for OSHD haha. 
---
As to the other point, OSRS was released in early 2013, and this was close to the time period that the MTX actually became pay to win. There was the SoF and Solomon’s Store, but both had previously been self-contained until around that point with no ability to buy things directly using outside cash - it was daily spins and length of membership. 
---
Not 100% on when that changed because I effectively stopped playing in 2012 before OSRS, but my understanding is that those because truly P2W either right before or right after.

I'd wake up in the morning, set up me and my friends account at nmz and go to school, play normally in the day, then set up me and my friends account again before going to sleep. Almost 100% reliable (unlike bots), and about 60-70k combat xp ph, you're looking at 800k xp a day for not even being home. Then add normal playing on top of that.
---
It was a COMPLETELY different thing than the 20minute afk timer today.
---
1:1 Ratio of managers/devs? Lmao imagine going into work and having your own dedicated manager buddy.
---
I fuckin' lol'd.
---
\&gt;Your example would be closer to a fucking psychopath...
---
When asked I always say 99, then argue that the HighScores take a while to update when people call me out for actually having 12 Fishing.
---
consider bringing a crude chair if you're after the head for slayer helm
---
They'll make it so much easier to travel around. With those and graceful you'll be laughing!
---
I think you misunderstood my point. So I am going to give you an example.
---
Let's say you want to do your grotesque guardians task and this scythe will speed it up by about 30% over not using it. Using the time you save and doing a different moneymaker using the scythe becomes efficient.
---
Dh, Karil, and Verac taunt you from their burrow!

Yes pls, me want it too &lt;3

I've been getting routed through Hong Kong on Aus servers for shit 110+ ping the last few days, hopefully they fixed it?

A good setup of monsters would be:
---
\-Arrg 17.50% bonus xp
---
\-Ice Troll King 12.50% bonus xp
---
\-Moss Giant 7.50% bonus xp
---
\-The Kendall 
---
\- Count Draynor
---
this is what I use for NMZ it gives me the best xp rates for me when dharoking because of the bonus xp and the hp lvls of the monsters. I average around 132k xp/h on my alt this way with 85 att 96 str and 96 hp
---
If you don’t have 99 mage then you still can NMZ. 
---
Go max mage set-up but in your glove slot use the chaos gauntlets from the family crest quest and cast fire bolt using a smoke staff. Only incur the cost of chaos runes.
---
Use a normal rumble with the bosses Sand Snake, Kendal, King Roald, Count Draynor, and Trapped Soul with absorption potions. These bosses hit so infrequently on a normal that all you’ll need to do is re-pot a super magic every 15 minutes and it yields average of 40-45k xp/hr. 
---
By no means the quickest or efficient magic training method but it is 100% afk.
---
I don't know of you all are trolling or not...

Thanks a lot !

I don't know if you're genuinely trying to scam him or just joking.

Typical 2019, everyone wants somebody else to be accountable for their problems. Get your account banned if its that big of an issue.

Okay, I'll retry.

Guten Morgen.

Basically, a senior to junior relation? Damn jamflex too anxious for each worker.
---
Do u need a bond, friend?
---
A lot of people take breaks at the end of the summer and sell their banks, so the supply will be bigger than the demand and cause items to go down in price you can see this trend with a lot of bossing items/ BiS gear
---
Literally spent whole bank on DHC so archers is good to go. Pegs are next
---
It’s not just me. It’s thousands of people who have the same “addicted” mentality. Not saying it’s a solution but atleast it’s something.
---
The chad Runescape outfit.
---
Hey there, if you ever want to call a hotline about your self harm thoughs please do so, you're worth it to live and although you problems may seem big there better ways go about solving it: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines
---
If you have an addictive personality you will most likely replace this addiction with another. Asking to be baby sit in this instance isn't going to help you in the long run you have to go out and address the issue, not ask for a band aid solution.
---
Wtf is dis
---
That feel when your favorite childhood skillcape is agility, and you didn’t know about how to train it (still remember the day I was a f2p noobie in varrock mining iron when I first saw it.)
---
Yes please
---
And when the demand goes high jagex will see $ signs and eventually raise them, increasing the gold they are worth, the point of this isn't about sustaining membership it's about the discussing the possible impacts of jagex wanting to keep their pockets lined if rs3 goes under, and I believe they will increase price of bonds/membership, or add MTX
---
I just started again after few years of break, I used to be in a clan but it seems like it has faded out, what are some PVM clan that accept new players? I am maxed Combat btw:)
---
Advanced
---
They won’t just ban people for using the clients. They’d be banning most of their player base if they did.
---
Character is a girl, still correct though
---
Yeah that's my hope, I'm just worried more for my rs3 account that I've never had any need for a client and ive had for the best part of 10 years, to lose that account because of a few weeks of runelite would be awful. 
---
Again, the focus isn't just about "me me me" as many will have the same situation as myself.
---
Yes I'm exaggerating time spent but the point isn't mute,  if they say increase membership to 15$ bonds are gonna increase too, which I would assume would increase the amount of gold they are worth, rs3 bonds use to be 10m, they are nearing 30 now, osrs was like 1.5? Now 4
---
Seriously, having finished my pc grind, early closers are much more disruptive than people who leave it open.
---
Fally apparently is since its not on that list. What are the odds of another murderfest happening in the same city again.
---
So it'll more likely be bans based on exploiting a bug so to speak. 
---
Whilst it's not a bug, it comes under a similar vain, knowingly using it to give you an unfair unintended advantage.
---
Kurasks poop keys like Konar's tits milk. Got four keys already and task not completed yet.
---
Once again. They won’t just ban people for using clients like runelite. They’d kill their game over night. If anything they’d send out notices and tell people using the client in the future will get them ban. They won’t suddenly ban everyone. That’s a fact.
---
Then it wouldn't be related to RuneScape dumbfuck
---
You should look at your life when you need the validation so badly that you have to waste your own time to make sure that the guy calling for honest statistics to be presented is getting unfairly attacked, and the guys making up bullshit are still being proped up. Gotta love the targeted harassment sprinkled in too.
---
you're at a droprate of like 1/10. that's ridiculous wtf
---
It’s not well known just because you hold the opinion
---
Roflcopters
---
only if they poll mtx again
---
I believe the current mod team would look at many other options besides mtx, like they recently did with the "sponsorships"
---
Nah, don’t listen to these guys. All you need is one key and you can kill the boss as many times as you like. He respawns after an hour. There’s probably an entire department at Jagex HQ dedicated to laughing at these poor schleppers grinding out inventories of keys lol.
---
Oh no blindly trusting any devs would be stupid, I agree. However RuneLite gets a different category as its foundation is open-source. My distrust for the people who manage the published version of RuneLite, though, is vastly outweighed by the unplayability of the official client.
---
This might not be what you want to hear, but money shouldn't be your primary concern right now. The fact that you only have 13k xp in the most widely applicable combat ability in the game shows that leveling your account should come first.
---
What is it you're saving up for? 400k is more than enough to buy all the BIS gear at low levels.

Was anything in 2007 expensive and useful? I remember having a bank value of around 30m and feeling like I had no reason to upgrade any of my gear and just worked on earning money for buyable skills. The only expensive item I can think of that was useful for PvE was the ZGS for freezing Sara and Guthans.
---
I'd love to see an assessment of buying power of the $ vs RS gp in 2007 and current OSRS. On the one hand 2007 had the highest demand and gold was worth a lot more, but OSRS has inflation issues but much, much more efficient gold farming methods. Would be an interesting read.
---
what's your ign?  so we can meet at the ge  in w476
---
Osbuddy has been putting in insane plugins on their client since they've been drained of s lot of their players. Pretty much tossing 3p clients under a bus so jagex will have to deal with them.
---
uh yes i posted this on the same device. Right now i am reinstalling java maybe that will fix it

Don't put in an offer you're not willing to pay for. If you're happy paying the 20-50k for an item, but not 300k for the same item, then go get the item where ever it comes from. Lletya has a shop that sells every dye.
---
Lmao true, all you guys making me realise how irrational I was thinking and worrying about next to nothing.
---
ajhajahajahjahajhajahjha w0w
---
Got me, smh
---
I'd also say that it's very unlikely this chest gets updated. It's not meant to make Konar the best slayer master, it's to make it a not garbage one. It's doing a good job of that (plus the bonus slayer points) right now so any change it doubtful.
---
And this is just pure nonsense. Osbuddy are trying to fuck shit up in the 3rd party client world, that has nothing to do with snitching. Dumbfuck.
---
it does still

why did u get an untrimmed on a white symbol ur going to need to get rid of it soon. u can't hold it forever

Based on your previous replies, I take that you are serious. I too have an addictive personality, and avoid all forms of gambling to prevent ever getting addicted. I took me a couple months to finally get it to stick, but I quit drinking and smoking bud this year with the help of AA. They have Gamblers Anonymous as well. Feel free to PM me if you need to talk about it.

Can we get this in slomo daaamn

you sadistic fuck

Haha, did you plan it out like that, or just good timing?

Beep boop I come for you

He also has battlestaves waiting to be collected from Zaff, but this time in red
---
Correct, missed typing boots :D
---
You still have Obor &amp; Bryophyta if you wanted to go for a Hill Giant Club. Ogress Shamans aswell for their Mask. Otherwise not much left in F2p.
---
“I’ll tell you one last time, collect these battlestaves or your Zulrah bank is gone” - Zaff, probably.

You and someone else have to do attacker role together. You may need to hide in the corner with the horn while they do the deed.

They're below drop rate it's way more likely to be their first pet at cerb

Half of 256 is 128, but otherwise you're right.
---
Ornate armour from Crack the Clue and a Zamorak heraldic shield from construction.
---
Ironman. Don't have them. But they are the wrong shade of black.
---
Spam clicking will literally cause you to just chip away and not do anything. Just click once and wait til youre done mining the runestone and switch to the other one.

Ironman.
---
So should I not be using a third party client right now... What's going on here
---
Out of the loop big time

Watering your crops keeps them from becoming diseased during that growth cycle.

Jmods won't reply to this question 🦀

This is probably the most well made use of this template I’ve seen, and I’ve seen plenty. 
---
You’ve matched the subtitles so well with the language they appear to be using for someone who doesn’t understand German
---
OP is obviously 1 att, 75 def...
---
Even if someone wants to read the examine texts, there is absolutely no reason to have the option for duplicates of item stack.
---
/r/AwardSpeechEdits
---
1 click banking is available in vanilla client.
---
This was more entertaining than the post.
---
Yeah I’ll have to leech off a friend doing att role as well. I can tank them and they can kill them. Lol
---
From my understanding clicks and actions are not the same thing. Bringing up the menu doesn't count as an action, I guess. So swapping menu entries only affects how many times you click, but not how many actions you are executing.
---
Well rip ur gp if this is real. Even if raids 3 was going to be released, it would be next year's summer at the earliest and I'm pretty sure that scythes will crash to under 300 ea by then.
---
what's the name of the plugin? need to turn it on asap.
---
could you make the zamorak/sara/guthix mjolnir store-able in the POH pls.
---
Geez lol. “Taking a break cause it’s not fun anymore” lmao
---
This is a lucky pet? Even if he had 3k LC he'd only have a 66%~ chance of getting the pet.
---
It says only 5/10 obtained 🤔
---
,70 herb and construction aren't cheap. I would say skill reqs are bigger investment then the 80 combat reqs for zulrah farming

Didn’t even censor the Jagex newspost anouncement, lmao. Thanks for the account, lad!

---
What’s rc? Never heard of it
---
with ambitions for maxing and seeing that big piece o' RC pie is giving me nightmares
---
Thats not runelite you fucking spade hahaha
---
could you theme(change flag) on some existing German servers to finnish/dutch servers?
---
there are quite some players coming from these countries and a themed server makes it easier for them to speak their native language. (no everyone is fluid in english)
---
it doesn't matter if the servers are stationed in germany
---
Just junk TBH. Whatever is left over. I did a huge drop yesterday  like 10m in items like rune jeweleries pots runes etc
---
It doesn't matter it has a lot of effort if it isn't funny
---
Can we remove the delay on actions following crafting runes? theres an elongated pause preventing you from emptying pouches and teleporting that disrupts the flow
---
Just hit 99 banking with that Runelite plugin they can ban it now
---
Only thing I don’t like about PVP right now is how it’s so tick based. If you don’t one tick a spec then you’re probably not getting the kill against someone who’s good. You can shark/brew/Kara through anything pretty much. Just my thoughts.
---
Depends how afk you want it... 
---
Woodcutting, fishing, smithing, motherlode mine at upper floor, any bank standing skill are all fairly afk in the sense of requiring very little attention. 
---
If you get another 6 slayer levels you could also do kurasks with either range or melee, they're probably about 300-400k gp/h with your stats, assuming you pick up all drops. 2 slayer levels after that you can do wyverns which are even more afk.
---
If we're talking literally afk, then its things like ammonite crabs and nmz, where you can afk between 10-20minutes.
---
Mods take down this begging post. It's how people get scammed
---
Edit 23 lol
---
Its a play on Barack
---
you're the one that said that basically. you wish you could play the game less on construction and runecraft because thats fun. to me the fun parts of the game are pvm, pet hunting, and pking, but to you the fun parts are watching netflix while the game plays itself on the side
---
Nice https://i.imgur.com/OfIYcG4.jpg

I’m only 250m away from buying a Tbow. Any suggestions to get me the last little bit of the way there?

Do you want this bond or not? I haven’t got all day!

Considering its extremely afk post 77, it shouldnt.
---
I want to know..
---
Join "the def cc" and ask them questions about your tank in the future :)

Engine work
---
I got like 4 levels there the other day, as a max main, it's pretty easy to tank small teams/solos with bandos tassets, k top and dinhs bulwark + about 5 brews, 1 stam and 1-2 sanfews.
---
I think I only died once because of a clan with d spears and people spamming the doors.
---
Idk how early you are talking, but I always make a point of closing the door at the portal I choose to go to, and it seems like no matter how long I wait, there is always at least one person who still hasn’t made it yet. Like why does it take some people so long to get to the portal when I’ve already kills like 3 or 4 pests by the time you get there. I can’t wait forever man.
---
Make a pure dude. Main clanning is almost completely dead and those that are still alive bend the knee to rot. 
---
Pures on the other hand have a very alive and thriving scene with over 15 active clans who f2p war on Saturday and p2p war on Sunday both at 2pm est, as well as preps/minis/pkris during midweeks.

Which one?

We knew you were on the left because its obvious that you are the girl in the relationship
---
Oh boy, guess it's my turn to say it:
---
"So this is what you do after maxing!"
---
theres some great examine infos in this game, at some point i might make a video just showing off my favorites
---
It's really not s secret either tho
---
They live in a  hotspot for programing, but can't attract work because they pay peanuts for backbreaking work
---
Why work at jagex and work on some outdated spaghetti code when you can go down the street and get paid 2x as much for half the work
---
thieving/construction
---
It’s me
---
This is a simple, and effective fix. Have the game upon download with the examine feature turned on. And I toggle for it to be turned off and on.
---
Bruh
---
## bruh 😫😫😫😫🔥🔥
---
Its more afk, slower kills
---
Can you go into detail of why?
---
When will the magic spekibutars be coming in the polls?
---
I agree, the +4%ish dps boost isn't going to help compared to the +10%\~ defense boost. More kills less banking and less eating.
---
You could buy spins for cash in SOF in mid-2012. I know because I quit over that update.
---
I just want scaled display, skybox and WASD
---
You can go naked with a bunch of food and a team could be able to carry you. Worst part is as long as you dont die you have equal chance as anyone else that never got mvp in a room, yet did a ton more. Cox has a better reward system
---
I thought this had always been the case. 
---
As a pure coincidence I got 2 shield lefts last night within 3 tasks. Back demons then fire giants. Only had 1 left half drop before. No legends started or competed
---
RWT
---
Hahahha Gee, Ash is obviously straighter than fuck.
---
Youre wearing the best tank gear as opposed to the best dps gear like bandos torture defender ferocious gloves
---
D
---
With this setup I was getting close to 70 kills an hour
---
Did your toddler make it?
---
It's the tornado skill.
---
Still difficult to determine overall. People sell their accounts all the time, a botter could buy an old account, bot on it, and use it to try and figure out information regarding the ban. Or people could get banned for botting and sell the ban information to bot farms.
---
Yeah I think it’s just salt. It’s not hard to click fast 3 times. I remember pking pre eoc and I just had a lot better of a time. It’s whatever.
---
Maybe try to make another lol
---
Ash certainly isnt a brown nose, but it's not out of the realm of possibility for him to want to butter them up a bit
---
Wouldn't you get attack/strength/defense/range/mage for free with slayer?
---
Go mow lawns for money get a prepaid visa and buy ur own mems
---
i want to convince myself to get untrimmed hunter cape because its my favorite looks wise, but idk if i have the dedication.
---
But wouldn't the time spent eating damper your dps compared to not eating as much with tank gear?
---
You’re fantastic
---
I would've been mvp if the one mvp didnt have a scythe, but that's just w416
---
They switch attack styles after their 3rd unsuccessful attack so if he's been ranging you for example, keep your distance and pray mage after the 3rd attack and if he walks up to you that means he's gonna melee next and you should be able to switch in time and vice versa for magic.
---
If he's been meleeing you it's a guessing game but it's better to protect against the style you're less tanky in
---
What is this abomination , is that a Pokémon??!
---
without left click blackjacking people will just go back to AHKing it, which isnt much different and just enforces this need of a tool to exist
---
Yeah
---
TPB memes will never die.
---
1.5m+ an hour with 95+ combat stats
---
This, a million times this. Also Mod Ash would savage this request. It takes barely any time at all for a sapling to grow into a storable state
---
But how will it distinguish real players from bots
---
I think this is a good idea, but would be better if you summarized the story in a condensed video with clips of the quest playing in the background relevant to the current section of story.  
---
This way the large majority of people can continue skipping all dialogue and use your channel to understand what they just did if they're interested.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That, or create a quest guide in real time, and during walking/travelling explain the story as it progresses. Everybody skips the lore but I am sure a lot of people would be interested in it, just not digesting it in this format tbh.
---
Just some feedback if you're looking to grow your channel to a wider audience, in the end you do whatever the FUCK you wanna do.
---
Technically, yes you can do it. But should you? That's up to you.
---
No. Eoc is still there.
---
And what's your response?
---
WEED IS HILARIOUS
---
Tell that to the Slayer masters who love giving me the same tasks on repeat.
---
Did you even read my comment? “If it takes you 10 hours to kill 50 zulrah that’s your problem” or did you reply to the wrong person? OP is moaning about the upkeep of a bond and I’m telling him it’s easy. To get 50 zulrah kills in two weeks is absolute piss.
---
Haha ya I tried I guess
---
For those of you who are confused: 
---
RuneLite: Menu Entry Swapper -&gt; Bank [X]
---
You can also change whether or not left clicking a charged amulet/ring will default to the teleport menu of that item:
---
Menu Entry Swapper -&gt; Teleport item [X]
---
Both of these result in actions usually taking 2 clicks to be done with 1, therefore RuneLite is macroing just like AHK and should be B&amp;!!!!
---
Weird, I think oP should fuck off then.
---
Easyscape
---
I'm trying to make a "buying gf 50gp" sign above my head lol just need to locate some wire for it

---
Darkscape?
---
Yessss that would be perfect lol!
---
Thats crazy it matches the crack on my screen to a T!
---
I know it says complete but your other option (and can be used later) is to come with a full supply of food and run through the trolls and suicide by the boss at a safespot and pick up that food if needed.
---
Its well known. Theyre headquarters are in a high income(high cost to live) area in the UK, they are a large company with hundreds of workers, high profits, low pay, no transfedable skills learned. And theyve flopped every project but RS3 and OSRS....
---
I made it out of cardboard and tape lol, and too young for a toddler
---
That's a lot of what ifs to excuse treating customers like numbers instead of people. Maybe the people I sold my account to botted with a VPN on the same network I've been playing on for years? Maybe if they are this paranoid it's because their bot detection system is utter garbage and probably very error prone.

At least you know how to screenshot

What's the message here?
---
Oh ya OSB BAD
---
People who says "yikes" and "I done a thing" are wrong
---
I hate how much borderline cheats are in third party clients, I think QOL changes like smoother animations, skybox and text for loot on ground and it’s gp price are all I want.
---
I wonder why lense flares are always/usually shaped like hexagons. Anyone know?
---
Why would you not just do 420 keys bro
---
The 2 letters that will make everyone shudder:
---
E P
---
I've done it on these stats but lower ranged. It may take quite a few attempts and some learning curves but you can definitely do it.
---
I tried cooking when classic first came out, but I would get two inventories and afk log lmao. Long live classic.
---
Thanks - I'll need to practice stepping out of melee more.
---
What I wouldn't give to have OSRS break off and become an indie game with the current devs in charge.
---
If Jagex bans all third party clients without creating a decent client of their own, that would be a bigger fuck up lol
---
But you've already filled the collection in that kc
---
I'm 98 slayer and I'm 99 mage/range already and nowhere close to 99 melees (94 att, 93 def, 98 str). You don't get nearly enough slayer xp getting 99 to get maxed combat stats.
---
I would. I used to play exclusively on osbuddy. I quit for about a year and came back cleaned and transformed into a green dragon bot that got banned. Email was exclusively used for runescape. Had bank pin. After some other incidents from my friends who also used osbuddy we think they only target accounts that haven't logged in for a long time
---
I mean were they dragon dbolts or regular cause  reg are cheap enough that id use them too
---
But I can 1 click bank by using any bank chest, or by clicking the desk at the GE on the vanilla client, time to ban the vanilla client too???
---
True although I’m very happy with that, I would really like some shards now 😅 been dry for about 1100 kills.
---
How about making us able to capture giant chinchompa and then allowing us to attach it to a gnome glider so we can call in airstrikes

Except for the PvM content
---
Well when you guys do the Q&amp;A could you discuss my Wilderness idea of adding a mage-only dungeon beneath the Mage Arena?  Single combat only.  
---

---
Nothing really after they did some work with standard spell book. It’s just PvMers being mad that pkers (player killers) are the ones who kill everyone in the Wilderness, since, well, that’s what they do.
---
So, PvMers want Pkers to *only* kill other pkers basically
---
This is more of an issue with the template we use. In the case of the Fire giant, we have a template that renders both together and the note is poorly worded at the moment. We've been discussing and requesting more clarification on the matter to get the information more correct.
---
serp's price is held in place by zulrah scales, and zulrah is so heavily botted that serps are flooded into the game. Serp would probably be under 1m if you couldn't disassemble it, most people already don't bother using serp for +2 str bonus.
---
You are right
---
It takes 2 hours tho
---
Each kill is almost 36k. You get around 50 kills an hour with justiciar + dfs with max stats. 36k*50=1,8m.
---
And that’s why you should make an Ironman. No need to worry about the state of the economy. Unless you want to flex your ‘bank value’
---
Someone never took econ 101 or you would know the difference between stakeholders and shareholders lol
---
Stakeholders is a standard business term which means everyone who has an interest in the success of the company. It includes customers.
---
Number of hours it takes to get 99 assuming you use the best xp rates
---
How would you recommend I position my screen for maximum afk?
---
Thank you for delaying the q&amp;a until you have a statement to put out
---
While you move around the game you air strike, curse etc random npc
---
OSB must really be in financial trouble if the best asteoturfing they can afford is this bad.
---
Fix pvp
---
I think reading into this it's fair to say there's a lot of indecision at Jagex about what to do with third-party clients which I find very worrying.
---
I think the root cause of the frustration myself and some other players feel is that the third-party clients feel fundamentally unfair to everyone who isn't inclined to use them. Allowing them to continually push the boundaries is very worrying from a game integrity point of view, and you feel like a sucker when you're doing things the 'honest' way when somebody can be out pseudo-botting and getting equal or better rates than you with a fraction of the effort.
---
The problem is, we don't know your stance on these clients. Are they the new norm, or are we putting our account security at risk by using them? The longer you delay, the worse the plug-ins get and the bigger advantage is reaped by those are willing to use these shady clients. We don't need a perfect, focus-group tested statement, all we need is an answer on whether these clients are okay or not. Allowing the status quo to continue is frustrating and demotivating. Please make a statement soon.
---
Not in F2P lmao
---
Whats the significance of winter 2017?
---
My friend did turn his 300m bank in rs3 into 60m osrs :x
---
He is half kidding right now it only chips 5 or so at a time in one click.
---
That was such a hilarious joke
---
"I think our PR team wanted us to announce something but i dont want to do it"
---
"oh we get a new skill"
---
Rofl.
---
Guess we'll find out then...
---
Point taken and I understand why you feel that way. But I think if Jagex didn't want scouting to be a thing, they would address it. Perhaps with a raid-bail timer.
---
*Konar giving me the 5th Black Demon task in the Catacombs in the last 10 tasks*
---
T-thanks.
---
One of the best posts so far on this sub. You made some very good points
---
Not everybody thinks like this.  I'm an iron btw and I vote yes to all reasonable pvp updates.  I'm going to die either way, might as well be in epic fashion ;\]
---
Simple and already botted quests to access the area, yes.
---
I was anticipating this as well.  My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
---
So you only do those 5 bosses each dream? I was having trouble figuring out which bosses to take out and felt like i was taking too many out, but alot of them use magic or something that hit my 1 hp thru melee pray as soon as it started
---
Thank you for the update and thank you for taking your time handling this tricky situation.
---
It'll go from ~10-25m+ for the first few sold on release day, down to probably 3-5m within 3 days of release down to a few hundred K when everyone has access to it after a month or so
---
weak bait
---
Thank you for understanding. 
---
Guess they made my mind up for me.
---
Why have you made a throwaway for this?
---
Efficient hours played
---
He notice everyone
---
Used to, but stopped when the detriment to aesthetic started getting to me
---
Ban third party clients, bam easy fix.
---
All these creeps clinging to them are obviously too addicted to quit and just because they can’t see a persons hp or the millisecond they need to repot doesn’t mean they’ll just stop playing.
---
If you do blanket ban 3rd party clients I won't be playing until the official client at least have gpu rendering, literally cannot play at 18fps, really dgaf about any other plugin, the lack of fps literally makes it unplayable for me at this point.
---
This is the best take I've seen on the issue so far. Play the game however you want. If you wanna make shit annoying as fuck to grind, go ahead use the normal client.
---
Lets face it, bad game design is everywhere in mundane (buyable) skills. If anything, this is a good cash sink for materials in the game for skills that are not generally very attractive to grind for normal people playing the game.
---
[deleted]
---
Panic change passwords when banned 3rd party clients looking for final cashout
---
haha yeah bro 
---
t. jagex insider
---
Efficient hours played. If something takes 200 EHP that basically means it's 200 hours doing the most efficient method.
---
1 out of 12k on the normal wyverns. Nice luck, I'm nearly 3k into the grind in my account.
---
PVMers wanting PKers to kill other PKers is what makes PVP unexciting for PKers?
---
There's a rock I examined and it's examine text was something along the lines of "It's a rock, what do you want me to say?"
---
What are you on about? You're not saying anything related to this thread.
---
What I don't understand is waiting until 30 minutes before it's supposed to go live.
---
it would be idiotic wouldnt it. and yet how many hunter bots have over 99 hunter? lmao
---
Pvm that was marketed as high risk high reward. The players that do pvm in wildy do not want a thriving pvp community and are willing to kill it off. It’s like pkers asking if we can pk our team mates in theatre of blood. Doesn’t work that way
---
but ill get banned for it, right?
---
 "Thank you for understanding"
---
Thank you for telling me how i feel.
---
Currently it’s just running from pkers lol
---
Same shit they're pulling for mtx on rs3, sad times
---
Not a battle, just a clarification. Communism doesn't support UBI, it's an entirely different idea.
---
&gt; Tbh I enjoy the boss
---
I think this is the first time I've ever heard someone say that!
---
I can't confirm if black demons have access to the GDT table right now, but I know they do have access to the RDT (which does not require the quest to be started or completed). Take a look at my main statement on this thread if you want some more information on it and how we're working on wording things differently.
---
It’s just a click bro, you can still see an opponents hp on ur runelite bro.
---
The fucking hypocrisy, crying about a plug-in that hardly effects another player yet you got all your pk plugins and shit rampant on runelite and say “yep, looks good to me.”
---
Lmfao fuck 3pc
---
Yeah it kind of depends how hard the knights are to kill. If they are something tedious and time consuming like Grosteque Guardians or Abyssal sire it will be worth more. Based on how jagex described them so far, they sound like a typical uncannonable mob like wyrms. It could be worth a shit ton if basilisk knights are tedious or hard to kill.
---
It is well known that jagex is a shit company for customer service. Now that is a fact. The company, mods on Facebook and twitter don't count.
---
Literally happens all the time. People post this several times a day
---
that's not how rng works... oh 10 people got it under 10 kc so everyone get's it under 10 right?
---
Yeah his hair is great.
---
I know this is petty but I have no desire to help the RS3 community. OSRS community had to fight tooth and nail to get a pre-eoc version of the game and the RS3 community fought us the whole way. Numerous threads on RS forums and social media telling us to get over it or quit. So live with the MTX or quit.
---
Damn that actually looks legit too. Like how are they allowed to put the website right there? It must be an automated system that accepts these ads.
---
Nah join a med clan
---
Nah, it's in fact quite the opposite. RS3 said they were going to adress it, gave some none-answers and proceeded to announce an announcement (of a new skill) for "PR"
---
I think they're announcing that at Runefest. I don't play RS3, I just saw that Q&amp;A and the blowback.
---
Banning them and working on there own, would slow bots down and stop op plugins
---
I fought for you guys to get your game too. I've been playing since 2003
---
Just to clarify I'm not saying anything should be done about it necessarily. I just find it super super odd. If they are bots, at least you could say they are not the type that does damage to the game. But I have to wonder what the motivation is for running so many accts warning about one of the most archaic scams in the game.
---
Interesting.. thanks for the info!
---
It sucks, but Agility, get your Graceful set, it makes so much of the game so much easier. Then Quests and then Slayer probs.
---
Jagex haven’t said but people are guessing Archaeology.
---
Neat!
---
You're right, my comment does come off like I'm belittling people for being excited about the Q&amp;A
---
do you happen to know what the basilisk task weight will be for duradel/neive?
---
Life's a garden, dig it
---
In the same boat my man
---
It wouldnt even take any effort on whoever is doing its part, if they have a decent computer just throw the script online then go to work or whatever it is they do. Throw 3 or 4 people like this in a cc together and they can probably cover every world
---
I've been using OSB since before RL was a thing. Haven't bothered to change, didn't really plan on it either.
---
I just want some of the features listed below, like tile markers, item overlays, item markers and what not. 
---
Hope I don't miss the NO MORE OSB announcement and get banned lol.
---
The crazy thing it wasn’t even shared by anyone it was just forced onto my timeline.
---
The original dagonhai was just a mystic variant, I'm assuming if you want it to have mystic reqs again you would also not want it to have t70 stats...
---
Did I say everyone? Why are you being so radical bro lol
---
 I got my pet at 198 KC, and I felt like it took me forever
---
I actually really enjoy doing this boss, I would recommend giving it a try for a few trips and seeing if you feel like doing more. It won’t be fast xp, but if you do a whole task at GG you’ll get like 200k+ slayer xp. I think a lot of people don’t like it because there’s a bit of “unavoidable” damage, and some of the mechanics demand a bit more attention. People can definitely have their preferences and I respect that but I also think that people exaggerate how “bad” this boss is. You’ll also stack up on HELLA granite dust which will make cannon tasks better so that’s a plus
---
All I can say is:
---
1. Be a high level: my CB is 115
---
1. Have the Grand seed pod for a one click escape
---
1. Focus on the game so you can react or teleport immediately, and don't take unnecessary risks
---
1. Stay on the southern end of the cave so you are always on level 30 wildy. 
---
I die plenty of times. I just lost my salve (ei) again today after this winning streak.
---
Original dagonhai was the same as mystic. I'm guessing if OP wanted mystic reqs then he would want mystic stats.
---
Personally I'd like them to come out and say "We're going to invest heavily in improving the official client. We're putting this on a six month timeline. After that 6 months, 3rd party clients will no longer be allowed, but we believe the official client will be in a state that normal players will no longer feel the need to use them." 
---
Something along those lines, where they acknowledge that the official client is severely lacking, and that they can't just ban 3rd party clients without improving it. After they improve it I'm 100% fine with them stopping 3rd party clients.
---
I feel you, i dont mind if they nerf the OP plugins but ones that give no huge advantage should be allowed

Currently thinking of trying to knock out 99 agility.  What is probably to best way to level this?  I'm currently 86.
---
I agree. I'd want them to improve the vanilla one first, and then ban 3rd party though.
---
I took the day off from work for this Q&amp;A, thanks...
---
Jagex support unbanned my very first account. I have to give you my downvote im forever in their grace. I also cannot wait for this new key hunter skill 10/10 voting yes on all new updates cause jagex support cares.
---
I used to have that phone like 5 years ago nice

I haven't even opened mine yet haha, it's just hanging around in that carboard tube

Im on the same boat. Still learning the rotations and stuff but it does help that i have ancestral and im saving up for that arma. i can do about 3 to 4 max. i think its just getting to know the rotations to the point its just reflex

A skill's quality has nothing to do with how popular it is.
---
&gt;RC gets no faster after 23
---
Completely wrong
---
&gt; has basically 0 variety each training method
---
Combo rune RC, traditional RCing, ZMI, and Arceuus all play rather differently than each other. It's hypocritical of you to consider cannoning vs. protect melee AFK to be diverse when there's far less of a difference between those two than something like Lavas vs. Abyss RC.
---
&gt;You can't choose a slower, more relaxed method until 77
---
ZMI, but that does explain how popular skills are. The most popular skills are the skills people can AFK the most.
---
If Jagex gives OSB the go ahead then Runelite aught to implement the same things.
---
depending on the price of steam runes you make decent money and they are only .5 exp less than lavas

What was their options, really? As much as we all want a statement, I'd hope for a clear, thoughtful and complete one.
---
As a PvM player its really exciting when i do some high risk content in the wilderness. A lot of times that risk is what contributes to the PvM content being valuable.
---
It's a low ass kill count buddy... Average person gets it on 3000kc.  Some people posting at 1 KC are insaaaaaaanely lucky. OP is not unlucky if that was his first pet (sounds like it's at least his second so hes super lucky)
---
Just win lol
---
gz. ever feeling lonely feel free to hop in my cc - Willyb0ngka always some ppl on. gl on the grind!

Each melee stat gets a +3 boost depending on your combat style and controlled give +1 to everything.
---
Clan wars is dead. I think some people still do castle wars. Pest control and barbarian assault remain active due to their rewards.
---
Chest opening
---
I have no idea, no place says you can get it from either hellhounds or dagannoths. Not to mention he spelled dagannoths wrong too lol
---
Partner slayer IIRC. Or some shit like that. Basically theres a way you deal damage (recoil maybe) and then finish the kill on another account and you get very low exp for it. Its an extremely, excruciatingly slow way to do it.
---
Of course it will fail. 0 requirement minigame that's being botted should not get an attachment for a much needed buff to a ultra rare raids drop
---
Don't see too many GrIm Adventures references these days, huh?
---
Just so that you know, "alter" means to change something, whereas the place at which you offer the bones is an  "altar."
---
/FuckYouKaren

No. They are not worth killing, reddit just absolutely nuts to this boss for some absurd reason.
---
I like that you censored your cat's eyes

The same way your still taking pictures of your monitor with your phone instead of screenshot
---
Post this at the rs3 subreddit to show them how to be humans , they r ignoring us and banning us , am perm banned from there due to anti mtx posts !
---
Thanks for the heads up, damn autocorrect
---
Im annoyed at the idea of tradable attachments which are lost on death
---
It just doesnt make much sense to me
---
16th ever, 19 in the log. Somethings fishy here.
---
Imbued only drops from superiors, and hellhounds dont have one haha. And im not sure where he got his drop rate for that from either. 
---
I think whoever wrote it is confused lol.
---
Can someone explain this for a person completely out of the loop?
---

---
What slayer master should I use? Also is zulrah out of the question for me right now with my stats?
---
Pretty sure the boss is less gp/hr than regular gargs. But, it has the best looking pet imo
---
old news lmao but fb don't give a fuck and neither does jamflex
---
If you want a quick start to the game, check out this video:
---
https://youtu.be/mChNddTS3gU
---
He does start with some money but you can skip those steps like cannoning your ranged level
---
Pest Control might be worth looking at. It's generally recommended to wait until 100 combat so you can use the veteran boat. But since you're just looking for something to do a bit of at a time, void might be a good thing to slowly work towards whenever you're bored of your main goals.
---
How is it botting tho when the person is still constantly clicking and looking at the screen, its pretty retarded how instead of focusing on actually bots flooding the game , people are more interested in some op seeming features to clients.
---
Those aren't chads, they're db pures n I don't mean dark bow lol.
---
I misunderstood the initial suggestion. Thanks for clarification.
---
red chin 99hunter

I did too, but i skipped every few squares

I’ve gotten pet 3x in 3k kills you can do it man. Happens when you least expect it

Ah alright, thanks.
---
what i think they will do is say "well osb/rl is based off our game, we have the rights to take their clients and make it our own"
---
&gt;\^For real. I would love to check my email while skilling more efficiently.
---
This show shaped a generation, tis a shame we forgot our roots
---
This really is "best case" I hope jafleflix doesnt mess this up

Do some Barrows my man, it's tons of fun, doesn't take a lot of skills or money, and can be a good medium level source of income. (This)[https://youtu.be/y4qfSyn2Gbk] video is a fantastic beginners guide and has a very cheap minimum stat gear setup. After doing some Barrows runs and getting a good drop I set goals for what I want to accomplish, like right now my goal is to get a Dragon Defender.
---
Dude that is my exact issue!!
---
I respect them saying that they aren’t prepared yet, rather than pretending to be prepared and giving some canned cheese answer in the mean time.
---
Zulrah isn't out of the question depending on your gear, but you'll want to train up magic a little or else kills will be slow.
---
Early 60s, although I've been raiding a lot recently which has probably given me an extra mil or 2 range xp and a few hundred k xp in the other ones.
---
There's no technical way to prevent third party clients lol. This was never a power jagex held. Any DRM implementations will simply be broken
---
You're right, but ranged is better than a godsword as all ranged gear adds to your accuracy bonus.
---
Or else
---
thanks man. just had same issue
---
Bro you need to lay low the folks at the psych ward are gonna find you if you keep it up
---
I was hoping for a 2 handed chinchompa you throw like a basketball.
---
Include 1 click blackjacking, Firemaking and Altar as QoL, problem solved
---
When I got the notification I expected 6ix9ine.
---
I would assume the client they're using is Runelite. It allows you to mark tiles and highlight NPCs, among other various visual overlays.
---
Do farmruns and birdhouse runs while working for varrock diaries. It's all passive income to maintain a bond if need be
---
Cool stuff, that’s the largest chest opening I’ve seen for sure. If we get enough of these videos we can compile rarities of each item. It’s too bad the chests are so much less profitable than divine pots or we’d have more people doing them.
---
Oh ok cool can I get links to both so I can read about them
---
Over the rainbow will forever be a  BANGER
---
Congrats man! Dag supreme is the coolest of all the DKS followers, I think.
---
Who knew calc was useful for runecrafting eh?
---
Yeah, CML has post-99 RC xp as being 100k/hr, which isn't possible without runners as far as I'm aware.  But, the pre-99 xp rates seem to be correct
---
Guaranteed to trigger players with a title like that. Congrats tho man! I'm about 16m XP without it currently.
---
Congrats!
---
If you look at my comments I down vote All rs3 content because that’s trash. This is true art in my eyes .

Recently moved over myself, do yourself a favour and do mahogany, I did a mix of both mahogany and oak dungeon doors on route to 83 and wish I had just done all mahogany

With that cash stack, buy max melee (bandos and what not) and then get combat stats up.  While afking/working on that, get construction up to at least 82 (to boost to your ornate pool) and then work on getting Raid stats up (mainly herblore).  
---
Range you can cannon fast for 99 range (expensive but fast)
---
Magic you can barrage monkeys after monkey madness 2 (expensive but fast)
---
Everything else you can do in your spare time.  Bossing/raiding are the most fun content (IMO) that OSRS offers at the moment.  If you want to pk, make a new account and do a pure.  
---
Whatever you do, don't stake.  It's too much of an addiction.
---
This could work if it was implimented at the start of the game but its too late now.
---
The reason why it's so cheap has less to do with supply and demand and is more about being outclassed by c hally and d claws
---
Wait just noticed you’re also a real sweet kid :)
---
&gt;The player count is dropping rapidly! sad
---
That line sounds like you're trying to mimic Trump so hard lol. The classic "extreme lie/over-exaggeration", then the little insult at the end.
---
Auto correct wouldn't change a legitimate word into a different word, don't blame autocorrect it did nothing wrong.
---
they have done it before and some people suspects that they have been doing it all along. Just picking random people with no voice in the community and because jagex also has no support so they wont be heard
---
I meant effective in the same sense as you did efficient, I was just tired when I wrote this. It still seems odd you would have 0 hours for either, considering they can both be trained efficiently either through combat or some other form of skilling for Magic.
---
Whatever you do, don't gain another slayer level. Ever.

Oh god i can already hear my computer fans spin faster. I can see the lag when I try to teleport to Varrock

75 to build spirit tree in PoH but can use stew from 70

Goddamn lochness monster
---
Nah, people optimized 11 a lot over the years, I don't play the game atm so I had to look for stats online but I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/5ykbve/199_xphr_testing_results/) where someone explains how to reach max in a class in &lt;20 hrs.
---
Exactly if something is only useful in PvP like ballista and ags the price completey tanks but you look at dragon limbs which are farmed excessively, they hold their value because the crossbow has versatile use
---
I don't understand this.
---
You should have posted [this one too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdPM6j1Q4sg), this is the one that my little cousin kept singing that one time at Christmas dinner, and that's how it's stuck for me 😂
---
No, this guy is dumb lol. Bers/tort/ferocious are all the best move here
---
so we can sail away to osrs
---
Saw doesn't work for building rooms. Can still boost from 70 with stew though
---
Or just revert the death mechanics... jeez you guys need to grow some balls
---
The majority of damage from rune drags is coming from the 10's every time they do lightning, this is a clearly worse setup in justiciar than zerk ring/tort/ferocious lol
---
I'm at Kraken right now using fire wave + tome of fire, and when I get a mist rune drop, fire wave starts using the mist runes in my inventory instead of the dust runes in my rune pouch even though I have like 7k dust runes. Is there a way for me to stop this from happening, or do I just have to juggle the mist runes for the entire trip?
---
Same, seems sketch
---
So, why don’t tasks that level multiple skills considered efficient hours for each of those multiple skills? Perhaps divided by the skills that were trained simultaneously.
---
Attack Strength Defense Constitution and Slayer, for example, might earn 0.2 efficient hours played per hour of efficient play?
---
I legit dont even notice it being there because I have my ground item minimum value at 1k
---
Congratulations on getting Moltres
---
Yeah you're probably right 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah my bootyhole is puckered in anticipation of the announcement. I'm not playing if I can't use RL because I don't believe for a second that jagex is gonna develop all of the needed qol plugins in any relatively short amount of time. I would absolutely love if jagex just bought RL (open src I know, but you know what I mean) and officially supported it. But that would cost jagex more than $0 so it won't happen
---
I doubt those BH bots get anywhere close to 1k kills, whereas I have over 8k kills on my main, 4k kills on my pure, and around 1k kills on my new 20 def account.
---
77prayer n rigour
---
The ones who want to be babied are the ones who want to PK PvMers who can't fight back because PvM equipment and accounts are useless against PK equipment and accounts. Your point would be fair if there wasn't a dichotomy between equipment uses.
---
You could give him another 8000 range def and the lightning attack would still hit him for 10 while afk every time anyway. Also zerk ring/tort/ferocious are not 4% dps lol significantly more
---
if you're in an instance you can just leave them on the ground
---
They have absolutely no obligation to do Q&amp;A's on a certain day, that's just what they've been sticking to. There's absolutely nothing wrong with them changing the date. They're still doing their jobs, you prick.
---
its interchangeable between the actual name of the boss and the god, its just what people have always done
---
Found it. Man Im gonna camp 90-99 con asap

Cor blimey mate
---
Who did you swap with?

He pepega

You don't need a tab specifically for that stuff, its just combat gear and your normal runes you use for other stuff.

All of the GWD bosses have annoying to spell names so it's just easier to refer to them by their bosses/drops. People still do abbreviate their names though, you'll see folks refer to Kril, Zily, and Kree KCs fairly often
---
Whoosh
---
You called?
---
You're so adorable. At least your 1/50k rate was deserved. I'll come chat with you in the fish guild in a couple months when I bust out fishing. See ya there buddy!
---
I'll add you for sure, thanks.its Nice to make ingame friends. I'll send u a dm.
---
HC really aren't worried about profit though.
---
ban all third party client and hire runelite/osbuddy people to make urs better, done deal
---
Looks better! Now the loot from a kill of a player with ancient warrior weapons corresponds to the value of the weapon.
---
If they do it in this order, things will go exactly how they went last time when Jagex tried to ban Runelite
---
They’re gonna cuck out and say “maybe you get banned for using them, but you’re allowed to use them” 
---
The only logical thing to do is ban all third parties.
---
One reason why everyone says support is bad is because they are forced to waste 99% of their time on nonsense issues like these.
---
I used osb for so long before rl, then I was like why tf am I paying for something when I can get a better product for free. I'd at least give rl a shot
---
Don't your mean not £9.49
---
Gpu renderer, UI scaling, ground items, and anything else that just makes available info easier to read is not "cheating." What is cheating, is a macro that performs 4 actions in one click.
---
u have a keyboard. position ur camera and u dont need to move ur mouse. do u really need me to teach u how to train construction? plenty of videos online. dont need me to lmgtfy.
---
We already know staff are paid poorly, so bad practice in general isn't surprising.
---
If we all storm area 51 at the same time they can't kill us all.

---
I think elite void is actually better than arma at zulrah. At least thats what i was told by a guy with 34000 zulrah kills.
---
Runelite is open source. So there are many 'devs.' It's not that simple.
---
Those weapons shouldn't exist in the game period.
---
Coke &gt; Pepsi
---
doing that is the only joy i got from getting void elite
---
Some?
---
The support twitter rather ambiguously said they would punish players abusing game mechanics in response to someone asking if the prayer/fm plugins were approved. I wouldn't use them
---
That blog is a massive mess lol
---
Is that alternate design not getting polled or are the poll questions outdated?
---
The "ideal" way to play wow is to not use your mouse at all. Only to click on dialogue options or quest NPCs/ Shops. For everything else you use binds or tab targeting. You just use it to turn your camera pretty much and when holding down right click to move your camera it's locked to the wow window by default.
---
Just announce a new skill and all the drama will go away /s
---
Ideally they could just ban people using features that automate things, which was the plan from the beginning when it came to using AHK. 
---
Prior to AHK being banned, all scripts were allowed as long as the inputs were 1:1 (and this was only a loose rule) but cycling scripts that essentially automated activities would lead to bans. 
---
It's probably difficult to determine what falls under automation since Jagex (so far) seems okay with menu-entry swapping, but ideally that would be the solution to both allow 3rd party clients and ban OP/abusive plugins.
---
Sang staff heals hp. So that can make trips longer. It’s possible to do 9 kill trips sometimes with it.
---
There are plenty of learner groups that would take you, pm me for a discord invite to my TOB server, for Tobbers of all levels. We have dedicated teachers for learner raids as well.
---
Dude...this movie was like my childhood i watched it so many times. “I thought you had a hemi” - “I had to get a foot print gas peddle installed”
---
Bowel movementless bucket huh? 😂
---
I'm 99 wearing full graceful and I still run out on the way from the blood alter back to the essence mine. That's fully paying attention though, if you're afking maintaining a rate of around 34k/hr then you won't run out of run.
---
I retired a 99-99-45-99-85-99 2k total zerk for a piety. Best decision I ever made.
---
You have plenty of exp left to fully quest out a med level. I'm 60-99-75-99-77 right now. Pvp is better than a zerk, bossing is more efficient on supplies, ability to get a quest cape and access more content, etc etc. All while dealing the same dps as my 99att zerk even with 60atk.
---
Bones increasing 200gp affects the economy?

Very excited to vote yes

Consumables for slayer.

86-90. It’s all useful, teleport portals, rejuvenation pool, jewelry box full of all the teleports that comes with jewelry. Infinite glory teleports. Store your pets, store your cosmetic items. Repair barrows gear with workshop. Fairy ring, with 85 farming u can have a spirit tree. It’s the most important thing for a main and pretty much anyone who is planning on playing for a long time. I did my house before questing and it made questing so much easier
---
surely it can't be a money maker if you're buying them from the ge though
---
Put it in the menagerie then you could've gotten another
---
Doesn’t the new swift blade from LMS do the same thing?
---
The latest controversy is about contextual left clicks that essentially break the 1:1 input:output rule, the main one of those being 1 click blackjacking - people can just spam click on a blackjack target without even really looking at the screen.
---
Show your fishing xp then... isn’t hard.
---
Okay, thanks a bunch!
---
Try the “DeliverItems” cc. They’ll bring stuff to you for free (you can tip or course).
---
There's still time for late 2019
---
Hey I did this and just got 2 kills this trip wtf thank you
---
You can get the exact same settings and just the different design is enough to be inconvenient. If you already have 2$ that you’re factoring in your budget then what’s wrong with just continuing the payment, it’s not a big cost either way. I personally use RL+ but like there’s no reason to hate someone for using a competing product.
---
No problem
---
Unless you are in some specific fringe scenarios, there really isn't any determination to be made. Strength is kinda just always the best answer.
---
Also, just did some digging. AHK are indeed not allowed. Only OS Mousekey functions are now. Which is entirely different, but able to obtain similar results. Not sure if you were aware.  
---

Heres the source.

---
$2/month isn’t nothing to everyone. A couple hours of reconfiguring and getting used to RL is worth it for most people.
---
You right but jagex gonna “who cares”
---
Disagreeing with an opinion means that you have a different opinion that's just as valid as his. Neither are wrong. I don't think you understand what an opinion is as well as you don't have an understanding of when someone is upset and when someone is explaining a concept to someone.
---
They also promises gpu rendering on desktop(its on mobile already) after mobile was released
---
Yet we hsve yet to hear anything and the lead engine dev is leaving
---
To train agility?
---
theres an option that allows every click to be a ‘use’ i think, im not really sure because i rarely use mobile cause im more of a pvm guy than a skiller.
---
They had that idle version of the game for all of a week which was pretty neat.
---
MTX developer used Treasure Hunter it's super effective.
---
Yeah obviously lance will be better than blowpipe
---
You're basically brainless
---
It's 3 dollars. That's basically a free month of membership every 3-4 months.
---
They basically have sailing with Ports. Hire sailors with different skillsets, send them on expeditions of varying danger, etc.
---
Larrans robes being 1/256 from chest means they're gonna be dead for pvp for at least a year. No mains are gonna use that if its pricier than ahrims.
---
Yeah I've been at crabs since I posted and got responses in like a minute. I bought what I could so I could get the best xp :)
---
Gl
---
I would recommend getting full bandos , serp helm , with the lance an don’t use torture u still wanna use the salve. That in my opinion is better then elite void an bp
---
Alright AHK was out right banned because people were doing things with it that were actually botting, such as automation loops. MES does nothing anywhere near that level. Construction still requires focus to get EHP rate since the butler needs to be interacted with and you need to act quickly depending on the method of construction you are performing. Blackjacking rates are the same as ardy knights for a very large portion of the grind to 99. Does it make it easier? Yeah. Is it botting? No, not anywhere close. 
---
Its really silly to compare menu entry swapping to botting because you perform one less action. MES is nothing like the prayer or FM plugin you've probably seen which is actually macroing.
---
It isn’t worth it..
---
Proud of this one.
---
Tanzoo and Virtoso Challenges
---
Lmao dumbass
---
You know you can right click the entrance and select the peek option to see if anyone is down there beforehand right?
---
lmao goblin boy, better switch to the pvp worlds and become one of the vultures at lumbridge to get some of that back
---
Idk why u are all upset
---
I'd muuuuich rather this than them ignore it all stream and try not to mention anything to set the chat off
---
Again — two opinions cannot both be true. 
---
I know accepting you’re wrong sometimes is hard, but the journey of a thousand miles....
---
If runelite was the official client people couldn't make plugins for it
---
The problem is it's open source and everybody and their mom can edit in new plug ins easily
---
Yeah what is going on ?
---
Get your torso now. 
---
I think the people recommending tassels where saying torso and bcp are basically the same thing +fed bonus from bcp
---
the noose or the 3rd party client tools?
---
Yep this was the post where Jagex made their stance on AHK known after it became widely used among the community. This is what I was referring to when I said Jagex banned AHK.
---

---
I'm asking for your guidance, won't you come down from your throne?
---
    0 CS
---
Amazing thanks!
---
You can pretty much use whatever gives you the most defense while still retaining some mage bonus. You can do like full splitbark with a malediction ward, some form of robes with a justiciar helm etc, basically as long as you're hitting something, you'll be getting better rates than splashing
---
Nani?!
---
You're conveniently leaving out the parts where it will hand you the solution for clue puzzles on a silver platter, change the left-click option for individual items and add shift+left click options for items that doesn't have those options in the vanilla client. 
---
(Such as shift+left click to empty rune pouches, and change shift+left click to use item on things you use for tick manipulation, enabling you to 3-tick fish without pressing and releasing shift, just hold it down with sticky keys.)
---
The problem is people are creating 3rd party plugins for stuff like runelite+
---
They really have no way to tell what client your on other than "is it ours or not?"
---
They could introduce an API system and then be able to tell what client your on, but imagine them putting dev time into this instead or just improving their client.
---
Heroes Pet
---
he doesn't even have one on
---
Took me a sec. Thought dude just had a wonky arm and is the least conspicuous pickpocketer of all time.
---
Menu swapping, something OSB has been doing for years and Runelite has been doing since inception, is 4 outputs to 1 input. Why are you ok with every other instance of that, but suddenly appalled when it is applied to blackjacking?
---
When 3rd party clients were saving jagex time and money by doing what they didn't want to do, it's no surprise they let it go on within reason. 
---
As for the vanilla client, it's true that the client does have to be upgraded a lot. Features like the GPU plugin should be standard by this point, while other features such as changing left click options, tile markers, and other in-game/UI changes that people have used a lot on these clients could be implemented as they/the community see fit.
---
Several hours of very low effort almost afking...
---
"Drastic amounts" pretty sure I paid like 20m when trouver parchment were like 2m each for my void tribrid and infernal - which isnt a lot of money for gear that is comparable to bis for melee and bis for ranged damage potential at a fraction of the cost of bandos or armadyl. Not to mention that with my elite void, I can still hit 38 barrages in max while maintaining a decent amount of accuracy, considering the price vs ancestral's 125m. So yeah void is cheap for how good it is. No denying that point by thinking 20m is a lot of money.
---
Purely a spec weapon - incorrect again, in a tribrid fight I can hit 50's with a ballista consistently without ever specing. Very useful for dealing a lot of damage off prayer.
---
Vs 
---
Something you can buy off ge that's actually expensive. Sure it's good, his even. But pvp has been really stale as of late. God forbid people actually die in the wildy if better spec weapons and pvp armours are added to the game
---
I pray that God Ash shines his mercy upon Runelite
---
Jagex WILL NOT BAN YOU. Imagine them banning you for using a 3rd party client that they have stated is allowed .. Jagex could shut down osbuddy if they wanted to so why dont they do that ... Use it until its removed cause its not your job to second guess a plugin on a client that jagex approves of
---
&gt;I think currently it's unfair for Jagex to ban anyone since they haven't said anything about 1 click blackjacking
---
Why is it unfair?
---
They've banned people in the past for doing this with AHK. And despite what people are claiming, it's not the same as a menu entry swapper since it's swapping entirely separate actions on the fly.
---
Just camp the void helm, then all you're switching extra is void gloves -&gt; torment. Not sure what the problem is with the neck, that stacks with void's bonus.
---
If they don't want to make it so the skull stays after dying, it would be better to let people remove the skulls by entering/leaving the portal again, so they don't destroy the fun for the people playing the minigame.
---
Ex hcim should have a grey helm and a certain percentage of it should be red depending on how far they made it through to max
---
You clarified your statement and then I responded to that. You need to get the stick out of your ass
---
You would have to literally rebalance the entirety of the game just for one skill. A skill that is not needed in the current state of OSRS. It would rebalance the game entirely for no reason. It's a retarded idea.
---
How much gold did you buy?
---
You must be something pointless like a mall security guard.
---
Okay, guys, now this is EPIC!
---
Yeah I thought the same too about to gp/hr just didn’t want to be wrong and my fav pet tried to grind for it and got bored lmao
---
Melee might be most profitable yes, but I think you'll still wanna use salve ammy, not torture
---
I've looked around and i think the answer is no.  But do you know if you can still get it?
---
there IS no eastern one
---
slower xp and less gp for being able to afk it at some profit much like sharks magic logs and the like
---
This but unironically
---
Why did i read that
---
god damn i dunno. i got the golden trench and 3 pearl rod so i did a few days worth but not many. I also got my heron with barb fishing the later few levels. I can't give you details because i didn't think it was important at the time. You know a 5k drop rate i didn't expect to have this problem. Hence i want a mod to look on my account and also bring attention to a potential max catch like the vorkie head at 50 kc
---
Why not 31 pray ?!?!
---
Could be useless info, but make sure you have enough antidote protection. You need 3 layers if I'm correct, so like anti drag shield and anti potion and protect mage means no hits from magic attacks etc
---
I've never bought gold lol, my buddy gave me a sweet deal BCP for tasseys
---
I have read something about player id once. It’s also the same thing that calculates which player gets the first hit in the duel arena. Im sorry i don’t have a link for you atm but that has something to do with how this deal went down
---
Yh mam let's just disable pvp in the wilderness while we're at it :))))
---
h
---
Yeah.
---
Group up
---
That is against the rules and bannable... That's exactly the reasoning I used to defend that side of MES being too far..
---
What is the usual if I was doing it for xp?
---
People want to believe fantasies. The customers are not stakeholders, jagex does not care about what they have to say (look at rs3).
---
Bonds were released, which the customers did not want.
---
I said what I said because they may say we have a say, but in the end we don't. They will add whatever or do whatever to make more money.
---
If they actually cared they would remove osbuddy as it's blatantly breaking the rules by not being 1:1.
---
And funny thing is jagex is not doing anything as I guarantee you  they are going to try to work a deal with osbuddy to work on the official client I bet.
---
Anyway thanks for not calling me a retard like the others.
---
I'm sure anythi g jagex will say will be bad about this situation, I don't see this 3rd party client situation ending well
---
Just elite void range and I believe it's only if you have 99 range. Not sure how much better it is because u take more damage than with dhide or arms. You would still use anguish and tormented brace
---
the reason it's juice is because it's actually foreskin and not snakeskin
---
Best afk thing at work is paying attention to your work  or stay in touch with your friends on whatsapp

This request is to actually boost pvp in the wilderneess. Pker' attacking someone who really only has the option to run away is not pvp.

---
Why would your 10 year old self be proud of cheating?
---
What's the evidence they've done it before?
---
Damn that sounds dope. don't know how hard it would to implement tho
---
Use the official client and BAN all 3rd party clients.
---
Made me lol
---
Nah, skull tricking is not scamming
---
Just don't be an idiot in the wild or turn your attack options off
---
Claws vs c hally is like d scimitar vs blade of saeldor. There's quite literally no comparison. Dwh can be replaced with bgs if youre the only person with it.
---
I was thinking more of swmpletics and karamja only uim but okay haha
---
Not sure if you’ve seen but the pet rock is actually “alive”. It’s been confirmed by I think mod wolf.  I think we will see a lot of pet rock memes in the new frem quest.
---
I absolutely agree. Have you heard any of the mods on this idea? I'm wondering how difficult such a toggle option would be, or if they've never been exposed to this idea
---
You really shouldn't be. People are laughing at you, not with you.
---
Nice, you can finally do the hard clue step with that headband
---
Wait what.... is it some new version? Im pretty sure i have completed the entire game a very long time ago but i don’t remember the pyramid?
---
Yeah same, I'm waiting for exactly that. An opertunity to frame it! Doubt it gets thaaaat damaged though
---
I'm not sure if there is a way to disable examine on RL but I know there is an option to make names of drops stack, so instead of having 6 different entries for bones it just says Bones x6. It's what I use.
---
They did!
---
It’s mouse and keyboard
---
Glad I could draw some attention to the clarification! I wasn't sure how to fix it myself.
---
So we're polling until it passes then?
---
Kill goblins in lumby
---
They don't deliver to underground pass
---
The idea is that this encourages pvm vs pker interactions. It's ultimately beneficial to both pker's and pvmer's. The only group it impacts is the pker's that rely on skull tricking to make money.
---
Console also has mouse and keyboard
---
Exposed shoulders? Thanks for the nudes, kid.
---
He literally says he mainly plays rs3..... you can make 60m/hr on rs3 by killing endgame bosses
---
I mean the security improvement stuff was always going to be a multi month process. Like the blogs stated that upgrading their systems was going to take time.
---
I mean hyperinflation, botting, no customer support are just a few of the huge problems that could kill the game long term. We are in now way perfect state rn
---
i bought the shit for 1,7b and kept it. now 600m and didnt even learn the tob.
---
How many cape of skulls you got?
---
Considering there is no eastern pet and you’re still talking bullshit, do you need help?
---
Thanks guys, banks only about 50-60m so I think I’ll hold off for now (currently have torture and b ring). Also re: Dharoking at NMZ, I know that’s meta but to be honest I don’t really care about playing “efficiently”, so not going to go down that route. Also would prefer not to use a whip for the moment, as I want to keep my attack / defence at 75 until I reach 99 strength.
---
How do I find a group? I just started playing
---
Let's not act like our favourite client isn't overpowered just because reddit likes it. RL has tile markers, metronome, anti drag, demonic gorillas, CoX scouting, bone -&gt; alter menu entry swap, ham pickpocket menu entry swap, kourend library solver, MTA solver, clue solvers and screen markers.
---
Every single one of those plugins makes being efficient at their respective activity SIGNIFICANTLY easier (tile markers are basically essential for some high level pvm methods like 5.2t kril method).
---
Pro paint skills
---
Trading standards won’t do shit..
---
They have customer support, yes it isn’t the greatest, yes it’s a piece of shit but it is there. 
---
Go walk into your local corner store and ask for the customer support team of their store, they will just laugh at you.
---
Meanwhile I get 10 black long swords and 15 mith kites :) 
---
Is VLS 35% spec or 50? There is so much conflicting information here, honestly a poorly-written blog.
---
Had to do 4 quests including regicide and in aid of myrque for a hard clue that ended up being worth 47k
---
I officially havent got it ever! just checked my collection book . 2 of each bass and swords. 0 big shark. please mods. check my account the collection log don't tell me how many fish i've fished
---
And here is me, 3100+ dry on a whip..
---
It's more simple than this makes it sound. Only one person holds the copyright to runelite - they could buy the rights and then hire or not hire whomever they decided to
---
It means they are an Ironman, Ironman btw
---
You think the amount of people remote accesses their desktop with their smartphones and being present every 20minutes through the day, including when they sleep has the same quantity/volume of users as 6hr afk? Honestly a mind blowing theory. Slayer is super common nowadays, back in the day like 80% of people had under 70slayer with max melees, now you never see it.
---
Guthans was a 15m set during this period, and crashed by like 80% when it was fixed. Accumulated monthly melee xp declined enormously. Average exp gains dropped enormously. It was the first non-polled integrity poll jagex ever did because that's how broken it was. The argument not to patch it at the time was literally "this game is designed for the nostalgia trip, not long term integrity". 
---
It was the most broken mechanic RuneScape has probably ever had in its 20year history. We're talking about ZERO clicks, very nearly free exp gains for six hours. At 60-70k exp per hour.
---
"We will work to build a better official client, untill then you can keep using 3rd party clients at your own risk. Actions we deem to be over bearing and unfair to the integrity of the game will we deem as bannable."
---
Pretty nuch the statement i want.
---
There's also a ton of practical things that need work on the engine outside of a new gamemode btw
---
Please.
---
I sent them a ticket. I have to wait a while. Thanks for the help. I already play less OSRS now because I focus more on Monster Hunter World Iceborne but I still play OSRS whenever I am watching youtube or doing things on the PC. It becomes a habit and I almost got 99 smithing only from cannonballs..
---
So maxed players can die all they want and keep the icon? New hcim tob meta
---
Go to a high skill total world then if you dont like pures? Theres almost no reason to go into the wildly if you dont like it unless you're an iron hunting a unique or doing a clue, and even then you can get a clue box or just drop the clue if you're that scared. You can still make bank from wildy bosses despite being pked every now and then, which is the whole idea.
---
CC OSRShelpme is chill af

Oh forget to mention I use the absorbtion method I bring 3 ovls 6 absorbs or 5 depends how much I afk and the rest brews

The amount of weapon upgrade kits is starting to bug me. I get it if it's helps preserve nostalgic like for the Gmaul, but Abyssal Dagger, Saradomin Sword, Occult Necklace, Elder Maul etc? I'd rather they just straight up buff the base weapon or keep the new weapon for future content rewards.

You're trying so hard, keep at it buddy

Isn't that what everyone is screeching for on reddit or am I reading a different reddit from you?

Being gay isn't political. Media portraying gay characters isn't political. Gay people exist.

RuneScape actually did a Pride event. A legitimate political event which showed their support of the community! It was awesome. I still wear the scarf in my fashionscape.
---
Pretty big difference between a corner store and an online company pulling in millions don't you think? And the last time i had a problem at my local store it was because i had bought some cider that turned out to be out of date. Opened it, took a sip and noticed the taste so the next day i took it back and was offered a refund. 
---
They actually don't have a customer support as you can't contact them unless it's regarding payment. No surprises there though right?
---
Basically someone who doesn't work, doesn't go to school, etc

This explains why there was flour in the mill in Gwenith the first time I arrived there. I thought Jagex just decided to put some free flour there for your first viit or something.
---
Just use the font 4Head
---
Yeah but its still illegal or is it different swapping than buying gp? Don't they have waves where they ban a lot of people that rwts?

There should be an option to enchant it and make it follow you

A lot of fucking people on this sub need to be told this.
---
The archive site, the reason is because a few pages worth of HTML are a few megabytes at most.
---
The entire backend of accounts, JavaScript features, records of posts, profiles, images, etc, take up gigabytes at minimum. When a site dies a site dies, archive sites just record what was there to see. 
---
Like, you can go through every website change of Roblox since about 2007 on the waybackmachine site, but the catalog, every user made place and model and shirt or whatever isn't there. Neither are most users profiles or images, it's just too much stuff.

Ez just buy it from ge problem solved

This was enjoyable to watch
---
Not from what I've heard, but I haven't runecrafted in forever, I think it's a mobile only thing that they might end up implementing.

And as you're mentioning, left click bones exist, which is still a macro under your definition, not just a grey area.

Boaty showed that you can give individual items special shift-left click option. So he can make the pestle and mortar + herb not be dropped while holding shift.
---
So you can 3-tick fish, while dropping each fish for everyone you catch. Hold shift and it will drop fishes, but not what you've excluded from being dropped, they'll get the 'use' action.
---
And you can do thig with everything, and that's not included in vanilla.
---
So there's loads of macros from your definition in RuneLite, which should get the same treatment if you're not gonna be a hypocrite.
---
You'd still have to go though a third party software to get the clue solved for you. That argument is just as reasonable as "they can get an autoclicker from somewhere else, so lets just give them one".
---
that's why it's a "dynamic" entry swap, it's creating a entirely new option, it never highlights the bones or anything. it's like places that have "fill bucket" or " take x".
---
the thing that will get you banned using it is how specifically the osbuddy version blocks inputs which results in perfectly timed ticks which could be detected as macroing.
---
honestly if I didn't get pked constantly I would have used it for 99 prayer before they made an announcement simply because jagex didn't instantly make an announcement about it dispite it being over powered
---
If you buy GP (as in, 1 trade on 1 game where you gain money) you'll be banned.
---
If you swap GP (2 or more trades on both games where give and gain money) then you will be fine.
---
I'll have the chicken please.

I saw him runecrafting a few times. I only said 877-CASH-NOW though
---
Left click con and thieving are menu entry swaps. The actual action itself is 1:1. The new plugins like the altar are not 1:1, they're doing multiple actions per each action of the user, making them a form of macroing and therefore bannable.

Literally the most aids place right in front of even the battle palace

It’s just this subs stupid flair system

Happy birthday, in my opinion one of the coolest looking pets
---
I would, I plan on doing it right at release
---
Hahaha what?? Dont get me wrong, I use a 3rd party client too, but who the hell are you to tell someone who uses the first party client and has a preference for it, to quit?? I have plenty of opinions against the playerbase, yet I've still played this game longer than most have. Dont tell people to quit because of a opposite opinion of the masses.
---
So its illegal then but you will be fine?
---
You are not breaking any game rules if you swap money
---
84 construction is my most immediate goal. Though can you clarify, what is unlocked at 84? With max boosts (+5 stew, +3 saw) I don't see anything 92 worthwhile.. occult altar is at 90..
---
Happy Birthday :)

Skull tricking is an issue, that is why you can change player attack options. When I go 3 iteming in the wildy I have options completely off. The only way I can attack back is with auto retaliate, which can't skull me (outside of edge cases ik ik).

Some little girl that made some big dramatic crybaby speech at the UN climate summit. Very over dramatic and clearly written by her 8th grade science teacher.

Gz holy shit
---
The possibility of doing it is there, sure, but if it reduced the number of people doing it by 98% then your argument is unnecessary. You're just being pedantic about theoreticals when in reality removing 6hr afk had a huge effect on the game.
---
For a shitty analogy let's say jagex bans 1click bone on altar plugins. Well 1 ticking prayer is still possible so does that mean banning 1 click plugins had zero effect on the game?
