I would love a version of this https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/World_map#/media/File:Gielinor_map_poster.png in your style though, wouldn't have to be as detailed as your shilo map though. The only issue I have with this map is the RS2/RS3 stuff that isn't in OSRS (and wouldn't be in it, ex: I'm okay with menaphos, but not daemonheim or soul wars)

Once you unlock ranarrs through herblore, herbs are all you really need to do for money. Essentially you should look up where all the herb patches are on the wiki, figure out which ones you currently have access to, how to get to each of them fastest (think teleports, boats and fairy rings if you have them), then take with you one herb seed and ultracompost for each patch, then a spade, seed dibber and rake. Rake the patch so you clear the weeds then plant the seed and use the compost on the patch. It should take 1hr 20min? Or so to fully grow, then you collect the grimy herbs and replant and compost, rinse and repeat. Clean the herbs and either sell them on the GE, make them into unfinished potions by combining them with a vial of water or make them into prayer pots for herblore xp, but you'll be losing a bit of money this way.

I haven't kicked the depression beast outside of a few drunk episodes but I would highly recommend a cognitive behavioral workbook for anxiety.  It helped me a ton and costs $20-30 USD.  Basically steps you through how anxiety is your lizard brain wanting you to imagine the worst case scenario and how to disarm it.  The book helped me a lot with basic stuff like answering the phone and going out in public without anxiety forcing me back inside.  Not a total cure but goes a long way to helping function as an adult.  Like this week I finally stopped feeling like I need to phrase food orders like a question and can just state my order like a normal person

I've been following that for awhile now doing the 4th rotation and I finally got my first kill with 2hp remaining. Thing is but its on the beta mode so I have max stats and better gear so I don't think I'd be able to do it on my main.

So do I set blow pipe on rapid then when I get to the pillar set it to long range?

And also which attack style do I use  on the trident accurate or long range?

You can enchant emerald rings to make rings of dueling. You'll usually break even or make a small profit since they're always being used.

It's kind of slow but it's good if you don't want to spend much gp on xp. Same goes for other AFK bankstanding methods like enchanting other types of jewelry and spells like Plank Make, it's slow but you can start the spell and do something else.

I don't play osrs, haven't for years. Yet every couple of months or so I get a legit email from Jagex informing me of a password reset request on my account. Of course I do change it to a random sequence of letters and numbers but it keeps happening. Is Jagex account security really that much of a joke?
---
Guess I'll save for the bgs and sell the crossbow when I eventually buy it.
---
yikes
---
Ain't that the truth. I think many people view SC (and Penguin hunting) with rose-tinted glasses. They were popular because of the XP rewards. Actually, since XP can be gained more easily in RS3 through other sources now, Penguin hunting has become far less busy. It was literally the XP rewards that kept people doing these activities...
---
Compare them to Castle Wars or Trouble Brewing which have cosmetic rewards and are not super populated.
---
#YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN CHANGED
---
Sorry but a formal english email from Jagex wouldnt have that on top. This is clearly made to scare someone right from the first moment you see it.

The only problem is that it's currently dead content. No one is doing it when Zalcano exists and they felt perfectly fine buffing her drop table.

&gt; I‚Äôve been wanting this for years. There would need to be some reward system to incentivize people to play it for sure. 
---
Some people in this thread seem to think it will be super busy as people will just want to play "for fun". I definitely think the XP incentivisation is what kept SC popular in RS3. But you're right, the question is what rewards would be suitable?
---
You can't just click the 3rd tree. Here's a vid showing how you can move between trees https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zy-exHWZU. He has a few vids on his channel where he does the crossover, it's different from ape atoll due to the positioning of the third tree.

The tough thing is that if the rewards were shit, no one would do it as it would be faster to train your skills using other methods.

I'm out of membership.

This is the only account that's ever been tied to my Google play account.

The hold up is I've never used the free trial, and I believe because I've had membership in the past it won't allow me to use the trial. 
---
That's fine, but it also won't allow me to purchase membership without the free trial.

I've had to buy bonds to redeem for membership the past few months, but that makes my membership $14 a month instead of $11.

---
If you're in multi way combat it doesn't matter.
---
If you are in single way combat and fighting a monster nothing else can attack you besides other players. (I think there are npcs that ignore this, but not in the wild) 
---
So the idea is you want to stay in combat with a monster that is of less threat then the pker, but you don't want to kill it. Let's take fire Giants in the wilderness. If you see a pker just equipt your flowers and attack a semi fresh fire giant just to be safe. He can attack you between the time one dies and before you attack the next so just use your best judgement. You are perfectly safe now. You can sit there and wait him out or xlog.

But if they ever do OSWoW....
---
I guess I'm a "PvMer", pretty much by default because my account is an ironman. Either way, I like doing wilderness slayer and stuff, but honestly I only risk black d'hide and a glory, and maybe some sharks and a super set ... it's not like I am going to risk expensive items, nor could there be any reason for me to do so, because I rely completely on RNG to acquire said expensive items.
---
The point is .. if you manage to PK me, you're only gonna get about 30k in loot. I think Jagex needs to re-assess the idea of fox-and-rabbit wilderness content. Luring people out to the wilderness who don't want to get PK'd will only result in people risking as little as possible.
---
On the other hand, if there is cool new content in the wilderness that is enjoyable for its own sake, and not simply as a means to "lure out PvMers", the wilderness will revive on its own.
---
What we really need is a Wilderness quest. And I mean a real quest, not minigame or miniquest like Mage Arena. The goal should be for people to become less afraid of the wilderness and to enjoy the thrill of risking your stuff.
---
Finally, we should remember that it's called "the wilderness" for a reason. It's a barren, destroyed landscape full of mystery and is not intended to be packed with players. If Jagex tries too hard to "fix" something that's not necessarily broken, we will have the same things happen to OSRS that happened to RS2.
---

Haha yes
---
There's a huge difference between killing people training prayer at the wilderness altar possibly risking noted bones, and killing some random guy running around assuming he has a clue scroll.
---
Weird to me. I was never a real pker but I always thought that the possibility of losing your items to your opponent made runescape stand out from other games. Not just in the wildy. Also in other areas where you only had limited time to retrieve your items. It made content feel much more intense and thrilling to me. Apparently I'm the only one that thinks like that though?!
---
Why would that make you scared start over and go again lol
---
Nmz, dust Devils, nech

---
Dumb question maybe but what happens if you are taking poison damage and whether you are in combat or not and log out. Does your character keep taking damage but you can't see because you've logged?
---
I'm also curious say in the wilderness if you are fighting other players (haven't done this in about 13 years) can you not just close the client or log out?
---
If it doesn't hit well then I'm killing it as quickly as I'm used to, with no BGS at all. 
---
I know that you're correct going strictly numerically, but fuck that.
---
runelite?  How do you make the pots show up blue?  Does it work for food too?
---
Gg account
---
Additionally, you automatically assumed that the guy only partakes in killing people who dont fight back which is almost definetely not the case. Anyone who pks at the wilderness altar also runs into other pkers, and most people fight each other. You just generalized all pkers by equating someone actively killing other pkers, and prayer trainers to someone who only kills clue scrollers and considers that competitive.

They should put a poll in to make the Defense skill actually matter in PvP situations. Right now all it does is push the account into a much much higher tier that it simply can't compete in. 
---
Account build 1: (A Main that would be able to handle some typical wilderness monsters/content) 103 CB 
---
80 Attack, 80 Defense, 85 Strength, 84 HP, 80 range, 75 magic, 70 prayer.
---
Account build 2: (A maxed Pure) 91 CB
---
80 attack, 1 Defense, 99 strength, 99 hitpoints, 99 range, 99 magic, 70 prayer. 
---
They have room for up to 50 levels of defense (questing) while still being the lower combat level. Even then, at the same combat level they're *insanely* stronger in comparison. And the type of gear you get at 60+ defense becomes pure risk, and not worth it. (cheaper to die 100 times with nothing-gear than risk good gear and lose it once.)

It's been suggested lots of times. It's just a lot  of work the devs say. They don't see a pet expansion in the future (Mod Ash mentioned this...yesterday?)

I wish we would just get a notification that the drop wont be ours prior to the finishing blow.
---
"b-b-but you crossed the ditch. let me switch from my scout to my botted 94 magic alt"
---
You're missing imbued heart and tormented bracelet
---
Uh I respawn Fally. Git gud.
---
If your goal is to populate the wilderness by allowing players to have a 10-20 second window to logout before being attacked by someone logging in, 
---
Yup that's exactly the plan, because as the original post explained: log-in ambushing after scouting from another world is inherently unfair and should be considered meta-gaming.
---
You want to attack other players in the wilderness? There's a really easy solution: just stay on the same damn world and chase players regularly instead of log-in ambushing.
---
well unless there was a rebalance. regardless of rewards, people would quickly turn it into the boring ass efficient method which would put people off.
---
so it's totes 2 fold. boring gameplay and possibly terrible rewards.
---
Pink clay. When you buy an inferno cape he‚Äôs the one who gets it for you

Ok making death harsher is a damn good answer IMO. As for your counter points.
---
1. Zulrah great a boss that shits out 1.5-1.8m/hr in profit only costs 25k when you die. That means jack all when ur killing the damn thing in lets say on average 40m+ in gear. That is not risk thats just an inconvenience since you can legit telly right to it.
---
2. Skulltricking I wouldn't say is questionable at all. If you're stupid enough to fall for them so be it. Ive fallen for a few of these myself to the tunes of 50m+ You get over it and move on
---
3. The bosses are fine without the safe spots as theyre meant to be killed in duos aside from vet'ion who is just a straight up bullshit for the pay off.
---
4. Teams logging in on top of you has been apart of the wilderness for  as long as I can remember having played since 04-05. Its multicombat and dangerous unless the team is abusing dragon spears I sadly still dont see a problem here.
---
5. Yes it will seem lame to the average player because the average player at this point has played at game that has 0 risk in it unless you go to the wilderness or the devs fuck up on release.
---
Dying to Zulrah or Vorkath when the gear youre using comes in at around 100m average between the two for average gear there the 25-100k redemption fee means nothing as realistically thats less than 1 successful kill at either of them for their respective fees.
---
Yes changing the death mechanics will cause people to be upset initially but theyll get over it in time. After a few months the PKer/PvMer rift will heal up a little bit cause people wont rage about petty shit cause theyll actually be used to losing something. Whether it be items or a % in gold of the total dropped wealth to reclaim the items
---
I wonder what's the chance of killing Ahrim with claw specs only in this setup

You will never get a dragon med helm drop from Otherworldly Beings. Even if you spend the entire summer killing them.

sure, putting pvm and skilling in the wildy is ok, but it DOES alienate the pkers and along with garbage skull tricking making pkers seen as even worse, it's a bad time just waiting to happen.

I don't think he's being pessimistic at all, more close to the truth than anything. I admit that a big chunk of my  entertainment is watching twitch streams.  
---
A lot of them advocate, and touch on mental health quite frequently. Some have even opened up, even admitting that "yes", streaming has had some form of impact on their health, via physical or mental.
---
Nice congrats! i was trying to get the sauce spider a couple weeks ago until my internet has become too unstable to pvm.
---
reminds me of Don't Starve
---
Reminds me of a bloodveld from RS3.
---
North of Prifddinas, Enchanted Valley, and Realm of the Fisher King.
---
When I had just started playing RS I went to a pvp world and looted amethyst arrows. Then I was watching a high risk fight and it ended up on a double ko.
---
I got a B neck, Robin hood hat, obby maul.
---
That shit set me up for the entire early game
---
Nice, he just validated every single pker's attack on clue hunters...
---
I had designed a raid for mid level players before and the reaction that it got was basically disdain that it was meant for low levels and not end game pvmers.
---
And pkers can‚Äôt cry about a fucking shield when they are risking dog shit. I don‚Äôt mind anti pk‚Äôing someone. What I do mind is when I get attacked by someone who is shit at switches and has zero risk. At that point he is just wasting my time, I will drop him and continue on what I was doing, literally no point even wasting another second to pick up their shit tier loot.
---
You'll be able to buy a max level when an expansion comes out and such.
---
No problem haha. I was just trying to figure it out cause I'm not at demonics yet. Unfortunately I don't have an answer to your question.
---
With alts you don‚Äôt have to leave altar at all. It doesn‚Äôt get any faster then that.
---
There's too many worlds for the "chase players regularly". It just isn't feasible. If this is the case, people would just relog every 15 seconds and be essentially godmode and make scouting even easier in a way. Then you'd get a 40man clan just stay 1 guy on every world and as soon as one gets an attack, you're screwed.
---
Horrible suggestion.
---
I guess you could say the cooking gauntlets came off.
---
Yeah, I guess. Good point.
---
no restores?
---
13 years ago. I was 13. I just started playing. I earned my way to an air and water staff. I traded a player both cause he wanted to see them on his character. I followed him for an hour trying to get him to trade them back. He logged and I cried. Good times.

It's way less than that, it's not even 1%
---
But you would remove all your mage defence right?
---
you can't reasonably do that in osrs anyway. People are always saying that people get t bow from bonds. I would be shocked if even a dozen people have ever done that.
---
You‚Äôre a sad gremlin. You probably only listen to mumble rap.
---
No, it's hi how are you.
---
Umm that‚Äôs like 40m worth of darts
---
My favorite thing to do was hide in the clouds and pickpocket 10k catalyst runes from some mage. They were always so salty.
---
One of the biggest things that makes me mad about this sub is when you guys talk about other games.  I feel like none of you actually play anything other than osrs.  Just stay in your lane
---
Not sure. They didn‚Äôt seem to hit much on me when I used arma, ely, and staff spec when they were barraging
---
I'm quite the opposite I would be absolutely fucking shocked if they didn't put MTX in classic. 
---
It already seems like it's going to blow up and once it does they are going settle for a minimal profit increase from the subscriber increase. This is a much bigger corporate machine.
---
Eeh that's just 43 more levels!
---

---
&gt;A killstreak ends when you are killed by any player, log out
---
Does this only apply when I currently have a target? i.e. I successfully kill my target in a suicide attack at rev caves but his team kills me right afterward, would my killstreak be reset?
---
It's more if you have been skull tricked before, or have been warned of it before, more so than an IQ.
---
I'm sure I don't know all the methods, but I'm sure I fit under your below 25 IQ group for falling for this one.
---
So it's simple. 2 accounts. 1 attacks you, binds/freezes you and moves under you. Then the 2nd account logs in under you and moves out and since its the wildy, you are trying to retaliate and attack this new account and get skulled.
---
so i'm sure you'll just reply 'turn off player attack' well. that is a way to prevent skull tricking and neuters yourself. instead of acting like pvp and fighting someone.
---
fuck some people are thick :')
---
Kronk good
---
it was really boring like 6 months after release.
---
tiny maps, no combat, just skilling inside a minigame for some 2x armor/tools
---
This is incorrect.  Magic bonuses are still relevant for making Karil.
---
Damage you take in the tunnel is negligible.  I don't even use food for most of my runs, it's more profitable to bank after every run so you don't use money on Prayer potions.  This is assuming you aren't an ironman
---
Never heard or saw about that, but this is nothing like that. This is all manual! (-:
---
Scratch this, let's make it so you can log out when in combat instead
---
but why
---
only if it includes "Me" to stop being a dickhead
---
I mean they HAVE said that but the response has always been pretty negative. It sort of defeats the purpose. Wow isnt like RS. If they did release TBC pretty much all vanilla content would be dead instantly.
---
I wanna suckle on it
---
did u accidentally pick more than 3 venenatis?

The answer is almost definitely yes.

I was at wintertodt and a ton of people started freaking out about it
---
Na but i've never done it before. couldn't get the safespot to work so kept wrecking me. Then on my last attempt PKers come so that was the last straw
---
I'm high and I'm thinking this is a great idea
---
Cool story bro, needs more dragons
---
Which is one of the problems that LMS does actually address by allowing you to PvP in Med/High-Max gear. Also one of the reasons I had such a blast at castle wars back in the day.
---
There are people who are just good at the game.
---
Also people who can do inferno on pures often help others to get the cape I think

The only time I ever have to eat or use a prayer dose is if I get Dharok or Karil in the tunnel.  Healing after every trip is definitely the way to go.
---
Did you just post and immediately delete your account
---
Training is so easy that I would say that cox is completely doable ‚Äúmid game‚Äù because you basically just gotta afk crabs and nmz for a few weeks then you‚Äôre ready
---
Have you tried the We Do Raids discord? I was 1kc for months and then finally jumped back in. Even if you don‚Äôt find a designated mentor raid, there are a lot of great people who will teach you. All you gotta do is talk in the ‚Äúlooking for mentor‚Äù channel. 
---
Only 1 of my 15kc was with a mentor, and that was after I pretty much learned all the rooms.
---
Fuuuuck that‚Äôs rough
---
So essentially, you're agreeing that the wilderness is wildly unbalanced and in a bad spot... But you're okay with that because the ditch says that you can be killed by players north of it...?
---
When I enter a PvP match in Destiny, I understand that players can kill me there, but that doesn't mean that nobody has the right to complain to the devs when something unbalanced shows up and makes it less enjoyable to play.  Our complaints aren't invalid because it's a PvP area there, or in any game.  Nobody is asking to not die in PvP, we're asking for something closer to fair fights.
---
I *do* have every right to complain about the fact that the wilderness is in a shit state when I would love to go there and participate in PvP.  Unfortunately though, it's in a shit state and I don't want to deal with how broken it is, wasting my time in frustration instead of enjoying my time even if I lose fights.
---
Same here. Now I remember osbuddy used to make my mac book go crazy but runelite for the most part runs fine.
---
Get 99 then sell back for 12m
---
Making unfinished potions usually nets an extra 100-200gp profit over the clean herb, so it's usually worth the time. I'm at work but I'll try and find one later. It doesn't require heaps of attention, like 5min every 1.5hours so probably good for you.
---
I don't understand, if the scout can see you then you can see the scout. That gives you more time to react. There's no lack of information.
---
It‚Äôs funny how I can read a post and immediately know that OP doesn‚Äôt know what vagina feels like
---
wtf
---
Impossible.
---
&gt;ruined their mental health, sense of happiness and perspective on life by chasing momentary fame, a quick dollar
---
...so... A job? /s but not really.
---
I get what youre saying and it's especially true for the small streamers who get stuck with low view counts for years hoping to make it big, but it's not impossible to legitimately enjoy streaming for a career. For the bigger streamers I think it heavily relies on the community they build.
---
Someone like summit or timthetatman have it a lot better off than even someone like XQC who has to deal with constant tts, or a much more extreme example, someone like ice poseidon, who pretty much ruined his life with his toxic community (and himself).
---
You should replace it with the trap remix. That would hit hard with this
---
thank you very much for this informative post.
---
They literally fixed this just now, did you not read the blog
---
Thanks chief will do!
---
Still is, apparently!
---
What parts specifically are you saying are unbalanced. And yes the wildy is in a shit state because jagex has failed to update it for numerous years now. The wildy should be the best money maker in this game. Instead we have instanced bosses that jagex keeps pushing out. imagine if wildy bosses/skilling made more than vorkath/zulrah it would be extremely active.
---
i didnt even know it existed 1 sec
---
[here](https://youtu.be/bfcZacwnVCk)
---
That's my jammmmm
---
But the skill cape looks so cool with blue graceful :c
---
You don't "lose RNG". The next time you kill one you have the same odds to get any drop as the last kill or any other kill for that matter.
---
I think it will turn into a jagex situation where they have an old school version to maximize sub count and the retail game to squeeze every dime out of the player base

---
Well, no, you can perform this action outside the main arena when casting 100 of each and it does not move you. 
---
Performing it against a boss on the other hand appears to be broken or I just had excessively high ping. Each action that was performed just kept moving me to the boss, despite manual casting
---
It's still built on the same game engine.
---
Want to upvote cos it's funny, but want to downvote cos don't want 6 more weeks of runecraft
---
And they go to revs on the basis of killing pvmers so yes you are trying to push pvmers into the wild in return bump up pvpers.
---
Is there a clip of this anywhere?
---
I was legit yelling at my screen out of frustration lmao
---
Similar arguments where said about osrs on release. There was initially no want for late game items due to fear of power creep you spoke about. 
---
Osrs is a tier 75 based game now, with more niches then monster types. I never played wow, but after witnessing all the drama, and being apart of all the live streams for the first 5 years on osrs, I think that content could still be added, and there are too many people who started at different times, with different opinions for a sentiment to hold up for a long time.
---
I think the biggest factor is its a triple A company making the title so communication between players and Dev teams are not going to be the same. If anything I would think just a lack of clear communication between the two would prevent more content from even happening. I think we take for granted how magical we got it with osrs, and how great the 75% poll system is.
---
I did it from maxed zerk to 75 def and zero regrets
---
If I died after getting a cape once I wouldnt take my hands off mouse and keyboard based only on an exp drop and yell lmfao
---
ITS DONE
---
Yeah that makes sense. 
---
No matter what you choose, there will prolly be a lot of work. 
---
Seems like you could either keep this account as a main and build up a new zerker, or make a new main and keep the zerker.
---
I mean, you don't really NEED to be maxed to pk, so you could build up a new Zerker to pk with and make this your main.
---
I think your other stats could play into this as well, if you build up a new zerker, you don't need as high of non-combat skills, so if you have a lot of high non-combat skills on this account, going 70 def with it and making it a "main" seems like the better plan. Seems like it would be easier to make a new zerker, than it would to make a new main.
---
You could even start out as a pure, to get some more pking practice on the new account before you get up to max again. It will be easier to practice pking at the lower levels, so thats a benefit to starting a new account to pk with.
---
I also like the other persons suggestion of making a new iron man to use as a main, but that might be something you wanna do.
---
Ya
---

---
For some, it might be "thrill", but to most I think it's anxiety. Which is not pleasant.
---
Another thing is, I think the majority of RS players are getting older, and busier. I'm married and have a job. I only have, at most, a few hours to play every day. A particularly bad death can feel like I just wasted a whole day's worth of playing. That's a horrible feeling.
---
The drop table is already amazing
---
What world you doing it on?
---
Average kill is 60k gp, she ain't bad.
---
You should need 69 mage to do that
---
Getting a job is the best money maker in game, so I'd be shocked if it were anywhere near that low who use it as their money maker. Maybe not T bow, because it's not what noobs go for, but bandos, claws, things like that, without a doubt.
---
&gt;  bis for bonds
---
That's what **BTW** is for. RWT devalues my normie activities.
---
Barrows, Vork, Corp, pretty much anything really.
---
This would actually be an amazing addition, especially as a high level spell!
---
maybe instead of a bank, a charged essence stone that provides a mining spot for rune essence but requires a certain amount of runes per essence mined. this completes the goal of not having to run all over the damn place to make a single trip, creates a sink for runes and is still gated by the amount of time it takes to mine rune essence to not make it ridiculously efficient.
---
Ywah but you hve to kill her twice to get said loot
---
That would be the herblore version
---
Does it also change legs into skirts and reverse?
---
Half the time you can pipe the pker down to around 60 to 70 hp and double claw spec them out
---
Of course you need to lower the volume. Because a streamer/youtuber got it they need to scream to keep the small children entertained.
---
True. Still a pain though unless super lucky.

But if I get that staff, I could run barrows?
---
Would it be worth it, and is there a guide?
---
I think the thing most of the threads like this miss is that the incentives actually *work*.
---
Sure, PvMers moan about how wildy content is bad, but they *still* do it. There are still regularly people at black chins/wildy bosses/wildy slayer/larran's chest/elder druids/lava dragons/the altar in 38 wild/etc.
---
If you compare post-wildy rejuv (where hotspots actually often have people) to pre-rejuv (where you'd be lucky to find anyone outside of green dragons), it's clearly working.

On F2p release in runescape, you'd get the avas affect in any f2p world if you wore it (even tho it said members item etc).  This was abused by clans until someone exposed it on reddit.  Not surprising that when F2p castle wars was released the avas affect unlock for castle wars worked in f2p too.
---
This happened to me the first time to.. was such a bad experience
---
Imagine bringing pray pots or super restores to barrows ever.
---
Forreal tho bro, you're wasting your money unless you're ingame homeless lol.

Body runes, price is dangerously low, and they fit thematically. Make it cost 12k body runes to cast (market limit).

Hah pleb. I talk to Steve now... Poor Nieve....
---
Option two: two entry points, the SHA256 KEY + current system's succesful aproval of a recovery.
---
This way a hijacker would need to pass two walls: first managing to steal the code from the legitimate owner and also enought private info to spoof IP/identity to succed at a recovery request.
---
There's no huge costs to implement this, just hire a security expert lol.
---
&gt; factor in gear equipped and in inventory for determining combat level
---
Bro wtf are you talking about?
---
There is a 1/585 chance to hit the sigil drop table, which is what OP is referring to when they say he is over the drop rate.
---
If we were discussing that he is lucky to get a Ely drop this early, then yes he is under the droprate for that.
---
But since we are discussing him hitting the droprate for sigils in total, he is over the droprate.
---
Well support was working again, yep my pin was gone and yep my gear and money was gone. It was like 13m. But sadly im a noob... Should make some back soon tho

---
Oh sorry, I forgot about that, it actually appears in the video I should've mentioned
---
70 def meds are much better than mains tbh
---
the actual solution to this would be to get rid of the "temporary" death mechanics in safe areas and break the illusion that runescape is supposed to have safe deaths. it was never intended this way and the change was unpolled and solely based on bad server state. this issue has been long solved and now the only reason they'ven't reverted is because people would complain about it, as they've been indoctrinated into this playstyle where a death is just a free stats refresh and all bosses are a teleport and 2 clicks away from a bank üòÇ
---
when i started pking in 2005 it was because it was by far the best money maker &amp; had a dynamic enemy instead of something you click on every n seconds. the only extra risk in wilderness was that if you were skulled you'd risk 3 more items, but risk of losing items was everywhere. people didn't cry about the wilderness and being attacked like they do now. this still applied even in 2015, but has quickly changed since as safe deaths became the norm.  
---
jumping back to nowadays, pvp is still the best money maker (risk fights), but the dynamic has grossly changed because people have an immense fear of losing items since the rest of the game is risk free. this has lead to several things - depreciation of items &amp; inflation because nobody loses anything in most of the game, people don't pick up pvp because all the safe bosses &amp; slayer are risk free and net you astronomical figures per hour compared to back in the days and people are now entitled to being granted only rewards and have lost the idea of risk vs reward &amp; learning curves (the latter applying to people complaining that it's "impossible" to get into pvp).
---
so honestly, putting more pvm bosses in wildy or adding another useless item spawn won't do anything to revitalise pvp. we could have boosted drop tables on the existing wilderness bosses, rework of some of the currently safespot meta bosses (callisto, venenatis) - but the effects of those would only be temporary.  
---
the actual solution would be to remove safe death mechanics in "safe" areas, giving you up to 2-5 minutes to get back to your loot instead of the current 1 hour. the mechanics could be reinstated on the fly in case servers are being ddosed, but honestly that's barely happening these days.
---
Ive jerked off to enough elasta girl porn to know theres 2 r's in parr.

---
Each pouch should be locked behind a different elite diary
---
the current state of wilderness PK'ng is AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND SHOULD BE unfair and uncompetitive for the vast majority of non-PKers and skillers
---
FTFY
---
Exactly my point, Thank you! It makes the change more apparent =)
---
On the plus side it would make pure essence more expensive.
---
I want f2p frog boss
---
This is immediately what I thought of doing.
---
The wilderness pvm or other activities are some of the few things left in the game that can't be done with mindless afking. They require that you actually pay attention and play the game.
---
It's exciting to enter the wilderness, and you only enter it intentionally, and you understand the risks. If you don't want to die, don't go in. Identify methods of escape, and tanking tactics. Don't get mad that you can't void 100% of another player's damage with a protection prayer like you can vs the giant mole.
---
If you don't want to enter the wild, drop the clue, don't go for the mage arena 2 cape, and spend twice as much money on prayer.
---
Those activities aren't a punishment for people who are too scared to enter, but are a reward for the players who are willing to take that risk, and that's the truth.
---
How about crafting noted runes, all at once
---
That's a cock
---
No! I searched everything related to RuneScape on my email and the only things were the monthly recaps. I haven't put in my os info anywhere new in years
---
Or a pouch that can carry 500 essence

Is this from an item?

The thing with buying bonds with gp for members is that the bonds have to be bought with real money and then sold for gp in the first place which means if there weren't an insane number of people buying shitloads of bonds for real money hardly anyone could do this, and bonds would be insanely expensive

So I'm on a pvp world afking ammonites and some pker rolls up and sends me to fally. Now when I get there some dude sends me a trade request and I'm curious so I accept. He puts up eternal boots and like 8m worth of a few other bits of gear I only remember the eternals since it's the only thing I wouldnt have sold on the ge. He tells me to take it so I says to myself well sure I like free money. He cancels on the second screen and calls me poor and said I probably wished my entire bank was worth that much. Super fuckin weird.

---
Maybe not ahead of her time, but her design has certainly held up better than a lot of other bosses. But back in the day most bosses were hard to get to and had low kills per hour, even in teams. And with her 100% accuracy, she is certainly unforgiving, which is also why she holds up so well. Also, Vet'ion has similar forms of killing it twice.

I'd say KQ is tougher than a lot of stronger bosses like Graardor because of the accuracy alone; it is a ton of unavoidable damage no matter what you do. And if she were released today, I think there would rightly be a lot of players criticizing how she was designed. Before Hydra, Kieren listed some of his goal for bosses which I'd say are healthy things to aim for; KQ follows few of those design principles. It is a fun boss and it isn't too rewarding due to rewardcreep from other content, but it has little room for growth or improvement unless you could swapping from Verac's to a good crush weapon growth.
---
Very impressive.
---
It really isn't complicated. Fighting back only with auto-retaliate is so useless that it's better not to fight back at all.
---
By today standards sure.  back then chain was bis so...

Runelite uses up 30% of two 1080TI's in SLi. Settings turned to max, but only 1080p at only 50 fps.

With how much hype it gives i could see this happening

Just start with quests, do the f2p quests first and they'll give you a bit more of an idea

To be fair, that already existed at rogue's den. It's just a tiny decreased burn chance which is fair I think.

Look online for guides to complete the f2p quests and also work on getting your combat levels up at either the chickens/cows (you can find them by going East of the starter area across the bridge and then run North a little.

I'll be online tomorrow so feel free to add me (name is BombsAway993) and I'll help you get started.

I swear I remember hearing that blizzard split or is spliting from Activision though not sure if that's true or not.

---
I thought is voting poll....
---
The point isn't to attack with auto retaliate the entire time. What yo do is have auto retaliate on to see who has attacked you. Then you can turn off auto retaliate and fight back like normal. Auto retal is so that when you see a pker you don't jump the gun and start fighting right away. I've seen at black chins where a pker will a spell on a chinchompa and an eager anti pker will attck the pker right away and end up skulling. Auto retail prevents this from happening. It also lets you know who is attacking you when there are multiple people following you and you can't see the person attacking you. Auto retaliate brings that persons character on top and allows you to left click that person right away. These are some pvmers don't know about because they have simple not spent enough time in the wilderness to learn the mechanics. In all honestly you can 100% avoid getting skull tricked ans fight back successfully as an anti pker.

I genuinely wonder what the impact on the economy would be if rune essence were to stack. Something so simple would be so astronomically detrimental, I imagine. 
---
Essence stacks. Rune collections get dumped (billions of runes injected into market). Nature prices plummet. Alching becomes stupid profitable. Rune items demand increases. Slayer drops and rune-dropping mobs killing increase. So on and so on. 
---
This is a fraction of one chain reaction such a simple update would cause. There probably thousands of things that would happen. Essentially, stackable essence would be like Jagex bending the economy over a broken wooden table, burning a whole in the anus area of the pants, and open fisting it‚Äôs dunghole after eating a bucket of spicy wings. Not pretty.

It's not. Prif is better xp AND better money. Only reason to do ardy is being an ironman for staminas.
---
Haha, The only bosses I've beat are wintertodt (if hes considered a boss) and barrows maybe once. What combat would you suggest I start bossing and which bosses first?
---
doesnt surprise me hes friends with maxmoefoe and he also made rs comments before even in his vids. https://i.imgur.com/fK9G6JP.jpg
---
with that mindset I don't understand why you would play osrs over rs3 where buying achievements is actually part of the game
---
I think Mac has that ability in the keyboard settings in System Preferences.
---
Why do you need it to type something that takes less than a minute?
---
Level boosts, in fact they're introducing a 120 level boost to BFA likely next patch.  Either way, a lot of why people don't like RS3 is because of its rediculous cosmetics.
---
Can confirm. This was done as a joke and none of us expecte that to go through. Also, here's the G.E history :) [https://i.imgur.com/acVsz1q.png](https://i.imgur.com/acVsz1q.png)
---
Ding dong you are wrong.
---
Cant believe people actually care and are all for this idea. Obviously it would never happen. Maybe if jagex was an American company they would but I wouldn't be playing if that.
---
I would imagine that instead it would be a chest locked by an achievement diary like the chest in the crafting guild
---
As opposed to you who lives for putting people down behind a screen. You must be so fulfilled...
---
I did the corrupted gauntlet pre-nerf and died far more than i would like to admit before finally getting that hideous cape, i would need alot more practice before daring to enter on my HC even post nerf, respect.
---
Good job bro
---
Zulrah, vork and dks are all doable solo. You could 3 man gwd but won‚Äôt get to many kills, could also grab a friend and do some Calisto for easy cash too
---
How much did you lose?
---
so why play this game?
---
Not that much over, but I've essentially doubled all of their prices, except the toy box, which is probably 1000x GE
---
Gauntlet boss uses prayers and responds to your attacks

---
Ill never understand why people with access to mousekeys get such an advantage to those who don‚Äôt. If you can‚Äôt ahk virgin sweat withdraw from pouches you get horrible rates
---
The justification is that some skills need to be painful in order to make things worth it. Freminnik Elite has a stupid powerful perk and getting the stats is easy, except for runecrafting
---
7m per hour if the runes cost the same, which they would not

Bring a dds, spade and your clue. Sip a stamina at the bank if you have to. Bring a glory and protect item to teleport out or you can suicide on something nearby. You don't even risk a spade. No clue box needed.

There are two different crowds of people who played the game at different times. Some people simply weren't old enough and started playing WoW in TBC or Wrath, and have nostalgia for those xpacs. WoW certainly had more subs during those xpacs, but i'm not sure I'd call them the "golden age" if we are talking about the health of the game. TBC added the Outland, which completely killed the liveliness of old Azeroth. When the xpac released it was lively in the Outland, but once everyone had flying mounts, you never saw people anymore. They simply flew directly to their destination, which killed world PVP and community feel. No one farmed old raids anymore because greens from TBC were better than pretty much all purple gear from vanilla except Naxx items, and few people cleared Naxx to begin with because it took a lot of resources to get all the resistance gear required, and even then TBC launched only a few months after Naxx did. Most guilds who were struggling with Naxx completely threw in the towel when TBC launched, and moved on. WotLK added dungeon finder, which players similarly complain about for killing the community feel of their servers. Also, a lot of people quit WoW towards the end of WotLK before Catacalysm due to complaints about the raiding system. I'm not saying there NO demand for TBC and WotLK, there certainly is. I know some people want to go and kill Illidan Kael'thas, or Arthas in their respective raids, and that class balance is better in TBC or WotLK than in Vanilla. But by many metrics, these xpacs added content that was detrimental to the health of WoW as a whole.
---
You are probably right that most of the content will be cleared in hours of release but only by top hardcore guilds. It will take a substantial amount of time before more casual guilds can clear the content, and it will take a long time for even the top guilds to get their raid roster fully geared with full Naxx tier 3 equipment. 
---
This all being said, if they keep all the server options available, meaning you can choose to stay on vanilla instead of moving to TBC or WotLK, I think that would be the best option. I know you can't read tone on the internet, so I want to be clear I'm not trying to flame you or anything, just wanted to discuss some reasons why some players prefer vanilla to TBC and beyond.
---
I remember training on this back in the day before osrs and before EOC
---
So it would be like 150k exp an hour, and generate 7m an hour. I think 7 mill an hour at 91 is too much so they‚Äôd have to change it to 92 giving 1 nat and a chance at two to nerf that money to a more stable and fair amount. But 151k exp an hour for runecrafting seems highly reasonable and on par with other skills. Especially since it would still not be even semi afk since your still focusing to click the bank and do withdraws and pouches and stuff. 
---
Fucking make a hard as fuck rfd 2 time traveling quest where you go back in and stop someone from ruining what you‚Äôve done. And make this a reward behind it and require like 77 during the quest. 
---
Seems fair to me!

---
Gotta lay off that red berry pie.
---
I don't know about this, Blizzard is going to great lengths to have the game be as close to the original experience as possible including manually implementing old bugs and things like that. MTX character boosts, mounts, race changes etc would go very against the principles of the game. They already have Retail WoW which makes a lot more money than RS3 does in MTX
---
That was the first thing I did! Great looking out though friend
---
Hey guys. I pop in every couple of months to ask the same question.  
---
A year ago I was permabanned for "Real World Trading Goldfarmer", when I was just goldswapping \~11m RS3 gold to OSRS (which was \~3m 2007 gold at the time) using the biggest gold swapping service clan in the game. No, I wasn't selling gold, and yes this was my first and only 'offence'. Yes, in hindsight, that 3m wasn't worth it. I was just trying to take advantage of the twitch promotions and ended up losing my account because of it. No I have no intentions of starting over.  
---
So the question:   
---
Has there been any update to being able to appeal false unappealable permabans, or is it still just getting lucky on twitter?
---
So u support somebody playing 19 hours a day for a month?
---
You are doing something very, very wrong. I had the same range &amp; prayer and worse defense &amp; gear and was doing ~1:30 PB kills and consistent &lt;2 min kills with 3-4 kills per trip.
---
2.
---
What does somebody need a herring for?
---
I really lile DKs, had similar stats to yours when I tried em for the first time. 
---
Vork if DS2 is done, Zulrah, Gargoyles - trio and duo GWD is definitely possible. Wildy bosses can be fun (I personally like Scorpia because its so easy evwn though the drops are meh and its risky heh)
---
It's destroying pvp in a huge way. Opponent freeze timer, one way safe spots, spell book configuration, spell icon enlargement, overhead indicator based on opponents wielded weapon just to name a few. Every single one of these are game breaking and continue to ruin pvp.

Swampletics passively got 37 hunter over the course of thousands of hours, this guy can only get base 37 stats in the same time..  lamps require exp gain, he can‚Äôt just log in and walk around and wait for lamps so what happens when he has base 2 stats and still needs 8 more for a level?  He‚Äôd be lucky if he got 1 in the 2000 exp or so needed for base 2 let alone 9.

What level was this account? I know you said you don't want to start over but if you were kinda low there are tons of guides on how to power level an account. Also maybe consider iron man? Would give you a whole new experience of the game

Well that is an official Jagex subdomain.....

A fuckton of runescape related databases have just been sold on the black market. They're mostly RSPS related, although there are a few well known clan forums in there as well.

People on twitter seem to think that [this](https://twitter.com/JagexWolf/status/1162850939159625728) is a teaser for it.

I can't share the link directly on here, so I shared it in the description of the image.

Just click on the image's link and scroll a bit down.

Didnt Wolf say that he doesnt continue on that idea because people didnt liked how he wanted to make the quest reward an upgraded neitz helm with +5 str right after they nerfed serp helm without a poll  from +5 to +3?
---
Is there anyway for Jagex to stop their email from being spoofed?
---
That was quite the visual in the end there.
---
Because then you could get 1-99 RC in one click for 5M at current prices.
---
Yeah definitely. 
---
Like someone else already mentioned. E-mails are notoriously unsafe. You can easily edit the FROM field in the email to make it seem it comes from really anywhere. 
---
It's always safe just to go to the actual website and check yourself.
---
Maybe can take their adverts off YouTube tho

It needs a boss mini game where you collect a resource, process it, then use it to kill a boss /s

I second this. When grinding the KQ head for desert elite with max cb stats and near max gear I got 2-3 kills per trip on average with a max of 5.
---
Damn. Thanks for the response though.

All skills were over 75 iirc. Combat 110-112. Before Dragon Slayer 2 I had my quest cape. Had an elite diary or two completed.

Im a nursing student and full time EMT, I just dont have that kind of time to bring a new account back up to par with my old one anymore. But I miss this game a lot, and I guess Im just holding out for hope that one day Ill get my account back.

I just logged in and all my sheep are there. What does the quest log say

I just logged in and they were there. What does your quest log say

y tho
---
Lol nobody‚Äôs happy spending 19 hours a day on RuneScape
---
I love-hate it. It is a much nicer and easier method, but I hate how good it is. I'd still prefer to do traditional RC, but it is really not worth the effort after Kourend Elites; Astrals are like 8K less exp per hour for like 500K~ more profit per hour. When you start to get into Nats and especially Wraths it starts to be a better tradeoff.

There's certainly something going on. A lot of people have tweeted about receiving unsolicited password reset emails in the last 24h.
---
My guess is that someone has a list of email addresses, and is doing password resets with them to find out which of them are Runescape login names.
---
As long as your PC &amp; email account(s) are secure, you use strong passwords, and you have Authenticator set up your Runescape account should be secure.

If you flinch you can get upwards of 10-15 kills per trip, but it's probably slower than killing the normal way.

This is probably the only "nuscape" thing I'd like. Would be a tiny bit busted for decanting, but I think the feeling of more players overrides that. This game needs more of its "mmo spirit" back

That's because essence is actually really big but runes are tiny. You slot the essence into a hole on the altar and it dispenses the runes for you.

That's why at later levels you can get multiple runes per essence, you just become better at shaking the vending machine.

Another similar update: talking to the ranged tutor in Lumbridge allows you to toggle whenever you pick up arrows that you already have equipped, they will go to the ammo slot directly (or into your blowpipe) instead of being placed in your inventory. Magic tutor will bring runes directly into your rune pouch.

Using oak planks it's about 21m to get to 83 (including the cost of using a demon butler the entire time). Mahoganies aren't necessary. It's already really fast.

35m is pretty accurate for an 83 house. Maybe 40m or so.

---
Kq is top 5 maybe even top 3 of least fun bosses in the game. Ahead of her time definitely not. Many bosses have phases, idk where you get hydra being the only one? gargolye boss, zulrah, Olm, Multiple bosses in ToB, veiton, the list goes on. And just because the boss has a prayer icon over its head doesnt make it unique, this same mechanic exists on many bosses, but they just dont show a prayer, instead you're forced to use a different attack style.
---
The boss has no mechanics. you literally just put on protect from mage and race it.
---
What @Bludgeond said. Prif has better exp rates than Ardy and a higher pet chance. (We don't know how much by yet). The question you should answer is do you need marks of grace or crystal shards.

75 attack, 70/75 defence, 77 prayer, easy.
---
put the text you want italicized between asterisks
---
Mod Ash has talked about wanting to create a lobby screen similar to RS3‚Äôs; this would be an ideal place for polling I think.
---
now officially the best hcim ever. will be definite when he maxes and finishes tob with the defender
---
I was 99 str 92 att and 95 def at the time
---
Yes you are right I should have mentioned that. Classic and to some extent TBC had leveling as a large part of the game.
---
You don't have to have your house in relleka, just use scrolls of redirection
---
You got me hyped with Koured Elites + Blood RC and then I saw the 
---
slayer requierement.
---
Wowzers someone got upset. I apologise for whatever I said that offended you so badly.
---
I'm 94 cb, so you have at LEAST 6cb worth of stats on me. With that said, I'm still able to tank ALL brothers in the tunnels.
---
If you have  at least 70def, the barrows brothers are all bitches.
---
Dharok can only max a 64 on 1hp which is fairly easy to tank. If you had a platebody platelegs swap, you wouldn't even dream of bringing pots to barrows. Their max magic rolls are all like 100 or lower, so you can still hit in full plate while they hot 0s all day.
---
Karil is the same story as dh even though he's slightly more accurate.
---
I'm saying there's no reason for pots if you have a house with an altar. Spec pool isn't even a hard req. ie there's no reason for pray restore unless you're homeless and have no altar. Even then, lumbridge tabs are better than pray pots.
---
I still average 3-4 runs without banking with these methods.
---
tl;dr stop bringing pots; bring a tank swap instead and extra food of you're really that concerned.
---
Yes it is possible with some third party client overlays to trigger bot detection it comes down to what plugins you were using.
---
His goal was to max
---
6/7 at TOB and the only item he doesn't have is literally 4x more common than any other unique. That's fucking wild.
---
Dent head
---
Stellar Dawn Easter egg.
---
This. Effecient raids 1 is all about time so you wont be close but base 75 stats party could do deathless chambers if they were good enough.
---
Which makes no sense because I‚Äôm using the correct login, last 2 passwords, correct membership billing info, and some other info it asks for but it doesn‚Äôt work. In additional info I‚Äôm also telling them what I did yesterday and transactions IDs for memberships.
---
I was literally playing this morning and then an hour later I lost access
---
This should be part of the  April fools event where everyone plying with a moth 2h on f2p worlds gets this huge 2h with a max hit of an r2h, but the accuracy of a moth 2h. Please upvote if you agree so a jagex mod can see this. Thanks :)
---
Same way you can see which tiles to click on for the bog in temple trekking. Those squares have different ID‚Äôs than the other squares which makes it pretty easy for the client
---
Yes a very good one hiding behind a tree but it‚Äôs very slow, look it up
---
Had an email on an account I had completely forgot about lol...
---
You didn't get hacked. You got phished and gave your account info away.
---
Where u get this info from üòÇ out here just making stuff up
---
Congrats how did you not get pk‚Äôd in 500 kills and if u did what do u do to get stuff back?
---
*Watchmojo wants to know your location*
---
It'll make ge tele too close to a bank.
---
yeh i was happy with 1 piece after 9 but then went dry to 70 odd b4 2nd
---
Nice.
---
Scythe before defender. What a world
---
Use KQ pet phase 1 and you'll never need to find a spot for your pet. It can't be stood on.
---
Then it‚Äôd stay the same except those weirdo skilling nerds with 50 Rc.
---
That is a lot of time. flinching is so slow.
---
dealing with scammers + people who want to take advantage of you. playing rs 2004-2006 with all the scams rampant made my BS detector much more sensitive. 
---
setting goals for the long term, figuring out how to achieve them, and then sticking to them. 
---
managing money in general. now i'm self employed + i think playing runescape at a young age helped me understand that money can be made in ways that aren't 'show up some place + wait 2 weeks for your paycheque'
---
ive had it happen to me for using the old OSHD client registering as a perm ban same goes for older runelite plugin that smoothed graphics anything that alters the ingame models can trigger the bot detection
---
Guy tried grappling the dragon with disadvantage. Rolled 3 nat 1‚Äôs in a row.
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound anything like a ddos üòÇ
---
it‚Äôs disc because frisbee is a brand name of discs
---
This won't fix the wild, people are already going in with welfare gear (or naked). They aren't afraid to lose their items they're afraid to lose time, the problem is efficiencyscape not the death mechanic.
---
Reinstating the old death mechanic is a bad idea anyway, punishing players by making them lose tens (if not hundreds) of hours of grinding on death is horrible game design. It would fuck the economy pretty hard, the 3 BiS items for every combat style would go up in price and everything not kept on death would crash.  
---
I'm also fairly sure most ironmen would quit the game.
---
Someone's done western province hard diaries.
---
The wilderness altar wasn‚Äôt added for better prayer xp
---
Why did i watch it all as if i didnt know what to expect
---
Calling bullshit on that 1 smoothing animations plug-in is still on runelite today used by many definitely won‚Äôt get you banned
---
The main question is which one is more brain dead. And what has better Netflix retention rates?
---
cause i can't get much wronger
---
Never. Dh almost never hits through plate and 70def and when he does, his max is only 24 to 64. Karil is the same, but he hits a little more often. Either shouldn't take up more than 2-3 sharks if that.
---
You can wear full plate and still hit with mage at barrows bc their mage def is super low.
---
Every week is a rollercoaster with those gains
---
Lol getting married in 2019 if you think that your wife must be a seamonster
---
People that think getting a fighter torso is bad never did a real grind. Change my mind.
---
Great accusation but I‚Äôve never clicked on any links in emails or entered my account info anywhere but the RuneScape website that I went to directly.
---
I used to be an IT specialist so I‚Äôm not that stupid
---
I think another solution would be changing the grand exchange teleport to being more than just south of the ge. If it allowed a bigger radius or a random 1-4 for each cardinal direction then people would be spread better.
---
Nothing insane.
---
to make surstromming as a weapon
---
go back to lumbridge you goblin boi where you belong with the rest of them, and dont ever enter our wilderness.
---
Could I do a range tank with 60 att 99 str 70 def 75 prayer 99 range 99 mage
---
Mid 2012 MBP here, run two clients simultaneously for alting raids and usually both over 40fps, dunno what you dudes are doing to your laptops but my guess is you gotta stop nutting on your keyboards.
---
you could go 50 att 99 str and not gain any combat levels
---
But also completely true.
---
Jagex won't do anything since every is obsessed with their personal training wheel clients these days. They had the possibility to restrict these clients ages ago, doubt they'll do anything.
---
ok, but can we get the sparkles on the seercull at least?
---
ok so at least everyone has to use it
---
Tah, some clients take it too far. Though while I am not a big fan of lot of what third party clients do, I don't think they should all be banned because of a few crossing big lines. Still, there needs to be a clearer limit one what is and isn't allowed.
---
Before RuneLite, one of my concerns was that since the lines were so vague, how could someone make a new client to compete with ones like OSBuddy without accidentally crossing lines and getting banned? Then RuneLite happened which kinda disproved that argument, but I think the uncertainty on the lines is still problematic even if not for that reason.
---
This is crass
---
I lold, only thing worse than this shit review is the shit player writing it who cant differentiate between an attack that has three green spikes instead of one.
---
Happens all the time. You cant antiscam the scammer lol
---
How about you watch a guide before entering the room you fuckin goofball
---
Engine work
---
Haha i wonder what made that poor soul try to buy a herring for 1m
---
Under effort I meant his literal content, he is an absolutely top tier pker and often risks more money than most people have in their banks, sometimes more than a bil. If that isn't content then I don't know what is.
---
Thank you for believing me. I appealed the ban and I hope it will work. I'm sorry about your account
---
I'm ftp and don't play the game. I have 1 maple shortbow.
---
you are wrong, and you have added nothing to the discussion.
---
Good quit. Stop bitching about a game being hard or not good enough. Bye.
---
No
---
Your shits as good as gone, can‚Äôt do anything about it. We‚Äôve all been scammed before it‚Äôs a right of passage. A few days at zalcano oughta get you back on track.
---
I wouldn't call that a solution to what is clearly a problem
---
Probably the exact same way that somebody offered Swampletics a plugin for Temple Trekking
---
Same, all these people openly displaying their cheat usage deserve at least the 3-day warning ban. It would send a message to the community at the very least.
---
Okay but why do you want people who dont care or understand to vote? That's what i dont understand about what you're saying. You're acting like there are people who care and have some understanding about the game who would like to vote but the taking 30 seconds at most to go to a poll booth and vote is too much for them or too difficult to understand when it's literally in tutorial island. What do you think this will achieve? did you not like the recent poll results and think that it would have gone in your favour if everyone was forced to vote?
---
Same or similar pass as your email? No 2FA on email?
---
But they aren't just overlays; they are looked at hidden information. They may be able to change that on their end, but they can disallowed certain plugins or features without banning all clients.
---
That's how long I've been on ya.
---
Gods save the queen
---
Did you click on a link he set you? How did he get your ip?
---
I do this with cerb +scythe. Gives you like 20-25 kill trips.
---
They have to differentiate the tiles like, tile with an attribute that damages you is literally a different tile to the tile that doesn't damage you, so it has a different ID.
---
The client has access to all these I'd and can serve them to the player.  
---
I was about to say after that someone writes a plug in for the boss, but not even, just to highlight that specific tile I'd.
---
Except that voting is to get the opinion of many, not whether the results will be influenced by your vote. Which, you know, wont happen for sure if you don't vote
---
If this is a real dilemma then you should just go do the quests and stuff now, imo. I'm currently at 80FM at 'todt on a fresh ironman, but as soon as I get to that point I'm just going to dip out and start doing the stuff I actually wanna do. I left my main because it became an efficiency simulator where I felt bad making "wrong" decisions, and I'm personally going to do my best to avoid reaching that feeling on my iron as well.
---
The Wintertodt/Fishing/Agility starts are efficient, but you should use them as a jumpstart to get you into the parts of the game you're excited about doing, not just because they're the most efficient way to start. Granted, maybe the grind is what you enjoy in which case you should continue, but based on what you said it doesn't seem that way.
---
I would feel it should be put to a month to month basis. Have 6-7 group ironmen in the mode, this would include old ironmen accounts as well, having the ability to create groups and enlist people. Make the groups into a clan type deal, but you cannot leave the group for a month without a bond (kind of how RSN changes work.) I would also recommend a type of history look-up, where you can view how much that person has played (kinda like a more advanced Han‚Äôs. This would require a lot of dev work though, so not completely necessary) Within the group, players can vote to remove other players, who may have become inactive, or are just annoying/dead-weight. Once removed, you can opt to find another. This would have be a 3/4ths vote, and a right click over ones name would give an option to ‚Äúvote to kick from group.‚Äù There are many other suggestions, but I think this would be the only way for a group Ironman setting to work. 
---
If you had to be assigned a group right after tutorial island, I do believe that group would be dead within a month or two. Not many people can play Ironman. A lot of people start, and within a week quit because it‚Äôs not as easy.
---
You can report him in game and/or send the evidence to tipoff@jagex.com but you won't get your items back.
---
Yeah like i could buy an arma cb and use dragon ruby bolts and dragon diamond bolts which would definitely be an advantage over the the adamantite versions with a rcb.
---
and yeah ill definitely try to figure out the mechanics well first before hopping straight in!
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Is that a mithril 3h sword or you just happy to see me?
---
Yes.
---
When a player doesnt understand that its them not the mechanics that are shit lol
---
Ok cool thanks! Did you use ruby and diamond bolts? Or is there a different meta now?
---
you sound like you have issues which only you can fix ü§î
---
its possible but you can also manipulate the ge tracker price once you hit the buy limit. Buy ge limit worth of elys, put sell offer in for 2b, buy your own ely for 2b and it will fuck up the prices.
---
This is probably the silliest Seercull buff I've seen. It is like saying buff the D Long by feeding it other Longswords... Longbows don't need a sink; they'd need their own buff if anything.
---
i'd probably suggest not whining like a little baby and being garbage at the game lol
---
How about 4 corners
---
Totally different password and not used on any other accounts, I have an Authenticator on my account as well
---
They can't detect everything, anyone with even the slightest java experience can write a plugin.  
---
I could write something right now and I highly doubt Jagex would be able to detect my personal code that is used only by me.
---
Did you have to pay for internet? I think I noticed they offered this on my last trans-atlantic but it was like $14 per hour and I can barely afford $11 a month so had to be a no from me :(
---
Ranged if low herblore (70s), Super Combat if high herblore (97+)
---
the opposite of afk lol, but the best method in the thread for non afk
---
Sorry, I like to pay zero attention when it comes to mining :/
---
Yeah man I‚Äôm not super worried about it, I‚Äôll make it back eventually. I‚Äôm more looking for these dudes to get banned or some sort of repurchasing, he literally sent me screenshots of so much peoples shit he‚Äôs taken. He just sells the gp he makes off it.
---
That‚Äôs what I was looking for, I‚Äôll do that thank you.
---
you're kinda shit at this game eh?
---
Make godswords 3h too!
---
Exactly
---
Why would anyone want to play wow lol
---
Would it be an effective build for pking and doing raids/ bossing
---
It would be nice if voting on the website was an option.  Like when you click on the poll broadcast it pulls up a web page like it does for the update broadcasts
---
Theyre saying about reworking the mechanics, but the thing is one of the big things they want to leave is being able to suicide supps
---
They want to turn dieing into a sort of gold sink. Nobody thinks you should loose 100s of hours of progress because you dc'd(let's be real this is a majority of deaths).
---
However, it's also bad to have 0 punishment for dieing.
---
Imagine not even knowing magic log sparkles are stars
---
Definitely not ashamed
---
Just out of curiosity are you using one of these training wheels client?
---
Wow nice a trash video of dead crabs
---
Would change the camera so your character is facing true south, east, or west the same way clicking it currently makes your character face true north
---
Do you happen to know those things he listed?
---
Dat cat tho
---
Those are easier to fake than this screen tho
---
You're right, I overlooked the 10% increase as 100%, silly me.
---
::bank
---
Yeah I mean he can't even afford full rune lol
---
I'm pretty sure Jagex cannot tell what client you're on or if you add extra plugins to runelite.
---
&gt; Except that voting is to get the opinion of many, not whether the results will be influenced by your vote
---
That's exactly my point. So that's why I'm not wasting ticks clicking no on everything, sometimes 20+ times in a row. If at least there was a "vote no - all" option, maybe, but still have to run to a booth.
---
Doing this grind on an alt right now, 1-75 at Ammonite/Sand crabs. 
---
Level 1-5: Iron Darts/Fury&gt;Glory/Combat Bracelet/L1 ranged armour set (optional). Off hands only give accuracy, so optional at crabs.
---
Level 5-20: Steel Darts
---
Level 20-30: Mithril Darts/L20 ranged armour set (optional)/L30 Ava's
---
Level 30-40: Snakeskin armour set
---
Level 40-50: Green D'hide set (replace Combat Bracelet with vambs from now on)
---
Level 50-60: Blue D'hide set/L50 Ava's
---
Level 60-70/75: Red -&gt; Black/Blessed D'hide set/Barrow's gloves (if you've quested)/Blowpipe
---
XP rates in descending order: MSB + Rune Arrows &gt; RCB + Broad Bolts &gt; Mithril Darts. XP rates are not much better across the 3, so I'd recommend using mith darts all the way to save GP.
---
Oh god I hope this dont make front page. There will be so many of these running around.
---
Locked behind a runecraft boss that requires 90 RC and 10k blood runes per attempt
---
Ahead of its time, yes. Best boss, not even close. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hard to do, or the mechanics are hard to learn, just pray mage the whole time and switch combat style when she changes phases it‚Äôs that easy. She just hits hard so you have to have high stats and eat when you‚Äôre low hp. It‚Äôs pretty boring to be fair. Theres no need for switching, no movement involved, no prayer switching, etc. It‚Äôs a classic most definitely but to say it‚Äôs better than Zulrah or vorkath is more than a stretch.
---
It makes it significantly easier though.
---
Bow x6, then unequipped and kick, then bow x6 again. Means you only need 1 good weapon
---
Holy shit that is one giant seven year old
---
Absolutely sick!
---
1h the 2h. Or give us the bowsword
---
Why bully
---
Thanks for your suggestions, based on the results I made a top five video on real life skills you learned from playing:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cs2gqt/top\_5\_real\_life\_skills\_you\_learned\_from\_playing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cs2gqt/top_5_real_life_skills_you_learned_from_playing/)
---
This is correct. Case and point without an ultimatum there‚Äôs fuck all they can do.
---
If I get the account back I‚Äôll have to give that a try.
---
Really cool idea
---
One Tile Per Episode Ironman when?
---
If this happens , make sure the dialogue chat is with bank teller is only in all caps to make them ‚Äúyelling‚Äù
---
It doesnt make it easier, it makes it faster. The 1 weapon strat is significantly harder.
---
But the original poll for osrs outlined weekly updates
---
I really don't get how people thought osrs would stay unchanged, the creation poll literally stated that it would continue to be updated
---
ohh right, the GPU plug in, Skybox, much better map, every log that is on the side(farming loot tracker ge hiscores and so on) Ground items+ they show number of the same items not 1 thing 100 times. and 100 more things.
---
yeah, that seems like an easy quit and hoping to see client come back.
---
Lmao how's it gonna be good for the games health when the playerbase drops to 10% of what it used to be.
---
How do I access my collection log?
---
Only in Al-Kharid though.

[Suggestion] dont give suggestions until you understand why the state of the game is the way it is, a lot of stuff like this is intended to stop "abuses" or lazy code writing that's hard to undo at this point
---
Lmao üñ§
---
I disagree. Idk if you‚Äôre an American but I get world lag and disconnect alllllll the time.
---
I don't think blizzard is the issue
---
It's Activision
---
Good lol. They SHOULD ban all 3rd party client users, AFTER they make their own somewhat competent client 
---
All I really care about is an xp/hr tracker, a skill calculator, and a player looker upper
---
There‚Äôs a hcim who finished tob like 6 months ago
---
Everyone has the right to vote. You still have to register.

---
Guy you linked bitched out and deleted the clip. Any other "non chosen" pov's? or alternate mirror?
---
They are fun! An added bonus is that Zalcano is easily do-able on mobile!
---
I mean suicide supps is literally just summoning a yak at this point.
---
Technically the only pool you need is the first one (65 req) for spec restore, but the next tier up (70 req) also restores run energy which is quite handy as it alleviates the need for carrying your own stamina potions.
---
So yes, 65 is all that's necessary.
---
Would it not make sense for you to have some nice armour or fashionscape? I mean, why does the guy trimming your armour give a f? He‚Äôs got the rune Sara and you look like your a fresh nub. Wouldn‚Äôt he be laughing still?
---
Either this meme is wasted on me or it isn‚Äôt pulling much weight...
---
Making a post on reddit then getting annoyed when everyone doesn‚Äôt share your point of view. That‚Äôs petty.  It IS just a video game. That‚Äôs why this whole post is just a waste of time.

Def will help, but you can do it. You pray prot from mage. He can also use range
---
You can do it!!
---
You've probably fell for the armour trimming twice even after EoC lmao
---
egg\_irl
---
It makes the boas harder mechanically but it makes the whole dungeon easier
---
Gotcha appreciate it . Do you bank after every kill or are you getting multiple kills per trip?
---
None of that proves anything
---
You're wrong... He doesn't need to have 20 xp trackers running... Taking up like half his screen
---
The bane of all dnd campaigns is always arranging everyone's schedule...
---
I mean outside of gold sellers and botting there's nothing that really ruins the game integrity like third party clients and ironmen not being ironmen.
---
I‚Äôll skill most the time in between commutes, during down time, bad traffic, etc. I made all elites my goal so things like smithing, fletching, cooking, fishing, wcing, where you only have to check a min later or so is super nice.
---
Also I don‚Äôt condone driving and playing. Except in bumper to bumper for hours reee
---
how is runelite at more fault than rsbuddy? (osbuddy)
---
Why would people ask each other for their levels
---
Did they finish gwd too though?
---
Bad hud photoshop. Not even gonna watch it
---
Never beaten jad, but don't you have to trade your cape for a chance at the pet?
---
Dont sgs camp then. Get good at pray flicking and going through waves fast without spending 10 min to restore 5 pray points.
---
Learning how to actually complete it instead of cheesing it standing behind a pillar with justiciar and sgs makes it a lot more fun.
---
He literally said it was a 6 year old account before deleting this post lol.
---
I don't think the cost of a buyable skill being high makes it not a buyable? Anyway, ToB is more than 3ml/hour.
---
There's nothing hard besides the boss. Idk why you even argue with something you've never even tried, as your previous comment proves.
---
Its not 6+kick. And you still need a staff for the strat. Its 5 bow, kick, 5 bow, staff. The 1 t3 weapon strat is harder. Period.
---
Im doing that grind now - Id say Im a bit over halfway there from qpc and its fun :) a nice goal to strove for and you get a well rounded account in the process! As a side goal Ill have base 86 when I finish it.
---
I just think you‚Äôre being dramatic with your examples haha
---
explain
---
I don't really agree with the clients, but after watching some vods of tob runs, the time difference still seems not as great as you make it out to be. A good portion of the people I found using them are already running tob at max efficiency and only 3 minutes below my average for a pretty relaxed raid. I also haven't wiped at sote in quite a few hundred kc; it really isn't that hard. I'm also doubtful of any bans coming to those using the clients, as most of the tob features can be found at other bosses on other clients.
---
Upvote for visibility
---
Not spoofed. Clicking the link takes you to the legit site and secured. So it‚Äôs harmless. As a harmful link would take you to the same page unsecured. Someone is just finding accounts with the email as the username.
---
There goes 1$ USD. Sorry bro everything will be alright
---
great vid.
---
I really don't think 10% of the player base are using these types of clients. If they are and they're willing to give up years of progress on their account because they can't use an overpowered client anymore I think that's a good thing. Just my opinion but players actively seeking clients that have plug-ins which jagex disallows should be punished in the first place. Jagex told runelite and osbuddy to not add any inferno and tob plug-ins yet these other cheat clients are making those plug-ins and adding ones that were removed by jagex request like projectile indicators.
---
I did it at 75 def and 76 ranged.
---
Also saw someone do it with 67 ranged.
---
Honestly, some of its rng based. You're going to get hit regardless. Just stock up on best gear you can and go for it.
---
If I was to put down some stats for a recommended level I'd say (aside from prerequisites):
---
70 ranged
---
70 def
---
70 mage (higher magic def)
---
Just go for it dude, quest is hard for sure, but stay calm, get your clicks right and you'll be fine.
---
You are meming right?
---
Juat make it so some bankers stand outside. Position 3 or 4 around the GE and people will congregate to one of five spots. Top left freestanding banker would be for people using fairy rings. Bottom-most would be for people getting in and out fast. The center ring that's there now would still be there for anyone unfamiliar with freestanding bankers or just people who happened to be looking at something else and got close to the GE from the minimap. The current bank is still an easy click without having to even scan the crowd for a freestanding banker.
---
This. Only give me the option to attack someone who has attacked me. Proper fight back mechanics that enables fights for players.
---
My god, a 100% increase would be ridiculous. But yah, it certainly help but isn't the craziest thing. For example, in the above comparison, without the Elite it drops 1M exp worth of Bloods from 25 Hours and 15M to 25 Hour and 13.75M; so 1.25M less.
---
xp waste
---
Thanks for all the offers to help! I really appreciate it. I ended up finding a gracious house party host who took time off from keeping his incense burners lit to help me out.
---
Having a minimized drop down button that brings you to polling from the main screen is shoving it down your throat?
---
Agreed. Skull tricking is an attempt to deceive someone into skulking. Ie a scam.
---
Episode 1000 is a celebratory double episode
---
Long boi
---
Why would you use pouches after 77 RC tho?
---
Kill tricking should be removed. It‚Äôs an attempt to deceive someone which is scamming m.

I wouldn't know about that, election turn-out in my country has always been +90% for general elections.

Realistically only the first half of the votes have more weight to them. They took away our ability to see this to encourage voting near the end of the poll, but it's still there.

It depends on what the client does. For example, OSRS HD showed up as a bot client as opposed to other clients.  So there may be some ways to distinguish even if it isn't a ton. But like I said, even if they cannot tell which is connecting to the game, being silent on what is and isn't okay isn't helping. If they say X isn't allowed and you will be ban if caught using it, it will get players, at the very least streamers, to stop using X.

I mean I'm of the opinion that Jagex should be held accountable for usability changes instead of resorting to falling back to unofficial fixes (like 3rd party clients) but hey maybe that's just me.
---
Shut the fuck up.  Just downvote him
---
FASTER
---
&gt; So having multiple very tough bosses is a bad idea. One might be OK.
---
I wouldn't say that; there is no reason Wilderness bosses can't put up a decent challenge or that it should be limited to one. And it is not like you need that much risk to kill any of the bosses as they are; changing Vet'ion to have a better second phase wouldn't mean it is tougher either.
---
If you didn't make it yourself the answer to your question is almost always yes especially if it has so much JPG compression.
---
Yeah because the original client is so ass it doesn't even include support for hardware acceleration.
---
no ge=more scammers= credit card debacle of 2007 that killed the game in the first place

That thing was too big to be called a sword.

Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of mithril.

What kind of novice plays a fire mage while leveling?

runescape classic was shut down because nobody played it apart from botters, when you play a game to its utter completition you have nothing to do anymore you get bored and move on there's 0 reason to bring it back if within a few years people just quit becasue they're sick of killing x mob for months
---
Stay 60 attsck. Get 75 def, 77 prayer way more op and lower cb
---
Play a private server, it‚Äôs a waste of the teams time to develop and maintain a server where next to nobody will play
---
Can't say I agree there. While I do think third-party clients that can add whatever they want with minimum supervision doesn't mix well with a game where even the smaller QoL is polled, I don't think clients should be banned outright. The majority of features they add are fine and there are only some smaller features, and methods, that should be banned at this point.
---
I'm always amused when people ask this. 
---
If there are literally any bots then that must mean Jagex just gave up.
---
I don't know who is complaining, but I only ever hear about people complain that people are voting No. I don't think i've ever seen anyone complain about people voting Yes.
---
437
---
And they know that, no one is saying this, they're saying everything but RuneLite and OSbuddy would be not allowed.
---
Just make it 3x3 bankers not 2x2, makes it alittle bigger and would make the ge feel more full
---
Okay.
---
Lavas if you want fast xp. Couldn't personally do it for long but it feels nice to get xp rates that much higher for a short time once in a while
---
I mean, they announced the BH Rework before mentioning at RuneFest...Twice. But generally, it is new content not directly teased.
---
They're making new point system to buy stuff. Rune pouches and looting bags will be available in a new system they're updating. I don't pk a lot by any means but I used up gp to buy tier 10 emblems and will be a lot of deaths before I use up all those points. We should be allowed at least ability to convert our points currently to be able to buy pouches and others later on.
---
yeah should i dig a hole or just go into the basement

A new update im guessing

Alt acc or just a whale?

Got mine to 63 by getting 99 fm doing mostly solo wt

does it give you a smithing xp boost?
---
?? Low intensity agility is like 60k/h where are you getting 15k fishing xp/h?
---
So suiciding is basically summoning a yak at this point
---
Jagex has threatened RuneLite with legal action in the past, they could take down any of these clients if they wanted. And they damn well should.
---
Warding is trash
---
Sincerely a non Pker
---
phew, luckily you have nothing to do with game development and both jagex/the playerbase disagrees with your utter nonsense. iron man exists for people like you, do play that along with the rest of the minority instead of trying to kill the game.
---
It could be. I'd imagine the xp/hr for lava runes might go up by quite a bit since you save quite some time on each run and you do many of those an hour
---
and 51 firemaking smh
---
No need to get so hostile about it
---
?
---
It does prove that, but also it could be designed with the popularity of runelite in mind - artists will want their work to look as good as possible. If you're on vanilla, great, it'll load to its max capabilities. If not, great, it'll use your GPU and snazz up the game for you where it can! 
---
This is still a band-aid to a more prominent issue though, the vanilla client is limiting for the player and developers alike and needs a serious overhaul.
---
I'm behind this if it changes the projectiles fired to cats
---
Or he uploads two episodes while receiving the quest xp
---
He alched his pegasians on a charity stream. Now he has to redo the ranger grind.
---
When Jagex makes a decent client I'll start fighting against 3rd party clients.
---
I'm almost 100% sure that can't happen but I've only done 300 corrupted guantlet and havent seen it
---
why do you want warding so badly when the whole point of it is to be a cash and item sink because this economy is fucked? I don't get it.
---
It's good motivation to get skills up, it's max fashionscape when trimmed, it's a good long term goal
---
But there is no way to know if it's a landslide or not. So it'd be like a Schrodinger's vote.
---
But that still does not change the fact that your vote, cast quickly or towards the end of the voting period has the same weight as any other vote.
---
The time you put your vote in does not matter one bit. The vote is counted when it's over. Any measurement made in between is arbitrary.
---
This is v funny
---
This is like one of those moments when you'd be around your pals, say this and they'd all assume you were joking and attempt to laugh along........ Until the awkwardness sets in. 
---
The awkwardness, that's warding.
---
H
---
If the point system changes where you no longer need them to get the pouch or bag, then just blow all of your remaining points on items you can sell back to the ge. I believe there is a video on youtube that explains the approximate price in gp for a looting bag and rune pouch buy getting items from the bh shop for a similar point value and reselling at ge to find that approximate cost in gp

They wouldn't need to buy it out, it's open source and free to fork.
---
Where to find her after quest?
---
Well, it's really because of her character's backstory. I'll copy/paste it below.
---
 "Risca was born in a village near a large  city, to a family of carp fishermen. Her family, and most of the  village, provided the produce and food to the nearby city in exchange  for a rather thriving economy. She was raised alongside her three  brothers and each of them were taught not only how to fish, make fires,  and survive - but also the basics of swordplay. 
---
When  she was old enough, Risca joined up with the local militia to protect  the town. That same year, a flock of albino wyverns descended on their  village and decimated it, stealing cattle, razing farms with ice, and  carrying villagers away into the mountains. 
---
To  rescue their kidnapped brethren, Risca led the most able bodied  fighters to finish the fight. In a cavern high in the mountains, her  party found that the wyverns had been working under the orders of a  young white dragon and upon entering its lair, a huge battle ensued.  Risca and her brother, side by side, fought against the dragon. They  brought it to death‚Äôs door, to the edge of the cliff where its lair met  the steep incline of the mountain.
---
Her  brother was badly wounded, most of the militia were killed, the wyverns  were circling them. Blinded by a just and selfless rage, Risca took a  running stab at the dragon, piercing it through the heart and pushing it  over the edge of the cliff.
---
In its  death throes, the dragon clawed at her arms and face, clinging to her,  and pulling her over the edge with it, as it fell to its death 1,000  feet below. 
---
The people of the town  mourned. They spent days digging Risca‚Äôs body out of the rubble, and  wrapped in a death shroud sewn with white dragon‚Äôs scales, they carried  her all the way to the large neighbouring city - where they spent nearly  all of the village‚Äôs savings to bring her back to life at the Shrine of  Bahamut. She was resurrected, with massive scarring on her face and  body, and the village praised her as Risca the Dragon-Felled. 
---
After  helping the town rebuild, Risca felt isolated, still suffering from the  effects and trauma of what had happened, she said goodbye to her family  and left to find her own future and heal in her own way."
---
\----------
---
Most recently, they have been struggling to contain the major threat of the campaign -- the resurgence of Zaros. One such thing the antagonist of this cult did to facilitate this resurgence (which btw is Straven from Shield of Arrav quest, haha) is resurrect that same white dragon into a dracolich. As such, the dracolich sent more Wyverns to Withcaven to get revenge and continue pillaging/gathering resources. This is what prompted/clued the player to return to the dragon's previous home.
---
Yesterday, in our session, the party successfully managed to slay the dracolich (barely) atop Trollweiss mountain.
---
this area looks very good

Yeah because everyone is maxed and has 1 bil lying around.

---
I guess but it's been a part of the game for so long most people stopped looking at it as a bug. Kinda like tick manipulation. Its helpful for the game as a whole so they started treating it as a feature just so the game actually has a skill gap
---
Pre eoc graphics before they ruined barrows etc was always best for me. The graphics on osrs are too blocky, that time period was a nice in between.
---
There are vids about it. Its north of lands end, near the west coast of zeah. Hill giants
---
I apologise, I'm 110 combat with 85 def btw, with my method I do about 16+ runs without banking, 1 dose of restore is like 2.2k so I'm not fussed. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
50k an hour compared to 40k or less at yanille
---
at the very least they should make it so if you buy stuff on the ge the money comes straight out of your bank if you have none in inventory. like how when you die at a boss and you pay to unlock your gear you dont actually need money in your bag. it's just an inconvenience.
---
They went balls to the wall trying to take legal action and shut down runelite some time ago because they were unhappy with how far some plugins went. Runelite worked with them and removed it. Now these new cheat clients are running rampant with shit like this and they haven't said a word. Disappointing. U/Jagexweath any thoughts?
---
I did at 107 and had no trouble. At least 100 Id say to do it comfortably. 45 if you are Rendi
---
Starts with the same letter as my current main email, as well as the same amount of characters, and I've always used the exact same username for all 3 or so of my email addresses.

Yes you can

Iirc they just moved dev mode into a more secluded location, would be kinda hard to develop plugins if they completely removed Dev mode
---
It displays the correct path to take while in the barrows tunnels, then it highlights the correct answer once you reach the puzzle door. 
---
People like these kinds of things because when grinding content it can get obnoxious to deal with, but much more pleasurable when you don't. 
---
E.G.
---
Having to constantly keep a count to 3 in your head while killing the hydra boss. You can't listen to a podcast, or anything while doing it without losing count. Its not particularly interesting either since the rest of the boss is very easy. Having a counter over the boss displaying the amount of attacks left before style changing makes hydra much more enjoyable.
---
Jagex be like: sorry, keep trying.
---
My group will continue it 3/5 of the players are there and just catch the ones mising up later or sometimes the dm will have a minisesh and do a miniquest for them
---
Our sessions usually last about 3 hours, so if we didn't start unless everyone is there we'd be getting basically no where lol

There are 125 members worlds that are not deadman worlds. You can use 123 if you are 2200 total, you can use 117 if you are under 2k total, you can use 113 if you are under 1750 total, you can use 109 if you are under 1500 total and 104 under 1250 total. 3 of those members worlds are pvp worlds and 5 are currently beta worlds. So, sub 1250 total and unwilling to risk on pvp worlds leaves you with a grand total of 96 worlds to choose from. I find it highly doubtful that ALL worlds have someone in the spot you want.

"something something engine limitations"

I'd argue that those both sound much different than this plugin. The correct path for the maze is not something you could possibly know without following along with your teammate who was chosen as normal. The other plugins you describe are showing information that you would normally have access to even on the vanilla client. The plugin shown in the OP is much more broken.

Rude and uncalled for. Please check your manners.  Anyways, I don‚Äôt have a phone that can run mobile all day

---
They were unhappy with an open source deobfuscator for their client, in which they legally need to take action for
---
I'll pay more attention to my ping. Not sure how you get 20-30 though! 50 would be the absolutely min that I've ever seen.
---
Yes. This idea is terrible and obviously a joke suggestion. That doesn't somehow make RC not a buyable though.
---
Depends on how much you like or hate some of the skills required to get it. Fishing was a nightmare for me, slayer took a little too long for my liking (i think you can boost it but I didn't know it at the time), and runecrafting was a pleasant surprise once I started doing bloods. I'm on my way to maxing now though it's a little harder to justify getting 99 in some skills considering I have basically everything unlocked already.
---
Im still waiting for the 3a 2h
---
Like 1999 or something like that.
---
So i enabled it and this is when the issues started (i think). I disabled it and i have the same problem.. It's not just a decrease in fps it's like major hitches.

Is it really 3 people with scythe lol?

Woox really turns into smeagol on certain words.

Boss timers? You arent supposed to know when a boss spawns. 
---
They wont update their client because they are lazy, you are right they dont care about game integrity tho. They never have, and they never will.
---
If it's not OC just assume it's been shared and then you won't be a filthy reposter
---
It‚Äôs not my internet. I just watched an entire world go down the other day. Also why would I not wear those when the death mechanics are fine? I‚Äôm perfectly fine with a grave marker where you have to pay 100k or something to get your stuff back, but making it disappear in 2 minutes is just stupid.
---
Users? Not clients? So you want just about every single player banned? Lmao
---
YOU MISSED A THAT OUT DAMMIT
---
Depends on what you‚Äôre doing.
---
You‚Äôre going to wait to range most bosses and if you need to melee maybe like a toxic staff of the dead or elder maul depending on what you‚Äôre doing.
---
This is still in the game and there are even ccs and stuff dedicated while the GE makes many things extremely convenient and less annoying
---
Cheating - act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.  Using a client to gain an advantage you wouldn't have otherwise is the literal definition of cheating.
---
Jagex need to make the official client not hot garbage.
---

Well, it's not something specific to the UIM community. And any boss fight in an instance would become stupid risky if you can't do it without risking a DC and dying without getting your gear back. You sound a little too angry about \~10,000 people enjoying the game differently.  
---
   
---
If it really affected the "integrity" of the game, you would hear way more about it, instead of just the occasional post on a reddit thread that 5% of the actual players in the game read.
---
No he stopped using runeloader because the creator said some sketchy stuff on twitter I think
---
Mine had display names shown for some really old banned accounts so yeah pretty sure they're real.
---
How so?
---
Hey, sorry I'm late. Did you account for the fact that the bludgeon has a special attack, and that the DPS calculator includes that in the overall damage rate? Only asking because I'm looking at this with my own stats/gear put in there, trying to see if it's worth it to move up from the leaf-bladed to the cudgel, but I can't tell if it's still more DPS when you remove the spec max hit from the equation.
---
Run the game into the ground? They do by not letting corrupted 3rd party clients have full autonomy over what they wanna do with plugins? Yeah okay, got you. 
---
&gt; That would be even worse than RS3, which killed the game entirely.
---
I dont see the connection here. The most popular era of the game didnt have stupid 3rd party clients and now a less popular era of the game will die if u took overpowered 3rd party clients away and it would be worse than RS3? Ok lol xD
---
I got an email saying there was a password change request. I have authenticator already and my email should be different from the login email. Will I be okay?
---
I mean I don't think Kurasks should be weak to Crystal; I think Broad Bolts/Arrows are good enough. As for Crystal being more effective in the Dungeon, it wouldn't be the most absurd thing but it really only benefits the bow... Either way, I can't say we need stronger Cannonballs, especially if they'd feel inconsistent with other mechanics.
---
Big Brain!

why is 'dead content' inherently bad?

Cheating - act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.  It's literally in the definition of cheating if you don't think it's cheating you are brain dead.

Hmm you‚Äôre right

Why do I think those skills deserve love or why do I think warding was poorly implemented?
---
That's the beauty of an opinion, my friend. Not everyone has to agree. The great thing is that you can simply not use it.
---
Episode 2277 when?
---
Easy fix then. You have to sacrifice the cat‚Äôs at PETA headquarters. They can even reward you for sacrificing a certain number of cats by selling cosmetics like the white knights do.
---
I think that there is a video called "why old school runescape is the best mmo"
---
It doesn't suck osrs's dick and was made by an ex WoW you tuber. 
---
It has a LOT on what truly separates the osrs feel from other MMOs. It's not exactly what you were looking for but it can mention a few ideas that could help you with research.

Both since I don't agree with either.

---
No offense but you're on of the rudest members of our community (can't say it really bothers me though)
---
Because ground items text tells you "where to click, when to click, and how to click"? Or gpu rendering? Or bank value, bank tags, exp trackers, skybox, examine item prices, exp calculators, etc.? 
---
Not every plugin is like the demonic gorillaz one, you smooth-brained fuck. The official client is severely lacking, and while some RL plugins are total bullshit, there are plenty that should have been added to the official one years ago
---
Barrage lol!
---
You have a funny feeling like you‚Äôre being followed.*
---
I dunno if you noticed but prossy is used instead of mage armor at nechs and dust devils
---
Yeah lets not group all plugins together, you need to distinguish between injections into the client and side tab information. 
---
&gt; The official client is severely lacking
---
The official client isnt lacking at all. Maybe give it an XP tracker, a notepad and make it so you cant exit it without confirmation upon clicking X. A GE lookup is fine as well.
---
You mean verzik was dead and the crabs killed them after, the deaths dont even count
---
Ahh that's what it is I've never got a pet so I wasn't 100% sure. Thank man
---
lmfao, its a fact that most people like 3rd party clients, and its also a fact that most wow users use add ons, but way to resort to ad hominem attacks
---
No, super common drop
---
No problem. Main points of that video I thought you'd like is how the quest system is set up. Real storylines with major events that make the player feel like they're a part of a story. Go kill 12 board ala WoW is terrible in comparison to "go commit regicide against a mad king, plot twist you've been tricked by an insurgent group into killing an innocent king "
---
Second and overall hands down the most important game design philosophy in osrs  
---
progression = time spent osrs
---
Throughout your entire account history, you will be doing things for progression. You see a goal in front of you but then you realize it's under 20 other things you have to get done. Doing those things one by one may take a week, but st the end when you finally complete what you originally set out to accomplish, well damn if that's not a great feeling. 
---
You can see the progression being a core part of the game in the culture of the game as well. Consistent bullying of people who lack fire capes and barrows gloves is a good example. It shows that there is in part a sub-conscious drive from the player base to improve their character and to continue to compete with each other to be/get to be the "the best"
---
I would put a little more cash than that in at once.  You will lose some efficiency if you don't get your favor up every day to 100%, but there's no downside to leaving the coffee to build up.
---
You don‚Äôt think tile id‚Äôs are cheating? Wow
---
Sinbad does not approve...
---
Why do you need screen markers just for hp and all????
---
Can you explain further, what does one do to go into a field like this?
---
That's covered in the video and part of the solution they went with.
---
quite the hugbox this is
---
it's odd to leave easy quests for last, as they're usually requirements for diaries/clues, other than a few odd ones like scorpion catcher
---
F in the chat for this man's future account names I guess.
---
&gt; Okay if they don‚Äôt include boss timers I‚Äôll just use a stop watch?
---
Sounds like a great idea. Or count in your head. Much more difficult than being spoonfed the information. Im glad we can agree.
---
But you won?
---
My girlfriend translated this for me lol. It‚Äôs Portuguese. She said that they said something along the lines of ‚Äúwe are all going to die.‚Äù
---
I assumed you were a reddit baby before I saw any of your comments. When I saw your comments you just proved that.
---
Nice bait tho kappa plox xD swag
---
as far as I can tell you can't do that, you have to do it on the site, so unless you're asking for a whole new poll system through the site (which won't happen) I'm not sure what you're talking about
---
I think op edited his comment, initially said goes effected
---
Why would I discard free gp?
---
Ah okay. I figured but I wasnt sure since u responded to me.
---
Literally huh?
---
Quest cape is a teensy tiny step compared to diary cape. Quest cape is literally worth two elite tasks. But the required skill levels will get you close to completing all hard diaries, which is a nice logical step up from quest cape. That's not even halfway, though. Achievement cape is a long-term goal.
---
You get certifications or a degree in the field
---
My what?
---
Your best options with RuneLite:
---
1. Enable Low Detail plugin. 
---
2. Enable GPU plugin if your MacBook supports it.

3. Set the game to Fixed mode (small window) and then go into your RuneLite plugins, enable "Stretched Mode" and set the settings to 100% and tick all 3 boxes. It should be nearly full screen if you have a 1080p resolution. Combining this with GPU mode fixes the pixelated look.

The other comment about low ping only helps with connection stability. The world switcher plugin can sort worlds by lowest ping. For me the lowest is 17ms. If you're only getting 50, it's because you're wireless and/or your internet sucks where you are.

Mate. The official client can't even run on GPU nor can it resize interfaces on large screens. Other stuff like expanded draw distance is really helpful and a esthetically important so most of the screen on resizable mode isn't black. Shit like ToB plug-ins are bs but 3rd party clients are currently necessary for OSRS to survive, unless jagex incorporates them into their own client, which they've currently said is too large of a project for them.

Thanks for the advice! :)

Or instead of buffs that tie with herblore, the better fire you can light will help burn less food. This could become better than a range and make cooking a bit better at lower levels as well.

no obviously I‚Äôm talking about the fact that you do not have to move your in-game character anywhere you impossibly oblivious cretin

1 no vote = 3 yes votes, I have the power now pkers!

Mod Wolf confirmed it in the replies to this tweet!
---
Ah, that makes sense.
---
Nope, otherwise developing plugins at all would be against the rules. How do you think any plugin that marks an object or tile functions?

That's why when I'm out and using mobile I typically just do bankstanding skills.

I'm viewing some of your previous comments, and man, you really are hostile.

&gt;"the game is garbage if im not told exactly where to click, when to click, how to click, I am also a lazy entitled reddit baby"

To explain my main point from before: If you really ban every single 3rd party client, then you are going to ban 98% of the player base. Is that worse than the player base dropping in RS3? Yes, it is.

How old are you, if I may ask?

I laugh as I uninstall OSRS off of my work's computer..

god you're so incredibly stupid

Thank you for making this video possible!

Yes? Again who‚Äôs to say the client shouldn‚Äôt be updated to include overlays that previously didn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre actually still playing OldSchool. The client is archaic and needs a few QoL updates or at least would have to find some middle ground to not be entirely rejected.

Warden was basically spyware. It‚Äôs creepy.

You win.

It's funny when you're taking ore and fish from power levelers and making thousands per trip, and each time you go back to GE the same people are just sitting there begging for 10k. Like dude, it's literally sitting on the ground just pick it up.

My trash email got one for an account I never logged into.
