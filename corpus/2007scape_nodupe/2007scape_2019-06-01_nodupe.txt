Spread bullshit? A human being made a little mistake about a piece of info from a 15 year old game... Your toxic attitude is the only bullshit being spread. If you don't like a comment downvote and move on. That's what the arrows are for, btw.

definitely. i may be a bit overstatted for the average barrows‚Äôer but i rarely eat or sip. even with 4 way range and 4 way tunnels switch i have 5-6 open inventory spots
---
Weapons of the same type retain the same combat style when equipped, so it's not unnecessary. As for the aesthetic of it, that's a whole other argument, but it does have its uses

What happened in January?
---
As far as I can see, yes to an extent. I see no reason why you can't go fishing -&gt; cooking -&gt; mining -&gt; smithing -&gt; ranging, etc. There'd probably be an issue somewhere, though. Not sure.
---
Looks great, if you have the rock golem pet, give it the lovakite ore and try a dragon warhammer or a dragon cane instead of that staff.
---
He likes a quick fuck, don‚Äôt judge.

Ya, that‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôm thinking. It would be a dedicated world, maybe convert Role playing worlds to this.

My melee spec setup is bgs, dragon boots, melee void Helm, and fire cape. Supplies are Anti-venom+, super extended antifire, super restore, ranging pot, super attack, rune pouch with dust law and chaos, 1 click tele, ardy cloak, 4 karambwans and the rest mantas

Even better, we need a max obby cape

The implication being that if you put 3000 hours into the game and don't have the ability to do the Inferno, then you're a brainlet.

The default floor of the menagerie is just grass like an empty space would have, so without being filled it will look like an empty space.

I doubt they're making that much, even if they were you still have to subtract the daily cost of buying 30 accounts that will be banned very quickly

That is shitty my man, hope all works out in the end.

When are you going to kill those 89 ankous
---
Yeah, that. Lol
---
I was close to 80 chests dry at barrows after finishing mory hards. Then yesterday I decided to take a break from barrows and started doing MLM since I need a coal bag for 70 Smith. Then after about 20min of that I got the mining pet. Hyped I went back to barrows and got 2 items in ~10 chests. Granted they were Ahrims and Karil heads but still. 
---
Try that.
---
Saving this pic for future memes, ty
---
No b gloves?
---
Only if jad was healed to full. One thing that can be done to prevent them being respawned is to kill all except one of them, then trapping or tanking the last healer. Jad won't spawn them again if any were left alive.

Yea rapier is shit for pking unless you use that insta gmaul glitch (and I guess it might be ok with dh?)

My ban was removed btw idiot

Didn't you say you weren't shitting on people?

Whatever your opinions are, you're a hypocrite.

wrath runes are adopted
---
They would, just not much in the case of skilling items.  Not many people die cutting trees.  I hope a new skill creates an item sink.  Rs3 has invention to consume lower level items and raised prices considerably for rare stuff.  That game is super inflated with money though.
---
My ban just got removed üëç
---
&gt; the amount of gold emblems bring into the game is ridiculous

How do they bring in gold? Can you exchange emblems for coins now?

not until i clicked on his profile LOL

Smh, and the rich get richer.

Indeed. The (/s) mark indicates sarcasm.

Fletching and magic, yes. But thats not only realistic that's like the easiest of them all. Just do darts and magic imbue while doing other stuff. No tick manipulation or anything required.

Maxed obv refers to 07, considering lack of 200 apps in 07. Some simple thinking on your behalf would be required to think that through though.

Cannonballs and spinning flax into bowstrings are great low requirement methods to make some money on an alt.

Get some hunter + farming levels and do herb + birdhouse runs, you're making a bit more.

Get some combat/slayer levels and do brutal black dragons / gargoyles, you're making a bit more.

Get some questing done and do rune dragons, you're making a bit more.

Give your alt your attention and ToB on it while you're doing afk skills on your main, you're making a bit more.

Personally I don't use Arclight outside of Abby Demons, there really isn't any reason for it.

Lol, I'd be more than happy with a toggle, I just really don't think it's intrusive enough to warrant one.  If enough people cause a fuss, they'll add a toggle.

But bushes and cacti, is it on the last or on the check health
---
Not just WoW any more I think, I know destiny and borderlands do a similar thing, and a few other loot based games i've played. Seems almost standard these days.
---
After getting most of them recently I think the lumbridge, varrock, and karamja are the nicest to have. Karamja purely for slayer though.
---
REEEEEE JAMFLEX UNPOLLED WERDS BAD

Me too, brother. Me too. I alch‚Äôd rune arrows for the longest to not have to click Unnoted items before I knew that! Hahah

I didn't know how and it was always a minor problem so I didn't research a solution. Really glad I saw this thread because I didn't know you could turn it off so easily!

Ehp is the max efficiency possible per hour

The guy was calling bracelets sweaty, and I argued against that.

You're just arguing semantics.

It‚Äôs cause those two are helms and the other one is a hood.

Morytania isn't too hard, and you get an additional herb patch and the bonecrusher gives full prayer xp.

You're right, it's been a while since I've played and I was mixing up the collection log and the runelite loot tracker.

Took me less than 10 times to get the set on my uim. Only regret I had was not getting it earlier

Make that area multi combat too ;)

I wanna hoard stuff other than burnt food that can't be bought. Do you have any suggestions?

A link to my reddit post. Something terribly wrong is happening with accounts at the duel arena. its understandable that they are so vigilant as most stakers DO RWT but some of them are legit and respectable players. this is so unfair to the both of us, really! except they gave you games of chance and i got rwt. i feel like they are just guessing who is legit and who isnt WTF. we need to work together bro, the more this happens to the more chance we have to get our accounts back as this was a wrongful termination! i didn't know this stuff was happening to other people so this is a big relief to not be the only one.
---
tl;dr engine work
---
Different games because you can spend 1k hours clicking trees, or spend 1k hours actually getting good at the game. If rs the main game you really play and you spend tons of time on it, might as well get good at it. Not counting people who just like to play casually, because they probably won't get to max anyways.

I average around 165 with quest cape. What's your strategy for switching between blue streams? Do you always just go to the fullest one?
---
Yeah it needs to be reverted. But, it was made as an integrity change for a bygone Era. Now that it's here, it's hard to go back
---
You arent taking into account getting to 99 first to achieve those exp rates.
---
He‚Äôs right though. 
---
Last thing we need is sweaty EHP pants-shitters dictating the direction of this game.
---
Piles of ashes I guess?
---
Nice.
---
server were stupidly unstable when OSRS launched so people were losing tons of stuff unfairly to disconnects. the 1 hour grace period was added as a temporary fix
---
it's now been so long that it's pretty much just a core mechanic of the game, and any changes to it would never pass polls.
---
IMO they should definitely look at reworking death mechanics as an integrity change. A huuuuge aspect of runescape back in the day was how punishing death was, and this game is just simply missing that for everyone who isnt a HCIM/UIM. At worst you just pay a gold fee to get your stuff back from a vork death or tob wipe.
---
Can't you buy that on the GE?
---
I'm not sure, haven't played for a while. Perhaps it can be used for herblore.
---
I don't think there are many useless untradeables now that I think of it
---
Sometimes I think back to when I would only play on 3 rune dragon alts at once and it keeps me up at night
---
Your post wasted my time same as dev time down voted
---
But people blowpipe vorkath?
---
The main meta alts are, in random order:
---
1) Infernal eels (80 Fishing)
---
2) Sacred eels (87 Fishing, ideally maxed Cooking - cooking affects # of scales per eel)
---
3) Slayer
---
4) Raids (often also slayer or RDAs)
---
5) Rune drags
---
Slayer alts basically need a minimum of 70 slayer, starting out with Kurasks at 70, Wyverns at 72, Gargoyles at 75, and finally Brutal Black Dragons at 77.
---
Raiding alts are just NMZ'd up accounts that spam CoX (generally). They're sort of like a lower-time investment version of a RDA considering you don't need many quests to do raids, just an Ava's, 90+ combats/Piety, and expensive gear. Obviously you can only play this when your main is doing something AFK like agility or zeah rc.
---
Eels are I think the main thing you're looking for here. Unfortunately there's no "quick start" alt, unless you count a CoX scouting alt as a thing (scout and sell perfect raids), which can technically be done at basically level 3.
---
Keep in mind Sacred eels require Regicide to be completed. Infernal eels are actually the fastest meta alt to create but requires you to be good enough to do fire cape on an alt.
---
What this guy said.
---
Like you‚Äôre trying WAY too fucking hard
---
I know there was ZMI changes to trading recently. I did keep all my rune essence when I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be dropped on dearh? Perhaps my rune essence prevented me from keeping my valuable items? Just thinking out loud here.
---
??
---
Sorry, did I stutter?
---
no
---
...everyone in this comment threat understands the price crash is because the blade of saeldor polled in the elf quest blog passed right? Rapier wiil no longer be the BIS weapon so people are selling theirs anticipating a price drop.
---
Runescape is a game for masochists I swear
---
I do hoard frog tokens, mystery boxes and lamps rather than using them. But it takes a long time to stock those!
---
The other big non-ge collectable is crushed gems. Some people also collect massive amounts of items such as feathers or monkey nuts, where even though you can buy them in the GE, they have enough that it's still impressive.
---
reports dont work in cc, i figured a jmod would see this or something
---
although what‚Äôs interesting is you either need to fletch or train wc while playing so idk how he got the outfit without training either of those two on this OSAAT
---
wHAT the FUCK hoW????
---
Chop chop, he needs to hop.
---
Bro just get the fucking gloves.
---
You still need it for pvp as the orb doesn't work in wilderness.
---
Everything goes down in value.  If coins also go down in value, an item can go up in price.
---
That's ok, if it makes you feel better I got KQ head at 3kc then used it to make the slayer helm because I didn't know you needed it for anything else...
---
do infernal eels drop whole onyxes? i was under the impression it was just tokkul and bolt tips
---
Have you tried to kill the monsters on wave 35?
---
Seriously though wave 38 is the wave you're talking about. You can try to lure one while killing the other or put your tank gear on and bruteforce (kill the ranger asap).
---
Yeah, that's pretty much the only unavoidable damage they have. The best way to do it is to just pray mage (since most suggested setups have much lower magic defense than range) and hope they either go with magic or you can tank the ranged hit.
---
I like the smiley faces on the crabs :)
---
These are my new favorite posts
---
Better than the thousands of casuals who want to make everything boring and easy by fixing everything that makes OSRS oldschool
---
Vorkath and zulrah are botted as well lol
---
Yah the dhl devalued the rapier far more than the blade of saeldor, although the blade is what triggered the current crash
---
I bought a dragon hunter crossbow yesterday and have been testing it out. Blessed d hide, fury, odium ward, archers (i). I‚Äôm 93 range. 
---
This dragon hunter crossbow absolutely shreds these things.
---
Alchemical Hydra pet would look good with that
---
What happened in April?

I'm new so grinding sand crabs. Almost to combat lv 75 :)

Can you just fuck up oh my god
---
I wish üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Vorkath isn't good money because it isn't bottable (though it helps), it's good money because it's relatively difficult and has many more requirements than bottable methods.
---
People who go through the grind for DS2 expect to make more money than those who haven't. If low effort bottable income becomes competitive, nobody is going to spend months grinding ds2 to make the same money as they can chopping yews or fishing sharks. Since Vorkath drops are still very much needed, the prices on those drops will rise until people decide that Vorkath is once again worth going through months of preparation to unlock, and significantly more effort to kill.
---
You guys do great work
---
Jagex servers can still be ddos'd right? So if they revert it back they'd need to make it so other people can't pick up the items, which would also make it a more effective item sink.
---
haha relatable
---
I guess that depends on how much you value the inventory slot. I've been one food short of a kill too many times to say that it's just one inventory slot.
---
So no they didn't lol
---
 Wc lvl?
---
Having literally everything go through a poll would be 
---
F u n

---

---
It's a pretty notoriously long grind where everyone knows some lucky mofo that got it in like 90 minutes. Think it took me around 3-4 hours.
---
wrong, anywhere that the rapier was bis before, is no longer bis because of the dragon hunter lance. With the new weapon being slash, it will replace every location you would normally use a tent whip. There are a few niche places I guess that rapier will still be EQUAL to the new blade like DKs, demonic gorillas, bandos maybe? and the very few slayer monsters that you melee still. But a rapier is pretty useless already, depending on how hard it is to get the new weapon there might be no reason to have a rapier period.
---
Yeah i hope i can get the account back as well since i did nothing wrong.
---
More fun if you fake-ironman. Or better yet, fake-co-op-ironman. Essentially, I found with my friends that if they are just getting into the game, they do the classic sell cow hides at GE to buy armour and then... then they stop playing because they don't get what else there is to do. Meanwhile when I brought people in as fake-co-op-ironman, we made new F2P accounts and would only trade with stores and each other. So getting iron armour was literally a challenge because cowhides only sell for like 1gp at stores, and iron armour cost like 300gp per piece at each store!! So we set a goal of trying to beat Dragon Slayer without using the wiki as much as possible. That meant we gotta do some quests, these quests become more than just "read wiki, stock up on required items, speed click through the dialogue", and turned into actually trying to figure out what to do next, only turning to the wiki as a last resort, then the like 500gp you get as a reward is HUGE because you can actually buy a weapon or something Haha. And training skills is more interesting because one of you can specialize in fishing, another in cooking, etc. So it's less of a grind for each person. 
---
That's at least how I successfully got friends into the game. Main goal of Dragon Slayer where you can only trade with each other gives tons of small goals on the way to keep you occupied.
---
May want to include your stats along with this. If you are struggling to get it past half health you are either doing something wrong or your stats are low enough that a 1.5m cash stack won‚Äôt be enough to compensate. Hard to say without seeing other stats, but I would bet it‚Äôd be better to train up and do slayer to make some money before making the commitment to learn and then learning with the right gear and higher range/mage
---
It's a game that just isn't for everyone.
---
turn the lights on so i can judge your life more accurately.

Was it worth be celibate for 2 years?

Bought mine for like 325m back in November. Go me

It's called, "God, I wish we were all on a PvP world right now."
---
I have 4 more waiting in case the day comes
---
on the final phase? just click two squares away when you see shadows under you. doable even with 250 ping
---
You're right, I was totally misremembering how infernal eels worked! I haven't done the method myself but it's a commonly known strategy for lazy alting as you don't have to bank.
---
I heard it was worse than ahrims almost always and thats why I was told not to go for it. It would help if i wasnt an ass hat and could do Zulrah.
---
Yes! It's just the air dry clay you can buy at any craft store. Then I painted it and put modge podge in it to give it a shine
---
You'll learn to like it more on the left especially with higher level content. I'm mobile only as well, and without the swap raids and stuff would be alot harder. 
---
Prayer filtering like spellbook filtering needs to happen to make mobile competitive.. And make the higher level content or pvp Less susceptible to a "fat finger" That's the main qol I see that is an absolute must. 
---
By being able to reorder or resize the prayer icons is the key man.
---
If you don‚Äôt need it specifically for travel, you can boost and plant it in the third level of the farming guild and use it to access those extra patches. If you do want it for travel I would say it depends on how much you have in your house. Port Sarim tree is useful if you don‚Äôt have access to mounted glory, jewelry box.
---
But slayer uwu
---
Hah! Like you know how to tell virgins apart from others, you have to have had the sex in order to know a virgin when you see one.
---
How did you think I knew you were a virgin? Virgin.
---
Basically just a picture frame with depth and a glass cover
---
Oh wow, The more you know hey? Thanks for the info
---
I was literally just thinking about this account today haha glad to see you're still hard at work! Keep it up man!
---
That would just lead to actual people being banned to meet quotas.
---
Because Jagex wants to turn OSRS into RS3.
---
This is the final straw.
---
Boycott now.
---
Forget the melee. Trident of swamp with tank gear, occult and mage cape, switch into blessed dhide with fury/range version of torture can‚Äôt remember lol with blowpipe for ahrim then wear salve (I) ammy to kill 3 skeletons
---
Did you keep your graceful?
---
I love this. Your day has been made like fuck

He‚Äôs right though. The suggested new hp bars looked like ass and pretty much every reply on Twitter agreed.

Looking through other posts where this has happened, I think that if you die after you kill Jad, but before you get teleported out, then you don't get the cape. I don't believe you need to kill the healers for it, but you do have to survive after Jad dies for a moment.
---
Cows and hill giants are probably going to be your main training methods for f2p. Bank the cowhides from cows and big bones/limpwurt root/runes from hill giants to sell to other players.

Got it, thank you for the reply

Seems unlikely, he did so much stuff outside of tournaments, wouldn‚Äôt be fired for that especially when he was an og staff member.

Do you get what he's saying? Even if all your stuff get deleted on death you still keep the three most valuable things, which includes the rapier anyway
---
didn't they announce that like a year ago?

Ahrim is another 4m and maybe they dont have 70 def. idk lol

I made close to 50m on my 10HP Mauler at the lower level farm. I waited for targets to upgrade emblems though. I had a few more T10s which helped out the price. I also sniped about 5 guys for B Necks and B Rings as well for part of that 50m. Well worth my time!

This is in Canada right? üßê

lol no they would have to raise the stats significantly.  The only thing that makes the bow good is against magic based monsters and the scythe is extremely niche as is.

Well there's actually been over 150 polls since release ([list here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Polls#List_of_polls)) but not all of them are "Old School Content Polls". Stuff like QOL polls, when they repoll stuff, etc. aren't "content polls" in that sense

(though Jagex is super inconsistent about their labeling on this tbh. Like, Song of the Elves was in a "Content Poll" but Kebos Lowlands wasn't? Not sure why ü§∑)

I mean if you want to be really bleak, but thats more of a philosophical thing that can be argued.

I just can't imagine playing legacy in rs3, all of their new content is designed to go against someone that deals 4k+ damage in a single hit, and rapidly
---
Good luck on your journey!

All of them, at 50/50 speed

Nah if I'm gunna be a lazy no life who only plays runescape I'm gunna at least have some incense going

After you post it you need to tag it with a thread tag. Read your PMs from "Auto-Moderator"

I remember being scammed out of 50gp and a black kiteshield because the guy said he could get it trimmed at the wizard's tower down south. As far as I remember they've never been worth that much and I'm pretty sure he was wearing full rune. No idea why he did that, but it's been over a decade and I still remember it happening so I guess he got more out of it than just the material goods.
---
I was the guy in addy
---
Exactly, musicians never seemed like much help. It seemed like you get almost just as far if you kept walking rather than stoping to rest the sprinting to catch up maybe im wrong tho.
---
Use ProtonMail because it is unrecoverable. It has 2FA and will generate password keys for your account Incase you forget your password, so  save your password key to a usb drive and lock that into a safe place. Then use that email solely for RuneScape.

Max EHP (or more accurately, max xphr) and EHP rates are different things. Getting 250k xphr (paying for runners and such) is over what crystal math labs defines as EHP (currently 100k xphr for rc). EHP rates are generally lower than max xphr rates for every skill.

Chill brah get up out his grill brah fr fr

Upvoting so i can see the results later

Pretty sure you just log after 20 minutes

You got ancestral and tormented bracelet before finishing mage arena bruh..
---
Is he wearing that new Fremmenik Kilt?
---
Virgin melee and range, chad mage
---
Yeah lol, they're so busy working on SoTE if I had to assume that there was almost nothing released that could have led to any drama
---
I'm guessing June will make up for both months if that quest comes out
---
You forget that most people play this game while not looking at the screen, when you have little boxes to tell you where to click you don't need to pay any attention. Unfortunately there are no boxes and flashing text for feeding your cat
---
Just rwt lmao
---
It has to be deathless if you die it ends the raids...
---
You mean buy from jagex for irl money? Yeah they sell instantly on the GE.
---
buy members grind the requs to do barrows once you can do barrows do it untill you get enough cash to sustain a bond
---
Man I miss when you could pick up his stuff. I wish they'd undo the casual death mechanic and go back to the real death of risk and fear
---
If you want to make money what you need to do is kill ogresses
---
Hey nice banner man üëç
---
There‚Äôs already so many in the game that making them rarer won‚Äôt do shit to their price for years.
---
So just for PKing? Bc I always play fullscreen, but I never PK anyways, mainly do PVM. (I‚Äôm not OP btw)
---
Three skeletons can get you bolt racks, better to kill 2 skellies and a bloodworm.
---
Just feed it when it gets below 75% hp and it never dies
---
Yeah
---
So a bunch of lvl 4 bots with high thieving logged in to the GE and bugged it basically
---
Lol nice entity hider
---
That shit made me crack up for some reason
---
Other way around.
---
Potentially a game-saving suggestion. Hope this gets attention and consideration from the mods.
---
Well I have a 13 pray gmauler account with 1.3k bh kills, I dont understand how people can do barb assault all day but there are those who CHOOSE to do that. I also have a near maxed pure so if I want to wild pk I can.
---
Alch yourself
---
So jealous! Im at 90 wc and still don't have it. üò≠üò≠ soo lucky.
---
Alright I get it; it's more xp based. Thanks :)
---
EHP nerds don't compete for hiscores other than normie overall or certain skill, otherwise we would see someone boosting kills with an alt at duel arena to get insane amount of kills
---
If you break emblem farming down per account its also not that high gp/h.
---
That background though
---
No no no, but everything has a 75 next to it in the skill guide instead of a 90 so it‚Äôs different /s
---
Yes and it shouldnt be support even more.
---
Can someone explain to me what crashing is
---
Umm.. in what order?
---
What he did wasn't insisting, he simply stated the possiblity that he still could be botting.
---
As an actual example of insisting we have you, who keeps insisting that he said something that he provably didn't.
---
It's entirely possible that right now you are botting, guess we'll never know huh?
---
What a good chap!
---
Aight, thanks for your answer! Gl with law school

Yeah this makes sense, ddsupport++.

But will probably devalue tier 75 weapons purely psychologically as people will consider them worth less
---
This one's only if you have a pc &amp; android(optional: rooted for extra qol); stream your pc to your phone using a app like moonlight game stream, plug a mouse in using a USB otg cable. (Extra points if you plug in a USB hub so you can plug a keyboard in too lol)
---
&gt;But I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that won't happen ^because ^it ^really ^doesn't ^matter ^and ^you're ^being ^nitpicky

I've asked several people and all the responses have been either "ye it's fucking annoying" and "I can't find it either" 
---
Should be gone within the month if jagex is somewhat competent.
---
I didn't play much/go on reddit much, what was January's drama I am assuming it's some sort of Konar Brew drop?

Ye god forbid they spend resources on making the game better.

Og_Clutch_Af... Add me.. Alwyas up for convo

Even if he did, who cares? KempQ hyped it up so much but never delivered. He just sounds salty to me.

This looks inefficient af, turn your cape in at the closest 2200 world, you're fired
---
That's a stretch, lmao
---
Black demon and bouncer are both good
---
It doesn‚Äôt say that at all, it says it‚Äôll have an attack speed of 4, same as rapier
---
Not true, focusers use it sometimes since spec bar doesn't matter as they'd usually spec from staff aanyways.
---
Don't kill the ones in the catacombs, they are extremely slow and don't drop much more than the other variant. However if you're looking to afk they're pretty nice if you don't mind spending prayer pots.
---
No, it specifically spiked in may because they did the twitch prime promo
---
Nieve and steve's incestuous child

the blade part of it is actualy cosmetic, therefore u cant use it.

Say I buy a 3 month membership, is that a reoccurring payment?

Cute!

30m was rich in like 2004-2006, and not even for the adults that played back then. But to me as a kid that was a shitton since none of us knew what we were doing to get more than 1-2 mil total.
---
They stack addictively. But the difference between an addictive and multiplicative stack is minuscule. An addictive stack would result in 1.3 multiplier while a multiplicative one would result in 1.32.
---
No drama? My gf from lumbridge dumped me after i paid the 10k for a guy with a mith scim.

With changes to two of the faster methods over the past couple of weeks, most guides are a little behind.  I still thinking the Ourania alter on Lunars is the faster xp at level 62.

Noob question: What reason do you pick when reporting the ‚Äúnext 15 players get x‚Äù YouTube bots?
---
&gt; Claws &gt; Ags
---
ags has a higher max hit and is more accurate, so I'm not sure if that's always correct.
---
What's that line going out there? Shows multi-zones??
---
Does this fit r/cutenoobs?
---
Is there a good emblem trader cc to purchase a rune pouch?
---
With 4 experienced runners to be precise
---
I agree they should be changed. Maybe not to 90, I'd be happy with 80 for BP and Sanguinesti. 85 for T-bow and Scythe. It won't stop stronger weapons coming in but it's better than being in denial and pretending they aren't as strong as they are.
---
In that case scythe is useless too unless you're rich enough to use it outside ToB
---
I glanced through your profile and found your RSN and your state. could probably find enough info to get your other social media if I cared to. then either find your number on your profile (e.g. hey guys, new phone, here's my new number), call social media support and ask them to confirm what number is associated with your account, or talk to your friends and pretend I know you and just lost your number
---
 I run a county hunter clan that has a lot of pures if you wanna hang out 
---
"bh and chill" cc
---
this unlocks so much content for /u/kypris 's account
---
I agree they should be changed. I would be happy with 80 for Blowpipe and Sanguinesti. And with 85 for T-bow and Scythe (Attack &amp; Str). It won't stop stronger weapons coming in but it's better than being in denial and pretending they aren't as strong as they are.
---
Another option with blowpipe would be to add range level requirements to what darts can be used. So at least someone can't roll up with 75 range and using rune/dragon darts.
---
Haven't done pp in years but IIRC you keep your hitpoints low. So he might exit the cave at like 7 hp
---
Another option with blowpipe would be to add range level requirements to what darts can be used with BP, so you need maybe 80 for Rune and 90 for Dragon.
---
Speed of claws makes it better
---
Was his name "batlle mage"?
---
Another option with blowpipe would be to add range level requirements to what darts can be used with BP, so you need maybe 80 for Addy, 87 for Rune and 94 for Dragon.
---
How ever the ability to wack with ags makes it a bit more versatile
---
He probs has 10k stacks of phats in his bank and wants a mansion in Fiji.
---
You have to be pretty dumb to get perm muted
---
Are you stupid? They do. Just not public to people who aren't in a clan.
---
Source: I made one for a clan. Idiot.
---
New OP barrage mage training spot lol
---
No because that place is all gear whereas F1 tab is weapon only tab
---
Clues aren't efficent for 200m all since the gp isn't worth it and gp is 0 time

the one time ive seen it the looters got all of it, roughly 150 - 300k worth of loot.

I remember when I was playing some WoW ripoff rnd there was a marriage mechanic and I was litterally changing my husband every month and milking them to the end.

Damn, did I have good eq.

OSRS isn't like RS3 where the requirement correlates exactly with how good it is.

The elf quest line has the twist that helps make a good movie.
---
KempQ is a lonely weirdo who quit making interesting content and now makes lame-ass Runescape lets plays. Can‚Äôt wait until he moves in with Alfie and somehow manages to ruin his life like every other one of Alfies roommates. It‚Äôs what happens to man children who play runescape all day then try to live on their own as functioning adults.
---
why do people even wear magic gear when unlocking the spells? literally does nothing for you. I just 3 itemed with monk robes
---
Meanwhile I just botted 99 ranged on my pure and this guy gets banned for fucking around with his friends. I'm glad I don't play this game legit as it's a fucking joke as is jamflex.
---
Hope you get your acc back though, I know how infuriating it is to lose an account to this piece of shit botwatch crap that doesn't even actually catch real RWTs or bots.
---
Is that an actual line like to parody Velma? Bc if that‚Äôs actually from Johnny Bravo then fuck that‚Äôs funny
---
Wtf ... easy clues in wilderness!!!! I've mever heard of such thing.
---
Yes it does, if you pay for osrs you got rs3 memb too. Osrs and rs3 shares the same subscription. So you are essentially paying 5.5 dollars for rs3 and osrs memb
---
can't you just head north a bit and cannon where they aren't?
---
What happens if the bots train it though
---
That frog specced him out lmao
---
Generalisation, also known as statistics, the opposite of an anecdote. Yet I'm being disingenuous.
---
Are you a marxist yourself by any chance?
---
Yes
---
I hate you! 0 at 800+
---
someone get?
---
Lmao
---
Just play da game mate and the gp comes.
---
People don't understand that if you make your account with an email that nobody knows and is only used for that osrs account, you can't get hacked. The only way to get hacked after this is by clicking bad links or releasing too many personal details to someone.
---
I have a prepaid visa and want to buy bonds, but it doesnt work on their website. Is there any other way I can buy bonds/gold with a prepaid visa safely?

May 2020 drama calendar: jagex accidentally removes the fire cape from the game, all players who had one are required to do the caves again after the cape is added back in
---
What?
---
It‚Äôs not against the rules you mongrel
---
its normal it does this all the time and goes back to 40k once twitch prime is over
---
You don't have to imagine that, shitty bot scripts exists for that reason
---
Do you need a hug? You seem distressed.
---
30m acc worth not close to having an ancestral hat and tormented bracelet. OP bought his acc/gold 100%
---
Damn straight
---
Yeah, like, what's the problem here lol
---
And that's more just sweaty neckbeards gatekeeping rather than actual drama.
---
His internet could have cut out as well. I believe if your connection dies it keeps you in combat until it's resolved.
---
"Help out the community" yeah totally why are you complaining about competition then....couldnt possibly be competing for donations instead of whos the better helper
---
No but I can give you my twitch url if you want to follow lel
---
How? Neither are used in PvP, and changing what "tier" they are on has zero impact on 100% of the playerbase who can afford to use them.
---
&gt;THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT! RIOT!!! WHAT AM I PAYONG FOR?!?!
---
I ask the same question every day that aatrox isnt nerfed
---
No offence bro but no one cares. Report him and move on
---
Still really enjoyable
---
What the hell, you just straight up reposted the meme I created 130ish days ago.
---
Always between 4-7 in max mage with arma/bp switch. Usual times between 1:10-1:50.
---
Gl on the grind brother
---
True
---
Yes it would. The reason you believe it isnt is because people can buy gold with no repercussions. Getting enough gold for a tbow or scythe is not an easy feat.
---
Fuck your friendship
---
Played this game for a decade and didn't even know there were frogs in Sophanem before this post.
---
And your negativity. :)
---
I skip both because they aren't good gp or exp compared to my other options
---
Unless you're in Rev cave you better get that tb off quick
---
You only get force logged from combat if your client is disconnected. If your pc is on and still running the game and you are logged on, you wont ever be timed out if youre in combat unless you get 6 hour logged
---
Google best quest order. You get a lot of xp from certain quests that bypass a lot of the extremely low level shit and give you a good early boost.
---
Don't you have to use it on the web?
---
Base 90, 99 mage, quest cape and achievement cape - every teleportation in the game - base 95s - infernal cape - max cape.
---
Go go!
---
Why does no one care that they announced that they are going to make unpolled changes to f2p and gave the weak ass excuse that polling would "take too long."
---
"This need for versatility and responsiveness means that we can't poll these content changes, as the process would be too slow."
---
Spinning flax into bowstring yields good proffit. Flax is like 3-4 gp each and bowstrings sell for like 85-90 each. 
---
You can also smith cannonballs at 34 smithing. Very afk and like 300k proffit/hr.
---
C H I L D U D E S XDDDDDDDDDD
---
If you aren't sweaty you will get less than you would at vork
---
I did the calculations for all the items from the information provided on the wiki.
---
Turns out it's 50/50
---
You take the drop rate of each and multiply them together i think. So lets say for example sake they‚Äôre all 1/100. You do 100x100x100 giving you a drop rate of 1/1,000,000. I THINK. So just multiply those items drop rates and there you go.
---
I did not listen, read, or watch the stuff about the new weapon.  So they have increased the drop rate of the rapier?
---
R.I.PIT
---
Another update on these farms. I just found the same farm from the video 3 days later. Not in same place but I looked up a few of the people in it. They're got 100+ kills each, it's quite mad!
---
Didn't he say on stream about the next DMM being the last, something that he shouldn't have said as they were going to be saying that they were "taking a break from it"?
---
?
---
It is a statistic, and statistics are generalisations. I'm gonna take that as a yes though.
---
Gooood.
---
None of this is true. Provide sources
---
Yea definitely start with quests. If you're staying 1def you'll be kinda limited with the quests you can do, but there's still a lot of beneficial ones you wanna get out of the way.
---
Non-scalable solutions like having mod patrolling an area never works. Because there are way more cheaters than devs, losing an hour of dev time to deal with an hour a botter put into the game means we lost
---
In this situation it would be even worse because the botter likely automated the whole process, so he spent even less time than the dev banning the bots. Basically, he'll just do it again, maybe changing areas.
---
We need an automated bot busting system that can catch these kind of bots. A project mods can invest time into and then only maintain. Trying to fight botting with raw man-power is a waste of resources. It's basically why it's so hard to keep bots out.
---
Well it's only gonna get worse... have fun!! Good luck!!
---
https://youtu.be/nGf3PdZviXk
---
This is it, chief.
---
Do people not realize the rate that marks show up drops to 20% after they reach 20 levels over the course level req? If you‚Äôre level 60 or higher and still running Canifis you‚Äôre wasting time trying to get marks.
---
They won‚Äôt, because we vote on it. The next op item is probably going to be a mage staff around lvl 75-80.
---
Lol is this a kenshi reference?
---
Bop
---
He needs to be careful or he‚Äôs gonna fall off that edge.
---
I had multiple dreams of dying on my hardcore! The craziest was I accidentally pulled the wildy lever and had to run all the way back to lvl 1 wilderness. I actually made it but kbd was guarding the warning ditch and fireballed me lol.   
---
Btw I died to deranged archeologist on 4 kc. Practice bosses on a different acc!
---
Smoke devils are up to 190k, nechs and dust devils without alts 75k and 70k, respectively, dagganoth 85k, kalphite 78k. I average over 50k xp/hr long term doing these tasks. Trolls are 100% an expeditious task.
---
How do so many people have time to play this game for 10 hours a day?? That shit ain't healthy.
---
You posted this shit last night.
---
First time in my life did mage arena 1 and 2 last night and this was my strategy exactly. Mind you I died to every boss once.... but I felt very chill risking only 50k in bloods. I kept right lighting every sara mage ready to hop
---
You could say it was hopping mad.
---
Yeah good luck with that mate, plenty of clans that will play 4mil +
---
Sir pugger bot vids? No?
---
I use pretty welfare gear. Ahrims, trident of the swamp, inf boots, suffering (not really welfare but i love it), occult and for range i just bring dhide legs and torso with a bp. Get 2 kills a trip and they‚Äôre slow but my mage is only 80.
---
Reddit shows when a comment is edited dumbass. And I doubt you made 2b in 3 weeks with mid level stats so keep bullshitting lol. You clearly have no clue about this game.
---
we payo we snort yeyo
---
There were more brainlets on here complaining about it than the HLC. Reddit was just crying because an RC method got nerfed despite them literally never planning to use that method.
---
Never forget "rC bAd" is used ironically here.
---
Honestly it's surprising how respectful most people in BH are nowadays. Obviously there's still some angry douches running around, but like 9/10 times when you kill someone you just get a "gf".
---
Thats 4m/hr non stop for 504 hours.
---
Big Doubt.
---
Oh look, its blufjoe again with his 4853th repost about Stealing Creation/Fist of Guthix/Clan Wars/Gamers Grotto.
---
Smol boi
---
What are you talking about? It's not allowed.
---
What are you getting at here?
---
That wasn‚Äôt necessarily from shamans though, it‚Äôs showing the drops from any monster.
---
It's been banned since the new zealand terror attack, so highly doubt it will be back
---
Mind giving me your money making secrets? ;)
---
He is stalling his moovement so that he appears inside the safe zone, but in reality he is a dangerous zone at the time the picture is taken. When players try to click on the bank chest, they will click on him, and since it is a pvp world they will click attack and run out in the dangerous zone and get frozen by his ZGS. The lure works because players usually take out their cash stack to repair their untradeables after they die. I asked one of these luerers how much he had made, and he said he made over 140m that day alone (this was a week ago).
---
3000 hours? Rookie numbers
---
na, 60k/h is still great even if there are better tasks, no point in skipping free and easy xp.
---
And that‚Äôs the truth!
---
It‚Äôs 72k/hr or 1200 gp/minute and I think it already takes it by the minute or every 10 even. Not sure what this post is about.
---
Does it matter? It‚Äôs really not a big deal. I feel like it‚Äôs fine at this point, osrs really doesn‚Äôt rely on tiers as much. We vote to put them wherever we want, following the tbow and scythe trend we will probably have a new op 1b mage staff and probably throw it under 75-80 mage too. I don‚Äôt really see the issue, who cares how many weapons there are under ‚Äútier‚Äù 75? 
---
If we wanted tbow to be 90 range then blowpipe should be 90 as well with ddarts being more dps in a lot of cases. Rigour also is insane dps boost, should that be 90 prayer as well?
---
isn‚Äôt mage arena single combat too? splashing would keep you locked in combat so pkers wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit you
---
The special attack of claws has 4 independent accuracy rolls. Maybe if you were naked with exactly 75 attack and no prayer or potion boosts , but d claws are actually more accurate than an AGS in all situations it is actually used.
---
I approve this
---
Mage helm DansGame
---
Nice tho.
---
thats the point -_-
---
You may as well stop playing now then mate. There‚Äôs things that take you literal months late game.
---
Don't forget these bots are banned every day, only for new ones to take their place. This is due to the membership trials. With that gone, these bots absolutely won't turn a profit.
---
Personally, I think the trial is worth the consequences.
---
How do you enable that?
---
I don't think making pure accounts is comparable to skilling accounts. Pure accounts are made to increase their advantages in PVP situations over main accounts (unless you're maxed). Skilling accounts are made for novelty and that's completely fine but they hold no advantages over main accounts. Skilling on a pure counts as a little of both.
---
I don't personally enjoy playing IM for a few reasons but won't get into it here because that's not the point of your question.
---
Agreed
---
30m and it recently only sold at 45m
---
It would be nice if it deducted coins every time you took out bars
---
Roughly how much would this one farm be making and what do they bot?
---
Found it thanks very much! Had no idea there are more than one sheets on his calculator
---
I hear people talk about tagging jad healers and assumed it was a jad specific thing, but now you say it here. What's tagging?
---
Back in the day that would have been a free scepter.
---
Just buy the clean herbs
---
Fearosrs or fear osrs. Can‚Äôt remember if we use a space or not, but most of the guys are chill. I‚Äôll be honest though there‚Äôs a couple douchey try hards too, But all the people who do learner raids are nice guys. We do require base 85 combat stats and some halfway decent gear before anyone will take ya. We have a discord with all that info though.
---
My twitter is https://mobile.twitter.com/mrgoolboy ! Thanks for the support!
---
That‚Äôs an interesting idea, but the cost per hr would differ based on bars which would be unfair.
---
Thanks!
---
They can hit hella hard though so it's not very afk
---
Yep, I‚Äôll clarify that in the next post haha
---
Same here. Base 90s with 99 range and rig and aug. and 300m bank. I want to find a clan that knows i will suck at the beginning but then I‚Äôll become addicted and get like 2k kc Cox. 
---
Any clans out there ?
---
Imagine mods being able to "shadowban" accounts, or poison them so they can't actually trade or exchange any goods generated on their account.
---
Yeah please don't put Yu-Gi-Oh in osrs wtf
---
Lmao, you‚Äôre like one of those kids who say their dad works for jagex
---
Thank you! It definitely took a longer time than the others haha
---
Wow, 100 glories? That's almost a whole vork trip. New moneymaking method discovered, camping fountain of rune for 10 hours.
---
Stabby McStab Face
---
This is only far fetched because you're a mid level player.
---
Bruh get that auto vial smash toggled on, don't even give them that
---
4k+ damage in a single hit is only 400 legacy or 40 OSRS damage. This even goes without saying that the tiers of weaponry in RS3 go way higher than they do in OSRS, and with that in mind "40 in a single hit" doesn't seem too implausible
---
Ban happy plebbit admins
---
Idk cuz we got a kodai wand and sanguenisti staff from raids 1 and 2 so...
---
Hello. I agree with this. In fact, I asked this question and they answered it on the QA a couple of weeks back, though I think there was some confusion as to what I meant exactly. Here's the vod:

---
If a Jagex employee sees this, the issue is the requirements, not the actual weapons themselves. At lvl 85-90, the damage output would make sense in relation to the requirements.
---
If you're going to kill Vorkath, i'd recommend getting a DHCB. It's a massive improvement over BP. Meeleing is even cheaper and pretty much just as good with lance/full bandos.
---
Purchase GP with IRL money. Then purchase bonds with said money.

lavas nowadays peak at 12m/hr per runner and only require 75 rc, but i highly doubt anyone (especially someone with an ironman flair, lol) was running lavas for 60+ hrs/week at near-peak prices
---
I'm the same way. I was doing it to get the prospector outfit for the bonus exp, but the fucking time wasted there completely negates the small margin of exp you save wearing it (unless you're going for like 200m)
---
Got fed up, didn't buy the torso, plopped on Varrock torso instead, stepped 2 steps to the iron ores nearby, and power mined my way to 75.

ye?
---
What are these bots doing necessarily? Do they punch at anyone who their pker boss wants?
---
ahhh shit i was close. Thanks for the specifics :)
---
Noone cares about irons
---
No
---
Yes, but it would be something like finding the max bars per hour for each type, and set the cost for each bar so that all tiers are equal cost per hour
---
Last time I checked, I could run through spider webs

A bit meta perhaps, but why do these posts always get around 50/60% upvotes? Who is downvoting players asking questions? :/

No, he only clicked once. The one click directed him to run around to take the shortcut, which is the point of the post.

Well you said it‚Äôs been at least a month. It‚Äôs been less than two weeks.
---
Lets be real, your character is a psychopath regardless. Or at least a person with some *very* loose morals.
---
Had very similar experiences on my main and iron both. My main I ended up doing wilderness agility to 60.
---
I'm fine with that, honestly
---
I spent most of my bank to get the crossbow. It‚Äôs far and away the best improvement in dps for a single item. I‚Äôm slowly buying back my gear as I afk here.
---
Eh, you need the outfit at some point for the Falador diary anyway, so its still worth getting 
---
+ its also a Master clue req, if thats your kinda thing
---
You sir, are a genius
---
Who knows, we can only 16 pets, but that doesn't mean every pet is from a bot nor that how many other bots are there that don't have a pet
---
Exactly. The only reason for level requirements to even exist at this point is for pk builds, and tbow and scythe are totally useless in pvp so there is no reason to change their level req.
---
by release
---
Also (and I've never loved this line of argument, but its interesting to think about at least) if the cannon was polled today it would get eviscerated.
---
"Hey guys we've got this item locked behind a quest with no requirements that can like double your slayer xp/hr, how's that sound?"
---
You mean my standard melee gear? Wouldn‚Äôt that lower my accuracy?
---
As an Ironman, more ways to get rune scim is cool
---
To be honest, it's clich√©d. I don't like choice of boots in terms of fashionscape - even when they are best-in-slot melee boots, they look clumsy and uncomfortable.
---
My personal thoughts, critique and opinions: I'd use Shayzien armour by experimenting different tiers and armour pieces. Cape is the main object and choice of helmet and shield are nice choices. Staff in the other hand isn't very appealing to my eye. I would go with Dragon cane or Dragon hasta instead.
---
Those were my basic thoughts without intervening too much with your ideas (I hope). Hopefully I didn't offend you with (brutally) honest feedback. \^\^;

Hey aberrett, I hope you have a wonderful day.

You can also switch to fire wave at the very least or bring some mind rune for fire strike and set it to auto-cast the NPC. Then you x-log. Easy.
---
I‚Äôve always thought the cannon was pretty bullshit OP. The fact that I can create an account and within like 2 hours be hitting 30s kind of breaks progression up.
---
Idea is people usually watch streams, work, or just fucking fap on the side while clicking on something once every 2 to 30 seconds.
---
Plus there's mobile.
---
It's not healthy but you can definitely plan out some afk shit to do in the background of most stuff.
---
Followed!
---
How does disagreeing with an upcoming change make you an EHP nerd? Isn‚Äôt the entire point of OSRS that the community has opinions on content changes?
---
Thanks! I think I‚Äôm gonna grind a little bit more before attempting jad again. I‚Äôm gonna get my defence above 70 and also my prayer up to 60 and range up to 80 and also save up for veracs just to be safe.
---
Could maybe make the boss drop an item that unlocks the toggle or something
---
Yah it's often more efficient to spend the time money making rather than money saving
---
I also learned the magers can melee the hard way lol
---
It's still a click every couple seconds, which is about as intensive as non-zeah rcing. Just less lenient with mistakes
---
You can still easily watch something on the side while you do it, though
---
Do you even know how many innocent guards I slaughtered with a cannon for ranger boots?

Should I mine the mithril ore or buy the ores to smelt?

Yeah trying to stay 1 def, just though id make it a bit more of a challenge but later on in the game once ive got enough to fund new accounts ill level up my defence.
---
Didn't bury his bones reported
---
Nice example
---
1 kill per trip, MAYBEE 2 is not worth it when you can just grind zulrah/other moneymakers getting respectable amounts of kills and then with dhcb always get 5-6 kills per trip. you also never bother with bgs spec with dhcb.
---
No. Slayer is slow to level up, and there's no problem with that.
---
Runecrafting is mind-numbingly repetitive, click-intensive, _and_ it's fucking slow.

What does that have to do with anything?

If you own an herb sack, kurasks are great. A lot of people dont pick up drops like harralander which can increase you money per trip drastically. I've picked up over 60k in others loot many a times there. That being said, without the herb sack, kuraska are shit
---
Save him, you madman
---
How the fuck is he going to do hp?
---
If you think that then you‚Äôre the brainlet. I can probably max in another 1-1.5 years or so casually playing but have no interest in attempting inferno. Anybody can max playing casually with enough time, especially with mobile. But doing inferno doesn‚Äôt help at all if you‚Äôre only goal is to max and requires actual trying, attention, and focus.
---
Because Jagex can't think of creative diary rewards that are useful while not being broken. Cue agility shortcuts that also happen to require 93 runecrafting, 85 smithing, and 96 fishing.

hmm i wonder why you havent been helped yet

I had the same done to me, but it takes them less than 24h to remove the ban, so it's not that big of an issue.
---
I dont donate anyways tbh. Thanks for the occult altar, gilded altar, and nexus tho

The elder god. Makes sense.

That's when they made it so you can't trade at the NMZ altar to combat essence runners and people getting decent rc xp

I once had a dream of dying on my HC. I don't even play a hcim.

Yea the sound thing really only works for Mage, you 100% have to watch the animation for Range. Sounds like you'll get it next time!

Lol aight
---
My pet RNG is insane, agility pet before graceful at lvl 42 doing canifis and phoenix at 13 kc.
---
Yeah, i think what theyre saying is that if you can bp at 70 but cant use addy darts till 80 that some people will wait till 80 instead of using mith darts effectively making bp a tier 80 wep?
---
DS2 totally sucks. And newschool methods are so repulsive. ima stick with the abyss/astral route.
---
Are you gonna do the GE for imp catcher?
---
&gt;Making the tbow and scythe higher tier weapons would open up the tier 75 and maybe 80 (depending on the tier tbow and scythe would become) for new weapons that would not be as strong as those 2
---
Ok. What is issue wit making new items Tier 75  that are not as good as  Tbow/Scythe that would not be a problem if sythe/tbow would be T90?
---
Hey Euryhus, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
? I've literally never seen anyone in the basement area use guthan's (though I did block them at 87 slayer). If you think 75 slayer is an notable achievement I feel bad for you
---
it wont be as useful simply because verzik exists, and it will be the pre bis before scythe. Where as now, the rapier is only useful for inefficient slayer training and a VERY few meh bosses.
---
Hey kamil1210, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
The best approach would be to enter the rift closest to your character, based on where you spawn in the Abyss. East -&gt; Death. West -&gt; Nats.
---
You then didnt get good exp/h because marks of grace drops are time based. 
---
If you were getting a mark on every other lap that means your laps were around 2 to 3 minutes.
---
Jagex needs some inventive to ban bots. Maybe 10k xo to a skill of your choice when you successfully report a real bot. I would be tearing up the bot farms for some agility xp
---
Maybe he disconnected? Rather than AFK?
---
horrible advise. He should use dps gear since he's blowpiping. there's no need at all for tank gear, just bring some sweets and a few brews.
---
Knife-ears aren't people
---
Yeah dude \*alright
---
Hey meesrs, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
What helm is that
---
I was killing wyrms last night and saw a guy in full dragon (legs and chest I should say), dragon hunter Lance, whatever the orange amulet is (sorry just recently returned), and all this other top tier gear ....with a rune kite. 
---
Claimed he had "rich friends"
---
It's a very big investment but in the end it's worth it, plus you can use the account to duo with your main at bosses like armadyl/zammy slayer tasks or any future content that gets released. Definitely not something for a casual player but for people planning on maxing out you're basically making an extra mill or so an hour while you runecraft on your main or whatever.
---
yeah that is very true. I'd assume this new blade will be very expensive at first, but it will still be alot more sought after than the rapier. After a month or so, I'd assume most of the rich bois will be swapping their rapier for the new blade, which will cause the rapier to drop. The rapier I would say would be alot more fitting as a \~50m weapon.
---
You mean omnia who wants to join hexis in 2019
---
Like how you censored your name but made sure we could still see the Iron man icon.
---
1.3m/h is pretty bad compared to pvm (Vork/Zulrah 3-4m/h, Raids 5-10m+/h) etc
---
Conspiracies are for pseudo-intellectual reality deniers.
---
what are you talking about not overwhelmingly better, just the heal alone makes it much better, let alone the max hit
---
Yeah we‚Äôve discussed that.

you can do raids1 with a basic 50m setup.
---

Deerstalker hat. Technically it‚Äôs not even a helm. Did it for fashionscape purposes - explains why I failed
---
50 auto-bot responses per minute? Nuke this bot.
---
Its not really a solution, people with 80 Range aren't going to be using Rune or Dragon Darts for anything, and if they are, they shouldn't be.
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs a pretty good pker he just takes uncalculated risk for content purposes.
---
Chad melee and range helms vs the virgin magic hood.

I went afk in the desert doing a clue and totally forgot about it, logged back in with 11hp. I probably wouldn't have even figured out how I died, was pre 2007 so would've lost most of my stuff.
---
How? You travel through most of 40-50 wilderness. Even getting to the mage arena bank you would have gotten a warning. Every lever and teleport warns you about the wilderness, and so does the ditch
---
Pros:
---
*find open training/resource spots
---
*activity worlds. Most mini games require other people. These worlds help find people to play with
---
*better ping (depends on server)
---
*meet other people
---
Cons:
---
*your grave stays on the world you died. If you forget what world you died on it can be challenging to find.
---
*worse ping (depends on server)
---
Haha i know they did a sick job just bantering m8

You‚Äôre totally right but being a slight dick devalues your valid points to a lot of people.

Thank you for the advice. I created this account a long time ago and every time i try and log in now it tells me to wait because i've had too many failed attempts recently, that's how i know that they're still trying. Should i make a new email to attach the account to or something like that? will that stop them? thank you
---
The point is going way over your head here man. If you thought bots were such an easy thing to completely eradicate don‚Äôt you think they could‚Äôve done it in the 20years that rs has been alive? And yea I‚Äôm not disagreeing that new player experience is important but it‚Äôs just a problem you‚Äôre going to have to deal with when you‚Äôre playing a free version of the game. I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you man. Osrs is as strong as it‚Äôs ever been regardless of the amount of bots in f2p and in you‚Äôre specific case you already expressed that you‚Äôre not even interested in purchasing membership. I just don‚Äôt understand why you think you deserve to be catered to when you have no interest in paying for a service. The free to play game isn‚Äôt designed to be played for a long term it‚Äôs designed as a trial. When asking about bots multiple people have already pointed out that it‚Äôs almost a non-issue in members worlds. Trust me if there was an easy fix for this I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve already implemented it and I don‚Äôt like that there are not farms on f2p but it‚Äôs just something you‚Äôre gonna have to deal with because you‚Äôre playing for free. Also I highly doubt you‚Äôve been playing since ‚Äúsome of us have been breast fed‚Äù you realize that the majority of players if osrs are long time players right? I‚Äôm willing to bet the average age is somewhere in the 20s and most people here have been playing for over a decade, myself included. As it stands right now osrs is doing better than it ever has in the 6 years it‚Äôs been out. If you want no more bots go p2p is 11 bucks a month. If that‚Äôs not an option I don‚Äôt know what to tell you anymore.

If you can afford the staff youre not worried about the supply cost.
---
I personally wouldn't do the farming guild spot unless you don't have a jewelry box with the skills necklace (the second tier I believe) in your poh. The jewelry box offers unlimited teleports to the guild. I have one in brimhaven and my other at port sarim, but the port sarim one is less important because a cabbage patch or draynor tele will get you pretty close to that spot. Also, if you can, definitely get one in your house. As someone else mentioned it doesn't count as your of your trees planted, and it's super nice to have. If not there's always a tree in the NE cprner of the GE.
---
Addy darts having a higher range req would cost Ppl to spend more in scales while training with weaker darts :^)

i‚Äôll check it out
---
Ohhhh lol thought it was some rs3 skill me big dumb.
---
What happened in Feb? Been taking a break if anyone cares to explain these
---
Indeed
---
Agility is considered AFK because it's the same click positions every time with no rng.
---
I can understand where the confusion comes from for new players as Agility is actually not very afk pre-60 (or even 85) as Canifis is really short click distance for everything, and even Seer's is pretty short. This is not the case for high level agility at Ardougne agility course.
---
In the Ardougne agility course, it's an extremely low amount of clicks per hour and unlike Seer's there is literally no rng, no staminas needed, no menu swapping, etc.
---
Considering the level of someone who will be rich enough to make either a raids or RDA, it is very reasonable to say that their main will be at or near the level of doing Ardy agility by the time that alt is finished (would take 2-5 weeks of NMZ regardless).

\-while doing other things 
---
100% apologize my dude, forgot this was a game you play in the background like all those idle phone games
---
At raids it doesn't help you maintain supplies because olm doesn't take many supplies, but it increases dps a fair amount by preventing you from using brews
---
You can walk there m8
---
The beginning
---
Do you understand the concept of a job? Runescape is not a job.
---
Yea people might spend a few days training with mith darts from 75-80 (which,  by the way, is less gp/xp than addy darts), but after they hit 80 then nothing has changed.
---
If saying I can do something in a video game faster than most people is the weirdest flex you've ever seen then I think you need to get out there more. Live some life, experience some stuff.

Because my flex is nowhere near the "wierdest" flex.

Nevermind that it's OP. The real sin of the cannon is that it's fucking annoying for anyone not using one. "Here, I see you're already killing dagannoths in the lighthouse, but let me just plop my cannon in the middle and make YOU hop instead of finding a new world."
---
It's actually cancer to deal with. Especially for ironmen where in a single-combat zone, the cannon will randomly hit something in the next room and do damage to it, so you can't kill it anymore becaues you don't get the drop.
---
Slayer guy
---
How could you possibly know this
---
Trading it over from your main when you're making a pure for PKing purposes, I guess.
---
Oh I'm sure you can tell alot from a few post on an internet forum. Sometimes reddit is just as hive minded as Facebook xD what a community of people.
---
~~God Ash~~ Mod Zamorak

Why? The point is to show the flawed logic by using an extreme example that is still consistent with the logic.

He should use bp regardless of other levels. The extra dps massively outweighs the lost defence

Decent prayer and HP helps

77.4m for it all.
---
6k players does not get you on the top 100 sadly.
---
They only matter if you are casting the god spells (sara strike, claws, flames). If you cast charge, then wearing the same cape as the spell you are using boosts the base damage of the spells from 20 to 30.
---
I mean, yes and no? You can buy BiS but having a TBOW doesn't mean you can do ToB/CoX/Infernal without learning. And you can buy the fastest exp possible in skills but you still have to go through the bankstanding and/or carpal tunnel. And then there are skills that you can't buy, like mining and agility.
---
Have you tried typing ::hideroof in the chat window? I used that command and I haven't had an issue with the toggle sticking between sessions.

I have 8 accounts that hold all this.

I‚Äôm on board. It seems a little odd to have all end game content all with the same exact level required, especially one that caps 24 levels below the max level

Why not?
---
Yea you should be fine.

Fantastic job!

more people would probably flood in with mobile, and it would be fun to see fortnite bumped to 3, or potentially to 4 with another game

Tried to walk, but i can't get Thorugh Paterdomus Temple? :/ Only lvl 34 agility

Alright, might try that :D
---
that pose is brilliant
---
He really shouldn't be out of sight though right? Unless there's some luring method I don't know of, I usually just out dps dealers with bp
---
I know you're getting a lot of mixed advice about tank legs vs d hide, so I'll offer my suggestion, which is what I personally do on low level accounts: Blessed d hide legs with a tank legs switch that you only use when tanking a ranger and praying against a mage.
---
Server aren't like some others mmorpg. In OSRS they're called "world",
---
When you first connect to a world, you don't belong to this world, you can "hop" from one to another when you want. I think their is a restrictions of 10 hop in 5 minutes ( if you do more then that, you'll be logged out for 5 minutes, no big deal ).
---
Basicly world are just real server base on some place around the world. So you'll get a better receiption from a server in NYC if you live near NYC.
---
If you're talking about private server tho, avoid these thing if you just started OSRS, they are kinda like modded copy of the game and in my opinion, will ruin the experience for you.
---
Just to let you know wrath runes at 95 RC varies from 1.7 to 2m an hour. There‚Äôs no abyss involved and the xp rate is just a bit better
---
Yeah I'm getting like 25k~ at 68 at ZMI.
---
I'm getting like 25k at ZMI at 68, I might just be banking in a way that isn't optimal maybe.
---
What would the market response and subsequent impact on raids be like though? Clearly the price would drop dramatically because both the demand would drop and the # of people using the weapons would drop so the possibility of lost Tbows, for example, would drop. Given that these are some of the most expensive items in the game the possibility of market shock seems highly likely and should be accounted for if this were to be done. Not saying artificial market controls, but the secondary impacts on everyone else are an important consequence to consider.
---
You have an hour to pick up your items. You can never pick up anybody else‚Äôs items
---
Pretty sure they're specific to your country

Overload boosts your stats every 15 seconds, if you time it right you can keep full boost for every hit while brewing.

Just don't walk into Crip territory.
---
Fair points. I don‚Äôt think it should necessarily rival tbow/scythe as in it will out-DPS tbow at Olm and scythe at Verzik because that would be quite ridiculous. But seeing how both rate weapons are BiS for their raid bosses, maybe if a new mage weapon could be BiS at raids 3 final boss that would give it plenty of love already
---
I‚Äôm thinking something along the lines of a similar upgrade from rapier to scythe, for this new mage weapon compared to the sang staff
---
leave the room or teleport out you whimp
---
Thanks so much for this detailed response. I completely forgot about the infernal pickaxe. Dragon it is
---
Wtf
---
Isabelle?
---
Get higher stats
---
Use a defender with a better weapon and cape. Make sure you use a super combat and piety. Run behind the pillar to avoid special attacks. Use specs.
---
non-degradable, everyone wants it, more new players reaching mid/late game.
---
Why is it a shame
---
execute order 66.
---
I like the crystal bow for tagging healers, but for the main caves I can usually get by with going long range on the blowpipe assuming tanky armor.
---
Whoever keeps making these Cartoon Network crossovers thank u
---
i have everything but the cape, as far as i understood from reading the wiki this was the best gear setup for bursting maniacal monkeys i could currently afford, i'm probably wrong but i'm only 2 levels away from my goal of 90 anyway so the hat and bracelet are getting sold immediately after that :)
---
I wish I could just tape a Dragon Dagger to my cat so I can instaspec the rat.
---
It's not allowed per se but the players that lure dont get banned so it effectively is.
---
Really? That‚Äôs a good price for it to play flawlessly
---
I just wanna be the hero of my own story...while eating ice cream playing osrs
---
It's basically only used for pking, so there just isn't much demand. There are very few occasions in pvm when 1-hit 'whack' weapons are desired. I don't think there is much that could be done in make the price go back up
---
10/10 would recommend. Even improving gear more like d def.
---
Yeah?
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄEpic Games is powerless against OSRSü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
With 77/80 magic for charge it‚Äôs super easy
---
Doing cabin fever so I can get a black mask on my ironman.
---
*laughs in uBlock*
---
This is the response I was looking for. I still think the defense bonus is worthy.
---
In your setup the hat only provides accuracy not a max hit. Might as well just get an ahrims hood
---
Great in PvP (doesn't rely on specs) and great in the niche uses it has in PvM (Tekton for example) it's just not as necessary of an item as other things hence the lower price - it's still strong
---
all you redditors go to insults grow up lol. so you dont care that every update to certain things helps scammers and bots immensely
---
Can confirm and glowsticks
---
well you better dont
---
Why
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/lPprdvv
---
Yeah the people who say jagex has poor account security simply have poorly secured accounts. They just need to make a new random email with random password and secure that and it‚Äôs near impossible to hack into accounts.
---
read above u can answer to that to you all have no brain tbh you dont care that everything they do helps scammers and botters more then us
---
Exactly you can't be "anything". Otherwise a lot of us would be running around as crabs still right now.
---
Why does wearing barrows gloves make a task more or less fun?
---
I can't even get to 50. Runecrafting might literally be the most boring part of any game I've ever played.
---
fortnite has been getting boring anyway, no surprise
---
Right, it's a dating *GAME*.
---
That's why I said except the combat spice.
---
And if by half the skills of the yellow spice you mean only agility then yeah I agree with you.
---
Osrs doesn't have tiers tho
---
That's an rs3 thing
---
Bandos&gt;barrows
---
Dwh&gt;bgs
---
Claws&gt;ags
---
Ranges&gt;blessed boots
---
And there's so many more
---
Y'all are screaming for tiers to be fixed when that really hasn't been a thing in osrs.
---
Dude, how fuckin lazy are you. Barraging tasks is such fast, easy xp already just be happy they changed it so that your autocast sticks after switching weapons.
---
Does Bryophyta still drop the rune full helm?  Its not on the wiki but a few months ago it was confirmed as a f2p drop by Mod Ash.
---
Also should be buffed with new sword coming out.  Nothing broken though just give it a special attack.
---
Yoo i just saw you on 304, you said you weren't the main man... Knew it was you ;)
---
The magician looking guy btw.
---
Also sick lil thing you got going on :)
---
If you create something and someone else use it and then is who people think about that thing, I would say it's a shame.
---
Why is the best way to get this cooked fish killing vorkath and not fishing?
---
no problem
---
Had a nightmare zone run ended early because my locator orb stopped working, any idea on why it happened and how to fix it?
---
Works fine after I died but I don't want to waste more potions in the future because of it happening again.
---
But you're wasting time eating is his point.
---
Those ticks eating are like 3 auto attacks
---
Anyone have 300k?
---
Stop complaining about meaningless internet points
---
The fancy boots are basically iron boots plz stop using them especially when you're wearing graceful
---
Customer support filled my ticket in one day. What are you smokin?
---
Now imagine doing it pre-bp days
---
&gt; Just see color 4head
---
Being able to see scammers inventories only helps out scammers DansGame
---
You've got the cause backwards -- it's basically only used for Pking precisely because it's so awful elsewhere.  The problem being presented is, "It's only used for Pking, and is mediocre there, it could really use a buff -- " and everyone is responding with, "Well, it's still (only) used for pking."  That's a symptom of the problem.
---
Keep the yellow spice to boost thieving for western hard diaries
---
They just respawn 
---
If you talk to the king he says it's good training for them since they just come back to life.
---
Update: you just have to start the quest to enter the city, which you cannot enter without having started the quest.
---
Tassies pls someone
---
Anyone have 100m ? I‚Äôm not poor I just want 100m
---
&gt; even if it‚Äôs sarcastic
---
Unfortunately this guy didn‚Äôt get a second chance it seems lol
---
Think of your player as having an attack cooldown that decreases by 1 every tick, and you can only attack if the cooldown is &lt;= 0. Attacking with a whip would set it to 4 since its a 4t weapon. Eating most foods other adds 3 to this timer. This timer can reach as low as -3. So if you attack with a whip, wait 4t, then eat an angler on the 5th, it will delay your next attack by 2 ticks. If you waited 7t and then ate on the 8th, you could eat the angler and attack in the same tick. 
---
The only time its really useful to delay hits is if youre brewed down while melee hybridding and need to restore in order to mage them. You can use the down time between brewing and restoring to eat an angler again since you cant attack at that time anyways. 
---
Normal foods delay 3t, karambwans and some gnome foods delay 2t, and potions have 0t delay for attacking, but a 3t delay before you can eat again (excluding karams)
---
Don‚Äôt type and pk
---
Everything popular or mainstream is resented here.
---
correct. this is older than christianity, and serves no purpose other than to clog the sub even further.
---
Big reason I haven't done firecape is flashbacks from when I was a kid. Is it much harder than Galvek from DS2?
---
seems legit
---
Lel
---
Didn‚Äôt he get a solo scythe too?
---
It all comes down to if you're more focused on exp or money. I want exp; I'm going for 200m so I do torstols. I make 200k gp in 6 minutes and that nets me 20k farm exp. I know I could kill vorkath once and get 200k gp, but I rather get 20k exp and money.
---
Not if you're left handed
---
80s are mid level.
---
You're probably best pking zammy wine bots or doing barrows.
---
got my first 60 attack up there and promptly picked flax for 100k to buy a d longsword
---
Really sad how with the GE there could be an easy dichotomy between PvMers and Skillers. Instead of Skillers making money off the backs of PvMers, PvMers get to be self sufficient without putting any effort or gp into their supplies.
---
Can confirm.
---
Ty for the tldr. Just couldn't be asked to watch it which is simply because I'm lazy. 
---
Gz on 25m and ty for stats :)
---
I said I instantly reposted the post before reading he was okay you dumb ass why would I bother checking instead of reposting and helping this guy if he needs help. Like I said kid just stop making yourself look a fool.
---
Sir pugger said in a video the bots ARE banned almost daily, yet reappear. Theyre simply super easy to set up.
---
Add Gorgons pls
---
Yikes dude I was just copying the sigh from you but okay rofl
---
The "nutting in Nieve" pose
---
Takes 2 seconds to delete but you saw it and went oh good way to get karma lemme post on the runey subreddit
---
Yeah me too pls
---
A Gorgon boss that travels down hallways could be really cool. You would have to navigate around and try to avoid facing it.
---
As far as I know OSRS is number 49 on the top charts whereas fortnite is number 5 on the App Store.
---
No, you weren't, don't try to change your verbiage when you know your previous behavior was called out. I sighed because of the situation, I explained why you sighed. 
---
Don't worry, thank god you'll never talk to me ingame right?
---
Now grow the fuck up and lose that ego shit.
---
I would date someone named dabscape
---
They already updated to remember your attack on staves.
---
For real, I can't fucking wait for the battle royale genre to die so I actually have something to play other than Runescape.
---
actually a nice vid dude
---
But it doesn't cost 200k/h to use which is probably the biggest reason the weapon is bullshit right now.
---
Yep sure did kid ima leave it up for people to see how much of a wanker you are :) enjoy oh and whoever reads this downvote my post for the karma :D
---
good at pvm maybe.
---
...sigh
---
Their marketing team said that these shitty and low effort ads actually do a better job at attracting players than well made ones.
---
No problem man:D thanks:)
---
Is being a stronger tentacle whip that doesn't degrade not good enough?
---
goes to the behemoth's looks away for 1 second your cat just died :/
---
blast mine is a very reasonable alternative for people who hate the skill and don't want to learn granite.
---
Thank you:)
---
TzTok-Chad has no time for your shit
---
Go find some tits to play with and forget about RuneScape for a while
---
Sell something for blowpipe and sell it when done. Blowpipe makes the whole cave waaaay faster and the extra dps means less chance of fucking up jad.
---
Local man wants to feel good about being 50k dry lol
---
Sometimes i check Oatrix newest guides, maybe i can take something of a more effective way to train skill than i think. But now i decide make alt account and tried to make 3lvl skiller(at this moment f2p, need to make at least 50-60 levels to make p2p and gain), that's why i check 3lvl progression roads(suddenly now lvl3space which are 1.5y/o and probably a something changed thats why will check someone else but still main base are same).
---
Ah cheers
---
It happens to the best of us.
---
Lynx Titan much be so bad at the game then.
---
For me it‚Äôs either the goblin death sound or the ice barrage
---
Skilling has always been a useless activity.
---
There needs to be a way to balance PvM drops and put more value on gathering/production skills.
---
That‚Äôs why I take my laptop to work. Working is XP waste and wintertodt isn‚Äôt gonna grind itself.
---
Probably the goblin atk sound just for the percentage of players that have heard it.
---
This is actually a good shout to update this. I, always need to drop something for the first few kills or leave loot on the ground and if I was to ever need to idle for 2mins I'd lose it.
---
More of an inconvenience because I'd never drop/leave anything of high value, but still annoying nonetheless. Would support this :)
---
Lynx just had dedication, it doesn't require skill to get 200m xp just a few million mouse clicks
---
buddy is in for a suprise
---
Yooo this is fucking sick bro! Do some more like these. Lit af :D
---
&gt; This is by far the weirdest flex i have ever seen *on this sub*  
---
You, my friend, need to learn to read more.
---
Start over mate.
---
You‚Äôll get ragged on by perfectionists.
---
meanwhile im stuck with 3 god hide coifs and they all are junk lmao
---
Thank you : ) Is mining iron ore at the guild and then banking them just as good as powermine you think? the bank is so near!
---
I wouldn't even be that mad if your other uniques weren't horrendously low as well fuck. 
---
I had more than this by 1300 and I've ran out of scales pvming.
---
That‚Äôs stupid....
---
Nty
---
2 ways, drift net fishing
---
sell your abby dagger, buy a blowpipe and get your firecape and then start working on berserker ring (i)
---
I would go for more boss tasks and clips of superiors; go for more of a challenge then easy tasks. Like the garg boss instead of gargoyles. By all means though it‚Äôs your video make it whatever makes you happy. I‚Äôm just saying things I like to watch. Also if you get a clue go run it and show what you got from casket reveal.
---
So you guys dont hate it?(is thre platform cross server's or something similar
---
My biggest issue is that I have 3 (almost 4) kids and I CONSTANTLY have to go afk when I play to tend to them. This boss is an absolute pain to kill because of the 2 minute kick timer
---
wtf this is amazing
---
If we‚Äôre being honest here our version of the game is 6 years old. As it stands rn osrs would be likened to a private server in 2007.
---
Holy shit, I see why you got muted lol
---
Before the GE a decent amount of skilling was relevant. It could have been even more relevant after the GE for profit if PvM drops weren't meant to replace your time skilling.
---
Jesus lol i killed cyclopses for 10 hours
---
would be nice
---
Yeah this quest is a pain in the ass but I think regicide is even worse so wait till you do that
---
Ditch nmz and train through slayer
---
Print screen?
---
I know I will be getting to it.... eventually lol

Green dragons are some of the top GP / hour for regular mobs . But yeah stats don't matter for konar. Until 85+ slayer or so do konar for GP or you won't get much out of slayer

I will try my best :3

That's how i feel and that's why i'm doing everything i can too try and get somebody that want's to help the player's to see this. I don't think this warrants a perm ban at all.

Trooooogdooooooor

Distro?
---
I mean, it's pretty easy to aggro them all before they heal him, and then killing them is no big deal cause they aren't healing him
---
The katana is pretty damn rare clue item this is dope
---
Yep, thats what you are there to do
---
Too be honest I‚Äôm not sure it said the email was changed to eradicated69@hotmail.com and that if it wasn‚Äôt me to click the link it said it was sent by jagged and redirected me to the website, when I logged in it just sent me too the forums page and nothing else, I just tried logging in with my own email and it worked and I just added google authenticator, I‚Äôm just checking my account every hour now to see what happens, what‚Äôs even weirder is the person would know my pin aswell because I bank everything and all my stuff was in my inventory and my bonds used
---
Potion guy next door too ;)
---
There was way back when godwars was first released the idea was breakeven/lose gp if u don't hit the unique table. Then we got zulrahs stupid drop table and buffed wyverns. Now everyone cries my gp/hr no good buff everything. Or when rev uniques fail and the gp/hr target value is passed we get resource drops and what not to supplement the drop table.
---
Skilling has not always been a worthless activity. Someone didnt play before the 10k slayer updates
---
Insurance making the difference. It‚Äôs still dumb as fugggg.
---
I had a dude let me go after I told him I was doing a clue. In return I‚Äôve voted for pvp updates in his honour since.
---
Well? How about a good cock slap? I assume you didn't say anything because you're a scared little bitch
---
 I did this quest with 14 agility. Took me about 6 hours
---
You can't change your account email though cN you? Just your email that jagex will communicate to you with
---
I can only think of Sire, can you name anything else?

You discredited your first line with the second.

That's essentially Bloat is it not?

You should see the price drop!

This could be a post in /rniceguys

The way I thought Ash responded I didn't think he meant only gear would be moved to your inventory for some reason oops

He's clearly jumping over the Shilo Village River after completing the Karamja elite diary.

I used imbued heart and serpentine helm it helped me a ton getting my first kill
---
I know you guys are talking shit and meming in the comments, but I am a returning player and I was actually using the wrong client lmao.
---
&gt; the email was changed to eradicated69@hotmail.com and that if it wasn‚Äôt me to click the link it said it was sent by jagged and redirected me to the website, when I logged in it just sent me too the forums page and nothing else
---
I'm about 90% sure that was a phising e-mail that you put your login info into.
---
I don‚Äôt know what this means
---
The people of the UK never agreed to join the EU, the people of the UK voted to leave the EU. Democracy is only honored when it goes the way of those in power.
---
Well you cant trade items off an account until they have 24 hour play time or 7qp. It could be a bot farmer setting his bots up with 24hr play time
---
Jeez you trumpster are pathetic. No one is crying besides your clown president on Twitter everyday.
---
It's OK you can be racist dude no one cares. You're not gonna accomplish anything in your life and no one cares about your miserable existence. So keep playing runescape and spending all day on reddit and let the rest of us fix the country your kind messed up k?

Can you please tell me which bosses and mode you used? I really want to go for 99 attack and strength.
---
Also, what was your setup?
---
I do with it was that easy.
---
??????????????? Try again. It def. Has a use for them
---
You really don‚Äôt even need to start with ranarrs. They don‚Äôt shine until your farming skill is up a bit and you consistently see larger yields. Limpwurts, harralanders and yanillian hops if you‚Äôre all in are all profitable with a much smaller cash investment for lower level accounts.
---
It's not as simple as that, the UK after joining developed its economy as a service based rather then a manufacturing one which relies on the EU it would be a hard job to negotiate a correct deal and I have no faith in the 2 main partys
---
Didn't know there was one. thanks :)

He has all day to get his stuff back. Dying doesn‚Äôt really matter as much as it used to.

Rune darts are almost never worth it.
---
ADDY DARTS VS RUNE DARTS Note: all prices are relevant to when this post was made. Future changes in dart and scale prices will impact the numbers below.
---
CPT = cost per tick DPS = damage per second TVC = time value correlation
---
CPT
---
CPT(rune) = (1079/5+169*2/3)/2 = 164.233gp
---
CPT(addy) = (140/5+169*2/3)/2 = 70.333gp
---
DPS
---
Sample: max setup against Zulrah's blue phase
---
DPS(rune) = 8.403801012
---
DPS(addy) = 8.052298008
---
Ratio of DPS(addy):DPS(rune) = 1:0.958
---
3600-0.958*3600 = 151.2 seconds
---
For every hour the addy dart user spends, the rune dart user saves 2 mins 31.2 secs.
---
TVC
---
3600/0.6 = 6000 ticks 3448.8/0.6 = 5748 ticks
---
CP6000T(addy) = 6000*70.333 = 421,998gp
---
CP5748T(rune) = 5748*164.233 = 944,011gp
---
The rune dart user is spending 522,013gp to save 151.2 seconds.
---
The rune dart user is spending 12,428,881gp to save 1 hour.
---
Unless your best moneymaker that you actually do makes over 12,428,881gp/hr, then rune darts are not cost efficient to use (this specific TVC value is unique to using rune vs addy darts at zulrah. Against lower def monsters this value will increase slightly. Against higher def monsters this value will decrease slightly.)
---
Burnanating the country side
---
You need qpc for lumby elite
---
Yeah I didn't like ZMI cos it's slow as well. Eventually I started doing more than an hour every day at lavas, just to finish off the grind. It should only be like a 10-12 hour grind, which isn't the worst thing in the world. You can do it!
---
This is an old chart.
---
Don't feel that way, these bots will all be banned after the weekend.
---
Also you should just play for your own personal enjoyment it doesn't really matter what other people do in the game as long as you are having fun :)
---
lmao fortnite is like the seven billionth title released within the battle royale genre. Massive pepega
---
Does anyone have suggestions for any relatively obscure drops from monsters that are 100% drop chance? Items you wouldn't have in your bank normally (aside from quests)
---
All that comes to mind is Rock and Elemental Ore from Earth Elementals and Monkey Corpse from Karamjan monkeys.
---
Something that wouldn't fit what I'm looking for would be something like 'Vial of Water' from Water Elementals. While it is a relatively unique 100% drop, it's still fairly common to have.
---
Thanks for any input.

in most situations you want to prioritize dps over defense
