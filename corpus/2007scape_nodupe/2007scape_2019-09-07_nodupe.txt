What a lost opportunity
---
---
---
Did you download it from runelite.net?
---
The WDR 150M setup and then as many upgrades on their gear progression as I could afford. DWH is next.
---
I’m scared of the attas bottomless yield bug
---
[removed]
---
Like shit in your pants?
---
It does not slow combats much, you get a damage and accuracy buff, obviously
---
Why didn't you just make a text post
---
I see this complaint a lot and I wonder why warding failed. 
---

---
Tis a shame. Would have been an interesting skill.
---
There is a world selector in the bottom cor er click on that and click on a ftp world (grey one i think) currently u have a members world selected by default
---
I bet op hoping this legit works on someone
---
Is this not the correct way to get a grill?
---
Not 100% certain but the shit he says definitely has the same asshole-elitist r/iamverysmart vibe on every comment.
---
I fucking hate everything about this
---
Gz you fucker
---
Gnome technology has gone too far.
---
Should have been deleted from the game forever
---
Now hes a permanent addition through the quest and you won't just see him once since he is in dom tower too. Where he is one of the most aids boss because he spends 70% of his time immune, whilst playing the sof sound effects.
---
Does it store in POH?
---
HD textures looked like ass sometimes though with the normal maps or something turned up to 11.
---
I don’t hate it
---
If that shelf falls on that screen from 1 minor earthquake it’s a wrapp
---
I have more birdnests than toadflax atm :/^)
---
But I still have a ton of seeds. If you keep up with birb runs you should eventually have more nests than toadflax.
---
Or at least that's what I've heard
---
Because I joined reddit 20 mins ago, and I posted on the runescape thread and was told that I should post here, but my phone wouldn’t allow me to copy and paste, so I screenshotted the previous post ... in a nutshell
---
Because we're afk and don't know if you started your ore five seconds ago or twenty. Therefore, I choose a new one.
---
Yes
---
So did you. :)
---
Ah the Reddit noob making solid suggestions again
---
Fairs.
---
I don't like Runelite. RS3 still sucks.
---
So kill them for upgrades? Obbies should never kill you. That or skip them or spec tab them sinces theres no penalty
---
Lmao
---
You’re wrong, Hopper. -Flik
---
Yes, like I said, efficiently.
---
Gz if true
---
I swapped to fertile soil since making compost is pretty yikes, and also spellbook swap for harmony island
---
I'd go kill cows
---
Ur so lucky with those drops I hope you know that
---
Fuck the under 100 boats
---
Gray's! I got mine at 82 farming, checking a Willow tree at the gnome stronghold wile banking on a Slayer task! 😂
---
I've had this happen. I just kept talking lol
---
Hi, that's actually from RuneScape 3. This sub is for Old School RuneScape, they are two different games!
---
Hardest will be when mage and ranger spawns at same time. Unless you're able to flick both of them you'll take some damage. Your stats are pretty low, so it'll be tough unless you *can* flick those 2 (and then use body blocking/trap the melee when all 3 spawn) so id prob practice for that.
---
Actual it’s blue coral lipstick number....
---
Lmao. I'm gonna do this
---
I’ve seen seerz do stuff like that, thanks for the advice! I’ll definitely research it. And yea I figured this would be rough with the stats
---
Oh snap, my bad fam. Thanks for the heads up.
---
The whoosh is real here lol
---
Isn’t the agility logo just the AOL logo?
---
Doing meds is your problem here. Well, not problem, get your farming up as fast as you can but it's not like you're doing something wrong or whatever. But it is probably why your toadflax seed economy isn't as good. You get less rolls of medium tier seeds (toadflax are there) than on hard.
---
From what I've heard, being mid level may get you around 10m. Granted, I don't know where you're starting
---
Take a break man, time for an alt account.
---
You can have one stack in bank and one in inv but not more than 1 in the same place no
---
I would totally buy the qp one.
---
Osrs hd please
---
I'm on same boat bud... I have now friends to celebrate with either
---
Grats! On a side note, Karils would be a better choice here since arma gives negative stats to melee offense (or just wear prossy and pray mage)
---
I move on the same ore if I see us move roughly at the same time. But not otherwise. Idk if that vein is about to run dry
---
The SGS still actually has a minimum heal acting as if you hit a 20 to heal 10 hp and 5 pray each time, so even if you whiff, 2 specs at least are guarenteed to restore at least 20-55 hp every 5 minutes which isn't too bad.
---
Oh interesting, just ran out of attas seeds myself after doing ultra+bottom+sec+attas for like 2 weeks, was getting a +5% yield avg over no hespori seed. Sample size of close to 100 runs
---
10/10
---
Slayer hate gang rise up
---
Easyscape
---
Just look at the bolts. This is fake.
---
Haha it’s funny because being gay is bad. Good joke
---
They do bandos on the weekends with friends
---
I think the SGS hits on the damage that it would have done, even if the monster would have been immune or if you would have overkilled a monster since there's times when i've been healed for the full 25 hp from hitting a 50 on a mob with 13 hp left i assume.
---
My Friend the whooosh is upon you
---
Damn... fuck you dude, 3100 kc, no pet, no jar, no vissys.... but I’ve got 50+ heads!
---
40 atk and like 70+ str will slap KO's with a r2h
---
High ranged equivalent or higher to your str lvl
---
DDS is always a 0 0, 0 2, 48 0, 4 8 though.
---
Don't tote no 22's, Magnum cost me twenty two
---
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for twenty two
---
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
---
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
---
Lmao rip. At least the slayer xp is nice from them
---
With that being said, you should still try Sire for a few kills to see if you personally enjoy it. If not, just switch back to regular Abbys.
---
Doesnt she already only have one hand?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the answers!
---
Advice for leveling up magic and crafting?
---
Yeah but there was still no point in not adding it. Tons of things in this game don't have an actual use and still get added. Atleast it would revive corp. I do agree there should've been a new sigil proposed tho.
---
I thought it looked worse at first, but it looks great especially when playing in fullscreen fixed mode
---
i got to 94 with just boots before getting the whole set at 97. Tome at exactly 20m exp
---
Gmaul pking has always been braindead. Its just people rushing their specs. But thats a good thing, gmaulers are literally the first pk build new players make. Making so you lose 1m everytime was the dumbest fucking idea ever.

---
You basically already beat the game. Log out in varrock square.
---
Get 60 range 50 str and 40 attack with 1 def and 25 mage at 42 cb. ( the mage can be trained without getting HP experience and is only for Varrock teleports)
---
Range 2h used to be a pretty lively cb bracket from 42-55 no idea how it is now a days but you always want to keep range 8-11 levels higher then strength to be range based and not melee based.
---
Idk, probably think it makes them look cool having an expensive item even though it's so easy to point out bond buyers by just looking at their stats and kc
---
You still have to run through the 'city' in RS3. Do you really want to make this easier then RS3?
---
How are you losing motivation WHEN YOU JUST STARTED
---
I understand that man cause I used to be so into it as well but eventually I got sick of the spec tabbing culture and decided to learn how to NH so I can get better loots while farming emblems.
---
LMS is great just keep going at it and don’t be discouraged by people who chat shit when you die, you’ll be good at in no time
---
Nice Burberry
---
check out the clan section on forums
---
I did this last night. Went from 3 qp to completing dragon slayer in like 3 hours. Just got back into the game afte not playing since before old school runescape was a thing lol. It’s still crazy how much they’ve added to this game. Loving it so far.
---
clues are already braindead easy with runelite, just walk to it
---
They released a strict no payment world (other than cosmetics) called Reboot some time ago.  It's essentially iron man mode; no trading and no FM.  It's the main world atm, beating out Scania by a large margin.  
---
Honestly, every class is the same at this point.  Everyone has full map attacks, and cant fit more than 1 person per map.  I'd kill for an official pre-big bang server.  
---
I'd like to raise you Warframe.  Riven mods with certain frames (Octavia, Banshee, Chroma, Mirage) exceed the damage cap and loop back around showing negative damage (damage is uncapped unlike Maplestory).
---
Absolutely none of those help prevent account recovery. Recovery is the single issue with security because there's no way to prevent it if your details are leaked.
---
And content
---
Thanks for the account random dude
---
I don't believe so. I believe the nuggets have a set drop rate of 1/36.5 regardless of any other factors.
---
I tried reboot, it's like any other p2w game where yes, you can do whatever you want without paying anything, but it's gonna take you fucking years to get up to someone else's level who spent money and got good in like, a day.
---
I dont understand how people dont get that it was just a joke...
---
I don't understand this comment when I see it. If anything it seems closer on resizeable, on fixed you have that whole ui thing in the way.
---
Friendly reminder we were promised an update on security progress by the end of August.
---
Why are you booing him, he's right.
---
I’m saving for rigour then going back for assembler I can’t wait
---
Thanks
---
What was your last item?
---
rule number 1 when pking is public chat off lol i learned that day 1 in edge. But yea I adapt really well to other games and usually reach high levels of play but it for sure is a massive curve. I'm looking forward to the climb
---
Is that under stretched? It doesn't seem to do anything on my game.
---
It will speed up your runs a bit. I do remember reading a Reddit post a while back, though, that had the math showing Iban's to be more profitable until your magic level was somewhere in the mid-80s iirc. It may be worth looking for
---
rigour is just basic efficency, but if you do vorkath a lot then yeah dhcb is a wise investment :P
---
Dont forget to use adblockplus boys :)
---
Well the solution to that would be 55% claws and ags spec those weapons are strong enough for the KO alone. I feel the gmaul was a victim when the other weapons still have the full potential with the only risk of being smited.
---
Fight bots with bots.
---
All depends on your stats, use this it will help you a lot 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64wtan/dps_calculator_by_bitterkoekje/
---
I don't think you tried Reboot.  There's no payment options in Reboot.  Like cubes specifically were moved to meso.
---
Might beat Galvek tonight, then MFwMA, SoTE, A Taste of Hope, and the Kourend ones is all I need.
---
I would argue the only one it doesn’t *really* slow is magic, since if you want max combats you can just dh in nmz, chin, and burst. But the buffs you get during slayer make it from a massive drop to an acceptable drop
---
Depends entirely, or at least mostly, on your farming level. You want to be able to get magic/yew seeds. The other skills being high for better resources also help, but not nearly as much gp/hr wise iirc.
---
I have 0 lol. But the eyes come from brimstone rings anyway.
---
Do you feel fear, android?
---
Had no idea he had a second channel and thoroughly enjoyed the last hour of my morning
---
pls gib info how do u do this is there a cc?
---
Chill out iron boy, I'm not playing on 1/10th of my monitor.
---
Quick sob aren't you
---
Ah shit....forgot about MM2, just need 4 more slayer levels for that haha
---
Yeah, just laying in bed watching videos. Wbu?
---
yikes
---
Ah rip
---
Aren't they community volunteers on twitter running that handle?
---
Except adding the authenticator to their website would remove the ability for someone else to remove it and would take maybe a week to implement. It's actually ridiculous this hasn't been done yet.
---
Obby is better for training on normal mode and more afk, Dharok post 87-93+ hp (Depends on what level you want, some people throw a hissy fit declaring it 88 or 89 or 92 or whatever etc for a literal +0.5% bonus each level), but anyways dharoks breaks much higher exp a hour post 90. Repair costs are pretty negliable imo though. Sure, you might be paying say 12k-22k a hour for repairs on barrows, but you'll also be getting much faster exp too and 95% of the cost will be on prayer potions anyways, and one thing people don't mention or think about, but fairly trivial is the bonus high def of dharoks vs obsidian and frequent repotting might help you save a few k worth of absorb potions a hour anyways so i'd say it'd even out.
---
let's unpack this
---
Yes it happens sometimes but not very often.
---
Ironmen should be permanently muted from the start so they can't even interact
---
It's kinda funny since yeah, it's training methods is basically: Mandatory Blackjacking, but with a ODHD 3 year old demon butler: The game, But it's also like 300k-600k exp a hour buyable only so you don't spend as much time as it, Still infuriates me that you can't lock down the demon butler to the spot though.
---
Where did you train until 90?
---
link pls
---
Are there any good spots that are worth it xp-wise? Sounds fun.
---
pvp
---
How can they stand alone if they speak to others?
---
I did a bit of mushrooms, but the tar monsters got way too infuriating so I moved to teaks in priff and also got like 200 crystal shards in the process.
---
That got me thinking combo mechanics through spec refresh would be interesting
---
I haven't laughed this hard in honestly I don't fucking know how long. It's so stupid but so fucking funny, please make more videos like this j1mmy.
---
Account security troll's are so fucking stupid.
---
Its a bot with automated responses for tweets that have certain keywords. You need to tweet at the Jmods themselves if you want help
---
It doubles the resolution of the GUI, but maintains the sharpness within the game itself... Do you have the GPU plugin off or something?
---
Venenatis with RoW(i) is pretty fast, I think its also better than barrows as you get more money and pet chance as well, even if its slower
---
Admit it, you've never even seen the Raimi trilogy you heathen
---
no
---
Aren't we all
---
You could probably do ok, one of you will take a lot of damage from the melee minion tho. 
---
Chinning is way higher dps than even tbow against kree. With 2 people you can have one switch aggro and the other just straight chin the melee minion (as long as the guy switching focus doesn't screw up) - possibly whoever isn't being attacked by melee minion can switch focus, if you both have the same ping.
---
Don't believe it ever does
---
80
---
Do you still have dial up to? Otherwise you are faking it still.
---
play a good game. i recommend splinter cell: chaos theory

He's got a lot of bullshit like this it's great.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiHEO7rwUFriDIRznvONzSQ
---
I believe you're correct about the post, but I would still disagree about trident always having more profit per hour than Iban's. My reasoning would be that at 75 magic, Iban's and the trident essentially have the same dps, however the trident costs ~ 38% more to use per cast. Trident maxes 20 every 2.4 seconds and Iban's 25 every 3. 
---
Iban's would have slightly more overkill, but I don't think it would be enough to skew profit per hour in favor of the trident. I'm sure the magic level where the trident pulls away isn't terribly high, but I don't think it would always be superior for profit.

No content above the surface

You can hang out as a guest in the discord and the cc in game while you get those 6 combat levels :). If you rush them should not take long!

Idk its unplayable to me in resizable. Fixed is the best imo
---
Is toadflax more profitable than ranarr? Hopefully I haven't been doing the wrong herb all this time because I'm 71 farming now lol

Invention

450kc and I've only gotten hilt. Tasseys of minion before but that doesnt show in the log.

I think your scroll bar had a stroke

They said to not expect it in 2019, but yeah. Could be Jan 1st
---
Warding did come with multiple quests.
---
do iron them if they didnt solo wintertodt
---
Gratz you piece of shit. Jk but not really
---
[deleted]
---
I agree but didn’t they do that exact same thing with the prereqs for SOTE? Made underground pass easier without telling anybody even though it was voted against
---
That’s surprisingly low. I thought more people enjoyed them. Especially if you can toggle it
---
Thought it might help grab healers during jad but I was too nervous to switch lol
---
Get to total level 31
---
Sweet justice served.

probably wont happen for another few years. mod atlas left jagex and i think he was the one doing the engine work.

Dbow spec is better but regular hit isnt

Outsourced labor to a non-English speaking country most likely.

I dont get it :/ everything is there all they need to do is add trade function for some select players... like what, 1 days work?

Thank you!

What gear did you use? I see you have chins and am confused lol
---
Great story grandma! loved those cookies
---
Nice
---
I got 3 garg superiors almost back to back (all within 50 kills) and got the heart on the last one. Happened about a week ago and I barely noticed because I was on mobile
---
I enjoy them for the most part. Out of the new ones, thought MM2/DS2 were fantastic. But Song of the elves was so tedious. Anyone agree?
---
With imbued heart magic is a bit lower then 94 though
---
Attack and strength are only 40 odd with no intention of raising them, only reason they are that level is for void until I get ahrims
---
[What its actually like coming back from resetting agro](https://i.imgur.com/o5KsseX.jpg)
---
Wouldn’t they just spawn in items then at that point or are you taking the employees? Definitely some sketchy stuff happening behind the scenes (tbow spawn, max cash glitch, etc.)
---
It's 13 million xp to 99. 1 million happens 73.
---
What planet did you come from Jesus
---
Idk FM was my only 99 on a new acc in a couple days because of the banter.
---
I was moreso following SmallExpLamp’s steps in which he recommends base 50, but I’ll probably do base 40 with a 50 in firemaking, cooking, fishing, and woodcutting and a 41 in mining for the rune pickaxe. Currently I’m running all my quests before I start working on those.
---
Why did you take a screenshot of your stats from before invention release if you started yesterday
---
No this isn't rs3 where a teleport or a shortcut needs to exist for everything.  Play the game enjoy doing clues and seeing parts of the game that you would never go to otherwise.
---
hes just a lil misinformed. there are volunteers who help out (all they do is link to stuff u can already find on the website), but this is the official runescape support.
---
Cop out answer: use divines so you are always at max boost.
---
If you don't want to spend the extra money on divines, I usually repot at +5 or +6, but it's up to you. You can also repot every time you kill 1/4th the task length of monsters if the task is longer.
---
If you want to really get the most out of it, check a dps calc, and repot just before you lose your second max hit. You could repot every time you lose just one max hit, but at that point, use divines.
---
I know thats why I called them cheap Chinese pricks
---
You understand *why* such a small minority can ovverule the larger number, right?
---
This game's default is to be a re-opened "2007 era" server to play from. People log in to play *that* over the new RS3.
---
If content is suggested, it has to be UNANIMOUSLY agreed on by the entire community- because you are *changing* that re-opened server.
---
Worst case scenario when a poll doesn't pass is that we're playing the game we fucking asked for.
---
Prob to switch gear all at once without thinking about it, click all the red for melee etc
---
You need to start bankstanding immediately.
---
Yes osrs is it's own game with different content. Priff is a very big elf city in the lore before it was added to rs3 and now osrs.
---
The lore of runeccape is the same up to 2007 lol. That was the Thanos snap and got different time lines
---
Osrs can add stuff with a different timeline basically.
---
Which is why the two elf series are different after regicide or whatever the last quest both games featured.
---
Same with morytania and the vampyres, etc.
---
RuneScape3 likes to do things on a much bigger scale with God's. Which is why most of their recent quests involve every god in the game and sliske trying to be the toolp dog mahjerat.
---
As osrs likes to release new content in regions have that osrs feel.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Ye I reread the charts again. I was tired as fuck and thought it was like 1.3 mil .-.
---
shit man I realized I needed the "transportation Incantations" book from the arceuus library and holy shit did I miss Runelite like a baby
---
Edit : for the Kourend Castle teleport
---
Thank u 4 ur service
---
It's 2019. If you want to do something on your computer, you probably can; it's just a matter of finding out how.
---
Good thing I'm not..I'm typing it into Jagex's java applet same as their client.
---
People forget that the worst case scenario for a poll not passing is that we continue to play the game we asked for.
---
Jay Z - 22 Two’s
---
I like catching salamanders and releasing them because they're worthless.
---
Why does Hunter exist?
---
How can a client even do that?
---
Most client features I see just give you information (like that one that told you how to pray for jad)
---
The only one that affects the actual game ive seen is menu entry swapper, and I'm not sure how they do that either tbh.
---
Bro just use the magnifier thats what i do
---
When I was going for my f cape I was honestly like this
---
Gz welcome to the official high level players club
---
Thats what I dont get.
---
Maybe it directly changes the game ala Menu entry swapper?
---
Do people really need this much customer service? I know it’s part circle jerk and part truth but it’s really not difficult to input your credit card and discontinue membership or secure your account in the first place.
---
Aww, the ironman is angry!
---
&gt; The Neitiznot Faceguard will be untradeable and will require 70 Defence and completion of The Fremennik Exiles to wear. 
---
Tradeable helmet?
---
&gt;do you not think the engine gets updated and that that could possibly break existing functionality? 
---
That is literally what i said in my first comment.

Can we start instant deleting photos taken with peoples phones please?. Just press fucking prnt scrn

Just don't get defence or your account will be ruined
---
Not everything needs to degrade. Primordials, rapier, avernic, barrows/ferocious gloves, Dihn's, Justiciar, Bandos, Armadyl, Void, Ancestral, Slayer Helm. I could go on.
---
Grats!
---
Go back to kindergarten
---
Ummmm
---
you know literally the plugins on runelite are optional right?  and it has 100000000x better performance than official client due to the gpu plugin?
---
Pepe, do a barrel roll
---
The poor people that play that game. I'm sure they enjoy it. But... it reminds me of my mom paying for lives on mobile games. I wish I could help them but there's no way I can.
---
Yeah, kinda strikes me as one of those go for it if money is no issue, otherwise hold off situations, similar to some of the end game gear that's over 10mil for like 1 more strength bonus.
---
If I had a 500m bank I'd use one for everything, but as of right now about 15% of my entire bank's value would be locked up for like 20 minutes shaved off the time it takes to gain an entire strength level.
---
No I'm just a med level who doesn't like new content that caters to the wealthy. Bonds are MTX, RWT breaks the rules, and my CoX rng is shit so my bank is small.
---
Honestly. That’s so true. I’m better of selling it and buying an imbued heart to speed up my zulrah kills!
---
Pretty sure it's gotta be over 2k at this point
---
still don't see how that's a consistent reply to anything I wrote
---
That would make it even more expensive which is the exact opposite of what I want. It should be like the nezzy already was--relatively cheap and accessible for anyone who is willing to do the quest.
---
I think you logged into the wrong account. You can have multiple accounts under the same email I believe (for some fukcing stupid reason)
---
Well maybe he should make his own beehives if he's going to be so picky about placement. Worst random in the game.
---
Toadflax is just safer for us scrubs who tend to have lower yields. You can refer to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit#gid=1034205971
---
This guy must be a colonel in Battlefield. Legend
---
11hp account is sick
---
yeah, IMO it's a good change, but pures used to risk like 45k, and now the meta is probably going to change to 31 prayer for protect item, so they can continue to risk 45k or even less.
---
I know what I need to do now.
---
Idk what game that is, but absolutely not buddy.
---
So is their playerbase
---
I’m going to the store you need anything?
---
Nice barrows gloves
---
But now their level cap is increased. Meaning they have to deal with higher leveled targets.
---
Isnt that kind of the point of releasing a no p2w server?
---
Why is every second nice downvoted
---
Lol just pick up the item
---
either way, a helm that uses no charges, has no negative bonuses, +6 str and +3 pray?
---

Asia. What I do is turn on VPN, wait for the loading scree to pop up and then turn off VPN before I log in. It works.
---
No, the heal comes if you hit the accuracy roll. If the attack has been rolled to hit (determined by accuracy bonus), then the damage is rolled. It rolls between 0 and max hit, not 1. If that roll is a 0, then the sgs will still heal at least the minimum amount.
---
So you can still heal on a zero, you can roll a hit on kurasks as well but you still inflict 0 damage without leaf-bladed equipment.

I’m lvl 109 who’s just got into bossing (managed to solo dks recently) but no fire cape :(

Enjoy people taking your spot even though they're very well aware that you're just leaving to reset.

If they r gonna make it bis slot, they need to make it have higher requirements.

Lol I cant even tell if this is a joke. Can u show me somewhere that proves this

Technically being a couple XP away from achieving 92 is the literal halfway point (yes I'm fun at parties).

I want to do duo or trio bossing with my friends
---
My stats are 86/96/90 atk,str,def. 88 ranged, 81 magic and 72 prayer
---
One friend is 74/83/75 atk,str,def. 92 ranged, 71 magic and 70 prayer 
---
Other has 61/51/61 atk,str,def. 70 ranged, 94 magic and 77 prayer
---
We have some basic bossing practice like barrows, kbd, sarachnis and some sporadics but thats about it, what would be good bosses that we could currently do or what would be good to aim for?
---
Fishing potions require 50 Herblore to make and Prayer potions require 38, so, by your logic, Fishing potions are better. That's how fucking dumb you're sounding.
---
Yeah but it's pretty quick quest regardless

Outside of writing a book or a professional document what does it matter if you are able to understand? Its like thinking people who speak ebonics or with a heavy southern accent are stupid just because they say words differently, its an entirely elitist position to take and makes you look like you have a fucking stick up your ass.

Youre just trying to give explanations as to why people default to yes, youre not saying anything of interest. "People default to yes because they want new updates" yes, exactly, thats the problem. People dont care about the substance they just want new updates. New helm? Doesnt matter if it has +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 str all that matters is that people want a new helm. They dont care. They default to yes.

Right but so does the wiki.. which everyone used previously. People even built handy website tools that could look up any clue and [give you the solution](rsclues.com)

But puzzles is definitely an easier approach. I agree there. I just don't think it matters when you're talking saving a few minutes of learning a basic sliding puzzle algorithm. Runelite even chooses one of the slowest methods to solve it.

I have an obby Cape I don't need a fire cape. And calm down precious it was only a joke.

oh dear. its not about the specs, but the prices, the tech we are now seeing in monitors is very old in other markets... this kinda stuff is exactly what companys love and why apple do so well

Yes wife LoIs

Dont they only ban gold sellers and not buyers?

In that case you prolly got banned for trading wealth from the lvl 3 to the main, not the other way around.

No you both

86.2 not 88
---
I've never watched one of your videos but I wouldn't because of those extremely busy thumbnails that look like 5 different people made them.
---
99% seems a little much. Theres prolly tens of thousands of people with 90s combat stats who could scrounge together 100m in a reasonable amount of time
---
I agree with you here. If you think the advantages aren’t material enough then that is fine and I’d agree to an extent, but there are definitely distinct gameplay advantages to using these clients that can save a substantial amount of time compared to vanilla client.
---
Fire cape is lighter and inferno has black in it I think
---
Is your aim to pk or pvm?  Because if it’s to pvm the problem with the staff is the fact no wild bosses are weak to magic. Outside of that it’s fine to use as a budget pk set.

This reads like someone who has literally never played the game. Probably the two skills *least* likely to involve just clicking and forgetting.
---
Um I play 4-5 accounts as once, I guess the difference between us is the fact I enjoy playing runescape instead of sitting on one account and watching tv.
---
Yep. I made a F2P account for my fiancee (she used to play back in the day). After a of couple hours trying to hop worlds to mine clay she barely had a few inventories. She just wanted to make some pots and pie dishes but the bot problem caused her to quit shortly after.

Go to lower level worlds then

Does your cat like me?

With the current state of TH promotions and exp, I believe the title...What a shame that game has turned into.

Even 70 is nothing compared to 92; 85 is half of 92, 77 is half of 85, 70 is half of 77.

An irl job is probably the best alt you could make gp wise. Paying for the membership without bonds saves you like 3-4m gp (roughly 4 hours at Vorkath/Rune dragons on a Mid leveled account). You're right though, OSRS YouTubers are usually in the 5% of the player-base who play with many alts.
---
Since I got my Quest Cape I've been doing everything outside of the meta of efficiency and as a result the game as been as fun as it was back in 2007. Runescape is one of the few games where I can play another game while playing this one.

Alts are a state of mind, you're either in it, or you're not...

Or you become addicted 2 years later and realise that you're wasting valuable time by not grinding an alt while training agility and fletching

Hey man! I actually met you in the GE yesterday and complimented your achievement. I tried adding you but I think you logged right after, I'm glad I saw this post. Add me in game same name and shoot me a message when you get a sec.

Thanks, Fox. Haha

Well isn’t that a shot right to my dick

To be a hater. Plus to gauge the OSRS reddit views on this.

Oh my.

According to another comment settled said it was 2am when it was recorded so he was probably just tired
---
hey 🅱eter
---
Yikes, just grinding points. And wow theres always some people like this. On a side note i have a 900m bank, and maybe you could visit a doctor for an eye test. Since this is armadyl.
---
Makes sense when making a pking acc.
---
Oh so that's what it is supposed to do
---
Thanks for this information.
---
What is common courtesy? "was resetting soz" "oh ok" \*hop*
---
They literally have a podcast together.
---
I've always tried to take the path of least effort with this game and it's worked out really well.
---
Correct me if I'm out of the loop - aren't there test worlds they can try these changes out on first?  Maybe they'd need to stay up for a month or more to get enough data, but that seems like the answer for integrity changes.

bruh i can't get that shit and I have 70 stats

I didn't say it did. On the same note, if someone makes a post you don't agree with why post on it?

Came here to gauge opinions and spark discussion not lord over people telling them what is right or wrong.

Lets bitch about it everyday when jagex has had the problem brought to their attention for 2 days. Calm the fuck down. Theres bigger issues in the game that have been there for years you dont need to spam reddit whining.

Isn’t charging orbs still a thing ? I used to make millions

Scratches an itch.

Sometimes I will be active obviously.

Don’t even know what that is haha but i will take a look in to it. Thanks :)

This is the funniest runescape shit I’ve ever seen in my live. Still no upvote tho.

Literally any of the skills that you hwcent trained over 70..

Not trying to be a douche, but you need to play more. Like completely throw away your social life and responsibility. Then perhaps, and only then- will you be able to start pullin' hoe's in varrock. 
---
But careful though, all that GP could go to your head. Have you ever heard of Durial32?
---
outside of bossing and some skilling, I'm pretty much AFK.
---
I steamed other games before RuneScape and gave out tons of info, is it my fault that people now know my ISP and where I've been living for the last few years? I understand where you're coming from but that's from the perspective of someone  who has cared about their account security from the start. There was no reason not to tell people where I study and when I'm at home or my ISP before I played osrs, it's not stupid of me to have shared things like that in the past.
---
At your level mate, definitely hunter
---
Check out osrs wiki's money making guide.
---
Yea man specifically air orbs , also making cannon balls is nice while watching a movie or some YouTube vids , slow but easy
---
Hahahah of course i heard of Durial32 what about him
---
I don't pick up many drops from Nechs either, when barraging them I don't have alchs so I only pick up a few rune sq shields or certain other rare drops and let most everything else go, probably miss out on a bit of gold but it would take ages to do Nechs if I was running back and forth to the bank that often. Jeez, I can't even imagine.
---
It’s GPU plugin that makes the colors on certain things, such as fire cape, more vibrant.
---
Can tell he’s got it on due to the anti-aliasing on the ground tiles.
---
Authenticator, bank pin, email that is private and unused. A computer continually scanned for viruses. 
---
Since you said you have auth (and auth is damn secure) I'd argue it's your pc and/or email that is compromised.

It's not just as afkable.
---
Thanks for the detailed response! Are alching runes worth it? Or do you just take everything to the bank?

Well did you examine your saw? Maybe it's dull.

Thanks ! First good drop like ever
---
I’m sorry. :(
---
Zalcano is what tier?
---
I did 75-95 on magic's. I did one level on redwoods and I can't go back to magics haha
---
The real question
---
I didn't mean to talk down to you and I apologize, but your intitial post is so aggressive I truly thought you misunderstood what an alt was.
---
So I always fuck up at healers, how does it work? You tag Jad with chins and they all frkin die or you tag each healer 1 at a time same with BP?
---
The fact that it took someone this many years to actually thank @JagexSupport to find this out
---
If it's put in a test region, people play it, and determine that it's a bad change by reinforcing their opinions, isn't that the goal?  Not their opinion but coming to a conclusion.
---
Dedicat3d is a notorious 2007scape troll. (At least I think he's a troll- idk he might just be an ass.) I think people are seeing the name and just insta-downvoting despite his question being rather innocuous.
---
Anyone else have it the opposite? If I’m out having a good time for a day or a couple days and then I go back to osrs I feel like “why do I even play this game in the first place?” Then you later realize that you usually don’t have a life and it was just a rare chance that you were busy irl?
---
No offence mate, but you need to work on using capital letters, dots and commas etc. in your writing. No need to be perfect, just throw some in to make the text more readable. 
---
As to what you're saying, I don't think dmg dealing should be changed. OSRS has always been somewhat rng based when it comes to combat, that's an essential part of OSRS and the feeling of fighting NPCs and other players. 
---
Check out RS3 if you want RuneScape with less rng in combat.
---
Ever since I got an imbued heart drop at 58 slayer I've been doing them religiously. Haven't gotten anything special since then but still, one of the best drops I

That's all I did when I changed mine last week. My guess would be their system is down momentarily and maybe wait until tomorrow to try again. The steps you did were correct so it should have worked
---
-VorkiDad700KC
---
Perfect. Thanks for the detailed response. I really appreciate it.
---
I used chins as well for my first cape and it makes it so easy to agro healers, it’s great. All you do is when the healers start spawning, switch to chins, click on jad, go back to pray switching , when all the healers are agro’d on you, switch back to BP, click on jad, back to prayers, kill big red boy.
---
 Neither... I’m almost maxed on RS3 and have bank from PvM. My buddy plays both games and transferred some of my gold. I don’t RWT.
---
ooh thats a thing? I'll look it up thanks
---
Of course! Not sure why this game becomes a pissing contest. 99% of it is how much of your life you’re willing to spend playing. This game is 100% about grinding lmao.

I think they missed it.

I approve this message.

Doesn’t make sense not to play for fun
---
Your account gets smart but your head gets dumb
---
So much to do, so much to see
---
So what's wrong with playing legitimately?
---
You'll never know if you don't go
---
You'll never max if you don't grow
---
you have another ~100 qp to go, get on it
---
On vacation in NYC, a trip that I organized. Still my #1 focus is trying to not miss seaweed and birdhouse runs.
---
I'm not max combat, but I hit 94 slayer with around 91 in all my melee stats. I wanted quicker cerb kills, so I afked 99 strength (and 99 hp) at nmz before going back. Definitely felt like cerb was more fun after maxing out my strength, and with a rapier, I was still able to get some attack (and eventually defence) levels.
---
If you still want *some* level up satisfaction, you could always just leave attack and defence at 85-90 and level those up through slayer. The difference between 90 and 99 won't be nearly as substantial as it is with strength, so you won't feel like you're missing out on quicker kills/longer trips.
---
Getting 99 magic before 99 slayer is *technically* a "waste", but I'd just go with what's more fun to you and get 99 now if the cape perk's a big enough deal. You could still use defensive bursting and level up defence on those tasks, so you'll still see some progression.
---
Jagex is just a trash company.

Super cringy that you didnt to it in the wc guild... wonder how many extra hours you had to wc for lol

---
Well, technically speaking, blacks have been so oppressed throughout history (despite incredible technical prowess and an astounding accreditation in the arts) that they simply need to be able to express themselves in such a fashion.
---
This is why it’s important to have songs such as “white girl” and “slizzurp” to exemplify the incredible testament to cultural development that blacks exude on a daily basis.
---
Cities such as Detroit (formerly a racist haven and poor example of a functioning city - see 1950’s photos) and Chicago (similar example) are now bustling environments that exemplify the pinnacle of cultural development.
---
It’s important to make sure that whites are severely penalized for any expression of identity or distinction of identity while allowing all other demographic groups the exact opposite. Highly important.

Got mine yesterday aswell. In void and trident of the seas no ring on my 2nd try since im always at sand casino, somehow i didnt find it harder than DS2.
---
I don't like how you have stepped away to use an analogy instead of focussing on this situation, this normally makes it more confusing for everyone involved to understand points and discussing things, but I will just go with it.  
---
So this analogy doesn't work for me, as you have split the people involved into two groups:  
---
- the friends who are part of the bike ride  
---
- the 'anyone looking'  
---
Therefore you must be applying this to the redditors to make your analogy work, so which redditors are the friends that organised this thread and which redditors are the ones looking?  
---
&gt;but to anyone looking its clearly not in the spirit of what you were doing.  
---
If I am an onlooker, I have no idea what they were doing. I could assume he had a flat tire, I could assume he had to rush home because he had diarrhoea, but I wouldn't assume he is "cheating" in a race against anyone else, regardless if it was fun or competitive, it is their business and I have no information on what is happening.  
---
&gt;by your logic could not be considered cheating because you didn establish specific rules.  
---
Yes that is correct, do you disagree? If so, tell me how someone could 'cheat', within the confines of a friendly bike ride - with or without rules being set.
---
impressive man
---
Even in the most innocent of places btw ty for using newest instead of most popular
---
Thank you, good sir.
---
And people slept on his skill as a player for the longest time. No doubt there's a lot of luck involved and he's been chanced many times but that doesn't downplay how good he is. First HCIM to all items in GWD and now ToB. Insane!
---
Pretty much completed all dangerous PvM on HCIM, just ancestral from raids 1 to go

Email me on my webzone and I’ll send you one.

popular unpopular opinion however if you really wanted downvotes, you would say 2009-2011 was the best era
---
Can you tell me how to beat 10 hours with my base 80 stats.
---
I used trident and blood BURST but as you said, dps started lacking after 3 pillars so I dropped that strat and just went to town.
---
its effective def roll is still higher than sand crab
---
How long did it take you to go from 40 to 60 with runners?
---
Can't blame him. Lost plenty of good cunts that year.
---
For sure. But you could easily afk rune drags for more gp/hr than effort RC methods.
---
Wrong on reddit? Pick up on a small technicality and only respond to that part. Great work.
---
Nope. I am my own boss. I play when I feel like it .. while the cash flows in :)
---
You had no aggro for a full minute and you're unhappy someone stole? Lol
---
honestly these days i just look at osrs posts to see seren3's stupid comment downvoted to fuck
---
It should turn crystal

Still can't believe they updates classic armour sets to look like garbage.

And its not even dangerous, so basically just ely if he wants to go for it :)

And that's totally fair mate. But talking in terms of comparison can't really take into equation "I want to avoid most of the game to justify this being a good method". It doesn't come close to comparing and that's my point. You're welcome to kill cows in lummy all day if it's what you wanna do. Power to ya
---
Do it
---
If I afk there for 5 minutes do I take more than 0 damage?
---
Why even bother at that point, just train up your stats or do another money maker.
---
You should buy an imbue scroll for it, only ~10k and buffs the accuracy + special attack
---
yea, divine pots are pretty nice, I notice the difference between the two.
---
That's one strategy, and unless you're ultra efficient and will miss that one mahog that dies every so often then it's probably the best one.
---
their max attack is 1 like sand [[sand crab]] and [[swamp crab]] you can see their stats yourself.

 **[Sand Crab](https\:\/\/oldschool\.runescape\.wiki\/w\/Sand\_Crab)** | https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sand_Crab 
---
 &gt;Sand Crabs are aggressive monsters that look like harmless sandy rocks while disguised, but attack when walked by. They are found along the southern coast in Hosidius. No favour is required to access or kill them and are available to all players.  The dwarf multicannon cannot be used against Sand Crabs. 
---
**[Swamp Crab](https\:\/\/oldschool\.runescape\.wiki\/w\/Swamp\_Crab)** | https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Swamp_Crab 
---
 &gt;Swamp Crabs are aggressive monsters that disguise themselves as harmless swampy logs. When a player approaches them, they will attack in a fashion that is identical to Rock Crabs. They are found in the swamps directly south of Port Phasmatys and near the eastern area of Slepe.

Nmz isn’t really an alternative to slayer, I can do nmz while essentially not playing, such as on my phone at work or while being 100% concentrated on another game. If I did it through slayer it would take a year, since I don’t want to slay for more than an hour a day, but I can stand in the nmz for like 7 hours each day.

What's sad is OSRS proves EoC didn't need to happen. EoC at launch was trash and I remember lots of people telling them not to push it out as it was but they did so anyway. Now RS3 suffers from extreme MTX milking while everything Monday update seems to break stuff. It's straight up embarrassing.

Yeah if you don't want to talk, turn off public chat.

---
They all talk the same now lol
---
Ring of dueling is also acceptable
---
Ah. Yeah... that isn't good then lol
---
Lol shit. Welp takes a special type of person to make an ironman. Thanks brother!
---
Eoc isn’t terrible as it was on released. Mtx aren’t bad if you ignore it. 
---
EoC and MTX arguments are pretty straight forward from what I seen; free levels &amp; too complicated. 
---
I mean, MTX doesn’t matter to most because I don’t care what bob over there looks like a fox after spending his money or that he got an extra 500k bonus exp from paying 15$. I just do my thing, do not spend extra money on micro transactions and play the game my way. Does everyone spend money on mtx? No, select few do and I would have to say out of 30 good clan mates, probably 3 have spent over 20$ on mtx. I bought a couple suits and a pet but that was it (got most of my runecoins from the gold membership so it came out of my “membership” fee) 
---
As for combat, it’s complicated but after watching a video or 2 and learning to play with it, I’m a lot more comfortable now. Am i elite level like some youtubers, no. Can you progress through the game while being a noob? Yes. 
---
I think the thing about it is that people don’t look at Rs3 like they do Osrs. You gotta look at it like, “hey, I’m having fun playing Rs3 or Osrs and I like it that way regardless of others opinions” instead of going, “he spent that, he got that, etc”. Highscores don’t mean anything unless you’re front page already. Nobody cares about who got maxed exp #2.
---
Not even close my dude, if you're on a computer you might want to adjust the color settings on your monitor.
---
Such an amazing account, it’s insane
---
It's funny because I actually made a plugin for myself that mutes all RWT-only mode players
---
Warding*
---
How did you swap money over?
---
This guy only posts racial shit on here, gtfo with your white supremacy bullshit
---
And mods should ban your ass if they give a shit about enabling this kind of trash
---
I don’t really care what you think :)
---
I wasn't exactly optimizing my stats when I played RS 10 years ago. I just tried to seem cool to my friends.
---
Technically he's not wrong. Since he is not the first HCIM to finish (as in complete a single run) of ToB. But that doesn't mean he is still a wanker trying to downplay this achievement.
---
Oh fuck what else do you use goutweed for
---
How anybody can agree with this is retarded. We don’t hate it because we don’t play it and feel superior. We hate it because of what it represents. Forcing the majority of the community to start fresh for their fuck up taking away over a decade of a lot of people’s lives and childhoods.
---
LOL
---
Dog shit company what do you expect? That your money helps improve the game?
---
Pets have no value to anyone, I'd argue, outside of individual preference.
---
What's he doing next?
---
I'd say most ppl do not play multiple accounts at the same time. But it's not a players fault for wanting to actually play the game instead of watching a movie while afk.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The afk to semi-afk activities jagex releases makes it too easy to alt. Maybe if they released more high apm content people wouldn't be able to play multiple accounts so easily.
---
Why do we even need blades, its a fucking web how strong can It be that you cant just walk through it?
---
Thanks dude I'm going to do my tasks untill I get jad and get him!
---
It's afk. 1.5t teaks is far from afk. He could be doing it while studying, at work etc. Not everyone can play and break their wrists for "hours" and have fun doing so. I definitely don't have fun doing 1.5t teaks and would rather do 10 hours of magic logs than 2 hours of 1.5t teaks.
---
Ancestrals from CoX
---
*This* is a dumb comment.
---
Yeah I know, but you arent gonna have archers ring, fury, and a fire cape if you've just started playing
---
I have found none but one useful app i found for mobile is called "floating apps" it lets you play mobile while browsing google/youtube or set a timer for afk skilling
---
Totally uninterested until the last part. I fully support this
---
That i robot scene with the bots jumping out the moving lorry would be perfect for this
---
Trust me I dont do it on purpose lol. They're invisible irl
---
The joke is that everything about RC is terrible and locked behind things.
---
Im ashamed i got all level 70's an still dont got it
---
That's awesome. My first ever fire cape was pretty much the same. Used rune arrows I fletched myself and an msb haha
---
if you notice lately in their videos, Settled and Framed are starting to do subtle impressions of one of J1mmy's sillier voices (Framed especially in the most recent Gridlocked video).
---
The truest hero begins to be revealed.
---
I somewhat enjoy spongebobs face more.
---
There's actual anger in it, rare to see from spingle bawb.
---
No need to worry rng doesn't work that way so you are fine.
---
Well they aren't slayer
---
I’m dumb as fuck.
---
Bond prices would increase. Players buying bonds with real money profit.
---
ah shoot, if i had just scrolled 2 ticks further. well it blew my mind when i found out about it the day after i got my qpc and cleaned my bank.
---
Please upvote this man
---
Hi yes please never say those words ever again thank you
---
Bro 😤
---
his fuckin face kills me
---
More complaining from a European. Nothing new.
---
tell me more about mtx
---
Yes, telegrabbing is a must otherwise it converts if you pick it up normally.
---
It’s worth 100mil
---
And then Lord Farquad sent J1mmy and Framed to mess with swamp man so he has to go kill an obese vampire to be left alone again.
---
Oh thanks for reminding of my daily downvote
---
Sooo membership? Lol
---
How do i get this in r6 siege?
---
To fix i suggest making it so the item only shows once for examine. If there is 88 ash then examining one vs other doesnt matter
---
You need all tracks except holiday tracks, maybe you can unlock "alchemical attack" by just going there or spectating or something?
---
Why do you want it untrimmed?
---
It'll be so nice the day I don't have to drop half eaten pies and random nails from bank just for those few extra spaces.
---
Name checks out
---
Pack it up boys, rs3 is now off limits when it comes to memeing.
---
wanna switch?
---
it would make sence since for our whole characters lives their doing mining, hunting, and walking across continents constantly so I wouldn't be surprised if we could kick through a tree stump
---
Don't say that about him he's a real class act, I met Adam 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but fucking Sick Nerd himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there farming on mobile and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Adam, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Adam put down his tablet mid run, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barber shop. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.
---
Just move every clue step to the GE
---
Hes 53 range, dumbass
---
What are those mage slayer circles on top
---
they should of made it a toggle thing. on or off if you wanted the updated armour's
---
You have to finish it for a clue step unfortunately
---
Aaaaandddd IIIIIII, STANND ALONEEEE
---
This copypasta was boring the first time I saw it.
---
At higher levels it is. For people just starrting, they'd probably want inventory space
---
You're boring
---
Isn't it 69.69? /s
---
How you doin'
---
anyone can go in the hydra lair you just can’t attack
---
Free mobile membership. As long as this idiotic idea is in place there will be thousands of extra members world bots
---
Why does gadderhammer suck so much? I'm using void melee and salve e on shades and it's just not as good as something like keris on scarabs.
---
People don’t like to be killed, everyone brigades against people they don’t like. And if a small minority does something bad it makes the whole group look bad. 
---
People also think “I’m just doing a clue, all they are going to get is a spade” or “I’m just rcing and only have 50 essence and a glory” but time and again people will kill someone and get an eternal glory and 10000 nats or loads of teleport scrolls and tablets.
---
In my personal opinion the wilderness is great for pking but not pvp. As if you want to pvp you would just do lms, bounty hunter or pvp world. But the wilderness is full of high risk high reward situations like revs, high xp activities but with the risk of someone killing you easily
---
If you're forever scared of trying new things, you will settle for repeating the same content as everyone else and never progress or learn anything - don't be scared to try, mdvmdvmdvmdv - even your name is just repetition.

&gt;copypasta

&gt;replying my 'boring' comment back to me

Two examples, I am sure there are more in your post history but **only you** would benefit from noticing them and learning from it.

Thanks man! Some quests really have amazing story and dialogues but this one really had depth and optional extra dialogues, loved it. I train Defense mostly because I really like being the tanky/meatshield type! I play OSRS with friends often and kinda claimed the role of tanking GWD in the future. Very inefficient xp but oh well, it looks kinda cool as well :D  
---
Might up Att/str once I hit 90 def but we'll see
---
Me. I'll finish it sometime. Questcape is one of my goals anyway.
---
I understand that the BP  is quite OP. But remember, it's an item that requires scales to recharge plus dependable darts such as addy's since its mostly used.  I'm not the perfect person to suggest a change for the item. However please be in mind that your saying to devalue zulrah drops... a boss that already got nerfed drops.
---
And not to mention that using it COSTS eventually after time. So your saying lets nerf something that have a quite disadvantage when it comes to cash to you know refill it. It's already enough that C'bows have Enhanced / Amethyst bolts. And darts now finally in the game HAS a purpose. 
---
Lastly, let's not just decide to nerf something that already been used by almost BIS in the community in Pvming.
---
Because generally the people who PK those who actively try to avoid the wildy are just really bad at it and they can only kill people who they know won’t put up a fight. So the people who kill you already have an inferiority complex going, so they vent their anger at helpless clue hunters/skillers to make themselves feel better and like they’re actually good at it.
---
thanks!
---
Social/Pvm/Skilling.  Trivia then Bandos events r starting in 1h
---
You dont have a main, zerker, pure and cybersex account?
---
If you got the spare gp use a cannon at dagganoths im not the best at nmz but i get better xp at dagganoths
---
It's pretty short, just be sure you don't mix the magic essence potion too early, or you'll have to recollect the ingredients :c
---
Sounds like somebody's upset they got killed doing a clue. It's ok bud, you want to talk about it?
---
You're vile.
---
Cool, ty :).
---
Every pvp game has toxic people
---
Support, quests should give more meaningful rewards anyways, after sote the city felt like dead content to me after a week, the tree patch is about the only reason I even go there
---
Not much effort for a few qp and a step closer to infinite fairy ring teles
---
But they do. All the supplies that get farmed from the leveling get dumped into the ge and crash all the prices.
---
&gt;Why do you think Pkers are portrayed **(and rightly so based on my experiences)** as rude and obnoxious, and if they are is it a coincidence or does player killing attract a certain type of person?  
---
it's not a question for other people, if you feel a need to include your viewpoint within the question.  
---
what are your experiences with PKers, aside from when they are killing you within a PvP environment?
---
 Lol kid this happens all the fucking time
---
&gt;the second
---
The armor has a solid prayer bonus that everyone overlooks. That is the real power of it.
---
Half or quarter the drop rate and make zulrah drop only scales and troll drops and bet the blowpipe price goes up along with its scales significantly. No need to nueter one of ranges only viable options in pvm.
---
I get where you're coming from lol. I turned off the plugin and it felt soooo blurry, unplayable! lmao
---
Nightmare zone for combat, do as many quests/achievement diaries, and with 150m it should be easy
---
I loved this and every comment after so much!
---
No one cares!
---
😂😭😂
---
V.I.L.E. = very into leftist extremism
---
Another nationalist codeword! Lmao!
---
Do you think we don’t get your agenda?
---
You ruined it with this lame ass comment
---
Ahh the classic drop party of 30k items and to follow that guy on twitch  :)
---
is this the guy?
---
I swear its the death mechanics i remember when people went into wilderness knowing they were gonna die at some point and only bring what they were willing to lose
---
Dragon sword is better than longsword. If you aren't 60 attack yet, use a granite hammer if you can afford one
---
Yes that’s what I’m referring to.
---
Knives are from wyrms btw
---
For the better half of a year it has been task after task after task. 
---
Honestly, with that being said, I'm genuinely excited to start skilling now. 
---
Only problem is that I can't decide where to start. I'm sitting at ~ base 50s right now with the exception of construction, rune crafting, and hunter. Which all three are lower than 50....of course.
---
While it is impressive, some of the best PvMers in the game wouldn't have much trouble with it. I mean.... Just look at Woox... Nuff said
---
People who bot their stats for fun usually dont do high gp/h gold farming methods and are also a very small percentage of the playerbase, as most wouldnt risk the ban.
---
well that’s bad for me I don’t wanna pay 1k for sharks
---
It’s a meme dude get with the times
---
I repot when it'll give me +6, read it somewhere a long time ago and have done it ever since. Really not sure the absolute most optimal time to do, probably depends on your gear and base levels
---
They should lock the game behind being a human instead.
---
And make money
---
Ookook!
---
Okay? No one is talking about effort here, just efficiency and xp/hr.
---
?
---
Because it has no combat requirement to wield.
---
stop breathing please
---
Thats all that matters.
---
Saw 2 people 1 with smolcano and 1 with skotz. Was cool even tho they didnt know they were related
---
that's rs my dude if you hate it wrong game
---
I won't downvote and just say that a game where you can't resist the urge to cheat is apparently not a game for you.
---
I hunt spades myself, actually. I just hate the people who do it and think they’re good at PKing while being extremely toxic about it.
---
I was under the impression that we were talking about nmz, so not being in a safespot was a given...
---
First off they weren't facts, they were blatant misinformation. Secondly, "facts" can be used as propaganda to push an agenda. In this case it was white supremacy, eat shit for defending it.
---
There’s plenty of other money makers besides zulrah. I didn’t do zulrah for money before SOTE. I only have 10kc..but paid for it through other means. Plus it’s a grandmaster. It deserves high requirements through quests and skills.
---
My God thank you
---
Why do you pivot on every question?
---
Dinklewomper
---
It does get under my skin, but rarely do I get killed while clue hunting/skilling. I just hate how the bad PKers toxicity is affecting people’s perception of the wild.
---
Is Sang staff really worth using at Kraken? With the toxic trident and an invent of pizzas, my trip length limiting factor already becomes invent space for loot. I can't imagine that the healing effect would be super useful unless I want to leave loot on the ground.
---
my girlfriend's hand, in your butt?
---
If you just wanna practice, go in with 3 items and suicide
---
I take it I remembered right? Too scared to google that at the bar lol
---
Legend
---
also petition for sote to have 90+ stats minimum this is insanely underwhelming requirements
---
Stop hacking your friends account
---
Ardy Cloak 4 on a zerk is awesome.
---
Yeah, if you don't like questing in osrs you probably won't like questing in any MMORPG (unless your annoyance with rs questing is that it isnt 'go kill some enemies then talk to so-and-so for free xp'. Which I would argue is a very shallow concept of quests that has been way too widely adopted.)
---
I even think Roving Elves would do.
---
Learn to screenshot.
---
Facts are facts, Detroit and Chicago look like absolute shit and have unreal crime rates. Eat shit for rejecting reality and thinking I'm a white supremacist. You're disgusting.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about rigour. I didn't hate Vorkath, but getting the assembler was very annoying with the blowpipe, enough so that I don't want to go back until I have a DHCB. 
---
Really interesting point about BP+rigour vs DHCB+Eagle eye, I think I'll hold off on rigour for a while. Thanks!
---
Yup, that's how I got mine... didnt wanna spend 3.5m on a helm while already down on cash.. but oh well
---
I completely agree, but balancing that sort of thing would be an absolute nightmare.
---
Just made a baby pure and had to get a fire cape before I did anything else.
---
Congrats on the flax
---
Grats on 99! Surprised you were able to get the screenshot on kraken since the tentacles attack you too lol
---
I directly addressed your question and you obviously can’t muster a response given the above. I don’t debate racists like you since racism isn’t an argument.
---
Siglim!
---
do you smoke weed
---
also remove hcim from any that died in a safe place
---
Stunning revelation: Mod Weath is actually Will Smith
---
Also just because you don't like warding don't downplay the idea.
---
He got the point across, and you just poke fun cuz he said magic.
---
Well guess what, RuneScape is full of magic and we don't call it all the magic skill. Like runecrafting. You imbue essence with magic but not using the magic skill, might as well remove rc and just make runes with the magic skill cuz it uses the very broad term 'magic'
---
So from what I understand he is a sailor sometimes and he swears at his crewmates, he's a mumble rapper around his friends and he properly flashes for his colleagues ahah?
---
I asked about Camelot and Al-Kharid, you talked about Al-Kharid and Lumbridge. Your reading comprehension is indicative of your viewpoints.
---
I'd honestly gear up to fight back, but whats the point when my clue is in the deep wildy and I'm just going to get gangbanged by a clan after a scouter bot finds me. I don't hate pk'ers, but I have no incentive to want to fight back. If anything, just taking the death gets me back to whatever I was doing when i got the clue anyways.
---
Pretty sure there is
---
The sanguinesti staff only has a +1 max his over the trident, however it can't venom the target. Also it can heal you, which isn't that useful considering the Kraken rarely hits on you when you're geared up like he is.
---
The Sanguinesti staff costs 1k per cast vs. The Trident of the Swamp costing around 450gp per cast. So it's a pretty big waste of GP to be using the Sanguinesti staff at Kraken.
---
Thanks for letting me know you found the initial topic too hard to focus on and have tried to switch it up, though tripping, stumbling and falling over your own 'Oooooof' comment on the way down. We all learned something about you today.
---
God knows then, erase the files under user applications and re downloaded
---
gully belly damnation
---
Yeah only content forcing pvmers into wild are: 6 wilderness bosses with pets/rings/shields/dpick, black chins, op chaos altar, wildy resource arena, revs, clues etc. Maybe they shouldnt put so much op content in the  wilderness if they dont want to divide communities
---
PKers have always talked shit all the time, even back in the day everyone was constantly talking shit. I've been PKing since like 06 and I can safely say the wild is no more "toxic" now than it was back then. Any game that has a competitive player vs player aspect to it is going to be filled with trash talk, that's just how people work. The problem in 2019 is you sensitive motherfuckers with victimhood complexes that are hurt by words on a computer screen.
---
he has scythe. So useless? Completionist hcim would be awesome tbf.
---
Are you really trying to change the entire game in lieu of ftp ironmen?
---
How stuck are you with your ftp im
---
I’m mocking you and you are eating it and asking for seconds. You are the ass of this joke my friend. Give your mulatto grandkids a hug from me 30 years from now champ.
---
I just got a clue where I have to talk to FGM in the resistance hideout, guess I’m finishing it.. sigh
---
They're in the market just not for the price you're looking for
---
Your posters look like a [Shantay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmn-iT7d8ROsaxPlEHDBpA/videos) youtube video
---
Why doesnt tutorial island have some kind of hard question like; "how did the kardashians get famous?" to prevent bots from entering the game.
---
Im so tired of all this PC Bullshit. Not even on something as remote as a gaming sub can u escape it
---
Do you know how or who can do it?
---
Would the BP in that picture be for the spec? To help heal or would the person be using BP to wooxwalk instead of DHCB?
---
I love men
---
Just quit bro this game sucks
---
jiklim
---
So, argument aside. Are you advocating that this shouldn't be fixed? Cause whether or not one or multiple people post it it's still a major issue that should be fixed, and I'm not sure why any player in there right mind wouldn't want it fixed.
---
Most bots would kill themselves before completing Rag and Bone man anyways, so no need to lock it behind anything
---
Omg my fav account got banned for this
---
Dokdur
---
Don’t think they polled duel arena tax so it definitely could happen
---
Holy shit!!!! Nice achievement. That’s really impressive with those stats
---
I’ll be back I didn’t know these were unique
---
Ancients are also used for 80% of the bosses in the game for sustain without using a ton of food and brews.
---
And yeah he/she has 120m, but they won’t keep it long following this advice. It’s literally a complete waste of gp to buy non bis items that are just as expensive as bis.
---
I doubt they should be taking advice from a player that’s only just got his slayer helm and has no barrows gloves. You yourself don’t know much about the game at this point, so you really shouldn’t be giving input on things like bis or close to bis gear/training.
---
You also didn’t bother to mention to him/her about training combat with slayer to make some side gp and get passive xp in another skill at the same time. Nmz is only good once you get Dh and have around 90 hp and a halfway decent strength level. Or for range, a blowpipe and 80 or so range, which is very expensive.
---
???
---
Glad it wasn't just me. This has been a headache.
---
Well my newest account was my OSIM and its first and foremost goal was RFD. Many sub goals came about to achieve it but that was the focus.
---
Its that not "snicker"?
---
I think its affecting a lot of people and not just you. I have it too
---
The username “cummy pussy” is available atm
---
Of course hes using illegal plugins and doesnt give a fuck because he merely logged into the account 
---
It's not his account so it's nothing if it gets banned
---
Tax the GE like the Duel Rena is taxed.
---
I never said it shouldn't be fixed, Once again I replied to the person saying "countless of posts" when theres about 3 posts on this subreddit about it, actually make that 5 now including this one and a fresh one over at /new. 
---
This post is the 4th time I see OP post this exact same picture in the past week hence my statement.
---
probably questioning why you're not using the abyss or even staminas by the looks of it
---
:)
---
Who hurt you lmao
---
How does a fragile soul such as yourself end up in a place like this?
---
They're spread out in a way so you can't aggro more than one at a time. You have to move to aggro more. Unless there's a spot where there's multiple on top of each other that I don't know about.
---
I love ass.
---
Better greedy with a country built on my ancestors and my back than allow people who’s family invested nothing into the country and insist they have privileged rights. 
---
Very frustrating that people base political and economic decisions on their emotions as opposed to facts.
---
If they do, Venezuela will be nothing but fields
---
Go exercise and meditate, no one made them get addicted 😂
---
You made the streams more entertaining. Thanks bro! No more planking on stream :)
---
Rag&amp;Bone Man III?
---
better them than us
---
Do you know how much of reddit is going to cry their ass off?
---
As much as I wish there was a tax on the Ge I don't think it's going to happen, just like this garbage death mechanic we have.
---
Jagex fucks this economy so hard just because people don't wanna lose pixels
---
Mate, you're not going to triple or quadruple your money with a level 53 combat account unless you know how to Merch on the ge which is not something anybody can just go do. You need to know what you're doing and merching is tough because a lot of the time it takes a long time for your investment to pay off. You need to level up slayer and you need to get 50 magic and Ibans blast and mystic gear and go camp barrows brothers
---
Have you got one of those fliers?
---
But effort plays such a large role into it
---
What's better:
---
0hr - 30 minutes of slayer on days you're too busy to sit down and grind
---
vs
---
6 hours of NMZ almost effortlessly every day
---
Skillcapes that have perks? - see magic skillcape allowing spell book swap
---
BTW btw
---
Spungbub jamfants
---
That would be cool!
---
Nice 99 slayer was the last thing I aimed for in RS3.
---
It’s a current issue as of a couple weeks ago. Jmods say they are working on it.
---
Dokhur
---
Gz on your 1m split boys
---
Alright there slugger, your first post was about how PKers that kill PvMers all have an inferiority complex and take out their anger on defenseless clue hunters. If we're talking about making assumptions then let's start there eh. If you can extrapolate all that from just dying to them, then I can definitely infer that you are one super sensitive little guy based on your feelings being hurt by PKers. 
---
Fair, right?
---
Lul. Mad? Sick nerd is one of the best pvmers. Cry more.
---
I actually really appreciate this idea, but maybe continue the Rag &amp; Bone Man questline, and poll this as a reward. Master quest from that series would be cool.
---
I actually like the idea about compressing essence into a talisman and then having to imbue it. I just think getting random talismans while mining would be a little lackluster.
---
Yes. They all theoretically have perks and some use but Devs have commented before on them being overly useful. See adding Vork head to Range cape but not addy the bonuses. (Just gets the bonus ammo retained)
---
If you clean herbs you get herblore 100k/H and profit over 300k gp/h
---
35-70 herb via pray pots is not that expensive, around 3M, also smithin but even quicker
---
Like me. Just finishef the quest lineast week. And whole moly its a good one.
---
what do you think, inconspicuous old man and mime?
---
Okay and they deserve to pay a sales tax. Rebuttal?
---
My dick could do better controlling a mouse on ms paint
---
What? I spend a shitton of time there thanks to Zalcano, tree patch, and the agility course.
---
Enjoy your downvotes ya little piece of a piece of a piece.
---
They’ve gone through with the pvp integrity changes so I don’t think jmods are that worried about the blowback, and that stuff definitely comes off as worse since some of those have failed multiple polls. I personally would b okay with a small tax like .1%, to have the same tax as duel arena would be too much as that shit definitely adds up fast and that’s when ur winning a ton of money not spending it lol
---
Dude, look it up. There is a way to de iron ingame
---
&gt;infinite fairy ring teles
---
What? They're infinite already aren't they?
---
why does every possible method have to be viable?
---
Nevermind I do now, I guess I just needed 1 beer to 'sober up' a lil' bit
---
Dude, I set it to be permanent ironman so i cant switch in game...
---
Umm. Zalcano, gauntlet, the sand pit, and the agility course aren't dead content? Only thing actually dead is the crystal armor
---
There's a few items that could be added to the rolls when completing the rogues den minigame: uncut gems, cut gems, various amounts of gp, etc. It's literally just the equipment crate and rogue kit at the moment, a buff to the rewards would probably be received well by the community since 1/2 of the rewards currently is literally useless.
---
If you set to permanent de-iron then you can’t
---
Majoraty of slave owners were jews.
---
Won't lie. Saw It 2 last night and about halfway through that 3-hour grind-fest, I caught myself thinking "I legit only need like 1.5m xp until 99 Range. I could totally be working on that right now."
---
But if we are being super honest, it was a great flick and I enjoyed every minute of that three hours.
---
Isn’t the 1 week trail on mobile?
---
Like 95% of zeroes are misses tho, so thats not really relevant. Most of the time, zero is zero heal.

Ive seen people contact jmods and they can manually do it.

He got the cape about a month or so ago off-stream, he streamed how he got it but it was a recording.

Only trails... swampletics...Alkan...chocobo...mudkip...

Yeah but then you have to have less fun and still do MEp2

This is a lie

I started Legends after forever and was able to finally free Ceramic Vase, got all geared up to finish RFD only to remember I’m at 174 QP. Maybe I’ll finish part 2
---
Well god damn.
---
Yea it still works
---
Still works, use dark bow so you shoot two arrows
---
Every damn time

The dude is nearly maxed on rs3 so ya the title is a bit misleading as he obviously has a lot of pvm experience
---
Find a quest order guide as quests can get most skills to about 30 off the bat
---
Definitely train combat through slayer. For what gear, well, the best to can afford. Red dragon hide is pretty cheap and should be using that with your range level.

You’re better off contributing to an open source project, because you’ll have to learn how to develop around a team of other devs and their processes. Ultimately an employer wants to know that you’ll be a team player, they’ll teach you what you need to know programming-wise.
---
Luckily for you, Runelite is open source ;)
---
I doubt his standards are quite so low.
---
I thought you couldn’t switch task to Jad until you have beaten it once before
---
zulrah being as profitable as it is has already caused lots of issues given a vocal portion of the community and teams design philosophy. if a new boss comes and isnt more profitable than other things people call it dead content, and jagex has been designing content around their engagement metrics, judging things as successful/failure based almost entirely on how many people are interacting with it. We've seen this with vorkath and hydra drop tables most notably.
---
zulrah becoming even more profitable just feeds back into this cycle
---
Wait what did verf do

This is how it’s done, however I think there’s a 1-2 week period before it happens.

what is happening here, why did he have all that shit on him?
---
I'm not sure if it does. Or if any of the diary's do but maybe. And thank you :)
---
Maybe because stuff takes too damn long to achieve in this game and a lot of stuff is no where near the definition of "fun".  I almost consider it "work". Getting my thieving up for desert treasure made me wanna fucking die and that was only getting to what, lv 55? Like 0.8% of the way to 99?
---
Runescape is the only game I know where people try and perfect ways not to play it while playing it so they could do something else while gaining xp.   
---
Not saying I support botting but I totally don't blame people who bot their own account to level up stats.
---
Aside from all the butthurt people on this thread, i enjoyed the post 'twas quite hilarious
---
Looks rad

Proof?

Back when I was 7 I used to make an account, get thru tut island, get stuck at the end where the mage teles you to lumby, quit then created a new account.

Called it run escape because I thought you were trying to escape the cave where vannaka is 😂

A mushroom killed you lmfao I am so sorry

I died at Wintertodt because I got a texted a meme from my brother and got distracted.

Consider going with Brimstone so you have 1 less switch
---
&gt;We all used to play it, then quit for the older version of the game.
---
Nah, fortunately I never played RS3.  I quit in 2007 with removal of free trade/wildy.
---
I actually forced my resolution to over 4k on my 2k 32 inches monitor thanks to the nvidia graphics card, could fit 42 accounts on one screen. Before that I just used virtual desktops which is way better than multiple monitors.
---
Is still that profitable? Well I'm the fool then :D
---
very carefully
---
I got stuck in the random event maze for 3 days when I was 10 and almost got put off the game until someone helped me out
---
Yeah it’d be pretty OP for an easy quest reward.

Architectural alliance is a good one, as well as the ones that give you the teleports. I don't remember their names though. The teleport quests are also the ones with the lvl ~35 monsters for NMZ.
---
I got the purple version bc of twitch
---
Once you gather  +3k Slayer points, they aren't very valuable anymore
---
It took me 37 deaths to get it down so I understand your frustration, a really nice learning mechanism is to go to the way back machine and look up zulrahguide.com. Then use one from 2 years ago I think, but regardless it’s a little browser program where you click where zulrah popped up and it shows you the rest of the rotation, where to stand, what to pray and all that. Also it’s a skinny page so you can have osrs and it on the same screen, even on a laptop! Really helped me a lot, I’m almost 3k kc with 3 pet drops btw.

Not an exact answer bc IDK how many tiles of land there are or how many droppable items there are but if you don't count duplicates (I'm assuming not since otherwise you'd obviously have enough items), you wouldn't cover even 1% of OSRS tiles with every item in the game.

I've tried both a longbow on long range as well as dark bow and got hit consistently, so unsure of how to do it. I ended up using dbow, d arrows, and brews
---
It's quite bad unless you intend to use dragon tier bolts and even then it's outclassed by blowpipe/msb(i) for everything except certain bosses.
---
Almost

Dinh’s was pretty obnoxiously strong and it still is. Just had it’s magic defense nerfed. Pvmers would have a higher success rate and die less if they actually took gear to survive or escape. But when you go into the wilderness naked I don’t have a whole lot of sympathy.

Assed. Not asked.

Getting 52 for regicide was literally painful for me. I don't see myself ever training that shit again, let alone the other grindy skills you need 70 in for SotE

I miss Torva. I remember being lent Torva from a rich friend and I felt like a boss.
---
I wouldn't mind Nex armour if their HP bonus was removed in PvP situations and stats slightly nerfed that a full Torva set would only be +3 more str from Bandos. I would also make it require the respective Bandos/Arma/Ancestral with a special attachment and respective barrows gear. This would never pass a poll due to perceived power creep.
---
I'm totally fine with the Zulrah bots. I encourage them. Cheaper the scales the better is what I think.

Looks like an extremely old pic

I think out of my 25 Skotizo kills my Arclight has landed a total of 2 specs...

UIM accounts utilize the Looting Bag as a sort of second inventory. The main caveat is that you can only withdraw/deposit into it whilst in the wilderness.
---
Could you still do it on 1 def accounts then? I don’t really quest much just did the main ones

WhizardRS is good for background noise

If you have res you can filter posts based on keywords

Hi, I have over 1900 total, 200m fm, 99 con, and 200m in zulrah right now on my UIM.

Death mechanics make the game mode playable, and the vast majority of end game UIM share this opinion.

quest cape gives teleports to the legend's guild, like 5 steps or some shit from a fairy ring

Idk hm people are in 302, but I'm pretty sure pet and unique chance scales with ur % contribution. That's why people favor smaller teams, a 10 man will give everyone 10% contribution but a 4 man team will give everyone 25% and is probably just a few seconds slower at most.

Work on RuneLite. Shows you can actually program, shows you can work collaboratively and know how to use tools like GitHub, it doesn't break the rules, and it benefits everyone.
---
"Any type of bones" becomes problematic. This would raise the profit of Hydra tasks significantly higher than they already are. Same for Skeletal Wyvern tasks. 
---
If you made it regular bones only, this would be ok although I'm not sure if it would have any meaningful place to be used then. 
---
I'm inclined to say that this is an item that can and really should just remain cosmetic.

Look on the bright side, at least your mug isn't as broken as their customer support.
---
good call, I forgot about runelite and it being open-source
---
They probably rely on them in some sense because they make the game look more alive. In the original OSRS they removed all bots and it led to real players leaving because the game just "looked empty".
---
How? At lv50?
---
Yea, they shouldn’t have done that, but we don’t have a time machine and the change still needs to be made.
---
Centre right conservative actually so good job with your assumptions there 😂

Nieve is even faster with a slayer ring

The quarry in the desert is the fastest way to get sand in the game and by far.

Because they give more prayer points per dose (but mostly because I ran out of ppots so took restores instead).

---
Nope. It's the lack of bug bounties/basic security practices, total lack of due diligence, and *purely* reactive attitude of Jagex.
---
But it's *hard* for Reddit to think critically and point at an unknown unknown.
---
I agree but if you WANT to kill it for pet you should use sang. I'm only doing kraken for pet and the fastest way to kill it is sang.
---
Yeah you’re probably center right conservative compared to Hitler but not in the USA...

Hmm, I never thought to name them. Good name though.

Idk man unless someone specifically had it out for you, i doubt you were specifically targeted. Let me just tell you, dont go to any links, dont answer any emails from people you dont know or organizations you dont associate with, and be incredibly carefull watching porn lol, those are like the main places viruses come from.
---
I saved up 20k for full black armor, which took forever. Then proceeded to go to the wildy because I thought I’d be way stronger than the noobs with bronze and iron and also didn’t understand skulling. Attacked a dude in mage robes, got destroyed with earth strike, and lost my full black armor.
---
They dont need a new animation but they need to write the 16k different darts in code
---
There is no good money making methods in f2p.
---
Trained on the body guards near draynor for base 60 stats, because they were aggressive to me and I didn't need to click on then, but I'd still watch them.
---
Later on in my noob life I'd kill men and women in lumbridge for herb drops to make money.
---
Dark crabs are 650k/h, 3 clicks every 4 minutes or so
---
Yeah that makes more sense. Can’t wait to use my new colorful blowpipe with bronze darts (p)
---
The most afk thing is. Cannonballs. Hardly have to pay attention. Not great profit anymore, but it is very afk
---
It's bis literally all the time haha task makes it better OFC and it uses charges so realistically its not easy to use it for a long period of time
---
Just use your bought gold to buy a bond and make money in p2p
---
(349/350)^1832 = ~0.005 or 0.5%

Around 1/200 players got your luck.

Wait, _what_ times a million?

Dragon crossbow is only useful for its spec. You have to regularily range piles for it to be worth it, i.e. range dust devils or ankous at catacombs
---
I cannon ice trolls on yatizo.
---
They drop enough alchables that I normally break even/make tony profit.
---
Plus, I keep the ensouled heads for prayer exp
---
is that a fire max cape in the wild?
---
To be fair, though, there isn't really a time that a normal account would use any of those. A keris will still have significantly worse dps then any meta 50/60 attack weapon. An ironman that hasn't gotten a crozier yet may use a wolfbane for...MEP2 light puzzle maybe? 
---
They're all probably just relics of when everyone played for fun rather than min/maxing.
---
 I love you man
---
I got 5k buckets per hour at the quarry. You get like half of that at the pit.
---
Make it so it only works if it’s being worn, and if it’s taken off any bones that are in the sack “fall out” and are lost. 
---
That’d help it become more of a trade off than a flat out buff (sacrifice cape slot for bones)
---
Yes I agree but in its place they should add a Lowe level boss also. As a mid level player there’s a lack of nonwildy bosses in my combat bracket.
---
Well it was a mug but now it's just a cup
---
*How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?*
---
Take your whole cash stack and invest into feathers at 2 gp each. They'll buy slowly but you can resell at 3 gp for a guaranteed 1 gp profit per feather. While you wait for that, cut either magics or yews. You could also start runecrafting nats, double cosmics, or bloods if you have the level. With 60+ smithing and gloves of ice you could make metal bars at the blast furnace
---

What? I get like 3k buckets if I'm focusing. Only 75 mining though

I've fished lobsters for some guy for 3 weeks and he would pay me at some point by trimming my black armor

How do you keep multiple untrimmed? Do you drop them all every time you get a 99? I'm not sure how this works.
---
He shouldn’t be a pmod

Yeah absolutely. Just a curiosity.
---
I am (extremely) short Dragon Bones, if this would result in lower dbones prices I would be very happy.
---
So xp doesn't actually isn't based on the amount of hp you have.
---
Water friends have 8,000 hp and give 934.2 combat xp and 308.2 hp xp along with 335 Slayer xp
---
Greater demons have 6,000 hp and give 385.2 combat xp and 127.1 hp xp along with 135.4 Slayer xp
---
Last example rune dragon has 68,250 hp and gives 4,200 combat xp along with 1386 hp xp. But 2051 Slayer xp. 
---
So really none of the xp rewards are based off hp anymore unlike osrs being 1:1 (some exceptions)
---
Never change reddit LOL
---
Slayer will tell you what to kill while making money plus with black mask boost its good xp all-round
---
I'd consider Linux, I made the switch and don't regret it one bit. 
---
The only issue is any game with anti-cheat won't work, but gaben himself is working with people to get it going. I personally don't care for those games (overwatch, rust, ECT) but to a lot of people it's important to them.
---
If you have new hardware, everything just works out of the box. Steams proton has fixed 4k or so games to work on Linux, and for everything else Lutris, and Wine works great.
---
Ah jeez you brits and your phrases. Thought it was asked this whole time, just seems like it would make more sense haha
---
I died a few hours ago doing my herb run in morytania, logged in on mobile somehow attacked a feral vampyre and dc’d. Lost my farming pet that i got at 50 farming and I didn’t insure cause I was so sure I wouldn’t die while just skilling.
---
That would balance out though. It would become the best boss to grind, which would mean everyone would grind it more than any other boss, which would make the prices go down to appropriately as all the bossers would be doing zulrah.

A boss that drops one of the best range weapons, best melee helmet, and the attachement to the toxic trident shouldnt BE easily accessible

I love the wildy bosses but dude it is so god damn  annoying just teleing every single kill. Only time I can do vene is when I get a weekday off and can play in the morning.
---
Song is too high leveled. Ironman go for blowpipe way before elf city. Regicide should be the req.
---
I like skilling the most too but I find hunting the most XP where I go towards :)
---
I dont get it
---
Why?
---
Thats how it goes with BR type games. I know people with thousands of games played but under 100 wins. I wouldnt feels too bad about it.
---
Dragon Slayer 2 as mentioned above. Once you complete that, Vorkath is good money. Slayer is always good XP and once you get a little higher GP as well.
---
Mates are guys I drink with. Friends are people I do important shit with. :)
---
ive been playing forever and im still too scared to try it. congrats man
---
Jagex doesn't want you to know this, but that's actually Vorkath's dick, and he can grow a new one.
---
Big fan myself love what they did with the Rev cave update for fishing 2 cant wait for fishing 3

My god you're far up your own ass. I just pointed out your hypocrisy, no need to take it personal. Thanks for adding absolutely nothing by the way, talking about repetition. Your comments and your existence are pointless.
---
Low stats shit gear
---
I wont support any solution to bots that does not directly combat bots.
---
Dont change the game for them. Fix the problem at the sources.
---
Wow, you are so helpful!
---
already existing mechanics that are for looting in pvp. 
---
the fact that looting bags work on stuff that isnt dropped in the wilderness or from direct player kill is just a massive oversight.
---
That was in a time when alternatives to zulrah didn't exist and lots of actual people did it.
---
Any info would help? Are you fighting them with a steel hatchet or a bronze throwing axe maybe?
---
What gear what stats ?
---
