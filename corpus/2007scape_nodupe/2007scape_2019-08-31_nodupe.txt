What are the pk worlds do you mean bounty hunter or pvp worlds or just worlds where people go to pk,if sso which arr these worlds?
---
---
---
What’s near max strength gear? The math I saw on Obby vs just Abby dag + tort/torso/tassies/neitz had Abby dag at better dps at nmz
---
I wonder how possible it is to make a runelite client for export/importing bank templates
---
I imagine there is a forum somehwere where you can buy enough accs per day to return quite an exponential return. Or the bot makers are botting the account making and only doing captcha checkd checks manually, unless some bright mind has found a way to bypass it. Only thing jagex can do in run botwatch and pray it bans them before the money is muled away.
---
Puzzle boxes are easy.
---
I really wish we could just bring untradables above 30 with repair fees I think it would make pking a bit more alive

3 a day should do it, becomes really fast once you get the lumbridge and ardy medium diaries done.

I tweaked, I thought it was casual (0), competitive (100k), and high risk (1m). I see that's not correct now.

I played it during the beta, had no interest to play it in the main game when I saw the main thing I wanted was so pricey.

Yeah, I wish my mom would do this.  But corpses aren’t the best sandwich makers.

The killers don't get the "risk" tho, that parchment disappears.

I tend to go most places with rune pouch (law,dust,fire) for quick teles, but in this case I believe I had chaos in there from recent Vorkath kills.
---
is for you and me
---
is for anywhere and anytime at all down here in the deep blue sea
---
GE item prices are capped at a change of +/-5% a day to counter merching
---
In terms of exp per hp for slayer bosses I think they might be at the top of the list.  They have also been nerfed on the past(less hp I think) so I doubt they are on jagex's radar at this point. I am definitely ok with other changes though and some of yours seem fun.
---
Haha yea right bub
---
Lmao.
---
If you bought 200m why not jus grab a bond
---
Killers do not get the "risk", the parchment just disappears and there's no reward for killing someone in those untradables so it kinda makes the point of "more gear more risk" go out the window.
---
&gt;void melle + salve +piety+ super combat is better than any melle gear for spec

even, say, all that but also with bring, infernal, and prims?

As far as I remember you gotta finish a pretty good chunk of the quest. Pretty much to the point that you may as well finish the quest.
---
It would be an upgrade at kraken boss too, not that you really need it as it's easy enough as it is.
---
&gt;Bank sales at the GE
---
What?  Bank sales were before GE existed weren't they
---
good luck explaining that to people who make strongly worded posts tho
---
Actually, in the professional world this isn't entitled... I'm really inclined to agree with the guy here.
---
You don't publically comment on any projects you're working on if you don't know for sure it's happening. This is very common practice in the software development world, why do you keep shitting on the end consumer for misinterpreting a business statement? This is **why** it's common practice to not disclose future projects, demos or concepts that may not come to fruition, to the general public.
---
this wep was really nice but it destroyed the prices of the rings bec dks became much easier to kill.
---
T
---
Because it's shit and no other company does it.
---
if its his first time p2p, going straight into slayer is the worst possible thing you could do. its very inefficient, he doesnt have any proper gear, and itll take way too long to train. by the time his first bonds run out he wont even have made any money. to buy another bond
---
Not legit he is not quitting. B0aty's actual stream link is twitch.tv/B0aty.
---
You're comparing the difference between the two sets, but that's not the point.
---
The point is that, starting with nothing,  one setup requires 127.9m the other requires 68.8m for higher dps.
---
So your comment should be:
---
&gt;Holy fuck, a non-refundable 50M GP raid-reward upgrade is worth more than a resellable 111.1M* upgrade?
---
&gt;This game is so fucking broken.
---
And then the sarcasm is lost because it's obvious that rigour is the better choice.
---
^^*111.1m ^^for ^^Arma ^^+ ^^pegs

I always take a sandwich. She's giving them away! She just cares about you, surely to god you can just take the sandwich and make her happy

Wait, those are real sandwiches. Did you get one?

at max efficiency at 60 smithing i think steel bars was 1m/hr. probably less now cause of zolcano

why do i care you got hacked? also where did you buy the gold?

get out of here

just pickup ashs at the GE for 200M/hour

We don't grind 24/7 tho, it's regular account stuff, bank standing, Slayer tasks etc. I made it seem like we no life it, in reality we don't use our time wisely lol. Going from fishing to gwd to Slayer etc.
---
Shit
---
why they dont buff cox and give an item through that, idk...?
---
According to wiki she is a demon. She would have to be some sort of demon. Black greater or lesser, doesnt matter still should get slayer xp for one of them (imo).
---
That’s a good point! It’s been a while since I’ve seen one. I hope they’re gone
---
You’re probly 300% right
---
Your first sentence is obvious. And ranged isn’t accurate, it’s just that most monsters in RS have low ranged defense. Your second paragraph is obvious. Why is this getting upvoted
---
With a veng stack too ufc
---
Move lunar to yanille I say
---
Yea honestly the real struggle is in the stages before you can make all the costume room stuff. 200+ clue items feels very very bad.
---
D
---
it's not the players in densely populated areas causing the problem though, it's an external source sending lots of requests or something to the server which causes it to struggle to do anything
---
should be the entire world
---
Isnt the logic that the imps steal these items and when you open them you take the item off then and they fly away?
---
Zolcano drops a lot of mith ore too
---
Something something jagex no test new content

Damn one silver in 3 hours ( i'm late)

Super underrated series on youtube. Keep up the good work

Okay, then what should I be using that same amount of money on instead?

I currently use it to AFK range/cannon tasks, the range is great at skeletal wyverns as well. I don't have the money for dragon hunter stuff.

Hey, there's one thing they changed: they don't respond to support via Reddit anymore, so now you're fucked no matter what you do
---
It's quite an inconvenience, and makes some loot not even obtainable (ranarrs at the bottom not popping up on top of ashes means you'd have to pick up a lot of ashes).
---
Also, I noticed this issue the morning of the update, so while this may sound weird i dont think it was due to the update

Referencing what she says in game
---
Zalcano, raids, and just general drops make irons amass tons of mith ore. Also very possible it wasn’t all from 1 account
---
mm2 or ds2 will be good goals
---
I used sotd 90-96 mage. Tbf the clicks arent that much more considering how much you click on running and switching and picking items and alching them ( while slaying that is). Also to be noted this was before the autocast option was saved. If I'd do that again, I would use ancient staff or kodai just to get def xp from barraging since you cant get it on sots.
---
He will feel it in the morning and you can take that any way you like 🙃

Or I can just use my POH portals.

Good to kno

Dude google quest points rewards osrs

True. But she is Skotizos SISTER. And he is a black/greater demon. They should be the exact same kind of demon.

But when creating a password it thinks it's stronger. For example it won't let you have "password" as a password because it's too weak, but it will let you have "Password".

She doesn't die. According to the person outside zalcano, you're helping to keep her under control
---
Why are you in the nooby cooking spot?
---
Then why is it called a "kill" count? 🤔
---
Literally in a thread about how expensive one of the rewards are.
---
Maybe not useful to the average player, but definitely useful overall.
---
Well, the thing you aren't getting is she was cursed. She was changed to stone so she may not be the same type of demon she was before.
---
Have you gotten one since they updated the keys to not have a cool down?
---
Do I tell him guys?
---
If what you're comparing doesn't have any modifiers like extra base damage or % extra damage/accuracy, it can be pretty simple to calculate which item is better to get. Let's compare Arma chestplate and pegasian boots and their cheap alternatives, blessed dhide. Acp only provides +3 range accuracy, +20 mage defence (5 if you use karil's), nearly no extra melee/range defence, and it carries -7 melee accuracy compared to hides. Pegasian boots offer +5 range accuracy and -1 prayer and similar stats otherwise to dhide boots. Pegs are the much better buy because it has a higher relative accuracy bonus on top of being cheaper, unless you desperately need mage defence.
---
I disagree. Medusa turns people to stone. Are they dead people or are they statues?
---
They probably could but it's really awkward when a crystal is in it
---
Kill the merchant, take the inventory and gold
---
rs3 bad!!!!!
---
On the one hand I'm glad this will get more attention to the ridiculous amount of staking dcs. On the other hand can he please sounds like literally anything else
---
They are risking like 15m minimum though, what do you mean no risk? Your post is literally about how the risk isn't worth it because it's so high.
---
but then again, I have 0 master stashes built to keep my " high value" items in my bank which would legitimately store 50 items, I could box my barrow sets, I could store 28 items in my looting bag, If I was maxed I could get rid of some skilling sups (bad logs,jade,opal) you also don't need decanted pots doses and you can store skill outfits in your home. I'd also not need moulds, tools, etc. which are all obtainable in house fast. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind more bank spaces, but many ironmen chose to hold on useless stuff purely for display or personnal satisfaction and is in no way necessary!
---
Yeah I can’t tell if he’s joking or not.

Membership is obviously on the horizon. Just gonna go snag an IPad so I’m not constantly connected to my phone.

Do quests that are required for diaries or other big quests you'll want to do, since you'll have to knock em out eventually anyways

i’ll be honest, thats a great idea. while i agree its fine now, it could use a little change. not a fan of suggestions like ops but yours hit a reasonable medium

Wintertodt has a KC but never dies, it’s just subdued

I mean I just bought tassys, and then sold them for bludgeon later and I sold my bcp to upgrade amulet and boots and just went back to a torso
---
Good point. WT also is a storm and not a demon that falls to its knees and dies in front of you once you finish the kc.
---
damn man that’s rough. I try to only keep shift drop on during menial shit. i’ve heard horror stories of people shift dropping full graceful instead of equipping and teleporting away
---
83 con was one of the best Investments I made. That and rigour help more than the rest of my great combined
---
If they do desktop GPU like they did mobile, you wouldn't have increased draw distance.
---
missclicked quick prays @ venenatis and now it's gone... luckily I got rigour and so ranging is faster!
---
At that rate you’ll be maxed by this time next year. Nice work
---
It started off decent enough at first but now it's just boring. It's a overrated show for a man doing nothing but set up three swamp traps for 3000 hours and buy implings for irl money each. The old Machima makers like Runescape Gods exposed and Tehnoobshow and RsWillmissit, imo, were a lot better and more entertaining to watch.

Tbf this is as much a statement on Twitch's moderation capabilities as it is on the state of the game and how rampant gold selling and buying is, meaning it's as much a statement on Jagex' moderation capabilities as well.

So I'm at a loss as to what to do. I want to get back into this game, I've done almost all of the f2p quests...combat stats are 30ish, but everytime I log on, I get overwhelmed by all the quests I need to do in members...and then I log off. Are there any guides to quests I should be doing rn? I've done Druidic Ritual so far lmao.
---
Should have used a d scim with those stats
---
Get magic level for Trident of the seas.
---
Get a poh with the pool to restore prayer or alter.
---
Get a rune pouch to hold runes.
---
You don't need a full range switch for ahrim. I find it's best to take a ddp++ and spec him 4 times
---
Prayer flick dharock melee to save prayer. Cause he attacks so slow.
---
Use Runelite to mark the ladder tiles to safepot them in the tunnel easier.
---
I find it's best to kill the brothers in this order. You really only need prayer for three of them.
---
Dharock, karil, ahrim, guthans, torag, veric.
---
Take one prayer pot. You only need a pot if karil and ahrim spawn in the tunnel.
---
Unless you can't safespot dharock.
---
Kill all brothers and two skeletons and one bloodworm in the tunnels for Max runes and no bolt racks.
---
no need, i never get hit, i just take care of ahrim and karil first and bring an extra dose of ppot if hes my tunnel. DFS helps p much negate all damage and a clan wars tele lets me insta heal anwayas after a run (I dont come close to dying). With this method i average like 5-6 min chests.
---
Blowpipe is similar to where the whip is for melee.
---
It's the first and most obvious big boy upgrade you get when you get the level for it. At 70 in all melee skills, you'll probably have enough for a whip. At 75 ranged, provided you've actually been playing the game, you'll probably have enough money for a blowpipe, maybe a few thousand scales, maybe 500 darts, and some black d'hide.
---
it would involve automation if you wanted it to sort the bank so it's possible but also very bannable

Whats the gp/hr doing this?

"you're actually coming closer?" Says third form glough, while PULLING YOU CLOSER

You can't just protect against ddos attacks in games. Posts like this fucking annoy me because they're ragging at jagex about something they literally can't solve. This isn't a fucking website where only one response needs to get through, it's a game that needs constant, stable connection.
---
Jagex is not at fault here.
---
&gt;a 15% autocast would still be better 
---
obviously a 15% autocast would be better than a 5% autocast??
---
my point is that 5% autocast is way better than 15% manual casting. 
---
the 10% dmg is nothing compared to then 10s of hours in def saved just to 99 slayer, hundreds of hours saved to 200m
---
Yeah I've hardly ever PvPed in my RS career, certainly never briding (although i do understand it) and I'm having a blast challenging people at my skill level and the people better than me. Switches are hard on mobile but the free practice is great.
---
Great posts btw. Very enlightening. Keep up the great work op
---
Remove non-bis rugs. It's time
---
put a ring on it
---
The gauntlet is trash.
---
Some runs I don't have to use any pots or sharks but other runs I use multiple of each. Just wondering if I need more magic gear since I mage all the brothers except ahrims.
---
fire wave + tome of fire + occult is better dps and is cheaper than trident until 88 magic.
---
Zolcano.
---
Go for rune gloves from recipe for disaster! Thinking about doing the entirety of recipe for disaster and getting barrows gloves can be a little bit overwhelming for newer players IMO, going for rune gloves lets you choose the lower requirement subquests and you can feel like you're getting good progress in your account quicker. I rocked rune gloves for a fairly long time before I decided to finish RFD.
---
For set 1, why is the DPS jump so large from 111 range to 110?
---
I'm using barrows to train mage. I'm at 72 mage and 52 construction. I'd love the pool at my house but I use clan wars.
---
Appreciates response
---
Draws mop
---
It's the only game that's targeted because ddos attacks aren't free and the servers aren't that powerful. Of course it's harder to ddos games like league and fortnight when they have 10,000 times the server capacity, but even then it STILL happens sometimes.
---
Saying "just get ddos protection lol" is fucking stupid, it costs an absurdly disproportionate amount more to protect against ddos attacks than it does to launch them. Other games handle ddos better simply because they have way more servers because they have way more players, not because they have some magical state of the art ddos protection.
---
I've seen you in my former clans cc and I feel a strange sense of solidarity with your name

don’t use mage arena cape. either get ma2 or use fire cape. magic attack is worthless

It’s not the bus drivers fault a bomb was secretly put on the bus, not his fault the government couldn’t catch the criminal placing the bomb there. When you go outside, you take the risk of dying by some random psychopath, getting hit by a car, or terrorist attack. So, the bus driver ramming his bus bomb into a school instead of the completely open field on the right is completely fine by your logic. Is it the bus drivers fault a bomb was places? No. It became his fault when he intentionally drove into the school when he coulda drove to his right into the field and avoided killing anyone else.

It's not particularly hard to throttle an IP when it hit's a bandwidth usage higher than it's maximum allowance. Even easier since OSRS clients use so little data, you would need an \_insane\_ amount of individual IPs to DDoS the server if any type of validation system is in place \_above\_ the game server.  
---
A 300M$ value company can 100% afford to mitigate DDoS threats much more effectively than what Jamgliflex is currently doing while remaining profitable, they simple choose not to.

Maybe... But I'd lose my accuracy bonus...

Mlm probably pumps many times more mithril and coal into the game, the reason its so cheap is that the alch price of mith items is relatively low. It  adamantite, and runite are pretty much price locked to the items they smith.

ok too far

No prayer - 1 kill per minute of combat (not counting banking), comes out to \~20k profit per minute of combat
---
Rigour - 41 seconds for a kill, rigour is actually such a big boost here that it's cheaper per kill to have rigour on, so you make slightly more gold per kill AND you kill roughly 50% more dragons (while in combat, not counting banking time here)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So it's not even close, profit is about 50% higher with rigour on.
---
Suicide is badass!

Because it's hard. These people have a strong financial incentive to find new ways to scam/bot/cheat and avoid detection measures. Jagex is (almost) always trying to catch up.

Ahrims with occult and torm is significantly better dps than void mage. You can lookup bitterkoekje's dps calc if youd like to get the exact numbers. It's hard to say why you're low on food without seeing an example. Most commonly it's because the person isn't fully used to the rotations and loses dps because they switch late into phases. Would be happy to help you further if you post a vid.

&gt;People should be able to stream content when they want and how they want, so long as it's not breaking any rules. Is this wrong?

No, it's not.  However, there comes a problem when something happening to him is causing *others* problems as well and not just him.  He has a way to solve it by logging out, blacking out the stream for a minute, then swapping worlds so the people doing this to him can't crash the world.
---
Yes you are correct. Z spear is only better dps at corp.
---
I stopped carrying defensive shield at dks long time ago. Avernic is straight up better. With sang you can actually go on normal spellbook to alch random stuff for extra 300k or so.

Might be able to do the one before seers for marks until level 70. Should check the wiki, I can’t remember at what level the spawn rate decreases for each course.
---
Why?
---
Upgrading server capacity to mitigate a ddos doesn't just mean doubling the amount of requests the servers can simultaneously handle. In fact I can't even give you valid factor because I have no idea how large the attacks are. A factor of 10 would probably be an absolute minimum attempt, are you seriously suggesting that jagex increases their server capacity 10x on the mild chance that this would be enough to make a difference? Jagex probably already knows the general scale of the attacks, if it could be solved by doubling server capacity I'm sure they would have already done that.
---
I use for clue items I don't have a full set for, rather have barrows out in the bank

I'm not British, so my first assumption was a different kind of bbc...

Intentionally crashing a specific world and then creaming himself over doing it.
---
Ike? What?
---
&gt; Are you really comparing Jagex to Amazon &amp; Microsoft? Don't be so foolish.
---
No. I'm saying that you can fairly easily leverage existing infrastructures to help mitigate.
---
&gt; It's a lot harder than you seem to think.
---
The goal is never to make DDoSing impossible just to mitigate it to make it as cost inefficient as possible for the attackers to perform and limit the impact on the live systems.
---
Of course it's hard! That's why I'm saying that they should remove themselves from the lower layers as much as possible by letting dedicated services do the work for them.
---
Jagex is a gaming company not networking experts. They've been having the same problems for years and have not come even close to fixing it. Sometimes doing things in-house is a bad idea.
---
Its also somewhat of a holdover from the olden days of pking. People gave way more of a shit about honor in pvp (i.e. no farcasting, no overheads) back in like 2007. Nowadays its just used since its convenient and useful distinguishing terminology
---
Marks only spawn on rooftop courses, and only on those that are within 20 levels for you (so canifis no longer spawns marks at 60, seers at 80, etc.)
---
At 60 seers is definitely the best even without the diary, but yeah try to do the diary first.
---
What doest "tyfrs" stand for? I see it all the time at BA. Thank you for Runescape?
---
Ahrims. Void is garbage
---
If you die at any GWD boss or dks for example, using the full set to get back there would reduce a lot of the hassle. You dont have to spam click food trying not to get stacked out at armadyl while you're trying to pick your items back up. Also you could bring them along initially for a dks trip if you're just learning them or only wanna safespot rex, you lose 3 inv spots but you can walk in like you own the place and get to a nice spot before attacking them. Also since there's no requirements to equip the gear, skillers or lower levels would be able to use them too. One notable spot the set would be good at for lower levels is the Ourania altar (ZMI altar). Its very good for runecrafting xp but there are mid level enemies between the bank and the altar, and if you're a level 3 skiller, you cant do this method because you'd get one shot but if you wore the Burial Wrappings you'd be able to. Those are the big uses that I can think of, I'd imagine there's more uses particularly for low levels but I cant think of any more at the moment.

Stonks on Rigour incoming

I wish we could float like the lunar people. Would be so sick for bank standing.
---
Why would you kill her?
---
\&gt;I guess Sony, blizzard, EA, steam, epic games, and Microsoft are all incompetent then, because all of their networks have been hit offline within the last 5 years.
---
 I have yet to see a server from a competent dev company get ddosed like this.  
---
\&gt;That kind of mitigation would be worse than just lagging the entire world in osrs because people will die while the servers keep ticking.
---
Thats.... essentially what happened here anyway.
---
Nah, I got crafting to 3 on Tut island lol
---
It’s not against the rules but just be wary of putting too much into the account as whoever you’re sharing the account with can basically steal it from you after hours of grinding.
---
It’s cuz the people with dhcb and rigour got it figured out, while those asking questions are short of money to get both.
---
Eventually The game kicked everyone and game me second. Rip my highest kill game. One of the boosters got first. He bragged about his new cape.  Scum indeed
---
Am I the only plebian that used Runescape's hint system for quests? 
---
You got 4 points a day I believe, and could unlock a new hint for one

 point, or straight up be shown what to do for two or three points
---
Chop chop!
---
Any one of these options:
---
- Zenyte jewelry
---
- Chinchompas to train with
---
- Dragon crossbow
---
- Pegasian boots
---
- Gear for your other combat styles
---
- 83 construction + house
---
- Specialty gear for what you plan on doing. ACB kinda falls under this category, but is really bad value unless you plan on doing something that massively benefits from that extra tile of range like the inferno.
---
- massive amounts of supplies, so you can offensive pray nonstop, use a blowpipe instead, etc
---
- continue saving and get rigour
---
It would definitely affect pvp but I dont think all fights would revolve around using the spell. Its 1/6 chance when you don't splash that they can't attack you for 5 seconds, but then they're immune to getting stunned again for 35 seconds. Because of this I'm not sure if it would be worth using in 1v1s. I'd imagine the meta would still be freezing and running underneath them and trying to get attacks in without getting hit. For larger groups of pkers fighting each other I think it would be more interesting to use though. I'm going to be honest though, I don't really pk much, so take what I say with a grain of salt lol.
---
Some helpful players will offer to trim your armour or double your money. Do what they say as this will make your experience within runescape a lot better.

---
Shows how little I know, I actually thought overloads gave more of a boost then normal super potions did. TIL.
---
Honestly, all it takes is to go through every item in your bank and do a quick, "Do I *actually* have a use for this?" 
---
I end up clearing like 100 items every 6 months or so
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind
---
It's easier when people help out lmao
---
Please. When you put 300 hours into CoX and only have 2 anc hats, a buckler and 4 arcanes to your name, but also150k silver ore, that drop buff would be appreciated.

Doesnt this mean you can just go in and farm off these pleb bots?

This guy is probably merching kodai wands. He's not mentioning the fact kodai is only good in situations involving bursting for slayer while ancestral is superior in all situations with magic, such as with a trident or a sanguinesti staff. He's also using Eternals and a Master Wand to bump up the cost of Set 1 while casually avoiding a non slayer task setup so as not to add onto the cost. For instance, assuming just the weapon and cape for Set 2 because you're poor while using a full ancestral set for Set 1, you would get equal DPS with each set.
---
Lastly, the Arcane artificially boosts the price of set 1 significantly despite the fact DPS is almost the same with a Book of Darkness or Malediction Ward. If you buy everything without the Arcane in set 1, your total cost would only be 127m compared to 81m. This 127m is better than the 81m kodai because you can't use a trident with a kodai wand but you can with the ancestrals.
---
Just buy the ancestral, get a book of darkness and use an ancient staff for bursting. Don't be dumb.
---
This is what happens when virgins cannot grasp the concept of attractive females playing AND genuinely enjoying RS.

You're right, he's playing a fucking video game with a 10 minute video treating it as if he's making some 'high noveau art', when in reality it's literally picking the most autistic skills and activities to repeat for 400 hours like doing nothing but chopping dead trees for 43 days or walking on temple trekking forever. Sure there's fun challenges like those "loot for 1 hour, and then we duel" series or the fun machimas, but all that he literally does is settle in a swamp and play just boring boring inefficent silly methods like he's some adhd messiah of clicking on the logs for 47 hours or something. He's so full of himself and it's such a dumb series that he gets all salty over.
---
My thoughts. The 40m I made at them last task is no joke.
---
I completely forgot about the Sufferring
---
Where would you want the Seers ring though? Its only +8 magic accuracy which is barely anything. If you are bursting then any prayer ring would be better.
---
He stopped being a victim the moment he purposely logged into a very specific world with the intent to cause harm to other players. He literally taunted HCIMs on stream before he did so. He might not be the one pulling the trigger but he sure as hell is aiming the gun.
---
The video proof is literally in front of you. He's intentionally causing harm to other players. If you want to argue semantics then "one that is acted on and usually adversely affected by a force or agent" applies to everyone who d/c'd because of him since he was INTENTIONALLY directing ddos attempts at the specific world while he camped the safezone, waiting for the world to drop. I'm not sure how else to explain it to get through your thick skull.
---
You can play devil's advocate all you want but i'm not interested in wasting time on a clown, much less the whole circus.
---
\&gt; The mitigation is a waste of money, so why would jagex attempt it? 
---
Because it isnt?  Not for the players?  Backup servers/generally more robust server infrastructure are never a waste of money lmfao, not when the vast majority of the games top hcims lose status due to dcs and death item timers literally have to be 60 min due to server volatility.  And the bigger/more robust a server is, the harder it is to effectively ddos.  The power of ddos isnt that it magically works-its that you can put in enough effort that you could make it work if you out-effort the other guy.

"HEY COMMUNITY WANT SOME REWARDS FOR THIS PVP MINI GAME, O BTW THEY WILL BE WORTHLESS AFTER A WEEK HE"
---
The problem I'm seeing in a lot of comments is that this post ended up being somewhat misleading. You used the 145m Arcane and that immediately bumped up the cost of set 1 by almost double but the Arcane cost is so small compared to the big bold price.
---
Likewise, the big question at the top is misleading people because it doesn't specify that this test is entirely for bursting. It doesn't look like a lot of people looked at the fine print about this being specifically in a bursting/barraging scenario and a lot of people seem to think buying Kodai is always the way to go and that Ancestral is actually useless comparatively when, in fact, Ancestral is better in most situations requiring mage simply because you can use a trident with it.
---
It would be like if this post tested a sanguinesti staff compared to max mage and a Kodai against a single target. The Sang staff will probably win out but it doesn't mean it beats the Kodai in every situation. I hope next time you make a post like this you'll actually be more direct about the situational nature of many upgrades than just adding little notes at the bottom which people obviously did not read.
---
Might as well get ~90 while you're at it, max out your POH
---
Not having the -5 prayer of the ancient staff is the real upgrade
---
If you put this through a voice reader it sounds like a 25 buttholes dialogue.
---
It sure was a learning experience :') Now, if you will excuse me I need to farm clue scrolls. I want my master scroll back :')
---
And then it will crash when all the people who bought one realize that for 95% of them it's only good for bursting/barraging and they were better off keeping their ancestrals.
---
Does this even increase the total revenue these days? 10 mins vids used to be the optimal way to trick the algorithm and incorporate the most amount of ads like 4 years ago.

&gt;the definitely not important black mask and regular salve amulet

You can imbue them and then create the Slayer Helm or enchant the Salve Amulet and they'll keep the imbue. You can even break apart the Slayer Helm (i) and get a Black Mask (i) back.
---
So you can go ahead and inbue if you dont have  the slayer points to unlock helm crafting or you havent done tarns miniquest.

For context: 21 bots join the lobby to start the game and then immediately leave. This means that the boosters get points in a minimal amount of time. This streamer wasn't the one using the bots.
---
Uhh they do use dhcb and rigour because it’s the best setup. Also, my advice to you. Get 95 range before you camp vorkath
---
I get the sentiment, but it more becomes "Neither of us have a realistic chance of killing each other, so you're wasting both of our time and resources"
---
If in an edge fight both players use protect melee, then the fight is almost certainly going to end with one person walking out when they run out of food. And to get to that point, will take longer than if both players just didn't use protection prayers.
---
Sv scum
---
What you're not seeing is 100 people cramped up at the front, disobeying the queue.

And then theres the people skipping the odd item quest because it's really exp inefficient.

Skipping quests in WoW isn't like skipping quests in OSRS, 95% of the time the quest is meaningless.

Nah, being able to pay 500k to bring an infernal cape is fucked when it gives the same strength bonus as a b ring(i) is fucked. The parchments need to be high risk/high reward.
---
Don't try to claim that because they did the inferno they deserve it, nearly every single person in singles teams are buying 150M infernal capes from the same dude.
---
It's skewed because, after rereading your graphic, it's never explicitly stated this is for bursting/barraging.
---
I probably replied to another comment of yours about this, but this graphic was very misleading in that if you're a player who doesn't really ever burst tasks and isn't hyper efficient, then all this post does is show a weapon that does more dps than a shit ton of high tier armor.
---
It's a problem in OSRS which the high level community needs to think about if they don't want this game turning into RS3 (Severe end game focused community with a perpetually dwindling low level community, leading to more aggressive microtransactions because end gamers pay more than noobs). The casual community isn't nearly as knowledgeable on efficiency as you - a lot of people train mage with a trident and melee dust devils. I'm not asking you to stop making these posts, just that it would be very appreciated if you specifically detailed all the specifics and the downsides of various pieces of gear.
---
For instance, with your post about Rigour (bringing that back into this) you didn't mention the fact that it eats up twice as many prayer points as Eagle Eye which makes it less useful for players camping certain enemies for profit (Skeletal wyverns come to mind. You want your dps boosting prayers to last until your next prayer pot drop while camping them).
---
Of course, if you're in the High level community that doesn't matter. The problem is not everyone is an efficient player and some people just play an hour or two a day and want to make money towards their next weapon goal and it's bad with Rigour when they cannot resell the thing after realizing it eats up so much god damn prayer (literally only place I use Rigour is Kree because I'd rather take 8% longer to do my bloodveld tasks).
---
Also, strange request I know, but could you compare getting a fire cape, barrows gloves and a nezzy over full bandos, combat bracelet, obby cape, and a dmed?
---
Someone hacked you, did sote did zalcano. Then you got reset /s
---
Is that a question or
---
i thought the pvmers voting no on pvp polls was a meme... lol
---
I rate that. I didn't know for sure at the time, but dropping most of my bank for rigour was the better decision. Down with everyone who ever doubted me!

Doing like air runes or some shit is incredibly slow. Great news though, at 23 you can start lavas. They're like 50k/hour with only small/med pouch but they are incredibly click intensive.
---
At higher levels you can do zmi which will range from like 15-40k/hour on your way up to 77. It is slower than lavas but much less clicking.
---
Nah, that’s not how economics works
---
&gt;People will suddenly buy lots of Kodais
---
Price increase, not a decrease. If people are buying because of this post, not all of them will resell, meaning fewer on the market, which will cause the price to rise.
---
For what, defence? I guess it's worth it if you have money sitting around, but not for one of these comparison shots. If you're asking if its worth it over a swamp trident, which is actually a cheaper upgrade - its not even close to being worth it
---
Where did you die with it?
---
You could still be a 100% free player to avoid them completely. Gratz anyway!

I always said RS is the most fun not fun game out there. IDK why I play it, there are so many more actually fun games to play and yet here we are.

Not gonna lie, I'm not a fan of the whole lucky impling meta NOT BECAUSE he's paying for them, but more of because it seems... I don't know, uncreative?
---
It seems like whatever he's lacking for the ToB can be just gimmicked by hunting enough implings just because they have such a massive drop table. Then again, ToB would probably would be impossible without lucky implings so... eh.
---
thats a great idea
---
&gt;Quests seem a lot of effort with very little pay off.
---
The opposite. In terms of payout per effort, quests are far and away the best thing in game. Do you actually think killing a few lizqrdman shamans is better payout per effort than quest rewards??

How do you determine whether or not it's worth it to use super combat pots? I'm killing blue dragons for slayer, and assumed that the increased kill speed (~4k/kill) made up for the cost of the super combat pots (~2.2k/dose), but I have no idea how to calculate DPS in this game

I mean I'm almost certain your just trolling at this point because you refuse to acknowledge that the psn was taken down by ddos attacks for an entire week. The fact that your recommendation is to just get stronger servers shows you have no idea what you're talking about. You're right that better servers would improve qol and reduce random lag but beyond that, not so much. The cost of an attack is absurdly cheap compared to the cost of getting a server that can handle attacks, I don't think you understand this part.  I keep using famous examples like the psn attack just to highlight how ridiculously massive ddos attacks can get. They're no joke, getting stronger servers isn't the answer when the attackers can just use more machines. 
---
You're also not wrong that we should be able to reconnect or something after a DC. There are definitely a lot of networking issues with osrs, and maybe if those issues were fixed I would be more inclined to agree that valve has some options. In the games current state though, jagex can't expect to handle ddos attacks.

Agreed, though the tbow and scythe have no special attacks. So I would suggest removing it to be in-line with those weapons.
---
The point system is completely busted
---
I was answering the reply concerning master wand not kodai
---
Same for ducks I imagine then?
---
youre entitled to your opinion but imo moving away from different items having identical models and sprites is a good thing. would love to see a change like this to all the different magic staves that are impossible to distinguish at a glance
---
The record is like a day lol so 36 days is pretty fucking bad.
---
Context?
---
Make priests reward prayer experience for giving them pages as a way for them to study the gods. 
---
Pages will hold more value based off of gp/xp as well as pages being removed from the player economy. 
---
Pages would be capped at like 1 page per day (or 1 page per god per day) and work like a daily task that you complete similar to battlestaves.
---
This would result in only the cheapest pages being used, which is fine because higher demand pages can already hold their value. Also, ironmen with excess pages cant do much with theirs once they fill all their books so they would be the ones handing in zammy/arma pages.
---
Really cool staff idea. I ran some numbers and using the same formula the other powered staves use, your new staff would have a max hit of 72 while overloaded to 120 magic in max mage.
---
Compare this to the sanguinesti which has a max hit of 47 in the same setup and you can work out that the dps between the two staves is only like 2% more with the Forlorn Staff. Of course, using the special attack is a different thing altogether. The Forlorn Staff has 23% more dps than the sanguinesti while the special attack is active.
---
This is assuming the accuracy is the same between the two staves. Arcane + sanguinesti accounts for 45 magic bonus, this is more than what you suggest 40 magic bonus for the Forlorn Staff. This is fine because it makes comparing the two setups very easy, 5 less magic bonus barely affects the dps of a magic setup. 
---
So, considering this is a suggestion for the new BiS magic weapon from raids 3, I think the dps should be a touch higher than 2% over the current max mage setup. The twisted bow and scythe both can hit over 80 and are both 5 tick weapons. Pushing the max hit of the staff to 59 at 99 magic from 52 would mean that the max hit would be 81 at 120 magic and max mage, equating to 15% more dps than the current best dps setup for magic. What do you think?
---
&gt; If, like 95% of the playerbase, you're a filthy casual (like me \o/ ), you're probably going to buy Ancestral first whenever you get the money. Likewise, if you're an EHPer you probably already have enough money for max mage because you have a bunch of rune dragon alts so honestly why not just buy it all?
---
whole point of the post is to help casuals who want to play with a more efficient mindset but don't know how to get started to understand that kodai is better than ancestral for slayer and mage training

nice organisation bro but not really endgame when you've hardly been to GWD

I would like it wear if i hold down up or down on price it starts moving on its own and greater speeds, instead of only moving 1 gp up or down

I like it. It makes more sense given that we carved it ourselves out of a branch.

You can get a +3 boost with tea from teak shelves 2 at level 67..  or you can still get a +5 with spicy stew.. I’m a believer in just training the levels anyway, but you can certainly still boost for an early spirit tree even though you can’t use crystal saw

done at zammy , done at bandos (not in the pic but just now) , 400 dry sara , got ags , not because i'm unlucky that it's not endgame :p i got that, cox and tob and im done with all my goals, nearly maxed too.

goals are obviously subjective but that's endgame for me !

I've seen a lot of these in the last few hours. I think Reddit is having some issues rn

I played on different accounts throughout the years, then got busy with school, EOC came out and I tried to like it, but soon after I quit. Made a new acc for OSRS and bada bing bada boom!

Okay, thanks.

And yeah, Reddit’s not working well atm.

Blowpipe flicking is easy enough since you just click every tick. I do that at DKs to conserve prayer, since I'm not at all interested in flicking prot magic vs Prime

But you have the Skilling sets there in your bank, atleast 16 spots could be freed with just the mahogany armor case

Even that tweetfest is speculation on Ash's part. In no clear terms does he confirm that's the case. Smh

BA is still going strong, although you may have a hard time finding a team at too low of a level.
---
Have they lowered it? I thought dragon defenders were 1/100.
---
Found it, however I dont have that option.
---
That's amazing dude. Congrats on 99! I tried souls but I prefer bloods for more afk.
---
Socks don't match. I hate it
---
Oh my that's a lot, do you kill the boss once then have to do another 40?
---
Honestly you can def keep grinding for more cash in f2p but if you were to just buy a bond yourself, you would end up being able to train and money making skill exponentially faster with the wide variety of methods available to memebers. A huge thing is all the different quests for players of all sorts of levles. You can follow an optimal quest guide or a build guide like a zerker on to set your account up with some great skill xp and melee xp

justiciar is metal too.

And torags has -30/-10, -21/-7 to magic/ranges while justiciar has a extra -10 for no reason.

It just doesn't look right.

Took it outta my mouth lmao
---
I'm not a 100% sure, but, I was rooting my phone and downloaded a couple of tools that were well reviewed 2 years ago on XDA. It's possible one of the tools developers stopped maintaining it, allowing a hacker to take over the website and package in a RAT with the tool. Though, I have no idea why they'd go for my runescape account and not my emails or social media or any other important open stuff
---
even if the magic defense was +0 you wouldn't use it for tanking magic anyway.

How am I supposed to use the fairy rings with a battlestaff?

poor guy had such streaming potential before getting DDOS'd :(

Some people don’t use Twitter. For example, I would never have saw this if it wasn’t posted.

This works for players too but nobody does it out of embarrassment
---
There are several different iOS versions which could be a possible cause. In the future, know that iOS updates usually have extremely harmful effects to the phone, so it’s best not to ever update iOS unless it’s necessary.
---
Entertaining? Your bar must be extremely low.
---
So they can stack up a shit ton of points and then but a bond.
---
Except you don't need rigour to pay for itself.  Rigour is by a pretty large margin the most cost effective buff to your account, and it immediately rewards you by increasing profit and xp rates by a larger margin than any other upgrade.  Rigour doesn't represent lost value just because the number runelite shows on your bank goes down.
---
I thought so too, but I got from steel to rune in under 100, (1/50 each) then the Dragon within the next ~15ish

I've added you, thank you in advance for your help in whatever form it comes in (encouraging words, advice, teaming up on bosses, etc.)

Haven’t killed other bosses yet I wanted to learn this safespot, I have screenshots of pickaxe and maybe ring but I was mad about d2h (

A niche item is something that is helpful but only in certain circumstances. The wrappings set ability is helpful, but only in certain circumstances, so I'd consider filling a niche for sure. I don't believe every reward even from endgame content has to be the best ever. So long as most of the rewards are good enough to be useful, which I personally believe is the case here (Keep in mind I am very biased though lol) then people will continue doing that content. I don't think every reward from raids has to be combat related either, which is why I tried to think of something with a niche use outside of PvM and this is the idea I came up with. I understand its not huge and gamechanging for you or I, but it does have a target audience it would affect. Skillers/low levels I could imagine using it the most so they don't get head shot when walking by aggressive npcs. It would also help prevent quite a bit of hassle when it comes to learning/retrieving your gravestone at certain bosses. Out of the list its definitely the troll drop on the table, but whats wrong with that? Jagex loves adding troll drops to things, not to mention it would fit thematically with a desert themed raid. In general I wouldn't say its useless at all, for me personally idk if I'd use it, but items don't have to cater to everyone in the game. Those are just some of my opinions, but don't get me wrong, I definitely see where you're coming from.
---
ya that def does sounds like a classic osrs bot operation hah
---
They are so unaware of the second order effects of such decisions.
---
So far, day of release has allowed to farm a fuck ton of points by abusing the system, so more blades have been made, so actual pkers will earn less from their skill and long-term blades will be at way lower prices because of this shit.
---
rs3 reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I mean gratz, but also I despise you.
---
I would start training farming and slayer for decent money and hunter and crafting for bird houses
---
Edit: also feel free to pm me if you need any help!!! :)
---
there never was a doubt about it
---
If you don’t have maxed house I would say rimmingron

If you just got it, you know the spot I'm in, you definitely are the person to tell me! Thanks!

Mlm is also a huge source if mithril ore
---
I was under the impression the redirect was made by the admins to begin with.  Regardless you administrate a wiki for free, you ain't got no clout so don't come at me like you do.
---
It wasn't breaking anything either.  I wouldn't want the whole wiki filled with them but wasn't the redirect made by admins to begin with? It's been mentioned here several times months ago so I have no idea why you would delete it now.
---
I like hosidous because its close to the farm patch lol
---
500 for pet is well below drop rate lol
---
.... you mean exactly like the other god halos...?
---
If you think it's awesome, go and get them?
---
I don't recognize a single part of this imagine as RuneScape
---
I have a hard time understanding why someone would have such a strong reaction against the mere existence of the game mode though. I like ironman mode because with normal accounts you can pretty much just buy everything so it's not nearly as impressive
---
You mean the ones from castle wars? It's on my to do list. I'm too busy getting base 90s atm

I was actually shocked when I had to complete it for a clue step. A hard step I think right?

Dude weed lmao
---
No, it literally doesn’t work on certain things such as potato cacti is what he’s saying
---
it could’ve been your first screenshot too.
---
Oh I see thanks, I was confused. Thought maybe I'd missed a reward or something in the shop.
---
I disabled Xbox shit, probably doesn't work for me
---
I plan on building it up to serve my needs so I’m self sufficient but still go to party’s for dungeons and stuff
---
Hey thanks for the comment and I'm glad you like the concept of the staff! You're right, the balancing on the staff is off from that of the Tbow and Scythe and likely needs a little more to it. The tweaked numbers to the staff you're proposing sound pretty good to me, I'm just afraid that if people hear the max hit is 81 they would instantly vote no. Thanks for taking interest in the staff and working out some better balancing for it, I appreciate it!
---
Which dart tips? Addy or Mith?
---
There's a discord named essence runners I think search it,I'll link later if you don't find it. You can find it in oakdice video
---
Dragon crossbow is quite cheap and can shoot the same bolts.
---
The better bolts with acb over rcb make a bit of a difference.
---
What u mean?
---
Yeah. I'm sitting at 2 superior gardens and 3 portal rooms still lol.
---
Most bots are suicide bots so having to buy a bond to cash out is hindering them a lot either way.
---
The mobile trial does exist too, but accounts wouldn't be able to grind lms in f2p then use it to cash out.
---
I don't see why the cheap option doesn't get barrows gloves/snakeskin boots/a hat, that seems a little wrong to me.  There's no reason why somebody using a 60m+ setup wouldn't have those.
---
I get that the point is to show the power of rigour but surely to do that accurately you should show it when used in a full setup.
---
What gear setup do you use? Veracs? With spicy stews?
---
I don't know Jagex' situation, nor do I want to justify their bad support system. But from someone that has been on the other side of support tickets: getting angry will almost always achieve the opposite, as they will probably put you at the bottom of their priority list. They are still people just trying to do their job.
---
Let this man keep his money, he's going to need it for the therapy
---
Idk why youre being downvoted. As someone who is colorblind I had no problem doing the quest. Youd have to suffer from severe acromatopsia (black/white vision) for this to be much of a problem. Perhaps some people might have issues with the yellow and green, but I have my doubts.  People tend to sensationalize colorblindness
---
Interesting approach. Whether it's a good one or not, I'm not sure
---
Took me 4-5k tokens for dragon defender. At least 10 hours :(
---
Be proud quiter.
---
You could actually debate if a Shield falls under armor or weapon since it does use a weapon slot (i.e. 2H Weapons). In RS3, I think they made shields their own seed separate from weapons and armor, but they also had more weapons.
---
But with how OSRS does it, it wouldn't make sense to use an Armor Seed. Armor refers to the set with a set effect for the Crystal Bow; the shield is not part of that set. Also, it would be problematic since Armor Seeds are unique to The Gauntlet so letting you buy them would hurt that. And anyone who picked a Shield but planned to recharge it into a Bow or the other way around would suddenly be stuck with a different item. So it makes more sense to just keep the classic items as "weapons" and make new seeds for the new pieces.
---
Overused comment.
---
To be fair if you do say anything negative about Settled you do get downvoted.
---
I have a level 101 1580 total mobile only account started on release, got my firecape last week. Being mobile only gives me a weird sense of pride
---
dont give up man! :) recommended always do corrupted.
---
I don't give a fuck.
---
Checked your post history to come to that conclusion. But yeah the tasteless, non-constructive criticism is part of it.
---
Light 'em up boys! Liiiight them up!
---
You shouldve used it for slayer helmet. You can get a tattered head guaranteed I think after a certain amount.
---
probably uses the same shit for everything
---
The same thing happened when osrs launched.
---
The fact that you get to have the whole community there suffering along with you makes it fun.
---
Don't give a fuck.
---
It's almost like colorblindness is a spectrum where things don't apply the same way to other people with colorblindness. My friend can't tell the difference between green and red, blue is white to him as well.
---
What’s the ideal setup for miscellania on a main account?
---
Most quests in osrs are required for other quests.
---
There's very few quests that don't lead to another or are required for something.
---
Romeo and Juliet is probably the most worthless quest in osrs
---
It doesn't.
---
I don't care about other people getting 99 cooking stop telling me
---
Who said it was hard
---
Is that your rsn too? I ran into someone with your Reddit name as their rsn at guantlet the other night
---
&gt; If they skull up on you using that spell and miss a couple times which is very likely, it gives the other player a longer opportunity to anti-rush them.
---
That's not really how that works. Freeze them and hit em with the stun and then go in.
---
&gt;affect xp rate a bit
---
*all* combat skills + slayer by 5% is more than a bit, *AND* pvp veng combos/ags/dharok would be so fucked up - it would kill pvp
---
&gt;I do believe a slight buff over occult for one spellbook would be fairly reasonable though
---
Why? It doesn't need a buff. Having an idea doesn't make it a good idea or balanced.
---
&gt;The wrappings have niche uses, primary convenience for getting items back on death, and helping skillers/lower levels do certain content they might not be able to do currently.
---
ZMI immunity? :/
---
&gt;Like I said in the post though, I'm not the best as balancing so if these reward designs were looked into for actually being adding in the real game, many changes would have to be made to them all. When it comes to the concepts of each item I think its fairly balanced
---
???
---
How is a concept balanced but everything about them isn't? I really struggle to understand.
---
How dare you post an accomplishment and decide what to do with your own reward. You should be *ashamed*.
---
I have never experienced this kind of issue myself but your best bet would be emailing the support team. Hope it helps!
---
Nah there's a few variations of this name out there but I'm not one
---
Too bad you werent an ironman😝
---
Not that I saw
---
Hey congrats man! I'm about 50 kills from finishing my task so fingers crossed
---
Dead man mode?

Damn what drained your stats?
---
I tired looking for their email, but i couldn't find it
---
But so is the glade tele on the xeric's talisman
---
Void mage is very bad and pretty much only used in places you want to save on switches
---
Is buying a cannon worth the investment? I only have 1.3 mil right now.

Do your birdhouse runs

Look at this dude with his 1 quest point.

Ty :)
---
OSRS was only released in 2013 though
---
Well done my dude
---
Are you saying this item would increase the chance of all pets or just bossing pets? Either way I doubt the community would ever vote to make pets easier to obtain
---
10k an hour? Youre not banking fast enough. Rc is a race against the clock.

Gl
---
You are still crying that I called pkers thieves?
---
Grow up dude it's been 2 days.
---
Are you sure about mystics? I'm pretty sure I've attacked from max tbow range before during team CM runs and still had the mystic attack me, but it's not like I was specifically trying to test it so I can't say for sure I'm remembering right, so I'd have to try it out next time I end up doing a team raid.
---
Awesome
---
I love the invisible boost idea. Support
---
It is a definite possibility that some leg-pulling may be occurring. Having never read the TOS I can't verify.
---
Ripp
---
wow thats stupid. how easy is it to recover someone else's account ? Is there a way I can make it harder to recover my account?
---
Its not only happening to maxed players. Ive gotten them too, 1805 total. Gotta love the max players putting themselves on a pedestal
---
Why no scythe tho
---
I only change my poh location if I'm doing something in an area for an extended amount of time and just want fast easy teleports. Other than that if it's not in rimmington I have to tele to fally and run to rimmington if I want to use a poh on 330 and it makes it way more of a hassle than it should be. (Still gotta use 330 because I'm only 60 construction lol)
---
Because I used to run my mouth in a disgusting way, talking about being strangled for enjoyment, etc.
---
see everyone says skayer but it doesnt make any money until level 70. to immediatly fund yourself train something like rc or hunter.
---
Or do lava dragons or revenants
---
Is the 500k worth it if I only have 1.3 mil?
---
&gt;Just make sure you're calling what you need to on your horn every 30 seconds because its important.
---
This, I would need someone to call/tell me what the fuck I am doing depending on the role I get. I would just rather pay someone to get me through it, its a torturous hour.
---
Bro what is up with your taskbar xd
---
Had this on my Samsung note 9, but I think it was due to having no wifi and really weak service, so it just wasnt loading. Works now (and this was all post uodate)
---
Would be cool for clan chats, dunno if the whole server needs to know.
---
I just tried counting them, and got lost. I’m now in Prifddinas with a thumb up my butt
---
 I think they're unnecessary. I don't want to be notified when other people get Bandos chestplate. Maybe when they max their account or get 200m in a skill or all skills?
---
What, standing at crafting guild?
---
if you can, buy 1 month membership with credit card, its pretty strong for recovering account which means it will be harder for someone else to recover your account.
---
It’s naked
---
Foot pedal ftw
---
ok, or I got off the game last night after completing the rest of the western med and hard diaries, made my post about zulrah, now it's the next day and I'm replying to those who have answered and havent gotten back on the game to kill zulrah my 421st time. I have no problem killing him again so quit picking at issues that arent there...
---
my post has a valid question, nothing suspicious. just wondering why the kill wasnt counted yet and someone else has given a likely reason why it hasn't counted, unlike you
---
200 iq
---
Thanks for the tips, already a lot more confident!
---
I thought you quit osrs. 
---
I have an idea to share, how about you go to a different sub you fucking gnome.
---
Thanks for the help and support!
---
Weirdo
---
Nice 25 thieving pure
---
&gt; The proposed spell and barrage are pretty different though, your opponents can still move around and use items, just not attack you back for x seconds.
---
I know, but now in wildy, instead of spamming barrage against someone trying to tank to the border, you can just freeze them and then *while they're frozen*, use the 4 level lower objectively better damage dealing spell until they unfreeze.
---
A dps spell with 7% damage over ice barrage.
---
I support as long as Lumby elite is required to start it.
---
Thank you for the offer! I imagine the wiki will be enough but I'll keep you in mind C:
---
Lmao gs is in my clan chat
---
I meant, what if you had a daughter and some sick men started commenting about her like this. If that’s your only comeback, it’s pretty sad. You know these comments are inappropriate and disrespectful.  Is that girl even 18?
---
Did you send her a screenshot of your stats drained without giving her the context and she literally copied them? or is there a specific reason they are drained?
---
Nice plug
---
Also, unregistered hypercam 2 is the only option for RSMV
---
Just got my tattered after 256 and no reg drop, feelsbadman
---
He will absolutely not be able to sustain his first bond off Slayer, stop telling noobs that because it is simply not true. It's also bad XP, even with black mask (Which he cannot afford) because low level tasks are garbage. You other advice points are spot on though.
---
He is trying to say be proud but in a more quiet way but he forgets he's on a public forum and that he can just ignore the post instead of being a toxic boi
---
Did you have the gloves too? All 4 void parts?
---
That was easily the longest part of any diary I did so far. Maybe except chompy
---
I use it to AFK some slayer on my alt but it’s not exactly doing bits over a D or R Xbow.
---
Are you burning out or are you bored? 2 very different things. If its burnout, I dont think another account is your answer, its likely your problem.
---
Stick to one account and do things you enjoy rather than juggle a 3 acc grind.
---
Bro he just has a very large searchbar xD

The new armour isn't that great, but can serve some uses. the helmet is by far the best in slot magic defence, over double that of 2nd best in slot at +26. you can use that  to tank pkers extremely well since getting caught by barrages is what kills you if you don't get KO'ed. Full crystal + crystal bow is a pretty decent substitute for tbow-only zulrah, or saradomin godwars. I rate it a solid 4/10: has uses but isn't really worth it to 99% of people.

Why didnt you do teak trees they are much faster
---
-waiting for image to load-
---
'what makes them so angry?'
---
-image loads-
---
'oh..'
---
Oh ok I see what you mean now, yea that's true I hadn't thought of that.
---
It's the same exact thing.
---
I hope he takes some sort of break from rs at one point if needs to, Too much rs can lead to some major burn out
---
Find a way to make money to keep buying bonds while you work on progressing your account in various ways, like doing quests and unlocking content. Things you should unlock are teleports, and daily runs, I also did a lot of blast furnace in the beginning to maintain my bond.
---
Lol yeah he's not going to be making money killing wolves and hill giants and lesser demons
---
I don’t understand what’s happening in this video
---
Please, do tell how Jagex can 'purge all the botters immediately' lol
---
Someone else made that, wasn't gonna steal
---
I feel like i played too much and neglected other things like going to the gym or hanging out with friends/ family. Since I've taken a break I've started those again, but i still often have free time and haven't found any game i really enjoy and can play for a while. Also i never juggle accounts, my normal acc was 2k shortly after iron release, stopped iron after hc, first hc died at 1950 to DC and made another.
---
Fuck I thought I was in r/kitchenconfidential
---
Amazing stuff
---
That's not passive income
---
You are legit braindead or maybe 50 iq. Be happy this didn’t happen with your real life bank account and try to use that smol brain...
---
Foot paddles are actually banned. Pretty sure they've touched on this before.
---
I’m not sure. Like u/Rand0mguy360 said, he might have played osrs on stream before but I only ever see him in memes, I don’t watch his content.
---
Found the snowflake.
---
Although... What's grotesque about this? And did you know that word before the gargoyle boss?
---
yes, thank you.
---
To 1 tick, you hold down the 2 key and click a karambwan on the range on each game tick.
---
I haven't seen a good smackdown in a while smh. I think idiots are getting wise to not exposing themselves.
---
i mean, have you seen the boss?
---
I also got 99 at Hydra! Got a claw the same task too ahaha
---
Attention all fortnite gamers, settled needs your help.
---
Digsite is like my least favourite quest in the game. The worst thing to is with fossil island and ammonite crabs it’s basically a 100% requirement for every new pk build I make.
---
I know it’s short and easy but it’s basically run around in circles forever and if you get bad RNG digging and shit it’s so painful.
---
*hello darkness my old friend*
---
Really though I find abyss rc relaxing and it’s profitable. I just hit double cosmics it’s not too bad.
---
#just pre 12th July 2018 things
---
It does drop off task, you've just gotta keep goin at it and hope you don't go too dry. Gl on the grind dude
---
They don't have an email.
---
For real. Osrs isn’t moving away from reused sprites at all. If anything it’s increasing them.
---
3a ring is a mouldy pineapple ffs
---
Dicing bots?
---
Burnt fish?
---
Yeah honestly I've tried to camp nmz but after I got everything imbued i dont really enjoy it, and also what should I buy with my points, rn I have slay helm, superiors, Garg smasher, jad, and boss tasks
---
With that smithing level, definitely get to blast furnace. It's probably your best bet for money making early on.
---
Word, I definitely plan to start there. I just didn’t know how keen they were to take defense limited accs on leRners
---
I vote Rimmington!
---
Dignity
---
Voting no to all pvp polls until Jagex makes hardcore ironmen immune to being attacked in the wilderness. I shouldn't have to bring any gear or supplies to protect my HC status. Actually, they should just remove pvp in the wilderness from all worlds except the one bh world and the couple pvp worlds.
---
I forgot to add I have 83 slayer right now I'm thinking about just grinding it to 85
---
How do you get to the Trollheim patch
---
Tradable bond.
---
The ability to craft ava's assembler is a quest reward, as is your access to the vorkath fight.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_Slayer_II#Rewards
---
Also, Vorkath is a pretty easy boss. Galvek is much harder.
---
Is this a new quest?
---
Well I guess it isn’t a lot of gold but 50m
---
Thank you for exposing these pvp bot enabling biker boys, Buttholes.
---
A different kind of quest thats for sure lol
---
That’s like 2m OS gold
---
My favourite one 😂
---
yeah but QUESTS BAD
---
mindlessly skilling GOOD
---
"this is my zulrah KC"
---
yup
---
"my collection log has 420 registered zulrah KC"
---
"So i have Killed zulrah and should be able to complete the western hard diaries"
---
"so i can claim my western hard diary rewards?"
---
Kill zulrah
---
Edit:fuck it im doing it 
---
^^^^where ^^^^the ^^^^fuck ^^^^is ^^^^microscoft ^^^^paint
---
Cornflakes
---
Having the same problem, and I too get one more chance when my 2 factor Authenticator resets however I don’t have to wait as long as 2 days for it to reset.
---
I swapped 16m~ of rs3 gold and got 2.7m os gold
---
Nmz cc is always filled with people chatting if that’s enough for you
---
Good advice. Definitely watch some videos! I recommend Joseph's Place for that. Look him up on YT.
---
Not saying this post is, because I don't feel this person had this intent but for most other things; It's because RS3's subreddit likes the circlejerk of hating the other game more than we do.
---
Hope I get mine :(
---
Ty!
---
I appreciated it
---
It's time
---
Ty bud!
---
Ty guys &lt;3
---
How did the Demon butler get access to my secret Ranarr weed stash? 
---
Great piece Zuhaar !
---
What on earth do I pray on the last phase of grotesque guardians? I can't tell which actually helps me take less damage.
---
Still on task
---
Do you remember the chat?
---
Even less reasons to have it.
---
where do you get away with doing that, if you don't mind my asking? i smoke to calm my nerves and where I'm located, no one really gets along with that.
---
Ya ever do Wintertodt??
---
Check my other post. But i got 2 mates pking right now. Ill gear up my main if you want to come tag along. Good to get the muscle memorys and switchs down like this before tryint to 1v1 smite, dh, nh etc.
---
They do consider everyone. They consider everyone should lvl the skills required to do the content.
---
Imo they should just remove points from F2P world's, the game is still fun to do but just less rewarding
---
How to type. The OG days back in Varrock and Fally trying to trade was the best. I miss that over the GE
---
i made [both](https://imgur.com/a/stKHKxe)
---
Hoarding mentality.
---
I would never dismiss her. I would talk to her then ignorebfor a bit and repeat so she stays with me and follows me every where eventually leading back to my house.
---
I know it's worth it for Bloat, but I've never run out of room in TOB.
---
I've been watching a duck for the last 3 hours and I can confirm ducks don't moo
---
Didn’t know he was making videos again. Are they any good? Or Just rambling nonsense
---
Shoot me your credit card too! 👌🏾
---
Wrong game lmao
---
Off topic, here is what i think about the Gauntlet minigame in general. Personally i don't really like playing it. So what in my opinion it should just give players the Rigour scroll (a one time offer, removing it from CoX as well) for beating it once and never have to go back again.
---
(not that this is the reason why i think the armour seed should come from the shield btw)
---
Well it's definitely necessary for learning tob, but I imagine once you've done a good number you could do it without the extra space
---
As a uim I'd have most of those things banked if I could
---
Haha. I've done quite a bit of pvm, etc. I'm just tired of buying a good melee setup for bandos, then selling it for the best zulra setup I can  get, then doing zulra for a few hours, re-sell gear for sammy gwd tanking, etc. Just need a all in one, I guess.
---
Pfff back in my days you killed minotaurs for 5 rune essence drop
---
Good point!
---
We were making fun of your joke, like a joke in a joke.
---
how old are you now
---
There's no good uses for the Zeah book, that place has so many teleports already.
---
As a UIM you'd think you would know how much of it is bank waste.
---
“Marketplace” is the cc I am usually in. A bunch of people just looking to flip or merch, but it’s a bunch of people looking to talk while buying and selling.
---
They could be doing the pirates treasure quest. I found a group of 10 bots yesterday all doing romeo and juliet. Botting has ruined f2p for the begginer players.
---
I'm glad that everyone ignored the funny B0aty number cookie.
---
What if you just take them out at the beginning when you get to the first patch instead of taking them out of the bank before you go to the first patch?
---
It's almost a 50% increase in XP/hr, 40% if you don't count Underwater Thieving's EHP. This is consistent in other skills too like Runecrafting without runners, Fishing, Woodcutting, and Mining.
---
Photo of pc bad REEEEE
---
DONT NORMALIZE MARIHUANAJA, MY NEPHEW DIED AFTER HE INJECTED 2 OF THEM RIGHT INTO HIS CHIN!!!
---
STAY CLEAR !!!
---
I did not know that thank you!
---
Says the male feminist... you're peak "nice guy". You'd give even the most hardcore incel a run for their money.
---
ba services, 28m for torso in an hr and u just afk
---
I like just praying mage/ piety
---
If you can afford it and have other gear already
---
If you have cash spare sure but id get armor / prayers first
---
Expects randoms to pay him to steal lmao
---
Yeah man get a clan, try the forums or pm me for the clan I am in
---
Sure, but so is every other specific RDT drop for Sire. In fact, it's the most common RDT drop apart from 3k gp, so I wouldn't worry about it. It's around 1/46 to hit the RDT.
---
I want to say there's a clue that requires you to kill a Cyclops
---
lose the guardian boots
---
blessed d hide boots for range set up
---
firecape, zerker (i) and d boots for melee 
---
super combat pot and range pot
---
you dont need the brews
---
whats with the staff?
---
GOAT art style no cap
---
That's a pretty big assumption, if you buff 5 you'd have the chance of 5 big hits potentially being more dps, or if the hits are lower you'd take less damage total
---
This guy is a troll. Downvote and move on
---
Good on you, fam. Causing IRL pain isn't worth it for pixels tbh!
---
When you see someone cosplaying as a girl at the GE.
---
I do max coal and the rest on maples, the coal pretty much covers the daily 75k cost and the maple logs and birdnests are just bonus. I dunno how efficient it is but its self sustaining.
---
That's kinda what balancing is about..
---
You wouldn't happen to be going?
---
You need none of those pages
---
Wait you dont have to complete totem to get new one for ghe skotizo boss?? Nice torag body btw.
---
Bots didn’t ruin your spelling skills though...
---
Is this from farming a certain box that’ drops the clue scrolls? If so which one? I am looking into doing this.
---
Nice loot btw
---
no but try a timer on your phone or use the runelite timer
---
clues
---
must have been a hell of an adventure
---
Doing 1 kill per trip without flinching (buy bludgeon if u can) is faster than trying to get multiple kills per trip when ure flinching.
---
Yeah basically.
---
Bruh you really had to do it to em
---
These look so good, almost like they are made by a professional.
---
I use it...
---
 get a torm bracelet and an ances hat. then get sang. 
---
get an imbued heart before like any of that though
---
You close your looting bag.
---
Yeah - eclectic impling jar for medium clues and gourmet impling jar for easy.
---
medium should be more profitable in the long run, but if you go dry for rangers, it require some starting cash
---
