The most casual of the casual but I’m happy that you’re proud of your progress as hope you keep playing and discover all the good things of being a member.

---
Excuse me if this is a stupid question but how do these bounties work? Is swampletics placing the bounties himself? To me that seems like the kind of help he wouldn’t want to accept, but maybe this task is too gargantuan. 
---
And I’m assuming the items are drop traded to him?
---
I just did my buddy's fire cape the other day. Number one thing to realize is that you don't need to worry about sound, just the animation. You've got PLENTY of time.
---
H
---
so learn how to pk lmao
---
Lmao stfu nerd
---
Will there be a drop party?
---
Lmao I was there too, rot vs rev w421 east of demonic ruins? Bank loot made, I got over 30 torags helms and legs, 50 nezzys, 80 crystal seeds, hundreds of glories and restores, bout 500 chins.
---
Fuck, I stopped watching this  stream, should have kept going. At least he took it well this time haha.
---
A small one, yes.
---
How long till it starts
---
Nah, the scouting is for free and the bounty is an extra. So let's say you find a lucky imp, tell him and it just so happens that the imp you found for him has an item he needed; you get the bounty. 30M for every imp would have swampers broke in a day.
---
56 minutes
---
Shaking in your boots...
---
It being twisted tea ruins it though lol
---
Train the levels so they get higher
---
Would like to see all monsters or atleast most of them on the wiki. I'm a bit lost right now because lack of information and I don't want to go around spamming the chat with questions. Great game btw
---
For diaries it's 91 for falador diary. You can use boosts so more like 87-88

H A N K  IS  BACK
---
Nice
---
Smmhhh and finished all the reqs with 146 qp so here we are doing about 12 more quests until b gloves 🤣
---
Cheers
---
Disclaimer: coming from a mid-90s ironman who's played for a long time and still using a d scim, so probably not as hardcore as you by your plans on moving on to the whip
---

---
I would say 43 prayer for protection prayers and MM for dragon scimitar were the most important for me, as well as doing all the quests as early as possible to get the most of the free xp from them with regards to actual levels gained. Do all the diaries as early as possible as well, because the xp lamps you'll get as a reward for the early diaries can actually help you when you're a low lvl.  I got the fighter torso, but it honestly feels like it wasn't worth it. I'm only using it for slayer tasks where I don't need armour. If you plan on prayer flicking every task or afking sand crabs or something for combat levels, it's probably worth it though. In the end it will gather dust in the bank anyway. 
---
I used a google spreadsheet which shows you all available quests and achievement diaries based on your stats and your completed quests/diaries, so I tried to hammer through them as soon as I unlocked them, which I'm glad I did:
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zqpvEWYvtRSODtmdaH2RGiQbsezHBrbkSk7Zh2oyh0/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zqpvEWYvtRSODtmdaH2RGiQbsezHBrbkSk7Zh2oyh0/)
---
It's for normal accounts though, so some of the quests may not be available because you need the skilling levels required to create an item that is needed for the quest. On the bottom of the quest sheet, it shows you top 10 available quests that give you the most quest points, which is great for barrows gloves
---
Whoever the legend was that started the trend of shotgunning a beer when you get a 99... Thank you. I will never get tired of these videos
---
Congratulations on beating cancer man! I just started the fight myself.
---
Because I can't play on a screen this size.

He can't pick up dropped items.
---
You tell them that there is a lucky impling at a spot, he goes and catches it, if he gets an item there's a bounty for he gives it to you on another account that can trade.
---
What the fuck lmao

While we're at it, could we please put the nose-guard back on the female helm model? It looks weird without it.

not against targets with super big health pools and super high def
---
Im hoping my next pet is cerberus, probably my favorite pet in the game. Only at 63 slayer and 90 combat level atm so still a lot of work to go
---
Haha the slayer shirt
---
I'm going to keep 50, I could always just +1 gmaul in the future!

Would love a classing RSMV of Run the Jewels

I think you're confused by how he worded that. I believe he meant that he, Liam would rather shotgun a beer than "that sugary shit"- being twisted tea. In other words, he is saying he is more impressed that he shotgunned a twisted tea over a beer, as shotgunning tons of sugar is less satisfying than a bland beer.
---
Lmfao doesn't even censor his HP and prayer, you're getting hacked kiddo
---
Out of the box, no. It sorta depends on the Chromebook in question.  The more research you do, the better off you'll be.
---
Generally, it would require flashing Linux or running something called crouton (still Linux) so familiarity with Linux and computers in general is nearly a requirement. 
---
If you don't trust yourself to do it, it's probably not worth pursuing.
---
Couldn’t bring myself to upvote this with 73 upvotes

Started playing RS a couple years before that in high school.  I was in computer programming the first half of the day.  The dude next to me and I were number 1 and 2 in the school for progression and grade in that class so the teacher let us play RuneScape when we wanted.  Lots of fun happened in that class.
---
Also watched 9/11 on mute that year.  We thought it was a movie at first.
---
Which is only like 40m-50m or something on street for fashionscape. Which kinda makes sense, dragon would always be a fashionscape item, not a def item with barrows/bandos and ddef and spirit shields/dihn bulwarks being around.
---
thank you for this lmao
---
Ooh. I'm still learning all the new items, maybe that was it.
---
But you said you didn't buy membership lol..
---
Where do you get aesthetics from, asking for a friend
---
1.) OSRS was dying before they "revamped" it by adding updates.
---
2.) Current Blizz is hilariously out of touch with their playerbase and will ruin Classic with a brute force update at some point. It's inevitable especially after seeing how they manage literally every other game.
---
Nice boxers, dude.
---
What I enjoyed doing was finishing all f2p quests but doing Dragon Slayer last, letting rune plates and membership be my reward.
---
At what point does the boost from kandarin diaries make seers village rooftop course give more marks then canifis rooftop?
---
Jagex should just upgrade security, not ruin death mechanics. Changing death mechanics was just a way to save them money on server security. It was a band-aid to the problem.
---
Gz
---
I usually just keep scrolling. If we add a flair for fire cape we might as add one for pets, inferno, and so on. Sure this one thing annoys you, there are many formats that annoy me. But I don't complain unless they take the photo with their camera.
---
This is hilarious. Even the logos match the pill colors.
---
My original oc. Meme. You can use it
---
each round is 10 mins, ~7 mins of those are afked depending on the rng of the volcano
---
there's enough time in between actions where you can be totally afk for up to 2 mins at a time
---
Actually the flax keeper assigns them for a Flaximas special
---
Why not live in a place where you can buy it at the store? You can get a gram of high quality dabs for $10 at most places in Colorado. If you are smoking more than $20 a week here you are doing it wrong.
---
Pisces
---
I’m not gay but $11 is $11 bro
---
No. Nieve would assign tasks like fire giants, black demons, dagganoth ankous etc until you have higher slayer
---
I don't know the exact numbers, but I'm extremely confident that off task gorillas&gt;Barrows.
---
Even if your mage level for Barrows is much higher than your ranged/melee for gorillas, gorillas will be higher GP
---
Thieving
---
Your slayer task was cancer and you wiped it out with tick-perfect precision. Congrats man!
---
It was added to osbuddy and Runelite way before then.
---
Actually I think you just rush the first chest only, so that way you don't need to trial and error your way through the doors. So you won't need a lockpick at all, u/TechnoScherzo, just bring Graceful and some antipoisons and energy pots. Maybe a bit of food. 
---
Although you could also swap out some graceful for some armour. Since graceful energy regen only works when you stay still or walking but you should be running the whole time. Just try to keep your weight as low as possible still
---
Been playing normal account almost a year now. Been thinking of creating an iron man. Will I need two memberships to be able to play both account? Or can 1 membership create multiple member accounts?
---
Damn bro give us a day notice so we can actually come
---
Over 64% then
---
Why are you hostile, if you’re spending so much on weed you should be more mellow or did I trigger a ptsd attack? If you’re spending more than $10/g for weed your getting ripped off plain and simple
---
no it was not the active player base had crashed to under 20k
---
theres no point in even arguing with someone who refuses to see the point of new gear. pvp is stale, the game changes arround us and we get 0 updates because people like you get to determine whats 'fun' for us, or if we deserve to have 'fun' 
---
PvP needs new gear and updates, just like PvM gets every thursday,
---
Only if it looks just like this
---
Nothing wrong with drinking what tastes good homie
---
Im not hostile you talk shit to me i talk back. So suck mah dick
---
Graduating hs, spending the summer figuring out what the hell I was gonna do next. Around that time I stopped playing. Think it was more in the 2008 timeframe but ‘07 is definitely where I began cutting back significantly.
---
What's that?
---
Bandos has BcP Tassets and Bgs. All BiS for many things.
---
Barb assult has Fighter torso, Which is BiS str bonus (identical to bcp) aswell as the penace hats which give BiS stab accuracy. Aswell as Penace gloves which are BiS weight reduction. 
---
Pest control has Elite Void.
---
Mage arena has the Mages book, master wand, and Infinity boots, aswell as Bones to peaches.
---
I don't know why I like this so much, I just do
---
What about having alts spec bosses for you, thats sonething you could have done sure, but its also a possibilty that you dont have a spec weapon, but thats also just time locked and just speed things up.
---
I think its dumb, but there is no way he can do this alone so this is the only exception
---
How much has he recieved in donations?
---
With bad luck he could easily go hundreds of imps dry as the cbow is at like 1/160, If you expect the bounty to keep increasing aswell he'd need a stockpile of atleast 5-10b for all the imps + final big bounty
---
That is not a false equivalence.
---
Dude fuck yea 🤘
---
Ah, that's a a cool one. Good luck on the last three. Have fun!
---
This is so alpha
---
Spade is a euphemism for easy target.
---
No risk??? *sad HCIMbtw noise*
---
I disagree. PvP used to be HUGELY popular, and really still is. Look at DMM, and content creators. People like OSRS pvp. But they don't want to do it because of the skill cap, and learning curve. The fact they lose their items, where as they can have zero risk in PvM is the biggest reason there is such a big ammount of disconnect.
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
Runelite was not a thing before 2017, you're probably thinking of Konduit or Runeloader.
---
if it actually did take 6 years then the commitment would go down in history he was actively implying hunting.
---
You are the chosen one.
---
I’m just curious about the issues with turning it into a p2p pure at a later date and with the low hp it’d be dangerous.
---
I'm pretty sure p2p pures quest it too, they get the xp from range/magic/str
---
I appreciate it! There's definitely more to come, so it's encouraging knowing there's people that like this so much!
---
it's still like 6% iirc
---
I guess you're right on the zero cost. But isn't pretty much everything in this game risk free now? Apart from wildy content (which barely has any BIS items), ToB, Vorkath?
---
Are you using a television holy crap.
---
PvP gear will primarily be used for edge/honor style pking.  Theyre going to be incredibly expensive to use, and drop their charges on death.  Pkers wont be using a Vestas Longsword to kill clue hunters because they risk SO much more bringing it, and its already easy to kill said clue hunter, so why not just use a dds, or rcb? 
---
Pvp gear will be used mainly for fights where there is significant risk.  It will have very little affect on you. And honestly if your dying to pkers with shitty gear as is in the wildy. what does it matter if they get better gear? you die in either scenario and you dont get more dead if someone in pk gear kills you. 
---
I could understand if you didnt die, and this was the change that was going to make you die every time, but obviously its not the case.
---
RIP in peace
---
BiS in slot means that there aren't anything as good in that spot.  
---
Weight reduction means nothing when Graceful is in the game.
---
Elite Void isn't BiS, neither is Master Wand and Infinity Boots.
---
highly recommend oziris guide until you get the hang of things, but i wouldn’t recommend the longer grinds because you’ll likely burn out. i think at one point in the guide he’s like “go get 99 thieving” and i just. can’t be assed. 
---
aim for barrows gloves, fighter torso, d scim, climbing boots, glory, black mask, dragon defender. those will be your staples for a long time
---
try to bang out some diaries, google osrshelper
---
graceful helps a lot with early questing as well as strange fruit. it’s like a better super energy dose. 
---
idk you’ll figure shit out as you go. i tried to follow everyone’s guides but i’ve basically just been fucking around and doing my own thing for the past year. good luck
---
Lol F
---
No, he wasn't.
---
I agree, it's cool seeing people accomplish their goals, but I can honestly say I was never there. I only started rs for the first time two years ago, and with how many guides there are for absolutely everything, very few things in the game hold a serious challenge. Maybe getting your first 99 or fire Cape can be a decent challenge for some people, but these posts of completing mm1 or ds1 are what really get me.
---
Who owns the media in Runescape?
---
I don’t think it needs bis gear but maybe something between mystic and ahrims that costs 200k to repair and drops 150k on death?
---
&gt;everyone
---
Because a majority of players are PvMers and don't want to get killed more often when they're PvMing in the wild, lmao.
---
Player interaction is terrifying in this game, to be fair.
---
To expand on this, he abused some bug in game regarding Corp beast and farmed a shit ton of elysians for RWT.
---
So does Thor in the comics. Even Captain America is some older issues.
---
I think it's funny that people are so insecure with their masculinity that drinking a damn drink makes them less straight.

It is getting ddos when hyphonix is staking 2.5bill, twice in a row he got targeted

---
Ok! So where do I get the pouch itself? Glad I can "buy" it, I remember reading it was behind slayer points. What kind of defence should I be prioritizing, mage or melee/range? Can I use any rune for bank payment? Guessing mind or elemental would be optimal.
---
On a members server, btw.
---
Because normally the kind of people in those comment sections are there to congratulate the noob, and they see your comment and reee.
---
People who agree with you mostly scroll past the post I suppose

Mine has a horrific Dutch accent just like me

I find playing on mobile helps me break it up, I play on mobile when I’m at work, (when doing paperwork) at the gym, watching movies, etc - so I can grind out those AFK skills while being somewhat productive. I actually find playing RuneScape on mobile really helps break up my day of work and distract myself with the monotony of the 9-5 grind.
---
It's over there!
---
&gt;On a members server, btw.
---
That goes without saying for fletching bots, no?
---
Why do you even have strength pots in your bank period??
---
Same
---
Pvm drops are controlled by the game. PvP drops are controlled by players. 
---
Players in charge of their own drops is not good. It would be abused. 
---
People can intentionally die to others. A med-large clan could constantly start lms games and just all suicide. This is one example just off the top of my head. 
---
Take emblem farming for example? Bot farms made 500m/day and that wasn’t even BIS equipment
---
OS for life
---
Add it through microtransactions
---
Time to mix drinks and change lives.

I think you'd be better off sticking with an android tablet.  The last fire tablet I had uses a different app store and not the google play store.
---
Ftp pk bruh
---
The ones on the come up do. The popular ones don't.
---
New players don't really care about that stuff and won't notice it
---
What hentai is this from
---
Borderlands 3 baby
---
Did it pass a poll?
---
120-150 hours, depending how focused you are.
---
yes, a flare that makes it so I can hide all the posts I don't care about
---
Oh well yeah, since you get 0 slayer xp in MM2 caves, if your goal is to train slayer with mage simultaneously with whatever stats and gear you happen to have then obviously go do that. This was written for people already considering/training in MM2 caves who hadn't thought about actually collecting the pots.
---
I told a guy to trade himself cause his account was junk. Same same.
---
Pretty sure those aren't carbonated. That makes it much easier.
---
I always fill my inventory before leaving cause why not. Won't leave just because of a full inventory though.
---
If someone ddosed muts specifically perhaps, but the other people in his team didn't dc so it wasn't a world ddos
---
FUCKIN SLAYEEEEEER
---
Elite = High requirements? That says enough about you.
---
&gt; The sad truth is I'm such a filthy casual 
---
This is probably why Jagex shouldn't let players like you get to vote in pvp polls. You might take offense but it's what's best for the game. When you add up spiteful voters and casual players, pvp polls don't have a chance at passing.
---
yikes go back to ip2
---
&gt;elite void isn't BIS?
---
Hell no void is overrated as fuck, accuracy matters and similar to the graceful outfit on this subreddit people suck it's dick WAY too hard
---
But people will buy membership just to sell their members items for GP, this would be a terrible idea for their business
---
You have another post in this thread complaining that the ddosers are probably greedy, cheating, RWTers. So I guess the same reason you don't like them?
---
Falling rocks is a really good idea  we should use that more
---
what
---
But that doesnt make sense at all. Stay mad its ok
---
Rip
---
Too soon?
---
\*everyone liked that
---
Every other streamer doesn't deal with this. People who promote and bait toxicity and use it for content like hyphonix will inevitably deal with the consequences of trolls thinking they're funny or enjoying getting a reaction out of a streamer like this.
---
If someone did this to, for instance, Mr Mammal, he'd probably be frustrated, say it's shitty for someone to do that, and stop streaming for the day. It wouldn't be funny or crazy, so there would be little reason to do it again (or at all, really).
---
Hyphonix reacted in a pretty reasonable way here, but he's already known for being a crazy guy so he's in too deep unless he slowly digs himself out.
---
Wait you're Instagram? I recognize that name
---
Yeah you literally just posted that lol
---
Rendi is great, but basically all of these mechanics are very well known within the BA community, with multiple youtube videos explaining how they are done.
---
Your character also has to be named “Zelda” and you must have beaten second quest without taking any damage.
---
PVM gets botted too. Look at zulrah, green dragon, and rev bots and many others. They bring in millions daily. At the end of the day it's up to Jagex to prevent games of lms from being manipulated by players. That alone shouldn't be what's stopping from content passing.
---
Wait, what? That doesn't even begin to make sense. Why would mountain dew tear your stomach lining?!
---
ayyyy montreal represent! glad you got this shit beat :) ! Hope your friend brought you to a good poutine place man
---
Wait so why couldn't I get booted for system update, wait a week til thursday, repeat, and get 18 hours?
---
Or infinitely repeat it for however many hours I want, just one 6 hour session a week.
---
Huh, yea you're right it's 5%. Which is more than a lot of American beer! 
---
 
---
 TIL..
---
Don't buy RuneScape accounts.
---
No. I learned hard way
---
My guess would be they’re sending massive amounts of “faulty” packets to the server/s.
---
Why aren't you PKing
---
He’s actually an asshole tho
---
they will flair it as something else
---
Is there any resources for setting up a osrs private server? I want to see how bad bots really are for the economy as well as see just how quickly they can lvl an account but do not want to put it on the actual server for obvious reasons.

"untradeable str bis" isn't a thing and anyone who cares about "fighter helmet bis" doesn't actually care about wearing good gear
---
Both serp helm and nezzy, maybe theres even more but those 2 Im sure about
---
People that want it are just ass at pvm, no u.
---
You dont even explain what happened lol..you dropped your tassets. Um. Why? How did that come about?
---
hahahahaha
---
what?
---
For a noob ironman no. Youd have to have practiced waves/jad dozens of times to perfect caves mechanics. Plus bis gear and inv. Doubt you have either. 
---
But getting a couple stats to 70 and a few upgrades and youll get it no problem.

This is the video I was originally looking for

It's 2070. The world has been enslaved by a giant known as God Ash. Meanwhile whilst living in his retirement home, Swampletics just got 99 Farming.
---
Isnt 12 years old account at rs3
---
How does he promote and bait toxicity LUL
---
Yeah every time. Just choke on healers
---
Savage
---
This is a knoife
---
casually adding latency to the game? Doesn't sound like a good fix to me.
---
He deserves it anyways for scamming all.of his viewers every day
---
Above the duel arena.
---
Bis for attack bonus doesn’t mean bis. There’s a reason nobody uses a warrior ring
---
Ok but to be fair the shotguns on this sub are absolutely shit tier. I'd give this guy a solid 6.5/10
---
Have you tried using chins to agro the healers?
---
Above the duel arena
---
The same morons that don’t check their inventory before going into the only dangerous area in the game are the same ones making the “pkers are brainlets” memes then go vote no to wilderness/pvp updates because they are butt hurt that someone killed them for their cash stack
---
Rapier, claws, avernic, infernal, blade of saeldor, ballista.
---
Forgetting all those weapons that have been added that definitely impact PvP?
---
The only game community I have been with that is nice to everyone is No Man's Sky.
---
Right and therefore those people are able to also make informed and opinionated decisions on Content that affects that. That's my entire point.
---
My kc is way worse and I'm not an iron
---
these memes you make are so forced lol
---
Wouldn't it be worse because you will have less time to react to rocks falling? 🤔
---
what do you mean?
---
TRUE LULW
---
Congrats on being able to juggle and child and RuneScape.
---
Hopefully by the time you're raiding the child is walking
---
I can easily watch a youtube clip and semi-afk seers course. Thieving/RC demands constant attention and clicks, almost no downtime at all. 
---
I'll take agility over thieving/rc anyday. My agility is 78 and rc 65 and thieving 70.
---
Then just copy paste my previous response. Still applies.
---
Listen the reason you don’t see bossing videos is because whatever you plan on killing woox has done it naked with no food while finger banging your girl friend at the same time.  So Pvm is out of the question.     
---
PvP we have a ton of that and a few youtubers are doing well at that.  
---
Sparcmac does the staking
---
And then we have rendi and swampletics doing the impossible.   So idk wtf you want to see my man. It’s all out there already.  The game is like 50 years old.
---
This, my RS3 account once got hacked and was brought from 5 to 93 divination by the dude botting the shit out of it
---
Invest money into leveling, and a few diaries before upgrading gear. Things like Elite Void, burst slayer, etc. Progress your account and quest then buy gear.
---
Oh yeah I definitely agree that the items are useful, but I also think calling them BiS in the argument of "should activity X reward BiS item Y" is pretty misleading. I think it implies greater value than whats the case. 
---
I dont mind niche items coming from weird places but if you'd get true BiS items like blowpipe from a low req minigame then I'd have an issue with it if you catch my drift
---
Thanks homie
---
Shit! What are we mad about?
---
That was probably his 6th dew of the day if he's at the point of shotgunning them
---
The only way they kill classic is if they add level boosts or paid mounts. Maybe, maybe if they decide to add more patches they could fuck it up.
---
Fuck yes brother!!!
---
Nice!!
---
Read my message. I said "you were a noob then".
---
Please remove this comment, it devalues my steel mace only UIM
---
It's gone because the incentive is gone.
---
This is like wanting the ge-less falador/varrock trading. It might have worked well in the past, but it's certainly not working in 2019, because technology has evolved. Ge-less trading was dominated by bots and zybez trading boards, and it wasn't done like that in 2006/7. 2 minute gravestones worked back then, because ddosing was almost non-existent. But with all the gear you're carrying and risking at normal pvm activites, you're often risking 50-100$ worth of gear and there's clear incentive to DDOS you, if say that botnet attack is gonna cost you like 10$ total.
---
The bandits say "stand and deliver" a reference to Adam and the ants 1980's pop song

I just got the bottomless compost bucket on my tenth kill count of Hespori, and i am so glad to be able to finally complete my slightly OCD need for a totally filled farming menu.
---
I can sort of agree, but Zalcano still shits out shards, so buffing other methods of getting them wouldnt have too much of an impact
---
Damn right. I'm sitting at 63 hp and 75 def and have no issues with black Chins. Even have a 40 def and 43 pray for hunter as well.

No they couldn't became gameworlds don't use http. Cloudflare do basically an http proxy around the other way. Cloudflare will do nothing for gameservers because you can't cache the actions of a multiplayer server.

2tbps is potentially as few as 2,000 machines in the age of 1gbps home connections. Not home gamer scale, but 2k is not a huge botnet.

Veteran player who never trained construction their first time around when they were younger.  I now have the portal Nexus and the basic revitalization pool.  Cost about 4-5mil for the 11k planks I had to buy for leveling, only problem them was I either had to RC (not an issue but not preferred) or buy more ruins with the remaining cash I had and nearly go broke.  
---
My point here being that yes it's a great investment but do make sure you have the funds available for the construction journey.

tbh i had no idea they existed, but pretty funny!
---
Literally nothing is risk in this game lol, what are you complaining about, as for cost, it would cost time which should be included.
---
If it was a targeted ddos his stream would of dropped frames as well. In muts case it just looks like the servers being shit in general
---
might make a difference, i hate playing on anything but german/UK/dutch worlds, cus fuck 200+ ping.
---
It still has requirements though. You literally can't do gauntlet without grinding out those 70s. There's no squeezing by with 65 because you got lucky, there's no ganging up with your friend and using an abusable farm strat to do it on a fresh account.
---
BA and void are valid arguments to be had because it is possible to either get friends to carry you in BA or slam your head into the wall that is low level void ship as soon as you get off tutorial island. That isn't the case for gauntlet though.
---
Gem mining/amethyst anyone?...

Those drops are not unique, that's the big difference. Curved bone is free con xp, nothing wrong with that
---
Furthering your level progression is always a good thing. Id buy an occult and trident and get 75 mage.
---
Trying to get some buyables up, smithing for DS2 and herb for SotE aswell as raids eventually.
---
Getting elite void is also a very nice thing to have unlocked. Getting prayer to 74 and slowly saving up for rigour is probably the one BIG thing to do - it will have a huge impact on ypur account compared to most things.
---
If that was my acc Id aim for base 70, qpc and all hard diaries, elite void, rigour and 85+ mage before I did any major gear upgrades othr than occult, trident.

This made me laugh a lot. That's beautitism right there

noone even mentioning the fact that paul walker and vin diesel both played warcraft together back in the day and after he died vins friends list would have looked like that too :'(

It is. You can still get it from bounty but you can also just buy it for 1,250 slayer points.

People who use graceful for rc have small brains. Much better to use penance gloves/boots of lightness and some sick fashionscape for body/legs.

Stake good
---
You can position the mouse in a certain spot so that there's minimal mouse movement. You do need to move it a bit, and it's still very click intensive. But hopefully it stops you from getting RSI lol. I found this vid when I was already 85 thieving and it helped a ton, which I saw it sooner.
---
Personally I still recommend doing blackjacking as much as you can over ardy knights since the xp/hr is really shit in comparison, even if it's 'afk'. At least try and fly up some thieving levels with blackjacking before going over to knights to make life there somewhat easier

---
Thanks for playing it, made my evening haha
---
For your current stats I think you should sell your SGS and prims and instead invest in your stats. D boots works fine and sgs isnt needed these days for slayer because you can bank and tele back to any slayer task very quickly, your 83 con helps with this. Invest in 78 herblore for raids. I would say once you're 85+ in combat stats you should be ready to start learning raids. 
---
Invest in 90+ mage and range. Buy occult, ahrims, augury. Work on elite void to get raids ready. Buy a bgs once you get into raids. Work towards dragon slayer 2  so that you can buy hydras leather and upgrade your barrows gloves to ferocious gloves. Ferocious gloves give you better meele bonuses than primordials for about 8m.
---
No! Back to your room

\&gt; This post will probably get alot of downvotes 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I sincerely doubt it.
---
\&gt; Will these rewards be enough incentive for people to play LMS longterm? No, according to me. 
---
Shouldn't the primary incentive for LMS be fun and prize money?  The thing about most minigames is that 99% of people dont find them fun and thus they must be shoved down peoples throats with rewards like fighter torso, void, and the angler set so that the 1% that finds them fun can find games.  I thought the idea was that LMS wasnt like that, which is why people were so eager to play it despite it not being fairly self included.
---
It seems like if people want to enjoy a gamemode they should just enjoy it and not need there to be strong unique incentives, just simple monetary rewards and cosmetics.  I understand its not that simple (just have fun 4head), but I feel like this is a very community created problem where everything MUST give you a cookie otherwise its garbage, and theres only so much Jagex can do to accomodate that mentality without ingraining it further.
---
Though I am interested, if LMS dropped herb boxes or some similar base financial reward, would that solve your concerns or am I barking up the wrong tree?
---
\&gt; Although, I must point out that alot of new rewards were put into the [Bounty Hunter Rework](https://osrs.game/BHV2-Design). However, the PvP have been neglected for the last 2+ years and the rewards for BH might not even pass the poll. 
---
I cannot argue with the fact that pvp needs more support that isnt yet another zamorak wine spawn and kd counter.  Though Id note that you could go through some of the bh rewards (minus the gmaul and maybe the dragon stuff but that will never pass imo) and discount them in the same way youve discounted the LMS ones.
---
\&gt; Also, some of the suggested rewards for LMS were put into warding instead, but when warding failed the polls, these rewards could of been polled together with LMS. 
---
I think it will be a while before warding rewards make it into the game in other forms.
---
My main issue with your twitter is your comment about SOTE and the gauntlet - its a grandmaster quest and a dungeon, of course theyll have rewards, and good ones too (though even buffed its doubtful the blade of saeldor will see much action).  A minigame is just that - it can have powerful rewards, but it doesnt inherently have to, and in some cases (like NMZ imbues) minigames probably go too far in terms of rewards.  Especially since this gamemode (like BH) has an entirely player-decided winner, meaning that coordinated malicious poor sportmanship (bh emblem farms) is always a consideration.

Fuck I just realized

This is a good tip. The hardest part for me was maintaining the right prayers while I took the time to kill or lure the healers.

Considering that the biggest ever recorded DDoS attack was against Github last year and it was 1.3 Tbps you should probably check your facts before commenting.

 And when it comes to botnets they tend to favour cheap IoT devices with poor security because they are easily hijacked. There are no botnets that are filled with state of the art machines with 1Gbps connections..

You won't need any actual accounts. If you imagine a server only has a certain amount of room for queries, and then ram it full of them, it won't know what is real or fake and try and process them all anyway.
---
Thank bruv!
---
But then why would his stream not drop any frames or anything?
---
The way I see it, it could really go either way with it being his internet or the servers.
---
Wonder how many people used this for irl farming or tried tolol.
---
Well in Runescape land it definitely would be used people ddos others all the time.

That's honestly pretty sad lmao

Yes. Just you, you are the literal only one.

He says in the video he loses a hit in each stake this happens in. Might not sound like a lot but when there are usually only 5-8 hits per duel it really adds up in the other staker's advantage.

The world switching delay was actually ddos protection, now thats been removed world ddosing will continue.

Weird how the guy isn't using it for profit though?

This is such a pker sponsored post

Because the routing is different to the Jagex host and to the Twitch host?

\&gt; At a minimum LMS needs a ranking/Elo system and it needs to have some sort of visibility in game. 
---
I can agree with that.  Thatd probably be a good start.
---
\&gt; theres just no incentive to play lms as it stands 
---
Which one is it, is it fun as hell or do you need a super bomb ass cookie to even consider playing it?  Like Ive made this clear, I dont think Jagex should continue to entertain the notion that everything has to give something special to be worthwhile, especially when its a side minigame designed to be accessible to everyone and operate outside of the equipment meta.

So isn’t that answering your question of “when has PvP ever been the place to go for new BIS anything”?
---
&gt;pkers: pvm has no risk **(false)** therefore pvp is superior blah blah blah blah blah blah
---
/u/Optimmax never made these statements, he was asking you specifically what the risks in pvm are, which you once again did not answer. Instead you just typed false.
---
blowpipe would be fine, quest version has low def.
---
Oh nice! I hope you are doing great now and you enjoyed Montreal!
---
Osrs doesn't do that bc we don't have a customer service
---
Such a way with words. 
---
Beautiful.
---
That's the default fixed screen size, and already an option.
---
woodcutting, worst skill in the entire game to train. "Lore" wise its good.
---
Even if all musthaves were included, people would still cry when stuff like clue helper or menu entry swapper gets removed even tho it's obvious ezscape and not old school  
---
Yet people will continue to cry about stuff like the fucking lumbridge pub not being old school
---
?? He can just drop a potion before equiping it lol
---
Or a legends cape?
---
I feel this is my 12 year old soul
---
Skiller are still trying to get resources to come from the corresponding gathering skill, they don't have the mean to fight this battle.
---
Please use commas and dots wtf
---
Acceptable
---
I can see the resemblance
---
Menu entry swapper is 3 inputs with one click. It should be classified as macroing.
---
I would agree but I for the most part stopped doing gwd cause when I have time to go there no one seems to be free. That being said.... 18k damn
---
Fair enough

Some hero's also when them

well you understood it... i say did trick.
---
What did the cow say to the other cow underwater?
---
-Moooove it I’m tryna get some fucking air
---
Ok but I'm just being realistic that it is not a must have, we don't absolutely need it to make the vanilla client relevant again, it's the most insignificant feature. Imagine if I said a must have was recolouring chat text, yes it is a nice feature but it is not a MUST have
---
Wtf. I've had an offer on get for cballs at 15gp for weeks now but okay.
---
Mithril always did look a bit better
---
&gt;Jagex needs to fix their shit. It's fucking stupid how often they get fucked by ddos attacks.
---
There's nothing Jagex can do about this.
---
They can make a poll to see what the community wants (?) although as you said there are hundreads of feature so idk what they would do there
---
Join Hero PvM cc they’re  awesome
---
Protecting websites is not comparable to protecting live game servers.
---
Nowadays players wont do anything for "fun" anymore, everything has to be done efficiently, if you go slaying before firecape/bgloves/defender youll get made fun of. The time of just doing stuff for fun on this game are sadly over.
---
Also you're acting like LMS is just spewing out BIS gear by just clicking a button, all the pvpers are asking for is rewards that make it worthwhile to keep doing, nothing BIS, just stuff to solve some problems pvpers have been struggling with that wouldnt be at the cost of anyone else if implemented, rewards that tackle the issue of not having spec weapon diversity by giving dead content weapons niche uses, solutions for inventory space management for normal spellbook pvp, some QoL stuff to make getting back into fights way easier and new solutions to make people risk more in the wilderness. Problems that should be solved by jagex either way. Why not add those at the most appropriate minigame possible? 
---
If you go by manked suggestions to make the rewards 2m/hr if you place 1st EVERY single game for an hour straight, 1m/hr if you win only 50% of the games and 500k if you place in a top spot, its still less money than other pieces of content in the game while being arguably having the highest skillceiling.
---
You still need skill to win LMS consistently, someone completely new to runescape cant just walk into LMS and win every single game and get crazy money.
---
I'm not offended, but I pass most of the credentials people would like. Full quest list done, 1800+ total level. I voluntarily abstain from voting in PvP polls.
---
For me, I would consider it a must have to make the official client usable. Resizing the client to the precise size I want to use every time I open it is a big waste of time in the long run. None of these are necessities to make the client usable, it is already usable but that isn't the point of this thread.
---
bro dio is a power bottom
---
If it ever came to it I believe they would have to take advantage of the poll system.
---
Math's? 🤔
---
The vanilla client is so outdated and so behind the other clients in terms of features that it is essentially unusable. Once you go black you can't go back
---
You realise LMS will cost money to play, i.e. it has risk . And stop with the fucking shit attempts to get up me. I’m a PVMer that doesn’t pk at all, so about half your comment is fucking useless.

Let's be honest. To an at-home user, 500Gbps sounds like a lot.
---
To an IT security technician, it isn't. 
---
And CloudFlare protecting against 500Gbps is bullshit because they were taken down by 400Gbps when when of their users was ddosed fairly recently.

Still, you don’t want to be teleing out and running all the way back to DKS every time you fill up on bones. It’s just not practical for DKS, you can camp Rex for an entire task and never leave so you might as well stay there and bury bones as you fill up.

they have ddos protection this in particular is just a completely different scale for a short period.
---
That's partly the point I'm making
---
When is it worth to use divine over regular?
---
Yeah, quite randomizing teleporting, but on average it's good I guess. As for slower teleport animation, that's also true. Of course Crafting cape remains the best and Eternal glory competitive with the lyre, but as an Ironman completing Elite Fremennik is way easier to accomplish than 99 Crafting or getting lucky with charging glories.

Hahaha funny you say this I've been grinding woodcutting from 73-84 currently at sulliusceps with a dragon axe, and when I pay full attention I can get at maximum 100k/hr if lucky for like 10 mins, but then it will slowly drop down to 90 due to the one swing and the mushroom is gone rng. But when I'm doing my assignments and not paying too much attention I get about 75k xp/hr so overall I think this is the best method till 90 without tick manipulation. It's better past 90 but redwoods are too afk to pass up.
---
Yeah man, most people bridding risk over 100k, and any combat bracket outside of pures risks 100k for edge style 1v1s
---
I got one around 1200 on mine. Never gotten a tentacle tho, now I’m at close to 5500.

I wouldn't do LMS if it was less money than skilling such as red chins but i'd love to do it if it could fund 14 days membership and gear upgrades for infero even while not being as good as ToB or CoX.
---
Also raids are much easier than pking once u get a hang of them, even after like 20kc the amount of deaths goes down significantly but in PvP, skills caps are constantly growing with better pkers who've been tribridding for literally a decade

I'm stuck at lvl 73 without knowing what to do next. 6 months ago I grinded hours and hours for the void set and the graceful, also did a bunch of questing till monkey madness, but I grew tired of the grind. I want to get back into action, what do you guys recommend?

It totally could be. I don't doubt it but i was just stating it... Really dumb that people are so mad at hyphonix it doesnt matter who it is its still an issue that someone can have control over worlds, someone could ddos all the worlds and get many hcim killed... it was supposed to be fixed from 2 years ago

The left click option for bones was there a year ago and in fact came from OSBuddy, which Jagex seems to make money from. Adam, the founder of RuneLite, doesn't seem to like that swap but feels that RL should be on par with OSBuddy Pro so that players don't have to pay more to get that advantage.
---
Seriously. Atleast switch it to Epstein or something to make it a tiny bit more original and topical.
---
It cost a chunk of change to ddos a world. It wouldn't be worth it to kill a streamer doing olm. A 1.5b stake however..
---
Try doing it at 1440p.
---
Honestly #1 is ground items names. It does not even HAVE to have all the bells and whistles of colors, highlights, whitelist, timers, etc. Honestly ground items has got me the most spoiled. I "can't" do general slayer on mobile cause trying to right click every drop during a cannon task or quick task is a pain.

&gt;If you're a RuneScape player of any caliber and value rsgp in USD instead of fake internet money, you're an idiot.

&gt;Edit: Don't try to project your RWT guilt onto other people.

Doesn't even have to be in a RWT context. OSRS gp takes time to earn, and time is money. What's to hate?

sort of right I guess, it doesn't increase your chance to hit but when you do roll a 'hit' the game then rolls damage randomly from 0 to your max hit so a higher max hit means lower chance to roll a 0

Absolutely zero evidence any of that happened with Trump around or at Mar a Lago. You guys can't push the Russia hoax so you tried, briefly, to pin trump with epstein, but even the media admitted trump had nothing to do with it.

Listen here you

Thanks for the insult, clown. More often than not on a single person, xp gained is money spent. It is true money moves from player to player, but usually the players that collect fortunes already have max stats, and have no need for xp and the gold just sits in the bank and gathers in huge cash stacks.  Yes, there is still technically the same amount of gold in game, but however those people, the richest, don't use their gold nearly as much as others. Money doesn't move that much, so it isn't as meaningful to the economy in the ordinary consumer use, unless they partake in merching/swapping and that's just price manipulation that does not reflect the true value of items.  
---
 It's not so much about xp anymore for them. But for others, it still is. In the end, the items themselves are the real currency, because xp is the base of it all.
---
Of course there are things you could do to help solve this problem. You could upgrade your firewall machines to filter ping requests, icmp requests, NMAP probes. You could have IDS software to help you determine who is actually sending the requests and in what patterns so you can track it and prevent it better. Jagex could upgrade their load balancers to be more efficient. But all of that is way too expensive and complicated to do for a small problem like minor DDoSing. There is so much that you can do to help that it's very easy to get overloading when weighing the pros and cons of different methods. 
---
It's not that Jagex are failures, it's that there is only so much you can realistically do within budget to maintain this 15 year old game, even on modern equipment and layouts.
---
This changes everything.
---
Eventful evening huh?
---
Im sorry that my post hurt your feelings and i will use the term neat, nice and organized from now on.

shouldn't you be with Leo
---
Its also not even slightly interesting or impressive I don't make a reddit post whenever I take a big shit but it's often harder than getting a fire cape

Buddy if it were that easy, don't you think jagex would have done it 8 years ago? What about valve, blizzard, Bethesda, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or the government? And only 1.5tpbs? Lol

You forgot the unholy book amateur

3rd party clients had one, but yeah - there was no official in-game world map until late 2017. Just another example of the default client being so devoid of features it's nearly useless.

No problem

Don't let your jokes be shames by some random redditor sheesh, let him wallow in his own self importance
---
Weath confirmed 90% are not bots but are gold farmers at zulrah. I think you miss the point. Green drags do not have uniques. And green dragon bots/revenants are a problem. Just because parts of the game are exploited by bots and clans doesn’t mean we say fuck it add more ways to exploit the game. 
---
And if lms loot was BIS (akin to arms/bandos/raids) yes I think it would be worth it. If not then just 19 bots and 1 player to win. BUT I was only giving an example. People much shadier than me find ways to manipulate mechanics.
---
whats the click command?
---
Wow a painting that looked kinda like Bill Clinton if you squint your eyes? That's all the evidence I need to convict him of pedophilia! 
---
There's a difference between you and me. I say lock up anyone who has done anything that bad. But you only blame people that fits you politically and say that Trump has had nothing to do with it, when it just doesn't seem like that isn't true
---
That’s 17 characters tho
---
God dammit, i've seen one of these run around in wild. I didn't know they carry that stuff aswell

Im so astonished by the extent people will go for no wasted xp

Wish there was an honor system where bot killers didn’t get pked. It could really drive down the bot population

I'm 24 and like you I've been playing for about 14 years, quit after eoc and came back the same day osrs came out and made a nice void ranger before quitting again. I haven't played osrs in about 5 years, but I just started back 2 weeks ago and am working on perfecting my range tank.

It was a quote from my first reply. Nice reading skills.
---
Also, nice strawman. When did I say that playing the Duel Arena "in any capacity" made you a rat? What??? I'm telling you that if you can't find anything else to do but play the Duel Arena, you're clearly addicted to gambling because the Duel Arena is like 0.0000000001% of game content. There's literally an absolutely endless fucking number of other things to do in the game. If the only thing you can think to do is play the Duel Arena, then you're a gambling-addicted rat. I haven't touched that place in a decade and I'm fine.
---
I'm sure you'd like to play the Duel Arena, but the fact of the matter is that you can either live without it for a bit, or you can play despite the risks at hand. I doubt you're staking 1.5b like that other player anyway.

Jagex doesn't return stolen items. It's your own fault for not protecting your account.

Why do y’all try to draw a equivalence between them? Most democrats don’t give a shit about Clinton’s or even like them

Meanwhile trump is the president (so what if he had less votes) and Rs love him

It sounds like when Trump claims anything that is hilariously easy to disprove: "A lot of people are saying.... *Insert lie*"

That is much too complicated and puts the burden on Jagex to change game mechanics for the sake of players theoretically killing bots. It would be far more useful on Jagex's part to spend time on bot detection and removal.

This all sounds so bizarre. I need to take a shower

Ummmm no

If you like killing Lizardmen, yes it's worth the points

Lmaoooo his record his clean? God you’re blind as fuck huh

He’s settled with dozens of people. One of his rape claims was HIS WIFE and his lawyer literally argued “you can’t rape your spouse”

I guess his record is clean when you close your ears and screech “fake news” at everything  so carry on :)

Anyways I’m done responding, I’m sorry for even bringing it up. RuneScape is an easy escape to our toxic politics right now and the morons running the government so I want to leave it at that

This is the most insightful comment so far.
---
You're right, I was using it as an example for the sweeter side of things, not so much fruity. Although, most recipes are pretty generous with the lemon juice and triple sec, both of which give it a nice citric flavor. And citrus fruits are technically fruits, so I guess it's kinda fruity, but if you'd say that to anyone in person they'd think you've lost it.

It’s a terrible feeling, and all of us in the RS community have experienced it at some point.

Diablo has that dumb auction house thing or whatever it's called where in a singleplayer game you have to spend money to cheat. WoW has shit like paid mounts and paying to autolevel your account (same as botting OSRS basically)
---
I think OSRS shouldn't have bonds either, but I know a lot of people play this game for free because of them, so idk if removing them would be good.

free magic exp will also solve the splashing bois

This is a test comment. All of my replies to this user are not showing up when I try to expose his true identity. It seems they are somehow being filtered as spam. Perhaps because it used to be a meme that was spammed a lot on this subreddit. So now I am writing something more lengthy and avoid mentioning his real username to see if this comment is viewable by other accounts.

Did you not read my comment? That is the sole reason he was impeached but not removed from office because he didnt actually commit any high crimes. Clearly you dont understand how the system works here in america. A buh bye!!
---
I answered the question. I never said it was worth doing.
---
It will likely take a while, depends on your range level as well.
---
Why is that?
---
Oh yeah they are in HotS. Blizzard has nothing to do with CoD though and the real money AH in Diablo is gone now.  They owned up to that being a huge mistake years ago.  
---
Level boosts in WoW also aren't even close to being equal to botting in RS.  Leveling in WoW isnt remotely close to what leveling in RuneScape means.  In WoW leveling is the pre game you play before getting to play the actual game.
---
Definitely worth it imo.
---
Only 98 dry? You didnt get a drop because you were unworthy. Conplaining so soon tsk tsk tsk
---
Actually switch. There is no point in taking the hits if you can simply switch to the correct prayer.
---
It was drawn in photoshop using a wacom drawing tablet (wacom intuos 4 m).
---
How do you know which pray to switch to? &amp; is it just a flick for both?
---
Exactly, and you lose all the defence when you do switch.
---
You won't lose DPS by switching prayers, you will if you have to eat to avoid dying.
---
Of course you switch your prayers. You’ll die the majority of the time if you don’t, unless you’re just constantly combo eating and wasting all of your food. Why wouldn’t you switch prayers?
---
Imagine believing this. Yikes

My comments aint towards you guys specifically its for other niggas passing by the convo lol, can say the same thing about pvp vs pvm updates tbh
---
Since zulrah attacks super fast, how would you know which one to switch? Or do you just flick back and forth between mage and ranged?
---
Perjury (lying under oath) is literally a crime.
---
But beyond that the Clintons have been riddled with scandal for decades from financial scandals to political scandals to sex scandals. To think they aren't sketchy people is to be completely blind to the facts.
---
Are there any dedicated wildy altar worlds for training prayer, or a group perhaps that offer protection?
---
I really want to get 92-99 out of the way without getting pk'd so much..
---
Donald Trump ADMITTED to SEXUAL ASSAULT.

It's called Feng Shui, look it up.

---
Its 1/3k going even triple the droprate isnt unheard of
---
Just be glad you got some useful items. My last 100 chests on my HCIM gave me 3 torags hammers and 1 elite clue and he first step was deep wilderness
---
That is literally the reason Donald Trump is scared to talk under oath.
---
r/fashionscape
---
You start with whichever type of attack he’s going to attack with first, when you see the projectile for his first attack, click the other prayer. When you see each projectile, it’s already been calculated, so switch to the prayer for the next attack, you just alternate prayers every time zulrah makes the attacking motion or when you see the projectile coming toward you. Mage is the fireball thing, range is the green arrow-y thing, so if you see a fireball, the next one will be range, click range. If you see the green thing, click mage, because the next one will be mage.
---
I'm hunting a mutagen to see this hurts
---
88 using bpipe. I think cancel is the right call
---
Yeah nobody cares about your opinion bud
---
But next chest you'll get six items and be back on average drop rate
---
that's some real life ambition you got there
---
The little arrow above the world number will put them into an ascending or descending numerical order.

Is this what fame does to people?

Bowstrings are gonna bring in over 100m in my bank lol.
---
I played so much f2p when i was younger than when i began playing again it all felt father repetetive, p2p gives more options for training.
---
They might smell of BO but you smell of Incel my friend.

---
I'm not even arguing lol I just pointed out what someone's thicc point was
---
I get it no worries. Its just a little weird how people think of these terms and automatically assume everythings traced back to Japanese hentai/art-style
---
I dont get it

On today’s episode of Redditors who’ve bought infernal capes ....

I have 20 credible friend who say you're a rapist.
---
Sooooo the wilderness?
---
Loli is the girl, Lolicon is the person jerking to it.
---
its not a lower chance to roll a 0. you just have a larger max hit. defence doesnt reduce your chance to hit high, it just increases the chance you will hit a 0. you either roll a 0 or you roll a hit, then if hit the damage is rolled.
---
Accuracy increases the chance you will not hit a 0. it doesnt make you hit harder more often.
---
I'm about ready to hit canifis and I was having fun until I realized it was like almost 300 marks for that outfit wonk
---
Fantastic job! I love these!!!
---
strength only contributes to your max hit.
---
Accuracy only increases the chance to NOT hit a 0. it doesn't make you hit higher more often.
---
Rune pouch bottom right, not bottom left, thats the big one
---
I mean it's not a bad design by any means, but what if it didn't cover the whole face?
---
I'd rather have those 2008 hd graphics.
---
And it took 17 tries.
---
Yes I did answer it.  Clearly you cant read. Buh bye!
---
I watched this like and got a similar feeling to watching high level brids... how do you move your hands so fast and in perfect rhythm..
---
It looks absolutely dope as hell not gonna lie
---
You're super talented, I love your art style.
---
unless you just genuinely enjoy the afk theres a huge amount of things you could do that would profit over 100m in the time it takes to spin the flax so you're gonna get some shit from people on reddit
---
Yes and yes.
---
Lmao
---
Did he make a video on it ?
---
Neitiznot (or) anyone? I’d pay a mil or 2 for that bad boi lol
---
Wtf did I just watch?
---
And all that's without getting into shit like "Oppai Loli"---Which if you, the reader, are not aware: Oppai is moonspeak for "giant gazongas"
---
I've never once been hacked since 2001. I'm just suggesting to help others. Quit with the elitist shit. They already do this on rs3. They do it for more than just the bank. It makes sense and would almost entirely eliminate stealing.
---
its the same log in information for both osrs and rs3
---
Boo. 2016 called and wants it's irrelevant issue back.
---
Let's leave the political BS off of this sub, please.
---
That's actually a great suggestion on it's own, I didn't know you need it for a clue now.
---
I would turn off automatic windows updates, i think this update made it so people pcs stopped working or something
---
Honestly don’t care lol. I’m gonna spin more flax in the crafting guild way less time than Lumby, before you can get a badass afk method like this, you gotta grind the fuck out of crafting. It’s breaking my bank dude I just had 41m like a week ago. Whether you see it or not, I’m grinding. And you shouldn’t be shaming that on Reddit. Atleast I’m not botting and fucking the RS Economy up.
---
Doesn't change the fact that you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Delete this before someone suicides you!
---
😂😂😂😂💯🔥😛🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
---
Yeah, the bot zone probably
---
Haha get it because pkers kill ironmen for their spades while they innocently try do clue scrolls
---
I've literally been to prifddinas twice since completion of the quest lmao
---
45 def
---
OK? Doesn't mean it wasn't a good update
---
40 bonds
---
🙅🏿‍♂️ no  🐻 tummy 🐻 🙅🏿‍♂️ no  😛 yummy 😋
---
where would you say your face is located
---
reddit really thinks spending two weeks skilling is on par with *mastering* tribrid pking
---
never ceases to amaze me how out of touch this community is with pvp
---
Vork is like 2m an hour from my experience
---
Dragon full helm re skinned
---
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD IF YOU VOTE YES FOR THIS AMERICAN FOTBALL HELMS I WILL FUCKING HATE YOU OSRS
---
its just a fucking fotball helm
---
That's fucking sick. I'm totally gonna renew my bond for this quest.
---
I'm just going to act like he didnt lol
---
Lolita was a book first, by Nabokov, a Russian classic.
---
I am poor
---
This looks super cool, even if it is a step away from the more Norse/Viking style that influenced a lot of the Fremmenik headwear.
---
Looks kinda decent, but I hoping for something that is more osrs feel.
---
Should be the other way around, friendo.
---
They're the kind of people to accuse you of defending the Clintons for saying that you hope both Trump and Clinton go to jail.
---
I mean, it's to differentiate it from the Neitiznot helm, if Neitiznot is the med helm then this is the full helm, most armours in game follow that design.
---
Love seeing how 23 pixels can be turned into such awesome illustrations, nice work!
---
What a nice lad :) I sure will
---
Add these graphics while they’re at it
---
What is this enchanted symbol suicide method you speak of? I'm not training prayer now but would like to know for the future.
---
Lost buttterfly. :)
---
F2P sucks the big balls since a lot (possibly everything) is slower and you have close to no teleport options. Also barely any content.
---
I do hope you aren't trying to be taken seriously by anybody anytime soon.
---
Wyverns?
---
Didn't do me any good. Had to end up making an alt
---
I hope it's just a straight upgrade from the neitiz helm and doesn't use charges or degrade
---
Im killing corp and as I know from the wiki core can spawn when I hit 32 or higher. My highest hit is 31 but this little shit is spawning anyway. Why?
---
they said it's not a grandmaster quest
---
Bye... :(
---
I'm somewhere around 2.8k with no pet. 
---
I need y'all's blessings.
---
Sorry didn't see your comment before. Im 60 atk 60 str 54 def 59 range 59 mage 60 hp 44 prayer 51 slayer
---
If you're an iron man this is much more impressive
---
Using the enchanted symbol from mage arena 2 you can suicide super fast you just hold 1 and spam the symbol
---
by having only one or two world available for lms? you know, like it currently is?
---
Rs3 and osrs are different games. Most that play osrs never played the quest on rs3. Most quit after eoc.
---
The meme comes from the crab rave meme and it got adapted and improved on by this subreddit. Look up crab rave meme on YouTube and you will get an idea of what it’s about. For RuneScape most people use it when referring to some bad, unwanted, or weird part of the game. For example:
---
🦀🦀jagex is powerless against pvp clans🦀🦀
---
Or 
---
🦀🦀pvp content is decided by people who don’t use it🦀🦀
---
Any time! Let me know if you're in Prif and we'll hang.
---
to me it seemed like you took his side by repeating his arguement.
---
Learn about how curiously conservative the gaming and OSRS community is.
---
So rare omg
---
You know it
---
Shit, better go get it back then
---
Stay away from this, your life is going great atm no need to fuck it a little up. OR you could play like 15 minutes before falling asleep.
---
Depends on how they buff it. Serp is currently +2 Str over Neit and if they match that, it would be a bit problematic. But there are a lot of other ways they could upgrade Neit than just 2 Strength; after all, the Neit upgraded the Berserker without increasing the Strength at all and this does look more defensive than offensive.
---
That's no excuse to just copy &amp; paste a quest while character assassinating several characters
---
Alright thanks! Guess I’ll be leveling up my def and att to 70!
---
Wasted.
---
I was looking for a sustainable way to get smithing everywhere, thanks for this
---
Gotcha, thanks! I’ll save up for the Sara sword.
---
What’s the difference between reporting the bot in-game and opening a ticket? You don’t explain the process of your suggestion in your post. Because based on what you wrote, it doesn’t sound very different from what we already have.
---
Literally, no.  But you can RWT for it.  There was a clip on here of a streamer saying he was gonna pay 900m for someone to get him his infernal on his pure.
---
Fair enough. I haven’t even used it tbh.
---
I fkin love these at x1,75 speed, gerudo valley vibes, would love more agression on the guitar tho
---
does that mean free runecrafting xp? :)
---
Looks dope as heck! I like it!
---
Yea you’re probably right, It really depends where you’re going with the quest and where the upgrade comes from. I was just thinking about when rs3 did the enchanted version pre eoc and give it a blue ish tint I liked that one. Can’t say I like this mask but that’s just my opinion
---
The ddoser didn't have hyphonix's ip but he knows how to lag the jagex servers so he was ddosing the world servers and everytime hyphonix went into a stake everybody in the world would lag, Hyphonix later hopped to a new world to test it out and then that world got hit, after that he said he was going to play minecraft and the minecraft server got hit. Then hyphonix got fed up and left and the server went back up and the world stopped lagging
---
(that was the joke, i was saying he was rwt, that was the joke i was making, gj)
---
You can if you make an imgur album.
---
That enchant was from a summoning imbue though; it wasn’t stronger.
---
Not really. Maybe it has a bit of that in colloquial speech but almost always it's used in the typical sense.
---
Which is loli = lolicon = Lolita complex, someone who is sexually attracted to drawings of children
---
Reminds me of Zooms mask from the Flash
---
Get that slay helm and rfd gloves
---
alright, any opinion on the other stuff?
---
it's not the '20 minutes' portion. it's that you are literally locked into 20 minutes of click intensive gameplay... OR you get nothing. you can't walk away to tend to a child, or get the door, or whatever normal people have to do.
---
like come on, just make it so you can log out and retain your progress. you'd still be punished if you had seeds planted and they die.
---
&gt; Thanks for the insult, clown.
---
Is this a copypasta? I didn't read past that
---
Ok it was just confusing since he literally already made the joke about buying infernals in his post.  Good one though.
---
I like degrading items. Lets them add high tier items without too much power creep. Items like Scythe can be BIS for a lot of things, but it's expensive to use for all of those things. Degradeable items like barrows or crystal items have always been in the game.
---
Ah yes. Vladimir Nabokov. The famous... Latin... Filmmaker...?
---
I keep mine on monthly renewal but I do from time to time turn it off if I get a big drop or my cash stack builds up to a comfortable amount to get a bond.
---
It's funny, snowflakes being afraid of a rainbow
---
Serp should stay bis melee. It requires scales so there’s a cost involved in using it. This helm should still be bis hybrid/tribrid
---
Yo not sure which artist did this but please give them mad props, this helm looks great.
---
Edmond is not gonna like that...
---
looks nice
---
I catch myself doing this all the time.
---
Can you retroactively abort someone with down syndrome?
---
Questing is a piece of cake, the problem is gettings stats for said quests honestly for most people, yeah sure level 70 is only like 770k xp, but it's a pain when you have to do a skill you dislike like mining or mining.
---
Lolicon is the original term, a portmanteau meaning lolita complex, and describes the person attracted to the young girl.
---
But colloquially a 'loli' means the girl, and a lolicon would describe the one attracted to her.
---
Na

snagged a couple clips that might be useful
---
How did you get pk'd? On way to bank ?
---
Well, I had skipped F2P to members, but I kinda got lazy and didn't farm enough to keep the bonds going, then didn't play for like a year.
---
I'm wanting to make sure than when I activate the bond, I can keep it going.
---
Appreciate the insight though.
---
It's an incredibly common trope in anime, discussion surrounding it, and the general community. It may be weird in itself, but people knowing about it isn't.
---
I didn’t do it for the money or “insane do/hr”. Was the best way to train smithing with a needy newborn.
---
Nothing, low level slayer sucks. Just keep powering through it.
---
I hate those health bars looks so out of place
---
No, a good percentage of players hold no value to those graphics.
---
Also inb4 toggle: dev time would double
---
Castle wars clip, pop punk music in vid, threw me back to 07 man. All it’s missing is unregistered hypercam
---
Oh Dark Souls you continue to haunt me.
---
I think it's because it's more seen as evil and unnatural depending on religious background.
---
At the very least people against it find it unnatural as men and women were designed to get together and create more people opposed to enjoying their lives with the same sex.
---
Quite frankly I couldn't care less what others do with themselves as long as they aren't killing people without cause
---
Casinos require ID online. Unless you're doing stuff like stake.com, which should also not be a thing.
---
no, it generally isn't used in that sense, you're just wrong. people refer to basically any small girl in anime as a "loli". it's usually not porn.
---
that is the origin of lolicon, yes, but "loli" by itself just refers to a small anime girl, which isn't normally in a pornographic situation just because they're the subject of a lolicon's attraction.
---
Im 85 slayer and its slow.  Just gotta grind it will always be slow
---
At least you will never need more scales right?
---
Do yourself a favor, do fairy tail pt 1 and START fairy tale pt 2. You dont have to complete pt 2. This will unlock fiary rings making transporting to zanaris way easier.
---
Every piece of bis gear in this game will always be "buyable." if its untradable, ppl will rwt for it if they can't complete the content
---
I dont play runescape anymore, but the memes here are off the hook
---
It's free in that players have the freedom to go train rc, or the freedom to not do the quest.

How else do you make agility fun?

Slayer. Youll get good money once your slayer is 65. And the slayer mask will increase your exp rates in those stats
---
Thanks, feels weird, being 27 and wanting such a serious setup knowing that there's so many more productive things to spend money on. But damn it feels good fulfilling a childhood dream!

Don't worry bro! It looks great either way! I never ever use the tool leprechaun but looking at this makes me want it haha

I've been thinking about building all the Hard STASH units for clue scrolls but I'm broke enough so I don't think I will lmao

still waiting in line. people keep cutting
---
No one deserves that much punishment, even with the new QoL update for it.
---
It's easily the worst minigame in OSRS. Worse than trouble brewing.
---
It's only a master quest, to justify this being better than a serp it would have to be quite a bit more rare than a serp helm or it would need to degrade.
---
Leans back as far as you like, including horizontally if you like to tempt fate, cushions are quire comfy, I have slept in it accidentally before. It's quite comfortable, and quite affordable.
---
Best advise I can give you is try stuff out on your own instead of always taking advise. Advise is good but really take it with a grain of salt and do some experimenting on your own to find out what you enjoy doing most. Doing something you enjoy that is a bit slower is a lot better than doing something you dislike that's a bit faster. It's a game played for enjoyment after all.
---
Priest in Peril isn't a very difficult quest combat-wise. 39 range is more than enough, but its not like you over leveled for nothing. You'll need higher range at some point, right?
---
What the fuck lmao. Says the guy who just took all that time to write a hysterical drama piece to a random redditor, ratcheting straw men on top of straw men. I honesty skipped 90% of the blithering assumptions based on your first paragraph’s tribalistic Fox News presuppositions.
---
My time is occupied writing a policy report on redistricting methods and gerrymandering. Back to work.
---
Thanks for the great explanation
---
I actually enjoyed being able to power on my bot, go to sleep and wake up to a few levels gained or a new fire cape, so that I would still make progress seeing as all the time actually playing consisted of standing at varrock west trying to buy resources and equipment. I could use some typing practice again, let's bring it all back
---
You'd have to nick all the textures which is illegal

True. Listen alright I've never sat down and watched the whole thing AND I'm an idiot, so like...yah.

Context: UIM\_Verf's account UIM Karamja, locked to Karamja, was also looking for a rune crossbow from Lucky implings on Karamja, like Settled in Morytania.

The shading on this is actually extraordinary. You managed to use light and shadows to an amazing effect. Really like this, well done.

Interesting. I have a Herman Miller so not quite in the market, but I always wondered how cushiony it actually is.

I find them very uncomfortable. I can't manspread in them cus they have hard plastic sticking up on the sides to keep you in place during high g force left hand turns, and it's really uncomfortable to rest your legs on them. I prefer an ergonomic office chair much much more, but everyone is different. I can't deny the fact that they are popular and people say they are comfortable. Just not for me.
---
BURN DOWN KARAMJA THERES A FREE RCB THERE
---
Actually took me 1,7k for my first trident , but since its been shitting em like crazy
---
settled on suicide watch
---
I had to reset the password lol but I still use the same email so they reset it for me easy
---
My wife hates it, but she prefers chairs that force you to sit upright, the head cushion is incredible and then back cushion is well-placed. But if you care about proper posture this isn't the chair for you. I can imagine for a larger person the sloped sides would be uncomfortable.   
---
All that being said, I swear that all Scapers are autists so shouldn't we want to feel secure and tight in our chairs?
---
Evil Chicken, Tree Ents, Trolls, and Swarm random events once kept a balance in this game
---
I remember dying to his ass while trying to mine in Al  Kharid.
---
I think a regular anti dragon shield would be better because DFS has negative range. With the super antifire you should be good for his mage and it’ll up your DPS for range. Good luck that was definitely the hardest quest boss in my opinion but you’ll get it
---
&gt; Bring it back.

It's a meme. Jesus, this is why I stopped giving a shit about politics. You guys are always so angry about politics. Just chill out and enjoy yourself a bit.
---
Scooter wheels for your chair is the upgrade you're missing. And yes that's a real thing.
---
Is that a quest? okay, thanks

Drop Soccer! Being healthy, and having a good cardiovascular system pale in comparison to having 99's baby!
---
cos u can report 50 at a time when they do starter quests in mass but they will just not do it together if its introduced
---
Hmmm so I would recommend staying free to play . I also would suggest trying out the vanilla client for a couple days and then switch to runelite . It's a fun game but if you've never played it before it can be a little over whelming. And it's definitely the type of game you can put down and pick up whenever you have time
---
\&gt;I'm sorry a light puzzle took you 19 hours. 
---
Dont be.  Im fine working for things in a game based around working for things, I dont need my stats to be set to max.
---
\&gt;You can skip a mage switch at zulrah and still get sub 2 minute kills.
---
Sure, if youre using bp and not crystal garbage.
---
\&gt;That's really not really terrible. 
---
Yes, because something that is "really not really terrible" is totally in the same league as fucking tbow.  
---
\&gt; I'm not sure why this stuff gets you so worked up 
---
Me explaining to you why you have no clue what you talking about isnt me worked up.  Back to the tried and true "Im not mad, youre mad" flashcard.  Tell me, if this conversation never happened, and Jagex shipped the lms rewards as they currently stand to the game, which one of us would be mad about that?  Theeere ya go.  Im not the one who wants a change to the status quo here.
---
Anyways, idk why Im still talking to you, you kind of discredited yourself after your tbow shitpost.  Gonna hang up now.

**Griefing** refers to the act of an offending player (i.e. the griever/griefer—one who causes grief) purposely ruining other players' gaming experiences by exploiting aspects of the game in unintended ways or disrupting the community. This also includes spamming, which is reportable under [Rule 14](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Rule_14). Griefers derive enjoyment at the expense of other players.
---
The most obvious form of griefing is constant stalking and harassment of another player."

This is technically stalking me online &amp; harassment from crashing my effort into this kill.

Consider finishing all the f2p quests. It should tell you if you like the game or not.
---
Operating system?
---
Or just a couple minutes of zalcano
---
Let me explain why you're getting so much flak. Let's use your math, 771k strings divided by 28 inventory spaces is 27,535 inventories. 27,535 divided by 60 minutes in an hour which means it is going to take almost 459 hours. 100m divided by 459 hours is 217k GP profit per hour. The OSRS Wiki is saying about 625k per hour for killing green dragons. To make 100m from green dragons would take 160 hours this way. 459-160=299 hours. You're spending an extra 299 hours just to be "afk" even though you yourself said 1 inv per minute, which isn't really that great for afk.
---
you could grind another 160 hours at green drags and still have 139 hours left if you did the strings to make 100m.
---
Stick with a simple client so you aren't overwhelmed by all of the features 3rd party clients can offer. Learning the games fundamentals can be pretty difficult. The community is great, I recommend finding a clan chat that helps out newcomers. Start off with free-to-play until you're comfortable with handling more content.
---
It’s multi combat dude, you can’t “crash” someone in multi. Stop having a cry. 
---
The only people they put that rule into place with is ironman accounts.

Good luck! you should definitely have an easier time with SoTE

hey now, theres a ton of rs3 updates that are also featured in OSRS that are well executed, balanced and thematically appropriate. I'd wager with some visual tweaking and a bit of theme changes, most RS3 updates could find a home in OSRS.

I literally haven’t lol, you and your imaginary friends don’t count you fucking idiot. You don’t know where I live or where I “raped “ them versus all of trumps accusers who have
---
Republicans like him more cause he’s an obvious rapist  so why are you trying to pretend you’re against it lol 
---
Anyways it’s clear you have some form of mental damage that prevents you from understanding simple English let alone politics. Have fun working a dead end job kid
---
the mini game did that back then.  check the picture
---
I will miss seeing my characters face in chatboxes, but this does look sweet
---
Dragon dragons will be behind the seal of orichalcamalos.
---
You can only get past this by playing card games on motorcycles
---
&gt; I should mention that they've all been roleplaying a bunch of bloodthirsty soldiers the past few days
---
What?
---
Never
---
I wouldnt get membership until you play quite a bit. Theres a lot to do in F2P and you can decide once your done with it
---
This is a great list of quests to get completed to unlock additional content. Work towards getting the recommended quest list first since you already have decent f2p stats. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide
---
I mean I'd be annoyed with that guy too but you're being a whingey little prat about it.
---
I’d like this if it was dust:ball 1:1
---
Sure let’s make it even easier for the bots..
---
I know people liked soul wars, but all I remember was an AFK mess and too many bots. I think SC and FoG were better minigames
---
RNG comes around. Gratz man
---
On the Q&amp;A they were talking about adding tormented demons, so not adding things from pre-eoc is out the window.  Also I'm pretty sure we added more rs3 inspired updates rather than updates from 2008.  To your last point about FoG being dead look at castle wars, and the rewards are trash yet people still play

[Just checked mine out of curiosity](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uHrxob7)
---
You changed to your camera, that’s xo waste. 
---
Posting on here - that’s cool waste. 
---
Cmon OP!!
---
Definitely worthy to switch over to member. Not only will the amount of content you can train with expand tremendously, but also opens you up to much higher profit potential in general.
---
How do you know? Swamp boy hasn’t posted a video in like a month
---
You're 1/11 for barrows pieces. These droprate is 1/17 so yeah your above droprate.
---
Its actually pretty cheesey. Has an absurd 4(?) hit true combo
---
I mean it replaces the current BiS melee helm, so yes.
---
10/10 waifu material would bang
---
You didn’t take jad???
---
Just buy gp from gold sellers then buy bonds. You'll literally pay like 3-4$ of a month of membership
---
Spoiler tag even though the title tells you everything about the post lol
---
strange
---
I can't tell what the minimum skill requirements are for getting from the outer to the inner ring. Each activity has a (level+1)% chance of success, for that skill. For mining you'll need a pick, for firemaking you'll need a tinderbox, and for woodcutting you'll need an axe. Or, you can use agility or thieving. Level 50 is a good baseline for whatever skill/s you choose to use.
---
Combat... More is better ofc. Should wear armor with magic defense, such as dragonhide.
---
Really depends on what you're slaying. I use prims, ring of gods(I), initiate plate/legs, slayer helm, and torture.
---
95% of melee slayer is beneficial to do with prayer, otherwise range.
---
When you gamble all your points for hydra task.
---
Remember the golden rule of one action per attack. Aggro one healer per attack. Move to the side so that they line up instead of all attacking you. You don't need to rush getting the healers off of Jad unless they are literally about to fully heal him; it's much more important to keep calm and pray correctly.
---
Oh no you saw my xp!
---
Would be too expensive then. No one would pay an effective 1k per cannonball
---
the title basically spoils it anyway...
---
Good idea!
---
Green cape so he can pretended he has untrimmed str cape
---
Theyre easy af to get and u already have granite cannonballs, if its going to be stronger than they then they need to cost significantly more
---
I have two memberships
---
I thought it just looked like the helmet that Thor or Odin wear. Pretty sweet.
---
If you are ironman without bp I think crystal vow is the go to, works for me
---
The part with legal weed
---
These items would be worth more if it wasn't for the shops selling it
---
I mean for full BiS, that's a 32m dfw, 30m boots, 5m ring, and 114m crossbow. 
---
You also don't need an anguish
---
It only happens sometimes. If it seems intentional i just report and hop worlds
---
think a screenshot of Zezima would hold more weight. I used to get excited seeing him log in back in 05
---
What’s another spot where you never have to re aggro ?
---
You live and you learn
---
Well I legit wrote salve and anguish.
---
press F for serp helm
---
And I am 100% the opposite
---
I’m a completionist too but it bothers me that if you use the compost you’ll have to drop the buckets because it’s already full.
---
This made me feel warm inside. Sounds beautiful.
---
Will Freminik Exiles complete Olaf's Quest?
