Actually this is rs4.

I just used water strike and it worked fine.
---
Bingo. I am a ridiculous level to not have a firecape and this is why. Once I go through the whole thing just to fail on Jad because of nerves, I get fed up and don’t try agin for a long while. One day I just need to do two or three runs in a row and i’ll get it but I don’t have that kind of time right now.
---
There's also some just next to where you start the quest
---
i'm mad because i first i thought "is this loss" and then i remembered the original comics being about loss and is loss on purpose.
---
Burst and barrage spells are two types of spells on the ancients spellbook that you unlock after the quest desert treasure. 
---

---
These spells can hit up to 9 targets in a 3x3 area, meaning you can deal a lot of damage and get a lot of xp very quickly.
---
The requirements to burst/barrage a monster are that it is 1x1 in size, and it can be found in multicombat areas - the two most commonly bursted monsters are dust devils and nechryaels in the catacombs of kourend
---
Nah, all the boss fights  can be safe spotted with magic.

When I said expensive operation for a game, I meant the time to write. And as you know in that scenario, the longer the transaction list the longer the write times. And it’s a blocking operation, you can’t wait on the write to occur tot he chain for an item to appear in your inventory. Das all I meant.
---
You aren’t wrong, but you don’t “need” block chain for anything. It just has some great security uses, albeit at cost.

How hard was it for him on mobile versus PC? Mobile doesn't seem too much harder because of how the menus are organized. The only downside i think would be if your phone can run the app without lag.
---
When I first redownloaded OSRS I got so excited once I hit 55 magic I ran to the castle wars spectator wall to find it was empty and the alch and conversation days were over :(
---
The man went hard and fast, glad he’s getting better.
---
Not picking up chaos runes in that moss giant area? What are you even doing
---
Interesting! Thanks for sharing
---
Talk to him again?
---
How can you tell by looking at ", gn"?
---
How do you propose 2-factor is safely implemented then? If you can remove it without actually using it, then it is entirely futile. I have about a dozen accounts across multiple platforms with two factor, and have all the backup codes in multiple places. My phone could be obliterated right now and my accounts would still be totally inaccessible to everyone else but totally accessible to me.
---
I don't have the clue scroll on me, just the puzzle
---
Rargh and LinksOcarina have a neat PVP challenge playlist with different challenge modes

You should be able to just left click on him and he will give you another clue. If that doesn't work try re-logging

I just posted this else where. But that first say if membership, walking through the gates by Falador into Taverly. Those gates that had held me back for so long. Wandered over White Wolf mountain into Catherby through into Seers down to Ardougne and straight to Castle Wars. I saw it on my map for so long and dreamed of trying it. No clue if ring of dueling was a thing back then but didn’t even care. Got my ass handed to me time after time but has the time if my young life! Especially when people taught me about the items that would transform me in the loading lobbies. I thought that was so funny back then! I spent days there!
---
That's legendary lmao
---
I get what you're saying. I'm sure many people agree with you about bots. Probably the only reason you got downvotes is because this whole thing is irrelevant to this thread. Why not start your own thread about it?
---
Hahahaha brilliant
---
Its all at the ge now
---
Umm you dont know that lobsters story. He coulda grown up and gone to lobster school se he could write. Who are you to deny him that possibility?
---
That one's arguably wrong, too.
---
Mobile only with all that end gear. Has it been that long that mobile is out already ?
---
Get this cheesy reddit shit out of here
---
Same here. Worst part is you needed to either play the slots, or stand there clicking A for 8 hours to get a porygon. And batteries were expensive back then lool.
---
I never knew that back route to the farming patch existed and now I feel like an idiot for going the long way around the top of the castle.

* Can the special attack orb work in PvP? You guys made it so that it didn't because of fear of community backlash, but there's no way that the PvP orb can be 'abused' in PvP since f-key switching is faster and more consistent. 
---
* Rather than implementing some shoehorned content to address the new player run energy problem, would the team look at simply allowing run energy to regenerate considerably faster while the player is in a **pub**? I feel like the pubs are iconic to the identity of Runescape and this would give them a cool use. You could even let players sit on the stools/chairs if you were willing to put the dev time in.
---
4-5 doses per run, though I literally just started doing Barrows last night. Working on being more efficient each run.
---
Oh there's your problem
---
limit fps to 15 fps + powerbank. bonus if it has a solar panel to charge it
---
You should pretty easily get sub-50 minute runs with a BP and d'hide, even at 75 range
---
 No buffs for pures
---
Well as long as you dont hand out your passwords and emails it cant be removed. If you click every single link on twitch for someone quitting and hand them your info and authenticator codes anyway that is on you there is nothing jagex can do to help. It already is perfectly fine as is as long as you use common sense
---
F for the btw
---
I think they sample your click data randomly, not continuously. Even in csgo the machine learning anti cheat valve put in only look at something like 25 shots throughout the entire game

Are there plans for updating or adding new content to Runecrafting?
---
Perhaps merching it with Warding or adding a minigame like we had Runespan?

Currently runecrafting is one of the most boring and slow skills out there.

I'd woodcut 100 magic logs, sell for 100K, buy 100K worth of ice bursts, then go to castle wars and play a game bursting people. 
---
Then repeat lol
---
Fuck it, I'm done.  Now that I see their customer support has not improved one damn bit.
---
I'm also worried about how many warriors there will be. Going to be the most highly played class I'm sure.
---
In addition to this, it would be cool if we could have 2-3 accounts set up as single-sign in on the same login screen. I'd love to be able to pick between my main and my alt with one click.
---
Alright maybe not easy but the thingg about core changes isn't needed. What's needed is for the mods to start using their brains and tackle this before it's too late and it will be sooner or later..
---
He used to be a pker his pure is “blazer” look it up. he started with around 1b from pking. I can’t prove that he’s is mobile only but I’ve know him since a little after mobile release and have seen him get Brando’s pet and Jad pet while on mobile and screen shots don’t lie he sent them to me individually and I put them together.
---
Sweet. Thanks for the reply. I just nuked my pure today, did dragon slayer and got that 33def real quick and easy haha
---
Really showing Jagex who's boss by complaining about customer service to a QA Analyst.
---
Yeah man, druids can really make a name for themselves. Druids have tons of armour and dodge, but yes - no block or parry. They’re considered better than paladins and can definitely offtank up to BWL and main tank with gear. Warriors still out preform them, but they’re totally viable.
---
You’ll probably enjoy anything you pick, so I’d pick the class you vibe with the most. I’ve always been a multi-classer so I forced myself to pick what I know I’ll enjoy. It was between druid hunter and rogue.
---
But shes not so they can
---
Almost 26. But my body is like 80 so you'll outlive me.
---
Come back dude.

You will probably regret it

should have made it write 11$

considering you think thats how much they make , yeah.
---
As someone who enjoys watching speed runners and understands the community. It isnt too far off lol.
---
I did finally beat him, but I was trying to kill Vorkath for DS2 and I was doing fine except for two things.
---
One, When he's doing the venom attack and you're walking back and forth to prevent damage, I would take damage only when my character changed directions. Was I doing something wrong? How do I prevent all damage like I saw in the tutorials I watched?
---
Two, his range attack uses up most my food. I was using super defense potions and praying mage, but the range attack and the venom are the only two parts i ever really took damage? Are you supposed to just tank the range damage? Seemed like he used that attack pretty often to me and would do like 22 damage every time.
---
I did end up beating him by using a ruby(e) to diamond (e) switch at about 30% health. But I'm just curious how I could have done better.
---
Thanks!
---
Sup my bwanas
---
No, Jagex needs to add dragon dragons that drop dragon dragon bones that you can fletch
---
To be fair, feral cats are rarely well nourished, even in areas with lots of rodents and other prey for them.  Not that these would be feral, but still, rats everywhere doesn’t necessarily mean they’d be well fed and cared for.
---
yeah except you missed the idea completely, gambling with in game currency for in game currency when there's no established way to "cash-out" the in game currency to real cash isn't against any law or rules and is pretty common in games.

Just wear melee gear with a ranged swap for ahrim. Your magic accuracy has almost no impact on DPS at barrows.
---
I'm not saying how would it be useful, but presumably an NPC has to be using it in their everyday life for it to exist in the world.

this boss was so cool when they released it, then became uncool when the pet became the common level 90 noob pvmer in bandos  pet of choice

Stop pretending your some special snowflake and just do it regularly, problem solved. 
---
Just do slayer without getting any of your main combat to 99 and hp to 99, to help with not obtaining 99hp use a canon.
---
It's really not that special or hard to achieve. Just use a cannon on all your tasks, you dont need to plan much.
---
I just checked and i'm afraid they don't
---
Imo even though Hydras and Vorkath was added recently the most suitable option would be a new high level boss that dropped some form of bones or even bars that could be made to d tips through smithing. The only problem would be balancing the boss properly so the prices of the d darts wouldn't sink too much.
---
Ha ironmen
---
Yes. It didn't get the more advanced bots you'd get about 70-75% of the bots.
---
Framed's "Gridlocked" series or Raikesy's "1b gp starting as a level 3", both see an episode about once a week around the weekend and I follow both religiously, amazing series, would recommend them to everyone on here.

 Dude it’s 2 am in Cambridge right now. Customer support probably won’t be around for another 6-8 hours. But even then, did you get a charge on your card? Where you logged into the real rs website? Did you buy bonds by accident? Did you buy mems on the wrong account?
---
When they wake up assuming that there was some magical issue that made you pay for mems and not get it; they’ll respond right away.
---
Each click would send a minimum of two packets. For an online game it’s usually considerably more than that.  Jagex would have to store virtually every single packet sent to track the movements in a foolproof manner.
---
There are well over 100,000 players a day, but even at that level,  if your average player only was on 2 hours a day, at an average number of clicks at 1 per second (probably higher given the high number of competitive players and “rage clickers” but we will keep things rounded down), that would be 14,400 packets per player to store for a 6 hour period, with a total of 1.44 billion generated per day.
---
Given the average data contained/exchanged in a packet, that’s about 2 terabytes worth of data that Jagex would have to start collecting and then wiping each day. And remember, we rounded almost everything down. 
---
What you’re asking for bottom line is an increase in the membership price to $12 a month to do it and significantly slower response to your clicks. If you’re interested in that, suggest it to Jagex.
---
&gt;didnt know jagex worked with *PETA*

No. A large part of what made '07 fun is those rose-tinted glasses. Bots were arguably worse back then because their impact was much larger.
---
you could do it probably at base 70s if you know how to lure and flinch her, you don't take too much dmg and for just 1 kill it's not horrible
---
Ohhh haha then I’m the dude that misunderstood! What’s the plan with the account after you finish the 99s?
---
Was too! I was the first one to 60 woodcutting, using a steel axe! Don’t believe me if you want lol, stayed in seers/catherby selling yew logs until I had about 1m, then started doing other stuff, I was only rank 1 until 62 wcing, and once I started selling yew logs, people started passing me in xp
---
In theory you are correct, but multiplayer online games with trading between players are kinda grey area, because there are plenty of websites both selling and buying currency. Yeah sure Jagex isn't buying any back from you but still. A can of worms no company wants to touch.
---
this isnt how you did it though seeing as you just stole this for karma.
---
Use a couple red chins to aggro the healers, then run a few spaces to line em up so only one or two are hitting you. I did this and didnt kill any healers and turned back to jad. I threw on a rune kite for extra defense too. Always remember to only do one action between prayer flicks.

Can the position of the TOB boss healthbars be shifted down slightly, currently hovering over anything will cause the text that appears in the top left corer of the screen to cover the HP bar, making it hard to read the percentage in some cases.

If his front feet hover for a second, it's mage. Otherwise, it's range. I have like 15 kc on jad and I just tell myself that every time and it's impossible to fuck up.

You really shouldn't jump to conclusions like that.

Literal online casinos only have a "click this box to say you're over 18" on them. It's not as if people actual follow that.

It's really not 1 mistake, tanking hits is not rare at all. Also, you shouldn't be making a mistake to begin with, you have several seconds between his attacks.

No, killing a goblin is easy, so is killing Jad, Inferno is actually hard. Those are facts.

The sound thing is dumb as fuck. Just look at what Jad does with his feet. It's literally so simple. The only reason people fuck up the first few times are nerves.

Anyone got that clip by itself?

Maybe if herbs were identifiable without a label

Yes, card was charged.  Somehow, it got applied to an account with no Username, tied to my same email.  I'm guessing it was my original RS account from like 15 years ago.  I have been gone for 13 years at least.

I don't care what time it is, it's a major company and should have 24/7 support.  They just lost a customer.  Again.

You really expect me to read all that shit?

Damn it. I’ve been clickbaited again.

Bro, you live in LaLa land if you think training melee to do Galvek with budget gear is the way to go. If you’re not doing ruby bolts (e) with range gear, you’re not doing it right.

Pretty unreasonable to expect someone to screen record a two hour or whatever inferno session
---
"I'm a rambling ~~gambling~~ gaming man!"
---
Ectophial has always been a thing, and the myreque tunnel, but aside from that you're right. Dont know why your getting downvoted, Barrows teleport tabs were added much later, in this rendition of the game.
---
Guess I need to have a decent magic level to do tree gnome village. Fought the warlord and I couldn’t even do damage to him so he kept despawning.
---
Anything you do on your phone while connected to wifi or data creates metadata.
---
On private networks and mobile this isn't really a problem because who tf would monitor those.
---
However on a public unsecured wifi, you have no idea who is watching or recording metadata creation.
---
If I win I’m still not doing it right...
---
Lol? No?

U've had to resort to my reddit name to try and win a point. U got beaten by f4ghunter111

But you can sell them in game for things with an equivalent real world value (bonds). That’s the difference

Submit a ticket. They are pretty good with giving refunds honestly. I forgot to cancel my membership and they refunded my money. As long as you havent used your bank or sold stuff they will refund you probably

---
There's obviously some fuckery that can happen but it will have to take a bunch of trust on who each player includes in their group ironman. 
---
As far as banking system, imagine everyone has their own bank but they can only trade each other with maybe some security measure if that person goes completely inactive whatever that may be.
---
Not when you can do Galvek pretty easily with ~75-80 range with an average inventory/gear setup
---
No that's how long you would need to stay there to make the 15 mil back on the 10 secs a trip. Say 20 trips an hour that's 200 secs or about 3 mins. So 20 hours would be an hour saved so that's 200 hours at 20 kills an hour which is quick with a dhcb. Some real rough math
---
I dont suggest goblins for your next 99, might take a while just a tip =)

Status symbols does influence others to treat you more favorablg, can not be denied.
---
In osrs every weapon of the same material does the same amount of damage (except for the 2h but its a lot slower) so bassicly the only thing that matter is the attack speed, the scimitar is the fastest weapon so unless a weapon is specified as a weakness you should always use a scimitar until you reach weapon with special attack
---
This. Its more range bonus, less clicking.
---
Dragon b axe is not good for any training, nor is the flail.
---
Best str training you're going to get is an Abyssal Dagger &gt; Saradomin Sword &gt; Obby sword w/ berserker necklace &gt;
---
Ahh i get it now
---
If you're dedicated to the game and want to join you don't have to be 100cb since we also have pure accounts in there. You can join and overtime get those reqs. They are mainly for the clan ranking so you can join and have some people to talk to while scaping, share achievements, have people to consult about whatever and so on :)

Metas are most definitely corrupting the spirit of the game. And the triangle was what occurred in 90% of PVP back in the original. It doesnt matter what holds for everyone, the fact is that is how the game was designed. This is an old MMO with WoW kids trying to apply their shit mechanics to it.
---
And I didnt say dhide was new age, the shit people do is new age. Like exploiting and calling it skill.
---
10/10 I support this

Ya know I get the point and agree, but making the point by purposefully excluding the whole middle finger part that makes him seem less innocent is a dumb move, and very circle-jerky.

The good ole days. I remember living at willows and thinking that my 66 woodcutting was pretty badass - not amazing, but I was smug about it. Back then those hours felt like an eternity.
---
No you weren't.
---
To combat this, I made sure to do this on a Saturday when I'm feeling fresh. ALSO, doing the first 50 rounds during Friday night. So you get 12 rounds to warm up before Jad on Saturday. Try that out, it helped me because the first 62 rounds always tired me out
---

Man this takes me back. I remember when castle wars came out that was all I did for a solid month lol.
---
I love seeing these pseudo realistic textures haha
---
That blows my mind honestly. Obviously the real challenge in getting a fire cape is the anticipation that builds up during the waves - and knowing that if you misclick you have to do it all over again. But the mechanics are braindead easy. Just from watching videos on YouTube I went in pretty confident and beat Jad on my second attempt.
---
Zulrah was another story. I spent like 3 hours practicing on the unrestricted worlds just learning ONE PHASE so I could get a kill for the achievement diary. All the running and gear switching while also keeping an eye on HP and prayer is hectic af. Not to mention Zulrah’s “Jad” phase requires way faster prayer switching than actual Jad. Being able to get your items back when you die takes a lot of the pressure off, but I was still getting so fucking annoyed having to go back and get set up again.
---
It’s such good money but the focus that’s required by constantly staring at the screen and counting to 3 just sucks
---
Haha you're right, I didn't really think of that when I took the pic. But don't worry, I visited an altar shortly after and am once again in Saradomin's good graces.
---
You're not really a skiller at this point. Do 9 tasks at turael and then do your 10th task at your highest lvl slayer master you can use. Wildy is very good but will likely be slow since you won't be able to kill the monsters to efficiently and this way you can train on lower level monsters too.

This

Except the small ones. But they only drop the ring pieces and the tail I think?
---
You're missing the point here. 
---
Why are you arguing that my point is invalid without bringing an offer to the table? Literally Google uses the solution I just mentioned. Who don't ok think has researched safety the most? You or Google? Mate, either show your hands or stop defending non-existent arguments.

Click the chat box to open your keyboard and use the shortcut, I had this same problem

You gonna fishes that last brimstone ring? 😬

Devs haven't mntioned it recently AFAIK

Don't kill his dog.

How much gp you lose?
---
Looking into Pyramid Plunder here. Can you charge a Pharaoh Sceptre with noted items? If not, how do you manage your inventory in order to charge it after a couple runs? Do you keep gold seals or something?
---
Pretty much. Its the hardest puzzle in the game... pray you follow the guide perfectly
---
Any more mobile tips? This was gold.

In most countries in the EU online casinos are perfectly legal, including the UK. As with all online casinos, they can just check your location before allowing you access, which is very easy to get around by using a proxy.
---
Even IF they implemented this, which they probably wouldn't, and IF it was actually considered gambling if you can't actually cash out, which it isn't, they could just restrict access based on location.
---
Online casinos don't have to shut down become some US state has made all gambling illegal, and wouldn't affect anything like this either.
---
It's always cool to watch someone soloing Bandos while you wait for your friends to get KC.
---
Worth every minute
---
Certainly not important, but more info is fun (to me anyways)! I like your example of 2 IPs too, might help people understand how they work a bit better!
---
I’d use dhide if no pegs
---
Can bots do random events? What do you think about adding random events to tutorial island and only being able to skip them after 500+ total level?
---
They only added the cape because the community was begging for a cosmetic from the challenges. They've specifically said they do not plan on adding anything more to that minigame, whether that be more bosses, cape stats, or a max cape variant.
---
It’s 2019 GWD isn’t that full lul
---
All in good fun. I’d probably type like 15-20 wpm on mobile if i used proper speak. I fat finger everything. Also my keyboard doesnt have ‘ on the first screen and “ur” appears better than “youre” imo plus u dont have to worry about misusing your and youre.
---
I feel like even though it’s trash, a fire giant D med is always a fuck yeah moment.
---
Gotta have that bis armor
---
Correct, but I do plant redwoods and magic trees for those, as well as it gets me spirit seeds
---
This^ horror from the deep

I always stood at the flagpole ready to barricade the runner lol

It wasn't my only offense, also did a bunch of other dumb stuff that I probably got reported for lol. RIP redeyes566

thanks for this post

btw
---
on weekends it is still. I think we spent more time hopping worlds last weekend then actually killing the bosses
---
but nah. losing 5.5b in duel arena produces ironmen lmaoo :D
---
Wut
---
that's me and my clan guys when we go to boss
---
I’m mobile only and am at 1707 total level. Would be higher but I have had to cut my play time down a lot the past few weeks. I currently only have 400k in the bank though lol.
---
The real fuck yeah moment is when you cancel the fire giant task before ever starting it :D
---
I need to get 61 mining from 42. I loathe mining. Is there anything faster than iron ore at the resource area in deep wild? I don’t care if it costs me 5 million. I hate mining.
---
damn that's expensive
---
Oh man. Back in the day when I had to ask people what my combat level was because I didn't know you could find it in the attack styles tab. I was that level 20 who did absolutely nothing but talk and follow other players
---
Nice man. Yeah, I failed over 20 times; it was pretty rough and I came close to banking.
---
&gt; I want to log on and actually enjoy the game and not be trying to talk to computers 70% of the time playing..
---
maybe thats your problem right there lmao imagine talking to people in runescape get real u casual. every word you type is lost xp.
---
Basically makes the dropping easier because 1/3rd of the stuff will get smelted
---
Same. Bought me some torags hammers back in the day off doing this (not the set just the hammers)
---
Have sex with her while she does RC for you. That's the big brain way to play.

The whole account on mobile or just infernal? And did he find the account using another?
---
Man, this reminded me of the fun times of rs. We should all just take a break from grinding xp/gp, and schedule a day to play this minigame. 
---
If jagex made a new best in slot item for a castle wars reward. The mini game would by hype again.
---
wat did he even say?
---
Satisfaction mostly
---
Polls are a democratic system. Every account gets 1 vote. Just because you're high leveled, just because you're famous, just because you're got an inferno cape, none of that should make your opinion more important than anyone else's.
---
So even *if* reddit tends to be used by higher ranked players, that shouldn't make reddit the only source they use for feedback. It's too often treated as if it represents everyone.

That's how I made enough money for a whip.
---
lava runners are 7-9m/hr last i checked. in theory one runner can give you about 70k xp/hr. a bond is $7 (no matter what number you buy... weird) so we'll be a tad generous and say you can get 29 bonds for $200. at 4m each that's 116m. 116/7*70k = 1.16m rc xp in the ideal case. that comes out to 5800 xp per dollar paid, or about $12/hr for around 17 hours.
---
Frostmourne hungers.

They got 3 amulet of glories but destroyed my graceful. Wooh
---
No you are right, i just tried this, it works. It's a nice find, but I don't see the use for this? If you already have a weapon equipped with a spec bar, why purposelly switch to a non-spec bar weapon?
---
Only use I can think of is to do whip -&gt; Dharok axe hit opponent-&gt; gmaul, which actually works thorough your method.
---
Thanks mate. I knew this was a thing but could never do it. Thought I just wasn't fast enough. I was missing the last step that was I had to go off spec screen. Thought I was just a slow clicker or that I needed to lag my shit or something

And $200 would buy you what, an hour with a hooker? So 68,5k xp for $200.

Zammy cape from mage arena is free if you have 60 magic
---
Yep skillcape hoods are for capes. but the mythical cape is the main concern. The firemaking hood is intended for the skillcape the hood, So it doesn't really matter. Point being there are potential solutions that could clean this up.

5) I am poor so cheap gear

Ranarr are high tier seeds from seed packs, so they should be more common from hard contracts.

Really been thinking about giving this a game a go, I remember the older kids always playing it at the library and my mom never let me get an account and I forgot about the game until a YouTube ad yesterday. My question concerns membership v. Free play. I heard that there was a way to purchase membership with in game currency and I was wondering how realistic a goal it would be to turn a free account into a members account and sustain membership without spending money?

What are some active pvm/raids cc for australia? Im currently a member of an international cc but its almost always dead at around 6pm -10pm on weekdays australia time when im usually playing after work.
---
Im a pvmer so i do a lot of bossing like gwd and some pvp bosses.
---
Im a member of we do raids discord but same as above there are rarely any raids during my above playtimes on weekdays and their organized mentor raids times happen at around 1am australia time.
---
Im only a beginner raider with 2kc.

Wearing barrows gloves with graceful is a chad move
---
Not true, that's probably in a year or so. In 10 years we willbe playing oldschool oldschool oldschool runescape and you will be using rcb or crystal bow again
---
That fucking table slam lining up with the beat gets me every time, it's so great.
---
Each to their own I guess. Everyone just used Zybez and most of the people you traded with was bots, it wasn't this big community thing trading with each other at all like people say it was.
---
I approve the approval of this message
---
Reminds me when I started playing all those years ago, someone gave me full bronze and I thought I was the shit 😂
---
I remember back in 2006 when D spears were actually expensive, I bought one and used it in castle wars when nobody had any clue what they did. The amount of easy kills you could get was insane since nobody knew, when I tried it again in 2011 the entire tunnels was just people with spears trying to do it.
---
Being able to just go to the ge and instantly acquire whatever item you need takes a lot less time than manually acquiring the item/interacting with other players to figure out how to get it or just buying it takes a lot of the player interactions out of the game.

AHEM

My first ever barrows run I was 100 cb (Got there in F2p before I finally got members) and I ran this route. Got a Guthans Spear that sold for 6M at the time (pre GE) - probably my ultimate RS highlight apart from clan pking.
---
I was so happy when I returned to OSRS and saw there was a barrows tab. Then completely bummed out when I looked up barrows set prices on GE.
---
I finally hit level 50 I'm halfway to maxing!!!!! 
---
"Oh you poor poor soul"

Thank you :-)

Thank you! That’s what I was thinking but wanted to be sure. No need to spend money if I didn’t need to

D’hide boots. you are ranging 90% of the time

Chat bots etc but actual people for the most part in the days before ge prers3 anyways. Maybe not in osrs prege. At least there's ironman now (ironman btw)

Lmao sex hahaha thats naughty bro

i assume you just keep it in the main chamber

Make sure you bring the full guthans switch to heal up on olm hand too

How did I ever manage to get lost in such a small area?

Noob here: why wouldn't you want it trimmed? Reading the wiki the only difference I can find is the prayer bonus, but I have no idea how that could be a bad thing. Thanks

My first defender was 4 hours rune-dragon but for some reason I decided to stay there for longer and ended up with 13 ddefenders so now anytime I go to wildly i bring one for the lols

I'm 1500 dry of a claw myself, with almost all of those kills when it was worth twice what it is now. Shit sucks.
---
Worth remembering that most drops are half as rare as their drop rate implies since you get 2 rolls, but only one roll at uniques. And if you get an RDT drop, you actually get 2 rolls on the table
---
Damn your stats are balanced lol. I have a lower total and 50m more experience
---
I just reckon they need to make it a *lot* more expensive to use.
---
Let it be BIS for most range content, but make it real fucking obvious that you are burning money by using it.
---
Then it becomes a matter of whether its actually worth using it for all but the highest tier content.
---
It's really quite different, so that's a weird statement to make.  
---
Also F2P teleblock failed a poll but that didn't stop them.
---
Haha yea I did the same, then sold my stuff to the general store or to the chain body shop.

My brother and I did this to find our POH development. Spent hours in that swamp making probably 20k per 100 tar.

---
The trimmed and untrimmed variants of capes look slightly different from one another.
---
Some people prefer the look of the untrimmed versions, whereas some people use it to flex the fact that they got a particular 99 skill first.
---
Untrimmed slayer capes for instance are pretty mad.
---
You leave it by where the mole spawns so after you kill it while running back to the spawn the cannon should already be dealing some damage to the mole.
---
Accounts that have high hp are able to do solo wintertodt easier than those with less hp. If your remove percentage damage then it makes it a lot easier.
---
And to extend on that, you offer no solutions, nor does he. You're a lazy turd and maybe you should take a break to develope your brain to a spot where you are capable of making a single point.

If you do that you’re just gonna end up double clicking the item you want to alch too quick and making it stuck
---
Here's how they're similar: You pay money. You get benefits over players that don't pay. You can train your skills fasters. You progress the game faster. You participate in different content that is more lucrative. Both have at least some aspects that are RNG based, being locked behind a paywall.
---
You're saying they're different because one is actually playing the game, but isn't TH part of the game? Isn't that fun and enjoyable gameplay for some people? There's entire games based on literally nothing but stuff like that in slot machines, prize wheels or other RNG games. 
---
You might not find that gameplay enjoyable, but it is gameplay. Just like killing a boss and getting an RNG roll on a drop table.
---
Now, killing a boss takes skill, clicking a chest doesn't. But if there was something like a skill-testing question, if it DID require skill, would that then not be the same RNG/P2W/Lootbox, whatever word you want to use as a bosses drop table?

You pay, and then you can win. That is literally what "Pay to win" means. It's right there in the name. If you're just going to get angry and just ignore any actual conversation, that's perfectly fine too :p Have a good one lol.
---
That’s what I meant
---
Yeah, any game that isn't f2p but has a f2p component (such as a demo or trial) is P2W! Agreed!
---
False, Sally. Checkmate sir
---
You set up a barrier and move behind it. Works every time.
---
I’ll am going to say is GOD MOVE because my best friend and my girlfriend who was my other best friend cheated on me. So just think about that justice got served.
---
Hope you find a person who’s worth your time and money!
---
Lol you are retarded for thinking that way lmao.. I can tell you did not play the game back in the days and is one of the new players lol. Do you actually know how many hours casual players spend at varrock west bank and G.E or do you have autism? If you do I'm sorry but you need to get another perspective
---
Gods I was strong
---
Nice dick
---
Not entirely sure why you’re getting downvoted so I’m going to hop on this sinking ship.
---
He’s right as far as I can tell, jagex can very quickly ban swathes of new low level bots daily, but for some reason the higher level ones tend to slip though (my guess is that brand new accounts with only some xp in a handful of skills are more obvious and easier to autoban than skillers that could potentially be legitimate)
---
For example, PP bots are crazy, some are 80m thieving+ and you see them with similar stats, some zulrah bots too, we have rune ore bots topping the highscores, etc.
---
So yes, I think the higher level ones are harder to ban purely because if they are legitimate accounts, more is lost than a low level cutting willows. But even if jagex bans low level accounts the same day, sone things like emblem farmers are still totally breaking the game and need addressing.
---
22 times? How? I'm curious did you misclick prayer every time?
---
The last thing you said worked
---
Oh boy
---
We will never get that feeling again. It will always remain a distant memory

Just because you can, doesn't mean you should

Are tourney worlds open, if so how do you get into them?

yeah no avas either haha
---
99 HP and only Ardy Cloak 1 😬
---
I never said you should. "aviansies can't be meleed"
---
Yeah, I would vote for it! But they should make it so it doesn't become dead content. So some good rewards should be added to the minigame.
---
Idk what half that gear is. And what's tsotd?
---
I didn't know cause by the time I finally started to understand what I was doing in Gielnor, G.e was added.. Sad story tho

Not really needed imo, 2 handed crush weapons work everywhere. At cerb you just switch to rapier during ghosts.
---
A buddy and I literally loved playing it so much. We were so broke though but we were saving up for a g maul. We both after months saved up enough for ONE g maul and the matching red and blue pirate outfits. We would switch off each game specing people out with it.

It was just infuriating that your only options to get items you need were either wait for someone to post a decent offer on zybez or to trade a bot that was probably just straight up autospammer how much it rips you off by spamming stuff like "Selling sharks 1200ea / buying sharks 800 ea"

Small steps buddy. NOW MAX

Wow, you just made 10 year old me look like a straight dumbass. I banked the flax and about every 1,000 i would go to lumbridge and spin it there. You ruined my morning
---
Even when you do find yourself with time on your hands and want to do something completely inefficient for fun, those activities are so much less populated and aren’t really the same, because everyone playing has changed. It pushes you further into just playing for the fun of progressing your account.
---
Well you are lucky you can say yours is $11, mines $13.49

I remember being a mid level with my new d long at castle wars. One time I used my spec and hit a 10 on someone over lvl 100 and I was so proud I went on to the forums to post about it. Those were the days...

It sure was totally worth it

Honestly if you want to get membership for free that's almost all you will be doing, rather than exploring and finding the fun content, you will be grinding out money. Buy the membership and have fun instead

Because Grotesque guardians and Sire have unskippable phases where all they do for 10-15 seconds is standing still.

I main a zerker. (99 slayer btw) I ToB and CoX  etc just as good or better than most. Gwd etc is ez.

You can do it much lower than that. My first attempt I got about 75% of the kill with Torag's+bgs, tele'd out, restocked and came back to finish. 70-80's melee.
---
This is the third time I've seen this post today.
---
&gt;When will Wintertodt be looked at? 
---
Never, so stop asking. They are clearly aware of this and think it's fine, it's been asked 1000000 times and todt has been out for years.
---
So I only have the Barbarian Assault requirement left for the Kandarin Elite diaries, is there a way to find a good Barbarian assault team? I really don’t want to spend like 30 hours getting this last requirement because of random people.

Dang nice 30 dragon bones!
---
Osrs was made literally for nostalgia. They werent even going to update at the start, which now I regret voting for updates.
---
And letting the majority dictate things is the worst thing to do in a lot of cases. That is literally why exploiting is ok to do now, because they are scared too many people will leave. Integrity should never be in the hands of dumb fuck people. The truth is people would play anyway.
---
Fuck i used to love capturing the flag. I was like 80cb with my dragon platelegs and rune plate sneaking underground with everyone protecting me from behind. Also clan wars was the shit back then. Good times.

Wouldn't a single client that is whitelisted to stop scripts?
---
Okay wait, I don’t understand why everyone goes the stamina/prayer route. I’ve done it twice at around level 65 defense with mid tier armour and tanking was totally fine. I think I rarely used prayer at all.
---
we did! (im the guy lol) i’m hoping to take her through the stronghold of security next
---
You should go to a doctor and get your Parkinson’s checked out.
---
what
---
Nice to hear your opinion stated as a fact
---
You need at least 72 construction to build one that restores prayer, which is around twice the price of blowpipe
---
someone who's not Roxuls_Card is shadowbanned

It’s pretty obvious it’s an opinion
---
Finally more and more people are talking about this. I hate how often this topic is looked down upon and swept under the rug. I'm not rly all about the minigame stuff, but holy fuck I want more bosses like GWD so badly.
---
They have bots that can do zulrah, I doubt random events bother them.

Yes jagex. Just redo the engine 4Head
---
Only way to overcome that is to go do it! I believe in u
---
Pig-lets-
---
I needed that
---
I don't get it please explain.
---
No one tell him
---
Do remind me why does pvm for spider eggs need to be dangerous again? For me personally, unless it was 2x or more red spider eggs an hour than tower of life, i’d go there once naked to unlock the music and forget it.
---
High rollers only, hense why you didnt know
---
I made my first mil botting back in the day. I think had it just fish in Draynor. Man I was young and so dumb. I don’t even remember that account name anymore
---
The cosmic rune altar....
---
Bob lookin like a snack 💋
---
&gt;  Do they require those stats (esp agility) 
---
50 agility steep? Lmfao how are you ever getting 99 mining/wc if you already think 50 agility is steep...
---
Learning the rotations &gt; levels &gt; gear upgrades
---
Make spamming a mutable offense again?
---
I'm sure someone at jagex could look at the code these bots use and find away to detect and ban them in a day or so.
---
I wasn’t SpiderMan I was ManSpider!
---
I had this happen to me the other week when I made a new f2p character.
---
Gave me 100k and then offered me 2m for my instagram or snapchat, the thirst is real.
---
because that's not what i was talking about from the start but people like to move the goal posts :). i started the comment chain, go back and look weasel
---
Every time, especially when I’m slightly not paying attention and click away at the last second to take partial damage
---
Würg mich, Mama
---
Lol happened to me when I recently created a new account
---
I did.
---
Used a oneplus 3t. Idk why it gets so hot :(
---
I hope so. Been quite dry lately
---
So many hours in Stealing Creation..
---
Same, except I didn't spin it.
---
Playtime sits just shy of 10k hours, fair amount of that was bankstanding over the years, not going to lie. It's just when I only have 2-3 hours max a day (and almost no time on weekends), it's hard to justify goofing off when I could be progressing.
---
Lol what?
---
&gt;or making trash RSMVs with Windows movie maker.
---
Suddenly "Dreamscape" - LCD Soundsystem starts playing in my head
---
Sort of un related but is there any benefit to unlocking the 500 point unlock from a slayer master other than speeding up the task?
---
Isn’t the drop rate like 1/2k? Unlucky dude.
---
I went from 1b to 3b though on mobile from merching and occationally revs :p
---
You're in a good mood
---
Is there any benefit to unlocking the 500 point grotesque guardians unlock from a slayer master other than speeding up the task? I don’t understand what the point of it being a 500 point unlock is
---
Could it be changed so that when an account is getting "recovered" if gives us an in-game chat notification/Email so we can have a heads up that something fishy is going on?
---
well, according to you comparing an esport to an esport in a conversation about esports is apples to oranges so there's that.
---
The farming guild update brought a new herb patch and a instanced boss, he just worded it weird.
---
Keanu Steve
---
He has a trimmed cape.

Cooking and fletching
---
spun like 10k flax to get my first whip took me ages of going to the library which was like 2 miles from home, just to login for an hour( hour long pass) and get like 400 flax spun.
---
Hahaha, I told my parents it was a "history game" that my teacher recommended to us if we were interested in learning more about knights and stuff. I'm sure they knew but they ultimately won because I agreed to do a ton of chores to pay that pricy $5 every month
---
As some one who failed vorkath 4 times trying to do DS2 yesterday this is real
---
Nah he is a dumbfuck brother they're top page of runescape on  twitch they gain nothing from your reddit post
---
runelite makes a screenshot when you claim from your kingdom.
---
based on the screenshot date you can calculated it.
---
Honestly they just need to hire more engine devs. It gets very irritating each time I hear Mod Ash saying “Engine work” or even other devs because it’s so bs. We are so limited on what we can have in game due the engine being outdated.. Plus we pay $11 also even purchase Merch when available, Jagex makes a lot of fucking money. It wouldn’t hurt to hire devs that will actually get shit done.
---
He put in 90M in the first window and didn’t change the amount. So no red flashing or something
---
Wait how do we know you guys confirming this is fine isn't part of the scam?
---
I loved the massive battles and both sides trying to take down the boss on the enemy team. was really fun. even without summoning im sure they could come up with some decent rewards.
---
This is not it
---
[deleted]
---
No. The problem is entry. You don't see runners around because people demand max tick efficiency to be experienced or they simply too bad. But honestly it's easier to get more people if it's paid per inventory rather than per hour. Yes the xp rates are going to go down. But does it matter if you can do it whenever rather than having set players online? You don't see many people buying runners due to nobody online at times.
---
I honestly think the old way of the nature altar or air altar was good. It allows for everyone to win and is a much simpler way of doing things.
---
lol thought i was the only one..100% never met those wizard back in the day
---
Sounds perfect to me. Raids within the realms of death, trying to steal a bit of it’s stuff, sounds damn epic.
---
IDK lol
---
Yup. When mobile came out, I started back playing but had to make a new account. I ruined it for myself by following the "super efficient quest order" guides and getting all 60 combat stats in only a couple days. As a kid, I remember being so excited when I finally hit 60 attack and could use dragon. It took forever because I decided to train on chaos druids in edgeville so I could get herbs along the way...
---
I didn't do much castle wars but I wasted so much time as a kid. I have a 16 year old account with over 3000 hours play time and an embarrassingly low total level to show for it. Pretty sure I only have one lvl 99 on that account
---
You are literally advertising for them. You are part of the problem. Full stop.
---
But sweetie it's only declining now... I would give OSRS max 2 more years before the game starts "dying". OSRS is ran by old players who played the game ages ago and there's almost none new players coming in.
---
Yeah blowpipe has broke the meta ever since release. At this rate the only way to stop people from using blowpipe is to artificially inflate bosses range defense like they did with bosses they don't want to to mage. Gotta add +999 range defense and only then can you have a chance of people considering the prospect of shoving that blowpipe up their ass and grabbing something else.
---
Done this alot. Worst one was when I equipped a steel arrow by mistake after rock caking, realised after a while when my guy wasnt attacking
---
Scrap DMM and make this the new seasonal tournament
---
How is this advertising? You’re using that word but I don’t think you know what it means
---
1/1k
---
Add me!
---
90 range they probably did backpack quest which gives u some prayer. I believe people would get 22 prayer to flick hp on and off to negate healing.
---
=p
---
Any good examples of RSMVs, I’ve never ever seen one
---
I dont care about your opinion man, i didnt ask. Try to answer to OP, not me
---
A friend got it for me long ago
---
Lol...It’s a fucking mmo jagex. Stop making single player content ffs
---
'i prefer Sire'
---
-'sire sucks'
---
And im the dick
---
I just banked it and sold it??? How much money was I losing not spinning it? Back in 2008-2009 I mean
---
Guy in the gif is not in void. Literally unwatchable.
---
So pull out a ranged weapon? His point was "dont use mage against dhide", not "only use melee against dhide".
---
half a million is only five hundred thousand and describing it as half a million makes it seem much larger.   
---
if you said " settled new video will hit 500k views" it would seem much more tame. lmk when he breaks 1m views.
---
In Nightmare Zone if you Overload and use Rock Cakes to get 1hp, you take less damage to your absorbtion HP. Flicking the Rapid Heal prayer every minute or so prevents your HP from regenerating.
---
It increases the slayer xp/hr by double...
---
They have done this at previous Insomnia Festivals, I think it was AOC that handed them out.
---
Oh now it makes the sense thanks
---
I remember hours of me and the boys being down the tunnels trying to kill any high levels with the collapsing walls.
---
it doesn't say mortania Slayer doorway, does it?
---
the problem is the task name for it and the tp location has different names. not whether it's accurate
---
jokes on you, there's no gold in varrock east mine
---
Bots work off injection or reflecting. Scripts can work no matter the client. Having one client would not stop bots
---
Wrong thread but yeah just what you said. EVScape is kinda meh
---
There was an old skill back in the day called fun, a lot of people would level it in different ways and at their own pace, but often would not be contributing to much of anything else. 
---
It seems most games and players forget about that skill, or I have trouble finding it as an adult.
---
Those were originally supposed to be player owned houses. Jamflex quickly realized there were far too many players to not have an instance for each house, and so they became the party room in rs2
---
Nah, they'll just script a bot
---
Hey jagex if you see this he bots on world 495 
---
please bann!! You can come check his script it looks privately made and then bann based off that? please ! Ty!
---
You obviously missed the point of this post
---
That’s the no.1 scam.
---
Didn't walk by Falador west bank. Probably why it took you so long :/
---
As soon as I logged back in the guy was gone. Didn’t think it was a scam so it did not really pop up in my mind to remember his name. Afterwards I can succesfully say I’m stupid lol.
---
Shut up iron nerd
---
That's pretty accurate. I've only ever gotten like 4 kills.
---
These are the questions we need to be asking.
---
i need help i have acces to the first email adres on that email i received a message from jagex that my accounts email is changed to [as\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*90@outlook.com](mailto:astalavista90@outlook.com)
---
what can i do now?
---
Isn’t that that memes in a nutshell?
---
That was back when it wasn't totally filled with max combat pvp pros. I was lvl 85 and had a blast XD
---
Hope you get smited
---
Depends how many upvotes your support ticket gets
---
Yeah that doesn’t make up for how much weaker it is tbh. I would get whip and fury like the other guy said. Plus dboots and b ring
---
Yeah, im assuming i missed something painfully obvious?
---
On the weekend it's packed, can't find a world and when you do high level PVMers in full justicar crash you with no hesitation.
---
you’re not going to get your items back but i really hope jmods look into this, i can’t think of any possible way that this could have happened
---
And you can only access the death rune altar by doing the entire MEP2 puzzle
---
yeah that would be actually decent content
---
What a good laugh this gave me, hahaha
---
Remove non bis skills, it's time.
---
You don't
---
Yeah and I wish zeah runecrafting wasn't a thing but sometimes we have to accept changes that are for the greater good. People genuinely enjoy the tablets.
---
So assuming you are correct in your story, it would seem they knew your username and password, baited you into getting your expensive items out of your bank (to bypass your bank pin), they then DDOS'd you, logged into your account and took your items.
---
Please oh please, look at the house on the hill! 
---
When doing bird house runs, it is incredibly annoying to clip through the threshold when running to the magic mushtree. 
---
Thank you!!
---
Lol
---
Might aswell get rid of all the ranged weapons excluding BP too ..
---
Oh wow.. But I got 2FA enabled. They got acces aswell to that you’re saying?
---
If i didn't feel like doing a task on 220 GGs I wouldn't want to do 110 either, especially when doing regular gargoyles or skipping/blocking is much faster.
---
__*The greater good*__
---
This is some petty shit to get annoyed about
---
It has a PG rating
---
if it sounds too good to be true then it's too good to be true. sry for the loss m8.
---
Someone said they probably phished me, and used a DDOS to surpass my Bank pin.. I’m amazed at what people will do for pixels... damn
---
agreed
---
I’m just bored watching my niece. Lol
---
Learned my lesson for today. Big F for the Lance.
---
So you were eating a rock cake every minute/flicking prayer for an hour without noticing?
---
Pretty sure you log out after 5 minutes of not attacking back. 20 minutes of auto retaliate and 5 minutes of your character stop attacking before you're logged off.
---
I like the wall art.
---
Not sure if you can do this on all Android pie phones but on my Galaxy s8 I can dual window RuneScape, so I can have YouTube and texting on the top half of the screen while I do mlm or infernal eels on the bottom half. There's a setting in developer settings to enable multi window on all apps.

Hey iam your friend can i have split pls?

Good ol’ days. The nostalgia of picking flax for hours upon hours deep into the night until sunrise amongst the chinese bots. My my.
---
I just got my first niece, she's an angel
---
These are just legit players boosting economy, nothing wrong. Also vote no to pvp polls and downvote anything pvp related. Hillary 2020.
---
Yeah, meet me at fountain of rune :)
---
"This is how I tried to find Lucien from the Temple of Ikov quest back in the day"
---
Still no proof
---
Agreed
---
She’s technically not my niece but she doesn’t have a gay uncle so I stepped in.
---
Thank you for volunteering to be a gold sink, the community is grateful
---
Good hope you don’t get one after acting like a fucking child lmao
---
Stolen artwork, and admitting to autoclicking.
---
Quality reddit post.
---
This was meant to be directly aimed at you.
---
Blood doesn't matter, as long as you're good to her
---
Thanks, I hate it and I'm jealous
---
Me too. Didn't know about teleporting around until like 65 mage
---
Quitmybullshit :)
---
I’d throw a few on there
---
I taught her how to say “peanut butter” in Spanish.
---
Thank you for your service
---
who was waiting for this lmao
---
incompetent pure
---
Fucking for real. Fuck all these annoying garbage twats
---
You mean a sip and puff mouse FYI.
---
Also, buying accessibility mouses designed for the disabled seems.... a bit desperate.
---
Make Soul Wars great again!!!
---
Yeah u should quit, since you sound like a little pussy bitch
---
idk bro a few minutes of work for a $50-60 item seems worth it. even if it took you 3 hours and you did it three times a day that $150 a day which is like $750 a 5 day week. that's a decent income lol
---
no jagex crown on the man, 0\\10
---
When that sub is linked I always forget it's not an nlss sub.
---
Congrats on the progress! Questing is an amazing way to keep setting goals for your levels. Also remember if you're stuck between quests or want some more perks, take some time away and do some more achievement diaries!
---
Good luck with the future goals, you'll be so happy when you join the QPC gang! :D
---
Never stop pumping!
---
Took me 8hours with randoms, its not that bad, worst case you get few ppl in addy/mith armor and 40hp and healer has to focus them
---
I spent 600 upgrading my graphics card and all i have done since is played runescape
---
I just don’t really care that much about waiting 3 seconds to make a birdhouse while I watch shit hahah
---
You know the one in the yellow mask is a freak in the sheets
---
What did you do outside of quests? I don't even know what the most efficient route is these days. I think you can only quest to like 50.
---
god old british humor. I really enjoyed animal magnetism, The dialoge was hilarious. And it is probabilly one of the most rushed quest :/
---
me and the what?
---
Get a stylus. Changed my life, for OSRS and general phone usage. Can even be a pen with one of those stylus nubs at the end.
---
1 def pure HCIM under 60 combat with kbd pet would b nice
---
Most definitely! If you're purely training strength, NMZ with full Obby, Obby sword and berserker necklace is great.
---
Though for OP's situation, since they wanna train strength through Slayer, Full Obby is only good on monsters with low defense and wouldn't be worth
---
With a full set of armour for reduced run energy
---
Wtff, over 5k hours and hundreds of them in wiki and i only now find out about rabbit foot neck
---
Whu did they remove unskulling? Seems not necessary at all, now people are supposed to wait it out?
---
Ya this bot pays too you know.
---
Quality content
---
Dredge: 1
---
Clue: 0
---
Buying dragon long swords and DDS’s in a panic once I got that 60 attack I needed.  Then I could go use my special attack on the castle wars!
---
What is autoclicking?
---
What’s he clicking?
---
How do you stand in one spot not attacking, why not just click on them, or am I missing the point entirely..
---
Im level 90 combat so i cant use duradel for a while. Should i wait on my block list or just use it on neive?
---
Some youtuber named quackity raided the game for more f2p clothing crashing the servers a few times in the process which ended up putting the final nail on the coffin of the game as it wasnt really profitable it would seem
---
What were you expecting? Full 3rd Age?
---
Do it you pussy
---
You pretty much need to have HP, pray and either range or melee, I suppose you could go for a 1 attack  and defence account but it would suck killing kbd..
---
A few questions concerning the treasure chest in the POH:
---
* Is it possible to change treasure chest, so players can store separate parts of any sets, maybe with the design of the achievement log? Currently you are e.g. able to store separate parts of the trimmed monk's robe, the sandwich lady set, gold-trimmed leather and 3rd age Druidic (and 3rd age plateskirt?) but unable to store separate parts of other types of sets.
---
* In tune with above question: Can players have the opportunity to store both sets in the treasure chest? Currently you can only store either armour sets (with legs or skirt) and elegant sets for one gender (with legs or skirt/with shirt or blouse).
---
* Can there be added some consistency about which combined items that can be added to the treasure chest? Currently you can store some combined items such as Beret mask, Cavalier mask, Top hat &amp; monocle and Partyhat &amp; specs, but cannot store items such as Hat eyepatch, Pirate hat &amp; patch, Double eye patch (and any items with ornament kits attached).
---
* Can the following items be added to the treasure chest? Currently these are (AFAIK) the only rewards you cannot store in the treasure chest:
---
    * Team cape zero, -i and -x
---
    * (Black pickaxe)
---
    * (Willow-, Yew- and Magic comp bow)
---
But how are we supposed to finish the quest then
---
Big yikes.
---
Optimal would be brimhaven arena with karamja elite, followed by werewolf course followed by kandarin with teleport
---
What about cranking out Jad tasks? The 25k boost per task is really great, plus having the heights task weight of 10 would mean you would get it often. If you start doing them consistently around 70 range, it might make it fairly easy. 
---
If you do 100 Jad tasks that would get you a slayer xp surplus of 2.5m xp. Plus doing as many cannon-able tasks will help make that easier. You’d want to melee a good chunk of non-jad tasks as I’m sure the jad tasks are a good chunk of range xp.
---
The queen kill is the least of the grind for torso. The meat of the grind is doing waves 1-5 repeatedly to grind out role points.

Stupid comment of the year candidate.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
unless ur a hcim just make sure u have a key banked, zero risk pvming in this game anymore
---
I remember when I first started playing in 06 I think and I first found out that skillcapes cost 99k and I didn’t believe it at all. My noob ass thought there would be now way they would make you pay for a cape because it would take just as long to get 99k as it did to reach level 99... I kind of miss my noob f2p days
---
I think it was around 300k/hr if I remember correctly? Maybe half that. Used to be pretty decent if you were a noob, anyway.
---
Asking the real questions
---
Tryhards ruined the game.
---
oh so you’re hispanic. that explains all of this.
---
Stand around waiting for xp lamps untill 99 all stats. Good luck!
---
Question about bird houses:
---
I just started doing Bird House runs and im wondering how long I should wait between each run? I'm confused by this wiki page:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hunter#Bird\_house\_trapping](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hunter#Bird_house_trapping)
---
I notice it says that the bird houses gain about 1 nest per 5 minutes, holding up to 10. But on the table for XP rates, it says average houses per run (4 houses) and only says 4 nests for Willow (Only at hunter lvl 24 right now). What does it mean 'per run' then? Is it faster xp to just continuously run to each house dismantling and rebuilding then, getting like 1 nest per house or is it better to just wait an hour or so before collecting?
---
Already starting with the toughest boss. Personally soloing zilyana is the easiest thing ever if you look up a guide how to do it.
---
Level 99 is about 13m xp. You gain 3 slayer xp for every 4 hitpoints xp, so 13m hitpoints xp = 13000000*(3/4) = 9.75m slayer xp. You need to get the remaining 3.25m with cannon.
---
2 tasks isn't enough to cry "glitch"
---
You gonna let him talk down on your rl settings like that?!
---
Just curious, why?
---
Don't block Spectres, get an herb sack and rake in the money.
---
Clue scrolls are some of my favorite content in the game tbh
---
Tick manipulation is literally an exploit. It is one of the most clear examples of exploiting.
---
Yeah I image so, otherwise I feel like they would make it auto unskull when you leave the wilderness if that was intended
---
Your comment is the sperg version of the one you replied to
---
Do you honestly expect the game to last your entire lifetime? What happens when it's gone and you have a huge gap in your resume? And are the people selling gold paying and kind of tax on that income? If they're not they're breaking laws.
---
What's the plan for the future there? It doesn't sound like there is one.
---
Oh and by the way, people of a nation have the ability to take the power into their own hands, but you rarely see it happen. Needs to happen in the US for sure.
---
Here, go make your comment into a post and see how much traction it gets.
---
Regardless this is a sub for talking about OSRS not world politics. Using this game as a source of income as a player will not be sustainable. Partly because of game entigrity, partly because this game will not be around forever. Probably won't be around the rest of our lifetimes.
---
Actually all said and done, it seems you totally ignored the fact that I said, "**IF** this game doesn't pay your bills, get a fucking job"
---
I mean it's one line I can see how it got missed but it completely invalidates your argument, because you're arguing as if I said no one should try to make money off the game.
---
Oh also the account was banned so if you're getting banned I don't think it's working out the best, because you're 100% on the radar and getting watched.
---
i understand the equations, but dont get the order, is there a link between them all, or all seperate
---
Ok thanks I’ll look into this! Is bounty hunter the best place to start?
---
But you’d get more xp and chances at the pet without the unlock? It is completely useless
---
I would mine a full inventory of iron, smelt it into bars, carry it to an anvil, immediately make a full set of iron armor, bank it and repeat. I was the grand exchange of iron armours.
---
I feel like this is an unpopular opinion but I missed the runescape I played as a kid without the grand exchange. Yeah it was super inconvenient but there was something charming about going to varrock and haggling.
---
F for club penguin. I miss you card-jitsu
---
I have a 315 KC for GGs and haven’t gotten a single rare drop. It’s very frustrating to say the least
---
I think with the chance to kill an unarmed skiller the odds would be something like 1/3
---
It was where you start druidic ritual.
---
Cheers for that dude it helped me out a lot!
---
Shut up guys I can hear Zulharr drawing already!
---
Yeah bounty hunter is the best.
---
Will you ever expand on other skills so they don't get overshadowed by the big "money maker" skill which is Slayer?
---
GGs are better long term,  i.e. if you have the patience to kill them until you get the core.
---
*Hypercam2 intensifies*
---
Accurate
---
So it turns out I’m incorrect. You do in fact get 2 xp drops but in total they add up to the same as the final xp during a fight
---
They are all equivalent. Im just showing you how I got to the final equation (the one that is easy to plug numbers into) from the first one (the one that makes sense conceptually)
---
-Train mining at the mlm until you can buy a coal bag.
---
-Train smithing to 60.
---
-make mithril bars at the blast furnace for a nice 600k/h profit
---
Why XD?
---
Edit: In case you think you know me, its the first 6 letters of the green text at the bottom right followed by a few more letters in the same word.
---
No, you won't hack my acc right?
---
Wow another slayer dungeon with an instance boss !!! woooooooooooooooo
---
Post is still up though
---
Why even buy an account? The game isn’t fun unless you put the time and effort into yourself imo
---
I agree that people are drama queens a lot of the time.  For me, it wasn't that the announcement was particularly upsetting, but that it was just a standard all-talk/no-action statement that corporations routinely release.  I was kind of shocked at how much of this reddit apparently wasn't familiar with those types of things and took it seriously.
---
:)
---
Typically your best option will be to pay for a single month of membership and use that as a base to earn much better money to sustain it with gp (bonds)
---
Yeah Jagex should just ignore bots and let them do whatever :) 
---
Game already ruined by bots gg
---
Kinda reaching there homie. Are you sure your reaction isn't an overcompensation due to being ashamed that maybe you too are attracted to the chibi spiderman villains?
---
Yeah there's no about section if you're still using the old reddit layout.
---
It helps that he's in one of them
---
jammol-flox bad
---
That shortcut and hill giants/ poisoned spiders in stronghold always being full contributed heavily in my purchase
---
Maniped? I assume you mean people would be messaging in all the time to try and get their shit back? No shit? This is why you hire a team to handle it instead of putting someone like lead developer mod ash on customer support
---
75 range for blowpipe basically. I did it before it existed with like 70, first attempt but I played for years before so I'm using blowpipe as an example since with that weapon no one can objectively call Jad hard. 
---
Yeah he's a joke with 90+ range slayer task, even bigger joke with a Tbow. Pretty sure you can ignore healers on task completely with blowpipe (definitely can with tbow at least).
---
Happy cake day
---
So what have you done for the game since you've been given this responsibility? Doubt jagex gave you the crown so that you can hide in a 2k world and not do anything with it.
---
500k is 500k no matter how you slice it and if it takes you 8 years to get 99 rc that tells me all I need to know
---
What a coincidence, I made a small fortune in this exact area. That 10k spawn sure was handy
---
Right but see in your context it makes sense. "DOES ANYBODY ELSE ACTUALLY LIKE..." makes a lot more sense than "DOES ANYBODY ELSE THIS MEME..."
---
I wonder when warding will be polled. I’d assume after this elf expansion, but the end of the year is coming up quick lol
---
Seems more like understanding and optimization of trading methods around in game mechanics. Exploiting usually centers around bugs
---
For prayer fair enough mb. Crafting certainly isn't slow tho 330k xp/h is possible

The leather is buyable, but you can't make the leather into gloves unless you've finished DS2.

I just did one with cannons and it was the best! Thanks!

You could try wintertodt provided you have 50 firemaking. There is a lot of woodcutting involved and it's really easy with a decent profit, just use wines as food and hit 500 or 750 points. ask people there how to do it, just chop and burn it's super simple and imo afk as hell plus pet chance. use a games necklace to get there and use one of the official worlds and you'll be in a rhythm in no time
---
don't worry, Jagex has their professional detectives working on it.
---
Do you have more information about how this happened to you? I’m curious as to what happened.

Invention skill from rs3 that dissolves items and stuff to make other things seem like a good idea!
---
Yeah I learned something, he's still giving me pointers and tips and tricks, told me I looked like easy loot which is why I got pked.
---
Wow.  Somebody misinterpreted this post.  Or, just worships Jagex to a freaky degree.
---
Customers talk about products in ways other than pure praise. If an automatic Windows Update ruins my computer, am I not allowed to complain because I should just be grateful that they graced my existence by selling me a computer in the first place?
---
By the way, my post was a critique of the reddit community, not of Jagex directly.
---
Edgy. I love it
---
Ahhh, that makes sense. I'm indeed on the old layout.
---
This got me thinking that a Master Farmer alt would be awesome. A long investment into the account though. 
---
Isn't it possible this is just an alt without public on?
---
I don't beat to anyone not in rune plate.
---
Do every quest you can as soon as you can my friend it's great for unlocking content and bypassing early levels.
---
Sals realm or tipit bro
---
Thanks. Sounds like I need to get to work on elite void and try to get vorkath done. Sounds like I've got monkeys and nechrayels to kill as well.
---
AFAIK Kraken's mage defense is high enough that Augury is enough of an actual upgrade to be worthwhile, as opposed to Zulrah where it's not really worth it, especially because of phases.
---
Ancient shards on holy water, and give us a less ass way of collecting the holy water post-legend's quest maybe?

#WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AREYOUDEAF BOT?
---
🦀🦀JMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS🦀🦀
---
Lol yeah, I know.  Sorry.  I'm somewhat new here.
---
This is actually what I agree with, I like the instanced stuff, I dislike the buybacks.
---
&gt; Back when we played to have fun instead of min maxing
---
God I hate this sentiment. What if **I** find minmaxing fun? It always feels like people around here feel that enjoying playing efficiently is just not a thing
---
That is absolutely categorically incorrect and anybody who says that is wrong.
---
How has nobody mentioned 9/11 and George Bush yet
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Now we’re really thinking
---
Lol, make your own account dude...
---
You understand the word interrupt?
---
Every time I come back I always forget the stile is members only.
---
Hmmm. Seems kind of like a lost cause. Solving the bot problem would help a lot with gold buying
---
This sounds cool but should just be a new mini game all together.
---
Nightmare zone sucks for people who play a lot but for the rest of us, it's honestly amazing. It let's us access mid level content a bit earlier without having to dedicate hours and hours to playing, something not realistic to alot of people who work and stuff.
---
Your idea is really cool though. I'd want them to create new bosses or monsters for it so it doesn't become too easy to kill the current ones with even less risk than there is currently though
---
That's the player owned farm one. Slightly better landmark now than "that place north of ardougne"
---
I miss seeing pictures of Chinese bot farm server set ups back in the day.
---
I'll have whatever you're smoking
---
Imagine taking anyone seriously on the internet
---
The year is 2023 and there are more than 80 herb patches in the game
---
Ah thank you
---
Nothing to write home about.
---

---
I bet people really like you at parties
---
I have full graceful and 46 runecrafting and want to start rcing nats through the abyss, I will be skulled so will I lose graceful if I die and also what set up should I be using?
---
I dont even wanna flame right now... love is love i guess 😂
---
But needs a new wheel mechanism that's a 1/5k drop from npc spawns in temple trecking.
---
Yeah the mage level is the significant part. That’s why you wear armor with high mage def and low mage attack so you can do longer trips without losing dps. It helps quite a bit for zulrah. I mean it’s pretty cheap so you may as well get it and spend the rest on levels
---
Club penguin :(

What a Chad
---
Only hundreds, hahaha
---
Socialscape is pretty chill and has no requirements. If you want a more oriented clan (pvm or pvp, for example), you can look for them on the official forums

Well 2 bolt racks is basically nothing lol, if you get high % (which you shouldn’t) you’ll get hundreds of them

They're like 6k a herb now, were around 10k prior to farming guild update

You and Zuhaar especially, and all the other Runescaoe artists are my prime motivation to give drawing a shot. &lt;3
---
i think you’ll be able to do it with almost no stats
---
This is so good wow.
---
That's what egg_irl is. "I don't want to be trans, I want to be a cute girl".
---
Settled good.
---
Spinning wheel bad.
---
Gotcha. Haven't played RS3 in like 8 years so I wasn't sure.
---
The machine should be plenty powerful, but I think someone came with the issue you couldn't play in the browser (since they no longe support Java applets)
---
You should be able to run runelite on one (it's an executable jar), but I'm not sure on the details
---
They've been trying to add a skill for like 2-3 years now and still couldn't with this "community". And just now in the stream they did, every suggestion the chat is just bombarded with No's.
---
Yeah it does.
---
Still viable
---
This picture actually represents the players. Jagex has many times said that they are working on it, and have even made 2 blogs already with more to come. But i guess they don't care :)
---
Imagine going into a thread and seeing someone run all the 2FA checks with another user and trying to be helpful, and then just being a complete asshole in response totally out of nowhere. You gotta figure out a new way to be, man
---
Pls alch yourself I'm at 0 zenytes in 750 kills 😭
---
Yeah I would reccomend the MLM, it is a little more afk. Also helps if you are trying to get a coal bag.
---
There’s always one person to ruin the joke.
---
That’s fair, I just think sitting in an instance afk all day training your “combat” stats is a little odd.. especially since it’s some of the best exp in the game... 
---
But I get that it’s great to do on mobile at work, or to do at home while doing other stuff. Let’s you have a bit of a life.
---
You can use it to spec a stack of warped jellies on the catacombs to farm hard clues pretty fast. Barrage while spec recharges.
---
Not really useful anywhere else. Claws and even sometimes dds is better for speccing bosses like Corp and cerberus
---
Yeah those are pretty much not the same thing. All the egg sub is is trans people projecting on to other people's idle fantasy. It's armchair psychology and annoying.
---
That's the al kharid gate,  Shanty Pass is the one you need a ticket to get into the big desert

Lol fuck no

Looks like you're a born LOOOOSEEEEEER
---
You are welcome.

TIP.IT baby
---
I always go for str first on my accounts just because that way I know I’m getting my max hit and close to the max xp per hour, but overall with those levels I think they would be very close in terms of time
---
&gt; I think the drop table appears worse than it really is because people compare it to the OP table of regular gargoyles
---
To be fair, it's not like it's being compared to Vorkath or Zulrah, the gp/h is just worse than the regular version of the monster they're bosses of. That just doesn't make sense, even if the regular monsters have an OP drop table.
---
What are the peak times for revs, when should I go and which mobs should I kill? Didn’t get pked at first but now I got pked twice in a row.
---
get 99 str first as you are fighting 1 def npcs so attack matters less.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Full_guide/Beginner

Here's a guide, for all the beginner clues. Scroll down for stats.

Cheers mate have fun with it ;)
---
Those spinning blade things were OP as fuck
---
rough stuff m8. We're having a good time over here
---
Moving the imbue rewards from NMZ to Warding implies that they have no intentions to change the minigame. It will probably remain an afk mess since people like their ezscape.
---
In my opinion the imbues would fit much better as something players can create themselves, and Warding would do fine with that if Jagex would actually design it better.
---
$11
---
I find that splashing is the best for hp xp
---
Also has anyone had that weird glitch were your hp xp doesn’t go up?
---
Maybe because all the skills they want to add are shit? Sailing was a meme, warding is a Joke and artisan was the best one they had so far. Don’t think they need a new skill at all
---
Less about bots and more about monster drops. Zulrah drops a 1000 noted flax 1/25 and Kurasks drop 100 1/20
---
The funniest part is they even tweeted about it like two days ago, but... nah, memes
---

---
1. Your acount is still there, but that account you're mentioning is probably your RS3 account.
---
2. Check to see if it works on the RS3 side of things,  you might need to send additional information to Jagex if your password is incorrect.
---
3. No lol, its there.
---
Why has the dragon hunter lance dropped so much in price recently? After selling my bank for a dhcb to get the kbd pet my next target is vorkath. Would it be worth it to sell my dhcb buy back my melee gear and use the dhl against vorkath?
---
Ayayayayayayaya awaken my masters
---
It's actually a north american thing primarily (and at that more-so just english) that places the denominating currencies symbol before the value. More often than not it is actually following the value.
---
Ah! I had it mistaken this whole time mb lol
---
Same issue, this has been happening alot recently and it's def been a major disappointment. Kind of like what my dad keeps saying about me
---
I don't mind changing some German labels for Canada aswell.
---
Ide sell them 100 at a time. I would even only pick exactly 100 and spin only exactly 100 and then sell them.
---
So many wasted inventory spaces
---
No, eggs are trans people who haven't quite understood themselves. Everyone thinks "what if I was of a different gender" but the "eggs" make it into a constant obsession.
---
I was thinking about some of the US world...but that works i guess
---
U spent ur week off from a bzck injury...sitting in a chair all week playing runescape. Smart rofl.
---
Me and the girls
---
Acksually it's *under* a new herb patch
---
My logic may be flawwed as it doesn't fully account for the imbalance in the osrs combat triangle or how strong toxic blowpipe is. HA values are important to me as a guideline, but not a determinant. My logic accounts for the following:
---
-Pricing trends of consumables
---
-return on investment
---
For darts, the pricing trend is roughly 1/10 bar price = dart price. For this example, rune bars are roughly 12k while rune darts are close to 1/10th of that. The problem is, we don't have an analog for dragon dart tips, so we're unable to derive their final price.
---
Working backwards though, we would assume a raw material price close to 30k. This would be more than double the price of a 12k runite bar
---
As a segue to my next point, currently, players are paying more than double the price of rune darts for +6 more range Str bonus. At level 99 range, with bp, clean Max hits sit at 20/30spec for rune, and 21/31 spec for dragon. This is an extreme case of diminishing returns on investment.
---
If you were to be able to create dragon materials from bones, at a cost of 2.5k per bone, if you were able to fletch an average of 5 for arrowtip, and 1 to 2 for dart tips, utilizing the previous raw material derivation, equilized prices would rest at about 500gp per arrow, and 2.5k to 1.25k per dart.
---
Take my upvote
---
£100k monthly for 4 new staff, to monitor a report system that's linked to a game of 1m+ players, using a feature to try and get free items?  
---
Sure, sounds worth the investment by Jagex..
---
It'd be nice to see some bosses designed around duo/trio. I'd still want them to be instanced though.
---
No, wait, I-
---
so for combat i assume you will never use any weapons or armor and max defense then attack then strength? or is this going to be a skiller account with no combat
---
I remember Rune Village and reading Paco Taco and Jaron99's stories.
---
Laying in bed, didnt do 1-99 that week. Just finished the 99 during time off.
---
No
---
 It's actually a north american thing primarily (and at that more-so just english) that places the denominating currencies symbol before the value. More often than not it is actually following the value. For the most part it's just an English idiom.
---
Ah yes, instanced is fine, I more solo. My bad.
---
so what you're gonna want to do is make the number go up, while also not letting the number go down.
---
It is mine
---
Zeg makker
---
i did this for a while the other day and never saw a single PKer.
---
graceful, pickaxe equipped, glory equipped. buy 5-10 glories and recharge with dragonstone recharge scrolls once they are all dead.
---
kill random creatures in the abyss before starting to get the rc bags. you can use small and med at your level and large once you are 50rc.
---
never forget the dude who spent like 30 comments telling me his hyped had died down because he took too long on the video before this one
---
Quit recording shit with a phone
---
Yea gimme ur karma
---
When you try arguing that 500k isn't half a million, other comments like the time it takes to complete 99 runecrafting are taken more literal than intended
---
Make the req whatever diary he can't finish and have the npc tell you to up the ante and go finish it.
---
Men really aren’t loyal he’s out here buying another one
---
They’re synonyms. It’s like saying all cats In rs should be called felines
---
Honestly with the current market, I think it is more wise to just hold on to your gp. Everything has been crashing hard, with no end in sight. As fewer people play the game now that the mobile crazy is ending, prices will continue to drop.
---
Try and join a clan, 99% of the time people love to give info to newbies. And having people at hand to ask questions to is amazingly helpful early. Also check out the official osrs wiki for quest and monster info
---
How do raids work with ironmen now and why can't they just do that?
---
Under what definition?
---
Mining rune ess and selling to runecrafters
---
Oh I didnt forget I'm just too lazy to walk over there. And let's be honestly who really goes over there that often?
---
Leave it as your gear and go bossing to make coins
---
\&gt; not starting as a woman
---
Your logic is flawwed as the price of darts are artificially high due to lack of demand caused by low supply resulting from restrictive drop sources.
---
Dragon darts are not three times as effective as rune darts, yet they are priced at three times the value of rune darts.
---
Because raids have reward chests for completing the raid, not strictly for killing the boss, this means something like corp or graardor which actually has a drop table is a little different, I wouldnt be against letting irons join PvM content, reduces griefing to them and removes the hamstringing that they inadvertently cause
---
Finally got 85 cb, starting my first nieve task after I finish my wyrms one.
---
The osrs economy is experiencing deflation. So your coins will be worth more 6 mo the from now.
---
If the point of runescape hinged on nobody having fun unless they'd spent thousands of hours "earning it" then the game would have been replace by private servers.
---
I think tournament worlds should require membership to access (as they do currently) and be permanent.
---
Dude I did the same thing!  Killed men for coins so I could buy a steel 2h 😂😂
---
Chromebooks are stupidly locked down to installing new software. I'd be surprised if you could get Runelite working on one.
---
Hi everyone, these videos are going to be posted occasionally as a resource to document where the OSRS and RSHD (2008-2013) instruments came from. If anyone has any additional insight on what they used, feel free to contribute! I can try to answer any questions you may have as well :)
---
Unpopular opinion in this thread: I like instance stuff it means I have a fair shot at getting drops and I don't lose all my stuff when I die the diffence between a casual player and a hardcore one is massive, if people are having to compete to get a kill every boss people the rich would get richer the poor would stay poor and quit
---
Believe it or not, he crashed me. I was in awe but not sure if it was because he's a mad lad, or doesn't know any better.
---
Interesting. Is this widespread across most items?
---
im assuming at the end of summer
---
Look at ge tracker graphs.
---
fucking cute, love it :3 keep it up!
---
Its more like 5 minutes.
---
oof
---
That is true, but I think they really did their best in warding showing how or if it will effect the economy, the reasoning and the potential from it in their blog, and did a good job showcasing it in their reveal video. Even though your point is valid, I feel as if most of the community will just decline it (And any other new skill) solely on the fact it is a new skill and not because they don't like it.
---
Yes I am, but uh... I forgot my username and password for OSRS! Can you remind myself of it again?
---
Good to know. I haven't been played since around mid January so have been out of the loop.
---
I learned how to parallel park by playing on the run
---
Same literally just now realizing it’s shorter to go past the wizards lmao
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Forgot T-Bow spawn
---
think i did it first because its easy at level 3 and afk, i just do what i want on my ironman now and enjoying the mid game content so much
---
Ahh gotcha. And yeah a break might bring back your motivation hah.
---
ok
---
I should have asked this question a while ago. My bank shrank 40m on a four month break with all my capital spent 😔
---
Wtf.
---
I seem to remember the slayer helmet already has the maximum amount of polygons that any object in rs can have
---
I second this blocklist though I'd replace the spectres with black/greater demons (don't block black demons if you plan to do demonic gorillas in the future).
---
You do want to move to Duradel as soon as possible though because Nieve has a strangely high weight on dragons, especially metal dragons, which sucks ass.
---
Trying to rebuild a clan, have people from all over. Check it out sometime if ya want, The07Grindz. Focus is on PVM and skilling, but we have some members ready to learn raids as well. Can send you the link to Discord as well if you message me.
---
Nice!
---
They also ignoredcritical questions from their Q&amp;A thread.
---
This is becoming a pure PR instrument - the community focus is lacking.
---
Based on the replies I'm seeing I think the best option to save ironmen from themselves is to nerf the supply crates for ironmen if that's possible or perhaps not allow ironmen to do it period.  There shouldn't be such an obviously superior minigame that feels "mandatory" to ironmen.
---
*tasty*
---
If you're doing non-Slayer combat training, wearing full Obsidian armour + Berserker necklace + obby sword will be a lot more xph than whip/str gear.
---
I don't. Like I said to MizzouRB, I have hard time to spot sarcasm, even between with friends. I already said sorry and accidentally left an ironic reply where you replied, you still think I am looking to get myself offended. I have told you the truth too and I have nothing more to add it. Make your own conclusions with these comments.
---
Nevertheless, let's just enjoy the game and other topics without anymore fighting with each other.
---
New pkers? I have been pking since 2008, so don’t walk around all macho. This post was about reviving dead content through the use of making chivalry relevant again. Chivalry provides a 3% strength boost. That is a main factor, as well as losing the need to click on three prayers to be able to activate everything that chivalry and piety does offer. STOP SAYIJG PIETY TO ZERKS. I’m not sure if you even know what chivalry is, but I am not saying give piety access to zerkers or pures. Please reread the post about what I mentioned.
---
Go with wyrms, they give 175 xp in gilded altar. Also u can kill them easily in just black dhide and a few monkfish.
---
Thanks
---
I'm feeling a bit lost right now tbh, this was always my end goal. I'll probably become a member soon.
---
The telegrab spell still exists, yes.
---
If Jagex wants a way to revitalize the wildy, this right here would be a start

6383 right now, and I remember farming them about a decade ago and them going for 7k max.  I guess I missed some fluctuations in the middle since I only started playing OSRS recently.
---
&gt; Wish it was as easy as dropping 3k
---
I agree! For starters, in real life, its 30k!
---
no
---
Yeah, been getting better what it used to be, but still got A LOT progress to make.
---
Mod Ash has 200m xp on Twitter.
---
I always feel that way too when I complete a goal I've had for a while. To be honest. Dragon Slayer really is the end goal for a f2p account. Not much more content to unlock in that aspect until you try members. Then you have SO much content ahead of you.
---
You should also receive teleport scrolls from it, so we can teleport directly to the new patches
---
Demon ash???
---
Oh.
---
Okay yes that is ridiculous.
---
swap it like it’s hot
---
Is it a 40% drop rate in RS, too?
---
What's the drop that there's 19 of? The book looking thing, not the beer.
---
Scaled back?  Since release, ToB automatically scales itself based on how many players are present at the start of the raid.  It's always been quite feasible to trio/4man/5man, and an experienced duo is also the same concept.
---
You can also use a mouse on mobile if your phone is compatible lol
---
That's how I found rs back in the day! &lt;3
---
This seems very phishy
---
We used to play it with 2 people back then. One would aim and one would run. It was an effective strategy.
---
No. I think inferno is BiS. Skillcapes may be best for a niche activity or a skill but not combat forsure.
---
DJ Jazzy Jeff and uncle Phil spawn as adds, start fighting each other.
---
Watch his attack animations?
---
Yeah, seems like they are doing something in the first trade window to trick the game into thinking the gp is still there in the second trade window. I think the dc OP had was just a coincidence.
---
I heard about this through rumours in the clan, didn’t think it was true.
---
I love questing too. \^\^ When possible, I try to do them without guides for extra atmosphere and challenge.
---
I thought there was a guy you could talk to in Lumbridge to shut them off.

&lt; 2 hours of work for double the loot is nice lol

Aaah, nothing like a nice cuppa tea!

See a psychologist.

I have a friend who reliably makes 250m a day flipping, when he has more than 7b. Its entirely possible. Also, you make, with current prices, about 15m an hour at tob of youre half decent at speed running. Cannot give an exact number, but I could probably push 12m+ an hour doing 1+3 at chambers
---
Just because youre mediocre with basic head running at olm, doesnt mean everyone is. If youre not getting these numbers, then i can promise that youre not as good as you think you are
---
Im stuck at the final boss fight, cant get past the wave phase. I do damage and i think i would have enough supplies for the fight its just that i just cant get pass the wave phase. Any advice you can give me?
---
How bad is your friend's scoliosis from playing mobile only?
---
Thank you this most helpful!
---
Rekt
---
I like it so much how nowadays Jagex Moderators' are part of the community more than ever before. &lt;3
---
Just test it out. Personally when I get items/gains on the ironman I feel more accomplished if that makes sense. Getting excited for drops that you wouldn't even pick up on a regular account.
---
Only if it works similar to the chaos altar but with herbs.
---
You think they’d fucking pay 25k per person per month for a position like that? Where the fuck do you live? In lalaland of make believe?
---
Honestly I'm fairly new myself. Anytime I have questions I just use the OSRS WIKI, the fandom page is out of date so dont use that. If you're f2p just get quests done. That's a great first step to get you kinda doing everything. If you're members do waterfall quest early, and I recommend training at least a few levels in agility for the run restore.
---
FWIW I've been doing hydra for the last ~3 weeks and have seen a fuckton of people but obviously that's anecdotal
---
I mean I'm open to other ideas for why DHL and the like are dropping. Obviously it's amazing for raids 1 so it's not like you can argue that it's not useful, ergo it's getting cheaper.

Buying gf 50k gp
---
Irrelevant, but good job bud.
---
Nah just playing for fun. Mobile only btw.
---
I started as area locked, but i picked a bad location and got annoyed, so i just went regular UIM.
---
Planning out little goals and to do lists for myself is fun. And questing feels more rewarding then on a main
---
I just got a switch, how are the new Pokémon games? My favorites were like ruby and sapphire and prior so am I going to hate it or be out of the loop?
---
Damage Jad to 0 hp.
---
Keep your hp above 0.
---
Keep trying. Most people screw up and die on their first attempt, or their first few attempts. Learn from your mistakes and try again.
---
I killed yaks from 60-80 attack and 60-70 strength. I would get home from school every day and kill yaks for about 5 hours. Still had fun though!

I'm an ironman, i stand alone.
---
I was only 14 the last time I played and couldn't afford a member's account. That's the very first thing I bought for myself this time around lol but I will give that a look. Thanks so much, fellow adventurer.
---
Yea like the look of Wyrms based on their drops and only 62 slayer so I'm pretty close to that. Thanks for the tip.
---
Atta boy
---
I saw people playing it at the library around 2004, that's when I got interested.
---
If you need practice prayer switching against Jad, type in “JAD simulator” into google and the first Runeapps link you See should take you to a little simulator. It looks different from OSRS Jad but the attacks and prayers are exactly the same. You can practice getting used to the sounds and animations before doing the real thing.
---
You can even practice taking pots during the fight by adjusting the settings a bit.
---
Thought I was on /r/waterniggas for a sec

This has been pitched and rejected because people wouldnt do their grinds unless they were spotlighted.  Like you'd wait to get void/torso until those minigames were spotlighted, which would kill the minigame for like 2 months.  Plus no one would play trouble brewing etc for xp unless it was OP xp.  Castle wars would prob get a serious boost for decent xp though.
---
Why bring a dragon war hammer? Cerbs defence is already so low.
---
I got boxes full of Pepe!
---
Nice, it's one pet i am hoping to receive eventually. Think it's the best looking one.
---
Sure thing man!
---
If the bonus matters more (for enemies with heavy disproportionate stab weakness) Ardy cape *might* be better. In most cases inferno is better though.
---
Your able to so pretty much
---
This is the Screenshot Police! You didn't censor out your name, hp, prayer, the minimap, or your adamant scim. We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, sir.
---
Cope harder
---
Hey this is very helpful indeed! I always forget about my prayers.....heading to the Grand exchange now to do just that! 
---
Bonus question: where's a good spot for catching lobster in the future?
---
I was doing high level PVM on my main, and just got super bored. The items meant nothing but GP, which meant nothing really. Besides maybe getting all 3a? I had all the max BIS gear. It was pointless. I could max, but that sounds horrible. Now i'm a mid level ironman, and grinding to get better gear is so much more fun. The sense of accomplishment is 10 fold.
---
G maul is pretty much good for pking and nothing else.
---
For training purposes scimitars, whip, etc. are typically your best option. At higher levels (60+ attack) there's more options, but they usually all have high strength bonuses and fast attack speeds.
---
Best would be getting 70-77 slayer and killing kurasks, wyverns, gargs, or brutal black drags.
---
Thanks for the reply this clarifies allot!
---
Looking back at it that game had crazy graphics for a early 2000s browser game
---
Decent as a spec weapon until you get a DDS. Not a good main hand weapon. It's just way too slow.
---
Generally speaking, faster weapons are better.
---
You can downgrade contracts for free, so there's never a reason *not* to start with a hard contract if you have the level for it
---
3m xp in 3 days? jfc
---
I don't know much of the content post EOC since I had quit, But I know RS2 has a lot more content, much more enjoyable and feels a lot more alive and up to date than OSRS. More skills more minigames more equipment, everything. Most importantly in my opinion is that it doesn't look like minecraft. Just feels like the devs are walking on eggshells and are just too scared/lazy to create new content. Not to mention the fact their reply to any suggestion is "that is engine work".
---
Not that everyone agrees, when I did Jad and since, I turn all sound off. It makes it to much to focus on, I just watch him stomp or rear up to dictate which attach will be coming. As others said always be hovering pray tab. Don’t keep inventory open or anything unless eating then switch back to prayer. Get comfortable with hot keys and you’ll murder him. You got this shit
---
Join a clan.
---
When you get to 98 range go train melee til 99hp (nmz should be quick). It's very easy to get untrimmed hp
---
Counted separately so you can't do wildy tasks just for milestones.
---
There’s another thread post made about 44m ago that has a great deal is discussion about Ironman accounts. 
---
From what I posted in the discussion prior to this one.. I’ll make a long story short. 
---
I’ve quite frankly become bored of normal accounts.  Each skill I train becomes more of a chore rather than an accomplishment on an Ironman.  If you already have a well developed account, what is going to stop you from overloading a new account with supplies to make it easy.  Ironman accounts actually bring a challenge to the game that makes it more exciting and addictive.  Since I’ve made my HCIM I come to realize how rare a glory &amp; a MSB actually is.  
---
Another aspect is you see everyone running around in barrows, GWD gear, etc.  Well, I can almost guarantee you that person bought the gear on the GE rather than actually kill the boss that drops it.  Which in my eyes is quite the easy mode and gets really boring.  
---
Here is my suggestion.  Make an Ironman, get your first 100k and tell me how accomplished you feel.  If you make it past dragon slayer, getting full rune will feel like getting your first godsword.
---
You’re a bitch.
---
You should slay your wife  first
---
*Smited instantly*
---
🦀🦀 €11 🦀🦀
---
I haven’t done it myself, but I think you can fish for lobster in Karamja. You need a lobster pot and 40 fishing to catch them, and then 40 cooking to cook them. 
---
I’d recommend having stats a bit higher than that if you plan to do it efficiently, since you’ll likely burn quite a few of them while cooking at level.
---
It's good for training on nechs with a spec transfer alt (over 250k/hr strength xp)
---
Especially games that require looking at the player character frequently. Might as well make the character enjoyable to look at
---
Im using both now lol i dislike the way wiki is setup, runehq has it broken down more.
---
It seems fairly normal to me on this game, most people do afk training, or play on mobile. Your best bet is probably going around clan chats looking for one that clicks with you.
---
Either that or get friends to pl- lol who am i kidding
---
It's because the message is in all caps
---
I cant get over this video, its so good!
---
damn OP all I have to say is I’m sorry. This would be enough to make me quit and honestly just make me feel upset at everything for the next few weeks
---
Half the people who play now are maxed, the other half are afkers
---
Balanced as all things should be
---
So if I wanted to train my attack (I’m presently at 50) would it be best to stick with my brine Sabre?
---
I think a universal bonus to slater creatures may be a little too much. Maybe a specific boost against that type of mob (abby demons/dragons/hydras) depending on the helm type.
---
I would definitely be down for a Godwars expansion. Something that is a little higher difficulty though.
---
If I'm remembering right, brine sabre is equivalent or similar stats to a rune scimitar, so depending on your attack level that may currently be your best in slot.
---
Not necessary.
---
It used to be base scaled to 5 though, didn't go down with less people
---
Because the mobile client was build from the ground up and can actually utilize the hardware to it's fullest extent. The desktop client can use 1 CPU core ...
---
Okay cool thanks for the reply this was helpful!
---
Where my dudes at who played Robot Rage, Grind for that FlameFlower!
---
Also aerial aces and Need for madness were the shit alongside Zed and Heli Attack
---
Does anyone have the original?
---
Sounds like Lil Cards
---
I got proof that I do, due October 15th
---
Yes cousin
---
Not the one on Ape Atoll
---
Well, longer trips doesn’t help if the kills are slower anyways. I mean yeah you can do whatever you like but I’m just sayin it’s not the best way to go lol
---
Looks like I have some slayer levels to grind, thanks. I might have been having bad luck with my hard contracts then
---
No, it took me like 4 hours but that's nothing compared to anglers/prospector.
---
Fuck dude you just dredged a memory out of my brain. What the hell was that game called
---
What do you want claws for? They aren’t really used for much besides tob and pking
---
I did this with Merlins Revenge, 1 person moving and 1 person attacking.
---
You're not trying to fight them in the kalphite cave, are you? That's slayer assignment only and it's different from the kalphite lair.
---
Check the wiki
---
and steal his car
---
Blowpipe and trident of the seas probably
---
Why'd you delete this and resubmit it?
---
Thanks, I have miscellania on max herbs atm, haven't checked it in a couple of days, gonna hold out for a few more. I'm really only hunting those herb seeds to get some herb exp on my ironman.
---
I want you in my room
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Ancients too, and using the catapult... then a couole high lvl melee players would come up the wall and kill all the noin mages haha.

I run over to the master farmer on these worlds and I'm seeing the similarly named bots over there, but they're all newer and some worlds only have like 1 or 2 now. 40ish/50ish theiving. 
---
I think Jagex just nuked the entire master farmer bot operation and the owner is rebuilding it all today.
---
There is no player data stored by Runelite. It simply serves the game to you.
---
Runelite is free and has more plugins than the paid version of osb. You can always go to their discord and get support or suggest new features. It’s updated weekly along with the game itself.
---
Yup 😂
---
I know man... I played CW with a bunch of old friend that I havent talked to in ten years
---
Probably, I was experiencing super lag earlier as well
---
he traded you the cash, knowing you will take out the lance from the bank, as soon as you did that, they loged in and traded your lance and their 90m back to them.
---
That is true. Maybe I've been having bad luck, but every time I get a fruit contract, and I switch to medium, I always get another fruit contract( even if I downgrade to easy afterwards too)m thanks for the reply
---
Oh i always thought the cave was the lair :D. Found the real place now thanks mate.
---
Only boss I struggled with was zammy. My stats are a  bit low for solo gwd but I was doing them for fremmy elite. Bandos was the easiest by far
---
Lmfao you make a Reddit account for Runescape and to shit on America. Such a cool guy.
---
So you missed out on a few minutes of exp unless u were botting lol..
---
rs2 and diablo 2 are nothing alike.
---
I didn't realize people were so personally invested in this. Play the game how you want. It's everybody's right to do so. I don't get it myself but I wasn't trying to suggest anybody is "wrong" for playing how they want.
---
What was husky saying
---
you probably were doing something wrong, like checking all the traps and not having a high thieving level at the end of the course, at 50 thieving you can finish the course with 47 which gives you about 75% to be successful and about 66% chance to get a item box.
---
I don’t even feel like touching the game anymore. I was going for inferno cape and having everything disappear over two hours is just mind dissolving. I’m so lost as to how this happened and what to do now
---
The gatekeeping in the RS community is freaking unreal.
---
What kind of clan? If you are interested in high end PVM there is Oblivion.
---
There is also Wilderness Guardians who have many events including pvm and pvp.
---
Nope
---
It's still alive. Emerald and the dark seas are still active. (played it 3 months ago)
---
Jokes on them, some of us actually collect burnt food as a rare collection.
---
Gekoloniseerd
---
And then Jagex has to roll back the servers
---
Right lol
---
Why are you so angry at life?
---
Cheers dits
---
I followed a guide for start up only, really. Just to get an idea of decent ways to start gathering resources and help my account later on in mid-end game. After you're into mid game it starts to become a blast going for drops, doing barrows with hard diary, trying to complete your collection log. Not everything has to be a guide, just no sense to hinder yourself even more by doing mundane methods in the beginning.
---
Better yet, just tell it to filter all *seed*, then add the specific ones you want to highlight.  I’ve only got like Ranarr and all the expensive seeds highlighted
---
My brother's friend Rudy told him about the game and i overheard them so i made a account too. We all shared our passwords then 1 day I notice my sapphire ring missing and fucking Rudy took it i knew this because i logged into his account. 
---
That mother fucker
---
its not a charity for noobs man, people want xp. i don't understand why you can't comprehend that.
---
I did use pretty triggering language though. That's my bad.
---
Face the camera the way that the waves will come from. So that galvek is still visible on the left of the screen.  Run diagonally until you get to the open spot. Worked for me, eventually anyway. That's the phase I struggled with also.
---
Then it shouldn’t have been worth opening up and commenting on. Only takes 2 milliseconds to scroll past.
---
Well, brutal black dragons do require 77 slayer at least. Still I agree that the KBD's drop table is a bit underwhelming, and honestly it's simply a result of outdated content. The KBD was literally the first boss introduced to runescape and at the time was the source of bank loot. Now, it's mostly a relic and just a fun boss for mid level players to try out. Since the KBD is no longer really end game content, I don't think it should be treated as such. The dragon pick and pet were added for more incentive to kill it, and it's plenty crowded as it is. Therefore I don't feel that a drop table buff is necessary just because brutal blacks have a better one.
---
You mean something like raids or gwd?
---
2retnuh
---
nice.
---
&gt;I can’t recall entering my login+pw anywhere else besides runescape
---
That's the point of phishing, they make you think you are working with a legit client or website or otherwise you wouldn't give them your info.
---
I mean spamming stupid shit they’re already aware of is just annoying
---
Bots are easy to piss off and break. Tele other. Set up a cannon to prevent trap setup and kill their chins. You'll have the entire peninsula to yourself in notime, but of course remember to report first. Still not sure if it does anything  but do it anyway
---
You may be thinking of Curveball
---
Once an account is recovered its forever compromised. They have the information they need to get successful recovery requests. Even if you can get in contact with a jmod and they say they've added a note or some shit, or removed the info the hijackers use to recover it, its bullshit. It'll still work. 
---
Make a new account, secure it, transfer all gp off your account and start a new.
---
Make the compromised account an afk gp farming account, just dont keep much on it ever.
---
Also stop clicking on emails claiming to be from jagex period, unless you specifically requested/know ones coming.

Unacceptable that one cake Can last you 2 matches . It’s called op and unbalanced .

fuck authenticator delay, I want to know why you dont need an authenticator to have full access to the account via the website. Shit even if it's a different authenticator than the rs account's to login to the game, surely it cannot be that hard to implement.

Rewards scale with skill levels no combat level btw meaning a level 3 skillet can do Todt more afk and efficiently than a max toon .

I've seen people request the same "note" thing and have got it approved. I believe with help from a Jmod there is hope to play on my account still. Ie) making a note where recovery requests have to contain something that only I know and is also within the note.
---
EDIT:
---
As stated above I learned from my mistakes and never click on any emails from claiming to be from jagex. I go through the official website directly:

Idk about ruined the game, I think thats just the niche that osrs hits amongst a zillion other mmos.
---
Didn’t hide Authenticator code, thanks for the account.
---
Lol that’s what I meant
---
Other way around, rares are a common drop but 39/40 times it's rewind time baby

Oh yesssss

The one osrs has was the most nostalgic for me but osrs has been out for years and now i associate it with osrs rather than rs2 so i kinda agree with u

You fucking went all the way around the most bumblefuck back alley bullshit path in RuneScape all for fucking east varrock? 10 years later and I'm still doing all I can to avoid that place like the fucking plague and every time I go there i feel like I'm in the slums of osrs. If I walked all that way just to get to fucking east varrock bs I woulda quit osrs then and there

They would just use it and not check the 30 day safe button

Replace "skillers can smd" with "y fletch?" then its perfect

I've seen pmods act that way at Todt...

A middle ground would be pmods get a dedicated jmod to oversee their reports and a jmod could manually review the account reported and issue a manual ban, rather than waiting till it's automatically banned in a wave
---
We already know that the client can leak IP.  Likely the connection is UDP and so given a known IP has a known port open that is connecting to a known server IP the spoofing is quite trivial.
---
Let's assume the server sends a batch of updates for a tick with a given ID to a user, and the client rejects packets with a tick packet ID it already has read, all the attacker needs to do is spoof the tick packet for the tick that the attacker removes the gold.
---
Get off reddit and enjoy being a noob

The false equivalence is comparing a game made in someone’s kitchen by three guys in 2001 (not 2007) designed to be able to run on toasters to a game made in 2007 by a well funded game development company designed specifically to push hardware to it’s limits. Push it so far to the limits that the average gamer’s hardware at the time couldn’t even run the game.
---
But you’re welcome to continue being intentionally disingenuous so you can feel you’re right. :)
---
Beats Ardy with an alt? I can trap him in two tiles there and he can't escape.
---
congrats on getting there irl too, though!
---
Haha yeah
---
You set up an authenticator on your account which you use to log into the game from new computers. It's an extra step that shows you're the only one with access to the authenticator. Except you can just log into your account on the website without needing it and deactivate it instantly, bypassing the whole reason it exists.
---
People want a delay added to deactivating it so that they have a chance to alert Jagex that someone else has stolen your account credentials.
---
I love this series. I keep recommending to my friends but idk if they’ve started it yet.
---
Just get 99 agility
---
It’s BIS pick, no?
---
You okay? Why are you so mad about things that don’t effect you in the long run?
---
The idea is that worked similar to a bank pin. If your account gets recovered or hacked and someone wants to log in, they must first request the removal of the authenticator and it'll take a few days for it to be removed, in the meanwhile the original owner can cancel the request if he notices.
---
It's kind of a band-aid solution for the faulty recovery system (faulty because it could potentially give your account to a hacker if he has enough info on you). It relies on the original owner noticing the recovery is going on, and also has a few downsides like not being able to recover your own account if the hacker manages to set an authenticator, and also losing membership time if you lose your phone.
---
Overall I feel fixing the recovery system would be a better idea (implementing one-time recovery codes or government ID validation), but the authenticator delay is a more popular one around here.
---

yeah, waiting for the 20 second animations between each phase is so fun haha! but nah all sarcasm aside, I think if they were able to shorten or remove the long phase changing animations the boss would be great. even if the hp was increased a bit to compromise.

So like I said gloves are the only slot you can't buy.  And even then that's only applicable in some instances.  For magic for example it's buyable for gloves.

"Nothing mechanically hard"
---
Took the best pvmer 2 days to do it and many attempts after all the mechanics were figured out. Woox is extremely cold and doesn't panic yet he still fucked up. So please, don't even attempt to just claim it's "because it takes 2 hours to get to Zuk". Yes, it's a factor, but it's not the only factor at all. 
---
The Zuk healer phase is mechanically hard, minions can be hard if you're unlucky and triple Jad is too for some people. This is coming from someone who killed Zuk on his 2nd attempt and never failed triples.
---
Jad was done on day 1 in 2005 when there was no OP gear and when players in general were at a much lower skill level than today, they didn't even know what a tick was.

You're just an idiot, that's all. If you were dumb enough to think that someone would pay 90m for a lance AT G.E when they can literally buy one for like 5m cheaper at the EXACT SAME LOCATION then you were probably too dumb to actually confirm they put up 90m &amp; you deserved what you got. No sympathy.

Can you name a successful game where you lose all your shit if you die in a PvM instance? Legitimately curious because this sounds retarded and like it would drive everyone interested in getting into high level PvM away.
