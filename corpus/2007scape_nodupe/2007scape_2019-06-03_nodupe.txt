I'd love someone to train me doing pvm. I started back in February and I've watched a couple videos but I still have no idea and havent tried anything besides wintertodt.
---
---
---
So nmz is fun? Lol goodnight
---
Any messages in the message center? I can't imagine the name would be put up for someone else to take without notice in just a month of inactivity. Probably would need to contact support. Was it just a random name, or something that would indicate bot/dicing stuff, like RNG-whatever or a bunch of numbers?
---
Please do one of only konar, she's always in the backgrounds of your pictures, she needs to be at the front of one
---
Nice
---
What is bronzeman
---
It’s pretty normal in a game with zero item sinks.
---

---
The more come in the game the more it will drop in price.
---
Also for the price it’s not that much better then a blowpipe at most things it’s good for.
---
So meh.
---
The game desperately needs item sinks like 2 years ago
---
This diffused yesterday.
---
[removed]
---
Not down
---
because it was fixed years ago
---
Wait, you just stop attacking? Even if you click once every 10minutes or so?
---
yikes
---
Shit that sucks with this is he clearly clicked pray melee before the 2nd claw spec came in. Gotta love it
---
The afk method gives you like nothing compared to actually killing zulrah. Especially at lower levels.
---
Zulrah scales just change price from time to time. They've been lower before, they'll go back up eventually.
---
Lol don’t you know that runescape players are NPCs?
---
Wait until you get to do Dragon Slayer 2. Probably the most fun quest in the game in my opinion.
---
I’m a bit of a casual player can someone inform me as to what makes this update useful?
---
Pretty much just good money for f2p, the cockroaches dropped lots of rune pieces and the gloves were bis and matched ferocious boots
---
I mean you can keep a stamina in your inv regardless your just going to be doing 26 per trip
---
Check out “K exy”! It’s a good range of mid to high level players and we constantly have people doing boss trips and Skilling together!
---
This^ ask the average person how many "pushy vegans" they actually know and it's likely that that number is zero.
---
Why are there so many 2009-2011 posts recently, just give it up were in 2007 here people. 07 graphics, 07 classic map (not including new parts of the map or completing empty part of maps) 07, boss styles, 07 minigames. 
---
It’s how it is. Go kill cockroaches, play stealing creation, soul wars, dungeoneering, summoning and all that jazz on RS3 where it was made, and leave 07 in 07.
---
Check out some of torvestas latest vids. He has his build. I have a maxed pure but if i were to make a secondary account i would make this one for sure. Its very very strong
---
Mod Weath is the only person in charge of banning bots other than Tyran on RS3.
---
Mod Acorn is in community manager now, they could only afford having her in anti-cheat during mobile launch. 
---
10K players or 100K players, anti-cheating remains only 1 person
---
you two are adorable
---
Imagine putting mills into farming
---
this comment brought to you by the daily papaya/biweekly mahogany trees gang
---
Well it dropped a lot in price
---
it did the same thing to 2 of my accounts try retyping your password and relogging itll log you in but im not sure as to why the message is popping up seems like it has been happening to others as well
---
Another win for Olympus.
---
You think it’ll go back up?
---
What are these boxes? Feels like the Mueller Report all over again.
---
I got Peter’s stick. Not for sale though—it’s my favorite toy
---
Why yikes? Is it that bad?
---
He literally said he wont make a video until he has a whip. You’re going into his next video knowing that. Also with the other spoiler he calculated when he’d have it in a previous video. It was inevitable and there were no possible surprises or reason for tension.
---
I guess you could say hes settled in to his surroundings
---
Yeah but it's been a long time and I completely forgot that he said that, therefore your point is invalid.
---
Maybe I’m an idiot but what call did you guys start fighting obor? I got my ass handed to me last week ( attack 60, strength 55, defense 60) what method did you use?
---
Rn I have a dagganoth task. So my goal is to get the fremmenik elite diary to make it more profitable. I base my goals in this manner. I find and end goal and reach the goals necessary before I an reach that!
---
Can you expand on this free name change thing...?
---
Can't wait
---
Lag
---
I barely play and mainly spend my time on rs pking, over the years
---
I'm just saying. Anyone with any basic understanding of efficiency would say the exact same thing.. Lol
---
If I were you I'd start bossing
---
Uhh since you’re curious, I bring 4 restores 1 brew 1 super extended anti fire and 1 anti venom. Ruby and diamond dragon bolts with dhcb and ward. I mean I’ve got 400 kc and only did 8 once, you just can’t take any avoidable damage whatsoever and also need to get crazy good RNG on your own hits + need vork to spam 0 splats on the last few. The last one I was out of antivenom and had range pray down to 5% and managed to down him with about 20 hp left, venomed, and less than 15 prayer. It’s not efficient at all was just for fun to see how far I could extend a run. 
---
You could get 9-10 down with absolutely insane RNG with higher prayer and an extra antivenom/restore but what’s the point lol. 
---
I’ll dm you a screenshot of the loot from the trip while I was still at Vorkath if you want.
---
It's not, it's irony on OP's behalf. 
---
* Weapon: 'Black Salamander'. 
---
* Catagory: 'Salamander'
---
this is nowhere near true lmao

fucking annihilated kid

Mom said it’s my turn to repost this.
---
What are your favorite passive income methods? Currently doing birdhouses and herb runs. About to start v diary for battle staffs
---
The problem is keeping the games active, no point wasting dev time for them to end up like castle wars, trouble brewing, etc. They need to rework the rewards so its worth doing but not OP
---
&gt; especially when they’ve been running the same bot detection for how long?
---
Their detection system has changed many times over the years. And they have done a lot with their code to combat bots. I remember one time they made an update which killed all reflection based bots, which were almost all of them. And from then on bots had to rely on colour detection instead. It took forever to get good bots again. I think this was in 2010
---
Yo I remember that I thought I was tripping man
---
Lmao!! Sorey settled my man but thats the funniest shit ive seen all day.. XD..
---
&lt;3u dude keep up the grind!!
---
P.s lemme know if u want em kicked in the shin and called meanie jerk faces.. Ill do it ya know.. X)..
---
Replace trouble brewing with a ship battle minigame where you're helping pirates smuggle stuff and you get paid for it
---
Best method is to unlock ancients
---
If I got into the wild with a book of law (unholy book) and I die to a pker, my book would go to perdue or jossik to be collected again with all pages correct?
---
Wonder what his shaman kc is
---
That's why I always check hiscores before talking.
---
How long did it take?
---
i just pickpocket men lol
---
This is happening to me too. Just hit the login button again or try a different world, its to do with your connection timing out with their server during log in.
---
How exactly is Trump destroying the US?
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with that - it just be a RuneLite sided thing making them crash
---
Air battlestalves, and d'hides are you're best bet.

Lol spicy
---
replace drop option on fish to release
---
Fuck this meme format what r u twelve?
---
Yep. You can go to jossik and collect a full inventory of them any time you like. I have like 100 zamorak and ancient books in my bank
---
Add hops, they're so quick and have great yield. Obviously also farming guild contracts. Herb boxes from NMZ.
---
Honestly half the reason I did the quest was to be future lazy and not do this.
---
I said now. "forgot my chaose runes U got any"
---
guess its his turn to bank
---
Yeah not much to do besides birdhouses, herbs, and bstaves unless you count afking on alts
---
Buying petes candlesticks is useless if you dont kill grip
---
Nature runes
---
Firemaking is one of the best skills, and the reason its one of the best skills is first of all because of how much sense the skill makes and because its one of the most important skills in terms of survival, a very important aspect to basic survival - a cornerstone of the time period our character is situated in. The discovery of fire is the most important skill someone developed. Its a skill in the skill sense of a skill, you can be good at making fires or you can be not so good at making fires, so from a principle level its the skill that makes the most sense in the game, along with other skills. For survival you need food, so you need to be good at gathering food, you need to prepare the food on something, a fire, to make a fire you need to be good at making fires, to cook something on the fire you need to be a good cook. Its all tied together in a common sense system. Comparing it to door opening is retarded, opening a door requires little to no cognitive ability, making a fire is really complex. More so than cooking.

I miss stuff like this. I remember reading the news post for the release of ToG and being absolutely enthralled by the little story they posted to go with it. I know lore isn't generally the community's favorite but even just small stuff makes it so much better!
---
Gonna finish Lunar Diplomacy for the first time, then the grind for my second 99 begins once I unlock the String Amulet spell.
---
There’s been a post about this like every 15 mins today. You’re account is fine. Try logging in again some people are saying that works.
---
&gt;!I mean, it's not that surprising that he got it.  It's a 1/512 drop, even if he can only kill 1 a minute, that's like 600 kills per day the way he plays.  He's basically over 70% to get it on any given day.!&lt;
---
tried it doesnt work lmao you cant alch anything except the horn
---
I thought it was sending vials of cum to jagex for future account recovery process?
---
Mat K was supposed to be the one in charge of handling the cum vials, no wonder he bailed.
---
No. You need like 95 with rigour and dragon darts
---
Ok, so there was always a two minute grace period? Yeah I miss that system myself. I still rush back to where I died as if I only have 2 minutes before someone jacks my dragon boots.
---
I now have over 3k Vork kc without pet and that sucks!
---
But this made my day, that’s for sure!
---
Probably a bug, seems like a lot of people are too
---
I got it 2 times today... hopefully nothing to worry about
---
Happens when you dont 3t smith
---
It effects if its a hit or not specifically. Such as you can land a hit and have that hit still be 0
---
Your account email is comprised and people are trying to log in.
---
Don't you miss out on 6 minutes of 70% reduced energy depletion rate though?
---
how many times to i have to say this fuck your crab fuck you and fuck your karma farming i can just see it now you think to yourself boy i want some karma i know ill post an image of a crab on the osrs reddit yes that is what the kids like even the add is saying it someone should remove london and post osrs get out of osrs
---
Dude I cannot wait for the next video! I check everyday LOL! Looking forward to it bro!
---
I get that bots are bad and you make a little less on slayer tasks because of these price drops. But lets look at the positives, cheaper herblore levels! I personally dont mind the bots, I mean yeah its pretty insane that they can run this rampant and not get banned, but there are some positives that come out of it for normal players
---
But then you have the quest done for the clue next time + general account progression.
---
As much of an “inconvenience” reapplying the Authenticator monthly is... I’d do it every log in attempt if I had to
---
Omfg lmao neal, ya boi pingaz says hello &lt;3 and gz again on the sigil, you get my upvote and i can't wait for your vorky post ;)

What does he do in regards to banning bots that only he is capable of single handily handling all these bots. 
---
There should be a team of jmods that can do it.
---

---

---
Relatable as heck
---
Especially that spot 😐
---
Wasted a tick at the end. smh my head
---
I do not believe this is true though... to be sure, I changed every PW and added two step to my email. It appears as though other people are experiencing similar login issues based off recent r/2007scape posts.
---
And it also makes no sense that I’m able to eventually login.
---
Trust me, if you had a Twitter and talked to them, you would leave twice as disgruntled.
---
Login severs have been rough all day, it’s related to the Google server outages. Once you’re in it’s fine.
---
Nice man, gratz!

What did you use to code for that? I’m fairly proficient in Java and JavaScript, I wouldn’t mind taking a look and seeing if I could add to it. but I’m not too used to working on large scale projects

If you go to the official wiki there’s an optimal quest guide. It lists the quests in order to minimize any Skilling. It’s pretty nice I haven’t done much Skilling and I’m sitting at 1300 total right now. Questing gets boring after a bit but it’s so worth it for xp and content unlocks
---
Use the official client...

Bots still being a thing after 15+ years determined thats a lie.

Is this a low key lure to pk bot pkrs?
---
Like everyone said airplane is really helpful with 1def. I always bring Karils bow as well for the extra range, it really comes in handy without def. Blowpipe is nice for DPS and the spec though. The 45 on wave 3 spawns exactly where Jad will, and when I was grinding for the pet I would just reset if it was a shit spawn. I try to get him south east of Italy.

---
Probably knowing how to extract the ore from rocks, little differences between them that take a skilled hand to work through the rock just right to be able to get enough for an inv slot. At 99 you're just more efficient at the process.
---
I wanted to make the joke the other day that asmongold had as many people watching him stream as on osrs, and most of those are bots. Really I bet at the very very least half of osrs is bot population. Just going to f2p worlds it’s a 10:1 bot to player ratio
---
You really need 90+ mage.
---
Yo are you new to numbers
---
It’s not for everyone, but I’ve made a healthy stack of super restores and prayer pots looting the pvp and pk worlds.  But I like doing it so it’s not like a chore.  Ymmv.
---
My man.  Living your best life out here.
---
Ardy knights with medium ardougne diary for 10% bonus  or black jacking with hard ardougne diary but it's more click intensive
---
im watching somone on twitch, not using the official clien.  and he has the detail on the floors?
---
I refuse to accept these puns are funny
---
5% to 7% of players online are bots.
---
Castle Wars and the Duel Arena were my thing back in the day, I'm sad they are practically dead. I used to love funning people or testing myself to see how i stack against other levels. Now the arena is dead on almost every world and the ones that arent are just people just staking with no armor or weapons on, how dull.

Well, you finally provided me with enough clarity on the Woox-esque walking that I was actually able to do it without dying. 
---
So that's a win.
---
But then I read /u/Boner4Stoners comment in this thread and that works even better. That's my only critique really! Liked everything else! :D
---
a while back there was an update that saves attack styles across different classes of weapons, so you can keep your staff autocasting the same spell even if you switch to something else. 
---
this allows you to see what class of weapon your current one is, so you know what kinds of other weapons will share the attack style.
---
The rewards for the clay hammer in construction was pretty decent to save money. And honestly FOG was free mage xp for lower levels and cool rewards, so I really can’t see a downside to these

In this same stream he won 300m so I mean yeah. Also I don’t know why everyone else is talking so much shit on the guy. Think he’s a nice streamer and gives pretty good content. I watch him at work and end out laughing all the time, plus he does entertaining shit like risking this much in Wildy

I said it was fun? Wasn't obnoxious at all for me. First time I had trouble with a boss fight to be honest but it made beating it feel all that better.

I'd say that is China blocking you, not Jagex.

So, a few days ago I asked if the Rune Full Helm is a drop for Bryophyta.  A wiki admin said they had no data for it, but Mod Ash confirmed it was a F2P drop only.  Is there any recent clarification?
---
Haha it’s just a boss that changes attack styles every 3 hits. If you switch prayers before or after it changes styles it can hit you like 30-50 damage :P
---
no, it is used because there are no guards and the owner does not move. as well you can just drop the cups of tea which makes it easier

Yup! I did potuppure guide and airplane method. Did it with blowpipe. Guthix robes and blowpipe with karils xbow (longer dist). I got it at 67 or 69 cb i think.  I had protect from mage and range and 75 range. I also used a glory amulet. Had like a 5m bank. Totally doable for ya. Took me 3-4 tries. I planned my jad spawn which helps loads. The center spawn allows you to aggro all healers with a chin chompa and gets jad caught on the corner of a rock so  he cant melee you but is very easy to see

I guess you could say Face ID is in fact refering to apple's face identification software. In this particular case it doesnt really escuses my error in wording or lack of research on newer devices =P
---
The whole point is still the same. With newer phones one could argue that Face recognition and any kind of finger recognition could be used to unlock your bank or even log in to your account. Problem is that older devices arent secure enough to allow it
---
He’s not. I know him from an old CC I was in. The CC members called him, “barcode.”

iirc it's ticks between each attempt to mine: rune is 3 ticks, addy is 4, etc. Also might be the chance of success at each attempt but i'm not sure

"Face ID" was literally invented by Apple and is what they call their face recognition system.

You realise that people botting to 50m xp have private scripts and are a very small portion of bots (I'd guess less than 0.1%).
---
I think everybody has a story about buying somebody a ring in Runescape.

$11/$5

The guys that make scripts to get prime account sell subscriptions to other stream for a cheap rate. So they end up with accounts with only membership and no way to subscribe.

16 Yanillian hops seeds, 2 Cactus seeds (potato cactus or the other one), 6 Ultracompost, Watering can, Yanille teleport tab, glory, ring of Duelling, skills necklace, Camelot teleport, Chronicle, dibbler, magic secateurs. Optional: Protect the hops with a basket of Tomatoes (don't have to water them if so).
---
1. Tele Camelot and run to the hops patch harvest, plant etc.
---
2. Yanille hops patch
---
3. Chronicle to Champions guild hops patch
---
4. Glory to Draynor then run to Entrana (or get there any other way...) and hops patch there
---
5. Ring of duelling to do the cactus there
---
6. Skills necklace to farming guild for that cactus patch
---
Yield: Usually 80-100 hops and 20-30 Potato cactus.

Castle Wars was fucking lit back in the day. I actually still don't have any of those armor sets you can buy with tickets. If you had those back then you were a god.
---
I think Hunter as a skill is almost entirely dead content. it's my favorite skill but unless you are hunting chins it's useless. Back in the day summoning made Hunter relavant again but adding another skill I think is dangerous. But there has to be another way.
---
 I think a pet expansion would be what it needs, allowing for a rare drop of a pet for each type of creature you can potentially hunt. Allowing people that don't pvm or skill to be able to pick a creature they like specific to their tastes.

oh ok, the wiki says 750 with a runner but guess the numbers are just off. What do runners charge?

I think you are confused. There is not a jagex employee who's job is to world hop around banning bots it is an automated system. Even when they did the bot busting stream they were just going to ones the auto system had flagged.

Use the teleport to house spell (or tablet). Outside the house portal in rimmington world 330 there's tons of people with max construction advertising their houses, you can right click the house portal and type in their name to visit their house. You can either Tele inside your house and leave, or right click and Tele outside your house, or spend the 5 seconds to set up your options to Tele outside by default. I basically always play on world 330 because having a max house is so useful but I cba getting 83 con

Well at least hackers will have a hard time to steal your saplings if they can't note them

You'll hate me for this, but it's not their job to go around muting people just because you don't like how they express themselves... Regardless of how toxic they are. They are normal players who jagex chose to represent everything that is good (relative) of the playerbase, sure they can mute here and there every once in a while... But that's not why they got that rank in the first place. Imo, should've just reported the guy, and you could probably fill a police claim agaisnt that guy... After all he's threatening you with real life threats.

Yes. I'd take this art over any crap OrogonXYZ or Zuharr posts.

Yes you can, I recommend getting obsidian armour plus berserker neck if you can afford it you can do the super combat method and afk upwards to 30 min at a time if you go to the normal rumble mode instead of hard, you don't get as much xp as dharok of course but it's still pretty good xp especially if you have the necklace.

it doesn't avg 80 tf. max hit is like 40x2. it averages 40 assuming 100% accuracy.

so a good bit of luck, but like thats what u need for every rs kill

Where is varrok
---
Well of good will was a good item sink. Sunk away trillions of GP. But the issue was, Jagex had to pay like $1 for every bill it gathered or something. So they stopped doing it.

Str bonus doesn’t affect accuracy, only max hit

I configured the osrs wiki search engine on my browser with the keyword "osrs" so when I type in "osrs stuff" it direktly searches on the wiki for stuff and opens the page for it if it finds a match. "Osrs kq" for example leads directly to kalphite queens page.

What kind of stats should I aim for before trying KQ?

Runescape was a big part of my childhood, and I've had a blast playing Fortnite
---
There was an era where mobile games were just *pure* aids and the big introduction to gaming a lot of kids had. Freemium trash designed to sap your wallet.
---
I've got to be honest; Fortnite is kind of an amazing game to grow up with. In a similar vein, Minecraft as well.
---
It actually involves playing with friends, improving at the game, new parts of it allow creativity and making new gamemodes- it's genuinely fun with quite a legitimate "fundmantal" game at its core with its unique building mechanic.
---
I mean, I'm the type of person who loves "shooters" with high mobility and mastery. Fortnite is like an easier to access GunZ.

you mean you don't know? lol git gud. downvoted you btw pleb.
---
Oh no
---
It's a weird question, because hypothetically if they have 100% accuracy within 4 hits, then their accuracy would be so high that they would be almost guaranteed to hit on the first damage roll, and get the 100-200% damage range, making it a 120 average from 2 hits.
---
I did program a quick dps calculator for claws a while back though, so I mean I could take a more reasonable number and calculate the odds. If you have 70% accuracy, then a claw spec would be a 99.19% chance that you hit within the 4 hit rolls. In this case the average from 2 claw specials would be 110, so still very high.
---
It's ok. You can make up for it by reaching base 80 before 2K total :).

They added control-flow obfuscation to the client and the lower-quality clients took forever to reverse-engineer it. Nowadays it's ineffective due to much more information and tools related to deobfuscation. As far as current bot detection, they constantly change little things (like quest dialogues) to break bots.
---
Big props for not blacking out your name
---
Why bot when you could leech with no risk of a ban
---
No /s/, max mage is pretty op and will hit consistently even against black d'hide. Or even bringing a toxic staff of the dead and an occult. These noobs will run around in xericans and an ahrims staff and complain they arent hitting.

If you own the hardware, you control the game. Color bots could just read output from the monitor and add input directly through USB/PS2. Standard bots could just read the game's memory using DMA. It would help a little bit, but would turn people off from playing.

blessed helm/top/legs, barrows gloves (or best u have unlocked that beats vambs), dragon skirt switch to tank rangers later waves, archers ring/ring of suffering/ring of gods/explorers ring(1-4) whatev u can afford, peaceful blessing on ammo slot for +1 pray bonus (or rada's blessing)

realistically you'll be camping overhead mage pray on later waves so bringing neitiznot helm for+3pray bonus instead of blessed coif +1 pray bonus is more beneficial

komodo dragons have a breathing tube they can slip out the side of their mouth like a snorkel when their mouth is filled up with a goat corpse or some shit

Up to you really. Like you said, iron is faster xp. But mlm is more afk, just depends on which you value more. Personally I plan on doing mlm when I finally finish off 99.
---
The d long is in his pants
---
time to go to sleep
---
You get 30 days of membership for each one. Botters are getting them for around 500k each.
---
Really just depends on if you want to AFK or not.
---
If going with MLM, you'd be better off selling prospector for upper level access then saving up for prospector again.
---
If AFKing isn't a priority, then iron. You might also wanna check out other methods, as there are plenty of things that give more XP/h and/or GP/h than iron (Iron caps out around 75-80k/h, blast mining can get 75k xp/h while making decent profit, volcanic mine can hit 75-90k/h, and 3t granite can get up to 135k xp/h).

No it isn’t, look at the account.

It's less of an aid for speed.  If you're supposed to be in mage gear but there's still a blue item in your inventory, it's obvious even in peripheral vision and easily fixed. I also find it useful in raids where my items tend to get a bit jumbled, though that's probably more of a crutch for a poor inventory setup

Or just sit on an actual bond?

I wouldn't worry about Dharok's till you're at least 90+ hp
---
Prices would start to rise for a lot of common items. For example, log prices would probably shoot up.
---
And what is cheaper, 2x Bond or 1 membership ?
---
Everything would go up in price I believe, this could be beneficial for f2p players as they could afford a bond more easily. Skilling could compete with pvming when it comes to money making. Every niche of the game would be revitalised.
---
prices of all the botted items would skyrocket and the wilderness would be even more dead than it is

Just buy members

All the programming experts coming out in force to call you a cunt OP, what a surprise. Sure an automated system does most of it, kind of like cameras at a school to stop kids smoking. Hiring two more people to hop to the popular betting areas and adding jmod functions to just mass ban everyone infront of you would go a much longer way than people think. Like the emblem farmers for example you would ban thousands a day with relatively little effort and could hire people without a degree to do shit like that.

He probably has bank presets and public turned off, or he just doesn't care to respond to you, maybe he's watching a tv show or movie :p
---
One of the better tank shields in the game.
---
A separate game instance wont fix the bot problem..
---
70 is just under a mil. I doubt you could get 15 mil theiving exp from one day at master farmers. As the guy said it’s not hard for them to create a new account each day. They literally create accounts, bot the unbanned ones, replace the banned ones and repeat.
---
Are you me? I got that clue a week ago or so. I was at 74 at the time. I'm 79 now. 
---
Two more hateful levels...
---
Yes
---
Kolodion will hold on to any item you give him, regardless of if you log out, or do something else for a week. So, no, you don't need to do it in one session.
---
You can indeed 3 item to find the next demon, just remember that you might get unlucky when they switch spawnpoints as you're running back.
---
Most people just being 3 expensive magic gear items, like a staff of the dead/light for autocasting the Sara and zammy one, an occult for damage, and something else of your choosing. The rest of your slots can be mystic or xeric's robes.
---
you're embarrassing yourself, just stop.
---
When it will be released, any clues?
---
The enchantment one is annoying as fuck without runelite
---
A separate game instance where high end identified accounts are allowed. It fixes bots. Only issue is trust with Jagex with your personal details and a clean slate (we couldn't carry over osrs account stats and items).
---
He has multiple 99's and probably plays with public off.
---
Range easily.
---
I've done that quest 3 times, took more than one inventory once. All with 53 thieving
---
You can't alch the keys, there price shown is to easy identify the key on the ground.
---
Having two extra people to have a  9-5 job hopping to community scouted botting areas (wildly emblem farming for example) would be miles more efficient than automated systems, especially jagex current ones. When my account was hacked and botted for zulrah, it done over 150 kills and hauled 26m from it. It wouldn't have even gotten banned if the system didnt flag it from me trying to recover it, it's a joke. Two guys going about manually banning these farms wouldn't get rid of them for sure, but it would absolutely decimate them and seriously hinder their operation and do wonders for the economy. Systems are easy to work around if your a half decent bot scriptor. Fooling humans is far harder, and with the full force of the community behind you along with people like pugger who majorly popularise these spots, you can do some major damage, you could easily near double the ban rate most likely.
---
If you do it the manual way maybe. I just grabbed dragonstones, enchanted them, then world hopped.
---
Just take the 50 dmg like a man
---
Yeah now imagine a botter going through all that trouble. But yeah, phone sims are cheap. A picture of your identification card/driving license, university/school vetted emails are better.
---
queue Pillarmen theme
---
That was the first master clue I got as well. Sat in my bank for ages and I tried, but could never bring myself to do Wintertodt that much. Ended up dropping it. 
---
This was like, 9 months ago. Still haven't gotten 85 FM lol.
---
Fire-resting would help give pyromaniacs some perks for practicing their craft, just sayin'
---
Lol I'm embracing it
---
Glad you're doing alright, random stranger. There's definitely something about this game that keeps me going too. Through the good and the bad, this game has been one of the only constants in my life and I don't think I'd be wrong in saying it's had a positive impact on my life.
---
Keep looking upwards.

Aww :( 300kc and only an onyx but the best thing for me is, i can use this amazing place called the GE to sell all the other stuff.

i could be wrong but i think it's because 97 ate nine

And?

&gt;is there any word  
---

---
i love u
---
I love you both
---
I think it's so people dont immediately associate them with overloads
---
Ardy knights require zero attention. You can watch shows easily. So while you need to constantly click, its stil lafk in the sense of runescape cause you can put 100% of your attention on a show or stream or something. So yes, thieving is afk as fuck.
---
Looks like someone needs his behelit.
---
Would prefer ash
---
The fact that you care... just wow
---
How have you been playing for a few months and your account is still so trash? And only 3.5m? Do you play like 5 mins per day?
---
Oh dayum...
---
Knights are better xp than pp until, 91 where pp becomes just barely faster. Pp is never 2x knight lmao, knights are 250k per hour at 95+ and 200k+ from 85ish.
---
Is there some special equation ?
---
Ok thanks :)
---
I am more aware of the scale of the situation than you might expect bud. I have a degree in computer science with my honours in AI. Particularly the design of AI for mimicking human behaviour with relation to video games. 
---
One human scrolling through all the worlds (without log in time obviously, because jmod) in the wildy can ban a bot farm of 400 emblem farmers MILES faster than any automated system can. An automated system needs repeated updates to compete with hundreds of farmers writing independent scripts designed to fool a scripted system. Bot farmers would stop making profits to economy breaking levels because they would be getting banned far more frequently all for much less cost an effort of making an equally robust system.
---
I'm by no means saying the system isn't needed, but dont try and pretend you know a fucking thing that your talking about, unlike yourself I tend not to comment on shit unless I actually know enough about it to make a meaningful comment when someone is talking shite.
---
Absolutely. They average around 100k and you can get like 270k chests. Never alch them.
---
This is hideous. Also why is he holding the halberd like that?? Did you draw an autistic person?
---
The funniest part about this is that you can actually get the pet when this happens. The pet drop is rolled when jad dies not when you get out of the cave.
---
There was a guy who died on jad, didn't get his cape but got the pet.
---
Chasm of fire has a safespot you can set cannon up in the middle and avoid contact so it gets multi in a single way area
---
Oké, didn't know the alch price is just to see the keys. Thanks for the info. Opened a few and got some cash so thanks
---
6.99 x 2 
---
or 
---
11.00.
---
Which is cheaper?
---
On a somewhat related note, is there currently any use for a white lily flower? Someone has been buying them for 2500gp each and I can't figure out why.
---
No problem dude, what do you feed that guy to make him red anyway? A ruby or something?
---
If you're on a VPN or maybe dynamic IP. If your IP changes, it's gunna ask for it.
---
Link?

OwO
---
Jagex are the people selling the gold, if they ban the gold buyers they lose money, they only ban the gold sellers

And his 40m worth of teleports
---
Very cool!
---
Well, even without the height map - That'd give proficient builders a ground level to work from with a scale. If you managed to take it further and created the whole map into a flat terrain (exactly like how it is now) it'd give them the exact scale you need to build the rest by hand/worldedit tools.
---
If you ever managed to get me an entire world of it I'd definitely get to work with a few of my old Minecraft buddies.
---
(Used to be part on an official build team for a high-end server)
---
Then just slap MCMMO plugin on a server with respawning trees/ores and you're set to play RS in MC! MC even has campfires atm too! Damn this is close to possible.

10 Year old me spent 2 weeks on dragon slayer  because I was so bad at making money lol. Good times
---
And how?
---
This is particularly bad this is like pre-first bot nuke bad
---
bots outsmart jagex
---
Lol are people really that lazy to make a new email address an start a prime trial? You can get it for free if you do this, I've done it multiple times. Not to play RS however, to order things I need asap

Yep. I love how this one single screenshot is such a good representation of the average 07scape player; max melee, not even 92 (halfway) slayer, ONE single non-combat 99, embarassingly low rc level, 1853 total. Nice.
---
So many people are going to feel personally attacked by this comment.
---
People are actually trying to pin the NZ shooting on trump?
---
I thought that was a meme jokingly perpetuated by trump supporters.
---
I know there is an optimal setup, but it usually includes the rfd and dt bosses as they help increase points significantly, I just cant seem to get the rates other people always talk about.
---
You used to be able to boost and then do a quest that gave Herblore experience to level without completing Druidic Ritual but Jagex fixed that awhile ago
---
Twitch prime costs money, no?

Make a pure first, when you get bored of that increase the attack lvl or go 13/42/45 def etc
---
Ok, cheers
---
I think they only nerfed the spec against other players
---
Dorgesh-kaan rich chests swapping between mobile and desktop is like 260k+ an hour starting at 78. I did that until 91 for the best PP rate, saved a ton of time.
---
How can you not rememer 6 didgits for 10 seconds? You might be disabled man.
---
Staminas will literally never have an impactful cost. I don't see how this is "wasting" them - on a main account the cost is literally irrelevant, and on my ironman I have over 30k 4 dose stams, and really struggle to find places to use enough of them.

I JUST completed MLM Friday. Took me all week. I hate it so much...
---
Oh lmao
---
Sure, but saying they do little to nothing to stop botting is fucking stupid. Of course they care about other people making tons of money from their property. Thinking that they don't care about botting is ridiculous.
---
Should have told him that UIM is more difficult than HCIM.

Hahaha, getting the anchor brother?

A more useful way of doing this is using binomial distribution.  It can be applied to more complex questions such as "what are the odds of getting 3 zenytes in 250 kills?"

10th, huh? Let me guess... 7 of them are combat.

On a scale from 1 to *Monkey Madness 2*, how would you rate the difficulty of agility obstacles (if they are any)? And on the same scale, how would you rate the difficulty of the boss fights (if they are any)?  
---
I'm about to get my Quest Cape and now I'm getting PTSD from MM2 and MEP2...

Nah, you get a code which you redeem for your account IIRC

---
It’s pretty obvious that’s not what he was doing, which is why you use the word “categorized”. You’re just trying to get vengeance on this guy who doesn’t actually owe you anything.

Im curious why you would need more than one
---
2 things:
---
Any response from the clientside code is falsified to make it feel quicker and more responsive than it actually is; the server only receives information based on the game's tick system (every 0.6 seconds). If there's a delay as small as you are mentioning, it is based on the person's computer - not the server communicating.
---
Secondly, as some people below have suggested might be the case, the check is only actually done once all numbers have been submitted. Not after each number entered.
---
I’ll actually be able to catch it then! see you there
---
See my comment, I scanned it on virus total.

That looks pretty brutal if true. I'm typically pretty careful with downloads and links, but I guess it could be a RAT if I slipped up somewhere!

Upload it to any.run too. I'll PM you tomorrow.

knew this was too retarded to be true

If you know if a digit of the pin is correct it means it is trivial to guess the entire pin without hitting the 3 attempt timeout by repeatadly guessing the first character until you find it, then guessing the second character and then 3rd etc.
---
Thanks for verifying our account is not in danger!
---
Lance, dfs, torture, b ring, b gloves, netz, ardy cloak 4, climbing boots, prossy top, prossy legs.  this is a lot easier and more afk vs the t bow method.  maybe 1-2 less kills/hr but its VERY low maintenance.

If you get pked with it, you lose it and you have to run to ava to get a new one. Just super annoying and I don't see the point
---
Wow if that's true I'm really disappointed in Jagex. There have been numerous hints throughout the years that there's a way to bypass bank pins in OSRS, but to think it was that simple is baffling. This kind of breach is something they could easily have prevented had they looked at the code for bank pin verification for 10 minutes.
---
The thing is, I'm smart enough to look at this picture and realize this is ridiculous, but I'm dumb enough that I could see myself clicking on the blue link because I do it all the time on reddit without thinking.
---
Ok next question why are you taking it into the wildy?
---
Noted. Thanks!!
---
Sooner or later the sentient google algorithm will auto fill osrs related inquiries because you search it a lot. So it doesn’t matter after a bit
---
That's a neat fact thank you.
---
Yeah honestly with the demand for stealing accounts and items and gold that this game sees, this would have shown itself a long time ago if it were a problem.
---
Thanks Wolf

When you literally have all your gp invested in slayer equipment and supplies  trying to earn better equipment to do raids, it immediately shouts to trolls of being capable of merching. When you have support from the mods and people in-game giving constructive feedback and support for needed improvements, trolls immediately move to downvote and ridicule ideas they don't like. Nice
---
Runescape was incredible for me as a kid, more than even the gameplay it was just so raw and offered insight into the real world. Don’t follow that player To the north who says he is having a drop party and get killed in the wilderness. Be sure to check your trade windows to not get scammed. Learn to type faster to actually be able to spam sell something. Hey did you know metal is made from other more basic minerals? Also if you want anything in this game you got to work for, so sit down and buckle up.

I'm not going to say I wouldn't enjoy it being buffed, but I don't feel like it is needed. The prayer bonus and small offensive increase is plenty enough to turn it into a BIS for certain bosses, raids, and PVP builds. I felt as if the diary/PC points were well worth it.
---
I two enjoy combining to of my too favorite things.

All are insanely strong buffs that would make them overpowered.

Well he did take that trip to Varrok/the sawmill too. Account ruined ^^^/s

Yeah, not to go all tin foil hat, but OP needs to explain how they got to their conclusions... why would a JMod admit that this was true? Of course they would want to hide this if it were. Right now, I honestly can’t really believe anyone until I see data—not someone’s word on the situation

I don't like fortnite simply because it's too fast paced and I don't like PvP or shooting games so it's everything I don't like in a game. I'm not a fan of the entire genre of BRs but fortnite is the easiest to poke fun at

The fact that it's already used in a lot of high level content shows it's fine where it is.  Making it better would make already lucrative money makers (ie vorkath) more ridiculous.

Love this redesign and the suggestions you provided! Aesthetically, big fan of your recolored Arc house, it still stands out in contrast to Pisc, but not nearly as jarring. The small quests are something that are certainly missing from Zeah and are fun little ways to flesh out the lore of a given region. Any of the small quests you provided would fit in well with established lore and have that old school 'feel'. Overall, gentletractor/10 and I would love to explore this ingame.

Hi. I know a little about infosec and triage because... reasons. Unfortunately, depending on the malware’s wrapper, rootkit, and obfuscation methodology, simple signature detection might not work. Your best bet is to start over. I would recommend the following steps to securely clean your computer while also saving files. This method is completely free apart from the two flash drives you may need to purchase if you don’t have any available... also you will need another computer that has internet access.
---
1. Get a large USB flash drive (32gb or larger depending on how many files you want to save) and a smaller flash drive that you can turn into a windows installation drive.
---
2. On a separate computer, download Paladin Linux distro (it’s a forensic triage tool) and the tools required to create a Paladin bootable drive. Don’t worry, when you get Paladin you are also provided detailed instructions on how to make a paladin drive. Also download Windows Media Creation tool.
---
3. On the larger USB flash drive, install Paladin and only allocate whatever the minimum amount of required space is to the partitions used by Paladin. Use the Windows Media Creation Tool to turn the smaller flash drive into a Windows bootable drive.
---
4. With the left over unallocated drive space on the Paladin USB, create a FAT32 or EXFAT partition that takes up the rest of the flash drive’s available space. You will save your important personal files here.
---
5. Once your Paladin drive is ready to go, boot up your pc and change the boot order in BIOS so that flash media are first.
---
6. Restart your pc and boot into Paladin. Don’t boot into the forensic mode because that will make saving files difficult.
---
7. Since Paladin is a Linux distro, Windows malware will not be able to run and will be forced to lay dormant. Mount your computer’s NTFS drives so that you can access them and then copy your most important files to the large partition on the Paladin bootable USB. Only copy the essentials (family pictures, tax or personal documents, movie files, homework... anything important that isn’t a .dll or .exe)
---
8. Once you have rescued the important stuff, use Paladin’s wiping functionality within Disk Manager to overwrite each sector on your computer’s drives. This will irreversibly destroy all of the data and will even wipe out the MBR and any drive slack data that might be hiding malware remnants. Make sure to allow it to verify that the wipe was completed.
---
9. Use the Windows bootable drive that you made to re-format your computer’s internal drive’s and use it to re-install Windows.

Thanks for the account bro.
---
1.	⁠Get a large USB flash drive (32gb or larger depending on how many files you want to save) and a smaller flash drive that you can turn into a windows installation drive.
---
2.	⁠On a separate computer, download Paladin Linux distro (it’s a forensic triage tool) and the tools required to create a Paladin bootable drive. Don’t worry, when you get Paladin you are also provided detailed instructions on how to make a paladin drive. Also download Windows Media Creation tool.
---
3.	⁠On the larger USB flash drive, install Paladin and only allocate whatever the minimum amount of required space is to the partitions used by Paladin. Use the Windows Media Creation Tool to turn the smaller flash drive into a Windows bootable drive.
---
4.	⁠With the left over unallocated drive space on the Paladin USB, create a FAT32 or EXFAT partition that takes up the rest of the flash drive’s available space. You will save your important personal files here.
---
5.	⁠Once your Paladin drive is ready to go, boot up your pc and change the boot order in BIOS so that flash media are first.
---
6.	⁠Restart your pc and boot into Paladin. Don’t boot into the forensic mode because that will make saving files difficult.
---
7.	⁠Since Paladin is a Linux distro, Windows malware will not be able to run and will be forced to lay dormant. Mount your computer’s NTFS drives so that you can access them and then copy your most important files to the large partition on the Paladin bootable USB. Only copy the essentials (family pictures, tax or personal documents, movie files, homework... anything important that isn’t a .dll or .exe)
---
8.	⁠Once you have rescued the important stuff, use Paladin’s wiping functionality within Disk Manager to overwrite each sector on your computer’s drives. This will irreversibly destroy all of the data and will even wipe out the MBR and any drive slack data that might be hiding malware remnants. Make sure to allow it to verify that the wipe was completed.
---
9.	⁠Use the Windows bootable drive that you made to re-format your computer’s internal drive’s and use it to re-install Windows.
---
10.	⁠Plug in the Paladin flash drive to your windows machine and copy out all the files you saved to the larger EXFAT/FAT32 partition.
---
11.	⁠Enjoy your squeaky clean PC and don’t download anymore RATS (:

Every game they’ve ever made has went up in flames instantly and been shut down. They’ve pissed away millions on failed ventures.
---
OSRS is their only good game. The only reason OSRS is successful is because it was literally a redo after ruining RS3 and they let the playerbase decide all the updates so they can’t screw it up too much with their incompetence (but still manage to do sometimes).
---
In the hands of any other developer osrs wouldn’t have to exist because EoC wouldn’t have happened or would have been done properly from the start and the main game would still be huge.
---
Honestly the only reason Jagex has survived is because Runescape is just such an incredible and unique concept (thanks to the gowers) that it has been able to outlast all of Jagex’s meddling and fuck ups. They’ve proven that on their own they can’t function with all their failed start-ups.
---
Also off the top of my head bonus suckage:
---
-They’ve had corrupt staff members rip them and customers off.
---
-They have horrible customer support.
---
-They can’t get prizes out to contest winners (honestly pathetically sad)
---
-They horribly underpay their staff
---
-They’ve ignored and shafted the Rs3 community for years
---
This is just the tip of the iceberg
---
You'd be surprised

Yikes

Hey guys someone just hacked my account, I’ve been playing for like 30 years and never broke the rules once (except for all the times I RWT bc this game is boring af), I have mcafee installed so I dunno how this happened, jmod please help
---
It's literally the twitch prime.  Fungus is down over 20%, i'm investing heavily knowing damn well once that deal ends, it will rebound like it always does and i'll make like 20m.
---
I’ve always been somebody who likes to actually train and make money along the way. There are certainly things you can do that doesn’t really train your stats as well....merching and collecting things I guess. 
---
I would honestly get slayer up. Bring some potions with you, doesn’t have to be the most expensive ones. Get that farming up to start herb runs which is a consistent income if you do them multiple times a day.
---
You’re skilling stats are pretty good for your level so pick a few to grind. Fishing/wc/mining....it’s not a lot but it’ll add up in the end for sure.
---
OSRS is all about the grind, find some friends and enjoy the shit out of it lol.
---
Wow, just wanted to post a moment that i thought was funny...
---
Huh?
---
Agreed, that's the way to do it :)
---
You can make unfinished ranarr potions, it's not super fun tho and you don't get any xp, but you can make up to 600k/hr
---
pretty sure the right one is bull penis

Babysat bots can last a long ass time, with proper scripts, you can pretty much bot without bans

Meh. Void mage could do with a small buff and maybe give melee a very slight buff just so there is actually a difference between regular and elite. Maybe 1-2% more accuracy and damage but nothing more. Other than that it's fine.

---
Do you realise that it does not matter what was said before hand by any party involved, the entire purpose of Jagex enlisting Pmods is to handle their local chats. Real life threats are a violation of the rules and warrant a mute. If you don't wish to moderate the player chat, don't accept the player moderator position.
---
People just have to look at the video of the paralyzed guy completing it to know it's very possible heh.

If I had to guess it's due to the huge increase in bots fingerblasting the master farmer in draynor.

It’s been confirmed not true.

---
not at all. if you sit down and make at least an inventory of pendants, your craft time per each pendant is 1 tick. you save about 5-6 ticks each time you use the pendant which has something like 5 charges. why say things when you don't put in the effort to even mentally evaluate if they make sense or not? beyond me.
---
Do you honestly think doing under 3 hours of tob a day isn’t trivial?

I'm in BK, and would definitely be down

you realize enchantment spells are 1 tick.

I have a username on OSRS I've never used on anything else so unless my account was compromised from a 3rd party client I don't think they'd know my email. I also have authenticator and 2FA on my login and contact email.

Pay for 3 months, knock out as many quests as you can, you'll gain the levels and unlocks to make big money fairly quickly
---
If you want to make a bond, things will a Horrible slog:
---
1. Learn to flip
---
2. Make emerald rings
---
3. Cut yews
---
If you can't or don't want to do the 30-50 hours of work to make a bond using these methods. Take my advice above. Pay for a short term, knock out quests fast and make money after you've unlocked a huge amount of options that can be worth well over a mill an hour.
---
Disclaimer: 
---
yes I know there are other f2p methods, I just think they are even more time consuming
---
The reason I say spend a little real money up front is, the time you spend you will never get back. From an experienced player to a newbie, don't waste time trying to make money when there are more important things to get. Unlocks, untradeables, new areas, and achievement diaries. Money is great but like some others are saying it comes with time.
---
You can build a tip jar in your house. Sometimes users will donate money to you as a thank you for hosting for them

1700 were wasted anyway lmao it's a video game.  the only way it wouldn't b a waste is if u had fun. otherwise every hour playing games is a waste because u get nothing back for it tangibly
---
If you're reporting all of them then I doubt you're helping at all. Most don't use autoclickers since you only need to press once every 20min.

haha gz neal !! steve here from runescape haha!

Guess it all depends on who you believe but according to [this mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5j8zpi/how_accurate_is_this_are_there_really_this_many/dbee3hv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) the majority of them don't even get off tutorial island before getting banned. That and unless I'm in draynor village I don't find it the case to be that 50% of others are bots.

Make RuneScape innately fun, and watch how quickly gold farming disappears. We don't buy gold because we like watching you guys suffer, we buy gold because sitting at a pixel tree for 249 hrs is not a proper use of our time. One hour of my labor can buy me hundreds of Mills of GP.  Why wouldn't I? This is going to get downvoted, but ignoring the reality won't fix anything. There are many people like me that have played for 15+years, and would rather enjoy high end content rather than grind.
---
Jesus fuck Jagex, can you PLEASE take some action
---
Yes, I agree, but I still think that Jagex could show investors that it's better for profit to ban bots. They don't even have to know it's a game just that it will increase profits.
---
Who let the Falador White Knights in!
---
ironman unfortunately :/
---
Bro what are you even saying. Yes it technically is a “waste of time” either way defending on how you see it but no need to be so nihilistic just full dog head to the philosophy subreddit or some shit... I still have the right to be upset about issues beyond my control that jeopardize something I have ~wasted~ countless hours and subscription payments (p2p) on.
---
American Football is like 100 years old and Tom Brady still cheats
---
Yes but do those reports actually do anything? I report actual bots all the time and nothing seems to happen to them.
---
Just unbelievable.
---
It was awesome! I hope someone shares it so everyone can use it!
---
What would he be reporting people for?? Hurt feelings?
---
But that's it, *would* banning all these bots actually increase *short term* profit?
---
your naive if you think really completely immune to being hacked. Your the prime example of ignorance is bliss.
---
You think people that don’t advertise their house in general chat will get any visitors?
---
Wow!!!!
---
Dude just mute them yourself?
---
Yes!!!!
---
Why is this an argument? Who gives a fuck if they're hacking a 1b account or a 10b either one you'd be lucky to have
---
Yeah the mods comment explicitly says 42k bots so once again not sure where you are getting your random fake numbers from. I love that you take the effort to provide sources that prove you wrong it really speeds things up.
---
You don't need 100m in gear...
---
Irons do it in mystic and ibans blast, rune cbow etc.
---
Sure if you want to be super max efficiency guy  but if you're just looking to have fun....
---
Like where did this start? Raids arnt that impossibly hard. They're really easy actually.
---
Get your total level up already and go to 1500 world
---
After the Jed drama anything is possible.
---
It would get fewer people to stop playing as it would be less annoying in the early levels as that is where most bots are causing problems.
---
There are a severe lack of hosts in osrs so yes I do. There are still times during the week where there is no hosts for periods of time.

I was using xgrace today haha

If I say I'll give you a tbow for responding to this comment will you make another reddit post?

Shut up it's social even if you have the level
---
Imagine storing secatuers in your bank in 2019
---
Id buy this.
---
i used rune cb with ruby and diamond bolts and it worked fine. but other tactics helped like having run turned off and clicking on the ground (will stop your attack but not move since youre frozen) when he summons the spawn so you can get your next attack tick for crumble undead on it before it reaches you.

Because op said that they were one of the most profitable accounts to recover, when in reality they absolutely aren’t close.

Muting one person every half hour must be a terrible blight
---
But then you wouldn't get membership from bots. I honestly don't know which would be more profitable. I don't have all those numbers. You know who does? Jagex and the investors. If it would be more profitable to investors to stop bots, you can bet they would've made that one of their top priorities. Clearly, it's more profitable in the short term to leave them. If it wasn't, you can bet investors would've already made sure the problem was handled.
---
Cool suggestion that took a lot of work. Would need some filtering and trimming, but I enjoyed reading it.
---
What are they even reporting for? Hosting doesn't break rules
---
Tripolcoxki
---
They also set up auto typer bots to shit on other hosts.
---
Yknow instead of advertising their house they use the bot to shit on someone by saying stuff like "x host does x thing"
---
In reality most people are just seeing the host's name and are gonna try to join the house if the person they're trying to "shit on"
---

---
No it doesn't.
---
\&gt;I love that you take the effort to provide sources that prove you wrong it really speeds things up.
---
I told you where I got my source on the bot bans and you conveniently ignored it, hmm.
---
Is the puzzles in this quest just as bad as all the other elf quest puzzles?
---
I don't think banning bots is an as easy solution as this subreddit thinks. People make a lot of money making bots will always game the system. 
---
And making content will always be priority #1 as that makes people resub and creates "hype" around the game.
---
Yes stuff happen, because the bot didn't get banned right away doesn't mean they're not banning.
---
Jagex bans over 100k bots a week
---
I grew up with neither so idk what to say. Both games are fun.
---
On f2p pvp worlds the Lumbridge bank chest is like 6 tiles from a water source, so bots are constantly filling buckets/vials there.
---
It's actually 0.0 seconds, because it's possible for the weeds to regrow on the same tick you finish harvesting the crop.
---
All the top skillers have money making alts,  and a lot of them like to do rune dragons because it's so afk.

Ignore lists can only hold so many :/

How could I be ignoring it if I am pointing out how wrong you are about the info? Please take half a second to reread your source this time

Across osrs the average player has under 10k bank value. Using your logic any account over 100k bank value is in the top 10%, pretty stupid argument honestly.

If your stats are 50, you do mort myre fungus, or wilderness slayer (until higher level for better tasks), pick up whiteberries, there's so many no-requirement moneymaking methods in p2p that are at least decent at 300-500k an hr, it's just f2p that sucks ass since bots make everything worthless
---
I'm not rich by any stretch. I'm also not oblivious to the fact that making money is trivial, while most people on this sub seem to be.
---
I do, and I never said the waves weren’t hard too. The thing I meant is that for me personally the hard part was zuk (especially the healer part), and at zuk justiciar changes nothing.
---
the real reason to use go there. for any hosts listening, give me a short name I can type easily with just a left hand
---
I think the issue was ultracompost being nulified and getting less than 6 per patch, which should be impossible. So unless your getting less than 6 per patch its probably not bugged. 
---
BTW 10 average per patch is quite high...
---
They actually did this back in the day. Then the GE was born.

For a first caper would you recommend to bring ahrims top/anc bottom or opt for bcp/anc bottom combo. 
---
I understand bcp might be facetanking some waves, but is it better or does ahrims top actually make a difference
---
What a top class brainlet response, half the shit we have now in OSRS was NOT there in actual 2007. Smfh.

likely will never be unbanned due to the value of the account name alone

You're so thick I should've probably written: You are wrong because the dragon claw special attack will not always hit on the first two attacks.

If you consistently do tob you will reliably get large amounts of money. There is no guarantee that someone visiting your house will leave a generous donation, as people who have a significant amount of money are much more likely to train prayer in their own house, or even pay a runner.

Where do you make that much at PvM? Just raids? Vorki and even Demonic Gorllias aren't giving that much. Genuinely asking
---
Hey I have a question about utalizing log outs to study the waves.  I'm aware that logging out prior to the next wave spawning will pause the your current wave after completion, and then re logging will resume the following wave.   However, I'm curious on how you know the next wave without seeing it first?  I'm able to decipher what monsters the next wave will have, however how can I tell where each monster will spawn using log outs?  Am I suppose to instantly log when I see the wave and memorize where they all spawn and re log and then attempt the wave? This is great advice I just feel like I'm missing an obvious key peice!
---
Having an alt is probably the biggest overlooked thing. Game has a ton of low effort things to do to level up passively. I think peak level alt is a rune dragon alt, which is around 1m an hour, and having that passively, shit adds up a ton on top of doing things on the main.
---
Bruce Willis was dead the whole time
---
Doing sand crabs?

And quest points.

So you're saying that you can rely on a person giving a massive donation? That's laughable at best.

KBD if you want the trill of being in wildy.
---
So it's basically your password to life? What kind of a stupid ass system is that? In the UK we use something called a national insurance number but it's not all that useful, and any loan or government system requires photographic ID and often a recently dated bill with your address on it. Even that isn't very secure imo but it's gotta be better than being assigned a password at birth and not being able to change it...
---
They're against the rules now but yah I'm sure they exist.
---
I wonder if they are getting free week membership from somewhere
---
Make bank but its pretty dangerous i've heard some wild stories.
---
Vorkath is immune to all damage when he freezes you until you kill his spawn. However, you can still ruby bolt specs when youre frozen, which usually hits a 100 and saps your hp by like 10%, but instead hits a 0, still hits you for 6-9, and makes you feelbad...
---
You negate this by eating/moving off the dragon when you get frozen
---
Pajeet pajeet stay away from my street
---
I just cant get over how it costs 100k per death. I wouldnt mind grinding out/learning Vorkath but each death really adds up especially if you dont have much gp to begin with. But I guess that's the price of learning
---
A host who whines all day and just shit’s on every guest in his house.

they allow money transfer through accounts, like asking someone in rs3 to give u osrs money

The guy a total savage. Didnt he get his phat from killing someone and putting it on? Alpha move
---
Damn, this is strangely comforting to read. Thank you for the understanding response, it means a good deal. 
---
Live on, brother.
---
Ez 10M right there bro
---
Make money for bond and train in p2p with wild altar and d bones
---
whats your deal lol
---
Gargoyle bots
---
source?
---
Best way is probably just doing it. Got my first kc last night with friends who all have 0 experience and no amount of videos adequately prepared me for Olm
---
You can’t be serious lol.
---
I'm clueless.. is DHCB better than ACB here?
---
imagine mocking somebody for being able to do inferno. Yikes
---
Bots ruining runescape? Boy, times never change do they.
---
Naw, that should be another option to the Digsite Pendant
---
No members items don’t even work in f2p :(
---
Send bobs and vagene
---
I just see stars, you're good man. By the way do you have a favorite 4 digit number?
---
I was a General in Altars chat back in 2009-2012 era and I made bills hosting.
---
But improved dailies from the higher level diaries, better access and the increased usefulness of the achievement items.
---
thought we were going via cb lvls...
---
we can do a weapons version too.
---
No, they'll be equipped, but dont give any stat bonuses.
---
I hope it does even with the hate
---
On reddit: Downvoted for being correct, upvoted for being incorrect

Runescape apocalypse
---
Just going to visit every house and ask questions until I find a host that kicks me. Then I’ll know it’s you
---
I’m not exactly sure there mate, I didn’t bring any tank gear besides justiciar helmet on my run. I just used max range+max mage. What does your budget look like atm?
---
i actually sort of miss the Ents that would try to kill you while you're just chillin cuttin trees
---
Oh thank Guthix! Yeah it's 6969.
---
Keep it up man, I highly suggest using the money for POH gains makes every better in the long run
---
All the more reason I have the community, mods, and people like you who speak up to be thankful for. I’m not the only one this game has helped, and will continue to do so. 
---
And, I’ll try. Hope you will as well, random stranger.
---
Exactly. If Jagex banned every streamer who did a giveaway, there would be none left.
---
They can do Zulrah surprisingly well actually. You don’t even need the recommended stats.
---
Darn, well thanks!! guess ill have to reup
---
Wintertodt with public chat turned on
---
They will not work in f2p. If they are currently equipped they will stay equipped until you take it off but will not be able to be equipped again in f2p. You can store them in the bank until you get membership again
---
100% bad spelling and grammar Op
---
I watched this one: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSUHnOQiYNg0M_OspamYsBexYIBH6M403
---
And no I didn't have Quest Cape, I just wanted the rc xp lamp
---
He's using the interface changer too.
---
&gt;If they are currently equipped they will stay equipped until you take it off but will not be able to be equipped again in f2p. You can store them in the bank until you get membership again
---
will they still work as if i was a member if they are equipped?
---
You'll keep them equipped, however their bonuses will be set to 0. This means you keep the cosmetics, but you'll be fighting like you're unarmed
---
Lol I'm at work so you'll have to wait at least 5 hours. Most other hosts are aware of this now and will most likely kick you anyway.
---
Theres no issue with putting members stuff into the bank on a f2p account
---
okay i see! thank you so much!
---
Have you ever thought maybe they don't want to talk to you?
---
fucking lol
---
Just buy some rune gear
---
only applies to rich boys who use dragonhunter crossbow
---
Gotcha, maybe grind some stuff that'll speed up what you are already doing. Put money making on hold so it can pay dividends later.
---
I’m 6’ 1” and would be genuinely afraid of doorways if my head goes any further up. 
---
But, either way, right back at you buddy! :D
---
I'd recommend setting a goal to finish DS2 as you'll unlock tons of content and getting stats for vork is another goal, which then you can farm and make decent money.
---
Yes the dragon Hunter crossbow does 30% more damage (and accuracy I think, hcim btw, no dhcb btw) against dragons, will vorkath counts, making dhcp overpowered af
---
Honestly i been doing barrows recently and im making decent money just off the runes and if you get a barrows item your making even more.
---
I have an elite that needs 72 thieving for king lathas chest. Im at 60 and the thought of doing thieving makes me wanna vomit
---
Yeah barrows is really great mid level stuff, good break from big grinds too.
---
mid level? hahahaha 93 is halfway to 90 and u think skills in 40s are mid level? hahahaha not saying u should know this you're a noob but its funny how far u are from mid level because when u read this u gonna say wowee
---
What are you saying mate
---
Yeah, on the mouse duh! Not sure how you play RuneScape though
---
Fire altar, but slightly farther away than the ring of dueling.
---
I did 77-99 at bloods and always just ran. but I had 99 agility or 90+ for the majority of it.
---
Lol 12k xp per hour, what about nightmare zone? You should go report all afk people there to.
---
Dz on 53 nuggets!
---
holy mother of god

nearly 1150kc.. still chasing her.. :/

Do you even have to decompile it?

Pretty sure you can just run it and use Wireshark lol

Started noticing the exact same when I planted it yesterday. Should give more, actually gives less.
---
Thanks
---
Reddit will block your RSN and password, try it
---
bots
---
f2p has much more noticeable botting as the strategy is suicide botting in f2p. P2p has more gold farmers and bots that blend in better (zulrah, etc).
---
It's a problem but it keeps supplies cheap, so most people ignore it.
---
As someone who slogged through runecrafting for the sole purpose of fairy magic-less ring travel I wholeheartedly agree.
---
.ru lmao
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about when you die the tick after being ported out of the cave. There was a post here once who got the pet, teleported out and died the same tick. Lost the pet immediately after he got it, but kept the cape.
---
You're definitely right in kicking them. I've talked to *many* players, and this kind of stuff never comes up. You could possibly send a report, too, but I'm not sure offhand if this is a reportable offense. Definitely a sly account phishing operation, good job OP.
---
Maybe 15 or 20 or so, I don’t know exactly I think if scales somehow with your farming level. 
---
They are planted as 4 seeds per patch so above is per patch not seed!
---
From Alabama, can confirm the yeehaw in clan.
---
Fair enough mate,don't ever put your login info into the rs website unless you went to the site yourself.
---
I started doing herb and birdhouse runs on Saturday.
---
I made like 600-700k in 2 days while doing random skilling/banging out diary requirements. I ended up with almost 250 ranaars and 250k in birds nest. First nest had a magic seed. This was with 5 herb patches and yew birdhouses, btw. 
---
I feel like a fucking moron for not starting sooner. Plant your herbs, set up your birdhouses, go do a quest, a slayer task, or an hour of skilling, etc. Set up tags in your bank, everything you need to do the run will be right there. Pull it all out and spend like 5 minutes collecting easy money. Go bang out another quest, slayer task, hour of skilling, repeat. 
---
The best part was finally getting around to it motivated me to do a bunch of other stuff. I did every part of Monkey Madness 2 except the Glough fight last night (wish me luck, the fucker dies tonight), and am like 2 or 3 skills away from every hard diary level requirement.
---
at least you're doing something. if you get 99 mage off splashing jagex should change your skill to 99 rat splashing
---
...but do you really have a chance?
---
AT LEAST I WONT RUN OUT OF GRANITE DUST!!!
---
-That guy, probably
---
Pls halp.
---
At least I’m closer to mid level than you are to speaking at beginning level English :)
---
Slayer ring to slayer cave --&gt; Fairy ring
---
Quest point cape --&gt; Fairy ring
---
Ardy cape --&gt; Fairy ring (bit long but still close)
---
71 Agility + summer pie(much cheaper than the zulrah tele) for the zulrah fairy ring shortcut so just 1 extra level of agility to train
---
Pretty sure it also got exposed as fake, apparently it was just someone who brought the account to make it look like he was Durial. But who really knows for sure?
---
Never Wheat Shredded Eat, k thx bye
---
Ya i been doing it for like 3 days and i have gotten like 4 items already
---
Iron Man
---
There’s not way *** ** **** is your social
---
Lol bots are better than me at zulrah
---
I wish Jagex would do something about that situation. Just put up a notice board of active hosts outside each house portal and somehow have it display house features, have it so you can sort based on each feature among other things.
---
I'm pretty sure that guy just lost HC status, unless there was another guy that happened to - but yes, you'd lose the pet if that happened.
---
It was a great few days selling herbs while all the bots were down because of the kourend remap.
---
Keep killing it dude. Fuck up that bastard!
---
That's dope dude!
---
He does max gear pking in wild and just hop worlds, sometimes he hops to pvp world bc its same thing when you are in wilderness with skull
---
You expect people to know how to read?
---
Lol so you are the douche bag that is so insecure they need to insult a race?
---
Good suggestion, but I've never liked tick manipulation methods. I did 3 tick fishing for most of my lvls, but got really bored with it during the end. When I 3t I want to keep going. When I powermine I'm cool with walking away for a while or forgetting about it :p
---
Lol that loadout. I got my first Zulruh kill over the weekend for elite void and after about 3 deaths and 5 teleports out I managed to get a kill. 100 combat, farseer helmet, mystic top, and ahrim's skirt. Venom felt hard to keep up with and I was chugging antipoison every other time the snek took a dip. It was very overwhelming and I got hit with pure dopamine when rng finally shined in my favor. Kill time was almost 4 mins and I got some runes as the drop. Ironmeme btw.
---
Dude just randomly told him he would kill his family without a word said to him. Came to Reddit to cry about it when he could’ve just reported it and moved on.
---
I agree he probably meant regular fountains, but I think the Fountain of Rune is botted as well
---
Give him the twisted now, it's time.
---
No, I give you shit for it because you’re a cunt towards other people for saying shit like this.
---
“lol wot. I can tell you're an angsty kid so idc to elaborate or justify anything further but hey if u r an adult shame on u, u should have a more developed brainl
---
“Angsty kid, if u r an adult shame on u, u should have a more developed brainl”
---
Yet you’re the one who can barely articulate sentences and thoughts. Telling someone you should have a more developed brain when you can barely write shit out is hypercritical and pathetic. Had you been nice I don’t give a shit how you type, you can’t call someone an idiot yet be an idiot yourself. People have brought up valid points yet you resort to arguments that make no sense.
---
You’ve explained nothing besides, “its just a game dont cry” while also talking about not reading comments. People have brought up valid points yet you’ve not had a single argument against them besides insults.
---
Fuck off mate
---
I want this here.
---
Is this supposed to be like the trade matching thing back in the day? Where your trade had to be fairly even?
---
They also don't weigh anything, so it can save you some inventory spaces or bank spaces
---
you have been visited by the cursed improper a q p; you will never hit another q p unless you type w in the next nanosecond
---
Explain, in detail, how you would irrefutably prove that a player is a bot. By all means, I'll wait. Actually, no I won't, I'm going to bed, but trust me I will check back later to see your incredible talents of deduction.
---
Will it be their level? Their name? Will it be 'watching them for 20 minutes'? 
---
Since you don't work for Jagex, you have no idea how they prove who is and isn't a bot. No idea at all. So how can you expect to have any kind of working theory as to how anything could be or do anything?
---
"They were moving around erratically!" Could be a disabled, elderly or very young person playing. Sometimes, I go AFK and my  almost two year old niece runs up and plays with my keyboard and mouse. Am I a bot now? Yesterday I was cutting willows in lumbridge and making fires. Someone ran up to me, said "bot" and I hopped worlds. Was I a bot? No, but I did want to be left alone. I had no reason to prove anything to that person. Couldn't care less what they expect. They probably reported me as a bot, too. 
---
Bots are annoying, but they've always been a part of this game. That hasn't changed in 20 years. Jagex has stated that they have a team of people that work on detecting bots. So.... they already do have people working on it. Just because you see bots, doesn't mean they aren't working on banning them. "But there are some bots that have been around a long time!" "but there are so many bots!". Yes, this happens in the real world too. Its called crime. We have law enforcement, but crime still happens. There are more criminals than law enforcement personnel. There are more botters than Jagex could ever hope to counter to produce 0-bot worlds, considering the age of the game/code and the simplicity of play makes countering bots very difficult I imagine.
---
Its easy, and lazy, to just throw your arms in the air and think "they aren't even trying!!!!". Are you sure you're right about that? I know you think you could solve this problem with your eyes closed, but reality is, you're a bit arrogant, egotistical and quite honestly a bit high on your own farts.
---
Firecape was fine, lots of 1 def firecape guides/recommended setups and strats
---
Yeah i agree that its more of a skill thing. Then there isnt really something that holds me back from doing it, except time.
---
Players still buy gold off these bots. These bots are more prevalent because of free twitch prime membership, but they exist because players still continue to ruin our game by buying from them
---
Blowpipe only 3 mil now. Thanks zulrah bots I guess.
---
Incorrect. From the Social Security Administration itself: https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html
---
No, because it's very funny :)
---
This is why I have hardly talked to anyone in my 600+ hours of game
---
BOER GERWIN!
---
Its spiny helmet.
---
I just refreshed myself on the proposal today, and it states that there are none, however higher levels increases quantity gathered as well as speed at which you get resource drops. I don't think the proposal has changed since.

heheh, yeah telling people to kill themselves is totally normal and cool heheh. im so edgy and cool haha the internet is such srs bzns i cant accept any joke in any form what so ever XD.. time to go on reddit and seek approval by trying to farm karma points XD. i just go with the flow of the comments and say whatever i think people wanna hear becauz i have no originality XD. brb mommie just made me tendies XD 
---
\^ you
---
Fill all Posh costume storages. All STASH units filled. All minigame rewards (Void, CW, MLM reward like upper floor etc). Braziers lit from troll quest. All mini quests. Varrock museum with fossils. All houses maxed standing. Optimal fairy rings unlocked. 
---
Lot more probably.
---
Yea, having a plan to be able to react to set spawns is a huge part I need to focus on I know I'm just barraging, running behind the pillar and then just trying to improvise. Thanks for the advice.
---
.. the elite fremmenik diary tho
---
The runecrafting grind awaits you once again.
---
Discord light mode reeee
---
that shouldnt happen...
---
just focus the same shaman they are on and theyll like never get kills w/ rcb
---
All champion scrolls aka champion cape
---
That is a bad idea. Then someone can say the answer is random garbage and be seen as valid. It is much better to make up a response that is not true. What is your favorite food? horse battery staple
---
I just want to mention that anyone who is looking up against the annoying task of leveling their slayer, is highly recommended to go and do wildy slayer. The tasks tend to be much more managable and even the most simple tasks will earn good money due to the emblem drops. It also has an added bonus to be somewhat more exciting due to the inherent danger that is involved in being in the wilderness.

Petition to hire Sir Pugger as a JMod to go around and spec out these bois
---
Yeah it was an insanely well designed scam. And they will definitely trick a lot of people. It’s sad but you’re right. It’s better off ignoring people.
---
yes but its need to be salve (ei)
---
It was only partly buyable. I remember needing tons of charms you had to get yourself.
---
Slayer task maybe? Or maybe you’re wrong. Idk
---
Where else? You have to bank for a farm run anyway, more efficient to keep everything there so you don't have to go to the leprechaun first at the start of every run.
---
If people wanna see beggars muted then they need to be vocal so that it bumps up the priority for Jagex. Duh. 
---
If shit like this bugs you then practice what you preach and shit the fuck up and move along.
---
If you are going around accepting random trades while wearing your bank on PVP worlds, then you deserve what you get.
---
1995 starts with 233 
---
Could it be in the 420s yet
---
How can you be so addicted to something you cant even take care of a basic hygiene.
---
Just complete lumby elite, bro..
---
hey easy, easy
---
I mean you’re not wrong. Lol. But when they give you a taste at first and let you basically get free money it sucks people in and make them do stupid shit.
---
This is just people finding drama because theres nothing to be mad about this month. The bots are waaaaay worse
---
lmao you are so stupid and ignorant its sad kiddo, i just made this reddit account when i found your post about me so i could comment on it and obviously the post is backfiring on you just read the comments buddy...
---
Anyone else use xgrace house to train prayer?
---
I didn't die for my first 6 or 7 fights when I started with melee with dfs and zamorakian hasta!
---
I closely watched two Vorkath videos, one good one by AsukaYen, the other a Ghrazi rapier example before my attempt.
---
I only died once I switched to elite void toxic blowpipe and let my guard down, I had gotten too comfortable with the melee setup that I didn't eat in time or walk away in time. Died twice in a row and was pissed.
---
i swear kept you on your toes the game is so nerfed need to bring back risk
---
Lmao
---
Same
---
You got me cx c: really hurt my feelings with that one! I’m super upset now :( there was no sarcasm or joking involved in my comment, I was being 100% serious and authentic and you are ridiculing me for it D: you really ruined my day man :’[
---
I don’t think there are very many players who make 70/hr. That’s pushing 150k/y If full time
---
Pks 1.1m. 
---
Oh nice! 2m pk!
---
Copy pasta
---
Yes, and it stacks with void too
---
It's all created inside Dreams.  All the logic, sculpting, animations, effects etc. 
---
The only thing that was not created was the sound effect.
---
Can you tell me it so i dont accidentally take yours?
---
It could've happened
---
So unlucky m8
---
You got this bro, when you’re playing next time around spend like a week or so learning the caves and the waves. Look up a multitude of guides, study the spawn locations, study the optimal route for every wave in correlation to every spawn. The thing is with how I’ve explained everything it’s less about skill too. Pull up every possible spawn point, wave guides, and optimal strategy for every type of spawn for every wave. The difference is, as soon as you hop on wave 35 and get spawn B for example, you know *exactly* what to do immediately and you know the optimal way to do it. Have these all pulled up while you’re doing the cave. What this does is make it so you’re not spending time trying to figure out what to do while taking extremely heavy damage. You don’t have to think about what the best way to position yourself is, you just immediately know. It’ll make it so you don’t really take any damage. My first success took me 4 hours. 2 hours going into logging out to prepare. I could have completed inferno on my 3rd attempt but I got cocky and decided not to log out for a few waves. 
---
The trade off is instead of taking 10-50 attempts to finish the inferno, you can do it in 3-5 attempts easily. You don’t have to be a top tier pvmer with top tier gear. Instead of 100 hours to complete, you complete it in 10. Good luck brother
---
Giscust?
---
Was posted literally ten mins ago 😂
---
??
---
I mean, I get it. Slayer is by far the most interesting skill in the game but the fact that EHP without a cannon is like 20k/hr makes it a pain in the ass to train.
---
levelling hunter so tog goes to rc FeelsGoodMan
---
No they hold boulder you lift them.
---
Since learning more pvm on other bosses like raids and vorkath switches I feel pretty comfortable with. It was just learning the rotations in zulrah that always made me stay away
---
😂
---
This.
---
Honestly I'm glad it isn't. Call me edgy but I wanna fuck around with my friends in our own cc's/DM's without bsing muted by a shitty robot
---
Oh very very cool I thought that house party stuff was a scam lmao.
---
I've got about a mil left after gearing up I've got no idea how far that would get me in Dbones. Depending on how far that'll get me maybe I'll just blow it on prayer call that good enough for the freebie week!
---
I appreciate the advice! Ill be off for the next few hours I'll shoot you a PM when I'm getting on.
---
Thanks!
---
That's a loss-loss for everyone but the bot farmer
---
lets make a list of all our SSN and we can see which are available :)
---
Okay, I’ve got an explanation below ;) Thanks!
---
Just annoying as fuck seeing the Reddit circlejerk “PvM content is only slayer haha it should be called a slayer update haha let’s make the hos rework a bunch of slayer stuff haha”
---
Like I mean come on... it’s not funny anymore.
---
Why is it whenever someone has more than another it's always they bought gp? I've made my money doing other pvm and skilling I sold some items to try ancestral to get a PB. This sub is so toxic it's a shame
---
I got mine a few weeks ago with pugs. Took 3-4 hours, and my groups were awful. The difficulty is definitely overstated.
---
Are you an ironman?
---
Also blowpipe spec for the poor people such as myself
---
Don't forget to charge your phone bro :)
---
I was mostly joking :P I was basically sitting around for 2 months with no work so i needed something to do. Got 32 days 19 ours in the last 3 months haha
---
If you want to learn together I have 0kc but would like to learn it. My rsn is "Sleepless 1" and I have discord too. Ironman btw.
---
What's your rsn? I'll add you.
---
He said "going till first unique" his first unique happened to be two uniques... That's the point. He isn't playing it off as his first kill...
---
1% is a little low for just vorkath but yeah this guy is a fucking douche lol
---
check out volcanic mine if you want to afk mine.
---
check out granite if you like to mine+drop iron.
---
Also no spaces
---
scaled logarithmically, if at all
---
It would only be seen as valid if the company doesn't take their security seriously.

Join a CC that does it, and isn't full of elitists.

Ranarr with ultracompost is usually the best, depends on prices though. You can check this spreadsheet to see average profit per seed. Red column is ultra compost and magic secateurs.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1#gid=1034205971
---
They already are
---
thank you for answering my question haha, 4 killed 30 left. I'll eventually get ancients
---
"set goal of going till I got my first unique"
---
What the actual fuck are you talking about you fucking retard mongloid, i explicitly stated that the cumulative killcount will be negated by the lower point reward, and it would be excluded from solo bosses like Cerb, directly resulting in slower progression. Are you some sort of troll? RS3 troglodyte? I don't even play rs3. 
---
If you're a troll props to you you're easily top 5 reddit trolls i've ever seen. 
---
If you're serious just go ahead and kill yourself, because your intellectual property that's stored inside your brain would much more benefical to this planet while it's decomposing in the ground.  Fucking glue sniffing moron.
---
15?
---
Lol u called him "sweaty"
---
if you worry about some shitposter shitposting about some art for a 2007 browser game i think you need to get your priorities straight
---
I mean I usually know the rough rwt rates and I've never rwted
---
can confirm did get scammed. lost like 10m osrs, not a big deal tbh, since it was wasted money in the first place.
---
85 cmb 70 range 60 def 50 pray, ironman so no antifires. Think its possible with good ruby bolt rng?
---
Good idea. Running through brimhaven sucks
---
:')
---
Daily tasks- battle staffs, herb runs, birdhouses, kingdom
---
4 accs- having a WC alt is afk, a cooking alt is AFK, fishing is afk. Basically you check them on downtime with your main account. You can have more active accounts but then it should only be 1 (rune dragon's, gargoyles, ect.) And you need to manage what the afk or active activity is.
---
dds is stab sword l0l
---
Yeah fuck that, I'm not risking 3,000 hours cause I'm too lazy to make some money
---
Ty
---
That’s our discord name ‘07 Altar Community’  and our clan ‘’07 altar’. It’s simply for the fact that it’s for the people who train prayer. It’s like saying Oldschool Community instead of old school players. 
---
1) it sounds nicer
---
2) makes it feel more open
---
3) not lame.
---
Jesus abandoned this sub long ago
---
Of course they are, why wouldn't they be?
---
Good bot
---
If you equip graceful and have negative weight, you should start accelerating into space
---
Somebody pls hack him and release that pet, this is so unfair :'(
---
We missed you serene
---
Make them play ironman, I like it.
---
Defintely some crazy odds
---
Too bad its not much cash :)
---
It has litterally no requirements. With any clue about automatising the bots, every single banned bot can be replaced nearly instantly.
---
Three accounts at one time?? Wtf.. I cant even imagine.. Im doing my best to manage one account.. Thats too sweaty for me my brudda.. Ima holla at bolga b4 it comes to that🤣🤣🤣

Vorkath during the quest has lower hp than vorkath post quest (460 hp vs. 750 hp) meaning ruby bolts are less useful during the quest.  For just one kill rune bolts will be fine
---
Thank you! In my opinion it is definitely worth it. If you are creative and enjoy building stuff from the zero or simply play other people's awesome creations then this is the game for you man.
---
Wow do people really splash until 94? Insanity
---
Took me 1500 something kc on my ironman to get bludgeon if that is of any help.
---
Especially new players who are usually excited to actually explore the game, quest, try out all the skills etc. Meanwhile mosf high level players can just hop on and skill for 3 hours straight without really caring at all.
---
Sorry to break it to you but sirpugger is a copycat of the content down to the very name of his videos. He got them from another creator.
---
Not gonna lie. You wouldn't do it better.
---
Why would anyone bother walking around and spamming what they're selling when they could just go to another world and use ge?
---
I miss being at your level
---
My buddy lives in the Bay Area clearing  150k/yr with an undergrad degree in software engineering.
---
I’m clearing 90k/yr with an undergrad in GIS in Dallas.
---
I met a kid in Washington working at a pizza shop making 50k. Granted price of living there is stupendous.
---
It all depends on demographics.
---
See! I didn’t even know that. Just tired of copy cat YouTube content. I crave more things like swampletics and gridlocked or even playing runescape properly. PK videos are pretty much all the same thing and I use them more for account build ideas but the bot ones just make me so mad for some reason
---
This picture made me gag
---
But you can profit?
---
Reading this on my phone while alching with my right hand :(
---
discugst
---
&gt;the only reason they would bring void range with it is because it's awkward switching
---
This is just false the reason people being void range is because it's much much better than Arma on the bosses you range in tob.
---
If bloods then souls it’s going to somewhere around 65-70m
---
At first I thought it was a joke post about people actually socialising in W330 POHs.
---
Which one though?
---
My mom got upset with me a couple times yelling at my screen. To which I pointed out she does the same when watching political news channels
---
Or yknow they think that a word shouldn't be an insta mute and should always go off the context.
---
Picking and choosing what words are okay is a slippery slope that I'm glad jagex doesn't want anything to do with anymore.
---
 90% of players are over 18. Most of them are mature enough to deal with some taboo words.
---
Those people are still edgy fuck heads, but they have a right to be that way. Just as we have a right to ass them to ignore and call them pieces of shit.
---
Yeah it warns you, I use the spell to get my alt to wildy course
---
I have fond memories of beating Galvek and quest Vorki with the rcb and other welfare gear. 
---
getting the ruby spec was exhilarating compared to the piddly shit damage you otherwise do
---
Yeah.  
---
  
---
Source: I work in this field.
---
I'm from Australia so I have a tax file number instead 135 229 345
---
it is absurd because most of the time they end up selling it for -5%, so it’s even less close to 10m
---
You can profit with ice burst and spend half as long. Profit with either is negligible regardless.
---
go fail a agility course
---
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of repercussions from non-government entities. Especially ones that aren't US based.
---
means he sees how to do it perfect but keeps messing up. so his knowledge is increasing just not execution.
---
Oh damn he played the long con.
---
Wave 63 still gives me nightmares
---
Thank you for the detailed response!
---
They're to weed out the noobs
---
Umm it's pronounced ranarr...
---
Yaya. Also alch is hp free
---
rich is kinda relative. I've got like 10m right now because I bought rigour and an ornate pool, spellbook swap and construction levels. It's going to take a bit to get back to where I can upgrade to dhcb
---
PM me your RSN I’ll and you and buy you a bond so you can get started on members.
---
If the left was Dharoks instead, I would see no difference between this and the original.
---
It's the same thing as your national insurance number
---
“I just want to remind you that I love you.”
---
Technically, right before you guessed the number, you said "I didnt agree to the terms".
---
Durial321 did nothing wrong
---
That interface is beautiful
---
Listen here. We all know you're not getting laid.
---
Having high agility is nice though, so many shortcuts and quicker run regen. I used to hate doing agility back in the days, but the rooftop courses are pretty nice because they sprinkle Marks of Graces for you to get.
---
I've been doing vorki all day. I've seen 2 people with dhcb, and the other 50 or so were all using the same bgs+bp setup I was
---
Get Runecrafting up a bit so you can use Diary rewards on it.
---
Get 75 combat so you can do Konar slayer. I've been doing it on my alt and it's  a lot better than Chaeldar. At 85 you can use Nieve who generally gives better tasks.
---
Start Fairytale part 2 so you can use fairy rings.
---
How the eff do you get lured from behind. That’s masterful
---
r/TIHI
---
You realize Jagex was one of the biggest driving forces in big game companies actually starting to listen to their game influencers on social media right?
---
Many game subreddits are envious of r/2007scape because Jmods listen to suggestions if they fit into game and are appropriate
---
*Comment text*
---
Most likely not and definitely not "extremely easily"
---
Good luck bro, I believe in you. Don’t be discouraged if you fuck up, you’re supposed to fail. Whenever you die, look back and ask yourself why and how you died. Then figure out a way to not die the same way, what to improve, etc. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get it by your forth or fifth attempt, I promise you though going through with my method will 10000% help you a **lot**
---
Dog did you just comment on a four day old OSRS Reddit post.. the fuck is wrong with you
---
Seems kinda worthless on a regular account.
---
Thank you for your service
---
The guys helmet looks like a smiley face with lipstick
---
Never a question, only a statement.
---
Figured as such, ill wait until antifires for sure then.
---
lol i stop playing every like 4-5months and i come back with bunch of new content lol
