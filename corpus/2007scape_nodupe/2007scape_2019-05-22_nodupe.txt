Because making amethyst scale for price to dart ratio would make the current price skyrocket and blowpipe is already pretty powerful as it is.

Your defense is really low especially with a torso. 2-3 kills isn't that surprising. I think range can work but blowpipe isn't cost effective and im going to assume you don't have a tbow

Exactly right. There's definitely a market for a no changes classic wow, but most players are going to realize just how rough the original game was without nostalgia goggles. Of course it was revolutionary for the time, but due to being a brand new game it had so many problems it's hard to count them all. 2007 scape had years of development behind it while vanilla gets to launch with spirit on everyone's gear still.

I'll tell you the thing that someone told me when I first started getting back into the game a month and a half ago with a fresh account:
---
Do Recipe for Disaster (all of it)
---
Quest Point Cape
---
99 slayer
---
These are three important and good general purpose goals.
---
Recipe for Disaster is important because it has a metric fuckton of both skilling and quest requirements that will, by itself, get you to do about or just over half of the quests in the game and it unlocks the Barrows Gloves (and all of the gloves between bronze and dragon) which are essentially the best in slot gloves for melee, range, and mage, or will be until you reach endgame content.
---
Honestly, you could take the other two goals and shelf them and just go for completing recipe for disaster and I can almost guarantee you that by the time you finish RFD you'll have explored enough of the game out of necessity to be able to adjust your own sails and figure out your own goals, but I'll continue on.
---
Quest point cape consists of you finishing all of the quests in the game which have some hefty skill requirements. The benefits of this go essentially without saying. You'll unlock all the quest content in the game, get the nifty quest point cape, and have the skilling requirements from it to boot. [There's a guide on the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) that will guide you through the most efficient order to do the quests to line up the xp rewards/quest requirements of previous quests with the skill/quest requirements of the next to basically give you a relatively straight line to follow and minimizing the need to stop and grind levels for your next quest. Again, nothing is gonna force you to use this all the way through, but I found this to be an extremely helpful tool to just give me direction while I was starting out and figuring out what I wanted to do.
---
Finally, 99 slayer. In short, makes you money in the long run, forces you to use different combat styles to level it effectively, gets you combat xp in the meanwhile. Good skill that opens a lot of doors, not a whole lot else to say.
---
Hope I could help. If you have any other questions or just feel like having a chat, feel free to hit me up ingame. IGN: Zaiios

ah shit, yeah that and the dragon slayer boss in the comments. I didn't even know things like this happened. It really sucks, but must be extremely hard to produce/do or else I feel like they would've gained more traction. It really does suck, and bugs should be fixed.
---
I fall in this pool.  I want to join PK but feel like I can't because I:
---
1. Don't have a pure
---
2. Can't learn about it outside random YT videos
---
3. Will see likely no profit outside of a forgetful deep wildy kill
---
4. Don't have the time for a 4 hour wildy wandering "learning session"
---
5. I just have better things to do in game, even more outside
---
I am afraid to max almost, because I think I might have to abandon the account with such little to do.  PKing seems like a **great** fix for that. Hop on, do 20 minutes of 1v1s and move on. Or begin risking more and more for late game leveling for a better rush.
---
Wish I could join

A few weeks, would just do it in my free time while I watched stuff on my other monitor.

If he didnt find the L's somewhere, how would he be handing them out?

Yeah but it's still nice, 70m is gucci enough with me.

It wasn't too hard, better than most things.

Because I would imagine ultimate iron men use herb sacks for making pots more often than someone needing to check their herb sack. Herb Sack holds like 40 of each herb so checking it is kind of a rare occcurance. 
---
Gem bag is most often used in shilo village for gem rocks and checking it happens much more often.
---
Something else to add onto that is that I think everyone can benefit from a side account thats used for pking. Its fun to do and really does change up the normal pace that a lot of skilling and pvming can become. If you have any questions just ask me on here and I might be able to help

2. Is there a way to sort by Actual Frequency or Effective frequency?

Thanks again :)
---
Also quite annoying having to ungear and then regear after wildy step. Still have fun doing them, though. The chance of being PKd makes them more interesting than fighting a saradomin wizard for the 600th time.
---
Rs frowned upon because osrs is suppose to be a game where you go and actually make your money by playing the game. If it was BTW then you can go play rs3 and pay for your good and all you want that way.

that's some insane mental gymnastics you're doing there
---
At my stats could I comfortably do barrows runs?
---
43 prayer, 60 att, 60 str and 50 Def. Wearing full rune with warriors helm, combat brace, glory and using a dragon scimitar. I know I probably can't do Ahrim as melee is my only option right now, but could I do the melee brothers and maybe Karil okay?
---
Also, what setup should I be looking at using for my inventory?
---
Watch jads movements
---
Jesus 2 platinum. You're the kinda bloke who pvps in gilded.
---
IMO yes. Full prayer gear and preserve prayer will help summer pies last longer, too.
---
So i'm on night shifts, i get bored of slayer or whatever skilling i'm doing.  So i hop to f2p worlds, look for people nearly at 40 attk and hand out a couple of rune scims.
---
This chap tried to pay me what he'd been saving up for a scim.

okay as you wish

Magic is way, way more effective against the melee brothers. What is your magic level, and do you have access to Iban's blast?
---
the game would never survive without the ge, anyone who argues otherwise clearly doesn't remember how big of a pain in the ass it was to do literally anything before that.

but you can see for yourself and play as an ironman.

But I‚Äôd rather avoid the possible TBC WOTLK expansions, unless they‚Äôre heavily modified for classic.
---
Why would you wanna use controlled anyways? Its most likely adding them up if it states using controlled, but making money and doing slayer is better then afking nmz imo, unless you're semi busy, then afking nmz is fine. You dont even have bis gear or are you going for imbues or straight exp if its exp, get barrows gloves torture and imbue the b ring if you havent already.

---
me on the left
---
Generally if it's saying you'll get 100k exp/hr that's with the assumption you're training one single combat skill, not using controlled. 100k/hr is a very high estimate tbh unless you're really high strength and using bis or close to it but if you were using controlled it'd be more like 33k/hr in each of att/str/def.
---

oh I do. but you're not even trying. you clearly cant count, hence why i said you must be a pker

You use one less room in your POH.

---
The XP/hour for melee/combats is usually given as if you were training one of those skills and HP isn't in the calculation since that's always the same (a ratio of the other experience gained and people train it passively when training anything else).
---
"100k/hour" would be 100k attack OR 100k Strength OR 100k Defence OR (33k ATT + 33k STR + 33k DEF).

If they were tradable it would drive a demand to farm them and they would be fludding the GE. I would guess that fire capes would settle for 800k and infernal capes 6mish...

As it stands now, a fire cape and an infernal cape is ‚Äúworth‚Äù (not considering economics and implications of making it tradable)  prob 5-6M and 300-400m respectively IMO

Do I have to accept my fate and just quit trying to get the ban lifted?

If you're an ironman use them for jewellery when needed (duel rings and games necks for example) otherwise just let them sit there. If you're not an ironman put them on GE

---
Both of these have problems, since going down levels is the opposite of a penalty for creating custom account builds. And 50 random items/stacks would just encourage filling your bank with random junk. Though I like the idea of a penalty other than losing your title on a single death.

I‚Äôd rather turn them into craft XP since I already have them. May as well put them to use yeah?

??? I mean if more people are willing to compete, more would be willing to pay and add to the prize pool.  But if you're looking at 10-20m reward for a 300+ hour grind, doesn't seem worth it or fun, or will it even be considered by most players
---
I'm not, why do you think so?
---
You only negate the green blob attack which can hit quite high. To negate the ranged attacks you need to pray protect from missiles. You will still take damage from the purple spawns if you don't avoid them.

I‚Äôm happy you find the spreadsheets helpful :)

The tasks were Zygomites and Waterfiends I believe, the issue was they weren‚Äôt being counted under the ‚ÄúTotal Points‚Äù but I fixed that 2 months ago so it should be all good now.
---
All of the tasks are by default sorted by task weight, so they should already be sorted by both actual/effective frequency? Although there are the empty spots from blocked/skipped tasks which is annoying, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to sort those to the bottom, at least not with the way I designed these spreadsheets.

Ay that's not true, killing rev killers is the only form of PvP that rivals vorky. Maybe if you weren't so shit you could maybe do it yourself some time instead of complaining about pkers in a pvp zone

Definitely what that guy said. There‚Äôs something about both morrowind and osrs that is just so great. Probably just how you can do anything and go anywhere without there being a scaling/level system. Even oblivion gave me similar vibes to runescape. You don‚Äôt get games like that anymore.

And when you're left with the tentacle look at its price. Don't get me wrong this kind of thing helps but this only is there for a select few items. The gmaul for example needs the clamp.

Thanks for all the help everyone just looked back on this thread. Around 2 months later playing pretty casually and I'm at around a 30mil bank rn, so I think I'm in a good place. Linked stats below as well, thanks a lot to the guy who recommended farming, its easily my favorite skill now.

You have to actually get good at all roles in BA, pass their vetting process, interact with people, consistently be online when the other folks are, and finally be willing to not progress your account for however long you're doing BA in order to make cash. The trade-off is of course that you make an *obscene* amount of cash doing this, so if you're willing to do it then go for it

Slayer for sure. Find some rune and a d scim even and go get 80+ slayer. 
---
Once you get some arclight charges or a whip and blowpipe, go to demonic gorillas. Extend black demon tasks. Trust me - demonic gorillas are my go to money maker and i love getting them as a task. Since youve got qcape youve done mm2, and dg's are great money even if ya dont get a zenyte on the task. On a 200+ task I get 4.5-5m. Add in a zenyte drop (1/300 drop rate btw) and its 17m+ a task. With your range and melees you can do gorillas pretty fast too, I assume youve got rigour also which is even better. Whip is fine and arclight is even better there, super fast kills. 
---
100% i vote for demonic gorillas. And then continuing slayer. They also give lots of slayer exp. Then once ya build up some gp from them you can go to vorky or zulrah. But keep working on slayer for sure.
---
Thank you.

Tbh i didn't know runescape didn't have microtransactions
---
Yes I totally agree they should change the death system and increase the risk in pvm. It could act as a good gold sink too. So what do you propose they replace the alchables with?
---

If this doesn't convince them I don't know what will.
---
What
---
It's well worth it, W420 GE has been something else these past couple of days. Just witnessed a maxing party earlier today. I think was part of a big osrs orgy or something a couple of days ago. Also played catch using a hand egg with this chap for like 2 hours.
---
It's fun.
---
And what happens when people vote randomly solely for a cosmetic item?
---
One of your friends did it... and he didnt really quit
---
Pray mele and eat to 115
---
Put the tinfoil down son..
---
Problem is, that I can't even get the password reset and Yes the items / gold are lost forever, but that's fine
---
yeah 99 slayer in 2009 took my the entire year, i was lvl 126 combat back in 2007, first 99 was fletch in 2006
---
follow the gold boys! its gilded time
---
FoG didn't come out til 08 so it was never in this version of the game.
---
That was just a joke haha
---
Watch a guide on how to flinch witches house with a posion dagger or youll die.
---
This isn't a bug, it's just a quirk of how the fight caves work. You get taken out of the caves at that moment after killing jad, you just happened to die in the cave as you got taken out
---
did you talk to Oziach first?
---
Pure pking is wack af, if you have 99 str range and mage on your main pk on that
---
Skyrim also came to mind. Played thousands of hours in it
---
Haha what if he's trolling and needs like 1.2 mil pray xp and he's like "shit guys sorry I still need 99 pray, brb!" haha that'd be funny as shit 100 people crushed!
---
I would cry... I'd like to think they just keep their Private chat Off-- but then their display names start going
---
Same im with the no changes crowed sadly i am in the minority. Oh well i enjoyed it while it lasted in 2013.
---
They don't risk nothing? they risk anywhere up to a mill before teleporting? And killing other teams at revs is even better money. Multi pking isn't my thing and I don't do this but I can see the appeal. Do you think pkers should be banned from rev caves and it should be another risk-free piece of pvm content?
---
Sure you could beat all these pkers man, good on you
---
:3
---
I guess a rephrase to my question, why do you think you'll get an answer to this here?
---
Never tought cheldar was so thicccc.
---
Red chins.  
---
In all seriousness, you're going to consistently have a bad time at that cb level, you're right in the perfect spot where most PK accounts can attack you in 30 wildy.  
---
If you're set on doing black chins, try and max your magic defence (black dhide) and bring plenty of food.
---
funny and true
---
Nope just awful rng after healers, t bow hit like 15 0s in a row
---
So it‚Äôs been a problem and Jagex has done nothing
---
Blizzard is taking steps in the right direction so far by supporting an actual legacy/Classic version of the game after all these years. 
---
But how they go from here is what determines how it turns out in the future.
---
Sevilla
---
Yeah no problem they nerfed it where you could actually just use a super fire I think and pray range but now you need even more protection. Once you use a dhcb you start protecting range. Anyways good luck man enjoy the boss made me millions!üëçüèª
---
I get it because these seemingly unrelated events are actually related haha ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
This would be even more overpowered than a max cape in some respects. The cape already fills its own niche and i'm fine with that.
---
I was kind of being silly. I really hope your mate isn‚Äôt screwing you over. There‚Äôs plenty of better games to play I hope you guys enjoy whatever you find!
---
How did you get from 98 to 99 RC without Tears of Guthix?
---
Exactly that.
---
You can go to a whole lot of places and find botters 24/7/365
---
Letting them get extra cheap membership has made the problem worse. Free trials, prime etc.
---
It's not meant to be those.
---
You the guy with the steel square shield on the left?
---
Whats green dragons?
---
Nice. Crazy how far it has dropped in price. Nevertheless awesome drop!

jagex rly must suck to work at didnt even have a job lined up

---
Ur a fucking weirdo tbh
---
S
---
And u?
---
Do artists fap to their own drawings? If you know what I'm sayin'.
---
rc isnt a bad skill once ur 77 lol.
---
Yeah I invested a lot into my characters as well. When EOC came out, I played for awhile, it seemed interesting then it quickly got annoying with the constant spinning of the wheel for "free" gear and everything. I tried it again and again over the years but it just wasn't the same, especially with the weird 3D graphic models, the gear and everything just looks so odd to me. I guess the same could be said about OSRS but it brings a sense of nostalgia back to me that I didn't really appreciate as a teenager playing the game. You can always try out OSRS and see if it hits the Nostalgia button making you want to stay. 
---
I'm not saying I'm on OSRS for good, but for the time being it helps time go by as I can do nothing but sit at home due my body hating me. I have degenerative disc disease and just found out I also have mild arthritis in my lower spine - so I sit at home all day and I hate it now that I'm an adult. As a kid, I wanted nothing more than to just sit on the computer and game 24/7 but now that I'm older it's like, I want to go out and do something.
---
What is "leeching"? I keep seeing the term but I'm not sure what it means. I think it has something to do with BA? Apparently you can hire "leechers"?
---
Yeah, log into your twitch account and click on the Twitch Prime loot button near the top right of the screen, you can then claim your OSRS membership from there, you just have to link your twitch account with your OSRS account and membership should be applied automatically
---
Oh im blind I was looking at fletching
---
Well if you're not one I guarantee I'm definitely not this long after the gold train come through. It didn't just leave the station, the train isn't even running right now.
---
Quest up to the mid 30s. Besides Tithe Farm there‚Äôs no way to actively train Farming (don‚Äôt do it unless you want the outfit). For XP you do tree runs until 200m and you can do some herb runs if you want to passively make some money. I‚Äôm 91 Farming currently and I log on mobile to do a tree run when I wake up and before I goto bed. It‚Äôs a skill I actually get XP for ~15 minutes per day but the XP drops are massive because of the time it takes to grow the trees.
---
Why not take the charter boats from brimhaven to catherby fruit tree patch?

It isn‚Äôt gonna kill you, and it‚Äôs a much easier hole to dig yourself out of than alcohol/drug addiction. It‚Äôs a net positive for some people, myself being one of them. Being judgmental and a smartass over reddit isn‚Äôt a healthy lifestyle either
---
So you're addicted to something and try to tell others how to cope with addiction when you cannot even do it yourself.

This isn't a bug, the fight caves have operated like this since it was released in 2005. He just happened to reach 0 hp 1 tick before the game sent him outside and resume the death animation. I don't understand how people think this is a bug when you don't restore hp/prayer when you leave unlike the inferno. The death animation didn't even start till he was outside. Just pray melee. 
---
Imo there should not be any 'safe' deaths for hardcore; you have 1 life and it is supposed to be challenging.
---
Watching some torvesta vids where he‚Äôs on a pvp world, why does everyone have cash on them?

Tinfoil doesn't protect against shitty updates nor brainlets like yourself so I don't know why you think I'd be wearing one to begin with.

As a random 100cmb PvMer who is too scared to get into PvP and dump my skilling earning, I chuckled at this because I actually was gonna buy a Dinh's for some tasking in the wilderness.
---
I did jad this weekend in similar gear. Actually died on wave 61 my first attempt because I forgot to use a restore potion for my prayer. Just get to jad potted up, and only start watching his attacks. I kept my prayer on protect from magic by default and just switched to ranged every time I saw him stomp. It made it much easier to track for me. Once I got hit 0s by the range attack I switched back to magic and did my thing attacking healers or jad or potting up while I watched for the next stomp. Also make sure you‚Äôre using hot keys to be able to switch between your prayer and inventory screen efficiently
---
I love when people make comments like this when knowing nothing about someone‚Äôs financial life or spending habits.
---
For all you know the dude is poor as fuck and jobs are just survival for him

But why settle at that? Clearly you have the capability to change.
---
But you don‚Äôt need 95+ combat stats to partake so I don‚Äôt get your point
---
Ah. Gatekeepers.

They have like a 90% chance of dropping a hammer lol. Goblins in god wars drop rates for hammers are insanely increased.

I got a cheap ass amazon kindle fire (had to do some hackery to get google play to download osrs but it does the job) there are way better out there but this was very cheap
---
My buddy has a chinchompa pet. Keeps calling it a chinchilla and denying it has anything to do with rs. Fucking idiots think they can steal from our game
---
You‚Äôre doing the same thing as the original reply I responded to, speaking like someone who hasn‚Äôt dealt with an actual harmful addiction before. You don‚Äôt just magically fucking wake up one day and do a 180 with your life just like that after years of substance abuse. 
---
Whatever.

You can buts its a pain and not that worth for osrs

If you have exp drops turned on, just click at the exact same time as the exp drops.

What annoys me is having to empty all gem types separately from the gem back. Ffs just empty all and go like most rare -&gt; least rare or something

same experience here. took me years to get the quest cape as a kid, then I got it so much faster now. then I dunked on kid-me and also got the fire cape.
---
the crab emoji also rose to the top of my frequently used.. https://i.imgur.com/ZbrXcLg.png

Don't worry you're right lmao, people upvoting this shit are literally braindead
---
I think your idea is a bit strange and would seems very out of place in the world, whilst I think having a Death npc would be a good idea.
---
You could either pay him 100k to get all your gear back or perform a quick 10 minute minigame/task for Death to repay your debt. This would give new players a method of reobtaining their items should they die and a suitable money sink for players who've been playing for a while.
---
But the main reason we have the death mechanic we have today is due to the massive amount of DDoS attacks that were taking place so people died at bosses then the person performing the DDoS would go ahead and loot the dead persons stuff.
---
So what we have now isn't great but it's a million miles better than what we had.
---
Lol

enrish plz

You said "Iirc"? I told you what it meant, I'm not the person who originally posted, that's /u/UnitGod

I posted in response to him below :)
---
It is not going to happen. Spending dev time on new minigames isn't particularly smart. The risk of it dying is way too high. So they would rather spend time on something that isn't dead a week after it launches.
---
I did 10-60 Agility in Rooftops only: 10-30 in Draynor, 30-40 in Varrock and 40-60 in Canifis. In that time I got full Graceful set, about 18 marks before hitting level 60.
---
But SCREW CANIFIS!! That course sucks! I even failed on my final lap when I hit 60 Agility - 20 levels over the requirement!
---
in fairness i feel this way anytime i get a 99. just dinged 99 farming and i think i'm gonna take a break when my membership expires. but since then i've just been cutting trees with no specific motivation in mind.
---
i like never use it for teles, upvote this idea heaps
---
i thought i was in the mount and blade subreddit for a moment
---
Yeah it‚Äôs this
---
all I gotta do is look up on the hiscores who has 64 hp, 46 prayer, 1 easy clue done, and 100 spec and that cape of skulls is mine...
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
He's level 110 pog champ
---
Stop it
---
Yeah that's what they're often likened to
---
Yeah i know what it was changed.
---
Though same argument can be said about dying and your stuff being magically hidden from everyone lol.
---
But my idea is just that throwing stuff out there hence asking people's opinions what they'd do,
---
I'm not suggesting people be able to see other people's stuff just that there be some form of thing in place that adds a risk to dying, something that doesnt exist anymore.
---
Nevah have
---
But Jagex don't have access to everybody's banking statements, he's implying that Jagex may work on the assumption that he's RWTing because there is wealth moving between the accounts.
---
If you want Risk go.play a hardcore ironman.
---
Yup thats the plan now
---
It's called being considerate, and no I don't have to worry about it all the time. Also, my life isn't boring, thanks for asking.
---
Yea really one but i liked it got 96 qp and decent stats for a 2 weeks old acc i played normal and iron but that wasnt it for me

tbh i did not use a bank pin because i only had &gt;20m

Obsidian or Bandos. They at least give strength bonus. Google ‚Äúosrs body slot‚Äù and you‚Äôll find a table that you can sort by any stat to see the best armor piece for the slot. There‚Äôs a table for every slot. It‚Äôs super helpful!

As in you complete 3 steps while juggling, then get a new master clue to juggle and you go back to 0? That's how every clue level works

Did you put out though?
---
Not too hard once you've done a couple of attempts
---
I know. I was being sarcastic. I agree with the him and you! Clues aren‚Äôt meant to make you 200M per hour. No one cares if you get trash rewards. If someone gets triple rangers (idk if it‚Äôs possible haha) I wanna see that!
---
&gt; Does it function like a dragon scimitar? 
---
when you hit things it teleports them
---
Its been a big complaint, theyll be using sharding for the launch of classic but will phase it out after like two weeks.  With how old it looks modern computers shouldnt struggle with having 200 people in the dame area.  Even if it does, crushing lag was a feature of classic.  My 2 button rotation wouldnt be hard without 3 fps
---
Because some of us actually like attempting the game instead of loading cannonballs every 30-45 seconds
---
I guess it didn't get hot, it probably dried up.

He just did way too much progress in 1 vid, skipped over so much stuff, can't really make a series when you complete 50% of the content available in 1 video

What? How are they "obese"?

Depends on what your bursting. Most things have a low magic defense so I use a ring of the gods (i) for the prayer bonus
---
Perfect. Need someone who can keep the neopets sub under control!
---
Lol what
---
Probably not. You'll likely make more money sticking to green drags.
---
OP, someone who has no idea about wow classic. The same direction? What do you even mean? Add new content? No never. Change the game as it was, no never. Its truly a legacy editon. Not a game on its own like OSRS.
---
Yeah probably nerf the xp a bit.

Alot.

Everything from rune to whip/barrows is mid level to me, with lower-mid being rune and high-mid being dragon.

I bring 8 logs when I do a run and always make at least  60k. Great to do at work if you can

If you're the artist, good job! This is very well done!
---
What do you call mid level?
---
UIM note herbs on tool leprechauns for making potions.

No No no,

No dungeoneering.

It wasn't a skill, it was okay but no

We have old school to run away from RS3, to make different content

If you want stuff from RS3 so bad, go play RS3

Nope keep on the lookout for them, I‚Äôve seen a few in my travels and always hate when I can‚Äôt catch them

Unfair comparison; we have Mod Ash, they have nothing.

Is this like a joke i don't get? It's perfectly healthy to have a fat on your body, like idk if your idea of a perfect woman is an anorexic or something

This. They should reduce servers by 40%. This would make areas more alive aswell as the wilderness.

Ever heard smokers warn other people not to smoke? It's like that
---
Due to how instance deaths work with retrieval of items, when you die at vorkath the items at zulrah will dissapear
---
Probably bludgeon to train str to about 94ish, then jump over to whip. Str lvls give you more dps in general, but after lvls 94 you need so much xp that you might as well start training att and def simultaniously

That's been my personal experience in the wild. Unless one of them is way better prepared and freezes them or has a team, it seems like they both go their separate ways. This story or pkers looking to attack pkers hasn't been my experience.

Fire cape at least. Personally I believe quest cape and zulrah are still mid level but I'm pretty sure most people disagree with me on that

There is nothing to bring back as Fist of Guthix never existed in OSRS.

Those were things that already existed in the code and/or easy to implement. Which doesn't appear to be the case for Fist of Guthix and other minigames.

Sure, but I also don‚Äôt see any reason why there couldn‚Äôt be a pet for every popular activity in the game.  Doesn‚Äôt take anything away from anyone‚Äôs experience if they add them

Well it doesn‚Äôt hurt to get Ibans in the meanwhile, then you‚Äôll have it once you are able to effectively do barrows

I'd agree with you there. I'm CB 105 with QC, hard diaries and total of 1770, still view myself as mid-level

lol they are a godsend and have massively improved my gpa. i actually feel sorry for anyone who doesn't take them.

make sure you have ammunition

I will add you my name is no bqnking

Someone didn't play classic wow lol
---
Es ist Mittwoch, meine Kerle
---
Congrats!! I‚Äôm currently on a mobile only account (Level 70 with 164 quest points). I‚Äôm hoping to get that achievement as well!
---
Spend 7 bucks on a bond
---
Beginner clues are such shit
---
A random guy says here's a random guy with 99 str, so it's a little confusing even if you did read it correctly lmao
---
Stop being a downer. Stop projecting. Leave.
---
Ah. I thought he was talking specifically about Chambers, rather than TOB, but yes. You can spectate in ToB for the tracks.
---
Seems like it's in every single video now
---
Well it goes both ways, he and the other JMods at the time gave what seemed like more attention to Emily in terms of banning people who were harassing her, but when they released the chatlogs of what people said it was IMMEDIATELY clear that they were in the right (death threats, threats of violence, etc.)
---
Ironman btw
---
its like someone saying ill pay you $5 for that $10 and then agreeing to it
---
You are very illegal.
---
You‚Äôve got ports and crap orts
---
I pked my gf at revs
---
Just go with it.
---
As who
---
Shit.
---
Really tedious, pretty bad XP. It's only worth doing for Auto-weed.
---
Do Auto-Weed, it's the best shit ever.
---
What about sheep herder i legit almost punched my laptop
---
Well i'll be damned
---
Shit
---
Yeah. He gave the noob his sword once he hit 70 attack. Useless to him now.
---
nah, wildy is dead so i never run into them especially on 1.5k+ total worlds.
---
You collected some of the cash when the offer was part completed
---
Thanks!  Good luck!  Let me know if you have any questions on the upcoming tougher quests and doing them on mobile.  I used wiki for 95% of them, and used slayermusiq for some of the boss fights.
---
That probably wouldn‚Äôt be good for new players or returning players unaware of the polling system/how to vote.
---
He knows
---
Dude. No one without that kind of stats has a chance at competing. You obviously understand.
---
I started in classic as well. In fact before they put the tutorial island in the game, can‚Äôt really relate to the OPs post
---
made one from gran torino

Is it wrong to talk on 2k total worlds or something?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Hahah
---
I don‚Äôt get how people could leave the chat off. You come across some right hilarious shit sometimes.
---
I made this yesterday and deleleted it becasue i thought it was hidden for some reason, unless someone had the exact same idea you've probably seen this one, even though i had no upvotes so i find it hard to believe it was on front
---
99 thieving, didnt get him lol
---
most ratters are going for guerilla tactics.  they wait till you log off with good stuff in your inventory, then quickly log and steal it.  if you have 100 clients in your network, trying to get bank pins for each (with RS's complicated pin system) is just tooo much.  plus the big catch was the tbow, whoever took it was quite happy with just that score.
---
sell what you have left, buy some new games and wait for group ironman, come back &amp; play :-)
---
Kay
---
I respectfully disagree. I think the essence of 2007 is gone as well mostly due to players just being more informed from sources like wiki, YouTube, reddit and twitch. Everything is about efficiency and people get overworked about everything. Imo runescape has changed in all aspects. I dont feel attached to this community the way I used to. But I still love osrs.

oldschool runescape
---
Fuck that fally range tho even with markers
---
The dog joins you because he likes solving clues you dummie
---
Maybe he's too busy taking over your spot
---
change it to a black chin and then put a skull above franks car for more depth
---
Roommate got food poisoning... twice
---
The game never acknowledges this tho, you‚Äôre considered some jackass who runs around messing stuff up, butting in when you‚Äôre not needed. But yes, you are the living legend.
---
I used to enjoy Fist of Guthix, but I'm not a huge fan of it being added into OSRS. And if they did intend to, they should consider a complete rework of it.
---
oooohhhh, Its been a while since I've done the quest. Does one get lose in the area and you have to find it and kill it?
---
Jesus christ I cannot imagine playing this much.
---
De-yeet this
---
You've got food poisoning yet planning to go out for dinner (at a place where someone other than you controls the quality of the food)?? Stay home my dude and heal up before exposing yourself to the potential to encounter a double dose of poisoning
---
Thanks!
---
Have you guys tried vorkath on mobile? I tried it while being at school and it was tough.
---
Damn didn't realize how much lamer it is with him not replying
---
Good to know!
---
I find regular trees are a waste of my time. Quest and herb runs for exp, and do fruit tree runs. Less frequent but more exp per run
---
Yep, I made a picture for cooks assistant as well, it‚Äôs sorta buried in my reddit history tho. I gotta make a deviant art or something haha
---
Check out maniacal monkeys, it's extremely low effort for how good the XP is.
---
Equipped: ring of dueling, crafting cape if you have it
---
Inventory: kruk greegree, 27 banana baskets
---
Ring of dueling to the duel arena, glider to karamja, run south into dungeon, then north across the monkey bars and into the cave. Hop on a demonic gorilla, take a banana out, set up a trap. Leave your sound on and then AFK until you hear a monkey screech (this happens whenever the trap is activated). Just take out another banana and reset the trap.
---
You can last for about an hour before you have to bank and go back (which takes about a minute). Significantly more AFK than using bones to banana tabs. XP rates scale from ~75k at level 70 to around 115k at 99.
---
&gt;Why make it harder and more of a hassle? Does that make playing a game fun?
---
Have you heard of ironman mode?
---
More please!
---
Tweet jagex
---
That picture at the bottom with the flex is gonna make him CEO!
---
The halo devalues my no MM2 only ironman.
---
Thats being very specific for loot thats straight trash. Thats like saying ‚Äúomg i got 2 guams, then an avantoe, then a ranaar seed, then 2 more guams from abberant spectres. Literally 1 in 10 million i get it in that order!‚Äù
---
I think it does make the game a lot of fun when you're trading with people. There's an excitement when you're interacting with them. There's negotiating the price, the trust between two people, sometimes people trying to outwit you, and you trying to outwit them, and there's communication.
---
Can't believe sparc mac/ Archie drama was like 10 years ago

Are you soloing VM or are you finding teams? I went to the themed world and it was dead :(

No he's "shaking my head my head"
---
The good old days
---
I got bad food poisoning a few weeks ago. It didn‚Äôt stop me from playing RS because I just farm runs and bird house runs. I just set an alarm every 50 minutes and logged in on mobile. Easy exp and some of the best naps ever.
---
Wow, you know you can use prayer points right
---
Charity volunteer? Xp waste mate cmon lad
---
Currently in the fally rooftops phase, so I agree fuck that course
---
I've done a few hundred vorkath kc on mobile with max gear/dhcb and it's doable just fine. Very rarely will miss the crumble undead but it's more accurate than I assumed it would be before starting. IMO very doable.
---
I get that's a legitimate point, but personally I want a game to be more about the content and not just nostalgia. OSRS has a good thing going, rolling off of nostalgia into actual new, popular content, but realistically it's gonna be hard getting new players (not impossible) into the game if the graphics aren't updated. And by that I mean just updating older, 2004-era models to look newer, not a whole new graphics engine like 2010 runescape
---
You wouldn't use a comma before "but also" in your first sentence. When you use a comma before the conjunction "but", you're indicating the start of a new clause. "Also poor English" is not a complete clause -- it lacks a predicate. Please think before you post stupid comments on the internet.
---
I see what you mean but how long will people want to play on those servers. Examples I think of would be RSC. How many people actual played that? Most were bots of course but that's just because people would play for nostalgia for a few days then might not play the game for a long time. Just look at the example on OSRS we have also. The single DMM world that almost no one uses because why not just play Seasonal.
---
for me it was definitely worth it. a cannon is something you will want to use a lot of training ranged and slayer and is an important item for a midlevel main account to get.
---
Osrs.wiki I believe has an optimal quest guide for newer accounts. Your first goal should be getting barrows gloves, which means finishing the quest 'recipe for disaster'. This will not only give you a BiS pair of gloves but also train your stats that you will end up needing, and completing quests that you will need too. Overall its a win win, you unlock something important whilst getting your account trained up. 
---
As for stuff like money making and revs, dont do revs. You would only be able to kill the imps, and thats considering the world is empty and no one else is there to try and kill them too. Your stats are much to low for revs - and imo they arent worth it anyway because clans are flooded there, you will have to run and tele literally every other kill. Making good money is going to be difficult early on without having better stats. I recommend using the wiki to look through the numerous guides it has or check out YouTube as people have made a lot of new account guides for money making also.
---
Conglaturation.
---
There was something about a scale theory, like in the book it takes an army six months to march from Al Kharid to Morytania, whereas for a player, it's like a five minute run.
---
Sorry, I misspoke there. You do not talk or crash in 2k worlds. Two seperate things
---
lets compare alpha levels, you go first
---
Obvious troll trying to put on the "anti Muslims" debate. Disgusting.  
---
Back 10 years ago trolls were actually hard to find, not as easy and retarded as this fuck /u/WorldlyProduce.
---
Thank you. I think I actually had this exact same argument with the exact same person yesterday.
---
‚ÄúChair House‚Äù is better than most of the auto generated names out there. Still shite though!
---
This is not the answer you're looking for but it is true- if you have an older phone, you may just be fucked. I have a galaxy s8+ and I can put the app in the background just fine. My brother's $40 ghetto ass android can't even minimize the app without logging off. Newer phones have more processing power and can handle more background applications.
---
Thank you! Had a great time
---
That's the point of suggestion is to see if other people do. Never did I assume that this is what people wanted. Did I suggest removing the GE completely? No, but good try on using your reading skills. Thanks and have a nice day.
---
Depends! What are your combat stats, what are your goals, have you done any quests yet?
---
The bloodworm thing would be a cool barrows pet
---
So you wanna fit into square boxes or what?
---
Explorer ring 4, get them free high alchs
---
Nice tyler1 reference
---
i like it but respawning at Lumbridge sucks. It‚Äôs worth the 5m it costs to respawn in edgeville.
---
frogs/rats in lumbridge swamp are a low level alternative
---
the minotaurs in stronghold are decent for melee with addy gear or ranged from like 20+ since you can safespot
---
hill giants and moss giants from there but they are usually crowded
---
The point is creating a balance between having the GE as this all access hub and creating player trading for some items. Can you see the difference between the two? I hope so.
---
wintertodt is technicly the most efficient way to get 60 woodcutting since u also get firemaking xp
---
i tried that and gave the guy 10k. he bailed.
---
U mfs when you die as hcim
---
I'm level 22 attack, level 24 strength, level 15 defence. I'm trying to be able to complete the demon slayer quest.
---
yeah bro its not so bad, its just so bad that you have to avoid actually playing the game at all costs while getting it, great game design
---
USA world cba doing TOB on 200 ish ping
---
Talking to a gipsy, for one, is a good example of money doublers irl.   
---
I mean it's the same thing: you willingly give up your money to someone who promises you something that is either improbable or plain impossible.
---
Actual most efficient: 1.5t teaks that you grew on fossil island
---
Next most efficient: 2t teaks on ape atoll
---
Then 3t teaks anywhere
---
Then non tick manip teaks anywhere

thanks il try

I once tried to a scam a scammer but he beat me in 3 steps.
---
That man is Uri Molotov !! Remember the nameeeee
---
HERE HERE
---
It's really the worst to get to. But the wiki tells you exactly how so maybe look there?
---
A similar thing happened to me too. Someone drop traded a green d'hide body and 10K to themselves and I happen to pick up first before they even logged back in. They said they would report me if I didn't give it to them and then I accidentally traded them all the money I had(which wasn't a lot back then but to me it was) and they didn't give it back. I was a fearful noob back in the day.
---
d
---
The berserker shields that noobs never charged lol. Uncharged was like the same as mith kite.
---
I think the characters look a little goofy. The bosses, animations, and areas look pretty damn sweet.
---
Yes I most certainly do and I think I also explained my mistake well enough a couple hours ago.
---
This is called real world trading and it is against the rules. You're gonna have to look up some weird illegitimate forums to do this
---
This is awesome
---
Slayer good
---
Big oof.
---
There are plenty of gold/item sinks in the game right now, theres just no reason to artificially keep prices up like that.
---
Yeah, me too. Would end the opioid crisis

Na it's way older than that
---
Why would you want to put an update into the game if it *wasn‚Äôt* something the majority wanted? Isn‚Äôt that what updates are for? And did I ever suggest that you suggested the complete removal of the GE? No. I said it would be foolish to have an update that places restrictions on things that only a small percentage of the community would agree upon, and I drew on the GE‚Äôs poll results from a few years ago to back up my claim that the majority of people enjoy the convenience and ease of use of the GE. Anything hindering those qualities would likely be rejected before even getting to the polling stage. Maybe instead of trying to insult my comprehension skills, you should use your own. Sorry to even have provided any feedback in the first place. Lmao.
---
Or just don't misclick lmao, and switching your bank settings takes literally one second.
---
How about we keep the game old school instead? RS3 has some pretty nice graphics. Try it out.
---
Link for the bros?
---
the game will already play yourself as you watch, but if you don't care for the direction the game is going you can always just quit
---
I put my personal PIN number in at the ATM machine.
---
whip is bad for training str because it doesn't have a strength training option.
---
And here‚Äôs me... spent 29 days in total over the last 5331 days
---
That's pretty unhealthy, ngl...
---
Right , 12 year old me farming varrock guards to 94 str would be dumbfounded by how I play now lol
---
Thanks for the reply! How do you train in NMZ at length? I always die pretty quick, and I don‚Äôt have the points to get over load potions yet.
---
If only Riot would learn this.
---
How about we beat you until you lose weight you piece of shit
---
That is the number 2007!
---
What about my osrs gf
---
Improve your spawnpoint
---
I agree. I stopped playing runescape because i just grinded slayer for like a week or twodoing nothing else in game and i just cant bring myself to login anymore. Been maybe a couple months now
---
Nice!
---
Back in November I got hellpup from cerb around 780 kc.. went to herbiboar after.. did about 20 kills and said I was gonna break at 1k kc.
---
1k kc and I got the herbi pet too! All in the span of three hours I got two pets.
---
I‚Äôve been dry on pets since.. lol.
---
Someone actually buries a chest with items within. Smart thinking!

Happy birthday Chris Archie!

If I would suggest something, is to do like Blizzard and ask for real IDs and documents when someone is trying to recover the account or password, at least one of your document will match with account details, chat log or something. My friend got his smartphone stolen and lost the authenticator, Blizzard asked for real ID to recovery the account, together with a lot of question about the account data, just by seeing he trying to recovery his own account, I was relieved because I was sure if any person besides the true owner won't have the answer for a lot of questions Blizzard questioned.
---
I think he knows we can look at his post history, just because he can benefit from it doesn't mean it's a good or bad suggestion. Let's focus on that
---
he lost his void lmfao
---
MM2 and DS2 were pretty much the only real annoyances in retrieving the quest cape. Which is ironic, since they weren't initially in the game.
---
The game is far more satisfying to play when you can actually understand what the fuck is going on and how to play
---
By that very definition mining only accounts shouldn‚Äôt be voting on the rest of the game
---
Hahaha.  Got a legit laugh from me.
---
Yea, 2008 HD right when god wars came out was fuckin' glorious.
---
Was it ever great? Not really. Mostly scammers.
---
&gt;he lost his void lmfao
---
sucks for the venez pig B)
---
When some random guy with a green phat starts slaughtering you in the middle of the city
---
Definetely not a metal guy myself, but this sounded really good man, hope you do more!
---
So did we just forgive this guy after abusing his powers to whiteknight girl streamers?
---
We will expand on that topic in a future blog, we've mentioned it in this blog because we want to be transparent and open about some of the things we'd like to explore further. Lost items return (or lack of it) is a common criticism aimed at us, so it's only right that we listen to that feedback and see what we might be able to do to help. It really is early stages though, but for now you can be assured that we will give it very careful consideration and consider all implications.
---
some people enjoy making plans and following them to see good progression
---
He lost ultimate status like three seasons ago
---
and dg
---
When 2008 HD first came out (right around the same time as god wars) I thought they did a good job of maintaining the style and making it look better.
---
But you're right they kept changing the style after that and making it worse. It all started with changing how the d scim and whip looked and it just went downhill from there.
---
build the ditch! build the ditch!
---
Time to run it back.
---
i mean that's assuming they arent removing at a 1:1 or more rate. restoring stolen items requires removing stolen items from the hijacker.
---
if they have to spawn a tbow they also should be deleting a bow from the GE.
---
ex player 1 hacked for bow. player 2 steals bow, sells it for rsgp. new system gives player 1 a bow. perms player 2 (removes 1b gp from game) and then deletes a bow from the ge (fills for actively traded price and bow is gone).
---
Its mod ash
---
Mod Ash must have an incredible meme hoard
---
MEP2 would like a word, also rag and bone man 2
---
Weird as he's like 2k years older
---
its so bad i upvoted it
---
I think that such commies should be interrogated, alternatively quarantined if they appear as a threat
---
Yeah, I played pre-GE days as well. I started back when RS was in its oddly charming cardboard cutout graphics. Then they did the RS2 update.
---
In those days, it was a bit overwhelming being in game and having to constantly find someone to trade with. Hence why I thought the GE was a good update. I never used the forums, but I traded Rune Essence around the east Varrock bank and noticed that the prices fluctuated from 10 to 20 GP each without ever using the forums.  
---
However, when the GE was introduced, it solved a lot of problems by making items very easy to find, but it felt like a massive blow to the community aspect of the game. This is why I'm proposing a balance to having players interacting with each other while not drastically affecting the way the majority of players do their in-game trading.
---
That's a lot of fucking energy
---
Wtf idiots they are armor used irl in medieval times ommfg
---
Well first of all my girlfriend doesn't look like roadkill
---
I bet ash was that ultra intelligent guy as a youngster
---
Ouch, that was one [Dark Crab](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/8/81/Dark_crab_detail.png).
---
Looked so cool. Oh nostalgia
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeported
---
Reported for botting
---
Wtf uncle bill
---
They're still wasting time on zeah huh?
---
Pretty much just need those ruby (e) / diamond (e) switch, those are key. Get a good 3 ruby bolt procs in the fight and you're set. Also stack your inventory with sara brews and super restores.
---
Again? I thought that already happened last week.
---
I have found if you give them around 250k or less they will double it and trade back, then I just walk away. Has worked a few times, sometimes they run away too, it's a risk!
---
And that was the only issue with this idea! Gosh darn it, your genious mind has done it again.
---
No point wasting time and money chinning.. ranged is 0time using a cannon or doing tasks
---
What a wild fuckin ride that was
---
Because, I was ready to risk it all!
---
Isn't that bad with the volcanic mine discord though.
---
I got extremely lucky staking recently and turned 40m into just under 1b. I want to loan/give a friend a large part of that, at least 200m. He is a good friend and has loaned me gear and helped me out a lot in the past. 
---
The issue is that I've bought gold in the past. I told him this and he isn't concerned. Is there any risk to HIS account receiving a large sum of gold from an account that has bought gold before? I want to help him out but don't want to compromise his account.
---
No one is making you kill it my dude
---
Also you should've been using blowpipe or craws
---
To an extent. The first and last example don't really go that far. I only included the second example because it's something I think most here aren't familiar with, but that happens a lot. The majority of singles teams have at least one dedicated hacker/doxer.
---
17+82 = 99 though
---
I guess DCs will continue to be the #1 HCIM killer in RuneScape.
---
open what? no idea what that is
---
I only signed up for the 1 week trial today, and it already charged me. It didn‚Äôt even give me an extra week, it says I only have 31 days of membership.
---
I fell in to an opiate addiction a few years ago. Oxy and fent abuse for several years. So I know what addiction is like. With that out of the way, Runescape *can* be a crippling addiction in the same league as drug or alcohol addiction. It can cause the same estrangement from friends/family, loss of employment, poor diet, poor physical/mental health etc. Etc. More rare? Yes. But you *cannot* minimize computer/internet/RS addiction.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Nobody is saying that moving to a runescape addiction can't be a "step up" from drug/alcohol addiction in some cases. It *sure* can, and that is a great thing. But what we *are* saying is that playing runescape 11 hours a day for 3 months straight is fundamentally unhealthy, unless you're like afking all day at work or something. But the title is "I'm addicted and can't quit," so this likely isn't one of those cases.
---
I'm going to be honest man, it sounds like maybe you play a little too much RS, or have in the past, and feel on some level it is really unhealthy, but are trying to justify it with "well it's better than drug addiction;" then people on here are disrupting your justifications. I did this for a while after addiction. I felt justified in almost any habit/activity that wasn't opiate abuse. And that was fine for a while, and even healthy. But at a certain point, I had to step back and realize that the metric of "well at least I'm not railing footballs," was not something that was bringing me happiness.
---
I could be wrong in my guess about your situation, but that's okay because that *actual* point is that nobody is disagreeing with you when you say "RS addiction can be better as an alternative to drug addiction." We're just saying that it isn't a part of an overall healthy life in most cases.
---
Hey man cmon' now you know what happens when you assume
---
BLM
---
Hahaha yeah kraken boss trivialises the whole feel of what a kraken should be, was my first pvm pet though so has a place in my heart. I prefer prime to rex, but supreme is my favourite so i'm just chasing him whenever i do dks
---
I need this comment framed and on my wall for others to admire.
---
Yeah the subreddit not the game lol
---
I mean nobody knows exactly what jagex is or isn't detecting for rwt because if we knew, rwters could avoid it.
---
They're all "easy", to me it's just a matter of how long they take, and that one takes quite awhile.
---
It's the only part where it's not obviously a joke, you dumberino
---
Bruh its 11$
---
why is everything called racism now lmfao. Black people are as racist to white folks as whites are to blacks.
---
To be fair, the GE is a massive enabler for bots. Im not saying id wish it gone, I like the convenience, but I do think a lot of their fears were realized.
---
New desktop background, thx
---
It's long and annoying though, easily over an hour
---
in RS3 someone receivevd like a million archer rings. Crashed to alch value within a day the archer ring lmao.
---
You get charged immediately for the trial and if you cancel before the 7 day trial period is up then you‚Äôll be refunded.
---
Spoken like someone whose only worked entry level jobs for 6 months at a time.
---
maybe to avoid hackers and losing items, give people the option to SOULBIND items (so they can't be dropped, traded, also not used in PvP areas ofcourse)
---
I just got a beaver on my hardcore at 47 sc while chopping normal trees, I think it was 1 in 317000
---
It's gotten to the point where anything besides telos is basically dead
---
this looks like a wikihow thumbnail for something like ‚Äúhow to get over dying to a PKer‚Äù lol
---
That is fundamentally wrong. You're making an absolute statement right now. You are saying that if someone knows the steps to beating addiction, they automatically *must* have the willpower, purpose, and drive. That is fucking asinine and I am amazed that you are so firm on an idea that is so fucking wrong. You seem like an idiot
---
bots were always selling their stuff, it makes no difference if it's a guy on the forums selling his 1m yew logs or someone selling them on the GE.

Some of us are secure enough with the choices we make to not be ashamed

Lol yeah. As a PvMer, I wish they'd add risk back into this game. This community's so entitled and self-centered. They downvoted 6 hour afk nerfs. You think they deserve to decide what is and isn't balanced?

Actually knew a guy called Jad in real life. It's an actual name.

Weren‚Äôt runes actually very rare before Rune Mysteries? Before that quest there hasn‚Äôt been a way to create runes in centuries so I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd have been rare.

---
there's a difference between flipping and muling, though the act of putting money on your flipping account could also be construed as muling, even if you're using that money to flip.
---
&gt; and that also assumes that all players have sufficient ID they could actually supply!
---
that's why you make it an optional feature.

I mean it's possible that Jagex will go way too far, but we don't know what they have in mind yet, let's wait and see what they propose.
---
I think you're right that the community isn't a total cesspool though--sure people do shitty things sometimes but there are plenty of commendable things that people do as well. You never explicitly said you think this but I assume this is the case because you disagreed with /u/Tehfennick.

There's nothing wrong with telling people about things you're passionate about and your personal achievements there. Especially today, having video games as your primary hobby isn't something that's looked down on by anyone but those with the most massive stick up their ass or people from like our parent's generation and older.
---
That being said, it'd be stupid to expect some fuckin fanfare because you told a random that you maxed on osrs, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. There's plenty of things in my life I've spent thousands of hours on for fun. Some of those things are video games, some of those things are sports, and others are leisure hobbies. I don't weigh the time spent doing any of those other things any greater or lesser than the time I spend on Runescape, and I don't think you should, either.

In the upcoming survey we will specifically ask for player views on toxicity, it is a complex issue that isn't just text based and does bleed into things like ragging and griefing, and everyone will have a different tolerance level and view on severity - we need to get those survey results to really understand any concerns the community have (if any) and then use those results to make informed decisions moving forwards

I have to give Jadex credit. They are one of the few games out there that actually listen to their player base.

If you would like to join a smaller chill clan, you can join mine - Pawn E4.  There's about 20 of us right now, with about 15 active daily.  We aren't a specialty clan like a PvP clan or something, more so just a small community of people.  With that being said, we still do some bossing and other things pretty frequently.

Fire capes 1m or less, demand would be high but the supply would be higher. Loads of people can do fight caves, myself included.
---
 As far as infernal goes, I would need to know how many people are willing and able to farm infernal capes. The initial price would be extremely high due to demand, both for use and pet rolls, so i think its fair to set 100m+ initially.
---
As more infernal capes are farmed into the game and the supply starts to meet the demand, the rate of which obviously depending upon the amount of willing and able farmers, they would probably fall to somewhere around a third to half the original price. Maybe lower.
---
Did they just come out with something new regarding the polling of warding? Or is this post 1-2 months behind?
---
I remember it was so frustrating at the time. The people that legitimately did not like emilyispro wanted her just to be forgotten, but as usual the drama fans made every thread and discussion about her. Until Mat K left, there was a good year or so where I completely forgot she even existed, was pretty nice.
---
Maybe hit enter instead.
---
Just auto click high alch, most afk you‚Äôre gonna get.
---
What‚Äôs easier for players or botters? Selling things inventories at a time, while double checking for scams? Having to take notes on market prices all manually?
---
Botters can automate that. So Jagex gives everyone a little automation, and it enables us too, to rival their power. And we see it. People flip all the time because of bots. They compete and we profit

Don‚Äôt think any of the XP items should enter the game. 2x the XP for wearing gloves is exactly how XP rates got to where they are in RS3.
---
Just after this was posted, after a week of standing 22 hours a day, they were both banned manually by a mod- they obviously use a macro to stay afk a lot of the time. It's easy to make more, but my biggest concern is running out of good names fast. Not sure what to do yet.
---
You should consider the extremely high initial demand. Of course that pricing wouldn't last long, probably not more than a few days, and smart players wouldn't be trying to buy them day 1 anyway. The GE price wouldn't be accurate for quite a while.
---
doesn't help :/ still 4
---
I think a lot of people view even cosmetic, non-gameplay items as a slippery slope towards MTX-only content and RS3 (which is loathed by many OSRS players). Any cosmetic items would need to be attainable in-game as well as throught MTX for them to even have a chance of passing a poll.
---
i bought skirt :/ but same stats so ok
---
That would be hard to type single handedly as you die
---
Mat looking like Little T
---
To add to this. If botters create a market (buyable tunes for example) yes we get locked out of some. The basic tunes are very not profitable. But but they are cheap for us in mass. When we get to higher level items, bots create a market, and then newbies can come in, but death tubes for cheap, and sell them while cutting the market that‚Äôs been established (and maintained so there‚Äôs ALWAYS a buyer) they get a little extra for helping a newer player, and the newer player doesn‚Äôt deal with switching worlds and trading with people (taking sometimes hours).
---
Going to sleep and waking up with a few extra K is so rewarding, and it makes you feel like your time in game is more valuable.
---
Which botters already have. Giving us a little isn‚Äôt a sin

but still i want to know when stock is back in normal

Thanks so much for all the feedback man I really appreciate it! Let me respond to each thing individually:
---
1. You're definitely completely right about this. I will be dedicating a large portion of next episode to figuring out a way to deal with this kind of stuff. I intend to make a document, either a google doc or spreadsheet, to keep track of everything I am backlogging, chunk requirements, etc. I intend to make this as thorough as it can possibly be, to avoid even the tiniest mistakes in the future. I really want to stick with the rules exactly as I set them out, and messing up even small things makes me really disappointed in myself.
---
2. As per the specifics of my rules, the 100 boat doesn't actually unlock anything that could be considered a chunk goal - it just makes getting the points faster, so I won't need to access the 100 boat.
---
3. Yeah lmaoooo I am not looking forward to that grind. I might just try to get as much as I can possibly get done before that grind, and wait until I absolutely need to before it becomes inefficient at a macro-level.
---
4. In my rules, I already defined what I consider to be an accessible chunk, and diagonal chunks are not considered accessible. It's an interesting idea, but I don't want to make a rule change unless absolutely necessary. There's already one small rule change I know I'll need to do, but I'll get into that in a video where it becomes relevant. As it turns out, my current rules about accessible chunks can actually lock me out of unlocking chunks EVER, which is a big problem. I'll go into the specifics in a video where it will affect me.
---
5. I am allowing myself to unlock chunks via non-teleport transportation methods. The problem with teleports is that they don't go both ways - I don't want to be able to soft-lock myself and have the home teleport be my only way out. I do, however, have a portal to castle wars from clan wars, and since that goes both ways, I can use this.
---
Again, thanks so much for all the feedback, and I appreciate you watching the series so carefully and bringing me some ideas!

You can, just post your blocklist, which tasks you use expeditious/slaughter, and the rates you get for those tasks.

You'll be hard-pressed to name anything, from even something as benign as drinking water, that if done irresponsibly and without thought for your well-being can have disastrous consequences. There's a big difference between spending 2000 hours on a video game over the span of 6 months and spending the same 2000 hours over the course of two years.
---
But if you want to cherrypick examples of extreme behavior to support your side, I won't stop you. 
---
However, I do think that it's unwise and downright ignorant to jump to conclusions about someone's hobby just because people exist that take the hobby to extremes to the detriment of their health, and this is often disproportionately targeted at people who play video games. I personally know people who have permanently damaged parts of their body due to something related to sports or who have chronic injuries due to training irresponsibly, but I don't know a single person who has injuries related to gaming, and I know people in both camps.
---
In short, if you hear someone say "I maxed in runescape" and you automatically think that they are unhealthy for it without knowing anything else about their hobby, you're an asshole.

No you can do this with vr. There's a program I used a couple years back called bigscreen. It's on steam and free, there may be better ones now idk, but basically it puts you in a VR environment of your choice. I liked playing in a large movie theater with osrs on the big screen. I had 2 floating screens sitting near me for Google and whatever else I wanted.

Ignore lists don't prevent you from regularly running into *different* people being obnoxious, and blocking specific words does little to people who are determined to say awful things. Not to mention, a chat filter can't tell the difference between friends cursing in casual conversation and a hateful tirade. If somebody is making the game less enjoyable for everyone around them, why exactly should Jagex let them keep playing?
---
I'm not saying trash talking and banter should be banned, but when people are talking about how they're going to find somebody irl and rape them, or telling them to die of aids etc, I think we would all be better off without those people in the community.
---
Because most people don't memorize someone's birthday who they never met/will never meet.

The main reason a lot of us are in the no changes camp is that the Blizzard devs have changed to develop in a 180 direction from where it was, with a "you think you do but you don't" attitude that still pops up now and then. If we had confidence I'm sure a lot more people would be on board with them getting some content into classic that would be built around the old school design philosophies... but given the state of the modern game I don't think even the optimist can fault people for being cautious.

If you‚Äôre meleeing dust devils you should be in the smoke dungeon, not catacombs. Catacombs are multi for the purpose of barraging, meleeing there is a waste of the spot and someone else coming is understandable. Smoke dungeon is single which is good for melee

I really appreciate this post, I try my hardest to tell people that these updates aren't gonna kill the game, but they all say it's making it worse. "It's not old school" is such a BS argument (sorry for my own gatekeeping, I'm not blind to it)

Hello guys,
---
I have no idea how this happened but my recovery questions and most of my info was changed on my account after i quit for couple months, Came back to play recently since I just finished first year university and its the summer and I was hoping to start playing Runescape again like the old days and i couldn't log in. Tried recovering and all i see is that my account has different recoveries! Ive played all my life and never thought you could change them on a account... I'm very sad to see this happen as I put so many hours of my time to this game that I love. Ive still tried sending recoveries in and it just kept getting denied one after another! I just hoping if there's any way i could get it back i have all the info to the account, first and old passwords, first email,transaction ids, I've had this account for years over 8-9 years. I know the info I have to the account is correct because I've sent in a request before and they were ACCEPTED! I just wanna play again and not have this issue on Runescape to be afraid of coming back one day and seeing all my hard work hacked and stolen from me for someone else to enjoy!
---
 I know most jmod's are busy and I was hoping if any one could take 10 minutes and just take a look over this as I was hacked somehow and the person who hacked me, changed all my recovery questions and etc. Check all the info on my account. If you could just have a look you would see this is really my account! I will provide all info I have to the account. 
---
If there's any other area I should go please let me know!
---
The catacombs are very close to a bank and an altar, and the bones with a bonecrusher extend prayer. I don't really see how the smoke dungeon is better.
---
Love the creativity for Nieve between the halo and the heart
---
Also fun little trick videomakers used to use to make characters face each other without trading; use the low level bind/ confuse/ weaken spells from your spellbook on another person. Even if you don't have the runes required, your character will still face that direction.

Whitelisted servers are the servers that had people do the interview process. If you passed the interview, you got whitelisted and we‚Äôre able to join.

Reminds me of way back in the classic days where I busted my ass to get a green halloween mask by trading all of my stuff away to afford it.

I only had black robes and the mask on and got caught up at black knights fortress and got killed trying to run. This pretty much sums up my feels back then.

Welcome to the internet
---
Nah, this is 2007scape subreddit.
---
I'm an old man (36) and just started playing again about 2 months ago. I remember having like 10 web pages pulled up when I originally played 15+ years ago. OSB gives me the highlights on where to click for agility and what fishing spots I can fish for certain things without having to click. Does Runelite have that ability as well?
---
"For the love of Guthix Niles!!! ... Yes!! That is a fish!!!..."
---
No
---
These RWTers are getting good
---
Confirmed not working just now.
---
Would be cool to be able to do this without ever having to re-enter info.
---
Yes, RuneLite has everything OSBuddy has because it's open source and someone just clones or adds to a plugin if one doesn't already exists.
---
In the first book the protagonist is tasked with fixing a piece of jewelry made of runite, her adamant sword doesn't even scratch it. But her sword also cuts through steel armor easily.

Personally I think it pushes the line. Most of the time when people get dox they use them for a fucked up reason, not to lightly poke fun at someone.

It's an incredible experience. I played RS as a kid, but I don't remember fighting Elvarg. I did it last year on my new account and I felt like a champion! It's such a wonderful feeling, but I wanted to capture the stress of the fight in this image which seems to be what everyone feels!!

I will have to download it tonight when I get home and try it.

---
Yep. You have to install openjdk-\* and then you just launch the .jar as a parameter in the command line. It runs at 2FPS if you turn everything off, so it's perfect for woodcutting, bank standing, and MLM and such.

Sorry if it read like a suggestion, but i was generally asking if there was currently a way to do that.
---
I thought that one was 420 q p
---
No reason at all, the extra effort far outweighs the cost
---
You misunderstood me. It doesn't matter if you stream vods. 
---
You link your runescape account to twitch requiring 1000 total. You cannot stream under the oldschool section until you do this. If you get banned off twitch, the osrs account is "banned" from being connected to twitch so you can't reuse the same account. It has nothing to do with runescape gameplay.
---
hmm. apparently the subreddit thingy thinks your still a jmod since there is that j-mod reply. but the bot seems to be updated for your status already.
---
hoy u/crazydavy u/cheesydude u/umdlye you might wanna fix this
---
If you make a special build like a pure and do qiests, you gotta do your research before hand. 
---
I know the pain. I ruined a near maxed level 3 once because i was rushing. Very sad. But thats my fault.
---
Caught gourmet instead :(
---
The biggest crime here is you wearing a skillcape
---
You formatted it in a code block
---
    Like this    
---
Try deleting the spaces preceding your first line, or using the code &lt;&gt; button.
---
No I don‚Äôt want fucking zapper cheers.
---
ironmen/dmm doesn't matter. It's not like you lost access to your main account. You can also add an exception that partnered streamers don't need the requirement so if a csgo streamer wants to try out osrs, its possible to stream without any osrs requirements
---
I will. I have an authenticator on my account too.

Looks like Photoshop to me.

I hope its about Durial626.

people will never believe me, but I too was at the fally massacre.

the bloodshed that day still haunts my dreams.
---
yo is that a pq pet?
---
In the time it takes to max you could teach yourself 2-3 languages, im not sure which is more a feat to be proud of but whatever makes u happy is always worth doing :p
---
this is what photoshop looks like to you?
---
I know, sorry (':

PQ?
---
Loveable Art, B A A A M, Holy Invoker... I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting. I was a general for the first one.
---
Imo it should be a flying pet suiting the swamptheme, blackbird, owl or bat.
---
this pet also should be following the strange old man wandering on top of the mounds cause i think that's where you should get your pet from. imagine the barrowschest dropping lorepages about the barrowsbrothers to fill up a book for the strange old man. When complete you can trade it in for a chance at the pet.

Lmao just yesterday I went from  mort'on to the new place that starts with a p (I'm really old school player) to karamja back to canifis and finally had to get my agility high enough to make it to steel dragons...for fucking 5 purple sweets and a god damn hat
---
I wish they had some some of the osrs bosses in mhw
---
Your not making any variety changes if the gear for 20 def is so crazy good offensively that it‚Äôs worth getting, which would make 40 defense even more pointless, the niche your trying to describe doesn‚Äôt have a place in pvp system based around combat levels
---
how does he not have any dragon thrownaxes or knives????

Makes you wonder how many bots have incredible pet ring that we will never know about.

Learn how to do yanillian hops runs, they are better gp than any herbs you can do for a while

He‚Äôs right, try it for yourself. If you splash after 20 mins *you* stop attacking but the rat continues attacking you, therefore keeping you logged in for 6 hours. Or until someone hits the rat.

Alright thanks mate!

I'm working on agility and mining as 2 of my last skills for base 90s myself. Funny how I always seem to "coincidentally" take a break from the game any time I need to grind out one of those two. Slow and steady does it tho.
---
Having an odd legacy 2003 server is actually fairly common in places (not that I'm saying it's ok).
---
And tell me how a PvP key system/emblem system that is balanced around ~500k an hour is going to be abused more than the current bots?
---
You can purchase 10x zulrah accounts for around $200, and suicide bot them over the weekend for 50m profit PER ACCOUNT. Literally every worthwhile boss in runescape is responsible for bringing massive amounts of gold into the game via alchables alone (not including uniques), please don't bother telling me that something like this hurts PvP. 100% of PvP interaction outside of BH is already a net loss in GP (supplies and untradeables dropping values below their worth to repair/buy), whereas I'd say 99.9% of PvM interactions are a net gain in GP.
---
It's not that it doesn't run on Unix based systems, it's that the plugin currently requires OpenGL 4.3 to run and Mac dropped support for OpenGL versions past 4.1.  There's some work being done to replace the compute shaders used in 4.3 and their GLSL to OpenCL but it may be some time.

Are u actually entertained by the clip then or ?

wow thanks for the insightful reply that didn't answer the question.  Congrats on passing high school econ.

If any of these stories are at all accurate and jamflex is seriously letting people recover accounts with just ONE old password, thats fucking insanely terrible. I mean Jesus. Never known a worse support gaming company when it comes to shit like this lol. 
---
Also - bank pin is 100% the best way to save your items. To answer you OP, theres a multitude of things that could be going on. Scan your PC for viruses for one, if you haven't..second, idk if you can or not but update your recovery questions and set a difficult password.

God I hate upvote memes. A lot of subreddits have cracked down on them, but you can still see "Upvote if" slip through.
---
What a unit.
---
Fabulous. Really hope we can see more from you, you've got a fan in me.
---
"Officer, he left me completely naked, except for my wallet, shirt, and socks!" 
---
"Dude, fair game, you attacked first."
---
You're just mad cause your facial complexion wasn't as pure as theirs.
---
It's okay though, you're still a cutie.
---
The stagnation of memes at me_irl is just indicative of our lives slowly grinding to a halt, where the idealistic pursuit of new and exciting things fades out with the lethargy of unfulfilling and menial routine, leaving us only wanting to live out those glory days of the classic memes and wishing for a day when our depression memes were still ironic in nature.
---
Works for me on Linux Mint with the latest Mesa drivers. However it toggles off every time I restart the client, and you kinda have to spam the toggle button to get it to turn on for some reason.
---
After that it works great though.
---
Inferno is definitely a high jump that not a lot of geared players are even capable of doing. Start with some smaller challenges, perhaps a checklist of requirements for quests, some elite diaries, Raids 1 or 2, and then work from there.
---
I personally found Lumbridge Elite to be very rewarding due to how often I used fairy rings, and getting prepped and then hopping into ToB was a challenging but rewarding experience too.
---
Linux support all the way!
---
Yes verf and I both thought it was funny
---
Life long Fluency in german or 99 slayer is defo a tricky one.. maybe somewhere in between!
---
Congrats man!
---
are you asking if you can out dps the healers with 98 range and dragon darts? depending on your gear and if you're on task, yes you can, but it really isn't that hard to line up the healers. i'm also not sure if you'd be up to doing a dart switch if you're "dreadful at flicking," but you do you. bring chins to tag the healers all at once then do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_eCUNtUMt8) to get them all in a line. practice in nmz if you'd like.
---
remember you also have, like, twelve years to switch prayers correctly. jad's animations are ridiculously long. log out before jad and make yourself some tea or jerk off or something to calm your nerves. pray rigour or whatever your equivalent is through the entire fight, focus on your switches, and don't panic pot.
---
you've got this dude, don't sweat it.
---
Nice man, first fire cape is a solid achievement.
---
So anyway what the fuck is up with your post history and, as a follow up, what happened ~6 months ago to break you out of whatever that is and into runescape?
---
Man inflation is too real. Back in the day gfs only cost 10k! Jamflex needs to institute a universal basic income so that everyone can afford such basic necessities
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the item value for drops and monster HP. Also agility click spots. I could probably go on for hours about this...
