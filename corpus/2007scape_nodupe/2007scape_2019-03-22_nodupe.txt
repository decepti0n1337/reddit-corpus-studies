Chinning and barraging also cost a lot 
---
Beyond watching the whole Q/A, is there a way to know if a specific question got answered?
---
Yeah I know about Dinhs, but if it's not a dedicated leech team, in funs I'm just going to Dinhs/MSB 90% of the time.  It's just hard to throw a Dinhs spec given it only has a singular attack style.
---
Nice try, but we all know girls that play OSRS don't exist, she is clearly a robot, hence the ban.
---
lmao you play with DOLLS?? it's 2018 dude, grow up nerd!!!
---
Does anyone know the XP rates of temple trekking per hour? 
---
Yes let me just pull out my wand from my bag of tricks and recover your account for you. 
---
Like bruh what do you want us to do?

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked ultimate ironman. After recently ironman I decided to forge my own journey No banking, no time I can't leave maxing my ultimate up the anti, and from scratch. trading, but this Morytania.
---
Ok then?
---
Hello
---
I'm not able to login into the mobile game. I have a 3 month subscription which renewed on February 27th 2019. It will next renew on May 28, 2019. When I try to log on mobile I get the message "You are standing in a members-only area. To play in this world move to a free area first." It shows this no matter what world I choose free world or member world. I am a member but I don't know how even if I wasn't I can move to a free area if I can't log in. Just any ideas would be much appreciated.
---
Since you would have to start from scratch, I think it would be fair for all your items and xp to be transferrable to the main game
---
Which is what the main player base wants but that doesn‚Äôt gain subscriptions, especially when the established base is more likely to have the GP to buy bonds. 
---
Thanks for brightening up my life. Be well 
---
I like this idea of a membership reward better than Gp tbh
---
H
---
You dropped amulet of the damned? Won't that take a really long time to get again?
---
They just pointed out your argument is flawed. Don't be salty you're a moron. 
---
Use BP on task I range,  I have done nmz with msb and Addy arrows,  figured that was quicker than RCB,  buy the XP per hour I was getting was slow,  I did have it on custom rumble hard,  tree spirit black demon,  me,  warlord,  and count Draynor
---
Spock is rolling in his grave 
---
May you link the clip please? 
---
I agree, maybe free membership for a month or so might be a better idea
---
Its interesting content thats well made but this sub has an annoying habit of taking anything remotely funny and running it straight into the ground. I enjoyed the videos but most of the hype is memes
---
lololol for the people who do not know  the "woman" in the middle is a trans woman i.e she got a pen15 
---
her name is  "blaire white" on YouTube if you wanted to know 
---
The disrespect to Zezima... Zezima will always be the greatest.

If only your rsn wasn't the worst of the worst :( üÖ±epsi is awful and koalas are literal mega aids, otherwise congrats I'm jealous of your rc pet :(
---
IDK smelting via Blast Furnace seems to be profit so probably good if you're on a budget and Darts/Knives/Bolts seem to be a small loss for okay mid-level exp. Not sure what the question is though?

Fuuuuck bro that‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôm so happy for you though. Massssive bonds for life ü§£ keep it up. Once I get out of the hospital I‚Äôm gonna finish up my crafting grind and hop right into 87 slay

Hope you get kicked out of your clan

Rs3 is 2013, oshd was 08! Graphics didn't kill rs, eoc did.
---
Upvote for visibility? Idk what to do. I have credentials to prove it's me but if I don't have the email or can't get a hint from customer support then I'm shit outta luck. I just saw people coming here for account support and thought I'd try. There's been a couple of these posts that have had 100+ upvotes.

Thank you!

This is my first big addition to a runelite plugin.

Yes

The baddies part makes it kind of interesting I think

thanks happy to hear your liking them so far!

Yeesh. Save more man

You‚Äôre best bet is to find one used in that price range

What‚Äôs your beep test score?

Those few moments when you sit there and watch your health rapidly reducing knowing full well how stupid you really are. Haha feels man
---
How about u google or youtube it genius
---
When I did green dragons that‚Äôs what I did as well. If someone did attack me I ran south then teleported but I never used a bot so maybe some of them are just regular people.

Graphics is not content

steps to produce?

Royal seed pod. From mm2

So when i sent a bug report and tried again to give the answer for challenge, this time it showed my damn password in the up left corner which i blurred.
---
who?
---
Woooo'oo woo woooo, wooo ooo woooo!
---
I had a pure once I completely forgot the details to.  
---
If you submit a ticket on their website (ignore the trolls saying its twitterscape etc), Jagex can provide you with an email of all the logins you've been associated with.  
---
That's how I managed to find my old pure :)
---
This looks like fucking shit. However, if they ever wanted to put this in game, as long as it's togglable, I don't really care. 
---
Don't be an asshole
---
I have never botted and hope all who bot get banned to be honest. Anyways if I was to code one I would probably set something like click on random roll so I would call the click and then do a simple java random or something like that and have it pick between .5 - 2 seconds. Each click would then be slightly staggard and I assume Human like.
---
EVScape got shit for trading gear to his "from scratch" account, B0aty did not do that.
---
Deez nuts ü•ú 
---
I'm sure the 12% playerbase participation rate is the real issue here.
---
If you don't want to vote because of some flimsy notion of bias that's entirely on you.
---
The fact of the matter is the votes of the people who do participate currently are worth nearly 10 votes because of your nonsense opinions, if the entire playerbase had to participate we would have far more accurate results than we do now.
---
Did you at all mention ‚Äú50 attack‚Äù in your message to them? Such as ‚ÄúI want to stay 50 attack eventually...‚Äù Whoever did the rollback probably only saw ‚Äú50 attack‚Äù and just gave you 50 attack.
---
Why...why don't you just do it?
---
I use esc for inventory, f1 for attack, f2 for prayer, f3 for magic, f4 for worn items. 
---
Lol isn't that from Feb 2017? Pretty long ago. They should poll it and state how fucking stupid it is to have unhidden poll results because of the bias it adds.
---
Thot juice

Next poll question: Should we hide the poll results for the poll about hiding poll results?
---
This episode was so good!!! Thank you Swampletics for making my cardio workout today the best part of my week!!
---
I have next to zero nostalgia for RuneScape but I prefer osrs graphics to these. These middle of the road shit ps1 graphics look awful compared to something like osrs that is just simple.
---
No and no
---
Like what people said, Jagex did sadly say they will not due to work and effort required, but slso what about mobile? It's already pretty taxing. Having rshd graphics would take up more space and probably drain battery like mad. 
---
0.000000029% chance for this to happen, go get a lottery ticket

Smooth brain for sure, that was on by default.
---
Are you talking about the super old runescape? Like before 2003 with 2D models?
---
I hate when my dog uses tribot on my account while im afk
---
No
---
Already in 2 lotto pool at work. I‚Äôm hitting it this week for sure
---
Imagine playing this game for hours every day with that shit all over your screen 
---
For the love of god disable ground loot under 5k or SOMETHING. 
---
ill give you 250k, a d med and black cav for it 
---
Settled had a ton of attention due to maxing his UIM. 
---
Swampletics is a way better and catchier character name.
---
 "Morytania locked ultimate Ironman" Rolls off the tongue. Kinda weird and nitpicky, but yeah. 
---
I'd definitely say you are right though, the genuine enthusiasm is the real selling point.
---
I'm sure he'll end up streaming Swampletics and doing the videos less often as the account becomes more grindy and the content unlocks become fewer and further between. 
---
ToB.
---
I promise to call him a cunt if I ever see him in game,
---
Because it‚Äôs useless ?
---
Grats
---
What even was the point of your post, to troll?
---
I want the textures and lighting but I don't want the big fat character models.

New to OSRS, veteran to RS in general, I made an Ironman account, can anyone give me an idea of the amount of content (particularly pvm) I would be missing out on as IM? I.e how much of these new (to me) Demi bosses are Solo‚Äôd versus not. Thanks to anyone who can lend a hand
---
Damn dude that‚Äôs insane
---
We need reboots of excl, tehnoobshow and darkArm3 
---
He's going to pk it from scratch. Not train the entire acc from scratch, you stupid fuck. 
---
Thx. I knew I was gonna get backfire from this post but the real answers of advice stopped me from quitting 
---
It was a fully functionning client lmao. It was released for a few weeks before they banned it and people using it.
---
My hero
---
I think I would enjoy it if there was a ladder system.
---
TOO. THE. TOP.
---
Agreed man I‚Äôm hyped
---
Where is that menu?. Im using runelite, is it an osbuddy thing?
---
And that‚Äôs fine, but the point is it doesn‚Äôt matter if I vote or not if the choice id make is a loss. Not to mention if the majority of the poll is winning where I‚Äôd rather it not it‚Äôs not really worth the time to vote in that case either.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
No such thing as too much money. 
---
Purpp is the same way and I was actually going to mention him in my original comment. 
---
Someone gets a Dinh‚Äôs drop in Raids:
---
Purpp: Enjoy 99 Hunter you fucking loser.
---
Does anyone know the formula for accuracy and damage for cannons? I was trying to see if maging along with cannon would be worth or if I should just AFK. I've been told that 160 slash(melee) is worth just as much as 210 ranged, but I can't find anymore information on it. I'm asking because I'm going for untrimmed slayer and I'm trying to calculate how I should finish the rest of my levels.
---
go try your game at the inferno before you end up going back and getting cleaned
---
You can't stake an infernal cape
---
Please do this jamflex PLEASEEEE. As for the hero badges, I like the idea. Maybe have them rank up so everyone can work up to there eventually? So if I never play and one day I log in and see a guy with all badges, I can someday have them too. 
---
Jamflex plz
---
the game won't give you a clue scroll if you already have one of that tier, but you can trick it into thinking you don't have any by constantly dropping the ones you do have.
---
If you log out at any time, though, any scrolls on the ground are going to dissapear. And since you're constantly dropping them (otherwise known as juggling), at least one is going to be on the floor, and you're going to lose it.
---
Since the game will always log you out after 6 hours no matter what, that's the maximum amount of time you can spend juggling your multiple clues. If you don't complete it in time, you lose them all except the one in your inventory and you have to start again
---
this is 2560\*1440, i dont want to buy a monitor at lower resolution just for osrs
---
other games support changing the resolution and the HUD resizing appropriately
---
Unpopular opinion: play a private server 
---
&gt; what part of intentionally cheating isn't malicious
---
You're not directly asking me, but my point in the thread was that it's conceivable for someone to have obtained a simple autoclicker and not realise it's that much of a cheat engine. 
---
A mouse might come with a button that repeats a click every 0.5 seconds for 5 seconds, all someone needs to do is hover their mouse over the ardy knight to set that up. Is that malicious? This person didn't go out of their way, acknowledging that they are breaking rules put in place to maintain the value of people's achievements in order to achieve it easier, they just have this tool on hand already and feel like they'd rather not spam click as much.
---
It *is* undeniably autoclicking and that is cheating, but this sort of software is so easy to come by now that there is the likelihood of people whom don't understand what botting or autoclicking really is to have obtained and actively used an autoclicker.
---
stretched mode on runelite. works great at 1440p. i have the scaling at 100%
---
Pures lmao
---
it sounds really cool but realistically i don't see people playing it if it doesn't benefit them on the live servers.
---
It's not an expensive one lol
---
you get exp for casting the spell
---
Never realized you can sell it back, this is definitely the way I'll go. Thank you!
---
You‚Äôre waiting a week, little man.
---
yeah hes lying bro.
---
Karamja raids/Karamja Treasure
---
That‚Äôs way more than I thought it would be. Damn.
---
Bad bot
---
Make this post with yellow text and black background! Should get more support tben
---
yeah he tried to kill woody
---
Additionally, you can hop at the lever outside where the poison spiders are.  That square next to the lever in particular has special properties that prevent the poison spiders from aggroing you (if one is already attacking, you'll have to deal with it, or just double lever really quickly before you start hopping).  That is the whole point of being able to peak at the lever.  
---
Thinks random boners are weird? Found a girl
---
What isn't possible about it? It's just textures lol.
---
What about mm1 caves, I know they aren't as good,  but wouldn't it still pretty good
---
Lives are exp wastes in high class circles
---
do i want any of increased performance, integer scaling, or keep aspect ratio checked
---
That isn't true at all.  You need to out-dps the ironman to get the loot.  If the kill was supposed to belong to them (they did most damage), then nothing would spawn.  If you could steal iron's kills that easily, then there'd be an incentive to crash them.  
---
I saw his comment earlier. I like the arrogance in openly botting. ORRRR... he could be you OP.. you sneaky bot. Trying to steal karma. 
---
That wildy one is so good, especially for pure vs pure clan fights, thank you
---
To build momentum?
---
i have increased performance chekced and the other two options unchecked
---
Yea, but would suck if he had 2 clues with that same step b2b. RNG do be like that sometimes
---
that is super weird. mobile or pc? if pc: are you trying to move the camera with the middle click or arrow keys? do neither of those work? if mobile: android or ios? I'll give it a try right now on both pc and mobile
---
thanks, looks a lot better
---
So let me get this right, when he eventually gets a second medium clue he'll have to constantly have one of them dropped as he goes about his other grinds until he gets a third?
---
I think so too :)
---
You new here bud?
---
Nick?
---
To be honest what kind of poll asks for that much information....
---
Ah, my mistake, I must have misunderstood my source. 
---
Then why wouldn‚Äôt you try a tourny world? 
---
You can find another new player after feeling a few fights out.
---
You literally have unlimited access to all the same things, so item/acc wise it is fair.
---
I found I made friends that were among my skill level (nhing in particular) and we practice against eachother.
---
That or you would fight someone who was better than you until you could compete with them.
---
Honest to god I would recommend you try a tourny world and fight guys who look bad
---
There are no words to describe just how stupid you are.
---
Omg you've made my day.  
---
Too stupid to know you're stupid, it's hilarious.
---
Not really the same thing, rebuilding series can be entertaining since they are still starting from nothing in the bank, but making a new account and transferring things over "just to train" without actually getting them yourself is just cheating the point
---
Trading.
---
its true, female model is smaller and some gear looks different. I hate being on a slayer task and looking identical to everyone else.
---
this is how we end up with RS3 again...
---
Well he wont do any other grinds when grinding the clues
---
im really trying to vote for oldschool, but it wont accept any number under "mobile number" ive used 6 different numbers that are legit and it says "invalid feild" wont even tell me whats wrong
---
If I crossposted, would they understand?
---
I would say no because it isnt a delayed animatiom, but a set one.
---
/r/iamverycool
---
Honestly, spooky skeletons? Nah. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking like Diablo Act 2 kind of stuff like scarabs , maggots, big ass bugs and demons of sorts.
---
The boss could be some sort of ancient warlord who is awoken in his tomb by you and your team of adventurers. 
---
Different clues have different drop tables. The vestments set which settled is going for are actually a great example of this. Different pieces of the set are only available at certain difficulty levels. The robes are easy, the cloak is medium, the crozier is hard, etc.
---
Wheres the drama calendar?
---
 not iron tho so
---
Do you get 100% back?
---
He‚Äôs just being a spastic
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ do you mean 1920x1080
---
I vote no since it ruined the dance emote last time
---
for beginners a blowpipe for jad is kinda difficult because you'll have to walk around jad to reach the healers behind it as you'll be very to close to jad it might melee you, but at the same time, if you got high range I've heard you can out-dps the healers with dragon darts.
---
If you think you can manage walking around jad while switching prayers go ahead
---
Dragon darts are way more than fine. Addy darts will suffice.
---
No need for crossbow.
---
I think they do though, they've said they had a working mobile port of OSRS pretty early on but didn't want to ship a buggy broken piece of content. Winter 2017.
---
Kebos was also delayed for the same reason: 
---
https://twitter.com/oldschoolrs/status/1070373686312660993?lang=en 
---
I think they've learned from some earlier mistakes but they've also mentioned that a lot of content just can't be tested enough to replicate the actual real world use by players (ToB difficulty was tweaked like 4 times?). 
---
Just use Blowpipe - DDarts aren't required but will make it easier 
---
I watch you before Swampletics :D
---
Cool, thanks. That'll definitely be much easier.
---
Is this series worth watching or is the whole community just memeing? 
---
Absolute chad
---
Of course it would be togglable. It's always been and still is togglable
---
Seriously. The girl I was talking to was legit a pedophile in a way, much older then me for sure. I didnt even know what I wanted(sexually) at that age but she got me hooked on some weird fetishes of hers. After she broke it off(literally never logged on again) I tried to talk to some girls in school. I was in 6th or 7th grade by then, 11 or 12 years old. I was ready for something sexual and the girls my age were obviously not. I ended up meeting a legit 41 year old woman on World of Warcraft at 14 years old and it made it much worse. But thats a story for another thread. lol
---
Osrs is played by over a million people, something can be rare and still happen more than once
---
There are plenty of different species of anglers, including some that are the size of a small American football
---
Just use rune darts for the whole thing. You'll be fine. You could even use addy darts and bring rune darts for jad.
---
Sure. Prior to the release of last week's Swampletics episode, Feral Vampyre had about 300 pageviews accumulated over the span of a couple weeks. Afterwards, it got a couple thousand in a single day, and is sitting at 5,329 in that timeframe.
---
Our most popular non-homepage articles are listed on our [homepage](https://osrs.wiki), and are updated fairly frequently. Optimal quest guide, our most popular page, averages anywhere from 7,500 to 8,000 views per day.
---
Girl on the left is Daniella Chavez btw
---
Quality
---
I work full time and every single account I own has it's defence, prayer and attack fully quested, I don't pay for services either.
---
91 attack 97 str 90 def
---
Helm of nezzy, salve e, black dhide top, proselyte legs, viggoras, crystal shield, climbing boots
---
i‚Äôve never had to walk around to tag them 
---
also, if you have high enough plus rigour you can out dps with addy darts 
---
At the risk of sounding like an asshole I'm gonna ask: are you taking tough courses, a full course load, etc. Because college should require far more time input.
---

Loving the new editing
---
That still isn't the same. I was drinking og four loko's my senior year of highschool and holy fuck. It was like cocaine mixed with alcohol. I've never drank anything that resembles it since.
---
People in my area even stockpiled them and one of my buddies exes has 2 og's left that are pretty much considered bad but no one wants to drink them or throw them out.
---
jagex havent confirmed this at all. and lol if influencers like sparc mac tells me his favorite thing isnt passing and what the current result is before I vote.. then this whole thing is kinda silly 
---
it's impossible to tag healers behind jad with a blowpipe, unless you know what you're doing. This guy is a beginner, you can't ask him to walk under jad lol
---
And he has no attack option because not even woox dares to challenge him.
---
It's been three months almost, where's the farming guild seed vault? Or at least an update on when it's coming?
---
Yup, explained my situation in the post I made in the official rollback thread.
---
Just noticed the spreadsheet doesn't include rows 40 and 41 in the point calculations - are you able to make the correction, or tell me what I need to change to make it accurate please? Many thanks man
---
Holy shit
---
That's good advice tbh. Now that I'm reading your comment I remember that I considered doing this way back when I boosted for the Fremennik elite task but I tend to be very unlucky with getting the +5 boost, IIRC I used over 100 stews to complete that task. It was so bad I should have just got the level haha. Anyway for this reason I was using the clan wars portal to reset my stats and it helps that I'm cheap.
---
Obviously, but that is the old one. This would be a re implementation of HD, so thats why I stated that, common sense man!
---
No it's like 80% or something, but it's worth selling back 
---
Legend

Gtfo
---
That's what I would expect, clicking on any video titled from scratch. 
---
I think its safe to assume without a reasonable doubt the angler pictured above is the same type fished in OSRS. 
---
Sarcasm?
---
Someone draw the genie lookin like a daddy with the two vyrewatch at his sides @ 7:57
---
Thanks for the response. Do you think the content is still rewarding despite not being able to sell drops/make money from it etc.?
---
Thanks!
---
Unless Ultimate Ironman, then herblore is still tedious as all hell. 
---
Not that I'm complaining I love my UIM, but it doesn't change the tedium.
---
If this is oc....10/10. You got me so good
---
That's the charm of osrs, its graphics, monotonous game mechanics, and even goofy animations is to me the pinnacle of a game whose essence is so pure it makes old polygon based graphics look nice. 
---
HD and Old school would make an oxymoron btw
---
When I checked it on OSRS mobile yesterday, when I went to redeem my single bond, it showed up as still being obtainable. So I brought more bonds and logging into my PC today, it showed up as not being something that is on offer.
---
I'm gonna go on OSRS mobile and see what it says asap.
---
I mean sure but let's be honest most irons aren't UIM, and *most* things are tedious on UIM to begin with.
---
Hats off to the mad lads though.
---
It‚Äôs not just memeing lol
---
You can't do anything but accept it :(
---
Three months ago is "recently"? Lmao
---
Yeah I'm undergrad but I'm biochemistry. Weekdays are about 2 hours of class and 1-2 hours of studying. Weekends are about 3-4 hours of studying. I do pretty well

Atleast he has some intelligence 
---
Swampletics: Meet Swampletics, my Morytania only Ultimate Ironman -
---
/u/The_AsianKid: You should go to Al Kharid.
---
Swampletics: DID I STUTTER?
---
Death to you sir.
---
Have you seen the skill capes in RS3? Yuckkk! Lol RS3 is when RuneScape started using WoW sparknotes.
---
Mate they are 100% bots. Only real players will speak something intelligent anyway. 
---
If you trade them, follow, or use an item on them they will run south and tele. You don't even need to attack.
---
They're programmed to run south and teleport when they detect when another player is doing an interaction with them. Their bot clients allow them to do this.
---
This except add ESC to logout.
---
The normies don‚Äôt understand our work ethic reeeee 
---
it usually is, I have about 20+ reddit accounts all with 5k+ karma that I use to troll a wide variety of subs.
---
Such a terrible situation bro :( its been going on for too long aye.
---
You can rebuild though ! Change your password a few times and then get back on the grind. 
---
Next time always check the names, usually a few off characters in there.
---
Hope it doesn't put you fully off the game man, just think you would have eventually had more than 20m anyway so why not keep going :) 100m will just equal 80m now
---
Take my swampletics updoot friend.
---
Nah
---
Ya
---
It would be useful if this was a bonus to crush accuracy instead. Rune 2h is fine as is, and buffing stab accuracy isn‚Äôt going to solve the real issue behind the stab weapons, which is their strength bonuses. I don‚Äôt have a problem with the hill giant club, but if it had a crush accuracy buff from a cape that led to risking said cape(and the club itself when protect item is out of the question) then it would be more practical for the current state of f2p.
---
ITT; /u/pussi_destroyer666 not saving any for the rest of us
---
oh well yeah if they spawn behind him, that‚Äôs fair. they usually come from behind me 
---
good point 
---
How about they replace the real results with fake poll results to see how much influence it really has as a test  
---
good lord i'm not sure why you're getting downvoted so hard wtf lol
---
What cape will be in the finally of swampletics?
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/17654980

That account  was his original ironman from before ironman mode, so afaik he never actually trained using money from another account.

I reject teal hat as new season, only capes!!
---
the radius doesnt matter if the shit is stacked, bulwark is easier to do yeah but i was thinking max efficiency. which has already been done and was around 800k/hr with d2h. the video is posted on this post somewhere
---
he botted then. there‚Äôs no other way. 
---
Ruin everything else to make teleport to target a little safer. No thx. Also theres a pj timer in bh worlds. U can log before they hit u if done correctly. And again, can just have ur buddy save u
---
Pretty well thought out, I'd give it a go
---
Whats the issue? 
---
Only if they poll it first.
---
And they don't even need to be in his inventory?
---
I think swamplettics is this popular because of his personality and the way he's so hyped about somthing that is generally meaningless like so lamps, he's so hyped every time he gets one it's great.
---
things we take for granted to him are amazing 
---
Ironically I think about this exact thing when me and my IRL gf (I told her to play osrs after we started dating) play rs together, and it always makes me laugh. 
---
Yeah I know I'm just making a point. They ought to refund every day he couldn't play legit and ban people that abuse. Or have real support that figures it out within the hour and fixes it
---
Oh they removed them? I didn't know lmao.
---
Anyway, to answer your question; Since they were removed yesterday, it will probably be 2-3 months until they get back.
---
Why would you make a 13 def pure with 18 prayer? What benefit does it give you over 13?
---
I would be honestly surprised if you could 
---
Ok so let‚Äôs implement everything that has passed 65% instead of 75%

I don‚Äôt vote because nothing remotely that isn‚Äôt overwhelmingly yes or no isn‚Äôt polled but that is more likely due to poll results not being hidden. Just being hidden wouldn‚Äôt solve the problem anyways but it‚Äôs a start
---
it's a little above average, it may seem that way because I never include (or very very rarely) include other random events.

Don‚Äôt do it people, been temp banned for this. Detectable even if your clicker clicks randomly and on different pixels. 
---
They're close enough that you should just do whichever you enjoy. If you enjoy both then Vorkath is slightly better.
---
Fuck the shitty meme, I wanna know what this man is afking for base 90s in a month. 
---
I just shed a tear. 
---
Would you say that Vorkath or Zulrah is easier to master? I'm coming close to my Zulrah stats 85 magic/range and I'm feeling intimidated by the guides I've seen. 
---
Kind of debating just getting DS2 reqs and going for money dragon. 
---
One feels like a higher stat buy-in , the other feels like a bigger gear buy in (DHCB) 
---
Not at all, but it saves having to constantly go to the wiki to see what stats you need for a particular quest. There's also no real effective way \*in game\* to actually see what the highest stat requirements for quests are, you have to go to outside sources.
---
Just train agility and thieving til the week runs out.
---
Plenty of people on reddit will make posts consisting of "Why isn't this passing?" and post a picture of the current poll.
---
Hydra is already good enough. It's legit like 5m an hour, and insane for ironmen as well.
---
These fake streams get high amounts of viewers by view botting and then they put their fake links which I assume key logs you or something to get access to your account
---
I wish I could get on this hype train but I Just can't see it.
---
C O N T E N T

The reddit is being spammed with drops or pets. They almost always say "i don't have anyone to share this with"
---
How is he phising? And the rules say no advertising forums, a cc is not a forum.

Wat is tob

I'm lazy enough to use this at Vorkath, and would be nice for pyramid plunder and stuff like that.
---
I'm fucking crying and have a hard on at the same time. 
---
Wrath runes at the moment.
---
Yes please - it would make it a lot less suspicious at work  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
Have you ever just put a rock on that key and walked away?
---
unfortunately even if jagex hid the poll results now- the results would still be skewed just because of all  the attention around it right now. hiding poll results could get the vote count to temporarily spike because of the "hype" or just because players are trying to make a point- but would go back down to the 12% that it was before over a short period of time. they are trying to come up with a more permanent fix rather than only hiding poll results and ignoring the bigger issue. this deserves a lot more praise imo
---
Weirdly specific question: is there a safe spot for the greater demons in the catacombs of Kourend?  I prefer to train range while doing slayer and I haven't been to this area yet.

Even funnier was that I was instantly getting discord PMs because he was from a clan I know people in lmao.

Hilarious
---
Banking, GPS, calling people...
---
I haven't done Vork yet but I'm considering making the switch for the gp/hr. Currently getting 25 kills per hour at Zulrah but with 2 more upgrades (same price point as DHCB), I'm sure could clear 30.
---
Not if you start adding in exp bonuses and other things in this game. It sounds like it's good of an idea because it is not tied to the main game.
---
I think the problem more lies in if I want to AFK on this server I must pay for two memberships, instead of having two toons going at once from one account. 
---
Let's poll if we don't want polls to be hidden?
---
Varrock west bank and then another in a f2p world at the lobster spot in Karamja. 
---
Most will be Lumbridge top bank as that's where any account can tele to and if you're hacked via phishing that's where the bot sends you to trade with their mules.

That was his peckishwhale acc,  an unofficial ironman account he made before ironman mode and probably one of the most famous ironman accs/series.

same, I was going to try practice my fight caves. I died last night at JAD on my first ever attempt. Got to 3/4 healers. So sad i cant practice now

It's true. But the real kicker is I left the game halfway through ranging a steel dragons task, literally thinking "Maybe I should switch this for a DHCB just for this task."

You don't want to know what happens when someone calls him Stinky Pete. Some say he goes into carnage mode for a week.
---
do u log in like 1 hr a day?
---
There‚Äôs a few reasons your total level may be worse than Settled‚Äôs morytania locked UIM. First off, Settled knows more about RS than you ever will. Secondly, he puts more time into the game than you ever will. Thirdly, you spend more time on rs doing random shit that does little to nothing for your progress rather than actually progressing your account. This last one though is on you tbh, but it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you‚Äôre having fun.
---
you know those kinds of people do this solely for your reaction just like this. it‚Äôs best to not give anything to encourage them. 
---
Maybe Auto Mod is snoozin. Thanks!
---
no you cannot use summer pies to boost thieving. 
---
Very helpful, thank you
---
Are you damaged in the brain?

Lovely
---
while this is fair, the fact that they don‚Äôt save any kinds of progress would still keep people from playing them 24/7.

His combat surpassed me a couple months ago

Yes it makes it so bad. Ontop of that it was such a close poll

Known issue no fix for it yet, jagex knows about it
---
This passed didn't it? Pretty sure it was updated a few weeks ago to actually work this way. If you have a gricolier's can you could test it.
---
I spoke to him the first time asking why do it and he has persisted for the last 4 days, looks like he does this everyday for most of the day so I don't think it matters what I do
---
I get jad hands right around wave 55, nothing to terrible. I usually say the attack out loud like an autist to make sure that what I'm flicking to is the correct prayer. The last attempt I had it in my head that this was the one, got him to %50 the tagged each healer and thought "Finally got the fucking shitty pizza cape", then the healers started piling on 12's.  
---
Just got to spend another hour killing made dogs. Wish me luck lads.

Literally all I think every time I see him

You could argue that the point of the game is have max stats and lord it over everyone. I used to bot way back in the day and got a temp ban for it eventually so I quit playing. Came back due to mobile and discovered OSRS. Now I enjoy the grind again, but if there was some way that I knew I would never ever be caught and banned I would absolutely bot to max stats. Some people find fun in the journey and others find fun at the destination, or something like that.
---
This would have been funny in 2006.

It has a hold of me as well now. Just hit 98 combat. Tbh I‚Äôm just as trapped in it now as I was when I was 10.

I've been everywhere noob, I've been everywhere.

At least you can always have a higher runecrafting level!

Significantly harder sadly, Karamja has more steps and bug swarms are easier to kill than vamps.
---
You forgot the two or three others playing together BSing me at black chins.

But why does he need the 3? The part I didn't get was how using 3 scrolls somehow he can predict a challenge spawning in mrytani? Or is it just more scrolls more chances, 3 is max

I bet what happened was:

1. You use the same password for everything

2. You misclicked "edit tag"

3. You thought you were typing your browser into a password field but you actually typed it into game, when you hit enter it saved it as the tag and you were like, "huh? where did the text go?" but you don't see it so you imagine you just weren't typing anywhere.
---
No, actually its calculating CB just as intended lol. What youre proposing is saying something like a maxed 75 attack pure (which is 88-89 CB) should actually be 100+ CB because of its DPS (which coincidently, is the worst DPS out of pures/zerks/meds/mains and worst survivability lol) and how high it can hit? By saying its "broken" youre saying that people who sacrifice defense levels to be a lower CB and play a different account with high DPS should be PENALIZED even further than the restrictions already on them because of their defense level and DPS. So you want to both take into account their levels but not take into account their levels and then take into account their damage (which is basically another way of saying their levels) as well. You cant just say well that account has 99 mage and 99 range so it should be "x" CB level whilst ignoring the fact its 1 defense and instead judging its CB by its damage. 
---
Remember this is a CHOICE, no one is stopping someone from making a bit better PVP account instead of going with a less optimal PvP build of just straight base 70s or 80s. You could easily just make a 75 def piety account to pk on if youd like to also do other things, hell plenty of Zerks do all kind of PvM. Should we also say its broken that pures and zerks struggle to do some PvM and cant do it optimally and that they have to make a "specialized account" to be able to do it? Because thats exactly what youre saying about PvP, yet I know youll say "oh no PvM is different they CHOSE to have lower defense and prioritize PKing and not be as good at PvM" and my response would be...exactly, they CHOSE just as someone who went base 80s did. There are pros and cons to every account build, its the way it is, the only account that will do everything optimally is a completely maxed main. 
---
I‚Äôm like 90% sure you can change the email because I‚Äôve done it before. Maybe they removed the function but I highly doubt it.
---
I was in the same boat as you and it sounds like we have similar schedules.
---
I decided to make a regular account and I plan on making an Ironman later. I‚Äôve already learned SO much that I didn‚Äôt know when I was a kid that will make Ironman experience better.
---
In terms of membership, most people will tell you the game just isn‚Äôt the same without it. In terms of how hard or long it takes to earn the gold, it‚Äôs not impossible but it‚Äôs definitely pretty slow until you get to ‚Äúmid‚Äù levels or higher which will take you a couple months. For me, it made the most sense to just pay for membership and once I get to ‚Äúend game‚Äù it will be super easy to buy bonds for my main and the Ironman I plan on making at that point!
---
You do recall correctly.
---
This is true. Never blue. 
---
ultimate seems so unfun, regular ironman would be 10x less sadistic 
---
Have you watched the series? 
---
rsn: fourlokoguy üò§
---
Fuck yeah you actually understood what I was saying lmfao
---
Sounds like youre complaining that you want to have your cake and eat it too. Different account builds will be better at different things in this game. Main accounts will be better at PvMing than a pure, should the pure complain that the main can do all this PvM so much better and that it should be fixed so that theyre equal? Nope, just like if you make a main youre not going to be optimal for pking. What youre complaining about is just completely silly dude.

Anyone have a clip from that part of B0aty's stream?

What does he need 27 hunter for?
---
BF is like 500k an hour at level 50 smithing, collecting white berries is maybe like 300k and is pretty afk (but no exp) hunter is bank if you can do chins, green dragons are like 500k an hour IIRC, crazy archeologist in W318 only is about 1.5M/hour if you do it late at night, runecrafting nature‚Äôs is like 400k an hour. Those are methods I came up with in 2 minutes off the top of my head, and there‚Äôs dozens more, you just gotta think.
---
I‚Äôm 53 dry on my first 53 runs. This is my first ever account and I‚Äôm broke. This makes me want to kill myself IRL
---
How‚Äôd u get this?
---
You have to either get 40 kc again or use an ecumenical key. 
---
i dont get it
---
I'd make a main before you decide on making an ironman.
---
There's a lot to know to progress quickly as a btw.
---
You have 60 minutes for pvm deaths (excluding instanced areas). More than enough to get kc for gwd. You can keep a key in bank if you're really worried.

I imagine Eminem created it frankly. As far as I can tell it's the earliest use in that context.

Vork or Zulrah. I assume you don't have a DHCB so I would lean towards Zulrah. Once you learn either boss you will easily be able to make the cash in 2-3 days depending on playtime ofc.

Self esteem issues are the fucking worst. No matter what you're doing it just seeps into everything you do, every decision you make and thought you have comes prepackaged with the assumption that you aren't worthwhile and that you don't deserve any meaningful joy. Sometimes you manage to forget about it for a few moments which makes it even worse when you remember how small you are. Huge respect for putting yourself out there even with those issues, that takes a special kind of dude, definitely not the sort of person that can justify feeling insecure. 
---
U/S7EFEND could be right, using Dinh's spec you can aggro whole room with alt 1 hit, main start barraging stack. When main is barraging in max mage in one room, alt would go to other room to spec and lure then house pool if out of specs.
---
What OP described though the iron didn't seem to have that setup in mind.
---
youre a retard why even make this stupid ass arguement? Did you even read what i said? "Allow someone to make OSHD" meaning it wouldnt take any of their time and no it wouldnt damage the game there is literally no possible way graphics can ruin the game just dont fucking use them and its like their never even there???? Hard to grasp i know.
---
All that XP waste.
---
Definitely make an account with a throwaway that has cool/easy to type domains. I've seen people logging in accounts like "a@a.com". Besides being easier to type than your common 10+ letter gmail, nobody except you will know this login e-mail  but MAKE SURE to change the e-mail on the account after it's created to an actual e-mail that you use.
---
Did you not watch his pure set from scratch vid from today? It's not about the levels, he could have switched accounts and it would still be the same.. it's not like that gear went towards the set??

A lot of pk streamers are entertaining and make good content though. Seems kind of counterproductive to trash people enjoying the same game as you. You share a common interest with these streamers/audience (runescape) but you think they are shit cause they prefer pvp.

sorry but a dungeon being purple isnt really "unique" enough for me like yeah the tilesets look great  but im talking about the structure of the dungeon itself. you could make a dungeon like catacombs way thematically interesting if like, since we have a section with lots of demons in it, oh why not put the boss room at the end of it, where you have to tank a bunch of black demons just to get to the boss room? gwd does this well it would be cool to have haunted pickaxes near ore even if its not like a useful mining spot just as being thematically coherent. agility shortcuts are great unique drops are great although i feel like they could have distributed the rates of totems differently to make it a little bit more interesting, id like to see several types of monsters that feel fitting together in the same room like why tf are there nechs &amp; dust devils in the same dungeon with legit no reason they look like they should be there? throw some blood on the floor &amp; some smoke clouds hovering its just such lazy map design for how much graphical work they put in it.
---
do it
---
It's just inertia for me. I don't care enough to make the trip back to change it. Also I'm zoomed out 95% of the time to the max anyway.
---
Hopefully theres some quest down the line that requires you to swap your toon to male.

You see, I quite liked that, since it showed off a lot of P2P areas, and at the time, I didn't know what they were and it made me interested to play more to unlock them.

Use the cash to purchase buyable skills.

Thats just a startup I'd recommend if coming from scratch because it gets you gear, prep for quests (Do quests, they give great exp in other useful stats), and quickly progress your account so you can do more profitable methids in the game.

Tbh I actually laughed at that, decent effort
---
Jagex has worked with Runelite and OSBuddy to accept/deny certain features. So using them today is 100% not bannable and is recomended by over half the playerbase. 
---
BUT, adding your own apps/features is not advisable due to many things that can alert the auto-ban system.
---
damn lol hope u dont go after me next aha
---
You could just bring 1 dose btw, or even drink it at bank since you need less than 2 mins to run from bank to kurasks.
---
Most skills aren't profitable.
---
You could try hunter to make some money. Fishing is also decent, however you need like 80+ to actually make money.
---
Otherwise just check the wiki for the money making guides, they also have many that are low level or require little equipment 
---
I hate months like these...

TB him, bring a friend and anti-pk him

I was thinking of doing hunter as that used to be really profitable back in the day...

4chan isnt your personal army.
---
shit I haven't been there since like 2005, but that was every second thread.
---
Reported for bug abuse, hope you get p banned you sick fuck
---
Did you at least destroy 1 person? 
---
Barrows would be decent for me but I don't have the hard diaries completed as I dont have some of the requirements is it still worth it?? I know I would be getting the occasional gear which is one of the main benefits from it... 
---
The rapier was predominantly used at rune drags, thus making the demand for it very high. When the dragonhunter lance got introduced it replaced it entirely. Thus making the need for it plummet
---
The only one who pulls of Raids 2 solo is woox tho
---
like, knowing what to do? you're right, I misread
---
Not again jagex üò©
---
Omg it worked. Thanks OP.
---
Ive got 84 fishing... might be worth a look into
---
Damn these are my stats too and I'm about to attempt my first jad run
---
66 smiting is a tall order with his training method
---
I think PvP is a respectable sport, but PKing just involves smacking defenseless players for their hard earned gear, and then running away when someone actually skilled fights back
---
They need to make private chat a customizable color. Red is so damn hard to see half the time.
---
You can solo it
---
you would have to donate to see the payment details, not gonna give anything to this scrub.
---
Don't dox. Obviously the wrong thing to do. And anyone could throw any name in there, even if it isn't them. Send it through people who have actual power to make a change rather than throwing the info to trolls who will just send him into hiding. Use your brain. You get one chance to do something right before someone deletes their internet footprint before you can do anything substantial about it.
---
So go and play Rs3 on legacy mode, or play a Pre-EoC private server. There are plenty.
---
That was a crazy ride wow. Great story dude. Scary stuff tho.
---
There is an in game way. It's called the quest tab
---
I can't believe so many people took this seriously...
---
You know what they say about Asperger's and the ability to detect sarcasm.
---
Ah i never knew that. Just having random ideas at work.
---
Boi I've just finished with uni today, can't wait to get home and watch this!

A friend made a video about it lo
---
Wrecked for account sharing. gg account
---
How do u have all these expensive items but know fuck all about death mechanics and shit? 
---
If you can't runecraft until 2003 then you need to get rid of the talismans in your bank
---
or just vote
---
I feel like this meme is gonna get old at some point but we aren't there yet 
---
okay but that wasn't the argument. Would it make them extra work in the future? Absolutely, which is another reason why it most likely won't happen. But to say it would be too much work to currently convert the assets is bs
---
Dude this Would be crazy if you made the whole east continent of runescape  city by city. Good work so far 
---
Definitely puts things into perspective. I have a 4 year old son now and I‚Äôm definitely going to be careful about his online friendships and such. My mom was completely oblivious, but I don‚Äôt blame her. The gaming culture and such was still so new back then, the thought of me mingling with thousands of random strangers online never crossed her mind. I always think, what if she lived closer to me? Spooky, but intriguing.

The reduced supply cost makes it BiS at Zulrah by a huge margin.

---
It is very annoying, I am not aware of any fix as of yet.
---
There's money and there's fuck you money. Some people have fuck you money...and that's enough
---
Dunno the math but there‚Äôs 2 drops per kill
---
Settled is really only 18?
---
Sara sword is better on a pure than Abby dagger cause you don‚Äôt have a useful defender.
---
not everyone has 4-12 hrs a day of free time to play the computer games
---
So most skills are profitable. It just depends on how slow you wanna level em.
---
My life would be complete , I‚Äôd even be hyped bank standing lol
---
70 Smithing for the Diary, Still not 75 slayer so pretty poor.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't delete your own account, and i also believe that jagex doesn't delete accounts either. Maybe if you have a very good reason that you're able to tell them, but i doubt it. 
---
This is so fucking cute. Well done OP
---
idk imo rs has never been better
---
the fuck does this have to do with osrs?
---
Look, maybe a bit, but you also said that Aussies aren‚Äôt like that, when in fact, some actually are. 
---
Foreigners love the Aussie identity, so can you blame him for playing on it a bit? 
---
SMH Swampletics couldn't take the cigarette, that's trading.
---
Please write another version where he spends 20 hours killing a mob to get tobacco seed drops, grows, dries and rolls his own cigarette, THEN joins you.
---
Blowpipe is BiS at zulrah.
---
Zygomites are worth doing depending on your task list, how many points you have stored, and how much efficient slayer you plan to do post 99.
---
Both recent times I used it, literally everyone wanted a retarded amount of payment for such a small step. Sad part is that the ones that demanded money were actually on their mains and needed to get the quest done as well. They just wanted to be greedy dicks. 
---
LMAO that was great
---
yes omg yes.
---
marble textures make me moist
---
It's cheaper if you have quest cape
---
He propably charges for runs
---
Nice, that‚Äôs 6700 less than me
---
I wasn‚Äôt salty I swear
---
What‚Äôs a good way for a new ironman to make money? I heard steel plate bodies is good, but I keep dying to the demons or black knights. Is there a general good money making method early game? 
---
Jagex' reasoning was that they would have to start all over from making each and every single model HD again from scratch, which they originally did in ye olde days. So its either spend all effort on making game look pretty vs making team work on content.
---
When your under 1250 total after osrs has been around for 6 years. 
---
Going to Varrock for a quest and for a house iirc
---
Don‚Äôt eat that

Nothing and im okay with that

Oh, so everyone does it.

It hasn't been helpful to my Journey yet

Oh man, I started the task and was like "please don't be something I go dry on". Feel for you dude.
---
What does an ammy have to do with a blue bed?
---
ModMatK has said on a podcast that makinjg an HD version of the game and for it to be toggleable would take around 2 years if not more with the current team they have.
---
did he drop his?

Barrows gloves

Hard-Achievement diaries

Correct. There are no 3rd party mobile clients (and runelite devs said they don't plan to make a mobile client either)
---
It‚Äôs a cool idea but I think there needs to be a bit more to it. I can‚Äôt think of anything rn tbh but I do like the idea of people choosing sides. 
---
Maybe each side ‚Äúowned‚Äù a city and there would be an incentive to raid the other side‚Äôs city. 
---
I‚Äôm so glad that this comment is so relatable, because I honestly thought I was the only matured person doing this lmao.
---
People on reddit only upvote what they want to hear. The average redditor is unable to accept they're not always right.
---
Imagine pet farming when you don't have bis DPS gear
---
yes
---
Says the guy using Twitch emojis all over Reddit. 
---
I recommend Atleast getting your magic to Level 25 to Tele Varrock, you‚Äôll be able to make teleports on House Worlds, plus it‚Äôll make a huge difference unlocking all the travel options to make gameplay quicker, especially for questing! 
---
That's no rune crafting requirement. But it is an aids long agility full quest line.
---
You're not even close to the droprate though
---
Of
---
Jagex doesn't recover items unless its their fault (like server rollbacks or massive fuck-ups)
---
GG items, don't get ur acc details leaked in future.
---
Yeah but I want my god tier luck :(
---
its was my favorite task pre eoc with chaotic rapier.
---
ez 60k slay xp p/h afking
---
So, you're saying a max stack of magic seeds will come with it then?
---
Or use the built in one in RuneLite
---
Xp waste is fun.
---
Nothing new so content is kind of dry for it right now. Thankfully boaty will revive it, haven‚Äôt used a bond on my 1 def pure in a couple months
---
The portal isnt centered on the block.... 
---
&gt;this bothers me greatly
---
153 was wrong.
---
What is this 20 questions? You asked what's next and I gave you the correct answer...any more requires bonds. 
---
The real strange thing is I'd be more certain that it was a leak on the client end, I have a standalone email used only for that account and a serial key password.. yeah, like the Jed incident people were refunded items 
---
Bring lunars, make D hide, craft and alch with spellbookswap
---
Yeah thats what i thought as well, but i got fcked hard by the abyss prayer drain and didnt make it in time. 
---
???? Are you trying to say you don't want a max level character with amazing gear instantly that you know nothing about and would rather play the game from scratch as intended learning along the way? You're just being ridiculous
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
It's amazing how many of these brain pics you found
---
Lol I like you. 
---
boo
---
its mostly time, but its a bit of both. For every hour a noob spends wondering what to train or training inefficiently a more experienced player can do it in half the time.
---
Making gold bracelets for crafting? Sure it gives profit, but its slow af and instead you could rather spend money doing crafting doing hide bodies or battlestaffs, and then use the time saved to do your best money maker. 
---
I found the way to cure my jad hands was to get a video of someone fighting jad and practice switching prayers/doing things along with it. Made a huge difference.
---
Awesome work! Please keep this project going. It‚Äôs great to see the progress.
---
I prefer pvp on this game and so does a lot of people, its way more unique than the 100 br or moba clones
---
&gt;It would take away a ridiculous amount of devtime from updates
---
Ah yes more tbow spawns. /s
---
Creative mode... do this on survival then we can talk

Yeah yeah Nassau NASA whatever floats your boat.

2 hours of class a day isn't anywhere near a base line 15 credit hours per semester.

Since the release of mobile we‚Äôve been able to log in by simply tapping once on the screen, so it‚Äôs a noticeable change that needs to be fixed. As if typing in landscape mode wasn‚Äôt awful enough, now were being forced too every single time we log out of mobile as opposed to every few days &amp; possibly hundreds of times logging in. So this is the reason that I care about having to ‚Äújust log in‚Äù
---
check runescape forums, got mine there 
---
Ahh thank you 
---
Also... Why dafuq would the rs website suggests taking offf the authenticator. Baffling.
---
dont acc share
---
Malware
---
Everything but alkarid,falador rimmington,port sarim,lumbridge,falador and white ice mountain.
---
So most of the places in the game
---
Ow
---
Now that‚Äôs a good ol pasta. 
---
Even Morytania? :(
---
Yep
---
internet has ruined me
---
The authenticator doesn‚Äôt make you impossible to hack, if you get a rat they can bypass it all pretty easily. They could also recover the account if they have enough info which removes the authenticator.
---
... This community in a nutshell 
---
Haven't shared my account.
---
I got over 5 and a half years of membership's worth in my main's bank, and that only if I literally never moneymake again. So yes, there is infinite membership to be had from my main.
---
Computer is clean with regular scans etc..
---
Virtoso would disagree
---
The authenticator isnt removed and my computer is clean.
---
How‚Äôs the trump Russia conspiracy going for you bud 
---
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt really look this stuff up‚Äù but you‚Äôre commenting in a reddit post. Same amount of effort
---
The boundaries are the taverley gate, shantay pass and the gates leading to morytania/the digsite. Pretty much all of the islands are also members content
---
Did you check on the website to see if the authenticator is removed? The code on the app will stay there regardless of it being removed or not.
---
what happened is that its dead content
---
You don't understand why people don't want to vote if they feel like their vote doesn't matter?

Honestly guys the Alpha Male has entered this subreddit. Everyone behave yourselves and bow down to our new master.

You've made a minimum od 50m from uniques.. Stop being so bloody greedy mate
---
Missing the point still. 
---
Thanks for the info. Maybe it the tabs were untradable? 
---
How do you find the time to work, make all those pk builds, and still slay pussi 24/7?
---
C300 is one of their cheapest sedans 
---
Same spot, although you'll want to get some zamorak monk robes so you can access the top floor.  It either doubles your cash/hr or makes it so you take 0 damage, your choice.
---
more than $1000, I would say closer to the $2-3000 mark.
---
I mean exactly what I typed in my comment. 
---
If it really is neither of these things, you will get help by a mod. (try to tweet them).  
---
And if you are not telling us/bending the truth (&amp; i've seen plenty of threads like these) it almost always result in a smackdown by a jagex mod.
---
Neither of those are close to the amount of money you can get from pvm
---
But if I nut instantly, then the grind is finally over
---
Because they're made to be used vertically. Typing in landscape is more difficult. This game is and always was developed to be used in landscape...that's why.
---
Finally a easy way to track how many blacks I've killed.
---
Probably very easy to get that employee fired if you knew for sure which one it was, and explained the situation to their manager in a very mature way and in terms that even somebody who knows nothint about runescape would understand, making sure to emphasise that what was stolen is worth real-life money, the number of hours if work that was put into gaining said wealth, and explaining the breach of privacy that has occurred and the abuse of power the employee has committed. Maybe gently indicate that the incident is grounds for the store to be reported to the ombudsmen. If it were me, i'd be making certain that employee was fired, plus more (on principle alone, not because i would care that much about having my bank stolen), but i'm vindictive as fuck so each to their own, i guess.
---
What? This isnt my first account. I played back in 2006-2010 
---
I just haven't leveled RC because it hasn't been needed for anything I've done on my account so far. I'll get 50 when I'm gonna do dream mentor 
---
First no Authenticator and now no nut!! even though I clearly upvoted! Jmods plz 
---
Why worn gear ?
---
Also check if your email adress/password is not on haveibeenpwned.com

Happy for you the grind is over. I've seen you there multiple times. I was lucky enough to have tassets, chestplate and hilt on 315 kc

All in his head

I think I misread the wiki. I was damn sure that it has a weight of 6 at Steve but it turns out that that's the rate for black dragons.

Thanks man, I've been thinking of pulling out a really good and classic copy pasta on this sub for a while just to see if maybe most players here are actually retarded and I'm basically all but sold here. Hope you get an rc pet today no sarcasmo
---
I mean, i couldn't possibly care less, but for real, steve clearly buys bonds. The fuck's with the steel mace noob
---
What hat is that? 
---
Never said it was? Its was clearly my fault and Twitch‚Äôs fault for even allowing shit like that. I just wanted more attention brought to the issue. 
---
In your replies you say you've got the most secure account but here you are showing your rsn which is step 1 for preventing social engineering, just how secure are you being? You probably fucked up somewhere but you're too stupid or your ego is too big to realize or remember how you messed up.

Unsure of troll or noob.

during the winter I usually have a few months off, last winter I speedran mith gloves on about 20 accounts that I will be using for future builds.
---
I've already flipped a lot of high margin stuff when I took that screenshot. Reason I'm flipping is because I was working on my alt.

Don't tell us we didn't warn you. :)

Hey in the most recent qna they talked about it so how hard are you really checking
---
Cigarettes work like Bonds
---
Try Deadman Mode, even in the off season. It's a fun little sandbox and a good place to practice PKing/Essentially Ironman (the GE and market are virtually non-existent, and you can't trust people enough to rely on trading).
---
Catch chinchompas in the wildy since not many accounts can attack him and he has little chance of getting KO‚Äôd. Makes big money

Don‚Äôt know why so many idiots are bashing you. This is a very frustrating bug and I feel your pain. 
---
I have had one tap log in since release and now since the latest update I am signed out after every log out and even signed out after world hopping in game...
---
I made a post about it and apparently jagex is aware and is fixing it... I hope it gets resolved soon.
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** inthelostwoods! ^(hug)
---
ironmemes can't make Sara brews as easily so strawberries are the most accessible and highest healing per slot item
---
sharks are probably the emergency food
---
Isn't OSRS separately owned by Jagex while RS3 has all those shares with investors, or something like that?
---
??????????

Imagine paying a floating man to make you dreams so that you don‚Äôt have to fight in real life. That‚Äôs the life I want yo live.

Obviously these people don‚Äôt play mobile consistently or at all.. typical people putting their noses where they don‚Äôt belong. Thanks for the comment
---
&gt; I usually say the attack out loud like an autist to make sure that what I'm flicking to is the correct prayer
---
I did the same exact thing when I got my kill.  It really helps.
---
He should kill all the bots down there 
---
Just look up the slayer master you're using on the wiki and then scroll down to the list of all tasks they assign. The category "weight" is what you're looking for  
---
&gt;Obby cape instead of Ava's
---
what the saradomin
---
Varrock clothing store 
---
obviously it's both a lot harder whilst still being possible on mobile lol, someone has done Inferno on mobile before
---
I believe you can outdps with blowpipe, dragon darts and slayer helm too
---
Is this a new feature?  I'd definitely prefer to play like this.
---
In a post I saw a month ago here they said 3A is a commonly rwted item in some kind of package deal.
---
I‚Äôm not sure where I fall in this, but I got my first shard afking tortured gorillas off task (I found out you can safe spot them). 
---
Tons of people do, lol. Private server people aren't enjoying the game wrong imo though I don't see the appeal personally
---
I feel it's a bit different since he would just continue to play as before. There's no active action committed towards bug abuse. Instead, he's required to reach out in order to not "abuse a bug". That's unfair.
---
heck
---
Fair enough. Well then, guess I got to burn through some supplies to learn Zulrah then.
---
This happened to my friend as well, was autotyping on rs then opened cs source and still had it open and got vac banned a week later lol
---
I would rather this than all the power creep updates we get 
---
every roll is unique and it wasnt yours, your odds are the same, it being your kill doesnt mean you would have got the same loot on that kill
---
For example after the rollback a long dry zammy trip reseted turned to 2 rare loots in few kills
---
Rng is decided on roll, you didnt roll, and if you rolled it would have been different
---

Click the shield icon in notification once you start it and set it to portrait and start RS

It depends a lot on scale prices. With scales nearing 180, vork is way way better. They're about even when scales are around 230, and with scales at 250+ zulrah is better. 
---
I think most people just don't vote, not because of the current points, maybe I'm wrong but idk. I have voted in 1 poll and I am almost maxed, not because I see one at 80% and figure fuck it. I just really dont care about 99% of them enough. I would cast a vote on a new skill but other than that I'm not voting.

I thought there was only 4 brain pics until I clicked on the image, holy shit.

Think this could of all been avoided if he just mentioned this in his YouTube comment reply, but oh well osrs drama as usual.
---
So you can just afk them with a ranged weapon? How do you do that?
---
No... But that's why he wants to barehand baby imps which was his original hunter goal. I think it's pretty obvious why he would want to catch dragon imps.
---
They chose to limit themselves
---
Wow, this is really sweet
---
that‚Äôs gotta be one of the cringiest setups I‚Äôve seen 
---
I'm almost certain that Jagex is all rolled into one company. The earnings report that the guy I was responding to posted is for one company and it mentions osrs and rs3 so it's safe to assume it's all just Jagex. 
---
What. 
---
Was just asking why you specifically said Jad because it's one of the faster pets to get.
---
do you think players code bugs into the game? Bugs are always caused by the developers
---
Settled. Reach out to Netflix and see if you can get your videos put on Netflix. I'm serious. People would watch them.

''You may now only use your operating system's official default mouse keys program, *unless it is to remap a key to any other button*.'' meaning using any 3rd party program to rebind keys is fine.

My first and only thought about this post 
---
thanks
---
you're very right, but you still profit while gaining significant amounts of xp. after all, you have to level your skills up eventually if you really want to experience all that this game has to offer.

And a t bow spawn

Holy wrench is shit when u only have 5 pray pots, take 6ppots instead

Slayer on a pure usually isn‚Äôt too profitable, at least in my experience.  Maybe down the road it becomes profitable (I‚Äôm only 83 slayer), but currently, slaying efficiently (cannon, blowpipe, prayer potions, etc) I usually lose money.  The exception is doing wildy slayer, I can profit off the emblems. 
---
Theyre having fun small guy
---
On another note I found them the most aids grind I've done on Ironman, glad I never have to go back there 
---
Lol. Jagex love drama.
---
Teal hat season was a rollercoaster man. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Yep! It's a kind of animation used in Wallace and Grommit, and the movies Chicken Run and Coraline. They use flexible clay on wire frames with swappable expressions and take tons of pictures of the figures in different poses to make a movie, kidna like old time, hand-drawn cartoons. 
---
How do I change it?
---
I‚Äôm currently 66 magic and I have a Dust Devils task. Since I cannot cast Ice Burst yet, would using Smoke/Shadow burst be a decent alternative until I can cast Ice Burst?
---
Really there is no way unless you have 2 devices like a phone and a tablet 
---
Parallel space
---
No. Since none of the areas Konar assigns black demons in contain demonic gorillas, you can't kill demonic gorillas on Konar tasks. 
---
It really is a fact though because of all the research done on the subject. He‚Äôs trying to call it conjecture based on the fact their is no evidence for this case. But if they never give it a chance then they can just forever say it‚Äôs just conjecture and there is no proof. It‚Äôs only not a fact on a technicality for as long as they don‚Äôt at least try it. It‚Äôs like saying something works in every single other case that it happens in but we don‚Äôt know if it will be the same here since we haven‚Äôt tried it so it must not be a fact. It‚Äôs a little dumb imo 
---
Change what?
---
damn 175k ea already :o
---
why are so many people responding with cringe gifs, what idiots to disgrace settled.
---
My main is a pure as well, for money I do wildy slayer, wildy bosses, and revs.  I‚Äôd suggest getting a high total level too since it‚Äôs your main.  I‚Äôm 83 combat and can farm revs/wildy bosses etc in relative safety on 1750 worlds.  That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt other pures/meds that have 1750 as well, you can still be attacked, but you aren‚Äôt going to have 30 pures roll up on you like you would in nontotal worlds.

Yup
---
Xp wise, those patches aren't really worth it, but if you've got access to Fossil Island then I'd suggest doing mahogany trees and Yanillian hops. Mahoganies give huge xp drops, and use Yanillian hops as the payment for protection. Since the seeds are dirt cheap and the actual hops are fairly expensive, you'll save yourself a ton of money by growing your payments yourself (and depending on how often you do them, you'll have plenty of extras that you can sell to pay for the mahogany seeds/saplings)

Q
---
I just blowpipe and pray mage. Usually not too much of a headache 
---
im about to be fired for the laughs you caused me during my work time
---
Do I want to use Salve Amulet (ie) at Vork during DS2? Last night I completed the quest up until Vork then had to go to bed but I plan on finishing it today. 
---
Also, my friend is loaning me his DHCB for Galvek, so should I use that for Vork (in quest) or still blowpipe? 93 ranged at the moment. 
---
They made it okay to swap again in the upcoming season.

If you start a game with your alt in the other team and the alt leaves, do you get the points or are they forfeited?

After I saw the "you're not gonna complete varrock rara you're farming karma" comment on your last post I've been waiting for this. Keep it going man!!
---
Only at 70 Ranged sadly.
---
Zeah rcing would become completely broken. 
---
But difficult to use bp without 75 ranged haha.
---
Gets a lot faster with blowpipe so only a few levels. I‚Äôd also get so blessed d hide for better prayer praying mage. Honestly I waited till 95 Cb to imbue slayer helm and I regret it that range accuracy really makes stuff faster.

---
Range em rune arrows and mani for cheap gear. Bring range pots and pray Mage if you can afford pray pots. If not bring a full invent of food and collect the bones. Don't melee them though as they will use magic and melee on you if you're close.

Care to explain the process of changing the email address without having access to it?

Security questions will allow you to 'recover' the account but you still cant log in due to the authenticator, dissabling that requires email confirmation and and so does changing email.

Im happy to be proven wrong, but this happened to me a few weeks ago with no ill effect

I can confirm these guys are legit. I got an unranked and used a middleman with no problems. Quick and easy. Thanks for the service

Thank you for taking the time to post and for using the clan chat. Appreciate it

---
Yeah and you could also pay Jagex to get unbanned. I think it was like 3 months worth of membership or something. They'd out negative credits and you just bring it back to 0

One hell of a rollercoaster this was
---
Salve and dhcb certainly make the fight a lot easier. Make sure to take an anti dragon fire shield with the crossbow and pray mage instead of range. Also, I suppose you're using void, but if you're not, definitely use that as well.
---
Good idea, I'm surprised the drops are even announced tbh
---
on top of the other stuff pointed out that you've likely lied about, your stats and gear dont exactly convince me that you had 600m either. All your buyables are lvl 70-80ish, you dont seem to even have ma2 cape or cerb boots (as far as we can see, but why wouldnt you show that instead of your barrows stuff?)and your only 99s are cooking and melees.
---
How do you know he actually completed the kill? Could have just done 50% damage then stopped.
---
This is going to sound sketchy as fuck but if you need a middleman to help you transfer I wouldn't mind helping out. 
---
For non Ironman accounts pvm is the only content worth doing

Thank you for using the clan and taking the time to post. I appreciate it and hope you have a great day

Almost every Aussie I have ever met in the last 10-15 years of online gaming has been like EVscape. And the other ones I know and have known are not streamers, so they don't have that excuse. In any case, I don't think the Aussie identity the way that EV presents it is something to be ashamed of. Lots of people, myself included, love AU people! Embrace it, cunt

Okay cool. I just have normal void, is that good enough?
---
I‚Äôm already pretty nervous üòÅBut i was also incredibly nervous at Zulrah the first few times until I got the hang of it. I have a 3m cash stack for expected deaths, so I won‚Äôt stop trying until I get it tonight
---
Tbh I am not too worried about Galvek because I‚Äôve watched so many videos, but I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll slip up a few times there as well. Basically just gonna move after every shot. 
---
Should I use long-ranged or rapid on the crossbow? 
---
All members areas. 
---
True, but wouldn‚Äôt a ranking activity be for engaging/fun?
---
I do the soy face so hard everytime s new episode comes out
---
I would go for a prayer gear loadout for both ranged (blessed d'hide) and melee (proselyte). Protect from Magic on at all times. Ranged is the preferred method because then they can't do any damage, if you melee you should still bring a little food because they will occasionally switch from magic to melee. 
---
You should obviously imbue the slayer helm. I would buy some devout boots (very cheap investment for great prayer bonus).

Doesn't really matter. The coordinates of his cursor would never change unless he somehow touched the trackpad with something that would actually register on the track pad to move the cursor a bit every now and then

It's a restricted game mode of runescape, the point is that you're not able to use banks. Being able to note items yourself would make the game mode much easier. At that point you may as well go play standard ironman. Not to mention this would devalue the accounts that are maxed or near maxed on UIM accounts.
---
My point is nobody is forcing you to play UIM, the restrictions are there and you chose to play with them

Using the blowpipe is a super fast and super expensive method. Between blowpipe and pray pots I sink a few hundred k in a 150 kill task, base range 91. This is with range pots and eagle eye prayer. The drops just are not good enough to make up for it unless you're lucky with the harpoon drops, and those are only about 700k currently.
---
Otherwise it will take some time to complete the task. Melee is going to cost you in food at lower levels. ranged with a cbow is going to take a decent amount of time. My recommendation is to either swallow the cost of the blowpipe for the high xp rates or block the task. It takes too long and does not yield good enough drops IMO.
---
You won't get banned for not moving your cursor while alching :)
---
i feel you dude. it's pretty damn scuffed. can't do much about it though just gotter persist i suppose. i'm at 370 without a drop now it's pretty stupid
---
Damn seemed to change his name pretty fast.  Def should be reported for bug abuse major if OP hasn't made an effort to get it fixed. /u/jagexacorn

lots of people dont touch the mouse when they alch with the number pad :)
---
Mine has traveled with me to other GWD rooms as well.  Luckily I duo most of it since I'm not iron and my duo's rng isn't near as bad. 
---
It‚Äôs something that wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen. That would be classed as a bug.
---
In the original metagame, Mining was the most profitable skill and Falador had the best access to mining, so the lack of an altar balanced out Falador with the other cities
---
Allotments with snape grass are a little pricey in gp/xp (so are Maple Trees tho) but give a LOT of xp per day if you're looking to smash out some farming levels. You're not really going to make any real money on allotments, but you can make a bit of cash with flowers (I do limps) and hops. 
---
For more cash, I do whiteberry runs and pick potato cactus. All 5 berry patches are pretty accessible with TP's and the run is quite quick. I never bother re-planting these because the XP is minimal, I just hit them up after every herb run because they'll have fully regrown their crops. The single potato cactus in the farming guild is paying for a LOT of skilling. 
---
I don't think mouse coordinates mean anything when it's legitimate to hotkey a keyboard to act as a mouse click, since your mouse never has to move then either.

Not really. A bug is an error in the code. This is a manual fix error

I used blowpipe and got fucked by the healers 5 times. Brought a rcb swap specifically for jad to pull the healers out of healing distance and worked down jad like that got the first try with that setup. Glgl

Maybe this year he‚Äôll scrape 50%?

My advice is ignore them. I have had to ignore a dozen or so people from the CC because they tell you to add them then ask for money. But if you have 15 minutes of time, which you should, just camp out the CC and spam every 60 to 90 seconds what your trying to accomplish.
---
Over the past 6 months I've gotten 3 accounts done on Hero's quest without having to make an alt or pay anyone. The CC works, just gotta wade through the opportunists.
---
Same with the Morytania Hard diary, if you go the the Trouble Brewing world and sit in the CC within an hour you'll have the trouble brewing game completed. I did mine at 4am EST on a tuesday with server population at a balmy 285. 
---
My point is that the Clan Chats work even if they have a few greedy pricks in them. I don't want people reading this comment chain assuming its difficult because the CC takes all the effort out of most of these "problems".

Because he has the imaginary social anxiety about reaching out to a CC for help. A lot of people play OSRS and many other mmo's completely solo and what that means is that when they do have to engage in the multiplayer aspect of the game they have social trepidations because idk, humans are weird.
---
What people are trying to do in this thread is encourage those type of users to get out there and use the systems in place to finish the mandatory multiplayer content. I know how they feel and it's all mental.

---
I know what you're talking about but that's not it. I could have sworn there was an official post about osrs stance on physical clickers, but my mind may be mixing two things.

This is incorrect - they are the exact same in stats and give the same amount of slayer XP. In fact, with each tier of the Morytania diary giving 2.5% extra slayer XP per tier whilst completing slayer tasks in the slayer tower you would get more XP from Abyssal demons in the slayer tower. However, you can only receive totem pieces from those situated in the catacombs.
---
I included a short summary in another comment I'll link below. It maximizes afk exp. I did rock cake for hours, by after discovering this, I went from all 70 combat to all 80+ in a week. It's more AFK than sand/ammonite crabs, and you don't have to fight for spots.

I come from a coding background, in taxes not games, but I wanted to address your comments.

Bugs are categorically issues with the code that impacts end users in ways otherwise not wanted or not expected. Bugs are not hot fixes.
---
The changing of attack style in this case was a bug.
---
What jagex did to this guys account is more  like "hotfix". What he's being "pedantic" about, is if Jagex hot fixes his account, they shouldn't be able to come back and slap him in the mouth for doing a shit job, or claiming they fixed it and instead made it worse (at they have).
---
Because he's not interacting with the world, and because it's the developers independent actions that have affected his 1.2m defense xp, no, it's not a bug. It was a  "fix" (if you can call it that), not a section of broken game this guy is exploiting.
---
Are you feeling ok man
---
I don't actually watch the videos however I do know he uploads one per week with a few being delayed a day. A week is a long time to get good rng with repetitive tasks, obviously this is purely my opinion on the matter and I don't know what truly goes on so do take it with a pinch of salt because I may be wrong :)

You can only have 1 clue picked up at a time, but you can have as many on the ground that you own as you'd like. You have to, with a clue scroll in your possesion, complete 3-5 steps to get a casket.
---
If Settled gets another clue with a mort step (He has to keep picking his current one off the ground and dropping it while he gets kills, or the next won't spawn), he can pick up one, walk a few squares, drop it, pick up the other one, etc, on the way to complete that clue step, rinse and repeat. If after completing a step, he gets a clue scroll back with a step he can't do, he abandons it and continues his other mort clue, until he completes the treasure trail.

I do that even when I don't wanna train, its so funny
---
Some people are better off not commenting, this is one of them.
---
venezuelans and bots make steels bars. Think they got electricity back so it could be they're catching up
---
I don't know how this comment is relevant, I understand what you're trying to say but it doesn't apply here.  The attempt on my email only occurred after verification, so if you're inplying that my account is suddenly worth 100x more after email was autheticated, I don't think that's correct to assume
---
like i said in the post, don't shitpost or unnecessarily post on my thread. wastes time, thanks!
---
When i was 8 that was the first thing i thought
---
If you give it to me I will trim the inside for you.
---
I want to point out that since the account has already been hacked and its only 1250 total level, start over.
---
Next time take your account security more importantly. OSRS is like the wild wild west of mmorpg's where if you go walk in the bushes to take a shit you'll get a gun up your butt as they take your slacks, guns, and backpack.
---
* You need 2FA on e-mail and OSRS
---
* Considering making a dummy login. Use a 10 minute e-mail to create the account then change the email in the account to an email you exclusively use for OSRS. Make it google as google has had the best free email security I've personally found. If you have 10 euros to spare I recommend post Posteo, it's a german email company which can encrypt everything and make it even to the point where without email and your 2FA login you have to contact their support to get back into the account.
---
* Understand everyone wants your shit. They just do. That random friend you made ingame? Enjoy his company but it could be a trust scam, OSRS players are ruthless.
---
* Change your password every 60 to 90 days. It seems people think your password is for life, that's how you wind up on [https://www.haveibeenpwned.com/](https://www.haveibeenpwned.com/)
---
* When you have 72 hours of not playing the game consider changing up your pin from time to time. There is a delay to change it but if you go away for the weekend throw in a new pin. Same concept as a new password every 60 to 90 days.
---
* Your pin needs to be on a 7 day removal, nothing else suffices.
---
It's unfortunate, especially because this might be several hundred hours worth of content you have to give up. But you made a mistake, have owned up to it, and won't make it again I presume.
---
This is a you live and learn type of situation, you'll always remember it. Even when your 50.
---
Just use the new RuneLite plugin
---
Was about the same for me, maybe a little less than that. Bronze defender easily took the longest for me, ended up getting the iron on my first kill and steel through mithril wasnt too bad, but from adamant to dragon it took me so many fucking tokens.
---
I know you can get totem pieces, but I assumed since everything in the catacombs is stronger and higher lvled they would be to..
---
What a waste, DT is ez. Pay her to runecraft
---
it's not gonna happen. There's plenty of UIM that have been playing just fine without it for years. What you're suggesting is a complete meta-changer and it won't ever happen
---
A guy had some sort of kid‚Äôs toy that looked like a power drill with a flathead bit in it taped to his mouse and he got banned
---
Me too thanks
---
He just misplelled "no fap"
---
I'm not sure how it would detect it if you are randomizing the time between clicks and duration of the click within a reasonable human-like range though.
---
Nah. Nobody touches my stuff and it's passworded anyways.
---
People that couldn‚Äôt afford black on F2P used to say this all the time lol
---
The more the better
---
Can vouch for this, I brought sharks on my first try and had to tab out. Brews + Tank gear makes it relatively easy
---
Depends on the way the question is asked.
---
If the question is ‚Äúwhat are the odds of 3 Karil‚Äôs tops drops in a row?‚Äù Then the answer is correct as OP stated.
---
If the question is, ‚Äúwhat are the odds of getting any 3 items in a row?‚Äù Then your answer is correct.
---
The 4th one is actually the smartest, because you want that slayer helm bonus for the quest ;D
---
If you're looking for money don't do trees. I stopped doing willows past the early levels because they weren't worth the time and the higher level trees cost too much for the xp they provide.  
---
For allotments you can do watermelons for compost to save yourself money on having to buy your own, and sell any extra. At 85 I still do watermelons because unlike the other allotments they make supercompost when put into the compost bin, so I only need to bring volcanic ash rather than ash and a compost potion to turn it into ultra.  
---
For flowers I usually protect the allotments to ensure I get 15 ultracompost but in the Hosidius patch which is disease-free with 50% favour or higher, I plant limpwurt roots for money.  
---
Hops you can do yanillians or jutes, they're both about 1k each usually but yanillians give slightly more xp and the protection is cheaper. If yanillians drop significantly then switch to jutes. The seeds are dirt cheap and I probably get around 20 hops per patch while the cost to plant is only like 1k including protection, so that's actually on par with the average profit from a ranarr patch if not slightly higher, and it doesn't die.
---
For fruit trees I go for harvesting coconuts for money (6 coconuts are 9k and take like 30 seconds to harvest) rather than replanting trees for XP but that's just down to your personal preference.  
---
Cactus patches are worth doing as well, cactus spines and potato cactus are both 1k each so it doesn't really matter which one you choose to do, though potato cactus grow faster. Luckiest I've gotten was 21 cactus spines in one harvest.  
---
I personally do bush patches as well but I can understand if other people don't as they don't give much xp per harvest and white berries are only 350gp each right now.
---
Without the humor tag so many people are thinking this is real
---
Yes, a guy.
---
Critikal is not special at all
---
Gotta thank their moms
---
OG Flair
---
The dealer uni lmao
---
Why not? No penalty for making a hardcore. 
---
Well that's just not true
---
It's there for if you change your mind (as you should) or in case you're a trash hacker
---
you lose your items if you die in an instance Pepega
---
If you completely forgot the account details, you would NEVER be given all of the email logins associated with that account. 
---
If you‚Äôre planning to back to f2p after the 2 weeks, you should try and get a rune scimitar as it‚Äôs prob your best f2p weapon (Fire giants or zammy warriors), a rune kiteshield (Trolls) and also and get prayer up by killing blue drags and using the bones at wildy altar. 
---
Yeah I've heard similar things. People in RS3 told me the best GP/hr is to just do ToB and swap the money to OSRS.
---
I really love the look of third age. If I could i'd melee slayer in it but I don't have the cash to splash for that :(
---
If someone hits a boss when you're already fighting it they also roll for loot?
---
Sorry, I mean a *sexy* guy
---
Shut it down 
---
I would really like the option I played a ton back in the day under this era and idk if the majority of people playing are like me or if current graphics was what they played in. Would anyone know about that? BTW I hate summoning. 
---
QC at a Pharmaceutical Company (I only play when pooping, not in the lab)
---
If only that were the case to my fresh f2p hardcore ironman trying to get kills at hill giants
---
I think he meant, why train like that on a hardcore. e.g. Making an unique Ironman PK account or autism or just enjoying training there etc. 
---
Well you're most likely a guy irl so they're not wrong :) 
---
This would be a great sex toy
---
If yoy are disabled, then what am I? I did this 3 times back to back.
---
I cant play this trash anymore, enough is enough.
---
Hi my names Devon and I also clicked on the Facebook comments knowing full well I'm on reddit. 
---
Much better to spec your dummy in house imo. With 99 prayer and a spec, depending on gear,I usually walk in to afk with 130+ prayer. This is usually enough to last longer than aggro so I can just hit my house pool, spec the dummy again and head back.
---
And a lot of people don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs constantly changing as bots are constantly combating it. You can do this and it will likely go undetected for a long time but will likely eventually be detected. They don‚Äôt talk about HOW they do it because it would allow bots to combat it. I agree logically it makes sense you could make a macro that would be undetectable that easily but if that were true it would have been done and it would be a much larger problem. 
---
I‚Äôm always curious as to how long people generally poop for cus I see this being said everywhere. How constipated are you people?? Eat a prune. 
---
Y'all accept students from close unis? I play smash with some of the people from uob society
---
Man thats my post over a year ago people still remember that lmfao 
---
Back 2 back? Very disabled indeed. Welcome
---
Clearly haven‚Äôt read through this thread if you think 97% of people would want it, not to mention it would take a ridiculous amount of time to implement.
---
whoever does the most damage gets the kill, however, if you're an ironman, if someone does any damage at all to a boss or enemy, you no longer get the drop regardless of if you did the most damage
---
near max with almost t90 gear in RS3 is equivalent of a 100 combat 1500 total account in osrs lol
---
1080 kc at gorillas and still no zenyte... 4 light frames thoughüôÑüò§
---
Using the in game guides can provide a bit of help without offering too much information. You can see those just by clicking on the skill box for whatever skill you are interested in leaning more about. For agility the Gnome Stronghold Agility Course is your best bet if you are level one. Also if you do use the wiki make sure that it's the new one. If you were just to google "osrs wiki" i'm fairly sure the old one still probably pops up first. [Here's a link to the hunter guide on the new wiki if you are interested.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hunter_training)
---
Pre-nerf and before rs3 gp/h became this high, doing profit snake and transferring was the best rs3 gp method. 
---
We technically do, no idea how active it is though. 
---
Yes
---
Chaeldar is in Zanaris
---
Have you thought about just killing them? I just did it on second try (messed prayers on first try and got 1 shot before even healers). Slayer task and helm, Karil's, fury, blessed boots, Odium ward, Accumulator, Barrows glowes, Armadyl xbow and Diamond dragon bolts. Bastion potted and turned on Eagle eye before Jad.
---
Jad went super fast and I just blew the healers. They died so fast that I thought I was missing one but they died so quick. Decided to leave one up just healing Jad as it didn't matter as Jad too died so fast. Didn't have to pot once during Jad and still had like 20 prayer left of 76.
---
Purdue E&amp;M. Got a 29%. Highest grade in the class. Feels good/bad man
---
Yeah, I am. 
---
Lmao he deleted his comment because he realized he was being a prick when he was wrong 
---
i don't really consider that old school tbh. they were put in the wildy back in the day because it literally wasn't a pvp zone anymore.
---
Are those glasses an actual item in osrs? 
---
Use 2 emails specifically for Runescape.
---
So many people throw their accounts on their main emails, not knowing that with every site you post an email to, that's a possibility that their database had a leak.
---
I highly recommend everyone check this site ~once per week to check if any sites they accessed with their email had a leak: https://haveibeenpwned.com/
---
Make him a guide for this so he explains how to do it, give him his gear and make him carry you to the end but you don't get rewards, instead, he'll tell you how useful all those slayer tomes are.
---
Lmfao that's wild
---
I'm not the guy for that, but hey... after completing the clue the very first guard dropped [something funny ](https://imgur.com/0hIDoyr)
---
Gz man, I started doing barrows last week, got karils leathertop on my 8th chest, torag helm on the 9th and Guthans chest on like the 13th or 14th. Of course now im about 60 chests in and havent gotten anything else, hopefully my luck hasn‚Äôt dried up.
---
No but they should be. 
---
Story of my life
---
You win some, you lose some
---
Buy high sell high.  Do everything high.  Hehe weed 420 xd lmao gottem
---
That‚Äôs embarrassing because I just bought the helmet in hopes that one day I‚Äôll have the complete armor set, so I look really out of place when I wear it. 
---
Hey good looking homo sapiens of indiscernible gender.
---
 Meet Roadletics, my Left-Hand Lane locked Hardcore Ironman.  After recently Purchasing my Bugatti I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No speed limit, no blinker, but this time I can't leave the left-hand lane. All leading up to eventually taking on one of lives biggest challenges, the Freeway. 
---
what is that method bro
---
I feel physically ill. 
---
you're giving me flashbacks to basic with that one m8
---
Yup! I tried a few methods but realized I would be happier and less discouraged if I wait a few years to have more money to work with instead. Definitely will return to it after I go back to work.
---
Technically speaking, 1/73,035,000 describes the odds of getting *a specific* item 3 times in a row, whereas 24/73,035,000 are the odds of getting any 3 of the same item in a row
---
Boss makes a dollar when I make a dime, that‚Äôs why I poop, on company time 
---
I dont get why people are so hyped about this swampletics guy ( not offending him) but i wanna know the exact reason 
---
So eloquently put
---
I botted 99 magic with an autoclicker and still am not banned. Did 99 fletching too
---
Exactly what I pulled it from haha
---
Surely TOB.  
---
He can't level skills like rc/thieving aside from lamping/genies afaik.
---
Hey my Internet was down and she was a solid 3/10
---
imagine thinking this is any different than using a script
---
youre an idiot
---
run glories/rings of wealth
---
Karil‚Äôs top IS a specific item, what exactly are you correcting? Jesus Christ 
---
I was not phished, no. I know about that.
---
h
---
Yeah I'm aware of this. But I already use a unique password and email. All of my gmails have 2 step auth via phone and google auth as well.
---
LMAO, literally got dropped in 1 tick
---
Preserve actually works very strangely and the wiki is incorrect.
---
As you know, skills drain every 60s. You have to turn on preserve at least 15s before the next skill drop for it to have an effect.
---
The weirdest part is how long you need to keep the prayer on. If your current skill drain has been preserve boosted to 90s, turning preserve off at 30s+ drops your skill drop timer by 30s. This is likely to stop people flicking the prayer. However, turning preserve off between 15-29s of the next skill drop only drops the timer by 15s. And turning preserve off at 14s or less has no effect, rather than instantly dropping the skill.
---
underused  word imo. we need more oscillation 
---
sup üÖ±Ô∏è
---
You said "any of the same items in a row", which denotes there are 24 separate successful outcomes, one for each individual barrows drop. Dude you replied to originally was wrong in his reasoning.
---
The wiki explains all the methods quite well
---
I've gotten 2 in 36 kc :) 
---
Hail state?
---
I don't want it
---
If your running into him you should definitely have pray melee up the entire time
---
ARCLIGHT
---
Anyways, I usually wear tank with a 4 item switch, weapon/offhand/body/amulet or ring should do the trick. Can make it 6 way with both amulet and ring, and legs.
---
A big part of trips being shorter or longer depends on how well you can predict the incoming attacks. I always pray mage when it could be either mage or range. Otherwise, if you find yourself taking damage often, try paying more attention to the gorilla's attacks instead of your own.
---
Before the update you could only get it from chambers of xerics(raid1). After the konar dungeons release slayer monsters drops them now too.
---
I've killed 500 and got 5 so far, that 1/100 drop rate bois 
---
You're thinking of Mazchna
---
This is the best, "jagex doesn't hide pole results" ever
---
So follow the wiki strategy guides suggestion is your recommendation? I will go take a look at it. 
---
It's not retarded to get 20k runecrafting xp/hour over paying for someones dinner
---
Nah. You switch to mage/ranged and run right away. Then as soon as you see the hit splat you change to prot melee. This is in my opinion the easiest way to do it for a new player.
---
even auto clicker it self doesnt get picked up by anti cheating. like trust me it doesnt.
---
Id love it. Not ezscape. Handyscape :3
---
If youre going 1 train to 99 str and nothing else why not make a hcim, you can just de iron after if you want but you will look TURBO autistic whilst doing it
---
You rarely need to get hit. Just use the rune lite plugin; it tells you what to pray. When you have to make a guess between melee and another always choose the other and just don‚Äôt be in melee range.  You can do this without the plug in as well; you just need to count the 3 attacked in your head.
---
Your ‚ÄúI usually get hit once before switching‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense. Just have the payer tab open. It‚Äôs not like it takes long to click the icon.
---
You the real MVOP with all this info
---
I loved the tool belt but yes the inventory space saver would hurt the game in so many ways, especially for ironmen/ultimate ironmen 
---
Not allowed, sorry
---
I never liked the toolbelt tbh
---
Personally I like Rargh, I dont know if he is well known or not
---
Definately ! 
---
The [Dragon Sword](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_sword) was previously only available as a rare drop from Chambers of Xeric. On January 15th Kebos Lowlands was released and now its a drop from Wyrms.
---
looks like SOMEONE isn‚Äôt getting a deep cum in my ass
---
Same exact thing happend to me 3 days ago. Buddy messaged me on snapchat asking me if I wanted to do some bossing but  I was at work and wasn't even logged in. By the time I had downtime to check mobile my bank was cleaned. Bank pin still intact. and 2 step still there. Also scanned with malware bytes but its saying I'm clean.
---
MY PANTS ARE WET, no for real if this comes out there is no way im graduating school
---
Im 2nd one and poor lol
---
As opposed to Nieve and trailer park boys pics? i'll take Swampletics any day
---
Yeah I guess I can agree with that. It was pretty non substantial but I didn‚Äôt intend for it to bring attention to myself or my pronunciation, but rather to express my annoyance. It was a bit juvenile though and I probably could‚Äôve kept the thought to myself. I guess it‚Äôs just a weird pet peeve
---
That name is disgusting 'Angels Scapes' call yourself angel scape or angels scape or angel scapes. 
---
no
---
I see people saying this so often that I don't think they're able to easily detect autoclickers.
---
Until you have to do anything that requires more than a passing interaction with your inventory. 
---
Critikal got banned for something very similar to this
---
And every time someone completes with him, Swampletics gets a Genie Random Event.
---
I am really not sure, I don't know what kind of paints to use on them so I have not purchased any yet. If anyone knows what type is best for painting PLA, let me know.
---
Necklace looks meh. 3a skirt looks meh. New dual zenyte(?) bracelet looks cool. 
---
Indeed, who plays RS3 anyways?
---
I think hes gunna do TOB till he gets something significant, scythe, staff, rapier, probs not defender.
---
Slayer. Trying to get bursting tasks but no luck and out of points üòÇ 
---
It took me 14 years to realize there's dreads in the game. wut

Yes please

Turtle tale and Rargh
---
Every standard coding language has a built in PRNG function.

Thanks. I'm at work now but I'll watch it when I get home
---
Threshold for a first.
---
I was to young for p2p :X by the time I got p2p when rs2 was out and my dialup couldn't handle it.
---
 I would buy pbp pins(offsite bonds) for 1m and pk or skill or chill in dray or just explore tbh.

2003 is when I started, 2006 is the miniclippers and I left until 2008 or 2009.

Well in that case that‚Äôs not the problem since It‚Äôs definitly a problem on their end, not mine.
---
I've gotten 4 in 4 kc :)
---
i assume those are alch runes in the pouch? wiki suggests venge runes, thoughts on that? I assume the angler u eat just before officially beginning the trip so u dont have to deal with droping the food for bp/tbow switch? Finally what do u think should be the ratio of supplies if sgs isn't an option? 1 less super cb and 1 less rang for 2 more mantas maybe?
---
Money because I can make the money way faster than the gp
---
I'd say get herblore up to like 50 or so then grind out some wintertodt
---
Even still, they'd have to get past the bank pin
---
Yes, and? If you generate random values long enough with the same seed it will repeat eventually. That's how PRNG works.
---
He's gearing up... Just needs to find that gmaul.
---
Where's the best place to 1-tick Karambwans? Hosidius kitchen? Myths guild? Tzhaar city?
---
I'm taking this as factually correct
---
Why do you need the money? Use it to level up your skills instead and you will unlock some good money makers. Money that is just sitting around is wasteful 
---
It‚Äôs an iOS issue I believe 
---
RS3 is bad. RS3 hides poll results.  Therefore, hiding poll results is bad.  
---
Check mate liberals you were just DESTROYED BY LOGIC and FACTS
---
Use bone crossbow from 28 range to 50 range and then to switch magic shortbow at 50 range.  Make sure to imbue your MSB. I would even use rune arrows whilst training with MSB as they're pretty cheap (only 91 each) and are worth the upgrade over addy.
---
I would also highly suggest getting Ava's device if you haven't got it already
---
wait til i grab ahold ;)
---
wait... YOU CAN ALCH NOTED ITEMS ??? WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I BEEN DOIN
---
Lmao it's a joke from when  he used to play runescape 
---
Upvoted for jmod smack down
---
I spent a lot of time in brum as I don't live far away and this comment is 1000% correct
---
I'm just waiting for the old school old school version.
---
A guy who used to make good content and then jumped the shark years ago
---
Na he stands alone 
---
Also rogues in the wildy
---
Why would you want to play a game where you can make 80m/hour lmao basically mopar scape
---
Swampletics needs three medium clue scrolls in the next episode. Would you be a kind soul and sacrifice them for swamps's rng?
---
I like it but it would be better if it only hells like 2-4 items at a time
---
Second for Turtle tale
---
Every time you go thru the bog: you can donate 30 hunter xp and he‚Äôll check his algorithm and get you thru as fast as possible
---
Honestly there should be no inside trim on all of them it's a more interesting design
---
yeah I feel like you can find fun things to do at all levels on runescape. And having so many skills to level is awesome cuz that dopamine rush when the level up pops always feels like progress. 
---
When I used to play WoW, it was fun, but the grind of leveling a new character was just "ok what is the fastest way to grind out these levels so I can start doing raids at max" WoW feels like its all about getting that next good gear piece, but runescape is more than that. Hard to put into words really.
---
Literally no different then a macro with a  random time interval. Enjoy the ban
---
Thanks, looks promising! I work with Hanwha's, also Korean made :)
---
you just ruined a extremely rare account lmao. 
---
Never rwt but I base each mill as ¬£0.50 and when my other half‚Äôs friends come round and try to take the piss if I‚Äôm playing I tell them oh btw that‚Äôs over ¬£1000 right there. Soon shuts them up.
---
Who are you trying to impress? Cheating ruins the experience. 
---
Just promote the coleader to leader and you‚Äôll be automatically demoted
---
Credit card. I have 2 accounts and work a lot, so I cant be bothered to grind out GP for bonds on each account every 2 weeks.

Do you leave your computer on unattended? If you did have a RAT, they'd have to login through your computer / IP directly in order to bypass your google 2FA.

When you get older you do
---
Username checks out 
---
shhhh.
---
they will lol
---
Yes they did. And most ironmen have a plan of action for their account. Black dhide is tier 70 gear. And hard to obtain on an account that cant trade.
---
Just because the market in osrs is fucked doesnt mean the market should punish the players who chose to do nothing with it.

my twin stats buddy &lt;3
---
I don't think I ever successfully blocked an attack in one of those simulators. I have my Fire cape though
---
what has the world become when people get offended by words?  Play with public off, not hard to click the button.  If it makes you feel better i myself play with public off that way i dont have to deal with idots or bots spamming.
---
Lol never once bought spins and there are plenty of other bosses that are post eoc and require eoc. Your argument was well these bosses made before eoc dont require it well no duh. And you really did answer my question of if you have played recently. I agree eoc was trash at first which is what this entire sub thinks eoc is but the game has changed and is way different. Like I said both games are fun but one definitely has an actually combat system that people enjoy.
---
Isn't the air altar there? Or is that still placed in Varrock. Haven't visited in like a decade.
---
For people new to p2p and making a main, the best time to start is after most if not all of the f2p quests are done
---
Nah for most people the key is they‚Äôre inefficient with their play time. You can get to around 1800 total on a normal account in a few months playing a couple hours a day including quest cape if you actually focus on progression. Like I said though, it‚Äôs fine to be inefficient if you‚Äôre having fun.
---
You are ready for p2p as soon as you leave tutorial island. Progression as f2p is like 5-10x slower. 
---
I think they did say something about not being able to do exact values and needing to round to nearest level or something like that. Even if it wasn't as simple as an extra 0, the decimal could be why it was a digit higher than intended.
---
Got wood? Wood get.
---
It was originally a medieval kids fantasy game dude
---
Well at least we know what the least bought armour is
---
If the players want it. Sure. 
---
I agree rs3 should be deleted and resources should go to improve graphics and such for osrs, theres no reason to keep a game alive for 10k players.
---
God damnit I was actually contemplating on that idea then I read the rest of your comment. Lol
---
You say, "Forbes, PcGamer, ect.." like there's more than just those two. Can you name anything else off the top of you head? I certainly can't. Don't get me wrong, I really think he's had a massive positive impact on the game, but don't misrepresent things man
---
I always consider finishing every F2P quest and receiving your rune platebody as the starting point for membership
---
black (g) was like one of the biggest flex armors at one point and I'll never forget
---
Honestly if Jagex hired me I could solve their bot problem 
---
Measuring click intervals to detect bots is not a sound approach. Bot programs usually randomize delays
---
However if I built a machine learning algorithm that recorded every single click made by all accounts. And built a classifier that could cluster accounts that behaved the same accounting for their click intervals with slight delays. I can eventually classify all the bots 
---
PVP is dying because you need a secondary, specialized account to be viable at it, or get all 99 combat stats. Very few players have the time, patience, or motivation to do so.
---
66wc for mine here, almost triplets.
---
They aren‚Äôt impressed, they just think oh god that makes it worse. 
---
Think of it this way. If a kid told you his fortnight account was worth $1000, what would you think ? 
---
Rip.
---
wow they all look shit gj
---
And as soon as rs3 is removes osrs dies too since it is paying the bills to support the offshoot game.
---
they banned Critical, a huge YouTuber making a joke video at ardy knights with a toy drill 
---
they banned fan pen kid too 
---
they'll ban op too
---
9 hp is the lowest
---
It used to start at 1000xp. 
---
That's today
---
Yes, quite scytheisticated engineering.
---
It's in Varrock in RS3, Falador in OSRS
---
You know that you can see where Jad will spawn on wave 4, you don't need to wait for wave 62
---
that's definitely what I had in mind but I am rusty with my maths and convinced myself multiplying was the same as exponent lmfao
---
I still dont know what this is
---
Better graphics? The the common sense yeah, but they arent actually better. Game is overloaded with shit, last time i logged in it legit took me 5 minutes to find the logout button and close the pop ups on screen
---
Sand Spaghetti
---
Has more population then before eoc came out? less resources.  so already making more profit? How is this suppose to kill osrs?
---
I cringe a bit when I think about all the expensive tree seeds I 'gifted' to unassuming players. But at the same time, that ignorance is what made me addicted to UIM mode in the first place. Sitting at around 1350 total rn and still loving it.
---
I'm trying to recover my 14 year old account right now and this made me sad :(
---
so Jacksonpre39 is your surname?
---
U kinda deserve it for wearing an anguish necklace in bandos
---
Mate I'm not quite sure how to tell you this...
---
you skipped my first comment saying - mtx - eoc lol....
---
Yes any non-safe death while those items are there will result in them disappearing.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** madegon! ^(hug)
---
I never said they were impressed? 
---
I said it shuts them up. 
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about fornite other than it‚Äôs a fps sorry. 
---
You will lose those items I believe.
---
That's cause reddit is xp waste and full of normies
---
Have the posted what tier each of these new item is going to come from? I don't want to grind out rangers only to have to do more clues for my mole slips.
---
Thanks for the membership :)
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
I need to have chompy!  CHOMPY!
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah, I admit I didn't care at first. It doesn't seem like a fun way to play, at least to me.
---
BUT: I gave in and watched an episode around episode 12, and the binged the rest. 
---
It's RIDICULOUSLY good to watch. You get 10 minutes of him suffering god awful, tedious, unholy grinds that takes hours, and it's a fucking rush.
---
It's super fun and entertaining to watch AND you actually learn things about content that players basically just... ignored since release. 
---
To be fair: there's also the elf UIM, but... I just can't say it has the same charm. Settled is DEFINITELY skilled at presenting a series, and his attitude is honestly quite motivating.
---
He basically instantly became my favorite RS youtuber, and like most of this sub, I patiently await the next episode each week. 
---
I said #etc
---
Bonds. My main became a bbd/gargoyle alt for some time, used that to pay for my ironman, eventually got to a point where duplicates started paying for bonds. Such as 4 abby daggers at sire, barrows items, god pages, etc. 
---
I don't go there a lot, okay... :( Also depends on what you count as the Grand Exchange, is it everything within the walls or the market itself?
---
Dont worry - this is most likely what your mistake is. Otherwise theres no reason you cant get more than a 3 kill trip unless you are using very very bad items. B gloves and fire cape right? Or at least b gloves/torso/d def. Also incase you didnt know they pray after every 50 (minimum, you can deal over if you hit like a 35, 35 melee) damage you deal with that combat style. So if youre meleeing and you already hit a 35, pay attention to your exp if you get a big drop then go ahead switch to range fast. Theyre prayer changes fast too but i find it a sec faster if you just watch exp. This will speed up a little bit. 
---
But yeah you can basically do them with taking no damage, outside of the occasion where their next 2 attacks are range or mage. But always if its between melee and 1 other then take a step back and pray whatever isnt melee. Then just switch to melee if he comes to whack you. Good luck man! 
---
I love DGs. Theyre my fav slayer task. (Btw are you doing on task or off? I would prob do on task with 75 flat melees). They arent afk though but its fun and also they have great loot. Ive gotten super lucky rng with 2 zenytes through 2 tasks (on my 3rd task now finally lol at 60% through 86 slayer) but even without zenytes their other loot is great. Awesome money. Make sure to utilize piety/eagle eye too if youre not - those are essential. 
---
Nice, 71
---
Nice
---
holy shit.... there i was sitting at venenatis getting chased down by torvesta and ronald9009 not knowing i had over 200m on the line XD
---
I find the whole thing Sir Spicious.
---
Hint: this is probably what they actually do
---
can you please provide more info on that arm model?
---
He has a series that I really enjoyed where he shits on really bad/fake kickstarters.
---
I do this but the my internet spikes to 400 ping and I die, tbaytel hates me.
---
Adds value if you ask me. Unique item
---
The tens of thousands of f2p flax spinning and smithing bots bring in how much revenue? Wait 0 oh damn. But I am sure you are right shutting down the main game for the offshoot is a very bright business idea. Like I said I play both the off shot remake is fun but nothing compared to the real game
---
I used to use a mouse recorder and recorded myself doing it. I figure it can't get a lot more human than that.
---
Why are you standing by the chest. Not a big deal imo but I get it
---
So after you complete the step from the first clue, can you drop it or do you have to continue juggling it?
---
Why can't you:
---
Farm a clue with Morty step and complete step 1
---
Go back to farming clues while juggling completed clue
---
Do next clue you find with Morty step and leave old clue behind
---
Yeah DCB with Book of Law made it easier and tons cheaper than a Blowpipe in my experience. Better prayer bonus means less potting, longer range means not worrying about getting in melee range of Jad, and I could AOE spec the healers if I wanted to but I just tanked them
---
I want to grind 79 to 89 for that sick revs shortcut... But damn...
---
Which is why I never agree with banning people for having fun with a bug. Reset their progress, take away what ever they got, but permanently punishing people for your fuck up is dumb. 
---
Who goes for dinner nowadays, its all about that dollar menu at Tbell baby.

The game launched with a quest involving 2 penguins disguised as a sheep for no reason other than to be silly, but mole themed slippers - that's just too far.

Implying he needs protection. Please. 
---
Totally is, stretching a rubberband adds mass to it, but its on the order of like 10^-18 or less
---
That‚Äôs today
---
I heavily doubt they use advanced statistical techniques like machine learning 
---
I wouldnt start off with a 6 way switch though. Honestly i take a 3/4 way is all with anguish/bpipe/blessed top. I just wear arclight/tort/b ring/rest BiS melee with blessed legs. Dont really need a leg switch tbh except for maybe 50% the time when you need to tank a range hit if praying mage, but sometimes youre gonna be ranging at that moment anyways so i find it much easier to do this way. (The 4 way is for melee since my d def). I don't bring avas switch either just fire cape and mith darts in the pipe. 
---
I get 35-40+ kill trips or really just whenever my inven fills up with loot or im out of super comb/range pot. 
---
That's actually solid. Will deffo bring this up to the others! Cheers for the perspective too didn't really think of that. 
---
I agree I hated when these graphics came out. They ruined iconic items and character models. Even if you toggled off the HD part.
---
Kind of feel like dust devils beat out gargoyles they die quicker and drops average only a little bit lower then gargoyles long as you have herb sack gem bag and some peaches to bones you can stay down at dust devils forever.
---
Sounds like someone from 4chins
---
That necklace is an abomination. 
---
you mad jelly of my ¬£10000 fortnite account bro
---
*fortnite dabs*
---
You also have to realize that god d hide is basically black d hide with added prayer bonus like god rune sets are just rune with pray bonus
---
So if d hides were nerfed, they‚Äôd probably end up nerfing all d hides for it to make sense theoretically
---
He‚Äôs leaked into most social media outside of the game, fuck a Forbes or pcgamer (still significant accomplishments though).
---
Loool
---
big oof..
---
Someone just hit nw qith rolerscater -.-thanks

Anti venoms tend to be quite a bit cheaper as well. Serp helm consumes a lot of scales compared to the potions.

Welcome to my Ape Atoll ultimate ironman
---
A lot of the decent combat money makers are locked behind slayer, or have 75+ requirements.
---
So some general goals:
---
75 slayer is good because it unlocks gargoyles, which are afk and 500kish/hr
---
Another is Barrows, which you'll want 75 magic, a trident, and the moratanya hard diary done. 
---
This is around 750k to 1mil an hour.
---
75 range is great as it unlocks the blowpipe, which you'll need to do basically any mid-late game pvm
---
Fletching is extremely afk, but the money isnt amazing compared to other afk tasks like cooking.
---
Exactly. I kinda expected some hate from virgins, forever alone types, incels, and anyone who has never dealt with a woman full time. I get that it seems all fun - having sex, cuddling, and all that stuff...but the amount of energy, and effort required to keep them consistently pleased just wasn't worth it to me. I'm in my mid 20's and working on myself for the first time ever. Being single and treating myself as my main priority has been nothing but rewarding so far. I still see girls sometimes, I just don't desire anything too serious at the moment.

I've autoclicked so many accounts to 99 mage with garyshood, not even randomizing the clicking either, and I've once had an account banned or even warned
---
would sell the gold but wouldn't stop playing
---
helm is ugly af anyway 
---
It is magic.
---
I usually use godsword or whip with a defender depending on how hard I feel like hitting, (I don't use arclight because I only have 3k charges and I want to save those for soloing zammy on tasks when I'm higher leveled), and blowpipe with crystal hally for spec. I can usually do around 30 kills per trip with early to mid 80s stats while on task.
---
One big thing I'd highly suggest is bring tank melee/range def and default to prot mage, it dramatically helped my trips. I usually do zammy d hide top, verac skirt, slayer helm. I protect mage by default. I noticed their mage attack just seems far more accurate than melee or range, even when I wore full karils.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ brilliant 
---
Nice projection, homie. Good luck with the ladies!
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Crafting/Jewellery  
---
Unless you're an ironman, the profits aren't high so you're better off just selling them and doing something else that has higher gp/hour than crafting jewellery.  
---
Even if you wanted to train crafting, because it's a buyable skill the best way is usually to make money and then pay for the expensive methods rather than doing the cheaper but slower methods, and use the saved time to make money to offset the cost.
---
Agree the update would‚Äôve been fine if it was just toggleable HD.
---
But even if you toggled off the HD you were stuck with those ridiculous fat player models, silly running animations and the weird emotes. I hated it.

It's around 1:6 to 7 which works to bonds being 3mish on osrs and 18m+ on rs3
---
Wellll, I'm wrong then. 
---
It‚Äôs nearly 1:1 scale 
---
It just weird that they consistently keep fucking up super simple stuff like this. Like I get the tbow spawn, that was a freak chance accident, but with this stuff they just gotta put in a little fucking effort
---
Nothing.
---
People who get banned for this typically are just garyshood idiots 
---
Inb4 solo tbow drop on osrs
---
I've mostly done mining for the six bonds I've gotten so far. Once I got 85 I did a lot of rune mining, but it's slow and not worth it. I recommend motherload if you're afk to get to 85 or iron in the mining guild (it's better than zammy wine Imo).
---
I did the grind to 85 mining when there was a free week of members for Christmas.
---
I also use three bonds at a time since it gives a few more days. I'm now working on mort hard diaries so I can get double runes from barrows.
---
You sure know how to tell em mate
---
I made a conscious choice to not use the subreddit as a hashtag

You seem a lot more interested in shitting on pvpers than learning to pk

Start farming it‚Äôs passive so you should be doing it. It‚Äôs good income! I personally always shoot for my teleports first. Like grand tree for spirit tree access and starting fairy tale 2 so you can use fairy rings. It‚Äôs really helpful in getting around the new areas and offer cheap teleport. Also dwarf cannon quest to get you cannon will make slayer fly by at early levels.

He had to to mine rune essence for Priest in Peril
---
Already 99 so I doubt that's likely to happen
---
Autoclicking in theory should be the easiest as you're just looking for a consistent pattern over an extended period of time that no actual human would be able to maintain. EG you clicked the exact same spot every second for 6 hours straight without missing a click at any point.
---
I say in theory because obviously no one but the staff know how the bot detection works
---
Questing and slayer. Unlock areas/items useful for combat/money making through quests. Slayer for things like abby demons, hydras, smoke devils, etc. 
---
Any time you spend to build up cash now is going to be wasted in the long run. The kind of money you get through bossing and raids late-game easily dwarfs anything you'll make before then.
---
Thanks, man. I appreciate that
---
Just take 28 p ess (fill pouches), stews, spices and some super restores. I've never failed with that.
---
I'm getting near that. Basically my reasoning is that I never want the game to feel like a job, sure it's unlikely to ever happen but I don't want to feel like I have to play to keep my membership. I'd much rather just pay real money for my membership.
---
sadly this is bannable, funny as shit tho I hope the J-Mods take it as humor
---
My random event-locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my UIM, I decided to up the ante: to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave the Pheasant event. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Beekeeper event. 
---
fighting over spots was one of the best uses. That and being somewhere, wanting to go to lumby and asking to be killed in a duel. Jerks could sneak the "allow running" or what ever button on, get you to 1 hp and run away so a monster killed you, and they could steal your armor. Good times.
---
someone did this with a fan and got banned
---
That is an opinion I whole heartily disagree with :  ^)
---
holy fuck this is good.

Nope its over, youll have to wait for next year

Sex is pretty cool, but have you ever gotten a Runecrafting level?

No seriously, I havent gotten either, how are they really?

Basically you can only kill them all at once if timed right. This is what makes defender more interesting/fun to play (if you play beyond torso/diary), so no one in the BA commununity would want to have this changed.

Yesterday a redditer made a post about OSHD, and based off of the strawpoll in the thread and the discussions of it in the past, it seems like the majority of players would want an HD update. 
---
The last time you responded was ~ 9 months ago when a mod basically said it wasn‚Äôt feasible due to the amount of work required. Time doesn‚Äôt seem like a real concern if the feature is something people want. Since I‚Äôm not a player with a maxed account, I would much rather have this as an update than new pvm content.
---
Here‚Äôs the strawpoll from yesterday: https://www.strawpoll.me/17652905

Right now it seems like most people want but if this gets attention we can get a better picture.

Done all of those things. I guess I was wondering that since they were able to get on my account once, does that mean it's compromised and subsequent hijacks are more likely? I hear about accounts getting hijacked even with the proper security measures taken so I guess that's where my anxiety is stemming from.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Psa that the nose peg still weighs 8KG.

For comparison a DFS weighs 9KG

Exactly the same here, i had to slow way down. Thanks again bro :)

So the sentence should read "top RS3 accounts churn out 6 bonds by doing a specific boss at the peak hardest difficutly without dying even once."

Huh, it's almost like OP made it sound easier than it actually is. I'll stick with solo nex.

You should be good, just make sure u change the pass on ur email too. Best of luck!
---
I know this is only partially serious but after almost 2500 kc at the boss some nights I would lay down and start counting in my head. it actually does take a tool on your psyche.
---
Don't wanna hijack OP's thread or anything but as another new-ish player who just finished up RfD, what are the next big 'account milestone' type things I should be working towards? Almost feels a little aimless without the QP/skill grind for barrows, haha. I know Jad is another big one but my combat stats are all ~63 aside from 78 magic, so I don't feel like I'm close enough to start making attempts? Unless I'm holding off too long and should just jump into it?
---
Sorry, just spilling my mind, but yeah any tips would be sweet :)
---
Make sure once you reinstall you update your passwords for everything because they could have access to all of your accounts.
---
Any idea of where it could have came from? They're designed to be installed without the person knowing so I wouldn't worry if that's the case. The ones they use today are pretty sophisticated 
---
2008scape was the beginning of the downfall era of Runescape. No free trade, no wilderness and ugly ass HD running animations and emotes.

That's what they all say until jmod comes to give us a show. 
---
Wtf, you got some expensive energy drinks or buying gold for extortionate prices?
---
I felt that. Mid 20's got out of a 4 year toxic relationship about a year and a half ago. It's so amazing. Going out with friends again and doing shit that I enjoy without having to think in the back of my mind how much hate/fighting I'm going to get for it. It's not healthy, but it gets sooo much better after breaking up.
---
sonyoure basically follow the updates till we have rs3 and then you will start complaining?
---
Because it ruins the game/economy for everyone else. If 2000 people grab 100 tbows each and sell them on the GE, that's 200,000 tbows added to the game. Just reverting those 2000 accounts wouldn't fix the economy.

I never did the slow running thing, I did however all ways wear a rune 2h and rune large to hide my d long/med
---
Idk, did you read my comment?
---
Zulrah is still good, but Vorkath I'd say is better. If you enjoy Slayer and want more variety, that's good passive income as well. Just do your boss tasks when you can.
---
At 60m, you can get carried through or do really slow raids with friends. Depends on your social situation in game. A 3way dex split would really give you a boost.
---
I used to void duo raids for an hour with a friend just because we enjoyed it, it was far from efficient but we made some money.
---
I thought 70 was the universal threshold.
---
Where have you seen 68 for a 1st?
---
You're ready to leave F2P when you feel you have seen everything F2P has to offer and need more to do. The vast majority of the game is P2P content so it opens up a ton of stuff.

Man, as much as I love OSRS and how much it has improved over RS3 of today... I really do miss some of the quests and aspects of RS2 that I remember haha. Some quests and improvements and updates were so awesome and I sometimes clash the two together... like when I was talking to my friend about slayer and he said he wanted to get slayer rewards so he was going to do Smoking Kills. Well, that quests was post 07 so obvs he never had to do it hahaha.

Idk what Fred Jones is but if there was ever a Fred Jones this is how I'd imagine one would look like

Anyone know anybody that will trade RS3 gold for OSRS gold?  I hate RS3 and picked up OSRS the other day.  You can't transfer gold but people trade in one game and then trade in the other for an exchange rate.  Didn't know how to find people to do that with.

Lynx Titan would be proud.

I‚Äôm messing around with a F2P ultimate Ironman. Grinding out crafting for amulets and trying to use the al Khalid mine for silver, but the scorpions make it impossible. Why is this suggested to be the first thing to do after question with all the scorpions there?

pures can't use fairy rings

A strawpoll that was posted on a thread primarily visited by people that like HD and were discussing it.
---
Obviously numbers are skewed that way.
---
They did just clean everything. 
---
Optimal stats..? Just 99 att,str,def?
---
he can get attacked by 52-53 cb at chins.  pretty sure full iron and dfs at level 1 def is roughly the same defenses that you can get with 10 def and full black armor.
---
Part of the nostalgia of old school runescape is the graphics. It wouldn't really be old school runescape if it had HD graphics? 
---
Why you so salty
---
I got my first whip in my first 100 Abby's, and haven't gotten nother at like 550 now and I don't consider myself dry as I'm about the KC for 1 whip

With reddits mentality comparing a game like world of warcraft which is 15 per month why you complaining??
---
Am I your IT department or something? How am I supposed to know your jobs policy. Use your phone like every other normal person
---
There's grinding for goals and then grinding for things to support the goal.
---
I can spend 5 hours grinding gold so I can buy bones to grind prayer to get piety.  Or I can buy a bond and just grind prayer.  
---
I can grind for gold so I can buy guthans so I can do slayer more efficiently without supply runs.  Or I can just buy a bond and buy Guthans 
---
Post a pic of your adventurer's log.

Extra range distance helps at: Sara GWD, the Ice Demon in raids, and Mystics in raids. It held at shamans in raids a bit too so you can stay on the wall.
---
Now, when I say the range helps, I‚Äôm not saying you should ever use a magic long bow. People take advantage of extra distance on items like Crystal Bow and Twisted Bow
---
Nah you smart
---
Ah, thanks for the info!
---
How can something reinstall itself? It would have to ne another script triggering the install right?

I've ignored the entire quest. Maybe after mort hard and getting some barrows gp.

It is more aerodynamic

He has fucked every type of girl + 10 types you can‚Äôt even imagine 
---
Yes, you answered your own question ;)
---
Also, need to disable the side-panels option in advanced settings in client.
---
Yeah, a straw poll only 5000 people voted on, with only 33% saying they want HD, 53% saying only if it‚Äôs a toggle, and the rest saying they don‚Äôt want it. Hardly definitive. 
---
Why the fuck why I make something like that up?  
---
To go into more detail;  
---
I was constantly paying membership for an account I had completely forgot the details to for about 6 months. It was a mage pure that i did underground pass on and only played for a short time.  
---
Finally got fed up so submitted a ticket. Not sure how they did it, but they gave me a list of all the accounts that I've made, and they even refunded me the 6 months membership via direct debit because they saw I hadn't logged on or played on the account during the 6 months of membership.  
---
I've even been to their headquarters and see how they handle support tickets.

These where like the old days of Osrs when the most complicated update we had was gwd.

They can definitely teleport to Seers and take a boat.

Because 1 atk 1 def 10 hp
---
And when every item had the right-click option of "operate" lol
---
Hey! some of those models look like they were uploaded by me! Glad they turned out alright! I don't take any credit for "creating" the models, that's all on Jagex. I just extract them from the game and convert them into a format suitable for printing!
---
4 in 250 on my btw. :feelsamazingman:
---
x D dude imagine LOL
---
None, he got attention by being one of the only active youtubers that maxed UIM and few days after maxing he made new account for style of play that wasn't oversaturated at the time unlike regular ironman
---
so there is almost 10k people we have to save
---
You don't get my upvote when you treat me like that
---
Good god you‚Äôre a loser 
---
prayer is the cheapest but slow.
---
?? That's like 50 hrs of gameplay. T90 in Rs3 and max is like 500 hrs.
---
Lol, guaranteed I know more about statistics than you do.
---
That's an overreaction. 
---
The point isn't that they'd want to delay pvm, but it wouldn't be a problem if they did because only a few players are deprived from new content. It also shouldn't affect updates that don't involve new visuals.
---
Your problem is that you undervalue how much an HD update would improve the experience.
---
yeah, they still don't say anything
---
I kinda like it better that way!

I get the part about dropping. I just don't see how doing the first step on three clues counts as doing three of one. If it's a three step reward, he'll get a casket after doing the first step of the third clue? Maybe I'm just not familiar with the mechanics of clues.

i didnt know it happened is the problem , when i got hacked i quit instantly because they took my bill , i did not know i was PERM MUTED .... untill yesterday because i wanted to play again ....

no thanks

Glad to hear it! This is the game I grew up with so being able to print my own RuneScape figures is like a dream come true. I'm happy to share that with others. Happy printing!

Got it my first after 790kc reeeeee

Your friend had no choice, as Microsoft never hosted Windows 7 ISOs. You had to BUY a DVD for $120 even if you already had a license and then just NOT use the license it came with. Although, microsoft was very happy to let you accidentally apply the extra license you just bought to the physical machine.
---
IIRC nobody paid for Windows 7, lol. They just download the ISO from wherever and run it without activating or just activate it with Daz Loader.
---
Consumers shouldn't have to pay $120 for Windows if Dell and HP and the like are only charged ~$15. So, consumers self-correct the market and just run it anyways.
---
Sounds like a non biased and very big sample size.

Why are you switches all over your inventory like that.

i randomly found that rune altar inside the magma cave being run by the zamorak followers... Felt like the old days where there wasn't an easy map to tell you where everything is, and you would randomly stumble upon cool shit!   
---
Was very happy when i realized i wouldnt have to run flippin' air runes in order to level up, and/or blow a couple dozen XP lamps to skip those levels. Got to like 15 RC in about half n hour cuz I really enjoyed leveling up super quick(first 5 or 6 were 1 run/lvl) and getting runes higher than my level. 
---
my account was secure it must of been from osbuddy , i heard alot of people got hacked because of osbuddy and runelite 
---
:D
---
nice
---
No it isn't a philosophy what are you saying
---
Shut the fuck up with blaming jagex. You left the game, didn't look around to your account until you wanted to play and got hacked before. Now you are crying because you didn't pay attention to the account, it probably got hacked again and it's perm muted. I get that it happens, that's not your fault but still, it IS your fault for neglecting the account. To blame jagex for muting it, is not their fault. It's your neglecting of the account.
---
i have recoverys obvs . 
---
Lmfao yes thats how it works. Membership is account based, not game based. Using a bond in rs3 makes that account an osrs members too. Theres no need to transfer money from rs3 to osrs then buy bonds. Just buy them in rs3.

I see the problem, it just would seem unjust to me to ban him simply for *not* reaching out to Jagex and continuing to play as he always did. But they already fixed it so whatever.
---
careful not to be mistaken for a kite my dude
---
Looks pretty cool, doesnt look autistically chunky like the rest of the armor options.
---
You know that a Jagex mod sold account information to people, so people got hacked in a manner like this. That's a thing that actually happened.
---
Definitely doable. Consider getting a stylus for switching prayers at jad and watch some guides so you'll know what to expect.
---
This is the guide i used and it was very helpful: 
---
well you're not low lets put it that way.
---
Phoenix gang member can just kill the weaponmaster, pick up the crossbows and trade them to the Black Arm member, so it doesn't really matter.
---
He said 5 year old laptop.
---
If the laptop has an i5 or better from 2014, it will definitely run better than a new flagship in situations that rely on CPU power. You just can't beat something running off wall power, a full block cooler, and an x86 architecture.
---
ARM processors are RISC, which is heavily reduced in performance in exchange for extremly small (cheap) die size, low temperatures, and power usage.

Zero family/social life lol I barely get the time to do a daily farm run

Nowhere in that sentence does Mazzy ever specify that the exp would go to Settled. The comment was poorly worded and I can definitely see how someone might be confused. 
---
If you get to 29 combat they should stop attacking you.  I don't know anything about f2p Ironman but it should be easy enough to grind out some early combat levels.  You can also mine while ignoring them or getting them stuck behind a rock, I used to do that back in like 2005.  Or get an alt to splash on them or something.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
The government DESTROY everything he touch
---
PDVSA, CANTV, CVG (ALCASA, SIDOR, MINERVEN...), Banco de Venezuela... etc...
---
I dont know nothing about that, but I guess if they do, because here people are looking for any way to make money
---
Blame Jagex.  They literally do nothing about it, or are in on it.  I specifically asked a RWTer how the accounts they use to move gold never get flagged.  He said he didn't know and that it had never been an issue
---
HA NOW THIS IS THE QUALITY CONTENT I‚ÄôM AFTER HA
---
Nah. This is a troll. I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd try to lie about this shit but I see your brand new account only used for this post lol.

Runelite is far better and it is free

Runelite is the superior item and free.

It is not against ToS.

6 bonds is 22.56m osrsgp rn. I've read on here that the going rate when selling is around $0.60 per mil, so that would be $13.54 per hour.
---
Lots of quests
---
Are there any major businesses or institutions left that the government did not take over?
---
I do not know what PDVSA, CANTV is, but I am guessing it has to do with power, water, tv, internet, bank, etc.
---
But what about things like grocery stores, clothing stores, other smaller businesses like that?
---
&gt;  Are you lying, or are you actually so dumb you didn't test it yourself?
---
Right back at you fucking idiot, I didn't lie. Now kindly fuck right off, wasted enough time on your dense ass.
---
He is a boss god. For sure.
---
What's wrong with it??  My setup is Slayer helm, BCP, Karils skirt.  I bring a tort, anguish, b ring, and Archer ring switch with my weapons.  If I'm lazy I just bring the tort and a brimstone ring. 
---
This is entirely too accurate to my experience
---
You got this bro stick with it. 
---
I figured but after hitting 99 I would've moved on to slayer or something to get a trident.
---
Yeah I suppose. I‚Äôve only ever done zmi with runners lol
---
I believe that this is not a closely guarded secret.
---
Can you clarify what you mean by that
---
&gt;i get it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I‚Äôm unaware of the full situation but it seems there‚Äôs some people making a lot of money and a lot more suffering because of it.  As it goes.
---
Do you know the story of the daughter of ex-president Hugo Chavez? Maria Gabriela Chavez, when he died she left a fortune of 4,197,000,000 US$
---
Can you believe that this is legitimate money?
---
that's runelite.net
---
I did the DPS calculations before I commented. The glory gives a 1% accuracy bonus over the str ammy. Str ammy gives 1 extra max hit.
---
Verf's UIM is just the same stuff every episode.
---
Bug swarms, Jogres, AFK skill (WC and now fishing).
---
Sure the dedication is impressive, but I feel like he's tried too hard to match Settled with a big "end goal" Inferno VS ToB. But the inferno for him requires so much RNG and entirely relies on super rare implings. Settled needs imps too, but he doesn't lucky implings for anything for example.
---
ToB feels achievable, Inferno just doesn't.
---
I watch and will continue to watch both, but there's a reason why Settled's series is just a tier above everyone else. Well planned (Lol A Friend), enthusiastic and great editing.
---
Imagine hanging an 8 kg mass from your nose
---
As long as it's the blue cape model I'm okay with this 
---
Ah yes that herblore training guide is super useful for jad

because that is how non-invasive bot detection software works, it's not some kind of novel idea
---
I got my 4th zenyte at 3.2k kc. If you beat me I will give you a trophy made of my tears.
---
The lowest hp was ever set was 9
---
There are very rare accounts with 1, this was due to Stat wipes.
---
As far as default skills go. Hp was never below 9
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure about zammy but I think it‚Äôs best to tank with that and protect mage. At Sara it‚Äôs still much better to just range and run laps
---
Do people in VZ support the opposition president or Maduro more? The US declared that it recognizes only the opposition president. Do VZ citizens support this decision, or do some still support Maduro and believe he can fix it?

Clearly an opinion man. I spent a good while in NMZ and didn't have nearly enough points. Again, this is what worked for me. As stated, I understand there's plenty of other and better ways to go about it. I appreciate your input for sure though!
---
What are those boots?
---
I did wines. I knocked I out in about 40ish hours.

is your game more important than the well being of another human bean?

That would still be a lot for rs

not unless that robot arm has millisecond precision.

If everything is still active, the fault is between the keyboard and the chair.

Copied wrong link? Lol
---
you will have a higher max hit with arclight, only problem is tentackle whip has a higher accuracy.  When on a task the helm helps with the lower accuracy.  
---
Wow that's broken

You‚Äôre stupid as fuck. That‚Äôs all that needs to be said here.

Nothing. Runescape and real life aren‚Äôt related. I‚Äôve won this argument and you are an idiot.

Claiming youve won is definitely a bad sign üòÇüòÇ

These are the fashionacape we need not "runes cape"

How is it only 3 clicks per hour of you need to overload every 5 minutes?
---
Does it come with the free crease down the middle? 
---
yes, we can not fight against weapons, it's suicide
---
He instantly kills enemy‚Äôs, and solves puzzles for you. You also get only slayer tomes.
---
Whatever it takes
---
Everyone else grinded without handouts so you should too. What are you going to do when you want to do slayer? Beg for a whip, fury, or DCB? If asking for 5m on this subreddit ever paid off I can ensure you this place would be flooded by requests 
---
I have won but you‚Äôre too dumb to see it. Those cry laugh faces are always evidence that someone has completely lost an argument and still wants to pretend they‚Äôre smarter than the one that‚Äôs won. 
---
Demand goes up as price lowers, it just doesn't outpace supply.

Can you remote from phone to desktop?
---
Better graphics are subjective for the most part. It's like calling someone's art better than another's. I get the point about higher resolution being more attractive to a general audience but I don't believe it would increase my experience, and making it a toggle is fucking stupid.

Borderlands 2

Does your government not allow you to have weapons to defend yourselves?
---
No, their range attack ignores prayer. Pray melee
---
Looks like something a stripper would wear
---
I can't tell if people not taking screenshots and instead taking a photo of the screen is memes or a sad condemnation of the world's education.

Oh wow. I didn't see that one, sorry man :(

What about armed soldiers on your side, or black market weapons being circulated among resistance groups?
---
‚ÄúIf I‚Äôve made a retard made‚Äù 
---
You‚Äôre either too dumb to type right or too mad to proofread. 
---
I‚Äôm no expert on this game but ive been doing barrows a lot recently, The only thing you really need melee for is kc in the tunnel, do Underground Pass to get Ibans staff and use ibans blast on everyone except Ahrim. Bring your best melee armor as the brothers have super low magic defense so you dont need any magic bonus to annihilate them. Bring range gear for Ahrim. 
---
Use prayer for Ahrim, Karil, and Dharok. The rest you can typically get away with not using prayer and prayer is useless on Verac as he can hit through your defense and overheads. Your 45 def might mean you get hit a bit more on the melee brothers but with enough food you should be okay, your ranged and magic is perfectly fine to kill them. I‚Äôd also recommend looking up how kill count works and what percentage you should aim for, but you typically want to aim for 88% for max runes. Also completing Morytania hard diary will give you more runes out of the chest at the end which will increase your profit margin.
---
On that note what happened to the realistic in-game textures?
---
There's no such thing as true randomization. It might take a million "random" clicks for a pattern to formulate, but it always will given a large enough sample size. 
---
Continue to live ur life pathetictly and getting help when help isnt needed. Im sure thatll help you so much

---
Even BDO asked me for some state issued id before they would give me my account back, after forgetting the credentials. I don't understand how a bigger game like OSRS, cba to do the same. Would it make it impossible to have your account hijacked? No, but it would make it much more tedious and (atleast where I live) require them to commit an actual crime to get into the account, which may taper off some people.
---
thank you mano, I'll keep it in mind, although the game runs well, i used OSBuddy btw
---
or you got phished and gave them away
---
Just pointing out the irony and noting an alternative possibility. 
---
That's actually my plan for 6 month abs btw. 
---
I stayed at dragon for 3 months cause I couldn't be arsed to get 175 qp 
---
Although I eventually ground out 250 for slayer blocklists
---
Everything is subjective. How is the toggle stupid if it's made for people like you. If you don't like HD then don't use it. I know a lot of people like myself want it, and that's why I'm creating a discussion for it.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø why make pesky vocabulary get in his way? 
---
Theres no irony, because i didnt make fun of u for misspelling something. I made fun of u for making a reddit post asking randos for a 6m item. 
---
I'm loving the look on that third age plateskirt! It looks unique compared to other skirts just like the platelegs it's not just your run of the mill metallic plateskirt with black and white trimming. I think Mod West did an amazing job with what he had to work with and the greaves really bring this home for me.
---
The interfaces are a bit small if you do this, if you know your way around Android Changing the dpi will hel0
---
Why not just change the "xXCowKillerXx" npc during the ghost ahoy quest o Swampletics? They're wearing the exact same gear (well earlier in season 2 they were with the dh helm and mineral armor).
---
You don't need to kill if you want attack xp. Maybe he pummeled other miners near death, let them regenerate slowly back up and then proceeded to beat them again.
---
it's hard to understand, but basically they control everything, the government, the black market, the thugs, the guards, everything, we only have the courage and the civilian people on our side
---
Do you get nmZ points with this method ?
---
You‚Äôre too stupid to see the irony. I‚Äôm done talking to you. 
---
Still good for pures, 75 att but trains str.
---
Yeah, I have a nmz macro so I can do obby for the entire 6 hours before force log, and I just have the click intervals between about 15 seconds and 59 seconds. Been using for prob a total of 50 hours at least, no ban.

sorry, they're zero time *now*, flipping just happens in the background yano

I sincerely have a propose to make you, I'm half Venezuelan, my family moved out of it last summer and I know how difficult and fucked up things are over there, since Maduro turned president he can't stop destroying the country and I know how hard life is in there.

---
magics are most afk
---
P sure ppl use noted items during super heating cause it's quicker to talk to the banker and un-note them in your inventory than it is to open bank and withdrawal them
---
There's not really a point in enhancing. You're paying 5m just to increase the max charges from 2500 to 20k which is completely unnecessary because you're rarely if ever in a situation where you need that many casts where you're also unable to go to the bank / GE and resupply.  
---
Upgrading to swamp is definitely better than upgrading to seas. As for which is "better" they're both very close in effectiveness so imo it comes down to preference.
---
The swamp does cost more per cast but does more damage on average and you get the venom effect so it's the same reason behind upgrading from Iban's to the regular trident - more DPS = faster runs = more money, even if it costs more to use.
---
Personally I found the swamp to be slightly better but try them both out. If you feel like you aren't noticing a difference you can always detach the magic fang and keep it as a regular trident.

Hey /u/freethenude -- what is the method that you guys use to receive money? Is it mainly through PayPal?
---
Goverment has everything in there. They even give supplies to most stores so it's all the same iirc
---
It's a fucked up situation. 
---
It's best in slot in a lot places, just not in the ones most end-game players care about, such as raids or vorkath.
---
It is still the best in slot weapon for general Slayer and training. It's just not 160+m worth better.
---
2 hours? doing what? 
---
I'm just now coming back to the game after like 13 years so i don't know much about the prices of stuff anymore.

Write your own personal script and don't bot constantly for a stupid amount of time

I still don't understand how after all the bullshit that venezuela has gone through, people can still support maduro. It's fucking insane to me (speaking outside of the elite)
---

---
They didn't hide the results of that poll though.
---
Zulrah's average drop is a little over 100k. When you add in value from average unique rates it's around 145k/kill. Zulrah drops are fine. 
---
try playing by the rules next time
---
600kc 100-600% streaks still trying to finish my first orb set :( 
---
I'd like to see sighted longbows from RS2 or whatever added in some tasteful way
---
Heyyy I definitely feel that. With a few adjustments, you can swing the camera around and set the inventory right on top of the bank. Another reason why I come here haha.
