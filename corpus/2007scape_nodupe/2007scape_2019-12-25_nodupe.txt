I did the same thing in 2007 with a black cav worth 1.1m. I picked flax for hours to get the black cav :(

on the same one under that one should be the program i use to get internet from my android to phone it uses a proxy thing i think
---
You can install Android on an exploitable model switch, and install OSRS mobile
---
You can only buy 15 herb boxes a day. So have some points buy your 15 and then go do vorkath.
---
Bots are the runescape equivelant of illegal immigrants :/
---
Lame, that was a good enough reason to ask for upvotes. Repeating my message from last post that I‚Äôll definitely buy one even if I don‚Äôt win :)
---
70 aint even half of 90 /s
---
If they exaggerate, then the numbers literally do lie..
---
Depends how much I play
---
Botting is wrong for sure, but in my opinion its gotten to the point now where weve had so many bots for such a long time its made the economy what it is. Lets say hypothetically here that we just get rid of all bots permanently all of a sudden, the servers come back up and there are now no more bots and never will be. Every resource, every item that had huge bot farms collecting it is now shooting up in price because the demand is still high from the regular players wanting to buy that item and the supply is low because bots arent collecting and selling it anymore. This would also mean actual players would have to go farm things now. On a members world and want lobsters for something? Too bad no bots or players are catching lobs. 
---
Take a look at the bot nuke day that happened years ago, entire places that were absolutely freaking PACKED with players suddenly had maybe 1 or 2 players there tops. Entire places turned into ghost towns because of the bot nuke. Dont know if this is because there were just so many bots in that one spot, or maybe Jagex was just sloppy or lazy around that time and they built up. The point is bots do have their place in the current game, and if we removed them entirely it would pose a whole new set of mostly unforeseen changes to the games economy.
---
You can only buy 15 boxes/day so, 1 hour will last like 10 days of buying boxes.
---
Sick
---
yeah sure you can tank every single monster in the hardest wave for 30 seconds in armadyl
---
My favorite is going to the desert bandit camp with a blessing on and having permanent aggro with a person to unnote food in the camp (they barely ever hit though). And you can easily line them up to have only one hitting you. 
---
You can go here with Guthans and literally AFK to a 6 hour log. 
---
Only rivaled by Nightmare zone for AFK combat imo
---
Good luck all these are so cool
---
Yes fossils
---
Pintastic
---
I would not complete the clue scroll as I have 27 Runecraft btw.
---
Yes but my question is: Instead of taking the time to do NMZ to get the points, wouldn't it be more efficient to just farm vorkath instead?
---
Great work dude keep it up!
---
I would love one! The voider in the bottom left is goals
---
Welcome. I left bdo for osrs last year. The clan fights on here give me my bdo node war fix.

There are a lot of toxic neckbearded assholes one runescape. There are also lots of amazing people who are kind and helpful. Dont let the dickheads make you forget about the good guys.

I‚Äôm 2094 total but 69 runecrafting exclusively through easy/med/hard diary lamps, ToG, and random events. Everything else 80-85+. I tried doing RC legit once. I lasted 12 minutes.
---
I did some calculations and vork is about 1.8m/hr with bp, zulrah is about 2m/hr assuming u hit uniques. so If I'm looking to get a bcp, it should be around 10 hours of zulrah. is it really that bad to farm bandos in non-max setups ?
---
I guess it depends on how much slower it makes things really. Because like if you can get a ‚Äúnear‚Äù max setup for 200M and you‚Äôre only like 2-3 minutes/run slower than max gear but you‚Äôre still 1-2 minutes faster than Prayer gear id still opt for faster kills and more incoming damage/supplies used than slower kills and less used. Idk there‚Äôs really too many hypotheticals to say what would be worth doing and what wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not entirely against your proposal it‚Äôs just one of those things you wouldn‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôd be relevant till setups are fleshed out.

Mmm when you right click the wreath, there's an option to "check rank" and then the dialogue appears that shows the rank. I'd like to think that it's still somehow  doable. You can buy it from diego for like 100gp  I think. The tree hugging actions though could me members only though, idunno, i'm f2p. IF you're a member could you check it out from me? You can buy one from diego in Draynor.
---
Drop party in real life . nice
---
yeah but then you get into issues where items like the twisted bow or even full armadyl / bandos are inaccessible to the average noob.
---
it‚Äôs hard to make a lot of money in the game if you don‚Äôt know how to even start
---
I agree with him, fuck grinding and saving to buy a fury, might as well just pay for a bond and get one
---
Not to discredit PKing but I don't think it's very fun to kill people who don't fight back for minimal loot.
---
:) HP one is best one
---
Just "i7" doesn't mean much, which one is it? If it's before 6th gen(i7-6XXX)  it's probably pretty bad
---
I teach people how to flip, written guides for it and been really successful :)

Do i need 42 def to wear the void pin?

Probably just an alt

Since funorb is no longer a thing, does anyone know of any good arcanists varients?

Whomever created these master clue steps should fuck themselves over

Did you log out you have to before you can switch to a members world
---
They exaggerate because they assume everyone else is retarded. It's a pretty common behavior with narcissists. 
---
If you just run the numbers on what their botfarms are making, you'll see it's an insane amount of money. If you're not able to, SirPugger usually does this in his videos.
---
I redact my comment on your post last night. My new comment is...
---
‚ÄúI found a funny meme format. Im going to keep reposting the exact same format over r/2007scape and r/memes with only slight variations on the text. I‚Äôll be raking in that karma!‚Äù

Hi I would like a pin. Thank you üôèüèº. You‚Äôre very generous

Let me get one of those pin entry spots

I'd like to have one, but I'm an ironman so a trade isn't possible. Is this considered as a drop?

Definitely looks like a deep fake to fuck with ROT.   They‚Äôd never waste Chris‚Äô time with something that isn‚Äôt open and shut and without very strong evidence.  Someone obviously spied a bit and overheard this conversation.  Not surprising these type of PVP clans do this kind of shit to each other.   This is them in their Christmas spirit I guess.  
---
Still kind of disgusting but at least most of the dudes in the chat sound uncomfortable talking about an underage girls‚Äô nude pics.
---
Comment. Comment? Comment =].
---
[removed]
---
Ive also been conflicted on this. Its an easy 200k a day but it still takes out a good chunk of time to get that 200k points, and you only get fast points with the DT bosses (which we all know is shit to deal with).
---
I actually stopped doing my daily NMZ runs out of pure laziness. I spend that time bossing and stuff, overall ive made more. That doesnt mean its not worth it to do your NMZ, it totally is. But if you hate NMZ like I do then yah
---
How did you make them?
---
If the only reason you‚Äôre playing a game type is because of the rewards that‚Äôs not an excuse to give unfair rewards.  
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with cosmetics, but if someone did then saying ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm I wouldn‚Äôt play this game type otherwise‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid response.  
---
Neither of you have given any reasons against the original opinion.

Does that catch you up to speed?

Not the place

Yes but you‚Äôll be level 8 by the time you finish... They also gain levels during it through combat, which is why they count it at level 8.
---
Oof I‚Äôm sorry my friend. Reddit luck blesses your next kill.

Doesnt tog level your lowest skill like his combat stats?

Very cool rudy

Hey bro join L0st Dynasty cc I‚Äôm one of the owners! Medium sized clan of mains and irons all high leveled at the moment but we are looking for everyone who wants to just be part of a fun group who wants to make each other better so one day we can have a stronger clan. We do everything content wise you can think of daily and there‚Äôs always people to hang out with even if it‚Äôs just shooting shit in the cc. Lmk bro we‚Äôd love to have a new friend! IGN: TTTankey

He found a way to do it with 37 vs 43 prayer that included a new way to tick eat rangers, so no he didn‚Äôt just copy Rendi.
---
rip? lmao
---
Epic

forgot to mention how you guys had the worst year in terms of actual updates and getting prizes out to contest winners
---
I got this on like my first master clue on the last step, it was heartbreaking
---
These are sick, lets gooooo
---
The OP of the thread literally asked why people shit on bondies. 
---
Yes I do think they care lmao

Just cut wrist is more like it...

Lol this guy doesn't know the shortcut

Lemme get that law rune

I want a nature or law rune! They are awesome pins!
---
Why is fishing out of 121 but the others 126
---
I got back into the game when they dropped mobile. While standing at the GE i had some madlad give me gp for a bond, tells me to hop members, and trades me 40m worth of gear, whip dcb and all that plus some extra cash. Then he just logs the fuck out. I still dont understand.
---
Xact does lots of pvm in general, iirc he had the first solo scythe from ToB. Rendi was donated like 150m for his last vid.
---
Have already but thanks. Just started today with tut gona try the others why not kinda interesting
---
That‚Äôs so dope man!
---
93 combat you can still attack Max pures in pvp world's if that's your thing.
---
To enter DKS solo you need a pet rock to put on the weighted platform to enter.
---
Are the devs planning on ever releasing / finishing the questlines that is available in RS3? For example Elemental Workshops 3&amp;4, Desert Questlines, Guthix dying / return of the Gods etc.
---
Or is there plan mainly to branch off and do OSRS exclusive questlines and content as seen in Kourend and possibly in the next Morytania update?
---
Don't mind if I do. Merry Christmas.
---
Merry Christmas! Hope I win!
---
Hell I remember when they were steady 10m
---
do you have a mole pin? These are dope!
---
If you can‚Äôt understand on your own how it being guaranteed after a certain Kc devalues it, then nothing I‚Äôm able to explain is going to get through to your dumb ass lmao I get that you really want it, but your opinion on this matter is an abysmally small minority.
---
Nice
---
Its the exact amount of botted playing time= same number of lamps never missed by said bot=65 slayer
---
&gt;who hurt you 
---
Reddit moment
---
I used to afk at fire giants with Dharok‚Äôs. The smoke brings you down to 1 Hp, but won‚Äôt kill you. Protect melee and you can stay as long as your prayer pots last. Luckily I never got chicken‚Äôd doing that.
---
Nice polygon rat man.

This man must be related to Jebrim.

I got my first 56m from a drop party in rs3 back in the day.

the pole dancer one is hilarious

Damn

Oh fuck.  This one's good.

These are so cool! May I ask how you made them?

Not how it works, senate has to impeach as well

Why fletch?

I'd love one :)

Yeah idk what the other guy is even saying. Devious has 75k subs, there's no way he's bankrolling off of his YouTube alone.
---
How relaxing is your carpal tunnel?
---
Have you seen some of the deepfakes they have now?  Some of the video and voice ones are insane.   I guess paying a celebrity is still easier but there will be a day we can‚Äôt trust anything like this.

Could we get an update on League point cutoffs soon?  I think the last we got was in early December.

omgggg!!!! Pelosi is obstructing the Senate from their constitutional duty, impeach her!!!

They‚Äôre the backbone of the economy? Well said

And Merry Christmas to you! Thank you
---
I know what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs the same thing everyone else has been saying for the most part. I‚Äôm just pointing out where you contradicted yourself and why anyone felt the need to correct your first statement.
---
He seems to think more feet=more betta
---
Do you stand in the center so 4 attack you at thw same time? I usually stand in a corner when afk or when I play semi actively I make them stand in a line. Well my question is, is it not better to have a little as possible attacking you at once so your absorption lasts longer?
---
You seem pretty defensive towards the idea of buying bonds for someone who has never bought a bond. And yeah, turns out when you don‚Äôt funnel all your money into your hobby just to not play it you end up having more money relatively.
---
You‚Äôre cringe

Congrata you won one

Dm me your shipping address :D

It's against reddit rules for naming other people, and then secondly to accuse others of wrong doing. The sad thing is if the thread gets deleted they're gonna blame the mods for censoring or something like that.
---
I do not know the context of this, nore do I want to. The only thing this thread is going to do is incite others to be spiteful regardless of who is right or wrong here.
---
It's leaving it up to a Reddit lynch mob to decide if people are right or wrong, which is my opinion is the very last thing on my mind when I think of Justice.
---
Haha.  No problem. 
---
And thank you!
---
I would love one! They look great!
---
Don't need to send one, just wanted to let you know these are awesome and thanks for spreading cheer.
---
Great job! But you made one mistake. You leaked your item! All your profits will be mine!!!!
---
Dude we are talking about as an option for the new boss if prayer bonus reduced damage
---
And how elite void is could be a good mix of prayer bonus and damage in this situation
---
You know how the comments on a post are relate to the post topic?
---
Looks awesome
---
I just want to confirm if Varrock armor is just the plate. On the wiki there's a full suit of armor and I'm confused. I just have to wear the plate to get the 10% chance at double ores right?
---
Thx man
---
:o!
---
The hit points cape would actually be wearable in public especially if it was a design rather than just the hit points symbol in the center
---
No, that's a removal vote. The impeachment already went through. They are separate.
---
All this stuff you could‚Äôve had for Christmas and you got salty
---
Nice work DVS, you‚Äôre a man dedicated to the grind!
---
i understand that OG RS players didn't care for it (I quit around the start of EOC too after giving it a try) but they still had a dedicated playerbase is the thing. I have friends who played from RS2 into RS3 and still try to play a bit to this day.
---
The issue is that the MTX eventually began to just completely dominate the game to the point where it felt like a crap mobile game.
---
Definitely one of a kind. Nice!
---
Oh I want :o
---
You do know there's a difference between prayer flicking and 1-tick flicking, right? 1-tick flicking is flicking your quick-prayers on and off every game tick so you don't use any prayer points. There's a difference between skillfully flicking different monsters and mindlessly spamming a button to trade carpal tunnel syndrome for prayer points instead of managing resources.
---
What?
---
Thank you ‚ù§
---
It's aids no matter how you slice it xD. Way too effing slow
---
comments are in like with what id expect from a political discussion on a video game sub
---
This doesn't sound like mining.
---
Nothing has changed to their table as far as I know. Speed helps with rate of obtaining herbs though.
---
Lol, 420, its HIGH NOON get it? Ok ill leave now
---
What about a reply to the reply of the first comment
---
Would be down for one. Very cool
---
it's not that it barely passed. it's that the polls were intentionally designed to get the answer that the main devs at the time wanted. 
---
iirc, there were asking how people who tested it felt about it and if they did not answer with a definitive "i did not like it," the "i feel uncertain/mixed emotions" were counted as positive.
---
Back to the vorkath grind
---
Looks good girl! Glad you finally got it done and like it! This subreddit is toxic so fuck em. You know you got the clan to back you!
---
I loved episode one. Can‚Äôt wait to watch 2 after the Xmas party
---
Omg, these are amazing. Been playing since classic and I love seeing RuneScape stuff coming to real life.
---
Did you do steel ingots or addy?  Did you boost with spicy stew?
---
That love one is absolutely adorable.
---
Did u lol irl
---
When u saw this ?
---
i have a huge pin collection from shows and festivals, would love to add some osrs to my collection! :) merry christmas friend
---
Yea I train rc thru the abyss I only just got level 41 lmao (1725 total tho and 92 slay) I agree not everyone is going to like every part of the game but when you look at the number of players with 99 it‚Äôs like 17k people with 99 agility and 16k with 99 RC(8k of those are maxxed) but 45k people have 99 slay. Idk just think it demonstrates how  those skills need a bit of a rework as they seem universally disliked.
---
Would be nice if agility was even useful past like level 80. I only have 65 and I can do most short cuts with a summer pie boost and will probably not bother with it much past 70-75 maximum. With stamina pots and house pool I am never walking anyway.
---
Original source?
---
Moreso visibly confused.
---
FR hes so cute, he aint done nothing wrong
---
Pick me m'lord!
---
Ah thank you!
---
Stop or Im telling
---
I would love one, but even better is if you'd teach me how to make these!
---
I suppose it's fair game, there'll be something else to make money on ;)
---
Ok im done.
---
I didnt conradict myself. 
---
Im truley just over this thread.
---
It was a kangaroo court anyway. It sets a terrible precedent that will be abused for years to come. Hearsay is not grounds for impeachment. It doesn‚Äôt matter which side you‚Äôre on, this ‚Äúimpeachment‚Äù is detrimental to the political system and will only divide the country further.
---
I love that these worlds still exist

Check out his maxing a uim series. He's maxed a normal ironman and a hardcore ironman, and he's trying to become the first person to max all 3 ironman modes.

Thanks for the post.

I want one please!

Plz don't tell! D:

Props. I did 82-99 at astrals back when they were better profit. Helped me fund pretty much every other 99 in the account. I might grind out wraths now for the pet.

i'll take the easiest option possible. am i right in assuming that msb -&gt; darkbow is harder to fuck up than msb -&gt; gmaul? and in that case would i need a crossbow incase the spec doesn't KO?

OP is the one that created the market for ZMI runners. He created the discord it launched out of so he could get runners.

All this time I have felt so alone! It's a relief to know I am part of a community!
---
How does this work btw? Just RC like normal akd ignorew everyone else?
---
All seriousness I spent a decent chunk of time doing Astrals myself, though at the time I did it Nats were better money so from 92-99 I did a lot of Nats and even more Lavas because I wanted the big boi xps.
---
Pick me pls

The runecrafting one probably takes 15 years to make

Those are some neat pins.

These look so cool! Are they on etsy or something?

Is it possible to have more than one account on one email address, I read something about adding +1 to the end of the email, is it legit and do you sign in with name+1@email.com? Or name@email.com? Thanks

Cool pins I'm in!
---
Good luck!
---
My first 1 month break from the game was at this point in the tutorial

Well it was almost a heart warming post lol

Thanks for saying the truth bro it will probably get buried but good looks and respect

That blood rune though &lt;3
---
Eh, no, it kinda looks like shit and people are voicing it. That happens when you post on social media. It‚Äôs different, not pretty.

Same with abyssal sire and grotesque guardians
---
Well, higher levels mean higher exp rates and rewards.

Not too long ago there were hundreds of bots buying steel axes in the ge. I could tell because sometimes they would accidentally type it into chat instead of the search bar. Will never know the reason why though

I feel like this post is going to jinx.  My first step on a master was kill a nech,  so I went from 70-80 agility so I could stop skipping tasks, then 72 slayer to 80,  now I need to catch 10k monkfish before I can do my next step.  This shit is pain.  Never ever will I allow myself to set a goal of opening 1000 eclectics.

Click on the crossed swords near your inventory. You will see 3 or 4 boxes. Click on the box in left top left and gain some attack xp when you fight. Can get you a picture if you need more info
---
This is not a cutenoob. Thinking you don't know what that means
---
&gt;I know a clue is a small reason for a fair bit of work
---
I disagree! I get burned out on RS often, especially when I spend 20+ hours grinding on my days off from work, and master/elite clue requirements motivate me to skill outside of my current goal, and hard clues motivate me to quest for music requirements.
---
I think clues are exceptionally amazing for breaking up certain grinds to help progress your account in skills/achievements you aren't necessarily focused on
---
No that‚Äôs fine Thanks for the help!
---
I was literally thinking that to myself last night.
---
At some point society as a whole will shift into taking everything with a grain of salt.

Maybe I just have high hopes though.

heres an example of mith bars.

it's normal to not hit the max rates, max rates require you to be pretty tick perfect with banking and movement and thus take practice and things like screen markers.
---
I mean yeah I see what you mean but it‚Äôs still almost a 10th of the experience required. Hardly virtually nothing.
---
Wow I am learning this today as well, thank you Reddit.

if his cb stats are his lowest slayer wouldn't get the exp.

Pvp in any game gets edgy and toxic. 'ez'
---
Good on you OP. I rarely play anymore, so please don‚Äôt put me in the drawing, but I wanted to give my props.
---
That‚Äôs remarkable, is the goal 200m rc or just 10m deaths for novelty?
---
Eh, it kinda looks like i got a tattoo i love and yall are dickheads but thats alright with me! Its christmas season, everyone sucks.
---
I think the only people who buy low-mid tier gear are the new accounts who are grinding through it so they overpay. People who sell this gear are the same players who have now surpassed their old gear.
---
That means there's a high buy price but a low sell price - perfect for a cheeky flip.
---
Here's a conspiracy theory for ya - maybe one group of bots bots bought the steel axes up so that XP farming bots paid more for their steel axes when moving through them ü§î

Most likely yes at discounted rates to gold selling sites who serve as the middle man.

Not sure if this is a troll post, but I will answer this seriously. If you go to your attack style menu (the two swords crossed‚Äîno pun intended) you‚Äôll see‚Äîdepending on the weapon‚Äîattack styles. Select the ‚Äústab‚Äù option or the first button you see on the left of the panel. That will level up your attack.
---
none of those upgrades really make a significant difference. a few points of defense will not make or break your cape at all.
---
given you have an acb i'd consider a dragonfire ward for zuk. 
---
ancestral = faster waves if you need to heal on mager/freeze meleer, though neither are ideal things to do.
---
justicar is a minor bis over veracs.
---
arma is a minor bis over god dhide- if you arent taking a bcp for example, acp and acs would be higher priority since more defense for mage+range waves onwards when you barrage the nibblers at the start.
---
Boss too small for scythe

lol bro you dont get paid in salt? get with it

Only takes 3 years to get 77

10m Deaths for novelty, 200m RC is the final goal.

You are a kind person, thank you for doing this for the community &lt;3

Lamps, my dude. You can choose.

All the characters are so amazing ahhüò≠
---
Is this possible without the quest? I thought you needed the quest to start the skill.
---
No reason to post political BS on this sub. Go to r/politics if you want karma.
---
Yes please!
---
not with ToG which is what I thought we were talking about, if not my bad.
---
like honestly my lowest stat in the day was mage or ranged mostly due to needing ammo.
---
Getting 77 is like 24-30 hours ish of runecrafting, fun times
---
These are great! I love how you tied some of them to other pop culture references!! Thanks for sharing
---
it‚Äôs the same picture
---
F
---
Will I win? Who knows
---
Imo Zuni is profitable and far more profitable, the run takes 3 clicks to the altar
---
No because you need to swap ammo 
---
With the maul you need to swap prays but if you don‚Äôt the combo still works and it‚Äôs harder to pray against because it‚Äôs two combat styles. 
---
Knives to gmaul or knives to rcb to gmaul is your best bet.
---
Jokes on you, I upvoted you.
---
You literally only gotta start it which is the boat ride then you can use it
---
Lol now they want another impeachment because they didnt do their job, lol using impeachment to further partisan gain. Not like this is bad president or anything. Gonna be funny when Democrats lose the house a trump has a rep majority for his second term with politicians he likes and no RHINOs like Paul Ryan. And two more surpreme court picks for trump and another 100 federal judges. Left will self immolate.

The 126  in the 99/126 means he has achieved 200m XP in the skill which is the maximum XP a player is able to gain in a skill. Aka he has 200m all for the most part besides combat obviously.
---
Do you think taking a bcp would be helpful to learn at first? From my understanding, it's used to tank at the start of waves while barraging nibblers--is that correct?
---
Well I didn‚Äôt win the first time hopefully I will this time.
---
if you cant afford piety, you cant afford to pk
---
They are essential for people to continue playing the way the do.  So yes they are the backbone.
---
The comment you replied to said this 
---
&gt;pretty sure **LAMPS** would go on slayer 
---
Merry Xmas
---
The mechanics are enjoyable but it gets exhausting after a while
---
i would definitely take a bcp yeah.
---
I usually get one or two. I got to many boots now.
---
Hola
---
Just from reading that comment I‚Äôm going to randomly remember you once in a while for a long time now
---
amazing pins mate
---
I remember the last post you made, this is really awesome of you to do. Hope my rng is good!
---
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two picture
---
I bet you googled "bad tattoo" and posted it here for the drama :oo
---
Would love to have one of these awesome pins! :D
---
So rather than taking an ahrim's top switch, that would be replaced by the bcp? Sorry for all the questions, I appreciate the help
---
Np happy holidays
---
Bro I love you
---
How would i find something so specific as the runescape rat under a simple "bad tattoo" search to rile up a bunch of incels
---
LOL
---
I mean I guess? Its considerably slower than iron mining though.
---
Why not get dragon arrows?
---
Max slayer but thx for the tip
---
You boys got the right idea. It‚Äôs clearly bullshit.
---
How close are you to mory elites? Dks is probably my favorite content to do when I want to chill and that made them 1000x better
---
The accuracy in that statement is staggering
---
Chaos runes :(
---
It wasnt even posted yet haha
---
Random comment from someone in the comments
---
&lt;3 merry christmas
---
Lol well said, well said
---
bringing the bcp in addition to your ahrims top and bottom (or just ahrims top)
---
either its an easy wave = not really any threat, you start in double ahrims- or it's a hard wave = you start in bcp + arma skirt/bless dhide chaps.
---
bcp+ahrims skirt is kinda a meme, youd get somewhat similar defense just starting in double arma.
---
STOP DOING THIS
---
OH MY GOD! You cant just go and ask that! Manners please.
---
theres a formula to calculate the xp that you reach levels at. runescape allows you to collect xp past 99 but not levels, so he has the xp to be a level 126 (about 190m xp i think), even if runescape doesnt have levels that high, so people call them "virtual levels." if you download runelite then it can show you your virtual levels
---
Some do
---
The rune pins are sharp
---
I'll take a pin, if ones available still !
---
I was using amethyst for practice so I wouldn‚Äôt sink a lot into the attempts.. now I‚Äôm almost to jads lol
---
Thanks for all the help, bud. Again, I appreciate it. 
---
Merry Christmas, hope you have a good one!
---
I read this and thought you meant your Runescape main was somehow deleted! 
---
Whew...lol

just another inaccurate opinion

Funny cause I had this thought not long ago.

For the longest time I didn't know that TL's could note your crop yields, so I used to route my farm runs all around banking. I couldn't believe how e-z scape it was after realizing they could just note my herbs/etc and I didn't have to keep running to banks lmao.

I would be honoured if I do cross your mind once in a while. :)

Yea I did fairly inefficient lavas to 77 and got around 60k/hr most of the time. It's high effort but it feels so much more efficient
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like

Am I too late to this party?
---
Pleasee!!! :D
---
Good. :)
---
Wait this isn't youtube...
---
Ayyy I got my fletch cape around this time last year. Enjoy it my friend, was a great feeling to finally get!
---
I disagree. I knew 92 was halfway to 99, but had no idea that every 7 levels is double the current XP.
---
Ancient staff one is so nice I wannnnnnt it
---
His knees must be dead
---
Poggers
---
Hopefully they at least rebalance things like lunar armor to actually have a purpose. Currently the 65 magic 40 defence gear is worse than mystics (40 magic 20 def) for basically everything and has worse negative attack bonuses than ancestral. We need a non rare magic set between mystic and ahrims, just looks dumb when a 20 def pure has the same mage bonus as a max main in pvp just because the max main doesn't want to risk 4m for 1 attack style.
---
Well I never turn down a RNGjesus opportunity.

Thank you all for your hard work to keep the game running.

alright that makes sense, ty.

I think one of the biggest problems with listening to ingame music is actually the music player.
---
One of the things that I miss when I want to listen to ingame music is being able to make a playlist of favourite songs or to just set it to random.
---
Without those things you are either going to listen to only a fraction of the music, when its set to auto, or you are going to have to choose every song manually, which means that its better to just listen to a playlist on YouTube or Spotify.
---
and me
---
hcim btw
---
I also found out that if you pee in toilet at the right angle it sound like runecrafting

Good work!!!

I mean, there's no reason you *can't*

These are all super cool! You did a nice job with these OP!

thank you very much, if you want i can give you the role "super helper" on my discord, this is reserved for people like yourself, helpful warriors.
---
Those are sick take my updoot
---
But is it cheating? 
---
I also play WoW and I don‚Äôt enjoy a majority of early game content (Vanilla-MoP) just because I‚Äôve played it so many times. But I sure as fuck am not paying $60 to ‚Äúskip parts of the game I don‚Äôt find enjoyable‚Äù. But if I did pay $60 did I cheat? 
---
Same thing if Jagex offered an option to Buy XP is it cheating? No they did it on RS3
---
Oh damn am I too late for this?? They‚Äôre good looking pins
---
Probably stupid question but do you do the abyss? I don‚Äôt mind runecrafting generally but the abyss for whatever reason just stresses me out. Between managing run energy, trying to quickly find either the thieving or mining thing and not take a ton of damage, using glories to tele out and having to worry about remaining charges, eating occasionally between trips, watching for pkers etc. The skill itself is fine and I like Ourania and I would like the abyss if it wasn‚Äôt for all that. But man for whatever reason it just gives me anxiety.
---
Let's be honest. The scope of jagex's mechanics doesn't extend much further than counting to 3 lmao
---
easy to differ the colours to 1 set up mage,melee etc
---
If you'd ship to New Zealand I'd love one, otherwise good luck to the other folk!

I'm hoPINg I'll get picked for one. Good luck guys!

Sick work as always
---
Omg I've always wanted one haha
---
You could still boost with 3+ accounts. 1 is the killer which maintains its streak, the other two alternate kills on each other to maintain 1 k/d on at least one of the accounts. Yes it makes it more inefficient but it is still possible, and very easy with multiple accounts.
---
And the scoreboard is cool but you can already tell who is a booster and look up their bh highscores as it is. And I doubt many pkers would actually look at their stats or who they killed.
---
take a breath if you need help
---
atleast it wasn‚Äôt an experiment eh
---
These are so freaking cool
---
Happy holidays to you too üòÅ

I would like one

This is sick! Good luck with the grind my brother

Hope I win one :)

I got one from your store a couple years ago and lost it recently, would love to get another

Lol i made iron base on the first day ironman came out. Typical sped main account mad they need 6 people to solo bandos and maybe youll get the kill sometimes, but sadly bobbywip comes in and absolutely smacks bandos sniping your pet from you, so you seek revenge to this day on all ironmen so you can one day not be a broke ass main with no tbow
---
I‚Äôd love one of these
---
Rune knives out dps max melee gear lmao
---
We don't deserve this kindness, but I also won't decline it.  That's talent, man.
---
I‚Äôd say the 2x xp from lavas more than makes up for it. Especially since 77-99 at bloods is going to be IMMENSE profit that will make the 50-77 at ZMI look like peanut
---
If I don't win I'll just buy one anywho :)
---
Gimme pls
---
That's what I'm saying.. the house approved the vote on two counts...
---
Well knowing my odds, it's 50/50. I get it, or I don't.
---
I do use the Abyss, and it's not a stupid question. I can understand how it would be stressful when compared to the Ourania Altar, as like you've said there is quite a lot that you have to be paying attention to. For the most part my experience with the Abyss using the total level worlds (primarily 1500+) is that the PKers generally don't bother, and even when they do manage to catch me, the value of lost items is negligable compared to the value of runes I am creating. At most it's a slight annoyance and a bit of time wasted. That being said I can't speak much for any of the other worlds, so milage may vary. As for managing the glories, if you use a Dueling Ring it can be a quick fix to forgetting to swap to a fresh one, though I suppose there comes a point when you could reasonably forget both. After some practise a lot of this stuff becomes second nature to an extent though.
---
I hope my reply may be helpful to you in some way.
---
It does not. So spam click away while that guy is splashing.

with the ease of gp coming into the game they will increase on avg year by year

There is "virtual" levels past 99 following the same XP structure as 1-99. 126 is just before 200m XP. From memory 120 is about 104m XP.
---
200m XP is the most you can get in a skill. So this skiller is mining and fishing away from being a 200m maxed skiller.
---
This is true.
---
Some people just wanna be a scary ice wizard, no judgement from me
---
Oh for 200 mil sure. But for this dude, 61-70 is definitely an iron situation
---
Good work my bro
---
Ah. I didnt know osrs had virtual levels
---
Sketchyyy
---
For anybody wondering, you just right click the tab and there's an option to mute it.
---
Finally a clue I can do
---
T
---
Ok then why would you feel the need to say ehp players are neets? Were you bringing this up to congratulate them or something? Because how you said it is usually a negative thing
---
Yeah, you're right. This game is ran by a 25% minority filled with keyboard warrior neckbeard police force that immediately puts a stop to any update that would devalue any of their accomplishments whatsoever, most likely because their actual lives are a complete failure and their max capes aka good boy capes are the only thing they have left. All while shitting on the mods and others in the community because their anonymity grants them the permanent ability to do so and just because they pay their $11 every month they think they can scream and bitch like the man-children they are every time some minor inconvenience befalls them in the game.
---
70% would be wayyyyyy to op. Bursting to 99 magic would essentially cost nothing at that point, and still be only 10% slower to save millions.
---
I think I will be around 60m XP, give or take a bit.
---
I'm not even that big of a R&amp;M fan, but that one is ridiculously well done.
---
Just wish we could get mouse compatibility for mobile :( would be so for when I take my iPad to work.
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Thank you. :)
---
No, only dks or 1/10000 at wintertodt
---
Phizo?
---
Runecrafting is also my favorite skill. It's so chill, you can easily watch shows/movies during it. The anti-runecraft circlejerk here is ridiculous.
---
as a pker i may kill a few bone bois for shits and grins but then I will find one that's a good sport about it, and I'll offer to just protect them while they train, they tend to appreciate it, and I get someone to talk to in the dead ass wildy. I only pk at the altar because it's easy to escape teams usually.
---
I totally agree with you, but with my particular income I felt completely fine with taking the safe route. This also helps feed Mod Ash.
---
No way, unavoidable poison tree hits 10s. Wouldn‚Äôt be a practical method of collecting them on a skiller
---
Reported.
---
I'mma go look now.
---
If you want to speed the process i'll let you do some on my account as well lmao
---
Except what matters in bossing isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs affordable, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs the best DPS. For example, the reason magic is used for almost no rooms in CoX is because melee and range both outclass it, not because people care about the 700g per cast. If cost was that much of an issue, no one would bother with the scythe or sanguinesti staff.
---
That's an exaggeration, QoL updates have been passing pretty consistently lately. We even have stuff like the seed vault now. As long as it doesn't affect xp rates, there's a good chance it'll pass.
---
Yes please!!!
---
Is that Bosch or Memling or something on the right? Quite curious honestly.

I agree, you can make it as afk as you want, really. It is quite popular to hate on though. I wish this weren't the case.

I have a really weird brain where certain things stick with me, the elaborate story you told of potentially coming across the guy several times within years despite not knowing each other, it kind of shows we all know each other by playing this game together and gives me some sort of weird sentimental feeling about it. Gl on ur death runes man and merry Christmas, if you don‚Äôt celebrate that then happy whatever you do cele :)

I don‚Äôt but when you go out of your way to classify a group of people as neets for literally no reason, which some if not a good portion of them probably aren‚Äôt neets, shows you‚Äôre just saying it to be a dick. If you can‚Äôt understand this then idk

youre right! accounts like [this](https://i.imgur.com/UykkBMB.png) have clearly been doing their bird houses, alching, charging orbs and getting "clan drops". how silly of me to forget all that = 300m+ worth of gear!
---
Me after I get zenyte drop
---
You seem pretty dense. Video game addictions exist. The same way substance addictions exist. I'm curious how many times you need someone to tell you that before it sinks in.
---
not surprised coming from revenant, always been a scummy e dater clan that wants to be rot so bad.
---
Isn't mole drop rate like 1/3k? you got it super early on then.
---
Request denied.
---
First post for A pin lol
---
Let's get this maufak to mod-response amount of upvotes. I want to see some POH Gauntlet and feel the wrath of a dozen Baby Mole's for shits and giggles.
---
Simple merry christmas for my entry. Thanks for doing this!
---
On God
---
Pretty sure when I made my 07 acc it took me more time to realize I only needed to cast it once I don't actually have to kill a chicken
---
Those are awesome! So much nostalgia.
---
Holy shit you're here too, how do you manage this
---
Remember the days when people actually skilled and collected resources because it was worth it? Bots took that away from us. 
---
Personally, I enjoyed mining. But its simply not worth doing now.
---
Christmas Miracleüôèüèª

I don‚Äôt.
---
What if I told you not every regular main buys gold and that its totally possible to boost or bot on an ironman
---
I'm an Ironman doing range - currently doing iron knives I've made.
---
I see a lot of people use crossbows. Why? And should I be using them? I've got 42 range at the moment. How do I acquire the best crossbows? Or the bolts.
---
They're not as huge as people give them credit for
---
Good old galaxy clan! Haven't changed I see
---
I feel like the dragon projection is slightly optimist. 
---
The top players will definitely rush point and complete all their pending tasks to secure their ranking on the last few days of the league. Wouldn't be surprised to see the point needed jump to 19/20k at the last minute.
---

i like this meme thank your for this meme
---
I‚Äôd like one!
---
Judt to mine essence and use lamps‚ÄîI learned that from earlier comments in this thread!
---
That Rick and morty themed one looks super dope.
---
It‚Äôs actually like 186m or something but since it is very close to 200m, 126 virtual level often associated with it
---
I honestly agree, there's something satisfying about the rhythm of runecrafting. I also enjoy it, but unfortunately I usually only have an hour or so to play per day so it's painful to see that I've only gained 17k xp
---
That‚Äôs also very true. Maybe I am in the minority when I say this, but I wish those drops wouldn‚Äôt be a thing. My all time favorite memories have always been when I am collecting resources, making good money doing that, and chatting away with others in the area and/or friends who are also online.

My current clue is 85 mining with full prospectors. At 71 struggling
---
I like when people try to talk shit about a CC and yet they crop the photo to only show exactly one line, showing no context at all to the picture.
---
Who knows, maybe you said nothing and they are toxic.
---
But when you post only one line, I'm going to assume you were being a dumb fuck and they rightfully kicked you and now you're angry and trying to "ruin their rep" or some shit.

Because that's not why people are against it most of the time.

I think there's a solid number of people who believe too many resources are being spit out by monsters

Killerwatts are just as bot-heavy for exactly the reasons you outlined.

Cows are where it's at.

Was 84 before the ban
---
The Essence Running discord stared as ZMI but pivoted to Astrals and Lavas after Jagex removed ZMI running.
---
I feel like you're going to run into this in any game tbh. Bunch of shithead edgelords thinking they're funny. I remember a specific game from my childhood turned into a festering shithole full of people forming Nazi swastikas etc.
---
Same to you!
---
Hey checking this. What do you usually need in your bird houe run? How do you make your runs?
---
What would be the reason to adding this though?  Correct me if I'm wrong but Ironmen already have specific ironmen gear and a special icon next to their name so they can properly show off (Which I'm fine with, I think showing off something crazy you've achieved in-game is what drives people to get their accomplishments), but where do you draw the line? Should other hard to earn items like the T bow or Scythe be different for HCIM or IM than regular accounts?  I think its fine as is personally
---
76 levels to go? Have you heard of boosting? Just get a +5 boost
---
Is that cheating
---
Played out series?! Are you insane??
---
The rune ones look amazing man, that's amazing &lt;3
---
It'll be back soon!
---
That‚Äôs what I meant, now the discord just does lavas and astrals, imo the new runs are actually better than the old zmi, because it gives a new market for skilled runners hoping to get some extra cash, and lower skilled runners (me) a chance to try to improve :)
---
Lol very nice. Did you splash 99 magic and that's what inspired you?
---
What specific game was that?
---
I actually trekked into the wildy to get the charcoal rather than buying it. Dunno if that makes me even more stupid for wasting that amount of time üòÇ
---
Out of the loop what's this about?
---
Good old Habbo Hotel.
---
I just think hes very cute!!! Everyones being mean to him! It makes me sad.

---
I believe 126 is around 184m xp or something so they might be a bit lower but if they put in the effort to get that high up there they probably did just go all the way to 200.
---
I mean, any gaming company would do the same. It's pretty common sense that if your playerbase loves something you should find a way to reference it.
---
Yes, that's sorta what he does.
---
:D
---
Sign me up. These look so good thanks for this!
---
Hi, context was we have a rule where people are free to behave however they people until someone is being targetted or being made to feel uncomfortable. At that point you've abused the freedom given to you and will be asked to stop/behave like an adult again. 
---
OP didn't like that this including anything they personally deemed offensive, such as jokes offensive to certain groups of people, use of derogatory language etc. We don't draw a line as we like to let our cc be able to act like adults and poke fun at each other, until its no longer a joke and someones upset.
---
He proceeded to flame the cc, make comments in discord and rejoined on alts to continue arguing. Said 99% of cc members are racist and then continued onto this post. Ironically arguing against stereotyping by stereotyping.
---
We run our clan in a way not to police what members are saying and doing, its a video game people. I can appreciate thats not for everyone but i don't have time/effort to deal with people being prematurely offended on others behalves.
---
Only 75 more levels to go
---
Lmao me too, even same location as you. But for me, it was the whip I borrowed from a friend. I thought he would be so proud of me for making so much money so I could buy my own.
---
Wondering if I should make a cball alt. Just hit big with DWH drops so I could easily bond up and fund an alt with bars
---
This is so cool, good luck everyone!
---
Are you really this dumb? What is the context of this thread we're in?
---
[likewise](https://i.imgur.com/pEh49rK.png)
---
Depending on what kind of quests and skills you already have done, you can do Dragon Slayer 2 and unlock Vorkath. You should be able to complete it at your combat level, it should be pretty easy at level 100 or so. Once you finish that, you can grind Vorkath kills for 800-1000k an hour, which only gets faster the higher your range/defense gets.

A simple angle shift and it's the peace symbol.

For example there could be a league where there is pvp everywhere with some safe zones and boosted xp rates.
---
I just decided I want to work on getting RC up and wanted to watch the rest of Stranger Things that I didn't finish. Not sure when I actually set up my XP tracker but I did about 200k xp of the 1.1m xp I need off half of the 2nd season and like half of the 3rd season before I got tired of doing it.

Thank you!!

coz people find it offensive bunch of nonsense
---
A lot of options for solid desktops around that range, laptops not so much.  Anything with an i5 or equivalent and designated graphics card would do the trick. I built my friend one with a 1060 and an older i5 for less than 400 that would be capable of what you're asking.

These are sick

How long?

Nah I stick by what I say.

RWT is much safer than they want you to think.

WHAT‚ÄôS THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL?

oi mate just make a zeah locked ironman

Honestly, if you are paying for membership instead of buying bonds, rooftop agility will pay for a dpick easily.

Kinda unrelated but I wonder how much the bottomless bucket would cost if there was no tool leprechaun

Don‚Äôt understand slayer. Never played a skiller. Wouldn‚Äôt the amount of laps make him higher then 65? All those 200‚Äôs, seems like an insane amount of gameplay. Or is there a slayer training method that he just hasn‚Äôt done?
---
It's like 150k an hour but very afk.
---
hah the rooftop is only to get me the graceful legs body and gloves, have the legs so far, really just wanna fish.

These look very cool

[how am I ruining a clans rep that is openly racist](https://imgur.com/a/cYfPvuA)
---
Yeah it switched to those after they nerfed ZMI running.
---
I can't help with laptops per say, but if you want my opinion. I'd recommend building a gaming pc if you wanna stream/record. For 500$ you can easily build a gaming PC that can not only play but also record/stream most games.
---
A 500$ gaming pc would be a little overkill for osrs though. You could probably build a pc for streaming osrs for roughly 300. If you're okay with building a pc and using used parts. It's relatively simple and there are tons of videos on how to do this. 
---
Prebuilt gaming PC's are ok to sometimes if you wanted to go that route, but they tend to be overpriced for what you get.
---
If you decide to build a gaming pc just make sure to do your research. If you wanna know more about some budget builds I could reccomend watching nerd on a budget,randomgaminginhd,and linustechtips(scrapyardwars)
---
These look so cooool!!!
---
I would recommend training your construction, defense, and hp. I do a lot of abyss runecrafting but I completely forgot about a few of those layers of stress bc I hardly ever take damage (76 defense) and I use an ornate pool (82 construction) to refill run energy every 5ish trips. This also heals the missing hp, so I'm never low or worried about eating. I'm also not worried about pkers because I'm not much of a target and I'm not risking much. I was pk'd once at lower levels because I wore a dragon med helm, but now that my defense is higher I just wear full graceful and still take very little damage. If I get pk'd, the only thing lose is a black pickaxe and an amulet of glory. On top of that, I carry the falador shield so I could quickly recharge prayer and protect the glory, but I honestly haven't ever needed to use it.
---
I stand in the middle just so the boss always finds me, I read that if you stand in the corner they can have trouble gaining aggro. This may not be true.

Ummm, if it wouldn‚Äôt be too much trouble.... I.. uh wouldn‚Äôt mind the void scythe one.

Has Runespan ever been polled? I know a lot of people would say it devalues their time spent training the skill but it was a genuinely fun minigame and made the skill so much easier.

You better not keep all this once you hit 10m, I recommend 15 screenshots And then giving the GE the worlds largest supply of death runes

The third post of yours *might* constitute calling somebody a racist, depending on your interpretation. 
---
Then again, when you've got a clan that doesn't forbid the word and actually care about context, the word loses all power of racism in favor of context.
---
Nobody in this clan is running around calling random people "The n word" or discriminating against a race.
---
Use of a word is not racism. Grow the fuck up
---
Sarachnis, but not really a money maker there
---
Runecrafting got a lot better as I did it. I enjoyed zmi crafting and did it for like a week or two for hours every day but after I quit and my friends tried to drag me back I couldn‚Äôt get into it. Once you get the rhythm it‚Äôs fine but until then it sucks
---
One can participate and not recommend at the same time.
---
If you are afraid of bans, don‚Äôt do it.
---
If you know how to be smart, do as you please with your own money. 7 years no ban. All I‚Äôll say.
---
I never had any trouble with it. But after 20 min or so they stop spawning and you have to change corner.
---
Good luck nerds
---
You got some manly knees
---
Good days
---
At level 60+, the Seer's Village course isn't actually that bad. I honestly hated agility with a vengeance up to that point because the other courses are terrible, but Seer's gives great exp and great marks of grace. Even if you did barb fishing to 99 from the second you can start, it takes a player from 1 to 75~ agility. Not bad, but zero profit in it and honestly not that fun imo.
---
I don't think the jmods have even humored the idea. Idk what was fun about it, hunting for the yellow wizards was the worst.
---
A maxed skiller is 1600 actually. He has virtual levels on.
---
Wanan give me one?
---
Are you mad because you got killed in an area that was made for pvp?
---
Great rebuttal i see you are well skilled in the dying art of debate. Fuck outta here with ur out of context screenshots trying to create drama.

Yes that‚Äôs what reminded me of it and I hate not having it bc I end up forgetting what I have on it‚Äôs nice to peek at my equipment and see stats too while in bank!

I would like a pinno plis

After red cape he just lost it, man

awesome game mechanic, sad that it was removed.

Lol this is the funniest post I've seen on here! Love seen the conservatives rushing into your comments to cry! Merry Christmas!
---
One of the features from RS3 I'd really like to see is (skill total) on right click. I feel like I miss out on appreciating every skiller account because I just have no clue.
---
Dude these are dope!
---
Where do you check?
---
New here? He's a skiller. The goal is to level every skill (including slayer) without getting a single combat xp. It's more difficult than it sounds.

Theres a group of people who intentionally crash people, not for entertainment, just to ruin that persons day. Then theres Monereeka.

I'm more impressed you did all this with 11 quest points.
---
Nicely done!...
---
Is anyone going to talk about 65 slayer with 1 combat levels? No?
---
Hell yeah rc until the death of me!! The best skill in game
---
For real, leveling everything to 99 without leveling combat is the work of a future serial killer.

It's just a cosmetic... ;)

&gt; recoils work for slayer
---
Yes, however you didn't actually kill the NPC as it's passive damage, so you only get half xp. I believe there's a better method with a slayer partner where you get no exp by some bug abuse, saw it in a video a while back was too confusing tryhard for me tbh, so not sure.
---
I guess a huntress would be the one to be able to relax with her bow. I yield.

Thanks bro.

i5 with a designated graphics card for about $400?

That was the premise to my account. I don't really play much anymore though. Check my submissions for progress if you want.

I don't see why the slow skills need boosted anyway, there's way more fast ones than slow ones. People talk about buffing mining, agil and rc but they're pretty much the only skills that are unbearably slow. 3/23 ain't bad

They were indeed Saradominists. The campaign in Morytania was of Saradomin's forces against Drakan. Sliske made a deal with the brothers to give them more power, then turned them into wights under his control in service to Zaros.

Man this brings back a funny memory from 6th grade. My friend bought a few mil. Not sure how much exactly, but I think it was like 3/4 mil for 20 bucks. I asked my parents if I could do this but my dad said I had to earn it instead lol. He was a bit of a gamer himself and I honestly really respect him telling me no looking back at it. It was never about the money but my dad wanted me to "earn it". I also had to keep a summer journal to "earn" my first membership. I still read through that journal every now and then and god I can't thank him enough for forcing 10 year old me to do that.
---
So you're telling me since I can complete the Inferno with max gear, I am unable to make the mistake of getting phished by an intelligent and cunning bait? That's not very fair is it.

"haha, you are wrong."

Wow awesome pins, I‚Äôd love to have the lsp pin for my girlfriends backpack!
---
When I was in the clan, and I'm not op, they were this toxic clan, they would flame people call them the n word, all sorts of stuff like that, I got kicked when one of the OTHER leaders kicked someone from a raid, the person being one of their generals, because he was being extraordinary slow, I said, because I was teaching him, after teaching a few other people in that clan how to do theater of blood, that if hes gonna waste time like that then whatever, then I got kicked from the clan. It's like that, they just are toxic. They might have people in it, ROT does, doesnt mean they dont make certain places toxic ass places.

Ring her or I will

i actually pay $5 a month.... all joking aside, i dont mind updates that make the game easier, i just dont want useless skills to be brought into the game that dont offer anything to said game (looking at you all failed new skill polls).

i don't play runescape but what exactly are you talking about? does runescape have some sort of ingame financial bond? wtf
---
That‚Äôs some slow ass internet

What? Where is that being put forth?
---
This is a stupid as fuck argument. Things wouldn't need to be cheaper if players could actually make money by skilling.
---
Is that something people get banned for these days? I thought paying people to do FC was common practice honestly.

Not sure if under any context this is okay.

I don't even have 1mil xp combined....

But this was changed to combat the bots

Your username never changes unless you change it, someone logs into your account and changes it, or a jmod changes it. If it was a previous name, it's anywhere from 1-3months before your rsn no longer shows a previous name.
---
Did you mean most reposted?
---
meanwhile my clan got ripped apart due to a clique wanting full control over it, hacking the clan account, deleting messages in the discord and deleting the entire friend and ignore list, and then poaching members to a new cc
---
These are so cute! üíú
---
How is it more difficult than it sounds. You don't get combat xp from skilling. And it doesn't sound difficult. It sounds like cruel and unusual punishment in most states.
---
Yes
---
Yes sir
---
You're a shitty troll. This dude obviously out a lot of time into his account

I don't think theres any context this exact sentence is a way an "adult" should act.

This boils down to ideals of how a clan should be ran. Which isn't really something I'm interested in debating. I just wanted to provide context to screenshots posted, which I feel has been done.
---
Yes i hunt chins with it all day with no issues
---
Merry Christmas friend, this is awesome and I hope he loves it.
---
Clue scroll (beginner). Hope to god a 9 year old knows where toothbrushes are kept. Jk parenting done right üòâ
---
Dollar general did not, Dollar TREE has them, ones with phone holders, lasers, there just regular pens but have a stylus tip. Its what i got and works perfect.
---
Cheated the spirit of the game, I'd say yes.
---
My bro just got into the game again,  he'd like ther gift
---
You can have a technically ‚Äúbad‚Äù tattoo and have  it still be an amazing tattoo, it‚Äôs your body and I think it looks cool as fuck. I hope you don‚Äôt care about what people on the 07 reddit think about it, merry Xmas my guy
---
Respect man. How long did this take?
---
Very wrong on this front. Wrath runes are a good 500k and a few k more xp hr. Flat out better then double deaths.
---
You give odds
---
Fuck the others. while extremely expensive and detailed tattoos are cool, a minimalist one like this is also sweet. Besides, a high detailed rat is much less appealing than this imo
---
Good tattoo
---
It's EHP
---
Youre literally the best, i just got sent a wall of text about how i should get it covered up or redone. Youre great, merry xmas ‚ô°‚ô°
---
And defeating the strongest melee monster in game to get the best melee cape in game doesn‚Äôt make sense or is somehow funny?
---
Get 83 cons before you boost so you can also build ornate jewelry box
---
Is your imagination so small that you can‚Äôt imagine pkers also griefing in chat?
---
Really I never post like this but really I fucked up by becoming invested in this game.
---
!
---
Happy xmas?
---
That was the tism
---
In wow you have an over all character level 1-120
---
You can pay $60 to skip all the content for levels 1-110.
---
That would defeat the purpose of mobile! Im not hating though. It would still be cool to add. I'd see it as a "why not" feature
---
This is why I just entity-hide other players pets lol
---
Did the mean man hurt your feelings? I get it it‚Äôs annoying to have someone talking smack to you when you‚Äôve just lost some money but hardly worth crying about. Log out for the rest of the day and come back tomorrow and get back into it
---
Not enough people do farm runs to bring the supply up to the demand. You aren't missing anything, herb runs are a great money maker, ranarrs in particular. As others have said, the wiki has a calculator that takes into account your level and certain other features to determine how much profit you get from farming each herb. I've made most of my bank and almost complete house from herb runs started with ranarrs then went to snapdragons, herb runs are great money if you get into a routine.
---
woah :D
---
i don‚Äôt play RS, just lurk here and watch content on youtube, but these look really cool :)
---
Does killing cerb count as the elite step?
---
fucking furries!

Your finished replying to every comment on this thread or

Pools closed.

Use correct color spice on a stew, drink it. Not what you desired for a boost? Restore your stats and try again.
---
Oh goodness... I think it was better not knowing
---
Tutorial island? What an xp waste. Why doesn't she just train your RC for you
---
You are the best
---
Rolling for a rune
---
I want pl0x :(
---
They deserve each other
---
wbu? im just afk plankmaking this made my night
---
This is cool. Ur cool.
---
Do you know what google is? It has heaps of money makers on there. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that EVERY player knows how to use google. 
---
That isn‚Äôt an excuse.
---
Can i has one pliz :'(
---
Ik you said this as a joke but i lowkey might get it
---
what if he tries to look somewhere and suddenly an old man in white robes and a yellow cape tries to smite him
---
Another mocking message mixed w slight encouragement to keep playing. 
---
As another person said I‚Äôm not 99 agility yet and will make up the graceful set again. And probably will.
---
I‚Äôm not really quitting and I just wanted to vent somewhere. Probably shoulda used a throwaway.
---
What a waste of a blink
---
Why are the shark eyes redacted though
---
Merry Christmas  my guy :)

They‚Äôre probably already gone but there are amazing and I‚Äôd take any leftover one

Gotta love the Note 10 stylus it's super nice
---
84+8 for a fully upgraded Portal Nexus even.
---
I‚Äôm super late but would love the chance to own one of these! Thank you and Merry Christmas :)
---
Wut
---
Got me lol I'll never be able to show my face again, you did it you saved reddit good job man, look we aren't scared of you. Do enjoy seeing every one of your recruitment ads getting negative downvotes, without me even contributing mine. Is what it is brotha, One day youll stop trying to lie your way outta situations and just own up to decisions you make.
---
You have no idea how fucking happy I am that you told me that because I've been going insane for the past hour trying to figure it out and now I can rest.
---
What is this guy
---
I like how you wrote that.
---
I bet. I play on the S9 its still a great experience but playing on a note/tablet would be the best.
---
Don't let your memes be dreams
---
1) get 83 so you can boost (8+ ornate jewelry box)
---
2) make sure you have crystal saw and materials
---
3) build in decreasing order of lvl (I.e. jewelry box before pool) 
---
4) good luck
---
When you're boosting, if the first two or three don't give you the level you need, wait until your levels change. This will keep it from dropping the level you need right after you boost. If you use runelite, the timer will help with this but it might take a cycle to get calibrated correctly
---
Who hurt you?
---
Lol bwah out here advertising in the ge for torso.

Go enjoy Christmas dude. You should know that this isn't the place for sympathy haha
---
Nothing wrong with some manly knees.
---
Merry Christmas. üòä
---
The Hunter one is amazing. 
---
They're all great.
---
Yeah I'd say that definitely falls in the same boat. You're gaining a big advantage over someone who isn't fortunate enough to drop that $60. Like driving a Ferrari in the Tour de France.
---
Add me in game. Santa might come
---
Don‚Äôt pretend you never felt this way before. Only difference is I vented w strangers.
---
does that help for resource gathering efficiency? or is it just bragging and a gauge to see how close to 200m you are at a glance?
---
You know this from experience?
---
https://i.redd.it/b1e5i2d86b641.png
---
I currently am. We started at 12am here. 
---
I just wanted to vent.
---
Wrong. A lot of the methods a main can use are completely different. Such as not being able to complete diaries for faster xp rates in mining, agility etc. Not being able to unlock rewards hidden behind quests such as certain farming patches. Can‚Äôt build a nexus so having to teleport tab everywhere. With RC not being able to do ZMI or lavas efficiently without the lunar spell Book. Can‚Äôt use barb fishing. Just small things like this makes it slower to a normal main.
---
Just when I thought that FE Men couldn't get any gayer.
---
Graardor and skotizo
---
Some other pets might also work
---
What happens to graceful set if you get pk'ed? I'm too scared to try it on my iron :x
---
Do you keep it, do you have an hour to pick it up?
---
Not the guy you replied to bud lol 
---
I agree with you, just pointing out that imo your specific example is perhaps a little flawed. 
---
Merry Christmas/happy holidays my guy
---
i like that!
---
Really? They're my favorite task by a mile, they're so fun to kill
---
Now I understand that the reason for ban is justified but just bear in mind that this was before OSRS and right after EOC. At the time of the offense I was confident the game would die and I would never play again. I felt nothing when I got banned, until OSRS was released. I am very grateful to be given another opportunity to play this beautiful game. I hope the community receives me with open arms instead of opposition. Thank you again, Jagex.
---
TL;DR: I broke a major rule when EOC was released but won't happen with OSRS. 
---
Also, Jagex customer support is better than people claim.
---
Those are some sick pins
---
One of us
---
ah okay. i suggested rewards but i see ur point.
---
Say, 10,000 every 4 hours or so?
---
Merry Christmas oldschool staff, keep up the good work. Theres issues here and there but overall game is doing well, you guys get way more flak than you deserve. Hope you all have a good day.
---
Don't you need like 90 rc or something
---
Merry Christmas! I appreciate all of the work the team does for the game we all love and want to thrive
---
I have only been doing this to get a ton of prayer pots and restores for free. However, while doing that I also saved up enough herbs to get 78 herblore. So that was nice
---
Wait.. nieve isn't dead after all!!! w00t!!
---
Get your eyes checked nibbas
---
Been waiting a long time to see this.  Love the vids m8, keep up the great work.  One of the best series out there.
---
Awesome. I was so happy when I got mine too. Hope you enjoy
---
He wants just the tip ;)
---
&gt; Sorry you feel that way! I genuinely love this tattoo and a very good (licensed) friend gave me this tattoo. I enjoy the rat, my friends enjoy the rat, and thats all that matters to me. So no, I will not take your suggestion!
---
Fair enough. This is useful information. I've got a few tattoos from a friend of mine who's an artist as well (one of which is much better than the other), and I love both of them. 
---
&gt;You clearly meant some sort of aggression considering you decided to comment a wall about how you think i should cover up something I put on MY body.
---
There was no aggression in my initial comment, so please do not misconstrue my concern as aggression. It was just a suggestion from someone who has a somewhat poorly done tattoo larger than yours which cannot be covered up or redone. 
---
&gt;It IS done well 
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;considering theres no way to do a geometric rat tattoo "well." 
---
I disagree with both of these points. The tattoo itself, *despite the inherent sentimental value*, is done poorly. I do believe there is a correct way to do a geometric rat tattoo well. This unfortunately was not the way to do it. 
---
It's okay to have poorly done sentimental tattoos. I've told my friend that I don't intend to let him touch up the one he did on me, as it's a good reference point for his progress and improvement as an artist. He's even admitted that it's shitty. Ultimately, I understand if you don't want to change anything about it. Just don't be delusional.
---
When the crack is hit
---
Very cool
---
I'm in a similar situation right now, were you able to state your reasoning? I really want to explain myself but the appeal doesn't allow for that. (I genuinely know mine was a false ban I swear I never macro'd or botted, I never even tried sigh)
---
99 is the max in the game. Hes using a plugin. So what do u think bb
---
I think I get sad when I see the estimated amount of runs are basically in the thousands to get to the upper levels.
---
How do you get over that mental block of RC exp being so low?
---
Maybe I'm spoiled because I did WT to 99, and my RC exp per hour is under 25k if I focus.
---
Btw, using abyss to run cosmics and tele to poh to restore run energy and tele to edgeville. Any recommendations on what to do differently?
---
Why do most players here hate the GE?
---
This is not customer support, this is a copy paste statement that they send to anybody willing to appeal a permanent ban after a certain period of time.  
---
Bot farm owners get this exact same message when they appeal for the thousands of accounts they've botted.
---
Good luck to everyone in the draw!
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
goodluck me
---
Make sure you have a grown cat or hell cat. Not a kitten that was not ideal
---
Yeah, I just stick to 2k worlds so I can dodge people like that.
---
No 200m fishing? The fuck is this
---
You will have to run back and pick it up within the hour if you're below 20 wilderness. Above 20 wilderness the set gets deleted and you have to earn it again, but for abyss runecrafting you shouldn't need to worry about that.
---
I like the series but it‚Äôs at least slightly off-putting to see the team clearly play favorites with him (references in Halloween event and in seemingly every news post), it would be nice if they‚Äôd show verf or j1mmy or some other creators some love instead of all of the community outreach attention going to one person
---
no one in the high lvl community gives two shits about warding skill, it would have only taken 15 hours to get 99 warding if you had 200-400m to spend, which isn't a lot and isn't a long time.  the problem with the warding skill was the fact that it had zero content to anyone who had ancestral armor, the skill was literally filler that wouldn't have effected gameplay.
---
These are wonderful, I‚Äôd love to have one if the offer is still available.
---
And its okay to be a dickhead! Clear off, its my body, my tattoo. I like it. Sorry you dont. 
---
Art is all subjective, and im sorry you genuinely wasted your time even suggesting i cover up a tattoo because some dick told me he didnt like it. 
---
Its literally a rat tattoo. And youre a dick.
---
I've had a master clue in my bank for months! I got it the same week prif was introduced! I got a clue to go dig somewhere within prif city limits.
---
Monday, I finished my final quest, SotE! First thing I did was finish that clue! Dragon mace and 400k in supplies.  Then I got my quest cape!
---
Good week :)
---
That's the Mature clue scroll. Adults only.
---
The fuck are you on about?
---
He was payed to do it. You can just spend like 50 bucks to get any celeb to say whatever these days.
---
The thing about the world is often there is a lot more nuance to it. Things aren't always so black and white. We just take the easiest thing and roll with it. We got bait and switched and now all we are talking about is the trick that they used to get us to talk about it like we are.
---
Like how do we not know OP didn't do this to garnish upvotes and so he could be the good guy exposing the bad guys?
---
Bro and the music that it fucking plays in the mlm. I always change it to any other track because I can't bear listening to it‚Äìnot even a second.
---
Why are Dark Souls fans so insecure, bro for 99.99% of players you cannot beat the game without rolling. I'm assuming you parry everything you can which is literally what I said, obviously some bosses you can't whatever. Just because you have watched someone spend thousands of hours doing something incredibly challenging does not make the original game easy
---
Dam these are bloody gorgeous 10/10 mate! (Only issue is that there's no cabbagee)
---
It's not a real 3D scroll, it's on a single sheet of paper
---
Just cause it's possible does not therework make the original game easy
---
History repeats itself, ironic as fuck you have the nerve to call someone else cancer.
---
Except Firefox is actually the best.
---
Stonks
---
I think it's a 2D image of a clue scroll that was printed on white construction paper and then cut out. At first I figured the white border lines were due to photoshop, but due to the shadows and the uneven print job (little grainy) I'm pretty sure it's legit.
---
Loo00ool never seen this one!!!!1!!1!
---
A random player "gifted" me a dragon xbow yesterday as well! The only difference is that this guy was trying to lure me into the wilderness by dropping his xbow, stepped one tile away and didnt take into consideration i had telegrab runes with me l0l.. a hefty christmas gift haha
---
So basically it grants access to training the skill.
---
would love to get one of these for my friend, he collects pins and has 3 pin boards but not one runescape pin? Have you got a link to a store for any of them?
---
Well it seems like we are playing different games then cause I dont see people doing activities that give 0 rewards
---
I'll take anything! Merry Christmas!!
---
Awesome pins, Merry Christmas!
---
I got a d long
---
That's also how most sound in minecraft was made iirc
---
L O L. Hush, You aren‚Äôt making things any better for yourself. Bring some chins to throw at jad to lure the healers in a throw or two. Thank me later.
---
I died in the most hardcore way possible; the great and venerable todt caught me with my pants down.
---
You can use your cat to fight the behemoths (use fish on curtain to heal your cat) and you will get a full spice jar of the right color. Check wiki which behemoth to kill for which color.
---
Looks dope let me slap it on my pencil case
---
I mean you get cosmetic rewards that you can sell for GP on your main. It's not like the trophy is the only reward.
---
1 person with 2 accounts with only the main attacking, still is solo imo
---
The funk
---
Any pins left?
---
Often it does mean the person doing it is wrong
---
yeah exhibitionists at their best

Not even HCIM smh..

in the Twisted Leagues discord Equinar gives daily stats updates. I believe he posts weekly ones on this sub too.
---
SOMEONE CARRY THIS GUY, let him alt or something!
---
love it arcxhie
---
Ya, wtf is up with that guy bragging about his huge skull and I'm over here all insecure about my tiny head
---
Alright so in your first post I was semi on board with the philosophy of prayer being utilized but now that you‚Äôre actually plugging the spectral I‚Äôm going to have to believe you‚Äôre wanting it to get a use for personal gain. In which case, I respect the hustle but nty. I mean tbh if we‚Äôre talking about how niche a spectral is at least it has a like real reason to be used. Arcane on the other hand is the only spirit shield that doesn‚Äôt have a passive effect, and it‚Äôs MARGINALLY better than a Mages book at like 20x the cost.
---
They mention many. But swamp man is one of the most popular so they mention him the most.

That's not a video

So awesome! I‚Äôd love to gift one of these to my buddy. Plays RS way to much haha
---
Darts are also weaker, hence why they're cheaper. Rune knives are better than dragon darts, for instance.
---
I don't remember asking if u asked tho
---
^ yeah what he said
---
True! But it says ‚Äúmom and nick‚Äù so I assumed they were the dad. Either way, good on them!
---
This looks awkward af funeral vibes
---
How can the attacker reset your account a second time? Change the password on your email address and change the email and password on the account (email if you can, though I dont think its possible) do all this after doing virus scans of course. The only way they got your account information by phishing way you likely put in the information and tried to log into a fake runescape website or something, that was the current information you put in at that time from the phishing attack.
---
I too enjoy it. It's not too bad and the pouches can help speed things money-wise up a lot when you start getting things like double cosmics and such.
---
Ahhh didnt think of that. I thought nick might be step dad
---
Got one left?:)
---
No it‚Äôs 100% banable, it‚Äôs cheating, and plus fire capes are super easy

That‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt

Cool, might do but 99 is a long way away rip

"Slayer makes great money overtime"
---
You would think but hes got 99 already lol. Im guessing ZMI or Zeah library?
---
Used to see this guy at ZMI, when I was doing 77. Thought he was going for 104M (lvl 120). I clearly underestimated his ambition
---
Merry Christmas, now gimme a pin ya filthy animal!
---
the thought of receiving one of these just brightened my day
---
But it's also small enough to do stuff like this ^^
---
Quest items are great for this too. I made tons of cash when I just started because I tried to buy a comp ogre bow and it wasn't selling for 5x the ge avg. Made a few 100 bows and turned out I was literally the only one selling it.
---
Netflix lags BAD for me in chrome. Makes my whole PC show. FF no issue.

You‚Äôre a great parent.
---
I dont think you're in the minority on this one tbh. A lot of people think bossing should bearly be profitable outside of very valuable uniques similar to how corp is.
---
You guys seem to be missing the part where I say "MADE-UP". In any case, it's not an idea that is ever going to go anywhere further than the subreddit, where it's just a little fun idea with a few different mechanics that relate to prayer. Just so happens that the spectral/elysian have prayer smite negating effects that make it perfect for the idea I've come up with relating to prayer. I'm surprised you're not mentioning me trying to artificially raise the ring of gods, the rapier, claws, scythe, holy wraps or the boots? Some of them are niche and cheap too.  
---
I'm just going to be bored asf when they release the nightmare and it's corp 2.0 with more regular and more pricey drops for a few weeks.
---
Those inventory makers are god awful
---
mist runes?  at which altar
---
i think the order is like
---
lava &gt; mud = steam then all others, steam is 95% the xp of lavas but profit, muds are like sick profit.  in early osrs lumberyard scrolls were a lot cheaper too and u didnt need to use the balloons.

With brews or guthix rests you can boost above 10hp, it's definitely a viable method albeit annoying (i've done it on my 10hp account)

Cute, but i think he would look a little better if he was colored or shaded or something. Where is it at?

Looks like you did it yourself with your non-dominant hand.

Which is exactly why jagex would want to reference it... I never said it was obscure or anything.

Sick pins my dude

This is one of the highest commented posts I've seen on this subreddit. Nice
---
Did you make these? If so super rad
---
When I was super young, we weren't allowed to spend money on video games. I'd resort to sending cash in the mail for these lmao.
---
that would make the price hike, not crash. The opposite is possibly the case. Not sure how accurate it is but I remember hearing about how they're not bots either, just Venezuelans going hard. Which I find hard to believe seeing how the top Zulrah kc is in the 120k+.

Yo that's pretty cool

Merry Christmas thanks for this would love to grab any one of them

Oh boy, a woke redditor stating the over obvious but still wrong though since you haven't experienced the relationship between the RS3 team and their players :p
---
I‚Äôm low level/new for this sub, but I‚Äôve had way more positive experiences than negative in OSRS.
---
Two high level players have gone to the bank to get something because they just see me farming with crummy gear (I had just died via not knowing vamps regen forever if you don‚Äôt have a stake).  I now farm xp in grade A iron hand me downs.

The original in British.

Very cool stuff! Too bad the old post got removed.

What was it

Good luck yall

Must be quite old if it's just 24B Debt

only because you didn't have lego

I did make a new one but playing on the first account I ever created just feels great. Plus all the familiar names on my friends list is op nostalgia.

Now give him a cabbage as reward. Gotta teach em fast

There were only two things I really didn't understand and took me forever, this is one of them, the other was prospecting the rocks lol

your doing it wrong

I always found it weird how runeacape is a bit broken without ironman. As an ironman you're playing a single player game though.
---
How does this say twisted league
---
Boing
---
*xfiles music*
---
Warding has literally no use in the game unless they retroactively deleted xp gain from non-combat magic spells.
---
The game doesn't need a whole slew of magic robes. They could add some, sure, but we didn't need a skill to back it whatsoever. Especially not one as contrived as Warding, which in premise is shaky at best.
---
Who cares if they buy bonds to get items they want.
---
U mad???
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt want to give away the outfit

Lmao if you mess up ur inventory this bad you shouldnt be raiding anyways

I've legit had over 20 in the past week

How's a 9 year old going to fight the NPC that pops up?
---
Yeah, even though I know it‚Äôs bullshit my heart still skips a bit, had this account like 6 years it would kill me to lose it
---
Totally could be seen with the way you got all salty when you commented regarding his wealth.
---
My god those are beautiful! Do you create them yourself?
---
Why in the world was this comment downvoted? We're literally in the thread to talk about acts of kindness and that's what you wrote about
---
Cue bots spamming feathers to try and get a tbow

Yeah I understand but if there are no updates on the official website then dw about it. Id maybe try to find out how they got your email in the first place

Is it too late to start collecting with limited editions being involved or is there not too many?

Pretty sure he has time, definitely doesn't have the interest.

Shit, he's going to be praising his dad for that teleport. He'll use it and be transported straight into runescape.

Add me Foxy 2791 - mostly doing quests
---
Yay!
---
His slayer is pretty high, maybe he had some good rng and was able to afford that stuff.
---
Should someone tell him about the names thing??
---
? What does this have to do with church?
---
You can try it on Bootcamp but I don't think it'll run \*\*that\*\* much better. 
---
If the OSRS rendered using a GPU you could buy an eGPU for you Mac.
---
He's no match for the brothers
---
Bruhhh! His slayers 65 on a lvl 3 CB who are these people and how do I give you my money!
---
You can use real world money to purchase a traceable item from Jagex called a bond. This bond can be consumed to give you 2 weeks of membership or it can be sold on the GE for a few million gp.
---
Dog.. just plant a tree
---
Do you mean the unfrosted thing? Try the same way you got it originally
---
They aren't,  they are beneficial for people who never skill.
---
The GPU plugin apparently doesn't work on Mac. At least not yet.
---
Best. Parent. Ever.
---
No, I dont think they even deserve to be banned. If people are dumb enough to fall for something like this then they deserve it lol.
---
Unfortunately, scamming is a big thing in this game. Gotta learn from it and dont make the same mistake again.
---
Most of these servers are hosted in countries Jagex will struggle to touch. The actual adverts run without a problem because Google, Facebook, whoever, is getting paid so it's not in their best interests to disallow these ads.

So your basically saying if someone targets kids and robs them it‚Äôs the kids fault for having it and being young and naive my problem is mental health so fuck you not being dumb you cunt it was just genuinely thinking someone had a kind heart on Christmas instead of being a fucking grinch like you ya fat dog cunt

At that point though why not just use your phone?

Thank you for the vandos lolza

Regardless of whether you like this content, let us please stop promoting youtube channels and videos on this sub

Your response is the exact reason why you deserved it. Thank you for confirming that you definitely did.
---
Just solo raids lmao, woox did it with broad bolts, slayer staff, and a rune battle axe, no excuses.
---
Thank you I hope you enjoy rotting away like the scum you are
---
Thanks for the bandos lolza
---
Well i hope you get hacked, try then get your account back :) there has been cases where authenticator means nothing..so merry xmas to you mr. Jagex employee.
---
Lmao
---
Imagine getting made for being taken advantage of when thats all you were trying to do in the first place. LOL staking a low level account for easy money when instead they made you look like the idiot you are.
---
Hey me surgeon
---
Those pins look amazing I want one! :)
---
For those wondering, I had about 150 CP coming back to OSRS after a years break. Managed to gain 21m XP in the last 30-45 days to have the minimum stats to complete all quests ( [https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/track.php?player=jaspersnail&amp;time=45d](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/track.php?player=jaspersnail&amp;time=45d)  )   
---
Finished all Grandmaster's in the last week or so, leaving my very final quest to complete. X Marks the Spot. The free quest.
---
You know people like you are the reason people like me don‚Äôt fucking talk to people and end up dead by 20
---
When just mentioning someone is considered having a connection to the community 
---
4/20 megakeks
---
I know how the account security works. I wont get hacked and I have, and will always be able to recover every account I have If I need to. Ty for the concern though, merry xmas to you as well and good luck.
---
Just imagine posting this fake bait post in the hope someone will take pity and give you bandos. You are an utter nonce. 
---
Thanx for the bandos retard!

Daamn nice! Is it over already? Can i still participate?

Tight bro Gratz and merry Christmas

You shouldn't let it get to you that much, It's the internet. Dont snap at someone if you can't handle words being thrown back. Have a nice xmas.

So that he‚Äôll be lucky enough to be eradicated by a dark wizard or a rogue hobgoblin?

I use 'em at sand crabs sometimes for dirt cheap mage xp.
---
Something suggests I think he's lying.
---
Are they charging money for this? Lmao
---
I second this question
---
You're a good person.
---
And what are they supposed to do? Say no and get replaced with people who will listen?

Haha! Take my upvote

Thank you for the welcome. If I do have any queries, I shall message you. Have added you for now. :)

They look good!
---
No wayyyy
---
i SHOULDVE LISTENED
---
GOD WHY DIDNT I LISTEN
---
PLEASE
---
Nah you get 1bil sweets when you spawn in, and disappear when you achieve ur cape.
---
It's because the American version is definitely better.
---
(D)
---
Merry Christmas you beautiful person!
---
Wtf do you mean? What you said makes no sense
---
Don‚Äôt forget, that it denies bots from getting to the mainland. So botting numbers will decrease.
---
Shit you right. Got all of those equipped and ready to go.
---
5Head bot nuke
---
Please report me for saying something on reddit lol
---
Sure, just report them for scamming too beacause in case they scam or since they are disturbing your GE time just report them for disruptive behavior too the dude will probably ask for your contact details too so might aswell report him for asking to provide contact information.

Glad to see the series still going! Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to maintain enough juicy content to keep these episodes going like they have been so far! Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode! :)

im fucking dead its literally his wifes son

Very cool work!

I joined

Best gift ever

is this the soy face? lol

---
This is amazing! When we were kids "Santa" would leave a message in our fireplace on some old looking parchment. We would then have to solve about 5 clues to find where our presents were hidden. It was absolutely fantastic for us, especially my younger siblings. This is some Grade A parenting here, taking the kid's hobby into consideration. Good job Mom and Nick!
---
Another comment said main uses ely and alt uses justi helm and buckler
---
Stop disclosing my obby cap merch strat
---
Damn I wonder how much hes made from selling ba leeches
---
It uses one slot for a fully charged one and one slot for less than fully charged. Just have one of each and make sure you dont use more than one at a time. Fully uncharged takes up another slot as well but I just sell those right away.
---
He's gonna tear up the yard looking for the casket
---
how many hours does it take to craft 100k?
---
Imagine wearing a ring of life to sand crabs
---
Everyone wants money, but just do quests and diaries until you can start doing productive money makers instead of slow ones. Your account really doesn't need money for a while
---
Yes please :)
---
Seems like you answered your own question
---
These pins are really nice too but they are kind of overtly complex on the character ones, it makes since they went with Angelscape due to the simplicity of their designs. Although I gotta say, I love how clean these rune pins look.
---
Don't give a pin away to any of these goblin boys. I will gladly take one off your hands before these Tim Allen cucks steal them all.
---
Someone just got lured to the wildy for his christmas loot lmao
---
Probably just uses runelite
---
You know he replied to the comment where you said that right
---
gl me
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible

---
Ah good old Santa clavs
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs looks like this guy took the easy way of getting money and bought bonds he didn‚Äôt really admit you goof

Judging by the shit you're spewing I would guess that your brain works slower than most

How do you find a spot without bots?

Thank you, sorry I‚Äôm dyslexic so sometimes I miss those typos a little easier than I should.

I think some little noobs still get through thanks to RNG.

You think all the aggressive mobs had deer meat? And that's what make them so aggressive?

Gratz,  just did the last quest (DS2) myself to.

Still works the same though!

Grats dude, now go trim it üòâ
---
I thought I heard something this morning..
---
Quabity Over Liberty change for sure
---
Ah, gotcha! Sorry about your dad :(
---
Beginner clues give no money
---
Easy clues give almost no money
---
Medium clues are the best to do stupid amounts of
---
Hard clues are inconvenient and about the same money as medium so they suck
---
Elite/master clues are great but its hard to have a steady supply of them
---
Theoretically if we did this then maxed output of level 3 bots with auto attack on flooding the fight caves, how long would it take until one got a fire cape due to every enemy attack splashing them? I need to know
---
Roses are red, violets are blue; moonman...

I openly AFKed NMZ while doing Xmas activities last night. Everyone stared while I spam-clicked my rock cake and absorption.
---
&gt;yellow text on black background
---
&gt;literally none
---
Somehow, you managed to capture every single suggestion post on here in 2 bullet points.
---
Yeah it is not the end of osrs for me for sure !
---
I'd be happy to pk with you regardless of what my def lvl will be ! You can add me if you want. My rs name is theoreve.
---
i literally asked for this for Christmas. i hope i get it (:
---
the cost of all the rewards have been known and officially announced since day 1 of the league release.
---
Now thats just fucking disgusting! what kind of scum would be selling nudes in a game that children play. I'll take care of this, just message me the name of this heathen and I will handle it. If they have an email make sure to send that too, just to be safe that they get banned.
---
there's really no way to know, but I HIGHLY
---
Maybe you should learn how to either escape or hold your ground, espescially if these sort of people piss you off. Then youre the one saying sit.
---
Awww thanks man! You too! Nice to see youre in a good mood on christmas!
---
I like the completable quest idea, maybe instead of something on login you could talk to the wise old man?
---
You cant give them away. No xp waste i dont have time to enter this or for you to ship it
---
Theres really no way to know for sure but I highly doubt any of the rewards will be expensive considering there willl be around 50-60k people trying to sell rewards all at the same time
---
some players think that buying gp is completely normal and that they should feel no shame for taking advantage of the loophole (bonds) brought on by Jagex's corporate greed. Fo' Shame Bond-Warriors. FO' SHAME.
---
It's a disgrace to players who respect the sanctity of sportsmanlike conduct.
---
!remindme 3 hours
---
Plzplzplz Am i too late to win?
---
I believe there is still a good selection of ones still for sale, never too late to start collecting, they're always adding more on some Thursdays with game updates.
---
These are so rad! Thank you for the 2nd chance!
---
I am but a simply minded fool who still does not get it. Care to explain?
---
Nope, never had that problem before.
---
"Sit noob"

Hes trying to lure his son into the wilderness. Ops son if youre reading this and you see a man with a purple staff and black and red robes RUN.
---
How are Brimhaven less efficient on a level 3? Also I only mentioned 4 skills because there the only ones it‚Äôs relevant for? Fucking troll.
---
Is it too late to join in?
---
O
---
I forget crystal weapons exist, ngl. Point was more so that they‚Äôre not all that much slower. No fuck they‚Äôre slower, I never denied that.
---
Spoke to you for a bit. Like I said I‚Äôll be on all day tomorrow. We can get some pking going if you want
---
Theyre like less than 50k
---
Are you like Krampus or something? Wtf.
---
Haha! Take my downvote
---
True, brimstone key in hand for Konar's chastity belt or something
---
Yea I mean my rc is above 7, I have to put my xp lamps into something, right?
---
he has a red party hat, pretty sure he merches cuz thats worth billions
---
What was the "secret truth that jagex doesn't want us to hear"? Is it somehow a secret, that there was a game that used copyrighted materials? Is it a secret that Jagex released the os servers cuz there was a demand for them? I don't get your point.
---
Wow!
---
Right. So an Ironman that doesn‚Äôt have a Fire Cape, but did go through the trouble of getting Obby Cape would be much rarer.
---
Happy Christmas to you guys, been a lot of grief about the game this year but that doesn't matter because you still make this game amazing to play and entertaining every single minute I play
---
P.S. I saw a great fan art of skill hoodie on here the other day, genuinely liked the looks of them. If there's a way to make them part of your merch or if there's somewhere to put a request in I'd love to get one!
---
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all!
---
A really cheesy one. Bow chicka wow wow and all.
---
I'm pretty late but I would definetly love one the elite void ones look really good. All the player models look good.
---
There is no rule about 1 action to 1 action, it‚Äôs just a good thing to follow.
---
The point of sandcrabs is they're agressive and afk

BUCKET full of milk :-D
---
Minimum value of an entered item is 10k on top of the other suggestion
---
Get 77 rcing mate, from then on you don't need anymore pure ess.
---
I didn‚Äôt know you made the switch on normie accounts, I only know ironman meta these days :/
---
I mean if you're internet connection is spotty (mobile) ammonite crabs r the better way to go
---
One dc and you have to re set up nmz, which sometimes isn't an option dpeneding on how afk you need to be.
---
No
---
I didn't hop was the weird thing. I just died, grabbed runes from lumbridge bank and teleported back. Stuff was gone.
---
Well yeah. To this day I've seen a grand handful of R34 images of Runescape I thought were hot. 
---
Runescape just ain't a R34 game.
---
Can someone explain how you don‚Äôt need this quest to train the skill?
---
There's an npc you can talk to to fix that
---
D
---
Btw
---
Do English people really say "Senventior Disthine Molenko"?
---
Were you skulled?
---
Dude its like 1m/hr without zenytes, they're pretty decent compared to most other monsters.
---
Imagine using redditor as an insult while on Reddit, and it‚Äôs even more sad that you feel the need to insult me over such a minor disagreement.
---
But yes, they would be high, but not by a lot. The people that use a 600m melee weapon (which makes no sense for your magic cape to help) don‚Äôt care that much about the price, because where you use it, you make a lot of the money back faster with a scythe. Blood/death runes would not increase, as no one doesn‚Äôt use a trident or barrage because it‚Äôs too expensive in PVM, they do it because mage sucks. Chaos runes are already oversupplied, so no more need to come in.
---
Why not? Tons of irons do lavas
---
Yea true that. Was just memin, honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be against this change. Fight caves only ironman, would teach me pray flicking / changing. Assuming they allowed you to somehow get ppots/food/supplies. 
---
The con of this would be by the end of it, everyone would be pros of getting fire capes and it wouldn‚Äôt be a status symbol / even somewhat impressive anymore, would be the new obsidian cape.
---
Have you tried sire post changes? It's a lot better now
---
I remember when I was a kid, when they made new stack colors (white/green instead of just yellow for everything, sometime in 2006) I thought 100m stack was blue and 1000m was purple. I was sad to learn a couple years later that it was just all green.
---
Beginner clues aren't in twisted leagues...
---
how late am i. rolling anyway
---
Can see it's the studded version in the picture...
---
One is studded leather chaps, one is regular leather chaps.
---
Thats why i only ever play ironmen. . . I cant STAND the GE. I know its got its uses, but fuck me it just takes out most of the point of playing the game. . .
---
Chicken man
---
Just don't forget it next time
---
Lmao, well that explains a lot.
---
Did you try withdrawing them?
---
Common visual bug while moving items, weird that it didn't correct itself right away, but that might be because it's not in your inventory.
---
Tell that to my account stuck on rs3
---
Time to iron up
---
First of all I never said there was a secret, only presented information most people dont know... also its not known jagex sued them most of the community thought the creator scammed over 60grand 
---
 it has information from a jagex moderator which 99% of the community never saw.
---
realistically speaking to own the lowest infernal cape record a player must hold the lowest fire cape record first
---
Op might have realized that it was an alt. The things people complain about are often the lack of game knowledge that is often apparent with bondbois. This guy has torture, prims, and I think a firecape.
---
I expect the question was asked jokingly and answered jokingly. It's the exact same response as a comment from the top post
---
Drop for efficiency. Seems like youre casual and enjoying it. Keep on playing the way you want. Have a nice evening sir
---
Nope
---
Ehhh. Warcraft is there.  Same thing
---
I approve of this meme üëç
---
the thing is i knew they were going to go up in price since jagex deleted them from NMZ, but didn't think they would go this high.
---
Maybe I want to cripple the economy. ;)
---
Hey not everyone has families to be with, theres lots of us gaming today instead :)
---
Bro the SAME thing just happened to me on RS3. They finally gave Sandstone a purpose and I had 100k that I bought at 1gp each. Sold for 500ea, made 50m.
---
They updated GE limits a week later and the price shot up to 7k a piece. Still salty about it.
---
You think so? I just did 85-90 range at brutals in max gear with DHCB and no way it's made 20m lol
---
gz how long did song of the elves take?
---
What's the drop rate on them? Ps what's the process to have a chance at them?
---
Did you get one at level 3?
---
Approximately 180-200 hours, give or take. Perfect tick would be about 167 hours.
---
Cool it with the anti semitic remarks big guy.
---
Who the fuck is nick and why is he with your mum??
---
well he is ESL and if you look into it you see that swearing and offensive words come from different parts of the brain from language for primary language speakers but not second language ones which is why ESL swear more and some times come across as more rude/offensive
---
What the fuuck
---
I mean, doing obscure things for a few 100k/hr is all well and good, but there‚Äôs a reason everyone flocks to the best PvM available to them. 
---
It‚Äôs tried and true, and minus the best methods and super rare drops in raids, most of them get done to death and are still good for 1m+/hr.
---
Hey, I'd gladly take your stuff if you don't play anymore.
---
So you‚Äôre upset that Jagex has the rights to their own game. Got it. üëçüèº
---
Woah!  Marry her!
---
makes the tutorial difficult.  
---
finally completes tutorial after 200 hours of trail and error.  
---
gets to lumbridge.  
---
"take these bronze tools"
---
V12* pretty sure that‚Äôs a 65
---
Yea i am salty af aswell haha insane how the economy works in runescape isn't it?
---
180-200 hours, perfect tick is 167 hours.
---
So anti-creation of new bots - I'm game.
---
Yes I do.
---
Drop rate is 1/300 lol. You need a bird's nest with an egg and then you offer the egg at the shrine
---
Rng manipulation
---
This subreddit never ceases to amaze me with the quality of the content, no kap
---
This was all Post-Max XP. I had 99 Agility before doing 99 RC initially though.
---
Kob strikes again üò≥
---
205m at the time of the picture. :)
---
Add it as a new restriction: Firecapeman
---
Chat icon will be a baby firecape.
---
Dismantle into scales
---
Ahh i had no idea nmz used to offer them, makes sense then.
---
It‚Äôs nuts. I suppose our time will come one day haha.
---
Didn't have warnings on?
---
There are hidden money makers or some that are known but people rarely bother trying.
---
Not long ago making some unfinished potions of low lvl herbs netted you 700 to 1m+ gp per hour with almost no requirements but the starter cash and I considered that ‚Äúhidden‚Äù since after a YouTube made a video it got ruined for a while but then it went back to being decent. There are plenty of methods similar to that one but I‚Äôm not giving away the ones that currently work.
---
Fuelling that addiction big time
---
Iron man. Lol
---
Have to do a lot of slayer to get to that point on an ironman, silly normie
---
Lmao that's me too
---
To fuck with people like OP who can‚Äôt take sarcasm
---
A year of memories!
---
no it was Kob
---
Pls friend :D
---
peta would high alch it instead
---
Lol he probably sold his supra for coin
---
C
---
imma just roll the dice. merry christmas
---
Ahh that must have been it
---
Pm me your world i'll pass on the christmas spirit!
---
If neither of you can deduce what I was saying, I feel bad for you.
---
I still have all of those to do. :&lt;
---
Where did your wife get this?
---
Thats NOT why they wont increase rc xp rstes its because the devs want to keep it prestigious instead of making it another buyable/easy skill. They have even said it themselves. Why are you making shit up?
---
I want this
---
Literally unplayable this has to be polled for an update
---
Wtf kind of map is this, that's not even where Ashdale is on RS3
---
https://runescape.wiki/images/thumb/1/10/RuneScape_Worldmap.png/1280px-RuneScape_Worldmap.png?f5d00
---
Maybe, just using amethyst broads. 89-90 made me 3m. It's 370gp.coin drop 90% of the time for me lol
---
Well, at least the drop rates on these aren‚Äôt terrible...
---
You can train on my account, ill even pay you and you can keep the crafted runes
---
Imagine believing bot detection exists lol
---
I mean the d'hide itself is pretty pricy at least.
---
‚ÄúCreative‚Äù tag. Lol‚Äôd
---
Honestly they might just not know it needs charging, although I can't recall the last time I saw someone with an uncharged one just walking around
---
It does.
---
To be honest I'd personally recommend always navigating to the official website rather than clicking email links, even genuine ones. Can't make a mistake you don't give yourself the opportunity to make.
---
He posts in socialists101 give him a break he‚Äôs a few brain cells behind.
---
He should have been wearing a santa hat .
---
Ty and merry Christmas!
---
Imagine being this dense.
---
I was kinda kidding.. kinda
---
No lol
---
I presume you maxed that fairly quickly.
---
It‚Äôs hard to resist the temptation to click drop
---
He posts in socialists101 he‚Äôs a few brain cells behind give him a breaküò¢
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone wonders why.
---
Good to hear. I was genuinely concerned after reading the title.
---
It‚Äôs too bad you never thought to play the game for fun rather than some sense of a achievement that equated to a time sink rather than any actual skill or accomplishment.
---
A true buddy thanks again!
---
Q
---
it's crazy. I havent had a phishing email in like 17 years of playing this game and I started getting them last week too. Wonder what happened.
---
50000k
---
Nice man, gratzz! How long has it been since you played on the acc that got unbanned?
---
Hey you're welcome into my clan

"Winter CC" 
---
We love to help out returning or new players in the game :)
---
Cheers and hope to see you soon!
---
Yeah, it's sad tbh

üëç
---
I used to make money by picking up the 5 chaos runes in dark warriors fortress
---
I haven‚Äôt done it for like the past 2 months but I was able to 6 hour log doing it. Not sure if they have changed it but I think it still works
---
These are the people we should be thanking for bringing bonds into the economy tho
---
Mine is Scaper613
---
Feel free to add me!
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Lol downvoted always got hating bitchs.
---
Do you offer it in the woodcutting guild? And do you get XP?
---
Yes since membership is shared between games
---
Thank you, I will take a look at that!
---
Adding! Thank you :)

Lvl 99 adorableness

Getting her addicted to osrs to guarantee no grandkids till she‚Äôs out of the house, outstanding move. Also, congrats bud

Thank you, will add you!

Here's a quote from the wiki to lead you in the right direction some more:
---
"Hugging a nearby tree around the Druid Circle will increase your tree-hugging rank. It is unknown what tree-hugging ranks were for. Hugging a certain amount of trees will give players a tree hugging title"
---
I'm assuming the drudic circle is in Burthope but I could of course be wrong :/ Also not sure if you need to WEAR the wreath/mask or just have it in the inventory slot for the option to appear. Thank you for your help mate. Means a lot, today has been rough irl. Happy Holidays to you and thanks for your kindness today. Karma will come back to you in good ways&lt;3
---
cheers m8
---
Hi it‚Äôs me a noob
---
People don't realize that communication now is a billion times better than it was when we were kids. They want to live this fantasy that there's good money makers no one knows about because it's not on YouTube or a wiki just like in the good old days. I'm sorry but the reality is that nowadays communication is so fast and simple, and content is an actual market, that it's just not true. If anyone finds a money maker better than the current ones there *are* YouTube videos for it. That might sound naive but actually saying there isn't a YouTube video is naive. Nowadays people want to discover the new "meta moneymaker" literally just so they can make the video and get a shit ton of views. There's entire discords set up for things like bug discovery all the way to money making. You better believe if there's anything meta it's not kept hidden. Because wherever there's something meta, there's fame to be had for finding it.

I like 60attack just because you're in a slightly lower bracket for BH, max AGS is 88 combat which puts you with a lot of higher zerks and voiders. Max 60att is 83combat which is more fun IMO. 
---
Not being able to use neive sucks dick though, so if you're doing a lot of slayer it might make sense to be above 85CB. I think 13def puts you at 86 CB which is also a viable choice
---
Adding!
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Damn people are really hating on you for this Kob joke. I think it's funny.
---
Ooh yeah baby ur pixels r so hot
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
How much is it now?
---
"Mom and Nick" oooof
---
Tnx Katiey
---
U have to be a noob to use a dfs for anything other than meleeing dragons so yeah they probs just don't know
---
Yes, they aren't identifying them, they are adding instanced content that kills heavily botted content on the overworld. 
---
Remember flax fields and ess mines? They were crawling with bots. Guess why they aren't anymore. 
---
Imagine how many bots sit in nightmare zone when you can hop to any world and see ~5-10 just idle.
---
Bots are still a huge problem, instances just neatly tuck the majority of them away instead of forcing players to constantly see and compete with them like at yews.
---
There are laptops with poor thermals on all brands but not every brand says long as it is silent doesnt matter if the thing melts.
---
It's Source Film Maker that's the reason the list is structured like that. Pretty much all but maybe 1-2 of those games can have models moved, altered and animated for R34 using it.
---
I have just learned today through another comment that Wrath Runecrafting is actually nutter-butters for profit. I was under the impression that double Deaths were comparable but they are literally half the GP/hr as Wraths.
---
Oh! I suppose I should've thought of checking there first lol. Thanks!
---
Can I get a death rune? Really want to die
---
at 52 con its 900k exp a hour, so i guess its closer to 12 hours for 99 con.
---
Ho.. Ho... Hop noob

where'd he get that miniature elder maul?
---
They dont know when, but itll happen eventually-

"An item showing where you placed in the League should be prestigious. Making the rewards obtainable in future leagues (or elsewhere if OSRS should Leagues stop altogether) devalues the value of a player's achievement. This is especially true given that not all Leagues will be the same (e.g. they may be area-locked, PvP focused etc)"
---
scammed all of us, bad.

BAN HAMMER

I'm willing to bet that happened literally less than two times.

I suppose you have a point.

Ban deserved IMO...

Demand the ban

My wife does.
---
That is the plan I have for both my IM and UIM, but that still requires 130k Essence, which can be quite a grind depending on your method of collection.
---
I didn't know the Grinch played OSRS.

?

Do mining

Well ya know, trolls
---
For me it‚Äôs usually forgetting to bank the pet
---
You're not creating a market for it though, if someone you know has an old leather coat or something. You're just wasting it if you throw it away.
---
Crap I‚Äôm a dumb Ironman
---
Can't even find the post anymore
---
Just got a gift! Thanks Fire
---
Lowering defensive stats does near nothing for pures anyway and if you're using protection prayers it matters even less.
---
How'd you get this?
---
Fuck off your piece of shit no one wants you
---
But it's not the same thing as walking into a store and buying said leather jacket.
---
But your post says otherwise.
---
Ruined christmas for all.
---
Sincerely, fuck you.
---
Love this! I want more!!

RNJesus

Thanks! I will probably go for the vorkath/zulrah pets or kc if I burn myself out. I can‚Äôt wait to see that untrimmed cape!

Which world is this?

he should of said "staker" "pker" or "mercher", those are the 3 go to rwt excuses.

Wow. Take my money

That's why I said pre-owned, meat is already pre-harvested as well. But whatever, I don't really care and don't want to argue about this, lol.

318, still a lot there!
---
I hope he has the right gear and stats!
---
I have a 2014 MacBook Air and I can run two clients pulling 30/50 FPS on both.
---
Yeah. Take one look at the price of Zulrah scales. They've dropped from 250ea to &lt;200ea in less than a few weeks.
---
Yea I ignored my family for 6 hours just to save a spot in the party room. All I got was damn divorcement papers...
---
How do you do neutral damage?
---
This lil Biggs bout to get PKed for his spade
---
I get where you're coming from, there's always private servers but those aren't nearly as fun as the actual game and honestly kind of suck after an hour or two of trying em.
---
Maybe a future league will have that exp multiplier too though, and you can enjoy that!
---
Thats what I was wondering too
---
How about it disables the usage of protection prayers?
---
I got the same map! Nice. :)

mods removed it.  [https://imgur.com/a/HiDwBIW](https://imgur.com/a/HiDwBIW)

Kaitey is a retard on 4chan's /osrs/. Constantly trolls and is probably mentally handicap. Torvesta dropped him in one of his videos for bank.
---
a good joke if anything who did it actually hurt? y'all chose your priories this holiday lmfao

Probably still over 100k. But that's from last season
---
Well 1st step is training the kids to make drinks for you

Women don't exist

I bought the cooling fan laptop tray. But it doesn't really help.. my laptop is probably 7+ years old now.. and isn't a "gaming" spec. Was.hoping that a new up to date one would solve. And asking for haming laptop incase I want to play other games if osrs dies :D
---
I want this is an HD desktop background
---
We have christmas the 24th so..
---
Those look cool asf
---
Like that's never been done before. Also this time the thousandth percentile majority are gold farmers. But I see Jagex's stance.
---
10,000 Zulrah Gold Farmers will get away scot free if it means that one random legit dude is ok.
---
Rip, nice play on words haha
---
Doubt
---
Makes sense, I guess I'll have to learn and figure out what the hell Twisted League is lol
---
Stabbing himself in the butt?
---
why you so mad if it's blatant basic trolling?
---
See I don‚Äôt get it. What could be the problem. I don‚Äôt understand how MacBooks 4 years older than mine can run it just fine.
---
Sweet, I should be free January 2nd and my raids teammates have been telling me to get a torso so I am interested!
---
Stand ground, white knights are on their way
---
Why are people so depressed about this? I'm having as much fun as 14 years ago

Check out MSI. My brother bought one on sale last Christmas for $900. It's a low tier gaming laptop, but for the price you can play stuff like Apex/Overwatch/Fortnite in med setting no problem. My other brother just got an ASUS this year and his was closer to $1300 on sale but is leaps and bounds better than the MSI. So just check the specs of everything on sale and make sure you've got enough to tackle med settings of most games currently out and you'll be fine. Theres a lot of options under $1000.
---
Im currently at 54 slayer i just rushed like 4 levels using cannon and blowpipe i blew through cash.  I know slayer has a nice pay off, my banks like 20m total so should i continue to rush or take my time and barely get exp an hour
---
I do not like this.
---
Absolutely, in theory. But its unrealistic to the degree that nobody can/has yet
---
Thanks again santa!!!!
---
Mine is always set to friends and most of the time they're offline. They quit like a month ago. So basically I'm offline.
---
Thanks alot pal.. I'll see if I can find them on very.com :)
---
yep
---
What's inside it?
---
This part of reach gave me absolute chills. Your entire squad has been slowly dying all game and now you know it‚Äôs your turn. Despite what the objective says, your goal isn‚Äôt to survive - it‚Äôs to buy everyone else enough time for everyone else to leave. It‚Äôs the last stand of a Spartan. 
---
Sorry I just really love this part
---
and 73 everything else...
---
This. Haha believe it or not she has my hair üòÇ best comment
---
Find a good moneymaker to blow through cash at a slower pace like I have with Thieving Master Farmers, it's probably better to blow through cash as once you get up to the higher levels you should start making it back.
---
I use it to melee bone wyverns, works super well with tank gear
---
Wheres the loot
---
just leave that shit dead, waste of time.
---
That is strange, hope you are able to figure it out and get back to scaping !
---
In a discussion about getting 99 nearly 15 times to get to 126...it kind of is.
---
Punishing RWT is the wrong issue. By punishing it severely it just means the mains can't RWT but the bots get free real estate.
---
Punishing RWT *validates* it. RWT should be a part of the system. As long as bonds are overpriced compared to the USD value of GP it's going to be a huge problem. But they can't go lower without a more direct system.
---
Botting is the actual issue that should be punished. Not players playing the game legit.
---
How much did you lose OP?
---
You don‚Äôt have to wear the suffering for the recoil refill mechanic to work.
---
That's that plan right now. I'm currently selling off the last few items I have and then I will try to rebuild with the bit of cash that gives
---
Spend time with family and friends for the holidays, and come back after New Years to rebuild. It will take time but it‚Äôs not impossible. Best of luck and hope your day/holiday season gets better!
---
I usually use runelite. I'm home for Christmas today so I was playing on mobile. I lost an obby cape, guthix top and chaps, a d spear that I got during the task, about 800 blood runes from the task and my alch pile/assorted drops. Ultimately not gamebreaking but still not a fun loss.
---
A kind redditor donated though so I don't feel the sting. Thank you again kind sir if you are reading this.
---
Man I wish my wife would do shit like this. I show her endless scape stuff and she just says something about dumb game. So gonna do stuff like this for my kids üôåüèª
---
I mean. It was ;)
---
Appreciate it thank you!!
---
about 20 mil...I know that may not be much for most, but it took me forever to get
---
Does magic attack matter when ice bursting dust devils? Like should i wear mystics or monk robes? (btw)
---
High level account is easy to make money,dun worry.
---
Just an odd bug because I was switching between my main and TO so runelite wigs out similar to the nmz herb box thing
---
Champion!
---
Holy hell your disconnect with the game is outstanding considering how hard you tried to post an educated response. Botting purely exists because RWT exists. (I‚Äôm not speaking of the kid auto clicking alchs) Wtf do you think green dragon bots are botting green dragons for? Bot farms bot materials and sell those for GP to sell for irl currency. So no, RWT shouldn‚Äôt be fucking allowed. Jesus fuck, you vote for updates.
---
wasn't a scam lmao
---
Right. Tanking has tradeoffs in offense. Who woulda thunk it. Doesn't mean it's bad to suggest learners using it. It's purpose is pretty much for learners to actually see a significant amount of the caves and practice. Once you're cape farming for pet you can use better and more optimised gear of course. Doesn't mean the best tank gear is a dumb choice or one that deserves disrespect, just as the best dps gear doesn't get disrespect for "making it easier cos you hit more"
---
Sorry to hear that. But damn if you had millions in the bank i thought you'd be aware of these phishing scams.
---
what is considered high level? I'm currently combat level
---
 76 and total level 1258
---
Only reason I don't keep mine ON is because it reveals my world. Not opposed to randoms messaging me - just can't risk getting stalked in the wild.
---
You're silly
---
Well it doubles as an elemental or mind shield so it's Gucci there
---
I was hungry and thinking about Gardettos
---
Well. 92 is just a half way to 99. So that's possible, just not efficient and expensive
---
I know you‚Äôre taking the piss but I‚Äôd love something to teach me to tick eat. Been playing 12+ years and still never mastered it lol.
---
Misunderstood his comment, thought he just wanted to max out a RoS and wear it.
---
How fucking stupid is this community. Bots exist because a fucking market exists. WHICH IS BUYING AND SELLING GP. Why the actual fuck do you think bot farms exist?
---
That's considered using a macro. Account will be banned if you do that.
---
Irons and gigapoors use them at barrows sometimes
