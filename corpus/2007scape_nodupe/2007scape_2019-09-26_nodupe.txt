Still Rc bad Slayer good

---
Good point on all of this. Maybe it's an addon or something but I have true windowed/borderless fullscreen.
---
Tbh I prefer the pre EOC Tesla’s
---
This explains why there was flour in the mill in Gwenith the first time I arrived there. I thought Jagex just decided to put some free flour there for your first viit or something.
---
Just use the font 4Head
---
Yeah but its still illegal or is it different swapping than buying gp? Don't they have waves where they ban a lot of people that rwts?
---
There should be an option to enchant it and make it follow you
---
91 agil with full graceful, usually with a little afking I ran out of run on the last trip before home tele came off cooldown.
---
Tob dead content now unless you’re a btw
---
False. I hoped worlds and it fixed if.
---
Gg homie
---
Ah gotcha. That sounds expensive.
---
A lot of fucking people on this sub need to be told this.
---
The archive site, the reason is because a few pages worth of HTML are a few megabytes at most.
---

---
The entire backend of accounts, JavaScript features, records of posts, profiles, images, etc, take up gigabytes at minimum. When a site dies a site dies, archive sites just record what was there to see. 
---
Like, you can go through every website change of Roblox since about 2007 on the waybackmachine site, but the catalog, every user made place and model and shirt or whatever isn't there. Neither are most users profiles or images, it's just too much stuff.
---
Ez just buy it from ge problem solved
---
This was enjoyable to watch
---
Not from what I've heard, but I haven't runecrafted in forever, I think it's a mobile only thing that they might end up implementing.
---
And as you're mentioning, left click bones exist, which is still a macro under your definition, not just a grey area.
---
Boaty showed that you can give individual items special shift-left click option. So he can make the pestle and mortar + herb not be dropped while holding shift.
---
So you can 3-tick fish, while dropping each fish for everyone you catch. Hold shift and it will drop fishes, but not what you've excluded from being dropped, they'll get the 'use' action.
---
And you can do thig with everything, and that's not included in vanilla.
---
So there's loads of macros from your definition in RuneLite, which should get the same treatment if you're not gonna be a hypocrite.
---
You'd still have to go though a third party software to get the clue solved for you. That argument is just as reasonable as "they can get an autoclicker from somewhere else, so lets just give them one".
---
that's why it's a "dynamic" entry swap, it's creating a entirely new option, it never highlights the bones or anything. it's like places that have "fill bucket" or " take x".
---
the thing that will get you banned using it is how specifically the osbuddy version blocks inputs which results in perfectly timed ticks which could be detected as macroing.
---
honestly if I didn't get pked constantly I would have used it for 99 prayer before they made an announcement simply because jagex didn't instantly make an announcement about it dispite it being over powered
---
If you buy GP (as in, 1 trade on 1 game where you gain money) you'll be banned.
---
If you swap GP (2 or more trades on both games where give and gain money) then you will be fine.
---
I'll have the chicken please.
---
I saw him runecrafting a few times. I only said 877-CASH-NOW though
---
Left click con and thieving are menu entry swaps. The actual action itself is 1:1. The new plugins like the altar are not 1:1, they're doing multiple actions per each action of the user, making them a form of macroing and therefore bannable.
---
Literally the most aids place right in front of even the battle palace
---
It’s just this subs stupid flair system
---
Happy birthday, in my opinion one of the coolest looking pets
---
I would, I plan on doing it right at release
---
Hahaha what?? Dont get me wrong, I use a 3rd party client too, but who the hell are you to tell someone who uses the first party client and has a preference for it, to quit?? I have plenty of opinions against the playerbase, yet I've still played this game longer than most have. Dont tell people to quit because of a opposite opinion of the masses.
---
So its illegal then but you will be fine?
---
You are not breaking any game rules if you swap money
---
84 construction is my most immediate goal. Though can you clarify, what is unlocked at 84? With max boosts (+5 stew, +3 saw) I don't see anything 92 worthwhile.. occult altar is at 90..
---
Happy Birthday :)
---
Skull tricking is an issue, that is why you can change player attack options. When I go 3 iteming in the wildy I have options completely off. The only way I can attack back is with auto retaliate, which can't skull me (outside of edge cases ik ik).
---
Some little girl that made some big dramatic crybaby speech at the UN climate summit. Very over dramatic and clearly written by her 8th grade science teacher.
---
https://youtu.be/DYqtXR8iPlE
---
Gz holy shit
---
The possibility of doing it is there, sure, but if it reduced the number of people doing it by 98% then your argument is unnecessary. You're just being pedantic about theoreticals when in reality removing 6hr afk had a huge effect on the game.
---
For a shitty analogy let's say jagex bans 1click bone on altar plugins. Well 1 ticking prayer is still possible so does that mean banning 1 click plugins had zero effect on the game?
---
No you can just look up some past job offers. They were not high above joke level.
---
None of the OSB MES gives huge exp increases, it just makes things less tedious, which makes it easier for the vast majority of people, just like earliet MES in both clients. 
---
If you are okay with all of the MES up to this point, and now all of a sudden against it because OSB did it for blackjacking, you are a hypocrite.
---
He I don't really mind having niche weapons, but it raises the issue that if the niche task/boss/etc is superceded then that item will crash anyways. They also have to contend with power creep and max levels at 99 while always giving people a new challenge so repurposing older items to be useful in a new way really isn't a terrible option.
---
Ah canvas, destroyer of grades
---
late birthday?
---
I do the same. But I’d love the opportunity to fight back with a faster, more equal playing ground than auto-retaliate because there is a delay after each time you eat, pot or click somewhere which is a huge disadvantage.
---
Not even close to botting. It is removing 1 click out of the interaction of fletching.
---
Not only was your joke bad, you would've butchered it anyway by being a dickhead
---
You used to be able to do flips like this multiple times a month or even week before people started to post about it on Reddit. I hope the karma is worth substantially decreasing your chance of ever having this happen again.
---
Back to blackjack
---
It’s not because OSB did it. Why can’t you get that through to your fucking head?
---
Not very hard to use a third party client without jagex knowing.
---
Didn’t you hear? The most thrilling PvP action is some Venezuelan bot farm getting harassed by some salad robe wearing, spec weapon switch only brainlet for their glory and monkfish.
---
Happy Cake day! Thanks
---
Rethorical question I suppose but here's an answer anyways: because it's better xp/hr than pyramid plunder
---
Nobody here can answer your other question, jagex doesn't read this thread
---
He probably has OSRS Mobile on his dash tablet
---
Yeah it's great that there's absolutely 0 risk in dying anywhere. /S
---
Are Dicing bots against the rules
---
From my understanding there are some that remove more than one click.
---
While this may make training some skills more tolerable, it does provide a big advantage over someone who is playing on the Jagex client. 
---
While the max xp that is achievable may not be better than what the intense players would be able to achieve, it does make it so less effort equals the same reward as more effort which is what is seen as unfair.
---
That's not where that meme comes from...
---
Probably plays Runescape on the road when he has it in autopilot.
---
Magic and a consistent money making skill you enjoy
---
Is it pretty common to have P2P players hanging out in popular F2P areas? I always see them doing Yews or mining near Varrock.
---
Agreed
---
[removed]
---
Congrats, enjoy the cape for another 10 hours
---
Have to? At most they'll tell them to take down those plugins.
---
it's bannable and jagex could easily track it down since you're doing something that cannot be done with one click
---
You’ve been gone too long in the midnight sea
---
Slayer weight question!
---
I'm after Cave Kraken.(707 kc - 2 tentacles no trident) 
---
Am I correct that when calculating weight I only add the tasks the my account is eligible for? 
---
Example: Duradel's 286 overall weight.  Instead I would use 195 weight, the total of tasks I'm capable of. 
---
So my Kraken weight would be:
---
Duradel - 4.6%
---
Konar - 5.05%
---
Why are you hiding the date and your hp prayer run energy etc?...
---
Wc lvls?
---
I'm kind of curious about the jmods' unofficial opinion about botting (and also security). Like if it's a lost cause, if they think it's a necessary evil, if Jagex doesnt care about mass banning because it makes their numbers look better, etc. Like... any insight would be interesting imo
---
Take this guys advice if you are boosting to raid, At 84 con you can boost to 92 and get the complete portal nexus,  plus boost for you pool will be way easier.
---
Get a anguish and a fury or torture too they will help, especially if you are going to chin you range. 
---
Get that sick looking Imbued Guthix cape too. A brimstone ring will be very useful in raids too.
---
I'm assuming it's at a school with a bull as a mascot, so I'd say no
---
Wouldn't be the first time
---
but now you get no coins
---
Yes
---
archive.org absolutely does make backups of as much stuff as possible, it's just that someone needs to tell it to make a backup because it won't do it itself. There are quite a few programs and stuff like this that you might have a hard time getting your hands on because the original site is down, and nobody made mirror links available anywhere, but you can still access the site on archive.org and they have the download archived (example, wingrep.com)
---
Sire feels like shit to do but I need that bludgeon so bad.
---
Tbh idont want jagex to buy runelite because they wont update it and add new features. look at the main client, nothing changed since they made it.
---
Man that must have been one big tree
---
Then on the first day why was the reddit flooded with posts of the login screen saying can’t connect to server titled “literally unplayable?”
---
I mean, yeah. Every bot tries to do that
---
torso won't give you any combat xp at all
---
void you can cut trees and repair barricades i think
---
It looks like you have a tail light out
---
Convience and running the game at acceptable frame rates? Wow what cheating!
---
The fremmy bois are good lads. They morso represent a culture of isolationism than ye olde barbarian pillaging villages.

Thanks!
---
Since their servers are the ones that are shit and crash, would that actually change anything? 
---
Tech savy captains?
---
Hard to say, most people don't sub on a monthly basis (cos members is cheaper if u sub 3 ,6 or 12 months) so it will take a few months for their membership to lapse before we see any change in player numbers i think.
---
imo the only thing that should be changed is dragon pick being available outside of wildy (and no, kbd doesn't count.)
---
Everything else, fair game. Revs are good money but you run the risk of getting pked. If you dont like that then there are safe money making methods outside of wildy, even if their gp/hour is lower. Chaos altar is double the exp of gilded altar at the risk of getting pked while doing it. If you don't like that then use ecto or gilded altar. Dragon pick and crystal pick you have to go into wildy, although you could say that you can just use rune pick and you would be right, but dragon axe is available outside of wildy, so why should WC have dragon and crystal tools available without stepping foot inside wildy, but mining needs you to go to wildy to upgrade past rune? It makes no sense.
---
(for sure, non-irons can just buy d pick off the G.E. and avoid going to wildy, but it's the principle of the thing.)
---
This is a real common problem idk if there is a solution though .. Do you have 2fa? If not enable it and try again
---
At what level should I start Ardy Knights for thieving?
---
On runelite i want to set up an xp tracker that starts at 0. i have my mining on the canvas but it just shows level progress. How do i do this?
---
200000
---
Nice
---
it is an online class and he demonstrated some understanding of opporthnity cost so he will pass. besides, this it is probably ops answer lmao
---
Slayer meta is almost exclusively mage (barrage tasks) to achieve ehp.
---
Most likely it will be a big announcement like when mod mark (I believe) said they are going to shut down runelite. Then they will get osb to remove those plugins and life will continue on as normal.
---
yis
---
Well yeah, there's no difference in GE on f2p world's and they get to flex
---
So this is how we destroy our planet, squabbling about who’s to blame instead of actually doing something.
---
Ever since i hit 65 wc (67) i've been wanting to try out sulliusceps since wiki recommend it from 65 to 91/99 or something like that, but i've never had the energy to learn how to do it, wc:ing teak is just so easy and afk, but i will try gather the strength this time, thanks for a detailed video!
---
Lol I was gonna go for the big shark but even the average drop rate scared me off. Hope you get some reddit luck
---
Isnt there a bank right next to the docks?

To be fair, it was a boring client before it became an old school client :P
---
They’re just going back to their roots

I dont even think the 4 dose pots sell for 1 gp each.

Because they want money. Nerds will shell out for easy scape and runelite is just a free alternative that takes their revenue.
---
gz!
---
Humidify isn't meta for mage anymore. 200m mage is exclusively done through Slayer.
---
I can get an easy 850k/hr with the botting plug lol no regrats XD
---
&gt;You *only* got 850k/hr...hueh pleb. In my sweaty chair I can get 1m/hr without your peasant cheats! BOW BEFORE YOUR GOD FOR I AM MASTER OF RUNESCAPE AND YOU ARE **NOTHING!!!!**

Its the unwarranted sweatiness that I am making fun of.

People are downvoting you and ignoring you because you're presenting Chinese holocaust as your solution to climate change. Which sort of gives away the fact that debating you would be as useful as shouting at clouds
---
Y u so angry lol, I'll let you win so you are happy ok?
---
Scientists have been warning the world about climate change for longer than that. The problem was we were looking at a lot of projections, and not at actual data.

We absolutely know the earth is warming now. We didn’t in the 70s.

You dont actually leave it in the dk room, you just use it to open the gate at the very beginning of waterbirth, so it's only keeping company to the regular dags there.

If you encourage and allow this type of shit the whole place gets filled with random pictures with retarded pity farming titles ala /r/gaming.  This is why this site is cancer.  Nobody cares about your kid, relative, wife, or whatever the fuck.

If I had to guess it probably came from the characters in wow looking 'toony' because of the art style wow uses.

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Finding_the_wikis_with_ease just add the wiki as a search engine, way easier. Just have to type "osrs" then whatever you're looking up to go straight to the relevant page
---
I have recently come back to OSRS after a long break, I am just wondering, why has sanguinesti crashed so much? I remember it being steady at 300m+ before I left
---
You’re just saying this because overpowered plugins. There are plenty of QOL plugins and just little things here and there that make the game more enjoyable.
---
Not particularly.

Depends on the coin, but a couple of mine do have my name, yeah.

I mean it's not terrible, it's basically just a mobile idle game.  Still, you're not wrong.  It's a daily chore that just takes a bunch of time to finally get like 2 useful things.
---
How about you suggest jagex into making a better client then maybe people will agree with you then.
---
You serious?
---
Maybe its because im 91 defence and dont have an ely but I'm still getting my ass kicked in the 60s
---
What is so damaged within yourself that you feel the need to share this information?
---
Stupid idiot
---
Sure. And the space in this bank is very limited. As in all OSRS banks, actually.
---
A recent update allowed to store Flippers and Mudskipper hat at home, in the Magic wardrobe. I just wanted to put away the whole set for diving  (preferably not as a set but as separate things - fortunately it is usually done like that with recent additions).
---
Nice.
---
Bout to hit 69 mil total xp. I'm a god
---
I had that happen, so I left and came back with my cannon and set up it next to them. I was salty that day so I was feeling petty. Dude logged about a min later.
---
Bruuuuh I was there. Rsn: Gehbrial hit me up dawg
---
Seems like they are just fed up with mtx. There are so many posts under the flair with topics such as, economy, armors, addiction, alleged dishonest J Mods . And the list goes on.
---
Those are the ones that make the most profit. The problem is, yield is influenced by your farming level. So if you have a low farming level, you won’t average too many herbs per seed which will make you lose money with Ranarr and snapdragon since they are expensive. So you probably should plant toadflax or avantoe (I think toadflax is better), and once you hit 70/80 farming switch to Ranarr. Also, get the magic secateurs to use increase yield. 
---
And please do consider making hops runs. Yanillian seed costs like 4gp and a yanillian hop goes for nearly 1k each! I usually get something like 20k profit per patch. There are 4 patches and they grow super fast. It’s just great money. 
---
Finally, Varrock diaries are great easy money as well. Once a day, claim staves from zaff and sell them in ge (normal diaries makes you 35k a day, hard 70k a day, elite 140k a day)
---
Most MMO's i've played have had customizable HUDs and allowed plug-ins and things like DPS calculators.
---
I don't see a problem with most of the things these clients do. 
---
The only ones that are arguable are the ones which affect the game itself, such as menu entry swapper, and the overpowered OSB plugins. And even Menu entry swapping is already part of the game and should be something we are allowed to do.
---
I’m sorry I meant to say endorsed. Osbuddy is the only client that’s endorsed by Jagex. My bad.
---
Fucked up success rates though. End game POP, failing on 90% voyages and succeeding on 20% ones.
---
Go be a little alt-right fuckhead somewhere else, kid.

I'm just sick of seeing and hearing about her at this point. Climate change is an important issue, but it's annoying that the cheerleader is some random highschool kid. The media picks up on her because it sells.

You sound like a fucking cultist.
---
Started playing the day after al Karid was added to the game, I still remember when the Swiftkit client was released. Clients have been part of RuneScape way longer then you would believe.
---
I understand the situation and I don’t disagree. Its funny that most people agree she shouldn’t be there, either because she should be in school or because they think someone more authoritative on the issue should speak. 
---
I think people should stop getting upset that people have a different opinions on the position of children in political discussion, this has caused more issues in the camp of people who believe than the climate deniers, which can really only lead to people being more complacent
---
Looks like a private server ad
---
I guess I could have used the word finished instead of completed because I am finished with Cerberus and won’t ever need to go back

Everything else is your grit and decision making

why should it be wrong?

lol well if saying the n word is a point of pride for you then by all means, continue to say it
---
Lol kid that’s not what it means
---
Go to that site, screens look exactly like runescape
---
Yea it is hard to tell when that's happening. But things like boss spawn timers, raid layouts, ect. Those are genuine advantages over other players and it isn't just a overlay.
---
Leave it to reddit to be completely clueless about pking. BCP has +4 str, Torso has +4 str. Defensive bonsus do not matter that much. There's literally no reason to use BCP over Torso aside from slightly tankier melee stats.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And Tassets are popular in high risk pking. It's literally the best-in-slot for legs &amp; given as a drop in LMS. Saying nobody uses Tassets for pking is really amusing.
---
I've never done raids, but boss spawn timers are pretty much just overlays.
---
Oh damn no way I'll be up then and ready for work. Hope you do it though. I'll have to do it later.
---
Even if you are legitimately doubling money, what you are doing is bad because it teaches noobs that money doubling is legit. 98.789% of the time it's a scam, and some f2p is going to lose their bank because of you.
---
Lol why would you get a scythe for it first
---
:) see ya there
---
It’s a private server of the game but different
---
Not banning them would set the precedent that it is ok and lead to more bots which would kill the game much faster.
---
Extortion lmao I was just trolling you can definitely have it I’m tired of getting @ed. How can I give it to you though?
---
I started smithing addy darts when Classic was released. It isn't even remotely efficient, but I've already climbed up to 97. I think I'll do blood RC after smithing, maybe even fly fishing if its AFK enough.

I had no idea of the time releases come out so I will have to do it later. :(
---
This is in Merrillville. There's Centier headquarters.
---
It would be a Purdue kid lol
---
This happens because the right click box is now not able to go passed the bottom of the screen instead of the top, it should be an easy fix for them to just change the limiting edge of the screen... But still no fix...
---
Private server
---
Well, thats what I am saying, I think the ones that directly influence game inputs are too far. Switching talk to bank is fine in my book, but things like 1 click pray, 1 click con, 1 click log light, 1 click blackjack, etc are prolly too much. It also seems others agree with this, seeing as this all got huge when OSBuddy released those features.
---
That promo also dumped 14b gp into the game as well from 3 people alone. And before that it was one of the strongest xp promo's they've ever ran, basically a stronger version of an already insane xp promo. There are many straws on that camels back

I like how you gloss over the fact the plugins create 1:1 actions which in itself negates your point

No idea what the real spawn rate is but in about 1800 hours of play time I’ve seen maybe 10-15, only 2 luckies

People are taking this way too seriously. Gz

That sub has had an mtx tag for ages.

Good point, but you still have to bank every so often to get more food.  When I'm lazy I just chop teaks while watching netflix on my iPad, running to banks makes it feel a ton less afk than teaks.

those don't stack with the ardy 3 diary
---
I would personally prefer not taking slaves in quests, or at least to avoid using that term. Like yeah it is a fantasy game, but that is bad on a number of levels (ethics, optics, etc.). Sure, slavery was different in the kind of period reflected in the game, but it is hard to disconnect the concept today from resonating with American chattel slavery, the child slave labor that happens a lot in some African and Asian nations, and current international rings of labor and sex slavery. Also, the slave who is captured and then aids their slavers also reminds me too much of the American “old south” myths that portray slaves as happy helpers to mostly-kind and benevolent owners (which many people still but into). 
---
I am okay with quests where people are rescued from slave camps, labor camps, or the like, but not ones where slaves are captured (even if the slave is one’s character) and then joins forces with their captors. While this may be too “pc” of a take for some players, I know it would needlessly rub a lot of people the wrong way.

&gt; When was the last time you've actually seen someone use proper grammar in OSRS? lol it's a game, idk why your standards are so high.
---
ftfy
---
Hopefully everyone.
---
Banking is about 10 seconds, restart lap, mushtree to Meadow, deposit in fossil box and return to Swamp.
---
Yes, it's a bit more rare but happens
---
I was too, but at this point, when OSB is pushing it, i think it's safe. If they start to punish people for this, too many would be affected and the outrage would be too much. Abuse while you can. I'm prolly getting 85 construction today
---
8 sara brews and 1 antidote++ last a good while.
---
Since when are we ever given an option to decide where PvM content is?  I don’t remember theatre of blood being polled with an option to be outside of Morytania.
---
The wilderness is a place in OSRS like any other, and just like any other it has it’s PvM content too.
---
Stats?
---
bump
---
Only good answer
---
Train fletching and herblore to max it already
---
Inefficient nigga
---
I see how many bone bolts you have. Say goodbye to your account
---
Resources: *exists*
---
Bots: don't mind if I fucking do
---
What I see is one person raising a valid point and you accusing him of being upset.
---
"look at that boot" -moryman
---
What? Why would I tele to ardy to get to a tool leprechaun if I'm right next to it? This discussion is about storing items into a tool lep that you're wielding. How is discussing routes to get to the tool leprechaun relevant at all?
---
I'm saying their suggestion of keeping secateurs in the bank isn't a very satisfying solution for people short on bank space.
---
Obby is the lazy and more efficient way (before 92HP). You don't lose DPS if you only check in every 10 min, while that would be rough on your DH experience. Not to mention it's free to use.
---
&gt; 3:1 Script? Theres going to be bans for sure
---
You're acting like 3:1 scripts haven't existed for years in RuneLite, too, and yet there have been zero bans. 
---
1 click leprechaun, skillcapes, bankers, pickpocket targets (before Jagex added attack option modifiers), etc. 
---
There aren't going to be any bans.
---
/r/2007scape desperately wants their to be. But their won't be. Jagex has made it very clear that they won't do a mass ban of their userbase for something like this without first clarifying.
---
Gg
---
Dope quest
---
Lock more BIS items/bosses  behind quests
---
You made a throwaway to confess you macro on..
---
adorable.
---
Even gave us all his RSN via his reddit flair :)
---
I'd order the questcape one immediately
---
cheeto coffi chimmkn
---
No kidding.
---
I know it's only one extra right click every time, but I can't think of another game where such an integral action that almost everyone wants to do **every** time they want to interact with an NPC is locked behind multiple clicks.
---
Imagine hating on classic Volgas
---
Not like the teacher is gonna look up the drop rates of items on an online game to fact check him as long as he understands the concept tbh
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
To scam fools out of their allowance-fueled bond munni presumably
---
Although I agree there are some plugins which are on the boundary’s with what’s acceptable and not, “1 click leprechaun, skillcapes, bankers, pickpocket targets “ they are just menu swappers and arnt the same as, 
---
1. Use bone 
---
2. Move mouse.
---
3. Use Bones on Altar.
---
&gt;know what you are doing
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=DifferentImpartialStapleChocolateRain
---
Yeah. Just 72 mining, 71 wc and 75 magic. These are the highest and out of these mining and wc can be boosted.
---
And this is why it's kind of ok to have bots. Sadly. 
---
The prices of these type of items will go up in price over time if bots didn't exist
---
No idea, this sub is weird at times
---
It is one to one though.
---
A knocked down thug is classified as a different object than a normal standing thug (can check this with RL dev tools).
---
1 click blackjacking just makes 'knock out' left click for the normal thug, and makes 'pickpocket' left click for the knocked thug. 
---
Its the same as any menu entry swap.
---
Stakeholder is an extremely broad term that refers to almost *anyone* a company's operations affects. This includes not only shareholders, but also employees, customers, suppliers, and even groups like local communities where a company operates.
---
It’s absolutely incredible, for all the master+ level quests that have been added since OSRS came out there are massive unlock lists.
---
Just look at monkey madness 2, a quest you could (in theory) do at 50/60 range and 70 crafting, 60 hunter, 60 agility, etc. Unlocks probably the best demi-boss/regular monster to kill in the entire game, new BiS jewelry, new PvP weapons, and a boat load of other stuff.
---
While I was doing MM2 I felt like it wasn’t going to be worth it at all, but 250kc and 30M at demonics later and I’m glad as hell I chose to do it.
---
Glough’s still a total bitch though, like fuck that fight. Little did I know you can actually just melee him with a whip.
---
I always thought LFM meant Looking For More, normally because I see it in like "LF3M", so looking for 3 more
---
Yeah that's one thing I was thinking about too. I have some extra inv spaces anyways so I could try with crystal bow or something.
---
Lmao quit being so salty you neckbeard
---
And barrows armour pieces and set effects have tons of arguably somewhat niche applications
---
Could you maybe hide the task bar?
---
Gone from 88-93 myself, if I get banned I'll be surprised at the sheer balls of jamflex
---
Damn good luck. You gonna keep going ?
---
Botting in rs3 is way harder because of the different engines mainly and there isn't as much of a market for it
---
I'll tank for you!
---
If go to your taskbar settings you can select 'automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode'. Like it says, it automatically hides teh task bar normally and pops it back up if you move you mouse to the bottom of the screen.
---
Idk why they gave to give stat hammer the same spec, just make it hit the same as rn and propose a different side effect
---
Lol hey, syllabic?
---
Go kill zulrah and make bank
---
Only for multi or if you cba to flick. I always opt for strength bonus and lazy flick if it's a singles combat task
---
Imagine loving cock in your ass.
---
Jagex never has been nor ever will be a "good company"
---
I say this knowing that OSRS is my favorite game of all time
---
I appreciate the oldschool devs, beyond that the rest of the company is shite.
---
Just bring ancestrals, armadyl and justiciars if your bank is limitless. You can get 1 freeze off on the nibblers, then quickly change to justiciars for that extra defence. Shouldn’t risk a lot of splashes that way.
---
GIMP!!
---
Lol I got bgloves before torso, before d scim, before Neitz and even before amulet of power. 
---
Just like to quest a lot and still need 60 attack and 55 defence.
---
Good points
---
This is a pathetic opinion
---
You make 500k gp/hr but that could easily be 1m/hr if it were a rune dragon alt (which you could 100% have by 77 RC).
---
Just lazy flick unless it's a multi target task. I never use pray pots for things like fire giants or black demons
---
Git gud
---
He got 2m for his bandos set
---
Y'ou're'st'd've
---
Trust me if you would’ve seen the proof they showed me.. I don’t fall for this usually don’t think I’m some idiot. I figured well they had 190m whats another 30 to possibly get in on some lures. But point of the post is to not fall for scams even if you aren’t in the wild
---
He got 2,147 platinum tokens which can be exchanged with any banker for 1,000 gp each, so he got 2.147m for his items worth 50m or so (Idk to the price for sure, but it’s in the ballpark of 50m)
---
saw one the other day grabbing fishing nets in the swamp near lumbrige. and I was on a newish character on a pvp world too, so it was fun stopping him from accomplishing anything till i overleveled.
---
Is it capped? You should be getting way more
---
Iirc you can outdamage 2 healers with just 75 range, bp with dragon darts, eagle eye, and range pot
---
But I like hunting :'(
---
learn how to 1tick alternate, it makes handling blobs significantly easier.
---
I mean, inferno was balanced around the tbow.
---
Parliament, some youtubers, some reporters and what not all are covering a story about how someone spent like $60k/yr on TH as it promotes gambling.
---
RS3 community is taking this story and running it to Jagex full speed in order to try to get some sort of reform of TH, as it's only getting stronger and more toxic each month while the playerbase is losing players monthly, hitting all time lows.
---
On top of that you have 🦀 Jmods who refuse to comment 🦀 you have Q&amp;A's being dodged because "Jmods who could answer the questions suddenly couldn't make it! 🦀" or just flat out canceled like last week's without being postponed.
---
The game hasn't had an "update" in 11 weeks, as it's all patch notes that end up breaking the game more than improving it. IE deadclicks, game breaking bugs, so on so forth. All questons about the lack of updates lead to "sorry we messed up" or "wait for runefest!" however, they already revealed that RS3 will be getting a new skill announced @ Runefest to try to ease the anti-MTX crowd as a form of misdirection.
---
They're also just dumping pre end-game items onto TH now. They recently added Virtus to TH, stats in tact, the only "downside" is that it can't be traded or augmented. It's still free virtus gear that heavily affected the market. The same promotion also spawned in billions worth of GP since you could mass alt it. And this is all right after adding in a brand new promotion that was one of the strongest in terms of xp:spin.
---
What?? We were in 1st!! Damn you Samsung
---
I'm talking new content here. And I'm not just talking about leveling thieving to 99 and forget about it.
---
Use more unnecessary words to make yourself sound like an intellectual please. It gets me really turned on.
---
Or make a more afk training method that is around half the xp/hr but cost exactly the same. Saves your hand without removing a valuable gold sink.
---
&gt; Dude I think you vastly overestimate how many of those people are just going to leave the game and never come back if that actually happened
---
&gt; 
---
I don't think I am. Getting banned is a big deal to most players. 
---
&gt; Like if you’re using osbuddy then you’re likely more than just a casual player, so I think it’s more likely they’d just make a new account or move to an alt
---
Most casual players will only have one account for all their progress... And when that account gets banned, they will quit. They are *casual* players, they won't want to redo entire grinds over again. 
---
I highly doubt most casual players have an alt.
---
Seeing as he had just logged on from his chat log, it’s hard to believe that this happened.  
---
No messages from someone saying they wanted to buy his armor, no trade requests,  and being logged in for only a minute seems fishy.
---
Might be some monster with invurnabilty
---
Endgame content with endgame gear :o
---
More like 45.3m, idiot. God, get it right noob.
---
I was a big fan of guthans myself, but it is worth the switch to a sgs in the long run. Inv space is saved making for longer trips, and while you don't heal consistently you essentially get unlimited prayer if you flick giving you tons of fuck up room to just spec for more prayer. 
---
When I do miss a special attack I need I'll have to prayer flick melee for a bit until i get that next special attack, or that next food drop. It can be annoying sometimes but sometimes the things you enjoy annoy you a little.
---
You can get chaotics from TH cant you?
---
I was making an analogy of a parent-child upbringing to support why osrs isn’t able to keep its integrity intact, to win respect of some actually loyal consumers
---
Could be different time zone
---
Feels like everyone recommends sweating out 99fm not a very fun start
---
Iknow you dont have to, but it just seems too good to pass up on, Until WT fixes how its better to be low hp atleast
---
Pretty sure there is a setting to get the client to expand to fit the window ,?
---
Sorry mister king of runescape
---
try amulet of glory
---
Don’t sleep on fashionscape.
---
A minigame like zolcano or wondertwat? How would you adjust that to balance out the intention of it being a price sink? If it added value we'd be going in the opposite direction. If it didn't rewards would feel meh.
---
Thoughts?
---
Really hope they don’t ban them... runelite is so bloody useful
---
69 - Sex number
---
420 - Weed number
---
My plan is to finish the quest as soon as I get home from work this morning and start farming the knights (hopefully on task) for some jaw pieces before the prices go down on them.
---
So you're saying the promise to poll updates should be thrown aside (the one thing that's managed to keep jagex somewhat in check) so we get immediate updates which might not even fix the issue and put us in a potentially worse situation?
---
No thanks.
---
learning zuk/jads
---
I mean couldn’t you hop worlds and walk yourself to the spot where your items were dropped and try picking them back up? Not sure just a thought.
---
U still wanna use serp in tob to poison and for pois resist. New helm doesn't add a Max in max
---
Are you a cop?
---
Oohhh my godddd keep going
---
Why did u drop when u clearly know what they were doing?  
---
At least bring telegrab spells?
---
I know that runelite locks the full screen size to the original monitor you opened it on.. but seeing as you're on a laptop I'm not sure that applies here
---
Yeah someone else said that, I assume that would work but in the moment I panicked heavily ... lol
---
Don’t they despawn for you if you leave the world? I thought that if something was on the floor prior to you joining that world, you won’t see it. Unless that’s logging out and not hopping.
---
Read into context, Brother.
---
I did not assume to throw updates aside. The context was, this situation would not have been blown out of proportion when small problems are rectified first without compromising the natural flow of updates.
---
I thought they said the jaw wasn’t tradable? Could very well be wrong though.
---
I believe all mmos are inharently born to a death sentence. I don't think we are at that point we've still got a healthly player base, and hype for new things to keep it going for much longer.
---
I just dont think anyone can play the same game for generations. And if you do, it's going to be almost open sourced and community ran. Things like garys mod, or minecraft where you can make your own servers are the things that  generally live on much because they're more tools then they are games. So if you don't like the games aviable today, you can go make one in a video game where the interfaces are essentially like using an API. 
---
I really believe that runescape can be timeless. We just need a client that lets us host servers, from any update that they have backed up. You could still have to pay membership for it, but it solves a lot of the private server issues, and also gives runescape a place to live on once osrs eventually reaches its death.
---
His house costs at least 30m, 10m for the occult altar 5m for the portal nexus and at least 15m to get to 83 construction. Also  2 pools is close to 5m so about 35m at least
---
wait.... are u saying dropped items persist even if u hop worlds?  
---
So if i died in one world i can hop and retrieve my items from another world?
---
I can confirm if I did take the time to do this your information would be 100% secure, 
---
If this post gets abit more of a response, I will considering giving it a shot, will post results soon if I can get some nice and crisp/relevant icons on the way, if anyone wants to take the reigns and do it themselves feel free as I am definitely no master in quality without taking a lot of time to work on this, keep well everyone, happy pking！
---
Nah they don’t thats for sure. Things disappear after leaving an instance like Vorkath layer for example but normally there is a timer.
---
I think it is really telling that you keep comparing this to left click banking instead of the dozens of other menu swaps that exist that DO have an impact on the game.
---
What the fuck is that overlay
---
Idea: a Construction guild (lvl 50) with an NPC contractor that sends you across RuneScape to repair buildings for XP. The more high-level areas you unlock, the higher your xp/h rates.
---
We could even throw in a chance to receive a generous tip from a customer, in the form of a unique that aids in Construction (training) or a flatpack of sick ass furniture for our own POH.
---
It could be but the people implementing them don’t take the absolute piss and if they ever do something that makes jagex go “no we don’t like that”, they remove it.
---
f quest cape
---
Can confirm - got my first Jad kill on task.
---
Yeah I’ve just been lazy and putting off doing hosidius house favor.
---
Now we all know for the next time you feel like dropping 190m on the ground for a laugh.
---
Without 1:1 abuse you can easily get 330k exp an hour. The skill doesn't need to change, the players just need to stop being bitches.
---
Well... That explains: down there it's all upside down!
---
But here I notice from experience that managers all try to "make a name" and start big megalomaniac projects, which next manager closes down with some losses. And losses are taken from the salary of hte employed or higher prices.
---
And like I said: it's impossible for competitors to stand up due to either too high initial opportunity costs, or due to physical impossibility to create a competitor. (limited space).
---
The other idea "customers can just move" also doesn't count: in australia I could indeed find some things cheaper, but social coherence makes free migration impossible. Yet companies can move almost freely, thus creating also a "monopoly", or "unfair treatment". This is often tried to get offset by adding import taxes etc, but those are just a political playground of the managers.. 
---
We're now also leaving capitalism.
---
So all in all I think capitalism is a flawed idea in our *future* world which is not defined by opportunity, but by scarcity: and then true, physical, scarcity... Where you have to live cradle to cradle or otherwise society will not survive. Where things like breathable air become a scarce resource...
---
For such a society capitalism isn't working and we should really start moving away from capitalism, since sooner rather than later our world is defined by that.
---
blowpipe. no point to use scales in serp
---
You just run past them and they stop hitting you once you reach the mushroom
---
&lt;3
---
Copy and paste for the boyos and lasses at work?
---
Also I think the P2W aspect would be minimal, being that those who spend mad amount of irl money on bonds that do not have the experience, will likely fall to the end game players that you think would be likely to quit.  I think instead, they'll be likely to hunt down the P2W players who are going after the new newb players who are trying to earn quick gold for a bond so they can enjoy membership in OSRS/RS3.  I think it'd draw in players if it was the meta-server for obtaining bonds.
---
Not included  is roughly 2.5mil in items/gp that was traded directly to me.
---
&gt;People are willing to cheat, therefore the skill is not enjoyable and should be changed.
---
I don't agree with this premise. People will cheat to get an advantage over other players. There are cheat client plug-ins for ToB and Zulrah, is this evidence the content is unenjoyable and should be changed, or are people just trying to get an advantage?
---
&gt;Construction is expensive
---
Yes, that's the nature of the skill. Construction functions as a gold sink and your reward for putting the cash into it are some of the strongest untradeable perks you can have. Letting people being able to train Con for free at non-negligible XP rates undermines this. 
---
&gt;My hand cramps, there's no entertainment value, I don't enjoy it.
---
I have a problem with this line of thinking. I don't think everything really good in a game should be enjoyable, easy and AFK, maybe I'm just a masochist, but I think a Fighter Torso, Elite Void and a maxed house would lose a lot of their meaning and accomplishment for the player if there was a painless alternative. Also, if you're doing Mahog Tables, it's a skill you can max in under 15 hours, less than 3 if you're just going for 83. Just suck it up.
---
&gt;Enormous grind on an Ironman.
---
Heaven forbid this happens. I thought this was a game mode where you play with restrictions?

The Fremennik Exiles
---
26 September 2019
---
“Exile, you must leave our province. Our people will no longer see you as their brother...”
---
~ Brundt the Chieftain
---
The Fremennik bards often sing tales of the past. Of great battles, deadly foes and heroes long gone. However, in recent years, things have been much quieter in the Province, as there’s increasingly less to sing about. All that is about to change though, as what starts off as a simple investigation soon leads to one of the greatest threats the Fremennik have ever seen.
---
The next instalment in the Fremennik questline is here! Every feature in the poll blog passed, so you can expect to see all of them in-game! If you haven't read the blog yet, make sure to check it out for some words from Mod Wolf and Mod Ed who wrote and developed the quest.
---
To begin the quest, speak to Brundt the Chieftain in Rellekka . Make sure you meet the following requirements:
---
Quest Requirements
---
Skill Requirements
---
Rewards
---
Do you have what it takes to save Rellekka from the basilisks?
---
Basilisk Slayer Tasks
---
Two new unlocks can be found in the Slayer Points Reward Shop (these doesn't require quest completion):
---
Basilocked (80 points) - unlocks basilisk tasks for Konar, Duradel and Nieve/Steve.
---
Basilonger (100 points) - extends basilisk tasks from all Slayer masters.

Cost too much to make and not many would be sold
---
Rudy pants
---
Or just make it 2-3 times the gold.. I think for construction that fits perfectly, make something less click intensive, same xp "rate" but multiple times the gold.
---
"good" - neet neckbeards
---
Why would you do Brimhaven agility for marks; without tickets it’s significantly less xp than any other alternative and would have to be less marks per hour too for the balancing of earning diary rewards and higher level agility courses. Because tickets are guaranteed and can be collected at any level you can do it.
---
It would be a waste of dev time and no one would use it.
---
Your friend lied, that's ~1m an hour
---
wtf is that helmet!
---
&gt;Android devices now have dynamic notch recognition to allow for better use of the available playing screen.
---
This is a nice one, looking forward to see this!
---
It's open source. They don't need to buy it, buy the devs, etc. It's all right there available to anyone to use.
---
You can make the same argument as to why you should do the inferno with an armadyl crossbow instead of a tbow

I'm working on an on the job only Brutal Black Dragons loot tab at the moment, up to 63M so far.

Oh no why would you open all the chests with your stats

I think you wear it on your head
---
So that is the helmet mod wolf has been working on for the past 2 years? LOL
---
Oh, u want to p2w? I guess it would work for a while until every other players get fed up and quit and it'll probably be worse than it is now.
---
People solo wt for con xp on ultimates.

But we are also getting a new seasonal thing. I dunno maybe pdmm has its own place now

I don't see how secateurs make sense on celastrus but it's a weird one
---
Firsttt
---
The hunter one is the best cos it’s just a cool hoodie to a normie but a player would see it and we could grab each others dicks.
---
I agree with the sentiment but I don't think your idea takes human nature into account enough. To have a stable human system it has to be rooted as deep as human instinct is, and instinct is a very finicky and dangerous thing.
---
At 1440p, the game is rendering 2-3 times more pixels than it was intended to. You wouldn't think this is a problem, because the specs back then were something ridiculous like 64mb ram, 300MHz. Our processors are literally 10 times more powerful these days (before you even consider multi-core), but the old code isn't written to get that performance out of it.

Would you please tell us lowly virgins more about your experience with intercourse?

---
Because a majority of the gold goes to other players, rather than being sequestered. The only gold sink is what goes to your butler.
---
Someone apparently made 14 bil profit from abusing some promotion they had. He created over 8,000 alt accounts.
---
Another example that comes to mind is the birdhouse and even crop timers. If I'm killing time waiting for the next birdhouse run to start as soon as I see 'complete' I know it'll be 5 more minutes.
---
You're dense
---
I'm fairly sure jagex can see everything, it's just a case of their system recognising what is good and what is bad.
---
These gentlemen's agreements as you call them seem to me to be more about jagex avoiding banning the use of 3rd party clients outright much like they did with mousekeys.
---
It's a straight up mistake to trust people like the developers of osbuddy as they clearly do not have the interest of players at heart.
---
Jfc you're stupid. NO ONE was able to keep their stats.
---
Yeah, or just wait, let the sweaty nerds figure it out in a day and there will be a guide out. Plus won't have to be extorted of gp for necessary quest items if you wait like a week.
---
I don’t use any 3rd party clients.
---
I totally agree. If you can deposit equipped items to the bank, you can do it on the leprechaun screen. If that isn't the case then they have some seriously bad spaghetti code going on
---
&gt;Get that sick looking Imbued Guthix cape too. A brimstone ring will be very useful in raids too.
---
I see what you did there XD
---
What darts do you use with BP when vork is low HP?
---
Stonks
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
Good point. There are also thousands of gold farmers and buyers. We should just give out gp for free so people don't have to cheat.
---
Trading other players gold for logs doesn't remove gold from the game, it just shuffles it around. The only real gold sink would be paying your Butler and I guess phials if you use him for cons instead.
---
Its ingame music, but not in the song list, its a special track that plays only in wheat fields with the crop circle i believe
---
Can you please look into “too many login attempts” errors? I couldn’t login at all yesterday. Some people are also experiencing the same issues. Thank you.
---
nice
---
In pvp what’s the point of your account being range based or melee based? See this phrasing about and not sure what it means. Cheers
---
Not compared to Ahrims though
---
Sure thing, check out /u/FourRS 's profile. Apparently he got bored of Zulrah bots in the past couple weeks.
---
Fighting the monster is a waste. Just bring food, antipoison and run laps.
---
ty my man
---
honest question, why would you ever buy one of those, let alone continue to use it?
---
Imagine complaining about a skill that’s over 800K xph and offers some of the best rewards in the game
---
Used to live in Indiana, when I graduated I ran like hell.
---
You poor fools.
---
For reference I'm Kiwi (New Zealander).
---
Apologies if trash post, 2nd ever post so be gentle. 
---
A "sheep enthusiast" as Jagex puts it or "Sheep Shagger" in New Zealand seems to be the only opinion of us on the internet. But it was only one time at a party both the sheep and I were drunk so doesnt count 🦀🦀🦀
---
I was checking out the new update when it came out and just decided to host for a bit and see what happened. House was in rellekka already. 
---
Mostly people doing vork/DKs/slayer use it. Sometimes people doing clues.
---
Yikes. What's the damages?
---
Case sensitive doesn't make much of a difference tbf
---
What? You're already paying $132/yr plus all the people that buy bonds for gp. Who in the hell is willing to pay $264/yr for osrs... Games like rust are $30, arma $60, Dota free but you want to double membership?
---
I was hoping they'd have some kind of involved mechanics like the ones shown off by the jormungand fight. Shame they didn't have the look away or stone prison mechanics.
---
so your suggestion is for a very easy to afk slayer monster, that already drops the BIS melee helm, is to give it even more BIS content?
---
Crowder needs to quit being a coward and debate sam seder
---
I do like something more relaxing like vorkath though, I really dislike having to constantly switch multiple items when fighting a monster. And worse is when you have to count in your head instead of seeing a visual clue and \*then\* acting on it.
---
(It's why I hate zulrah so much, I'd much much (and many times over) rather prefer that zulrah would have random phases/rotations (with exception of maybe jad phase that always happens the nth phase) - however each phase has some "boot up" time when she pops up giving a color indication of where to stand and what to pray, like 1.8 seconds "more" than now, some time between she starts attacking and popping up.
---
Agree, if people are willing to cheat on csgo with wall-hacks then we need to remove the walls.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
So not even left click one bone (use) &gt;then&gt; left click on altar? 
---
I'm fine with the single menu swap for left click to be use, no body really burys bones any more anyways. I'm the guy who waits for the the full inventory anyways to be used, instead of speed clicking through but to each his own. But I can definitely see where simply left clicking altar is a questionable script/feature.
---
Stack
---
It's okay when I do it syndrome
---
"Yeah, i'm taking off 2 clicks but i'm still clicking myself"
---
Looks like a reusable birth control tactic
---
A lot of them could be doing the quest for the new BiS helm
---
We need that "1 click" RC L0L
---
He has not provided evidence to prove that my claim was baseless other than claims about my claims being baseless.
---
You need evidence to refute what someone says, not to make a claim.
---
If I got shot in the woods on my way home from work, and came into the hospital with what appeared to the staff to be a bullet shot wound; they would still treat me, and they would still ask me to file a police report.
---
While, in reality, it could have been any number of things that happened to me.
---
The way people approach discussion now is super backwards. My account of what happened is my evidence, if that isn’t enough for someone else, I am asserting the onus is on the individual to learn about the situation for themselves. Because, honestly, their policy is adapting all the time, and what happened then very well may not be consistent with how they would react now.
---
Saying someone sounds retarded doesn’t make you sound any less retarded or inept.
---
I honestly don't know how you play the game if construction makes your hand cramp. Doing oak doors is literally some of the least click intensive skilling in the game aside from the gathering ones without manipulation. You don't even have to move your mouse, literally just left click.
---
It cost 1500 gp to make a mahogany plank, 70^ of that with plank make on lunars. That gold is removed from the game. Construction is literally designed to be a gold sink. Also gold leafs etc. are bought from shops, removing gold.
---
No one would use a minus strength item, while torso is free and obby legs are so cheap
---
It was close enough to be honest, just the phrasing was abnormal
---
*Just* over 1/4 of the way there, less if you use boosts and stop at 83 like most people do.
---
Lol this is what happens when Jed and Reach come in and fuck things up
---
Yet dream mentor isn't grandmaster is it? - I haven't completed the quest but to me a grandmaster really sounds like "amazing making something you'll remember doing"; can be a boss, story or puzzle (like light puzzle in sote).
---
Again I don't have an opinion, yet but 20 minutes sounds quite short... Also if it's possible without specialized gear or time to think to solve the puzzles.
---
We’re the beta testers
---
In their eyes, they have let go of this responsibility. If they are honest to themselves, they would just patch small holes while it is still possible in their integrity, now the holes have gotten too big and they’re struggling to take control of the situation
---
Mellow quest! New caves are nice and drops are unique. Nicely done! Even if it felt a bit rushed.
---
it's a very short quest that takes 5 minutes. 
---
Trust me it's like that after each update
---
Ron has sheep enthusiast in his twitch bio
---
Or maybe we should care less
---
Nah, they just happened to make it that way :p
---
What's the exp/hr?
---
As someone who went to IU, I hate this
---
No we don't. People trained construction perfectly fine for a decade before left click construction. Just because you've been spoiled by cheat plugins, it doesn't mean we need to make the game easier.
---
Take my money!
---
weak bait.
---
Ye and its usually 2 ticks with serp + bp if you dont see how thats worth than i guess you fit in the casual tob-er description who doesnt care
---
Can’t do TOB without their wheelchair client lmao
---
If they purchase the 3rd party client company, that doesn’t mean the workers have to stay, just that they get the intellectual property. They could all just leave and start a new company that approaches the build differently.
---
You've put lost city in there twice, this is a really nice to lookout layout for skill and quest requirements  though
---
t90 bow that hits 80+ is fine, t75 gear with high defence too OP.
---
2,000 IQ
---
Everyone has different limits. Some tolerated no mtx, some have only now reached their limit.
---
Yes, ironman too. Only time I ever played osrs is when it very first launched for like a month.
---
I’m personally more okay with something like a boss helper more than new insanely fast ways to train skills. These bosses should be a near brain dead activity if you’re grinding them regularly anyway.
---
It was good. Although it did seem a tad too easy for a master quest.
---
The tradeable ones don't even work for the quest lmao
---
Copy pasta for the lads at work

This isn't a Grandmaster quest either, that's what he's saying. Grandmaster are the difficult super long ones, Master quests can be short.
---
Nicee! Im planning on making the switch to osrs. I just dont want to do the questing grind all over again
---
Quick, do a hard diary
---
I don't really know what you mean by holes in integrity.
---
Would that be them taking a firm stance on all erd party clients?
---
How is it BIS? At most it's average. It's less than rune defenses and strength decrease mean for high level PVM it's useless. However for mid level players trying to practice mid level bossing, those extra few hitsplats might be important.
---
I just noticed there was no melee accuracy boosting armour and on my alt, it could use an item like that (70 combats). However the item would be useless for my main (90 combats).
---
If you run the stats through calculators, it's far from OP. At a high enough attack level, obsidian outclasses it in every way.
---
I think the quest is bugged for those of us that have the unlimited tele enchanted lyre(i). Quest log says to speak to Fossegrimen to enchant sigil and i have all the other parts of the quest completed but she just responds "You do not have a lyre with you that I can enchant. It must have been strung, but it cannot bear any existing enchantment." Click here to continue ends chat. I've even tried coming with a new strung lyre and all she did was enchant and imbue it to unlimited lyre again for free and still not let me move on to finish the quest. Anyone else experience this?
---
My friend quit osrs cus if hand pain
---
Not many knight spawns.
---
wow that's the only unique i have and i'm 3kc lol
---
\&gt; And in many ways would still suck lol.
---
Explain? How would you know what they budget for the project.
---
You don't. Nice pessimism though.
---
Peak dad bod.
---
4 comments our of my thousands lol.
---
I quit playing like a year ago but I just checked the HS. 1440 total.level.
---
So far I haven't had any issues with my navigation bar sliding up at all, and I also have an android. Maybe try playing around with your settings or something? Wish I could offer better help.
---
They wouldn't have to buy it its open source they can juste copy it put it as their main client and make plug-in themself
---
I agree that the games need to improve in some places like new content updates to stay alive and well. But we need to look at the bigger picture and understand that balancing all skills including xp rates, clicks, interaction, etc it's an extremely hard task, and would require a lot of resources. We asked for oldschool, and oldschool comes with this things. Just imagine something like balancing all weapon types right now. Skills are on the same boat and are even more complex.
---
Probably the shield with capital S that is a new item and you need to go to Waterbirth dungeon for it.
---
JMods don't read this thread, try the Q&amp;A thread posted weekly on Mondays/Tuesdays depending on your timezone.
---
“It’s not like it’s hard anyway!” Is the worst offender imo. People think that because things can easily be done, it’s not worth doing at all or that you shouldent “have to”. Of course, there are like... 5 things in the entire game that are actually “hard”, they don’t realize that the tediousness *is* the difficulty.
---
As a casual who’s gotten a combined total of 10m exp in construction/thieving since the release of the OSBuddy, I’m just frustrated with Jagex’s history of inaction in “grey areas”. I think the risk is worth it if I’m finally able to be on the side of those who benefit from Jagex’s failures.
---
2-3 times the gold = 2-3 times the XP rate or you've just got a failed poll and wasted time on your hands. No one is going to accept making the 99 even more expensive than it already is.
---
I disagree
---
Have them be contracted for it.
---
Does it do anything special that you know of?
---
Vidya right? Thanks for letting me use the pool when i was doing lunar diplomacy. might swing by again if i have some cash on me
---
Quest is very very easy.
---
Lol 2 completely different viewpoints regarding this update
---
For me this update sucks. They should have just added a toggle.
---
It's not about the skill being "garbage to train", obviously they're going to use it because it makes it 0 effort and they won't be banned lmao
---
It's actually closer to 800k xp/hr if you're paying attention. 1.5m xp/day should be no issue even without the new plugin.
---
Imo it makes the learning curve harder for new players because it would seem really overwhelming with all the plugins etc and they would have to put some integration in game like a tutorial for it. Like rs3 looks so overwhelming to me I struggle to even go through the menus
---
I think it is going to respond different from phone to phone. Android seems to work slightly different depending on your phone model. I just think they need a menu bar location toggle, that would work for everyone
---
just before you get kicked out of the fremmenik family, you get told something by brundt. Your character responds with what it is? instead of what is it.
---
ALSO I noticed you give players a surname once they have done the quest! That's freaking awesome!
---
Torture and prims before you get bandos
---
u gotta kill the big boy baselisk in the jail
---
Since it drops the new best in slot helmet
---
That’s what already happens. If something is added that Jagex doesn’t like, it is removed from RuneLite.
---
You probably got the wrong fremenik shield.
---
Pretty sure it acts as a mirror shield
---
very poor way of argueing, might aswelll include a tbow clip where a guy hits 80s over and over again on zuk and say; DUDE TBOW FREE CARRY
---
Tbf that was rly underwhelming. I expected some twist after the jormungund fight because of what your character says and how short it seemed to be, like some basilisks bursting through the longhall during the end celebration... and then it really ended up being the end lmao
---
It has not.
---
Sure but come on it's a little much. Some guy just posted how he beat Exiles in 20 minutes lol.
---
not
---
Or if you're living in reality, most people will realize it's not really changing the skill that much, and if you paid attention while training there is no change in XP rate. It's just cutting down on the searing wrist pain. Hardly cheating, but then again it is ***MASSIVELY*** subjective.
---
It's still good everywhere there isn't noted herbs.
---
&gt;55 RCing is literally less than 3 hours of lavas.
---
I know but theres a lot of people out there who still rock a combat bracelet, regular nezzy will definitely added to the list of "common but embarassing items to wear" if you ask me
---
&gt;No I mean if they add +1 str bonus to any other piece of gear (body/legs/boots) in future content.
---
Oh yeah that could be true, many people will still use serp in places for the poison effect and its value wont drop due to being linked to scales tho, so does it really matter?
---
I dont think you know how hobbies work. I like playing runescape but streaming it for 8 hours a day as a job like career streamers do would sound horrendous to me. A job is a job.
---
Because the Mutagen is a very coveted item and having it being replaced by a Slayer drop doesn't sit well with people.
---
Fuck osbuddy.
---
so you have something to whine about like a lil bitch you are
---
Or I could just rush 99 real quick with this new plugin.
---
quick question, im a zerk and noticed I can do these quests but wanted to be reassured I don't need to complete it in order to be granted slayer tasks. I was planning on doing the quest but honestly there's no reason for me to do so since the only benefit to me would be xp.
---
So uhh.. anyone else really disappointed with these new quests (My Arm, Fremennik Exiles, Taste of Hope, Corsair Curse, etc..)? OSRS graphics and quest structure is a goddamn dream for developing good and inexpensive content, yet there really hasn't been any innovation, when it comes to new quest content. I feel like most of the resources go into the new areas/content after the quest, rather than the quest itself, which is really disappointing.
---
Are the Devs afraid to innovate because of the community, or are they just this incompetent?
---
Next update: Adding tbow to the kurask drop table
---
Wouldn't it be the Carpenter's Guild?
---
No one is wearing the farming one lets be honest.
---
Can do minimum of 10 from china for decent pricing, less than a week turn around importing to Australia we mainly use this service for flags as we stopped most in house fabric printing and all types of screen printing. We primarily do wide format flat bed printing, all our clients are sign writer company's that outsource the printing and fishing. 
---

---
Note: My price above was factoring avg shipping to usa or eu. I actually went through this with the graphic designers and admin staff the last time this was posted. I am a person that could make this happen and my irl situation was better i would.
---
Is it possible to refight the boss? I kinda enjoyed the mechanics.
---
Also, when I landed on the Island of Stone it played the track Exposed, which is from South of Tyras Camp. Not sure if that's a bug, but I still unlocked all the music tracks so I guess it didn't skip anything.
---
I don't play anymore but my guess would be that since the boss is hidden behind a quest with somewhat decent requirements and quests completed then the difficulty of the boss is pretty irrelevant. 
---
Personally, I support more items being locked behind skills and quests. One of the reasons I quit was because of the steeping cash requirements for BIS items, I just don't have the patience or care to grind the same meta pvm method all year round for a +1 boost over something worth 0.1% of its worth.
---
You can buy the helm without doing the quest though
---
They talked so much about the council and i thought we would get to interact with them on a level befitting a master quest. 
---
This quest just ended up being One Small Favour 1.5 with Giant Sea Snake's older brother boss thrown in
---
I’m confused. I don’t see anything to support racist porn here?
---
You make good points, but this is not an issue with construction.  This is literally almost every skill.
---
Yeah that was the joke mate
---
Tbow upgrade*
---
Mod Wolf
---
Requires the completion of Exiles to equip, which requires 55 RC. that's what I meant.
---
i allegedly botted once with an "undetectable" bot, got banned after 2 days
---
the bots always say theyre undetectable so that youll buy them
---
youre gonna post this every week huh? hahaha
---
Because RC is horrible.
---
I dont mind. Some look good with the icons.  Some dont lol. I dont see a difference from this and other companies putting their logos all over crap
---
Will scale to always be more expensive than SERP.
---
Get ibans blast and everything is gucci
---
Because people would bitch about EZscape if it was 10k.
---
NNNOOO-NOOOOOO GIGACHAD YOU CANT JUST USE YOUR MONEY TO BUY THE BEST GEAR FOR THE TASK AND ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS ITS NOT FAIR
---
no exaggeration
---
Im hoping based off the ending there will be another sequel of maybe grandmaster level.
---
For sure, I’d pay it even if we didn’t get it on mobile and it meant there was a decent official client
---
And none of those previous ones are allowed either?
---
Knights are just a regular slay mob. Their loot table is nothing worthehile either. I see them like gargoyles with an extra attack style.
---
Remember the previous bis helm a fremmy quest offered was literally a 50k vendored item.
---
It's getting hard for me to understand the nuances lol
---
Well, I talked about wow because at the end of MoP, or the begining of WoD, there was a plug in that basically was a raid finder for normal and + mode. It would use battletags to group you with anyone, exploiting the friend list.
---
Iirc, Blizzard restricted or closed it I don't know how so I assume they have a hand on what is okay or not, so should have jagex with their system.
---
How they do that, Idk...
---
Is there a way to apply any sort of authentification on plugins?
---
Maybe they should integrate in the official client, downloadable only on a controlled platform like wiki, and usable only when Jagex have reviewed it and applied and auth on it?
---
So, every savage plug in we try to add would never work because the server doesn't auth it, and so doesn't communicate with it? Is it even possible?
---
Thats what I understand when you talk about key. With this, you'd give a key to a final product, not people and maybe you could adapt it to give only what said product needs?
---
It's pure magic to me now lol, I don't know what I'm talking about but I find this interesting.
---
You're description of what does the RS3 API seems reasonnable, isn't it possible to apply a similar one to osrs?
---
Why it would be different like the need of changing rate limits?
---
I honestly wouldnt wear that in public. Maybe the hunter one but the rest are meh
---
OSRS was literally born on “pseudodifficulty” then. It’s not a negative.
---
At least 60 magic with iban staff with monk robes on while you still have prayer and when it runs out switch to full rune if you want to tank the hits or just bring prayer pots
---
Get 50 range for a msb to use that on ahrims
---
Or atleast net. I came back with 2 nets, i for sure thought a rod would break trying to lift a rock.
---
&gt;If clicking a bunch causes physical pain, then RS is not your game lol.
---
I was going to post a sarcastic comment along the lines of 'no pain, no gain' but you beat me to it... and I think you're actually being serious.
---
I'm almost at 1000kc :c no pet yet
---
Happy birthday though!
---
Look under you subscriptions when you login to make a payment. Contact support for a refund on the 7.95
---
If it's similar to konar it's a big increase
---
You still need a rock, there's just no emotional attachment anymore.
---
basilisks all day for a little money I'd say
---
Runelite plugins helps more than justicar imo
---
there is no melee armor that gives + accuracy other than void which requires the full set. this would be BIS for accuracy on task / anywhere you cant use void
---
does that accuracy correspond with more dps? not necessarily and the lack of str bonus means in most cases it wont. but that doesnt make it not bis accuracy
---
I agree here. Having even a 4 pixel gap would be a nice separation.
---
Nieve was a slut anyway.

---
You dont need to find the guy at waterbirth the dagganoths at the entrance drop the shield. The story should have went something like the chieftain sacrificed himself to save you during the boss fight and was turned into stone and left you to solo the boss making it harder with basilsks being summoned as you fight each one attacking with a different style,  thus leaving more content or a link for a follow up quest. Boss fight was ridiculously easy
---
I said what I meant to say.  
---
You made the initial claim. That puts the burden on YOU.
---
You don't get to turn around and say "well prove me wrong or I'm right" when you're the one who made the initial claim without *any* evidence.
---
Do you know why the wiki lists starting barbarian firemaking as one of the prereqs? 
---
I did it to be safe, but can't where it comes up as being needed.
---
I just did 70-84 construction without even playing all that efficiently and it was still over in no time. If you're not willing to play at 100% efficiency you can just train a bit slower and still gain a ton of xp.
---
They are continuing it. The quest literally explains that ahaha. And the Devs have confirmed they are. This isn't a finale, nor is it grandmaster. The boss was never going to be hard at max combat and max gear for me. I didn't take any damage. But at the same rate I one shot DS2, sote and mm2 bosses on day of release without guides. And they were proper difficulty grandmaster bosses. 
---
So its not like quest bosses have ever been that difficult when you're well above the targeted combat that would be doing the quest with natural progression
---
Anyone know how much data os RuneScape typically consumes? On a fixed screen. Thanks
---
And the total worlds being "Can't afford P2P / Im special cause I limit myself to F2P"
---
I think people just end up.. realizing they’re not having fun, but instead of people able to say “hey I’ll just do something else!”, they get obsessive over OSRS. They say “oh no, it should be fun, I just hate the *tediousness*” or “oh no I’ll play the right way, but why should I have to play through all this stuff I don’t want to do first? It’s not like I couldn’t if I wanted to”. 
---
Ultimately they’re just in denial about not having fun anymore.
---
No more deaths. It's too many rn. Summoning additional basilisks would have worked. But yeah fight was easy
---
Not true at all. If you can program bots/cheats you can EASILY make a client for them to run on. Anyone creating bot farms etc has also created literally countless clients.
---
If you need to use RL your cheats probably suck ass.
---
Source: 10+ year long cheater in this game.
---
Lots of shit breaks I'd imagine
---
If it helps at all, here's my total stats
---
[https://imgur.com/a/7nW5rec](https://imgur.com/a/7nW5rec)
---
1) The code in licensed in a way which does not require Jagex to buy RuneLite in order to use its code.  
---
2) They could however buy the domain/servers from me, which I run, which would effectively be "buying" the project. Not sure if that is something I'd want to do though.  
---
3) Jagex has been not reached at to me at all during this recent OSB fiasco, and is ignoring my pings on Discord, so whatever they are going to announce is probably not this...
---
Yeah figured that out after watching Woox do it on stream...
---
Thought with the rating of the quest (Master I think?) it would be a bit more... Convoluted.
---
He doesn't die tho hes been turned to stone thus leaving a follow up
---
Ill give this a shot, I didn't know about this feature. It seems like it will give more screen real estate  for all apps! Thanks!
---
What about void magic with buckler and tormented bracelet instead of void gloves?
---
there will never be a osrs dubble xp
---
thanks man
---
You did MM1 in less than 30mins?
---
Cause that’s how long it took me to do exiles, and I didn’t bring food for the fights because I wasn’t prepared.
---
Yeah I was kinda annoyed by that
---
The people paying these prices have nothing better to spend it on. 
---
People pay for speed and convenience. The market sells at what people are willing to buy at.
---
Ridiculous? Maybe. 
---
But it is what it is.
---
Nah I’m an Ironman who’s killed 33,000+ though.
---
Not legit. That’s A phishing website do not enter any info, and anything you did enter you should change ASAP. Osrs will never get double exp as long as it’s polled.
---
Get a new pet rock in front of the long hall in relleka
---
nope not real no double xp in osrs
---
no u.
---
agreed. atleast have the monster have some tpye of mechanic that drops like jormungands gaze affect. that way you cant afk a bis helm attachment, youd get stack'd the fuck out
---
my sweet summer child...
---
You're literally Reddit you brainlet.
---
Thanks man. I guess I'll just left click pick up, and hope I don't get another nech task till its fixed lol. Picking up the ashes would Be awful.
---
The quest was great, dialogue was really funny at times.
---
The Basilisk Knights on the other hand are ass. 40 Slay req for bis helm makes absolutely no sense and it will be dead content in a week.
---
Segmentation would have been nice and made it far more realistic. 
---
But then so would making the coins round. 
---
Dunno what OP was thinking.
---
Not even remotely close abbreviation tho, but ok.
---
It looked like a promotion at first, didn’t enter anything as it seemed too good to be true
---
should still be processing to 1080p
---
**tl;dw** i did the quest blind for fun, thought people might enjoy watching that or just laughing at how dumb i am. it might have taken me 20 minutes to do the polishing rock part....
---
Adam doesn't even enjoy working on RuneLite itself.
---
Right?  Their is a big difference between color coding your gear in your inv , or customizing the in game feature for always right click , seeing your bank value  and 1 click macros that are in fact, multiple clicks condensed into 1 left click.  
---
1 click farming contract vs 1 click use bones on altar
---
haha so funny haha
---
ok, tbh on first day 20min make a huge difference.
---
Even purple guys, eeeew
---
Sorry dude, the point of the skill is to be a gold sink
---
just unlocked/extended and cancelled my current task &amp; got them straight away from vannaka. 209 basalisks
---
Very few methods of melee training use serp helm. Obby/DHing NMZ, Slayer, etc
---
Even though I believe it should be locked to exiles, it's still a bigger time investment in order to use it as it stands.
---
Shit I just stopped playing
---
I like BSD-2 so that Jagex can hopefully use parts of it if they want. I don't think there are any FOSS licenses which can prevent "crazy forks", so I don't think there is really anything to relicense it *to*. I underestimated the communities willingness to weaponize RuneLite to try and destroy the game's endgame content and achievements. I'm not sure if I would have made RL knowing what I know now. The situation back then with OSB was super shady and I still really like that there are alternative clients, and without RL there would not be any.
---
I'm hoping for a grandmaster quest sort of like DS2. That'd be awesome
---
It took me about a week or so of casual playing from 85
---
Just had this realization last week and my friends made fun of me for a couple days lol
---
For real. Why not post the method?
---
Oh whats becoming of me
---
From a developer standpoint not really the same. Free and open source software is a strong philosophy that many open source developers have. The developer is not likely to ever want to take this amazing community effort and close source it. It's not just about the pay but the entire philosophy and even ethics of free and open software
---
Which is why runelite is open and not closed like osbuddy for example. 
---
Community and developer control over what features remain or are added versus Jagex just laying down the law is one example.
---
I posted this exact idea recently and got so much shit :(
---
Takes less time to do the quest to get the Neitiznot than to get 4.5m for the serp helm. Not to mention serp has scale upkeep, and drops from a semi-difficult boss depending on gear and experience.
---
I just don't think Basilisk knights were the right move.
---
I mean, yea, I love using the max cape. But the fact that it's so powerful incentivizes player who otherwise wouldn't ever consider maxing to go for it. Which incentivizes whining that skills are too long/too click intensive etc.
---
they're just getting you ready for when rs3 takes osrs with it.
---
I found out about tithe farm much later lol. I just did it with medium seeds for the auto weed. Returned couple times when reached lvl 74 to get seed box but still havent finished getting the points, but xp wise it was quite good yeah, if you want to boost farming levels
---
Why not just throw your quick prayers to prot from mage + rigour and flick both, if you're going the "range, pray mage, and tank everything else" route?
---
Or just flick both, it's a bit more complicated but I'd imagine saving the restores on an ironman would be worth it (especially if you plan on doing more caves for slayer tasks / pet hunting)... Or even on a regular account if 10 restores is a significant cost for you :P
---
Either one is a good skill worth learning since you'll need to know and be extremely consistent with proper flicking for inferno :P
---
90% yes vote. Learn from this.
---
Why do you hurt me like that, Jamflex?
---
That is so statistically unlikely that I can almost guarantee that you already had a clue from before. You can only have one at a time of each tier, but multiple caskets.
---
Gz! Is new monster easy?
---
Wasn't that the concept art for the blowpipe?
---
I deleted my last comment as I didn't want to argue a lot with people and it sounded way too aggressive for a funny video response, but yeah there are women that I would say "no" to in that position. I'm friends with women I'm not attracted to.
---
But doesn’t the first part of your comment outweigh the second? (Actually asking no sarcasm here) Shouldn’t that be the point and then hopefully the devs/community can be mature and not just self vote or you know maintain integrity. Idk.
---
Nice, good luck! Yeah I have stored 3 capes, just have to remember bringing them with me for the rest of 99 I get lol
---
Corsair Curse was a great F2P quest, better than most of what F2P has anyways.
---
And I'll mirror what others are saying, I enjoyed Taste of Hope and the My Arm quest. Both the quests themselves and the rewards they gave were great.
---
...is that true??
---
That's what you look like when you wear your BIS armor.
---
I’m well read and I know that clicking on a tar and an herb to bring up an herb menu which makes you catch fish faster was not intended and is a bug in the games code that is abused for more xp. I don’t do drugs im 25 with a good job and a life. I bring up the Adderall because it’s obvious that’s what these bug abusers are doing.
---
Huk huk
---
As opposed to just buying a serp?
---
Most people rather bis come from upgrading your account, not juet your bank
---
Nether of these helms are "end game" they're just bis
---
That's like calling fire cape "end game content", just because it's good doesn't mean it's end game.
---
yes
---
Mobile bad
---
From the creators of "Max cash stack bug", we proudly present "New BiS helmet from an AFK slayer monster".
---
I see you PKer
---
Nice try
---
After reading the comments apparently he's actually insanely good at pvm and was just trolling
---
I like this.
---
I'd love to but I doubt I can even edit anything on the wiki.
---
You are the problem if you think it's good for the economy and OSRS to have a bis item cheap. It will make the new basilisk dead content in a few months because no one will be killing them for 300k/hr. You know how it works. This is only good for irons.
---
I'm sorry you are terribly misguided.
---
Rune med bis or gtfo. ICONIC.
---
Yeah Brundt outside the cave gives them back, 50k. Not sure about the other instance though...
---
40 prayer for ranged is enough. Use magic and entangle or similar spells. Deal damage three times and prepare to entangle again after a brief cooldown period. Any death rune spell should be sufficient.
---
Most people don't use serp at dks becuz slay helm
---
Great update
---
Anyone can make a claim, it doesn’t have to be supported or even factual.
---
Claim: to assert in the face of possible contradiction.
---
To refute a claim, you have to successfully prove it to be false or erroneous in some way. But, he didn’t do that, he claimed my claim was baseless, which is baseless unless they have experienced evidence that suggests otherwise. Their ‘evidence’ to support their claim was that I didn’t provide evidence, however...
---
My claim is only baseless if I did not first-hand read or observe Jagex reporting on the incident. And, because it is first-hand experience of an event, it is difficult to prove unless I saved the links to the Twitter feed or the main website. But, why would I keep something like that for years on the off-chance I might have a discussion like this? Would you do something like that?
---
Honestly, if this affected me somehow, I would have that information readily available to share, but I’m not dumb enough to use something that Jagex has repeatedly told users is against their terms of service... Unlike everyone using OSBuddy and RuneLite along with other clients on their main accounts. A lot of this information is readily available on the RS website too, so I’m not sure how I would be responsible for you knowing that, if the 3rd party client being against the rules is part of your concern.
---
I don’t care if you think I’m wrong, but, for arguments sake, I’ll explain why I wouldn’t say if you don’t prove me wrong then I am right, and how I have not done so.
---
I have repeatedly stated that, you don’t have to believe me and that I was only sharing my experience.
---
I have said that, you should do the research for yourself, specifically if you are someone concerned about the issue.
---
I have said that, the information is readily available in public domains, so it would be easy for you to do your own research.
---
And, I have in no way said that someone was wrong for saying that I was wrong, only that the way they approached the discussion was fallacious.
---
I guess people like raging when someone says something inconvenient. I have gotten so much negative karma for talking about something Jagex has done in the past. Gotten a ton of negative karma for other comments which I consider to be neutral or slightly positive. Makes me think Reddit isn’t the community for me :P. But, whatever, do what you want, think what you want. What do you or anyone else care how it affects others?
---
PS, sorry, I hate text walls too.
---
Just seems like an unnecessary risk, as the cost of supplies is not an issue to me. I only do fight caves on task so messing up and dying would really be a bummer. But you're right I do need to practice, maybe I'll run it offtask
---
Does it have a pong table
---
True but it's just nice to think of new players actually getting a good client right off the bat.
---
Maybe Jagex should just fork it and host their own rebranded version with the plugin system changed up?
---
Gzz!
---
Well then our priorities are wrong.
---
*richard stallman flute playing intensifies to a violent volume*
---
Lol, members worlds are the same brother
---
I reported 50 accounts at master farmers. They get rogue outfit then just grind 99 thieving off master farmers and never get banned
---
Only skill proposal I was okay with entering the game. Rip.
---
Lol you're a joke. Pretty sure I've worked harder than you my whole life. I bet you work at Walmart and weigh 300 lbs. I have a professional career and math degree from a top university. I know dedication. Sounds like you're the one that got hurt considering you instantly resorted to name calling and attacking my character.
---
THIS IS MY ROCK THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT BUT THIS ONE IS MINE
---
I dont know why your being downvoted.
---
you're defending mtx?
---
All started with Squeal of Fortune when Jagex said it will have no effect on core gameplay.
---
Why even bother with the average players perspective? There are thousands of players who can drop 20m and not care at all, that doesn't make them stupid, just means that they're rich.
---
these noted resource drops are my pet peeve
---
That’s a great question. It actually wasn’t any particular update. I just read joined RuneScape after taking a two-year break. I came back and realized that every old moneymaking method is now trash, except for the incredibly high-end ones. 
---
Seeing as my account was a mid to high level account. I didn’t see it worth my time and I certainly wasn’t going to put money into the only way to train nowadays which appears to be MTX
---
Everyone is entitled to their opinion o.o
---
I agree it's doesn't make me better, but at least I'm on the defensive and still arguing my main points. Didn't realize you weren't the original guy in my other reply.
---
So you are basically saying this is not worth it?
---
For free?? I paid that fucker 150k.
---
Ash saying "maybe" does not help your case lmao it's 50/50
---
Correction on the last one, it's about  90fps on average actually. It's only about 70fps on average in Lumbridge, I'd say. It can get up to about 110fps, but it can also drop to about 18fps during those stutters. I think I have the cap set at 150fps just because that was the default. Really, it doesn't matter if it gets above 60 fps as long as it's stable because my monitor refresh rate it 60Hz.
---
I think the main reason the average fps isn't higher is because my render distance is 16 chunks and the game has to load quite a bit with chisels and bits.
---
I just stepped one space back each time he tp'ed me, hit him with xbow, and continued
---
i did the new quest today on the default client, i found it had all the necessary features
---
The damage halves each time. Which would you rather have, the ags hit or claws hit? In an ideal situation.
---
while the claws do guarantee more hit potential i'd still take an ags if i was going against rune/dh.
---
I'm not so sure why so many people think that Runelite is an acceptable client for a company the size of Jagex. I personally don't mind the cobbled together look, but the plug ins by and large are unacceptably ugly. As a low hanging fruit, the agility plug in is as hacky as can be.
---
Almost every employer checks out a potential hire's github repository. The people saying previous projects have no impact have no idea what they're talking about.
---
Is runelite allowed? What's the best way to play RS without breaking the rules?
---
Just ban everyone who used the OSB plugin, fuck it.
---
Seriously, we know knowingly cheating results in a ban. I remember the penguin points glitch in old RS2, people who used it a couple of times were forgiven but anyone who used it more than could be considered accidental was banned, because they knowingly abused a bug.
---
If you see a glaring bug/glitch that can be abused and you abuse it repeatedly, you deserve a ban. I discovered a bug which was very helpful to me as an ironman, and even though I reported it and it still hasn't been fixed, I won't abuse it.
---
If anyone is interested, when a herblore boost drops and you are making potions needing that level, you stop making potions the second the boost drops. Except for staminas, you can finish the inventory on 76 herblore. Tiny, tiny bug, but I know Jagex doesn't take abuse lightly (or didn't, anyway).
---
The rules have been clear for years, banning every cheater is better than rolling back everyone, with the same result for the cheaters and no punishment for everyone else. It shouldn't be hard to see who got exp/h above what should be possible and ban the lot of them.
---
No one would be upset if the quest had no rewards at all.
---
This scares me, i just hitted the droprate..
---
If you watch that stream, you can find a ton more of those moments.
---
it doesn't help that you more or less have to stay there doing 1-99 fm in one go, as its so aids to run up there. That means you can't ever go afk fishing or something when you want to play on the main/play other games/just cant focus on it 100%. Hope they remove 10hp WT and I dont see why it cant have a minigame teleport or some ice fishing or just some other content up there as well.
---
Thunderbirds are go!
---
Welcome, i converted to osrs about 6 months ago. first week was hard to get my head around it again, but stick with it! :D have fun and use the wiki
---
No? Virtus isn't BiS tho...
---
70 def 60 attack 70/77 pray should cover you, allows you to bully 75 attack pures, personally I'm making a 70 def 75 attack account for my main
---
Good question. In fact, nobody has ever been to Cambridge. It was invented sometime in the 1950s.
---
Got hit for a 45 with the "red screen" glare attack.
---
Just being real here, no they wouldn't. Look at the comments on this sub for example. People hate construction and runecrafting but aren't willing to spend the money on Mahogany Tables or runners which is considered far more efficient than oak planks or ZMI which a lot of the sub says they do, even given the time it takes to make the gp. There's no way that 99% of the people in the subset of players that consider Construction to be too hard to train normally would be willing to shell out 30-40 gp/xp.
---
I have a problem
---
Here is a good answer I found in.another thread 
---
"Osbuddy used to be the most popular 3rd party client charging people and making alot of money from it. Our hero RuneLite came along, offering us the same service but for free, killing off osbuddys profits and client base. Now, in an attempt to get more clients, they have released controversial plug ins that let you one click altar to use bones on altar, one click knockout blackjack thieving, so very op borderline cheat plug ins. Which many believe will lead jagex to update their stance on 3rd party clients, possibly banning them."
---
No one cares about the helmets stats, people are mad that it comes from budget kurasks.
---
If it came from an actual new boss no one would care.
---
It literally takes 2 minutes to learn.
---
Oh it's 100% stupid I'm not disagreeing, it's just not BiS
---
Thanks for the encouragement! I figured in the transition, I would try out hard-core Iron Man for the first time. Only spent 30 minutes on the account last night just trying to kill cows. I’m going to wait a few more days before I purchase membership Since some of the early level training is the same in free to play
---
Oh wow
---
? What does that have anything to do with my comment
---
no
---
&gt; Yeah white claws are in the 
---
Oak Larder
---
This one. This is it, chief.
---
It really isn't 100% correct though. The reason we're in this mess is because OSB (not open source) started adding cheat plug-ins. Maybe it's a bit of both, but most people on this subreddit didn't give a shit about 3rd party clients until the YouTube overlords told the hive mind that osb has 1 click black jacking.
---
Way too early. Give it a week. Not enough data
---
So you're saying add cabin fever as a req to wear black mask? /s
---
They forgot Sir Cumsize
---
Bots do the opposite
---
the damage doesnt halve each time.... if the first or second attacks hit  the damage is the same. if the first 2 miss and the 3rd hits you do 150% of your max hit, and if the first 3 miss and 4th hits you roll a normal hit but with a potential of 150% normal max hit.
---
either way that doesnt matter anyways because the question was purely about accuracy
---
Wtf is this shit
---
Because they would ruin it. 
---
Mind changed
---
Looks like using cheat clients have turned your brain to mush, pity.
---
But it actually might...
---
THIS IS THE VOICE OF THE MYSTERONS!
---
2m
---
Id rather a revamped DKs of some sort. A quest that leads into harder, more complex set of dks, that requires a duo or trio team to complete. Maybe a new raid? With a seers ring upgrade that gives 2% magic dmg boost. Just some ideas
---
It was out there a year or two ago after the first time that the subreddit was fully turned into a meme reddit for a little bit. Every post was related to MTX, and the whales complained that they wanted none of that, so they added that tag.
---
Yeah as I said, student just means still taking the professional exams, which usually take an additional ~5 years after graduation to complete. Don't talk about things you know nothing about.
---
same with a person using Tbow sooo... tbow is free carry?
---
Downvote and move on people
---
Got any dragon claws?
---
Full disclosure... I have a combat brace, took it off for the picture, then felt guilty and circled my wrist anyway.
---
It's a video game. If you're whining this hard about what people say, just ignore the people. Dont advocate for ruining speech on the game. Just grow up. If you dont like it, just dont interact. Literal SJW shit
---
I know the feeling I’ve been at 2025 for awhile yet it’s always nice to see a another scraper reach that sweat sweat maxed
---
I do? And so does every that does a farm run. Also I did that with agility cause FUCK agility. 50k a day at the end of the night
---
*cheese cape
---
I mean they’re a low level monster, tbh the profits should be pretty miniscule if the rare drop isnt hit.
---
I’d be fine with them dropping around the same amount of herbs as Abarrent Spectres, but with them not noted. Idk why the QA team has such a fat fucking hard on for noted drops
---
Ok, you win the internet.
---
?
---
What do bots have to do with mobile being worse then not playing on runelite on pc LOL 
---
I’d rather do a f2p uim then play mobile
---
Delusional
---
It's a female body with the face of God Ash
---
Thanks for all the love guys! Fun to open up reddit to see this.
---
this drop table is worse than anything mod John C could come up with and he’s made the worst drop tables to ever hit OSRS
---
Everyone knows. Just stay away from it
---
It's the pyramid plunder go to tho

Kinda debatable, Zammy I'd say most would still want blood barrage and as for Vorkath you're now giving up up to [3 max hits](https://imgur.com/a/Pixg6Oz) with faceguard in exchange for 1 food slot vs a hypothetical 0 bonus serp helm (non-pizza capers only have a 2 difference). It probably won't change the meta, just give more options.

If you consider all the conditions currently surrounding the mobs and the item, then no, it won't. If jagex buffs or somehow alters the mobs, maybe. But as it currently stands, the demand for jaw will be high, while the nature of the monster will mean the jaw will have a small supply.
---
Just because it started at 55m and crashed to 20m today doesn't mean jack shit. Today is a fluke, as launch days usually are.
---
Ah I don't have Bandos gear, only torso + obby legs. I'll see how hard they hit with lackluster defense. Can't be too bad.

Any kind of logic went out the window when they started giving noted resources to monsters. Like a monster can kill an adventurer and get his rune scimitar; that makes sense. But who are these poor bankers that keep getting murdered with stacks of noted logs and herbs?

Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I’m gonna check them out right now. GIMP seems popular.

The droprate of the new basilisk jaw on the wiki was updated to 1/512 is that the drop rate on or off slayer task? Side question is there a way to force basilisk slayer task or do you just skip tasks till you get it? Seemed like everyone in the stone island dungeon was on slayer task

is there a way to make chatbox bigger? I'm playing on a 27'' 1440p screen and it just looks super tiny

Also, you are just getting into it, so learning how things work is going to be helpful before you skip all your levels
---
Yeah lol. This guy has 2 maxed account and my only 99's are wc and fletch lmao
---
the games not actually fun i just play cause im addicted
---
The difficulty rating isn't the best.  Haunted mine is one of the hardest quests in the game and its only considered "Experienced"
---
Yeah, no wonder he burnt out post 2200, he did it twice simultaneously lol
---
This picture was on their Twitter as a sneak-peak
---
This was the official teaser announcement image that Jagex used when they polled the quest
---
Maxing with quest sounds good too, gj.
---
How are these things not giving an edge? Ground items = easier to see items, gpu = smoother gameplay, left click banking = more ehp, etc. 
---
What draws the line between a “necessary” feature and an edge?

You need Iban’s for barrows and at least 43 prayer, it’s much more profit to get prayer to 70 though
---
You gonna wanna train agility before you try underground pass quest 
---
You should just keep questing, you’re too early for barrows, what do you need money for, prayer?
---
Before barrows your best combat money makers are like, killing chaos druids near Ardougne but that requires some Thieving levels...
---
oof, i think itll settle to around 1 mil. At the end of the day it's only +3 strength bonus right? I think itll settle lower just because nezzy is more of a throwaway helm and slayer helm is op
---
I agree.
---
Thanks ;)
---
I chucked. Well done. 😂
---
Does this attachment to the nezi helm make it better than slayer helm? Or slayer helm (i)
---
Just don’t die
---
The master difficulty really does span a variety of quests though, you have Desert Treasure, MM1 and Dream Mentor but you also have Contact! and Roving Elves. This one's definitely on the lower end of the scale
---
I'm not sure how people do 0 movement. But I do minor movement. Resize the client, stand one square diagonal to the door. There's a part of the door where you can right click build and right click remove without moving the mouse. Have the demon butler bring you 20 oak planks, and you can build and remove 2 oak dungeon doors in the time it takes him to come back. Hold down 1 the entire time. When he comes back, click on him, wait for the 1 to register to send him to the bank, and make more doors.
---
Why should people care if someone cheats to get 84 or even 99 construction? How does it impact them? I completely get in pvp and pvm scenarios but things like this are so irrelevant to other people. It doesn't effect you in any way so stop acting like it does and that it's game breaking

People on social media love complaining about everything. Some are saying the unrest is due to polling, but I think people are deeply unhappy with how RS3 has been handled. People may feel entitled to their opinions on the game as well, however I believe this is justified. Often times, these people want the game to thrive and continue to provide hours of joy and escapism. The dwindling playerbase is supporting this game and their voices should be heard if the devs are interested in having it survive.  
---
Although I am also tired of seeing the same complaints over and over again, I think it can help make some positive changes to a game that I love.
---
What does the Q stand for again
---
The gp you get from efficient barrows will cover scales and give you more chests per hour. Definitely worth the upgrade. But msb i will also do fairly well.
---
Mr. Garrison

Just want to say this quest is amazing so far, I'm almost done with creating a certain item.  All the little bits of humor and world-building within the Freminik people is so juicy.  Really feels like the culmination of all the Freminik quests I've done so far.
---
Thanks for taking your time and wording this. You do make a good solid few points. Although I don't necessarily agree that balancing would be that difficult if you keep everything on the low-end, I can definitely see where you're coming from! :)
---
They tend to come out 10:30 UTC I think
---
Pipe with ddarts is better than tbow?
---
10m+ is pocket change my dude
---
Neither of the options you gave make it less click intensive, and they only make it slightly less expensive
---
Also being able to actually tell what tile you’re clicking
---
Yeah the limitation of space for bots was one of my suspicious as an explanation for the sheer volume of them. It’s good to know that there are indeed less on members worlds though as having to fight seven bots for three fuckin oak trees kinda kills the buzz for me. 
---
It’s good to know that ranged will be useful as that was going to be one of my main skills anyway! 
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to reply to me my friend! :)
---
Mobile is easier to bot on. Probably due to no mouse to track for un-human like movement.

lol well a little bit help from ux and ui designer would not hurt, but functionality wise it is a great client

Quit complaining
---
Invention is a great skill and is probably the best money/item sink ever designed.
---
I see what you’re getting at and do agree. I’m in no way any perfectly optimized player. However when I’m doing things, I’ll typically try to create my own methods on optimizing things based on research I find on the wiki. I don’t follow any of that pin-point efficiency shit, but other than that I do try to do things as quickly as possible that will allow me to play comfortably.
---
Do we think we're getting banned for the new OSB plugin?
---
Mind as well use it to get 99 at this point since they're probably removing all 3rd party clients because of crybabies.
---
Redwoods probably your best bet

Poor UIMs.

You can get them from Rasolo by the fishing guild

Are you gonna have a main on your account linked to RS3 and a HCIM?

Roving Elves?

The hard part now is remembering how to do anything member related  😅
---
&gt;  runelite wouldn't bring any profit
---
it would bring in a long run by keeping the game alive by allowing only to use the official client aka runelite
---
I just got membership a week ago, and finished the quest yesterday. Didn’t need a pet rock at all! Only found out I could get a pet rock when I talked to the little Viking boy afterwards, and he gave me one. 
---
At one point do you need a rock?
---
Does drop increase when on task? For jaw
---
imagine dying to galvek lol, i did that boss on my ironman while i was disconnecting constantly
---
Kreygasm
---
I still find it useful for zammy and daganoth kings when off task, or when I’m hunting black chins. It’s also used in raids to my understanding, and when doing pyramid plunder or cutting sulliuscep trees. It’s uses may be more niche than before, but it definitely still has uses
---
So summoning 2: Bony boy bugaloo?
---
I would of thought Slayer would of been the hardest requirement.
---
From my experience Slayer tends to be the most annoying to level up of those listed skills.
---
Nezzy helm, and now faceguard, will always be Bis off task melee training.
---
Slayer helm will always be Bis slayer melle, range, or mage training.
---
I believe

I would genuinely not sell your car, that can act as a bed too, without having to pay someone rent. Trust me, I was in a very similar situation a couple years back, sleeping in my car helped me save up for a few weeks - it was definitely not super comfy, but those few weeks helped me get back into renting a place. I actually was in almost the same situation as you, I had sold my consoles, my main pc and kept my shitty old laptop, then I was going to sell my car but then I realised, the money I would spend in a hotel/B&amp;B/paying someone to sleep on their sofa, I could save and sleep in my car, was truly the best choice I made in the shitty situation.

Holy fuck that's some high quality hentai right there

Has anyone else had issues with the ui being shifted to the right? The space between the edges of my screen and the menu tiles isn't the same on both sides. It also causes my battery icon to be shifted off screen. Not in a position to post a screenshot but I have a Galaxy S10e

6ix9ine about to report you to the feds right now

For most enemies in the game, yes
---
Ewww Purdue
---
Are you saying it is high or low?
---
at what price point would you buy 3 or 4 of them on the spot?
---
BiS fashionscape though!
---
You're calling others wrong because they prioritize different things than you lol, that's the literal definition of it
---
Alright I can at least respect your opinion then lol. Like I said justiciar is strong, but people definitely overhype it on reddit. But in any case the options are either:
---
1. Justiciar actually is that strong, in which case it's just the clear best equipment and you should use it. Only a fool wouldn't. You wouldn't use a master wand instead of a Kodai given the choice, it's just worse. If this is the truth, then by not using justiciar you're just handicapping yourself on purpose. Which fair enough, people do no pillar inferno or 47 cb inferno and all kinds of handicaps. That or,
---
2. It isn't that strong, in which case it doesn't carry you through (the likely truth) and this discussion is pointless
---
Melee is split between attack and strength. Melee is more if you combine them, though it's before we consider how much defence xp is gained through ranging/mage/melee.
---
Politics have no power here. Stop pushing your personal agenda on people playing a video game.
---
Lolllll I’ve never seen panic clicks that bad
---
yeah I am, what plug in do I have to mess with to get the chat size bigger?
---
Either you get it or you don't!
---
I would buy one in a heartbeat
---
Yeah, of course. That's why I'm suggesting a niche use: it would be BiS only at select places, such as DKs off-task, or off-task dragons that you melee. It's not much, but it's something.
---
I mean the answer is simple anyone actually thinking jagex could/should buy runelite are pretty much just entitled kids who are so obsessed with the game they suggest things like this without realizing the possibility of any of it, and the main thing is they don’t care. I want it so give it to me mind set
---
Gz on max cheese 🧀
---
Reported.
---
I fell of my chair laughing when I read that above the drop 😂
---
I get the argument for keeping it in game I understand both sides of it I just land on the ladder in a majority of cases. I would just rather see something click intensive be put into the game for increased rates. Falconry has a direct correlation between how much you are clicking and paying attention to how much xp you are getting. They could implement actual methods that don’t use tick manipulation with the same philosophy of more effort for more xp. It’s just a grey area and I thought when woodcutting literally tripled xp over night we would see tick manipulation fixed  but it didn’t. It’s only a matter of time before 1 tick crafting is here for 500k xp/hr and we’re in the position we are in now with third party clients. They make updates that are expected to be manipulated and make the rates based on that vs just making click intensive activities for more xp.
---
If you’re talking about this picture in particular, it’s just a feature of RuneLite. The loot tracker stacks duplicate items, but it doesn’t stack in your actual inventory.
---
It's 1 in 35 so not that rare. Still.. always nice to see that drop
---
The loot tracker stacks all like items just for easier output. In his actual inventory they wouldn't stack.
---
You know the quest has a 60 slayer req, which means the new helm has not only a 60 slayer req, but also the other skill requirements.
---
Holy shit I remember these! Anyone have a link??
---
British people pronounce “vase” as “vaRZ” ?
---
Wow! Chill.

Seems like a serious nerve for struck. Big into politics?

Subs make up 2/3 of jagex’s bottom line. Using extrapolation, since there are way more osrs players online concurrently we can venture to guess that osrs provides plenty of revenue through members that primarily play osrs. 
---
Not sure that brainless mtx fiends are really necessary. They sure are nice in jagexs eyes, (as any company wants whales) but with the heat coming it may have to change or focus more on subs, which is totally feasible.
---
The discrete logical way of describing the table. Good one haha!
---
Probably, but people use Slayer a lot for combat training so 60 is pretty common.
---
The droprate has not been confirmed yet; people are theorizing it is 1/512 on task and 1/2k off task. The people needed to skip tasks to get a basilisk task.
---
That's some next level shit. Love it.
---
Everyday we stray further from Saradomin...
---
not sure if i just got unlucky or what but in my experience it was shit. constant pkers wasting your time and money. probably couldnt get a solid 15mins without a pker. just seemed like a needless headache. ended up just doing it normally in POH/reanimation
---
mine is Jimmy
---
Ok that explains that.  Thanks.
---
But I was watching Hyphonix in the dueling arena and his dueling rings were stacked.  There was a number 8 next to the ring which he has in his inventory.  I’d like others to know that that happened.
---
Fair enough, I too would like to see more variety in terms of more effort for more xp. I would also prefer to have that option as an intended consequence of new content rather than manipulation of current mechanics.
---
Yeah, we should make a wintertodt for every skill! It’s so fun because it’s easy, costs nothing, and gives me great afk xp! /s

Is it intended for V's shield to not act as a fremennik shield against ice trolls? Currently it does not
---
I agree and that one comment addresses it well, I would just ask that it be somehow optional. Maybe keep the vanilla client as a separate thing? I don't know much about computer stuff and I haven't read many comments since I'm in class so disregard this if someone else said something about this.
---
Yeah, GPU Rendering is a fucking must.

Tried to add, unknown player.
---
Smithing was basically finalized as a skill in runescape classic, with no room left for new content. The original devs just didnt have the foresight for the game, but we're talking like basically the very start of classic, so it's not really that surprising.
---
That's why RS3 revamped the whole skill somewhat recently.
---
Gz

&gt; I’ll typically try to create my own methods

This will scale everything though and not only your chatbox.

It's open source, they could just make a fork of it the official client if they wanted. Maybe hire a few people to maintain it.

You being downvoted for not knowing/going along with a very well known meme.
---
Can someone post a screenshot from a Samsung S10+ as the screen merges with cameras?
---
I loved the references in this quest !
---
My favorite was when you talk to Baba Yaga with a molten glass already in your inventory.
---
Full rune in classic pre-members made you a living god. Especially if you had the rune large which only came from greater demons deep in the wilderness. Full rune proved you were a slayer of dragons and a vanquisher of the greatest of demons.
---
I remember mining rune essence on f2p in order to buy a rune pickaxe....so I could mine more rune essence
---
I have done a lot of questing. I have done every quest that awards range XP and DEF. Only Cold War left that gives STR XP (and it's only 40), only Scorpion Catcher and Troll Romance left for Strength.
---
Sure seemed a lot easier and simpler than any other master quest
---
*cries in s8*
---
Yes, it's from an irl vlog he did

zulrah uniques are tied to scale price

I'd pick up some subtle OSRS merch. That white polo with the "RS" stones isn't bad.
---
Working fine on my pixel - may be isolated to certain phones or OS versions.
---
No I don't, you're just a dick.
---
How did that go?
---
Works fine on my phone. Fix your phone.
---
Yes but the quest also had to do with the dagon'hai and they weren't just tossed in some random dungeon they had a reason to be there.
---
Bring back 1.5t actions to zalcano, then. Most skills in the game atm have the option to make them more enjoyable through tick manipulation.
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
Was doing Ammonite Crabs and recently started NMZ for training. I guess I need to keep running Barrows. I don't know that I'd called myself skilled. XD
---
That's true, although I wish it were a more difficult questline to make up for it, or a more difficult slayer monster IMO
---
off task :D
---
serp has upkeep of like 200k gp per hour though, so ye serp helm if you use it lets say 500 hours, thats a 100m upkeep cost.
---
On the job... pfft... sure
---
*sees 1 rc*
---
Hmm okay I believe you.
---
It was against the Bucs, I wanna see how he does against the Vikings in two weeks

Also, I'm scared of PKers when it comes to Wildy bosses lol.
---
Shit I remember finding a loot pile of full rune with the kite and 800 noted yews by the bridge to barb village back in like 06 and I fuckin lost it. At the time I had like 60k bank 😂
---
Yeah I’ve heard that they can appear faster than they’re ever banned.. it sucks that a game has to succumb to that :( 
---
Thanks friend, that’s actually a really useful guide! That’ll be the first thing I get started on :D legend 👍
---
Okay. It's like a big maybe
---
Made 1.2mil from it, but tried to flip it again and lost 300k
---
What? Screenshots on 10 series don't show the camera cutout, my screen is the same as OP's, but the camera hole is just to the left of the icons.
---
&gt; At Cox people camp the serp helm for the poison immunity.
---
lmfao this is so untrue. People bring 1 sanfew if theres a shaman room.
---
Nice!
---
I feel like it makes sense for a niche item that needs to be charged to work. Its pretty expensive in itself and requires scales to function so adding another arbitrary level req seems unfitting especially since the item you craft is essentially the item but you dont need to create something intricate like you would with lets say like dragonhide

The puzzle is literally just the game Mastermind. You're saying a game that's almost 5 decades old is bad. I got it on my first try even because I've played Mastermind plenty of times.
---
Training 80-90 prayer using mostly regular dragon bones I achieved a little over 400k XP/hr.  This was using the 1 invent + suicide method.
---
In total I probably lost 2-3 invents of bones to pkers.
---
To minimise the amount of bones lost:
---
Don't train at busy times of day
---
Wear 3 good defensive items (I took full torags, but if you're a non-ironman you can probably buy something better)
---
Keep prayer on at all times (I use prot mage / piety / rapid heal / protect item)
---
Be ready to log out immediately when running to the altar
---
If somebody attacks you just ignore them and finish using your bones, you'll probably finish your invent before they can PK you
---
I cant afford that right now - guy with t bow
---
Exactly. Mods have already stated that non-bot goldfarmers are the majority in Zulrah. The rise of prices is purely speculation and merching, based on people gossiping that they will put higher requirements on Zulrah. Something Jagex has already ssaid they didn't want to
---
Yes, of course. Right now they have a drop worth tens of millions of gp, and in less than a month that drop will be worth whatever it's high alch price is. The first few days after release all new content is totally swamped for a while.
---
Yea I thought I was a so badass wit my rune G and fletching cape lmao
---
How do you know that’s not what he’s doing?
---
dont vote yes then, they told you exactly what you were voting for
---
I'm just saying, they can add something new to thieving that people will actually want to do, not just to get 99 and forget about the skill entirely. Maybe a nice mini game where you break Into a mansion and go room to room avoiding guards and if you get seen you go back to the start. Then at the end you get rewards or points and are able to spend it on various things.
---
Again. Poor justification. It might not be responsible for crashing it but it won’t help it.
---
This is what I never understood about /r/2007scape's NEET infestation. You never have anything useful to add or counter with, just snide remarks, sarcastic delusions, deflection, worst of all are the slippery slope fallacies that you creatures love so much. Kind of like the one above.
---
Basically anything you can come up with the avoid refuting the central point of the argument, and to prop yourself up and give yourself a pat on the back. You've accomplished nothing with that drivel. It's already been vomited out of someone else's keyboard hundreds of times over the last week. NEETs are nothing if not predictable.
---
What are you going to do ?
---
Looks like the rs community is starting to post.
---
With runelite and osbuddy down they have some free time to draw
---
Just bought a new phone and it doesn’t go to the edges :/
---
That’s it???? What is your rsn I attend house parties everyday for portals
---
I think the current 20m price will fall quickly below the price of the serp helm. SERP helm is still useful in zulrah, raids, tanking bandos, solo situations
---
On top of the other posts...you should probably sell some of that BiS gear and invest in higher prayer unless your some sort of pvp build.
---
If anyone is in doubt: these guys are lying and probably trying to sell some badly coded bot. Really disappointed in SirPugger just assuming they speak the truth with little to no evidence. Anyone capable of making a bot that doesn't get banned fast enough for them to be able to make this kind of profits would not like their methods and/or their existence to be publicly known.
---
I hate you. Look at my flair.
---
That’s what I ended up doing, though it’s not a true safespot.
---
Is there a new slay helm????
---
That's reckful lmao
---
Pretty cool that Harry Potter used the Basilisk idea from RuneScape
---
I’ve done MM. I’ve done frem trials and isles. I just don’t have the stats to equip yet.
---
I agree.  I'm talking about skills like woodcutting and fishing which are basically "do the same thing over and over from level 60 onwards". Like literally no skill or variation (unless you count being able to stare at a screen a long time and use a mouse without getting hand cramps as some bizarre classification of "skill")
---
It predicted a higher result than actually occurred.
---
Yeah, Pugger saying "oh, but I said that botting is bad so I'm definitively not advertizing form them" reminds me of those "Smoking Kills" mentions on cigarettes packs.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if either cheatlite or osbotty made a plugin for this
---
tf, shes not being manipulated by the dems, you lot are a bunch of fucking clowns making that almost baseless assumption.

"Eliminate safe spot" - how long have you been playing runescape? Safe spotting has been a massive part of training/pve since day 1.

both are there for the same reason

Protecting their own asses.
---
1m still couldn't get you the whip though, which was the thing to have back in the day.

So maybe 50m in osrs vs 5m back in the day.

People really paid 40m for it
---
Just 3 item so you dont lose it and the pkers dont get anything
---
Because the option was ''add a cool new helmet, but make it render any other helmet obsolete'' or ''don't add cool new helmet''.
---
Mod Wolf even responded that they could poll it with different str bonuses, but the team liked +6 more so they're just sticking to it
---
Definitely
---
For sure. It was good times! I could've done some serious skilling like get 99 construction, but barraging in cw was so much more fun for me haha
---
It’ll definitely stabilize more in the 7-8m range
---
I'm not saying we should return, I'm just using that as counter example to people who say "we are dog eat dog because evolution makes us so". That argument is just as bad.
---
I'm also not talking about feudalism: feudalism is when you have a large land owner whom people work for.
---
There was around the 15th to 17th century some time with elaborate guild structures in the large cities and this saw a great improvement of overall wealth. I think having such a society is better used as baseline to build up on (there's still a lot of bad things in those times, but I think we can do better).
---
I’m in.
---
I remember as a kid some guy gave me like, 1m or so for no reason and I kept telling my friend I had "infinite gold"
---
J Y Z Z B R A H
---
I wanted it, I just thought it could have been left at +5 where they both have 50/50 uses. Venom vs Tribrid+Non degradeable
---
I also think a lot of people expected the basilisks to be somewhat like demonics, not what they are rn
---
Yep I realized it's the same for me, it just shifts the entire UI over
---
What ever you do, do not click this link to my zulrah log at 3k kc https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d5o1w1/ive_never_gotten_a_pet_under_drop_rate_so_please/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

But can u show me your collection log tho? I wanna see how many uniques/pets u got at almost 22k kc xD
---
nah not really for no reason. As a huge supporter of gay rights I’d like to actually clarify people’s stance on the subject.
---
Nearly everyone that wasn’t being a troll took issue to the fact that;
---
1) This was the first unpolled event in the history of OSRS, we didn’t want it to set a precedent. Prob wouldve passed a poll too.
---
2) Nobody wants real life issues in their fantasy mideval game. To many its an escape, no need to bring politics or raising awareness to anything in a game like OSRS. What did the event even accomplish? What was it even supposed to accomplish?
---
3) When faced with the backlash we got the treatment RS3 gets when they take issue with something so that pissed everyone off even more.
---
then it got out of hand
---
If you asked brundt about which shield to use he explains that the neitiznot roundshield won't work, and that you'll have to get one by farming dags in the waterbirth island dungeon.
---
Good riddance.  The BiS melee helm never should have switched from a unique, memorable, sleek norse helmet to an ambiguous green snake coif.  I prefer when staple high-tier gear has an iconic aesthetic.  The kind of thing that looks cool when modeled and used in VRChat, for example.
---
You're projecting lol
---
You're right on the money, my man. Rune sets were 200k and anyone wearing one was a beast.
---
Well the obvious problem, if the pvp part of the community is significantly smaller than the rest, is that this idea gives them an insane amount of power
---
Personally I like the choice between slower, afk safespotting while I watch youtube or Netflix, or paying attention and meleeing with piety flicks for much faster kills. The reason for why you don't remove it even if its not efficient is because not everyone plays the game the same way.
---
I just sold one for 29m 20 minutes ago
---
it's twitter tho isn't it already majorly toxic? 
---
basically those people have issues n no subscriptions so they rly need therapy nd self love
---

No unfortunately. Tell him to install it onto a flash drive.
---
Fremmy quest info
---
1) Is there a way to dig up planted trees without cutting them down first? I tried just using the spade on the tree but it wouldnt work but I dunno if theres something special you can do to do that.
---
2) Does RCing in the abyss give additional xp per craft or is it just better xp/hr from the fact that banking is faster?
---
That's cuz back then we weren't all about efficiency and grindscape. Who cares if you did or didn't have 99 con. If you were having fun goofing around with your mates exploring wilderness in adamant platebody, mithril legs and rune scimmy then that was a ton better than grinding useless construction.

Thanks

I'd recommend doing Slayer until you get broad bolts, getting base 60s melee and get to 61 range, this will definitely speed up your ability to do barrows, you may be able to do it now and camp there but it's not going to be as efficient.
---
Botters find a method then build accs for it. Other people will see the demand for accs with these levels and start creating them in mass to sell to botters aswell.

I would rather be a small guy then a fat neck-bearded troll any day of the week.
---
Back in the day they did quests like these **without** custom graphics. It was all about the story, mapping/area design, dialogues and npc looks with the in game features.
---
Now they try to make most things unique. **We can have quests that cost you shit and still have fun jamflex**
---
Tbh I think it would have made more sense to just copy and paste the Jormungand mechanics to the Knights, that way they literally aren't just something you can basically afk with Mage Pray on unless you want to get smacked for a 50. Ye they still wouldn't be difficult but considering they drop a BIS item it would at least made sense to give them some kind of mechanic that isn't as simple as just face tanking melee and praying Mage.
---
Im not saying its not doable, but the whole consept that they are able to do so instantly just bugs me so much
---
This wasn't polled ;_;

Welcome to the internet pal. Where everyone has an opinion and you’re not required to be nice about it.

i distinctly remember having a whip, a full set of gear (probably just rune with obby shield and maybe a fighter torso) and 900k gp back in the day and i thought i was a fucking baller.

also not allowed

Are you trying to suck up? Did you really feel the need to say theyre cool and handsome people? Lmaoo
---
This has quickly become my favorite meme of all time.
---
this sounds identical to when me and my friends hang out
---
No one said anything about the entire game. They could do it just for bones. I think your claim that it would add lag is questionable as well. We play the game now with little lag, adding one more server call for bones on altars only wouldn't have a huge effect.
---
the fastest way to train it is still to disassemble augmented gear at lv 10.
---
siphoning skilling gear is a slower way to train it, but cheaper.
---
Go do barrows for like 2 hours.

🦀🦀🦀CONTEST WINNERS GIVEN PRIZES🦀🦀🦀
---
Find something that irks everyone but isn't discussed that much and come up with a good solution to it.
---
People like images too so putting a little bit of artistic work to demonstrate might help.
---
&gt;Its litterally not the same thing though.
---
it is though, this is like when people through the quest helper add on in vannila wow was cheating, there is practically no difference between an quest helper plugin and watching a guide on YouTube that tells you what buttons to press. 
---
&gt;If i joined osrs in 2019 just to see the client litterally guiding me through every bit of content in the game, id be disappointed
---
lucky for people like you you're able to disable all that shit if you don't want it, just like you can not watch videos if you don't want it.
---
&gt;i guess the reddit sheep have just gotten too used to cheating
---
guides are not cheating, just because you disagree doesn't make everyone else sheep.
---
&gt;Sure, fix interfaces and engine, but having a solution in the client is never healthy. Which other game does that?
---
world of warcraft, with its add on system is effectively the same as runelites plugins and they're all made by the players, wow has been far more successful too dispite it's horrible content droughts and updates, it still boasts a far larger active playerbase throughout that.
---
in the end, all of rune lites plugins custom or not are optional, you don't need to use them and most are turned off by default, which is the same as it is optional to smash through quests fast with slayermusiq, figure it out yourself or suffer with soul.
---
and before you mention the clue shit, people have been using add-ons(with a 3rd party clue solver too) and guides for that since the dawn of time
---
Pet rock? I don’t remember anything about a pet rock or any adventures we may have had.

Shut the fuck up

SKILL RE BALANCE
---
lots of complaining and little to no solutions. Fixing pvp is not as hard as people think it is. The problem jagex has is that they are not looking at pking from a competitive aspect. Look at the way MOBAS such as Smite balance things. For starters, nerfing a Gmaul spec usuage is stupid because the problem with the weapon is that it can 100-0 people, which is what it was designed to do. How do you mitigate that from happenening at all levels? its simple, lower the base stats. Lowering the base stats effects its end game kill potential while minimizing the effects on early game potential. 
---
Anyways thats besides the point. IF pvp wants to be revived you have to look at its current meta. Low risk pures that can 100-0. Defense is literally useless in pvp, and most new players build defense. The simple work around to this issue is re balancing defense. My proposal is this:
---
Defense now has a % damage mitigating based on its level, and the armor being worn. Each level can offer a .12% base physical damage mitigation, and a .1% magical damage mitigation. 
---
Armor also provides mitigation, including hides and robes.
---

Range gear could have same bonuses, up to rune. Similarily void could be the same up to mithril/adamant since it already provides a boost to defense. Giving it rune level mitigation will make it too strong.
---
On a similar note Attack should function as an armor penetration function and not just a chance to hit. It could possibly provide .1% armor penetration per level, so as to ignore the mitigation properties of defense, as well as its flat value.
---
The reason I propose this is because there really isn't any variety in builds. By making something other than damage viable you open the doors for different build paths, as well as more wealth and players introduced to the pvp community. Armor will now be incentivized to be worn.
---
On a side note, we need more early to mid game content because all this late game content is doing nothing to bring new players in. No one looks at monkey madness two and says " im going to invest 100 hours of my life just to do that quest". If you want more pvpers, make the base game more appealing by introducing more quest, gear, mini games, and bosses that new players and casual players can access.

Wrong subreddit to have conservative views.  Didn't you know osrs is filled with kissless virgin BernieBot NPC 26 year olds still living with their parents.

I’m an iron man. Btw. But no I didn’t anyway. I just don’t think a BiS melee/tribrid helm should eventually crash to 500K. Currently it’s also 30M.

Shut the fuck up (2)

Imagine if jagex got their inspiration from cartoons

I did something similar before osrs came out. I had a couple santa hats I had bought before I quit, sold them and just rocked castle wars for like a week straight. Shit was fun.

Also,

Gz!
---
Yes this would be nice. Something with a reward system to not just get experience.
---
Lmao and they aren’t well thought out by his own admission. Just a vomit of ideas on the page
---
I don't think serp will remain useful in any of those situations because justiciar is better for tanking and nezzy faceguard is better for general purpose, and an antivenom by itself is cheaper per hour then using the serp antipoison ability. Only when you need antivenom and inventory space is at an extremely high premium will serp see some use but I think those situations will be scarce.
---
Yes! It really happened!
---
Shut the fuck up dearie
---
I suppose there is a difference between a 10m bank value and a 10m cash stack. 10m bank value took me like 2 weeks of being a member (runecrafting was my favourite skill) but 10m cash took me a while.

As soon as the dialogue said "Charm" alarm bells starting going off in my head

You were balling if you had full rune in f2p back in the day.

I've been mining rune ores in f2p wildy for about 2 months now. Spotted more than 10 lvl 3 bots already, none of them banned after I reported them. They literally only have mining xp, some of them lvl 90.

He wasnt using 3 alts tho, he was using 1 and hiring 2 othr runners

How can I do that on my iPhone though, don’t have a pc

That doesn't sound right. Maxed your combat level is melee based.

fuck that bird yo

Why does competitive LMS not have rotations like bounty hunter? U.S  players haslve wo options at the moment: Either play the Australian world with 300 ping or play the UK world with 200 ping. I'm fairly decent at trobridding but I cant win when the odds (ping) are stacked against me
---
No it doesnt only matter to irons you dumbass
---
I used to like a decade ago in rs2 but i havent touched it since i came back 2mo ago

But does that mean I can use it 4 times then sell it, and buy another for the same price? Profit here I come

That's the OG spiky armor
