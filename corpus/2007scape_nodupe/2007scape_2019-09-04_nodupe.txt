Yeah those have been going on for so long lol

Yes

So are you saying you don't like dominating your lane in league, thus making your enemy feel bad? I know the example is a bit off, because in league he went into the game because he wanted to fight you, but hear me out. 
---

---
Sometimes it's just fun to win for the sake of winning. A lot of games ultimately comes very little down to skill, yet it's still fun to win. If you're 12-0 in your lane you don't find the game boring or worry about your opponent not having fun, you're just enjoying the feeling of being in the top of the game. 
---
I don't think you can compare this to bullying, it's more comparable to having fun at someone's expense, and if that's your definition of ''enjoying to make someone feel bad'', then yes, I do enjoy making people feel bad. It's never as fun being the bud of the joke as it is to make the joke, but most people are able to laugh at their own expense too. If someone makes fun of my voice cracking, it mildly annoys me, but I can still laugh at it. 
---
If you kill some naked dude, you find it amusing because you've caused them a mild inconvenience, similar to taking someones pen and having them look under the table for 5 seconds before giving it back. 
---
If you look at the game rust, it's literally all about killing people and setting them back, and a lot of people find that fun. It's not always about big loot or a fair fight, it can be fun to just defeat someone in games. 
---
Targeted harassment of a player is wrong and comparable to bullying, but killing someone ones because they were in your proximity really isn't. I can understand you not finding it fun, but I really can't understand your lack of acknowledgement to the fact that some people can find it amusing.
---
They only really banned the betting bots when people started to really complain about them on reddit. Tbh the rng bots are the easiest example. Their name literally tells you they’re a bot yet Jagex was super slow banning them until they figured out a system that worked. We need a similar system for all of the bots. Something that just works better.

Joke of the day goes to you

Well early on in this server a blue was going for as high as 20m. I could've seen it get out of hand especially now that the online players are 4x higher than when rares were originally spawned across the map in mid 2013.
---
Nice
---
The prolly playing WOW
---
Don’t think he’ll be able to complete rfd. But he can get some better gloves.
---
I think it's because amylase is stackable, so you can do 27 potions per inventory instead of 14.
---
Lowers and elites excluding long seem to have gained. Pickaxe is up and axe is steady. I think both pickaxe and axe are still about as rare as an xmas cracker currently is on rs3. I suspect they lose a lot of status because they don't have the mental satisfaction of knowing they'll only get rarer.
---
it's in the comments here, link was just fucked up.
---
After all the feedback i decided to kill hill hiants in the dungeon bu the GE. I really havent done alot of grinding. Done tons of quests that provide XP to shoot me up. Finding out food is exspensive to buy at my level though. Cooked mest doesn't cut it and my fishing is only level 3.
---
You have 99 fishing with those baiting skills?
---
Meet repost. My YouTube locked post that will beat reddits toughest challenge. Trying to get karma of something that's been seen 15 times
---
I mean anyone that needs a thesaurus to understand their statement doesn't have an opinion worth anything.
---
In those safe worlds the rest if the map should be open PVP, lvl 3-126 multicombat zones. Its only a fair tradeoff I reckon.

If you can max your account in a month due to huge amounts of IRL money, that's a massive unfair advantage to people who don't have lots of IRL money.

Thing is, words might be just words but letting words go unchecked can lead to mentalities and eventually actions. Words are incredibly powerful my dude.
---
Can we increase loot time after kills by 5 seconds as game progresses? 
---
At the later stages it is impossible to loot your kill and open key, before someone attacks you, leaving you at a disadvantage for the whole fight.
---
*laughs in redwood trees*
---
oh awesome thanks
---
Already doing this @28 aoe farming mobs only
---
Oof. You need some better fishing stat. Try to get up to 30 fishing and 25 cooking so you can do fly fishing for salmon right next door at the barbarian village- those heal for 9 and there's a campfire right next door for easy cookin's.
---
Already did waterfall and i will do witches potion for HP. Thanks
---
While I generally agree with your sentiment, Jagex sold OSRS on the fact that it was a love letter to the community and it's actions were based off of community feedback. I don't think they should have to poll everything, but when they've polled just about everything it's a little weird when they choose not to.
---
That being said, the people saying Jagex can't be trusted at all seem to just be hyperbolic jackasses. Like they created a game most of y'all sunk countless hours over a decade in, and you don't think they know a thing or two about design?
---
Right. I just mean if he works towards the goal he'll get a lot of important quests done along the way.
---
Ok thanks
---
if you need to ask you probably can’t do vorkath tbh lol
---
I second this, then Knights of Ardounge after that. Black Jack is worse than RC imo......Pyramid Plunder is a nice change of pace.
---
what are your stats?
---
Like armor sets for us f2p noobs?
---
Yeah, I wish OSRS has stuff like the Dragonkin lore and Nex and all that. Those questlines were some of my favorite before I quit RS3.

But if weight is an issue couldn't be just note the pickaxe until he needs it?

The issue is that people are referencing a show from the 90s when they were born in the 00s
---
Combat with rock/sand/ammonite crabs. You can go 10 mind with auto retaliate on before needing to reset.
---
What's so funny?
---
Boosts tick down on a global timer, and Runelite will show this timer once one of your boosts starts wearing off. For instance, take a sip of a cheap potion like a super defence. After your defence level starts to drop, Runelite should start a timer counting down from 60 until your next stat drop, and all of your stat boosts will work on that same timer. That means you can retain the +2 boost for at most 60 seconds, or 90 seconds if you have the Preserve prayer. If you think you can craft an inventory of double cosmics in this time, go for it. Otherwise I'd recommend either going for 1-2 more RC levels, or just doing the RFD Evil Dave subquest to unlock spicy stew, which are useful for literally the entire rest of the game to boost for diary requirements and other miscellaneous things.
---
I’d fuck with a cutlass
---
Im still playing btw &lt;3 and it was 120hr work :P btw not 1000s :P my acc isnt even 1000hrs old :D i stream too @ twitch.tv/blu3\_1nk
---
For sure, I don't have a problem with most accents, but his and the hcim but pvp guy are just unwatchable for me because their accents and pitch of their voice is like nails on a chalk board to me.
---
Ah, I like that idea. Thanks!
---
Mm2 was worse than ds2 imo. If it weren't for safe spots and flinching I think glough would be insanely difficult.
---
Galvek was a much easier fight just longer
---
It's ok, there's some expensive stuff for pures though (granite hammer, obsidian maul, those amulets that are better than the glory, etc).
---
ITT: OP has 99 hunter from all this baiting.
---
Imagine consuming content because you like the person behind it and not the content itself lmao.
---
Don't worry Verf, I'll keep watching your videos as long as they're entertaining because I never gave a shit whether or not you were a massive scumbag. The second they're shit though, I'm out.
---
Laughing my runecraft off
---
ALMOST AGREE. Guthans helms beats it out by one point. tasseys get a close 2nd place, and veracs helm a 3rd.
---
It's definitely interesting how the Dark Lord and the Shard of Seren are the same character, but OSRS's take is infinitely more interesting and memorable.
---
chance of parasites though
---
I have up at 3.5k no pet meh
---
You obviously don’t undertand how pking works. You’re going to have a chat with them before you attack them? Otherwise there’s no way to know what’s going on- besides the fact that you’re fighting someone in a BH WORLD.
---
Cash app is not a bank and will not chargeback payments.
---
It doesnt really matter. Especially in honor pking. Your armor doesnt reduce the max hit of your opponent, so while you might do less dps, or  be less accurate, all you really need is a well timed spec + a vengance to K0 someone, even if theyre in super good gear.
---
Since you pretty much have infinite chances to kill someone.
---
It matters more in places like deep wildy where the goal is to wear an opponents supplies out.
---
man makes good videos tbh..
---
I have an XPS 13. The thermal throttling on those things is so bad that it gets red hot playing osrs.
---
Oh. I think that should be changed.
---
even more ppl speak spanish in the game :)
---
Depends on the combat bracket. At 70 defence this is true, but at 45 or 42? Pure still shreds.
---
You can't dispute cash app unless it is because someone hacked your account. Your best bet is filing a police report and trying to find the real identity of the scammer.
---
Take my upvote
---
What so it doesn’t actually work? ☹️
---
45 out dpses a pure anyday as long as they have vengeance and decent def bonuses.
---
Voiders are more 60/40 in terms of dps
---
Damnit spoiler
---
Lmao piety pures are broken? Not like they take the most time and effort out of any account to make lmao

Is there a good guide of what to do after becoming member?

Yeah this guy is real helpful, ty again man thanks

I just hit 77 runecrafting, so my rc life will become a lot easier from here

Swiftkit is literally a webpage that loads the client essentially. The same way the official launcher works. It does nothing to reverse engineer or modify the client nor does it inject anything the way the cheat clients that are allowed on OSRS do, that is why it trips nothing.
---
Ya know wbat that means boys 3rd age bow

That's the real issue. Runescape has always had silly cosmetic items, the difference is you never used to be able to override normal gear with them

At this point its survival of the fitness boy

Personally suggest doing all clues and not trading in for masters. Reason being is the completion goals for clues are:
---
* Easy: 500
---
* Medium: 400
---
* Hard: 300
---
* Elite: 200
---
* Master: 100
---
And elites are by far the hardest to come by. If you do all your regular clues you can expect to get something like 70+ of those masters just as rewards from the clues. So finishing all them up first and then beginning to hand them in is optimal in my play experience (I've only got 120 elites left to do on that list and I'm at 55 masters having handed no clues in. I should expect 1 master every 5 elites, so I've got 24 left from there).
---
But with that said if you want to continue doing slayer or bossing etc and not take the time to do the clues. Or you come to a step you can't complete and the grind to complete it is too long, handing in is a great option then
---
Also didn't replace jelly-fishing glasses with half-moon spectacles. 4/10.

How many mils did you make?

All I want is for people to consider he most likely already has it, which is why people should stop claiming that he «most likely» doesnt have it or that verf «most likely» got it first.
---
He has done 304 imps, there is a 85% chance he already has it. Sire its not very dry at all he moght not have gotten it yet but everyone is acting like there is no way he does which is wierd to me, but ut lets just wait for the video and find out.

Yup. I'm thinking of the other skills for rewards. Editing post

I finished the desert diary a few weeks ago, other than the KQ kills for head, what's so hard about it?

The 91 fishing grind for Morytania elite was far more tedious than anything in Desert.

Don’t be mean, its obvious he’s not smart enough for math.

Especially since this started out as “it gets more afk” lmao
---
Ppl nowadays can’t wait for a known person to do or say something wrong just to cancel them. We all have done shit. We are not perfect!!!

I know how to do it right, but it is still slower than most other puzzles.
---
cute!
---
Staff of the dead looks so cool tho. Much better than some generic red/black zamorak shit. Its pale and actually looks like death.
---
Base 90 CBS and minimum 78. Not really excessive as it is end game content
---
I never had a problem with people asking that; granted I don't follow buzzfeed kind of platforms.
---
I think he thought I meant like 90 base all round stats aha, I worded it poorly.
---
How long is a kill approx? And hoe often do you bank? Trying to figure out gp/h
---
I mean it helps for all useable stats in a big way so I guess worded poorly or nah it still works
---
Nah only once and it felt so good that i never touched it again. I am friends with a dude on discord named cocaine. He legit does it everyday. I know what your talking about but it aint me.
---
Very true my dude, very true.
---
Literally me at anything related to carpentry, lol.
---
Never played WoW, world hopping isn't a thing?
---
Farm yanllian hops. Can get like 100-150k. In 5minutes. Low level farm level needed. Can do it every hour.
---
Prims also give attack and defense bonuses
---
People in this gear are most likely rushing and not planning on dying (and most of the time they won’t if they know what they’re doing). If you aren’t gonna die you might as well be in max gear esp if you’re doing this for hundreds of hours those extra bonuses make a difference in getting the kill or not.
---
Restarted the laptop and after plenty of updating is running very smoothly now, thanks to everyone.
---
Plus if you hurt it and another monster kills your target it counts as your kill
---
pures shred voiders.

---
I don't see any reason that would lead me to believe they nerfed this item. You can get a cape that provides a +6 Prayer bonus for free, doubt they would change the stats to a cape that costs 650M, barely anyone owns, and that is mostly only used in outfits and not combat.

Ummm I guess for slayer? Or for anything weak to crush? Cuz one is faster but less str but fastet

Its also like 1k rc xp/h. 99 here I come.

Yeah it's mostly obby pures with neck and cheap gold versions of d hide. "Let me have massive advantage on you and risk nothing plz"
---
Half moon spectacles are bae
---
It works out better for taking less damage than Dragonhide really
---
Why would you repost the phishing link?
---
far out i remember when that quest was first released. i helped write the old runeHQ guide on the path through the slums, and even took a screenshot of the fireplace smokestack having an object ID of 'null'.

Felt so cool back then.

Better bring half my bank just in case

Nah but if he says something and I see the symbol I’d back off

It’s fun/nostalgic. I almost bought one until my friend let me borrow his, and it didn’t seem worth eventually losing money to have it.
---
Yeah I probably will burn out, I don't fight it. If I'd rather stop and do something else I will. Before this I was working on modding escape velocity nova.

I dunno if rs3 has splashing but it is really useful for low level magic training.

4m, that’s cute..
---
Yeah, I bought it and tried it on a few slayer tasks before I sold it. It was cool but I think the money could be better spent on other items and skills.
---
Where is the uncharged scythe better dps then a rapier on tasks?
---
Alt-f4
---
I'm mostly joking, my first ever username for RS had the number I wore for sports at the end. But now a days I have to have a unique name, drives me crazy if I have numbers
---
Actually I def agree with you. It’s so bizarre to me how powerful pures are. Stats are so much more important than gear. If you are on a maxed account with absolute max strength, the max possible hit with an AGS is an 83.
---
At 99 strength, a pure with 70k risk (strength ammy, Fire cape, mith gloves and c boots) can hit a *68*. Going up 20 combat levels and 100+m gear only increases your max hit by 22%!!
---
Hi
---
What a douchebag. Go do a solo raid and get a whole tbow now man good luck
---
sorry man, that sucks. Lesson learned! if it seems to good to be true, it probably is.
---
How did they scam you? Just not give you money?
---
But I want my name to have the numbers
---
Fair enough.
---
He's serious lol
---
Can the dialogue for getting ale yeast be streamlined a bit more or have put into a store interface instead?
---
I heard this (and tried it) except it was White Knights.
---
What is that game? Maplestory?
---
Only if jagex offers daily membership prices.
---
My personal AFK ones are:
---
- woodcutting, extremely chill, gotta tap every couple minutes or so
---
- fishing, same as above
---
- sandcrabs or such for combat
---
- splashing magic, most afk of all, click once every 15 minutes
---
It's always been viable but you should really be using Trident instead.
---
is that the quest where u have to make it through a maze of run down buildings or something?
---
This is incorrect. They hit with magic based melee, so you want to have high magic defense bonus
---
yeah you're thinking of C Engineer. 
---
Sucks you got downvoted cos you're entitled to your opinion. But I know where you're coming from. i also found it very off putting with their earlier videos where their accents were a lot stronger. In more recent times though both Verf's and C Engineers' accents have grown on me and the content they produce is really good and original
---
I mean the random events used to be a method where it would attack or teleport afk people from where they were.... so it was kinda true?
---
The entire quest is supposed to be you doing terrible things to get through the pass.
---
Spoiler: you're the baddie
---
Quests are a great way to start out. Good rewards, xp, bit of lore, and gets you exploring.
---
SHEEP SHEARER.
---
Never. Again.
---
He logged out, and then left the WDR Discord
---
Its going to be hard to find the motivation to do that
---
That sucks man, sorry that happened to you.
---
I dont see how that's a retort for what I said. I agree with you, no matter what side uses language like that it's not good for society. I was simply making a comment on the fact that words arent meaningless.
---
You're telling me you wouldn't want to raid in a chicken suit?
---
I haven’t done PP since I finished 99 thieving in early 2007, but I always just skipped every room until my last two rooms that I could do for my level. Hit everything in there, rinse and repeat.
---
Although, I’m not sure if anything about the minigame has changed since then.
---
I think I'm going to step away for the game, I refuse to grind over a year for something that was taken away from me in seconds.
---
Hungry? Haha
---
Very occasionally when you specifically want a empty bottle/glass/etc. Say for a quest or an NPC conversation.
---
People vote no because pvm'rs are being forced into the wildy to get important stuff inc dragon pick so why would they vote for when it just makes their grind harder
---
The best thing about crafting lavas is u can use them to alch yourself after
---
No doubt, hopefully it doesnt put you off too long. We can do some bossing if you want. I just reached the point where I can start actually doing that point. If interested PM me
---
This is also an alt that has completed a grandmaster quest, along with many skill reqs that my alt to many people assume its a main account.

Nah u see. It makes it good for camera shots!  Also its still like normal on worlds with pvp.

Can we get a shortcut over the bridge to the Morytania Mausoleum?  For the medium clue there.
---
Very interesting, will definitely consider doing that.

Tbh i enjoy just picking a random thing, selling it for 1gp and making 500gp or a few K
---
RS3 is that way.
---
you.... you what? Where am I, this can't be reddit

At this point, might be a good trade

Did you try turning it off and back on again?
---
Only worth it too hear the spec noise

Question is, which video did you watch first?
---
What a shit answer mate
---
It's not outrage culture to think someone is a cunt for saying what he did. It's just not being an asshole.
---
Is that that thing that I never actually did myself but bitter to 99 so I could get a chaotic crossbow and rapier?
---
Saranachis Cudgel is a good crush weapon too if you need one
---
But yeah, faster is usually better.
---
Imagine not using your irl name for your username 🤙
---
Do you not think crossbows are useful in pvp?
---
4-man is the meta
---
Augury is actually nearly as powerful, its just a bit more niche. Its real value comes from how much magic defense it gives
---
Ideas for explorer backpack? Tool collection?
---
30rc in f2p!?!? Your a beast
---
Has science gone too far?
---
Heh, interestingly I actually made a thermy guide that I never published as a fun little project (tried to keep it under 1 minute length). [See if it helps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2gKkoEtQ3I&amp;feature=youtu.be). Basically the meta is to walk under and trade 1:1 hits using redemption to make trips longer.
---
DHL is highly recommended in CoX solos because it can ban used to tekton, vasa, and olm. Also it's better than scythe at olm in some cases depending on hammers, but it's mostly prefered because it makes it 10x easier to set up the solo methods (4:1, 3:1, 1:0, etc etc, it's just way easier to get into a cycle with a 4t weapon). I can't really tell you the specifics of when scythe beats lance at olm because there are so many variables, but if you're not doing CM scythe is gonna always be better I believe (not 100% certain here).
---
Off the top of my head uncharged scythe is decent at kalphite warriors, gargoyles, and dark beasts. There are probably some others but I can't think of any right now.
---
Are you considering purchasing  a scythe by any chance, or just trying to decide where to use one you already have?
---
I would say the glasses where the whole point.
---
People vote no for one reason alone for e.g. we want a drag pick we have to go into wildy which we dont want to do so why would we vote yes to making our life harder. When they stop forcing us into the wildy people will vote for pures. It like the option to pk should be option not you need to go in and get it and chance to die and loose all your stuff some people myself included play for pvm not pvp yet forced to fight or flee
---
Of course. But those are also easy skills, and buyable in the case of fletching and prayer.
---
Fishing is not a tedious skill. Agility, RC at lavas, mining to an extent. Those are tedious.

Diary Cape
---
I get what youre saying, but 80k is fuck-all risk when you consider supplies alone cost 2/3 of that lol. d boots, b gloves, etc are gonna be worth far more than a pure would risk normally. 
---
I miss the 04-06 days, when there were still very new people playing and pking, you got people pking in all sorts of gear and setups. It may technically be a little more diverse now with whats known, however its more so that no one is "new" anymore. Everything is tick manipulating, 1 shot stacks or clanmanmode. Its more boring. And not saying picking on the noobs was more "fun" so to say, but idk. I dont PvP now since i started up in mid december, whereas from 01-07 thats all i did was pk.

using it on a vial when doing gwd with a group.

I'm not the one crying about a video game update I didn't like seven years after it happened.
---
That's the thing, though. You're playing your T1 deck because you want to win, not because you want to make someone feel bad. You're tired of losing, so you play a deck and win, and you feel good because now you won a game. When you smurf (in your example) and flex on low elo, you do it because you like winning and destroying people, not because "lol these bronzies are gonna feel bad after this game."
---
at least junk at the GE disappears into the void within a few minutes
---
Well in general you would never use an armadyl crossbow in pvp, so it's at least only usefully in niche pvm not pvp situations
---
&gt; not much of a redditor

You didnt censor out your name for the drop lol
---
I'm trying to complete Grim Tales for the Falador hard diary. I know what the wiki says are needed for requirements, but that doesn't account for boosts- if I'm also using boosts what stats do I actually need to grind to?
---
Um.. people use it all the time. At least 1 person has one on my daily pk trips. Yeah the dragon cross bow is a better item for the price but if you dont get smited the acb is better. It is bis. Check your facts before lying out yo ass..

 Jagex &lt;noreply@a.runescape.com&gt;     This is the email address
---
I just noticed in the GE that they have rune scimitar ornaments? What exactly do they do and are they worth the 200-250k gp price?
---
Eesh...
---
Spoofing emails is prettty simple nowadays. Jagex has had issues recently with phishing emails with spoofed addresses (like the picture above). I would recommend logging into the official Runescape website and checking your information there to see whether or not this is true. Don't click on any links in the email you received.
---
Change your password and, if you don't already, add 2FA to both your Runescape account and your Email.
---
I was still shaking cresting this post
---
As an iron meme, I take offense
---
You ruined your 100% drop rate.
---
What a shame.
---
Definitely doesn't mate, only for reg spellbook freezes ancient magic freeze times are unaffected
---
This email is only a business email i don't know how it got leaked?
---
What if my name is PK Fire and I dress up as a little kid with a massive beating stick?
---
Yes please
---
Been to Edge recently? There is no honor pking, there is unloading your spec n going "safer" as you tab to restore it.
---
Yeah I honestly have no idea how, why or where it started but we were determined.
---
Or just do wt low hp and bank crates unless your Skilling stats are decent or you need early cash
---
Theoatrix in his most recent video explains it, if you can log out before 12 seconds and log back in and repeat then it’ll last indefinitely, just an annoying way to do it
---
You telling me "420 69" is a bad name?
---
So this is what they're doing in Taverley Dungeon...
---
Okay so my question is, how does the mark of grace have a GE Value? Anyone care to explain lol
---
Average person on this sub still has their mommy cleaning the house.
---
Yeah its kind if a flawed system. Starting out witha full setup = sweaty games and starting out with nothing = too slow? Apparently anyway. Maybe theres a healthy middle ground
---
You might need some kind of mental therapy. An accent *physically* hurts you? Yeah, get that checked out..
---
Didn't know this was a thing for the wiki, feel dumb now.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
1. Nobody is perfect is ok. Not an excuse for horrible behavior. People are pushing the definition for horrible behavior further and further. Agree or disagree with what's happening, people can and do demand changes be made by high profile individuals. What's wrong with holding those sorts accountable for their public actions that can serve as a poor example? 
---
2. He very recently said those words. I didn't see anybody in this thread brining up old shit from 30 years ago, and this dude clearly hadn't changed considering his apology.
---
This. Having just black dhide significantly improves your chances of survival since they'll be missing a lot more freezes on you. Also gives you a chance to retaliate if thats your cup of tea.
---
Stop spreading fake news
---
Are 45 dmg barrages reasonable in pvp in max mage?
---
best skill in the game!
---
Those two are the only people I've heard talk like that. Their pitch combined with the accent scrapes my eardrums raw.
---
Idc if they add them via an unlock but adding them to the list without that is going to be a hard pass. But yeah unlock like shamans is fine.
---
You take the 10 damage and the timer starts again from that point. Basically just resets the potion.
---
Apart from gold accumulator, time of frost, gem bag, totem etc...
---
That feeling when you realize you have to do a certain quest to unlock the content you want, and you already have the quest and skill requirements.
---
fuck outa here
---
My chart would just be a dot on zero.
---
Inflation.
---
Your points are given when you get kicked out, whether it be death, DC, leaving, etc., so you get the same amount of points no matter which method makes you leave.
---
Or if it's easier think about it this way - everytime you kill a boss, those points are automatically added to your account, immediately. If you kill a boss, and then 10 seconds later get kicked for 6 hour log, those points were already added so it's not like you lost anything.
---
For the desert kalphites i hop worlds till i see someone used a rope if i need to i fairy ring out and back in
---
Are you dumb? Pray mage does not affect ancient spell freeze duration
---
`a::Click` repeats clicks and isn't allowed  
---
`a::LButton`mimics the left mouse button and is allowed
---
I would but I cant be bothered to get on
---
Hardly stupid if I can actually read a wiki page whilst grinding away at my goals so I can make educated and thought out decisions 
---
And it is specified right here on this wiki page https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kalphite_Lair
---
If you are referring to the SMS bond packages on the website, that would not be usable on an ipad unless you have SMS capabilities.  My actual cell phone doesn’t work either, I get an error saying “Jagex games is not available for AT&amp;T”
---
I got my 2nd pet at 12kc. I will give it for free
---
He will be taking payments into his own account and transferring the quadrupled amount from different accounts where the details have been stolen. 
---
Does that make sense to you?
---
Ouch that's rough. Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
Its too late for OP, just based off the image if the dragon axe the guy in the background was holding, I was able to recover OP's account and disable 2fa.
---
I would like to see the change in ability from getting 99 like add the slayer ring tps to the cape ect the chance at getting the same task when having it is really shit
---
Way too obvious. There's no way you are seriously suggesting this.
---
Have you ever seen the printsn button
---
Man every time I don’t skill and bring a 1m risk I get ags specced for 70. Like what the fuck

Imo a couple of the emotes could be better but idk

Yes. Lets wait about 1.5 years for him to get the RCB from the Impling while you start bitching about "no new swampletics content"
---
Fair enough but apparently the person who triggered him was being toxic as fuck.  Not necessarily an excuse but it’s not like he’s going around throwing the gamer word at everyone.
---
So you are complaining that you have an extra dialog box to click... bruh. Why drop it anyway, more spots for loot?
---
Yeah I mean if you're looking for very afk method sure, point was that if you're making steel bars at bf which is very click intensive you're making way more profit then turning them in cannonballs.
---
Max profit?  No.  You would be better just selling the steel bars and making more in the same amount of time it would take to make the cannonballs.  Making cannonballs is extremely slow and AFK though if you want to do that while you are busy.  Other than that, yeah just do steel bars until you can do mithril then addy etc.
---
You baited ontop of the first guys bait. Not sure if you realized you both were baiting together on this one
---
Saying the words doesn’t make you either of those things. I’d venture he’s closer to a basement dweller of a gamer with anger issues and a toxic mindset.
---
It's a shame a toxic encounter could bring that out of him.

Is BF decent enough to be able to train another account on the side?

On the other hand, most (or maybe all, I don't play anymore) cosmetics in this post are free or from microtransactions, so they're not difficult to get. The gw2 items you mention however are almost all ridiculously rare and/or expensive. I think the latter is definitely preferable :-)

Thank you Verf, very cool

I'm at 6400 no pet 8 jars :))))
---
I don't like this idea, but I think this could possibly be nice for graceful clothing only. Like maybe implement a way to fuse a graceful piece with a fashionscape item (like clue scroll rewards that offer 0 stats) for x amount of marks of grace. The graceful set effect would still work, but everyone could have the opportunity to look unique.
---
We never really received training on how to use shears, so I see where things may have gone wrong.

Same state wise but not all stats are created equal. I actually came to give a real answer but saw someone else had already mentioned spells have their own max hit independent of magic stats.

Thank you very much, i thought it was something lile this but didnt know what question to ask.

how bout everyone do what the fuck they want

If some loser that sits in his room all day every day and play a point and click game is inspirational you need to wake the fuck up, these cunts wouldn’t make it 2 minutes in the real world if this game just died
---
You're clueless
---
Mage is definitely in a strange place because of how vital barrage is in PVP.
---
But the fact is, if we cap magic based around PVP balance then range will ALWAYS be king, and mage will always be trash, because range received the special privilege of not needing to give a fuck about pvp balance (think blowpipe). 
---
Eventually we will reach a point where we balance pvp and pvm seperately, because we are reaching the point where pvm power creep is pushing past what pvp can deal with.
---
Fake outrage? You keep trying to deflect or make claims for others, or play it down. I unfollowed on twitch/yt upon seeing this, there is so much content out there, there isn't a need to support people like this. 
---
Of course it isn't the end of the world, and I never claimed it was. But a lot of folks don't want to support some racist bigoted shut-in nerd playing runescape while spewing hatred.
---
It's a one thing thing to say "what's up my nigga" in private to your buddy, and another completely different thing to reply to perceived toxic behaviour in a video-game with "ur a niggerfaggot".

How difficult is SOTE? Might do it today to get qc back. Harder or easier than MM2/DS2?
---
Members is always worth it, even at level 3.
---
Very nice points. Range is fucking broken in most pvp too. I think we have already pasted the point of separate balancing with the pvp mage rolling formula change.
---
More changes like the trident for pvm would be good. In 1 def NH, mage is the most op combat style already.

Get a hydra task or two. All you need is bp and slay helm

Ah sorry, yeah the main account but it was shown in this latest Swamp vid. I wonder why it’s blurred!
---
Not wanting to watch racists/homophobes YouTube videos is not cancel culture. It's just not wanting to support them anymore.
---
Nobody is owed forgiveness, especially when they half ass their apology and clearly are only "sorry" because they were caught.

If you don't pray flick them then you have to eat more which loses ticks attacking and makes you bank more so you lose the dps you make with +6str.

It's still a hotkey system shoehorned into a game with 0.6s ticks and a tile system. It's never going to be good enough to work like WoW's/FF14 etc combat and it won't be good at what Runescape's main selling point was.

Two different clients open at the same time. Looking between them, and making sure I'm alwayys mining. I have idle notifications on to ping me if I'm not mining any more. Pretty easy to AFK. Yeah, I have to click every now and then. . But, I'm not staring the brown ass wall for hours. Haha

almost 95 rc, id rather do 99 rc twice than have to do mining
---
You have no idea what the people doing the moon landing had to do though.
---
can we get a re balance to the wildy bosses atm the best way too kill them is to safe spot them they do too much damage without there being any mechanics too them
---
If you have absolutely no cash Id get a blsck salamander and do a few barrows runs. Get some change to buy decent gear to do SotE and camp Zalcano a while (or the gauntlet and hope for a 100m drop).
---
Otherwise barrows -&gt; vorkath/zulrah.

A dragonpick would definitely aide me in going for 99 mining. However, my bank is legit only worth 1.95M. So, I'm going to be using a rune pick for a long time. Haha.

Thank you so much!

it is inconvenient and it makes no sense its the way it is, sang staff can also be charged anywhere

Ron plays games went like 4k dry, did get 99 prayer from it though

I always suck on mob with it and im mob only or team left early

Its used everyday at vorkath, so maybe do some research b4 u call something useless lol.

It'd be directly using Jagex art assets for profit so settled wouldn't be able to make and sell it.

You can already hit 45 with just a plain occult and tome risk with fire surge. Considering you'd need literal max ancestral to hit that, yea it's absolutely fair.

i mean its only useful there because it automatically 1 hits the spawn, i dont think crumble undead needs a buff/higher tier version, but vorkath isnt a good example since its basically an upgraded version already

Is there a name for these?
---
Can Gazebos in PoH's be made sitable? It'd be nice to sit in it.
---
Can combat dummies be upgradeable to have max hits vs dragons and wildy monsters, using dragonbane/wildy weapons respectfully? Could be a new higher leveled dummy or just thrown into the current undead one. I'd prefer a new one but throwing into the undead one would probably be easier from your pov.
---
Do you use an authenticator?

Hi I’m a max pure in membs. I had a lot of fun using cannon on wildy slayer tasks. It’s profitable. I also did song of the elves and other quest lines. Members is great for pures because of blowpipe and ancient Magic’s. Also with 50attack u can wield granite hammer which is insanely good compared with f2p weapons. 
---
Members is the way to go if your enjoying the game. You can make larger amount of cash with little effort. I think I make close to 1mill a day without really doing anything. Farm runs and bird runs add up, etc. 
---
I like ur acc. Stay 1def and 50attack for a while, ull enjoy it I think. I would recommend getting 43prayer through questing and then do desert treasure. It opens up the game for u! Gl
---
Might be some truth here.

Funny that you're getting downvoted for saying this. Same people who are offended by words

Not even at 2x the drop rate for the claw smh. It's not unheard of to go 10x or more dry for an item so buckle up, you may very well be looking at 10,000 kills without the claw!
---
Remember, you're not dry unless you go 10x over the drop rate and even then, you're technically no closer to getting the drop as you were on kill #1.

Nice (rip karma)

Excellent advice thank you. I was debating whether to raise attack beyond 50 but yeah I think I will stick to this plus 43 prayer. I feel I have also gotten to a point where most of my skills would raise faster in members now, getting base 60s so far was inexpensive and not too long.

Would you recommend staying 1 Def or raise up a bit?

Check the edit history. That part was added by a different user after the stats were already put on the page. With so few players having one of these cloaks, there's also going to be editors who are unable to double-check the stats for themselves when adding new details to the page.
---
As someone who mainly plays Rs3 now, it’s always so annoying to play OSRS when I forget I need to put a tinderbox / axe in my inventory for some woodcutting / firemaking
---
User clicks use shortcut
---
Server checks if grapple and cable is inventory
---
If not in inventory, check stash unit
---
If in stash unit, swap current weapon for item in stash unit.
---
Perform animation
---
Swap work cbow with  weapon in stash unit
---
Store grapple back in stash unit
---
Profit.
---
If you have 19m and buy a bcp instead of doing ba you're a bad cute noob change my mind
---
Random events were jmods
---
Glory is as early game as a fury lmao
---
Thematically could make it so the box freezes shut or something.
---
At the very least how about eliminating the need for both a crossbow and grapple by combining the two like how it was done with the [Enhanced Grappling Hook](https://runescape.wiki/w/Enhanced_grappling_hook) in RS3. Of course OSRS doesn't have the Toolbelt so that's out.
---
Basic idea, what if its turned into something similar to how Air Balloons were handled. Say we can build a 'hidey hole' of sorts at each location and manually store Crossbow's and Grapples. Then you could auto over the location while bringing the crossbow/grapple, maybe even consume them on use if we can say store 100 crossbow/grapples in each location. 
---
Some ideas.
---
On a completely unrelated note, patch notes:
---
&gt; Rework: Bandos tassets are too effective at causing melee hits to splash, making pvp less engaging. As a result, all defensive bonuses of the item are being adjusted by -10.
---
God forbid the best mage staff hits 20 damage below the best range bow

And he's obviously not *really* depressed, you can tell because he posted on Reddit

And surely it was just cuz "it's a funny meme" and not because he's sad the pop if RS has dropped drastically, and RS is definitely not an escape for him to help cope with the utter crushing weight of living in the fucking dystopia we live in...

i feel some aspects or items of the game needs to be in terms of incentive/balancing/cost etc. 
---
Armadyl crossbow doesnt warrant spending 26m on it ? Can it be slightly buffed to mitigated the significant costs in comparison to other crossbows. 
---
Perhaps , 5+ range atk and 5+ damage boost?
---
Another thing needs to be addressed is black dhide as you know has higher melee defensive stats than karils . This makes no sense as its 40 defence and karils is 70 . 
---
I suggest black dhide should have equalivalent  defensive stats to green dhide but with higher defence . 
---
Black dhide only has -6 range atk lower than an armadyl set . Its incredibly powrful for how much it costs which definately needs to be looked over.

A Diary obligates 90+5 Fletching for completion, and Zenyte jewellery has Crafting purpose well into the 90s. Construction has the lowest end-level status of these skills
---
It also depends what resolution he is running the game at and the size of his client. Makes a huge difference running resizeable on a 27" monitor VS. Fixed screen
---
It's certainly possible. If it's your first time attempting it I'd give you 50/50 odds.

ACB at 26m is fine
---
karils has higher mage defense which is more applicable than melee defense in the majority of situations
---
what does equivalent to d'hide but higher even mean?
---
anyway this thread isn't even for suggestions
---
Yeah for real mlm Isent terrible but it’s still forever

what type of news?

Ice Poseidon is irrelevant and a dead streamer

I just use travely teleport tabs

Pet is a random roll and diesnt take up a drop slot

i'm lvl 112 and still rely on house party wrld :)
---
Customer support told them to delete the original comment. Wym problem solved, right?
---
Add me in game ‘sunu’, i’ll help u out to get into the pking community
---
i remember talking to you and barb fishing together awhile back.
---
Barb Wire (plays in Whirlpool Dungeon) bops so fucking hard. If you listenz the bassline is also the main melody from Barbarian Village, that's so cool to me.
---
No the fact that they count as food is bad because you actually get the delay from eating them that you do from eating food, unlike other pots that don't interrupt an action and can be used to combo eat.
---
underrated comment
---
Lmao, you have all this gear but don’t know how to rebuild? Sounds like you’re best bet to make money is just buy gold since it appears that’s what you did last time.
---
Great picture! Keep it up man.
---
I personally think this dudes videos suck and his voice is annoying as hell. But what i hate more is people like you who get offended like little bitches when someone uses a mean word online. If the dude was pissed (which he apparentally was) then maybe he lost self control and used the word by accident.
---
I hate keyboard warriors like you, can you just understand already that nobody gives a shit that youre offended and your opinion doesnt matter. You’re a nobody, youre just whining for the sake of whining. Dave chappelle recently talked about people like you on his stand up.
---
You’re the audience.
---
What a worthless human. #next
---
That doesn't really make a difference. 1 in every 5000 tasset drops on average will have a pet with it. Therefore, it is 1 in 1.9 million to get this drop.
---
u cant go back to 60, but go what u prefer dont ask ppl about your own opinions, just stupid, if u prefer lower combat go claws 60att etc
---
What?  
---
You have TB and Surge spells. It's perfectly fine.
---
I thought this was MC Ride for a second.
---
In statistics AND means multiply and OR means add generally. 
---
So the chance of pet AND tassets would be the two numbers multiplied and the chance of pet OR tassets would be the 2 numbers added
---
What method they using to kill it?
---
You’re fun at party’s huh?
---
They arnt downvoting your for rs3 , it's the fact that nobody wants toolbox
---
werewolf, you won't need to run back all the way and like half the course you can afk since you are just watching your guy go down the zipline
---
Well actually, he does get the rune crossbow. He gets it on a barrows run along with barrows gloves.
---
This changes everything.
---
BTW buying osrs gold, and using that gold to buy a bond costs 2.4 usd atm, so you can technically get away with a five dollar per month membership still
---
How does that even happen?
---
You’re still taking the probably of both events happening at the same time. That is a multiplicative probability because they’re both binomial probability events.
---
&gt; edit:  Just to be clear I'll never defend the use of that language.  It was wrong of him to say those words in any context. My only contention is that saying some shitty things doesn't necessarily make you a shit person
---
This is where you’re going to find a lot of people  disagree with you. Intentionally using insults with homophobic and/or racist connotations demonstrates to me that you are ok with those things. That is such an extreme lack of moral character that, yes, this does necessarily make him a shitty person. A fucking video game drove you to use those words? And we aren’t talking a 16 year old here. 
---
I’m curious as to what it would take for you to consider someone a ‘shitty person’
---
It sounds here as if you’re the keyboard warrior, sir.
---
Anyone should be above this
---
I recently started paying classic WoW, and it's really opened my eyes to what good customer support looks like. Email, web chat, phone support. And they're incredibly helpful. They help you find old accounts, unban hacked ones, return lost or stolen items, pretty much anything. Can you imagine jagex having a phone number??
---
2007scape lul
---
Exactly, even with 2fa someone could technically pose as you when calling your phone company and get access to your number etc. if just not really worth unless the account is VERY valuable or someone really hate you I guess
---
He's not on a high horse
---
I didn't realise rot were dutch
---
Or maybe people are good at tanking and can actually switch between prayers based on the attacker’s gear switches and movements??? ^_^ obviously if they are running at you they are about to melee
---
Dg should have a max cap of 2147m xp
---
If you roll 2 6-sided dice, they both have a 1/6 chance to roll a 6. So the odds of 2 6's are 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36.
---
It's the same principle here just with different numbers.
---
What content do you have unlocked?  What stats do you have?  It’s hard to gauge what would suit you without knowing these variables

Cheap fury’s, blowpipes and dragon bones for everyone! /s

tell me then, you stupid cunt. this isn't dark humor so go joke about being an orphan somewhere else.
---
How do I power mine while keeping my sanity
---
It’s not bullshit. Ive suffered from it for my whole life or atleast as long as I can remember. I think it has to do with corporations/big businesses honestly, humanity went from kinda doing their own thing and helping each other out here and there to actually being forced to work for shitty companies that don’t care about your quality of life. I’m saying this is the core reason of MY depression, it’s hard to keep going when all I can do is work to just stay alive. I’m sure there are others that feel the same way
---
I’m at 800 and nothing except dragon bone necklace at 150kc
---
Now this is where you're wrong
---
The average player uses their poh every teleport.
---
Whoops! In all fairness the T-bow spawn was due to a mod creating the spawn for whatever reason, and not weird ass code that randomly created one. IIRC.
---
And what the fuck am I supposed to do with my lazy hellcat then???
---
That’s crazy
---
I didn’t know that and I’m far from a lurker
---
All 90’s, 81 slayer,everything except sote
---
Damn roasted
---
Maybe just animate it like spiderman shooting a web? Level 99 perk
---
It's a QOL to make th we shortcuts more worth using. When you consider banking time, inventory space and the animation of using the short cut itself, it's almost not a shortcut anymore. 
---
Even with this I doubt these short cuts would still be used all that much. The only one I can think of that this would be too much would be arma because it would save inventory spots and change up the meta a good bit. But like what's the harm of letting someone jump south of yannille a bit easier?
---
I am good at the game and have the elite diary done mate. Simple as that. Not reading this wall of text cbf, have a good one

Lets see your name op. I'm totally not a hacker btw

Keep me alive and i can give you guys a better bone to slob on. (;

oh it doesn’t the format of the meme is that after “broke:” comes a naïve but widely-believed statement while after the “woke:” comes either a statement with nuance or a galaxy-brained statement.

Also you get a free membership trial of 7 days for signing up with mobile, which is what bots on members worlds use

I've gotten a d spear from graador isn't that like 1/5000
---
Anyone read 'completed' in Slayermusique's voice?
---
Brine saber is slightly better than rune scimmy, if you've got a spare 200k. But honestly it would just be worth the time invested to get the dragon scimmy.
---
Ohsweet man I really appreciate it
---
Pyramid Plunder was better past 71 for me, but for mostly afk, yeah.
---
Literally the only thing you didn't do
---
I mean some people have literally never been hacked even without 2fa.
---
Damn son that's cool. What resources do you use for this sort of stuff?
---
Mum's credit card.
---
If you're indecisive I would say definitely stick with 60 for a while at least. If you get *really* bored of 60 then maybe think about levelling up, you don't want to level to 75 and then spend your time wishing you never leveled att.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but mixes only heal 2hp/sip. Each mix has two sips. Two mixes would equal 8 hp. One regular potion and a shark do more for your health since 8 hp &lt; 20 hp.

Everyone got carpal tunnel

Tell u what mate...

Yikes, that's a loooong way away. But I'm getting 83 smithing tonight and will boost for Lumby elite. Will be the first elite to be completed!

Same thing happened to me, it's the reason I no longer play.

look up an efficient melee gearing guide, absolute champ

Granite hammer and granite longsword??

Addy plate legs. Nice.

That 38 xp tho!

It even has the Fe in February. Nice.

I stopped watching shippudden for many reasons but one of the biggest ones is how it betrayed some of the values established in the original naruto run. And I agree about joseph as well, he's my favorite joestar for that specific reason. Plus he's hilarious.

Of course you only kill pvpers on a Dh account past level 3 wild is pretty much out of bounds lol

Abyssal dagger requires no quest as far as I know.
---
It's if nobody else has seen your post, not 1 minute. Lurk moar.
---
Yet I am also agruing we shouldn't consider them the byproducts of crafting/fletching anymore. More like a side dish of training said skills, as using skills is no longer the way to get those (nor was it in the past before the skills were in the game).
---
Good luck on 3k upvotes
---
What the fuck is this lol. Man I miss those times in osrs around when Ice became a bigger streamer.
---
I dislike you. But good job. Im still mad though.
---
I’m glad you like my shitposting account
---
Why is it dead content? People wouldn't be using the shortcuts more because they have the grapple there already
---
why do you think you need ice gloves to do it
---
Max damage per round is 380. Total health is 1000
---
Who uses sms 2fa, is that even an option in osrs?
---
Try an honor clan like WG then

I agree

i've never been to an enjoyable 99 party :\\

To enable it: go to developer options, scroll down to "apps" section and enable 'force split screen'. Restart phone and it works! On some phones it may be different. Mine says "force activities to be resizeable".
---
Its a meme at this point

Congratulations =)

I used platinumtokens to check prices of some items, other than that when i had enough money just insta buy/selling an item to see the margins.

Just because children have played and enjoyed the same thing, does not mean something is made for children.
---
iPhone?
---
Wow. That’s amazing.
---
You gotta stop worrying about downvotes so much
---
Ohh ok well kinda cool I guess. Thank you
---
... How about you just shoot the grapple once then the rope is always there for you to climb later? Makes the most sense imo.
---
Galvek special attacks give you like 4 seconds to respond so I was never worried while fighting him. Vorkaths acid phase will kill you in 2 ticks if you misclick
---
You mean for kids? The toxic ones with lots of "language" are mostly filled with kids.
---
Have an npc willing to swing you over with his grapple every time  if you give him 1m. 
---
The chat box would get a message when you cross “He holds you close to his chest, something  hard is sticking in your side... probably just the crossbow handle.”

OKAY FOR THAT I NOW SPENT 77 HOURS A DAY KILLING ABYSS RUNECRAFTERS FOR GLORIES THIS IS ON YOU

no but for real, im what u call an edge pker, someone who doesnt actually hit pvmers lol so title is accurate xd

And I got banned from rs3 as well
---
Pretty sure like 95% of the playerbase is adults
---
Fair point, does the game need an entire skill in order to light one fire pit? Also a fair point.
---
He asked me have I seen a road, with so much dust and sand...
---
Use one crossbow to shoot the other one + grapple to the other side
---
Lol. No one gets hacked that quickly after disabling Auth..
---
Why on earth would the alleged hacker log in on an account used for suicide botting after the ban and make an appeal *just to exhaust the original owner's chance of appeal? This doesn't make any sense.
---
Slayer- turoths, Aberrant spectre, bloodvelds, and cave horrors.  
---
My favorite is range + cannoning cave horrors off task.  The 1 mil GP black mask drops are great.
---
I think requiring 99 hunter to get an RCB is impressive enough. I'm not going to be much more impressed if 99 hunter and a year or so of hunting 1 impling was required.
---
Its not like he's cheating and leaving morytania to get an RCB. Its still an extremely time consuming unlock.
---
I said listen noob, I’ve been to every road in this here land
---
According to the wiki... "One cactus can produce a minimum of 3 spines per harvest, where the Farming level reduces the chance of using up one of the three "lives" of the cactus patch, much like harvesting herb patches. The chance is 75% at level 55, linearly decreasing to 30% at level 99.[1] On average, the player can expect around 10 spines at 99 Farming. Compost, supercompost, ultracompost, Farming cape, and magic secateurs do not affect the yield[2]"
---
Depends.
---
If your Chromebook has Crostini support, you can sideload Linux and run it. However, unless your chromebook supports GPU accel under Crostini, you'll run pretty slowly.
---
Alternatively, if your Chromebook supports the Android SDK (Google Play Store), you can load the OSRS Mobile app. The issue with that is that you're not able to resize it, and your mouse will have normal mobile controls (click &amp; hold for context menus, since right-clicking does nothing). Keyboard support on mobile is spotty at best, but chromebooks seem to do better than others due to having native support for a hardware keyboard.
---
I haven't done it myself, but I think I remember seeing people do it successfully all on a members world, without hopping. I might be wrong, but iirc, Mudkip did it the way I described on his hcim for his defense cape
---
\[D\]
---
I will be able to buy food at the Warrior's guild though...
---
It probably wouldn't be, but this is reddit, we can't have optimism for any reason whatsoever
---
Obsidian armor and weapon with berserker necklace is unlocked at level 50. It’s one of the strongest melee armor sets in the game. It is about 5m for everything you need but gives % bonuses that makes it amazing at every level. I usually afk DH in nmz and currently obsidian is better dps and exp at level 80 strength.
---
Stop getting so ahead of yourself...
---
Try to do sote, it should be doable with your money stack.
---
Combat braclet happens
---
Happy envelope day my guy
---
You should make your alt good enough to make it the other way around!
---
This is the main reason i stayed 60 until now. Il finish mm2 and do some ballista and claws pking and see what il do from there. Loads of pvm content is locked with 60 attack though. I dont pvm much though so for now it isnt bothering me much
---
And you have 192 kc
---
For real though. I go check the comments with the expectation, "oh reddit has seen this scenario hundreds of times, they must know by know that theres a 99% chance the op is the one who hacked and botted on the account." 
---
I go down to check the comments 
---
"JAMFLEX 11$ SUPPORT WHY SO BAD GIVE BOTTER ACCOUNT BACK"
---
Seriously though, most of the time the people posting on here are at fault, there are the rare cases though that they are innocent, but emphasis on rare.
---
This seems sus. Isn't it the oldest excuse in the book to say, I didn't bot it was a hacker or someone else that they know"?
---
Not without a d baxe.
---
But it’s 1:2, No?
---
I mean I hate to say I don’t believe this, but why would they bot a hacked account? Like it’s obviously going to get banned. Like with a fresh bot acc there’s at least a good chance it won’t get banned since we see bots with like well over 99 in skilling levels
---
They could have tried to get any chance at appeal to keep botting but this whole thing doesn't seem that credible.
---
Get to 100kc first lol
---
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
---
Maybe? The magic set doesn't give a damage bonus and your magic accuracy against the barrows brothers will already be incredibly high even without magic gear.
---
RoT are a clan that basically guard rev caves in 2200 worlds. They charge 25mil for a day of protected rev farming as it’s a good money maker. They have like 30-40 people patrolling the worlds as some sort of OSRS mafia. They have also been involved in the Mod Jed incident in which they supposedly DDoS final players in DMM to win. This is further heightened as they haven’t fought in a DMM or won since Jed got fired. They are in a nutshell some 20-30 year olds that group PK (30+ vs 1) players and make next to no money patrolling worlds for gp bribes
---
Make a room for your servant to sleep in. He's homeless right now.

What are you talking about, my dude.  I always have a bit down the road loosely planned. I have had this and a few smaller goals loosely planned for a long time and now I am ready to loosely plan the next stage.  Help me loosely plan.

Like many I mostly play the game without sound on since it can get repetitive, but whenever I’m doing quests or exploring new areas I make sure to have the game sound on, it really adds to the atmosphere and the nostalgia in the older areas. Ian Taylor and the rest of the music team definitely deserve more praise for what they’ve accomplished.
---
The fairy ring works just as well. Much easier since you don’t have to worry about omg getting PKed.
---
its actually around 1/9770, factoring in the fact you killed the boss 195 times, therefore had 195 tries at the 1/1,905,124 drop.
---
It's one weapon dude 
---
It's obviously not realistic without the RCB. There is a cap on skill in this game unless you're Woox and even then 
---
What you're version would entail is that he'd use full Karils and his teammates would have to use RCBs which defeats the restrictions cause like then he's just getting carried
---
Yes, your energy lasts longer and scales with your agility level.
---
Stamina potions are helpful. Ultimately, the graceful set will be one of the most useful sets in the long run. I'd grind for it early on, you'll use it throughout the entire game.
---
he...he...head...? Head what? Is it a message coming together?
---
We are here for you jamflex, head WHAT?
---
As long as it's not on DMM, muling/multiple accounts are perfectly fine. Feel free to do that (just beware of pkers at the lower brackers can oneshot you and still isn't all that safe).
---
I quit my range tank and osrs in 2014 cause I lost bank staking. I was at work one night when my friend asked me if I was playing rs again cause my account logged in and he wasnt responding to my friends priv messages.
---
Turns out my acc was hacked. I didnt give a shit so I let the hacker play on it but then like a month or so after that i decided to recover the account.
---
I did manage to recover the account after a while but the account was banned for botting. It took me 10 months of sending emails to jagex every other month to try to get my account back.
---
 I finally got my acc back this july and it had about 40m bank and the guy was obviously a zulrah bot
---
Yeah I did this once and it was so slow it wouldn't run. Not worth
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Restoration_pool
---
You can't get to 65 construction?
---
If Jagex does their research in the appeal process and deems that you have broken the rules, you deserve to stay banned, plain and simple.
---
 Dont you think its likely for someone thats banned by Jagex for botting to go to the jagex support Twitter to try and lie their way into getting unbanned? The appeal process is the best way for jagex to answer the pile of similar requests they get. The answer they gave seemed fine to me. Head btw.
---
At one point on rs3 a hacker bought a bunch of wheel of squeal spins. Jagex then told the original owner that the hacker now had more financial ownership of the account.
---
for clarification about your second question: drop untrim and get 99, pick cape back up and it's still untrimmed. when you buy the next 99 cape, that cape will be trimmed. only 1 untrimmed skill possible
---
Crazy that a TV guy has even fell back to content creation on the internet. The adaptability of people like that to try to stay relevant is honestly cool to see
---
There’s been a YouTube video done on this. Needs to be dropped on f2p but doesn’t have to be telegrabbed
---
Also can kill boss and I think demibosses on bounty hunter world for chances at them.
---
it's much faster to kill the brothers with magic. Any guide will say so. I'm just tellin people how to make it easier w/o spending too much time and resources
---
How about an appeal being denied when you are the original owner on the account? I don't know how they did it but man, they stole my account big time
---
A lot of very small details exist in Rs that make a lot of sense, and mostly goes unnoticed
---
The reason he’s saying it’s a good addition is
---
Because it’s a free 10k that most people use to start out their accounts, and you have to have 2fa set up to get all the way through it. Not because of the silly questions you answer for the doors.
---
I know exactly what you mean, unfortunately the sounds of your axe chopping, etc. are tied to the environment just like everyone else's and therefore all come through on the same audio channel.
---
There is nothing you can do about this.  You could maybe run to one of the other corners that has less people, but that would be your only option.
---
Obviously not a problem.....
---
Friends 3 year old iron acc was  banned yesterday. Ban says he cant appeal it, as well as any social media posts made asking for help will be ignored. Jagex just doesnt give a fuck anymore. 
---
I think theres about the same amount of bots as actual players so when jagex is banning people, sometimes it's a blind guess whether or not they actually committed an offence.
---
yea and bootman exists, luck is fickle.
---
No they will crash to 0 gp
---
Haha that's some shit I would do. I had the mining pet but I lost it and I don't even remember how. But yeah ornate pool is for sure the best thing I've invested in
---
I remember nothing but trolls putting ketchup on steak, ramen recipes and general normal person discussion about food. 
---
Granted I haven’t been on 4chan in maybe 5 years.
---
to be fair blizzard support is the cream of the crop in terms of mmo support. ive played lots of runescape, ff14, gw2, and wow and any of my issues with wow gets resolved with support, and then some! When i recovered my old account not only was the support kind and helpful, but they gave me 2 days free playtime on my recovered account, which is incredibly kind. anyone who plays ff14 support knows there support and site is just as bad as jagex.
---
why you gotta put down others to feel better about yourself? the potions has feelings too you know.. imagine being this potion and checking reddit
---
They've updated a few of the options to more relevant scam information. I think mostly what he means though is you are required to set up the authenticator in order to receive the 10k reward. Many players (ironman, etc) do this right away.
---
Have you looked in a mirror?
---
Can't and will not defend the N word but saying faxxot nowadays is literally like saying cunt or asshole. It's used so often that its negative homophobic connotation has been more or less erased if you're not calling an actual homosexual a faxxot.
---
Yeah why the fuck would you
---
No they will not go up so stop posting
---
It doesn't combo making it worse than a regular 4 dose and a shark
---
You're right lol I'm just ignorant tbh :/
---
Can't be homophobic if it's not targeted at a homosexual ... smh
---
Copied and pasted from Genius, and it was fucking 12 am. Thanks tho

I'm not sure why everyone is surprised. Jagex Support is not account support. It's emotional support. They will "try" to comfort you not actually help the situation. /s

Seems less useful than the Ely in most situations since maintaining prayer is usually more valuable than maintaining hitpoints

Nope

For real though, it seems like every other person is depressed, more so in this community.

It's one weapon that he didn't get solely by himself, defeating the purpose of locking himself in a region as a uim. It only showcases that he doesn't give a fuck about what he's doing and only what's to get shit out to keep his audience baited.
---
He literally did an episode where he did the math of his next best option - full Karil's w/ amulet of the damned - and it wasn't going to be enough. With rcb and enchanted bolts its going to be very difficult but mathmatically possible.
---
No not DMM, thanks for the answer!
---
with all the wow memes and community backlash that community has had in the past you dont think there support lines get tied up with trolls too? were talking about the game that originated 'kek' im sure they get fucked with all the time.

Yeah that is absolutely a macro. His mouse is still moving back and forth while it's typed. So we're supposed to believe he typed that fast with 1 hand? Yikes.

I don’t think McDonald’s has grills I think they just stick the patties up their butthole until their body heat fully cooks them.

Master Clues are trolls, first 3 steps I complete no problem, then I get the Anglerfish Sherlock step (cue grinding 10 levels in fishing and 5 hours of Fishing Trawler), next step is the Pyramid Plunder room 7 emote step (cue grinding 6 thieving levels), next step is the Sherlock Sacred Eel step (cue ANOTHER 5 level fishing grind).

I believe I've seen people do brutal blacks as well

Seems that mixing in farming/birdhouse runs with some of these is recommended as well

Big brain time

There's already been way too many Ironman focused updates.

This when I am tanking and not fighting back. If you are brid fighting this is totally different.

He doesn't care about the community lol

Your mouse is moving back and forth while it's being typed. There's no way.

No. Just sell what you have and save yourself some some heartache when they get dumped this next holiday season.

Damn kid... this song is fire.

No wonder you get hacked you're literally a brainlet.

Yes, but you must pay for the bond to be tradable, which is 10% of the GE price at the time. Then you just right click —&gt; use on your IM

Jagex is ~~socialist~~ Capitalist confirmed.

No problem, co-hosting meme history was a pleasure and a welcome distraction from agility. 39 more laps till 82
---
Lol no one is forcing you to watch and no one cares less if you don't watch 
---
People watch bc of the content and the content is very good. Not some XXL-virgin rules you've come up with. If you care so much then do it yourself but as I said I would rather not have 2 years of him standing in one place force spawning imps

You'll be fine. Do a bit every day and it won't be too bad.

Also sorry to destroy your dreams but if you want the highest level of portal nexus you need 84 to boost for that
---
They're spite voting no since it ruined pking back when it was released in RS2, but without pak yaks or the six dose jars it's nowhere near as effective as everyone thinks it would be.
---
Not to mention that no one would use it in pking today, just as no one would use an Ely

I don't need the nexus imo
---
sorry to hear about your account mate but I'm pretty sure that Twitter account is being run by "Jagex Helper" team. Basically you can expect them to be useless.

I mean you can make anything look more difficult than anything else when you intentionally draw out the steps for one thing and simplify the steps for the other thing.

---
Ironmen can't trade or use GE. HE'S NOT.
---
There are several ironman CCs which help one another with imps and other shit. Almost every iron has a main they use to fund bonds or for protection etc etc
---
Thanks, I'll give that a try. I was wondering about using diamond bolts at lower hp since rubies work off of vorks remaining hp. Should I stick with the rune cross bow? Or get a dragon one? D crossbow only has +4 over rune and a special attack option.
---
Except dinhs is useless in pvm and was only useful to tank salad robes in wildy
---
not even the best in de division zeke all the way

Re: house building. Surg1n has made a video about the most efficient house setup, and it was the first time I had considered that more furniture/rooms= longer load times. Does anyone have a rough estimate as to what kind of a difference you'd be looking at between a fully furnished home with max rooms vs a home built for speed and efficiency?  
---
Reason I ask is that I wouldn't mind waiting a few extra ticks for my house to load if it's totally baller and feels like something I'm proud of but if it's like...10 seconds then I'll just save my money and live in a crack den.
---
What're u beaning aboot
---
Ironman . Btw
---
theres been a lot of those posts and this is the first time ive seen it tho
---
Stash box that can be opened from both sides, with shared contents. Put in a rope and cross bow. Whenever you need to get across just pull them out, equip and use grapple like normal, and then place back in on the other side.
---
Some of these people never had their mom tell them "no you didn't actually win an iPad, that's a scam" and it shows

I never saw the other post, the opportunity was just there in how you responded.
---
Literally have a bachelor's in mathematics.
---
Yet it is the PvMers who were the most vocal about the nerf... Hmm. Though i guess that highlights the other age old problem, PvMers hating PvPers.
---
How is this useless
---
Where is his huge cock
---
I agree with that one. I believe the only reason runelite added it, was because OSB (pro?) already had it.
---
Before these swappers, it took a lot of precision (or AHK - while that method was allowed) to gain those same xp rates.
---
I think there are certain things that shouldn't be swappable. Any blackjack-able NPC shouldn't be able to be left-click pickpocketed. Bones shouldn't be left-click use.
---
Thats what makes them so bad, they count as food
---
Maybe if they changed them to act as pots or gave them a (4) dose upgrade they might be relevant

Train via a spot then?

You did mess up your build if you wanted to remain a 1 attack obby mauler.  You can either get a few attack levels to balance it out, or go for a tribrid pure/ gmauler.  I would recommend going g mauler, being an obby mauler w/ extra attack levels isn't horrible but you are going to be facing higher combat level opponents and you'll be at a disadvantage. I would recommend you go 50 attack and play with that for a bit, if you don't like it you can always go 60 attack.  This way you can practice a lot w/ minimal loss.
---
He flamed you hard then reported
---
Blizzard with its stupid high revenue can afford the AAA quality support they have, Jagex upgrade theirs for sure but it'll never amount to that. 
---
With that being said Blizzard is a complete garbage company, constantly censoring their games to cater to the chinese market, while simultaneously spreading their ass-cheeks for Activi$$$ion's monetization schemes and business models.
---
They also like to wave their small dicks around with their "we know better than you" attitude that we get to see a glimpse of every once in a while. "you think you want it but you don't" "don't you all have phones?"
---
Sure Jagex is far from perfect, but i'll take Jagex over Activi$$$ion-Blizzard any day.
---
I got in trouble for buying something (let’s say gmaul) for 85k then said “ha noob it’s worth 100k” basically bragging about how I’m gunna merch it, but he fucking reported me. I might go find it if I have the time to check all my tween-aged account violations.
---
My 42 alts\*.
---
I will keep this in mind (not doing it lol)
---
I have a bulwark on my ironman that I use. I would rather have an extra brew than the crossbow switch as you also lose the bulwark defense.
---
My dude, download something to record your screen. I recommend OBS or Streamlabs OBS. They're for streaming but also recording.
---
What?
---
They need to make a crawling hand boss. Legitimately drops barrows gloves at 1 in 1m. Drops ferocious gloves 1 in 2m. Brimstone ring 1 in 2m. Etc. A fun stupid boss with great rewards at stupid drop rates. The boss would be made entirely so you can post your 50/50 drop on reddit.
---
Seriously. If I can get Saquon 3rd id be so happy
---
Yep.
---
Do you think it's better to pk in the smaller window?
---
What do you mean all trades at the buy limit?
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Dragon full helm is purely cosmetic and costs 40m, instead of that he could have bought full barrows set, or wear bandos tassets. And hes using a rune kit shield instead of anything else, dragon defender, dragonfire shield, Etc.
---
So there was no meaning behind your comment?
---
Runescape was always aimed at teenagers and young adults, we were just all kids.
---
What's the method to doing the intricate follow trains? This one looks like it might just be 4 follows, but some of the dances I've seen are really crazy.
---
I do Vorkath every day for a few kills on mobile (at 500kc atm) I got DHCB and DFW and I would really recommend Ornate Pool and a portal to Lunar Isle. Depending on luck I do 2 minutes kills consistently and only die if not paying attention
---
Bad bot
---
A Grand Exchange NPC to buy a grapple on the way over, and then to sell it after you finish the shortcut.
---
Yea bro im not bossing tired anymore lmao it was depressing
---
Inb4 Runelite Mobile fixes it before Jagex does...
---
i killed thousands of green dragons after talking to oziach cus i wanted that visage...
---
Ive killed 40k+ gargs on the main + 70m xp between fishing/wc/cook/Firemaking on my lvl 3 skiller. Sitting on top of a bond mountain now and it all started as a dream
---
The only issue is that crates don't stack in bank. I'd. Recommend soloing if possible to reduce number of banked crates and maximizing rewards.
---
Thats what she said
---
Using houses that people make publically available for free of their own will is not the same as asking your rich friends if you can use their shit. In the first case, people offer their stuff freely, and it costs them nothing but their time to do so. In the second case, they haven’t offered anything, you’re asking, and you’re also depriving them of access to their items for the duration of your use. The house owner is not deprived of his house by sharing it with others. Lending me a, idk, a whip, let’s say, deprives you of your whip.
---
Complaining at that Kc.. try being 2k plus without one

Should I just ditch the clue? I've been working on it for month but only have 4 steps completed

If it still has the proper def reqs for those gloves, support

Yeah gonna do that but it's still gonna take a lot, need 85 WC now
---
This the kinda guy that will get the 40-40 dds rng at LMS that one pray flick you miss the entire fight
---
It’s called watch a YouTube video
---
There are vorkath bots, I've seen them being sold/offered. Obviously due to the insane requirements they're not nearly as common and a ban there stings a lot more.
---
that was fun

14 years on this game and not once have any of my accounts ever even been *logged in to*, much less actually stealing shit/the account.

I agree. They really have no one to blame but themselves.
---
Ya but once you get 99 magic there’s no point.. cape does it for you
---
Yes, petition to end telegrabscape
---
Thanks you for this. Can u get some ways how effectiveness would play out if im fighting a boss or monster im general
---
Where the fuck is the search option for this bank
---
How are you gonna have 99 in any skill yet not have the patience to read 7 lines of text lmaooooooooo
---
It's not disingenuous. There is literally never a reason to use a crystal bow over a blowpipe. This is like saying it's disingenuous to call a rune mace dead content because you technically can train with it over a rune scimitar.
---
Even for Ironmen, you would almost certainly have a blowpipe before completing Song of the Elves.
---
Is Torag's meta for anything? All the other barrows stuff atleast has some use or niche that I've heard of but haven't heard of torags being used anywhere.
---
"delet this"
---
If you need to, sell BCP and use torso and get torture first, followed by prims. Overlooked is ferocious gloves which are true BIS for melee which imo is best bis upgrade for price. Then BCP and tassets last.
---
Bludgeon is great and would recommend but if you don't have the cash Abby dagger and d Def or d scim isn't bad too use
---
I think that is me and if so then yes he escaped. I only had barrage and no TB.
---
They are instanced and require slayer level requirements or being on task
---
 you’re on ancients so you’d need to have done lumby elite and use one of ur 30 or so alchs for the day on it or it means a shorter trip if u wanna bank for it, I don’t see most people pick them up
---
Gratz!!

WHY READ LMAOOOOOOOOO
---
The shop in the Rogue's Den and the general store in West Ardy
---
Hadn't considered ferocious gloves, I'll add them to the list! 
---
Tassets last seems to be the general consensus
---
My guy, you're missing my point. I never said it wasn't "dead content" or that it wasn't bad. My point is that you cant talk about crystal armour WITHOUT talking about its damage and accuracy bonus to the crystal bow. If you say that isnt relevant than you're also saying the crystal bow is dead content and that's pretty debatable
---
Torags leg and helm are good for tanking, especially on alts if you can't afford Justiciar.
---
Awh, lil cutie — that's just how probability works. Take up your complain with the extra-dimensional aliens who programmed our universe, not with Jagex.
---
Or just fix the game?
---
This skeleton could be the new "Alright Imma head out now" meme...
---
LOL I know i was so confused my IGN is ZO US
---
If you checked your absorbs every minute instead you'd stay for 6 hrs. But usually people just do NMZ normals for AFK and don't bother with rock cake because the monsters do so little damage that you can just absorb up then check back in like 20 mins.
---
Yeah, the title is slightly misleading. The rooftop agility portion covers the bit that has been in OSRS for so long it fits in - mentioned in the first clip. There are still 5 features mentioned. I had two clips for Corp and GWDs since my GWDs clip was so short.
---
EG Infernal Cape
---
Nope, Jagex didn’t program their game right i’m 100% sure
---
Yeah try it, you will like it. It's way more engaged but in a good way.
---
Someone hurry up and post a fake picture where the circles are Crabs.
---
I had skipped to the end in order to save some time, big mistake lmao

We need more stuff like mutagens. To recolour equipment like Bandos and such.
---
Gunschili's editing is absolutely god tier
---
Also the “...I’m 160 dry”
---
....my sweet summer child.
---
Your best in slot weapon for melee and range, and then I use slayer dart because the rune rewards always give me enough runes to cast it without running out. Then just bring like a glory or fury, and a ring of dueling. Bring whatever boots you like. I think I use dragon boots. However above all, I would recommend at least 60 magic. Haven’t done barrows in a while, but that’s my budget set up
---
That's generally because PKers these days want easy $. Given the choice, they almost always attack PvMers instead of other PKers because most of them risk absolute garbage.
---
The better question is, how is the Account Sharing? Because that's what the offence is for.
---
hahahahahahahaha yes thats just what i meant 😂😂🔥🔥💯💯
---
this lmfao even free to play games like clash of clans fixes all of their bugs and issues like the op. runescape is only surviving because its fun to play
---
I wish someone looked at me the way your main looks at your alt :(
---
yeah 100% because the inventory is closer to the action; easier eats and switches
---
Party hats are irrelevant.
---
Wait, the stuffed hand is still a pet in osrs? I thought that just carried over to rs3
---
The Dragon Scimitar. The OG token of respect. Feels good to be able to wield it man!
---
Thats like 6 ppots man. No shame.
---
?????????????????!??? You’re saying the pet wasn’t from that boss and I’m saying drops (which a pet is a drop) will show up for anything on the collection log that drops that... seems relevant
---
That’s a really solid point. My point has nothing to do with the efficiency of it though, it’s just that people get so mad at the quality of the pic lol when it’s really not that big of a deal. It’s not like you can’t see the names in this picture. People just want to get mad just because it’s the thing to do here it seems
---
Maybe they just need a charge
---
I’m just going to go ahead and let you know that this subreddit is going to roast this video.

This comment is irrelevant to the post.

It will probably be becoming public soon in the source for my discord bot(old school bot), as it's being used for a new feature

Is it allowed to be unexpected if "Treat yo self" is the title of the post?
---
Well its fucking shit
---
Saying "get lost" is the equivalent of saying "hey what's the big idea" who tf actually says that lol
---
Pre trident meta for ironmen killing zulrah is to not kill zulrah, lol.
---
But yea, if you wanted to, it would be ibans and msb(I). That method is a bit better these days since ibans blast stays selected when you swap now. I personally wouldn't do more than a couple like that though. Trident makes such a difference.
---
No I didn't? I have no idea what passwords or security he had. 
---
Read again. "MUST HAVE" as in I am SPECULATING.
---
God damn this gave me a great laugh. Thankyou for that man
---
It's a shame honestly, i made my rs3 iron account a regular osrs account to trade a bond over and forgot about it. Went to start an osrs iron and realized my account had already been created, after reaching out to support/every mod on the mod team all of them said it wouldn't be possible and id need a new account.
---
Then here comes mod Ash. Tps me right back to tutorial island like it was nothing. Small stupid thing but fuck it made me so happy.
---
I know right like who just leaves that laying there
---
If high as fuck and this sent me further west than castle wars

That “ur password has been changed” email might been a phishing email if u clicked on the link it has.

TO THE MOON

Shit i look almost like this
---
What am i doing wrong?
---
Lol noob
---
Get a max cape , after that come talk to me
---
*30 seconds of panicked clicking on armor, weapons, potions, food, and prayer*
---
*Looks at character dead and sees "gf"*
---
"Damn it."
---
Your boss thinks you're smoking crystal meth while at work?
---
Agility will help in the long run doing bloods, if you’re planning to max, you want to tie things together like doing fishing before agility if you’re doing barb fishing as you get a lot of passive exp.
---
In my experience, a combination of both. A lot of the time jagex unbans em several times too
---
Because most people dont know this has historically been a troll account on twitter and Jagex has repeated dismissed it's comments.
---
Funny as fuck tho
---
Realistically? nothing wrong lol. For higher efficiency though you'd want a nezzy helm, f torso preferably, maybe obby legs and a fire cape
---
None really. There isn't a need for them. What I'm trying to say is that you don't need more shields but rather more situations to use them in.
---
Everything you pointed out makes sense and is valid but it again points out the prevalence of DPS&gt;tankiness encounters.
---
I've got an idea in mind for this, I'll post it sometime this evening.

Theres a dude sweeping every tile in rs3 as we speak - i hear he has plans to dig every OSRS tile too

Stop being a fucking loser. Then come talk to us

Maybe if u didnt put the helm i would have came. Not willingly tho.

They can't give out their battletags or in game names, I've tried many times before. Doubt a dude would risk his job to add some kid to raid with

This one was by far the best.

It’s possible not many people knew about these prior to his video. That could explain the popularity jump.

I definitely didnt know about them!

Did you talk to Oziach first?
---
Hey guys. Just went members, was members probably 8 years ago or so. So very rusty. 
---
Grinded out full void, I’m currently 54atk/50str/42def/42range/52mage. 
---
Bought a granite maul, but it’s only fun for specs. 
---
Question is. Am I doing this right? I feel like I’ve got a armor set that will last until I decide to train def, which won’t be for quite a while. What should I consider as alternatives?
---
What’s the best weapon route post 50, cheap or expensive. 
---
Are there good armor alternatives between 42 and 60?
---
What’s my best in slot for cape, boots, and ring?
---
Thanks for your time guys.
---
For stuff like that it's best to schedule a consultation with a tattoo artist, they can look at the area you want to get tattooed and the pieces you want to incorporate, have some extra ideas they can use as fillers as those things you have wouldn't fill a full sleeve unless they are huge, and I doubt you'd want a 6 inch HCIM helm on your arm. I pretty much go to my artist with a basic idea and let them do the rest, always a good idea to trust the professional.
---
That was not him btw that was just the tber for that team.
---
how long did this take
---
also did you not close runelite at all?
---
F-f-fighting b-boots?.. don’t hand this man any wrong advice!

can't get banned if you don't do shady shit that they catch you doing, don't pay people to do shit for you either.

"it should" but Rapier + drag def is so accurate that it OutRanks the Bludgeon for sure. Add avernic def. and a treacherous ring? IDK what it's called but heard of a +8 att ring
---
RS3 BAD
---
excuse me, but for this reason i posting this.. I  dont done this, I just skilling to get high stats and questing to gain access to spells/areas, not was easy for me gaher coin per coin killing green, blue dragons, revenant and other mobs to get dragon hunter crossbow for brutal black dragons killing, and gather more gold to buy a best gear to questing and kill vorkath
---
Of course! All are welcome!
---
^(The epitome of notice me)
---
Can't lose your progress if you're not overtly trash at online security. Your hand is held by Jagex as it is. They can't stop you from putting your password in everywhere because people can't be bothered to look at what they're doing.
---
Yeah well I pk in 100m risk lmao. You’re probably depressed irl because I spanked you in deep wildy and took your rune c bow and g maul hahaha
---
If you read the edit to that post there is a link to an update post stating that he got the account back. The premise that the owner of the account is based on who pays more is false and defamatory towards Jagex. I realize that Jagex support is pretty bad overall, but there was no way that was a legit policy as it is just ridiculous.
---
Did you know most toasters are waterproof? Try it the next time you're in the tub!

could you elaborate on that?

120 and no barrows gloves?
---
I've avoided almost every single phish or scam in my life, but the one time it caught me with my guard down was when I was bored browsing facebook before falling asleep one night. Saw an ad for a pre-registration for runescape mobile. It seemed official, and was harmless enough that I didn't think it would have been a phish. If it said 2x exp, free membership, anything else there's no way in hell I would have clicked it. But pre registering for the mobile beta? That seemed totally realistic. Won't make that mistake again

Turn on your private settings for a second so I can PM you something in game
---
Looks like he sold his account and tried to get it back. 
---
What kind of retarded hacker would hack an account, and then invest time and money into it When they could be hacking other accounts and accumulate wealth, bot their own account, etc.
---
how do i do that?
---
No, I get that Jagex is really a company that is making profits under the capitalist model, but I’m saying that this decision to basically give away an account to a hacker because he put money into it, is authoritarian and socialist by nature. The ruler (Jagex) redistributed the workers (players) account because they deemed it appropriate, effectively stepping on they players right to ownership of his account.
---
You can turn your npc attack options off temporarily to spam click the pile. Its annoying but it's at least a solution.

🦀🦀🦀🦀we are powerless against Jagex 🦀🦀🦀🦀

Full story: Rushed a dude with claws + ballista at revs, saw a tber to teleported out without looting. Banked some stuff teled back up (so did the one I killed), looted it and took a run for it while the one I killed followed me with this.

Awesome. You’ll want to do the same thing for galvek. He will be very proc dependent so I would keep it on rapid until maybe the last phase.

ge tracker has never been accurate.

Probably someone that doesnt play or maybe a bot with keyword triggered replies idk lmao im clueless too

Judging by OP’s reddit name, he’s not being the little bitch in chat, but rather the pmod.

Good one

Keep trying and you'll get better

I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that...

Sure but with the barb potions you always have to heal when you drink the potion. Like you can't save the healing until you need it, but instead you have to use it every time you refresh the potion and also every time you need healing you also need to refresh the potion. In the other scenario you can eat when you want and use potion when you want. It's only better in a niche situation where you take low dmg over a long period where you also wanted to refresh the potion anyway. Otherwise you just waste a lot of either your food or your potion. That just makes for a lot more inefficient trips overall.

Great content so far man I binged watch all 19 episodes today haha.

Just a heads up you could get your deliveroo account suspended if someone reports this to them

😂😂😂

What you mean? He used alts

So the legends are true...

First off you need to decide if it's Astronomy or Astrology as others pointed out, and also if it's charting or chanting. Just nitpicking though, overall it seems to fit in old school very well, but that's kind of it.
---
Maybe I just understood it wrong, but it looks like it's mostly a runner skill much like Runecrafting or Agility, although not same laps over and over but still close and we kind of do have enough of that already. Still a very interesting idea. If only the sky and horizon weren't pitch black void lol.

i appreciate the solid argument haha. I understand the nmz -&gt; boss grind for GP bricks angle, but like you said efficiency is relative and for me, and assumed many other plebs like myself, the labor intensive, high risk work that is bossing; without wanting to truly learn boss mechanics is too much for me to want to dive in. I also figure I might as well gain lvls + the GP necessary to have most gear acceptable to do high lvl bossing. Prior to the garg grind, my main was a low lvl maxed range tank and I had 35m pts in the NMZ bank but No gp to show for the time spent. Arma was fun and I got ~60m but the Burnout Factor with bossing is high + the risk of lagging out and dying and going thru that. But different method strokes for different folks it seems we can agree on lol
---
What'd they order lol
---
Your run energy regen rate only goes up every 6 levels, so 96 is the last breakpoint. 97-99 don't do anything.
---
Higher mining makes the dense essence block less likely to deplete (slightly). You get about 1.2m mining xp along the way though, so don't do 99 mining before 99 rc.

The most unbelievable thing is him thinking he can email Jagex about non billing related issues

Imagine working as a support on a dying, and I mean *DYING* game (MapleStory rip), being paid little to nothing, trying to help an endless horde of leftover players with questions they can't answer. FYI multiple NX mods have quit. 
---
To give a better perspective of how dead the game is, it's basically a chat room for incels, Brazilian bots and weebs, and the lack of players forced Nexon to merge EU with NA. 
---
Fuck I miss MapleStory 2006-2011.
---
What? Its been gradually raising for a month. The video came out a few days ago. There's no correlation.

I think it's actually faster to just teleport back to falador square lol

Awesome thanks for the informed response bro

I’m almost positive that hard coding things like this is necessary.
---
Absolutely man, we all started somewhere and that's the reality of it. Truly efficient raidrunners, bossers, 3-tickers, etc. have all been a noob at some point and they're reaping the rewards of the mistakes they've made along the way now.
---
I have friends that strive to be the most efficient they can and the earliest they can (eg. quest and minigame hard to get all untradeables) then only do super high intensity, "efficient" methods to make money. Man, if it floats their boat then sure but at some point, people have to realize it is still a GAME. You should at least try to have FUN when you're playing a game imo haha
---
Would you like to see a buff to the stats or a way to remove the need to charge it?
---
Id personally be cool with them introducing a hefty payment or a lengthy miniquest where you do tasks for the Elven lords to gain their favor to "bless" your armor and weapons (probably not the dragon skilling equipment though?) so they didn't degrade.  
---
Maybe it would fill a small niche for people who don't like to fletch all their bolts or arrows? Or for someone who reallllllly wants to range and equip a god blessing in GWD? It wouldn't be BIS by a long shot but maybe it would better than having to recharge every few hours.

Essential information.

That Twitter account is a bot with automated responses. You need to tweet an actual Jmod to get a legit response lol
---
I highly suggest reading up on Bob's wisdom at least
---
It's a public and well known address
---
Okay what do some of you expect? The response is blunt but accurate. You get the one appeal and that's it. There's not a good way to prove a hacker *really* used his appeal. How do you know it's not a ruse to get a second attempt appeal after losing the first one claiming you got hacked?

Not bad

I got banned for cross posting it to osrs, it’s pretty common knowledge that the rs3 community are very sensitive so I’m not really surprised as there would be no other reason for a ban
---
All he does is train to get his revenge
---
My PSN account was as stolen last week, the hacker made $300 worth of charges. Had my account back and full refund within 5 buisness days, in my opinion sony are easy to deal with
---
Focus on one aspect at a time. Like your prayer switching for example. When you feel comfortable with that, try to focus on gear/style switching more. Then focus on incorporating more advanced things like speccing at a good time when they have robes on,, stepping under them, doing fake switches  etc. You'll see a massive improvement in days.
---
This was 2007, people talked differently back then. You damn whippersnapper.
---
I still dont understand how ppl get hacked...
---
I mean i got hacked plenty of times back in the day, but i was retarded and this was one of my first games, i am sure ppl are much less stupid nowadays and still.. this..
---
I exhaled slightly stronger than usual through my nostrils.

Still breaches their guidelines, still a customer address, I dont really care just letting you know

I want to see the calculation of all these items to gp,  1 x 10^13 would be my guess.

Yeah plus we were all 10
