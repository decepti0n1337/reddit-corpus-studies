Stop trying to buff skillcapes.

All I want for Christmas is for changes to make it into the patch notes.

---
None of this "yes things were changed in underground pass in the expectation that the poll would pass, and then weren't reverted or documented when the poll failed"
---
Splashing was great back in RS3 when you could stay logged in until the next update, but now it sucks. You‚Äôre way better off xp and gp-wise to just auto-alch.
---
Seriously. And if you can't afford $11 a month, you definitely have enough time to earn 4m every 2 weeks.
---
was it yours?
---
You can buy a tinderbox in one of the stores kver there in regicide.
---
Noticed it while browsing when my uim did it
---
Lmfao that‚Äôs actually hilarious dude
---
Why would you ever enter your user/pw AND bank pin on one of those links? Like i dont understand. Its so obvious and if you've been around the internet for longer than a day you'd realize its an obvious phish attempt. 
---
Not being rude my guy, but its honestly just super obvious shit. The amount of scammers in game is annoying also, especially the duel arena ones because they're so fucking obvious and literally impossible to make work unless you are TRULY Not paying attention whatsoever since the game wont let you accept if rules change and also tells you if your preset isn't loaded..but alas people do it because obv ppl are falling for it.
---
nylos don't have a whole lot of health tho so they could still be an option
---
Gotcha. Someone else in this thread mentioned putting dust runes in the rune pouch instead of air and earth runes so you can fit law runes for a home tele. Somehow that thought never even crossed my mind.
---
I‚Äôm not a bot :(
---
It's really random. I definitely had my fair share of DC's. Multiple at Hydra/Sire/Cerb/Kraken.
---
But I feel like I see it more often on streamers rather than myself, I'd even see a streamer DC while I'm still able to play or vice versa.
---
Honestly, there just needs to be a constant connection or a connection buffer of some sorts to multiple servers. Because even if you did DC it would probably be a max of a couple of seconds(sure that's still a lot, but as long as you're spam clicking a teleport the buffer will register those actions[kind of the same way sicknerd is suddenly out of ToB after having a small DC])
---
Literally no reason to play HCIM especially if you're a streamer. People deserve to die if they're doing a boss and they aren't paying attention or they do dumb shit like afk run and get killed by a bear. 
---
However if you die to a SYSTEM FAILURE(aka something that is beyond your control) is fucking stupid. And for those people who say "OH BUT IT'S PART OF THE GAME!" Yea, ok and in CS:GO there are literally GAME BREAKING BUGS that majorly impact your chance of winning(bomb glitching through the map). Pretty dumb.

Don't think that's exactly accurate, since flinching *only* works if you attack the NPC. Other red clicks won't stop it from attacking you.

I did the same but forgot an axe I think üòì

Nice! I completed it on my iron in 126 but no axe or pet so I guess I didn‚Äôt quite finish! When did you get ax and pet?
---
Arks the same way, minus the love.
---
Axe 55 KC and Pet 227 KC
---
Pretty much exactly that. NPCs that get hit "flinch" for a tick when hit and then one tick after, and take 8 or 9 (iirc) ticks to 'reset' from their high-alert state. If you try to attack them again within this time they will retaliate instantly and not recoil.
---
Like I stated in a reply earlier I had my attention elsewhere, saw "b0aty" was "quitting" and had a link to why, which led to a fake runescape site which I just assumed were the forums for me to log into. I am no newbie to fake links and scams, like I said my attention was elsewhere, I mostly posted this to be informative. It's been up for more than an hour which is pretty ridiculous on Twitch's part.

Yep like the others said I just use chrome Remote Desktop.
---
Lots of network hops between us and the Jagex servers, even in the US. They don't have servers sitting at or close of your ISP's backbone like companies like Netflix do. It only takes one hiccup in one to cause that kind of lag spike.
---
Didn't realise piper perri had an osrs account.
---
There is a new quest being proposed Tuesday. I have a suspicion that there will be something proposed to buff the neitiznot helm - keep an eye out.
---
I was doing NMZ earlier today at my job lol.
---
Its plenty relevant, I still use it frequently on main
---
Compensation for deaths outside of your control would be nice. That's not really that unreasonable if Jagex are the ones that want to host a competitive, one life only game mode like this. Something like you get put into purgatory when you die, and then the game decides whether you died due to a mistake or a dc. 
---
It's not really even an issue of it being abused. If you're quick enough to unplug your ethernet cable, you're more than quick enough to hit a tele tab. Its mostly just Jagex not putting priority on improving our game experience, because they know they don't need to fix glaring issues if people keep paying for those services. More slayer content instead to bring in new customers instead of rebalancing and fixing existing content.
---
What did the patch do
---
Dont all HCIMs have teleports in dangerous situations anyways? Id imagine its much easier to just use ur tele then to yank your ethernet cable no?
---
Truth, I'm lucky if I even get my lunch break out of a 10 hour day at minimum wage... This kind of stuff really gets my blood boiling
---
Actually devastating. He had such a good account too.
---
I updated it accordingly.
---
Of cours. I heard there's clients that also play the game for you and train your skills! Crazy!
---
They're against the rules. Problem is Jagex can't be assed investing money in their client and know if they ban clients they'll lose a lot of their playerbase.
---
That would be Awsome man. I love the neitz helm but I got to go with the best in slot :/
---
Wow! Did you know after talking to kree arra jr it dies and then you can run around and make it dance? Has to be while its "dead"
---
P.s. Not going to mention what KC i got lucky with... big grats man!

I always wondered what happend to you. I still pull up your 4 way drama video with SonOfOldSchool, and a few others :(
---
That's what the slayer staff is for.
---
hey at least you got 4 mil xp in strength and 1.33 mil xp in hp. pretty damn good if you ask me. just kill the boss 10 times and you get 99 hp.
---
why?
---
Ok, this is getting out of hand
---
Punishments back in the mandatory censor days were handed out like candy. I got muted for 2 weeks once because a rune noob at castle wars asked me how i got all my money and my reply was "I haxed jagex". I got another 2 week mute telling the story shortly after I had been unmuted.
---
Yes but house access also gives me the ability to restore my run which saves me money on pots
---
nice sbubby
---
At least it's worth something, mine dropped at 300k value lol
---
Thought this was a OSRS twerk video
---
The best money maker in free to play is killing ogresses. Once you complete dragon slayer, there's a place you can safe spot to kill mostly mages in the f2p resource area in corsairs cove.
---
You'll want a chisel and crafting to cut diamonds, and magic to cast high alch. You'll need to bring fire runes and some natures to start out.
---
Just what was requested of the commission. I also generally draw females on the thicker side.
---
Eww gross, you want to cook with river water in a society with plumbing?
---
That was also a special request of the commission! I just draw what I'm told haha.
---
Another idea they had was to make agility f2p until like lvl20
---
Did you use ecu keys?
---
You mean rsmalls?
---
Ah that's still cool. Was curious if you found some kind of no clip.
---
It‚Äôs a great catch-all helm with a prayer bonus and no negative offenses to range or magic; I think that alone makes it relevant
---
This isn't true is it?
---
What's the ideal prayer points to have when cerb summons the 3 ghosts? Without spectral.
---
Would it be 61 (or low 60s, 62, 63) so that the 3rd hit will only drain a few prayer points yet allow you to still block the damage?
---
That...is true.  Hm.
---
Yeah, that or low 30s and either take the hit or get fast at sipping prayer potions
---
True. I wish they made firemaking more afk
---
 Almost pulled all my hair out going from 50 to 70 on mobile.

my one is a weird one - i got to mid 2100s total (excluding post 07 skills summoning, dung, etc) back in RS2. But then I quit in 2012 (because of EoC, felt like a different game, MTX). So my goal in OSRS is to surpass what I achieved almost 10 years ago
---
That's actually sick lol
---
Looks super OP ,what‚Äôs your combat level
---
This is (atleast to some extent) like saying : make trident of the swamp relevant again. Netz is relevant and used in many scenarios, the serp helm is just an upgrade. (Which it should, seeing at is over 50x the cost at almost any given point, and uses scales aswell as an additional cost)

The only reason I don't care for hardcore. Even if you have great wired internet and are confident, it just takes one power outage, or even just a fluke for the internet to go out. The further you get, and have more raw hours played the more you are likely to of have it happen. 
---
Just the way it goes with online games sometimes. It'd be cool if you could like have tethered internet from your phone kick in if you have a sudden DC from your landline you are still rolling off something. I think you can do something like that for severs but not with a tethered phone, just with Ethernet. Maybe if it's a 4g router you could.

Huh thats odd when I used it I said the tip and someone answered back, different clan maybe, this was over a year ago.

A pure is not solely defined as a 1 def account. The origin of the label ‚Äúpure‚Äù pertains to an account with self imposed restrictions in order to fit a certain combat bracket. The 1 defence pure happens to be the most popular due to ease of creating one and the versatility that comes with it. There are lots of different pures out there, e.g Piety pure, initiate pure, zerker pure, 13 def pure,

I'm 93 farming and I spent no more than 1mil on farming due to farming contracts, the amount of seeds you get are ridiculous. I believe at the moment I have close to 97 farming banked like I said I spent next to no money, I suggest adding in farming contracts to reduce cost greatly! Like I said I spent no more than 1mil. To be fair some of my seeds also came from bird house runs as well, if you fit those in with farm runs(takes 5mins) you'll save the gp.
---
RuneScape is about setting your own goals. If you lack any goals, you're going to feel bored and aimless. My buddy had a goal of finishing all the quests. He did it, flaunted his cape for a while, then quit. With SotE released, he's coming back to get his cape back.
---
My goal is 99 Runecrafting. I'll probably be finished slightly after the sun burns out.
---
True I agree tbh. See it all over my social media and I‚Äôm like well it‚Äôs great all you guys are against this but wtf can anyone do. Just don‚Äôt have children and hope you‚Äôll die before it gets too bad.

I honestly hate slayer.  Like, a lot.  Grinding it for Monkey Madness was one of the most miserable grinds for the quest I did, but NMZ looks like a nice way to train- especially with all the imbues it offers, and I need salve (ei) for revs with a blowpipe since supposedly elder maul is trash

also it‚Äôs f2p

What you're seeing is a vocal minority of people who get a lot of attention on Reddit and Twitter. Yes, most players who have been playing OSRS for a long time and who are invested in the game are very focused on efficiency. There are far more players like yourself who just want to play at their own pace and have fun which is great. 
---
What you need to remember about 2010 is that a lot of us were just teenagers back then and we didn't know how to play efficiently/didn't care to do so. These days when we're all so much older, with so many real life responsibilities (study, work, families), playing efficiently is important to people so they can feel like they're getting the most out of their time. 
---
Old School has changed a lot since the 2007 backup it began as. One of the few things that hasn't been updated and really shouldn't (else we'd stray too far from the Old School feel) is graphics. I'd argue that the UI and combat system also fall into this category. Those 3 things are so beloved by most players that to change them would cause many players to quit - it wouldn't be a smart financial decision for Jagex at all.
---
Nah
---
1. Tag healers one by one, keeping an eye on Jad just before his attack animation goes off. This may require setting the blowpipe to long range so you don‚Äôt get dragged into melee range of Jad.
---
2. Drag healers away from Jad and line them up so only 1 of them is damaging you. May take a couple tries to position. 
---
3. Focus on Jad for the remainder of the fight. Set blowpipe back to rapid. 
---
I used this technique at 79 range 75 def I‚Äôm blessed Dhide/addy darts only and didn‚Äôt need to touch any potions during Jad.

If they can reliably detect some sort of loss of connection which isn't an explicitly intentional log out, they should add a feature which HCIMs can toggle on to use any **currently applicable** teleport they have on them in the event of an abnormal loss of connection.
---
Honestly Vorkath is still one of your best bets if you can kill him somewhat quickly. 
---
Demonic gorillas are a great option too, slightly worse *on average* than Vorkath but with a 1/300 chance to get a drop worth 11mil so if you get lucky they're absolutely insane.

I would love to see 2H Staves be a viable thing compared to 1H Staves. Though I am not sure if just putting 5% on the Obby Staff would fix it, but it would be something. I'd rather see it gain the Berserker Necklace buff (20% Damage, which is still +10% over Occult).

Yeah shit like this is why I will never bother with making a hardcore. Imagine putting countless hours into an account, playing extremely safe in pretty much all the content you have to do, only to die to some shit completely out of your control. What a joke

No, enjoy the incoming ban.

But in all seriousness, congrats, this is everyone's wet dream.

My issue isn't with 3PC existing. It's with allowing macros in these 3PC. Couldnt they come out with a rule saying "hey, 1 input : 1 output only"?

Higher ups in Jagex don't want to come off the money to pay the devs to update their client and the devs of RL&amp;OSB probably make more money in their day to day job while working on their client as a hobby than Jagex would pay them.

This game needs nightmode. OFC to toggle it if u want it or not. I think it would be sick.

Why not mobile?

Not right now. But send me a dm and I‚Äôll send discord link. Also join my clan chat and other people may be on as well.

probably not lol

It was actually a compliment.. Im sure none of yall have ever seen or heard of the chapelle show.. Its a black thing.. And clearly this board lacks black people.. Nothing was racist at all about what i said and it got downvoted.. Only due to majority of white people thinking i said somethong wrong.. You fucking neckbeards

Added you bro

I still remember waaay back in like '04 I was mining was and saw a guy named The Magical Shart. It was dope.
---
Good job!
---
Cheers, will add you now man
---
Yes, it is.  [Take a look at this wiki article](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ornate_armour) to see how to get it.
---
Jeez everyone been getting rangers recently on this sub
---
Congratulations!, well done :)
---
The problem with this is I'll be keep this account pure range.
---
I don't understand how ya'll do this
---
How do I know when to use prayer and when I should use tank armor during slayer? I have barrows gloves, full proselyte and base 65‚Äôs in all combat stats, no btw.

This is the kind of shit-my-pants level of game knowledge and efficiency I come here for.

What a poser.
---
Sucks to see them die in any way tbh. Arguably its more sad to see them die to something that they easily prepared for
---
It hasn't actually been proven yet one way or the other, but personally I'm hoping it's more natural than not, since otherwise we haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of adapting before we die off.
---
You are crying.
---
It's okay.
---
Ornate Armour is very difficult to get.

Definitely not. That's inventory slot that could be used for the quests e.g. food, stamina potions, required items.

Woah nice haha

You don‚Äôt even need that many supplies at fight caves at 86 ranged with that good of gear just buy about 100-150 dragon darts and when you‚Äôre on the last switch them into your bp and you out dos the healers by a lot...I mean A LOT. Ez scape then
---
The so called developers of now, are a bunch fucking stank-ass, whores. My opinion and I reserve the right to it, cowards. You'll never silence me in real life. I will put it forth to destroy the entity that dares silence me. How dare you deprive me.

I think everyone is different at the end of the day when it comes to this. I have a similar job to Cynthenes, not to the extent of playing runescape and being allowed to do that but a lot of down time where I can read reddit, watch youtube etc. And honestly that's the main reason I'm still at this job. It's stress free I can just come in and relax. Is the job challenging at all? No. Could I get a better job somewhere else that pays more and is more effort? Yes. But I don't see a point when I have enough money to do what I want and the job is so easy I don't see a point in doing anything else. But I have a friend who like you said he couldn't do it since he likes to be busy and try and progress further. I just don't see the point personally, a stress free life is a happy life and I'd like to live a happy life. :)
---
Yup this should be addressed, not everyone knows what attack styles even do. Would help newbies a lot.
---
Thanks reddit.
---
So just pull internet cable :-)

was thinking 83 but at 84 you can boost for the best portal nexus. thankyou

It has been proven that climate change is real, and that we (humans) are accelerating the process beyond what is acceptable. You can go to a ton of different reports to find that it is a thing, including NASA.gov
---
So yes, we are fucking it up in a sense, and we shouldn't fuck it up more for future generations. Don't give the other side any validity that we should just keep doing what were doing

Nice

With an efficient blocklist and cancels you'll hit 99 range before 99 melees on controlled solely from cannon tasks.
---
Serp helm would be usefull since you won‚Äôt be needing anti venoms anymore.
---
Because they aren‚Äôt loaded into view, I told you how to test it, and you‚Äôre arguing instead of testing it yourself and then calling other people who know more about it than you idiots.
---
Why do you think there is an initial download to YOUR computer? What do you think that‚Äôs all about? The server doesn‚Äôt give two shits about what it looks like to you, the server doesn‚Äôt even need to have a map to do what it needs to do, the only person who needs to see anything is you and you alone! The server just needs to know your position and how it relates to other people and npcs in the game
---
You know what? Tell me the algorithms used, tell me what database they are using on the server, tell me the communication protocols it‚Äôs using etc etc, explain it all to me then if you know so much about how it‚Äôs done... if you know so much, then explain it all to me? How about that huh? Instead of me taking time to explain simple stuff to you, why don‚Äôt you explain your complex idea and why it‚Äôs so complex but hey I also want to hear about how you‚Äôre going to manage resources and memory leaks etc...  Also tell me what makes code spaghetti code vs what doesn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt need to explain anything to you it seems if you have so much knowledge, where can I buy your book on the subject? What courses do you teach for game development? If you have such a vast knowledge that even I who has been in software development for almost 20 years now know less than you, then please I‚Äôd happily learn from you if you have courses etc that will give more knowledge on the subject than even experienced developers.
---
Please show me your courses and publications, if love to read them or see them if you‚Äôre so knowledgeable, I honestly would.

Osrs art has been really on point lately

Actually over population is certainly not a problem and probably never will be. Hans rosling did a splendid presentation on that quite awhile back. There was also a ted talk on it I believe. Definitely worth the watches! https://youtu.be/2LyzBoHo5EI
---
Then you‚Äôre incredibly lucky or just don‚Äôt remember. 
---
The servers fairly often have some minor hiccups, and probably once a year there‚Äôs a major bad patch. 
---
Also with that playtime you must have played back when the servers were being attacked a couple of years ago. How did you avoid that?
---
Fucking Bart m8
---
Every single game does this dude.

Gz!
---
Let me tell you a little story about RNG....
---
All your stats would be in the 90s if you started slayer from level 3 but it's more efficient to start slayer at 85 combat for better tasks and experience per hour
---
the amount of things i've got over the drop rate as well, like pepehands
---
Oh thank god I thought it was me.
---
Doug Dimmadome, owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome.
---
oh wow cool man
---
hue hue boohoo buff my stacked obby staffs is all I hear
---
Eh I‚Äòm getting 70k+ ranged xp/h at vork(which is crazy considering it‚Äòs my best $$$ maker) so I think getting 99 there wouldn‚Äòt be too bad a move in terms efficiency
---
I got rigour and max gear except for pegasians
---
That is the only thing that makes Jad difficult...the panic.
---
The correct way would be to have 18 clients loaded you casual.
---
There is a large portion that play as mobile only so just by being on pc you have a leg up. People with runelite will have many qol features you dont but the game is the same so don't feel discouraged and have fun :)
---
You can pretty easily get over 1M pts/h, even with those stats. Look up a guide, but in particular you need to have the DT bosses and the Dream Mentor bosses. One of them, the Inadaquecy I think gives like 50k points per kill.
---
that's not what OC is
---
Look into getting a fighter torso. Otherwise obsidian is good, but maybe pricey
---
not to mention the hour long buildup
---
They did this in Rs2. or was it rs3 by then?
---
Ill see your short-sighted ass in the inferno
---
Huh?
---
Bomber outfit.. on a plane... Hmm..
---
Yes they are invaluable
---
Are ranarrs/snapdragons really worth it compared to toadflax runs? Looking at the wiki it seems on average toadflax nets 14,1 kgp per seed, while ranarrs and snapdragons yield 15,6 k and 15,0 k gp per seed respectively. Am I misunderstanding the numbers, or do the more expensive herbs only give about a thousand more gp per patch, at a potential risk of losing 50k when they die?
---
literally who rofl
---
I Think It Is Worth It To Train Up An Account To Kill Endgame Bosses And Raid And Slayer Bosses, I Think It Is.
---
Getting thru bank pin means u have an infected computer unless you were phished or it was something easy like your birth year, completely reset ur computer
---
2147m is also a lot more iconic than just an infinite cash stack
---
Probably beset to refrain commenting when you don't know what you're talking about
---
I find it best not to rwt
---
Literally the whole point of hcim is the fact there is no garauntee.
---
Names are sold for rs gp
---
There's so much wrong with your comment I don't even know where to begin.
---
&gt; All of it is still just work for the sake of work 
---
What I am describing clearly does't align with the definition of "for the sake of."   You're not just working to work, as I stated in another comment.  You're working for job security, building a plethora of skills and a track record that can be looked positively on by a future employer etc.
---
&gt; no greater vision or meaning 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by this.  The greater vision is being a more productive human being and securing a better future for those around you.
---
&gt;  Work your ass off to be some executive you're still just an office worker behind a desk 
---
You're blatantly trivializing the impact of what being a valuable member of a company at a higher level means for someone by stating that they work at a desk as well.
---
&gt; at least the guy playing runescape is enjoying himself. 
---
Who is also, funnily enough, at a desk.  Playing a game at work is *very* different than playing a game at home.
---
What's everyone up to?
---
U can get 99 slayer as your first 99, how else there would be untrimmed slayer capes
---
I believe theres a thread on the osrs page. I recall hearing about it in a video once.
---
Idk why I got downvoted, if your making oak doors demon isn't recommended. I used demon til almost 90 and it jus didn't make sense to anymore.
---
Find someone with name
---
Ask for price of name
---
Pay price for name
---
Get scammed
---
Come back to reddit asking why you got scammed.
---
In all seriousness don't waste your time, you'll get scammed most of the time. Jagex obviously do not care as they've stated it's a "do at your own risk" sort of thing. However buying it with RWT is bannable.
---
A quick google would tell you that name trading is considered a RWT
---
Doesn‚Äôt really seem like a big deal to me. Makes it very slightly more afk but doesn‚Äôt affect xp rates at all.
---
Yo I think that's my clan mate.
---
Whiny bitch good riddance
---
Your complainging that jagex did theyre job and saved your account? Btw you chose to disable the pin so thats your problem.
---
Post it a few more times for good measure!
---
Is it? To me HCIM feels like a gamemode based on skill, where if you can survive forever while doing dangerous content and get rare items, then you deserve the prestige.
---
Dying by connection problems, not only does it suck, but it goes against the entire point of the mode.
---
Who was it at the dmm where they got jagex'd and straight up said that on camera? Point is he was laughing and though was a little salty, didnt care at the end of the day. He was there to have fun. I have a HCIM and I wanna go as far as I can of course. If i die at 1100 total lvl I'm not going to reset though. Basically, if you play this game mode and are going to quit if you die, just go to the lava maze teleport now. Death and taxes are unavoidable.
---
I have a recommendation for all of you, runelite Bank tabs.
---
Save your setup once and then you'll never fuck up and take strength potions ever again
---
Them bezels though
---
please make it happen
---
Good that you hid your fps and run energy, almost had your account right there
---
Pieces
---
If u can afford the bond definitely p2p the account will end up being better and easier to make with lower HP, and being able to afk sand crabs/nmz for better exp with better gear/pots
---
I take every opportunity to crash the bots
---
Getting a promotion at your job is more engaging and rewarding than playing a game.  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  What are you even arguing. No ambition Amy over here trying to downplay being a productive person.

I did an addy spectees task in the catacomb until I realized I should be using my torture lol
---
Pices
---
But where is the line drawn? server laggs blame jagex, internet drops blame isp, power goes out blame god, dog pulls the power chord blame the dog, Sneeze and miss a prayer flick blame the kid who got you sick?
---
look at osrs wiki... glassblowing battlestaffs dhid bodies or gems
---
Not only do you get free xp from quests (without hp), you also get better xp/hr and a lot more afk training for the rest of the bond. Or if you enjoy the f2p training nostalgia as well, you can go slay some cows instead
---
It's a known fact that jagex servers are unstable. There's a reason every hcim wears a pneck and ring of life.
---
What does he want? He wants to complain but makes no suggestion.   Literally its just pvp.
---
Are there other methods apart from trading crystal seeds?
---
The more quest points you have, the more time you get. Quest points are not spent. You can play it once a week assuming you've earned at least 100k xp or 1 quest point since you last played it.
---
Could we get another hind on the Prifddinas bell puzzle?

We understand that i has to do something with three bells.

Mod Ash said "Listen". Listen to what?

Please, i would like to sleep atleast one night without thinking about this.
---
Is to possibly die* no matter the cause.
---
Same with any game with hardcore style game play. Happens in every game and people realize it's the nature of the beast. That's why you play carefully.
---
STAY WOLE PEOPLE!
---
When they go in for spec basically. If you see they're at like 40 HP and you're at 50, venge and just safe up to try and make them kill themselves. Also, use it everytime you go in for a spec yourself. Even if they just hit you with a 20 MSB hit, that extra 15 damage comboed with a high spec will help kill them.
---
The stranger things intro song Is absolute slapfest, and it's one of the few intros I'll never skip.
---
Judging by the replies to my comment my view on the matter is irrational.  We *are* on a sub for a game so I should have expected it.
---
See you in a week when you post about your account being jacked cuz you RWT
---
You get 1 tick of time inside the cave for each quest point you currently have. If you have 100 qp, you stay inside for 100 game ticks. 
---
If you've gained 100k xp or 1 qp since last week, you can go back in again. You don't use up your quest points or anything. 100k xp is easy to get in a week so don't worry about rationing your quests.
---
Good thing I never said that. Didn't want to trigger you.
---
I said possibly dying is part of it. The dcs unfortunately are one aspect of the game that's hardly changed. It's not a part of the game mode, just an aspect of the game that we have to live with (for now?), so yes it should be considered when making a hcim. If it's not something you want to chance, don't play the game mode...
---
You have the most pvper name ever...
---
My fastest load was achieved when a woman accidentally looked at me once.
---
Completely different people are responsible
---
Peep my KD though
---
Bon jovi ma dude!
---
Nice, then you will definitely shorten the runecrafting grind by doing that. I was averaging like 9k exp with lumby hard done, and all quest points. I could probably do better, but im lowballing just to give people an idea.
---
"mod audi" got me good
---
So? I‚Äôm talking about your name. Never said you were actually a pvper or any good at it.
---
Not a pure btw, 50 attack piety, NOT a pure
---
3 months to get internet? Shit I would of done that second I got a new place purely for scape XD
---
I was hoping the music would be sea shanty 2.
---
Yea I wish they would too. I'm fine with standard tree/wall hugging but the DD meta is proper cancer.
---
The only thing good about this video is the shirt.
---
gosh dang it...
---
Pretty much nobody would play a single minigame except the one that gives the most loot per hour. Also that shop would be insane-sized. PC and Barb Ass alone have too many reward options. If you combine them all, the shop will be like a book.
---
And worse than Nieve's cave in RSPS-vibes. 1 minigame to get all untradables and exp rewards in the game?
---
Yeah, people who enjoy the game differently shouldn't get rewarded for doing that.
---
Ya bro idk wtf I'm doing with my life lol. I blame the gf.
---
Zalcano is just a boss and not a minigame, just like Wintertodt
---
yeah but ur woefully under droprate
---
Good cuz fk pvp
---
I don't think its because your view is irrational, there is nothing wrong with wanting to work and be productive. I think it's because your views on it give off a very Hollywood vibe on how promotions actually work in a corporate world. For every hard working success story like your brother there tens of thousands of people doing the same as your brother and being overlooked because the vast majority of the time promotions are from networking not working hard.
---
Haha it's a joke. I put my setup in surround to play GTA V last night. After that I was like, we gatta try OSRS! Lol
---
Sometimes a break can be nice then you come back and smack that xp bar :)
---
No pet? Smh
---
I'm just on the cusp of making decent money, 72 slayer and almost have the stats / gear for profit snek etc
---
Y rune gloves tho
---
Rewarding people who are good at PvP with powerful PvP gear would just exacerbate problems that the Wilderness already has.
---
Sounds like a great idea
---
Trying to get to the goutweed was very fun...
---
There's some really cool ones in there. A good bit are useful for all players too.
---
I got one in 37kc, so far I've caught about 75implings.
---
72 water runes? You're rich!
---
OSRS made around twice as much profit as rs3 last year
---
I am not in the mood to do quest to kill RFD boss.
---
Nice.
---
You really got your head in the game didn‚Äôt you?
---
i'd argue trying to leave was more fun with all those doors^^
---
They rated Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of the Sky a 4/10
---
Make it easier for pvpers to kill pvmers in the wilderness? That's a no vote!
---
I see, is it worth losing ice barrage over one cb level though?
---
What was your starting inv? I'm playing on an Ironman and was debating whether or not I could do jad w/ a similar gear setup to yours and 70rng &amp;def.
---
The eleven thing fits a lot more here
---
Divine magic potion
---
You can do gem mining in the Shilo Village mine (requires a certain level of the Karamja diary). It makes great gp/hr, and you get better xp that motherlode.
---
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
---
I ended up having a conversation with him. He was a really nice dude.
---
Get that 43 prayer, get your range up with slayer or something, and most importantly, quest for barrows gloves!!!
---
i stopped playing but man  i love this reddit still lol
---
It happened 6 years ago and I still have it in the spank bank.
---
can't spend bonds on fire cape
---
I'm gonna say prolly not a bug, just start over and see how she goes
---
To be fair I forgot about avas. I think about it as locked behind quests more than PVM but you do kinda have to do 50 kc so fair enough. Infernal cape is exactly how it should be,, best in slot, earned I'm sure PVM and PVPers alike can appreciate that. Other stuff isn't BIS so doesn't matter.
---
That's a dead tree, that only requires 1 wc
---
pvp gear was bis for PVP for the first 2 years of the base game until  AQ40 &amp; Naxx gear was released and that's only because that was the end of the base games life cycle and the next expansion was coming out.
---
Wow released in November 2004.
---
AQ40 wasn't released until January 2006. Nax came out in August 2006.  PVP Gear was BIS for PVP the majority of the games release.
---
&gt;The risk of being killed by a player is PVP content.
---
No, it's not, lol.
---
&gt;Am I complaining? No you and C engineer are mad that you can't get more BIS rewards for PVP because the community doesn't want it. Most PVP changes are forced through as "integrity" just so PVPers can get more of what they want by complaining on twitter
---
I'm not complaining at all about the LMS rewards. I'm not even good at PvP, so I wouldn't get the rewards anyway. I'm complaining about consistent abuse of the poll system by PvM players because I'm not a jackass that ruins the game for others. You're slowly going to make the game die if you don't vote for what's in the game's best interest. Whether you like it or not, PvP is crucial for the success of OSRS.
---
2? Try 10..... :-/
---
i'd put you on ignore for saying yikes tbh
---
Do you het more xp from training Slayer in the wilderness?
---
What pokemon is that?
---
But how can you possibly have an accurate expected value in PvP?
---
Just like PKing as a whole.
---
Well get that or guthix. At the very least the prayer bonus will.help lots. Easy clues are super fast and will help layer down the line anyway
---
There's more than 1 reason, but here's the best one: it would never pass a poll
---
We need an r/osrccirclejerk for shit like this
---
True dat, tips on getting the clues? I mean doing them is easy but getting them
---
That code in this particular instance never entered the game. We know Jagex doesn‚Äôt pay its people that well, and the dude literally bought an Audi, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to assume they caught him about to enter in the code this time and discovered that he had been doing it before for a while.
---
Why does it look like something that could actually happe  from our devs
---
Yes, it pauses everything happening in the game as the entire server lags. Personally dc just disconnects you from the server.
---
Heavy disagree, they're actually pretty comparable imo. Maybe not as potentially impactful but certainly a big update.
---
Participating in player vs player is PVP content thats just a fact.
---
&gt;I'm complaining about consistent abuse of the poll system by PvM players 
---
voting for what you want isn't an abuse 
---
&gt;PvP is crucial for the success of OSRS. 
---
No it isn't, quests and new PVM content are, the numbers prove that
---
It really is pretty much all on Jed
---
Thieves ham members
---
What's your current xp I'll do the math for you
---
Jad can even hit 97 through Armadyl
---
Pretty easy. For example, have rewards locked behind a roll (say 1/256) and give a roll for every win (or x wins). Good players will come out on top in the long run.
---
Are the existing magic armors in the game still going to be changed even though warding didn't pass?
---
Canonballs are decent. You can afk for 2 1/2 mins
---
Kbd for black slayer helm. Currently 214 kc and no head drop :(
---
Its been about a year and a few months tho
---
3000 IQ gold sink idea. Take the value of a nice car worth of OSRS gold out of the game.
---
just another reason why you kill everyone in the wilderness then, because pvmers like this carry a 2.5m gp stack of cosmics
---
Onlyhelmets
---
They‚Äôve confirmed multiple times that Jed didn‚Äôt even have access to anything that would allow him to Id players in real life, nor would RoT have needed that to figure out IP addresses of other players, so that‚Äôs likely not the source of the attacks
---
When a new masterclue requires an item, using it to represent the market  is less genuine than the girlfriend you bought at lumbridge
---
Osrs boo
---
&gt;Not jagexs job to sustain a minority of the players hobby by giving pkers people to kill
---
id love to see beginner and easy clues drop from all pirates, including the ones found in wildy so people hunting them with imbued rings have more a reason to kill the ones by the wrecked ship
---
I have a suspicion that he doesn't want to PvP at all and doesn't want to be locked out of the rewards that would come from PvP content. 
---
Self-interest at the expense of others, really.
---
Op you got a link to that spreadsheet?
---
I don't even play anymore but I come for the memes
---
"Spits water" HAHA!
---
none of them are valid suggestions though, they wouldn't affect PvM at all and only affect PvP negatively and you're saying voting no to them is the problem with PvPer's?
---
We are talking controlled environment within a minigame. Where you're put in to face random opponents, and there can only be one winner.
---
Not an entire runescape map.
---
It would take a pretty big organization to fix every game of LMS so insure consistent wins. 
---
Also we are suggesting bis gear only in pvp so it shouldn't really affect prices. Ags, and toxic staff might take a hit, but it's pretty reasonable.
---
You clearly got dropped on your head at a young age evident by your ironman status so the game wanted to protect your virtual future from a similar misshap. 
---
Jokes aside, I had the same type of drops but woth Ahrims hood instead of Veracs helm.  First 13 items were helmets :/
---
1. Those are all minigames. Minigames, in general, are DEAD content. The majority of current players are efficiency freaks. You even said it earlier. If you can't do it in max gear, then it's bad. Those aren't dead because PvP is dead content. There's also the fact that there are too many worlds, so the community aspect of the game is dead.
---
You're missing the point. If MA2 was polled today, it would FAIL. HARD. You've said multiple times you don't like MA2, lol. It causes you too much trouble. It's "necessary" PvM content in the wild. You hate it.
---
You're just wrong, lol.
---
Thanks for the tip bro. I'll try that out :D
---
Congrats :)

I'm sure he nutted in his face when this happened to him

You make really good assumptions tbh, you've been right about everything even some how recognizing the fact I've played OSRS LMAO, much appreciation and respect for this advice, thank you üëç
---
Your head was in the game and not your heart.
---
Well I think that they could be valid, dinhs for example is far too weak for the content it is from. But I'm not talking about those idea specifically I am trying to say people don't like to vote for updates that would make it harder for them to do what they want. If I want to make money at revs, I wouldn't want it to be easier to kill me would I? It's selfish but it's logical.
---
When was the last time skilling introduced Bis gear?
---
You can't do that to this degree in RuneLite. The terrain effects force the camera to pan a certain way.

Pking clans have gear requirements E.G you need 15 sets of pking gear in your bank at all times, only real level requirement is 94 Mage although main clans usually don't accept people under 115 combat. As well as things like ancient mace, hasta, barrows gloves etc
---
No pking clan will decline you for having low skilling stats although they'll encourage you to push for 2k total to pk on skill worlds but it's not a requirement. They want you out pking with them not trying to hit EHP every week
---
No you are wrong as you have misrepresented my opinion I think that mage arena 2 is perfectly fine content, nothing special but fine. Let's put that aside though.
---
Look at the worlds list, scroll down and look at the PVP worlds, they are dead. Go into the wilderness and count how many players you can find then run around catacombs. It's common knowledge that PVP is dead in this game I can't believe you are denying that.
---
&gt;The majority of current players are efficiency freaks
---
You clearly just hate the community, so leave, go play a different game
---
They're just mad because they get pked in the wild.
---
üÜóüÜí
---
What?
---
The bulwark is currently in a good spot. They are hard to kill unless you get a good spec, and that when I'm risking 5m with a claws +1. I usually don't waste my time with pvmers unless they are in obvious risk. 
---
I just recently did 90 prayer using a dihns myself, got attacked a lot, never died because dihns is pretty good. 
---
I get teleblocked every day I pk, wouldn't change it. If you protect magic it's barely any time at all until you can teleport. I bet in total I've been teleblocked longer than you've ever even been in the wilderness tbh. It's only an issue if it's unexpected and your supplies are drained. 
---
Depends on the update? If it was a healthy change I probably would, if I was a spiteful change i wouldn't.

I do agree that people that don't do both PvP and PvE are selfishly ruining it both ways, I just thought your examples were too awful to not call out, sorry haha
---
I'm not saying those suggestions are good ideas, I'm trying to make the point that people will vote for what benefits them, I;m not sure I made that point well though,
---
They edited loads of untradables to have minimum values to stop things like that happening. It was the same time they updated it to GE values for tradeable items so things like dragon platelegs don't protect over a whip
---
why are only people who never played vanilla hype for classic? 
---
pvp was dominated by those with better gear from raids, who just got lucky on the drops. vanilla pvp was almost zero skill required, just abusing eng and being better geared. people keyboard turned, backpedalled and clicked their abilities and still facerolled everyone if they were better geared. vanilla is definitely not the wow game to play if you want pvp action LMFAO.
---
Aaaand its dead
---
Dude stfu
---
Definitely cant recommend Zulrah with that low range/mage if you dont already know the boss. 
---
However, you have 74 slayer, meaning you can do kurasks, skeletal wyverns, soon gargoyles and brutal black dragons. All of these range from around 400k to 1mill per hour and all of them are very afk aswell. Though i dont personally recommend brutal blacks without either dhcb or tbow, so maybe scratch that. My point is that you should just get your combat stats up through slayer, which will make you lots of money. Then you can spend that money on boss gear.
---
Things like zulrah ends up being worse than gargoyles without the proper stats and gear, especially when you factor in the increased effort. Zulrah is around 115k on average per kill, so if you're doing several kills per trip, thats pretty good. But if you take 5 minutes to get one kill and spend an entire inventory of sharks and prayer pots, then thats pretty awful.
---
If you're looking for something else to do than slayer, then barrows is great for med-levels aswell, easily 1m+ per hour with hard diary.
---
probably my mistake I'm not advocating for those ideas specifically just trying to give examples.
---
Completely agree with him, it and skilling as well, deserve top end weps/armor/equip from their end game activities.

I‚Äôm using runelite with absolutely no problems on a 2019 MacBook Pro (most recent refresh) and I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre having issues on a 2018 model despite Mac OS not being great with Java. 
---
You might want to look into whether or not there‚Äôs a solution to why Runelite isn‚Äôt playable for you or consider an alternative before playing on the default client imo
---
I don't know the average. Saw someone with a few hundred chests on here and it wasn't good. 
---
You need to take into account the potential profit you're forgoing by opening the chests. Turning the crystal shards into dust and making divine potions is a lot better money per shard. My guess as to why crystal keys are cheaper is because people stockpiled them in hopes for this new chest and now the supply exceeds the demand since the chests turned out to be kind of bad money
---
Yo do get rewarded just not in the way you want, but let‚Äôs not pretend that you‚Äôre not getting rewarded. It‚Äôs hard to have BiS gear from pvp because there‚Äôs no set difficulty level, so it‚Äôs hard to develop a reward system without the best players getting the best gear then increasing their advantage, locking people out of the rewards.
---
Wonder how much he makes
---
Better off burying em, making more money in the time spent banking etc and buying d bones and knocking out your wanted prayer LVL.

Melee is a lot better DPS bc Broad Bolts have shit stats. At max stats Melee ends up being like &gt;1m gp/hr but Ranged caps at around 700-800k gp/hr

This has come up before and while I like the idea, it is not really feasible. Reddit only allows for 2 announcements at a time, top and bottom. The top is where the daily question thread is posted, which is often requested whenever it goes missing in favor of other announcements. The bottom tends to be full between updates, dev blogs, events, or whatever else we have to put there. A weekly thread would only work if it stayed there the whole week and with our current situation, I doubt that will be the case. If we ever move some of the announcement threads to the sidebar, like game updates or events, it might be more viable to consider another thread like that.

Not sure what you're trying to say there. But the way cml works is looking at high scores when they update and none of the 5 minute records are actually 5 minutes. They're all at least 6 hour records. It's a really dumb catagory

No one is making you pvp, and none of the suggestions have been for bis pvm gear. 
---
If you're a main just buy it from the ge if you want it, if you're an iron man you chose the restriction.

Youre just voting no because you don't understand it.

Exactly right. PvM has a set difficulty that everyone has to face or methods to lower the difficulty (like gear or a larger team). PvP doesn‚Äôt and all depends on who you‚Äôre fighting, so it can‚Äôt give the best rewards bc it isn‚Äôt fair

You are wrong. It's not even up for debate it's a proven fact that rcbow+ broads is better on high defence npcs. None of the dps calcs take into account the monster youre fighting defence. And once again only the msb(I) outclasses the cbow on lower defence npcs, if it's a regular msb then cbow is always better.

But what I'm saying is that's all relative. It's decent money, but you'd make more of you made divine super combat potions. If you don't have the herb lvl for the good divine potions or if you just get a rush from opening loot chests, I think they're a decent use of crystal shards.
---
You don't need to game the system to get records, Bailey just did all 4 hunter records perfectly legit. This one specifically was with stored sqirk juice.
---
But theres a totally safe stall just a little bit to the east. You're only ever banking every 30min for strange fruit and golovanova tops. Seems kind of silly to trap the 2 guard dogs in the town square and risk your low HP hcim

From what I've tested it's about 5k per shard profit from chests whereas making shards into divine ranging/super combats is closer to 12k per shard.

Okay but if the opinion is ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù then why comment?

I don‚Äôt necessarily agree, but think of it like this. If there were no reward for BA or PC, absolutely no one would play it. I think rewards would be neat, but I‚Äôd rather see development go somewhere else.
---
At lease LMS has fun going for it.
---
We need stable servers first.
---
LMS should have *worthwhile* rewards, and unique rewards are fine so long as their only application is for PvP. Rune Pouch (especially prior to being able to get it through wildy bosses) was a bad idea since it was such a staple for PvM, and, ironically, not for PvP since it was so expensive and lost on death. The learning curve for PvP is steep and it's certainly not for everyone, so putting content that's BIS for PvM in there isn't great design. But I have no problem with LMS being good gp/hr, or even giving content like Wilderness armour. Oh well.

I don't think anyone cares about the random metal enough to work out how it works.
---
You could tweet mod ash, or just leave it on for a while and keep records of what happens to see if you can work it out.
---
It depends on the content. Its not about what lends itself to making pking easier or harder, though sure, i get pvmers dont want to die.  Rather its whats fair. In a compedative activity you cant have content thats overly powerful for one side or the other. Simply from a game design perspective you need balance. 
---
Look at it this way though. Players die ALL The time. If not in pvp, then pvm due to afking, making a mistake, learning a boss, etc. and its not a big deal, its part of the game. You‚Äôre a smart guy, pretty easy to see with how well you articulate your arguments.  So the question is why is pvm and pking so different?  The death mechanics.  Pvm deaths are a minor inconvenience. They have been since the ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô death mechanics were added. And pk deaths? Never changed! 
---
If pvm deaths carried more risk; the potential to lose items or something, do you think pvp deaths would be as frusterating as you see them now? Probably not! And thats the root cause between pvp and pvm. Im not suggesting a solution here, i dont exactly have one.  But i do love pvm and i do love pking. Its so fun and engaging to me, edge style that is. Please support us so we can have content and enjoy the game. I know it can be frusterating when you die or get ags speced or when someone obnoxiously tries to teleblock you by kbd. But pvp is bigger than that, and if things were different, updated, etc. you might even enjoy it.

Revs were an awful update for pking. Yeah its cool there is a spot you can go to find fights and people to kill, but it really is fish in a barrel. Its not engaging and the counterplay is having the biggest clan.
---
It worsened the image of pking by a huge margin.  Even myself a pker, gets frusterated and angry dying at revs because its just getting piled by clans when your tryna make cash.   This update should have been done differently.
---
Idealy, the wilderness itself, shouldnt be getting updates, rather pking should be. New weapons, gear, content. Variety of those things. New spells, new mechanics, tons of stuff for edge or pvp world style pking. Where you can bank and fight someone 1v1 fairly.  If you make that fun with variety and tons of possible account builds, people will come to pvp and the wilderness will start to become more alive. Once thats done, thats when you update it!

So, who?

Both yes and no.  The disconnect exists because yeah, you do need disposable income to learn, but thats because you‚Äôre going to die. When jagex put in the emergency temporary death mechanics, they did so without actually making the death system healthy for the game. While yes it was needed the severs getting knocked off was awful, they forgot to revert it, or put in something that makes deaths more than a minor inconvenience. 
---
Learning pvp isnt any different than learning zulrah, a new boss, or doing a hard quest.  You‚Äôre going to die in either of them and should expect that. The issue is that pvm doesnt have a punishment for dying, which has lead people to stray away from pvp, because it still does have a punishment. 
---
But, stopping updates from happening because you have the perception that other players(pkers) are better and will just kill me is counter productive. You might not want to do pvp now, but if it gets love an attention theres a good chance you could. And then you would be the one killing people with the vls and having tons of fun! I dont think its worth voting no because it doesnt interest you right now. Osrs pvp has huge potential, so lets build on it and you might just find you love that aspect of the game.

Not when you have a squad of people looking for you
---
Wouldn't you still have to do the lower slayer tasks to get it high enough for better ones?
---
While I don't do everything at maximum efficiency, I imagine part of it is that we've all grown up and many (not all, obviously) of us have jobs and only have a limited amount of time to play. I work 40+ hours a week so I try to be somewhat efficient with my play time so I can actually make some decent progress.
---
I can't speak for everyone though. Thats just me.
---
Someones upset lol
---
support as long as none of the NPCs spawn like it's moparscape
---
i care, keep posting them guys üíô
---
Literally been having crazy lag lately this morning.
---
Prayer flicking and 3 ticking for example are both not intentional, however Jagex has actually come out and said they wont change them because they've become a part of the game. When it comes to the things Rendi does, yes fewer people do them than pray flicking and 3 ticking, but its still a part of the game and has been that way for many years. If Jagex cared about these glitches then they'd already be patched and or Rendi already banned, neither of which have happened. Besides his methods are far more complicated and difficult than actually getting high stats and doing content normally, so I say more power to him.

Is there a difference between trimmed and untrimmed other than looks?

Peoples post. Let people enjoy themselves. Mr party pooper. Lolll
---
I used it and it was fine, but suppliment it with the wiki if you need.
---
My accounts aint locked
---
No shit there's pvm and PvP gear. Like I said it's risk vs reward.
---
Might go ahead and try it out then, hard to trust these other guides
---
the one from the movie
---
Game doesn't use much data though
---
They get posted everyday and no one actually cares but the people posting them.
---
But 59 is max 83cmb
---
&gt;  boaty has a net worth or 1.2 million
---
It's amazing how streaming a nostalgia simulator can bring in this much money nowadays.
---
This is actually already in game. Such as how the toxic blowpipes speed is reduced against players.
---
But, specifically the new pvp weapons that are to be polled only have stats when used to attack another player. Making them only useful for pvp. They also cost a signifigant ammount to use, theyre a MASSIVE gold sink, so even if you could use them for pvm, it would not be smart or profitable to do so as you only get about 1 hour of use out of the weapon.
---
That's how they get you. It's unlimited but you're going to hate every minute of it.
---
Well then try logging in? If that's not it I just don't know what to tell you. You're fucked mate
---
I just pm them a quick "Hey who the fuck are u again"
---
Mage arena 2?
---
And the risk is lower for the pker.
---
if they get upvoted people care, if they don't people don't
---
tfw you realize you stopped making new friends to replace the ones who were quitting
---
Yeah and 1-2sec DC's are super common for us younger folks with peasant internet. I don't think I ever DC'd at my parents house after that dosing craze in 2015
---
If he‚Äôs not online wtf would that help, lol..
---
I don't understand why u would do 18k kills without using chins and using acb with buckler. Unless you are some moron zulrah staker that loses their bank every unique they get, you should have definitely been able to afford a max setup with chins, tbow and ely.
---
The really nice thing about it is that it is an increase without adding to your risk
---
If you're like me, you don't want to spend hours learning hard PvM bosses that are only hard because of a lower range level. I'd rather AFK train range at like NMZ or something while at work and doing IRL things, that way I'm able to enjoy PvM more cause higher range level.
---
As i said, let people enjoy themselves. Nobody likes a party pooper
---
You must be in college. Those laptops are are the cooking skill cape of universities.

I would guess that this is the result of 55-65 runs, so between 4:40-6:00 hours.
---
But I farded and shidded and cameded is grammar?
---
Agreed
---
This is why I love Rendi, finding obscure mechanics in RuneScape that barely anyone thinks about and executing them perfectly for *hours* to complete ridiculous challenges. Especially with the team coordination here. This vid and the Tarn vid are definitely my favourites.
---
You chad! Nice work
---
Yeah and I also do at my gf's house, but that has nothing to do with jagex, just shit internet.
---
True... just the cost is so high, i‚Äôd have to grind vork for 25hours
---
Do level 48 players when have good gear to pk?
---
I'm 61 agility with 35 MAG in the bank and no actual graceful items. I want to get to 70 quickly. Should I do the Seer's rooftop until I have full graceful and then do Werewolf or should I just go straight to Werewolf?
---
Thanks for the help anyway
---
What I do is I leave blue d‚Äôhide on the ground. It won‚Äôt disappear for 30 minutes (unless you leave). Then if I have say, 2 sharks and no invent space left, I drop the sharks and pick up as much d‚Äôhide as I can
---
Right o. Just get rid of everything

Caralho

Just go members right away, you have sooooo many more money makers. Worst case you‚Äôre paying for a few months out of pocket but if you stay persistent you can build your account to be self sufficient.
---
Hey, I feel you. This is pretty similar to another response I've had before, so I'm going to copy and paste. It's not exact, but I think it is analogous enough :) 
---
&gt; There is {something that you can do}. Write to your representatives and say that wolves are an important part of the natural ecosystem.
---
&gt; If you are an American citizen, which I'm assuming you are due to this post, then you have one job. Make your voice heard, do your research, and be a constituent *and make your voice heard.* Inform your friends and ask they do the same. Host a letter writing party to your senator. 
---
&gt; Do anything but read this article and wish.
---
_______ 
---
The person responded with a somewhat defeatist / loss of hope view on the world. How can one person be effective in a state where his congressmen and senators run unopposed. And I feel for that. And the only way to do it is to come together. 
---
&gt; So talk to your friends. Talk to your children's parents, visit elderly homes and get these people to vote with you. Inspire someone to run and vote out that piece of shit unopposed runner. 
---
&gt; Hell, run yourself. 
---
&gt; Honestly, the only way to do something *is to start doing something.*. I live in California. There's literally nothing I can do directly because my state is already working on it. Like, literally. 
---
&gt; That doesn't stop me. I write letters to other state representatives, I encourage people outside of my own state to vote and to encourage their friends and family to get informed. Yes, as an one there is only so much I can do. But if I can talk to 50 people, and they all begin to agree and talk to 50 other people, suddenly we have 1,000 people who are pissed off and now either forcing your representatives to support their constituents, or get voted out. 
---
&gt; Fight the corporations lobbying by supporting local family businesses. Fight gerrymandering by learning about your districts - they purposely make it more difficult to campaign so you are forced to do more research, so that you are more likely to waste your time promoting prop 2A in this city because this city isn't voting for prop 2A. 
---
&gt; It's hard. It's frustrating. It's outright enraging. But the only way to start making change is to start taking initiative. 
---
&gt; It's really easy to hope, and it's really easy to be defeatist. While the former is at least well intentioned, they are ultimately both harmful and useless. If everyone hopes someone else takes out the trash, that trash will never be taken out.
---
I apologize for copy and pasting myself but I still feel that it all holds true for how we should be looking at these situations. We as individuals, consumers, voters, have *have* ***have*** to come together and stand together beyond being individuals. Your neighbors and your community *do* hold power, despite any state or federal policies that attempt to dissuade us from utilizing it. 
---
And unfortunately, sitting back and playing RuneScape while feeling helpless is exactly what they want everyone to do. Imagine all the money that's to be made by happy people not needing to do anything. Multitask. Play RuneScape as you're folding letters you and friends wrote to your representatives and putting them into envelopes. Most of us are afking anyway. 
---
But don't AFK your duty as an American citizen. 
---
Stay strong (and may your skilling xp raise quickly)

I'm replying from my inbox so being lazy, I don't think my comments pertained to whatever op posted about BA. But gambling is a dumb situation because jamflex is making a rule regarding gambling and has blatant gambling in their game. Probably why they have gone a year or so without word of it.

And i think its amazing. Cause he started this with no intention of buying rune cbow like that. Its just that the people who are invested in him wanted to help scout n to make it more fun they put a bounty on imps.

Its not against ironman mode if you gather up people and build a comunity in game around a goal. It brings people together and creates sense of adventure.

This is the end of my opinion on this particular topic. Thank you for reading. Further disscusion is very much welcomed.

Rich people bad. Rich give me money because rich should share.

Probably something like that.

He got the rcb?
---
I can't speak for efficiency, but divine pots should be better since defence doesn't really help at vork. I leave the hides like deathcab said, and pick them up at my discretion, usually the end of the trip.
---
you should post a screenshot of current setup for questions like these, also, how many kills are you currently getting per trip?
---
It's not just you, it's literally the slowest kill by a pretty large margin too.
---
Awful amount of helmies in that chat.

Should be 420 Nature runes

Not really.

You're right.

Your good dude don‚Äôt worry about fuckin losers like that guy. He probably had a bad day and came home to hit his wife but realized he‚Äôs a dweeb and can‚Äôt get a woman so he gets on Reddit and comments rude and unhelpful things under people‚Äôs questions.

If your email is hacked. Your accounts are gone. No questions.

Risky click of the day

Do you ever actually need the second antivenom? You should only use it once you get venomed, there's no reason to pre-drink it. As others have said, don't pick up the unnoted hides and do 5-6 kill trips.

should've screamed "FUCKING SLAYERRRR" after you chugged the beer aswell! fking gratzz tho mate :D !

Wow dude, Jesus.

This guy purposely disconnected his Internet on all his previous Hardcores because he was running out of content and wanted to repeat the entire process again to keep his channel alive.

You‚Äôve killed 247 of them so it‚Äôs a little misleading but still super lucky. When bursting they die in groups and runelite can‚Äôt track the extra deaths but the bones in the drop log show an accurate estimate.

I wasn't sure if this was strictly talking about minigame rewards. I'm more for it then, and for the record I will be voting yes to pvp updates if the consensus among pvpers is that they want it. I don't pvp at all, but I still want pvping to be huge. Also in games like this there is always teaming and other ways to exploit it with alts etc.

most skills in runescape is mindless clicking vs adapt and react and making choices in the other genre

Oh cool I had never heard of asterix before.

Its only 1 in 100 i think

Gratz tho

Seriously, this place is for negativity only. I hate when I see positive shit about this game, it's just distracting us from the fact that we are needed to make this game great and we are literally the saviors of this game. Without us osrs would be even shittier than the shit it is now. Everyone should be thanking us and sending us flowers daily to thank us for our hard work. Luckily we're not as shit as every other game which is also shit b/c there community and company.
---
where are his prims and torture
---
Well that's a fucking stupid take
---
What did you expect?
---
Nice to hear that &lt;3 Many people think these strategies make the minigame more interesting and fun, especially when speedrunning :)
---
*When you hear there's a drop party in Varrock.*
---
Not really useless since there's items that are really good in BC from vanilla and items that are useful in PvP.
---
My main gripe with the whole continue with the next expansion deal is that there's nothing really new going on. People will know the content in and out so it's hardly a challenge.
---
If they'd make raids that are vanilla exlusive no one would know the mechanics and the damage of the bosses. They'd also be able to create harder content to push the hardcore community far more easily.

Nope. Even on task salve ei is better

---
With blessed dhide slayer helm+anguish is probably better dps than the salve + arma helm.
---
rng plays a heavy part in the entire fucking game, but the best pkers are never going to die to random noobs
---
So then the alternative is to Kill pvp so that those supplies never leave the game. 
---
You do realize most people don't pk to make money. They do it because it is fun. Sure, its nice getting big PK's or making cash from it, but thats a benifit, not the goal. 
---
Why is it that PvP cannot be a 'net injection' of items into the game when that's what LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE IN RUNESCAPE IS.  PvM is literally fucking item printers, you kill stuff and rake in items, and this is seen as good. But if its from pvp, bad?  I don't get it.
---
Some are bots but some are people preparing for wintertodt (like me)

"only gotta cook 434,431 raw shrimp to 99 cooking assuming I dont burn a single one.. let's get started."

I believe salve + void is more dps than anguish + slay helm. Which is unfortunate, and why i dont do vorkath on task.
---
Rendi doesn‚Äôt like grinding so most of his ideas don‚Äôt require grinds (although some of the other OSRS youtubers could probably put out a lot more videos if they played more than one client at a time)

players don't get locked out of rewards. You can buy those 'rewards' on the grand exchange and use them, just like you can buy bandos tassets, or a dark bow.  
---
Why would you not want the more skilled players getting rewarded. They're better. You cant give every mediocre player a participation trophey because they'll be sad if they arent good enough to get the rewards of being good.
---
None. OSRS players are scared of change.
---
Can see the dollar signs in his eyes.
---
This guy doesn't have void...
---
I really hope they fix that sometime.
---
you should swap to elite void at exactly 87 range.
---
for some reason, when you level from 86-87 range with the gear i linked, your max hit increases by 2, from 28-30. from then onwards, elite void is superior.
---
feel free to check with your own specific setup, though i doubt much will change.

Happened to me my first "kill." Killed jad, thought it was over, let myself die to healers since I thought it didnt matter lol. Literally could of easily brewed and lived..but I didnt. Also I was literally miliseconds away from it ending and sending me out - since i was already a bit after jad died and his animation was over even. So it was so fucking close. 
---
Did it next try though lols. So gl!
---
Gz man! Can see you was at maples behind seers bank. Nice
---
Didn‚Äôt say that I didn‚Äôt want the more skilled players to be rewarded. Problem is that in PvP ‚Äúskill‚Äù is relative, since as I‚Äôve said several times, there is no set difficulty because it depends on who you‚Äôre fighting. Seriously just read what I said and save us the time next time
---
Salve (ei) is a lot better against undead compared to anguish. Against regular monsters I‚Äôd rather have anguish
---
It‚Äôs definitely more engaging than typical OSRS gameplay but since you don‚Äôt get any xp from it it feels pretty pointless past the basic rewards

You most likely can‚Äôt sustain a bond yet if you‚Äôre just starting out. If I were you I would buy the few first months with real money and once you unlock bosses and get to higher slayer levels (70+) it will be a lot easier to get bonds. 
---
Otherwise you‚Äôre going to burn yourself out trying to get 4m every two weeks.
---
The addition of name-changes (especially multiple changes per month) as a feature has basically nuked my ability to know who tf is who.

No, Vannaka assigns them in osrs, but you have to talk to him on tutorial island
---
but is it better than anguish and a slayer helm
---
&gt;I haven't had any connection problems ever

Ok buddy

Idk what troll is downvoting all the real info, but the classic Dev team has said nothing about stopping at naxx and in a recent stream said they were open to the re release of TBC or classic "plus".

The content is coming out in phases. In the first phase there is only onyxia and ragnaros and no pvp ranking. Raids and other content get released every 3-4 months.

Brother you're comparing either people who've played for 6 years since OSRS got released, or VS other streamers maybe who again, make a living off it.

SN plays what 8-10 hours a day? If not more? You can get a fucking LOT done if you play efficiently 65+ hrs a week.

Can we just make a separate sub for sub-post-worthy accomplishments people insist on posting?

I mean it's about 4 times slower than basic kill attempts with blowpipe for mains at high ranged.
---

Maybe slow the fuck down.
