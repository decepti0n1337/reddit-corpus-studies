Tbh I don't think PvM line of sight is a problem. It's been a long established thing on how safespotting works. And all this did was make existing safespots for certain mobs not work, while creating several more safespots..
---
---
---
Looks like your memberships didnt run out
---
Probably possible trio/dolo
---
So why don't you understand why pvmers complain about getting pked? You yourself admit that getting harassed in the wilderness is annoying.
---
the footprints are suppose to be blood btw.
---
That was my first thought too.
---
No. He should be banned.
---
gz see u in lumby noob
---
You only start in lumbridge if you were not in a free area and your membership runs out, if you have mems, you have to move to a free area first
---
as long as it’s step it’s fine :)
---
I see you Nixue. Better take this pic down now
---
I’d say you were on a new acc and then switched to this one, causing RL to think you gained all that xp since the last time you logged in
---
Because Ironman gameplay is vastly different than normal gameplay and everyone has a unique way of doing it, a lot of Ironmen think it’s funny how much of a pain in the ass it is to do some things and maybe they just want to share it with someone else because they think you might think it’s funny as well, instead you come and complain about them on reddit.
---
How in the actual fuck does one kill 89 Zammy boss in a trip???
---
Maxed skillers who notice a lot of competition probably. Not big effort to go from level 3 maxed skiller to level 30 maxed skiller for pking.
---
Just take the time to go through all the available settings one by one. I'm sure you'll find lots of nice things
---
Ur comment is confusing. 
---

---
Before they didnt work when tbed. Then they didnt work in wildy. Now they dont work in combat. So functionally the same thing as pre nerf when at black chins
---
Yes but a twisted bow will cut your fight cave run by like 15 minutes.  It's absolutely worth getting first.
---
Thought I was lucky 360kc with prims pegs pet and jar
---
I wonder if that's roughly accurate across all levels though, or if it's like just 99 or something
---
I don’t think a maxed skiller is going to want to change their account build to a level 30 mage though, it’s like getting defence levels on your pure
---
I was actually thinking about think when I was at Wintertodt getting 99 Fm on my new Iron the other day but then I got lost in thought and decided I’ll probably do some agility pyramid for some starter cash and agility lvls before I hit the questing grind and maybe Thieving for some extra gp because I’ll need it for Construction especially if I’m going to cut and make my own planks
---
[removed]
---
I think it's roughly accurate throughout all levels. The formula was the same mostly for black chins but I don't remember what the number was. Maybe 325? But I can't say for sure about black chins.
---
BiS for many bosses and DPS, rare to get too.
---
Out of all 3 SotE was the most annoying for me, I died a few times and running back and forth around Lletya and navigating the UP was annoying af
---
Yesterday I got 2 pairs of climbing boots (g) and 1 wizard boots. In one day... still dry on rangers but 3 boots in under 100 kc.
---
Well I'm only 80 atm and unfortunately a decent amount away from mm2 or I would definitely test it out
---
Rookies, I hop worlds hoping my first hop has a fixed wheel
---
Goddamn that made me have a giggle
---
Yeah it’s good but I usually just throw some rune thrownaxes and hit em all
---
Sounds like you suspect someone.
---
I think they removed last ip logged in but it used to appear at the top of the "lobby" where it now says hours/days since last online.
---
Not sure, but you can't quick hop to them. You have to go back to the log in screen and use world selector. Big blue stars.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
You can only sell barrows when they’re completely repaired (item’s name without the stat number after it) or completely broken, one hit on it and it turns into status 100, 100 or any other number is considered an untradeable and will not be lost on death in game (it doesnt even break) you will be respawned in your city’s (lumby, faly, Edgeville,etc) wearing the borrow equipment (untradeables remain worn after death) however, im not sure long ago if dying causes it to break completely or not, but now its different and speaking from experience 😂, however dropping them on the ground i believe breaks them completely!, as for the fight caves, die or not, your gear will not break, but yes it does degrade.. borrows equipment completely breaks to 0 after 15 hours of constant combat
---
Thank you
---
That’s why i loved Ninjahs iron series. he didn’t overhype anything, progress was insanely quick, and he was genuine with it all. too bad he doesn’t make videos or play at all anymore
---
Hey man don’t worry about it. It’s a very simple fight after you do it the first time. you got 4.8 seconds between each attack he does. That’s a lot of time to switch prayer, and enough time to think about your next move. As long as you don’t feel overwhelmed and go in there with a clear head you got it.
---
Oh boy, I used to have a family in this house and we had regular weddings in Falador park
---
Yeah you guessed it, darn shame. Thanks anyways :/
---
i know ur joking but maxing on wow is like 100 hours vs 3/4k
---
Hate those. Frustrating to see like a low combat level account, but can only hit 0s
---
What an interesting post! I hope a J-Mod responds.
---
No need to prove anything, but can always send screenshots if needed. I've did visage grind twice on hc which takes like 300 hours on average with a 1/10000 droprate so dwh was nothing special. Especially not since it took me like 1k kills and only 12 hours.
---
How far away on the spectrum are you bro
---
You do what you wanna do, that simple.
---
Me and my friends used this house. We cooked a bunch of food and place it on the downstairs table for dinner. Shit felt cosy af.
---
Kudos man, I’ve been gridding the game for years and recently picked it back up. Highest I got an account was level 75 but I’m hoping to get that 126 I’ve always dreamed of 🤞
---
As someone with 800kc and no prim and no pet this image hurts....
---
Oh hai
---
Haha nope, because I was referring to this specific barrows as I assume it in particular was the inspiration for the osrs barrows based on its proximity to Jagex HQ, as well as the many similarities in design. But regardless, it's still worth pointing out and I personally didn't know that so thank you!
---
24 here
---
Go for it, I plan on maxing this account. Hopefully I can stay into the game long enough to get to that point.
---
I used to use the crystal bow on the vents and it was alright. you8 miss out on the slayer helm bonus with the armour though
---
Wanna do mine.
---
That indeed, is a graph
---
I choose.. 1- Hellhound (Fight Arena), 2- Me (Lunar Diplomacy), 3- Black Demon (The Grand Tree), 4-Khazard Warlord (Tree Gnome Stronghold), 5-Spirit Tree (Lost City), 6- Count Draynor (Vampire Slayer)
---
Sohpanem != Sophanem?
---
are you really prepared to hand over your login info to some random dude on the internet? i hope you're not serious
---
If anyone sees this THIS is the correct answer. The answer RL gives is incorrect. Her name is "Mawrth" just south of the tele spot.
---
what’s the point of the timer lol
---
u got juiced bro
---
No, everyone is saying you will go back to lumbridge if your membership runs out in a members area. OP is still a member and can't log in because his character is in a members area.
---
I really did. There's a special place in hell for people who hijack runescape accounts.
---
You grinded?
---
These are my actual tabs though lol so maybe a mild flex though 😉
---
Mage only or how did you do it :)?
---
Haha yea I saw a couple people doing the same thing in that same house. Had one guy get really mad at me for not "getting out of his house" lol.
---
Oh god damnit. Well that sure explains that. I had commented at work before getting home to read the update.
---
Practice safe commenting kids

I do it once per week and it’s 3-400k to fill coffers 
---
the teaks are the fastest way to get favour and if you do each Sunday you only lose 4% 
---
There’s a calculator on the wiki 
---
that tells you what is most profitable and unless you’re and iron you can just sell 1m in coal and buy way more logs then you get from chopping
---
Why Konar over Duracell?
---
Sitting here at 80 RC and did not know that either.  Woulda been great on my mobile grind too. Fuck me, lol.
---
Definitely want to get the follow up quest.  You get significantly increased efficiency and the favor drains at 1% a day.  If you're not an ironman, you actually lose value instead of gaining if you don't have the follow up quest
---
Vorkath Setup, Hydra Setup, Clue Setup, Birdhouse Run Setup, Wintertodt Setup, Fashionscape/Skilling Setup, Wildy Bossing Setup, Corp Setup

What herbs would you recommend at lvl 86?
---
Don’t make cannon balls make Mith bars and buy cannon balls they’re terribly slow
---
No bank pin?
---
i did the follow up. that was royal troubles
---
By this i meant my comment
---
It's a little late now but maybe for the future, I ways bank everything before I log out. That way I also have my pin protecting me.
---
Ya mate games boring af and yet the best game ever made??
---
The right is me after playing osrs for 7 hours straight
---
&gt; you're acting like there's any reason to use addy arrows when they're essentially the same price as rune arrows. Only f2p use addy arrows.
---
Just for the record rune arrows are MUCH more expensive than addy arrows for iron.
---
Nice rc lvl
---
In my experience, it comes in bunches. Be 200 dry, then 3 in 10
---
What staff is the guy in Rune holding? Also I can’t find that one on your Etsy
---
Wow you completed ds2 on mobile impressive
---
You're missing the entire point. If you're going to range during your task and you don't need heals then the MSB(i) is a great substitute for the BP and costs wayyyyyy less than BP.
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
I started the quest then got worried about not having the message!
---
Haha little do you know I don’t even have 40 defense so I can’t even equip a rune full helm
---
Yes. They're still slow.. I've been cutting yews and I'm at 89
---
Best one so far
---
I have a bank pin set up. So they didnt clean me out, just force me to liquidate most of my bank. I had enough in my bank to buy back everything but my fury.
---
Are you me?!
---
Rewards an upgraded keyring that actually holds all keys!
---
I agree with mining, but hunter isn’t bad at all. You can get pretty high xp/hr while making a not insignificant amount of money. Imo rc and mining are by far the worst 2 skills.
---
Varlamore would like a word
---
The only people it annoyed where those going super afk, going with a foot peddle or just straight botting/ autoclicking. 
---
If you don’t like the bags, go do black jacking, go do pp

Staff of light from rs3

you could have 60 range 20 hp at level 34. would always one shot a level 3.

Idk man. Nothing you said seemed to be correct.

---
is that a runelite plugin?
---
That whole slayer dungeon doesn’t fit thematically. Honestly I wish they had been crystal variants, creatures fitting to the dungeon region, or not put in at all.
---
Think about how thematically fitting lumbridge cave is, then we have places like stronghold slayer cave and Kourend, where some loose lore has placed a random smattering of creatures in a cave, not really a fan
---
Do you plan on pking and not really earning much money to participate in a slowly getting quieter pvp scene?
---
If yes then a pure if your you and you basically need to follow a guide to not fuck it up.
---
Acts as Sara and zammy item.
---
someone tried to scam me by selling a house. he legit took me to some random house in varrock and said "this can be yours for 250k"
---
When sire came out it didnt have a 100%stun chance. I went dry 360 kills for my first unsired and it was a head...
---
No idea how I survived those 360kills. And no idea how my monitor survived that head.
---
Not really, but I also thought pures were cool and more challenging.  I've only really played on 1 account (I've made a few others here and there but they were all def/ range pures) and I always favored defense so I thought I might be fun to somewhat heavily favor attack/ strength.
---
Beautiful
---
Thx Colton 😎
---
Its a swampletics pin i msde for him.  its on his shop "Settled.Store"
---
Ive done both if those and they sold out already
---
If your wanting something still with defence BUT a challenge, look at making a zerker, still limited quests you can do but also FAR more content you can complete.
---
The spot I use is next to 2 spawn points
---
Herbs have a ~15% chance of death on supercompost and an ~6% chance of death on ultracompost. This gives about an 11% increase in yield.
---
Ultracompost also increases the average harvest (assuming the plant lives) by 20%.
---
On herbs like ranarr where high seed costs eat up a lot of the base costs, these extra gains are critical to ensuring you exceed the base cost to make profits.

Add something to tbow so it uses charges.

Nerf blowpipe.

Staminas in cox with buchus.
---
Raids 3 in desert but not within a year. It doesnt feel like time for another big unlock.
---
If you do a pure you want to make sure the quests you do don’t give defense. A few quests you may want to do are horror from deep, regicide, monkey madness, lost city etc. there should be pure guides depending on what one you are wanting to make
---
You guys rock.

So this is another one of jagex's anti botting ideas? I didn't know this. If someone has the mental capacity to make a program that can click endlessly on a npc or run runes or.. Hell even boss. How in the actual fuck is this a relevant deterrent for botters? I love this game believe me I've been playing it since I was a wee little lad. Countless hours logged behind a potato of a pc. Made a lot of good memories hanging out with the boys on the weekend after school and in the end jagex bent us all over and fucked us with a broomstick. They ruined the game I used to love. Now don't get me wrong you'll never understand the amount of excitement I had when I heard they brought it back (which was when mobile came out) but since then. I have made a great account, achieved a goal I set out for on the first day I started playing and got the boys back on and playing. I know I veered a little off topic but adding something like this to this game this late in the age of technology is pointless. I don't know anything about programming or code but these botters are smart enough to make that bot scroll over to that coin pouch and simpl end it... And go back to it's worthless bot grind. Anyway happy adventuring!

Blowpipe more consistently gets 3 vents down in first phase.

Idk you sound like the psycho man

I love you

This hit too close to home, bruh

2103 total still not reached base 80s haha, well done pal. Headed for max you think?

Me: *Brings main*

Him: Go outside, nerd LOL
---
No I logged out wherever I was because I’m homeless
---
OJs or bust my dude
---
I had to go into the OSRS settings and select "Allow to use data in the background" or something along those lines. Otherwise it logs out when I swap.
---
No clue, never done revs. From videos everyone seems to just use blowpipes
---
I didn’t come here to be attacked buddy. I plan on posting my first fire cape when I get it next week (112 cmb)

please, i just want Stealing Creation back

gratz man hopefully you got wildy hards done also sick account that's what I'm working on atm
---
When I wanna get naked in the lake and find a sweet mermaid I yell out loud, “Time for a Lucky Dip!”
---
Honestly I moved recently and only just got a computer again, mobile (at least on iPad) is really not bad! The only really lame bits are slayer (so easy to miss drops and so annoying to burst) and construction which is absolutely awful, I don’t think I could do it on mobile.
---
Someone needs to go redo the security fortress thing, there is a question about this very thing
---
Sure bro pm rsn
---
I’ve heard it before in Northern Virginia. Makes sense, you’re left a wrinkled dried out piece of useless fruit.
---
My next idea is a farming expansion with fungi and other crops that grow in lack of light.  However we've just gotten the farming guild and farming in general is quite fleshed out so im not sure how well received that would be.
---
Lucky Dip,
---
Verb,
---
The act of dipping a toe into the pool to test out the water, and the temperature is JUST right.
---
I say it to keep their spirits up. The grind can be a gruesome path, and any encouragement helps.
---
😂😂 you’re probably right I was shaking so much
---
At least rag and boneman 2 isn't a requirement for any other quests.
---
 Yo that's lit fam! Gz
---
I imagine if you wear this into battle everyone and their dog would be after you lol.
---
Kind of like how in the first world war we lost so many officers, because they were all dressed like targets
---
It wasn't for bots, it was to stop people spam clicking to 99. If you were around at the time it was a massive epidemic, and was addressed as an integrity concern to the thieving skill. Massive amounts of players who would never dream of botting were clicking to 99 while they did literally anything else but look at the screen
---
Do those all give defense exp?
---
My torso took me under and hour and a half with randoms, where are you making 20m/hr consistently?
---
he said he wont make a mobile app.
---
i was told wintertodt was awful so i went and tried it and proved them all wrong XD
---
Appreciate it.
---
my town &lt;3\_&lt;3
---
H
---
You absolutely know i was referring to you saying 100m since 400m was too unlikely according to you. Even of his bank was 400m its not worth the time it would take to get his account unless he really slipped up. Creation date matters but if you cant list one password youre not getting the account unless you hack an email, which you still dont have.
---
Hellllll yeah brother💦👌💪
---
I doubt u have to cut treea for 500 hours in wow lol
---
Fuckin drunk
---
I don't know what this means lol.
---
Is that a rs3 thing?
---
I’m done arguing with you. You’re an idiot dude.
---
A man of faith, this one is not
---
This is jousting/tournament armour.
---
It just waits untill you pick 12 images. 
---
Doesn't care what you pick.
---
I like the spitfire hat. Woo
---
gz its pretty easy after the first few kills on any account
---
Chaos dwarf theme raid would be sick.
---
Same thing happens on official servers too if a game gets shut down
---
You lost me at 25 blow pipes
---
Mat K for a story stream 🤩
---
Can do waterfall for 30/30 and 41 mage would still be magic-based. Then 40 ranged with cannon + 10 hp + 1 def/pray + 20 slayer gets you to 173 total. 
---
Leftover 1372/15 is level 88 in most stats. Still tough but more doable
---
*menophause
---
Idk if you wanna check out my post history, but it may just piss you off. 1kc and saw a tbow.
---
U got mutegeon no pity from me
---
\+1
---
Thank you. I think we have all of this except the 90 herblore. Can we get away with 78 or would having 90 make it insanely easier?
---
Yup some guys tried getting me like that. They were dumb and I watched them appear with the crew and take off items. I just ate all my supplies in order to rag the 5 of them. They wasted so many barrages. They even attacked their own crewmembers by accident haha.
---
Was memeing. Someone needs to watch some 25_buttholes (YouTube).
---
Drop all hot and cold steps and the one the guy requires you to make shit
---
Its possible there are some stalagmite formations where you can lure them. An alt to spread bones is super helpfull doe.
---
Why did you not use ghorrack tele tab instead of burning amulet. I have yet to see pkers when i tele up there.
---
Your videos get better with every entry. Keep up the great work dude
---
Thanks, though I think it might be a bit difficult to get Dext + lance both. Might need to hold off on Dext if we get lances.
---
Did not know about them until these past few posts, thanks!
---
Back when RS2 was becoming RS3, people legitimately convinced themselves that the items they had in the beta worlds mattered.

Hey buddy

Who?

New std top pp play Pogarian Champion

30+ years old and 0 accomplishments/ambitions id guess
---
I would vote yes.
---
I wasn't mad about losing the fury since 2m is easy to make back, but good God I despise doing BA that hurt me more than anything lmao
---
0 to sawmill very f ing funny
---
Wow how do you get that many kills? I get 3 maybe 4 if lucky
---
Putting yourself in the place of the main character sort of falls down in a lot of ways in RS though. It's so repetitive. If you consider a skill like firemaking... Does it really take lighting 10,000 fires (or whatever it is) to master that skill? Nah fam.
---
He's in a quest. One of the Morytania ones, but I can't remember.
---
Dex &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lance

Yo is this j1mmys reddit or is someone finessing karma from.him
---
Varrock until you’re using a rune pick axe then it’s worth it to go to Al Khalid for the sweet sweet iron triangulation.
---
Its actually very safe to do.
---
I cant post sites on here. For obvious reasons. But google some and just try the first one you see!
---
Woke up in the game. Cause life sucks and the games better.. sadly woke up from my dream in my dream of ya get me.
---
I got a shoulder parrot a couple days ago. 260k.. beginner scrolls are worth doing.
---
Buy bonds, support the game legit. Also guarentee you wont get scammed or banned
---
Nice profile
---
https://youtu.be/141EqRxI97E
---
Ah, thank you very much
---
No, you get paid 5m for all OTHER lucky implings you find, not also.  Meaning you won't get 35m for god boots implings ect.
---
But he doesn't think it's used by Americans and there is a huge group of Anglos in America.
---
You’ll hit 99 in firemaking now
---
Not being a btw helps.
---
Wrong. You get paid 35m if you find god boots
---
Are you doing what you love? Fuck yeah.  
---
Are you not? Start.
---
He didn't solo.
---
I ended up not bringing it and was fine. Brought too many brews too.
---
He said trio in the comments.
---
Ja! ‘‘Tis so!
---
Well for starters there are only cauldrons, wood fires, and ranges, no other cooking equipment.
---
Giving your cat to some sketchy person for death runes.
---
Ive seen a clip around here of 30 herbs.
---
My pb is 15 torstols
---
That subtext was all there based in his first comment where he told OP what to do and said (ironically considering he took the time to comment) that “nobody cares.”
---
Practice the prayer switches by watching a video of Jad on one side of the screen and the client on the other, then click the appropriate prayers for switching. It's just getting it into muscle memory
---
Before this happened did you get logged out of the game automatically by being afk for 5 minutes? Cus I've had this happen to me twice and both times were after letting the game log me out (doesn't happen every time, just both times it happened it was after an afk log) I have no reason to suspect any suspicious activity so I always assumed it's a bug. First time took 20 mins to log in second time took an hour. Good luck
---
Yeah, I was just trying to add some subtext of my own.
---
I gave up for a bit, smoked some trees, drank some drinks,  then tried again after a while. That time it worked.
---
You calling Spiderman &amp; Uncle Rosco liars?

An interview style monologue, I saw a recording of it once

The period of time elapsed was 3 months

I've been sitting on an account with UIM Incel as the name for like half a year just waiting for the urge to make an *inside/underground* only, *no talking to female NPCs* locked ultimate ironman

Lmao

There’s tons of room for errors. It’s a med level boss. If you actually think there is 0 room for error you’re vastly mistaken.

Haha I'm not talking about all the stash unit items, I've already done those. But thanks.

HAI GUYS!! IM GONNA TALK INCAPS COS ITS SUPER IMPORTANT!!

LOOK IM MAKING A LIMITED ACCOUNT BUT I WANT SOMEOEN TO MAK IT EZIER FOR ME BCOZ I DONT WANT TO HAV 2 WORK HRD FOR MAI ACCOUNT

Honestly me and 1 friend had absolutely no idea how to do raids but wanted to. I trained my herblore and we just went for it. First run our first room was tek ton and he destroyed us. The 2 of us didnt do 1 damage to him in our entire inventory. We learned how to scout and found a good raid. It took us probably 3ish hours in total but we finished it. I'd say just go for it and have fun!
---
literally the oldest trick in the book
---
Nah, I could show u the account I’ve talked about. Don’t think I’ve ever even shown the username on the reddit before. Would just like real help instead of this stuff tbh.
---
Out of f2p
---
Otherwise ogresses.
---
Thank you!
---
Its not 99 but its honest work
---
? just need a blocker bro
---
Oh really? I'll check it out
---
If its ypur account then you should be fine.
---
Ok thank you. I’m just worried as I’ve gotten extremely lucky at raids lately and don’t wanna risk my account.
---
I got 420 wc

This is the quality content I come here for let's see some more noods.
---
Osrs needs soul wars no one's doing lms, hardly castle wars. And clan wars . I missed that spike shield what a shame
---
Same but once I got a higher level I found its easier to make gold in game and just a waste of cash irl
---
&gt;Those type of people deserve to be hacked though.
---
Ah yes, because double xp weekends is something that has literally never happened before in the last 2 decades.
---
Sometimes you just need Rick for the wooden furniture only POH aesthetic
---
Whilst I do 100% agree with the fact it's a waste of time to collect the hammer's. I have a funny feeling he doesn't care about time since he is doing mlm instead of vm or granite
---
Yeah I did that, not ideal but certainly better than nothing
---
That's me bank in one trip
---
A faster and more interactive way to make cannonballs perhaps? At least it makes more sense to have that as a reward from the dwarf questline instead of some PoH furnace they've mentioned.
---
We can complete Druidic Ritual without any problems. We can simply buy the meats on the Grand Exchange. I'm not sure what Priest in peril has to do with Druidic Ritual, but we can't complete Priest in peril because it rewards prayer exp.

Would love some Dwarf Fortress inspired big bad to fight and maybe a one small favor type deal for stopping a tantrum spiral.

I think its a 3 player team
---
Would have to disagree, I’ll never make 40m/hr
---
There is an untrimmed slayer UIM that is the alt of a pmod UIM who has multiple 200ms, and it's username is "a u_i_m"
---
Except this is English and not Egyptian hieroglyphs
---
This reminded me years ago when my brother and I shared an account, we wanted a 99 cape and settled on WC because it didn't cost money and seemed easy (f2p plebs) I eventually gave up but my brother powered through, so I watched as what felt like months of work to watch him try to buy a skill cape only to find out its p2p.
---
ofc the brainlets who struggle with fight caves take a screenshot with their phone
---
I've sent this suggestion over to Mod Ash -fingers crossed-!
---
The lamps are a nice boost for slayer but I'm also trying to get 100qp.
---
Torches already lit and pitchforks sharpened
---
The Teo cities do have Egyptian inspiration though
---
Lamps and quests yes, but I'm looking to start partner slayer in the future.
---
I guess you could say Jagex squashed their hopes of making a good quest.. by pushing a pillar on it.
---
stands alone btw
---
Only lucky imps drop the rune crossbow

I've flagged to put her missing ponytail back. Looks like she sneakily ran to the hairdressers mid-way through designing and development.

Just use the knife on the web. Not that difficult dickfuck
---
Fun in theory but i think it could be way top hectic 😅
---
Next you'll be telling me Mos'le'Harmless*
---
ISN'T ACTUALLY MOSTLY HARMLESS
---
That was a rabbit hole full of deep psychological issues I did not want to go down.
---
Imagine hitting one rare on a trip to Bandos.
---
Okay, now imagine that the rare actually came from a minion.
---
Imagine, now, that you missed the opportunity of a lifetime to buy a lottery ticket.
---
Right now back to Bandos-
---
Rngesus favors some but not all.
---
and the most creative screenshot method goes to...
---
There are several streams were they talked about old stories for the entire hour, a few including the Gower brothers. Plus theres the documentary.
---
You can still have RuneScape in your heart and not play. I prob log in on my ironman to buy a bond just to do a few cerb, or shamens tasks. That's usually enough to remind me that it's kinda getting to that point again and I don't play for weeks to months again. 
---
It's still fun, just not grind 8 hours a day fun anymore.
---
Defeating the purpose of the game mode is completely subjective. People do BA, CoX, ToB, Corp iron alt spec down, Rev protection, alt slayer, hell even some skilling methods require player interaction or can. The “purpose” of the mode is whatever you want it to be with the restrictions set and abiding by the rules. But tbh at the end of the day who fucking cares. If it’s not against the rules and doesn’t effect you or anyone else I don’t see the issue people have.
---
Hydra is a must, but brimstone keys alone are not. Konar gives some real shit tasks often so you need a decent chunk of points saved to even make her worth it.
---
yes ruin the game for yourself thatll be fun
---
Please excuse my noobishness, but “alt” means alternate account?
---
Well. It’s not trading. I’m donating money for information, but you’re entitled to your opinion and no offense but just being honest I don’t care. It’s not against the rules so there’s no issue in my eyes.
---
bro i swear your character is the biggest chad. those arms
---
No, it's called a screenshot because you take a photo of the screen with a camera, go to a camera store and get the photo developed, then bring the photo home, and faithfully redraw the photo onto some paper, using the original photo as a reference shot. Once the drawing is finished, you mail it to reddit hq, then they scan it, and upload it to reddit. A simple process.
---
Exchanging gold for a service is not a literal trade?
---
I'm not sure the word trade means what you think it means.
---
Trios that don’t involve deaths you should be getting 65k, and 4 mans you should be getting 85k. Just something to strive for
---
Only the mages drop them
---
Unlocked camera, 1 clicking everywhere. This needs to stop.
---
Thanks for advice, but can you elaborate on what you mean by “an alt to spread bones is super helpful”?
---
I’m lost lol. Just came back to OSRS from a few years ago.

I’m assuming life got in the way so those friends don’t play anymore, gratz man
---
&gt;I’m donating money for information
---
Lmao. You mean you're paying for a service.
---
&gt;Well. It’s not trading. 
---
*trade: the action of buying and selling goods and services.*
---
It quite literally is trading. You are literally purchasing a service from another player. The service they provide you is imp location.
---
Return scam is op gp/hr

Ironically I got fire cape on my first attempt, unlocked the task and have failed every single one since then
---
What are you supposed to do remove this sub from your front page, AND quit playing?
---
I have 90 con. I went for mahog tables. I focus on getting ornate pool and good teles asap. Quicker its built, quicker i dont have to do it again. Max your portal nexus and hang some jewelry up. Max your jewelry box too!
---
hailfatguy used meme comment!

whoa calm down, that's crazy talk.

Idk if you’re an iron but mystic legs + ahrims top with occult is better than ahrims top/bottom with a fury

How does he give money to the person? He literally trades.

Wait, i thought you needed 1 kc to be able to get a jad task

54 Runecrafting. Nice.

YES!! Ultimate Splashing Pet for sure. This would pass I poll. I hope

Wow that’s hot

I only wanted the pet but got 5 dragon picks in 595kills. 595th was the pet
---
4-5b an hour. Nice

Shut up you whiny bitch

Nice Death shirt mate.

U take pic of you self, nice

I've just done the same as you but raised my offers by 1gp.

Goodluck.

Its honestly easier and faster to upload to Reddit by taking a screenshot on your PC vs getting phone out then uploading on phone..and you can crop the picture however you want in your default windows media viewer.

No

We only have 10 kc so we have lots of improving

Maybe add the "lava Trim" to the prospector outfit.   
---
This lava trim, if worn in all the 4 pieces, the outfit will provide another 5% bonus on top of the prospector outfit.  
---
This lava trim can be obtained by doing Volcanic mining points.  
---
100.000 points for the helm

150.000 points for the shoes

180.000 points for the legs

---
That's the thing I've noticed as a recently returned player... things just don't have as much value anymore. Maybe it's because I'm older and see through the smoke and mirrors.
---
Seeing someone with the 99 Woodcutting cape, for example, I would've thought was epic when I played this back in 2008. That seemed super out of reach and prestigious.
---
Now I know it's just a matter of investing 200 hours of occasionally clicking on trees while I watch YouTube on my second monitor. Will that really feel like an achievement?
---
Oh well, at least I'm enjoying the nostalgia for now.
---
Also the generic drop table of Alchs and supplies etc.

Thx for acc

Whats the significance of sharing your herblore level? Weird flex

Doing mahogany is not worth it for the amount of time vs gp you save from oak doors. Went from 74-84 in about half a day which just shows how fast it is.

Portal nexus, ornate pool and jewelry box are a godsend

Is it really gambling? You can't spend real money or in game money. You turn a currency that is otherwise useless once you are lvl 5 in every role and have all the useful penance items into useful items that can be sold for money. Sure there is a random factor, but it's more like PvM with extra stept.

Same thing happened to me recently. Except i didnt box the guy and i tanked till tb went off and got away lol. Panicked a bit also, but decided boxing is prolly not worth the risk of getting skull tricked or smth :D

Well, he did reply when that comment was only 6-7 minutes old to be fair.

I’ll kill zulrah after 75 thieving ok? Calm down.

because barbarian fishing is the fastest xp for fishing, even without tick manipulation. but you need 15 strength to start and you gain strength xp so its no good for a level 3 that wants to stay level 3

If that's how that quest line ended at least it fits with the MO of the temple knights, they are meant to be the ones that think their way to victory.

I wish these game updates also had a community highlight section , could have a few screenshots of someone getting a 99, pet or any interesting achievement.

Unless this is solo I have no sympathy

Back then they were much harsher on "offensive language" and "website advertisement" so you could get muted pretty easily.
---
Then the language filter came out and most of that disappeared, but you still get muted if you go too far.

shortbows and kbow would have the same speed, no? Also he could be bringing rune knives from ninja imps for that

Just to recap this part in the movie Aladdin for those of you who don't remember: Aladdin and his monkey go inside the Cave of Wonders (sand casino), Aladdin finds the Genie's lamp while his monkey grabs the red jewel.

&gt;Why are people so eager to steal things from other OSRS players?
---
because RS has one of the biggest black markets and you can cash out all your gp within seconds, that's the main reason people hack other people, monetary gain irl. Back when free trade was removed (2007-2011) people were barely hacked because there was no monetary gain in it for hackers/phishers.

If he likea farming so much, then why is he fishing??

Time spent grinding on Swampletics &gt; time editing a random video just to put one out

He knows people want to see Swampletics content and it gets him views, he might as well just not spread his time out across two accounts plus extra editing.
---
Bonds are just an item you can buy that can be renewed for 14 days (i think) of membership. So youll want to buy a bond or two then trade it to your friend
---
Yeah I should've just said "high max hit" instead of 80. People are getting really hung up on the number.
---
It’s camped by other 1750 pures
---
Punktuation.
---
He absolutely is, holy shit!
---
You can buy bonds on the website with real money or with ingame money and then give them to your friend. 
---
Alternatively, you could buy a membership card from anywhere that sells them and give your friend the code.
---
To calculate the chance the first person doesn't get the pet and second and third do:  
---
649/650 * 1/650 * 1/650
---
Chance second person doesn't get pet and first/third do:  
---
1/650 * 649/650 * 1/650
---
Chance third person doesn't and first/second do:  
---
1/650 * 1/650 * 649/650
---
This is all of the combinations of 2 pets in 3 people, and all of them are multiplying the same 3 numbers. 
---
Therefore we get 3 * 649/650 * (1/650)^2
---
OP missed out the 649/650 term but it doesn't make a huge difference
---
I'd suggest giving your friend the gp to buy the bond. Otherwise you have to spend the 300k or whatever to make it tradable before you can give or use it on them ingame.
---
U have qpc but still use dramen staff?
---
When the Sire hits 140hp and teles you in front of it, either run south a few spaces if you need to heal with blood barrage(i run about 6 and go back and forth til full hp or close to), or if you don’t need to heal, run south at least 2 spaces. That’s the only way to avoid that attack and make sure you do that RIGHT when you see your character get teled in front of the Sire, to be sure you don’t get hit by that open belly attack.
---
I’ve brought super energies before.
---
I still don't get it. I have the big dumb.
---

4 hours with an average team, 2 hours if you pay maxed barb assault cc's

Cus ironman is just that fucking boring lol.

Staff of blood would be too OP with 70 as max hit capable of hitting 140 in that window. Otherwise pretty interesting I think Ice veng could be create some interesting content

This is pretty sick makes me want to make a Btw

Not really, you join via the CML link and you don’t have to post anything on the subreddit. So you can’t really link the IGN to reddit account if the person doesn’t explicitly say it.
---
I never found killing 1 dragon every 20 minutes fun, but more power to him.
---
Thank.
---
When you avoid that though, you have to avoid poison spots on the floor that come every few ticks, idk how many exactly but id say every 1-2 hits with my arc light sword, then i have to dodge and reattack, and repeat, eventually it’ll stop putting out poison spots but I’ve noticed if you need to heal and go run back to blood barrage, it may start to do poison spots again so just be careful with that. What i do it just always move, if your moving after every attack you wont get hit by the poison forsure.
---
But just keep at you. Youll get the hang of it 💯🙌🏻
---
Before cballs dropped hard. I would buy the iron ore and coal and make them at BF. Doing this doubled my profit at the end of the day. I did them when I was in college studying to 99 and I loved it. I loved the 2 minutes of afk you get and how it made studying easier. You could always smith gold bars between moth bars for good exp and profit

The real joke is people who think brute forcing is a thing that works in 2019. Login attempts get throttled real fast if you try that, even with the case insensitivity it's still trivial to create a password that would take until the heat death of the universe to crack.

It's the speed of the dwh and costs 10% hp. Ags can already hit 80's at 50% spec and ballista can hit above 70 for very little risk.

Aha! Thank you for the clarity. Don't know why this info isn't readily available anywhere.

Well the fact remains that it's Settled's account and he can do what he wants with it. Similarly, you are free to choose to watch his series or not.

I used to think &lt;3 was a little penis and balls, so when couples would do that I thought it was just a fancier way of having sex in game, rather than doing the dance emote.

You get 1 free inv space if you don’t have to use the staff. Thats what you were asking right?

He's not revealing who/when he got the RCB until he releases the video, so odds are good you will not be hunting for the 1b lucky impling at this point. I'm sure he has already got it.

15 kc Zulrah learning train here- it is a lot of fun and it is challenging. I would HIGHLY recommend focusing on switching prayers and positioning *then* committing to your gear swap. Your DPS will obviously suffer, but you won’t get spanked by a surprise Jad hit because you were busy swapping to your BP.
---
The Sara Sword I can understand. But the full dragon fighting jellies on a 1700+ total lvl account made me think that he bought the account. Maybe jellies and bloodvelds using magic based melee attacks isn't as common knowledge as I had thought.
---
I usually only have one of each tool in my bank, except for the 20 or so hammers that I have from grinding out 82 mining at mlm

Why no shortcut??

Do you really this will end with a productive discussion with Jagex? The $11 meme is over. Also most of us are adults now, $11 vs $7 doesn’t really impact me
---
I personally don't have a slayer cape, but heard that the perk was underwhelming, albeit marginally useful. This rework would keep the current spirit of making it a bit more likely to get desirable tasks, but in a more straightforward and predictable way.
---
Ohh sick, well I’m looking forward too it, just wanna get my rune dragon alt up and running
---
As if all special attack have to be super useful.
---
186.41 miles is 299.99 repeating of course km
---
Counter argument: poll slayer 2 and require maces, warhammers, longswords, longbows, and elemental spells to be used in order to gain experience.
---
The kill itself is fine and fairly easy to execute and learn, it's busy the setup takes forever especially since the meta is to ornate pool between kills

Ah didnt know you could do that tho, helps thx

&gt;We were asked to cut back on direct references to it in our mobile app, so as to comply with app store rules. For menu text (e.g. Barbarian Assault) we were able to do the change just on mobile without affecting the desktop game, but for NPC names it would have been very awkward.

Also just FYI Nobody in finance will call something a “cash asset”, what he was trying to say is “liquid asset” and in layman terms that is just an asset that can be easily converted to cash
---
First of all, NICE DEATH SHIRT.
---
secondly, I too am in the prime of my life.
---
That's because kids have little playtime and don't know anything about the game. Nowadays everybody knows that a 99 is just 'watch youtube for x amount of time'
---
Go outside fam 😂
---
Science.
---
If dev time is going to be spent making them then yes, they should be useful SOMEWHERE.
---
The current perk is already very strong. Your first suggestion is overpowerd and your second suggestion is unnecessary on a cape that is already powerful.
---
underrated comment
---
And get rigour. It will help out loads in getting more kills
---
That sounds like xp waste.
---
But in all honesty. It's about accessibility and comfort. Sure you can go fishing irl but you need to get the gear, a permit, find a location and hope you catch something. 
---
Or...you could pull out your computer or phone and watch that sweet, sweet xp drop.
---
It's an escape from the real world for a bit and people can progress quickly and feel accomplished whereas irl that takes a lot more time. It can be more rewarding but it's short term satisfaction we all love and chase.
---
You defo wanna gring out elite void before camping vork..makes a pretty big difference
---
Could have already had a clue
---
theres caskets....they jusy went 12 under the drop raate.  28 instead of 40
---
Win+Shift+S for quick access to snipping tool that saves to your clipboard.
---
did any of the medium clues pay off tho?
---
I second this statement. Autumn Voyage is by far my favorite track in the game.
---
Well plucked, sir!
---
Clearly there's a misunderstanding. I wanted it to convert my comment. Not the guy I'm replying tos comment.
---
Your stats are really low tbh and you're using sub par gear(no elite void and no lance/dhcb, no runepouch)
---
I suspect you'll make more money at zulrah or even non bosses like demonic gorillas on task(which would also level up your slayer to unlock better things to kill for gp like nechs/cerb).
---
They banned my name hung solo :(
---
Rough, I got prim at 100 and was super hyped about the boss before going almost 800 dry of any crystal. You'll get one eventually.

With the right block list you can almost always ensure you've got a good task or a really quick one you can bust out in a few minutes with expedious bracelets.

an 4-5 hour b. Nice
---
Vorkath's stuffed head being named differently too.
---
Did you edit it to have the 20 km and stuff? or did you edit the first bit in quickly?
---
You can get a ton of xp unlocking bones to peaches, infinity boots, master wand and mages book. You're gonna have to do mage training eventually so it might be good to just train your magic to 70 that way.
---
The time taken to charge the armour and maintain it makes it very much a non budget set of gear if you consider how much gp you could have made in the meantime.
---
Thanks for all the answers guys! Didn't think about the things you guys mentioned. So I'm going to remove the thread :) cheers
---
XP waste is worthy of capital punishment.
---
No HC status anymore.
---
Chofl
---
Poh altars seem to be really reasonable as they are and any sort of boost wouodnt be good
---
Ezscape
---
I think the bigger problem is that it seems parliament didn't do even a shred of research before inviting them. Jagex had no business being there except as an example of the very things they were decrying.
---
A discussion*
---
Stop this shit will cause a civil war
---
They don't get enough shame for not properly testing their code.  Sure, stuff like this happens occasionally in every company.  But far too often at Jagex for the price we pay
---
i mean the average clue is aparently worth 10k and they usually take like 2 minutes to do
---
It would make absolutely no sense for Jagex to do anything you mentioned, so by extension it makes no sense for you to have even made this post.
---
I got muted for "Selling pubes" in Catherby and dropping a bunch of yak hair on the ground with a buddy. It was his final offense and he got perma muted for it lol.
---
Well yeah it's just a timer, it starts when you take a sip and ends the exact time later
---
*witch hunt.  You're whining and want to witch hunt against Jagex for literally nothing
---
Obviously they are going to do so and they are absolutely allowed to, I have no problem with that.
---
I would like to see the changes they made when I view the weekly update notes.
---
The bonds argument is dumb imo. I could work 15 minutes or spend 1.5-2 hours in game to get a bond. It's not a reasonable trade.
---
i just hop worlds when it needs to be fixed and i need to fill the hopper :\~\~\^) faster than fixing it and i dont have to help others so its a double win.
---
We say it in the south too
---
There are far too many assumptions here to really be credible. You need to look at the xp/h of each task, the average task length and the weighting from the slayer master. Oh and also do it based on duradel with points from konar tasks for every 50+ milestones for skips.
---
In reality players only actually do about 10-12 different tasks and skip everything else, being able to double the chance of getting the highest xp/h one of these is going to make a noticable difference to overall xp.
---
I like this
---
oh hurr durr this small change with literally no negative impact could lead to further small impact-less changes that are for the better of the game as a whole because they enable mobile!
---
jeeeze, what's next, jagex making sure we can all play the game we love on all the platforms we enjoy for ANOTHER year!?!
---
Call me a noob but, isn’t abyssal demons 84 slayer? How do you boost slayer?
---
Ok you're right, you know me better than I myself do.
---
Sounds like it isn't a clan and it's just a couple people doing it as they feel like.  Probably not a bad moneymaker on an alt or something.
---
I knew Wyvern running is still alive and well, had no idea people did it for wyrms as well. Neat.
---
Packastand lmao
---
This reminds me of when I was playing rs when I was young, and I had just learned the magic of using symbols to swear. So naturally I walked up to some random dude, asked for like 10gp, and he said no. I typed “@$$” and logged out instantly, and I’m pretty sure I was scared as shit after but I don’t remember exactly. It’s like one of those weird like 10 second memories that you have for no reason
---
This is only happening with runelite? I guess try the all-platform version if you haven't.
---
Hmmm that's a good point.
---
 a q p

It's more like $8/month with the 6 month package
---
I'm 99 wc, 30m xp no pet. I have uncontrollable hate for those with pet but if someone is like 50 wc I'm just like "nice".
---
Some just don’t want to put out that amount of effort for internet points
---
Fucking hell, cant you just enjoy the weather instead of making everything blow up....
---
I got 2 drake claws and a drake tooth on a drake task yesterday, each drop is 1/2500. I have never received a unique drop from anything else ever. The three drops add up to less than 2 mil.
---
I’m not sure if this is how it works, but wouldn’t everyone alching there just be able to randomly attack each other with any spell? I feel like most people wouldn’t go with anything expensive.
---
a q p w
---
I used to scream at people that said Ty after a trade, insisting that Ty was not my name.
---
What? Your Magikarp is evolving!
---
My sister got muted for calling someone a bitch ass
---
Literally fuming right now, almost smashed my phone when I saw the changes.  That Jagex would dare to change the game, honestly it makes my knees weak.
---
I like these ideas but the favored tasks might be a bit op. I think a once daily free skip would be a really good perk to add.
---
Everytime I post my past offences from back in the day everyone says they're fake. Feelsbadman
---
Nice though
---
Yes, that seems to be /u/Countertoplol's point as well. Would've been nice to have this conversation without getting downvoted hard, though. Idk why people do that in this subreddit.
---
You fool you could have called it RuneCraft
---
I feel so sorry for you, that kind of luck could have changed yours and your future generations financial situations astronomically :(
---
Ah didn’t know, thanks for clarification
---
I do what brings me enjoyment in my free time. I don't care what is considered "productive" or what social norms are. I enjoy sitting at my computer alone playing a video game a lot more than I enjoy going out and hanging out with people. It's just who I am and I've come to terms with it. So instead of forcing myself into situations that I don't truly enjoy (which I used to do a lot) I just do what I enjoy. It also makes other activities feel a little more special because I do them more rarely.
---
just buy 40m from a gold seller bruh
---
It’s actually cheaper to buy gold, and use that gold to buy bonds, than it is to pay $11 for a membership. 
---
Not saying I recommend that, but it’s a fact. 
---
1m costs about $0.62
---
Yeah. That’s it
---
this holds true if you go 75 att as well, going 55 pray from 52 wont affect your combat lvl
---
Laughable
---
Dad, when I grow up  
---
Things are gonna blow up   
---
I'm gonna be a man just like you
---
I’ve been looking for this. Thanks I hate it
---
most hackings ARE the fault of the player, but jagex does have shit security flaws that other companies dont.
---
When someone uses the word ‘packastand’ it’s probably just better for everyone if they aren’t allowed to talk anymore
---
53m here, tho technically it's only 45m since pet was released
---
Just like human existence
---
It's not balanced though, you are not accounting for points from skipping bad tasks. People slaying for XP only do 12 tasks and skip everything else. Being able to double the frequency of the highest XP task is huge given it's a solid 30-40% faster xp/h than any other task.
---
FWIW I haven't up or downvoted anything in this thread.
---
Yeah you're right, thanks for the addition :)
---
Meta.
---
pakastan lmao, you didnt know the analfabet
---
Haha no my friend I am telling him to extend every task.
---
I mean you'd also need 95 hunter and insane luck to catch that exact lucky imp for yourself lmao.
---
Imbiamba jombes
---
Dikke BMW Jongens
---
Probably because you proposed a change to something you don't use and don't have much knowledge about, then proceeded to argue after being told why your idea was silly.
---
Are you aware of Authenticator?
---
What does brb mean
---
maxed, by the way
---
movies like 100 years old dude
---
I’m glad you’re not gambling IRL money, but you probably need to seek help.
---
L0l I got banned for some weird shit back then too. And perm muted
---
yes its sarcasm, tilted osrs players
---
Back in the day people would try to bait you into getting mute by tricking the victim into asking personal information then they'd report the person lol
---
Our XP boosts are global and do not give individual benefits :D We like to have everyone on the same level, no P2W!
---
I just did it last night and there was a moment when I was at the fractional still with my coal tar that  had thought I had overdone it and wasted the barrel.   
---
The idea of trudging back through that damn tunnel to retrieve another was not a welcome one.
---
No the skill is Runecraft. We're talking about RuneCraft here.
---
I had to download it in a different browser. Also make sure your on runelite.net
---
A godsword would only beat faster weapons if the thing you're trying to kill is dying so fast you're not guaranteed a 2nd hit.
---
I started playing a little over 2 months ago and have been grinding a lot, I’m lvl 90 and still ask noob questions all the time.
---
just curious what makes dhcb "way" more effort at vorkath? both are just afk hit the boss no?
---
Fun as in not boring I guess
---
85 but yea pie boost
---
Okay I’ll probably go lance then
---
He’s not from Venezuela though.
---
now that the method's been proven its time to raise the stakes. bring over the karamjan rum, fellas!
---
Okay yeah I rather do melee then
---
Windows + Shift + S
---
Sire is tedious af. I do it when i get the task but extending it seems crazy as its just super slow kills, that arent great money or xp unless you get a dagger or bludgeon from the unsired. 
---
And kraken is super easy so extending it would be fine especially if you want/need a trident or the pet.
---
You can also use dueling rings to tele to clan wars and go in and out of the white portal to refill health/run energy.
---
The amount of people who don't use Lightshot is disgusting.
---
Uhhh so back in the day at around 10 years old my friends and I made prostitutes in the game named cexaholic1-cexaholic9. Went around using the dance emote on people to make money.
---
Lol dragon darts?
---
Hate you btw, atm on task aswell and haven’t seen a zenyte ever. 800+ kc
---
Still gratz
---
I got muted for spamming '4x' at the air altar next to a mod who was doing the same thing lol
---
May have been exaggerating, but you still have to switch bolts and a piece of mage gear so your crumble undead hits, also have to switch to blowpipe to woox walk, with full bandos you won't have to switch at all besides a damage reduction spec that you technically don't even need.
---
Exactly, save the squad an inventory space at gwd.
---
Definitely should skip that task when you get a chance. Steel dragons are a block irons are a skip.
---
That ring saved you..
---
Gz!!!!
---
Badass
---
I got it!
---
$11 is great for the updates we get. The quests that come out, think of kebos as a big of fuckin piece of dlc that will be frequently updated! I'm fairly content to support my favorite game keep running.
---
I kinda wish I could buy jagex myself and up the wages slightly and allow cross account types (1 uim 1 hcim 1 regular for rs3 &amp; osrs) 
---
It has nothing to do with being in a position to max my account illegally and to have infinite gp....
---
Just need to farm another 5 quadrillion gold at the sand casino and i'm good to go buy jagex /s
---
Oooooooh livin' on a praye.... Oops wrong skill
---
Yeah I actually forgot to unload bp from Bandos trip haha xD Gl on your dry streak tho!
---
You've obviously gone insane given your title.
---
4k zulrah kc, 500+ raids yet i am literally dogshit at sire. almost died every single attempt of fighting it. cancer boss lmao
---
U only need to put it in every 30 days
---
TBOW crashed down to 920m, now it's back up to 1050. It will correct eventually once it hits a floor.
---
my 30 days was up and it was asking for it
---
Hey waddya know, i died the exact. Same. Way. For my 60m setup. It was about 10 min before i had to go to work so i was fucking devastated too that i really just couldnt do anything besides sit there in disbelief at my own stupidity. But you rebuild and grow and learn to be less stupid and youll eventually become more rich than that 40m ever meant, it'll still sting to remember it but not as bad. Good luck on the grind.
---
Same, it was annoying as hell but also kinda thrilling when I lost the head to my rune axe I'd so carefully saved up for
---
The social norm **IS** exactly what you are doing.  
---
Don't you see that your own self is at stake? Nobody is asking you to be productive, quite the opposite. You don't have to engage with other people to engage with the reality.
---
Don't you think that there's barely anything of you left to represent to yourself or even have the ability to self reflect if you play games all day? 
---
Do you think about yourself daily as a human being( a psychological and philosophical being) or do days "just pass"?
---
I am asking why are you not fishing in real life, but instead fish in Runescape? Surely you agree fishing in real life is more complex, engaging and interesting! Way more grindy too!
---
Regarding your friends, there are a lot of different people in the world. I am very confident that if you seek, you will find friends in real life who don't exhaust you.
---
The problem is retrofitting because theres no way to know what your first 99 was for players who already have it
---
r/theymaybedidthemath
---
I just skill with my significant other and then it feels better :D
---
Bro wtf yes! Even avoiding the copyright would be so simple to do. Can you imagine if RuneScape got their hands in the Pokémon pool? Not like Pokémon even needs it. Holy shit though.
---
ex-HCIM btw
---
you dont have to do literally any of that lol. woox walking with dhcb is just as good. idk what youre on about with the mage thing. you dont need to switch to anything to hit crumble lol. you do have to switch bolts i guess so 1 extra click per fight than lance assuming you dont defense drain?
---
Youre def giga exaggerating lol.
---
You must have a 2 Def Pure.
---
Did a pker congratulate you on the construction cape last night lol?

I'll bring it g. PM me your username.

How much does this service usually cost?
---
All i got in my box was tuna potatoes wtf
---
Nice same thing happened to me a while back
---
to be honest just find a regular team, the people that pay cc's is mostly to get lvl 5 in all rolls for the elite diary or to grind the pet
---
You are crazy 😂😂😂
---
Nice.
---
Bones roo Bablets
---
True,that's why it's on my blocked list
---
It's $132 a year for a bot filled spaghetti game that has frequent game breaking bugs, no customer service, and terrible account security.
---
It is by no means "great".
---
Motherf'er stole my name (or I stole his by unknowingly). I have it with a 'K', though to make it more subtle...
---
lier
---
Agility hates you too.
---
Thats one opinion. 
---
I think dont think they are cool because they are harder to get. 90% of the capes doesn’t add any difficulty. I find they have a better aesthetic. So very far from pointless
---
The terror sponsors.
---
The place to get help with this is the runellite discord not the rs subreddit really... but your issue is with the dpi scaling should be able to disable it in the plugin config
---
Should be a wet rat
---
Or you could have the option to insure your untrimmed if you lose it, similar to a pet
---
Good morning! I see the snipers have failed.
---
just nolife it for a single day and you'll have 70 forever. Or just get 65+summer pie
---
LMAO? thats legit the 60 iq skull trick
---
Yes. Which is technically bug abuse and therefore shouldn’t be a mechanic for keeping an untrimmed cape. Very unfair to players that don’t use exploits.
---
how is better xp usefull at 99 tho?
---
&gt;Making this mistake when you've already completed f-cape
---
Meme checking out
---
No, it's mom ruoy.

burrying bones doesn't remove cash from the game lol

Which is not fair to players to didn’t use an unintended mechanic through telegrab.
---
I’ve been bamboozled
---
😂
---
Because 100 people is the least I'm expecting doing this. You could hop more, but after few minutes other people would have already scouted all the worlds.
---
More effective salt-wise than spending time extracting substances in a salt mine
---
Most total worlds have them or is you want the wiki had the unofficial world, but you don't go to the bank anymore you go yo the northwest of the marketplace(ardy teleport is right here)
---
It moved here becuz a lot of ppl use the suicide method where you keep law runes and a water staff on you and when you die you protect the staff and 2 laws to tele right back pick up the other laws and coins and resume.
---
Me so I can test it huehue
---
Congrats I thought you were gonna max out on Sunday
---
Better game, yet posts on osrs reddit :thinking:
---
Same first task in, never knew how rare it was
---
Side side to side
---
i figured it had to be but there are a million plugins and i am just starting to use it and searching for "health and prayer bar thingy" wasn't getting me very far :P
---
Again, value of the currency and the rewards is irrelevant. You are spinning a virtual slot machine.   
---
  
---
Also, they do have value outside of the gamble. If you die with a fighter torso on a pvp world (probably in wildy too), it drops some cash. The points are linked to static amount of gp. So yes, you can lose money so even by your own definition it's still gambling.
---
This is such a rad account build. Savage. Sick name too
---
No Fortnite is actually released on Mobile unlike this one.
---
I did sire at 85 def with no problems. What are you wearing? Tanky armor such as Torags would really help if you wanted to go back. As long as you don’t get hit by the poison flower things that come out of the ground you should be able to dps it down before you need to heal. A BGS/DWH both work really well here also. I wouldn’t do it without one of the two tho honestly because kills can take too long without the specs if you get unlucky.
---
Honestly you should just play on one account until you can afford bonds for alts. If you're playing on multiple low level accounts that can't even do ranarr trips yet, i'd work on one main first. You can make a bond in like an hour of play time ranarr farming, this is over the course of a few days though. playing 15 minutes a day.
---
sigh... on every chad post
---
I'm just being realistic, which I think is preferable when discussing suggestions as opposed to some of the other comments. Saying something like "great suggestions, I could use the ice staff to freeze bandos" when it's objectively better in every way to use a zgs instead doesn't help anybody.
---
awesome thanks ill look into it!
---
For some reason it would take me some time to find my damn axe head when it would fly off
---
Snipers take the shot
---
Its not that bad, but almost all the money is in the unsired drops, and most of THAT money is in the abyssal bludgeon, which you cannot cash out on until you get all three pieces. So if you want to make money there you are committed for quite a while since each piece is ~1/200.
---
Cerb is def worth to do at 91 atleast to just try out and see if you like it. I particularly don’t, but a couple of my buddies get insane money from it and enjoy the boss.
---
One Small Favor is one of my favorites. It knows that it's a ridiculous series of fetch quests and cops to it. The character dialogue gets in on the fun and I rather like the reward. Had a good time doing OSF, would do again.
---
And he's explained his stance and outlined why he disagrees in other comments.
---
Ew
---
One thing that still baffles me and I’m a security practitioner; why doesn’t jagex enable special characters into their passwords?
---
Headbang his dick
---
The brightness one made me lose it laughing. 
---
Good stuff
---
As opposed to using your computer such things?
---
You don't repair the gear with the points. You repair the gear with more money than what was dropped. You also lost the money because you died not because spent points on a supply roll.
---
Lucky bastard
---
I can see a centimeter of your construction level, your account is mine.
---
I got this drop in my mid-70s. Except I didn't notice it until I saw someone stroll in the room and pick it up. Shit luck at everything since.
---
Tipping is not mandatory, it's just kind to do so.
---
They do though idiot.
---
That's my Hope's and dreams.
---
You don't have to repair the gear. You spend the gear on the armour, turn it into gp, then drop the broken armour. The points now have a monetary value.
---
u/Titletoimagebot
---
Its actually great when I get Steel and Iron Dragons for Slayer on my alt. I get a solid 2 dragon kills per Extended-Antifire dose, crossbowing them down with my 50 ranged. Just browse Reddit or watch Netflix and take a look at my guy every 5 minutes or so.
---
He’d learn what red writing meant after that lmao
---
This makes me feel bad. Got scammed on an Ely split on Monday night...
---
It is possible! The GOR gets prioritised when checking out, I only did this on mobile and I think it's the only way possible to do it
---
I enjoyed thieving tbh lol
---
Oops all unnoted potatoes
---
Kind have
---
If you had high run energy, high agility, or both, that may be a reason why. 
---
Then again, I'm pretty sure Jagex is making these quests easier so people can get to SotE quicker, so if you did it recently, that's why.
---
I’ve always heard Herblore was fairly expensive, is this true? 
---
Would I come across any problems doing thieving as a level 3? I’m a returning player and I can’t remember how this skill affects being attacked, etc.
---
Looks at gif and doesn't realize I'm using mobile. Suggests I'm dumb for not using shift click. Not so attentive are you? Making community look bad.
---
P.S mobile is a major game player and totem for the community. Enhancing it's quality of life benefits the community. So please do not speak of the community which should shun you, bitch.
---
Pretty sure one of the mods said they can't track your first 99 due to engine stuff.
---
im confused as to what situation you would have finished mm2 yet you're still training at crabs
---
Is that the RS3 lumbridge or did they change it that much in the like half a year I haven't played?
---
twist: its ops gofundme. he hopes some jovial suckers will donate as a joke to help 'this child'. im on to you OP
---
You need Jesus
---
Oh no, not that tip.
---
You had me until you said “negative experience lamps”
---
I’ll vote no to that every time. Pures shouldn’t be catered to.
---
was documenting shops for the wiki anyway
---
I would like to discuss this but its not a freemium game with microtransactions like most games. Its rare
---
I had issues with attempts on my account a long time even bank wiped a couple times (the account is 11 years old so it seen the horror days of lack of security)
---
Ever since I put an authenticator on my account years ago and all that stopped completely. No bank pin, even have a really simple password because I’m lazy. It’s kinda boils down to people being idiots and falling for scams and phishing emails. And all the security in the world won’t help that. Really honestly only a very small percentage of people being hacked are just do to being unlucky. It’s mainly people being idiots then blaming the game for their own actions.
---
Holy shit dude run the hell away from that thing
---
Yes, if you buy bonds. 
---
If you rwt you could be banned.
---
Someone is awful cranky today, aren’t they? Does someone need a nap-nap?
---
Documenting stuff for WIKI &lt;- Seems you have even more free time than I thought.
---
Never got the pet the first time so I wouldn’t know what this post means.
---
Remember those elves. They rotate between two locations and you need them to recharge your teleport seeds (Mourning’s End Pt I) and for the Roving Elves Quest.
---
No, seriously. If all you do is bitch about it, why play?
---
I was watching Coxie grinding out Bandos some more and it hit me that we may never get some drops. AT ALL. 
---
I know that’s obvious (and we’re all acutely aware of it) but when you really think about it and how we grind something until we complete it, there’s a chance of there not being an end point. 
---
I’m currently hunting a mutagen. Not dry, but I thought “I may never actually get one. Ever”.
---
I then turned my thoughts to standard uniques. Imagine never getting another Zulrah unique and going insanely dry. It’s catastrophically demotivating.
---
Crafting cape is actually semi-useful since it’s an unlimited tele right to a bank.
---
Jagex did change the UGP fail rates right after SoTE but then reverted them and cried “bug” when they got bitched at for unpolled changes. 
---
Apparently it was changed because Jagex assumes it would pass a poll so didn’t poll it.
---
Congrats man, you’re so brave so the rest of us don’t have to be. I believe in you!
---
Melee is more profit I think. Don’t hold me to it but not using bolts or certain pots goes a long way
---
 I had to install Linux on my chrome book to play osrs
---
Definitely negotiable. I'm not a pure or account "locked" in any way. I just know people have been talking about it and I thought the experience drain fit the darkness of the quest line.
---
But yes. Negotiable.
---
Excellent concept, fantastic execution. Good work.
---
My favorite was "stupid nik her"
---
you are dumb for not having a pc lmao its 2019
---
Did it also turn you into a pirate?
---
?
---
Worst part is if you dont notice and flick prayers for an hour only to find out when youre on the magers
---
He saved up a ton of squirk juice and turned it in all in 1 day
---
both are not fun, the boss is called snorekath for a reason
---
I'd say barrage dust or nechs
---
That's a thing? Jeez, that's sad. I remember ahk being a big issue, but I haven't played in a bit. I'm just disappointed because I'd love to have a reason to play again, but at this point pvp isn't enjoyable.
---
Collection going great I see.
---
It's my turn to post this in a week
---
Counter suggestion:  Swap the period for the green pixel in the construction icon.
---
so when will they adress a literal casino in this game?
---
Yeah I thought more people would understand this but I guess not
---
Its all in game so its not rwt.
---
Damn u still play? havent seen you  streaminng for looong time. thought u quited.
---
so we should send a mail to apple that there's a casino in osrs, they might finally remove it then lol
---
/u/Adam1210
---
Now that's some impressive magic use. I will forever be bad at this game.
---
Slayer staff (e) is pretty useful as well.

Agrees in guthix

I should’ve but I was at work. Sorry
---
Thanks a lot :D

Thank you for the info! I really appreciate it, goes to show just how helpful this community can be(: Gl on your grind!

The crunch is you when you accidentally click under him
---
Bruh so poor people are dumb now. You do not know this ngga bro. He might have medical bills or some shit. Real talk ease up.
---
## bruh 😎😎😎😎😎
---
Dude wtf no one is supposed to know about this method
---
I mean I don't expect jagex to tell a panel of people that they do have some form of player gambling, and it's actually kinda a problem. I don't think whatever tribunal they have in the UK would be very nuanced about it
---
This guy is right, when you go to the bond store it should automatically select Google balance. if not, when it comes to the payment option screen just tap the payment option and select it
---
The twitch month is long gone.  They're abusing the 7 day trials for mobile players

Hell Yeah, I’ll hop on when I get home! Preciate you!
---
Hell yeah! I’ll jump in when I get home! Appreciate it!
---
Who would win, 100 f2p bots or 1 geared member
---
I don't know why this isn't more obvious to people. There are people out there paying $55/month for a main and 4 alts.
---
Lol noob
---
Snipers take your shot
---
That's the best kind of not incorrect
---
nobody uses points to skip for a single task, its horribly inefficient unless you got all your points from efficient wildy slay
---
I have not stated that I know better, I simply want to understand.   
---
Yes, you can get your dopamine from real life as well! Except when you are in real life, you engage with reality and your own personality( own self) is not lost in the process.
---
You don't actually accomplish anything online. If you start reading up your memories, you will remember far more anything and everything from real life than online.  
---
You also don't get any new ideas or a feeling of self when you are in your simulation; you're essentially in a coma.   
---
I just don't understand why is living in a self-induced coma a more rational decision than living an authentic life of choices made in the reality?   
---
I would hate myself if I had spend my last 2 weeks clicking 1 spot for 12h in a row in a simulation, yet everyone does that and I'm supposedly the insane one for not understanding the pleasure of that.
---

---
What a baby.
---
Haha nice man got my first 3 unsired within 15 kc. Got 2 pieces and a head then eventually got the third 150ish kc
---
Yeah kc doesn’t really say much unless you know what team size people are running
---
That would be the *funniest* thing to watch someone discover after finally dealing 1,000,000 damage.
---
Off the streets and in my nose
---
I'd pay good money to watch a pker get this pet instead of a kill on a 2hp spade carrier with bulwark. Good, good money.
---
" What would be a good npc to kill with good drops, safespottable, and weak to magic? I want to afk fireblast on my ironman while i work but also want some decent drops like alchs or herbs. Any suggestions? "  -imissrs
---
" Should i sell my skins and claws on the ge or turn them in for nests? Leme know what ya think! "  -imissrs
---
These are stupid questions with an easily researchable answer. Yet you decided to come to reddit and make a useless post that shows how stupid and unresourceful you truely are. :)
---
Yo you were one of the first people I ever watched on twitch like 3-4 years ago. I loved your content and you even put me on to the Slay Brother, CJ, who I came to love just as much. Hope you’re doing well and I’m so hype to see that you’re maxing when you said you never thought you would!
---
Are you at a disadvantage compared to someone using Runelite? Yes
---
Is the game unplayable with the official client? Not at all.
---
Nice lol, I’m fine with getting pet late since I’m there for gp anyways, what makes me salty is that I got 4 shards and no seeds when they were like 30 mil lol
---
lol, dc takes another one.
---
Wow how unskilled
---
I ate my summer pie during regicide and had to make a third trek.
---
Saw that coming.. still hurts though.
---
I wouldn't say it's awful. But definitely lacking in certain features that should already be implemented such as GPU rendering for increased render distance. Anti aliasing wouldn't be terrible either.
---
UK is not the same as GMT during the summer, which is GMT+1. The Pacific timezone, where I am located, is GMT-7.
---
Yeah will do.
---
Deals with 9
---
You're lieing
---
axe = axe
---
battleaxe = battleaxe
---
im pretty sure im not the only one that hated it when RS changed their axe names to hatchet 🤔
---
Im actually all in favor of this event now. Unironically.
---
Sit
---
Should i use broad bolts for barrows?
---
And nothing of value was lost, another boring, no personality HCIM streamer bites the dust, guess he's going to have to look for a real job now he can't rake in the donations from Zoomers trying to live their HCIM fantasies through a streamer, he'll most likely make a new account and be milking the same repeated content within a week, sad.
---
Okay. Then get max qp. Get jagex to allow you to complete quests with no combat requires. Figure out how to kill every boss without combat.
---
I did this in a raid yesterday.
---
Not really though? Chests are generally for all the stupid shit you get too much of. It'd be really easy to go get whatever you need at any time.
---
I will look into this, thank you!
---
You say that but have you ever gotten silver ore and chaos y’all from bandos?
---
rofl :D
---
Well they use air runes, so
---
Wait really? U got a source for that?
---
I tank for my group at bandos with similar levels except my magic is 90, still wear kharils top. I find tho if we don't hit bgs specs I get destroyed by the range attack, we average about 40-50 kills a trip
---
Weirdest dc I’ve seen
---
I just recharged it, you're right, it's 2.5k. :/
---
\&gt;53% is not a majority
---
Youre not a clown, youre the entire fucking circus.
---
Gratz dude
---
PRESIDENT OF THE UK
---
sad game
---
This would actually be a good april fools event though
---
Gz my man
---
Hcim is cool and all but honestly its pretty telling that almost every single high profile hcim thats died has died to DC
---
Listen dude. I said I knew it was a stupid thing to do. I haven't played this game long enough to know what scans are what. Obviously I didn't know it was a thing, so I'm sure others don't know either. I wasn't paying attention, like I said, I was at work. I'm not going to sit here and argue with you over it. It was stupid, I'm just fucking extending a warning so it doesn't keep happening.
---
One that makes money to pay for other buyables
---
u seem salty
---
Game is fucked, constant DC's and thousands of hours wasted.
---
Your computer has a built in screenshot button.
---
I seen that whilst catching lizards! I was wondering the same thing. It must be able to wander pretty freely.
---
Official Client isn't that bad. There is nothing that should require a third-party client... except maybe scouting Raids 1 effectively. The main features clients offer are overlays or such to keep track of things like potion timers.
---
grats! I'm lucky too, I got my 3 bludgeon pieces at 96 kc. keep going for that pet!
---
I once brought  regular anti venom when i finally got a +5 on construction after a couple hours of trying. Took me 3 hours to get another 5 boost
---
I recently checked my stuff like that and saw I had been banned for a short time like 10 years ago. "Lol im on my bro's acc" apparently got me banned for account sharing. Brothers, man.
---
i lost it at that point
---
Yet another reason to switch to classic WOW
---
Just a flair and bragging rights :)
---
Get 90+ def and ppl that are non friends will be more inclined to go with you. Otherwise you're just going to be a liability/supply guzzler.
---
"now turn it upside down..."
---
"Oh goddamnit!!!"
---
Whenever i hear of a high tier HCIM dying i always hope it's due to a mistake so i can laugh at them.
---
Just sucks to see them die to a DC.
---
I consider this a very important lesson. Yes I'm an idiot. Yes I made a huge mistake. I learned from it, and it wont happen again. It could have been much worse for sure
---
Never considered that... That's a really good idea.
---
Misterwieb1
---
Why not?
---
So thats a no on proof? Eat it.
---
I disconnect every day but my internet is wonky
---
I already got offered 5 ea
---
Are you British?
---
Nice to see people still abyss rc. This sub may shit on the skill but abyss rc is really chill. Not click intensive at all just slow xp but good money.
---
It was in 2011
---
Yeah Addy darts are the way to go
---
Staff of Ice would certainly have uses in hybrid plays. Freezes would prevent counterattack in situations.
---
So that explains the level 80 or so that I thought was trying to crash me on my 120 main, but didn't speak. Just thought they were clueless
---
You certainly aren’t
---
What an odd/unfortunate dc. Did his teammates DC as well? 
---
I know the servers have been shit lately, none of my friends and are have dced like that but the entire world will like pause/lag for all us at the same time for a good 1-3 seconds at times. 
---
Didn't really seem like his internet either, considering his stream was fine.
---
my current situation?  Whats wrong with that?
---
You become a 'high profile hcim' by taking risks and not being a pussy.
---
Stop talking out of your ass
---
I think he's just trying to end the series. His final goal was ToB and if he doesnt have the rcb he won't be able to do it. There's not much other content in Morytania is there?
---
gotcha, thanks
---
I’m interested to know how much they got you for
---
As a person returning to RS after over a decade I respectfully disagree. The GPU plugin makes osrs 5x better ALONE, let alone all the other amazing shit.
---
Wait so with these new higher accuracy robes and staff spec you would hit consistent 50-60s with a minimum of 20 for 60s? That sounds insanely overpowered to me
---
Oh really, sick thanks for the tip
---
gotcha, thanks!
---
Not important
---
Storms.
---
Electricity network going down from w/e else.
---
Internet dieing cuz w/e
---
many ways, not frecuently, but it happens
---
IN RS2 I've lost a fuck ton of items and void sets in tormented demons from closts, they were extremely profitable tho
---
Bro that’s too funny. I never cared about iron man bc I dc all the time and die. Happens every hydra trip. That little maroon helmet ment a lot to this kid. Best part is when he says “no” before he reconnects
---
lol, what ever you said my dude.
---
Someone in the chat said "get fucked kid"
---
Mage pure with very low hp.
---
That bastard is probably taking all the lucky implings.
---
You suck but this was kinda funny.
---
Prices for potions and herblore materials always fluctuate a lot
---
rune yes. dragon? no (at cox idk about tob)
---
u/title2imagebot
---
ive been trying to figure out how to do it on my chromebook for over a year now. still cant figure it out
---
runelite entity highlighter iirc
---
Those are some abysmal fucking drops holy shit
---
Bootcamp centos, use runelite and turn off some plugins. Since your using pro you could just boot up a vm with centos. 
---
Mac never ran java that well, never will. While mac is just a branch of linux most linux os run java smoother, especially centos.
---
i'd smash
---
Here’s one simple tip, play one account at a time. Then when your ready to swap over, cancel one and start the other. This probably sounds like sarcasm or shit advice... well it’s not.
---
I had an iron and a main for about a year didn’t play them both swapped between the two thinking oh no what about my original sub fee. Nah man 2x accounts that you play one at a time isn’t cheaper or more cost effective than really enjoying one at a time. 
---
But that’s just my $11...
---
How did you get remote access set up between your devices?
---
That said they have done massive work with the elves and vampire questlines
---
hook me up with a nice village spawn seed
---
This is jokes.
---
Pretty sure F2P worlds dont load the members areas as members cant even get passed the gate. 
---
Awesome April fools idea
---
That looks more like a client freeze than a dc doesn't it? With how the "eat anglerfish" stays frozen there, every other dc I have seen people could scroll over/click items like normal but it just wouldn't do anything.
---
Go for agility like me!!!
---
I loved the Sea Slug questline, I just wish it didn't end up on a penguin quest in RS3 LEL, I do like the quest idea as well. Maybe have the locator simply bring you to Witchaven, instead of somewhere random? That way it ties the slugs in more neatly
---
Damn, talk about omega luck! Gratz! 
---
Btw, how's runelite running over there? My last task had way too many frame stutters so the task was near impossible. :(
---
What do you think the customs officers do with it?
---
What a wild world live in!
---
I used d legs all the way to 99 slayer on my normie iron, because I hate GWD KC, and didn't want to waste gp repairing my veracs. Only switched to guthans for the heal.
---
He said max mage as well. So you would have to risk full ancestral and tormented brace to hit a 70.
---
Are we all going to ignore that he has THE Rarest pet in the game? THE RAREST!
---
this is too perfect coming from a sick nerd fanboy lmao
---
Stop trying to buff skillcapes.
---
All I want for Christmas is for changes to make it into the patch notes.
---
None of this "yes things were changed in underground pass in the expectation that the poll would pass, and then weren't reverted or documented when the poll failed"
---
Splashing was great back in RS3 when you could stay logged in until the next update, but now it sucks. You’re way better off xp and gp-wise to just auto-alch.
---
Seriously. And if you can't afford $11 a month, you definitely have enough time to earn 4m every 2 weeks.
---
was it yours?
---
You can buy a tinderbox in one of the stores kver there in regicide.
---
Noticed it while browsing when my uim did it
---
Lmfao that’s actually hilarious dude
---
Why would you ever enter your user/pw AND bank pin on one of those links? Like i dont understand. Its so obvious and if you've been around the internet for longer than a day you'd realize its an obvious phish attempt. 
---
Not being rude my guy, but its honestly just super obvious shit. The amount of scammers in game is annoying also, especially the duel arena ones because they're so fucking obvious and literally impossible to make work unless you are TRULY Not paying attention whatsoever since the game wont let you accept if rules change and also tells you if your preset isn't loaded..but alas people do it because obv ppl are falling for it.
---
nylos don't have a whole lot of health tho so they could still be an option
---
Gotcha. Someone else in this thread mentioned putting dust runes in the rune pouch instead of air and earth runes so you can fit law runes for a home tele. Somehow that thought never even crossed my mind.
---
I’m not a bot :(
---
It's really random. I definitely had my fair share of DC's. Multiple at Hydra/Sire/Cerb/Kraken.
---
But I feel like I see it more often on streamers rather than myself, I'd even see a streamer DC while I'm still able to play or vice versa.
---
Honestly, there just needs to be a constant connection or a connection buffer of some sorts to multiple servers. Because even if you did DC it would probably be a max of a couple of seconds(sure that's still a lot, but as long as you're spam clicking a teleport the buffer will register those actions[kind of the same way sicknerd is suddenly out of ToB after having a small DC])
---
Literally no reason to play HCIM especially if you're a streamer. People deserve to die if they're doing a boss and they aren't paying attention or they do dumb shit like afk run and get killed by a bear. 
---
However if you die to a SYSTEM FAILURE(aka something that is beyond your control) is fucking stupid. And for those people who say "OH BUT IT'S PART OF THE GAME!" Yea, ok and in CS:GO there are literally GAME BREAKING BUGS that majorly impact your chance of winning(bomb glitching through the map). Pretty dumb.
---
How the turntables
---
youd probobly need a pretty high strength level to smash a metal jug
---
No one mentioned that, by attempting to download 3rd party clients, the security chain has already been weakened irregardless of how strong your security measures already are

“The chain is only as strong as its weakest link” heard of this?

Don't think that's exactly accurate, since flinching *only* works if you attack the NPC. Other red clicks won't stop it from attacking you.
---
Sorry for the late response.  Chaos ele is over 1m/hr from dragon pickaxe drops.
---
&gt;Wow, this is so cool. I remember playing this 4 or 5 years ago or something
---
nci3
---
I did the same but forgot an axe I think 😓
---
coolio
---
Nice! I completed it on my iron in 126 but no axe or pet so I guess I didn’t quite finish! When did you get ax and pet?
---
Arks the same way, minus the love.
---
Axe 55 KC and Pet 227 KC
---
Pretty much exactly that. NPCs that get hit "flinch" for a tick when hit and then one tick after, and take 8 or 9 (iirc) ticks to 'reset' from their high-alert state. If you try to attack them again within this time they will retaliate instantly and not recoil.
---
Like I stated in a reply earlier I had my attention elsewhere, saw "b0aty" was "quitting" and had a link to why, which led to a fake runescape site which I just assumed were the forums for me to log into. I am no newbie to fake links and scams, like I said my attention was elsewhere, I mostly posted this to be informative. It's been up for more than an hour which is pretty ridiculous on Twitch's part.
