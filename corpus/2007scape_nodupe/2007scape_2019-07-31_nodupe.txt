Computer programs don't make mistakes. Programmers and users do. A bug is a mistake that isn't the fault of the user.

Great idea! I‚Äôve thought of some skills too! My idea is kingship, you buy ‚Äúland‚Äù and reign over it and have it produce recourses. I could go into deeper depth but I‚Äôm only taking a break from studying

Fake news nice try tho

Agree with this, I'd rather reword this question as "looking into MVP system as the problem" not just tick manipulation. MVP hoarding can be like 4-5m+ gp/hr ATM, which would look incredibly OP, but the rest of the team isn't getting anywhere nearrrr that.
---
ok?
---
Damn! Really good idea and amazing post,  Warding compared to this is nothing
---
We've done nothing but ask for high APM skilling content comparable to PvM content that yields good rewards for YEARS and now we're complaining that clicking a rock should be the actual go to method of getting rewards
---
Very down with this. Seems amazing. Give farming a little more content to help out the grind.
---
I fail to see the problem here
---
I was thinking it's a perfect spot for a bush patch or something like a belladonna that only has one patch in game ATM.

---
Hell, even another crystal related farming patch (doesn't have to be another tree(

A majority of people that voted no on the first question skipped the remaining answers or just said no because they said no to the first question and just wanted to say no all the way down. You may have been one of the hundred thousand that took the time to choose yes or no but I assure you that wasn't how many of the no voters did it.
---
I‚Äôve RWT easily 2bill + at this point (gambling problem :D) And never received a ban. A buddy of mine bought 20m and got banned lol
---
Because in Runescape sounds which for the most part players find annoying shouldn't provide an advantage.
---
Put side by side, the right one looks a lot closer lol especially to RS3's ancients rune. But i think if you change the helm on either people stop saying that.
---
Lmao at this point I think literally anybody other Jagex is more qualified than Jagex to design things for this game
---
you dont need to complete mountain daughter to get the head
---
well i saw him 3ting barb while doing zulrah on a dif post so I was fooled.
---
Nice.
---
New players don‚Äôt understand that this game exists because of RS3, and old players don‚Äôt realize this game will go nowhere and die with themselves at the wheel.

Oh wait really? Thank you so much!

nice.

Had Armadyl for awhile but it was crap so bought Karils üòÇ

He used to be Mod MatK. Now he is God MatK.

&gt; @PvPretender The updated code had a comment in it saying "regardless of whether it hit 0", which sounds extremely intentional, but I gather the devs who wrote it are changing it on Thursday to not do that.

Classic Jagex, useless company

Looks much better. Just hate having the massive shoulder guards. Feel a wonky and out of place.

&gt;if you went to Bandos or literally any other boss, those sweaty maxed kids would get the loot instead of you.

literally any other boss except the other skilling boss you mean

Or maybe several of those years were in school and he stayed logged in afking while doing homework every single day, as one does.

Within the first few days too. This dude better win a gnome for his 18 firecape video. He pushes the game just like swampman - to its purest limits

Happy cake day brother :)

Are you planning on unskull pking?

So I guess no one remembers 10 and 15 year vet capes.

I really dont like this
---
SoA is easy enough that you can make a new account and do it with yourself. It sucks, but it's a last resort.
---
As for Heroes Quest if you're in Phoenix Gang I'm pretty sure the only thing you need is to get the Pete's Candlestick, and I have like 10 of those in my bank for people who need it. Heroes Quest is definitely better designed, since you can help people once you've finished the quest.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúillegal‚Äù it‚Äôs just against jagex TOS and generally just results in a temp ban for first offenses. It‚Äôs also extremely rare that they actually catch it and act on it unless you‚Äôre doing it very frequently for very large amounts.
---
If the alternative is getting my account held ransom by jagex for hundreds of dollars, then I‚Äôll take that risk.
---
Why do you persist in acting like a child? Instead of coming up with an actual reason for your opinions you‚Äôve just replied aggressively. You have the emotional intelligence of an 8 year old

I feel like I'm starting to see a cycle going on here...

Jagex releases item --&gt; Jagex nerfs items after release --&gt; player posts, discussing gp loss from the nerf --&gt; op get lambasted by others saying you deserved it
---
True, but there's what, four clue steps around the Legends Guild? And charge dragonstone scrolls are 214gp each right now.
---
the nature of this game tends to attract the type of people who prefer..."rigidity" lmao. there is a large portion who don't want change or do want change but only if its perfect and all ramifications are known beforehand. as if the developers would just allow economy-breaking, game-ruining updates to go unchecked for any amount of time.

A human requires around 10 000 hours to master a skill.

He could be a sculptor, a painter, a musician and almost a black belt judoka with those hours.

Worlds are instances. Runescape has always had instances.

Dust devils are not, and were never aggro.

Yes clearly the difficulty of hopping worlds was nothing compared to the hours of temple trekking or catching lizards.

Has anyone received a ban from using a touchscreen computer? I was ban for macroing so I thought it had something to do with runelite so I quit using it and mostly play on mobile but will sometimes play on the pc. I have a mouse that I do some movements and clicking with but sometimes it‚Äôs more convenient to just touch the screen. I could understand why it would be deemed as such but I‚Äôd like to dispute it but on the webpage it links me too says I‚Äôm not able to??? Has anyone else had this issue?
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
Can i PM you my IGN so you can add me later tonight? I wanted to complete the heroes quest and i'm in the phoenix gang.

I would really appreciate it. Is the item tradeable after the quest is started or i need to be at a certain step to accept it?
---
These look awesome!

The ‚Äújust revert it cunt‚Äù had me dying lmfao

I haven't thought that far yet, I will be getting prayer, but I was thinking of stopping at 13 for the time being. If I do id just bring 50k in gp plus an emblem

yeah I do. Autocorrecct is a cruel bitch.

If you got banned for buying GP from Gold Farmers these websites would not have any customers. Jagex has said before, publically, that they do not care about buyers - only sellers.

The main thing to help survival is wearing full justicar+ely while barraging the littel bastards every wave.

I'd also propose that all weapon armor drops come broken. You have to use a bar of that metal/wood to repair for some smithing xp

Damn, it's all so clear now, we should've seen it coming

I personally dont but if someone fucked up the burger and some guy was like just gimme a new one cunt it wouldn't come across as that rude to me.

Pathetic

"Some rando on the internet called a woman a cunt, fucking incels!" -actual incels

It's not real. Listen to his clicks.

This is tagged as "humour" because Mod Matt is actually super average at the game. It's a joke...

By incorrect code, do you mean code that was meant to do something, but straight uo didn't actually work? Or code put in weird places?
---
man I really don‚Äôt want to have to dress up in that crystal meth clown suit though lmao

don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted as this is the truth. absolute positioning is a thing and mouse drift is too.

Holy shit it works so perfectly.

wow went to complete shit after cata honestly, i played it for 9-10 years. probably never going back. osrs is superior in almost every way.

This is the most Reddit post ever made.

A Friend maxed an account in RS3 in 24hrs in-game time using exp lamp purchases.

I don't even think there are stamina pots in rs3 but run energy drains much slower in rs3, plus there's an ability that shoots you forward like 8 tiles on a 20 or so second cooldown.

Looks like a sash.

I prefer this style rather than just clips of him saying. Hey guys we just hit lvl 60 hunter, hey guys we just hit lvl 70 hunter, hey guys we hit 80 hunter.

Okay sure, but I'm looking to "collect" a free world at dust devils, bosses etc. I don't really see a solution to that other than removing hop limit, unless we want literally everything instanced

Screw a poh pet sanctuary i want a poz.  A Player Owned Zoo!!

&gt;Then there would be no purpose to ddos for people's stuff

I mean they'd almost definitely lose it so there's the reason. Some people are just dicks so we don't get to have nice things.

It‚Äôs fantastic. Stop watching if you don‚Äôt like it. Same as I don‚Äôt watch videos I don‚Äôt like that other people do.
---
he goes above and beyond the 10min mark tho
---
Idk i think that worked at the start Bc it was shorter grinds and more varied content 
---
Now it‚Äôs do this for X hours and only then do this for another X hours and so on
---
Dude fuck ur dungeoneering. That crop of players that want dungeoneering and summoning are the ones that made runescape into the shithole that is rs3. And then oh nooo, eoc, oh no, game bad. While half of the game base was decimated.

I thought steam just removed the game you played for

Because the designers love having a project that they can show off their skills with, so they try to 'improve' or add as much as possible into an update

They should really embrace that less is more sometimes, especially in an oldschool setting

I meant mithril armor is low, cause it's mithril. But instead of making the worse items more expensive/worse, why not make the more expensive items better. I bet more people would use prims if they didn't only have 1 str bonus over d boots.

Lmao u call people out on being a virgin yet you act like the biggest white knight. And usually the white knights are the real virgins.

For one, Jagex doesn't collect your overdraft fee, your bank does for providing you overdraft protection. Secondly, Jagex always provides you a refund for unused membership, as they always have for me. Usually, if you can get that refund, the overdraft charge would be reversed. You could also ask your bank if they could waive the charge this time.
---
You made plans to update World 30 house parties by adding Billboards which advertise the current POH hosts. But I know for a fact that this will not stop hosts from spamming their house using alts with auto-typers.   
---
Do you plan to stop this spam problem and force players to strictly use the advertisement board?   
---
Could you maybe include some sort of a script which automatically boots or reports players that spam type the same message(s) for longer than 2-3 minutes within a certain set of squares of House Portals?    
---
The spam is absolutely terrible and makes chatting as you go in and out of houses a miserable experience. 
---
   
---
Also evil-doers often stand under other players using the altar inside a house party and spam nasty things to the host and the guests because the host cannot find them in the right-click menu to kick them (because there's too many people). Could you please add a list in settings which allows you to see all the guests in your house to enable you to kick them without having to find them or chase them down within your house?

Great idea. Can't wait to for the community to vote no when it gets polled.

ye! fuck the people who care about the game! they are loser neckbeards yeah!!
---
I've had payment/refund disputes in the past and my bank had told me to let them know asap and they deal with it every time. You shouldn't have to go back and forth being the middle man

Smaller gems and current model not new lines and giant fucking rocks how hard is it

This is much better than the current, I'd vote in a heartbeat

Ill fuck the shut up

Tbh never knew there was one, ive hopped dozens of worlds at a time looking for a free spot at sand crabs

It's good for cannoning while meleeing

Wow less than a week after release... that is some pro gamer move right there !!

Nice

Its really not, its always better to use a b ring
---
Bruh moment
---
*sips tea*
---
Ok bro where did my triangle tits go
---
It would use the salve ammy boost, but since spectres need a nosepeg or Slayer helm, using the Slayer helm and your best ammy would give more dps then Slayer helm and salve ammy ei.
---
It‚Äôs surprising that‚Äôs there‚Äôs a huge discrepancy in the claimed refund amount by Jagex and the claimed amount received by Chase. 
---
Chances are this is a Jagex or user error.
---
We heard you like clients so we added runelite to your steam so you can launch a client through another client to play a java applet üçé
---
Jagexs terms and conditions for membership does state that its usually billed around 3 days prior to the end of your running membership.. Sorry you got stung.
---
He's ashamed of it, so others must be as well.
---
I voted against warding, but I would vote yes for this.
---
Open your eyes fool. Mod Matt brought the game into existence using only 5% of his power, I think he can handle bossing and Skilling at the same time.
---
ill be on in about an hour. Will you be online?
---
Your "only" conclusion is dumb.
---
This guy probably walks upto, and starts pissing in the same single urinal as someone else with his pants around his ankles. absolute chad.

Pretty gay ngl
---
Jagex COST me the overdraft fee. Jagex OWES me for it.
---
The excuses everyone gives Jamflex to justify these attempts at sneaking in updates makes me sad.  
---
It's \*really really\* hard to create things in code by accident without it being fundamentally broken.(odd characters/capitalization etc etc)  
---
Understanding coding/computer language or java would show this is unlikely to be accidental. It is astronomical for 'just a bug' to modify a name to something that has been in game from launch to something that has NEVER appeared in game, to despawn an entirely unrelated mod (except for the area occupied) AND then also reach out to the 'rules' of the cave and un-aggro everything.  
---
1, maybe 2 of these I'd write off but not all 3 combined with the rest of this update. Not a chance.
---
Goodluck
---
You claimed several times that people who like warding are dumb and that warding would literally destroy the game. Do you even believe yourself? The irony here is unreal.
---
cause it is easier/less time to lie and just say it was an 'accident'
---
ok i think you are pretty naive to how in depth and sophisticated speed ba metas are on a team level and individual level to get a record. you can get 12-13 minutes as a casual ba'er but 10 minutes is on a whole other level.
---
Duno bout you but i wouldnt set up payments like rs from my acc with all my money in it. Rather transfer money from that account to a spendings acc to bill from.
---
Bullshit
---
What are the numbers at 99 then? Because you've only made a case basis that shows almost identical stats. You won't even see a difference on his current account until you've drug it out 100 seconds, at which point he could have done 4 more damage. And no, it shouldn't be a lot of money. That doesn't mean it isn't.
---
Try infernal eels, inventory fills much slower. Spot rarely moves, no need to bank
---
Curropted is extremely hard for the loot it gives. Doing prep is reasonable, but the boss is extremely punishing. You can't make very many mistakes if you want to make it through and it is very easy to mess up. They just need to buff the loot in general tbh. 
---
That said, I have been having a blast doing curropted gauntlets. I am up to 4 kc after many hours of attempts. I don't even care that it has been terrible loot.
---
That bank email looks sketchy as ****. As for the jagex one that looks legit.
---
this man is a monster at gaming
---
It also cost like 13 grand... so
---
Are you serious? There‚Äôs like 100k + votes in the warding poll, you‚Äôd need to own ~12,000 to swing it, there isn‚Äôt enough time to log in and vote on all of them even if you put the money aside.
---
This idea has so much potential, especially with creating minigames that go with it
---
Depends on the gear you have to go with each obviously. Enter the rest of your gear into [the dps calculator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64wtan/dps_calculator_by_bitterkoekje/?st=jyqlg3e8&amp;sh=992c7535)

 [https://imgur.com/a/jN0Czw3](https://imgur.com/a/jN0Czw3) the difference at 99 is .11 but vorkath isn't the only place you'll use a b ring. You'd use it for basically any melee combat. I find it funny that you're saying 8 strength bonus isn't worth 2.9m when it's arguably the best upgrade to melee for the price in the entire game. tassets are 2 strength bonus for like 30m.
---
Perhaps the secrets to the sponge/ abyssal realm can be studied by its impact in our realm- our skies, our methods of teleportation, fluctuations :O
---
Basically there's so many different way to scam in duel arena, just stay away. Some of the more known ones have an easy counter, but the scammer is expecting that, so they turn some other option on.
---
One popular scam is that the scammer with much lower levels gives you a maple shortbow and rune arrows, but maple shortbow can only use up to adamant arrows. So you try to anti-scam by taking adamant arrows into duel. Alas, the scammer has disabled two-handed weapons, so you can't use your bow at all while the scammer shreds you with dragon knives.
---
Are you an idiot? People can laugh at stupid shit others say and still not do it or condone it themselves.
---
Ey, I am watching that game as I do agility in Priff. üëåüèª
---
If you hit something 100 times with a BGS yes it evens out. However if I‚Äôm only unleashing 2 spec hits and relying on those 2 hits to land to make my boss fight significantly easier the w ring is the right choice. If he was meleeing the dragon, swapping to b ring after throwing the specs would be the right choice. His setup is correct.
---
Imo you should just try to do the things you know. Ironman is about not needing anyone and doing it yourself.
---
Hope you struck up a convo with him lol.

No I was just saying that this would be similar to telos loot mechanics. No issue with it

Possibly, hopefully it arrives man.

Just take solace in the fact that you were never going to make it as a HCIM anyway
---
I am busy as it is but if I can spare a couple hours I play. You‚Äôll achieve your goals slowly but it‚Äôs really just a great game to play all at once or slowly over time. I used to play all day, every day but I actually started liking it more and more after I stepped away from it. You could always do Ironman mode where you basically do everything yourself. My best mate did that when he came back and he loves it.

Honestly yeah, if I got dicked on that easily there was never a chance

omfg, incredible.

Lol if you have all the prereqs done sure. Id love to see you speedrun RFD from a fresh account in a day.

Would love to see this as an actual skill. +rep

F.

Switch it to a normal account

Even though it is a cool concept, do you really think the community will agree on this?..We will probably have a few big youtube stars who "proclaim" they are the voice of osrs, and completely dismantle your hard work of putting together this nice concept, just because they dont see an immediate pay-off..üôÑ. The one thing I hate about in osrs are the smucks who hate the idea of good "reasonable" change for the vast majority of the player base...and not just the 1%..üòí

Yea its bs, the crystal helm also degrades on splashes.  I thought id have a useful item for zulrah but instead its a steaming pile of trash.

Yeah maybe because he plays runescape as his fulltime job lmao

This is fucking awesome.

It definitely fits, but there is no use/need for it currently and so it would work perfectly in unison as a ranching skill that requires hunter levels.

Why fletch?

You mean in under 24 hrs. And those are people who set everything up, had the quests committed to memory, did everything in a particular order, etc. It takes the average player much long than a day for bgloved

Depends on your stat distribution and the other gear you're wearing and the bosses you use. Check the dps calculator for your personal numbers.
---
Ancestral is the way to go gear wise.
---
Not trying to be mean like some of the others, but your rebill date is not the date jagex charges your card for subscriptions. They do it when you have a couple days left of membership. It‚Äôs in the TOS and credit card agreement. Sorry you are in this predicament

How'd you even get 22mil for them when regen braclet is a thing

I'll admit I spent some money to help max rs3. I bought into a few promos and cut out a big chunk of the late game grind, it's actually quite reasonable at high levels where you get decent amounts of exp or bonus exp.
---
But honestly it kind of felt hollow when I was done and got really bored really quick after. Which is why I play osrs now. Not particularly pround but it terms of money spent vs time saved it's not as ridiculous as it seems.
---
Depends on where you place value in results vs the journey. I thought I just wanted the results but learnt that they dont really mean anything if you just cheat it.
---
blessed sara sword has higher stats than bludgeon too
---
Shhh no, balance and compromise is extremist. Ignorance is strength. Caring is bad. Never anything except everything ironically. I have extreme IQ.
---
Ironman Mode?! That sounds interesting. I'll look into it.
---
Agility is the best skill in this game, my first and only 99.
---
It's not afk, but it's like 1 click every five seconds, not click intensive like blast furnace or runecrafting.
---
I forgot i left subs on and when i went to turn them off i saw this
---
I've been playing on an ironman account since 2015 and I still haven't caught a single dragon imp.
---
Underrated content
---
fyi for efficiency training str higher than atk will get you to 99 melees quicker than keeping them balanced
---
There could be a reason. More pets or POH creatures, honestly idk but you would think.. hunting would go much more hand in hand with capturing.. Currently Hunter doesn't do crap for me. It's level 1 until I have to get it leveled for questing. Other than that. I don't need it.

There was not a single mention of the cost, and they weren't arguing whether the warrior ring was useful, they were arguing about whether or not the berserker ring or warrior ring was better in certain scenarios.
---
I weighed in saying berserker ring vs warrior ring is a dead horse on this subreddit.  If you actually cared about this person you could look up the maths yourself, but you seem to just be looking to add dynamics to a simple discussion for the sake of 'winning' it.
---
Doesn't feel old school.
---
I trust Chase banking FAR MORE than I trust the shit show that is Jagex. This is yet another reason RWT is 'better'. If you're going to risk your account being banned may aswell get the most out of it.

Cries in UIM.

Better than discount rs3 imo

30M for 8 str bonus on an alt if the item wasnt nerfed isnt really that bad of a deal. A lot of endgame players have plenty of gp, the issue is they decided to nerf the item unannounced on the website and only on twitter. Not sure why OP is getting all this hate, I agree with him lol

Does it have to look like rune? Why not something completely different?

I'm up to 48k rn. Saw a post that its around 300k from 90-99 so maybe another 350k to go. Should be out of that pit in a couple months.
---
I can‚Äôt check atm. Is the plug in just called inventory tags
---
I honestly wish I could give you something for actually explaining your position on it. 
---
But on things like farming sharks/d bones, I get that doing that itself becomes less profitable, but imo that‚Äôs fine for the game, it allows players who don‚Äôt want to do those activity‚Äôs better(cheaper) access to them.
---
But again thank you for actually replying.
---
Yeah but this doesn't work with game devs because they can freeze the accounts you have with them.
---
Check the wiki my dude. Konar confirms it

His mammoth dick grabs the mouse to pick up the loot

so tree runs = getting better at 3t and zulrah got it tree runs here i come!
---
They mentioned Pestilent Bloat before, its not runnings its teleporting
---
Hey man, I just wanted to follow up and say I started doing t1 rushing and my runs are so much smoother. I rarely run out of food during the boss fight, so not having to get extra resources for t2 saved me a solid 2 minutes or so. I can typically enter the boss room with 2-3 minutes to spare now, and almost always have two t3 weapons.
---
&gt;This is literally the realization I had two years ago. Never made a better decision to focus on my business and not grinding.
---
Surviving in life is essential, almost like how an Ironman plays but you don't sit on a chair all day and smell like ballsack.
---
The Gauntlet is a fun challenge. However, the rewards - especially the crystal armour seeds feel extremely underwhelming for the time you need to invest to complete a set vs. the usefulness of it. Currently it is estimated to be an average of 200 hours of the regular gauntlet to achieve the set *if lucky*, can we see the drop rate to be much more common?
---
I miss all the old models man
---
Could you provide a link or something to when they have?
---
Except that's not what happened here, Chase told him to deal with Jagex himself.
---
Disagree. 
---
1. RWT feeds bot farms

2. Bots don‚Äôt hack and clean people‚Äôs accounts for money. RWTers do.

That‚Äôs a really good idea.

Ight so if I hit 600 kills I should just quit lmao
---
Either that or he uses his feet... In that case... SHOW FEET
---
Whats the exp rate at 92-99 doing just master farmer?
---
‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there any outrage‚Äù...???? You must not look at the sub often.
---
Considering doing it the legit way will apparently get you literally scammed by jagex, idk lmao
---
it used to be you upvote the first nice, then downvote the second nice, then upvote the third nice, downvote the fourth nice, etc. Now it seems everybody upvoting all the nice's. smh jagflux keeps changing everything, even our subreddit
---
Those are the people who are having fun
---
I wish so bad I had been there from the start. I joined when Wintertodt was released lol
---
Me too, Reddit‚Äôs Reddit though
---
Your comment served no purpose. Read the rest of the post you Neanderthal.
---
Do you think the hop limit exists to limit Ironmen buying from shops? I'm not sure I understand your comment.
---
Art direction of OSRS has been brought up millions of times before this lol what are you talking about.
---
I think the addition of alchables/resources on the drop tables of new bosses is due to the need of giving them incentive while not adding new powercreep equipment into the game.
---
Think about it, Jagex wants to add new bosses but are barred by the community from adding any new tier of uniques that show to be more than barely noticeably better than the existing equipment under the concern of ‚Äúpowercreep‚Äù. For this reason Jagex are only left with the option of making uniques that fill niche gaps in existing equipment/functions.
---
There is a reason these items are called niche, being because they fill a lesser, undermet purpose that the existing uniques have missed. For this reason they are bound the be less stable in maintaining a respectable enough price to be deemed incentive enough alone for a new bosses reward table.
---
So what is to be done? Well Jagex won‚Äôt simply add a boss that they know will be dead content on arrival or in a short to come time. They need to add some incentive to doing the boss, hence a lasting source of incentive being alchables/resources, probably in a spectrum they‚Äôve calculated to be sustainable for the economy for the duration of game‚Äôs life.
---
In conclusion, would I say your statement has a point of truth in it? Yes, and it is true that the addition of alchables and liquid-able resources in drop tables is to compensate for an inability to provide enticing enough uniques. But it‚Äôs a realistic limitation of the game that Jagex can‚Äôt just snap their fingers to fix. Theres only so much unique content that can be added before triggering the powercreep response. While alchables/resources are a double-edged blade to other areas of the game, the question to be considered is **to how much of a degree?** What arguments do you have to back that the amount of alchs/resources coming in via bossing drop tables is **too much**, and not just a not bad enough amount. 
---
And as for taking away from the incentive for skilling, I‚Äôm sure it can be argued that player statistics show in favor for activities containing combat rather than skilling. In which case it would only be logical to assume that Jagex may very well prioritize those preferred subjects before the lesser when it comes to securing their foundations. Not that they would completely neglect one side, but I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised to see that they make implications for one that hinder another.
---
Someone explain? Im dumb as shit
---
Been playing since 2003 and got banned while doing demonic gorillas. I'm saying there's no offence
---
i appreciate the effort but they added this to RS3 and it is not fun content at all
---
Shit wrong subreddit thought we were playing thought this was r/thesims
---
\&gt;Who cares if they don't like it? She fucked up bad and getting insulted for it is to be expected.
---
Or they could give her constructive criticism like the first guy? Insulting someone isn't going to help them fix whatever caused them to make that mistake in the first place.
---
Entitled end users are a big reason why I stopped writing public bot scripts and switched to goldfarming when I was still involved with the botting scene.
---
No, I think it exists to limit bots buying from shops.
---
I‚Äôm in no way concerned about what ironmen do, their way of playing the game doesn‚Äôt have any effect on anything but themselves. Bots on the other hand can buy items from shops for below GE value and then turn around and sell it on the GE for a good profit. I‚Äôve made a decent amount of money doing it manually, so I can only imagine what a bot farm could do.

I don't recall MTX in the ones I am thinking of, but perhaps there was. I think the first I saw was the [Pre-GWD2 Event](https://runescape.wiki/w/Heart_of_Gielinor:_Encampment). Seems that was 100 Tools per day but additional from TH or Loyalty Points, so kinda MTX. Then you just AFKed at statues or whatever they were for exp in specific skills with a personal and community goal. Aside from exp rewards, it also gave a free T75 Arm Cannon (Crossbows). But yah, while the community busy work aspect of those events can be nice and others like the beach can be fun festivals, I think I got like 2M Bonus Slayer Exp built up just from the free daily keys and other events and the sad part is that isn't even that crazy of a thing.
---
Im not sure about the green dot, but most 3rd party clients highlight their name even if they're appearing off

tbh quests fucking suck

And it took like 2 years didnt it
---
 Not worth too much (250k) but 1st time I've ever seen 4 unique items in one clue + the master clue to boot! I've been trying to fill out the  collection log and all 4 of these items were new to me, which is amazing
---
I recommend a nice pairing of "mango" to bring out the citrus notes in the dew. Puff your vape and let it sit in your mouth, then swirl the dew around with the vape so you can get a nice coverage on your taste buds.
---
Alternatively, if you're a man of class get your trusty mech mod out and drip that sweet sweet unicorn milk on your .3 ohm 24ga dual parallel coils. Paint the juice on your fresh wicks, blow the coils with the top off a few times before taking the first hit, and follow the previous instructions for maximum flavor and the most favorable mouth fedora experience. Pairs excellently with a thin neckbeard.
---
Of course if you were a man of class you knew all of that already.
---
What the Pmod said is pretty reasonable, if he came every time someone told him x was breaking a rule people would quickly start trolling him by making up supposed world locations just to make him run out there.
---
Pmods are players just like you, they don't get anything for doing it. It's not their sole job to hop around looking for rule breakers.
---
R/im14andthisisdeep
---
God i wish i had time to play rs as much as you guys
---
I got one on my zerker at like less than 20kc
---
The MVP system needs a huge nerf and ideally removal. That way loot can be actually balanced rather than the potential for one guy to make like 6m/hr while everyone else is making trash.
---
If they just nerf the loot the thing will die off, as it's only mvp's that are getting good gp/hr
---
Legalize ranch.
---
ah okay thank you i have no problem with being proven wrong. would be cool though if each room had its own track tho
---
I forget what it's called but theres also a subreddit for this which couldn't hurt to post in. Im sure you can find it on google within a few minutes
---
That makes it even cooler imo
---
It did but I know this wouldnt pass a 75% poll either lol. People would just say the same shit as with Warding: ‚Äûdoesnt feel old school‚Äú ‚ÄûI dont like the skill‚Äú ‚Äûshould be part of hunter and farming no need for new skill‚Äú etc.
---
It's a grandmaster quest that unlocks end game content, it should be the best gp/hr in its respective area. It's high attention mining, it should beat just spamming rune rocks.
---
It doesn't compete with vorkath under normal situations even closely, it's simply the MVP abuse that's happening that is making it look so good. Remove MVP and add proper loot scaling personally and the boss would be better off for everyone putting effort in and would reward higher mining levels and better accuracy / high effort tick manipulating without screwing over 90% of people doing so that one guy makes 6m+ gp/hr
---
I know it's not MatK doing it but that's kinda impressive imo. I can't even do Zulrah let alone trying to do something else ahah
---
Cause they hire dogshit customer support employees, the one I had to deal with was fired around this time last year.  Pretty much why I dropped the whole thing, felt that was better than $60
---
4 blood barrages are a prayer pot, you may want to reconsider this tactic if you are blood barraging often and think you are saving money on prayer potions.
---
It is kinda crazy how quick you did this. Not just the quest, but getting the video together too; editing can take a lot of time, especially for 33 Min videos.

Only read the first two sentences but this was a good laugh

Big tits more taxes loool
---
How about recovery is pray cape emote wings so you can have a useful recovery aswell as a emote.
---
Love the idea!
---
It's only high gp/hr when your hoarding MVP rolls which is the problem with the boss. You just hop world's until youre the only maxed guy doing tick manipulation and hey presto 5m/hr. Remove that mechanic and the boss is sitting at a much more normal 3m/hr.
---
No, this is patrick
---
This actually pretty cool, it a revamped way of summoning and the fact that it incorporates more then one skill feels like it would bring more content for those who are skillers. I would back this up 100% all the way! Great idea man!
---
Why are you so fucking smart
---
You... Train the skill in order to do the skilling boss more effectively. It's the reward for doing it. A guy with 50 mining but maxed combats can't even do this boss..
---
Look we found him dismembered in a garbage bag in the forest with 2 gunshot wounds to the back of the head. Obviously he just couldn't take the burden of life.
---
i'm not talking in definite's, i stated a position that players will be filtered out over time as things are altered to a point they no longer enjoy the whole.
---
i didn't say things like, rs3 playercount is dead, or certain updates killed it. instead i spoke more broadly about change overtime.
---
i also didn't say additions to the game are inherently good or bad - only that time should be taken to ensure a vast majority agree with it, to avoid a filtering effect and ensure a longer lifespan. 
---
rs3 playercount is relatively stable yet continually declining, which includes factors probably outside of my position. 
---
also your position that warding failed due to cultural influence is moot and unverifiable, if the cultural reaction to warding was to vote no - then the reality is the parts community voted no. I'm not commenting on the culture of the community, but acknowledge that what ever portion is represented in the voting aspect is ever-changing. pinning down a group within a community and labelling them in this context is stupid and beside the point.

There's definitely a placement style system as if you 2 or 3 man it you pretty much never see those terrible drops. You can definitely get a good drop and get a poor roll of it, or vice versa, an average drop with a good roll.
---
I really don't see why they overcomplicate this. It's a loot table on a group boss where everyone gets a loot roll. Just make the weighting of the drops based on a scale from invisible (or visible) points you earn from doing activities, with damage to Zalcano as the most valuable one (then shield, golem, dodging damage etc.)
---
The better you do, the more points you earn, the better loot potential you have for more significant drops and more of those drops. And you are weighted for the chance of getting the unique if it drops or the pet. Still rewards people doing more, without punishing someone for falling slightly behind, not being max mining, being an iron with rune pickaxe, or not tick manipulating etc.
---
Lmaooo I absolutely love this shit. I hope we get to see more of Mat's mad skills.
---
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, this game produces socially stunted individuals. 
---
Let‚Äôs be real. Many of us cling to childhood nostalgia for a 20 year old game. You really think the majority of us really grew up? I‚Äôve seen more arrested development in this game than on the show Arrested Development.

Yeah it's pretty fucked, you see fresh rs3 ironmen at those events with 1 in every stat but 90 construction or prayer or ironmen waiting months for it so they can get their construction up without having to do anything
---
Calling a woman who dedicated her life to hospice care for the dregs of Indian society "a horrible sadist that fetishized death and suffering" is an incredibly bold character attack that goes far beyond reasonable evaluation of her methods and mission. Yes she was a complex individual, certainly far from perfect, and reasonable criticisms of her work are of course never something to be shied away from, but such a lazy attack deserves a lazy response. Regardless, I can say with full certainty that someone who spends significant time playing runescape and browsing reddit while shitting on Mother Teresa's legacy has spent a fraction, if any, of the amount of time that she spent on helping the poorest of the poor. That's not excessive or mean, that's the truth. If op is the one in a million charity worker that lives in the slums of his city and happens to play runescape casually on mobile while serving soup, I will humbly recant every word I said. Not holding my breath on that one though. 
---
As far as the attack on his understanding of her theology of suffering, I go back to the fact that he characterized her as "a horrible sadist that fetishized death and suffering". This is nonsense, and he's really talking beyond his knowledge. Even assuming he did know what he was talking about and wanted to critique her suffering theology through his own observations, there's a complete and utter lack of nuance that would indicate his deeper understanding. 
---
All in all, lazy, simplistic and stupid comments deserve equally lazy, simplistic, and stupid responses.

Because chat heads can be endured/ignored while doing a quest, but anyone who wants to get the prestige, challenge, or rewards of the gauntlet needs to engage with it. If the mechanics aren't enjoyable then that's just going against good game design.

It's taboo to be a GOP conservative, and since that's mostly what people on reddit know, it extends to all conservatism. Hell my entire family would be considered suuper left by US standards, yet my dad is economically conservative (I think it was that, might have forgotten) but he'd be considered 'lib scum' or whatever ppl use now because it's not the toxic brand of conservatism that a lot of people in the US subscribe to. So you *can* hold conservative views, the only problem is conservatism in the US (and a fair few other places too I'd imagine) has become essentially synonymous with racist or other bigoted views.

yes thats one player dude, not a refelction at all of the generally commuity

I could write a book on this subject, as it's (as you said) complex. The passage of time has only hurt Mother Teresa's reputation, and in my opinion.. for good reason. I'm not going to sit here and argue this with you since it's clear we have very different perspectives. Have a good night

I had to go through the same bullshit for Heroes quest but since I was a Pheonix gang member and the CC was full of Black Arm gang members that day Brimhaven looked liked a Brazzers shoot with me being surrounded by Black Knights waiting to grab their candlesticks.

I guess the moral of the story is that it's okay to wait and join the CC some other day so you can get gangbanged by Black Arm members.
---
Thanks for the explanation! I honestly thought it was more useful than it is especially since it outperformed the leaf bladed baxe but I now see where it fits. Its just a shame, I should have sold it last week haha.

---
Honestly RWT needs to be taken off the rules list since Jagex can't handle selling gold themselves. They've spent 20 years trying to get rid of gold sellers yet they're still around spamming the chat, so why bother? 
---
Let players find out which sites sell legit gold and do some business. If they get scammed and Jagex is so worried about players getting mad and quitting over it, big whoop because Jagex scams their players, too.

People sold every valuable thing in Ultima Online for years and not a damn thing was done about it. I know people who essentially survived off of selling castles they stole from other people. Guess how many noteworthy issues it caused for UO? None. Zero zip.

Honestly so many people!! I can‚Äôt ever do revs man

Protip: You don't need a crystal pick if you're 1.5 ticking. You do need a crystal pick to compete with tick manipulators when mining the boss normally, though. Explains the price.

I like the idea of a new raids in the desert and the ideas of nex. But I feel a lot of people dont really want BIS PvP items to come from high end PvM. But other than that I'm a fan.
---
Lmao how

Hey, if you got a mistaken false botting temp ban that Jagex overturned on appeal, does it still count as a strike?
---
Worried I'm at risk of having my main unexpectedly permanuked if the same thing happens again someday. :(
---
I will say that they usually don't give a warning ban if you're using an actual botting program. All the 2 week bans I can remember have been for autoclickers or something similar.
---
UNPLAYABLE.
---
I mean hey I would love an osrs version of that
---
Idk about effort but at least Rendi's take more thought. This probably took less time / effort than the video where Settled got the Whip but it was certainly more complicated. 
---
I voted the same way. Settled best channel, Rendi best video.
---
What website is best?
---
Not really though, his account will get unlocked, if he was caught RWT it would be banned.

Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c (Vietnamese: [t ∞«êkÃü k ∑√¢Àê≈ã …ó…®Ãåk] (About this soundlisten); 1897 ‚Äì 11 June 1963; born L√¢m VƒÉn T√∫c) was a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who burned himself to death at a busy Saigon road intersection on 11 June 1963.[2] Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. Photographs of his self-immolation were circulated widely across the world and brought attention to the policies of the Di·ªám government. John F. Kennedy said in reference to a photograph of ƒê·ª©c on fire, "No news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one."[3] Malcolm Browne won a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph of the monk's death.[4][5]
---
Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c's act increased international pressure on Di·ªám and led him to announce reforms with the intention of mollifying the Buddhists. However, the promised reforms were not implemented, leading to a deterioration in the dispute. With protests continuing, the ARVN Special Forces loyal to Di·ªám's brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, launched nationwide raids on Buddhist pagodas, seizing Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c's heart and causing deaths and widespread damage. Several Buddhist monks followed Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c's example, also immolating themselves. Eventually, a U.S.-backed Army coup toppled Di·ªám, who was assassinated on 2 November 1963.

RS3 player owned farm made into a skill, literally why sailing didnt pass

No gearswitch, no problem.
---
uh wow bfa is dead as fuck, and those other games don't release player count lmao. so you don't even know. ffxiv, eso, and wow, those are the only ones i would ever consider as top 3 but osrs is really not far behind.
---
wow is a fucking garbage game, i came here from 9-10 years of playing it. even classic really won't revive it because vanilla is god awful. when they release tbc/wotlk legacy servers it might start going good again but till then ..yea.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this has been posted before, it sure has somewhere.

Would it be possible for ironmans to hava their own shops seperated from everyone else? In my opinion this fits the ironman genre in a more natural way. If anyone know the answer already, please let me know :)
---
Probs because your ips are linked

Luckily we have mature and intelligent people like OP to raise the bar
---
God you're dumb
---
eez nutz haha gotem, 420xblazeityolo
---
Same, bought some keys during the good promos towards the end. Maxed and dipped, but now at least I have the feeling that I'm done with rs3 and have no desire to go back. Before, whenever I tried osrs I felt a nagging sensation that I should be getting maxed on rs3 first, and couldn't enjoy either game.
---
"why isn't there any outrage..." look at you Mr 8004 to try collect karma on the topic.
---
Except they're not just random subreddits, she was a catholic nun so you posting there is definitely relevant and gives context to why you would defend her and her views.
---
&gt;From a practical standpoint, either suffering has meaning and can be harnessed for good by growing closer to God, or there's no meaning to anything and your suffering is merely a construct of your neurons firing.
---
There's just so much wrong with this way of thinking. First of all, why would those be the only two options? So even if God was real, but our suffering could NOT be used to get closer to him, then there's still no meaning to life?  Second, how would "getting closer" to him somehow give meaning to our suffering? I would argue that suffering at the behest of a higher being would give our lives "less" meaning. 
---
Also how is this a practical standpoint?? Are you still talking about Mother Theresa? Because foregoing modern medicine that actually works in hopes of getting closer to some vague concept of a higher being you read about in a book sounds like literally the opposite of a practical move.
---
This isn't 2005.  Why are people like you always criticizing others when you're the one stuck in the past?  Last I remembered, the internet was a genuinely dark and dangerous place due to how little went into managing it even compared to now.  Especially now that a lot of the dark humor has moved into unironic territory.  It's concerning.
---
Sometimes it's just that they've done the quests too many times and are too poobrained to blame that instead of the quest itself.
---
What‚Äôs blackjacking on rs?? I don‚Äôt get it
---
Not how it works bud.
---
The only time I used one back in like 2012 (I was 12 ok?) They didn't pay me in the allotted 30 minute window, and when I got to customer service they have me a free 5 mil or something around that for my troubles. Always left a weird taste in my mouth lol
---
Ok give me your login info and i fix cape. I can also trim your rune too

If you have access to mm2 tunnels it might cost you around 40-45 chinning to 99 is fast af

For making to 99 don‚Äôt barrage just blitz

Barraging adds 33% more xp but costs double per hour
---
What i am trying to say is if you have your opinion, then cast that vote and stop trying to talk shit about people to vote NO. 
---
So for example, i say i dont want warsing because it seems very grindy to my liking. I would expect people to respect my decision and move on. Then i get people who downvote me, ask me to reconsider playing rs if i dont like grindy stuff, tells me there are already tons of pvm content so cant i just give skillers a new skill etc. 
---
If you people wants that skill so badly, then remove the poll and just implement it. You people want democracy but bitch about it when things doesnt go your way.
---
Hell yeah. Makes it so much easier and less headache inducing to do things like charters or chest thieving
---
Its a joke post boi.
---
It's not political. At least not in the UK where Jagex is based.
---
Also pretty sad that loving who you want to love, even if it's the same gender, is "political".
---
Ha.
---
how're we going to rock Zammyboy's world though? I'm emotionally invested at this point, and you've committed to the trifecta, so let's not waste each others' time
---
Well yea if you like an update there's not really a reason to go out of your way to vocalize it. But the only way to get change if you dislike it is by voicing your opinion. Obviously some people go overboard but still.
---
&gt; Based on going through various clan chats and many streams on twitch, I get the feeling that much of the rest of the community is split 50/50, or even leaning towards no. It's also important to consider that reddit is very pro-warding, and our results are not a landslide.
---
from top post
---
from my response above yours
---
&gt; The reddit poll is sitting at 71% with a margin of error of 1.36% (3 stdev) The twitter poll is sitting at 54% with a margin of error of 1.94% I saw a streamer's poll sit at 45% with a margin of error of 10.88%
---
LMAO. I know this is so long after I posted this (I didn't come on since then) but I really had to take a moment to ask if you actually read anything because this is going to blow your mind, get ready: **I ACKNOWLEDGED AND TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS**
---
You also ignored the part where I implied that even just based on reddit's responses, it probably wouldn't pass. You just missed literally everything dude.
---
Impressive yes but not very healthy in my opinion.
---
Hahaha I have a similar sticker on my car.
---
So glad that he didn't abandon RS after leaving jagex. Cherish this guy!
---
Because anything associated with rs3 is and and apparently means EoC is coming. Keep in mind one of the first polls failed because people thought armadyl crossbow was too rs3, and the next poll passed because they were "adding a gwd crossbow better then rune crossbow that's in the theme of armadyl".
---
Cambridge, Ohio?
---
Wave tickets are something about it. If the game were more popular, it would be easy to pick up extras. Short of rebalancing the game for X players, I don't think much can be done. I also done think it should be rebalanced because those resources would be better used elsewhere.
---
Could the dragonstone armor's appearance be drastically altered to either be somewhat in line with rune armor as we know it or distance itself from it fully? Its current design lands itself in a wierd position where the colors say "runite" but the design says "not", cutting it short of being to rune as robes of darkness are to mystic robes.
---
[Here's my own rendition of it](https://i.imgur.com/N6ZBCie.png). I chose to base it off normal rune armor, cut the amount of gems in half, and attempted to use the remaining ones in more practical fashion.
---
It did receive the criticism that it didn't feel dragonstone-y enough, so [I also made this recolored version](https://i.imgur.com/Dx6NIJS.png) which drops the dragonstone concept entirely to become the Seren-affiliated armor that Treasure Trails never gave us.

Definitely.
---
I made an edit to my previous comment. I found it funny you did all this just because one comment in particular, you should have show more of them in my opinion. I get your message and I agree with it. If my comment felt like an attack on you and your opinion, it wasn't meant to be.
---
I want to see an image of people in white knight armor surrounding a qt in fashionscape

Well whether we like it or not, it is political worldwide, even in the UK. I just personally believe the event didn't fit in a videogame such as Runescape.
---
Another man of culture!
---
Personally, I've always used RS to zen out and quests completely defeat the purpose of what in trying to do. I want to hit that point of empty thought movement and you can't do that when questing. Also, the 10 year old trapped inside of me is still pissed that all metal gauntlets from bronze to rune got linked to that bullshit. I can make greaves, but my dude is to stupid to make his own gauntlets? I also hate not being able to make boots, but at least those aren't quest locked behind a ridiculous quest. So uh, it's 50/50 for me. I'll never have Barrows Gloves because I hate the quest, and I dislike questing in general.
---
It's a bug in the sense that the change was never supposed to make it into the live game.
---
__*SPARTA!*__
---
Gratz! Thats my next goal too! The only one left with any weight to it for me is DS2
---
Keep an eye out for polls, they're looking to buff the prif course and it could be viable

it's not just this sub it's life in general
---
a lot of guys i've known were just completely misogynistic dickheads. like misogynistic to a  bizarre extent. these people will literally talk shit about women for ANYTHING they do and call her a cunt, a bitch, someone who deserves rape, etc. it's fucking nuts bro, these people are literally fucked.

Is elite void with tbp viable in a bandos trio with 85 ranged? I have most my bank in archer gear and cbf liquidating for melee.
---
Anyone who has so little definition to their personality that they have "RS" appended onto their username on social media probably isnt the type of person with enough world experience to properly talk to another human being about critical feedback.
---
At some point you just have to accept that people are fucking dumb, and you cant change that sometimes.
---
I assume you also object to the events marking religious celebrations in the game then?
---
Ain't this one of things babies sit in
---
Run a poll to have gnomes as a playable race!
---
Depends what gear you're using. Ive seen people ranging in full rune and they definitely need someone to help them
---
Butt dialing yourself out of osrs and dying is one of the funniest things I've heard in this game. Hahaha Hope you made the bank back quit!
---
As an rs3 player yeah it's pretty shitty. Most of the playerbase hates it but have sunk so much time into it and have friends/etc, to give up the game. Too many whales
---
It's her job to study the art style and her fellow artists should be able to help her figure her out.
---
It seems like she put in 0 effort to make anything like the existing art style and then acted as if she didn't know it wasn't anything like the art style &amp; that she didn't know how to make it like the art style
---
I'm the one being called a sociopath and 'emotionally dense' and you're the one saying insults are wrong?
---
I'm one to judge it as nothing as a fellow human being that occasionally gets an insult thrown my way. If you choose to let yourself get upset over an insult, especially one that is mostly a joke, that's a horrible decision. 
---
Telling them not to make that decision is simply good advice.

Lol if I ever came across a screenshot my undressed character because I died somewhere I wouldn‚Äôt even be mad. Like is that how you get your sense of pride? Go for it man
---
Yeh I definitely agree with that, but I'd more likely refer to it as a version rollback here in my team. That could be done because of a bug that occured from new features, but if it was a rollback because a feature was unwanted by a client it would just a version rollback.
---
That said we're just nitpicking, I don't mean any offense.
---
Hello and thank you for replying, i've had some time now to properly read about Ranching and i have to say it is absolutely breathtaking!
---
The depth and creativity of this skill is amazing really to say the least, i don't know how much time you've invested into this but it's well thought of and ties together so many skills. I don't know if you've been getting any feedback from the Jagex mods but i really hope this is something that they pick up.
---
I wish i could log onto OSRS right now and train it to be honest, it just feels sad that the prospect of a new skill making into the game isn't very high at the moment considering how it went with Warding, but if this ever makes it into the game as a poll vote then you certainly have my vote.
---
Nothing is a two-minute job in this industry. They'll need to go through every chargeable item in the game and see whether they should be changed too, they'll need to poll it, develop it, clean up the surrounding code, and finally, it will hit QA.
---
You know what does take two minutes? Emptying your serp helm every week or so to see how many scales there are.
---
Yes. God. I hopped from 7:15 pm til 8:15 pm. At first I thought I'd been in one block, but it wasn't there, so I started just hopping everywhere I could.
---
And I would've gotten away with it, thanks to Jagex's beautiful baby safeguards, if it hadn't been for ~~those meddling kids~~ the hop limit crushing my hopes and dreams every couple of worlds after about fifteen minutes.
---
Because they get $320 and then OP's account is also locked so the bonds on it don't actually go to any membership for anyone.  Double dip.
---
It's just the next iteration of fat, lazy, lives in mum's basement neckbeard who can't talk to women.

It's a weird, highschool level way of demeaning people that just lets you completely dismiss whatever they're saying.

That said, that guy is clearly a cunt.
---
best not mention rs3
---
I'll wait until i get 2200 total to try 2200 world.  Tried getting vet'ion kill for diary and got pked twice by two different groups trying to do just that.  I wasn't risking anything either but the amount of time trying to get one kill was ridiculous.
---
Game isn't suppose to be catered to iron men at all : ^ )
---
It didn't degrade on mob misses/splashes, now it does.
---
Yeh I'll specify a "different" cosmetic version then. It doesn't feel like it relates to anything dragonstone.
---
Why would people from Christian countries object to their religious traditions - that have been celebrated for thousands of years which also took place in the medieval time frame the game is set it?
---
Its good that theyre taking this approach though.
---
Konar never needed a nerf and it got nerfed *just 7 hours after release* due to Reddit and streamers complaining like fuck. 
---
Jagex‚Äôs Zalcano approach to take a week to look at the data and decide on the best approach to balancing it is the best way they couldve done it. Big props to Jagex on this front for not instantly listening to a ton of complainers.
---
Holy shit yes

Thbbbbt!
---
&gt;can‚Äôt believe people vote no to Warding but flock to reddit over  ranching lmfao.
---
Reddit upvoted pro-warding content, what are you talking about.
---
It's the same people who like warding who like ranching, and vice versa.
---
Rates comparable to power mining iron ores, very bad idea. Everyone and their mothers would switch to higher tier mining and crash the pricing of them.
---
Nat / Astral Rc, Zulrah, Vorkath, Abby demons (yes, I like them with Dharoks^^) , Dagannoth Kings.
---
However, if I get a drop from them I not necessarily sell it, like zulrah scales, manta rays, etc.
---
Why, everyone here seems to love this idea which is basicly player owned farms from rs3. People liked the new quest aswell and that was basicly plague's end from rs3.
---
You do you but how can you grind out 26 defenders but not 20m? Or just no fun for you in money grinds at all?
---
Wait these rocks give you shards?
---
Nah we aint
---
The game is literally based on repetitive clicking to perform the same action over and over and over... 98 times per skill. 
---
I dont think you can call it flawed content. Because that's literally the entire game.
---
Other players actions shouldn't dictate your level of reward to the levels that Zalcano does.
---
Ban non-food/potions/equipment, and the MVP should only get higher value loot, scaling down by placement to last, i.e 5th person in 5 man team gets similar loot to 5th in 40 man team. This encourages people to join less populated games so they don't end every 30 seconds but you get better loot.
---
More time to introduce items but they're worth slightly more, so that evens it out.
---
Pet chance should be rarer and given to everyone; don't scale chance on placing, as that's counter to every other pet in the game.
---
If they don't want to rank people for rewards, remove high and low ends of table and give medium rewards.
---
if you use that you don't stop running until you "reach your spot" though. (if you reclick anywhere while still running you will also run to that location).
---

I think the content is quite interesting but I'm very against any more dailyscape.
---
Still got killed 4 times kek
---
just because he said cunt at the end doesnt mean hes an incel lmao. And people saying "doesn't feel like oldschool" is still feedback even though its quite vague, this is usually accompanied with a reason why it doesn't feel like oldschool as well as comparisons between the graphics at hand and old content which is considered oldschool. Literal moron calling everyone an incel lmao insecure much.
---
It‚Äôs a fake clip and the community are taking the piss. Just putting his face an over someone else‚Äôs vid‚Äôs
---
Buy gold from Player Auctions. I've used them since like 2011. Yes, disputes happen. But not like this. Cheaper &amp; better.
---
Btw, I know ppl are going to berate me but listen up.
---
I have proof that jagex actually sells their gold via hold sites. They are a low-dogshite company. So yeah, have at it
---
Way better than Mod West‚Äôs design
---
Idea is good.
---
Problems: I don't like anything being unlocked at level 99 &amp; I don't enjoy the fact that you are adding so many new items.
---
Gz on the 40k
---
Ok, but where's the dragonstone part? This is just rune armor with purple cloth, unless you're telling me those are somehow made from dragonstone.
---
Agreed
---
"Super bass" is a play on words as it sounds like "superb ass" when you say it fast. Just like how you would expect /r/superbowl to be about football and not superb owls.
---
Adding it to farming would be slapping on a very large amount of content onto an already pretty well fleshed out skill. It works as its own skill, as it's not specifically about farming, just something that also happens on some farms. Ranchers and farmers however are two different real world jobs. I don't understand the mentality behind putting two similar ideas into one skill. If that were the case, then smithing, fletching, and runecrafting should all just be part of crafting, as they're all the production of another item via natural resources. That wont pass though either, because it changes the game far too much for people to agree on. Why bar content just because it could fit into another skill when there are also other skills that could fit into other skills?
---
I'm all for warding and this ranching idea being added into runecrafting and farming respectively, mind you. I just want some new content. I just don't get why we shouldn't have it just because "oh it's a new skill." That doesn't make sense to me.
---
After the Failing poll of warding does the team have any plans of implementing some sort or system (new skill would make this more simple) to remove low valued clue scroll items such as god pages, god rune armor, comp bows ect... from the game?  dont feel like their price should ever be so low, i remember the team talking about god pages to burnt pages.
---
First, you're selling it like 80k above median price. Not much when talking an item worth 8+ mil, but apparently it's enough in this case.
---
Second, yeah, it'll probably sell faster and for more if you poison it.
---
Uh.  What?  Also, what government institution?  Chase bank?  That's a commercial entity.
---
The in game prices can be pretty misleading sometimes, I‚Äôd suggest looking up the dagger on ge tracker for a more accurate price to sell at
---
call a guy a cunt = you're a dick, call a woman a cunt = you're a misogynist. what?
---
He traded the valuable items including the phat to friends/clan mates before he got banned
---
I dunno the current price now and it might have been outdated because i left it there for 3 days.  
---
I sold it for slightly below market price.
---
If you think i should poison it then which poison?
---
Thanks.
---
Another comment.
---
Get fucked RuneScape. Literally a 3 year old child doing nothing can manage your game better.
---
 I remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer
---
Where'd ya pull that percentage from eh?
---
Come on man! I am at 24m xp with no pet, I even gave up on farming;(
---
But congrats mate!
---
The whole idea of 1.5t is that you get a chance fo mine double or up to 4 with varrock platebody. This is what makes it 1.5t over 3t. It's definitely better than afking.
---
Change it into a green pixel
---
What even is the droprate if that lmao
---
Holy fuck. What a shitshow.
---
Crazy. I would keep the account but idk for what. You want a skiller minus farming?
---
as far as I know you don't have to be mvp in TOB to get loot, or the pet. It just increases the odds.
---
one positive with rs3's mtx is that it doesnt affect ironmen at all, which i give some respect to, it genuinely surprised me when i found out.
---
in other words, make ur ironmen now to survive the mtx invasion of osrs xd
---
While I get this is meant as a joke, all the autistic sperging out that's been going on has kinda overshadowed the fact that MOST of the new models are an improvement. 
---
The issue is that it's easier to fixate on negatives than positives. Nobody cares about the 20 good models when Iorwerth doesn't quite cut the mustard. 
---
Are they perfect? No. Are they better? I dunno, they look much more "elfy" to me, since before they were kinda just regular human models with long ears.
---
What do you mean by the Varrock minimum?
---
I agree with it being a waste of dev time, I‚Äôve never looked at the ring in my bank and thought ‚Äúgod, I wish I could use that more!‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôd rather focus dev time elsewhere personally.
---
Thanks. I will try.
---
This whole comment is just...
---
Oof.
---
Drop the price...........
---
Hey I‚Äôve been thinking about starting a lava dragon alt. It‚Äôs Something with low requirements but when I look at guides, I never see lava dragons mentioned. Should I opt for another alt or would lava dragons be worthwhile.
---
Uhh... yea I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs out there probably chasing rabbits on the farm haha
---
It's not really comparable to ToB. MvP doesn't give you any bonusses, it just means you contributed the most and therefore have the highest chance of uniques. 
---
Zalcano can be compared to wintertodt. The only differences are that wintertodt does not have a MVP system. You also cannot do tick manipulation in wintertodt and you need to aquire a certain threshold of points before getting rewards.
---
People are upset at just how much mvp means for your loot. The difference is just too big. It's been confirmed only the mvp gets a chance of the pet too (which isn't the case in either tob or wt)
---
&gt;u overpaid for gp cuz u didnt want to get banned for rwt, but jagex fucks you over anyways classic
---
There irony being he probably could have just RWT'd it over a few days and he wouldn't have got banned
---

In the house on the hill north of fossil island there's a book on a lectern with a digsite pendant drawn in it.
---
Use your pendant on it and you'll unlock the direct fossil island teleport
---
I think it's funny and just proves that most likely 50% of the people here are teens and shouldn't be allowed to vote in OSRS tbh. 
---
We wanted osrs and got osrs because we loved runescape pre-wilderness/trading removal. They loved it after.
---
Can I post this tomorrow??
---
Not for fighters torso, I'd imagine. More aimed towards the elite diary? Requires max level for all roles
---
Having fun is cool and chill ;)

stop i can only get so hard

'A woman is unlikely to receive 100s of tweets... Calling her a cunt for having one' - there's many cases of mysognists harassing women just for having an opinion on the internet mate. How exactly is designing something in a way someone doesn't like equate to being a cunt? And if it had nothing to do with that why call her it?
---
Those words are 100% related to gender mate, words don't exist in a vacuum.
---
Love the composition, sounds like you arranged it yourself by ear?
---
One quick tip, you might be trying too ambitious of fingerings and positions. Your understanding of music might be ahead of your technical prowess :p see if you can play it on another position on the neck, that might help
---
Yes
---
They probably help people that are not members of the clan (yet) get them so they can officially join. Seems like a good way of recruiting and getting newer players into the clan.
---
Don't forget about the Mod OwO scandal from 2027.. *shudders*
---
Fishing lvl?
---
They‚Äôre probably thinking of splashing as in the afk mage training method.
---
It's not the emoji. It's the "this made me laugh." 
---
Just upvote the post. Saying it made you laugh doesn't add anything to the discussion
---
Stats make money. Start grinding
---
UNPAYABLE
---
Dogs being able to dig would actually be really cool! Probably only for clues tho and not for farming patches
---
Best iteration yet.
---
Reddit does not like Facebook/Instagram style comments
---
Do you not remember how we got 07? We wanted the old combat system. The crowds weren't screaming about wanting 2007 but jagex said that was the only back up that they had so we settled for that. Everyone who currently plays the game has just as much validity to vote as you or I. While we may dissagree that doesn't mean they shouldn't vote.
---
Here‚Äôs a suggestion - allow players to ‚ÄúSmith‚Äù orikalkum by having players use orikalkum ore to make an alloy which is more malleable than orikalkum itself, this new alloy would be smithable into a new set of armor for level 50 defense characters.
---
And to artificially increase the value of the armor set to stop it replacing existing level 50 armor, have the smithed bars have a chance to become a ‚Äúpure‚Äù variant, which can be used to smith a traceable variant of the armor. This would mean there is some value in smithing high level equipment (provided you are lucky enough to get pure bars) rather than it being a pure loss like with rune equipment.
---
&gt; This game 's goal is to preserve the 2007scape feel as much as possible while delivering new content.
---
That's what you think it should be though, clearly not everyone agrees with that.
---
Any other periods/full stops in other skill guides?
---
looks sick except the helmet
---
Runescapes lore is actually pretty interesting its just tucked away a lot of the time.
---
What people fail to mention here is that Mat K doesn't actually use Runelite.
---
I love you didnt use the standard black yellow background
---
Herbs are in no way a viable training method for farming, the money you spend on tree / fruit tree saplings are higher than what you can possibly earn from herbs
---
By guthix!!!
---
is this just osu for non weebs
---
Iron men can‚Äôt trade, so no matter how much cash I have, I won‚Äôt be able to afford one. If common sense was lard, you wouldn‚Äôt have enough to grease a pan, so nvm on the lard for brains comment
---
I hope this meme continues.
---
Have some silver
---
will give it a try, thank you!
---
I actually thought with the farming guild we had the ability to do this, I was happy to farm blue dragon scales in my ranch. But this is great
---
You asked when farming became profitable. You said nothing about leveling the skill. Ofc if you do tree runs it's going to be expensive.
---
[Nice](#gnomechild)
---
Typical Jagex - half assed
---
It‚Äôs stats are still the exact same and you don‚Äôt have to imbue it anymore, that‚Äôs a good change.
---
The problem now is that it degrades on ANY hit you take, even zeros. So you used to be able to use it for a decent amount of time. Now degrades at 3-4X the rate it used to.
---
Like the whole point of the shield is that you get hit zeros, now you get punished for that??
---
Use the guides to prepare the items needed, then do the quest without the guide. It‚Äôs a nice trade off of not being spoiled but still being prepared.
---

Pures who are unable to equip¬†[steel platelegs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Steel_platelegs)¬†must talk to Edmond to polish the steel platelegs into¬†[Ardougne knight platelegs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne_knight_platelegs).
---
It soared to 10k upvotes instantly.  The fact that it grabbed so much positivity so quickly is kind of astonishing
---
The barrows lore is pretty cool and they had some great postbags from the hedge/short story stuff. Not going to lie though my favorite barrows moment was filling a bucket with water at the barrows well only for Ahrim to teleport next to you and refill it seconds later.
---
So basically fat spikes after zulrah and wintertodt, and nothing else really got anyone new playing. Most other updates, numbers went down.
---
Maybe jagex needs to start just working on great single updates, with no specific deadline? Instead of consistently putting out content
---
Where has this guy been hiding!?
---
When's the Obby max cape coming? Need 1 real bad to flex on the noobs
---
It is rendi lol?
---
First thing i plan on doing is 84 hunter and that make me going into wildy soo i wasnt gonna take that chance
---
It‚Äôs amazing that 95% of scapers lift. Hell even fucking sparc mac did pull-ups lmfao
---
We have the exact same schedule except I wake up at a 4 so I don‚Äôt have to rush to work after the gym
---
After a long day of work I just don‚Äôt feel like scaping...I wanna eat then pretty much get ready for bed. And I wanna do something fulfilling/productive on my off days, and not just blow them on a game
---
I quit for now. And it sucks because I‚Äôm very close to max cape :(
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know how people have jobs and still scape
---
Not with that attitude you won't son!
---
Dwh not better?
---
Perhaps we can extract a vaccine from their blood
---
Summer classes are a joke, he can't be taking more than 3 right now. It's possible but VERY unlikely, unless studying for a graduate-style program.
---
Yeah the 20 minute thing is def the problem.
---
I edited the OP i let it purposely roll over 20 minutes and watched myself pingpong then interacted and went back to combat. 
---
So that definitely solves that.
---
The plain answer is I must be rolling over 20 minutes really often now!
---
I don't expect anyone to believe me. I obviously sped through my explanation, but here you go.
---
My odds of winning a 3m bet were pretty close to 50% over hours of botting
---
My odds of winning anything over 50m turned into a winrate of 13-18%
---
The bot was set to calculate winrates. After my 12th time of losing my money (LOL) I accidentally left my bot paused and it was calculating my stakes. Dramatic differences. &amp; I was shook
---
cOnSpIrAcY
---
&gt;that has to be a bug
---
   c    v ,,
---
IMO fuck ranching, it‚Äôs just summoning 2.0 with extra steps and a few changes.
---
How can you woosh this fucking hard lmao
---
So is your comment. Down voted and reported.
---
Warframes quests are top notch. Wow has plenty of quest chains in cata zones and upwards that are a lot better than OSRS quests.
---
OSRS quests are monotonous dogshit. 
---
&gt;Name a game with better cohesive worldbuilding and lore 
---
Are you serious lmao?
---
The lore in this game is terrible compared to other franchises.
---
Swampletics video
---
I Might start questing then :) could be fun lvling while questing.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/kemplos](https://www.twitch.tv/kemplos)
---
30~ mins.
---
he gnever saw it coming
---
Well yeah there are differences but the whole thing is based on the idea of collecting animals to get free resources and boosts to in game content.
---
Like summoning, level up your animal making skills to get resources and boosts...
---
I feel like i'm taking crazy pills.
---
Was this not already discussed to a lesser extent as a [livestock](https://i.imgur.com/egluHso.jpg) extension onto the farming guild that was removed by Jagex and no one seemed to care?
---
I was kinda in the same pattern at some point this year during college, at first i was like sick i can afk skills during class like wcing fish or wtv.... 
---
A week passed and i was bored out of my mind of skilling, and doing pvm like raids or grinding boss pets which was taking not afk at all lol.
---
End up missing class a few time cause of staying up all night
---
ah yes, the classic response to the top comment of the thread
---
Dann got to start questing!! I think ill level with questing for once. I used to do lvling and only quest becouse I had to.
---
This time all lvl with questing and only skill when I need requirements or need √† break
---
YES! Or atleast they shold add a ''pet''/''cuddle'' option.... :(
---
Not without polling the change first ecksdee

The guy is a legend, watch out woox.
---
How stupid would it be to start an ultimate iron man when my only experience with the game is some very well produced youtube content.
---
Pretty hard to argue against Disney‚Äôs cash stack tho
---
So is *your* comment. Down voted and reported
---
What
---
Why? I mean I wouldn't do it because it would reduce my enjoyment of the game but I got no issues with a guy that does. Seems pretty weird when people shame others for spending money.
---
They already did remedy it you mouth breather. They told OP everything he needed to know through tickets it isn‚Äôt their fault if he didn‚Äôt understand and tried to rally the reddit mob.
---
Guy who‚Äôs more entertaining and unique than swamp man. [does things like underground pass with 10hp, 1 agility, and only eats potatos](https://youtu.be/4fd0OHen-O4)
---
Personally I don't want them to rework any original random events. They're iconic. They've done some QoL where needed and made them optional and dismissable. That's all that matters to me about the old ones :)
---
I just enjoy it.
---
I mean if you have the disposable income and enjoy the game, why not? The game needs to get support from somewhere.
---
Just curious what account build would have thr 40 def for dragonstone gauntlets, but not be able to get rune gloves?
---
The only job I can get around here is working at a mechanic for like 1 dollar per day.
---
owo
---
Being a hcim is like being afraid of bossing cause you can die
---
You skipped a step, or part of a step. Double check the quest log
---
Trust me dude, i got a ritalin prescription and it makes a huge difference. Ritalin basically does the same shit as addy, just less known
---
I can bearly watch this.
---
No reason to ctlr click outside of the fireball. If you start running during acid phase you messed up, hard.
---
I mean... You could just play the account
---
Yeh and thats what you get for supporting jagex , ypu get f**ed by them
---
Because the superiority complex from pwning f2p nerds is literally THE ONLY reason to play video games as an intellectual.
---
(/s)
---
Uh no. We wanted 2006scape bruh. Then they went on ahead and shut that shit down and released a 2007 version themself.
---
We shouldn't give people who played runescape after 2008 a vote. That's not oldschool.
---
Hell yeah
---
You‚Äôre good people. Have a great day.
---
You know what's fucking wack as well? People downvoting me for expressing disapproval towards that. 'Mod Woman' is not an endearing nickname. It definitely used in a derogatory way.
---
Supposed to be spelled OnlyTrails, hes an ironman that only trains by doing clue scrolls and is a pretty cool dude.
---
It sounds like OP routinely drops hundreds of dollars in OSRS MTX, the billing support team at Jagex was already pretty good despite the perception and this dude probably would jump right to the front of the line if he didn't chargeback.
---
Nice copy paste
---
dont forget to wear your tin foil hat today or someone might read your mind while you are using a bot
---
BigBlueLucy, wielder of hotdogs, slayer of hunger
---
This shit is fucking fire. I always wanted something of a breeding skill for runescape, I hope that Jamflex can take something from this and put together a skill that has a shot at 75%.
---
Such talent.
---
I‚Äôm gonna take my horse to the old town ranch
---
I'm a zerk with 2 99s and 848 total... Regen bracelet
---
Honestly i kinda like the helmet design, without that stupid dragonstone ofc.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing it implemented as a SEPARATE helmet you could wear.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
That chart really isn‚Äôt clear. Osrs made double from subs and then the MTX isn‚Äôt separated so bonds bought just for osrs aren‚Äôt counted towards that. Also RS3 has way more employees. Osrs makes about double rs3 iirc
---
A perfect 5/7
---
They don't have display cases. Their current use consists of trading them in for numulite at the fossil collector, using it to partialy charge an ancient wyvern shield or use them at the mycelium pool for prayer xp. Both of these options are kind of underwhelming so it's best to just keep them in the fossil storage. On several q&amp;a's they've let on that they want to use these fossils to lets you create a sort of "bone boss". However there is no real development in that process beyond the initial pitch.
---
yeah stuff like that, not when someones running round in full guthans for slayer and then telling them oh yeah its gotta be bandos with a eternal glory or its pointless playing because your not the same as i am
---
How generous.
---
It looks more like a purple trimmed rune armour than dragonstone tho
---
One does not look like one, but act as one
---
Hopefully this comes across constructively:
---
I mean Farming literally refers to both plants and animals. So I feel like this is just a Farming expansion. Also it's exactly the same as Farming - patches that you have to wait for animals to grow up in. It would struggle for the same reason that anything Crafting-like struggles in polls.
---
Also Construction already gives you dragons in dungeons. 
---
I'm not sure every animal needs a unique. Red spiders for example would already potentially be a great herblore secondary meta.
---
The problem with "variation" is that stuff is either the meta or it's dead content. People quickly learn out which it is.
---
Throwback to when that maxed main got manually perm banner for making a swastika out of fires on Keiran's live stream
---
https://imgur.com/KujEEA0 I'll trade you 3 tridents for a pet (I have 0 pets on my acc)
---
Well when they go and do a new quest like this that‚Äôs being implemented into an older area. There‚Äôs old code already written for that spot that‚Äôs messy and lengthy. They have to go in and rewrite a lot of that stuff so that way in the future if they do want to do more updates to it they can with ease. Cleaning up the old code that‚Äôs already existing is difficult. Trying to make it 100% accurate to those older standards would be somewhat impossible without writing it in that same old buggy fashion. Hope that helped answer some of your question.
---
You're very welcome, don't get bogged down by all the complicated builds and strategies just enjoy the game for now you might not EVER need to think about them if you don't play to PvP and you can do that at max level just fine. Don't get burned out, just enjoy the game!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure most phishing sites don‚Äôt install rats. They just take the info you give them. Also if you knew it was fake 7 months ago why‚Äôd it take you so long to change your password.
---
It wasn't going to be polled. It just hasn't happened yet.
---
You seem to know what your talking about how the hell you fall for a phish ?
---
Everyone gets the wildy and free trade removal wrong.
---
What sense does it make to remove them? Is there any community in game that benefitted from it? The only possible community that fits this criteria would be pvmers, except in that time theres were none of these pvm incentives to lure people in. 
---
So why did they do it?
---
Because they had literally not other option to keep the game up.
---
This was during a huge rising in botting, real world trading, but most importantly, credit card fraud. Bot farms were essentially laundering money from credit cards, using them to pay for accounts members which would then bot and subsequently sell the gp for real money. What spurred issues for Jagex was a number of credit card companies threatening to blackball the company if they couldn't take effective preventative measures to prevent these fraudulent credit cards being used to spam out bot accounts, because the credit card companies were on the hook for all these fraudulent charges when people reported the charges on their card.
---
Well, with jagex reporting over %90 of there sales coming from credit cards, they could not lose this market and survive. They did not have a sophisticated enough antibot program for it to bar these accounts. The only way to butcher the problem was to cut off their ability to real world trade, hence cutting off free trade.
---
As time went on, there were legal changes with the way credit card companies could interact with vendors, putting more responsibilities on the individual card holders rather than expecting venders to vet every single charge they process. 
---
So eventually Jagex over turned the free trade restrictions and restored the wildy.
---
So no, it was not a malicious act by an out of touch company, but a temporary solution to prevent them from losing over %90 of their income, a scenario that would have definitely killed the game for good.
---
Tl;dr : Free trade and wildy were removed to prevent Jagex from unfairly losing almost all their revenue and the game dying.
---
Oh I got the hint, he's just pretty stupid for it.
---
I would recommend you try a normal or hardcore iron. Uim is about super long grinds but the fact that dying means you drop everything can be punishing, especially if you haven't done any of the quests of the game and some quest areas and fights are instanced, so everything u are carrying just disappears when you die. A lot of the inventory management is a skill on its own, and something not often shown on videos featuring uim content. They just teach the viewers once for the knowledge, but it's things like edge/zulrah suicide is something they have to do multiple times a day, over and over. The inventory management bit is just as stressful.
---
As a normal iron you will still have to go through some dragged out gameplay like grinding crafting for zenytes or slayer for a trident/DHL. Just less punishing and you can pick up game knowledge at a comfortable pace.
---
I never implied anything about the game's community though? I was relying to the OP about how it is technically possible to max in rs3 without actually playing the game.
---
i'd prefer menaphos to be a city-raid tbh
---
He asked why the person wasn't showing up on hiscore and friends list so that has to do with OPs question.
---
I changed the day of, but when my account was hacked it was done from my PC, (I had authenticator set to trust devices for 30 days, and he knew my bank pin)
---
Did he/she get it yet?
---
He said he launched it in the title
---
&gt;twisted bow is just hexhunter bow
---
&gt;prims, pegs and eternals are steadfast, glaiven and ragefire boots respectively
---
&gt;trident is polypore staff
---
list goes on i'm sure
---
Wtf happened to this guy? I miss his vids so much :(
---

---
If you're brave enough to lie for sympathy in a public forum, you deserve a little pushback.
---
Despite the memes, it's entirely possible to get a staff member to manually read your ticket, 95% of the time within 2 days.
---
If you get confused by the box that tells you how to send a ticket and feel the need to mouth off a company, but more importantly individual staff members for transgressions they likely didn't even commit, then, again, getting people to call you an idiot is again an appropriate response.
---
The vast majority of "reddit pls help" is people who either got knocked back correctly and didn't like the outcome or players who see disgruntled rwters/botters complain about false bans and don't even try support.
---
Yes, support has issues, and yes, there are false positives, but the shitshow on Reddit of people wanting to skip the queue is unhelpful in the scheme of things, so the "smackdowns" are for the best, as they make users trying to get special treatment look like clowns so people think twice before coming here for help.
---
Either ban individual account issue posts or keep smackdowns, but letting users mouth off then settling it behind closed doors just looks dodgy and encourages more people to post as they see no downside to airing their laundry, clogging up support staff from doing things on their system.
---
I've always seen maps that let the desert have a watery coast and all I can think about is how much better it would feel running around with a coast rather than pitch black nothingness. Excited for if they plan on doing some desert stuff, I never saw Menaphos (like I hadn't seen Prif) because I quit RS3 too early
---
And as a result, fewer people actually care about skill levels/xp nowadays. More people are focusing on content and achievements that aren't buyable - boss collection logs, kill times, slayer killcount, achievements (such as Insane Final Boss), agility course records etc. So although a lot of the game is 'buyable' in a sense, most of it is relatively unimpactful, as skilling xp rates are higher than ever and maxing an account is effectively just a gateway to the 'real' content.
---
Couple of questions:
---
**1)** Would it be time to re-poll Bryophyta's Essence as an F2P drop? As it is right now, Obor is simply better in every way possible.
---
**2)** Could the Moss Giants in the Wilderness have the improved droprate on Mossy Keys?
---
Hill Giants in the Wildy (*more spawns would be great btw, at least so it'd kind of compete with Edgeville Dungeon*) do drop the Giant Key at this rate, why not the Moss variant..?
---
**3)** With Warding having failed the Poll... Could Shade Robes be improved and implemented with the Hood for F2P? Magic is severely lacking in F2P. This would also give Shades something worth killing for. Maybe add some to the Wildy..?
---
Is that soar zom the memegod himself
---
No comment :P
---
Yeah I tried soloing but it‚Äôs way too slow. Best method is definitely 1.5 ticking on a world with a couple players. MVP loots needs to be nerfed and normal loot needs to be buffed, I don‚Äôt like competition in team based mini games. It‚Äôs fine for higher level players to get better loot, but this isn‚Äôt the way it should be done. It just rewards one player while punishing all the others severely.
---
Nope
---
Disagree. I feel for disconnections but that can‚Äôt govern death mechanics any more than they have done. 
---
Ultimately, like others have said, it‚Äôs basic risk/reward - are you willing to risk losing your best gear for an easier fight, do you play it ultra safe on welfare or maybe a hybrid? That decision making and strategy is an inherent part of the game and shouldn‚Äôt be removed more so than it has.
---
5 if you're on a Slayer task using controlled style on a melee weapon
---
How do you get your windows to do that and not overlap the other window?
---
Like when the 3 tick barb is happening it doesnt cover the zulrah client
---
I know he's a legend and all but that's gatekeeping at it's finest and a toxic mentality to have. I'm not saying we should make RC 200kexp/h, but QoL changes like the ones made to the rune essence pouches are fine.
---
what makes you so certain. The section it's under prefaces with the following text   
---
&gt; This section displays changes we are investigating and want your feedback on before we implement or poll any of them
---
Sadly, the current design disgust me and it only caters to hardcore people who cannot stand "mediocre" content but they are in need of flashy content, which sets the bar higher for content delivery and which is why we can never go back to what it was more than a dozen year ago. 
---
What you said about resource allocation is damn right. Capitalizing on addictions, some may deny they are one, but unfortunately it seem the motive of the game is just this way.
---
Make a skipping stone shortcut for ~50-60 agility locked behind the medium diary across the river right in front of the church and I'm sold. Just feels like something nearly pointless that Jagex would add in for convenience sake
---
Whilst Song of the Elves was great, is there a reason for all the unpolled changes? It‚Äôs understandable that some unintended changes(Waterfall moss giant losing aggro) sneak their way in, but there seems to have been a considerable amount of ¬´easyscape¬ª implementations lately.
---
- Removing worldhopper - Great in my opinion, but why hide it?
---
- New chatheads, a change being polled, great job based on feedback :)
---
- Underground Pass/Elf Obsticles being made easier DESPITE polls saying we DID NOT want that
---
I don‚Äôt want to accuse the mods of anything, and I do believe most actions are taken in good faith, but it really does seem like ¬´Jagex¬ª made up their minds before the polls failed, and decided to just run with it, hoping the players wouldn‚Äôt notice :(
---
That being said, great Job at Priffdinas, lots of activities - without removing the GE as a hotspot. Also it‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre able to 1.5Tick Zalcano(more effort, better rewards), it just needs some balancing so that more people - not JUST MVP and no-one else in a GROUP activity 
---
Looking forward to the Zalc/general SotE tweaks :)
---
Just edit it to the next lyric!
---
Paging r/uselessredcircle
---
I think you're getting better.
---
can you see any elf content without doing the new quest?
---
this is probably a 1 in 500k chance or something ridiculous.
---
At barrows I was using like 5-10 charges per trip, now i'm using over 50
---
Sick drop off a meaty demon
---
I thought so too
---
Yeah lol it‚Äôs like well since everyone else told me how to play I guess I can‚Äôt enjoy the game anymore :/
---
EU4
---
I love this idea!
---
I don't think they know that it's a company with different prospects and different owners, hence different in motives. Good for business, sound like an illusion they're living in. Wait til the game goes down, nothing can save them.
---
I‚Äôve been at rune drags for like 2 months and haven‚Äôt seen anyone who was blatantly botting. It just wouldn‚Äôt make any sense to bot rune dragons when zulrah is slightly better money and is 10x quicker to make an account to kill it
---
How about we make smithing dragon armor wilderness only and a tick or two faster? And at several ticks faster the deeper you are in the wilderness? I‚Äôm just babbling here.
---
Well there are a bunch of man children that's the problem
---
Is barraging jellies meta on task? Never even considered it.
---
Well since I got a prim from cerb why not use it for bonds...
---
CHESTBRAH
---
Compared to spending hundreds of in-game hours for the same result??? Unless you are unemployed or making straight slave wages, working a real job is more gp/hr than anything in game.
---
Nice try derrek
---
I get that everyone on the subreddit is a noob but i didn't think i'd get downvoted into oblivion for daring to suggest that maybe you should be able to afford the second 1m+ melee upgrade you should buy after whip if you've done dragon slayer 2. This is unreal.
---
Yeah I used 5 of em on my hcim but the promo" isnt available on this platform" :(
---
Not af, but yes
---
one that has just moved from nmz to gwd to corp not much more, from 75 to 98 range at zammy boss only lol
---
Still butthurt over the poll
---
Yikes
---
They don't have shirts with bob sleeves tho...
---
JMod says kinda, I say yes. Obviously buying so many bonds it's started to make weird issues for him.
---
Maybe they are an iron? Maybe they got cleaned? Maybe they just don‚Äôt have one? Use your fucking head lol
---
the current one that has a period
---
Honestly i want a desert raid and think it should start in mena
---
You‚Äôve got a point but the fact remains that they nerfed an item that hasn‚Äôt been an issue after 14 years with a poll.
---
It's about a split of 66% yes and 33% no.
---
In rs3 they have broadcast ingame when a hcim with a high total dies and they have some funny ones like: " \[player name\] died with \[total level\] by standing in the fire"
---
I get more and more offended every time I see dragonstone armor in its current state. That shit reminds me of when Jagex started changing all the graphics into rs3 cartoons.
---
You come on to a thread where i'm trying to explain why a main who's done ds2 should have a b ring and you use a 1950s insult on me because "hurr durr, me ironman me can't buy b ring" lol
---
Scim
---
wasnt it at blizz? or was that just a rumor?
---
????
---
There's been a lot of odd things happening since Mat K left.
---
Everyone should be doing this tbh

trolo zammy, i rock 3 tbows since recently, op af
---
It's not a skill, you just have points you gather by doing it a certain amount of time. And once you reach a number of points you unlock new things you can do.
---
Oh and for easiness sake just call the points "experience" and special level of points (since they mark a level after which you have something unlocked): "levels".
---
But it's not a skill, it's like castlewars: a minigame. Just that the points/experience are visible in your main screen as quality of life improvement.
---
Consider switching to a dedicated strength weapon and focusing on getting strength to the high 90s (if not 99). Abyssal bludgeon/dagger are the most common options, otherwise you can consider picking up a zamorakian hasta for general use
---
it sounds like a funny thing to do but i only play osrs
---
Thank you very much for the detailed response! I really appreciate it. I just got into fishing afk at work and was trying to see what would be best, but had trouble finding some info. I'll probably stick to Infernal Eels then just to be able to be more afk. Thanks again!
---
Haha, whys that?

Didn't he die to had last month and now he's doing zulrah and 3t fishing like its nothing damn

Make it non-usable in the wildy, to prevent this and green dragon bots from abusing it, plus implement a bag limit of like 20-25 bones, make some lore about the rag and bone mans sack creature being from the wildy or something ‚Äúthe bag shudders as your cross the ditch, it refuses to accept bones past this point.‚Äù

I'm always happy to talk about runescape! Hit me with a PM any time.

Stop shaming these Reddit replies! do you really want zero communication from the mods outside of the game, until customer support is where you think it needs to be? These are high profile cases, being read by tens of thousands of people, that need to be addressed even for purely PR reasons. This is normal behavior for devs that care about their community, it's not taking away nor replacing customer support.
---
OP's case was being handled even without this post.
---
I read you, you're just wrong. Speculation is always gambling. By definition. That's what the word "speculation" literally means lol.

I would but shes still learning tbh she hasnt learned how to use quick prayers or turn then off after combat to maximize usage which is whatever. Def need to make her a member for the poh altar banked like 300 big bones for her when i farmed hill giants. I told her whatever style of combat she chooses ill try my best to support her with (runes, arrows etc.) She choose melee since i recommended it. She hasnt done a quest yet i used her phone and did some basic ones like the wizard tower one and the priest in peril for easy prayer levels. Gotta do the waterfall quest with her if she does become a member For easy levels again. Wanna get her into pest control asap for void.

After doing 99 on both my main and btw, i only got one drop (aside from pyro pieces), which is the damn fire chicken on my btw. He is the epitome of my failures. If you can figure out some shenanigans to trade, I'd gladly give you my discount moltres looking head ass for a tome. Or even the D axe. Or just anything thats not going to just sit in my bank forever
---
They can just up the rune store price to be similar to ge so bots wont profit boom (if needed). Cuz is amazing update I hated getting logged from hopping.
---
It's either they deliver the "smackdown" or let more and more people continue believing that all these problems were Jagex's fault and potentially cancel their memberships. If you were the company which would do?

I got prim crystal on like 40 kc so it was a lot p/h cuz of that

I agree, man. I think it's a strange change to make. I guess it's the compromise from no longer needing to imbue it.

I think it's weird. And a waste of a server category.
---
Hunter is shit at low levels but once you get to birdhouses and then chins it‚Äôs not that bad tbh.  Birdhouses are easy, nice small money from nests.  Chins is kind of a pain but pretty profitable.  Soon as I was able to catch grey chins I‚Äôve been doing it every so often, must‚Äôve banked about a million gp just from grey chins.

I wish that was the reason. At least I would know I fucked up because of it. But I genuinely just want to know what happened.

If someone hacked my account and macro'd, then at least I would know that was the reason.

Really?  You think rebalancing a quest, which was specifically the opposite of what the community wanted, was a simple dialogue box?  If you're incapable of thinking or making a substantial response, please don't bother commenting again.

From what i understand lets say sharks require 76 fishing and your at 75 you cannot boost to 78 and fish sharks you have to be at 76 to fish then you can boost to help speed up the process. If you arent already do barbarian fishing with a heavy rod and drop everything you catch if you can catch sturgeon you get xp pretty fast no gold to be made tho.

What's the aversion to usable cosmetics?

Why on earth can't you dig with a golden spade??

I thought that about that. You'd use bandos chest and tassy with the Torva playebody and legs, but then there's the helm. Pernix would be a simple corruption of armadyl equipment. Virtus just looks sick, but has no GWD equivalent

Thats wrong. Not even close to all the gold is ftrom hacked accounts. If you get hacked with 100mill or more then you deserved it
---
&gt; shes still learning tbh she hasnt learned how to use quick prayers or turn then off after combat
---
She will learn but IMO it's way more fun to start of with some quests and learn pvm on the way than to train on chickens for a couple hours and get burned out.
---
Basically, went pretty fast

Ban is unjust. It makes more sense to mute you.

Currently training up an alt to do rune dragons/Vork while I play on my main

Lmao. You nerds are too much I swear.

By entering combat with it, if poison kills you, it registers the chicken as cause of death
---
Ooo maybe add Desert Treasure 2 within this update? This would spicy more things up and bring incredible completeness to the game. Maybe this can be added for 2020 Q1 or Q3?
---
Okay like i agree Rendi's videos are on another level.  
---
But i still fully believe his MM on a lvl 3 combat account is his greatest video. That was so well edited and such an incredible video.
---
Oy vey.
---
You know the change for underground pass was *after* you completed it right?

I think you mean people don't want new BIS PvP gear in general. They all come from and only come from PvM already

People who put effort into things and it frustrates you that they finish first. I get the pet issue but ffs the state of this reddit. Its end game content if you dont want to put that level of effort theres tons of other stuff.

No lmao it only indicates they forgot

Scim 
---
Unless you're a 1 def pure, finishing monkey madness is highly valuable for your account as the D Scim is one of the best early/mid weapons to train str with
---
If that‚Äôs the case I would much rather it be returned to its original form. Imbuing it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal.
---
My big objection to summoning was that it was very rare to actually see a combat familiar be used. Everyone just used terrorbird, or tortoise, or yak. It shouldnt have been a combat skill when it was essentially just tacking on extra inventory space
---
Raids 3

You're talking about a community that got worked up over a green pixel.
---
There's not really a feud between OSRS and RS3. It's just OSRS looking down on RS3.
---
I do palms, calquat, crystal tree, celastrus, redwood, mahoganies, and hespori.
---
Oh ok I figured it might be the set bonuses but I wasn't sure if there was something else. I assumed some might still be better than alternatives even without set bonus, but it makes sense they wouldn't.

Thanks

People just use a quest guide anyways. The only way to fuck it up with a guide is to misclick

Still think the armour should just be Dragonstone color... simple but to the point...

Believe me, after all the grinding, I don't have very fond feelings for it neither

---
Old Taric was better. Cant change my mind.
---
I think the version of this suggestion Ash said he could get behind was depositing bones in the sack, but not take them out (or alternatively, a similar mechanic to soul bearer)
---
The Menaphos update was the last update I played on RS3 before deciding to retire from the game and join OSRS
---
&gt;Jagex is not at fault for this guy's negligence
---
It takes no time get the reference numbers from their supposed timely refund and then hand them to op. With those reference numbers, Op's bank would have been able to track the exact location of the money and what is holding it up. Jagex did not do this. 
---
&gt;Their customer support is pretty terrible, no real ticket state and the only way to really get something looked at is via Reddit or Twitter.
---
It has been less than six months since Jagex posted their blog post about a focus on customer support and a dedicated effort to *not* make people rely on Reddit and Twitter. An inability to give actual answers that aren't vague "we did our thing, doesn't matter it's our bank matter too". All the J mod did is redirect blame and ignore that *all* of this could have been avoided if A) they didn't lock his purchases and account in the first place or B) actually provided the relevant financial details from the start that would have actually given op something to bring to his bank.

Because it looks better to all of us that Jagex approaches this in an amicable fashion, and a reduction of charges placed shows that they understand that banking transactions arent cut and dry.

&gt;An authenticator delay wouldnt help because there is a 0day that bypasses the authenticator completely.
---
There is absolutely zero proof or evidence of this. Just because people have their accounts hijacked and claim that there is no other way that they could have been compromised, especially given that they are uniquely unqualified to make that assessment - that's not proof, that's not evidence, that's just gossip.
---
&gt;there is a 0day vulnerability in the software Google Authenticator made by Google
---
How do you know that? Do you have proof? Also, why do you seem to conflate the Google Authenticator app with Jagex's TOTP implementation for the Authenticator account security feature? These are not really related in any way, they're just compatible and it's what Jagex recommends you use because it's most popular.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
This is also ignoring how absurdly valuable a TOTP vulnerability would be in the real-world, where people want to steal things more valuable than OSRS Gold, like trade secrets, code, research materials.

To be fair the current D-stone armor looks so out of place. Are we transforming rune armor to the messy armor update they did long ago?

&gt; There is no evidence to suggest Mother Teresa ever told someone to reject pain relief.
---
Your comment does not dispute this statement. Mother Teresa and the Sisters of Charity were not doctors. Their main goal was to help people cope with their suffering in their final days. They did a great job at doing so. Never did they tell someone to deny taking pain medicine, if it was available to them.
---
&gt; Rememeber, my original statement is that While this is getting a lot of attention for being "well thought out" its just someone riding off of current content hoping no one will notice

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12D38-bPBKL3xGYlQvBmeWY7OFHyrjgqeQvWAXAe0iA0/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the original Google Doc in which I designed this skill. If you look in the 'version history', most of the content dates March 2017. Player-owned Farms came out in October 2018. I didn't copy a single thing.

And then the community would holler about Jagex not being transparent and screwing players over and they would look just as bad anyways. You see how one-sided these posts are, and how many details the players leave out. That's not good PR for a company, especially when they're doing things like releasing mobile that attract a lot more players to the game and forums like this. They don't want new players coming and thinking that Jagex is letting accounts get hacked and all sorts of bullshit that people say and letting that turn them off.
---
OP just chatted me saying it wasn't him so just block it bro
---
They don't select people. All you gotta do is follow every jmod in Twitter and go into of their Cc's and suck them off until you have no more self respect, and then maybe you'll get pmod

This is amazing

Osrs is an entirely seperate game, meaning your old character is on rs3. You'll need to start over if you wanna play osrs, wich isn't necessarily  a bad thing.

Seriously, we're on on a fucking subreddit dedicated to discussing everything about this game, including quests. If your argument is literally "who cares it's just a game" then you have no argument.
---
Underground Pass' difficulty is way overhyped anyway, if you would actually bother to get your fucking agility up before doing it.
---
Yeah they are, OP will buy bonds and membership until the day he dies. OSRS for life.
---
Holy...... Wow.  What a dick move Jagex.  Is RS3 terrible?
---
I just like the way the suggestion has been set up for us. Beautiful, especially in comparison to the yellow text, black background.
---
You don‚Äôt have to tell your command EVERYTHING ya know.... just go!
---
So if they are smart enough to know we will be angry and that they will have to revert it when we find it, why try it at all?
---
I bet there's an insured CC that will do it for a smaller cut
---
You're simply wrong for plenty of reasons, and you're comment is just another reason why devs think reddit and their meme's are worthless.
---
You can't chock it up to an integrity change.  It got polled, it got rejected, it got slipped through assuming it would change.  Jagex themselves are not saying this is an integrity changes, so you white knighting them isn't wanted by anyone.
---
Your logic about that could be applied to literally anything in this game to justify any change.  I don't like pest control, they should give me full elite void after one minigame.  Doing it over and over isn't challenging.  I don't like SOTE final boss having an almost instakill mechanic every rotation.  Having to bring mindless supplies without any way to counter it and eating up isn't challenging. I want woodcutting achievment cape but cutting a tree over and over isn't challenging.  Having to run around doing light puzzles, being forced to use stamina pots, not to mention 8 of them, isn't challenging.  I can keep going, but either you get the point or you don't. You can boil down anything to "not challenging".
---
Your logic is bad.  And someone like you will simply keep adjusting your logic as I point out why its a mistake.  Please stop white knighting and meme'ing, and instead, actually think about the discussion, and contribute to the conversation once in awhile.

If public transport is decent in your area I would forego the car and whip out the mobile in public transport and do a lot of the relatively afk skilling like that. You can then spend whatever time you want in the evening, but preferably on weekends on more intensive stuff (bossing, questing, n-tick skilling, etc.) whenever you feel like it.
---
This is how I play currently in my rather miserable almost hour and a half commute. But not every day, as some commutes you want to free your mind a bit.
---
I definitely do not recommend playing during work, however afk it may be, even if its only clicking every 20 minutes. That shit is very distracting. You will lose focus and will reduce in productivity significantly.
---
Yeah I started using something like that when I started my actual ironman. Works.

It would be cool to move your herd or an npcs herd from one ranch/farm to another

It would be instanced and you would have encounters on the way (similar to temple trekking)

I've taken a step back. Since then, RuneScape 3 looks like a f2p Chinese MMORPG to me and OSRS looks like a RuneScape 3(2). Both are highly mismanaged and there's always issues between mods and players.

Looking on the internet, that's about a tenth of what a 400k view video normally makes, so that's probably why he's complaining...
---
He's clearly making content for the sake of  entertainment for his audience as evident from the quality of his videos. There's nothing wrong with making money from Youtube... and it's clearly a good incentive for creators. It just so happens that the platform fails sometimes and he's just highlighting an instance of it here...

Judging something by its popularity isn‚Äôt always great metric. It‚Äôs popular because it‚Äôs free. Like how soccer is the most popular sport in the world, because you just need a kickable object and you can play anywhere. But soccer sucks dick and I‚Äôd rather just sit in a chair and think than watch soccer. And the most popular songs are terrible pop songs. And the most popular television shows are scripted reality shows. And fortnite is also one of the most popular games, why? Because it‚Äôs free. Ok I think I made the point.

Is it crazy rare to have the middle one straight across?  Cause that is my path.

I did nothing but birdhouse runs and I got 79 hunter in a month.

Im sure many people would've watch him stream all 300 hours of catching those salamanders. He should look into that if youtube keeps screwing his revenue

u lucky fucker...
---
But you cannot equip angler until 34 fishing... And i dont think boosts count towards that. So its 34-99 but yeah i get what your saying i did trawler for the damn diary.
---
Mm I disagree, still way too low. Most popular OSRS videos get 400k views on average (Torvesta etc.). He can crank maybe three vids a week. So that‚Äôs $150 a week at most? That‚Äôs below the poverty line man.
---
YouTube monetization doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
I believe he was referring to his own comment and which really was petty and useless
---
They tend to include such important changes at the bottom of every week's news posts.
---
Ironmen can raid with other players. He's saying they shouldn't be able to
---
You realize without content creators there would be no YouTube right? They literally keep that platform running. You might also be able to call them.. *employees*. Do you not want to incentivize the people that keep your business running?
---
There's nothing that can stand in his way except The Fremmenik Trials.
---
But no bank tho
---
This is why he became a respected and high-up jmod in the first place, sort of like Ash.

Checkin' out.
---
Gz tho.
---
The only problem i see with it is the helm thats it everything else looks solid.
---
Did you even read the comment? Literally like a third if it is touching on this point
---
&gt; The other explanation often seen is that they have pressure from higher ups to force in these changes.  They do have the data showing a non-significant amount of players get partway into the elf/plague quests and just stop.  The team previously ran a poll offering a *skip* of the Underground Pass  based on this data and it failed.  We've since seen changes to other quests in the series that aren't Underground Pass enter the game.  Some people think there's some hidden agenda by Jagex to nerf all the elf quests.
---
If that really was the reason than like he said theyd push it as an integrity change if they *really* wanted it to stay. However they arent. As the community finds these changes they are reverting them to how they were before.
---
It doesnt make sense for them to revert the changes if their motive is to make the quest easier to keep players.
---
Your colegues are (cute) noobs. At least they tried

some thick sausage you got there mate..

It's like what B0aty usually says, "there's probably someone out there's who dominates every scene, we just dson't know about him due to a lack of public appearances"
---
Ôøº
---
Yeah, they have a faulty auto system in place and the mods rely way too much on it to deal with problems.
---
Look at bots and that much is extremely self-evident.
---
The policy hasn't changed, but if a mod finally decided to step in and quit being a lazy piece of hooplah, then more people would be getting banned. As of right now, they're being super selective about who they ban for what and I'd rather not be the example they make when and if they step back in.

Yeah, I specifically used levels you can‚Äôt equip it to prove a point. Most players won‚Äôt have this before level 50 and the difference saved between level 1 and 50 is only 2500xp. The only reason for trawler is the diary. I did it on release thankfully and afk‚Äôd it in 2 hours.

Why is the combat bracelet not part of the dragonstone armor set? Its a dragonstone bracelet.

He mentioned in a comment that YouTube is putting it in ‚Äúrestricted monetization‚Äù, but that said, that‚Äôs not what the tweet suggests. The tweet just looks like ‚Äúthis is all I get for 300 hours‚Äù which 100% comes off as ‚ÄúI want more money cause I put in more hours‚Äù which YouTube really shouldn‚Äôt care about. But his videos being restricted is an issue
---
What are other legit platforms that pay content creators reasonably and is as easy to use as YouTube? I cant think of any but I might just be out of the loop. I guess twitch maybe? But that's a totally different platform imo

I can provide more evidence if needed. Just want the account back. He's probably cleared my bank.

Can't unsee.  Its the Senate guard armor from the clone wars era of star wars...

imagine is just a concept if you add gems to the armour you can change it color to that gem color. And i get why they did the whole dragonstone armor coming from a crystal chest idea but i think that boring and unorginal copy of rs3 triskelon chest.

Would you show other earnings from your other videos? Maybe this is just an anomoly. Surely you will gain more money from this video for the rest of your life.
---
As an ironman, the melee divine pots are good for places like solo GWD, but realistically only Bandos/Zammy. At Sara/Arma you'll use brews so that's a no-go due to how the divine restore system works.
---
I'd use the divine ranged/magic at Zulrah to speed up kills until I had really good gear. At that point kills are already only 90-110 seconds long so why bother with the divine variants if the regular potions will barely decline anyhow.
---
Beyond that I'm not sure where to use them. For normies it makes sense to use them on Slayer as well. But it's probably not worth the time making them (especially seeing as they only give 2 XP each) on an ironman if you're just going to use it on Slayer.
---
My personal verdict is that they're good for different situations in bossing -- basically wherever you can get away with not bringing brews, you can use these.
---
The idea that a being exists who could end our suffering with the snap of his fingers but inexplicably chooses not to is FAR more terrifying than the idea that suffering is simply an incidental part of life that we all must deal with.

That's fair! I haven't watched his videos pre Swampletics (maybe one or two). I was basing it from the earlier videos in this series, which were the ones that as far as I know, made him popular.
---
Like they did to me üò≠
---
You not enjoying things a majority of people enjoy doesn't make your opinion more valid, it's subjective. Who the fuck cares if you don't like soccer, just go sit in a chair thinking about how much you hate anything that is popular for the sake of being different then.

Haven't played Runescape at all in a few years. Does Oldschool Runescape still have the Runescape 2 graphics options and other stuff introduced in Runescape 2 or are the only options Runescape 3 and Runescape 1 that style for the game is gone forever?
---
True, but Twitch is where the money is though. He has a big enough following where I believe the transition would be easy.
---
Don't play the game if you don't like it
---
seriously, what the fucks going on with all these unpolled, random changes.  Makes me curious as to what else they do without us noticing.
---
I prefer the double stacker
---
Theres nothing "arbitrary" here. You could say that every quest has an "arbitrary" amount of steps so why not make them all 3 steps long.
---
Ok cool thank you this is very doable. What else was in your inventory? (food? prayer pots? restore pots? etc.)
---
It's about the precedent this sets. No one is angry only because they changed a bit of text. They're angry that Jagex is going around changing old quests (**in ways that change the quest's difficulty**) and telling no one. Seriously, they could at least mention the changes on the main page. This should be obvious to anyone with at least a triple digit IQ, or someone who isn't just looking for any reason to put people down as "neckbeards".
---
Whose/what other 24 minute videos are you comparing yours to?
---
Quality over quantity probably isn't Youtube's monetisation strategy. I'd expect it's based on the amount of viewers you get, the subject matter of the video, how popular the genre generally is, how often you put up videos, etc.
---
&gt;you'reself

Thanks! Yeah, I was a bit surprised as well. Most gilded items have a margin of 100k+ and rings of nature often have 200k+. Flip those a few times a day and you got your 1.5 mil. Or that is how it was 2 months ago at least, I don't know about the current margins.

Same here. Been curious about massing since I‚Äôm shit at pking ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

been saying it for the past few years, content creators need to jump ship and let youtube sink, theres plenty of other video hosting sites that would just love a massive influx of content

I did accidentally flip a bond for 8 mill.

You have the audience, I‚Äôd start streaming if I were you from here on out. Listen I know you‚Äôre scared of spoilers but there‚Äôs two things you gotta realize 
---
1. People can‚Äôt watch you 24/7 so the videos will still be watched to see the story 
---
2. When you‚Äôre done with theatre of blood, what‚Äôs next? How are you gonna keep making money? If you were streaming regularly by that point, most likely, people will continue to watch whatever you do after TOB. That is also true with videos but man... wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to get fucking paid for those 300 hours of gametime? People would have watched you hunt swamp lizards the whole time and that wouldn‚Äôt have taken away from the last video IMO. You have your audience NOW so don‚Äôt miss the ticket to your own show

A dude crashed me at bandos a little while ago with a scythe and everything and an alt with justiciar and an ely to tank and then had the audacity to make fun of me for not having an inferno cape.

Needless to say we roasted the shit out of him for the next half hour
---
I like Jagexdad.
---
Yeah I replied to one of his comments telling him he should advertise it a bit more.
---
I had no idea he had one till this thread.
---
He does sell merch tho and has advertised his shirts a lot in previous videos.
---
I‚Äôm just hoping some people here will reconsider the type of players they associate themselves with. Also it‚Äôs against the rules to grief players sooooo....
---
That's a good story bro haha
---
Absolutely blows my mind seeing people do this shit on mobile, I can barely do farm runs
---
this is also my situation
---
As right as you are, Youtube doesn't give a fuck about you, and as we've seen with many many streamers/youtubers. you're putting your livelyhood into the hands of a corperation who doesnt give a shit about you, and you could be banned/demonetized/etc for something as simple as saying a 3 letter word.   
---
Maybe its smart to focus on other avenues of your financial life and make a career else where? it would suck to not get any more videos but you gotta do whats best for you man.
---
Greedy and entitled.... Why is this subreddit so ridiculous? 
---
Imagine working for 40 hours one week and getting paid for 10. Settled is even saying he has made more on other videos so it's obviously a YT error.

This subreddit loves drama really.

Exactly. The only thing that matters is watch time and ads watched. There‚Äôs no inherent special reward for putting more effort into the video
---
If torvesta uploads a 10 minute video from one night of pking, it‚Äôll get the same money as a 10 minute swamp video that took 45 days of grinding lol

YouTube isn‚Äôt forcing him to do this

Make a patreon. People will give you the money that they think you deserve directly, effectively cutting youtube and their shitty profit model out of the equation
---
Remember when people post videos before monetization? I miss those content creators, their shit is amazing. The Youtube that I love and miss. 
---
I do enjoy your videos and your content; and I know time has changed from the old times to monetization. I just want to say, keep your head up. Your work has been noticed many players and even developers to the points of getting rewards. Those rewards are also your ... Forgot the word...  portfolio and resum√© highlights. Keep pressing forward.

When will dogs have their day in OSRS?
---
This is why some content creators started to dip out of Youtube for revenue and generate some other way: Patreon, donations, streaming on Twitch and getting Partner, putting their content on their own personal website and putting ads on it, etc.
---
I remember this topic being brought up during a [Sleepycast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5i73-Udg4665ybe6BxlzYA?disable_polymer=1) episode. There's just no future in YouTube unless you make it super big and pump out 10-minute videos like it's a third job. Anything that takes tons of time and effort towards a single video - like an animation in their case, for example - is completely inefficient if you're in it for the money.
---
I‚Äôd suggest finishing 99 fm at WT for some decent cash although it‚Äôs a grind the pay out would be great with the stats you have.
---
&gt;maxing an account is effectively just a gateway to the 'real' content.
---
If I wanted that I'd resub to wow. The best thing about osrs to me is that in my entirety of over 15 years total playing the game Ive never had a single 99 but I've never felt a lack of content to do for my levels and I always have a goal to strive for.

How many did he sell though? If he had 500 t shirts at a $10 profit margin (which may even be high), that's $5k. That's not a ton in the grand scheme.

I got a challenge scroll from him no problem when I did it yesterday or two days ago
---
I am not a fan of an update like this, its a similar effect to pet hunting, where more items drastically enter the game because of the boss getting camped.
---
Pet hunting is enough, don't need highscores as well.

I imagine they'd be around 10m

yikes dude, god bless adblock
---
He streamed before Swampletics on Settled. I don't know why he gave up the platform for the time being but he probably has a good reason for it.
---
I'll also add that (and Im guilty of this, sorry Swamp Lettuce) that a TON of people use ad-blockers. I don't know the intricacies of monetization, but I would imagine it puts a dent in the amount that 1.6 million viewed ads would have brought.
---
Edit: I looked again at the image he posted and noticed it would, in the end, have amounted to maybe $200 if the math is really that simple and if everyone had watched every ad. 
---
That's bogus.
---
Honestly that account is so much cooler with 1 thieving than being playable
---
And that just shows why many creators do talk about their patreon, or tell people to like and subscribe, in every video, because it works and people wouldn't know about it/do it without bringing it up regularly.
---
Jeeze reading his responses is like watching a train wreck happen
---
So prices don‚Äôt rise I assume. The more money in game means the more things will go up in price. Also vice verse if there are more of one item in game the cost will decrease.  This is only what I think idk why others would want a gold sink.

While I do believe a desert update is needed, I would love for a Desert Grandmaster quest featuring the Mahjarrot (I think thats how its spelled?) potentially opening doors to something like Raids 3: Catacombs of _______.
---
Upvoted simply because of the name.
---
Buy some of his Merch if you wanna help, folks. It helps him AND you get something out of it.
---
The fact of the matter is that while his content is fantastic, it's content made for and viewed by a relatively small fanbase. If YouTube is deliberately throttling him somehow, then yeah that's bull shit. But otherwise, don't expect a big payday from a small amount of viewers. Yes 200k views is incredibly small when it comes to YouTube.
---
I'm so confused, is this real? Half the people react like it's real and half like it's not on all of these posts of him.
---
Yup! I specifically called that guy an incel because he used the word cunt, and not because he is a well-known shitbag that this sub harbors.   
---
Well done lad, you've cracked the code.
---
Most merch pays the creator a very tiny percentage of the overall price after everyone else's costs and profits get taken out. If you're only looking to support them, patreon or even twitch are far better options.
---
Poll it

You are not being greedy in any way, shape, or form for wanting to be paid for the amazing content you create. The guy that said you should start streaming is right.  Plenty of people would love to watch you do anything and everything that you do and would gladly watch the video afterwards.  Keep up the good work!
---
Unfortunately YouTube career alone isn't good enough income for living. That's why some people uses sponsors to increase that income.
---
Really. Did you do anything specifically when you teleported?
---
You've gotta stream, brotha. That is how you directly monetize your 300 hours.
---
So in 50 kills you got MVP 48 times? Are these solos or something?
---
It‚Äôs been known for 2 years and brought it up on an older post. Report the bug and let jagex know but I think cyclops can only be damaged by melee.
---
I don‚Äôt get it.

Yeah I ended up maxing on RS3 (which is not good enough anymore for that game). Dark times indeed, might even still be playing it if OSRS was not around.

For real you can get laptops at a fraction of the price of a phone nowadays

What did he mean by this?

Sorry for the confusion, I meant solely mining the ore not the actual shard drops from zalcano. When mining the ore you have a chance to get a shard, this is what I was referring to.

Dude even if it was 1$/1k views he got robed there lol

Again, what?? Nobody said anything about reporting, you asked for help and advice and he asked for your IGN to help you in game??  I get you‚Äôre not very good with English, but it seems like you‚Äôre not making any effort. Also for such bad English, you have the slurs down pretty good /s

The original FoG minigame can't be added to osrs. Mod Ash once tweeted that its only possible to make a new minigame with the rules but with other graphics.
---
I disagree, I think it makes the activity much more enjoyable. I do however disagree with how the current loot system. The update I'd love to see would be keeping 1.5 ticking as a mechanic, but making it not punish other players by creating a point system, and giving loot based on points.
---
Rigour and max ranged?
---
That's fine, I dont think anyone plays osrs for the graphics
---
size of fanbase is irrelevant to advertisers. They care about number of views on the video, and the demographics of those viewers. 200k is "small" sure, but making less than $1 per 1000 views of a 20+ minute video with midroll ads enabled a fraction of average, and Settled made $0.50/1000 views.

Imagine being trapped in a dark, dank, stanky dungeon of a room all day that you have to use dark mode because regular white background hurts your eyes too much. That's you.
---
I agree but it‚Äôs kinda the nature of the content he makes. Hopefully he can get his Patreon running well or have sponsored videos. Gaming content (especially niche gaming content) doesn‚Äôt really get too much in the way of ad revenue I would imagine. I think you‚Äôd find that other YouTubers have the same problem but they don‚Äôt spend so much time on their videos.

Will devalue Bloodhoud pet from Masters.  Kacey would riot.

Reposting my own comment from another thread:  
---
~~MMK is pretty mediocre at a lot of technical aspects of the game but he‚Äôs got a funny personality and is kind of like the OSRS dad streamer. People are lovingly poking fun at him by putting his facecam over impressive gameplay to make it seem like he‚Äôs much better at the game than he actually is.~~

JK he‚Äôs a fucking beast with a huge cock and max cash

If you are quitting over Biohazard you are not going to last long anyway.
---
&gt; YouTube in itself non-directly promotes these scuff videos by not allowing other good ones to be successful.
---
Yup. I wouldn't say "not allowing", but it is the end result anyway.
---
YouTube could change their algorithm to make the site healthier overall. Rather than focusing on short term watch time, it should have a weighting against these clickbaity videos. I think that would be a good thing for YouTube financially in the long-term.
---
Idk how much faster you could pick herbs/allotments tbh. Would be pretty useless. (If this is a serious post)

I guess yeah, I posted it there too
---
I don't think a new skill will ever pass tbh. People are too split on what type of skill they want. A skill can be really well thought out, useful, and balanced, but will still get too many no voters because they don't like Gathering/Lap/buyable/bankstanding/minigame, etc. Type of skill.
---
There's too many variables to why someone wouldn't like a proposed skill, regardless of how good the idea is

Edgeville is known as honor because you abide by certain guidelines when you fight. The pking style found in edgeville wouldnt work without it. The basics are no safing (eating at high hp), no style protection prayers, and no farcasting (freezing the opponent and fighting at a distance).  
---
Theres also hybridding, sometimes called main bridding, where you use just mage and melee. Rules are no range and no style protection prayers. 
---
No honor is basically anywhere else in singles. There are no rules to follow. Anything goes. Most people will also call this tribridding because using 3 styles is the most optimal hence the most common.

Ohh thank you! I kept left clicking

When you own all of the barriers to entry you are considered a monopoly.
---
Here are the roadblocks:
---
1. Searching out viable alternatives to Youtube is universally run through Google.
---
2. Assuming you make it past pre-revenue you'll need a ad platforms, the biggest and best is also owned by Google, Adsense.
---
3. Hosting is pretty much universally owned by Amazon, AWS. Likely will have trouble getting a good deal to scale to the size of Youtube.
---
4. Google literally has so much cash on hand that even if you were getting to the tipping point of taking over Youtube, Google would just pump so much money into content creators pockets with an agreement that they won't upload anywhere else your site will just die.

i think he will not do any help if  he knew my name in game sir
---
Please don't. Streaming destroys everything. Best case scenario we end up getting "voice over clips" (boaty, mudkip).
---
Been playing on and off since 2002 and never had a 99, i think its part of the reason the game has such an appeal to it, reaching the top is a true struggle and test of determination, even at the fastest xp rates any given skill is still going to take many many hours of grinding it out to reach 99
---
It's all about sponsors and twitch donations these days... The adpocalypse happened long ago. Why are you surprised by this?
---
I‚Äôm glad he made it. Hopefully mods will see it and fix it. He definitely doesn‚Äôt advocate for it
---
i remember seein you at the ge doing this
---
I personally would be fine with him taking sponsors, especially given this fiasco.  I just hope he'd take something he actually uses and not shill out
---
Sad to say, gamers don't make much money for the time invested. Its one of the most time intensive careers and passions with near 0 return. Meanwhile, you get people in government offices that make $200-500k/yr and do nothing.
---
Hybridding is usually used for mage/melee bridding that you see in edgeville. Tho the term has overlap.
---

Alternatively it just leads to some kind of lure or drop items scam. "I'll give you the 75m if you do these things first, including dropping your 50m on the ground and/or following me to the wilderness"
---
It's Caped Baldy!
---
You really should push your patreon more and not feel ashamed about doing so. YouTube is very unreliable for a multitude of reasons. You are working against their algorithm of preferred daily uploads that are shorter. This project requires a larger time to be how you like it and it's clear it's what people want. Patreon can mean you can stick to doing things the same way and still have the financial security to do so.
---
That's true. However, that random doesn't spawn in wilderness. I use max volume sound effects when fishing crabs, and that's where drunken dwarf whistle gets really annoying.
---
Pornhub probably has a bit more than 432k hours worth of porn, yes. Probably a few orders of magnitude more, I'd say. But it is still far lower than YouTube.

Still a semi-viable option though. It would cut the audience quite significantly, but still.

Nah these were in 7/8 man ffa's, that's my point though, I barely ever get mvp.

it looks ridiculous and doesn't fit at all
---
that said i still want it.
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. The ‚Äúit‚Äôs a non intended bug‚Äù is a non argument seeing that it has already been confirmed that the person that implemented a lot of these changes added them because they thought the questions in the poll would pass, and snuck them into the game update. 
---
They removed this person from the team, but clearly did not double check what he had added/done.

Yeah i got that far but wait what, hentai, what???

Gargoyles or brutal black dragons would be your best bet, obviously you could grind for the rune drags but you can still make decent gp/hr if your doing brutals

DESERT TREASURE 2 WHEN
---
i just did plague city - biohazard - underground pass on a new acc yesterday and the changes are quite massive
---
plague city - holds your hand more throughout, but not anything significant
---
biohazard - another rotten apple spawn has been added. you can actually just teleport to rimmington and then varrock with the plague sample and it won't break LOL. they've fixed the telegrabbing the other 3 liquids. Doctor's gown has been changed to "Medical gown" for whatever reason. 
---
underground pass (33 agility) - firstly it now offers a prompt before letting you start the quest if you're below 40 agility, but if you choose to continue it will still let you start it. you can now get any amount of damp cloth by just entering a number of how many you want. they've also patched the flat rock traps, so you can no longer just click on the other side when next to it. same thing with wall traps. blocks on certain kill-once npcs within the caves, after you've progressed (the paladins, the demons etc.). 
---
the catwalk part now has permanent checkpoints, so if you fall down at any point after the 1st side ramp you will fall back to that same ramp instead of previous if you fall at the first narrow point on the return (tl;dr: it be easier).
---
the jumps in the main cavern have been buffed, i only fell 4 times in total w/ 33 agil boosted with summer pies, 3 of them for the first jump and since then only had 1 fall. minimap guides have been added for the area. all items regarding iban's doll have been removed as objects and are instantly applied to the doll as soon as you complete the subpart. kalrag seemed a lot easier to aggro, it stole aggro from a small spider. the iban's temple now has a one-off introduction with a simple 5 second cutscene showing the location of it when you get in vicinity of it. 
---
dumping the doll into the well has been made a separate cutscene (also allows you to have a ringslot item on, at least thats the only thing i tested and it worked) -  iban will have a forced monologue before the groundspikes activate and once your playerstall is removed you will be able to just click the doll on the well and avoid all damage &amp; complete the part.
---
all in all, agility based checks seemed more lenient, however it might just be some good rng on my part. some previous tricks and damage avoids have been patched.
---
extra: 
---
starting regicide is now as easy as just talking to king lathas - no longer have to wait for the king's messenger. you still do not need the 56 agility requirement to start it.
---
One observation from your second theory is that if jagex runs like any other business(I've been out of touch with all of the changes so I am just speculating) the 'higher ups' at a certain level have no idea what goes into each quest. If they were all developers then maybe but the higher ups possibly haven't ever even 'played' the game
---
I pretty much hang around at the GE on W1 and W2 24/7 (where most of the scammers/bots/spammers are) and I'm always sitting here thinking "I wish I could mute these fools".

 I don‚Äôt see a problem with it.
---
No no, not random ofcourse. There need to be a little team or something that manages the P-mods. If there isn't already such a thing... I would really appreciate a J-mod reply on this thread, clearing up how to become a P-mod and what they can do, etc.

yea i could see that happening but he also says he just wants it for gear so he can build up to a tbow, we had also been drinking the night he chucked it and he was feeling lucky.

Does a patreon exist? If not I‚Äôm sure people are willing to support settled outside of just watching the videos

Except that jagex can see poll results internally and could see it was failing so that excuse doesn‚Äôt hold up.

Why can they just allow it to be installed via the play store, I'm not familiar with Linux at all and don't have the time to mess around with custom software. I just hope they add full ChromeOS compatibility.
---
Yet they don‚Äôt know mtx doesn‚Äôt exist on irons xd
---
Then give us the flag! We pay we CA.
---
I think it should be scaled to ingame time that your playing and only while a member/in members world. Otherwise it would screw over people that take breaks.
---
Osrs socks is actually the key authority at jagex in respects to this
---
I don't even think ultimate is an option on rs3.

Have u seen his nh pk. Insane

Clicking SFX very nice, it's evolving
---
This fucking guy definitely faked his jad deaths now that i think abt it
---
/u/SettledRS listen to this guy. The only downside to this is that you're going to have to be entertaining people the whole time you stream instead of being afking or semi-afking..
---
Tbh if they stopped at the first summoning batch in January it would've been balanced. All the initial BoBs had half their current space and titans didn't exist.
---
My skill suggestion was; bath water selling.
---
No, that's not really the point. It's certainly not the point Swampletics made in his Twitter post. His point was that his video was put as "limited advertisements" or whatever it's called. Basically, unsafe content. Meaning he was paid a lot less than what 400k should pay. Like less than 10%.
---
If you make the best video in the world and only get 500 views, then you should obviously be paid for only 500 views. That's just the monetisation aspect, which is completely unrelated to the algorithm. In your hypothetical case, the monetisation has succeeded if you get paid what 500 views should pay, but the algorithm has utterly failed because it only awarded "the best video in the world" with 500 views. That's what I'm trying to argue here. That the algorithm is set up for clickbait videos rather than quality content. That's why a lot of animators have left over the years and why the trending page is garbage now.
---
Not officially, but there are unofficial series like Maikeru's
---
I haven't had a mule banned in probably a year. Idk i just trade my stuff over and if i do receive bans i just keep going. My bots barely get banned.
---
You are wildly uninformed of how much an established youtube creator should get paid.
---
If this video were paid properly for 1.6 million views, he should have been paid around $4,000 for it. So really he should have been paid 80x the $50 he got. This does not even factor into the equation that this was a long video with what, 4 ads on it? So feel free to multiple that 4,000 by 2 or 4x for how much the vid *should* have made.
---
That is how bad it is when you get  flagged for restricted.
---
I remember the times pet Kree'arra sounded like a hurricane coming by if it loaded onto your screen
---
No thanks

You get the dog, but they put a new placeholder stray dog in its place after you finish the quest. Maybe it‚Äôs sad and whimpering because you took it‚Äôs only friend.
---
The oldschool design looks so much more like oldschool runescape, the new faces in song of the elves look so rs3, and the dragonstone armor looks exactly like rs3s regular rune armor
---
Watched with adblock
---
The absolute madman
---
It's why we need to give him some patreon love. 1% of his viewerbase throwing $1 a month his way will make him wayyyyy more money than ad revenue. For all the effort he puts in I don't have a problem doing it
---
Damn they basically ban waved all mine at once. To be fair tho it‚Äôs been years. And I‚Äôm pretty sure I had them all on the same ip. So prolly my fault.
---
Hi, been playing and loving OSRS mobile casually for months (honestly wouldn't play at all otherwise, never have enough PC time), and was hoping to build up a little bit of money from the Google Opinion Rewards surveys to pay for the odd bond here and there, but have run into trouble. Is it possible to do it at all?
---
Annoyingly I have two Google accounts and in my non-existant wisdom only linked the second one to Opinion Rewards, and RuneScape always defaults to my other account for payment. However, even if I totally remove that account from my phone to force RuneScape into using my other account for payment, the Opinion Rewards balance is nowhere to be seen in my payment options, just all my cards üòû Anyone else had similar? I swear I managed it once in the early mobile days, have they just stopped you from being able to do it?
---
Buy bonds
---
Bitchute gets around the cost of hosting, we'll see if it becomes a viable alternative.

Does Sween work with Weath or something?
---
Yeah. I'm not into watching streamers, personally, but the fact is, you make monumentally more money streaming.
---
But they aren't smithed, they're enchanted to be those tools. Doesn't make any sense lore wise.
---
In my dreams yeah üôÉ
---
It's illegal to purposefully undercut competition at a loss in order to drive them out of business and then ramp up prices. YouTube literally can't make a profit after trying. Nobody else wants to try or has a viable way to make a profit. Then if you do have a good platform, there's the problem of having to get people there in the first place.
---
Definitely not mine but Jesus they do
---
I get your point... Apparently there are around 1600 of them today, I wonder how much of them are 'known' people.
---
Same. Picked up the light blue, which I don't recall seeing about a month or two ago when I was going to buy one.
---
Every gather able skill had bots,
---
I hate to nitpick but people literally said its hard itt
---
Not my original. But yes. Yes indeed
---
The point isn't about how long he spent on the video
---
It's the fact he got an incredibly low amount of money for the views and ads that were on his video
---
What a loser smh
---
I mean, if you're looking to make money, I wish you all the best but expect nothing - norovitch blew up via Facebook when bodgeups and the first wave were burning out, the American crowd got in tight with Evike and did crossover with the node/corridor lot, unless you can replicate that you're gonna struggle.

volcanic mine to 99 beats every non tick manipulation method by a longshot

But he doesn't even hold the record to win the 2 available right now :)
---
He mentioned in an update video a few months back that he already has ideas lined up for future series after Swampletics.
---
&gt; Getting rid of kids off the platform wouldn't make YouTube give more money to high effort content creators and that's a weird position to even have
---
I'm genuinely baffled as to how you could have interpreted my post that way.

I definitely would NOT call hcim High level content ‚Äúsome of the most watched content on twitch.‚Äù In the runescape section, sure. But not overall twitch. Just wanted to throw that out there.
---
BIRDHOUSES and wintertodt(keep farming below 56 to hoard mad mahogany for xp or get 60+ for gp)
---
Mine six two
---
I wish I screenshot my favorite notification. It was a hcim getting the first 99 ability then immediately killing his character.
---
Except 90% of the shit on Youtube is low effort. Why would I "want to try it" when my whole point is its a shitty "career"
---
Its amazing that they would wait weeks to finally try something... Began playing in like 2010 and in that time ive learned to not trust anything a damn person says on rs lmao
---
Why would you take away my favorite beverage?
---
Lol
---
While that's true, is the payout here actually low because he had low viewer count? 400k views is damn respectable.
---
The problem is that people who put a lot of work into content don't get paid much by YouTube, and you were saying that problem is because of children on the platform. What else would you mean?
---
But I put effort into it so I must be paid for it
---
How are you finding the MSB over the Rcbow

ZMI on mobile?

He said t5 1/700 chance t10 1/100 and t5 could still be bought from players via getting killed in the wilderness

This is coming up a lot but honestly guys would you really watch a stream? Swanpletics YouTube videos are amazing, but part of why they are amazing is the insane grinds that settled does. Do you really want to watch a stream of 300 hours of catching green swamp lizards?
---
Steamed hams
---
Im sure they dont take pmod away without reason so alot of them could be inactive.
---
He‚Äôs essentially a fluffer for content creators now
---
What staff is that?
---
We actually have no idea whether YouTube is profitable now. Its revenue and operating costs are both insanely high, but Alphabet has never given us actual numbers. There's also no reason to believe that YouTube isn't profitable as of recent.
---
And also dealing with people knowing his location and trolling him, potentially spoiling the spirit of the show.
---
I turn off adblock on YouTube specifically so they can get adsense from me. It's literally free to support your favorite creators
---
Should be 3 ticking on multiple accounts. Smh

Oh yeah, I don't even want to think about it

It's a sad state of affairs, my guy. Look at oil companies, airlines, cable/ISPs, etc. Much of that shit should be broken up.

I can‚Äôt wait for Runelite to publish some sweet plugins for things like this for North the Gauntlet and Zolcano.

Let‚Äôs hope Jagex allows at least a few

RSHD was the beginning of the end. The graphics are one of the quintessential aspects of OSRS and to try to 'improve' them would only be a mistake.

tpu was there
---
Dang now he‚Äôs gunna get banned for player harassment.
---
Yea, rargh and asukayen have good guides
---
Yeah, the town crier in draynor (possibly any town crier) will tell you more about it. But basically he just says have full account security settings enabled and give Jagex useful misconduct reports.
---
Are we done being punished for warding yet. 
---
Do you really think people who do the same thing for 8 hours straight and have 3 accounts each wouldn‚Äôt notice this lmao
---
Isn‚Äôt blast mining an option too? Good balance of gp and exp
---
I'm not a huge fan of your series but your work ethic is unmatched and I have to give you credit for that.
---
Die less+cheap gear = SLAYER GAINZ = GP GAINZ
---
Great explanation. Now we have NMZ to launch everyone into 80+ all combat stats and wikis, so everyone hits like a truck.

Again you‚Äôre missing the point, he knows this, but he just wants the correct amount of money he should be getting
---
If I had the choice I would have just had two maxed pure/main accounts with all quests/diaries done and just do PvP.  The grind and skilling have absolutely no appeal to me, and I'm sure that is the case with many other players. The notion that "the entire point of the game is grinding until you can afford to buy end game items" is not everyone's mindset.
---
You're welcome for the education.
---
If you work harder at it, you should get a better reward, mvp means most valuable person, I e person who did the most. Pet should be obtainable to other people and non mvps should get better loot than what they do now. After that it'll be balance at least imo
---
I would call this fair because he‚Äôs not maximizing his possibilities and he didn‚Äôt spend 1000 hours editing that video. 
---
He put in over 1000 hours of effort then released one video, didn‚Äôt stream, didn‚Äôt put out a spoiler. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong his videos are great but If he is trying to make a living off of YouTube by releasing one 20 minute video every 2 months he‚Äôs doing it wrong.
---
I have one actually :) it's in the description of every video but it's pretty far down there

I'll check it out when I get home. You should plug it more in your videos.

some people used to, and the name stuck

Torvesta has 3x the monthly views because he puts out more videos.
---
Start streaming I just read the guy under you. 100% agree.
---
That‚Äôs our meme you dip. Everyone in this sub has seen this a million times over.
---
Make a new account and don't be toxic this time if you want to be able to talk
---
The reality of the situation is that long high effort content has been blatantly unprofitable on youtube for 5 years+, all animators quit because of that. You can make a ton of money streaming, though.
---
Petition for Saitama pet. 1/10000 chance for one hitting monsters

11 uniques, aside from jar and pet, at 2850kc is also insanely unlucky man, i feel for you
---
With that whole meme going on idek if this real or not lmao. Did I fell for the meme????
---
We all know YouTube doesn‚Äôt care about the time put in, so why is it ‚ÄúI made $50 on a video that took 300 hours‚Äù? In another comment he made on here he broke it down to ‚Äò16 cents per hour‚Äô.  Could you not see hat for yourself? I think we all would be on his side if he just pointed out ‚Äú$50 for 117k views is low‚Äù but the fact he‚Äôs using his hours put in like it‚Äôs suppose to matter is what‚Äôs causing the divide with some people.
---
When I'm doing shop-shit it takes just a few minutes to buy 5 then value, buy 5 then value and continue down to the point of break even. 
---
So then from that point I know, buy any rune in stock until stock reaches XYZ for example.
---
I have never been "toxic" or mean to anyone on runescape? I always minded my own business
---
That's what you get for voting no to warding.
---
Don't forget the charge cost too. Not sure how much those shards are valued at currently, but it would probably not be that great. Though there is always room for a special spade from elsewhere.
---
Yeah if that was true you wouldn't have been perm muted
---
Oof xD nvm then
---
Okay Bernie Sanders.
---
People keep comparing him to Torvesta. Torvesta has over 3x the monthly views as Settled because he makes more video. I‚Äôm not saying one works harder than the other, but you have to put out more content to get more money.
---
I guess I'll do my part and pause ad block ONLY on his videos
---
As Jagex would say my man, there are no exceptions for self restricted accounts... lol
---
Correct quote ‚Äúwanting more than 16 cents per hour isn‚Äôt greedy‚Äù... so ya, tell me more about how you missed the hours playing a part.
---
thermy
---
That's the thing I dont know how I got muted. When i click on the evidence thing it just says severe advertising or something I've never advertised anything on runescape.
---
Toolbelt takes away tons of the challenges that rs3 brings

PLEASE advertise your patreon!

Makes sense, I was wondering too if the fact he uploads so inconsistently and low frequency has something to do with unfavorable ads placement

Yes. f2p is basically a free trial. Membership unlocks most of the world, most items, a lot of skills, and most quests.

can you boost for this quest? and geez herb and construction are going to be expensive...

Not anymore sadly.

My mistake then, when you said ‚Äúadvertised as if it was offensive‚Äù I thought you were saying it WAS restricted.

Which is kinda dumb cause kids don‚Äôt buy shit anyway
