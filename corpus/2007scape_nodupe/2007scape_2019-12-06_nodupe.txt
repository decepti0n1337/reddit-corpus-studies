88% isn't 881 loot potential though, it's quite a bit higher. 
---

---
You want 86.9% iirc
---
---
---
i am an RN in a cardiac icu that takes cares of adults after open heart surgery; such as CABGs. Fantastic to see you extubated and weaned to room air after going through all that. 
---
On the other side of the spectrum, when my patients and their families don't do well due to complications from surgery, OSRS helps me chill out and relax after a tough day at work.  
---
still not as bad as runecrafting though

Das macht mich angepisst
---
Not working on my Galaxy S10e nor my iPad mini
---
At 881/1012 loot potential you can receive bolt racks, which are worth significantly less than the runes you would otherwise get at 880 and below. 
---
Therefore you want to stay under 880/1012 which is ~86.9%, though I think Runelite's rounding may show a different number
---
That's fair

Hahah you came at the right time, nothing but moles in this sub rn

just go to the timeframe shown in the link

You clearly dont speak it.

Yes

If you look at the wiki code it includes the uniques into the average loot per kill.
---
All at the same time üò≥üò≥üò≥Ôºü

U can‚Äôt log in on the site because it‚Äôs made on Game Center!! This is soo frustrating
---
Now you can keep it somewhere other than your keychain

some of the most popular british streamers/youtubers did a charity stream and played osrs as a part of it

This is innovation

Gratz bro!!! You must be one happy dude :)
---
runescape is some fine wine
---
The best sort!

Same for me. Works for my friend though so it seems to vary.
---
Mine worked this morning but now it‚Äôs down again like last night wtf
---
They're all missing their obby capes
---
Keep AFK fishing sharks at work all the way to 99, get 85 attack, level to 99 defence through Slayer, 83 Construction and a few other bits and bobs. :)
---
learn spawn rotations (there are 15 in total) so you dont have to improvise lure on 1 def.

Yes, this is exactly the same experience I've had with the mobile account! Since the servers treat emails as strings instead of unique identifiers, you can have several account linked to a single email. And if you create an account with mobile, there is some weird woodoo stuff that can alter the default mail that is used. Maybe, you were logged out of google account back then when the issue manifested or sth.  
---
Glad to hear that your issue is partially resolved!  
---
Personally, I'd suggest you stick to logging via runescape account to avoid similar issues.
---
Who hurt you?
---
what the actual fuck.
---
This dude got Dharock bombed for a 99 but had a ring of life, glad to see you‚Äôre doing well!
---
just buy from a gold seller site, its cheaper and jagex doesnt care about rwters anyways
---
What math are you doing lol. 3 years = 1095 days (365*3) and 1095*100 = 109.5k and the dude has 121k zulrah kc..so it would be more than 100 a day even.
---
That's what they're there for :P
---
Even more nutty when you realize that its over 17b in profit.
---
I give up
---
Damn man lucky your rng was on point! Awesome to hear.
---
Ya imagine having the moral battle of either letting the economy of the game you have sunk so much time and love into fall apart or ban people who are just trying to feed themselves
---
Wow, I did not need this in my life
---
A month of play time = 8500 irl dollars if 1b = 500 USD.

Copper longtails are level 9+, you can catch crimson swifts at level 1

The need for the pizzas need to be above 30%

I miss the in game events that drop discontinued items..such as p hats, Santa's, masks, even the untradables like scythe and bunny ears..but nowadays we live in a "everyone gets a trophy for participating" society that to many people bitch and moan over it. In a video game, its even more annoying having that attitude.
---
just fuck me up now
---
Welp, every world is always in the red for pizzas haha. Thanks for the info!
---
well, time to commit beastiality
---
sweet
---
Thank fuck I buy them in bulk
---
 It still blows my mind how they neglect things like this unless there is an outrage about it. Only seen a couple of the accounts disappear from the high scores, because people are calling out obvious bots on reddit and other social media. Either way thanks to the mod who made this update happen.
---
Weird that it works after the fix and then stops working again :(
---
Just want to do my farm runs during breaks at work
---
i dont mind untradable discontinued items, for that flex on people that never got it.
---
I have the wrong job.
---
Average Zulrah time is probably more like 90 seconds though.  
---
I highly doubt any of those people get even remotely close to 180 seconds.
---
Are you on your period?
---
I was deflating the numbers to include bank travel time.
---
Yes. I believe its closer to 6m they go for (check GE)
---
What is this?
---
Amanda Seyfried in Ahrims cracks me up lmfao
---
Or you can click on the people disagreeing with those who are memeing and you can see their political allegiance in their posts or their xhe/xer bullshit like I did.

How about from an unofficial merch store?
---
Swipes up your bank and moves to a different country.
---
Wait wut, the yogscast played osrs?
---
Treating it like a full-time job with 40 hours a week, maxing would take about a year and a half. But exp rates at 99 are usually pretty great, so it shouldn't take more than 10 years total to get 200m in every skill. 100k a year isn't bad honestly, so if you could get paid over time it would be pretty good, but if you had to finish before getting paid it would be ass.
---
I probably wouldn't do it myself, I don't like osrs enough to max my own account as is.
---
Let's be honest though 42fight1192 is most likely a bot.
---
All I heard was "btw"
---
Barrows?
---
Where can you get teak bow?
---
The pets are enough imo
---
So glad to hear you‚Äôre okay brother. Keep bobbing and weaving!!
---
Jagex Bad
---
Not the worst idea I‚Äôve heard, it would be a cape that is purely on chance though some people might spend a few months and some a few years.
---
Starting over is most of the fun tbh üòÅ
---
cry more i hope you have fun in mithril tier where you belong you fkn child
---
Before I enlarged the thumbnail I thought it was a lava lamp.
---
I'm actually going for pet rn.. and yes, EHB is 33-35ish, while doing woox walk and totally foccused. But i hard doubt someone can went totally foccused in these amount of kills.
---
No quest reviews we need full length episodes!
---
Why are all my bois still killing skeletons for looting bags when they should be pking?? Legit everyday i have to listen to people bitching about rng and bags. We were able to buy them indirectly with coins for so long.. when can we expect a fix?? I am going to loose my mind when i run out of bh1 points :(
---
Yes, if you didn't know how the combat triangle works, u shouldn't be playing this game.
---
Good thing you brought those 2 ring of life with you man. Truely happy your doing well. Was hoping you would post again.
---
Take care buddy
---
Didn‚Äôt want a lot of peeps to add me so I didn‚Äôt wanna make it copy and pasteable
---
Relic choices?
---
LOL
---
Sucks but it's just a game no big deal.
---
Any regrets on your relic choices?
---
I'm debating is it worth spending $11~ dollars for a month of membership, or grinding out 11m just to spend it all to play another month.
---
When I can make double that in an hour of work it doesn't really make sense anymore.
---
Anyone have any tips that got them over the hump when it comes to learning to Woox Walk at Vorkath with the lance? 
---
Used a few video guides and I keep thinking I'm doing it correctly (click away from him, 2 fireballs, click on him, 2 fireballs, repeat) but then I get killed anyway. Died like 7 times in a row and I'm considering going back to just pacing back and forth like I did with BGS+blowpipe
---
No thanks
---
Instant millionaire baby ü§ë
---
yeah i would. id grind it out with my brother and be pretty much set
---
His claws are sweaty
---
"100k a year isn't bad honestly"
---
Yeah I'm going to have to agree on that one
---
Harssshhh. I deffo would've fallen for this lmao
---
It's easy to miss them for selfish purposes though. Just for being present during an event, we'd get a "participation trophy" of an eventually discontinued item that might be worth mils/bils years down the line. Literally just for participating. So it goes both ways.
---
The participation trophy system we voted for benefits everyone equally in that nothing becomes unobtainable. The participation trophy system we left behind only benefits merchers and people who were around.
---
Dinhs if anything, I‚Äôve only gained 7m do since I got it and trying to stay on the front page of total level means I don‚Äôt really have time to sit at Wt for long, although it did help me make a lot of ranarrs so I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the worse
---
3x hardcore harvester, had 2 pieces of angler when I got my triple tench.
---
I see, interesting. How up to date are those displayed values?
---
You should probably extend them though, especially if bursting. Slaughter braces too.
---
Actually kind of a cool concept‚Äî‚ÄúRoving Ragger‚Äù Wildy boss. He‚Äôd hunt players in single way combat zones, with infinite run energy, and he‚Äôd aggro any player he finds and tribrid death match (players can obviously try to escape). He‚Äôd start in rag gear, and have shitty switches, but If he kills a player, he‚Äôd consume whatever items weren‚Äôt protected, at alch value or some other determined rate, and obtain gear upgrades when a certain consumed value was obtained. As he consumes more value, not only would his gear improve, but so would his tribrid skills, but also his drop table would improve. Idk what would be on the table but thought it would be a dope concept. Before the ragger gets any kills, he‚Äôd have shitty drops and be relatively easy to kill for someone with any form of tribrid experience, but at later tiers he‚Äôd be very difficult to kill and provide higher rewards. Idk just spitballing.
---
It's time.
---
90 herb is not a requirement and good temas raid in in sub 18 min with prescouts so ther is no downtime in between raids. Hell sub 18 is really slow 15 min is pretty doable.
---
Just so everyone knows it takes 23968.95 efficient hours played to get 200m all on an iron or 11.5 years of full time playing the game efficiently.
---
tfw irons dont even realize rdt drops dont even matter lol
---
Don't joke about domestic violence. 
---
"Oh no an internet stranger called out my getting offended for the sake of getting offended and hurt my precious little feelings" you can fuck right off with that bullshit
---
Listening to the sounds is super handy, definitely do that if you're not already. And then you just listen and click on every second fireball, or you can do the same method as with blowpipe and vorkath -&gt; away -&gt; vorkath -&gt; away on every fireball. I find it more chill to click every 2nd fireball though and let your character walk a little further away, but it does take a little time to get it into your head to not click every tick. Hope that helps!
---
20 comments in and no one has mentioned justiciar. Looks like we‚Äôve turned a corner. Well done everyone.
---
Glad you liked it! I would check out the rest of his stuff pre-2009 he makes music still but it‚Äôs basically techno, not my style
---
Please do start uploading videos. I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to watch streams myself, but I have looked for content from you before, since what you‚Äôre doing is so unique and I wanted to follow along. I think it was after hearing you on J1mmy‚Äôs podcast, or did you appear in some of TurtleTale‚Äôs stuff? Either way, would love to see some content from you.
---
you could try the normal bp tempo but just click twice in each spot
---
Can someone tell me how I activate the trial membership? Vant seem to find it. Thx

JMods don't read this thread, try the Q&amp;A thread posted weekly on Mondays/Tuesdays depending on your timezone.

The all time daily peak is just since the wiki has been recording that stat. It was almost definitely higher when it first was released.
---
D
---
great guide brother
---
Ohhh. I thought this was the qa one. Thanks dude.
---
Excellent idea
---
You can click every tick like you would with blowpipe it works just as well. Imo woox walking isn't really worth it, makes the boss way higher effort for very little reward and if it causes you to die every now and then it probably cancels out all the time you save anyway.
---
That's true
---
Magie
---
Ah nah trust me I‚Äôm Garbo too but I think with enough practice you‚Äôll be fine, but if you want to pvm then go with focus. Don‚Äôt let me make you regret your choice haha. It does look fun to be a machine gun not gonna lie.
---
Do germans really convert everything to their own language? Holy fuck even the movies have shitty voice overs, even dutch movies.

Hey bud, as a nurse I just wanted to say good job getting through this acutely difficult time and I'm proud of you for sharing your experience! Best of luck with your recovery, sending love and energy your way:)

Do you play with game sounds?  I find the runelite built in metronome is horribly quiet even with game sounds near off

Yessirrr

I graduate with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing in two weeks. Looking forward to caring for genuine people like yourself in the future. Get some rest, use that incentive spirometer, and keep on gaining that xp!
---
I have always been killing slayer monster using whatever they are weak to.
---
Served me quite well, but black demons were taking too long to kill with enchanted slay staff (I saw on wiki they're weak to magic). It took around 37 seconds per kill.
---
So I decided to go against the suggested attack style and try melee, and that was a lot quicker, with 23 seconds average killtime.
---
So I was thinking... can I safely ignore the suggested attack style with all my future tasks and just melee everywhere?
---
Doubt they fix because they obviously don‚Äôt care
---
Just pray soul split, wake up mid-anesthesia, and strangle the doctor. Flawless plan.

If the darts are picked up, do they go into your inventory or back into you ammo slot? And what if you have a few in your inventory already?

Insane luck, I'm 1k dry now

(I know, way under drop rate but still)

Adding snape grass runs with my herbs definitely sped things up for me
---
&gt;The feature i want to use in that is the ability to use one of the keys to toggle a key on or off
---
It's legal because an operating system feature (Stickeykeys) does the same thing.
---
That‚Äôs right, every time you get a 99 you have to drop the untrimmed cape first, then tele grab it after you‚Äôve got the level.
---
Dang it to heck
---
Cool! Thanks
---
Y fletch
---
Well, I mean, if he actually farmed it all himself then he's not really impacting the economy in any hurtful way by selling the gold, if anything it's good for rs economy because he's spreading the wealth among a large potential pool of players. It's like e communism where the person doling out the gp is an alien and he accepts a currency that nobody else uses. This metaphor made sense in my head.
---
F
---
Fuck yeah man. The grind continues!
---
I mean you could do literally every farm run out there and tithe farm in between or something, but you‚Äôre better off just doing your trees between other things. It‚Äôll go by so fast you wouldn‚Äôt believe it
---
Lmao, WT is a boss. Why would you go bossing without a guide?m on a HCIM? deserved death, sit kid.
---
Ammo slot iirc, even if you have some in your inventory
---
Gonna cry?
---
noticed for the highscores it doesnt show boss kc on personal highscore page. you have to manually going down the list currently.  is this in the works? and what about minigames as a future thing as well?
---
im just helping a fellow runescaper out. are you ok?
---
I mean ... you could use this as a lava lamp and vice versa they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive
---
i think "inquiries" was meant to be supplies, not uniques.
---
Thanks, I was on 1.6.1. I built the launcher from source and now I'm on 2.1.0. It looks really similar to 1.6.1 so hopefully some things have changed in the background that are imperceptible but increase my QoL in experience.

400kc no moley moley mole

How does that encourage more risk?

osrs gets pvp updates though. destiny hasnt had any real pvp content since like year 1.

I went to 70 from 58 for just a little over 2m a week or so ago with ensouled giant heads. They were on the cheap side so I decided to just go for it. I‚Äôd highly recommend heads.
---
bruh
---
If it's so low then why do you say there's so much of it?
---
Wow 12 runs a day is a lot. Congrats on the 99!
---
This. I don't get people getting mad at a rare low-worth drop. It's completely irrational. If you had gotten nothing you would've been happier. How does that make sense?
---
I think it didn‚Äôt pass the poll. It was for torture iirc
---
I don't think we're on the same page here
---
Making it yourself is easiest, 50 crafting iirc
---
otherwise magpie imps or very rare bird nest drop
---
By Guthix, you are vile!

You right, forgot that obelisk is built in the superior garden. But my point still stands, getting the tree/ring combo gives you an extra room for something else.

Imagine being offended at stuff like this
---
Damnnn i would unload my spec bar 4x in a row on this
---
...and, you know, they can‚Äôt refuse. Because of the implication.
---
I went through most of my shit to eliminate 80% of the really worthless items, but I'm not going to promise I'm some neckbeard who has a 5b bank where they're only dropping dragon claws and 3rd age armor. Still a lot of valuable stuff.
---
Yeah I banged out 86 for a master clue using Goldsmith Gauntlets at Blast Furnace. I really can‚Äôt imagine smithing the normal way anymore smh...

And tbh I always boost +5 with stews usually get it in one inventory. Not much of a hassle imo.
---
You're definitely missing something. I'm running Seers right now, and I never move my camera? Every next obstacle is easily clickable after the last. Then you just map click/teleport back to the start. No need to to use GPU mode or anything else some of the comments mentioned.

Sone guy with 42k zulrah kc on highscores got removed lmao

Hmm, reading all of the comments and I‚Äôve got to side with the majority... I am glad this happened to you.

Feel free to start on your new ‚Äúactually paying attention to updates‚Äù pure.

Everything in moderation. Or molederation if we're being topical.

Dudes an asshole, he robbed a bank and killed some noobs.
---
Definitely agree about the censorship of his name. Dick move by OP.
---
But the way you phrased that was a bit sus.
---
Did you try speaking to Oziach?
---
Wow thanks for the spoilers
---
I would actually get this tattoed
---
How do people get cyber bullied, like just hop lmao
---
Imagine imagining

There's a store that sells them alongside dragonstone crossbows and dragonbone bolts.
---
it's just a game bro calm down
---
Sure I'll come
---
Sweet gonna give this a try next time
---
All my friends used to play it in high school and I love games where your character progression actually matters. Also, I love the dragon chainbody!
---
Good stuff man! Best of luck on your recovery!
---
I'll gladly hop if someone is polite. If they're rude straight off the bat, I'll stay just to spite them.
---
Just do medium boat.
---
How much do you think each run costs? Are you 99 prayer?
---
I usually deny getting a spade as a drop, so I don't have to split it. Especially if I get one from an ironman. Those are worth BANK. 
---
Have yet to get one from a hardcore ironman. Finding a HCIM in the wilderness is like winning the lottery. I would legit masterbait for days if I ever found one.
---
You better have an actual mole party on W378 at the same time as his magic party now.
---
Void sucks more. I wouldn't suggest getting all the helms right away, especially the mage helm which is almost useless.
---
Nice...
---
He just said without wildy altar
---
Thanks man i'm already having a good time at wt. At around 30 kc I decided to get 20 con. Which would have tooken me about 5 mins on the main but took a good 2 hours on the ironman haha. Definitely take the ge for granted xD. 
---
Already cranked out 30 agility I can already tell Graceful's gonna be a must get early!
---
Looking forward to herbiboars for sure!  red chins are liberally 50xp less per catch :( really adds up
---
Rocky between 10 and 15 thieving. Right there with you in terms of no more luck for the next few years.
---
was he banned?
---
Yes but they'd be highly effective against afk HCIMs
---
Damn, we want to play a game to have fun instead of being losers, damn
---
As much as I like the idea of these non combat buffs, I feel like they could just introduce a quest that offers a different spellbook that would have spells for this stuff.
---
I don't think adding it through summoning would be likely to pass a poll. Looks like you put a lot of effort and thought into this, so kudos to you.
---
Dhideis good defense for wilderness? That‚Äôs really helpful, thank you, I‚Äôm not super sure on my equipment setup. Red chins are 50xp less unfortunately, which really will add up when I‚Äôm spending an additional several hours hunting because I couldn‚Äôt get to hunt black chins, Yanno?
---
I‚Äôm going to try the seed pod for sure, i didn‚Äôt even know that worked above level 30. I‚Äôm not even worried too much about profit as I am getting my hunter to 99 quickly. Black sallys were really a bitch for me to do; I enjoy hunting chins, and it‚Äôs significantly faster! Thank you so so much, this helped!
---
It‚Äôs almost 4am in the states on the east coast, so 10am in England, and I got pk‚Äôd 3 times on a world with very low players.. which triggered me to write this post, lol. Thank you so much for your contribution though, what should I use for magic defense? Any advice would be awesome!
---
I‚Äôd just do red chins for right now yes it‚Äôs less xp per catch but if you‚Äôre  only getting 30chins before getting pked you‚Äôre probably getting less xp/hr and gp/hr than you would  by just doing red chins and never risking anything.
---
D hide has mage defense so hopefully the pkers will splash on you and their mage attacks will not hit often. I‚Äôd bring saradomin brews with me for food!
---
Levels were reset when attack styles switched over to saving per item, and all attack styles had to be reset. Lots of pures were ruining their accounts and it was basically the exact same as this situation, except this is only one guy so he probably won‚Äôt be so lucky. There was a form to request a reset and everything.
---
It can mean either splitting everything or just the big drops, it's whatever the group decides. Usually with cox it's just the big drops but gwd it can be either
---
If you buy a bond and sell it, the bond becomes untradable. The person now owns a bond they can either use on themselves, or pay GP (equal to 10% of the ge price) to convert it into a tradable bond. People who give bonds away (streamers, clan leaders, etc) pay that 10% fee after buying it from the ge which acts as a small gold sink
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good point I suppose! If all else fails with trying to resist pk‚Äôers, I‚Äôll have to hop on over to red chins and then do herbiboars when the time comes, thank you!
---
Okay, I didn't know that since I missed the qa yesterday
---
Andddd , it‚Äôs gone
---
*make eat
---
Rs3 is taking the hit with mtx so that osrs can exist.
---
Aah okay cool! That‚Äôs great advice! I‚Äôll start working on ranged to equip better d‚Äôhide, I‚Äôm only 44 ranged.
---
Wyverns are better gp/hr even since before dragonbane weapons buff
---
Glad to see you doing well man! You‚Äôre a god amongst men man, don‚Äôt ever forget that! Hope rehab goes well brother!

It is

Not sure about germans but I'm sure that dutch people don't convert everything to dutch

No roaches

Thanks for advice. Best method for that? Just full

That‚Äôs the intent, they want you to hop.

Ok, hop then, your only wasting your own time

Only thing I got is if u have the GPU plugin enabled, try disabling it... all I got

so high reading this i was like where did you get the hy from

So you changed it to the incorrect one?

Idk whats worse, getting 77 rc or training agility in general

Uhmmmm, nazi much?

Warning everyone, this guy is a loser, don't trust anything he says.

It does, I've done it a few times. Most recently about 2 weeks ago.

Locator orb and bones. Or if it's off time you can coins and noted bones so you don't have to run back everytime. Teleport I'm not sure sorry but it should be on the map I guess.
---
No
---
Yeah but then u gotta put in effort for like 300k of feathers
---
Put offer in before u go to bed, and whallah

Because most of the items would be members items.

And what do you contribute to the sub to complain about it so much, lmao
---
Internet bullying is often fishing for any reaction and believing your actions caused theirs. It doesn't matter what they say, they could say anything, the bully thinks he's won.

The pigeon just knocks all the pieces over.

Then struts around like it won.‚Äù

Best COA is ignore and move on, even threads like this serve as a platform for the bully. Attention of any kind is a win.

What made him start doing this? Anything in particular or did he just find you and decide "fuck this guy"

Feel kinda bad for Sick Nerd. He takes it like a champ though. Lost a bunch of weight over the last year too I believe. Beast.
---
Zeah rc shortcuts
---
When people afk at NMZ are they hitting?
---
Do you even remember how annoying these were?
---
Always makes me laugh because Sick Nerd isn't even that big anymore, compared to most Americans he is a normal size who wouldn't be looked at twice for that sort of thing. When I visited America there was big people EVERYWHERE!
---
DM has been send!
---
I like how they made boss scores and instead of it being a cool look at who‚Äôs got lots of boss kills it‚Äôs basically become a witch hunt for bots and rwt.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they need banning but still jagex just highlighted their own problems to us here

Do at least 1 part of the rfd quest and you can use the bank in the basement and never see them
---
Cleaner room = better brain = better perfomance = more economic CPM = better XPph. It's not XP waste.
---
Thank your surgeon, not osrs.
---
well if they afk for to long they stop auto retaliating after 15-20mins. and it depends.
---
i used to afk mage in nmz aswell but with full mage bonus so i hit normally. i dont know if its possible to afk for a long time without healing in ny way..
---
Looks like your well on track, I wouldn't worry too much.  I did a mix of nieve and duracel and was further behind than you at this point.
---
This works for me! I connected to a US-server through the VPN and now I'm able to log in. Thanks!
---
&gt; Mommy!
---
I got my first jad kill by getting 99 ranged beforehand and just outdpsing the healers with a blowpipe. The prayer switches on their own are easy to deal with but I could never handle luring the healers at the same time.
---
Nobody killed those bosses yet.
---
Thought id accidentally clicked on r/neckbeardnests
---
Doing 2-3 F2P quests is still faster and would take less work. Your script would have to relog you in every six hours/be restarted or programmed to hop worlds at some point during the six hours to dodge the force logout.
---
How do you know hes dry though? Maybe just likes doing clues lol. 
---
Hes prob gotten some good loot in that much tho. These new hiscores are crazy lol. People Who have 121k zulrah kc...75k vorkath. Its fuckin crazy these people lmao. 
---
I was surprised my 3170 hydra kc got me top 350
---
If you‚Äôve got high enough thieving fast way for starter cash after losing it all is to just thieve ardy knights or steal from chests at the rogues castle till you can afford a cheap setup and then safespot some wildy bosses  or go to gargoyles in shit gear and just upgrade your setup after every trip until you can go fo barrows or zulrah or something
---
I‚Äôm convinced that‚Äôs his alt that he responded with to save face, and then botched the edit considering he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about lol
---
To recieve an untrimmed slayer Cape you need to reach level 99 slayer before achieving any other 99s. Hope this helps! Good luck!

I have to wait until Easter to get mine :( can you believe I‚Äôve played since osrs came out and haven‚Äôt done a single Easter event.

Neither

Does not work for me either... tried on phone and tablet and on different wifi :/
---
You mean jolyy roger tatoo?
---
This looks like a custom bot if it can survive for this long and on something as complex as bandos gwd 
---
Or manual gold farmer but a strange choice of boss to choose
---
Was hoping to see a positive update from you! Stay strong brother, here's to a healthier future!
---
Report and ignore list ez
---
You need to complete any open clues then just have boxes in the bank/invent and it'll be fine

I racked up 70 hours on RHCP, never know how but it always happens

He's streaming pet hunting and bloodhound is one of the pets he's missing

cant you boost to all of that from 84?

A bunch of stuff spawned at kourend castle too lol!

If it makes you feel better, I just killed him my first time ever two days ago. Don't lose hope!
---
Is this the new swampletics/karama UIM

sorry if you didn't make it, they're gone now

Antifire and range protect keeps them off me. I venom them with bp so they run away
---
I didn't know you could stand around for 5 mins and pay someone 10k to collect points in wt.
---
This is stressful, thanks Jagex for no reply
---
You can just put him on ignore, turn public off, or hop. Saying a slightly mean joke isnt harrassment. If he followed you around just to be a dick to you sure I get it but if this is all he said there isnt anything there.
---
Man over here crying its impossible and then u have woox doing it without brews or restores.
---
Completely agree with you.
---
You straight up can't with your account. 
---
99mage/99range pk accounts only a few levels higher than you, and you don't stand a chance against them.
---
You forgot the sarcasm tag. You should add it before to many people take you seriously.
---
Don‚Äôt worry bro it will be out winter 2017. Trust me
---
Best of luck for the future :)
---
Doesn't mean you should be a twat to him. 
---
Good on him. He put in the hours to get what he does.
---
Do you realize how much lower the player count would be though? Even at a low ballpark estimation of 20% that means 9,214 of the current 46k\~ player wouldn't exist/be affecting the game. In the long run the economy would recover and some skilling would become profitable, if it's supplies aren't dropped en masse by afkable slayer npcs, but it wouldn't look good to the chinese overlords since they want to sell jagex. Not make it look even worse than it already is.
---
Some JMods sent out an announcement to meet at wt for some ‚Äúgains‚Äù. Turned out to be a bait to make us use all our laws when they started spawning easily 1000 phats/masks. We got outplayed.
---
This thread isn‚Äôt monitored via Jagex, it‚Äôs for new players to ask for help.
---
Lol that‚Äôs quality, Christmas cheer comes at the price of all your laws
---
How do you gauge that would be about rank 27 ?? I know you said "like" but it seems specific lol
---
Before the hiscore rankings being up
---
you can afk till your absorbs run out, which if in normal mode is close to 20 minutes iirc. but this is pretty point-expensive as sitting on two hp instead of one halves the effective hp you have from them, and so on.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Rs3 died for our sins
---
Yeah, but he gets to indulge in his sociopathic tendencies in game so he can function as normal person in real life. What about that?
---
I remember how I annoyed I was that they added the dragon scimitar that I dreamt about as a reward to such an annoying quest. Back in the day it was one of the hardest and most annoying quests in Runescape. How times have changed...in not the best ways in some aspects.
---
That'll ruin it. Let the dude run a beastly f2p
---
think you get it when cancelling a GE offer
---
Tell me how a new skill is any different than the multitude of quests, minigames, bosses, items ect... hell the osrs of today looks nowhere near the same as back in 2007, yet still is just as appealing to those who played it then.
---
Guys like this, you tell them nice job using their mom's credit card. Also, tell him to meet you in 55 Wildy, you'll be there next week.
---
Its still not working...
---
Check to see if your email has been in a database leak at haveibeenpwned.com
---
Also remember now to have authenticator on your email account/your recovery email account/and your runescape account.
---
Change your passwords as well/make sure you have good recovery questions if any.

This will guarantee they can't get access to your account.

Don't want to be a dickhead, but tedious did something like this a year ago. You can download a spreadsheet and enter your stats, it will generate an artisan master which will give you a task. Completing tasks will give you points and unlocks.
---
That‚Äôs the entire point of ring bling.  It‚Äôs more of a grind to get those points and the 75 crafting.  It‚Äôs 75 slayer points because it‚Äôs easy.  Not everything has to be a perfect deal to benefit you in every way.
---
Needs to be on f2p world

Rank 82 now that it‚Äôs been updated
---
works

I‚Äôve got about 350 kills in singles and can‚Äôt say i noticed any lag that made me go ‚ÄúWTF?!‚Äù Sure I‚Äôve had a few spikes here and there but it‚Äôs been relatively fine for me.

I‚Äôm 4038 kc. At the time of the high scores being updated, I would‚Äôve been that rank. Now I‚Äôm like rank 82 lol

Well on that topic about real connections and experiences part of the reason why i mainly do what i do is simply to limit my playtime to at least half an hour whenever I do play since I have to juggle school and work. Once school ends I'll be playing normally and in members since one of my goals is to one day get a firecape.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
Gear used: whip,crystal halberd,ddef,torture,bandos,neitz,prim,bring(i),fcape,bgloves
---
Love your comment.
---
I actually like mole. It‚Äôs the only ‚Äúhunt‚Äù in the game. I even do it without fally hard because it‚Äôs more fun to me.
---
ok boomer
---
Wtf is that thing jesus
---
Ok.... I generally dont mean to be rude but there are cunts out there who live and breath pissing other plays off. Sink a sara brew kick back and relax
---
recording up to 16h of video is silly
---
Don't go in the wilderness if you can't afford to lose what you have on you?  Retarded post, like killing lava dragons is the only way to make any money without getting a gift? Lol. Nobody is autistic just for killing you haha.
---
It's more the way how,  escaped several times. But those high lvls keep switching all night just to find me in a other world to 1 hit again. I mean look for a real challenge instead of stealing a child's toy.
---
Number 1 bannedos
---
That's a very different argument now isn't it?
---
I'm not justfiying buying capes, I'd personally never do it, but your argument that not wanting to do that content means you have no reason to enjoy the game falls completely flat.
---
Half of this game is doing shit you don't want to do so you can access the content you do want to.
---
1050 but also something like 550 casting cost, sawmill is actually cheaper but long run times
---
Make a YouTube series about it, you'll be just fine until you retire with a cool 1M
---
Love when the RS3 website loads up in Portuguese
---
The sawmill operator needs to make his GP.
---
Oh true true, that's still ridiculous prices though, especially if you wanna 99. That'll cost millions
---
Mine looks super similar lol.
---
Water fall rs song is my #1
---
I used to think only stability mattered too, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true anymore. I mean, you could probably still 1 tick flick on 140 ping but my issue is the amount of effort and lack of enjoyment.
---
I used to lazy flick piety or rigour on all my slayer tasks when I lived in the states, but I never do anymore because it just doesn‚Äôt feel like a smooth gameplay experience and is way, way too much effort. I wouldn‚Äôt  want to attempt inferno a bunch of times and always have to keep repeat clicking my prayers in such an unsatisfying way 0.14 earlier than is ideal. If it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôd definitely rather just grind out maxed gear and stats and wait for the sgs specs.
---
Waiting for a reply from someone who started in 2019 without having a main supporting big time..
---
Me :)
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how people get tbows legit
---
Hi bugs lol
---
OMkk
---
I don't personally PvM for 16 hours a day.  But, it's a simple as click record-&gt;end record-&gt;delete clip. It takes less effort than you typing your reply. Its a small amount of effort compared to restarting an account.
---
Sorry but I've always thought you were meant to attack people in the wilderness.
---
When does the livestream get uploaded to youtube??
---
Lmoale ..... sorry
---
Did I say people should be a twat to him? Being a community figure is always going to get you backlash from dickheads, but let's not pretend there isnt thousands of people that love the content he produces and loves him as a community figure too.
---
Jagex have said it in a few livestream's in the past, but this was intended as a gold sink to remove raw gold from the game
---
 I'm kind of considering doing that one next. Getting some of the most hated 99's first lol
---
yeah his weight just kind of popped out of nowhere and has nothing to do with his personality or life style
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
just an unfortunate accident, something completely uncontrollable is just inflicted upon him
---
I ran around in green dhide and a random assortment of garbage gear trying to bait responses "nice credit card" "how many bonds was that" etc. 
---
It was fun. Hopefully I got a laugh out of some people.
---
Living in New England, I would definitely say that the obesity issue is in the south and not so much in the north
---
yeah his union rep is NOT going to be happy hearing this suggestion.
---
From my personal experience, they seem to be banning them. I spent 30 minutes using tele-other on them, and the ones that would get stuck I'd report, and add them to my ignore list. A week later I'd look up their account and it would be removed from the hiscores. If you see them, report them. But also tele-other them, because it's fun breaking bots.
---
Bare hand catching it could lead to a ags spec and a "sit"
---
Getting attacked in pvp zones, interesting concept.
---
I meant that germans even do voice overs on dutch movies haha
---
So you need to go through a heart surgery to reach Jagex Support
---
Godamnit it's only 8am and this is already the best thing I'm going to see today
---
Bull shit dude I was on like the past 5 hours before the dp happened
---
Not at all what I was trying to say. But thanks for the gas lighting I guess.
---
Plank making is probably one of the best ways to train magic and is now super afk after making it automatically do it.  I think max casts an hour leads to around 166k if you are perfect. It‚Äôs around 90k if you afk it.
---
so you waste gp/xp so u can out-damage some noobs doing tbow rebuilds? weird flex
---
but people don't use plank make at all though.
---
Poor lady had only 3 icing colours to work with. They look great though
---
Your fault for not doing rfd
---
Just bring a few stamina pots so you don't run out of energy. I did it with ~75 agility and didn't fall much on obstacles at all. 99 agility is absolutely not recommended (unless you're going for maxed). That's way too much time and effort.
---
Half if not more of his deaths were his own fault by reading/paying attention to the chat more than the game. But basically yeah this affects streamers more than regular players.
---
Yes yes yes
---
Indulging in sociopathy is not an effective way to prevent sociopathy.
---
Yes they do.
---
eh, the only person ive ever seen using it is me lmao. guess i havent been paying attention.
---
Construction was created as a money-sink skill, its just to ensure planks still consume gp to make, at least that's what I always assumed.
---
The only problem is if they revert you Hc status back the HC high scores still mark you off. I don‚Äôt think they will be willing to change that.
---
are you telling me this spell sends the gold by pixie to the sawmill operator?
---
Very glad to see this. If there's ever a well deserved dry streak this is it. 
---
If he had gotten the clues himself instead of begging to the world maybe... but no. Let's keep our fingers crossed he goes well over 10k dry
---
Nfs*
---
RS is still great to start. The game is awesome and the community is pretty vibrant. We have dank memes. 
---
We aren't even close to all maxed. Yeah, there are lots and you'll see them around, but there are also loads of players who are still in the early and middle portions of the game, there hasn't been much of a slow down of new players. There was a big uptick with mobile, but it's settled back down to similar levels as prior. The guys who are working maxing their alt ironmans are content creators who play the game as a job, or people who have been playing for years and years. The normal folk max eventually, but it takes years. 
---
More importantly, RS isn't a race. The game is 100% about the journey and enjoying your time on the way to your goals. Maxing takes thousands of hours, so it's about the fun that you have along the way, not the brief moment of satisfaction when you finally tick a 99 or roll a pet drop. The game is fantastic, but it does require a certain mindset and approach to the game to become a lifer. This is not a game for the impatient.
---
Why haven't you patched stalling items such as dwarvern stout keg enabling lurers to use it with a book and appear to be standing in safe but are actually in pvp so anybody who trades them slides straight into pvp
---
Xp plus not running back and forth has to cost something.
---
I started my account ~2016. Played for a few months then quit. Only now getting back. You act like lava dragons are the only MM method available. I‚Äôve been pk‚Äôd trying to kill drags in the wildy. Most of the people on this sub prolly have. It‚Äôs part of the game, get used to it. This game is a grind and it‚Äôs going to take time for you to get rich. Accept that fact now or buy some bonds and stfu.
---
Nice man, thats awesome. that would totally make me wanna keep going. If you don't mind me asking what scam was it?
---
Respect!
---
I mean, just because you haven't used it doesnt mean people dont. It's decent mage exp thats afk and meta for irons and even mains
---
Do you just bring a full inventory with 3 spices in it? I think brown spice is for smithing, but isn't it also for other skills? I believe I would need to first hot smithing as the boosted skill and then get a +5, the chances seem pretty low, but I might not fully understand stews.
---
Any way for you guys to give him life time membership? I‚Äôm sure his medical bills are through the roof
---
Seeing the edited vs unedited version, it would be really awesome to get a 'glowing effect' or something if you wear the full set of something.
---
He is 100k XP away from 99 chemistery and 2,3M XP away from I am the one who knocks 200M
---
Who‚Äôs bragging, and who was this a pain on? You?
---
Mr. Mammal‚Äôs got M O V E S
---
Tried playing dumb to this scammer after flaunting my tbow to him got baited trying to anti scam, how the scam worked is he traded me me on a high risk pvp world and if you trade back your character bugs out and walks out of the bank and you get dropped by his buddy. I thought I was in control the whole time thinking I was safe but I didn‚Äôt kno about the trade bug
---
Im saying its not even in the correct world anymore. I was just told it rotates worlds and its w492 right now, for some reason nobody plays it when its in that world
---
We don‚Äôt deserve you
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
The dancing or the animation
---
Y safe bro?
---
un telling me that less magic attack even if only slightly less good is worth like fuckin 80k in potions.
---
Ahh yah I found that one too and same story
---
Yea they should add an option so if you don't want to pvp you won't get attacked in wilderness and can just farm npcs/do clues in peace
---
congratulations. you spotted something that wasnt a problem, fixated on it arbitrarily to find a solution (which btw doesnt solve anything and adds new problems) all the while missing the point in the first place
---
I‚Äôd take either one
---
2k calories is actually a lot. That's 4 big macs. Idk anyone who can eat 4 big macs. So I dont think that's quite the issue. A lot of people are just naturally bigger. Is that good enough for you?
---
what
---
Thursdays
---
While the animation Is on point the zooming is excessive and I now feel sick.
---
I can literally hear the music while it‚Äôs on mute. Well done
---
You just know smokeys a sick dancer irl
---
Work for one hour in real life.
---
Seriously, it's worth the time you save
---
I couldn‚Äôt imagine this kind of quality existing back when I used to watch old RS machinima.
---
Walt is clearly training to harvest crystals.
---
lol
---
nothing about runescape makes sense and thats the beauty of it
---
&gt; Yeah in the long run assuming I get ranger boots
---
600 clues in, all implings no rangers goodluck.
---
My nurses are AMAZING. all nurses are. But the one thing I wanted to get across is just that. Im just an ordinary dude who thinks rationally and thinks smart. I did have a medium - high iq (nothing too crazy but like around 120), but after chemo and all these meds I'm on... I blank out in the middle of sentences, and forget things really quick. Writing and vlogging which I've been doing more masks that. But I'm nothing too special. I think the way I think has helped me stay sane all this time. Nothing innate or crazy. That's why I think anyone can do it too... because it's a replicable process; what I did to "beat cancer" (or just minimize the beating I got by it) and i used it to do stuff like get into med school, do research and build that start-up etc.
---
Well, see you all on the front page! Seriously though this is fantastic, can‚Äôt wait to see more
---
Lore is what makes the game interesting though.
---
Praise be to he.
---
id be satisfied with even a slight bit of critical thinking being applied to their arguments

Swamp man good.
---
&gt;The guys occupation doesn't justify people fucking with him about his weight and appearance
---
No but his attitude kind of does, the banter between him and his chat is like that of a regular group of friends, noone is taking offense, nothing is off-limits and everyones just having a laugh. Im confident in the idea that people feeling the need to "stand up for him" would piss him off more than the insults
---
You‚Äôre worried about 80k and you‚Äôre bursting?

---
They were not talking to you, they were talking to the bots.
---
It's extremely hard for a F2P to earn enough gp to buy a bond, so the absolute best thing you can do is make sure you've earned the stack of gp you need BEFORE the bond runs out. Your stats are still low enough that you don't really have access to any of the really good money makers, anything that anyone could recommend is gonna be a really large chunk of hours to get to 5.5-6m for a bond. 
---
Konar slayer might be a decent option, If I entered your combat stats into the calculator correctly it looks like you're 74 combat, which is only one level from being able to start using her. I think that'd also be a good route because you'd be getting your combat stats up, which will open a lot more doors for you.
---
A guy trains agil and gets no marks of grace and you think that of me? No. I am the one who bots.

No, because diets are simple math, and that‚Äôs how it is for like 96% of the population, and I‚Äôm only talking about the big ones who don‚Äôt have a condition. A Big Mac meal contains 1,100 calories (drink, fries, Mac). A breakfast of 2 eggs and toast is about 350-400 calories, then if you have a Big Mac on your lunch break, and a 600 calorie dinner, that leaves you over your daily limit. This in itself it‚Äôs really bad, but any snacks are just putting you even further over, and America has a horrible snacking problem. Stop defending people who simply don‚Äôt want to stop eating shit food, help them realize how they can stop.

It doesn't provide any ranged strength and is only +1 ranged accuracy over the blessed d'hide coif. I don't think that's worth it at all and would just use full blessed d'hide, or a slayer helm of course if you're on task

I guess, this is just so petty.

No thanks it is fine as it is.

It's frustrating and even my little shit pay to win mobile game I play gives free premium time when they have server issues. But you can't sue them over it. It's just scummy jagex doesn't give a fuck.

What qualifies as a reason "not to" do something?

That person, if we assume hes legitimate which we can question, may value the extra inventory space more since he may be the guy to just sit there and afk and only click back every now and then. If thats what he does then its likely he wont be clicking right when the brazier is in the state of being broken since this is only a temporary condition.

Theres no reason to do dragon axe special attack before every game either (theres not even a reason to use dragon axe over steel axe) but that never stopped 100s of players every game from doing that - to absolute zero benefit.

I know where youre coming from, but not really. RuneScape is a sand box game and I believe people should do what they want in the game.
---
Lemme rephrase that. Multilogging should be banning. Pures and other special PKing builds including ironmen would be acceptable. Perhaps this is why Gower left. He didn't wanna see how deteriorated his community got LOL. Also, if you wanna talk about business, allowing botting and getting their subscription money "positively affects Jagex as a business" by your logic.
---
Back to the point, whenever he caught someone multilogging, he'd ban all the accounts involved since it resembled botting too closely.

&gt; id you sell the empty jars you collected? Back when I did a whole lot of eclectic jars I never got rangers boots, but I usually made a small profit. After the first run, I thought I was down like 25% but after selling the jars I actually made a (small) profit
---
I sell everything afterwards.  1m in eclectics has netted me on average about 300-500k after selling all loot, including empty jars.
---
Yep, down for me this morning on data and wifi
---
Hope the double exp was worth it
---
600 completed and zero rangers seems like awful luck. Sorry to hear that.  Hope you are still making at least some profit.
---
Bro what. I live in upstate NY and it's disgusting, I can only imagine how bad the southern states are. Everytime I go to the grocery store or work its literally disgusting. Im a waiter at a restaurant and some people are so fucking fat they can't even fit in the booths man.

But I ain't wrong. It actually works.:https://imgur.com/a/S9Cu0eh

I'm just trying to spread the message to help people who want to login.

Worked for me! Thanks bro

How about now
---
You'd still get more dps out of trident and you profit runes at barrows anyways.
---
Dang. If they actually anounced it i missed it. That sucks.
---
If there was ever a quest that qualified as you officially "beating the game", I would imagine this plays during the credits
---
Actually not totally wrong. Not all mobile users are experiencing this.

it's annoying that this works. come on jared.

This worked perfectly! Thank you

---
I've said this before, but I'll say it again: you have no proof these are bots. They could be hand-played gold farming accounts. It looks the same to you, so the only way to differentiate is with the software Jagex uses to ban bots. And in case you weren't aware, they use that software *to ban bots*.
---
Spinning flax takes very little attention, so a single person can play tens, if not hundreds, of flax spinning accounts at once with a beefy enough computer. I'm sure it beats doing Vorkath in GP/hr if you run enough accounts.

That said, they likely RWT, for which they should be banned.

Didn't work for me, but I didn't get a chance to try out a VPN, so that might be why

I bring 9 full spices and 12 stews and a couple super restores. 
---
Make sure u watch the timer if you use Runelite. I will use the Preserve prayer if I need extra time.
---
Double poison
---
I think I was at like 2k scales per attempt maybe?
---
Ancient staff would be significantly worse: you lose 13 mage accuracy, 1 prayer, 1 inventory spot, and 15% mage damage.
---
Master wand is still a notable downgrade: -8 mage attack, -1 inv spot, -15% mage damage.
---
This is why for ironmen who haven't got a cape on their main, I would suggest grinding raids for either a kodai wand or a twisted bow (I think its around 1/450-500 to get one of the two if you solo and don't die.)
---
Its still doable without wand if you're more skilled than me: you can get back the inv spot by not using trident, and you can suck it up and burn rune darts for the whole attempt instead of bringing a dart switch to gain 1 more inv spot. I also didn't have SGS, which saves supplies. Overall though, I'd highly recommend wand or bow.

Bro did u get it

these crack me up. idk why though

Any way I can bypass this one time or? I‚Äôll change my registered email.

Yesss, this did it for me. Pixel 3, just had to close OSRS App and let it open via selecting a UK world.

Google: ‚Äúdown detector runescape‚Äù there are tons of people posting problems with servers being down. It is all of us and we are forced to do horrible things like... socialize... ugh

Graardor is immune to poison and venom.

Yeah I had about like 3 or 4 strikes before I got banned, now that account just makes a dick in chat with another one of my accounts. Not taking any more risks with edgy names
---
Nah
---
I went to oldschool.runescape.com and selected a UK world and launched the app from there and it worked for me
---
When did the standard change because its always been ibans over trident until 80 for DPS  and cost efficiency?
---
I'm not saying you're wrong just wasn't aware it changed
---
Servers are down. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre aware of it and working on it but unfortunately the osrs team doesn‚Äôt provide any sort of communication updates to their customers when this sort of thing happens
---
When is the BH world back to EU?

Unfortunately this doesnt work for me. It doesnt open the app, so I may have a disabled setting somewhere.

&gt;Is it really that hard to have a separate PC UI menu design and a mobile UI design?

Yeah, probably. Remember that this game runs on Java (and old Java at that). Only so much you can do with 20-year old tech sometimes.
---
U can bring an extra switch if u believe in ur capacities lmao
---
Everyone comes here and whines about bots ruining the game. Just wait until Jagex actually does ban them and the same people will be here whining that bow strings are 10x the price and they can't afford to level any of their buyable skills anymore.
---
Yeah but a Med is defined by being able to use at least piety/rigour while not going over 75 defence. The 75/75 is the absolute max for a med, while there are variations ofcourse.
---
A bigdick zerk is 112 combat yes, had one myself for a couple years until recently because Torags/Crystal shields became meta and they got outclassed by meds in multi. However a 99 attack med isn't a med anymore, just a non-finished main because of its attack.

ery dang god body skulld in dis dang rot her cave
---
I agree with you but it's not a popular opinion around here. GE is too convenient and taxing it could revive player to player trading for high end items. The tax would hardly be noticeable if it was 0.1% individually but it would probably sink more gp than the duel arena tax. The side note of the drop tables I 100% agree with. No items that are usually player crafted (bars, planks, herbs, potions, cooked food, runes etc) should drop from pvm. Base items from gathering skills should be dropped in extreme moderation. Such as ores, logs and raw fish. I think the economy would be improved if they did that.

Why worry about people reposting your memes? I never understood that.. Make a meme and let it be shared. who cares about who is credited?

Hardly anyone puts into action the *literal* definition of AFK.  It‚Äôs more commonly used to describe low attention and/or low APM tasks in which enable you to perform other tasks as well. Ie. ‚ÄúThis task is more afk than that task.‚Äù 
---
Barbarian fishing isn‚Äôt *literally* afk. The spots move often as well as frequently having to drop fish. Sulli WC isn‚Äôt *literally* afk, because you have to change locations when the mushroom is cut. 
---
The closest thing you can get to *literally* AFK is actions that keep your character in combat without risk of dying or cutting redwoods/or similar.
---
Rune pouch is more useful but theres an easier way to get it cause of bh so its probably better to spend your slay points on the herb puch. But if you plan on doing a bunch of slayer and getting the points anyways then rune pouch to start.

Absolutely - Busting an operation or just an individual for gold farming and selling might take time and resources but it protects the integrity of the game and that's worth it.
---
It feels like Jagex has been too lenient on gold selling / buyers, botters, etc. for far too long..  I saw five accounts in Draynor with over 20m or so theiving xp, sketchy names, and identical stats for over a week during my runs to the spirit tree.

RuneScape is time consuming and addicting. Use your newly found time to develop a skill.

Worse advice; just login a start an easy grind, the rest as you know will follow.

I would help with that too. You wouldnt want to put the burden of your ENTIRE bank on one person. So me and this fella could split it 50/50

Hes a popular f2p ironman. He wouldent take the bond. 69 defence is for the lols. Nothing in f2p hits that hard anywaus so 69 is more than enough

Hes right. And you can bring joy to two noobs in the process. Sorry for assuming youre a noob blok if you are not

Whats allowed by a clan isnt what set the standards otherwise 40def would be a pure (MM 2004, POT 2011) or that 60 def was allowed in OSRS VH which is a tank/zerk clan but not by Pre eoc vh/hf because they only saw 70 def as tanks. Any retired pure clan leader will tell you accepting higher def/pushing for higher def was purely a crutch so they could shortcut their way to beating their rivals. And the majority would tell you and would still tell you 21+ def isnt pure and most would tell you 10+ def isnt pure. 
---
Just because main clans made/use meds in 2019 to snipe pures, doesnt make high level meds not meds anymore.

i got 4 years of gold because of alien blue shutting down and i supported that app by buying the premium version for like $3, so now i have thousands of reddit points i use to gild things. often times i'll get a message back saying "you should've donated that money instead!" i would if i could, lol.

Raw practice isn't the only component to talent, some people can do/learn certain things and some can't, despite hours of practice.
---
What turns people off of the wildy is dying to other players that have practiced killing players more than the average player has practiced tanking pkers. 
---
You made a mistake and got punished for it, that's all fair game. It's a learning experience. I imagine next time you'll remind yourself to keep composed, and likely won't ever get skulltricked again by panic attacking!

Don‚Äôt try to get the passion back, it‚Äôll come back or it won‚Äôt all on its own either way a break is what you need if you‚Äôre out of motivation. You always gotta remember this game isn‚Äôt the number one thing in your life, also remember that if you stop playing today and never touch it again the time you spent isn‚Äôt wasted as long as you had fun, I see way too many people that refuse to quit just because of the time they‚Äôve sunk into the game so they don‚Äôt want it to go to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù when in reality forcing yourself to play the game when you don‚Äôt want to is the biggest waste of time I can think of.

You're not wrong.

A week or so ago there was a similar problem with desktop version. Flushing DNS on Windows helped (but I doubt its possible on mobile), also helped VPN. For me Asian VPN addresses were ok, also some Asian servers (not sure of the term) which emulated an IP from UK. Maybe some combo including VPN would work for you too. Good luck!

&gt;[06/12] OSRS Mobile Connection Issues
---
We're aware of the issues affecting some Old School RuneScape players when attempting to connect to the mobile app. These players are being met with the error message "Failed to contact server. Please check your Internet connection".
---
Our SysAdmin and our Game Engine teams are investigating and working on resolving the issues as a matter of priority.
---
We'd like to thank you for your patience, we're working to resolve the issues as soon as possible, and we'll look to confirm once normal service is resumed.
---
Some players have reported successfully playing on mobile by following these steps:
---
Navigate to the oldschool.runescape.com website.
---
Open the World Select page, in the Game menu.
---
Choose a game world to launch the app. Note that if you're still met by the error message above, then try opting for another game world.
---
We appreciate that having to resort to such a workaround isn't ideal, and again we'd like to thank you for your patience.
---
So because a small community of mostly try hards doesnt agree i shouls feel like im wrong. So king jong un is an amazing person because a small community of people love him? Hitler was amazing because a group of people agreed with him? Not how the world works nice try though
---
&gt;  iPad
---
Found your problem.
---
Not like a monetary refund, just like adding a day onto your membership ya know. Personally I don‚Äôt care too much, I‚Äôve just seen Xbox Live and other membership services do things like gives 3 extra days of membership etc.
---
What about worlds getting hit offline because a specific streamer is being targeted by DDOSers?
---
Day 4592: coffin nails
---
Pretty much any tablet can play OSRS when the servers are up. So it comes down to personal preference.
---
Attaboy! :D gl on the grind
---
Yeah where would someone find more of this?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Was working for me until about an hour ago
---
imagine not citing your sources for the fix : )
---
Or the zammy one with a trimmed slayer cape !
---
Using a VPN thats connecting you through a different country helped me get it working again.
---
Then the scenario never would‚Äôve happened. They either would‚Äôve dropped him quickly or never would‚Äôve been there in the first place since you couldn‚Äôt skull trick
---
Kind of confused, what makes the original better?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e745yn/0612_osrs_mobile_connection_issues/
---
Apparently it‚Äôs pretty common, at least it was at the time. That incident led to to start looking at the FM high scores and at the time there were loads of accounts with 100M FM exp and hardly any other skills. I find it hard to believe that so many people play OSRS purely to play Wintertodt 24/7 legitimately lol
---
There's this neat feature called running south diagonally to a single combat area, it's great for surviving!
---
Still down.
---
To clarify, he recovered and secured his account after it was hacked, a few hours later after restocking him with supplies, he was permanent banned for macroing major.
---
Holy crap!!!!! That's hilarious!!!!!
---
can you provide a little clarity around the cause of these issues? is this a biproduct of changes made to protect against server crash/dupe attempts, or unrelated?
---
playing the game
---
As far as I know they don't. I've seen people ask for a few days back when they get incorrectly banned and the appeal goes through and Jagex said no.
---
It's entirely possible that the two are linked, I can't confirm that, but if so I'll ask for the PSA to be updated. Apologies.
---

Annnd my money making method is ruined now. Thx yagex

And you wonder why ironmen as sick of your shit

Exactly, 100% not worth it.

At the moment I'm not able to, but once we're confident it's resolved we'll be better placed to talk specifics.

I mean if they could, they would have in the update.
---
You may have seen many of the OSRS t-shirts on the subreddit before or this 99 beer patch before. If someone has the know how of how to put this design on a t-shirt or recommendations on websites that would be helpful for making my dream a reality I would love you forever.
---
Are you going to the right king?

Thank you and what‚Äôs up hahaha

Haha yikes dude
---
He admitted to losing composure and panic-attacking. That's exactly why skulltricks work in the first place, and is a mistake by the player. All you need to do is click feet with auto on and run if they delay, anticipating auto retaliate. The wilderness is an area full of outsmarting players, people have worked on methods for over a decade. Of course players who haven't will lose, they're not as experienced. It should be that way.
---
How about diagonally?
---
3AddictedBrothers RSMV 2019?
---
Who cares if they "cite" their sources?  They already said some users pointed out that this fix worked for them.
---
no, no bgs.
---
make sure you have full void (not bgloves....), and salve ei, and are swapping to diamonds at the right %, and are using dragon base bolts, and are dpsing constantly... consider upgrading to elite void/consider using superior range pots, make sure you are praying range with an antifire shield (or ward)
---
That seems like poor customer service practice, especially in regards to an incorrect ban. I guess Jagex has enough stable members to get away with not remedying their mistakes.
---
His bank is 50m guys, listen to him.
---
Well the devil isn‚Äôt real so what‚Äôs your point Opie?

a relatively simple query wouldnt have found these until very recently.

---
So I just got back into Runescape after years of being away (when i stopped playing when Runescape got a facelift, and since the app came out, played it for like 2 days), then I‚Äôm back now more seriously. 
---
Why would you not want to increase your defense?
---
ah, okay thanks
---
You sir are the MVP
---
I tried posting this twice as a text post and both times it was instantly removed by a moderator bot. I'm not asking to appeal a macroing ban, I'm asking to have a hacked account returned to a brand new player to the game.
---
lol why are we sharing an article from JUNE?

---
Heck yea man!
---
How about my money?
---
Apparently, their anti-botting bot is pretty effective
---
Lol you done that quest 500 times?
---
They are using the meth pot, raises defense, hp, attack, strength, and cooking by 30%.  Super op but they loose the ability to make GP out side of PKing and Staking for a week after using it.
---
Yea well, the only advice i can give you is to have a secure account. 
---
Not sure if jagex will help you, but tell your friend to have better account security. Try and ask mods on twitter for help since that is one of the ways to directly contact mods instead of shitty customer support.
---
I think people are getting tired of seeing these wrongly banned posts because there are so manyof thede posts since people use reddit to get help instead of customer support.
---
We as outsiders also don't know if it is true or not, we can only have faith in the words of OP.
---
This is, in itself, but it exists.
---
Yeah
---
$11 btw
---
Venezualan's are people too!
---
some probably even enjoy playing rs
---
I know that they help people, I'm just hoping someone who can do something will see this post.
---
Not a fan.
---
Gives me an RSPS feeling.
---
I don't skulltrick, haven't done that since 2011
---
I feel like this def not true
---
That mash up is fire.
---
Quickly? Buddy it‚Äôs been like this for a couple days now. This is unacceptable.
---
Yeah sure no problem let me just me just train an alternate account for the next time it happens might as well just quit my job too that way I'll have more time to level up.
---
Then that's good for.you but you still called it a skill earlier
---
My account is much safer! I mentioned on a different account, but I changed the passwords for my account and email account, and got an authenticator AND a bank PIN. So hopefully, they'll see that I was trying to do better. I'm just a little lacking in OSRS knowledge.
---
Vanilla client on my laptop isnt loading. Friend's isn't either
---
I mean that‚Äôs exactly what he did though
---
I had him set his own authenticator, bank pin, better password, changed his e-mail password, etc. as soon as we recovered it, and hours later he was banned anyway. Jagex will be able to see the through via IP logs and what not. I just feel really bad for him. (&amp; the 5m I've given to him, a bit, lol)
---
Are we going to get hours added to our  bond timers or 'lmao, nahhh?'

But you wouldn't be able to get avas to equip the steel med in f2p

---

---
If I could find some groups maybe! I used to really like soloing kree when I was still playing and that was good money. Is it still good money?
---
Worked for me!
---
And still one of my favorite boss fights
---
When they raise prices and the product doesnt really improve, and is even unplayable it is kind of laughable. I dont really play mobile and i dont really care that its down but he has a right to be pissed.
---
The dude's got some megalomania going on. His apology seems more to ensure his channels survival and minimise reputation damage, rather than to make amends and constructively work on his faults.
---
His apology was 100% warranted, but I can guarantee it wasn't from his heart.
---
I posted #1 yesterday and he was banned. I like to think I made a difference
---
Yeah that seems to be what general customer service practices are; especially when it‚Äôs not a big hassle to make the customer happy.
---
bearhead is a members item, unfortunately.
---
Does it really!?

Pretty good trade off. Killing a worthless guy that has no business in the wild for fun, going to the sand casino and making bank off the spoils.

We'll keep y'all posted. I appreciate the support, too.
---
Interesting. Subbed man. Good luck on your journey.
---
What happened
---
Yes definitely helps. Ty. I just recently got Reddit also so if this post was redundant I‚Äôm not very affluent on here to be finding already posted discussions. Everywhere else I‚Äôve looked all the info was older than 10h
---
Judging by the mod‚Äôs response, it‚Äôs almost certainly due to fixing the dupe glitch but they aren‚Äôt allowed to say so
---
which streamer is that?
---
Yes exactly, and in this case it‚Äôs not about the monetary value. Of course $1 or $2 is nothing but it‚Äôs about the general principle.
---

I'll take some Runescape cash. Give me 10 minutes!
---
Full rune takes 16 rune bars vs 3 for 2h, why would 2h be so ridiculously more expensive per bar?
---
Paying under 50m for it is a steal, you'll want to PvM even more once you have it too, it makes any boss where you're using ranged sooo much faster and more enjoyable. It'll be made back in a heartbeat
---
Pures were discovered pretty early on in RS classic - in the early 2000s. Back then, the classic build was called a "Prayer Beast" or PB. 40 att, 1 def, 99 str, 31 prayer and 1 mage. Range could be included as well.
---
They'd wear monk robes, r2h, and a strength ammy. They could absolutely wreck any normal character and since they protected their r2h they barely lost anything when they died.
---
Mage levels affected combat differently, so mage was a big no-no (unless you went ONLY mage and no other stats). As far as I've always understood, the word "pure" originally meant no mage. If your account had mage it was not a pure. That's why builds like "rune pure" existed - they had 40 def but no mage, meaning they were still a pure. In rs2, "pure" changed to be associated with 1 def as mage levels didn't affect your combat.
---
That was a fun time.
---
Is anything going to be done for our memberships? I've lost atleast a day of playtime to this glitch. I understand shit happens but we shouldn't be on the line for it.

---
I actually like the idea of a fee to get your account back and be on a watch list of sorts, plus more money for them so win win.
---
I killed somebody running under the chaos altar and they had like 11k rune bolts on them. This was before it was used as a viable way to train prayer.
---
It's really surprising how many people carry stacks of stuff on them in the wildy lol
---
Chief, I am immensely proud of your dedication and hard work, and equally excited to hear of the bit of luck with with which your efforts were rewarded. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors in the world of Gielinor, and in the real world as well.
---
I got into the game. Just manually select a server and pick one thats usually less populated it should work
---
What is wrong with the servers at the moment? 
---
Mobile may be the most badly affected, but even on desktop it‚Äôs taking around 10 minutes to load. 
---
Definitely something being covered up here.
---
Is that I'm bringing sexy back set to the music of the less I know the better?
---
Just delete the game and reinstall it
---
Yeah through PayPal
---
Oh you deleted your running balance this time. Nice
---
Don‚Äôt leak my dick pics
---
I know right. I feel the same about that Oda rwt.
---
Thanks!
---
Best runescape content ever witnessed
---
Yeah that definitely doesn't help, but gold has also inflated quite a lot thanks to the karamja shop that was a problem up until like 2 or 3 years ago, it basically allowed you to sell items for *high alch value*. That and all the slayer monsters dropping tonnes of alchables
---
Each stew (Orange, Yellow, Red &amp; Brown) boost different stats, so for smithing you‚Äôll want to use Orange. Instead of killing the Hell Rats kill the Hell Rat Behemoth. They drop a full spice (4). There are 4 Hell Rat Behemoths in each corner so make sure you kill the one with the Orange spice in it. Also bring fish to use on your cat while he is fighting to make sure he doesn‚Äôt die.
---
The regular Hell Rats drop random spices and random doses so it can take a while that way.
---
They never really do anything for downtime
---
Weve had days of down time b4 abd gotten no compensation.
---
Technically its in their terms of use or whatever that the game isn't going to be up 24/7. So they *technically* don't have any obligation to do anything, buy happy customers is always a good thing.
---
Will there be a pro-rata refund of membership subscriptions?
---
They release a new track most years so you need to complete the most recent of each holiday.
---
Comparing OSRS to United States politics. LMFAO
---
Thank you so much for the advice, I will try my best to couple a distraction with the pain. A year of doctors not knowing what to do has been stressful and confusing. It started with Vertigo and vestibular damage to my left ear, then neurological damage in the right side of my body, then gastro intestinal issues. Training my neuroplasticity to accommodate for my loss of balance has been my hope. You definitely have given me more hope than I had before.
---
Thanks for reaching out your hand to all of us here, I know we aren‚Äôt all experiencing the same difficulties in life, but knowing we aren‚Äôt alone in this battle is comforting. 
---
I‚Äôm glad you have found solace in online gaming, I love the community gamers have created.

Sending my energies to you for a speedy recovery my friend. You have a good heart. Have an amazing day.

Trolling can be fun. I've straight up griefed games like minecraft and custom games in halo solely because I found frustrating and inconveniencing strangers hysterical.
---
Jk it wasn't fun that was just my way of coping with my serious mental issues and ptsd from my parents locking me in a cage for a week. Trolling in video games is the only way I can forget about how sad I really am on the inside.
---
Perfect! Thanks Mc!
---
The work around doesn't work when the game won't even load period.
---
It hits me with the "failed to contact servers. Automatically retrying in 5...4...3...2...1"  switching servers doesn't help this issue at all.

Wow wtf HARD NTA. You said it yourself, its a sale! They're obligated to buy your shit when you trade. Only other reason they'd trade is to scam, which is illegal. You should have reported them to the police. Sorry you had to go through that :(

Normal. I'm not selling cause ironman btw
---
I voted no to it (Inquisitor) on all accounts, just for the simple fact they kept it at 30def req. Loved it otherwise. 
---
(Voted no on the tome as well, with yes to everything else remaining).
---
I cant tell if you're trolling or not...
---
is he one of the mahjaraht?
---
I haven't done the math, but here's some numbers. 50-99 wintertodt would get you about 40 construction, more if you're playing solo.40 con is under 40k xp. On those numbers, 200m fm would get you about 600k xp, good for level 67ish.

Feel like I'm reading comments by Serene
---
You are a true hero
---
75 range, 70def and it'll be super easy.
---
Hyahyahyahya hahawow!
---
This is everything I didn't know that I needed.
---
You can probably load mobile from the website
---
Attempting to fight pkers in the wildy is a fool's errand. 
---
Fight back where you can win - vote **no** on PVP content.
---
I mean, I got about 4 and half years of reddit gold for free. Literally from reddit, and promotions they held when rolling out their mobile app.
---
I made a post about it on /r/PointlessStories 3 years ago. 
---
Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/4egltr/i_just_got_4_years_2_months_and_23_days_of_reddit/) if ya care, but yeah. Reddit just gave me it. I understand that isn't the case for everyone, but I have these "points" I can spend literally just on guiding posts and that's it, so why not. And it came out of reddit's pocket so yeah.

Trying to start Lost Tribe quest... Sigmund is nowhere to be found in Lumbridge Castle, yet I have all the reqs for it. Screen cap on two dif accounts showing him in on one screen but not the other. Odd...
---
I dont think its elitist to think that spending all of your time trying to earn enough gp for a bond just so you can do it all again is a waste. Especially when in a month or two of playing (without stressing about bonds) you can be in a place to reliably warn 1-3m/hr and therefor be able to play a lot less to earn a bond...
---
Mobile cane out in fall out 2018‚Äîthey were a year behind. So anytime they set a deadline, people meme about how bad they are at sticking to dates (and customer service, $11 btw)
---
What if you only have a mobile device?
---
Ill use your example in my example. In this game the drop rate is 1/100 which means in every kill you get you have 1/100 chance obtaining it. There are no other factors. Hope this explains it any better.
---
You were meant to say Diagon Alley.
---
no. 
---
every drop has a 1 in 100 chance to drop unsired. it is not cumulative, it is not effected by hopping, it is global, there are no tricks. kill more sire.
---
Justin Timberlake mashed up with Tame Impala. I love it so much.
---
No, it works like farming, it uses real time not logged in time.
---
Like god d hide boots?
---
Any chance for minor compensation, like a free day or week of membership?
---
Assuming of course that whatever is happening isn't something that any individual can casually cause on a whim...
---
Alch it then duh
---
Lol imagine calling a 117 combat level account "med"
---
Is it any different than raids 1&amp;2, wintertodt, pest control, etc? Its a group activity and its not like we're retroactively giving ironmen access to group bossing at like gwd or corp.
---
Not sure if this is what was going on but it was found that you can hop worlds into a running castle wars game if you are in a running castle wars game on another world. When Jagex Ash was asked about it on twitter he confirmed it was not a bug and while not in the spirit of the game it did not break any rules. However I can no longer find the video where this was shown or the tweets to Ash.
---
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
---
I am gonna laugh if the poll question fails now
---
Do you live in the US? If so, igd be best to just connect your RS account to amazing and buy membership through them
---
Omfg I love this
---
Raids in a nutshell. I got a twisted bow from doing tob only to use it in tob for almost no benefit.
---
Mbad, I went in too confident lol you all are right
---
Does it decline in person?
---
Sounds like you need a new bank it your calls go overseas
---
Must just be because I'm a 1 def meme but those scions fuck me up lol.
---
Pretty sure it has to with rs not runelite. Check your settings in game. Pretty sure theres something there that is causing it. Cant recall exactly what though. Its been awhile
---
Holy. Crap. Epic dude.
---
I often see you in this sub, and every time I see your name I say the French expression 'Sacr√© bleu' to myself. Just thought I'd share.
---
90 prayer on f2p is insane, judging by his obor and Bryophyta KC he must have killed some 3-400k giants for it
---
Thanks for the advice. Are rannars the best seeds to do?
---
Hard agree.
---
Just chiming in to say that the workaround that was mentioned for mobile also worked for me in getting the desktop client to load, if that helps any.
---
Would the team be open to any sort of compensation for the playerbase? This has been a fairly persistent issue, and the blog post doesn't seem to have any end in sight. Perhaps 3 days membership applied to all currently subscribed accounts?
---
Gay Cyclops gave me real techno Viking vibes
---
Complementary upvote so Customer Service might notice
---
Thank you appreciate it. On the OSRS wiki it mentions to kill them in Kourend which can be difficult to get to. Is the Varrock dungeon fine?
---
Well done Chode!
---
Will do!
---
lemme psspspspspspspspsps ur cat
---
How foreign was this lady exactly I think this might be the root of the reason of your card declining
---
At least you‚Äôll always remember a micro formula
---
Ngl, that‚Äôs scary af
---
I don't know if RL respects or overrides the OS scaling level.
---
OSRS as-is (on the vanilla client) scales with the OS scaling level. At 100%, everything will be crisp, but this ranges from uncomfortably tiny to virtually unplayable due to being too tiny depending on your screen size and resolutions past 1440p, and even 1080p.
---
If the OS scaling level is beyond 100%, OSRS scales the UI with it, but also loses texture quality while doing so. Anyone playing on mobile should notice this (especially on tablets) since the same thing happens there; edges on characters, NPCs, and buildings are visibly jagged. It gets worse the higher the scaling level.
---
I'm unsure how UI scaling through RL works with this, but I believe you can play around with the stretched mode settings and GPU plugin settings to get it crisp and scaled.
---
While not direct law, it is admissable in court. Its the same reason while they're able to ban you, even if your account has a year of membership on it. In this case, Jagex seems to be making a good faith attempt to restore connection as quickly as they can, but it seems like a complicated issue given it isn't fixed yet. So legal action would ultimate be moot, and just cause friction between the playerbase and Jagex
---
I don‚Äôt condone RWT, also not familiar with the market of burnt food. But I believe that‚Äôs a steal of a deal lmao
---
GZ!
---
Make sure to get that $40 off!
---
Why jump to a cover-up?
---
Yeah 1 Def is undoable
---
You have to go to the mobile website, it will launch the app differently and should work then
---
*spits*
---
From what i'm seeing it, it seems like it's related to which server you connect to and what country you are in probably
---
From my experience, it wont work on mobile data, but it will work from wifi. Samsung s7 btw
