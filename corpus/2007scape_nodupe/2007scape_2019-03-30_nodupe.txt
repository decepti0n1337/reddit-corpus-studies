She doesn't assign boss tasks unless you unlock bosses, so most tasks are really easy even for low levels if you don't have them unlocked.
---
I say keep it. It‚Äôs things like that for which people attack any and everyone in the wilderness, because sometimes people accidentally (or lazily) bring big loot into the wilderness. As one of the people who has to detour through Lumby because someone kills me while 3 item clue scroll hunting, I think this guy deserves nothing back for being an attributor to that.

The problem with this game is that you can just do tick-perfect agility runs and then there's nowhere to improve from there.

Right I thought you did some mouse moving with ahk. Wonder how jagex would react if you were to add multiple functions to the same button but only do them one by one if you press it (press z 9 times for a 5 way switch). It's still 1:1, just not the same 1 each time.

Personally just a ton of quests, aim for competing ones like Monkey Madness, RFD, Desert Treasure, Lunar Diplomacy. By aiming to get these quests done you‚Äôll end up having to level up your stats AND you‚Äôll get some good quests done.

In that case, there isn't much to work with since OSRS is much newer and the developers are a lot more conscious about game integrity.

How many chairs have you gone thru in the duration of your account?

Not sure how much I agree with that; though my sanity is debatable so it might check out. It really depends on how you define easier. We certainly have seen a lot of powercreep in certain areas, but Summoning was a very different type of powercreep than what we have. The sustainability added by healing and BoB familiar is not to be understated; whether it would impact some boss trips as much as a T Bow will likely depend on the boss so hard to say which is stronger overall. Either way, I wouldn't say either of those kinds of major changes are "fine"; at least for OSRS since it is supposed to be more akin to early RS2 and major changes kinda go against that.
---
Also, while it was a money sink that worked, it isn't what I'd consider a good money sink. The whole design of pouches was pretty bad. It was neat to see some underused items gain relevance, but requiring obscure items plus an arbitrary item you buy for a fixed amount of coins plus untradeable charms from monster drops was a bit much... I'd say Construction does a coin sink better since the coins are the primary resource to make the planks and the logs are closer to a secondary cost.

If I have 85 Ranged and no DHCB, is it better to use Slayer Helm w/ Karils or Elite Void w/ Salve ei at Vorkath?

I thought Void was great but I've heard accuracy from ranged armor is more important at bosses.
---
What‚Äôs actually wrong with he n word? There are plenty of offensive words but the N-word seems to trump them all. I personally do not care if people use it and use it myself if it will add to a comment for comedic affect.

I think that‚Äôs her title though (or was, dunno if she still works at Jagex)

Wrong thread bro.
---
That refers to what she did after leaving the OSRS team, she left Jagex shortly after.
---
Ez account. gf
---
Someone else posted a day or two ago about their name "Cigar" being hacked/stolen from then and Jagex said the same thing that they were aware of what happened and weren't going to return it.
---
So it seems case has been solved to be honest. Sucks for you bro but I don't think they care judging from what happened to you and the other guy a few days ago.
---
If you die to someone in a pvp world, for example, you will lose your ags with ornament kit and the guy who killed you will get both the ags and the ornament kit. However, some items that have a cosmetic change but not an ornament kit (like volcanic whip) I think you will auto protect if you die under 20 or 30 wild.
---
&gt;unsubstantiated assumptions

This is tantamount to "ATM machine."

Sorry for wall of text :)

I would love for the OSHD graphics to be released, as long as it doesn't affect the currently standard detail mode!

Decent gp depending on the rooftop
---
I do not see an issue with it being used in a comedic way. There is an issue if it is used to put someone down. The reason it is funny is because of the shock factor that comes with it because people like you hold it up on a pedestal.

Who hurt you?

Yes that‚Äôs what solved it for me thank you!

didn‚Äôt ask, just kinda happened over time, along with my cookout invites, plus im brown so i don‚Äôt really have a horse in the race

I would just train melee on hill giants until I got a key drop and then kill him, bank and then repeat and I think I was around your levels
---
Avg game on a veteran boat is abt 2 minutes, so at best you'll get 150 points an hour. 3 helmets = 600 pc points, + 150 for gloves. So you need 750 more points total. Sounds like you have at least 5 more hours (probably more).

This man straight up predicted Bob the cats death, 300 IQ meme.
---
Socialism is fascistic in nature. But maybe I'm just seeing things. Surely a dictatorial leadership that eliminates and silences political opponents through secret police or forced labor camps isn't fascist in any way.
---
Democratic socialism is a retarded meme that doesn't exist. Socialist and communist states are both guided by parties with marxist-leninist philosophies, why bother treating them differently? Because of the relatively few differences that make them OC donut steel-tier unique?
---
No, socialism/communism good. That's why people are dying to escape capitalist countries to run to socialist or communist ones while denouncing the country they ran away from.
---
So you're saying that 0 people have been caught using that?
---
like 8-10 hours for a set, another 2 ish hours for each additional helmet
---
Yeah if pkd the player drops a bank key which contains the top 10 valued items from that players bank.
---
This is pretty much what I‚Äôm saying, along with a whole slew of other offensive terms used on other races like chink, zipperhead, wetback, etc. all of them are unacceptable to be used in a derogatory way. However none of these words even come close to the mythical n-word.
---
Wait, there's a basement? 
---
Add eachother
---
he has literlaly never played before, it's honestly just absurd to suggest that this is how long it should take him lol
---
If this happens i quit l0l. The end game of runescape is PvP. 
---
assumptions are always unsubstantiated, that's why they're called assumptions. Also, stereotypes are always general, that's what makes them stereotypes.
---
Yeah, I don't know how many bone bolts I used. Ammonite crabs have low defence, so I had the same dps a rcb and broad bolts, which saved me tons of money.
---
The challenge
---
i cannot enchant my ruby necklace even tho i already found the necklace in varrock museum how can that be?
---
Absolutely. Only exception are streamers that didn‚Äôt have their hands anywhere near their PC as their character continued to click.
---
Sure but it sounds awkward.
---
Assumptions dont need to be stated as unsubstantiated, because it is known they are baseless. 
---
General stereotypical behavior would also sound smoother if you just said perceived stereotypes, because it also implies that the observing subject is the one alone who is typing. Instead you could be taken as implying that many people fit the mold of a negative, unsubstantiated stereotype.
---
Awesome, thank you. Haven‚Äôt been to hill giants in so long, so I can‚Äôt wait to steal some kills lol. 
---
summoning even getting polled = instant quit from me
---
Awesome meme lol
---
but that's still pretty damn amazing dude, 2 dwhs in under 1k kc?? hell yeah
---
Wait, there was no bank in Lumbridge? What about the none?
---
Yup haha
---
They had to walk to Varrock or Draynor or figure out how to pay the guards and make it into Al Kharid.
---
Got mine on 769, youll get them lol
---
I thought the same thing, but apparently it was only 6 months.
---
It do be like that
---
I think because the kitchen is on that side and a lower floor, i always go that way because of past quests.
---
What's on earth is this. 
---
How to potato camera
---
It's really not different. Like i said, nothing original here.
---
I was rank 1 till 150m so. I'm fine with being passed though. This is a competition and I'm happy to still have rank 2.
---
After getting the pet you get a separate gamble to roll for each of the monsters, each of them as rare as the original pet. So we can continue that gamble grind 
---
Lmao youre training range? Logging in now. 
---
Yea ovbs everything is anecdotal but I've never been banned using a random interval autoclicker on my main. I got banned on this main for 2 weeks when it was around 800-900 total, trained it legit afterwards everything besides NMZ, alching, and occasionally ardy knights using random interval autoclickers, never been banned again. I figure they'd keep extra watch on my account since it's been flagged for botting in the past but still nothing.
---
I can't speak for 24/7 autoclicking though. I did it to where the intervals would look like a regular person playing.
---
This meme will never get old

matk would approve this he seems like the kind of guy to visit trebuchet museums

Thanks man, looks like I will be here for awhile.
---
I'm fucking dead. This sub is amazing. I wish I would explain to people the quality of these memes. 
---
Youre right youre dead 100% as a solo player. As a solo player you have to be ready for this and plan ahead and rush these quests ASAP. If youre faster than the clan then you should be ok. Once you're too slow you basically ruined your chances of winning the tournament.   
---
All is fair when first price is however much money jagex put on the line this time 
---
Streamernerdz r lame, so are people who watch their garbage 
---
because everyone thinks they're the smartest mother fucker on the planet and it's all anonymous so there's no real consequences for their actions.
---
A lot of my guide is tongue-in-cheek but truth be told if you are focused on being as efficient as possible with this, it's pretty insane money, and decent XP. After making the guide I did it for many hours, racking in \~1M+ without even having elite wildy diary.
---
Bro, all those black people you're defending are totally gonna give you a sash and tiara at their next cookout. Great job! I'm sure they're so glad they could finally be defended from the white man by another white man.

Why is the one with the combat bracelet banking downstairs, the joke being that he has combat bracelet so no rfd so he has to bank upstairs. 
---
Beautiful.
---
His tummy is smaller than I remmebered tho.

M8, it could be something you could open at any bank, it would take 0 extra work.

Idk where you live, but I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôd be paying taxes on the gift card.

Noticed this on my farm runs. Checking xp stopped the harvest. I remember thinking it was odd

How do we find it and what‚Äôs it called tho?

You know, I‚Äôm like 112 combat and nearly 1700 total. Elite void, barrows gloves, fighter torso, fire cape, all that Jazz. And, to be 100% honest, I kinda forget that there is a chest below the castle yet I still go that way. Every time. Legitimately, did not even know there was another stair case. 
---
Yikes.
---
And why would seed exclusive storage be accessible at any bank? It was polled and balanced with requiring access to the farming guild in mind. It was never meant to be a bank extension, it's additional storage space with a tradeoff.

WTF are security features meant to do when you give a hacker ALL of your key details lol.

RIP your account. Chances are mods aren't going to be able to help you that much if at all. 
---
Good luck though.

Where can I find a log like this in game?

Are you related to mister Knut Kentson?

This is a sign telling you to go train Runecrafting.

Wait the gloves don‚Äôt drop from barrows chest?
---
Gee IDK maybe if a random Ip address logs into an account from another country, not let them?
---
Soap should have been tracy and front guy #account 0075111 or whatever
---
Nope, they cost 130k from Culimancer's Chest after RFD.

Maybe I will, maybe I will

Maybe he has no fingers

What metal is barrows armor made of?

WE PAY WE GAY

Lads,

I'm currently working on a garg alt and just hit 70/70/70. I'm currently working on a dragon defender. 
---
Since I can't be fucked to quest / minigame on an alt and don't have the cash for a second bandos set, whats the best ghetto gear I can wear for Slayer?
---
Like in Chest / Legs / Helmet slot?
---
low iq
---
Why do much pest control...
---
They actually do have security features like that, but they can't do it solely off that because of people actually travelling, using VPNs, or RDP so they monitor activity too. Also, if you get hacked in the way you did, the hackers have your IP so it's possible for them to spoof their location to yours if they wanted to.
---
He meant barrows melee bodies
---
Dont have much of an opinion on the camping of shilo village since I dont DMM but this was pretty funny. 
---
They wouldn't have been able to log on if you hadn't given them ALL of your details mate. Stop blaming Jagex's security for this. They have always said that it is the social / human element that is the weakest link, and you just confirmed it even more. 
---
Sorry for what you're going through, it cannot be easy. Sending you my love and good wishes. Stay strong

What type of psychopath calls it right side. Its north or south  gang

Are we just going to ignore that op is super dyslexic and wrote "Jmod Wealth"?
---
I always see people talking about nats as a viable method from 44-77 rc to make decent profit while doing it. My question is why do most guides not have you switch to deaths at 65? Is there some abyss mechanic foe the death altar that makes them more tedious or just the MEP2 requirement that holds people back? I'm doing natures RN but at 65 am thinking to switch to deaths because they're worth slightly more but more importantly are significantly more xp. Am I missing anything here?
---
Not sure why no one ever recommends redwood shields, they're always profitable to alch and no one seems to know about them

Sometimes I like to do 1h of full efficiency, no breaks, just to see what I can get to.
---
How else are you supposed to stop at the kitchen to cook your fish/steaks?
---
Some phising sites only ask for your user/pw whereas some go for your bank pin and everything else but they look so obvious and trashy how can you possibly fall for that? Mustve been 2tick skilling the day before or something which uninstalled your brain, nothing nobody can do not security features fault if you go ahead and spoonfed your information away.
---
Pretty much every ranarr gets made into a ppot by someone, idk what you think happens to them.
---
They are some of the cheapest herb xp if you buy on a decent margin and use amulets of chemistry.  Not everyone has cash to make sara brews.

No problem

Really dumb tbh. You wont know the account , can be hacked back and you haven't had any completion. Plus 200 dollar gone

Wow, when did that change?
---
How much does 99 con cost compared to a duel ring?
---
Because taking your runes out and putting them back in is such a hard thing to do.
---
A one time cost doesn't make an item less op

i love the mole so much lol

Happens in castle wars bank when cutting gems also

Yes easily.

Didn‚Äôt even know they had a ladder on the right

love it

Just the other day I did this with my cash stack but I didn't get killed. I almost had a heart attack though

Tbh I use the North route 100% of the time and I‚Äôm feeling a little left out.-

Even when they don't ask about it tbh... 
---
Zulrah's a girl, and I hate you.
---
Stay strong, friend! 
---
Whoa buddy this isn't that kind of game. At all. 
---
quests are to much for some people
---
Every tiiiime?
---
Yea I'd love stackable caskets
---
Honestly didn't realize I could skip it! Pretty new to the game. Guess I should research better. Thanks for the advice.

Revs are the perfect example of balance pvp/pvm food chain. Because its profitable. 
---
Right now, you got pvmers killing revs for good profit. Which attracts pkers and small groups to kill them. Uusally not highly skilled because its pretty easy to pile someone and kill them. Pkers get good loot from the rev drops acquired by the pvmer and may get ether from rev weps.
---
This attracts bigger groups and better pkers to kill these pkers killing pvmers. And so on. 
---
So one of your main points is that, the incentives that are put in the wilderness in the way of profits are bad for the game. I disagree, especially pointing at rev caves.
---
Sure, pkers might get spite voted bec of salt or for selfish reasons. But if you think about it, pretty much all the wildly content has passed. Most things that do not pass are things that make killing easier. Things like, f2p tb, the wildly keys, things like the blessed d hide chaps , stronger entangle etc etc. Which at the same time, as pvmers are majority it makes sense that they wouldnt want to give a 'buff' to pkers. 
---
But a lot of the proposed content to wildly/pvp has actually passed. Things like wildly bosses/mage arena 2/pvp worlds/rev caves/bounty hunter all have passed. 
---
The main issue if you think about it. Its that jagex itself hasn't actually developed much content for wildly/pvp. A lot of the content that I listed are just copy and pasted from rs3. Pvp worlds we had before, rev caves we had before, bounty hunter we had before.  ACTUAL new content has been mage arena 2/wildly bosses. And tbh wildly bosses was a very meh update, they are just big mobs with some simple mechanics but its something. 
---
Dmm has probably  been one of the most succesful types of content they have developed. It pulls a shit ton of viewers every final and tourny and they need to keep making these types of tournies more. 
---
In other words, I think the main issue is lack of updated and lack of developed content for the pvp side of things. They have overfocused on slayer scape/instanced bosses and therefore pushed most ppl into this category, even streamers and content creators. And then because there is no content that allows people to try pvp, then they never try it. Dont learn how fun it is and start to hate pvp bec they get killed while doing clues. The end.

My girlfriend of 4 years lost her mother to alcohol. I cant tell you I know exactly how it feels, but I can tell you I'm thinking about you.

Hi I'm completely stuck in Mourning Ends Part 2. I just opened the blue door and got two more mirrors and a cyan crystal. Then I teleported out and destoryed these three items when I banked.   
---
When I got back, I can't get anything from the chest? I tried pulling the lever to restart, but I still get nothing from the chest. 
---
Can anyone help? 
---
Theres no reason to get 99 fletching other than to have a 99. But I just make unstrung yew longs while im at work. An inventory takes like 45-60 seconds. And i have a cozy desk job that allows me to take 5 seconds to bank and get more yew logs. Cant be wasting xp!
---
98 ranged and only 53 magic? Seems so unbalanced. Ice spells are a major advantage and you really should take any possible. DT is ez and Magic's major purpose is control/changing the fight. Skipping magic is like never having an arm day. 
---
The monkey one didn't feel too bad if you did it right after Monkey Madness I. By that point my brain just stopped processing difficulty. 
---
ooh thx
---
lol I started playing again after hiatus saw that wildy altar was a thing went there and got pk‚Äôd for 3 mil because I forgot world hopping was a thing 
---
[The YT link lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gKaFaawLkw) 
---
&gt;No one knows why.
---
pretty obvious, spinning wheel and range are both on west side, nothing is on the right...
---
I noticed it doesn't do it every time I check xp, only sometimes. But if I spam clicked my skills it would do it guaranteed. Probably some spaghetti code that got moved around last update.
---
What about your other dad?
---
The hardest and most frustrating was definitely dragon slayer 2, the one I left for last. Galvek killed me I‚Äôd say 15-20 times haha

It takes all my strength to not cringe at the thought that someone would go right and not have a pile of dead body's in there fridge

when i filmed it i wasn't planning to post it on reddit, i asked my brother to film it so i could send it on snapchat to my friend. however i thought the clip was funny so i decided to post it here
---
you are right on a few notes, (barrage for charms is a good point) but I disagree with the bulk. new content + power creep go hand and hand. cant release 15 cosmetic upgrade with stats = to rune plate (gross oversimplification but you get the point) without solidifying a particular gearset as the bis for years at a time. again, the "change is bad" mindset. if your worried about barrage charmers, then limit the amount of charms that can be obtained from ice barrage and the like. nobody barrages a common task. there are ways to mitigate massive xp gain by looking at easy loop holes like what you mentioned. and even they didn't change it at all, barrage for 99 summon would easily cost 50-100m bare minimum in runes.
---
There seems to be a lot going on in here.
---
First off, the #75 UIM died like an absolute retard with a scout that wasnt scouting, no concept of logging out, food, or protection prayers, and he walks into multi after getting attacked already.
---
He also has the exact same fucking name format as the guy that killed him.
---
Either him, or someone on his account has commented saying they basically dont give a shit about losing 5k hours of work.
---
There's also about 4 reddit accounts in here that are **very** defensive about the entire thing, linking to "his" comment, and share the exact same aggressive language.
---
So yeah, I'm inclined to say that this account is about to be de-ironed and sold or something.
---
Certain bosses only get their damage partially reduced too instead of fully mitigated. Mostly applies to Raid bosses though so not much to worry about in that regard until you're in the endgame.
---
He is 80 combat, he can use Konar. Look at this page: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten Everything a slayer level of 1 is what he would be assigned, no junk like dogs or anything. You should be getting 2+ keys per trip so thats 100-200k easily right there per task, in addition to drops like herbs, seeds, alchs, clue scrolls, etc. Plus while you're making as much/more at green dragons, every level you'll make more profit. Makes sense.
---
Whoa buddy, this isn't that sort of game, at all.
---
I have some bad news for you if you found Monkey Madness I difficult... You need 43 prayer and ~40 range (for it to not take forever) to do mm. I'll agree with you if you say it's tense, because it can be if you're not familiar with ape atoll, but there's not a difficult section in mm1.
---
i see some people mentioning the rfd/cellar bank. its actually a few tiles shorter, you inefficient noobs. 
---
how much u pay for the extended inventory
---
Nah, give it a few years and what's the opposite of Nostalgia, because you got that. 
---
back in my day, we had to make sure we left tutorial island with 25 mind and air runes if we wanted to use magic ever.
---
very simple if you've played any skill based mmorpg outside of runescape
---
That's a man.
---
Ooooh, I thought he/she was alching in lumbridge alone, and the red parts meaning he doesn't want anyone anyways (red thorns) but still feels alone.
---
and as far as summoning ruining endgame pvm‚Ä¶"a mysterious force prevents you from summoning a familiar here". fixed.
---
&gt; new content + power creep go hand and hand. cant release 15 cosmetic upgrade with stats = to rune plate (gross oversimplification but you get the point) without solidifying a particular gearset as the bis for years at a time
---
That's true but people try to avoid it as much as possible. Ferocious Gloves for example are BiS in melee technically, but a lot of people still opt to use Barrows Gloves in many situations where they use multiple styles because they don't want to bother bringing switches. Scythe is really strong but the cost of using it makes it actually unviable to use for most bosses outside raids unless you're going for records or pets. Sidegrades like these can slow down power creep by A LOT and the reason people really dislike Summoning is because it brings a lot of powercreep to multiple areas of the game, which instead could've been spread out overtime implemented as rewards for various pieces of content.
---
&gt;if your worried about barrage charmers, then limit the amount of charms that can be obtained from ice barrage and the like
---
Wouldn't leave a good taste with people IMO. A big part of what makes RS great is that there's no loot lockouts like in other MMOs, so you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. Reducing the droprate would also just make lower the amount you get from Slayer too or make Slayer less efficient. If you tie in the charms with Slayer tasks, then people would just feel forced to do Slayer if they want to train Summoning, and people would just Barrage/Cannon Slayer tasks anyways.
---
&gt;and even they didn't change it at all, barrage for 99 summon would easily cost 50-100m bare minimum in runes
---
It's not that much tbh, that'd put at like 4-8 gp/xp so relatively similar to other buyables (what they plan for Warding to cost atm).
---
But where is Guthan the invested?
---
I actually did this when I first started playing too ;_;
---
Who.... who hurt you..
---
They where funny now it's just completly retarded...
---
Get rigour, it‚Äôs better than DHCB and eagle eye, you‚Äôll get similar kills per trip anyway.
---
You want to know why I love dat boi? Dat boi is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not dat boi. Dat boi is completely absurd. It's a low-res frog on a unicycle, and an arbitrary method for greeting him. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Dat boi is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote dat boi, o shit waddup!
---
Gz man. I remember being hyped about my first kill as well. Hope you get some really good drops soon
---
I‚Äôve been playing since 2005. 
---
Never hacked once. 
---
Gg op
---
Heb je soms.
---
You think rigour is better than DHCB? I guess I should check out DPS calculator but I prioritize amount of kills/trip
---
and anyway once I get my own DHCB i‚Äôm gonna stay at vork until rigour. it won‚Äôt be far behind. making about 5-10m/day right now doing vork
---
hi it me poor girl, giv bando pls I lyk to melee slayer task :-)
---
And bobs
---
Clients can let you customize anything these days or they could use a private server, i dont see how a phone video would help.
---
Lol am a btw man but that is a major burn 
---
Yes, having a boss that is at full hp when you attack it and not giving you loot because someone attacking it 30 minutes ago is incredible for gameplay and makes it really fun and engaging.
---
Godwar bosses received this exact treatment because of this issue. I'm not suggesting to let me do damage on another account etc, all I'm saying is bosses should reset. If you think that's an intended limitation, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
I've never done it any other way
---
Obviously, we play medival pixel game.
---
I think there is a bug. I cant seem to swipe right.
---
No thats the wrong path
---
Larger PVP groups don't have to hunt down PKers in a foodchain at Revs. They simply lock down a world and abuse the 3x drop rate to skulled players with no risk. The whole update was designed by Jed to make RoT GP.
---
&gt;Its that jagex itself hasn't actually developed much content for wildly/pvp.
---
There isn't much to develop. Designing content has to affect PVM outside of the Wildy because otherwise no on will show up. REv caves had to nearly crash the economy and drop multiple items below alch price to get people to show up. Downside is that it means that the vast majority of people who play in the Wildy are PVMers who don't actually want to fight anyone, and PKers who want free and easy kills. There's no incentive to kill PKers attacking PVMers other than to secure the kill yourself.
---
As long as the only reason to enter the Wilderness is to become a chew toy for a PKer who will call you racial slurs, it'll stay dead.
---
People still play this game ? Lmao 
---
They dont hit you back so i dont think its a 20 min afk doing that
---
gongratz! how is life looking ?
---
It‚Äôs 3 and a half quests? You need 50-60 atk and str and you‚Äôre earning more than a gargoyle bot doing the same thing. There are collector ways to make more money but they‚Äôre not afk and there‚Äôs skilling which this doesn‚Äôt even require. You can literally have only combat stats and set this account up in a day or 2, so yeah there‚Äôs other more click intensive ways but this is super simple with almost no reqs and afk.
---
Ok we see your inventory and collection logs, now let‚Äôs see your bank. 
---
I saw someone earlier commenting this for herblore too, but I'm on android and did not have this problem while wcing. 
---
I would literally die for that thing

---
Is Augury worth it for Barrows runs or does it drain prayer too fast? I've got 80 Prayer.
---
I'm fairly certain you'd lose a lot of money doing blue dragons with a blowpipe, because they have decent defenses and at a low level you'll use more scales than what you get back in dps. Probably a skip for early levels, or doing the small ones (if Konar allows that).
---
simple as
---
A stripper who went back to a person's room is going to be doing that for a bit more than just stripping. They can do private dances at the club.
---
This my new fav thing
---
&gt;They simply lock down a world and abuse the 3x drop rate to skulled players with no risk.
---
Uhh....do you understand what "no risk" means? They're literally in multi combat wilderness with a bunch of shit. If 100 people rolled up and started barraging, they would get killed and lose their stuff. They are absolutely risking lol. 
---
I'm one of them. I don't like watching series backwards and #2 was first one I stumbled upon and I didn't expect to like it so it ended before I even knew. It was too late then
---
Lmao, turning off private chat to make some gains, can't even tell you how many times I've done that. Absolute top notch meme my dude!!
---
RoT is the single largest clan in game, and also have the most members in comms. They'd defeat opponents, and currently do. They own the 2000/2200 worlds and charge 100m to farm revs under their protection in those worlds. 
---
When ironmeme mode was introduced, it was said time and time again that ironmemes will not affect the game updates. Meaning that stuff shouldn't be easier or more obtainable because ironmen can't do something solo.
---
no, youre the only person in the world to do that
---
What an happy little coincidence.
---
Lol gl getting it before the Razor 6 is out.

Come in my lady, it might not look like a lot but I promise, once you firmly grab my wood you're in for a magical journey.

Need some money spending advice. Just came into about 10mil and I‚Äôm trying to get melee stats up for bossing. Currently 65/77/65 and I‚Äôve been training at bandits with a dragon scim.  Was thinking of buying Guthans for the heal for more afk potential or getting 70 for the whip.

Wow you should copyright this idea. This is certainly a brand new concept that no one in RuneScape or maybe even the world has ever done. You are the next Elon musk for sure. Maybe I have your autograph

And you decide to post a comment like this on the subreddit for said game? Why even browse here?
---
The thread was all about what yall do to entertain yourself when grinding. That you even take time out of your day to bullshit is lame
---
Wyrms wouldn't be half as bad if they didn't have that stupid shifting mechanism. Needing to click then click again is stupid. They should be aggro like drakes and hydras. I've only done about 400 but I got a dragon harpoon and was mildly upset.
---
lmfao WHAT
---
yes
---
If you think about it, it's really not that much. Making a baseless assumption that probably 1 in every 5 people who looked at this post upvoted it, that means that at least 500 people clicked on this thread, and likely read at least a handful of my posts. If I were to use the same 1/5 odds, that means that I should have received around 100 downvotes on at least one post, likely the one closest to the top. To only receive 30 downvotes out of 500 people, it's a little lacking.

Maybe they watched it at the move theatre

That is correct.

Well maybe you should read the updates. Then you would know.
---
Just curious OP but ya seem pretty far into ur account how have u avoided MM2 for so long?
---
Locking it to combat lvl is not the greatest idea just because of how terrible the combat lvl formula is.
---
Thanks for the reply. I‚Äôve changed passwords, again. 
---
Yet you made a reddit post about it but you wouldnt change the password.
---
Wat

This was exactly it, and I know not to click any links.

But it still scares me to think that some could possibly have submitted an email change request.

That‚Äôs not professional it‚Äôs passive aggressive. If you have employees playing games on their phone at work (if it isn‚Äôt okay to be doing that) then slap them the fuck down.

This is a complete repost of the "Loot from 99 runecrafting" picture. How badly do you need attention?

Solution to this would be to add a point value for each tile and If the competition ends we can tally up the points to see who wins. If there is a draw we can look at resolving it via a equal split or a quick challenge 
---
Can we make fun of skill specs?
---
I like to go up the right side but that's only because I have been doing it that way for the past 13-14 years now so it's just kinda stuck for me now

Whoever is baked enough to invest his time into that... give that man a price

Did I mention I'm an ironman by the way?

For real, fuck the pking clans, I recently had a pking clan at least 15 deep trying to kill my UIM in level 1 wildy while I was filling my looting bag

---
Unpolled update

I'm not sure if efficiency goes down as the % goes down so I could see people try to cap it at 100% daily but yeah if not you can just leave it
---
Yes officer that man right there.
---
Should i uninstall Konduit ?
---
I think he means ur online time, 292 days, almost a year ;)
---
I don't get why people are so mad.
---
It's literally the point of DMM to "lock down" areas.
---
If they wanted DMM to be a 1v1 tournament, then they should just skip the whole seasonal/week of grinding bullshit and give everyone set stats/rules and do knockout 1v1's.
---
But they don't, and people coming up with strategies to hinder the competition is interesting.

Man i was gunna reply with nah mate I just watch myself climb and shit. How did two people have the idea of replying sarcastically... Gosh

Konduit has been abandoned pretty much since early 2017, it came back shortly for a xerics update but then went back into abandonement shortly after.

I guess they closed doors for good.

A shame how that all went because when they were still actively updating in 2016 it was like runelite tier back before that existed. Just underrated.

Considering going for the music cape, but was wondering if the requirements on the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Music_cape) are correct, as they say you only need 75 slayer, but i see that i need a track from both the cerberus and hydra fight

Do i not need the slayer level to enter the fight area?

I mean most experience of PvP I have are people trying to skull trick me, or clans rushing you in multi in the wildy. That just puts a bad taste in my mouth from the get go 
---
I think getting full graceful is definitely worth it(shit ton of agility courses). If your combat stats are in the 60s definitely do monkey madness. Maybe go for the fighter torso although it's a grind and a half (what isnt). And quests for sure. Maybe have a goal of doing recipe for disaster.  
---
Shower... Shoes?
---
Can't do it out of fear for duping?  Have they tried playtesting before?  Apparently they dont know you can check an update before launching it live to see if it works.
---
The rule of thumb is to keep your str \~ 10 levels higher than attack, and to get 99 str + atk before leveling defense (once you can equip all the armor you want, at least). 
---
The reason being the extra DPS from the max hits that strength add are typically better than the bit of accuracy you get from higher attack, so by training strength first your exp/h will be better when you train attack, and by training atk+str first you'll get the best defense xp/h possible through melee.
---
Also... If you want to be one of those ultra efficient people, defense isn't best trained through melee. You can use chins to get more defense xp/h than you ever could through melee, but this comes at a fairly high cost.
---
You need to check the little details, and be one with the joke. 
---
Do your level herbs until 70 and then swap to ranarrs
---
The feel is real

Cannoning ogres west of Yanille, the caged ogres in the hardy training area. 
---
Yep, I've spent a lot of time abyss rcing, have been attacked dozens of times but never killed. They suck at pking so bad, which is why they target rcers in the first place most likely.

Cant you just sell it back for a minimal loss on nuggets

Pretty sure the rate is 3m/h for large sack or 4m/h for giant fella

It‚Äôs amazing what makes us feel comfortable and safe. Runescape got me through it too. Everything feels hopeless, but Runescape reminds you that if you set small goals, you can achieve them. And that starts to apply to life too.

Yeah, I didn't really know how to represent that so... kinda tried to draw red fragments from the hcim helmet blowing up

Do quests that give smithing experience like elemental workshops. Then just superheat iron and make iron dart tips till 40. At 40 smithing, gold ore with goldsmithing gauntlets at blast furnace.

I was in a stream once while I was at dks and the streamer asked where we were all from I heard someone say my state so I replied with the same state. Then they whispered me and asked where from. Turns out we live 15 min away from each other. Here‚Äôs the crazy part after we started talking we found out that we both went to the same high school in a town of 1200 people and he was about 5 or 6 years older so I never met him in person. But talk about the universe aligning. Maybe 150 people in the stream.

To be fair you still pulled 15k points with lower tier gear and you probably didn't die. If this was your first raid ever, you did really well for a learner!

This has nothing to do with that, and it affects regular accounts too

I'm no maxed player, or having 99 slayer, but I'm currently 83, and I've found to just do the tasks given and plow out as much exp as possible. I know Fire giants aren't the best gp in the game but their super quick (I find).

Keep doing what you're doing though. Seems that you already know what you need to do, it's just time now until you're actually the level you want to be.

Why is it more expensive to buy multiple bonds at once than buying a single one at a time? I‚Äôve never seen a video game have something cost more when buying more. 3 bonds for 20.99 or 1 bond for 6.99. 6.99 x 3= 20.97. Only a 2 cent difference, but why would I want to buy the higher quantity? There should be some incentive.

FR. Props to OP for setting such a time consuming goal that requires a lot of discipline and work, and then achieving it after thousand of hours. But at the same time I'm glad I quit osrs because playing like this must have such a negative effect on your real life. Even at 2 hours a day I got stuck in a depressive hole. 
---
I'm not going to tell people how they should life their lives because 'the best life' is such a subjective thing, but things like these are pretty insane and I have such a hard time imagining this to be a fun way of living.

Konduit was my favorite client. Switched to runelite only bc of how things weren't functioning properly anymore but the layout is my fav of all clients.

I was using super combat and it still didn't deal enough damage.
---
He should have lvled the resource skills first so he gets better drop at Wintertodt.
---
Lower your HP, the more optimal it is, there's literally nothing wrong with going to 99 straight away.
---
I think the poison will be too slow as well. It has 32 hp.
---
Not gunna continue an argument with somebody who clearly has no clue what he is talking about.
---
Dorg crossbow with bone bolts is extremely cheap if you just want to afk on sand or ammonite crabs. Faster exp is using a cannon in a mutli zone, or using chinchompas.
---
Now I'd like you to stand it your garden and look west as far as you can. Tell me what you see? 
---
Not my fault you're too naive to see the game is CLEARLY scaled. Like virtually all games lol
---
Lol dont mine in varrock...
---
That‚Äôs too much to think about. I get upset when I see my time and see that I‚Äôve sat several days of my life on the game. A whole year? Yeah no thank you. I‚Äôll take 5 years to max thank you I don‚Äôt mind. 
---
So a scale is an ordered set of notes, possibly directional, in a given key. 
---
But a key is just a collection of notes too? Ordered as well?
---
The difference between a scale and a key seems to be that keys are defined by their tonics and scales are kind of subsets of the keys by appropriating the tonic but tweaking the intervals ever so slightly?
---
[Raiksey has a 'making 1b gp starting as a level 3' series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh_oINwPDrE&amp;t=2s) that might interest you. It can show you both how easy and difficult it'll be to sustain a bond, how much it can hurt progress, and some ways to make money.

The mask would definitely sell for x100 more than the top/bottom

I got 83 construction instead of doing my diaries lol

If you don't have enough content to not include "close kills" (claw speccing someone on 40 HP with melee pray on is close to you?) and salad robe warriors, get more clips before you make a video.

Idk about you man but I bring 1k superior dragon bones into wildy to show how much of a man I am. I bring a Ely along with a sang staff and full justicar just to flex on the pkers. Then, to show my superior levels of testosterone, I skull before I teleport up. Mama didn't raise no b*tch

Well you're kinda supposed to switch to Diamonds at around ~300 health anyway because after you get diminishing returns from the damage.
---
Art in it‚Äôs highest form

Just keep skipping them, they never skull. You don't get penalized for skilling an unskulled opponent. And if they do skull they're risking 180k to 3.5M against your g maul so stop bitching.

I've pked at all combat brackets @ the abyss runecrafting spot, it's so easy to kill people here... Am I missing something? You said you're wearing full rune... nice mage def. All you want is reddit karma, bullshit post.. next pls &gt;\_&gt;
---
I didn't read the whole post but the general rule for rng is that nothing is guaranteed. It is completely random with base rates as a guide/estimation of when you may expect certain items. You could get a whip on your first abby demon task, or on your 10th. There are no guarantees.
---
However with this being said, I have always found the drop rates to generally balance out over time. For example going dry on anything for a number of times will then most likely lead to getting the drops in quick succession. This is obviously not always the case, just my experience :) 
---
Hey man, I cant say if it gets better or not, since I'm still waiting. What I can say is you're not alone.
---
My mom has been an alcoholic since before my brother and I were born (she started at 19 and is now 55). She has had multiple heart attacks and at one point died (was resuscitated) infront of my brother and I (we were getting ready for school).
---
Shes had plenty of surgery and issues because of alcoholism; falling down the stairs, passing out in the front yard and hitting her face on a tree, falling off the deck, car accidents, cutting herself with knives/gardening scissors, etc. 
---
Her doctor told her she needs to stop smoking and drinking if she wants to see her kids grow up. But she didnt care. So now we watch her destroy her body and bring herself closer to death every day. As bad as it sounds, everyone is waiting for it to happen. 
---
So you're not alone, it's a super shitty situation but you always can have people to talk to. If you need to chat just hit me up. Best of luck fam
---
I hope he doesn't get banned. This is brilliant.
---
Yeah, I afked crabs this semester from 175m-200m while studying and at work.
---
It makes no difference to you. You‚Äôd have to clean the herbs before hand before you put them into your bag. This doesn‚Äôt matter if you do it during the task or after. This suggestion only hurts other players. Especially since the herb sack is designed to increase carrying capacity for players during a slayer task. You then severely limit its functionality by this suggestion.

They wanted to fill out that area of the map but didn't really have time to design and balance much content. So West just mapped it out without really adding anything in particular to do there. I think the plan is to revisit it and add a few more useful things once they've got some downtime between bigger updates.

The fact that this isn't already in the game is a disgrace jagex!

Changed my life no exaggeration 
---
There's barely "thousands" of people even playing this game so that's pretty dramatic. We've seen maybe 10 requests on reddit for this in the past year so thousands is a reach.

Seems like a new issue from the last update. I frequently stop getting herbs/ seaweed when farming when I switch to skills tab to look at xp.

---
I like the structure, what can I say? Yeah, the giant green boxes are nice from RuneLite, but I want to have a specific point I go to every time, so I made it. I've done this at Varrock and Canifis too, improving efficiency by having every click laid out on a map. It also allows me to map in variance, like tile difference and size, as well as falls. This doesn't account for possible falls you might have from an obstacle on the pyramid, which is almost every one of them. It would look more like a vortex lol.
---
Just Google wedoraids. They've got a website, you can look at different gear suggestions and stuff. When you raid with them though, Don't expect to get split drops, it usually ends up as a ffa.

---
Wintertodt is the easiest to do at 10hp, as you only get hit 1s. So you can use cake you steal from ardy to heal. The reason for 89 is you're actually going for 60 wc, for yew trees, which ends up getting you around 89 fm. It also helps you get a ton of materials to help you skill a little later on.

That‚Äôs speculation. Stripping is legal, prostitution is not. She seemed to say it was them that would proposition her and she would agree to it with the intention of stealing from them. Granted this is something prostitutes do ALL THE TIME so I can see why you would make the connection, but there is nothing that suggests she was an escort or a prostitute on the side, and considering how stupidly honest she is about everything, I‚Äôd say if she was there is a good chance we would already know.

You can't complete a souls bane on a 1 def pure as you get 500 def XP. That's why many here don't have it.
---
You still need to deal one damage or do the phantom damage method (stalling interface while she respawns) but yes it's not changed.
---
That guy looks very sickly whoever he is. Kind of anemic looking tbh

Also true. I'm not too familiar with what Ed or West have planned with Slepe or the Drakan continuation. If it fits that rather than treasure trails, sure!

How many kills/hr do you need to make barrows effective? I've been trying to do it for some desperately needed cash, but as best I'm only getting about 10 kills an hour and only making ~3-400k, barring luck with drops.

Also some suggestions for shops:
---
- Regular Cape Shop, so F2Pers can buy coloured capes instead of having to dye them or buy them overpriced from GE. Sells all coloured capes including Pink Cape (despite Pink Dye being Members Only).
---
- Fish Tackle shop near the fish spots. This one will only sell feathers/bait, so it's inferior the one in Port Sarim.
---
- Pet Shop across the road from the Dog Park.
---
The pet shop will sell 4 different types of dogs:
---
- Brown Terrier: same model as Varrock's [Stray-Dog](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Stray_dog).
---
- Grey Terrier: same model as [Gabe](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Gabe).
---
- Golden Retriever: same model as the [Dog in Myth's Guild](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_(Myths%27_Guild).
---
- Sheepdog: same model as the [Sheepdog](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Sheepdog) in Falador Farm.

Yet another reason Guthix D'hide is the best =P But yah, like 7 recolors of Pegasains to match the different Blessed D'hide, Black D'hide, Gilded D'hide, and so on would be a bit much. Also, there is a problem applying it to the other boots; if you recolor Prims to match Barrows or Bandos, they'd probably look like guardian Boots... And a Red Pegasians would probably look like Prims too. Recolors for items that are distinct are generally fine, but when color is how you tell them apart from other items then recolors start to pose a problem.

Yeah, maybe I just need to suck it up and get the agility level. I did 10 runs early and only got 400k in runes, but making that 600k instead would've been much nicer.
---
Except all it does is save time. You're buying high value items to put into a box that would be safe anyway. But it's okay to have a friend mule for you. 
---
Oh okay this makes sense and to avoid making another post Ill ask one more question lol. Why are people buying grape seeds as well ? never ever heard of them until today 
---
what about windowlicker
---
Why it‚Äôs not anywhere remotely close to runecrafting, it‚Äôs closer to warding if anything. But if you do make the fountain give xp, then charging it in legend/hero‚Äôs guild should give xp as well.

Fire Giants in the catecombs can be 130k cb xp/hr. I'd do it for that until maxed combat. Fire Giants and bloodvelds are both really good for cb xp because they have almost no defense and high hp.

Someone's jumping on their soapbox. If you take what I said as a complaint then you have the bar set pretty low. I have a blast PKing and tribridding as a 1 def pure. I wouldn't be playing RS right now if it weren't for this build, it actually makes the game fun for me. But I understand with how this subreddit is, you hear 1 def pure and PKer and immediately justify that we are complaining when it's most always the opposite.
---
Ok but why
---
The entire point of that mechanic is that he is immune when he launches the breath. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.
---
Make friends and theyll teach you how to raid. Stay away from WeDoRaids. Its full of toxic elitists who claim to teach but really they flame people for the smallest mistakes.
---
update with the loot pls
---
Placing a non pet chin in could give a message "this might explode if I put it in there"
---
This makes so much sense, you sacrifice the pure essence on the altar of the element you craft at destroying the pure essence and infusing your rune stone with that energy (or converting the one pure essence into the rune)
---
I've never seen it on reddit and thought its pretty unique for osrs. But I wasn't sure, hence why I asked
---
Oh, take the stick out of your ass and try to have a little fun for a change. and it's not been days it's been entire weeks! I'm practically immortal!
---
lmao ya lol reeeeeeeeeeeeee 
---
Pretty much no.
---
13 def is kind of neat if you want a low defense main account just for shits, but if you want to pk you pretty much want 1 defense or 42+.
---
But that doesnt create conversation nor a sense of community

Sorry, I forgot how much this subreddit hates PKers. Just about everyone I play with who has a main, also has a pure. It just depends on the community you surround yourself with, I'm just used to primarily seeing pures. My apologies.

Just buy Nature runes, c'mon or craft them if you cheap ass.

no barrows gloves?

Damn that really sucks, they got on your ass real quick.

They haven't logged in yet I believe (24 hours passed). Ive logged in every 12 hours to see what they did but I haven't spotted any damage yet, I don't even think they tried to change the PIN. I basically have like 7 days to get everything fixed before they can change the PIN, its like im in 'The Ring' but its OSRS phishing edition.
---
As I said, I don't play anymore but it would be sad to see the account get fucked. I got a quest cape on release of OSRS and it was amazing, I had achieved everything I wasn't able to as a kid because of language issues. I have great memories of this game and I hope to not lose them by my dumb mistake lol.
---
anyways, you are a trooper for rebuilding your account. Keep it up my G, this world is yours for the taking.

This is really bad advice. WeDoRaids is the best place to go learn. This person obviously had a bad experience with a mentor and should report that person to the mods

I get he‚Äôs supposed to be immure, that‚Äôs not what I wanted to bring up. The timing of that phase just seems off to me, as in there seems to be a few tick delay between when his immunity starts and when he actually launches his attack. Same as at the end of the phase after killing the spawn. It seems the phase is on a time clock from beginning to end and not affected by specific events.

he does viewbot  look at the people in the chat there are like 10 people are talking an it saying there are like 200 people watching yeah i am ok thanks. he is a scammer i hope he gets ban or worse.

No pretty sure it is all about counterweight. Dont believe everything on the internet

Hey, I run a 10 def pure but pretty much as above. It‚Äôs not as optimal as a 1 def pure,  it‚Äôs mainly just for the fashionscape/slayer helm aha!

That's the real pro strat

I would get them pre 99s if possible though since they do moderately help in one way or another

I think it has to do with making the person with the tab Tele there on accident and then get rushed

nope you are correct. its inefficient in the sense that you'll use more staminas wearing heavy armour but as long as you dont run out of run energy at any point your laps will be the same speed, minus the small amount of extra time spent sipping stams

Same lmfao smh jigglyflex.

I mean the tournament is wildly unpopular. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a Reddit think. It‚Äôs old school runescapes big tournament and honestly most people right now don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs happening
---
Only reason it didn't get a downvote from me
---
Agreed game needs the variety to not be stale. Not every item needs to come into the game the way it currently stands is not a bad thing. I get why people despise wildly content due to how annoying it can be to get pk‚Äôed but the wildly is the wildly and you need the bad to have the good IMO. Having things like the dragon pick as a Wiley only thing keeps wildly alive as well because people are always going to want that item. There‚Äôs a whole ecosystem in place that Jagex has to consider when doing anything to the wildly that is delicate and one seriously bad change could set of the reaction the kills the wildly like in rs3.  There‚Äôs nothing game breaking about how it is now as far as balance goes and shouldn‚Äôt be changed just so people can get items they want without risking getting pk‚Äôed. Again it‚Äôs only a handful of truly good items that have to be got this way compared to over a hundred of high level gear that does not. 
---
&gt; Not dislike but actually who cant pvp. 
---
You certainly can pvp. 
---
I'm nowhere near anything skilled and I have a blast all the time either roaming the wildy looking for people to hunt down or making low level accounts and fighting at edge. 
---
I die alot too, but it's still fun! 
---
The only thing I'd note is to avoid trying to pk on a main. Our stat distributions often aren't put well for PvP, and we can easily be outclassed. 
---
Make a new account for pking and you should do fine. 
---
&gt;There is a skill gap.
---
There will always be someone better, but there are plenty of people on par with my skill, and I am the opposite of skilled. 
---
If you are good at any high level PvM, you are likely already better than me and would outclass me in a PvP fight, as long as you took the time to learn the basics. 
---
Here's some good tips: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7aolkd/pvp_cheat_sheet_pking_for_newbs/
---
Plus just google a guide for PvP. 
---
You didn't go into Zulrah blind, you had to do some research. Same applies here. 
---
&gt; Every pvper can quickly learn pvm 
---
Lol. I can barely do Zulrah. Even Jad gets me frozen up. 
---
&gt;but not every pvmer can learn to brid as quickly.
---
If you can do Zulrah you can brid. 
---
Hell, if you can do Jad, you can likely brid. 
---
Obviously you won't be a god. But you don't become good at Zulrah in 10 minutes, same applies here. 
---
I can brid okay as long as its melee/range, its really not that hard. Range/mage is harder, but still, if you're good at PvM, you should be able to hand it with some practice. 
---

Definitely a trebuchet. It's a simple google search to tell the difference

Wow man you shouldn't be bringing the trade center down like that.

Doesnt that take so much longer to tele to your house though?

Eh getting scammed is usually just getting out smarted. This is more "getting scammed" than teleporting to v square and dying to a guy unknowingly waiting there but ya idk what to call it.
---
Nice
---
Ye, totally this is top tier trash, nothing in this world compares to this. Kappa.
---
Yeah but then to actually complete it you need 175 qp. Ive been grinding that out for months off and on. Rfd is the opposite of short. Unless you just want the bank unlock, then its very short.

Lots of starting money, herbs, gems and such from doing wintertodt. Its actually more efficient to grind until arond 85 fm and continue the grind with 50+ in farming herblore mining and fishing but most Btw's just stick to it untill 99

You can make ludicrous money through tips if you get lucky. Plenty of people willing to throw tens of mils at a generous host.
---
one of the best reward from the quest, gives u unlimited teleports to barrows brother,s dark,morty and swamp Pog
---
1. You will double the amount of runes obtained from Barrows after completing the Fremennik hard diaries, making Barrows much more profitable.
---
2. With a whip, you will deal more damage. This will give you faster kills, more kills per trip, less food needed per kill and faster xp. Whip is worth it.
---
3. Some bosses, like the Crazy Archeologist, are doable, however your stats are still not high enough for most bosses being efficient.
---
4. You definitely have the stats to complete the Fight Caves, however it may be tricky if it would be your first serious attempt. I recommend you watching one or two tutorials.
---
5. King's Ransom for Piety prayer would be useful. MM 2 could be too tricky, but you can also try/start the quest. The other quests are fairly easy though, so why not complete it.
---
6. Zulrah would not be possible unless you are very familiar with the boss I think. With combat 100 it took me fifteen tries for my first kill.
---
7. Fremennik hard (like I said at 1), Varrock medium for GE tele. I don't know all the perks by heart but the wiki is useful for that information.
---
exp/hr?
---
&gt;It‚Äôs pretty ez and quick. It‚Äôd take you like 4-5 hrs if u have dt and the qp req
---
Yeah, and getting a college degree is short too if you cut out all studying and classes required and just attend the commencement ceremony.
---
Those requirements you listed are just as much a part of the quest and it's a long grind overall. 
---

This is a big shitshow, didn't expect anything less.

This is actually really common in live broadcasts. It's called, at least when I worked in live tv, damage control and the announcers are given a list of topics to discuss in the event of something catastrophic. For this, it was the number of mobs killed.

Last tourney, Abdullah was in full rags, he dropped kids in max and got into top 32 only to lose to suffering and DFS.
---
Give everyone who died to the fog 94 base stats and a list of arbitrary gear
---
That doesnt even define anything. Every catapult has some sort of compound leverage. What makes a trebuchet is counterweight whether it be literal mass on one end or traction. Every other tradition catapult is tension or a bow
---
I just have 1k+ ROW rip. 
---
This is called being professional and mature, theyre being paid by Jagex to commentate. Theres a time and place for calling Jagex out on their complete and utter incompetency and voicing their opinions on how Jagex is just a complete failure and doesnt care about PvP.
---
And right now is not that time.
---
So, can we officially drop DMM after this? Waste of resources and abundant in drama.
---
Basically the new Apex Legends and Fortnite. Congrats 
---
Why am I even surprised anymore?

ü¶ÄIT'S NOT DMM WITHOUT DRAMAü¶Ä

Shared whip is better if he just wants grind all his stats during slayer, where the whip will generally be more accurate and hit harder than the dagger. The fastest way for melees iirc is to train attack during slayer with whip, train stength in nmz, and train defense with defensive barraging.
---
Actually he says he has been snared or tbed, but not both, which is what I said.
---
Thanos would have only killed half tho.
---
Ah ok so they haven't technically died then? I saw that everyone is getting reset to highest base lvl 94 stats (if above) and getting some items of their bank back. 
---
You realized that most of the player base doesn‚Äôt give af about DMM right? 
---
H
---
Bruh.. Its like they fuckup any chance they get
---
Imagine thinking this lmao
---
Supposed to be gerrymandering: its political parties drawing district lines in ways that dont make sense to give a certain party an advantage
---
They fucked up, again. Not much more needs to be said, tourny is paused for another 20 mins.

Jagex just put the damn pet option on and use the smithing animation without the hammer next to the dog and I'll be happy with that
---
Awesome idea, reminds me of pyrovision from tf2

I know XD I blame it on not having enough coffee lol, fixed it now
---
Seasons are neat but I'm down for axing the finals
---
I've never had that happen to me. I've always just took a candle and a tinderbox and been completely fine. I know the candle can go out and you start taking damage unless you light the candle again but that's about all I've had happen. You can thieve a bullseye lantern from inside the dorgeshuun place but you can't get it without crafting it otherwise I believe

It's not fair to fuck over so many players who put in hundreds of hours just so they can get a bit of publicity.

Bruh... It's like they fuck up every chance they get to look competent.
---
Ayiza "This is just what happens when you have a game being played on live servers with people all around the world"  
---
As if that has fucking anything to do with what happened, which is yet another in a series of QA failures that would be picked up if they had any process AT ALL to check before they ship

What exactly do you mean RS2 OSRS is RS2?

It's when a politician intentionally draws congressional districts with the intent of skewing votes based on how certain portions of the district tend to vote.

So, the above poster just totally slaughtered the use of the word. Who knows what he meant to say? It will forever be a mystery.
---
Someone needs to make a weekly recap series at this point. Drama calendar too small. 
---
But all the grinding for specific gear was for nothing now...
---
domp it
---
There's no other solution, and they have to do something quick because they're still live. As a dev watching DMM for the first time I'm blown away that something like this can happen. Where was the QA testing? This bug should have been the first thing to come up. lmao

Eh, I think for somet people just getting to overheads, not maximizing prayer rates is less important than just getting there.

Also if you wanna talk cost effective, just use reanimated heads.

That's why Annakarl was kept alive

What is this garbage lmao
---
i mean like late rs2 pre rs3
---
I know what gerrymandering, I was making fun of OP.
---
lol
---
Its baffling at this point @ how completely incompetent they are.
---
Wouldnt hold my breath on the "fixes" and "interest" they have in actually giving attention to PvP, theyll surely fuck that up massive as well.

What‚Äôs the point of your comment bro...

I will upvote these types of posts every time I see them

I hope they give everyone Piety too, I'll just outright die laughing.

I believe they made the finals area a safe zone so as everyone was teleported they were insta-killed, mega yikes on whoever coded that.

I‚Äôm on mobile &amp; suck at memes but it‚Äôll be awesome.

I assume all they are doing is letting the same account log back in then changing the stats since they lose 7 levels of unprotected stats and then giving them gear

Damn brb getting my house up

My suggestion for the next tournament. Don‚Äôt hold one

Looks like Torvesta missed a bullet thid DMM, ah who am I kidding something would've Happened. Jamflex is powerless even against itself.

They should probably just postpone the final and get it sorted out then

Congrats, but also fuck you

People host their houses there and you can train prayer there

Retards like you need to get your head our of their ass. MMK has said time and time again that DMM brings in more money than it takes.

There's a reason that DMM seasonals release has always broke player's online record time and time again before mobile release.

How are we gonna fit all of this on the March drama calendar?

I agree it‚Äôs bad, but tbh fuck clanman mode

WAS IT THAT HARD JAGEX?

I don‚Äôt have time to follow. Can someone explain what happen after? Did they restart? Release why? Or what will happen? 
---
Too much makeup and badly done too.
---
How did the roll back work on league? Like they rewind the game 5 mins?

imagine grinding hours and hours getting like 4 hours of sleep a night and then getting your stats reset and losing gear

This is how  jagex wants ppl to play dmm join a clan or dont play #fools

I'll take 5

If only it was next month, something to add to the drama calendar. I'm sure something else will pop up though.
---
Not only that, but everyone would have to strategize and plan their course of action more precise.

They are not going to get piety, quest are not unclocked. But overall this is not helping us(Fools). Gona be fun if some 50 level now gets base 94 and wins this, I actually dont mind.

Its sad in order for me to mine iron on my f2p ironman i had to wait in intervals for when the bots would bank allowing me to get a good 10-12 ores. Then hop to a world where the bots were banking again. But finally hit 500 total worlds so they're gone at most spots now.

In these cases you build environments where you can run automated tests in as close to the same conditions as possible. Though I'd believe this error was always present, and only appears under unlikely conditions (like everyone lasting longer than expected.)
---
They'll probably give 1 weeks membership to everyone that was affected and a good ole apology. 
---
Jagex are playing it off ATM as something that could have happened to anyone and keep trying to reiterate that it was 'only a couple of people' affected.
---
???????

Always. Nothing better than instantly wiping people that grinding your game all day long for a week. The crab memes get annoying but damn they just keep giving them more ammo.

I thought the Torvesta fuckup was bad enough to make it meme of the month, but damn this is some shit

Ayiza doesn't work for Jagex. Don't pay what he said any attention.
---
During the stream there was a brief mention about new players not falling for fake streams; one of the announcers clearly avoided using the word "never" and said that double XP will "probably" not come to OSRS; and had a tiny moment where they were trying to find the right wording.

New employees WILL fuck up, and any competent employer has policies and safeguards in place to prevent catastrophes.

If some new junior dev can completely break the game by *accident* then that's definitely a bad sign. And it doesn't mean the employee has any blame to share, Jagex needs to have their shit together enough to prevent mistakes.

sooo uhh i'm pretty clueless about dmm(or pking overall), but basically they fucked up, gave(or tried) the dead people shit gear that you can't compete with anyway, then the dead players couldn't even log in and they just said "fuck it we are tired of trying" and basically spit in their faces?

unless the compensation is the prize money for literally every dead player how the fuck are they going to make up for it?

Absolute fucking shambles of a company with incompetent employees all over the place.

Im gonna say it. Even with all their fuckups coming from WoW:BFA i would still rather play OSRS right now. Jagex&gt;blizzard. Except in customer service. Ill give blizzard the edge in customer service. BUT customer service doesn‚Äôt keep me playing if the game play goes in a direction i dislike.

I would say to just start with questing your stats up and then maybe get your construction to at least 50 so you can get a house with teleports and an altar.

I still can't believe this is a real screenshot.

The 128 people that lived in fally died when they were teled to 1v1 due to a bug and couldnt get back in so all the 1v1 is taking place with random people from annakarl

I'm not being childish. People that grinded for days arent able to even try due to jagex fucking up.

Yeah, chances are this guy thought he was untouchable and people proved him wrong.

nobody asked incel

If WoW was how it was like 5+ years ago would I fuck be still playing osrs. Jagex are a fucking joke but the game itself is still solid. I'm so conflicted.

LUL they killed him manually

isnt DMM pretty much a free space though

THEY SAY IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME. YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE
---
You can‚Äôt blame them for not putting their job on the line

?
---
Right, it isn‚Äôt, if you ever listen to a cop pronounce a suspect they always use African American instead of black. Maybe they have a reason for it but either way you can say black or African american. Just like Mexican or hispanic. It‚Äôs just a preference
---
I any other game, this would be unacceptable. As a junior software dev, I can't imagine this was some sort of edge case bug that couldn't have been tested. As a casual player this also makes me really afraid for the technical stability of the game. 
---
Honestly it is sad to see that PvP'ers get the short end of the stick once again. Makes you wonder when enough is enough.

get 3k upvotes on reddit

should commemorate this monumental fuckup by changing the examine option on the fala statue by saying: DONT STAND THERE!! YOU‚ÄôLL DIE!!

what happened, i don't understand without context to the photo
---
5 hours? l0l.

We need to change this to a weekly calendar lol.
---
They‚Äôd only be lying if they said these sometimes don‚Äôt happen
---
They killed all the people to got to the 1v1s from falador and couldnt restore the stats so they gave them all 94 stats and shitty gear, while having to go against the people from anakar with good gear. Also half of the players from falador couldnt login after they died.
---
Wdym?
---
Theres this clip from a skiddler stream where he was telling a story about being on stage at all stars with ditter and purpp. Apparently ditter stank heaps and purpp straight up said something like 'imagine getting paid by jagex to fly here and play on stage and you come smelling like a fukin sewer rat'
---
You are a bold one
---
They shouldn't be trying to push the esport thing at all. Like this game is almost the exact opposite of what competitive gamers look for in an esport. It just shows a complete lack of understanding of the rest of the gaming world.
---
The fuck up was the bug that happened, yes. However I do think that the actual production value (spectating/commentating) has definitely gone up over time. They really do need to do some damn testing before the finale though -.-
---
ok maybe american cops but you're not a cop and this is the internet not the streets so chill
---
What a suprise they fucked it up again 
---
This can't be real but it is and it's hilariously sad
---
Despite making up 13% of runescape‚Äôs map falador is the site of 100% of the drama
---
That face that says ''I knew Jagex would probably fuck up again, but I didn't know they could fuck up THIS bad''.

We can't question them. They are literally the Java Gaming EXPERTS. We have to bow down to them.

Lol easy to lvl wut

What happened to Sparc? ive been watching his streams because jagex was 'zzz'. went to peak the official stream and they have already started?

What did they fuck up this time

Thought it was deadman, not fucking story mode. 
---
Typing \ because you are panicking lmao, great detail man great job.
---
I just gave you an example. Holy shit your ignorant. I even said it‚Äôs a preference and that‚Äôs my preference. Smfh, I never said it‚Äôs racist to call someone black. Your pulling ideas out of your own ass. Lol
---
A bug causes a whole munch of DMM players to instantly die and get locked out of the tournament finals a few hours ago. Not good.
---
People getting kicked out of DMM and not getting put back in is like jagex banning accounts falsely and not helping the people recover them.
---
No you aren't original or clever
---
&gt; both appeals have been denied despite showing evidence of being the creator. 
---
If you were showing (enough) evidence to Jagex of being the account creator, your appeals would have been accepted. 
---
&gt;  In the past I was able to email with a jagex moderator
---
I highly doubt this. You're not able to properly identify yourself without **(A)** having access to the registered email or **(B)** going through the recovery form. 
---
Jagex is unable to help you outside those two options. Because they're unable to identify you, they can't give you personalized feedback (other than what their existing process gives), let alone give you access to the account.
---
If you get past their automatic check, you're really close to getting accepted. If so, you should be getting generic feedback. Improve on the things Jagex wants you to improve. Eventually you should get accepted.
---
Oh wow 
---
that was a working and update day, tomorrow is a sunday so i highly doubt anything will happen
---
Falador final zone survivors got nuked when they were sent to the 128s, then got 94 base stats and basic gear. They couldn‚Äôt recover the accounts. 
---
They say they get a lot of views and what not during dmm so it‚Äôs necessary for the growth of the game. The views they are probably talking about are the people talking about the fuckups
---
F
---
The production value may have improved, but it isn‚Äôt appropriate to bring that point up while viewers are waiting for a tournament finals that has been delayed because of a bug they should have tested that resulted in hundreds of players dying for no reason losing their items and stats that they grinded for weeks for. It just isn‚Äôt very smart.
