Still not polling wintertodt damage scaling?
---
Xp waste...
---
Hey now, as a brony I want nothing to do with ROT. Not even *we* want them.
---
I mean it would be but i still get the same message across and adding that on a phone is kinda ass
---
sure, ty.
---
My main is 80 slayer and i have never gotten a skeletal wyvern task nor a gargoyle task. I have done BBD offtask and they seemed fine tho were really crowded. So i am not sure how they compare to the other monsters
---
Hes hilarious
---
in max gear rapier is a bit better
---

---
edit: looks like bludgeon &gt; tbow too according to the dps calculator, though that isn't factoring in the extra dmg you take or dps loss from ghosts etc.
---
auto full auto? is that a new kind of botting?
---
The wiki has a guide for Twisted League, that might be useful for you.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League/Guide
---
Phew as long as the lore stays intact, otherwise it'll be pandemonium at the G.E. Elves and goblins, dwarves and dragons!
---
Won’t be bad but he is weak to crush
---
Start an adventure into the great, vast unknown. The gate north of Falador will now be unlocked, and there's word around Varrock that King Roald is seeking an adventurer's hand in saving a priest on the River Salve. If neither of those options appeal, you could also venture to a warmer locale.  Southeast of the Al Kharidian palace, Shantay will now be more inclined to let you through his desert pass. For the right price, that is.
---
The most important thing is to do the things you enjoy. OSRS is a game about personal goals and finding the determination to complete them. Some of us enjoy skilling, some of us enjoy slaying (monsters and players alike!). Some of us rejoice with company, others find solace in the rewards of the solo grind. 
---
So when you press confirm, you will have many roads before you. The sheer number of possibilities can be daunting. However, with a pinch of perseverance and curiosity as your guide, a new adventure lies on your horizons, waiting to explored.

Petition to let the stray dog kill your cat
---
So nobody.
---
There's also a big potential for new players to join with HD graphics since alot are deterred by the current graphics.
---
So how does it work if an iron man "crashes" another ironman, does nobody get the drops?
---
The red music notification in the chat box Is already a feature of runelite I believe.
---
Just got 1300 credit cards from some dar.... Applications being completed, tell me more.
---
royal we, meaning I.
---
Petition to force inhumane pet owners to to forfeit their pet to good owners.
---
Remember there are alot of bots online because of the free membership
---
Bonds arent worth it anymore if you can't consistently get enough excess gold to buy one man. Just buy mems with irl money
---
It really do be that way.
---
Plus I’d rather get rid of bots before and graphical updates
---
They didn't want everyone to pick artisans, so they moved rc lol
---
Petition to muster an army of stray dogs and cats and unleash them on unsuspecting players

---
Always thought that dog deserved a master quest lol
---
From my understanding it's MTX free in terms of you can't use the cosmetics was the suggestion. That's based on Jagexs response being "that would be a bit bland" when they answered it on a recent live stream.
---
wyverns and gargoyles are also super crowded tbh, bbd will probably be your best bet
---
sometimes I log into 526 late at night and im literally the only one there
---
Unable to be frozen is still better since you can do that frozen and hide under them and get free hits mechanic
---
Heads up, this game as a whole will go offline at some point in the future.
---
Guess what?
---
Buying mem isn't worth it anymore if you can't consistently get enough money to buy one man. Just buy mem's with bonds
---
[Da Tweekaz - The Grove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO4OW-_LaVg)
---
Or just make ring of forging.
---
There would be new ones and the old ones
---
You need to position the camera so the "build" and "remove" options are on top of where you right-click. You're losing time whenever you need to move your mouse. I was able to get about 340k/hr, which still isn't 470k, but I also wasn't being tick perfect the whole time
---
Are you a main account? I’d be willing to donate a whip for you warrior!
---
Re-read the news post for Twisted League. They said they may look into adjusting the point costs of rewards near the end of the league, because they want rewards to be accessible to all.
---
Woox doesn't have a statue in the myths guild
---
He doesn't have a tier 5 relic yet
---
No, thank God.
---
This had me dying laughing Hahahaha, had to flex the 90 strength
---
yeah, this makes it both faster and easier.
---
You see that cheeky smile? Woox knew *exactly* what that is lmao.
---
Sick man gratz! You got the full ranging starter kit from 1 clue?
---
Buying money isn't worth it anymore if you can't consistently get mems to buy a bond. Just buy money with mems
---
[removed]
---
It’s an elite task, so I think 500 ~~or 1000~~
---
e: task [list](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League/Tasks#Master), its 500
---
Somebody made an OSHD client that was around for like 2 weeks that pretty much got you banned if you used it for longer than an hour. Then it got cease and desisted and the dreams died
---
I got lance first cause its more useful at olm than dhcb
---
Neive
---
Going dry for double the drop rate is about a 5% chance, 1/20...unlucky and it sucks, but nothing special
---
Well the pic OP showed has a lot of grey pixels.
---
Is it just me or are nechrael tasks cancer?
---
The response has always been “if you want more slayer helm colors you need to have multiple helms”
---
I think that although giving the ability to store different  slayer revolve items in the slayer helm would be nice, it doesn’t seem that likely. I dunno
---
No use your bankspace or just dont get it, this isnt pokemon
---
I dont remember seeing a 1000 point one but the 500 point one is 50m xp I think
---
the reward isn’t really in the 5 gp you save as much as the extra inventory slot you get from not having to bring it with you
---
East side or gtfo.
---
Its a fair amount but you have 2 months so even casually playing you should get that. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm at like 4k points without doing any combat yet, so in the 2 months you should be able to get that with almost any amount of playing.
---
Its long, ive played 2 days and only have like 800 points
---
Killing monsters drops essence.
---
Because a player vs player game streams better and appeals to a larger audience. You don't need to play osrs to realise someone is attacking other players. I don't think anyone is looking at 20 people trying to mine the same copper ore and being drawn in by that.
---
its 500, just looked it up, youre right!
---
Bold of them to assume I'm selling my rewards to them in the first place.
---
Are you bursting them?
---
Near the end is no good. That means we have to play through most of the league not knowing how much things will cost, and by the time we do find out, the event is ending and there's nothing we can do about it.   
---
It's something that needs to be addressed as soon as possible, so people know what they're getting into and can adjust their plans accordingly.
---
Entity hider
---
Wasting xp on reddit. Not serious
---
Is there an easy way to cheese Bounty Hunter anymore? I destroyed my Rune Pouch accidentally and 750 slayer points is a little hefty
---
Yummy..
---
He isn't stopping people from playing how they want by stating his opinion
---
Tree spirits for rune axe, nurmof for rune pickaxe. Msb is good though.
---
I like to play it while playing on my main so I just sat down and did one skill. Then kept going haha.
---
Ok
---
You are moving your wrist and clicking way more often when 3ticking. Why are you so butthurt lol
---
Yeah, i got everything in the inventory except the pickaxe and the spade.
---

---
No. It was from Blade Runner, 1982.

Anyone know that song?
---
Yeah they're wrong but you can't play twisted and regular simultaneously with the same account so maybe they heard that and misunderstood.
---
No. It means why the fuck does anybody care?
---
I did post a funny comment on your last post (same pic)  but you deleted it. 
---
Now you get this boring comment.
---
Source? If that's true the last tier being 2x is pretty shit.
---
Thank you to both of you a lot, I assumed you couldnt play the same account simultaneously. I might actually try it out now
---
nice
---
I'm an Iron. It's the most fun I've ever had. Try to enjoy it
---
It takes some investment but most people saying it takes the whole league are basing it off their points rate at low levels. Early tasks only give you 10. Hitting a 99 is 250 points, plus the points from 20,40,60,80 etc. Do that for a few of the afk skills and you'll stack up a lot of points.
---
metamorphosis is only for animals though. i don't think slayer helms are alive?
---
I'm not insulted by an ignorant child's objectively wrong posts. lol  
---
I couldn't care less if you continue wasting all your time on worse games.
---
Not sure about vanilla client I use RL
---
This
---
whats the best way to farm clues on twisted? no relic for clues.
---
Accurate description tbh,
---
Yup, main account here. That is an extremely kind and generous offer man, thank you very much for that. This community is wonderful.
---
While I wasn't too happy about it at first, I can kinda see the humor in it now (the other comments on this post literally made me laugh out loud haha). I'd feel bad if someone had to pay for my dumb mistake. Guess I'll go and spend an afternoon at Zeah rcing bloods and it'll be all good. :)
---
But I highly appreciate the offer and it did bring a smile to my face!! :D God bless you. &lt;3
---
Them lurers be getting smarter and smarter kappa.
---
#enduranceGang
---
I don't think you're making a valid point. People getting hacked all the time wouldn't change due to old names being released.
---
That’s basically 99 rune crafting though in twisted leagues isn’t it?
---
ok makes sense~
---
Okay. If you want cohesion with the poll results gave the banner at 2k, the horns at 6k and the poh item at 10k.
---
It’s way more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked.
---
But maybe you already know that..
---
It does not impact me really, so I don't really care.  The question relates more to morality then to a game like jagex.
---
Yes
---
You can't use pures in it since only has blood and soul alters I think.
---
P ess is useless on zeah. You can't acess conventional altars.
---
"B R O K E N"
---
Can't use pure ess anywhere on zeah...
---
That shit is ugly af
---
You're the cringiest player in the game
---
Depends if you want profit or Xp. Gold amulets are about 90k loss / hr atleast when i stopped playing it was. 
---
Profit wise you may be able to buy redwood shields, before i quit i put in a offer for 50k redwood shields for 1gp each and they do slowly sell. Have about 2k of them after a few months and they alch for 460 - 640ish i think?
---
Honestly, I wouldn't doubt Ful being under the karuulm dungeon-- Since their creation, the elder Kiln/TokHaar, aren't with the TzHaar in osrs as far as I know. (Or if there is the kiln in osrs, and it is close to the current TzHaar... TokHaar-Zuk is a possibility. monkaS)
---
Yeah I did them in the guild. When I ask Jane how many contracts I've completed she tells me 14.
---
If it was optional from the account screen without any kibd of time delay it would definitely oncentivize it.
---
You would have to add a time delay, and then it would basically be the name change system where you have 30 days(I think?)
---
From zulrah and zalcano i think yes,but skotizo its not very nessesry its a pretty rare drop.
---
I believe it will be recurring but also you’ve only missed a few days out of 2 months it’s definitely not too late.
---
Yeah! Are you still looking for a partner
---
I’m on mobile so the wiki doesn’t have the sorting thing I was talking about. But yeah metal dragons is a perfect example of something NOT to block as I was getting at in the post. Even though you really hate them (we all do), they all have a task weight of like 5, which is just not worth blocking. Instead, just skip them when they come up. 
---
I know it’s a bit confusing, I remember having the exact same questions as you and wishing someone would just tell me what the hell to block and skip. If i remember later tonight I’ll edit this with some real suggestions for blocks.
---
No one is playing osrs for a fucking nostlagia trip it's been out for over 6 years and is thriving while rs3 is dying.
---
It’s a curse being 1st all the time. My heart aches for the forsaken man.
---
This is for super low levels
---
None, it's all his now.
---
Creepy art style. I love it.
---
Can you get it from doing tears of guthix?
---
incontinentia buttocks
---
Probably the best way to get one early on would be from magpie implings (1/20 drop).
---
For a complete list of what things can drop it you can check the wiki page.
---
Senpai noticed me =o
---
You can get stams from jekyll random with torstol. Unsure how viable that really is tho
---
Ring of forging is the other option if superheat ore is too expensive / unavail. On my HCIM I used thieving HAM chests to get Ruby rings / rubies and went to GE to make forging rings really easy to help smithing and Fletch early on.
---
&gt; The odds of smelting exactly one bar out of 27 is
---
27 * (1/2)^27
---
yes
---
Ask in wdr discord.
---
Yep... guaranteed dragon weapons from the rate you’ll be getting masters. Basically guaranteed god d hides.. etc. 
---
The choice is basically better gear or better damage and maybe decent gear. 
---
Ngl the clues do sound nice, but I didn’t get endurance so doing them will be a bitch and a half. I think I’m going for damage personally. Hydra tasks will be POG.
---
From what I can see, your next best upgrades would be ancestrals and bandos. Although if you wanted something NOW, boot upgrades would probably be best.
---
Animal Collective?
---
I’m not use to rigour &amp; aug and Jagex said RL’s feature of moving the prayers around was bannable so I just put screen markers to help me get use to it.
---
6k points is a solid investment. You'd want to be playing relatively consistently during the league to get enough tasks to reach that. But with some dedication and afk grinds it's easily doable. I'm at nearly 1k points atm and only started yesterday.
---
You're a loser, and this is coming from someone that plays Fortnite competitively.
---
Imo osbuddy would be more likely to commit this act due to its lower popularity ATM. And I could have sworn I heard something about osbuddy hacking u when u cancel a subscription
---
And to where exactly would a high level pvmer go through shanty pass? Every pvm content in the desert has a better way to get there
---
They've cost me 3m at vorkath this weekend lmao. Like every 4th kill I'll get a lag spike dodging the fireball or woox walking, fkn annoying. Especially bad on w377 for some reason
---
CC represent!
---
Just got monkey tail lmao
---
&gt; mainly as a peasant weapon
---
they also rotated the blade 90 degrees so it was more like a polearm
---
hey oprah you got a spare whip?
---
His ass, it be multiply
---
Just throwing this out there but no, most players do not rtw. Most players are competent enough to make their own money in a reasonable time frame. There are many who do but saying most is a mistake
---
Buying bonds is RWT so yes I stay with  most.
---
nezzy helm is 55 def and xerician robes are 10 def
---
Some people like having above 500 total level my dude
---
Ah, thanks for doing the math. I was under the impression that a single item was rarer than third age. So it's definitely not longer than a lifetime (on average), but not something to grind for.
---
I know this is more of an opinion based question rather than fact, but is the exp from doing snape grass worth the cost over watermelons? Clearly it's vastly more expensive, but I'm wondering if the higher exp and potential to break-even is worth it. 63 farming and I've about 7m, sustaining through toadflax for the most part. Also, when should I start doing an herb like ranarr or snapdragon? I've heard in the 70s, but don't know what the reasoning for this is.
---
Nah cuz buying bonds doesn't hurt the games economy. It actually boosts it. Farming billions of gp per hour on hundreds of accounts lowers the value of every piece of gold which really hurts the economy. The reason bonds are going up is because of gold farmers
---
I have 65m xp in firemaking. Most of what I have comes from Wintertodt.
---
Okay sweet. Thank you. I’ll probably check it out to see if it seems doable for myself.
---
It’s a competitive game mode so go figure lmao
---
Don't think anyone has that power either. They would have to code it in just for u which won't happen
---
Some of y’all need a ring of forging and it really shows
---
:(
---
4 people is best money per hour (since there is a Max damage per cycle and 4 basically guarantees the minimum 3 cycles while maximizing your MVP chance and MVP's get double rolls on everything but pet)
---
1.2-2m gp/hr depending on if you get MVP drops
---
Seems like it could be as easy as turning off the appearance of dropped item for other completely. No reason what so ever to have so many items of the floor. It’s ugly, and makes everything harder in crowded spaces with any kind of dropping. Like woodcutting, mining, or fishing or any other power leveling. 
---
The chickens have been the most annoying to me. I was trying to pick up the chicken to get some food and cooking, as well as feathers and bones but everyone kept leaving theirs on the floor so it was just causing annoyance, and clutter.
---
Are you suggesting that a failed inferno attempt should cost one or more onyx gems?
---
Nah after months of silence on 2k worlds its nice to remind yourself of what proper RS public chat is by going to wintertodt or w2 ge for a bit
---
Idk but a gf only costs 10k so maybe grab one or seventeen of those while you shop around.
---
What's the original?
---
Nonononono. Only reason it's working right now is because zeah is extremely versitile in what it contains in terms of content. This does not work in other areas of the game. Karamja and morytania series exist on YouTube to be hard. A morytania version of twisted league would mean 4000 hours to do simple tasks unlike zeah. This is what I'm afraid of because as much as I like twisted leagues I don't think they can replicate this level of success again
---
Is it active?
---
\#accumulatorgang
---
They were never going to make the same mode in zeah again. That's the whole point of leagues, it varies each time. Personally I'd rather see it not just be the gimmick of area restricted. Especially because zeah is easily the most fleshed out spot for that sort of gameplay.
---
I'd rather see more inventive ideas than just that.
---
yeah, theres even bots that know how to pk back as well. I've almost died to a few of them. but they seem to stop switching prayers/gear after 2 mins exact and just suicide
---
Oh ok good I didn’t know if that was the plan but that’s good, they just need to do it right.
---
Yeah, but that requires a change that would pretty much have to be polled, and probably not get passed by ass hats who don’t play iron men lol. This seems like a QoL thing that could be changed for the next game mode, similar to this.
---
Yes. Like the good civilians of East Ardy. They'll look after the cat. I think.
---
Can we get rid of the "do you want another contract?" dialogue from farming contract lady and just go straight to choosing easy, medium or hard? It's redundant.
---
I’ve seen them too, it’s like the bots are in early production. Once they’re finished then GG PVP.
---
At this point it’s all just water under the fridge.
---
I've seen.
---
What was his loot tho????
---
You gotta use a wave guide. 
---
But yeah, I died like 30 times.. I just bought a bunch of supplies beforehand
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info!
---
Did a world crash or something?
---
Facts is that jagex will only add relevant content thru quests and pvm. PvP is their last resort to build publicity through twitch/YouTube/dmm
---
Cystal Hally for last hitting, all crystal tools for their respective activities.

W2 is laggy as hell right now. Every few minutes it just freezes and yeets like 90% of people out. It’s been doing it all day

They are buying beer from the barkeep and banking it I think
---
This should be added to the abyssal accumulator relic since that's thematically appropriate.
---
And who may you be?
---
tons of view botters to help support him
---
Vls isnt scim speed? You confused??? Abby dagger maxes 70 and is scim speed....
---
The only issue I have is the fact he is using a 3rd party client.  This isn't legit in my eyes at all
---
RS3 good, OSRS mad.
---
Dog u dont even pvp. You're the problem.
---
you can already spec like 47/47 or 48/48 with just a DDS, you're really saying you should be allowed to just come with prot item and combo 70/48/48 with 20k risk and that that would be good for pvp?
---
You can get free amazon prime, which gives you twitch prime.
---
There are also a shit TON of hacked twitch accounts. 
---
Between both of these, its very easy to amass a large amount of accounts with membership for free or like 1m per account. Probably a little less for the ones that buy in bulk.
---
not just slash, its all crit moves including razor leaf
---
my grandma is cute and chubby
---
abyssal dagger max hit 45 
---
assuming vls would be 5 speed, still not something that would ever come from killing lvl 3 man as you suggest, especially since it totally eclipses elder maul
---
Wow it's so good to see him doing good. He's so wholesome he deserves it.
---
I know this isn't really the issue here, but I just wanted to state that Jagex absolutely did not log into your account to change your display name. They have database tools for that. Jagex does *not* know your password.
---
The rewards are tradeable? Even the trophies? Any idea on potential prices?
---
Ssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhh
---
The game won't be out for 3-4 years.
---
But they're spec weapons that degrade, you wouldn't use them as primary weapons in any realm of the game nor would you use them as spec weapons in pve when you're running the same content hundreds of times... what "legendary tier" items would they be replacing exactly.
---
Bot farms are problematic for sure, but that is a separate issue entirely. There are plenty of bots that do pvm content who never get complained about. The best way for jagex to combat these is to introduce something like the old loot system where you build loot potential by risking over a certain amount while being in the wilderness
---
for a period of time.
---
lol i dont want private server level shit just being spawned in the thousands by bots in bh thanks. once something like this comes into the game everyone in wildie will use it.
---
he doesn't have have 20x, he doesnt have a tier 5 relic
---
a sea shanty 2 post. comedy genius.
---
Nice I love seeing skilling pures.
---
Quest first.  Always quest first.
---
PvM ppl just want a 97 slayer boss that drops BIS vs undead that helps to fight mummies in raids 3 (desert edition)  meanwhile ags is meta for 10 years running.
---
a man on culture i see
---
Crap, I just got 99 Farming by mistake. I meant to get 99 Mining first. Is there still a way to get an untrimmed mining cape?
---
Also isn't an untrimmed mining cape rarer than an untrimmed farming cape?
---
Ha
---
take my downvote and run with it!
---
Nice.
---
This needs to be repeated ad nauseam until the PVP community gets it. Runescape was one of the few options back in the early to mid 2000s but it's a shitshow. Of course it takes skill but it's so heavily RNG based and the only thing to combat the heavy RNG is an inventory of food.
---
I moved on to Guild Wars which had much better team PVP and then League of Legends when Guild Wars started to die off. Now we have so many options I just don't see the point in playing Runescape for the PVP. So did 99% of PKers when they left as soon as the wilderness was taken out in 2007. 98% did not return.
---
The PVP community should get minor updates that do not impact the rest of the community. Giving them more and more OP gear isn't going to suddenly attract people to PKing or bring back PKers who left for better games with less RNG and more skill. It's just going to create more and more animosity and resentment.
---
Also buying a twisted bow for one KKK just sends the wrong message.
---
like legit **you** havent thought this through. multi is bad enough as it is before 100 people are hitting 70, but then ballista already exists. and that's another argument against you.
---
ballista has a max hit of 60 and speed of 7
---
elder maul max hit of 65, speed of 6
---
VLS max hit of 70, speed of 5
---
yeah no. 
---
if it was added, it would have max hit of 55-60, speed of 5 for very clear reasons looking at the above weapons
---
also if it came from BH it would devalue other weapons to hell because BH is a botfarm place lvl 3 can farm
---
I like that sexy half prayer drain rate because flicking prayers is for tryhards.
---
&gt;OSHD requires thousands of hours of manpower that can't be resourced without spending a shitload of money and time to get new artists and approve every single asset.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The entirety of Zeah alone would take a phenomenal amount of time, then you've got the 3 grandmaster quests and their new areas, the dozen other quests, every single new item added since 2007, the list just goes on.
---
OSHD was a community project you burger.

A bug(glitch) is where something was coded one way, but it happens another way. For instance if I coded 60 xp per action and you got 120, then that's a glitch. An exploit, on the other hand, is an unintended result of intended game mechanics. If I coded 60 xp per action, but somehow you could abuse an intended mechanic to improve the xp rate, for instance doing more actions per hour and the keyword being intended, then that is an exploit. In this case, you are not getting more xp per actions, but rather you are getting more actions per hour.
---
The difference is how the "problem" came about. In one case, the code written by Jagex fucked up. In the second case, the code is working as it was written and intended - but Jagex overlooked the implication of the way they wrote their code.
---
They later decided it was okay, making it no longer an exploit. "It's not a bug, it's a feature." is a common saying.
---
To also reply to your earlier point
---
\&gt; There are a lot of things that are objectively against their rules that the current Jagex moderators don't take action on. 
---
If they say the rules doesn't apply to a situation, then it is allowed rather than simply ignored/not taken action against. They have looked at the situation, and said this is okay.
---
You know what? The funny thing is I kinda agree with you. I don't really like that tick manipulation is in the game. If you want a higher effort method for higher xp rates, I would rather a new method be put in the game than just ticking an existing method.  It would be more elegant, and it wouldn't be as obtuse for new players.  But alas, they have deemed it okay, and so it is objectively not against the rules.
---
To some, Woox.
---
Minnows and Aerial would be dead even if you didn't tick. They aren't as efficient as afk barb.
---
The difference in the "huge disparity" is that if I don't have a T Bow, I get slower kills but the boss isn't stronger. If my opponent has a VLS and I don't, that is not just lower DPS for me but a huge disadvantage that imbalances the fight. But yah, a faster, 1H godsword with 4 armor piercing specs is a tad stronger than what we have... But I do agree that new PvP weapons should be offered; I'd just rather see original ones like how the TBow and Scythe were original weapons.
---
I should have elaborated. I have barrows gloves already, I’m just curious as to if it’s even really be viable with my stats and gear atm.
---
Yup that's a new pfp
---
suggestion: tier 70 weapon from the pvp fight caves minigame which is generally unused. for competing against multiple players you gain tokens to buy one of these. 
---
it has two attack animations rather than one. it's a 5 speed weapon, but it attacks twice every other time it initiates an attack, with the second animation.
---
can be used to cut dense jungle
---
logically would work with obby neck
---
No just pvp clans are bad. Pvp is excellent.
---
That's actually one of the main reasons I chose accumulator was for saving runes for highalchs

Where's the background from?

if you don't ejoy the task then skip it
---
being able to reobtain silverlight after you earn darklight would be nice
---
Because there is a massive difference between an unofficial client being able to provide something and the company itself being able to provide it. If Jagex released it it would have to be up to consumer standards with little to no bugs, it would need to be bot safe (something that OSHD and other similar clients have failed to accomplish) and it would mean future updates would be much rarer.
---
So in reality they would be spending a massive, massive amount of money for something they might not even accomplish without hiring new permanent staff and the amount of people it would bring back is most likely miniscule.
---
You say it like jagex isn't also owned by a chinese company. lol
---
Just stand next to the maze and its not a problem
---
That’s my point, that dude can’t just use rng and clicking tiles as reasons why pking is boring when the entire game is rng and clicking tiles

Tbh afkables sounds nice as im playing similarly. In the end its up to u boo
---
We better hide this therefore you shall be downvoted
---
Why would you want an alt for an Ironman only competition?
---
Bit late of a response, but noting major. One thing would be the task interface being rough to navigate do to the length of scrolling. Maybe something that is more categorized by tabs for level/xp up milestones, clue scrolls, bossing/raid, collecting etc..
---
Glory has the same offensive accuracy as a fury. All a fury provides over a glory is +2 str(which isn’t a guaranteed max hit) and +5 prayer (which is actually nice IF you’re using prayers). 
---
The defense bonuses are menial considering prayer negates, in most circumstances, all damage from NPC’s and if you’re utilizing the +5 prayer, the defense is doing nothing for you. If you’re not using prayer and using the defense stats instead, then the +5 prayer is doing nothing for you. 
---
Thus making the fury a low-mid tier item. The only reason it has any relative value is because it’s made from an onyx.
---
EDIT: The only reason I made a fury on my ironman is because I went nearly 2.4k kc dry for my first Zenyte. Had I gotten these on the appropriate drop rate, I would’ve never bothered making such a largely useless item.
---
Do you have the smithing gauntlets?
---
I see some other people get suggestion but if your irl schedule allowes you could log in after the Thursday update and all stores stock resets

I also like the old graphics and I've never liked animation smoothing

As far as I know you cant reset it during TL.

Guess we’re goin the fuck home then
---
Nope, it's the bots selling chaos runes. Check the tzhaar rune store on every single world, like 100k+ chaos runes sold to the store. That's at least 3 onyxes from each world. (This is only the outside one, inferno area one is probably similar)

Doesn't matter how many people are doing zalcano, it's less than a drop in the bucket compared to the bots.

Dont forget he also won a deadman mode haha
---
Yeah I didn’t think about that, good point
---
Wtf OP it was my turn to repost this
---
&gt; Not healing pyros is better for points.
---
Like how? Is this based on that you only heal the pyro once he's down? Cause that's not what I do, I heal him whenever I get the chance and it takes me max a second per dose. Other than a few inv spots taken, it's literally no time wasted at all. I consistently get 800-1100 points because of this if I prioritize the loot over the xp.
---
Say in a normal game where the brazier breaks once and the pyro gets hit by snow once. That's 120 free points for me (each hit is 2-3 doses), or even 150 if one of them hits an 11+ which may happen at late stages. How can you get 150+ points in those 4-5 sec I spend healing the pyro? The process of chopping, fletching and burning takes minimum 2-3 sec for 35 points in total. Besides, if no did it anyway, then we all would have been stuck running around looking for a lit brazer at the end.
---
Mate search up woox in regards to osrs and you can find him pulling off incredibly great feats without the use of the client. Please shut the fuck up when you’re just misinformed, you look like a total cunt.
---
I'm curious, if you die with a pet during the league can you get it back?
---
No. The community wanted the earliest version available. 07 was just the earliest. Most people at the time wanted 2006. Jagex had backups for later time periods.
---
Your death is my victory
---
Yeah I had never been there. It came out jan 2017 or something right?
---
How do you get jewelry moulds?
---
Dude looks much healthier than he did before. Glad to see he's doing better.
---
Yeah. Its a shame it wasnt someone else who wasnt trying to make money off it. Using jagexs own code is perfectly legal if jagex gives u permission. Maybe theyll give it to runelite.
---
Get some Tarro seeds?
---
You can save runes in highalchs?
---
Holy shit that’s a throwback - I remember the day Pokémon go dropped, what a fun night! Just a ton of people running around my college campus playing Pokémon Go for the next week!
---
Do they carry over to normal
---
Why yes, that is one of the definitions of e thug.
---
He is indeed the same.
---
I play on one account and absolutely hate myself for not choosing endless endurance.
---
No but they do carry to every future league which is a nice touch. Auto insured too
---
It’s not even accurate though
---
Why do we need to remove them from any drop tables
---
What other items in the game does jagex nerf the supply of when the price drops
---
agreed
---
Wouldn't abby demons be faster elites?
---
Hell no
---
Runelite is free to use and approved by Jagex. If you choose not to use it then that's on you and no one else.
---
Nice
---
Epstein didn't alch himself
---
Doubt it, entire game would revolt of they put in my without a poll.
---
Only way they get mtx in this game is if they offer a mod Ashe player model or something just ridiculous.
---
But gp is used to insta remove trees anyway.
---
I tried playing it and didn't find it enjoyable. It's a foreign game to me, almost unrecognizable.
---
But rs3 is their money grab and thats ehy they try to make th as addictive as possible for people to use alot of money. If rs3 vanishes where do they get that money?
---
Didn't ask furry loser
---
Gotta go fast
---
I came back a couple weeks ago and didn't even know zeah existed until the league started.
---
Yep it's another "this item only has a useless cosmetic benefit so we wanna tie it to pets to give it value".
---
Make it 50 firefighters and they're consumed in the process. So every time you decide you want to change the colour you need firefighters again, but not some absurd amount.
---
Alternatively make a higher amount, like 500 or 1000 be used to unlock the colour choice permanently.
---
U mean apart from infinite run energy?

There are also low level frogs on the route to CoX that have natures as a common drop.

I just made a new members account for a different purpose but I checked it out and there are around 97k accounts in the league

I've already got an SO and I'm a girl, sorry hun. Best of luck though:P

I feel like in the long run this won’t matter. Sure it saves some times farming nature runes now but the time save from infinite run is likely much higher, depending on the content you’re doing anyway.
---
It's okay just convert to the church of gay
---
You left your hammer unsensored, ty for the iron bar kid.
---
No because the reward is an easier version of 2.2k total worlds.
---
I had no idea aerial and drift net fishing were such good xp, I might give them a go.  I just think the amount of time required for almost all skills to get 99 can be daunting and maybe "scares off" new players.  I agree a lot of people like that aspect of OSRS and how it really is an accomplishment to get a high total level and almost any 99's.   
---
My whole thing wasnt necessarily just about fishing, but just using it as an example.  Thanks for the fishing tips though, might have to give them a go and see how it is.

Piece of art

I'm pretty gay af already hun xP

I'm starting yo see a surprising ammoun of gold selling bots in twisted servers around the Kourend Castle,  fwiw..

Gambit you have stated that if prayer reorder fails the poll, it will be against the rules, therefore forbidden on 3pc's. can you just let people know this on stream, so no one will vote no just to get 'advantage' over others?

Can you please add an NPC in the Lunar Isle bank who, after completing the Fremennik Elite Diary, will teleport you to the mainland in the same spot as getting kicked off the island? Currently, completing Fremmy elite is a nerf to Vorkath because you either have to use a teleport further away, or use an inventory slot on the Sea Boots.

Just like your personality :)

I'm pretty sure future leagues won't necessarily be region-locked - there could be any number of twists on the main game, e.g. buffed monsters, limited deaths, unique tasks/goals; or something like Framed Gridlocked series, where you progress through different areas that you unlock doing certain tasks. I'm guessing that they will do a Morytania league after the expansion.
---
What rewards are being sold? The only thing im personally playing for is getting those sweet horns for slayer helm
---
Calling it a method is giving him way more credit than he deserves haha. Like calling scammers hackers
---
You have understood the rewards. The only reward involving worlds is being able to play in exclusive worlds for the next league.
---
What bars are you making? Something like gold would be more magic xp/he than steel for example as less banking involved.
---
Caveman
---
And the correct way to handle it is
---
    try{

        //TODO: fix
---
    }
---

---
Nice rng
---
I personally am split 50/50. I like some parts more in classic and others in hd
---
Agreed but won’t they be expensive?
---
Caveman pretty good. But there's only so much to do
---
Have you seen the comments on anything OSRS posts Twitter lately? That's exactly what the PVP community is doing. In fact they were openly spite voting no on PVM content and tweeting about it. All because they somehow bought into a narrative that PVMers were spite voting no to PVP content (but there weren't a bunch of PVMers tweeting about how they did that).
---
This may be premature but what can we expect for future Leagues? Will it most likely follow the same formula of X-locked Ironman with 5x rates and the same relics, or will Leagues possibly have themes that vary in mechanics and relics?
---
Mine locked it out about an hour in to my first session on that account outside the US. As long as you have access to your email/authenticator, you can unlock it while on the plane.
---
any chance of twisted league being extended by about a month or so? the fact that its only 2 months makes it feel like you have to grind non stop
---
i was not confident in twisted league but my friend and i wanted to try it out.
---
it really is fun. i wasn't expecting it. it's a different adventure with different goals, but it's still runescape.
---
plus, in the base game, the only thing i ever use zeah for is konar, farming guild and hosidius patches.
---
Dragon Full helmet.
---
Lol stoners but in cbd sub post ? Surely unin the wrong one

You get gnome village party by default, so cheer up
---
Twisted League Questions
---
Can an alternate method of obtaining lockpicks on Zeah be added (hours of hopping for young implings on 14 worlds with thousands of other people). 
---
Chocolate bars for energy potions are ridiculously competitive. It currently takes over 20 minutes to get an inventory of chocolate dust with aggressive world hopping and timing. 
---
Plows. 
---
5k points are locked behind solo raids time at intervals decreasing by two minutes. Achieving even the slowest solo time won’t be possible without all DPS relics and endless endurance. Can these timed goals be re-evaluated to make them possible for other play styles to achieve? 
---
As a final note: it would be really cool if halfway through the league, we could change 1 relic we already selected. A lot of people suffer lack of motivation after picking a relic they later regret choosing. 
---
Twisted leagues are loads of fun! Glad everything has been going smoothly
---

---
he meant osrs, when osrs first started beating rs3 in popularity there was always some rs3 player in denial going "it's all bots"
---

Shoulda joined endurance gang
---
BH world need a warning that you don't have a emblem in your inventory when you step in wilderness. Have lost like 40 points already.. Imagine losing 100 bonus point because of that.

Some guy hit my npc's like 4x, so I just tagged his every time for like 5 minutes just to see him have a mental breakdown

Cbd does not make you intoxicated in any way.

hey, mom said it was my turn to repost this
---
What's this website you're showing?
---
Can you add some sort of a time/skill restriction to LMS to combat the bots?
---
You choose to limit yourself.
---
Remember that from private servers
---
They've moved Probitia to Zeah on Twisted League worlds.
---
When they added the question why do you vote no on the pvp polls literally 20% said spite voting
---
And they’re just the ones they admit it which I’m guessing most don’t
---
Regarding the relics in Twisted League and programming/testing them: how much of a job was it? Were there any underlying reworks that had to be done, to make it work properly? If so, what kind of stuff is now possible that wasn't before? Anything you're excited to bring to the main game?
---
Zeah is just one of the millions of possibilites. It doesn't need to be so area-locked focused. They could open up the entire game, but trough relics make your account very specialised. 
---
How about global rules that all the xp is X500, but once you reach 200m in a skill, that skill is disabled, so you need to play cautiously as not to not get 200m before you utilised that skill for everything you need.
---
How about rotating area-locks? First week, asgarnia is open, second week, kandarin, then desert, then morytania. New areas open, old areas close. 
---
How about "Guthix's edicts" style gameplay where all your skills must be of equal value and cannot be trained if the gap is more than 1 level wider.
---
Pair this up with specific tasks to complete with that league, it can be a new fresh experience every time.
---
What relic did you pick?
---
x20 XP ensouled heads
---
Congrats
---
Fools&gt;
---
Demonstrates their ability and happiness to do so.
---
Worlds can be targeted without any fancy trickery from the inside, and the only mitigation Jagex has shown to use is to increase the ping for everyone and reroute worlds.
---
The old man was too fucking creepy looking.

What was your method for the end of contact and that fight? Stats?

It would be pointless to allow other capes that do nothing but offer +9 and prayer if trimmed.

Wait they voted to undo updates?

Do you even enjoy the game anymore? I see you post the exact same complaining comments on every question submission each week. All you do is whine. Maybe it’s time you find a new game if this one isn’t to your liking anymore, yeah?

There's no tanks in Hong Kong

Could you give a small breakdown based on top 1000-2000 players by league points/total levels?
---
Thanks
---
Used to see these frequently when my brother used unofficial copies of the game. For sure bizarre it’s in the real server!
---
Pretty sure this is a repost
---
We're only 5 days in and already people already have 200m's and 1500+ total level. There is plenty of time left!
---
Don't care about your fetish, keep it off of this subreddit.
---
yeah or something like hosidius house locked ironman
---
I regret harvestor too.
---
But still gonna play.
---
Glory is upper low tier. Like they are 12k...
---
(Again IM is different, but then prices don't mean anything then)
---
Zenytes are dropped by 1 thing, locked by master quest and a HL bossish monster. Gury is usually one of the first upgrades new p2p players get nowadays, because it's lower price makes it the perfect mid tier item.
---
Ignore the stat requirements to make/enchant and how its obtained.
---
Because *you can buy it*
---
Which makes it lower mid to mid tier.
---
You use the fury until you have a Torture, Occult, and Anguish.
---
It's be a cool if they had a perk that took all 'fun' weapons and turned them into OP melee blowpipes or something.
---
By fun I mean negative attack stat weapons, so like flowers, cat toy, stale baguette, ECT.
---
I know, I miss the seed of crwys so much :(
---
I don't even play anymore and I'd buy the shit out of this
---
It's not complaining, it's exactly what this thread is for?
---
Make every account require Authenticator? What would be the implications of that, would it help, I don’t know, enlighten me.
---
Why does the banking relic not work on the essence mine but the harvester does?
---
Ironman is different to a regular account, and being unable go trade does make the game harder, undoubtedly, but grinding for thousands of hours to get a bunch of sand is not the kind of challenge that is enjoyable or attractive to many players. Since ironmen are not able to trade or use nightmare zone for commonly botted materials like sand, it makes sense to add alternative means for acquiring those resources.
---
Think of it more as ironman gameplay revealing a design flaw that needed addressing, not catering specifically to ironmen.
---
Also, one could argue the reverse of your point. Adding methods which reduce the tediousness of training certain skills is more likely to attract players to starting an ironman. If one really cared about the prestige of earning a high crafting level through an old method then the old methods are still available, after all.
---
Just think about what is better or choose same as streamers! And you will be fine.
---
I could be wrong, as I have been before, but I don't think I asked?
---
Exactly this. Assuming 50/50 stakes, to counteract the 1% house edge, all he has to do is turn 1 stake that was going to lose into a stake that gets refunded for every 100 stakes he does. Then he’ll break even long term.
---
Presumably, he’s doing this quite often, especially on bigger stakes, which will cause a humongous advantage in his favor.
---
It's the best, but it's a novelty item. I'm sure most players would rather have the 110m+ that it's worth. You can still get dragon platelegs on Zeah.
---
Depends on how you want to play. If you want to be combat focused, I see no reason as to why you'd not take both combat-related Relics. Remember that in this game mode, your access to stat-boosting gear is very restricted, so your accuracy and damage will be reduced anyway due to no Berserker ring, barrows gloves etc.  
---
If you can see yourself focusing more on the skilling side of it, then Hardcore Harvester seems decent. Depends what you see yourself doing. Pick what you'll find the most fun.
---
could just copy the ROTS model. that was fun pvm.
---
especially while alching, fucks my brain up
---
Barrows gloves unlocked
---
I know this is a bit of a jump but if i wanted kids so i coukd have sex with them...
---
I was 450 kills dry first, nothing. then i got 3 primordials in 300 kills so just go on, one primordial is enough to make your motivation go through the roof
---
This makes me feel like people are looking at the game mode the wrong way. I feel like it shouldn't just be another "money maker" to people. It's meant to be enjoyed with the added benefit of getting rewards from it. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the game mode :)
---
Well yeah, but on twisted league everyone's a BTW so its a bis AND a flex item. Virgin dragon platelegs vs chad 3rd age skirt
---
Maybe in twisted ?
---
A flex item that leaves you with nothing but a screenshot two months from now.
---
BS... he went hard on the gauntlet update lmao
---
Free reddit karma
---
It's not an improvement to everyone and clearly jagex doesn't find it worth the resources. There is a reason really some old games hold up visually (like well done pixel art) while semi old ones don't (ps1/2 era stuff). sSyle never goes bad, but attempting to look realistic and being very outdated will always look bad.
---
You got me there.
---
Having kids has to be unanimous, with that being said you should tell her how you feel about the kid situation now so she can make her decision to stay with you or not.
---
If the safespots are removed, the bosses would become too hard.
---
The current safespots allow the bosses to be balanced with the risks of deep multicombat Wilderness.
---
They need a full rework of mechanics and not just the removal of safespots.
---
The game is slowly being ruined by bots but nobody gives a fuck because at least we have leagues.
---
Found the guy that doesn’t listen while fletching away from the wall and brazier making snow fall in everybody
---
this is great, the increased xp rates makes this much more managable
---
We have self driving cars and you think people aren't capable of writing code to solve simple puzzles?
---
They are fighting with their own hands and with the few resources available. I get what you mean, but not everyone has the pluck to do that. Hence: awesomeness
---
that and they had people solving the captchas for other people live, that was funny
---
Hrm, I wouldn't know, I haven't played it yet. I'd think there are better obtainable boots?
---
I can’t decide bet that or konar blessing for my next one.  I feel like the boosted combat damage would be so great, but getting clues quickly and easily is also great.  Real tough choice.
---
Theyve stated that they don't wish to repeat the mistakes of birdhouses again.
---
make it so members is $10 if you have your phone number linked to your account and $11 if it's not, big brain move
---
Takes 5 minutes to build the client yourself, can take the old prayer reorder plugin they used to have lol
---
Oh Step-Bwana, help I'm stuck! UwU
---
delet this
---
Rune boots at 80 slayer, or spiked manacles from medium clues are the best melee boots you can get I think
---
forever ghosted
---
HCIM TBing with an Ancient Staff. All over the place.
---
Your moms model is the first one in my cache
---
If I make an alt then the horns I won't be able to get on my main will I?
---
Feel pretty good that I only started yesterday and already just shy of the 50% mark. Of course it'll be much harder to break into the lower percentages though.
---
That Dark wizard robe though
---
No I am not complaining about rng, but if you read closely I said that I am complaining about the task itself.
---
I agree, most fun I had in years!
---
Imagine 20 of these dudes coming to raid your town
---
The thought of being able to let clues stack up until I feel like starting them is a nice touch.
---
The endurance relic is extremely good compared to the other tier one relics. Woox said that he thinks endurance is necessary for the game mode to be fun, and it may make sense to retroactively give that perk to everyone.
---
Thoughts on allowing reselection of the first relic tier for twisted league, or potentially modifying the first tier such that everyone gets endurance by default and something else replaces it?

Didn’t they do it without even polling either? They just kind of.... introduced it? It’s been years, can’t remember. Able to refresh my memory?
---
Is there any updates on us getting a few Asian worlds? It is tough to play on German world's currently and Aus worlds are bad as is. Thank you
---
ok
---
I would rather all slayer masters just give a task to kill "giants" instead of a specific type.
---
We get it, you stake.
---
Oh I thought you said direct xp
---
Hi, and welcome to my guide
---
Might just be an effect of reading Reddit too much, but it feels to me like they've quietly increased drop rates for the league, had 3 people in our clan get skilling pets within 2 days.
---
Could be luck but I have no idea.
---
People just like to hate on shit that has nothing to do with them.
---
TIL reddit is one person
---
I'm pretty sure they have to get 10 points first which is like 8 minutes of thieving.
---
Your RNG is based on how well you’re packing
---
Hell I even home tped yesterday and noticed that Kourend Castle has a lot of similarities with Lumb Castle. It's to the West, with North and South stairs, 3 floors, bank on top floor, etc
---
Are the rates for gaining favour in Kourend multiplied the same as the xp in Twisted League? I remember it taking forever to get 100% in each city on my main and don’t fancy doing it again just for the TL. I do see a lot of people doing it though - is it really worth it?
---
Can you make it so when we use an untrimmed skill cape on perdu to show him our 1st 99 and have him sell it back to us untrimmed? This would make it fair and get rid of the convoluted glitch to keep capes untrimmed
---
As they say in wintertodt nowadays,
---
Didn't ask.
---
This post has just convinced me to not play TL and just buy the rewards
---
That has no effect on training agility in the twisted league.
---
dude it's 10AM, why you gotta make me think about death and stuff
---
It's a big time investment. Only 3 people got it so far and the leagues been out 4 days. So assume it'll take 100-200 hours.
---
Wtf is this pseudo-intellectual bullshit?
---
I have been doing some reading and people are saying the horns will be tradeable on the main game. So I will probably just buy some from someone then.
---
Doing total level and mid tier task is the easiest way to get into top 10%. I went full skater and barely broke 50% playing all weekend.
---
Dope looks sick
---
Grandmaster quest is a pretty big req imo
---
Thanks bro 🙏
---
Imagine being this condescending when you're not even top 10.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Free Hong Kong
---
The horns are tradable
---
Thats so awesome i want one too
---
Its all fun and games to meme about it but lets not forget those are real people fighting for their rights and dignity
---
Why do I need 43 prayer, out of curiosity?
---
Yeah I know his past achievements, but Id get rusty if I only played twice a year. He is just on another level.
---
Didn't ask
---
and abra can’t teleport out now 😿
---
Hell yeah, eat the rich
---
What outfit is that? It looks cool. My ranged is 41 so probably way ahead of me
---
Yeah 1m a day from level 3 is believable. 1m a day while you're at sand crabs all day is believable. Get more mad lol. You could have lied in any sort of way. Said you got a tbow drop or something. But based of what you said its pretty obvious you used moms cc. Stop trying to act legit. Its sad.
---
Kinda like peeing in the shower, everybody does it. There's those that bot and those that lies about it.
---
I heard the red light culture is ... different.
---
I absolutely love this, what a fantastic design!!
---
Nicely done.
---
Slayer Staff is actually a really good melee weapon for low atk, but it requires 55 Slayer (so if you trained Slayer with Mage/Range, you're good to go!). It's not better than a rune scim, but until you get that, it might be BIS
---
*cries in btw*
---
I did my first cereberus task 180 kc total. I was sweating hard when im around 170 kc in thinking but ma boi dropped me an eternal around 175 kc. I made like 1mil profit.
---
Make sure you get bracelets of slaughter for the good tasks and expeditious bracelets for the not so good ones. Helps boost your XP per task and saves time on the ones you don't like.

Will we ever get the ability to “Turn off” the elite fremmy diary reward which takes away the requirement for a seal of passage? I would really like to finish off those diaries, but don’t want to be punished for farming vorkath
---
Cant school doesnt give me time for a job
---
And here I thought the avg player isn't 10 anymore and $11 a month isn't an arm and a leg
---
Okay this dude is right. Shield and how are good. The plate body and legs I've heard aren't worth it though from everyone I know that's tried it.
---
Just out of spite as I’m going through my old posts.
---
110 days later. That account is still untouched sitting in f2p.
---
I now play on my pure after doing a name swap.
---
Ahhhh okay this explains so much now. Was wondering why I was going so dry.
---
god id buy this in a heartbeat
---
Doesn't count
---
Can you implement a restriction of 100 hours in-game time and 500 total level to deter bots from suicide-botting Last Man Standing with Twitch Prime free membership?
---
And also can you stop trouver parchments from being used when dying with an imbued untradeable in under 20 wilderness or in PvP worlds?
---
You sound jealous bro
---
Hmm
---
It's simply the first one on the list, and it doesn't have anything further down to grab and use.
---
I picked Arcane Courier, the only one I haven't seen any streamers get, and I have no regrets. With a full time job and a kid, being able to skill on mobile without moving is amazing. Point is, only you know your play style, how much you can play, etc. I will say that Unnatural Selection would certainly not be a waste just because you don't pick the next combat relic. If only getting the task you want sounds nice to you, then I'm sure you would enjoy it, even if you're only killing the things at normal speed. At least you'd be killing what you want to kill.
---
Fair point but as i said i dont want money to go to waste
---
Go for it
---
Not bad dude. That's 1 iron bar you didn't have before.
---
God you're evil. I love it.
---
Most bold to state such.
---
Aw lol that's cute he cant do math.
---
it was a glorified fetch quest tbh except instead of items you had to get elven lords
---
But you can grind f2p for hours on end?
---
Unless if gives you a max hit over glory with the +2 Str bonus it has over it (in many cases, it would not) then it does nothing more for you offensively than a glory. 
---
Both the glory and fury provide +10 to all offensive accuracy traits
---
Fuck yourself
---
Most sensible conclusion on the server issue is that people have been ddosing W302 duel arena to win stakes. There's been a post made about it. Ddoser seems to have also been harrasing Woox on his CoX run and Odablock staking last night(hitting off the random worlds he hopped to at arena).
---
Fun fact. Jagex made actual models for entire monsters in the skill guide. You used to be able to "examine" an Abyssal Demon, for example. There was an entire item/dummy for every creature that was in a skill guide, and you could spawn it on a private server if you knew the ID.
---
This is the dwarf head as seen on one or more of the skill guides. I don't think they use examinable items in them anymore. They just don't delete old models from their cache, which is why we still have 2005 GUI data that Runelite uses for its interface plugin. They didn't add it - it was never removed in the first place.
---
I don't play twisted so I disagree :)
---
u can have it 2 times in a row slayer doesnt have a limit... i did 3 sand crabs in a row before i hit 50 cb and its impossible to be assigned them now
---
Not for hours only like 2-3 hours
---
Looking at the picture of the trophies, it looks like the RuneScape logo has the color scheme for the twisted league. Probably future leagues will have the same trophies with a slightly different color scheme. This is just my guess though.
---
Aren't dark/dense essence blocks un-bankable?
---
I legit just did this last week as well, Used felt for the light beams, rolled up felt for the crystals that changed the light color and 5 yen coins for the mirrors. Even made them a Color Wheel.   
---
I purposefully made it way easier than it was in game cause even I wasn't going to sit there and wait 8 hours to do it... Instead it took them only 3 hours.

I know but this has to stop. Otherwise the game isnt worth my money. Before this fall all DDoS's were during DMM finals, but now its everyday. I cant personally play a game that lags more than ubisoft's potatoes. I can understand if its big DDoS. I cant literally play the game without DC'ing or lagging sometimes more, sometimes less. Worst time to play is during evening at jagex's time.
---
I was going to comment on the jersey, it seems like there is at least one intelligent individual in this group. Go Sox, go Bs, go Cs, go Pats!!
---
Yeah, I was just curious to know if the trophies in this league would be the first "discontinued" items in the game since OSRS was a thing. And it seems like it is. Thanks!
---
Wait til you hit em with the SOTE puzzle
---
Either the options mentioned or getting the rings from birdnests
---
Even with a PvM mindset artisan provides so much that you will need! I wanted to choose combat as well but when you consider all the potions, arrows, and other materials you will need for higher end PvM you are going to wish you didn’t have to grind them out so much with lower exp rates. Also construction is the only skill cape.
---
UwU, we're halfway there! OwO *Notices your buldge there!*
---
*unzips pants*
---
Fun?  The higher xp rates are interesting but i'm 97 fletching 99 wc 90 fm all in 3 days.  It 100% isn't making the game more interesting it's just cutting down the grind that makes runescape.  Without the grind osrs runs out of content in literal days and leveling isn't an achievement anymore.
---
Absolutely agree. Forcing them to risk more on the other hand.. Has already been done with void.. Was probably what they were trying to do with emblems lol.. They fucked up hard. Disable and try again.
---
lmao i asked an academic question out of curiousity and I got downvoted. This subreddit is truly full of enlightened intellectuals.
---
Bots introduce raw gold into the game causing inflation over time. Bots have destroyed skilling, sure battle staves may be cheaper to make but you also lose making more profit from fishing/wood cutting because all the logs are worthless. Bots literally sell maple logs to the general store because they cost 6-7 ea on GE and the general store buys them for 8gp (no matter how many thousand are sold to the shop).
---
Toxic blowpipe-&gt; Sandwich lady bottoms

My players will always try to cheese everything too. I had to make a lot of rules for the pocket dimension the puzzle is in to make the puzzle a viable hurdle. Sounds like you have DM'd for a bit and know what you are doing for sure!

yeah i wish it had a search feature

The fremmy boots are a faster teleport to Vorkath anyway I though?
---
I agree with everything up until you said add to hydras table.

Just get rid of it from drop tables. There is such an influx it’s dumb

Castle Wars has a quiver cosmetic in the reward shop, but it’s a bit of a joke design.

His name is long gone if it was last used ~2014, as the name wipe in 2017 cleared all over 2year idle accounts names.
---
Half the points needed to skip tasks with skillcape 30 to 15
---
Let players with 99 slayer get a task from any slayer master please without the CB requirement. 
---
It is quite fitting too since 99 herblore bypasses the requirement for making unfinished potions and 99 crafting bypasses falador hard diary req.
---
Dragon hide chaps have a quiver. Don't they?
---

---
nope

I enjoy watching people bc I can't play at the moment. Good fucking job jagex

When you finish the hard Kandarin diaries, you can toggle the Camelot teleport to put you right outside the Seers bank. People tele right after finishing a lap on the Seers rooftop course because it's a lot faster than having to run back. I'm guessing this guy was probably alching while training agility and accidently clicked teleport right before the last jump, which is where most of the XP from that course comes from.
---
That green box is the last step of the Seers agility course. He wanted to teleport to Seers bank after finishing (to make laps faster) but instead teleported before finishing and missed getting the big xp drop.
---
The thing is - surely if Jagex actually cared about bots, a lead like this could go some way? 
---
Likely that’s the guy’s main - if he’s used historic credit card info etc on his main for membership (before he ever began his bot farm) they could locate that and just take legal action against him in real life using that. 
---
Could simply have a court order banning him from playing on any account etc (basically like a restraining order from RS), then if he’s found to break this again he can be fined, imprisoned etc...
---
Obviously it’s not that straightforward, but I wonder how many of these kids (he may not be a kid, but if he’s a full grown adult and that’s his demeanour then he deserves to be treated as a kid) would continue to use their bot farms if they know Jagex is waiting for them to slip up..
---
12 but very good for mediums but for slayer i use it for ankous but still get my charges back
---
Yep. Those who are experienced at solo Cox can tell you this wasn’t super exciting. Once you can keep up with 1:0 melee and 4:0 mage it isn’t too hard to just grind out Olm’s hp without taking any damage. Only reason this worked is because he had unlimited stamina with the endurance relic and you can run Olm’s head forever taking 0 damage if you know what you’re doing. The speed he was able to get the items and setup necessary to take on and complete a full raid is the impressive part.
---
Right.  I'm talking about this specific "1st person to finish the solo".  He couldn't do it without the client.  That's pretty lame.  Does he need cheats to play starcraft as well lmao.  If it's not the original client, it's basically like using cheat codes.  It provides the player with features that are not a part of the actual game.  Sorry that you can't understand that.  Go download redditbuddy, it will provide you with additional explinations to peoples comments to help you understand them.
---
The problem is the skull (who attacked who) information is stored server-side, and this feature would be client-side.
---
They could probably get it to work by sending this information to the client however it would run the risk of you skulling anyway when the data from sever Vs your client disagrees (e.g. server lag or something).
---
lms is ready
---
If it was gonna be a dick it has to have more veins on it!
---
&gt;Plus the running animation was goof
---
This! I don't understand how people like this???
---
Same kind of thing as to why pures are still around. Gone are the days of obfuscating your name on hiscores and looking like a main then stacking someone of the same CB level out. 
---
Most low-def pures are 1) just for fun. Unique builds. And 2) makes fights faster. I’d think point 2 stands for safing as well.
---
Oooo right! But after this, I'll never invite him to appear in one of my nightmares though. :D Fool me once etc...
---
Can we have a serious look at zalcanos drop table.
---
The uncut onyx has significantly dropped directly as a result of its release, due to both flooding the market with chaos runes (which are used to buy the onyx) and also from dropping the onyx itself.
---
Remove the onyx and cut down the chaos runes dropped
---
are you still doing this?? i keep checking back in to see if you've posted any more of these foods
---
Ranks give you trophies, which are untradable, and the rewards come from points. You should play it because you enjoy it, this will probably be the best that league will get, so take advantage of it. The main game will be around for a long time as well

 I’m generally curious, if I were to use chrome Remote Desktop to control my computer while I’m at work, I’d like to be able to woodcut and afk at trees without having to have my phone opened to the OSRS app at all times, however, I feel like it’s going to flag my account, and that’s the last thing I want.
---
Yeah blazers are probably one of the best dmm clans.  RoT is a great multi clan, but they don't really have many top tier 1v1ers.  I was in the GG/Lit/CD/FL/CL clan alliance last dmm tourney and I was expecting to get battered by the RoT/CT/Tata/Ex/DL/Sv clan alliance in multi but my clan got all our fed 1v1ers through.  RoT's best guy got to top 8, if you look back at the stream of the finale his name was reyalS ttaM. Blazers went into the multi stage of the finale alone with no alliance and did very well, taking 1st, 2nd, and 4th.

A q p

Completion of agility course gives you the most XP compared to all other steps (135 XP for first 5 steps combined, 495 XP for final step by itself), OP teled to the start of the agility course before finishing the final step, rendering his lap basically pointless. F's in the chat for OP

Yeah but I can sell gp for real life money once I quit and can invest that in real life stocks
---
I think the prestige trophies are the incentive to play, not money imo. It's probably better to grind CoX or ToB for money and buy the rewards instead of grinding the league for the 2 months if you only care about the items.
---
Yea. I finished the dorgeshun edible with fingers and fillets
---
Oh shit not agaaiiiiinnnnnnn
---
:o
---
To allow players to continue playing their mains while getting the rewards on their alt.

do you have pics?

Also removing diary requirements for shortcuts

thnx

I'm curious how that happened!

07 graphics are from 2003. They look fine for their time, fit the medieval art style, and I like the style of the faces honestly. It's much more serious and fantasy looking. It lets the player use more of their imagination for the faces. Overall, OSRS graphics make more sense consistency-wise and for the type of game it is. An HD remaster should remaster this art style, not the way they did it in 2008 when they changed the art entirely.
---
Reminds me of RSPS 😂😂

I'd rather allow someone to remove the parchment to have a 100% refund of both the item and money. Remove it if you plan on just doing edge/PVP fighting, and reapply it for deep wild. That way if someone with a trouver parchment was running to below 20 wild and dies, you still get the parchment money
---
Honestly drops like this is why I'm not grinding clues in tl... barely counts towards points and it'll be gone in a couple months
---
It's more commonly dropped and less commonly owned, for obvious reasons
---
Nah, the opposite.
---
I use video guides because they take less effort and allow me to complete quests quicker.
---
I completed the Sote light puzzle with no wasted time except for my own misclicks. There's no way I could do that while going back and forth to a text based guide.
---
It's the same reason why video guides for basically everything are super popular on YouTube.
---
Oh no he tore down your misconception, what an asshole.
---
Delete every post in past week except this one. Make it the only one at the top page
---
How lame... do you have a link to the source? I hate that they are doing that. Means you can just buy the accomplishment. I hate that
---
The account he is using to chat from is likely a throwaway. Doesn't matter what action they take against it.
---
If you didn't I still have the app I'm sure theres a way I can get you the apk. It's a very helpful app I just wish it could continue to be updated.
---
That’s basically right, there’s a few helpful tips out there but most of it is just learned by doing/ watching good pkers.
---
You will die a few times, I still do occasionally, but every time I do I know why/was an error on my part. 
---
It’s been a long time since I’ve died and didn’t know the exact reason/what I messed up in f2p pking.
---
Oh I totally understand but also with classic those addons are still available and allowed by Blizzard, everyone plays their own way. As for Runelite it’s arguably better than OSB due to the fact it allows for better framerates (still capped to 50 because it was made with british displays in mind circa 2001) and provides every feature without a pay wall, and if you go onto the official site for osrs and looks in the news you will see Jagex confirming that RuneLite has worked with them to remove anything from their client that was deemed unfair, and as a user of the client I can say that a majority of the plugins provide moreso visual improvements, notably the GPU and Skybox plugins, or QoL changes where I can see xp rates of however I’m training or a box to appear on the tile I clicked on to show where my character is moving. RuneLite has proven itself that it’s not a cheat client (as those unfortunately  do exist) and if you look up what some actual cheat clients do you will see the difference. An example being one that switches your protection prayers for you, and can also switch 7 gear pieces within 1-2 ticks. Now that’s real cheats.
---
Technically like, over 2000, cus of all the tasks from lvl 1 - 200m firemaking xp, and also the tasks for playing wintertodt
---
why are there even bots just ban them bro lol
---
Change to TwistyBois and support
---
Can you imagine how hard that puzzle must have been on opening day of the quest. Wish I could go back and see the chaos. Doing SOTE day 1 was great but the isolation killed that chaos imo.
---
I agree. I just never thought someone would go through the trouble to mimick a forum website for gold in a virtual game. Also, I had never been to the RS forums before.
---
According to the wiki, pets will transfer to future leagues only.
---
Pets transfer between leagues, not to the main game. They have a much higher droprate so they would devalue main game pets.
---
Ahhh that’s where they transfer. Thanks for the clarification :)
---
Currently, you can’t exit the imp-in-a-box banking interface with the ‘esc’ key. Can this be fixed?
---
Oh word I would say get that up a few levels and camp wyverns for Atleast a few range levels. What ign I’m always down to help when I’m on.
---
Agility or herblore are probably top contenders, but it obviously depends on your account build
---
The fact that I've barely touched Zeah in the main game actually makes this challenge 100x more fun. I love learning about all the little things and really makes me appreciate all the zeah updates
---
If they remove the ballista you can still get double items like 2 inferno capes etc, especially annoying with the helms. A dharock helm is almost a downgrade over the neitz in a tribrid fight I feel.
---
Is rolling back BH to the previous system a possibility?
---
yeah I honestly have no idea why they'd make it tradable. Make it an achievement that you can show off - you were there, you did a cool thing.
---
I’ve subbed. 
---
Hey do you think it would be possible to start now and place in rune or dragon tier? 
---
Also how can you tell what percentage you are in, are there figures on how many people play twisted league?
---
Probably the only 10/10 Runescape tattoo in the world. Stands on its own as a dope tattoo even if weren't related to the game
---
Reminds me of 76k-tricking back in 2008 in the old new old new wildy.
---
Oh thats a uhh... Hugely and well balanced negative
---
Also, instead of locking Zulrah behind an existing quest, could we get an additional quest that gives more Zulrah lore?
---
As I close in on 6000 points, I find this more and more frustrating
---
Reality check:
---
It will be worth it because the prices will be exorbitant for the very reasons you've mentioned
---
well obviously its abused aswell but i think if you pk normally you would make more money now compared to previous bh if you were not able to get consistent tier 10s i think
---
What's the issue here
---
yeah I'm thinking agility since I haven't even started fishing and I can't do barb fishing until 48
---
Mole if you don’t have pet and is fun and consistent money.
---
Not the best GP but a good mixup. I’m also assuming you have fally hard done
---
Didn’t black out the map, gl recovering your account kiddo
---
At the end of the twisted league, do un-spent points carry to the next league?
---
Konar assigned the trolls in a specific location, that’s the downside to her task sometimes I can’t cannon.
---
If you legit have nothing else, then go camp zulrah for 1000 kills until you can make it back to raids
---
hopefully  for you the permanent collection log for twisted league is gonna be a thing
---
So ban the IP not hard.
---
Especially with it being released in 2005 so comparably limited resources. These guys have not played runescape so it is almost like seeing what someone would have to go through day 1 with no way of finding a solution without doing it themselves.
---
I started an account with prayer gang and then I came to the realization it only applies to bones from monster kills. I also realized it doesn't let you pick up bones.
---
My strategy was going to be go to Forthos, kill the Shaeded Beast and then slap 100 dragon bones into the burner to repair the prayer altar to have access to fast prayer recharge against zombie druids. I can't do that on prayer gang.
---
It's subjective. Aside from some errors Slayermusiq does like saying the cages skeleton in underground pass is random when it's fixed (these are always mentioned in the comments), there's no way I could use a text guide and do quests quicker than with a video guide.
---
I understand some people don't learn as well with videoguides and struggle to follow them, so for them, written guides are probably quickest.
---
2*
---
Make it like the Xerics talisman;
---
Monsters in the stronghold drop "skull fragments" or something, then you can just use those to add charges to it.
---
I really like this and hope they have been tracking TL playtime.
---
IGN is BSISCENESAFE, I’ll be on all day cause I just got off duty but I’ve got a meeting in about nine hours so I don’t feel like driving 90 miles just to come back.
---
Lol, this is exactly what happened to RS3's BH. Why did OSRS devs not learn from RS3's devs mistakes? 
---
Also, would reverting the entire BH update be better than outright removing BH? Did the old BH have this problem?
---
^ This is why the community is so toxic...
---
Kind of a little known secret but if you wear the scuba apparatus and a fishbowl it will keep the gas out and clean air coming in!
---
New builds incoming
---
In the most recent blog, phoenix recolors will be polled using 1k firelighters of one color. Would it be possible to reduce that to 100 or less? I've done over 750 clues and only gotten around 60 of each color. I don't think I'd ever be able to reach the number necessary for a single recolor at that rate. This seems over the top considering it takes a single ore to recolor the golem, or crafting a single rune to recolor the rift guardian.
---
&gt; They are on a mission to get to Cthulu and he is at the end of the puzzle. He keeps spawning Mind Flayers at every pedestal to represent the shades.
---
But I love your idea too! Maybe I'll bring that in on the third 8 hour session of this puzzle for flavor.
---
I like the idea of this, but I was thinking more along the lines of somehow turning them into prayer xp, like on an altar? or a pyre of some sort?
---
Can you let us know who? We RSJ check all applicants and do our best to prevent these kind of things but unfortunately scumbags work their way in everywhere. As far as im aware no ranks in the CC were informed of this so if you could let us know who (and provide any proof) we'll get this looked into and potentially refunded.
---
Eh I've had an iron for awhile, but twisted league outs a whole new spin on it
---
I feel like it's more like "it's ironmen with a new breath of fresh air"
---
The perks are really fun, the xp boost make iron less tedious, and tasks keep you going for something always.
---
This is how it works now, you just give it skull pieces to charge it; you imbue it at the end of the dungeon.
---
Maybe he wont, but you probably will.
---
It is a must try.
---
Jagex can ban someone from playing their game though and I believe they may be able to enact laws against it if the guy is selling the gold, as it’s violating their IP
---
We can already recharge it using the pieces of the staff, I think that's enough. Just stock up on them.
---
Its 5x xp and eventually you unlock more xp boosts later.
---
They even said as it was coming out they designed it so causals can play and get reward
---
Toggle bank fillers to stop RSS from autobanking
---
Agreed, I'm starting to think of all the possiblities!
---
They've already said they're doing it
---
I play Dofus wich is a game where you can have up to 8 people party up for dungeons, I play 8 characters to get all the loot from dungeons. Thats 88$ a month in sub fees.
---
I laugh when people complain about the 11$ for runescape.
---
Forcing pkers to risk more will not stop boosting if they use alts, bots, friends, or clanmates to boost as they can just trade back their risked items, essentially making 0 risk.
---
“And I believe the HD version had the animation too”
---
"Botting is out of control! Ban free trade! Make the wild safe! "
---
Just uninstall the launchers. That's the best you can do on your own ...
---
to add a new quest for lore is a brilliant idea!!
---
I would hust send them to my wheat field lol
---
Finally a good tattoo
---
Idk why it matters how much others are allowed to play
---
1-2 hours a day is plenty of time to make decent progress on twisted league
---
to be fair, once you learn the rotation zulrah is not a hard boss. At first it is overwhelming that's true, but to make Zulrah easier (easyscape) is in my opinion not the right thing to do.
---
Black knight fortress or the troll quests would be good i think. Maybe monkey madness if the dnd game is wild
---
Yeah I havent has this much fun since the first week of osrs
---
Accept that this is a battle you can't win and that bots have basically no effect on your playing experience.
---
Awesome! Another bit of daily money is the Varrock diaries and miscellania
---
Even if you used to know zeah, they've changed it significantly
---
I love it
---
A month before release, a lot of yters were talking about how all new content have instances and why it's bad for the community. Reddit users agreed and suggested more "old school" bosses like kbd,kq, Callisto etc. They did exactly that and now this comes up.
---
you an me both bub
---
Or when the man at fishing guild strolls by the shark spot
---
5 man teams for a bit are just fine, the difference loot wise is minimal and the speed difference almost makes up for it, nothing toxic about it. The game is an mmorpg, you dont need permission to enter a group skilling boss.
---
why you always lying
---
why do ankous there and not catacombs?
---
I recognize that shirt and pants combo, have fun getting hacked
---
I think for me it comes down to the duration. I've played RS all my life (even EoC) and I just cannot do those long subscriptions runs. I usually play 1 - 3 months then put it down for a while. This mode has completely refreshed it and fits my timings perfectly.
---
Make it instanced and give players the choice...
---
If you have nothing useful to add, why comment?
---
Why fletch?
---
Yeah, I know, but I'm just gonna wait until 41 mining and I can afford the rune one rather than running over there every 10 levels for a minor upgrade.
---
Cool, you owe me around 16 billion I think, meet w301 lumby bank with 10b and we cool. Or I’ll hack your clan
---
Yeah tbh i just want the g.e. removed too. I understand why people like it but it killed pretty much the entire social aspect of the game for me personally. I really liked feeling like my skills were marketable and in demand. It felt like a medieval economy instead of a 21st century economy. I wonder if theres a private server with no g.e.?
---
It's not that hard to imagine, hardly anything fails besides pvp stuff
---
Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
I didn't mean for my comment to come off as angry, it was meant to poke fun like yours.
---
The economy would be amazing again
---
Skilling would be worth your time
---
Gold selling sites wouldn't really exist like they do now either
---
So it'd be like 10x healthier
---
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
---
There's a lot of bias bc people who don't care for twisted league just aren't playing it so they're not talking about it either. There's also a lot of people that like it but aren't playing it because they have no interest in it but like watching YouTubers do stuff, similar to DMM
---
This is not funny
---
Make the pieces tradeable and then make it so you have to actually receive the pieces from a drop to complete the diary.
---
I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as yourself.
---
Nope. I logged into a lv3  that was older rhan osrs when it came out on mobile it had not been touched in well over 5 years.
---
Courier and harvester aren't even that good
---
Not gonna change it, just gonna recycle it. The same way they did with Torva lol
---
Or when the farmer by the master farmer in ardy strolls by
---
Cool?
---
I don't think the elite diary increases the amount, but yes.
---
i may a thought without having a perfect solution. combining something heavily needed for normal spell book + a runecrafting update is a nice basis and theres more creative people that may help out and add their thoughts to it. smd for real
---
You can pm me or ask in game any questions about farming or otherwise if you want
---
Never happened to me, I never got kandarin hard until after 80 agility lol
---
Not nmz? Come onnnnn
---
&gt;no net gain/loss on the main game, like pking. 
---
???
---
You can't get gold and items from pking any more?
---
yes we do have a running laps skill and almost nobody enjoys it at all so whats your point again? we gotta keep that boring shit in because we have the same concept of a boring skill already? thats 2 negatives my man
---
i hit 70 and stopped lmao
---
It's really fucking fun IMO. Def worth to try it out
---
Oh, like the RS3 style. I was thinking that you were trying to combine them into a single item and couldn't figure out how or why that would be helpful
---
I think they will never discontinue old league rewards. So you can spend your points on it next league. And if leagues stop being a thing, I think they said they'd add it to the main game somehow anyway because they don't want to make phat type rares
---
Until you get 3 of them spawn at once and only getting zapper + resurgent damage
---
Holy shit that was a bad day for nmz
---
The system is supposed to not let you do anything without having a username. They are getting around that somehow
---
Fucking lol
---
Courier allows you to not need to bank for gathering skills meaning higher xp/hr. Never need to give up a rock is actually a valid thing early mining. I thought itd be terrible for aerial fishing but with how close the bank is you just chop all the fish whenever you run out and you get longer trips each time.
---
It's always worth it
---
Lol it was a line from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
---
Tip of the year right here
---
Super Smash Bros Melee
---
They should just have PK worlds where you're forced to risk a certain amount to participate in PvP. There should be no points or rewards outside of what the players you kill drop on death. Creating a mass influx of items and gold for nothing is not how we fix PvP
---
It's a Cave horror from Mos Le'Harmless, this one escaped from the caves couple months ago
---
Don't think anyone who's serious about placing high will be taking it honestly.
---
You get a lot of points from firemaking sure, but that just seems like absolutely nothing in comparison to slayer boost and clue scroll rewards
---
Big Nice
---
No you can still get emblem upgrades and loot crates.
---
My post was a bit satirical and to point out the hypocrisy of the subreddit. You will see many comments similar to mine when talking about pvp and loot on this subreddit.
---
Also a bit not satirical in the fact that I don’t believe a completely separate faction of the game should affect the main game.  There were no tradeables for dmm. There would have been a riot if there was.
---
You could literally check the wiki in 15 seconds to see that elite diary increases it too lol
---
you can get a rune scim from the crypt zombies/skellys or from organized crime. You can hop worlds to get around the timer but I haven't actually tried that yet so idk how well it works. The other option is slayer as the brimstone chest has some good drops.
---
hellhounds drop tons of clues, you can get them skilling as well. 
---
by the time you get to rune smithing you could have trained combat and gotten gear as drops.
---
[The wiki has a guide to all gear available in twisted league.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Twisted_League/Guide/Equipment)
---
I miss that first week of dmm, all the great YouTube videos, streams.. iron man content just isn’t fun for me to watch.
---
I have a level 79 pure and I’ve legit never had this happen to me. I have maybe like 1/10 or less targets who are looters and sell but I’ve never had someone try to “negotiate” out of a fight.
---
Also went to check hotspots once but they were pretty dead, haven’t had too much experience with them.
---
I'd vote for that, unfortunately most of the so called "PvP community" does not want to risk more in fights so it would likely fail the poll.
---
This mechanic is kind of like "Crucible" on release where you had to risk some gp to enter the arena and if you left, your opponent received the money. I had a lot of fun there (because I was 99 summ) but eventually it became kind of stale because SoA + steel titan became the meta and no one would go there anymore.
---
Just a good old PVMer not being toxic. This guy should definitely allowed to be able to vote in PVP polls, what do you think boys?
---
That creature in the back is the second cameraman in my mind.
---
I think you’re right, but the thing people need to realize is There’s enough of practically every high level item in the game at this point. The only reason half of top-tier gear has held its price is because of merchers and hoarders.  
---
Just look at some of the previous data streams and check out how many bosses were killed in that year, or how many pets there are of certain bosses, with that number you can get a fairly educated guess on how many items that boss dropped since pet release.
---
I've never played RS3 but the masters you get the skillcapes from wear them hooded.
---
Idk, the battles for iron are hilareous.
---
Safing originates from rsc due to how pking mechanics worked. There's value in not safing in f2p since stacks are so low but in p2p safing is a dated relic of a bygone era from when people sucked at pking and struggled to do basic shit like switching their weapons then clicking the spec bar. Modern pking you can easily get stacked without being able to react even if you're anglered and safing is only used as an excuse by bad players who think that's the reason they can't kill you. They are blinded by rose tinted glasses and think shit like honor pking still exists when everyone else has moved on. People will call you a safer for any reason. Ignore it if you can or turn your chat off so you don't see it
---
Two parter:  
---
1. What is kc? I keep seeing it referring to something's value is my best guess. 
---
2. Anyone have an idea when the next Swampletics will come out?
---
See this? COMES OUT THE FOOKING GROUND!
---
Yep, 100%. Fucking hate twisted league. DMM is 1000000x more exciting
---
I focused on skills and things like that for the long run of the account, got 99 agility first before I did anything and have continued to grind going off that :)
---
I mean it’s been that way for a long time.
---
If it's this easy to bot, how would adding better rewards change anything, except add more incentive to bot?
---
Weeeere not gonna take it!
---
I pk normally and I’m profiting from it, not heaps but maybe a mill an hour and I’m having fun on it
---
Sometimes mistakes need to be made before you can learn, and BH in its current state is a fucking massive mistake.
---
What is twisted league
---
I did 99 runecrafting first.
---
Personally I prefer training every other skill and going on a steady diet of god's tears and rubbing the lamps of robin williams and sometimes will smith.
---
We all said the same thing 10 yrs ago
---
Why shower if you're just gonna get dirty again?
---
Is that Mod Mat K is the green jacket?
---
I only use it on my f2p only acc. Useless on my main
---
Dude, that’s nice. All my condolences on the hours spent, but that pet tho. First I’ve seen. Gz!!
---
But both subreddits full of jokes of shitting on mtx doesnt really increase the new players intrest
---
How old is woox again?
---
&gt;I only PK on beta/tourney worlds every now and then because of all the trash "PKers" our in the game these days.
---
That’s not pking, and you don’t know what you’re talking about. Tourney worlds are full of toxic trash with level 40 accounts in the main game who run around and rag in BIS. Most PKers are not toxic and the toxic ones are few and far in between, id liken it to a crasher in PVM.
---
But... u dont kill them half way then switch. If u get 3 damises you just hug one on the other and kill the one in the back.
---
Just get the boots 4head.
---
Turn ya caps off
---
&gt;No player "Stephen1123s" found
---
Not on the Hiscores. Was this an actual account that was already banned since this post or was he just shit talking on a lvl 3?
---
We've been asking for this for years now.
---
They're gonna have same name on both games though..
---
/s
---
think you just lost the main game
---
No potential smackdown, no upvote. Sorry that’s just the rules.
---
1. kill count
---
2. when everyone stops asking
---
Well cos you’re playing wrong damn game.
---
I think forcing a death match will lead to stale gameplay as there's always a best in slot strategy. I don't think we're looking for people to risk "the same".. I think we're just looking for people to not risk zero, so perhaps a 50k-5m death fee that scales based on variables. I'm not sure, perhaps some pkers better than me can chime in lol, hard to keep both edgeville and deep wild pkers happy at same time, there's lots of options and it's really, really difficult to figure out what's right, but this current state needs to be stopped ASAP is something we can all agree on. It's not pking it's gold farming and they're just gunna sell the gp.
---
Have seriously been thinking of putting a hold on combat to get 99 fishing or wcing for a good cash stack - I can put into supplies for training range/getting good melee gear/or investing in prayer/POH
---
I've found the most engaging way to play is to set a bunch of goals. I make a list of things I want (B-gloves, ancients, etc). Then I write out the requirements in order... (Eg. Quest A requires Quest B, which requires 42 fishing, 54 thieving). I complete them quest by quest which forces me to train my skills.
---
HK is the gateway for Chinese people to invest in western markets
---
He definitely hasn't bathed yet since the League came out.
---
No one should complain when these guys get shot. They’re asking for it
---
You’re delusional if you think watching someone kill the same easy boss - with the same shit-tier predictable mechanics - over and over is more fun.
---
I swear mod ash has never been to wt
---
Hell yeah! I’ve been thinking about grinding out the rc levels as well. I did my mage levels there and it was super quick, and bloods will be very much needed. My only hesitation is that velds drop a ton of them, so I’m still debating the grind. 
---
Good luck to you as well! Top 500 rc would be awesome! If you’re 73 you’re probably already ranked fairly high, right? I was briefly top 200 for combat stats and slayer, but I’ve been grinding clues too much for that to still be the case. 
---
I really love this new game mode. The excitement to be had over otherwise minuscule accomplishments is a breath of fresh air, and it reminds me a lot of playing as a kid. Jagex *really* crushed it with this.
---
did 99 at WT with 10hp and endurance relic, literally only ate 2 cakes the entire time I was there.
---
Crafting and prayer
---
They're both a problem that needs to be fixed
---
Freedom to commit financial crimes and kill pregnant girls with impunity.
---
I can't really agree to be honest. I like the current state of pretty much every skill bar maybe runecrafting and agility. Agility mainly because it all feels exactly the same and the XP rates never get higher than 70k/hr even post 99. Which is just.. eh. I'd rather there be a high effort version of this that's actually rewarding. Want them to stop being afraid of contesting ardy courses rates because that course is relaxed and low effort af, and provides profit.
---
Runecrafting mainly cos you just do zmi till 77 and bloods till 99. Both at the same slow rate of 30-40k/hr, and the only alternative is to spam lavas for like 70k/hr if you're good at it, or pay stupid amounts of money / high effort run Alts for actually good rates. It's a boring skill with very little training variance and rates that are stupidly low because the content is designed to be easy. Again, could do with a high effort method that actually rewards you.
---
The rest of the games skills all have this balance. An afk method thats decent pace. A good variety. A high effort / APM method (tick manipulating inclusive) and a profit method.
---
Every other skill gets over 100k/hr, aside from slayer long term without some very efficient work. So there's no issue there except in agility and RC (without abusing runners).
---
Appreciate it man. I think I'll be going the ardy Knight route and just dealing with it for a couple nights.
---
There are past muted that i have gotten but only 1 other in the past 4 years.
---
Pretty sure your own house will almost always load slower than popular hosts, since the instance already exists. Your own house needs a new instance to be created when you go inside each time.

You know this is twisted league right?
---
Its a satire post
---
Deserved.
---
Has there been DPS calcs for Twisted League Raids yet? I'm curious which speedruns are possible with Focus, especially if you don't have stuff like Lance/Brimstone
---
Not too long ago someone was complaining lms was dead, and it took 20 minutes to start a game. Sometimes you have to pick and choose which way you are going to be fucked, rather then fix all the problems.

The midwest

It was more of a joke than anything based on the meme about them all being guys lol

... I'm brain dead. I went to the one near centre furnace. Thank you, I'm going to go buy myself a pickaxe now 😂

Honestly the funniest shit has definitely been watching the collective group groans whenever someone drops a good Wintertodt drop
---
why can't you play?

No.

Yeah something like that is demanded by deep wildy pvmers and deep wildy pkers/antipkers.

There a building near the magic carpet NPC in Pollnivneach that has a table - having a 90 degree angle to safe spot/psuedo-flinch from helps immensely. You can only pickpocket twice per knockout. 
---
The idea is to have the bandit on one side of a corner, with you on the opposite side of that same corner. You click to knockout - if it fails, step back to your side of the corner (one square basically) and wait for your health bar to disappear. When it fades, try again. That helps insure that they don't move and you take less damage.

Depending on your thieving level, it may be easier to just Hosidius fruit stall it until the mid 50's to 60's.

One night I was eating dinner with Steve Jobs and his wife and his dog was barking at the computer, I just kept eating lol
---
Your points will carry over and you can access old rewards with those points. So no worries take your time and enjoy it while you can :)
---
hehe you said African Blackwood.
---
How is trashing the value of the rewards for the minigame and making it super dull to play the answer. If the issue is minutes to start a game then jagex then needs to make a fix like maybe smaller lobbies, rather than the bots being a "solution"
---
seems a bit fucking dumb if that's what you actually said.
---
There are birthdays I can't remember but I'll never forget that a whip alchs for 72k.
---
Yes, I have fallen for the trap.
---
I am already working on it :) Got 234 so far but limited due to work schedule
---
The whole “first person to give me 5m will regret it” is a joke i got from a scam people used to do which was “first person to give me x-amount wont regret it” or “looking for a genuine person”
---
I had to do some electrical work at a prison today, and when I tried to check in with the guards at the front desk they were just shouting at their computer...turns out he was yelling about how slow hes progressing in the twisted leauge because he chose abyssal accumulator lol.
---
Truth
---
Yes points are going to be carried over league to league.  Also if you aren’t an ironman most of the rewards can be purchased later with gp.  Personally I have no desire to play leagues as I would want to finish in the top 1% which is impossible when you have responsibilities.  Seems unfair to give the people who can play the most an untradable trophy.  Will just show who has no life and a neck beard I guess.
---
Because I can still follow a game I don't play..?? Plenty of people watch football and don't play it. Lot of good content creators rn that make quality videos.
---
Vouching for this method. I was way more nervous doing my pure's cape than my main's when I went tried a few weeks back. I have never heard of this as a tip before but I randomly started doing it during the fight and it really helped calm the nerves.
---
At the end of leagues could we be rewarded with one fifth of the xp we gained to our main accounts. 
---
This would be similar to when RS3 tried Darkscape, and it had to close. You would get a lamp where you could choose which skill to add the xp too, so that pures can't get defence for example
---
So how’s it going man?
---
pog
---
It does when I try.. hmm
---
I think they try to do this as a way to not be caught or something... Doesnt make sense to me because I'm sure they keep a transaction history so I'm sure its just as safe as you mentioned, just trading.
---
There's only 350 total points for completing farming contracts. That's a terrible reason to take it, just a nice little bonus.
---
Gz! I'm at 19200 kc still no pet been trying for like 3 months hope to end my suffering soon.
---
ooooh thank you!!
---
Also it’s riddled with Venezuelans
---
The best noob-friendly progression is Vannaka -&gt; Chaeldar -&gt; Konar/Nieve.
---
Not decent, but magic longbows do get you a tiny profit.
---
Fucking beautiful.
---
They probably focused server speed to twisted league worlds, and limited it to the others
---
No problem, happy travels.
---
I got my first kill two days ago after 30+ attempts. Now I haven't died in 100+KC and do two every trip unless mage phase forgets it's a mage phase. 
---
It just clicked.
---
Switch prayers first.
---
Then eat.
---
Then run to position.
---
3 switches. Body. Legs. BP-&gt;Trident/Unholy. While running.
---
Pray pot while running.
---
Learn rotation 3 first. It's easiest. 
---
Good luck.
---
Some of the videos have mistakes that make me rewind it and extends what I'm trying to figure out confusing me and making me a bit angry (east west). The humor is personal preference as I find it to be pointless and not amusing (get to the point).
---
yea you do but to me its worth taking 5 mins to get pieces than to not use it
---
Yo this is a whole lot (and I cannot stress this enough) gang shit
---
Please stop, my penis can only be so erect.
---
Especially when you tie in mistakes and "jokes", waste of time.
---
It's rewarding for doing nothing, giving both loot and experience is very weird.
---
Don’t you mean thank you, Oziach?
---
Have you ever thought about bringing Sebastian Gno random event to OSRS? It's a forgotten random event that never saw the light.
---
[Wiki entry on Sebastian Gno](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sebastian_Gno)
---
Was it worth it?
---
maces being as fast as scimitars doesn't make sense aeronomically
---
Gangs don't drop normal planks, only oak/teak/mahogany unfortunately!
---
Welp, guess it's time to watch futurama again for the 1000th time.
---
It was also suggested to make it autocast crumble undead, which idk if they ever added that? but that would also be good, as I know it's a very good method for training your magic in f2p
---
Then they would just rwt using items
