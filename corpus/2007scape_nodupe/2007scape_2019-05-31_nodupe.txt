Switch the mage robes wit ranger set on the two eds. Makes more sense that way.

Looks like Toad from Mario got 99 strenght
---
Sorry mate, but yes you are an idiot.
---
Or visafe
---
:/
---
My dad was the same. Worse in fact, because he still does it now.
---

---
They didn't grow up with this technology and some people can't quite understand it.
---
&gt;There was no way an account with this much time and effort put into it would risk everything for a lousy 4 mil scam, right?
---
A bitter lesson was learnt today.
---
R eally, people need to let other people enjoy the game how they want. If you don't like pvp then don't pvp
---
Why would you give a random person your blowpipe, especially when you are already broke?
---
Ah right, I knew there was something I was forgetting
---
^^also ^^my ^^herb ^^runs
---
^^^and ^^^the ^^^diary ^^^dailies...
---
Sick fuck's

Don't be so woke that you let your brain fall out, which is 90% of you "woke" folk.

Never lend anything besides to a friend you know irl so you can punch their face if they don’t give it back.

just stake it then chofl

I know I should be doing NMZ, but I'm from the year 2006 and new content scares me. Ammonite crabs are weird enough. I do need to imbue my rings, though..
---
Spirit tree to North West ge, ring of wealth tele,  and varrock tele after med diaries. If you tell there a lot, I like to put law, dust, and lava runes in my pouch. Gives you teleports to a lot of places, including house and ge.
---
&gt; Am I an idiot for falling for this scam?
---
I think we both know the answer to this mate but I don't really want to be rude.
---
There's nothing to do, you traded him your blowpipe. If you wanted to keep the blowpipe, you shouldn't have traded it away, to anyone, for any reason other than selling it on the G.E for the current going rate.
---
Reddit really is the best..
---
It's when a player claims he was wrongfully banned and posts on reddit hoping to get his account unbanned then a jmod looks into the activity of his account and tells them that he was without a doubt botting or real world trading etc etc. Aka the jmod smackdown becuase he is getting everyone on his side then gets destroyed by a jmod in front of thousands of people
---
Insanely lucky photoshops
---
Has the amount of nests you get from birdhouse runs been reduced? I feel like I’m getting less than I used to a few months ago. It’s either that or I’m just getting bad rng.
---
Because I trusted him, I look up to those with such high stats, and I couldn’t imagine someone risking their account for that.
---
Trimmed mining cape is the right answer
---
Is this the new f2p transportation system they polled?
---
Like EPIC FUCKING GAMES
---
Counts as a hammer for chests in raids...so it’d be consistent
---
what about for the rune one
---
Crabs? What are you even talking about now?
---
I like agility 😂
---
&gt;risk everything
---
He didn't risk anything. You gave him your blowpipe. It's his now.
---
Except they both suck
---
He’s risking his account by scamming me, he could get reported.
---
Burning a log, superheating an iron bar and burying a bone all in quick succession so it doesn't interrupt any of the other actions, thus giving him more xp/hr between the three skills than if he was training them one at a time (EHP is efficient hours played, so pretty much xp that you can expect to gain in 1 hours time.)
---

---
Where did I say that I need an elysian? What I said was that I thought getting an elysian and then infernal cape would be less hours than getting infernal cape and then elysian. Assuming I plan to get both of them then ely is the more efficient to get 1st.
---
If you have completed the inferno then you are able to get zuk tasks - which are a hell of a lot easier than killing it off task.
---
Yeah I bet Agility is up there with RC as being one of the rarest
---
Imagine joining the Black Arm Gang when the Phoenix Gang exists.
---
birdhouses have been [nerfed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Bird_Nest_Balancing_and_PvP_Changes), yes
---
il really try!!
---
The lore basically makes that impossible. Thank god.
---
oh my god thats hilarious
---
Unfortunately my gf and I dont have much content in this regard. Our choices are pretty much- 
---
Mole
---
Kq 
---
Gwd bosses are okay for duo, may only last a couple of kills
---
Wildy bosses
---
Corp is okay but it is more running than fighting
---
Also one thing to note is, since you are so much higher your friend/partner will have a difficult time getting kills which can be discouraging :/ so maybe try to keep pray off for easier parts. Or dont pot up sometimes
---
You can't block the email address either because they completely spoof the address to be the same one from Jagex. Also follow remember these things when reading emails:  
---
1. A real email will always show your character name not just "player"
---
2. Jagex will always message you via their website message centre
---
3. If you click the link, the phisher can see that and also gets your IP address. So don't click or you will get more.
---
4. Jagex will never make you enter your bank pin outside of the game
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Finally the phisher must've got your email from somewhere, so try googling your email address in "quotes". Maybe you made an account on a rs fansite 10 years ago that got hacked, and someone sold the emails to this dude. That's the reason I keep getting these. Try checking [this website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
---
Here's an example of a phish scam I received:
---
Nice.
---
Hey I’ve done this as well 0 raids completed for me though
---
Cool idea but having a watering canbpet is pretty dumb in my opinion, and not dumb in the "so ridiculous it's actually cool" way. If it was instead some sort of bug that found its way into the watering can I think that would be a much better idea.
---
Bruh 1% x 2% = 1 / 5000.

That's the same as a draconic visage from KBD.

That’s when the Wildy was safe. Then it became dangerous again and they were all moved to this cave.

---
Oh man I remembered it was like a personal ambition to see all the emotes. Whenever I saw a rare cape you know I'm asking to see that emote.
---
BONES the GOAT
---
I mean, you said it yourself, he is 125 combat with a lot of time spent on his account. Why would he beg in chat for a blowpipe?
---
Calisto. Such easy money. Just have one person assigned to hold loot and let the other person take the beating from pkers
---
I tried doing this for about 30 seconds and quit. How the fuck do you people care that much about being perfect with ticks.
---
Using the 221 ge price, raising them for 18 years (365 daysx18+4.5 for leap years) would be about .42gp/hr.
---
Unfortunately that’s the problem, there really is no risk on his part.
---
Ultimately you traded him an item and he backed out of a verbal agreement.
---
The only risk he took was potentially wasting his time if no one fell for it :/
---
I only use food dropped from other players at fly fishing spots
---
Shieet dude 2 edgy

People are lucky but also, they come here. Rare drops of all kinds happen to ppl. Youll get something rare at some point im sure. But it feels like everyone is always getting lucky and that simply isnt true
---
Bruh
---
Is this the Best way for getting the pet or is it still karambwans(no ticking here bois)
---
Some people are lucky and it's statistically inevitable. If Ranger boots are a 1/10,000 drop, then 1 in 10,000 people doing their first clue are going to get it on their first drop.
---
Just how it be, gamer.
---
Best of luck with that

Well I'd rather use the notifications and a smaller game window than not use the notification (very helpful for Wintertodt). Sucks that there's no way to shrink the clickbox tho.

It just seemed like an eternity. I'm glad I didnt know how many favours it was

Thanks man! Once I have the stats for elite void I’ll be turning into a 60 atk piety account with rigour :)

I did that one actually

Except it's over the course of its usage, not per interaction.

Who's to say the 73 wasn't first?

Isn’t it ridiculous that he thought he could make a joke out of a tough situation? Like how dare he?!?

On mobile even when zoomed in it tanks my fps as soon as I tele to mushroom meadow so you're not alone.

in hindsight this would've been a lot better, making brews was a huge money sink.

Not the garg boss pet unfortunately i love the look of that one, got kq, rocky, skotos, 2x hydra, chompy and smoke devil
---
That's my fear when I get my second 99 (which will come quickly after as I left 100k xp till 99 strength). I'm planning on both dropping and storing one at Zulrah, just to be 100% sure.
---
Untrimmed Con is nothing to scoff at though. From what I understand, it's probably the second rarest (or rarest, depending on your source lmao)
---
Bruhhhh
---
Hey guys, I'm just looking for a smaller clan to chill out in. I'm a mobile player due to travel so I'm not really looking to boss and stuff, just to hang and have some laughs. Anyone got a smallish clan I can join?
---
Holy shit, I'm rolling
---
Lol this same guy tried to get my shit earlier as well. Rip to the greedy noobs who fall for this shit
---
Hahahaha wow.
---
I get how it works, but that's not what the person I was replying to was saying.
---
damn i just finished my elite void grind a couple days ago you're lucky
---
Lol .. the main problem is that I use thieving as my main method for getting money in this game... if I found another good alt  for it I will stay at that number for ever as yoh said. :)
---
Working my way towards 90 mage currently 81. Pretty slow going bursting dust devil tasks and alching while running around. Considering bursting mm2 tunnels but I'm a little broke after 83 con, any other methods worth considering? Something semi-afk would be nice for commuting/work when it's chill
---
Haha, never going near that place, the gambling bots took my money way too many times lmao
---
Serious question- what is she doing?
---
I dont know i just like the feeling of improvement and becoming a better skiller and its also really fun.

I just out brown electric tape over my screen where the text is.

Yeah bloody bastard. Doesn't he know that everything should be serious at all times?

Looks kinda fun, i might try this method tbh
---
no you’re stupid, the highest def allowed in pure events has only been 39 to account for turmoil (2010 era) in the current state of osrs nothing over 20 is allowed to pure events. some would insist only 1 def is truly a pure.
---
you should be praying augury/rigour for the entire kill. i was getting low 2 minute kills at 85 mage with that set-up (minus ancestral hat and plus mage book.) 
---
also, mage potions are not worth it -- buy a mage book instead

This is true.

Magic dart also uses death runes and would max a 26 at his magic level on task. Iban's maxes at 28 on task. (This would both require an imbued slay helm/black mask)

99 slayer, make me use another master for what to kill.

Just go for 99 rc you’ll be set.

After Effects and Vegas Pro are the two that come to mind immediately, though they're rather expensive. I haven't looked into any free alternatives, but I'm sure you could find a couple if you look around.
---
Fair warning, these programs can look rather daunting at first glance, but they become considerably more easy once you understand the UI and what the tools actually do. Good luck.
---
Fair enough, I personally only pvm so I'd be quite gutted if someone somehow got into my account
---
Sounds like you need to buy membership
---
To flex on noobs in the ge
---
Pretty solid for a couple of months!
---
Lava runes have always been faster. Zmi changed the meta and quite a few players have max cash stacks now  that they want to burn to max out their account faster.
---
Buy membership then.

So you’re telling me to stop at 24 and move on?
---
The polled rate wasn't changed at all. Running has been in the game since runecrafting was added. Jagex acting shocked that rich players are paying runners is stupid.
---
Lord Kinobody lmao
---
This. Anyone who thinks it's "worse" now clearly missed the point.  ZMI exceeded polled rates and needed to be brought back within that range.  The issue wasn't "devalues muh Runecraft" it was stopping a precedent of "lol oops we didn't intend this to be 3x better than polled, let's just leave it"
---
Man that should not be a solution to this issue. I just started playing after 10 years. My total level is like 200 after playing nonstop for the past 2 days. Now the nostalgia is starting to pass and trying to do simple tasks is just being ruined.
---
you know who to call when you strike it rich.

This pet isn't yours.
---
Come on you know there’s a significant portion of this website that hates reddit as a whole, or never used it, and is only here because they love this game and every other online osrs community they could find is small, slow and has no real influence on the game itself.
---
Like come on 2007scape isn’t even a video game subreddit fan page, it’s literally a part of the game that you’re obligated to at least keep up with if you care about osrs
---
I see where you are coming from, and understand the point you are trying to make...But we will have to agree to disagree.
---
No I do not think they will disable running as a whole. Running has existed in the game since the beginning of time, and it will always exist.  They disbled it specifically for ZMI because it allowed players to exceed the polled XP rates by 3x. It's pretty important for jagex to produce content that remains consistent with how it was polled. 
---
If the warding method you mentioned allows players to far exceeded the XP rates the skill was polled at, then yes. They should do whatever they need to remain consistent with the way the content was described when the community voted it into the game. 
---
Again. That's the ONLY reason the HLC cared. They didn't care about the price, because GP is 0 time for them. Them complaining had NOTHING to do with the cost. So that argument is pointless.
---
Skotos, cause it looks DOPE.

Maybe I don't wanna expose myself like that 🤷🏻‍♂️

The cooking cape actually has good perks though. Cooking with it equip will never burn food.

The woodcutting Cape is just... a cape.

And?
---
Quick maths
---
Wait! Why are we arguing here? The solution is simple! If players can not be trusted to buy gold ONLY from Jagex the the simple fix is to remove free trade and to remove all risk based pvp! Wow its almost like they did this before and it 100% worked!
---
Grow up and accept that the commnuity is a toxic cesspool of cheaters and the only solution is to ruin trading for everyone.
---
I know right? Completely neuters the humor that earned that comment gold in the first place. It'd just be so much funnier as is, the line in italics, and nothing more.

Kree and kq for similar reasons, sounds of kree flapping was always cool

True I probably should do that maybe cut costs a bit.

Buddy do you know the difference between novel and novella or do you steer away from both?
---
Yeah I have the diary thanks. Managed to get some good loots from an hour now and it definitely outweighs the resource cost which is what I was concerned about.
---
That's not even kind of true.
---
There were rewards worth grinding in Stealing Creation, which gave it longevity.
---
It was possible to get free magic (and others) XP from Fist of Guthix, which gave it longevity.
---
The only reason Clan Wars is dead is because it offers no reward whatsoever.
---
Sounds about ash
---
bruh are you really running osrs on 22 fps

most bosses can be done in a group, some you might consider are dagannoth kings, corporeal beast or god wars.

damn, is that Zyzz on the right?
---
agreed

I’m sorry I disappointed you guys. Well, at least mommy is still proud!

Yeah, well you’ve rolled *those* drop tables thousands of times, virgin

Trash tier mods get paid to remove criticism. It got too much traction on r/all and since Jagex fucked up they had it removed.
---
 LMAO sellout mods, what is this, r/leagueoflegends? Watch this get removed aswell. Trash mods 
---
But gz bro
---
Edd lookin’ finee
---
Well this is nostalgia, but it would suck
---
Thanks, I fuckin hate it
---
Thanks man!
---
Highly doubt it. The mods are generally considerate, aware people. They seem pretty plugged in. Maybe they just smacked him down privately and he yielded without much fanfare.
---
I don't think medical statistics is different from regular statistics... it's still statistics
---
magic pot is worth if it gives you a max hit.
---
The fact that this subs mods get paid/influenced by Jagex to remove criticism because it gained too much traction? Especially when it turned out it was a Jagex fuckup all along? Embarrassing for this sub.
---
Lmao

Yeah I had testicular cancer and it’s a 98% cure rate and all I thought was how dead I already was..

How tf do you pvm on full screen? Do you scale your monitor to 720p or do you just break your wrist everytime you need to change your prayers?
---
They touched BA code in the last update. Who knows what sort of smuggle bugs were introduced with it.
---
Agility takes like 230 hours or something but you can get around 30-35m to 99 if you stick to rooftops for marks of grace. For a better skill though, probably slayer or runecraft
---
Once we  we get them in our clan they can leave whenever they want,but they won't because of the implacation.
---
Happy to take suggestions
---
If you practice it you can do it almost subconciously. And because  im not lazy? Like what else am i going to do Im sitting in front of the screen playing the game anyways  Its literally just a double click every ~half a second.
---
This is getting anti-semetic.
---
Look. Theres a pvp warning. That's more than enough safety measure

---
They're working with what they've got. If you've got a better idea to handle updates I encourage you to suggest it. I would assume there's probably technical issues with the majority of things people would suggest.
---
New players don't need to know everything. You're perfectly fine learning as you go. If you want to know everything, then yes, you should have to read patch notes. I can't think of any other game that handles it differently. Minor changes aren't permanently broadcasted for the casual player. That would be ridiculous.
---
love me some Rimming ton.
---
A huge amount of the % medical things give you are based on case study average. Mainly because there is no real way to test it and find the real chance. We have no possible way to track every iud and woman on birth control having sex. 
---
Pretty much it’s like how we get drop log chances. It’s 0.2*n with n being sex.
---
Literally who are these people?
---
3 levels to untrimmed agility and I think the cape looks pretty good, but the most appealing in my opinion is 100% runecraft cape
---
Lol I cottoned on to this guy straight away. His main and friends are usually upstairs in lumbridge castle bank bragging about luring folk. Be careful out there OP.
---
friendly reminder that anime is a gateway to pedophilia
---
OSRS reddit is better than the cesspit of Facebook Runescape groups.
---
They don't have the friendly banter, they don't have the sense of humor you see here. Just hardass, you got hacked don't ask me for money swine! Defensive purse clutching.
---
Just in case you're serious. His point is that falsely assuming that each occurrence has a 1/25 chance of pregnancy, then the probability of becoming pregnant after having sex 25 times is ~64%.
---
You can calculate this as (1 - probability someone does not get pregnant) = 1 - (24/25)^25 = ~.64
---
It's funny how upset pkers get when pvmers call them out on being assholes. You're literally hunting defenseless players 90% of the time and the comments you leave only further the point and make pkers look more toxic.
---
I see your game, hunter potion salesman!
---
It's the same skill where you can make a chained platebody that would normally take days in 2 seconds and form cooled bars without heating them.
---
I get that yes, but unless OP and friend were much more underleveled/geared than it would have to be real unlucky still. 
---
That sucks tho OP. Especially that an actual fucking sigil dropped ya know.
---
Ohhhh. I get it. I think thats silly but ye understandabl3.
---
I've done it before. It's fun to one item but not an effective way to train prayer. More fun just to good off late at night
---
on the other hand I'm glad the most difficult agility shortcut is 89.
---
Keeps 90% of these clan nerds out of my hair. ClanScape is at peak danger right now. I'd like there to be other options to hide or escape as well. Something with similarly tough requirements.

---
While you’re at it, soul wars. Soul wars is what hooked me.
---
Thats a fairly horrible thing to assume. It seems like OP isn’t opposed to children right now, so it seems illogical that she would come up with some scheme to get pregnant rather than just talk to him.
---
Also...IUDs hurt like hell when they are put in or taken out. He would’ve noticed the soreness for the next few days. It would be a difficult thing to hide.
---
I’m sorry that based on your experiences that that was the conclusion you came to, though. That really sucks. :/

Kind of annoying tbh. I wish they had "efficient but fairly realistic if you're super sweaty" methods, not "requires multiple accounts with membership" methods.

I didn't sign up for single-player mode only for the so-called most efficient methods of training to go against the spirit of the game mode by using other players to help you.

Or... contact customer support who would actually be able to help.

Good

Exactly. It’s not humans are going extinct it’s the opposite we need to stop breeding
---
I mean theres a difference between efficient, and unrealistic. Like blackjacking over ardy knights is efficient, or 2 tick barb fishing over sharks. But having 3 rune drag alts, while you barrage slayer and have more alts spec transfer you is unrealistic

there's thousands of unspoken positive anecdotes. happy customers like myself (old account broken into returned when I came back for OSRS) don't write highly upvoted complaints on reddit.

there is little to no visibility for people that have good interactions with Jagex. squeaky wheel and all that

I was at slayer cave when someone said on cc that there was a drop party at ge. Some lucky guy got a tbow

Regardless of whether they fucked up or not, deleting the post that looks suspicious AF.

You bought them for a reason, so get drunk again and figure out what you wanted to do.

I just made this mistake, ree.

He lives in Alabama =(

My laptop used to lagg when i went there, turned off runelite GPU and that solved it
---
Why did this get downvoted lmfao
---
You need a new imbued bow for a master clue. Keep it.
---
Weren't you just saying something about projection? :)
---
Also, you responded with my allegation that you're just mad and don't actually have any actual counterpoints to what I've said by being more mad and not stating any counterpoints.  Did you come here to entertain me because that's all you're doing rn.
---
\&gt; You can stop repeating the same big words over and over again. Nobody is impressed nor do we think you're smart for it. 
---
You're free to point out where in my comments I use particularly big or uncommon words, I could define them for your convenience.  Currently I'm gaining amusement while you're gaining nothing from this, this way you can at least learn something.

LOOOL as someone who's had this exact situation happen this is hilarious

I'm using the one I linked in my post "[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue\_scroll\_(beginner)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll_(beginner))", the fandom one has even less info on it. I did Giant Rats for a few hours after posting just to see for myself and still got no clue scrolls. I'll try to look more into it and try to get the table fixed/updated

I would rather skill and chip away at a goal and not experience setbacks. Besides that, community is toxic as hell.

They likely will, but no where near as much. They are lots of food alternatives.

i think the real drama is that for once there WAS none

Just think about it, in a few years you can have an essence runner for free.
---
What about the utterly massive influx of bots in p2p? you dont count that as drama??
---
Maybe i'm wrong, but i think it is possible for it to work this way: You time it so 1 tick has the darts triggering the manipulation and the next one has herb tar or kebbit claw manipulation, basically letting you stack a 3 tick and 1 tickmanipulation to get an average of 2 ticks per fish. Please correct me if i'm unenlightened.

I mean that applies to a jury but the general populace is allow to hold their opinions on the validity of claims based on what they’ve been presented.

Don't waste your time unless you're &gt;30. At least in the US, no one will do it for you if you're under 30.

Yeah the actual effectiveness every menstrual cycle is more like 99.95%. The fraction who it doesn't work for probably had  it misapplied/dislodged or had some freak genetics.

Likewise, condoms are far more effective than statistics would have you believe, because many break or people forget/lie (drunk, didn't notice a tear, "It didn't count because I pulled out") about not using them in studies.

since right now

Ofc. Works for me so everyone else must be lying!  U said urself it was ancedotal but concluded that it wasn't ancedotal... wtf.

You’re looking to deep into it, 10/10 observation tho Sherlock

Ya I used blowpipe and kbow if I needed range. My first try was like 71 range with kbow but I didn’t lure Jad and I got combo’d by the healers. Probably could have done it if I had lured jad

--mode=OFF arg turns off hardware acceleration.  This will stop those weird images from popping  up.

i'm pretty much just saying the first thing that pops in my head because I give so little fuck about this

They'd learn by asking just like how you learn everything else in runescape.

Ah true, my bad.. Not mention the super high requirements to make low-level stuff.
---
This is obviously something that should be in a gameplay settings menu, but we still don't have that. They should scrap the 3 different buttons on the settings tab and make it open an interface instead with a "gameplay", "interface" and "graphics" tab.
---
RS3 has a ton of gameplay options, like destroying empty vials when last dose of potion is used, same with bowls and beerglasses and a ton of other stuff.
---
So is there a solution? Yes, and it's pretty obvious since every game ever does it.
---
Firstly, he wasn't even choosing this hill, he was just correcting a misconception about said topic. 
---
Secondly, spouting the "right" opinions purely to pander and earn brownie points with some perceived greater mass is the most ridiculously poor use of individual agency. If you got an opinion, just say it and have the discussion. After all, the "centrists" are just individuals that you'll need to convince anyways.
---
It's kinda overdone at this point. Also, how do you know it's underrated when you can't even see the score yet?
---
If you want something afk astral running is a good option. Lavas are more gp/hr but they’re definitely not afk.

What do you need for solos then? No snark, I'm just curious

I found out that my runelite was so slow because it was completely running off native intel graphics instead of the 2GB Nvidia thing i had. I had to manually change it via the Nvidia control panel
---
Wanna test your graphics card? Turn GPU rending on and zoom out at Fossil island.

Yea as long as it's not BETTER it could be a good way to make mining etc. less aids

Is there some cc for finding a bc training partner, I haven't been able to train it for a long time now

Actually no, just saw that torv posted another vid abusing it. Every time he does this I see more and more people doing it.

You insecure with the rest of your stats? What gives?

Is there anywhere you can learn to raid that doesnt require pretty lategame stuff? wedoraids requires bgs or dwh, ive been gridning both but unlucky atm. Any ideas?

There are doctors you can find that are willing to do it if you search.

Wait wtf is autochat

200 manta rays holy shit, yeah not cool. At 800 for easy diary atm they are 8kea. Literally have to do aids ass minigame to get them. Currently drift net fishing getting around 1 manta ray per drift net. Should take only 6hours to get em. Yeah fuck drift net fishing. Lets check trawler out.
---
Says the guy intentionally misconstruing all the points about not wanting kids at the moment.
---
I'd assume you're trolling but it's really hard to tell at the moment.
---
Its because of free twitch prime memberships, ppl are selling fresh p2p accs cheap so they're suicide botting to try and make 1m back before it gets banned.
---
If you try do any collection skill anywhere on f2p its like this all the time
---
He never mentions securing his account, so it could very well be a case of leaked osrs/email credentials. 
---
I'm going to echo some of what the people on the OG thread said, use 2FA everywhere, osrs and email account included, check if your credentials have been leaked on haveibeenpwned, make sure you're using legit clients etc etc.
---
I really like sparking up a conversation with the people doing the same slayer task as you. I’ve made some great RS friends doing so.
---
&gt; According to you everyone who doesn't follow your logic is scum, nazi, racist... Talk about being intolerant.
---
It's simple. I think that anyone who can't take 1 second out of their day to be compassionate towards another human being is inherently selfish, and is destructive towards others. That in my opinion is bad for society as a whole, so if you've shown yourself to be a detriment to society you should be penalized socially.
---
Being called scum isn't the end of your life, it's just social incentive to not be human scum.
---
Racists are people that have racial biases that affect their underlying beliefs and thoughts. You misgendering someone doesn't make you a racist but it would make you a transphobe.
---
Nazis are people that believe in racial superiority, either of the germanic peoples, or more modernly, the "white" race. A Nazi is a person who allows this belief to affect their thoughts and axioms. Nazis are racists but not all racists are nazis.
---
Scum in my opinion, is just someone who is a net negative to society and for the benefit of society should probably not participate in society socially.
---
&gt; You see, that's exactly why everyone dislikes people like you.
---
In the circles people live in, they don't like anyone that is different than them. Lots of people like the people that are in their circles, and there are lots of people and lots of circles.
---
I would ask that you re-evaluate your head space but that's an extremely hard thing to do when you have to spend so much time digging yourself out of your own biases and views.
---
Now do it at with lv 1 firemaking - the lower the better
---
Everytime I call the cops I get trolls instead who run around me in a circle screaming weee wooo weee wooo while flicking smite and retribution.
---
Bank them? I would have filled them with something nasty then thrown them at Sedridor.
---
If they did i would sub for 5years
---
&gt; Jagex knows it's happening but why don't they do anything about it?
---
* Most real players don't *actually* care; they still play the game and pay membership
---
* Bots pad player-count numbers
---
* Some people that bot also pay for membership
---
There's very little reason for Jagex to actually go hard against bots. But reporting un-verifiable bot-kill numbers and rarely hosting bot buster streams is enough to quell the few vocal people.
---
wait. wasn't the guy who got infernal cape that then said they should get rid of non BIS max cape this month?
---
Needa lobby jamgex for Wrath prayer if you're going to do it properly.
---
It's 0.2% of couples using that as their only birth control method who still get pregnant *per year*.
---
It doesn't account for the amount of sex they're having though since it's an average of a very large number of people.
---
Yep that's the issue when something gets abused; Reddit went from being a last shot for people who actually had strange issues with their account to find out what happened, to a go to for everybody that got correctly banned as a first and only attempt before they sigh and buy their next account (very much helped on by the community looking for every excuse to shit on Jagex buying in to each one). It's therefore become a massive waste of time for them to look into each one, as 99+% are correct, which unfortunately ruins it for the few people that used to use it genuinely for answers.
---
7, 05 bucks???? What is that sorcery

Nah I reckon you got tbed and lost ur dds

neat

Last time I tried to join a learner raid with 5kc my almost 100M setup was too poor to learn it :(
---
As someone who hates wildy / risk pvp; I love Clan Wars. Castle Wars takes too long and has an arbitrary goal to work towards. Duel Arena is too personal and takes too long to find a non-stake fight. House parties combat ring is usually short lived. I'm pretty sure Clan Wars FFA in world 2 is the only way you can go to town on anyone without suffering any of these issues and that's why it's rather active round the clock. So I'd say yes people do give a shit about Clan Wars. They shouldn't add a Clan Wars world however as it would split the community of Clan Wars players up even further.
---
Want
---
Well that backfired...
---
I wonder if this will have some impacts on skulltrickers, sure hope so
---
Runners weren't a thing because people didn't pay well enough. We reached a point were 2m/h is great for noobs but some people can make 10m/h at tob. Which means paying for runners was viable.
---
Just read the thread, cheers for comedy gold this morning
---
That'd be a good balance, it could also make splashing a little more effective if it works that way. I think it should probably have some form of charge on it like burnt pages for the tome of fire, as it seems like a pretty high tier item.
---
EHP nerds are like that mosquito bite that keeps itching until you scratch it. They're mostly NEETs who have nothing else going on in their lives and so they clutch to their "efficiency" as a way to feel superior to others and deal with their lack of everything else.
---
As somebody who once cared for game integrity I have to say being poor didn't affect my views on ZMI Running. It's due to the nature of what running does or can be equivalent to. Can't afford the GP ? Got money IRL? Then get a 24/7 hand trained service done at more than likely fraction of the cost. This is against game rules but because of the similarities between the two, it might as well be allowed. Why do I think that you might ask? 
---
If I spend 4 hours a day playing to get 4 EHP.... I could hire a few runners to double that in the same time. Or... Pay for 6 power levelers all with the ability to perfectly train at the rates described and not have to do anything
---
Accurate
---
I started playing osrs in 2013, and I enjoy every update they've made to date. If the game wasn't getting updates it would've quickly died off or just kept a small portion of players similar to classic. Osrs is the most unique game I've ever come across in terms of polling updates and I think it's done it a lot of justice
---

---
hosters are not typical farmers
---
The Conservative player base has been great for the game, you might have missed out on some updates you thought where good, but filtering out so many shitty updates have been greatly benficial for the longevity of the game.
---
looks like someone died in the pvp zone, how unfortunate
---
anyone know if there is a spreadsheet for ds2 speedrun like there is for bgloves? 
---
i remember seeing one a few months ago but cant seem to find it.
---
Every underground rapper has played runescape it seems. Thats thight
---
Ok
---
Void 100% whenever stackable with Salve.
---
I'm not sure why you think that? Maybe you were looking at the wrong runes? A law rune costs about 200gp, whereas a charged glory costs about 12k gp, so teleporting to house is much much cheaper. Plus, convenience. Most people have the runes for house tele in their inventory at all times anyway, so saves a spot
---
 so 60% of preggnancies if you smack on the daily and blast FAT nuts all up in those and. Not worry like me
---
The meta is now set between Astral running and solo lavas.
---
Rest of them are not dead either. They are just bots
---
Yessss
---
Save slots and perhaps the ability to restore all stats, then have one available immediately for a teleport.
---
Nah. You can help out others. It's easier to help out others for the Hero's quest.
---
Weird, I tried using my main to help my alt and it wouldn’t let me.
---
how can you put it on the wrong side though, it just won't unroll
---
You pinch the bubble at the top before putting it on, otherwise there is risk of the air pressure inside the condom tearing/breaking.
---
idk he might enjoy it cause it would lead to a massive decline in new updates since everything would take more than twice as long to make.
---
ok you're right that was pretty lame, and the whole wilderness volcano thing was dumb as hell too. you've convinced me
---
My right hand fervently disagrees
---
That would work, but Barb fishing has a special mechanic not allowing you to 2t.
---
This isn't a court of law so dude was guilty.
---
Pretty much
---
Swampletics is a guy who made an ultimate ironman (cant trade or use a bank) and has restricted himself to only being in Morytania, with the eventual goal of completing the Theatre of Blood. $11 and crab memes refer to the price of membership and an april fools video called 'crab rave'. A chad is something people ironically call players that wear 'inefficient' gear, like full granite or something.
---
They nerfed zmi as it was promised to only be about 50k-60k xp/hr and not 150k. Lava runes have always been in the game, and was not polled at a given premise.
---
EHP will never be 250k xp/hr anyways.
---
Thank you :)
---
They are boring as fuck and they give so little. Hell no am i interupting my important business to do them, I can barley be assed to do farming fucking rs3 shit skill magic saplings all day you feel me?
---
I know the difference, no worries, but thanks for the concern :)
---
And if you got hacked you would still want jagex to recover your account
---
Holding or wearing?
---
Oldschool runescape is becoming the game that post-2007 was meant to be. That's why it appeals to many players. It's like a do-over for Jagex.
---
No fun? Using Vulcanic mine to suicide is now the meta, and I love to get free inventory spaces, probably the best feeling ever
---
Oof
---
I've come to arrest you, OP!
---
I can see you have not paid your child support
---
Eh, not too obsessed with the upvotes
---
30 people saw it and liked it, that’s kinda cool
---
Lol last time I got killed at chaos alter I had just unnoted my last 14 bones, enjoy the 30k, Chad.
---
Although 85 range will enable you to get in a few extra hits on Jad, the problem normally lies with your prayer flicking capabilities (for most players). There are people who've killed Jad with 75 range without a struggle.
---
No.  At this point it’s all about keeping calm and getting the mechanics down.  An extra 5 levels might make it go a little faster, but if you don’t have the mechanics down you’ll still be toast
---
Legit confused as to why this has so so many awards given to it considering its a useless question post? Seems like a "laptops, am i right?" Kinda joke
---
He's like the Mysterious Old Man's long lost brother
---
Seems very pointless to me, especially if it takes a lot of Dev time, but I don't see why anyone would be mad or upset about it. It's meh
---
RIP
---
Main reason is not buying gold, it’s not securing your account properly....
---
You can also complete lost city for the dragon dagger and monkey madness for the dragon scimitar. Train your att and strength to 65, enter the warrior's guild and go for the dragon def.
---
I had 7 spawn in my inventory this morning, does that count?

You could look at release dates and do them that way.  You could also try go through each “quest series”.

Having children is a beautiful thing . Makes god proud.
---
I need to do this
---
Sneaky flex, I like that
---
That is of course an option, but really doesn't cover me for the entire year, which was my point
---
Imps and goblins drop easy,
---
Pyrefriends drop meds
---
Bloods and mages drop hard. I try to kill these right here as they are the easiest and also will agro other monsters so you can safe spot them
---
Yea but I'm talking about the advertisers that are just constantly spamming their coresponding host, and the ones that make fake bots to try and sabotage other hosts. Even some of the host on w330 talk about how you should only have one advertiser and not an army of spamming bots.
---
Last time I checked alternative and mainstream were mutually exclusive too. Would you look at that.
---
Its called having a brain.
---
You can spec.. just not from the orb.. you have to use the.. place where you change combat styles
---
Yeah, which is why we shouldn't add useless hitsplats
---
Did you just reply to yourself?
---
Listen, I enjoy brainlet pker memes just as much as most of this subreddit. That being said, you know what the wilderness is designed for, so don't cry when you get killed.
---
Imagine having concern for EHP on a main and complaining money is involved
---
Those bots feed my birdhouse runs
---
It's ok pkers can't spell either /s
---
Agreed, who the fuck will pay 3x the price for gold, just for morals and ethics? Hell paying for my membership is already supporting Jagex 😂
---
big no. This probably helped keep me sane.
---
What do you mean by conservative with what pass the polls. Almost everything passes.
---
You can alch at the ge and just keep buying more, if you alched something like battlestaves you'll make a small profit but can only buy 20 or so at a time with that stack. Depends if it bothers you having to keep stopping alching to buy more.
---
this is the most effective way for 10hpers that I've found https://youtu.be/mgQNDAEyH6A
---
What? That's actually very good setup
---
Imagine using the imagine meme in 2019
---
Lowest point? Yes. My point is that the NMZ release stopped the insane decline, kept steady for like a year and didn't blow up untill Zulrah &amp; GE.
---
I just rewrote my previous comment but maybe with 2 different words you understand.
---
Trust me, the Cannon would be op af and the cballs would be so expensive that it wouldnt be worth it to use for non rich players just like chins
---
Why? Its a toggle if u want keep the old graphics.
---
The dock in Port Phasmatys
---
Can you give me your opinion on something? I'm actually quite fascinated with your response. 
---
Would you rather someone on the street call you "scum" OR say "hey man" instead of "hey girl". 
---
You explained it's not so bad to be called scum. If that's the case, why is it completely ok for you to call him scum AND defend your case but it's absolutely intolerant for him to call someone else something? 
---
A trend I've noticed with people who defend this whole gender-correct pronoun movement is that they're totally OK with insulting people but good forbid you call them the wrong pronoun. Sort of silly, don't you agree?
---
Pvm powercreep good
---
Skilling bad
---
might get some mort myre funghi drops though
---
ye but if you're actually good at pvp and pvm, you'll never have to buy gp, because gp will float in like candy.
---
Wielding?
---
If that's your goal take a blowpipe. Venom is absolute cancer and very few people bring anti-venom.
---
apparently bgs wasnt good enough instead of BGS and dragon cross instead or acb or DHC *shrug*  (note I've done a learner raid with under 5m setup) and normal void vs elite void wasn't enough (and yes, I had 5 KC before this learner raid)
---
Wtf
---
Waste of dev time
---
Kudos, I couldn't even attempt this
---
This thread has made me reconsider how I choose a host.  I think next time I'll look for the host with only one advertiser hiding amongst the crowd ..
---
What's so funny?
---
but you need the toxic chinachemicals from the crocs to destroy your sperms
---
That's an opinion, brother.
---
Gotta start healing for the good karma drops, closing in on 300kc with only 3 torches and 3 gloves
---
That’s a meat tenderizer.. very different
---
Same guy who takes you across normally, you can ask him for a special deal or something
---
Poe's law isn't just a Reddit thing
---
Not a big fan of the "lewd" art in general, but the shading on this is spectacular. Well done.
---
Why there?  They're not dead content really, they're used for getting keys. We're still considering the whole warding thing which is more fitting than randomly dropping imbues from gwd.
---
Ti you maybe but if the community passes it years down the line it wouldnt be. So ye. Toggleable shouldnt bother u.
---
Did u also hate gwd zulrah ge raids and inferno im guessing?
---
i would burn out at about 70 fm lmao
---
Not in the wildy, just the regular god wars.
---
Username does not check out
---
is this a crossover episode???
---
You have 100m setup but can't afford dragon crossbow? Also I doubt anyone wouldn't accept somebody to learner raids because they used rune crossbow
---
Are you funding this with a main?
---
Absolute mad man. I love it.
---
It's actually up now for $25 with some other goodies
---
Be as efficient as possible for all I care, but don't fuck other people over in the process. ZMI altar nerf was only because of the vocal minority crying for months to Jagex about how unfair it is and how EHP nerds are "forced" to adapt the expensive training methods to stay competetive.
---
that aint the right font dawg
---
Yes it is!
---
HD looks ass
---
More than likely he funded if from 200M smithing
---
More like less than 10%... Newsflash being sad and in your 20s doesn't mean you have depression
---
Close it and talk to the guy, you've already done it :)
---
Is this accurate? I convinced myself not to touch raids until I have Trident/blowpipe/whip
---
Dungeoneering was without a doubt my most hated thing added to RS. I would absolutely vote no.
---
99 RC + Agil shortcut that takes you from +30 wild to GE sounds well balanced
---
Crazy to me that some people look at 99 as a bump in the road to 200m lol
---
I just recently finished frem elite so now im gonna reee
---
I really want to get into raids, haven't really watched any guides or anything. I've heard that it's very hard to learn, dungeoneering was pretty straight forward.
---
1: file a report to the police not reddit.
---
2: call the police of the old place u live in inform them about the situation and say you filed a report
---
The last thing you want is that ape actually leaking your nudes and proceed to swat your old place.

As the other guy said. Waves 1-10 in under 15 minutes. Most w306 teams with randoms tend to run 40-50 minutes for 10 waves.

Yeah it's really high level content, people recommend 90+ stats

shout out Sean Ranklin

yeah but if you were a noob doing it for the first time, you wouldn't think to
---
I would guess it’s probably similar money.  I’ve only done about 300 fanatic and 100 ele but fanatic you’ll have a cannon so you’ll be losing some money on cannonballs.  Also, it’s drops are pretty shitty besides the shield pieces.  
---
For ele, it’s drops are also trash, it’s drop table is carried by the d pick, kinda like Abby demons and the whip
---
Overall both are pretty bad money makers and you should only camp either if you’re pet hunting.

I know it depends on price fluctuations, but what's a decent way to level up herblore without burning my bank? I think prayer pots were pretty decent gp/xp, IIRC?
---
I have done all of the above before writing this story. I have also submitted a report to cyber crimes
---
Thank you for saying what I was going to say
---
Nmz isn't dead content. In fact it's too op for afk training plus rewards.
---
I think spiritual creatures are dead content.

Wines because it only deals 1 damage at a time

WT damage actually scales with hp level.  It's easier to do with lower hp.
---
The damage scales to how high your hp level is so doing it at a low HP level is actually the meta

I'd vote No so fast on this shit.
---
U take less damage the lower hp u are, with full gear and 10hp + decent fm u take 1 damage max
---
Thank you guys. I'm an idiot. I was not aware that I needed to talk to the npc after completing the puzzle, as this is my first puzzle box thus far. Thanks for the assistance...
---
Damage is scaled to the players max health.  
---
If you have 10HP WT will only hit you for 1s &amp; 2s, so pretty easy to not die there.
---
What are you?
---
Stats wise I think I could do raids easily. it came out at a time I took a long break, so I don't really know much about it. Is it easy to find people to do raids with, And is the loot fairly being splitted?
---
LOL
---
Trade limit? Eoc?
---
everyone has autochat turned off
---
Niceeeeee
---
Do slayer next
---
Something tells me a 3rd party client could allow non-equipment to work with this. It would be super super easyscape if so, banking is part of skilling.
---
Their defense isn't any higher in hard. They have more HP and hit harder which doesn't matter because you're a pure and using rock cake I assume to stay at 1 HP? More HP means a lot less downtime switching targets = more XP.
---
v nice
---
&gt;Dungeoneering was without a doubt my most hated thing added to RS
---
I couldn't bare to kill this creature again.
---
Ok that's adorable
---
is there any other way, instead of typing it out?
---
Garden pies to boost for trees
---
Idk how hard it is to find teammates. I hear of people being scammed all the time from people not splitting their drops. When I finally do raids I'll probably just do solo loot, unless I can trust the people I raid with.
---
Upvoted by a poh host: " Johno R", I am having to use 3 ads or more because kids keep adding more and more its a piss take even from a poh host point of view jagex sort it out.

Unless you end up with brutal blue dragons in Korend dungeon like me and it takes a week to get the motivation to finish the task.

well, this is not encouraging :(

You can minigame teleport to Shades of Morton, its a place in south in Morytania

That's how a Pking clan would type it anyways, 100% accurate

---
Dungeoneering wouldn't succeed as a skill. I don't think i will succeed as a minigame either. We have raids for this. I think we will get a lot of such generated dungeon-styled content in the future, but not dungeoneering even though it seems like a large portion of the community wants it. I feel like thats just a more or less vocal minority.
---
It would be about 500m gp if that was all he did from 99 to 200m.
---
Less than half the xp/hr of blast furnace gold, tho.

Guess some youtubers dont understand that some people watch only one of their series, and dont care for their other videos..

I'll probably get crucified for saying this but it would be really nice to only have to hit 1 or 2 buttons in my bank to auto-gear for pvp. I'm pretty sure the pvp community would be happy to make regearing up less tedious. Also, yes, I fight other pkers. I don't want your fucking spade and firelighters.
---
So many youtubers have done series where they have like 2-5 hours to start gathering gear from scratch. Then they like trio a scaled raid with dscims and shit. Chambers is pretty easy once you learn it especially with scouting.
---
Pretty positive my point went over your head, adding features like this wouldn’t deter new players specially on mobile
---
To afk train in NMZ you don't need all of the bosses. Just do a normal rumble with count draynor, king roald, sand snake, the kendal, and trapped soul.
---
You only need the bosses if you're going for points (which it sounds like you don't care about).
---
Get enough points using prayer pots to buy some absorbs and then you're all set.
---
Otherwise there's sand + ammonite crabs.

Bandit camp in the desert was what people did before nmz.

Trident/bp/whip is a good place gearwise to not be a complete leech and will make it easy to find learner raids
---
You can raid in ironscape’s learners with that and 78 herblore, elite void, bp not needed
---
you CAN do it at 75 combats. but honestly to lessen the amount of hairs you will pull out of your head id suggest 90+ combats. and 78 herb is a must.
---
Do it in a different world! We can't show up because none of us are 1500 total level!

Why do we need horses in RS3? Running isn't an issue and surge exists anyways.

Anyone else find it weird how people use the phrase “dog shit” all the time in the Runescape community but you don’t really see it anywhere else?
---
Dude are you fucking kidding me. You’re an absolute maniac. 
---
I love it.
---
since theyll both come back with empty invents, your probably getting less if no loot at all.
---
I think that proves the point
---
IMO it's probably because jagex have to focus on the game as a whole, or at least a broader set of aspects outside of just bot-countering at once, whereas coders tend to have communities where they share certain pieces of information to better bypass changes when they're discovered. The anti-bot members of jagex will not have the combined autism to out-tism the people who make the bots.
---
As mentioned above, it's a great weapon to have. I'd retain a rune cbow with some broad bolts or an msbi if you need to use range on something that isn't profitable though. All depends on your cash flow.

"in F2P"
---
F2p is intentionally not as convenient/good/enjoyable/etc as members. That's the whole point, there needs to be incentive for people to buy members.
---
"serious problem"
---
It's not a 'serious problem'. It's a minor inconvenience.
---
"there's a lot of walking in Runescape"
---
Not in f2p. F2p is relatively small to begin with, there aren't many quests, and teleports get you to most the important areas. And the only f2p skill that requires more than 100 run at a time is RC (which sucks even with 99 agility). 
---
"it can be very overwhelming for new players to have to walk every where they go"
---
Overwhelming isn't the word you are looking for, so I'm not sure what you mean to say. Overwhelming is too many skills to figure out. Overwhelming is moving too quickly to too many different new areas without stopping for time to learn them. Having less run energy being 'overwhelming' literally doesn't make sense.
---
"Making agility a F2P skill would be an effective way to solve that issue"
---
'It's an issue that agility isn't f2p' -&gt; 'making agility f2p would solve this issue'. That's begging the question. 
---
'involve players in a new skill'
---
Involve [f2p] players in a [members] skill. You can ride that slippery slope all the way down to making everything in the game f2p. 
---
Anyway, if you are doing something that consistently uses more than 100 run energy, bring an axe and chop some trees while you wait for your run energy back.
---

dragon crossbow is garbage for what it is, gets a +1 range bonus and a shitty spec compared to the rune crossbow, btw you’ll have to spend gp on zulrah scales which can be quite pricey so keep that in mind.

Why isn't Wildy slayer good GP/HR? As someone with base 70s stats that has low farming and hunter, I can't think of a single method that matches the income of Wildy slayer besides maybe getting cor blimey'd a bunch of times. Konar's keys and mysterious emblems drop at about the same rate, and mysterious emblems are worth like 175K while Konar's keys usually only yield me like 30-40K.
---
That's sad to think about :( so many noobs
---
but the blowpipe is fucking amazing, i use it for just about every slayer task

My laptop is fairly new. Made in 2017 or something. 7th gen i5 and a HD620. Still tanks to 3 fps.

People used to wear Guthans and go afk, it's not the best way to train, but before nmz it was pretty easy/convenient. With nmz though whats the point? Cause you can do the same thing and get points that can be used.

Perhaps true. Regardless, the whole idea of the thread- that if smithing costs 500m and he made less than 500m it wasn't worth- is hilarious and untrue.

Botting is a problem that I don't think will ever go away. They literally have bots for everything from account creation, to tutorial island, to really obscure yet lucrative gold farming methods.
---
Whenever jagex break the bot clients they will have it up and running again in no time, and for every account they ban there's another waiting to replace it. It's just a never ending cycle.
---
Your lucky to be fair. Think about it, could have happened to you with a lot more money and would have made it far worse. At least it won’t happen to you again. 
---
Put it this way, I wish I had only lost 3m the first time I got scammed 😂😂
---
I very greatly appreciate you!
---
This is beautiful
---
Well said. Pretending that these people don't have a mental disorder makes it worse for everyone.
---
I can't understand how people changes that let them interact with the game as little as possible. If you don't like playing the game, find another one. Don't just change it so the game plays itself.
---
fuck yeah
---
ok stop, this isn't healthy lol
---
I transitioned mine to a zerker/void pure through questing. The amount of content unlocked was worth the extra combat levels.
---
All it takes is 1 discussion about prayer flicking and 90% of people jump right on the train of showing just how little they actually understand about the game.
---
Exactly
---
I'd be fine with gear presets as long as it didn't do the inventory as well. The main issue with the old presets was they could be used to speed up a skilling a fair amount by quickly resetting inventory. That said, something like an official tag system would work pretty similarly for quickly finding your equipment for a certain activity.
---
Hmm. I suppose so. Maybe I'm just a gate keeping asshole. The two seem different, but it honestly isn't

Hey man, I appreciate that, however I haven't attempted to host in some time. I've tried a few different methods, none of which had any success; It's just not worth attempting as my time could be spent doing other things for similar profit.

They need a system like the raid boards, with an NPC that shouts out the people who've signed up to host.

On the contrary. He got less purples than he should have got, and the purples he got were mostly the inexpensive ones.

Has it gone live? I haven't done any group stuff so I'm not sure but I thought this was just something that was proposed and in development. Ash definitely said it was a toggled option in the twitter feed so if it's live, it's there somewhere.

Unlucky
---
All i'm saying is that 'human scum' coming from someone who sees himself as a tolerant person is pretty ironic. Do what you want, but i won't pretend that people who want to chop their dick off are mentally healthy or stable.

How long did this skill alone take you??

You know mate, you could shut the fuck up n accept it cuz the damage is already done.
---
It is coming just wait for it!
---
I feel like this might be a slippery slope, but as long as they stay firm on not speeding up skilling, 11/10
---
dead wrong here. apparently they can get a shit ton of GP/H in the form of player donations, it's why there are so many bots, its the best way to afk farm for gold.
---
I'm off work today, just got to go get groceries then I'm going to grind out pest control for the next 7 hours then some slayer

Yeah I only did once during the 6 months we were together, and even with the condom it made me nervous. Felt amazing though, I can see how accidents happen.

turns out it be like \~2% yield extra IF you get the roll. i just assumed it would increase base yield which it doesn't.

But Attas unlike you spam clicking herbs actually has an impact on potential increased yield.

The only difference is how they’re used and one has hydrochloride salt mixed with it. So yes they are the same.

Been doing nothing but slayer for the past few days, trying to get the brittle key from gargoyles. Only 1 task so far, 246 kills, no key...
---
80% chance I should've gotten it by now, by my math
---
No, but I was offended. Learn to be a decent human or go back to the shithole /b/ if you're going to talk to others here like that. No need for toxic language.
---
Just realized you're a different person.  Regardless this applies to anyone.
---
There are actual bot clients out there that are capable of exactly the same thing and both are subject to the exact same same bot detection systems. If there is a problem with bots not being banned it's not runelite, it's Jagex's bot detection.
---
It is true when you look at how much xp you need, but it’s different when you consider xp rates. I mean, it’s still pretty ridiculous, but just slightly less than it seems
---
Smithing at blast furnace so mining isn't required.

---
Yeah, you've got the HCIM flair. We know already.
---
An items value doesn’t only come from its rarity. People have to want to buy the item. Something like that is only good for fashionscape and people may not like how it looks. 
---
PLUS since it does have a low price right now, because there’s no way for its “uses” to increase, the price will likely stay low since nobody wants to show off a 2m item.
---
Edit: and for merching, people have to want to buy at your higher price for it to actually work. Nothing guaranteed.
---
What do you recommend ? Probly doing RFD huh ?
---
People like cosmetics that look cool like the Ankou outfit.

Crank that runelite GPU to 8x aliasing and max out the draw distance. Then have like 20 chrome tabs open. yee haw

Only buy a dcb if you are doing content where you need dragon bolts.

How does he have pyro without woodcutting xp? I might be missing something but wouldnt he have like 99 woodcutting too? I dont play much so i have no clue

I don't like NMZ personally, but it doesn't take that long to grind out the points for the imbues and then you really don't have to go back ever if you don't want.

Hey I commissioned this! Thank you for putting up with all my revisions :D

Wildy slayer isnt great GP because the emblem drops are really the only valuable part of a lot of the tasks. Unless you get Revs/Spiders(and do Venn)/Bears and do Callisto/Lava Dragons etc. most of the tasks youre getting have virtually no loot that drops. You can do a black demon task that takes 30-60 min (I mean I usually cannon basically everything for wildy slayer though anyway so more like 20-30 min) and get a few emblem drops. So what? Really the best way to make money with Wildy slay outside of those Boss Tasks is to hope you get a lot of really easy tasks you can do quickly so you can get as many kills per hour which means youll get the most emblems per hour as well. Even then though, if you get some easy tasks and say you get really lucky, doubtful youre going to get more than 4-5 emblems and theres no way youll be maintaining getting 4-5/hour unless youre using a cannon most likely. 
---
A lot of the tasks arent great Xp/hr either, which is why I say most people only do Wildy Slayer if they need points because thats really whats it good for. Regular slayer is both WAY more profitable and way better XP and you can obviously do it in max gear since its not in the wilderness. Unless they make the keys really, really profitable (like at least 3-5x more valuable than Konar drops) people may do it at first because its a new thing but if the Keys are more like konars most people will just go back to doing regular slayer because it just wouldnt be worth doing unless they need points.
---
Im willing to bet the number of people grinding 200m exp with those qualifications is more or less 0
---
Think we used to be friends. You remember Saidin Rage?
---
On the plus side for him, if OSRS ever fizzles out he can either move on as a developer, or claim 20 years working with special needs children and work in that field.
---
I've played osrs since day 1, but no im not a game dev.
---
What exactly am I supposed to learn about the game?  Nmz isn't popular for it's imbues, it's just better because of the imbues and gp rewards.  
---
Osrs has taken on a direction of balancing gp/hr, xp/hr and clicks/hr (afkness) but NMZ strangely has 2/3 of those at basically the best rates (xp and clicks) while also not being costly (rather it is actually slightly profitable AND is required to unlock BIS equipment).  Without NMZ you'd have to choose between raw AFK (prayer/guthans) or risk (slightly better xp and some gp, killing elder chaos druids with vig mace).
---
it's pretty common to see skills have 3+ viable methods and they're usually a balance of those 3 things.

I don’t think that’s accurate. People write custom scripts for bots all the time that will get by if the author knows what they’re doing. Huge amounts of scripts in pvp for example. 
---
They really can’t do something like that in runelite without defeating the purpose of it being open source.

I'm probably never touching rc after level 86, and I think 86 agility unlocks all the agility shortcuts, so probably not going past that either.
---
Rs3 has removed the runes from monster drop table and it really didnt help anything.
---
50% of the time
---
That's just blatantly false. If clients did report information about the type of client it is, that information could easily be faked seeing as how it is originating from the client.
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
Jesus... That would literally take years
---
God that was one of my favorite updates when I started playing RS3 again in like 2014 for a few months. I wish it would come here but I know people would not vote for it, even though it was amazingly convenient and saved so many people from carpal tunnel.

Bro I’ve been playing for like 3 years and just hit 200m total XP you’re a madman
---
You better load up on the red bull, adderall, and last but never least, a bunch of crack.
---
You forgot to blur out your rsn from the drops lad
---
That’s just...not true lol. Berserker is MANDATORY for training with obsidian. It’s the entire point of the set. Barrows gives a max hit or two which is great, but not even close to zerker neck.
---
RS3?
---
Still the best affordable (relative to the ones mentioned below) for training attack or defense, or just bossing.
---
we need swiftkit back

why

Intuitive thinking, brave rice.

Can only do it because of the awesome people that support me and love RuneScape 🙂

This is the real johno r right here, I am hosting in world 330 now, I am going to tell everyone in my house to use the built in auto chat and spam a spammer outside to try get people to use it, I am going to try advertise myself that way for a bit to see what i can do.
---
yikes nothing gets through to that guy lol
---
I’d wait til after the Crystal Sword crashes Rapier
---
How long have you been at this account OP? Huge kudos , you’re crazy.
---
whenever i see the pyro say “i think im dying” i always just imagine hes having a bad trip
---
we have a saying in wow, you get the loot you deserve.
---
You got my upvote
---
It’s a very tiny mountain compared to what it used to be before wintertodt was added. Also I have no idea how to spell that
---
Dang, that’s unfortunate. Can you try appealing again? Mine literally happened within a week. Possibly I was just lucky, Hope it works out for you eventually.
---
Go stake for me
---
So the trick here would be to run directly north, then east, then get Rex in the safespot?
---
&gt;Alternatively just have a friend/ alt kill prime+supreme while you set up.
---
You chose the words that would hurt me most, [didn't you](http://i.imgur.com/W2yS2p5.jpg)?

---
DAMN. I literally came here for this
---
Right on man glad you got it sorted
---
What?
---
If there are two people on an account for example, and one person did the inferno, would a ban be imposed?
---
I'm pushing for 99 smithing and i've just hit 94. I'm thinking of doing gold bars from 95-99 but thats gonna require me to build up quite a hefty cash stack (\~30-35m) to do so. With my meager 7m that i'm currently sat on I'm not quite there yet
---
What are some fun ways for me to make bank while keeping things fresh so I dont get burnt out? My stats are [here](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal.ws?user1=ryytikki) and I'm willing to train so long as its not more than a couple of hours. I'm currently trying to get lucky with barrows but thats not doing so well for me yet
---
Kinda goes against rs though really. I think the whole point is you arent stuffed into a bracket like most mmos.
---
I believe modifying a preset would need to cost money aswell since that would be the main issue with making skilling faster. 
---
Having 28 ranarr turned to 14 vial of water and 14 clean ranarr is where the xp rates go a bit higher =P
---
Are there any ranked ladders in OSRS? anything that makes it competitive? Or is leveling the main driver?
---

Where's the combat brace dude?
---
Cor blimey mate!
---
Me please kind person
---
Not that hard and yes its doable.  Keep on protect from melee, and switch prayers to mage/range accordingly, then default back to protect from melee until you see the next animation.  The melee hit doesn't have an animation, and if you're nervous it could make it a bit harder if you aren't experienced
---
But he play gatar.
---
There is a clause in the Krabby Patty manual thing that all employees (Mr. Krabs follows along I believe) is legally bound to NEVER recall the formula from memory, take note of it, an audio recording, photography, or any form of media that could endanger its secrecy. He almost certainly does not remember it since he REALLY doesn't care about it.
---
Please stop deleting/reposting this suggestion, this is the 4th or 5th time today.
---
I feel you. I kind of think of it as ANOTHER creative way to play the game. Think of it as another way to play, not a limitation.
---
I do believe stamina pots to be alot stronger but they have a cost and use an inventory slot so in term of pleasing the playerbase it did better. The issue most people have is when the QOL is free of charge and can be 100% combined to already existing method.
---
Example lodestone with their 30 second teleport animation while also teleporting further away then a classic tele spell. 
---
People don't want that yet theyre fine with POH.
---
I guess because it requires a good construction level and a certain amount of money.
---
Basically osrs QOL is stronger with a cost and thats okay with the playerbase...
---
Just copy paste
---
Seriously no one is impressed.
---
I think the idea would be cool,
---
Yeah but you should be using the Slayer bracelets instead
---
Eh. Not exactly new drama, we’ve known that bug for years and we’ve known it would end an HCIM status eventually. Not exactly drama calendar-esque
---
The dps upgrade from whip to rapier is not worth selling your whole bank for. Max your other gear before you make that upgrade
---
But why create categories when we already have names for different designs? I'm not saying they're wrong, I just can't think of an example where just using dagger etc. wouldn't work
---
Not even an Ironman
---
yikes, pretending to care for a stranger to make yourself feel better?
---
Unrelated to the overarching thread, but I think birdhouses are the best answer. They're quick in terms of a gameplay clock, but not an actual clock, they're significantly less profitable than actively training hunter, and they've got a decent quest lock. Basically they're good for the player that has a bunch of short sessions instead of a few long sessions.
---
How do you get smith without mining? Did you transfer funds?
---
These are all so good I love every post you make!
---
You have some real issues dude.
---
Copy and Paste or is there someone named paste?
---
First I'm hearing about it. You could make me say wtf by completing it.
---
Exactly right. People who make posts (also prominent in unsolicited review sites) tend to heavily skew towards either highly positive or highly negative feedback extremes.  
---
  
---
Why would a person make a post on Reddit about a successful “working as intended” function? Easy. They wouldn’t.    
---
I think I made a post back when I wanted to start playing again about how my account was banned. Questioning what could have happened.  Eventually I found the appeal process and submitted.  I don’t believe I ever went back and confirmed that it worked, so there was only a perceivably negative post “unfair ban!”that I made, without the positive resolution.   
---
I’m sure many others are the same. It’s a negative feedback loop where the only experiences (or at least mostly) are negative complaints about Jagex.  It becomes an echo chamber and it’s one of the chief complaints that people have with Reddit.  Once something becomes the norm, it’s hard to change the group’s opinion.
---
Application would be tough tho, I’m not even sure how this could be done without a whitelisted world where people are assigned roles. Otherwise it turns into a shit show.
---
Its f2p bruh, everything is bad money
---
LOL my bad. Yep, pretty much, I'm forgetting which way is which in the DK cave but north then east sounds right. Just stay as far away from prime/supreme as possible.
---
I can only imagine it being easier on keyboard??
---
I’m happy you have been enjoying them!
---
It depends. The account belongs to one of the players (whoever created the account) if that player does the inferno there shouldn't be an issue. If the other player did inferno they account would be issued a 2 week ban and the cape would be removed. If the player who did inferno (and didn't create the account) had any other rs accounts, you would be perm banned. However, if 2 people regularly shared the account (exceptially if they lived close together) the chance of being caught is very slim.
---
What do the players spamming they are spending money try to buy (ie someone wanted to show me 69M and asked if I have something to sell) ? Is the idea to try to flick the price for a scam?
---
It's weird how much energy people put to begging and scamming. Guess it's fun for them.
---
Where my manchester brothers @?
---
Quality
---
I legit LOLed at this 😂😂😂
---
You can buy those seeds from the lady in the farming guild for 1gp each, fyi in case the prices ever go up again like they did a while ago. (You can buy them in draynor too, but that was always bought out because it was good money for noobs)
---
Sure, I think I still have some left from my 1-30 rc grind
---
Yeah where you can pick a certain job, then people vote to have a king. Would love to see opposing factions invading varrok, falador etc with people defending the city and another invading while killing civilians like the farmers and merchant players lol we can dream though
---
That's why you gave up..
---
You got 200m in one skill just to fail on the second?  I don't think you created the account for "shock value", you're just a quitter.
---
Just make it take ~5s to complete the whole action of banking everything, withdrawing, and equipping. It'll still be too slow for skilling (now that we have mobile banking buttons that shit is stupidly easy and fast), but it'd be perfect for pvm, birdhouses, farming, clues, pking, etc.
---
If 5s is still too short, make it take a little longer. The number can be tweaked. I know how to navigate the bank interface, but that doesn't mean it isn't boring as shit.
---
Haven't tried Dharok myself. All my melees are in 80s + 86hp.
---
Dharok is the way to go if you are using overloads, hard nmz, and babysitting it much more. I think the recommendation is 90+HP and Strength before using it as well. My set up is mainly for least amount of interaction and still good results.
---
What monsters can I kill at medium level (every cb skill is around 55) for some decent profit whilst also training my combat skills. I'd like spicen up my bank since whilst training combat since i accidentally lost my 4m cash stack.

Hm, what's your average xp per hour using the obby method?

Did a full void set over a week or so on intermediate. Often enough we’d pick up a guy who would just complain endlessly about everyone else. Usually during and right after the occasional loss.

The # contradicts itself

I'm guessing NYTimes has a search function for all their archived crosswords.

&gt;I have also played since 2005 so you're incorrect lol.
---
Then I think you were being unduly dramatic with your original comment. 
---
As far as new content goes, I would welcome it gladly. But SC, FoG, SW etc were fun to play (minigame that incorporates Slayer? It's like a wet dream for this community) as well as rewarding. 
---
They'll say they don't have the code for the old minigames (idiotic to begin with, but fine).
---
Yet even then, recreating them from memory would be easier than the trial and error of designing an entirely new minigame.
---
DAE think RoT bad man?!?! RoT lichurally killed my whole town!!!

I've got a **master clue** in my bank, and also got an **elite clue.** If I give the elite to Watson, will he take it? And if so - will I have a chance to get another elite clue (from loot or whatever)?

Each passing day you get less players and more mtx, and less updates. I'd call that declining.

Same! Sometimes I run around and pretend to be some wizard and ask noobs to follow me on a quest and give them some GP when they perform a certain task.

Basically all of them can, but the chance is astronomically low.

no, thats a mistake thats been there for a long time.

I just had this happen to me with Torag except I had two of him in the same room beating me with 4 hammers. I was just hiding behind shield wondering which one to kill.

Thank you for your words and reassurance. No I had no bank pin but now I've changed my password, got an authenticator, and a bank pin in place so nobody fucks with my account again. I guess I'll try just afk magic-splashing in lumbridge till I can High Alch... I have about 200k left which, is nothing compared to the original cash stack but better then nothing.

It's sweaty cause you're only focusing on max e/hp while some people don't care about that and just wanna slay for fun

For each barrows item assuming you kill all 6 brothers it's a 1 in 102 chance if you only kill 1 brother it's a 1 in 392 chance. So if you can do a 1 run kill 4 times faster than a 6 run kill it is more efficient.
---
Private servers are modified versions of the game with no association to Jagex.
---
Assembler v cute gj
---
It's not bad at kurasks/turoths too, as you can't make use of other spec weapons there anyway.
---
Probably not the worst thing for gargs as well, as speccing them with dds/claws is a little overkill.
---
iirc, DWH is better because its always a 30% reduction whereas BGS is based on your damage. So if you hit one DWH spec its equivalent to hitting a 64 with the BGS, which is pretty unlikely. So you're a bit more likely to hit with the BGS, but you're likely not going to get as big of a def reduction. 
---
The lack of accuracy IS annoying, but I usually bring a myth's cape and dwarven helmet to try to mitigate this a bit.
---
While I'm sure they're talking about bracelets
---
There are new bis melee gloves called fercious gloves

Hoo ha ha hoo
---
thanks! I added it when I tried to post but when I went to add the description I think it went away.
---
The SGS is one of the most economical items you could ever own. Sara isn’t a super popular boss so the price is very stable, and the sword constantly extends PvM trips and saves money on food and prayer restoration on Slayer tasks and bossing. Sure it has a steep price tag but it’ll always be at around it’s current price.
---
Noice, gotta figure out a good emote to get the booty lookin juicy then
---
What are you talking about? I know trump supporters aren't very bright but did you misread my comment or respond to the wrong guy?
---
i dont think most high profile clans accept 20 def anymore
---
Bruh. I'm talking about the current EHP rate according to CML - The current rates can be found by going to https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/suppliescalc.php and scrolling to the bottom of the page
---
Ah yes. I did think of that but somehow (it’s 5am nearly) it didn’t make it into my post.
---
I think a sjortsword can also do shared xp but it’s not the exact same as spears since the first is attack and second is strength, where spears are just share share share def.
---
Regardless, I’m still 99% sure the rest of the post makes sense.
---
Signal boosting this, as its everything I was going to say
---
Wait till you hear about jebrim
---
Yes! The pet is deemed claimed with probita so the insurance stays in place
---
It's not about ehp, it's just about being slight more efficient with your time?
---
Like this is a game about time commitment, that's literally the only challenge. How is decreaseing the time you need to dump into this game being "sweaty"
---
It's not like he's using barrows gloves then switching to the bracelet the last tick to get your max dps on top of max slayer efficiency. **That** would be sweaty.
---
This is just wearing a different glove slot dude. If you think that's sweaty man idek...
---
Then how are you guilty?
---
I know that, I'm asking what it is basing the given ehp rate on
---
This lvl of virginity is off record

Do you have a link to the stats? I can't find it.
---
It hasn't saved me a single prayer pot during Slayer tasks.
---
Interesting, I'd love to hear the follow-up on this if you get a resolution. Were you playing on mobile or a weird client?
---
Which fletching methods are afk? I was going to do darts, but if I could afk it I'd probably do that instead.
---
Grow up.
---
Mostly doing raids now a days so not a lot of gwd, and wouldn't want to keep an sgs for the few times I do DKS as a slayer task.
---
There's always the chance it could be dead content on arrival, but I'm trying to figure out ways to bring life back to the bow and give the devs more uses for their new feature, besides things like the new potions that recently passed the poll.
---
It's quite sad that the Crystal Bow is in that 70 ranged slot and is often overshadowed by the msb, and miles behind the blowpipe. I feel like it can be smoothed out if the community wanted it to be, and i think the Crystal Bow deserves it.
---
Except there isn't a 3k price difference between an uncharged and charged glory
---
It's a hassle to play the game because you gave your account information away. A lot of the times after clearing your bank they'll try and maintain your account for use of botting or whatever reason. 
---
I would personally start with making sure you have a sufficient adblock on your browser so you can filter malicious OSRS sites. There are thousands of phishing sites, but you should never encounter one with decent cyber security knowledge and blocking out ads.
---
Then make sure your email is good, add authentication, obviously change passwords and security questions. 2 factor on your email is good. And get a bank pin. Unless you enter your bank pin on one of the phishing sites, that would have saved your bank at least.
---
Will do man! Thanks! That helps a lot! Really want to get into raiding I want that t bow!
---
Do people actually bot splashing? You click once and look away for 20 minutes.
---
Came in here wondering that, didn’t wanna hate, but Jesus Christ, why?

cocaine is combined with baking soda and boiled to make crack which is more concentrated than coke, anyone with a basic understanding on chemistry will understand even the smallest changes in a compound can have large impacts.
---
Modified how? I'm not going to use it cause it sketches me out, I was just wondering what the point was.
---
Then get your stats up. A Prayer pot at about 70 Prayer would restore 25ish Prayer. With Piety, a super combat (or attack and strength), and with a good strength level and gear, you can easily spec 50s-60s. A spec of 40 would restore 10 Prayer. You get two specs with a full bar. Hitting two 40s would basically save you a dose. On any Slayer task that is any decent amount of length, an SGS will save you heaps. It’s also amazing for your longevity at bosses like Bandos, Zammy, and DKs, or Gorillas.
---
I agree. I was a noob back when it came out (still am) and I found it so much fun. Raids is nothing like dungeneering because you need to have high stats, be good at the game and have a team for it.  I’m not sure what peoples main objection is to it?
---
I was on Runelite. Once i found out i could attack them clicking on spell--&gt;creature, it let me kill all 6 and the 7th one vanished, and quest was completed.
---
Psa : if u see a girl in initiate, she's got a surprise under her tassy!

More blood rc. Currently at 94, I probably will switch things up before 99, but will definitely get at least 95.
---
Time to play?
---
You do realize It is possible to make original content right? Lmao idiot. That’s what repost means, unoriginal. Good try tho
---
I’ve done 2k+ kc with bp/void and 1k+ with dhcb and a little over 150kc with lance. Just passed 3500 kc recently. So I’ve tried a few things at vork lol 
---
Void+salve+bp+bgs is going to be your best bet starting out. And with this setup I wouldn’t bring any switches that don’t benefit accuracy so void melee helm + firecape +prims + warrior(i) and if you don’t have any of these it’s fine just fill the slot with food. 
---
Upgrading from the void+bp you can go two ways.
---
You can rebuild with rigour or dragon hunter lance. 
---
If you go rigour, you’re just going to stay with the same exact setup as before but the kills will be quicker than before. Rigour will eventually pay for itself as long as your keep farming and is obviously very useful outside of farming vork.
---
Now DHL is the way I’d go with your stats, you’d be able to easily get 4+ kills per trip opposed to the 2-3 kills per trip with the blowpipe setup and that will increase your gp/hr. You don’t need all the bis gear aswell. So you’re fine with a torso, d boots, veracs skirt, b gloves. Once you can upgrade though, I’d suggest doing so. For the head and neck slot Serp helm + salve ammy even on task, the dps boost from slayer + torture is negligible compared to the extra slot for food you save with serp helm. Shield slot is going to be d def over dfs. The ddef gives such better dps over dfs it’s night and day. 
---
Upgrading after you built back your bank with one of these 2 methods can go two ways if you still want to farm vork. 
---
If you bought rigour, go ahead and get a dhcb. You’ll get easily 4+ kill trips, and fall in love with ruby bolt specs. 
---
If you went with DHL then you can keep using the DHL and just upgrade as many bis as you go or get dhcb and rigour to keep farming. It’s really just preference at this point since with high stats like yours you’d be able to easily get 25+ k/h using either method.
---
Are you going to give any sort of exception for quest XP? If not, you'll have to wait for a lot of quests until you're pretty high leveled to make sure you don't gain more than one level from a reward.
---
Arnt agility and fletching and magic all counted as no investment skills and any second training them is 0 ehp
---
So my take is that I remember an influx of items coming into the game selling for ‘low’ in the G.E.
---
The players getting the coinshare drop didn’t care much, however the market would be impacted due to someone snagging a divine for 50m cheaper or in this case a tbow for 80m less. With all the g.e tracking I think if the item sold for low it would be an issue in regards to prices.
---
Solid perspective though man, definitely agree with the tax/money sink viewpoint.
---
Im gonna have to be that guy. Were your attack option hidden for npc?
---
Very weird. Again, would love to hear more once/if you hear back from God Ash. Love this kind of stuff.
---
There is a solution to every problem, if the player base starts to complain enough maybe they will do more. Or maybe not. 🙃 I don’t think we  should be accepting this as our reality because then nothing will ever be done.
---
I have a mother that was physically and mentally abused. She left everything to get out of an abusive relationship to save herself and her kids. Left behind with no income due to being laid off, no where to go, or people to talk to. When you're in a toxic relationship, the last thing you think about is money. You think about yourself and your children before money. As for you saying my comment is dumb, get to know the situation before taking about it. I've been following X for a couple of years now and I know the situation 100x more than you do. You're a puppet that plays OSRS and thinks he has 200 IQ. You're a clown.
---
Posts like these get removed all the time, though the ones that make it to the front page rarely do
---
I honestly don't understand why they added this category bullshit? What is the fucking point honestly? It's wasted dev time and it looks fucking ugly.
---
Unfortunately, as he said, you get literally nothing by going past 99, even if you do manage to get on the front page. So yeah, it takes that to achieve great things in the world, however, going past 99 on osrs isn’t remotely worth it lmao
---
I got mine at around 800kc. I never want to do that grind again.
---
Really? I thought that was all just recently. Crazy he's still at it and insane as ever over 10 years later.
---
Pretty inaccurate meme since they can’t go 90 seconds without telling people they’re an Ironman
---
It’s relative to other games. WoW destroyed itself slowly with quantity over quality in expansions for example, bunch of filler. Plus most things don’t even make it to polling unless they have a reasonable chance to pass
---
I bring it to all slayer tasks pretty much and it restores that pretty commonly unless you barely have the stats to wield it then you are doing something wrong or just don't understand how its restore works. Between Sgs and guthans you can stay at dks for 25/30 kills without pots if you have sgs and that requires constant prayer.
---
Apparently magic secateurs are also stab swords. And here I am using them for farming...

Thanks for telling me whats worth it and what isnt worth it. If going past 99 isnt worth it then im sure 50 isnt worth it either. Life isnt worth it.

Nothing i do in runescape from here on out will make me feel proud.
---
Congrats! If you look on the osrs clan forums, there is a huge list of clans looking for members, some are social focused, some skilling focused, some pvp, some pvm. There are also cc’s that are just a small group of friends like this post, which are always really nice if you’re a casual player 🤗
---
wild pies are very cheap (700 gp ea) and restore 22 hp each (11 per bite), so if you just use 60% inv sharks, 40% inv wild pies, you can easily do cerberus at 87/88 slayer.

Bad! Shame on you!

My anxiety is through the roof right now

Its okay mate I guess I respect your opinion?

Well at least i have something to laugh about with my CC when i get home, who also couldn't figure it out lol

Yeah that’s my fear. Doing it all on mobile too so it’s gay as aids. My plan is to go right through to ds2. As I know if I stop and do something else I will never do anymore.

No, 10hrs a day means no work or school. And point was that you cannot take breaks, with work you at least have usually weekends off
---
Maybe if your stats suck or you aren't using prayer or potions.  If you have 90ish Att/Str and use Piety + super pots, you shouldn't have any trouble consistently healing with it.  I've saved millions in food and potions by using it and don't regret it at all.

Looking for a good money maker so I can finally do this construction grind. I'm base 75 for combat stats. I'm not expecting a crazy profitable method, but a little more than what I make now.
---
What is with the stupid high number of bots there?
---
Or I can just stay here because a vast majority of people don't get upset by getting called names. Sounds like a mental/emotional problem if you actually got upset at that.
---
On the subject of presets, I did a mockup of a bank rework a couple of months ago, if anyone's interested: https://i.imgur.com/skiVZGQ.png
---
Removing the hammer completely makes no sense world wise. You cant smith with your barehands....
---
That's is cool! I literally saved the last one last night and forgot I needed 175 qp (currently at 143) and had my heart break after grinding the saves and quests required only to see the required qp to defeat the bosses. So I'm gonna be grinding some more quests. Oof

dude you sent this in 1 millisecond, tf???

Yes he will take it, and yes you can get another elite clue since the first one is gone
---
I have looked through u/soepbord's posting history and found 1 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
---
Watching this gave me anxiety.
---
Nahhhh I think most people are pretty against coinshare/lootshare in OSRS
---
Then its not even worth tracking, thats my point. Something that caps at 700kc isnt worth even having there.
---
Yeah I finally got the motivation to do a couple more for diaries, but it'll be a while until I go for ds2
---
It makes no sense you would carry a toolbelt with you when youre doing other activities that would be so needless and inefficient to carry around necess items. Bring a toolbelt for when you need it, we already have that, its called rogue kit. Thank you, next.
---
Realistically the only uses of D Scim are pking and Barbarian Assault.
---
Obby Sword with Berserker Neck is better than D Scim and Torture.
---
You as well!
---
I thought they were made in Thailand?
---
Keep proving my point bro, lmao, i'm nobody.
---
So I'm wrong because you claim to get more out of it than I do?
---
Has to be done on pvp world for full immersive possibilities
---
I had no clue they dropped godswords
---
Yeah when I read the clue I was thinking cowboy or circus performer, didn’t even cross my mind to think of BDSM
---
Wait is this real? It doesn't look like OSRS wiki has transcripts so I went to regular runescape wiki and it just says *(dialogue missing)* after you say that.
---
They also unironically claimed clicking smaller icon takes more skill, and how we have the useful update that is the spellbook filters.
---
You’re looking at it bruh
---
I powered through til the end because having the quest cape means I don't miss out on content and can go a good long while without touching quests again.
---
When the adderall kicks in
---
Rogue kit is a 1 use item that still takes the inventory spot. Make it not be a consumable and able to be worn and the issue is solved. Why would a kit that can be anything of many choices suddenly become a hammer and nothing else?
---
I'll certainly look at her in a different light when I return to Varrock.

You attain various different things in all skills by leveling up from 1-99. You don’t gain anything in addition to what you have already after 99 dipshit

I played this quest recently for an Article of the Week entry, and I do indeed recall this being said.
---
How you do smithing before mining?
---
It's a work in progress. Haven't you noticed all the blog posts about how they're going to remove imbues from NMZ? Their proposal to move all the rings etc. to Warding is the most famous, of course, but more recently part of the Song of the Elves rewards poll was "should crystal items be imbued by default, y/n, also regardless of the answer we're removing the imbue from NMZ".
---
It's not the only problem with that minigame, of course, but it's one they're obviously working on.
---
As for ZMI xp/h, IIRC they've also been working on nerfing some other stuff where the xp/h exceeded what was polled? There was something about that in a recent update, I think.
---
Restore 50% of max. Curved does full
---
Wtf lol
---
i dont play any games dude, i'd love too, but im crippled after work lol its an automatic messaging thingy i get it but holy fuck it's quick
---
5 minute AFK is just don't worry about rapid heal, it doesn't actually matter that much if you go above 1 HP, just shortens your instance duration.
---
20 minute is probably better to do NMZ normal, then just don't worry about rapid heal at all, and use Super Combats instead of Overload.
---
looks like 91 RC was totally worth it!
---
Where's the tl;dr? I'm not gonna spend 5 mins reading this
---
Ah, the old successful private servers everyone plays on! What's the name?... Hmmm... Looks like they aren't as successful as you say, huh? Moron.
---
You failed to name a single MMO that is successful without updates, which is my main point. Quit eating lead paint chips and shoving your head up your ass to get a second taste. People can like what they like and still be morons for wanting their UNSUCCESSFUL, UNVIABLE preference to be the norm.
---
Happened to me with a dh plate too lol, rip
---
I'm guilty too, only $45
---
Hate them, I purposely pick up everything eat/empty everything and bury bones when they jump right on the pile, waiting 30 seconds isn’t going to effect you but it does me.
---
Onlt 45 what?
---
What are ye doing in me pockets?
---
Number 2
---
I was trying to make a joke saying oh I spent $45, seeing as he wasn't at 2k... Nvm
---
I've talked to a few hosts who have 2-3 bots running and are successful; From what I gathered hosting GP varies widely, but it averages out to be around vorkath's gp/hr, give or take. Not exactly a shit ton of gp/hr, but for sure not negligible either.
---
Jebrim is pretty cool.
---
I was starting to worry we wouldnt have this thread today
---
damn i thought it was more. I heard people saying they get anywhere from 5-7m/h in tips. It's still really impressive considering you can basically do it completely AFK.
---
Obviously you've never been depressed.  And I'm sure you'll come back trying to say how you have been depressed yada yada, but sadness is not depression.  Apathy is not depression.  Hopelessness is not depression.  Depression is depression.
---
YIKES. So I ended up having two parties just like my two Christmases. Shoutout to everyone that came yet again.  I never expected so many people to turn out but I'm so glad that you guys did :) . Thank you artemis for keeping me safe! I hope everyone that came enjoyed your snacks and thank you so much to those that brought gifts, the real gift was your presence :). I wanna make it clear that everyone managed to make it home by 9 so we're in the clear.
---
Pick one rotation to learn. Just go in and log out instantly before the 2nd/3rd snake hits u if its not the right one. Watch guides and pretend to play along over the video. 
---
Also ueah its free to reclaim
---
4k per hour? Are you just hitting 0s consistently?
---
I think it is pretty hilarious you reference coinshare as being nostalgic - the real nostalgia is seeing actual items on the floor, like we do now
---
coinshare also f'd the economy last time, no way they risk that happening again
---
is this the same guy who suggested max fire cape should be removed from the game?
---
I like shampoo bottles that sit in my lappy
---
im not. im using runelite and it said i was getting 4k per hour
---
Not exactly, cooking to 200m is faster than 99rc.
---
I am aware, and am pretty sure my form is well.
---
Yes ik it will be 3+ mins, and it was like that for my first 10 kills then it started becoming 4+ mins.
---
My fiancè is on birth control anyway so that's all good, but yeah Im surprised I wasnt taught this. I was under the impression I was well educated about this in school.
---
Ironmeme.
---
That is not the point here
---
You should try resetting your xp in the xp tracker for range when you first login. If you shot something when you first login and then went and did other stuff for an hour then come back to ranging. It messes up the rate.
---
Sounds silly but I’ve heard of macros installed on a mouse before and could only assume somebody was smart enough to do it? Could explain removing support.
---
I'll try. Ty for the suggestion

yeah i reset it and it did the trick! thanks so much!
---
Nah, doesn't matter to me
---
If I didn't pick something up, its fair game for someone else
---
Thankyou do you know of any pictures that show it? Sorry for asking so many questions
---
where the fuck do you see 48 across wtf either meme or 1000IQ
---
Its not lol. It got buffed and now its better. Like seriously. Even without elite. Void mage was barely worse than mystic before and it was 30%. Now its 45%.
---
That makes sense, thanks for the explanation!
---
Apparently he forgot why he was confused.
---
toolbelts literally exist in real life
---
also by that logic we shouldn't have a backpack that can hold 28 items magically, which the tools already go in
---
Wildly pkers are just sort of sad, 99% of them aren't looking for a fair fight, they're looking for a defenseless pvmer to no-skill pk. I don't see how that's even fun. If you're going to pk at least fight someone who fights back.
---
this is awesome! underrated post
---
"You absolute cretin!" From King Roald after you kill his guard dog is still my favorite bit of dialogue.
---
Cars literally exist in real life
---
Me veyr good logic hurr durr
---
So it's irrelevant and pointless. It's like calling someone a nolifer for playing thirty minutes rs a day. See?
---
Those people should uninstall because they are ruining the game for the rest of us
---
My mouse has never worked on there app I remember they said ages ago it's just a bug but have no interest atm in fixing it soz dude idd advise you get a stylus then there amazing for osrs
---
Let's undermine the convenience of all the agility shortcuts by locking them away in diaries that take as long as simply walking around forever.
---
And your comment came lightning fast after I posted, you read nothing of the suggestion for changes other than the name of the skill in the title and commented off that.
---
Maybe, just maybe you could for once think for yourself and read through, make up your own opinion and like/dislike after that?
---
Also reference to where Jagex said that please?
---
Warding.
---
I mean if he wants max efficiency that makes sense right? That extra 187m xp in agility will really help his run energy.
---
&gt;&gt; not hiding any ground items under 1k...
---
You’re the karma chameleon
---
Nobody:
---
Everybody: this post sucks
---
Making a comment takes 5 sec, he can do plenty else
---
200m xp, you cant do anything else
---
Absolute chad
---
I mainly play with my s pen can do vork so easy with it I prefer it to a mouse most of the time now
---
Looks like someone didn't get the joke. Yikes.
---
yeah but the backpack already exists in game which makes as much "sense" as carrying around a toolbelt
---
but nope hurr durr any change = bad because muh eazee skaype
---
Running lavas is 7.5m/h...
---
190m/64k is 2900 hours of agility to get 200m agility. Aka getting 200m agility is 22b because altscape.
---
Atleast you didn’t lose your HC status to sire (@boaty).
---
Because it never realized it could hop across it.
---
I really don’t understand why they don’t just rework BH worlds all together, the amount of gold emblems bring into the game is ridiculous and I’m astonished that its been such an issue for years now. They need to introduce some kind of barrier to BH worlds or just rework emblems because this is unacceptable.
---
what is frog spawn even used for?
---
78 herblore for Chambers of xeric, also higher farming
---
"You dont see me complaining about mains" he said while complaining about mains.
---
Id try dks over kq, at the very least rex if you can't manage the other 2, while he does rex.
---
To hold the hones they'd have to drop their loot and what if another pker came?
---
:o I didn’t know I needed that high of herb for chambers of xeric. Is that the only two skills I need to improve? What farming level is ideal?
---
i usually just skip that part of the vid
---
Hmm not that I know of other than having no items greyed out and just double tapping alt when you want to pop them up.
---
100%, I heard they make upwards of 500m a day, and that isn't even the biggest farms.The economy hardly needs something else to fuck with it!
---
You can unlock the track in the lobby, no need to start a game
---
also like no updates lol
---
So... I didn't know what to put there since this is the first time in a long time with no drama.. So...  🦀🦀🦀
---
I wrote this while on downtime and on break at work. Let me know when you have time, brotha.
---
The fact that smithing was one of the first oof
---
I like when the gmaul goes slappy
---
Alright from your replies to comments it sounds like you really want someone to critique your actual kills. Food, gear and stats are apparently not the issue for you so it has to be your mechanics. Pm me your ign and I will absolutely tear every little thing you do to shreds and let you know where to improve.
---
Wait really? How do i enter the Lobby?
---
It was barely worse with 99 mage. Not 75.
---
No it doesnt. I want 2 inventories then. Id much rather have extra slots in a belt than just tools lol. Makes no sense only tools can be used in a belt. The backpack already exists there literally no reason why it cant be expanded. Id rather have extra inv spaces and then weigh a little more. 100 inv spaces for me 28 for u (and a toolbelt lol enjoy)
---
Yeah I don’t blame anybody in the thread tbh. I just shared my experience and it seems like people shouldn’t try to replicate what I did.  
---
I appreciate the guy who made it clear that WDR isn’t the place for that, and I also appreciate the dude who defended my comment.
---

Can I say the n word? I have a pass.
---
What do you expect Jagex to do? They're unable to identify you as the account owner on Reddit.
---
I assume the issue is about someone else being able to repeatedly recover your account, correct? 
---
What you could do is recover your own account through the recovery form. That should give Jagex a reference for future appeals, which hopefully prevents their weaker recovery appeals.  In there you can also utilize the "Other Comments" section at the bottom, stating this issue. While strictly speaking that is only to prove account ownership it might help. 
---
No guarantees though, unfortunately. You're going to need feedback from Jagex for that. Not sure if they're doing that through the official route.

---
you can sell your 13 lobsters at the ge for big moneys
---
Your time would improve if you were actually equipped to fight the boss. At the stats you have right now you basically just have to get really lucky to get a kill. 3 minute kills mean you don’t have enough damage which is caused by your stats, because your gear is decent. I know it seems like you should just be able to kill it and get better and faster, but you can’t when dps is what is dragging you down instead of positioning vs the boss.
---
It just pisses me off that I have 99 agility, but I'm not allowed to climb through a window without killing a giant bug a couple hundred times.

sir im sorry if im offtopic idk how to contact u im bad at using reddit and ur twitch channel seems dead so i would love to ask for a help. I downloaded the lutbot script and whenever i run it it slows my mouse to the point i cant even use it and have to restart pc i would love to use the script. Im using latest AHK running WIN10 64Bit 16GB ram my mouse is logitech G203 i run the script as administrator. After i manage to close the script everything went back to normal and i could use my mouse normaly. Any ideas
---
You're not supposed to get hit by the snow lmao. There are safe spots.
---
I know, I'm memeing fella every boss is worth doing for the content
---
From a visual standpoint it makes more sense though, have the nitty gritty details and small text in a menu about exactly that.
---
Bladed staff but still can't cut those webs in deep wildy. Smh jamflex

They're not quite comparable as a pet is just an RNG thing with a fixed drop rate (not that I care about "earning" cosmetic pets though)

You never get hit 2s at 10 hp. It's 1 or 3.

What the fuck does cooking have to do with surviving wintertodt? Are you drunk lmfao?
---
You will log out loooooong before you finish

This sub has some of the touchiest people I alive lol. I see a fucking book written over some Ironman meme and I made a joke. Not sure why you're trying to psychoanalyze me
---
...Yes you do?
---
You disgusting freak
---
I love the Cook’s Assistant if you already have all the cake ingredients too.
---
Because it's a unique item in the game. The game isnt perfect but having scales on the collection log isnt relevant on what makes this game good or bad
---
Ehp is max possible efficiency
---
While being semi efficient with your time isn't ehp.
---
It's the difference between say using a dragon axe&gt;rune and 3ticking Teak's.
---
Ones just a slight upgrade in gear the other is the max possible efficiency you can reach 
---
**Sorry I was a bit rude in the comment  I didn't mean for it to come out that way.** There's just so many people screaming "let them play the way they want" untill it's something efficient then they're sweaty try hards with mental illness
---
But why
---
More like you made a comment that is completely fucking useless. Gj.
---
More points
---
A more technical question but, how can total xp go over 2147m? I thought OSRS was limited to the 32-bit integer limit? Currently lynx Titan is at 4.6b xp.
---
What is the benefit of bots? I mean back in the day, people would use bots to give money to their main accounts. Can’t do that today.
---
I didn't mean for my comment to come out so rude, im sorry for that
---
I just came from  thread with people screaming for people to let others play the way they want, but the instant someone starts to talk about any form of efficiency they get shit on for being a sweaty try hard.
---
Like using an upgrade to gear is a lot different than say pray flicking piety your whole task. That's all I'm saying.
---
Since you are clearly some sort of genius, please tell us how your account was hacked. Did they brute Force your password? Did they hack into the runescape servers? Or could it possibly be that you didn't properly secure your account?
---
No, not trolling, I didn't mention raising the cap. I'm saying adding additional logic in the code to check for specific items is more resource intensive than just ignoring the fact that it bothers OP for this one item if that type of condition isn't already present in the code. Maybe it is there, but that's why the consideration matters.
---
Ffs that’s not what I mean at all
---
The real waste of money is not having your 4 rune dragon alts going at once to fund your max grind. What a noob
---
Because it's basically Runecrafting 2, and let me tell you, the original Runecrafting wasn't that good to deserve a second part
---
Ay man B0aty didn't quit.
---
you can skip twice, each skip puts you down a tier
---
Obor and Bryophyta
---
Or they could just add a toggle for it, why do you feel like it is neccesary for people who don't want it there to be forced into having it?
---
WHY?
---
the ascent of arceuus quest or something like that, its the novice level quest for arceuus house
---
&gt;I'm saying adding additional logic in the code to check for specific items is more resource intensive
---
I have literally no idea what you're talking about. What items? Are you saying they need to *add* code to *remove* the scales from the log?
---
Well in his case it pretty much killed his career so you have to consider the low IQ activity of low impulse control, lack of delay of gratification.
---
For NMZ melee training (strength at the moment), which set up is better on all the low defense monsters?:
---
-	Helm of nezzy, amulet of torture, bandos chest, bandos tassets, abyssal bludgeon, dragon boots, barrows gloves, berserker ring
---
-	Obsidian helmet, berserker necklace, obsidian body, obsidian legs, Toktz-xil-ak (obby set effect), dragon boots, barrows gloves, berserker ring 
---
Looking to maximize my XP per hour. Thanks!!
---
The people who play efficiently will make their own private game sessions. They won't let normies ruin their precious ehp or whatever.
---
You must have planted 3 just before the growth tick if you replant them every time then it doesnt make any difference
---
Honestly whenever I pass by the typical bot farms I just report a few and move on, there's not much else you can do, but hey, it's something. Besides, if you're looking for certain things like seeds or free fish for cooking they just toss it on the ground, which is one of the few upsides of hitting for your average player. 
---
Still think they should be banned though, freakin play the game you jerks.

You, and your art, are amazing. More pretty please!

Pretty sure it’s under the GPU rendering plugin’s settings. Can also increase the draw-distance from there.
---
So you shouldn’t call someone who is a nazi, like Stonetoss, a nazi because sometimes people who aren’t nazis get called nazis?
---
Nope the All Kharid palace window shortcut only requires completion of the hard diaries which just requires one KQ kill.
---
not sure if you're just trolling or what but you wouldn't be using rune or granite weapons at 60 attack if you know what you are doing.
---
and i'm clearly not the one acting big and tough here.
---
Did you read through my post? It's nothing like it. More of an extension to Firemaking, with Runecrafting altars being the source for the magic used when casting Wards.
---
Runecrafting as it is now is rather horrible I agree. Why not make it less so without devaluing it for whiny people with 99 in it already?
---
on top of that, it's imo slighlty more convinient to check the weapon type on the combat tab rather than opening up the equipment tab. Either place is fine tbh
---
How does it run ? Ran like shit for me on Ubuntu with chrome book
---
Yes they can.
---
Cmonbruh, no racism in chatroom.

*Urban* is the racial-neutral term you must be looking for &gt;!/s!&lt;

Lol, ik you can safe spot it while cutting but I like to fletch half way and be closer while cutting too usually. I've only even been hit by it once anyway and that's while playing another acc and watching Hulu.

Just make it a toggle. Solves all the arguments.
---
Spread bullshit? A human being made a little mistake about a piece of info from a 15 year old game... Your toxic attitude is the only bullshit being spread. If you don't like a comment downvote and move on. That's what the arrows are for, btw.

IP ban
---
definitely. i may be a bit overstatted for the average barrows’er but i rarely eat or sip. even with 4 way range and 4 way tunnels switch i have 5-6 open inventory spots
---
Weapons of the same type retain the same combat style when equipped, so it's not unnecessary. As for the aesthetic of it, that's a whole other argument, but it does have its uses

As far as I can see, yes to an extent. I see no reason why you can't go fishing -&gt; cooking -&gt; mining -&gt; smithing -&gt; ranging, etc. There'd probably be an issue somewhere, though. Not sure.
---
Looks great, if you have the rock golem pet, give it the lovakite ore and try a dragon warhammer or a dragon cane instead of that staff.
---
He likes a quick fuck, don’t judge.

Ya, that’s kind of what I’m thinking. It would be a dedicated world, maybe convert Role playing worlds to this.

My melee spec setup is bgs, dragon boots, melee void Helm, and fire cape. Supplies are Anti-venom+, super extended antifire, super restore, ranging pot, super attack, rune pouch with dust law and chaos, 1 click tele, ardy cloak, 4 karambwans and the rest mantas

They should add more rewards to them IMO

600m xp  total level 326 and shit on my account already

Even better, we need a max obby cape

The implication being that if you put 3000 hours into the game and don't have the ability to do the Inferno, then you're a brainlet.

I was close to 80 chests dry at barrows after finishing mory hards. Then yesterday I decided to take a break from barrows and started doing MLM since I need a coal bag for 70 Smith. Then after about 20min of that I got the mining pet. Hyped I went back to barrows and got 2 items in ~10 chests. Granted they were Ahrims and Karil heads but still.
