Considering that melee has gotten claws, elder maul and rangers with their ballista, dragon bolts, dragon knives and dragon throwing axes, it would only be fair for mages to get soemthing.

This is as good of an idea as a straight pride parade

I do however agree that an item being in the game for 3 years and having very little of them leave the game probably contributes to the price falling over time

I know its not bis spec wep but at cerb and thermy its not bad

Yeah I thought about this. Was using karils with arma helm before I got void, but now I just have it out of the way. I appreciate the reply, and I‚Äôll probably do this! And slowly working my way to getting qpc and elite void..

I hear you man. The pray bonus of elite d hide is worth it over karils since your praying mage anyways. I'm honestly not the best at Vorkath but any improvement in kill time will help with raking in that sweet, sweet GP faster. Also if you don't have 83 con, doing it on w330 (if your ping isn't horrible) is great for replenishing spec and teleing back.

Ppl use it at tob, its a good spec to use as a last hit

I got an email from RS that was a symbol off from the official RS email stating that my password was changed. I almost put in my info to login and see what was up but double checked the address before hand and realized it was fake. If this almost happened to me, imagine how many times it happens to other RS players on a daily basis? 
---
If someone logs into a players account from a suspicious device, there should be an email notfiying the account holder of said login. There should also be 2FA with text message. These are basic security measures that a majority of internet based programs utilize. You'd expect Jagex to step up their account security for players with the amount of money this company makes off of us and gives away easily to clans.

THIS GUY NEVER TOUCHES A GIRL IN A PICTURE, HOW BOUT NEVER HITTING A MONSTER FOR SLAY EXP? SINCE EASY SCAPE IS WHAT WE TEND TO GET

The poll that was put up to offer players a way to remove exp did not pass. Sorry OP.
---
On the bright side, you can still get 3 more prayer levels before you hit 36 combat.
---
That was about 400-600m back then, and from memory they spiked around 1-2m, so yes that's a decent flip. Also did you not read the part where I said he was merching other pking related items? Ags is the only one I remember because I saw it in the video, but he had well over 1b invested into the stuff.
---
Nice to hear of some good, ignore the nay sayers OP
---
Just get at least 75 so basically everything's unlocked. Kind of silly having 95 strength when you can't even hold a godsword yet. 
---
But your strength should be north of 80 before you do the 70 to 75 attack grind - you didn't mention what your current str was.

The uniques are going to be cheap on release. The only use for them is ironmen and I guess people who can't afford a better crush weapon, but given how cheap hasta is that probably won't be too many people

---
*edgy comment about GF being your sister*
---
I have under 1m for gear/potions/food and I'm only 50 in each combat skill. Since I can only afford under 100k items, would slayer still be the best option? Most slayer tasks right now are just costing me food with almost no return, I'm worried about reliably getting 65+ slayer with cheap gear and cheap food.
---
idk where you're getting that from lol
---
i'm still seeing tons of people on my herb runs and i don't even do them religiously. i can expect about 200k from a normal avantoe + ranarr + limp harvest which obviously isn't vorkath-tier money but it's pretty good for the effort i put into it

wait u can do this
---
If they're PCI compliant then the credit card info they save (if they even save it, I dunno) is likely on a separate server with tighter security policies. The password requirements has zero to do with their CC security.
---
And even if it did, having case-sensitive passwords, while a nice feature, wouldn't make a difference for people who are concerned with security since a random 20 character alphanumerical case-insensitive password is already virtually impossible to brute force.

This weapon is much worse than whip.  If anything is the crush whip, it's the bludgeon, it just costs a bit more. That being said, crush is super niche now that you don't really need it in raids

I don‚Äôt want a shitty hd graphics tho. Whip was hideous. Dscim was a red dildo. I‚Äôm from RSC era... so updated graphics to me just scream RS3.

I‚Äôm talking about QoL updates that are everyone focused, not just on how to make Ironman accounts better. There‚Äôs a lot that can be fixed in the game. This post isn‚Äôt the place to list it out, I just would love those fixed, instead we get more updates.

How did I forget my strength haha, it‚Äôs at 75 atm. And that makes sense, cheers for the advice. Do you think I should be 85-90 str before going for 75 attack then?

I'd very much recommend getting the 56 agility, you will need it in the future regardless, but if you want to boost using summer pies you will need multiple of them since you will encounter the same obstacles over and over again. But the answer you are looking for is no, it's not possible without that requirement unless you boost from a lower level.

This is the most dumbest thing from this post.

You get my upvote!

It's interesting to see someone set limits and handicaps for themselves to achieve some sort of goal. It essentially turns the grindy game that Runescape is into a puzzle (with grindy bits, of course). It also pushes you into exploring content of the game that pretty much nobody knows and/or cares about to suit your own interests. It's fascinating seeing things with almost no worth to them - such as a bridge acting as an obstacle for an area for a quest - and seeing it as some sort of blessing because of the handicaps you set on yourself - that same bridge being used as your only means of farming agility in the early-game.
---
Even with combat sometimes when I‚Äôm doing clues I say fuck it and just fight the wizard in graceful
---
Sense motherfucker, you don't make any.
---
This got me curious, whats the most tanky set up possible? And how effective is it at tanking, and how terrible is the damage?
---
thats pretty much why i have issues with this idea, if you wanna group ironman, you can. it seems people really crave that little ironman symbol to feel like they are validated. I had an ironman, quit it because i  didnt like missing community events with mates, but it seems to me it's more for bragging rights than people actually wanting to play it

I do raid, pretty frequently as well, have both pets.  Definitely can get carried, though you're less likely to get drops.  Actually, the first scythe I missed was in the first 2 weeks of TOB release and the guy who got it died at Verzik.  I've missed more than one T Bow in ffa raids to guys who die at olm as well.

I did 99 Ste with 70 attack with slayer though. I definitely hit a lot of 0's but it wasn't enough to stop me. Might give you a few extra k exp an hour if you get 80-85. Depends on your end goal I guess.

You're making some pretty hard-line claims about how to have fun here, as well as what a player's motivations are my guy. There's nothing wrong with having a maxed account the same way everyone else did it. You said it yourself; if it's about the journey, then why can't you enjoy it the same way anyone else does? Maybe the way I engage with the game is different than the way you engage with it. There's no reason you have to make your own path to enjoy walking down one. 
---
Furthermore, why can't I "try my best" and "adapt to meet my goals through hard work and determination" with a guide to help me? Am I better somehow if I kill cows instead of doing waterfall quest? Am I better if I farm potatoes instead of doing Fairy Tail Part 1? Does the guide negate the massive grind for a specific goal? If I use a guide, am I unable to innovate or find new methods myself? Honestly, it just seems like a false dichotomy and some kind of purism/elitism.
---
Now, I think its fair to say that making your own path is engaging in different, and perhaps more robust ways. For context, I have a lot more fun on my uncommon snowflake iron that I did on my regular account. The theory crafting and exploring different content has been a blast. But you know what? I can still use loosely related guides and stuff as a framework in order to have a better understanding of my options.
---
I guess I'm just trying to say that I think guides get a bad rap, and that there's really no "best" play style except the one that you engage with the best. To say that other people don't try their best or put in effort, that they even have to put loads of effort into their medieval clicking game to enjoy it, or that their "fun" is invalid is a little silly.

RL does autocomplete names sometimes. I'm not sure if it has to be on the same account that originally searched it, or if you have to look them up several times first, but it does autocomplete sometimes. Worth a try if you haven't already.

Assuming you aren‚Äôt an Ironman, it‚Äôll be a lot easier to kill zulrah with a little better gear.   Learn rotations as well because regardless of gear, if you know rotations you should be able to kill zulrah on an inventory.    Stats are good but work on some better gear, best of luck with the snake!
---
Well, he is maxed after all
---
I did it yesterday on my Ironman. They are not too difficult of bosses. What are you combat levels? A little comes down to strategy- what to bring, when to eat, where to stand but for the most part you can just watch and make sure you don‚Äôt die. I wouldn‚Äôt say you are an idiot, especially if it was your first time.

Good one

hard clues arent worth doing

How do you find time for all that? Lets say social life is only on weekends, so you sleep and work for 8 hours each that leaves just 8 hours during the day for other activities. Lets say getting ready for work, driving to work and back, plus eating breakfast and dinner take 1hr combined. 7 hours left, lets take out another hour for the gym and another hour for general responsibilities, leaving 5hrs a day. Thats 20 hours a week, assuming you do not play on friday because you socialize. Then even if you do 12 hours both Saturday and Sunday (which i guess does leave time to socialize still and go to the gym if you go on weekends) that puts you at 44 hours a week on OSRS. Thats 704 hours over 4 months, which i guess is doable for quest cape and all your other accomplishments.

Not judging or anything, but is all your free time outside of gym, work and socializing filled with osrs?

I do, but AT&amp;T's "unlimited" plan has a 10GB data allowance for hotspots. Even then the ping isn't that great. It varies from 90-200 ms, and once I run out of data it shoots to 300+.

I always thought they should take the old duel arena tournament system from ~2007/8 and just add that but with realistic gear restrictions/brackets, dunno how easy it would be to implement but realistically the only reason it wasn't popular and didn't last was because of the lack of restrictions forcing it to be one big brew/tank fest.

To whom I can reach at Jagex, MY ACCOUNT WAS BANNED  FOR SOMETHING I TRULY DID NOT  DO!  - Scatzie420- 
---
The night of 6/4 - 6/5/19 my Oldschool Runescape account was hacked. I AFK‚Äôd from my desktop to head upstairs to bed thinking my runescape account would time out. I then grab my iPad to play the game further upstairs in bed, realizing my account hadn‚Äôt been logged out yet.  I was still unable to log in at this time, not thinking much of it I passed out.  In the morning 6/5/2019 I still couldn‚Äôt log into  my account from the iPad. 
---
Then I realized that my account had been compromised. I quickly rushed downstairs to the desktop, logged on the Runescape website. Changed my password, set up an authenticator. I had a bank pin pending on my account but that takes 7 days. I was on day 3 of the bank pin process. Why didn‚Äôt I have an authenticator?  I didn‚Äôt use one growing up when I was 13 years old,  I didn‚Äôt think I'd  need one at 28. REKTED! 
---
After changing my password, and setting an authenticator. I proceed to log on to my account. My pending bank pin was canceled.My bank was heavily looted, almost everything in my bank of GP value was sold overnight on the Grand Exchange. 
---
In 2019 I became the dumbass who got hacked.  How do I know I was hacked?? The hacker overnight  picked over 8.6k flax.. BRUH ! I'd never have the patience to pick that much flax.  On top of that I think I had lvl 44 crafting, I was cutting gems. I had no need for flax.
---
After being hacked, I read the terms and policies on Jagex  item returns/restorations. I came to the conclusion that I‚Äôd never receive my in-game items back. I can bounce back. What I cannot bounce back from is my account being banned for something I truly didn't  do and/or capable of doing. I was able to play the game for about an hour or so that morning, after changing my password and setting up an authenticator  before my account was shut down for ‚Äúmacroing major‚Äù. I didn't even know what this was until I did research.(Botting for short)

I started my online gaming career with OSRS in 2004 on Ghettoboy30. That was  over 15 Years ago! Despite being hacked in 2019! I truly enjoy the community of OSRS and wouldn‚Äôt jeopardize the community for cheating! I wouldn't ruin any game by choosing to cheat my way to success! Even though my account  was new and was less than a month old, It's the simple fact that my account banned wrongfully. Yes, I NOW understand that the 2-step security process is set in stone to help players keep a secure account. When you‚Äôre reliving your first childhood  MMORPG in 2019, you tend to get lost in the awesome sauce. I was the dumbass who got lost in the awesome sauce and hacked. You might say make a new account. My pride and my wife won‚Äôt allow me to grind another account out because I know deep down that I did nothing wrong. Before I truly give up on OSRS I want to make a final attempt on recovering my account.
---
PLEASE HELP ME OBTAIN MY HONEST OSRS ACCOUNT BACK

Lowlander, the first to max an ultimate, i believe was able to work so much because he was on some like 6 month leave for workers comp or something and managed to start a streaming career during it. But because it was such a long period of paid leeave he had no problem playing so much.
---
I mean they don't all have to be combat based
---
im gunna paly devils advocate here and say its not pussy behaviour to try to use cheats when theres so much money on the line, but if you ahk in low lvl pure fights for 7k loot ur a certified degen
---
Quick run down on scepter guy?
---
I'd do it to get this boss done. Really want to upgrade with them gloves
---
Support! Servers in Singapore please!

Tatanka kute. Tell em eko sent you

EZ FOR TUBBY!!! I love this dude his cockiness was part of his charm though :D
---
I think they set some milestones for themselves, one of them being able to use house when they get to 100M shared bank (25M or something unlocked ability to recollect their achievement diary rewards etc).
---
What was the email it came from?
---
Cute mole!
---
2 hardboiled.
---
The rest are egg whites
---
Wait, i thought u couldnt log in multiples on the same computer?
---
noreply@e.runescape.com
---
Thanks for the gratz and silver bro!
---
Ah ok, maybe if I had watched the whole series I would‚Äôve known that
---
My account name is beatable, was chilling at G.E and saw a dude that I felt like inspecting. His name? Unbeatable.
---
Loved it. I befriended him too
---
I cannoned imps on sandcrab beach. The spot used to be better pre-Hosidius rework, but I still averaged 380/hour if I somewhat prevented the imps from roaming. Could also just dart fletch while doing these.
---
According to this, that email is legit so I think you're safe:
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001257125-Suspicious-emails
---
Seems like a weird phishing attempt if it was one. Usually phishing emails will threaten a ban or tell you that someone tried to change your password or something.
---
Actually, giving them away for gp or renting them is real world trading which will result in a perm ban. Also account sharing rules will be enforced when it comes to tournaments including dmm and Skilling challenges. So everything you said is against the rules.
---
Just quit dog. It‚Äôs just a video game at the end of the day. Remember to play video games for fun if you aren‚Äôt making money off of them. Once they stop being fun, get another game or another hobby. It took me a while to figure this out tbh
---
Aw sweet I guess I was just being  paranoid lol
---
&gt; luck based
---
that is literally what pking is, pure luck and pressing weild,f1,spec. Switches is the only "skill" involved.
---
Who thinks this sub started it?
---
damn bro is your r=0 because there's no fucking correlation
---
They sell for alch value at the wilderness bandit camp. Good money maker for low level members.
---
It'll take you longer to reach goals than it would if you could play more often, but as long as you're having fun, it's more about the journey than the destination anyways.
---
You might get frustrated at how long it takes to level, though. Might be worth making sure every single lvling method you use is the most efficient method possible.
---
Jagex, respond and ban him or suffer the communities wrath.
---
W309 Wintertodt is lit
---
For me, construction and runcrafting. I am the ultimate creator.
---
what‚Äôs the runelite setting to have the different hp bar?
---
Sames
---
You will have to click every 5 minutes to avoid getting logged out
---
because OP wants content created just for him. He has no one to play GIM with so it looks like a waste of time.
---
Bro it's a statue, it's still thicc, but ya know, ya can't "smash" her. Plus she's married.
---
Being vegan isn't real in runescape, always gotta eat fish to live.
---
3.6? Not great, not terrible
---
You couldnt log into multiple account in the same browser in like 2006
---
If you want to train slayer to do PvM meaning if you get abby demons you do sire, if you get dagannoths you do DK's, ... do you ever want to buy extends or does that make the tasks ridiculously long? Second question, since you get slayer exp based on the monster you kill would that mean if I get dagganoths and do DK's I will get 255 slayer exp per kill because they have 255 hp or when I do cerebus I get 600 exp per kill because he has 600 hp?
---
sounds overwhelmed me the first couple times. I don't think anyone needs to turn the sound off but relying on one cue makes it harder no matter what. understanding that sound + an animation starting meant mage. 
---
everyone finds their groove. I did better with casual music playing than jad sounds on my 5th try when I succeeded
---
He MAKES trump eat all his vegetables lol
---
HP followed by Crafting. 
---
Not entirely sure what that means
---
Only man on earth who can make trump eat his vegetables
---
Oh wow okay, I aint doing that lol. For some reason I thought you could afk till you got 6-hour logged
---
i do extends on the tasks that i want to extend, if that makes sense. Yes more exps from boss variance of slayer monsters, like grotesque gives 1.4k+, cerb gives 400+ etc etc iirc
---
Is swampy really 18?
---
*sigh... Unzips*
---
I did not know that!
---
Will have to do the telegrab trick
---
How much xp/hr is library?  
---
Also fucking congrats
---
PvM
---
What did the person say to insult you to begin with that caused the argument? The ignore list is there for petty insults that just annoy you, it should only be serious offensive language that results in reporting or muting.
---
I do TOB on 300+ ping and been to zuk 3 times so far, it took many tries to get this far so by no means is it easy but it is doable
---
Met a guy the other day at the Ge with 10k zulrah kills all he was missing was magma mutagen
---
Yikes
---
Youre claiming abused over the word idiot? Jesus christ what has this world come to
---
Wait a minute... There's some fuckery about... I thought it was you typing the entire time until I saw it lmao.
---
Jagex have already done enough for account security. If you get hacked at this point it‚Äôs your own goddamn fault.
---
come hang out with us
---
Correct, he was just about to be DQ'd before he lost his fight. The account was also subsequently banned.
---
Of course they don't manually process the tens of thousands of daily reports. They have a system that flags accounts that get reported. These flagged accounts are then monitored closer and banned easier. Or that's how it is assumed to work.
---
Nice slowflake argument, pmod seems reasonable.
---
I give three fucks
---
So I just got hacked tonight, and after a bit of research i figured out they got in through my email. I‚Äôm just wondering why you could reset a password through an email without providing the existing password to the account. What are the dumb cunts at Jagex thinking?
---
Only if it's locked behind Sinhaza Shroud Tier 5 and required all least 1 death in ToB.
---
can I kill vorkath with blowpipe with regular antifires? Or do I need more protection?
---
You can stand under the dragons and let the NPCs kill it. When galvek launches an attack run south to dodge it and tank one hit from the dragon
---
Damn, is that mining and crafting all from RC?
---
Nobody said jad was hard but you
---
A lot less than 75k at lower levels, using the normal method (no banking or imp boxes) I maxed 32k an hr at 77 with maximum concentration. It should be higher at higher levels
---
At mid 20-30s I recall getting 2k exp/hr
---
It all depends on RNG and how well your route planning is
---

Easy there, bwana

I wanted that emblem upgrade so bad. In the back of my mind I knew it wasn't a good idea chasing an unarmed target 10 wilderness levels. It led to my ultimate downfall but that's the price I paid to try and upgrade to t2
---
You don't buy extra graceful sets so you have every recoloured graceful set?
---
Whoa I saw that guy too, he was on the USA world, it was pretty dope
---
There's about a 2.5% chance you wouldn't get a clue scroll (1/128 drop) in 500 kills. It's not outrageously unlikely.
---
Me teaching my buddy vasa earlier. ‚ÄúOkay so after he teles you, start chugging brews!‚Äù Got it! ‚ÄúOkay here‚Äôs the tele!‚Äù Got it! *99 hit splat* ‚Äú.... bro?‚Äù Got it!
---
&gt;I understand what you mean, but the exact same thing could be said for any Ironman account. That‚Äôs what people did before official Ironman accounts became a thing.
---
Exactly. If you want this new game mode, why not start it on your own on a normal account? If it's really popular, it can catch on.
---
There'd probably be the most popular support for an \[insert region\]-locked ironman mode at this point, if anything, after Swampletics. But we're already adding a group ironman mode and allegedly reviving DMM.
---
When devs have to maintain all of this in the long run, not just release it, adding unnecessary, unproven new modes doesn't seem wise.
---
He needed to predict them. Many instances were 1 ticks. Most people aren't used to vsing people as good as manked.
---
this. why bother wasting all your energy on a labor job thats paid by the hour with probably close to minimum wage
---
They identified it *during* the fight not before. If it was to be identified before then like u/Jagex_Weath is saying they would have DQ‚Äôd him, but because he was in the fight and lost, there was no need to DQ him as he was already eliminated, but his DMM Account has been permanently banned and I‚Äôm sure those who have fought him (and lost) in the previous brackets will be notified and potentially compensated with some amount of free membership.
---
They clearly have no conscience. It'd feel so bad to win and get  a high status from cheating. Pathetic

Mobile only, Ive got 80+ combat stats and need to rebuild since coming back. Any tips for barrows on mobile? Thinking that's where I'm going to start. 
---
Don't know what else to do other than barrows but AFK skills/Max at NMZ/Slayer
---
Especially not as a 18 y/o beginner.
---
Don‚Äôt lie, we all know you‚Äôve photoshopped this.
---
DUDE WEED!!!!

Who won the dmm?
---
Being honest here, but the cape looks ugly for what is it. I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt bother asking where the cape came from if I saw someone wearing it. But if I were to get such an achievement I‚Äôd want a big ass cape and have people know what I did.
---
Amazing achievement nevertheless
---
Yeah I think I will get myself to 80 before going all the way to 99 based off the replies in the thread, seems like the best idea. Thanks :)
---
What fkn mongol says 'draggy'
---
&gt; 5% of your total wealth upon death is absolutely insane
---
Can you even imagine how badly that'd go with disconnects and DDOSing alone? People would shit enough bricks to build a neighborhood after...a week, tops.
---
All account security suggestions would be optional.
---
I don't want to aim for the old death mechanic, due to ddosing, I just want there to be a cost to dying.
---
This one
---
Convinced all the people who post about this app are doing it on behalf of the company. A screenshot of this ad gets posted every day.

I'm from the UK but living in New zealand atm. Jeese I would pay shipping to move just one server from Australia to New Zealand. You think the country's are close but they really aren't.

It's not a meme, but science that the government tries to hide

Zulrah scales are a constant flip. The prices are mostly static so you can easily get away by buying it on -2 and selling for +2. Keep your eyes glued to updates, so easy to make money by buying items relevant to updates then selling. If all you need for new crystal key chests are the keys then those seem to be an easy flip right now, with the keys being worth around 23k and the chest being a bit more.
---
I didnt catch the sarcasm in the original comment. With slayer xp rates reaching 100k to 150k + with an alt/alts there is no way the garg boss is efficient in any manner. Each kill only grants 1350 slayer xp. 
---
Yes the granite cannonballs deal more damage over time, But not enough to justify spending hours grinding them. You would get more slayer xp and ranged xp using the time spent grinding the grante dust on simply completing more tasks using regular cannon balls.
---
But muh efficiency
---
It was fun. It was cute. I wouldn't mind seeing it again, if it were revamped enough to pass a poll and mesh well with the current game.
---
I find a dragon sword particulary useful at Wyrms, as they are weak to stab weapons. However baxes and maces are quite useless. Really hope Jagex is planning on doing something with them.
---
How do I find this vid for research purposes?

they should make a seperate rs3 server starting fresh with no mtx and double xp, see how that goes.
---
Give me my fucking Dutch worlds back
---
holy fuck LOL. Thats the good stuff lol
---
What Biegous said is an actual and legitimate concern, if they can only "detect" cheaters like this using only their eyes and not an automatic system we have more than a serious problem here not just for the tourney but for the game as a whole. People like you are the reason game companies can get away with repetitive mistakes.
---
Yes. This has always been rigged. AHKers and switch bots have always been in the game winning these things. This is why I quit bridding - it's a computerized game to win now. The only way to demonstrate skill is have EVERYONE be at a LAN.
---
They fixed the problem as soon as it was identified. What more do you want?
---
Support. I'm not even near the lvl for luckies, but it seems reasonable for the requirements and rarity.
---
Yeah, the hyperinflation of xp rates is what REALLY put me off and made me quit for good a few years ago. A lot of skills are a joke now, slayer is consistently 1.3m+ xp/hr, farming I've heard from a friend with the new player owned farms is effectively free at 10m+ xp/hr rates daily. Fuck, even all the combat skills are around 2m xp/hr with shattered worlds, hunter is 1.6m+ xp/hr etc.
---
It's just absurd at this point to me.
---
No, its fake
---
Because it was a dumb rule anyway
---
Maybe fix it before it's identified using an automated system? You dense fuck.
---
Wait do people think that membership just goes back into programming the game and paying programmers? Not variable costs, investors, advertising, fixed costs, bug fixing, cleaners, food, rent etc... why do people keep thinking 07scape and rs3 are separate companies and don't see it as JaGex... the revenue from both games is spread out over a ton of stuff
---
Yeah. All f2p worlds arent 90% bots or anything. 
---
Free membership bot farms dont do anything either
---
 BlazersRhys. 2nd place went to  Lun0\_0
---
Lmaooo
---
You could probably overlap them on inventory/chatboxes and fit more long the bottom of each monitor
---
Zoinks
---
i said. banning 1 won‚Äôt fix the problem
---
What do you mean by marbles?
---
No it's actually 100%, everyone on the internet is a bot
---
That's not necessarily true amymore at all. Maybe in the 60s and 70s when Arnold was a bodybuilder but sports science and the sports IQ of the average bodybuilder has come a long way since then. If this guy eats 24 eggs every day and 2 whole chickens hes just a straight up freak, that is not an average way for a bodybuilder to eat anymore, and you don't need to eat like that to be jacked.
---
Im told its the equivalent of a chest x-ray
---
I‚Äôm 19, took your advice applied to all the supermarkets and fast food places around. Want to get out of this shit hole
---
Its a game that the chat can get involved with and the person who wins the race gets gifted a sub from the streamer I believe something along them lines
---
this is definitely server side dude. ive been having the same connection issues, if not worse
---
Hang in there, bub. It took me almost 700 for my first Zulrah unique
---
How much money did you even make from that?
---
Being swole pretty much has no advantages at all in life except being attractive. You‚Äôre less mobile, you need to keep up a crazy routine and diet to maintain it, cardio is not good, youre not actually as strong as you look (unlike powerlifters who look fat). It really is worthless tbh but you look cool as fuck
---
Or maybe the guy didn't use it till that fight?
---
I mean if you actually think its a joke you're delusional he'll play off the "Oh guys I was only joking!" after people actually start subbing cuz he knows it works, tbh I rarely do go in his streams but if you genuinely think its acceptable to sit there and ask for money to do tob then fair enough lmao regardless if hes been "offered hundreds of dollars to previously do tob and declined" I think you're missing the point because im talking about right now even if he didnt accept that then, whats he doing now? I get that he might be joking when he says it but he still knows its gunna work thats the point.
---
I just bought a pharaoh scepter for a master clue and sold back 20min later for 30k profit. I felt pretty good.
---
Ive seen some low effort SHIT in my time but this is right fucking down there
---
Show me the source, becouse I'm sure it doesn't exist.
---
I like the way you say beautiful average. 
---
Being just above average dimensions is more a disadvantage than an advantage if your not a pro athlete. 
---
Anyone taller than you would be moving longer distances to the ground to load the pallets. Even just 2 inches taller would happen up to miles and miles of more work. Not even considering energy expenditure.
---
Why so mad?
---
Yes it is. The amount of burned sharks is pretty significant before the chance drops to 2%, that‚Äôs a lot of xp waste which certainly covers the extra 8 steps to the bank and a ton of gp waste.
---
Yeah so exactly what I said
---
Transformers
---
THATS ALSO THE POINT OF STREAMING?????  The point is to make money for him.   If his audience appreciates his jokes and subs because of it then thats fan-fucking-tastic.  He would be doing ToB today regardless of how many subs he fucking gets.   
---
If you dont understand how streaming works then thats fine, but the whole idea of streaming is selling yourself and your stream.  Sorry they dont do it for free.  You probably shouldnt watch streams if you dont like the idea of streamers making money from their audience.
---
Your account name is PoeticBlade, you created your account on February 2009, you use username to log in instead of email, hacking you rn. GG.

u are perm banning an account that's called throw away account. alot of dmmt players use throw away accounts just letting u know.

This is the strategy for all Dark Souls bosses as well

There are also youtube videos about how vaccines cause autism and how they dont cause autism these both cant be right. There are videos about the earth being flat and round these cant both be right. Do I need to keep the list going about how youtube is not an accurate source of information? Also he pointed out that your math was wrong completely discrediting you even if the video is 100% accurate
---
the saddest part is it will never be the same and the game will likley be dead in the next 5 years
---
This is a nice one before the meme gets overdone
---
He probably got cleaned at the sand casino. All maxed mains die there. Poor guy
---
Prove your statement of 200 pound a month then using that video.  Oh you cant because you made it up :(.    
---
Also one single youtube video doesnt exactly prove what he's making.  The only "proof" is one mans words.  Does he show his bank statements?  His paycheck?  Anything other than his word to prove it?  Nope.  Thats why its not a reliable source.  Try doing that anywhere else in the real world.   Things arent just true because you say it, they may be true but you have to be able to back it up.  
---
Oh yeah that 200 pound a week thing, you gonna address that or just ignore your complete and utter bullshit lie?
---
77 with lavas is pretty cheap, if you‚Äôre pushing further tho. .
---
Does it actually get better at 77? Leveling to 70 was painful already but I have to get it done for base 80s.
---
Using Alex Jones wouldve been funnier.
---
Don't practice flipping with 10m start with like 100k on cheap items and keep trying till you learn what you're doing. Once you get small profits off the 100k you can start throwing more money at flipping and slowly throw more and more at it as you learn what you're doing. And once you learn super basic flipping you can learn more advanced methods. At 1m+ youll know basic flipping well enough and have enough money to start trying set combinations, at 10m+ youll be experienced enough and have enough money to learn about high volume flips. At 100m you'll learn merching, at 500m you'll learn investing. It's a progression. I recommend actually starting a flipping from 25gp account. Not having enough money to flip anything more complicated is a good way to Pace yourself and make sure you're not going in too deep too fast
---
You forget that it's a rare drop from a level 50+ minigame.

Ags is good for both spec and basic attacks.

Runelite literally has a screenshot button.
---
Everyone on a lan using vanilla client or runelite client on jagex computers. That way they can actually monitor the players and find the rats using cheatclients. Problem with that is how much of a cost it would be to do so.

stop being such a sook, im sure the pvp world is free.

You're getting a bit of a big head there pal. I first suspected it when you said the fishing net was added for you as a stealth update in one of your videos. I was sceptical and brushed it off, but seeing this reply it's clear to me that you think the game should/shouldn't accomodate to your account. No. Your account should play around the game's obstacles and opportunities, not the other way around.   
---
Just because you play an MMO like a single player game, doesn't mean it's still an MMO. It's always evoilving and changing for everyoner, not just for you.
---
No doubt. I have a wife and family obligations, this would never happen for me. Just saying its possible to hold down a relatively healthy lifestyle playing an excssive amount of scape, at least for a younger lad.

thats helpfull thanks bud bless you.

One of the mods said they‚Äôre banning like 200 players a day for using this specific client

This leaves very little to the rest of your life though... you still need exercise, entertainment, social interaction, etc.

Trust me, I wish I could sperg out and forget all my daily needs, family, and friends, but this lifestyle is rarely healthy...

That's ridiculous. I'm all for people using 3rd party clients for simple QoL updates that should be in game, but this takes the cake more than a thieving bot.

RIP RUNESCAPE WE ARE DOOMED!

I was butthurt after 5 or so attempts, feeling like I couldn't do it at my level. Asked for advice in my cc and they said keep trying. Got it on my 7th attempt and had lots of spare food. Very rng gated fight. Good luck!

To be fair, the game has had bots since it came out. The biggest problem bots ever caused was the removal of free trade, which was worse for the game than the bots themselves. As shitty as it is I kind of think they're a necessary evil. That being said lately it seems like certain niche bots are being allowed to run rampant while Jagex literally does nothing. They have to keep banning bots to keep their numbers in check, but they can never ban them all.
---
If you‚Äôre only doin 1 kill a trip yeah, but 2-3 is easily doable with decent mage and range levels.
---
Yeah basically this, while they executed it poorly they were forced to play the hand they had and quickly so we got what we got.
---
Clever lol

Your future is bright, I predict many more drops will come.

Btw btw. (I agree with you)

Idk why but I've also found agility levels fly by on my ironman accounts. Got 75 on my uim for basically free getting money for construction and the graceful set + recolours
---
What was Darkscape? Never heard of that one.
---
I'd just like to see a little bit more creativity once in a while, damn.
---
i mean, if i was a player who lost to this guy before his cheating got detected then yeah i would be pretty outraged
---
Back in the day before the GE the whole game was pseudo-ironman. Stuff that is super easy to just buy on the GE nowaday would have been way easier to just get yourself than to find someone that had a specific item and trade for it. That‚Äôs why a lot of long time players like Ironman mode

Easy fix by jagex, just gotta make splashing chance cap at 95% or something, so these rat splashers gotta find a new method.

I hear ya, this is not an idea lifestyle, I said that at the start. But its not a terible one either.

It's under interfaces I believe if you search in the plug-in menu. Once you find the plug-in there should be a checkbox next to something that says health or status bars. I can check into it more once I can get on my computer.

F2P was basically a chatroom.

I remember a lot of people in my school would just log on and chill in Varrock square chatting. Lots of them didn't even play the game, they just chatted.

[https://youtu.be/URU671Zeqqc](https://youtu.be/URU671Zeqqc) I searched and that's the first video I found of someone doing lavas with one alt. His alt is trading him essence every other lap.

Needing to manually trade would be a big enough barrier to stop a lot of my issues with TGE, but it's simply too convenient and overpowered.

where is the rest of the conversation? or you just want us to believe you are a "nice guy"

Sitting here smoking as I read reddit. 
---
Read this and instantly my brain is split between two thoughts.
---
Someone sitting at a PC with Runescale up, they type "brb" and next thing you know  they grab and suck a fat bong bowl, like a human vacuum, fast and strong af, and then just turning their head to shove a karambwan in their mouth and MONCH it.
---
Then I was like.. what's a karambwan look like IRL?
---
Sea urchin?

That's what I picture..

You have to be crazy to think that the end of GOT is as bad as Dexter. Dexter straight up has one of the worst endings in history.

Definitely recommend the tank route. I did the agility one and basically after every obsticle the path splits into two. One way is the right way, one way is the wrong way. If you choose the wrong way you fall and have to start over. Definitely do not recommend.
---
Shocking news: it turns out calling people "weird fuckers" doesn't come off well as a joke and gets people defensive. Not to mention calling me a dumbass for misinterpreting something over text is super unnecessary.
---
I actually agree. Not with making default accounts ironman (they should be able to trade) but with how GE trivializes so much of the game.
---
GE kind of makes the game unfun. People want a group ironman mode, but that's literally just base game minus GE.
---
I already fucking hate how much this is being posted.
---
Imagine if they didn't take a dump on their player base in December 2007.
---
You're going to get lots of shield left halves if you continue playing since they drop from basically everything. It's no big deal
---

Striker 162, 180, 279, and 420 are all taken, and Striker 1-1000 is done. The only likely one looks to be 279, but it could also be 162 if they decided to get their melee stats up recently.
---
Yeah, I'm playing a HCIM safe and easy, and I'm enjoying that. Here's the story behind the account:
---
I used to be an RS3 (reeeeeeeee) player, and made a HCIM on OSRS just for fun and maybe to chop some trees and burn some logs. I got burnt out of RS3 and switched to the OSRS account and wanted to see how far I could get, have some fun and stuff. I actually ended up enjoying OSRS more than RS3, and since I already had a HCIM, I decided to keep playing that. Furthermore, a childhood dream of me was to have a maxed account on Runescape, which I was never able to achieve. That is a dream I am currently chasing. With the upped ante of the Hardcore status of course.
---
I don't care about BIS items. I have like 2k kraken kc, and 50-60 thermy kc. I'm still rocking the dragon platelegs and other crap gear. I'm crap at PvM and I don't have a main to practice on. Therefore, I decided to just set myself the goal of maxing the HCIM, which I'm having a lot of fun with. Everyone plays the game their way, and I choose to limit myself in my own way on my account. Ironman btw.
---
That's about a 25. You only transported premade fire
---
I was under the impression that redwoods were like 400 and wt was 300, sorry I'll change it
---
when your farming and thieving is 99
---
Interesting, I'll see if I can find an official statement from them saying as such, thanks!
---
Lmao have you even seen the end of GOT?
---
I feel you. I had a gold-buying addiction that could have become toxic for my finances. I got hacked and it made me realise that I was just dumping money into bonds for items and currencies that wouldn't even bring me satisfaction. I then started an Ironman and not always looking for the most efficient / most gp per hour method just made my game experience far greater. I also realized that I don't waste time at the G.E looking at my bank or wondering what to do next, I know exactly what I'm gonna do before a game session and I enjoy it more!

10/10 would recommend trying.

I guess /u/yellowbananadude just doesn't understand that every person has fun in their own way, and that some people think that some achievements are more valuable to some than others. If I may give them some life advice, if you want to make friends anywhere, be a friend. Keep the negativity to yourself, and spread positivity. This way, everyone benefits.
---
Fall Jaeger
---
That's how you deter people from ending up as criminals. Amazing job, jagex.
---
Of course you are welcome to play how you want, I'm not saying Ironman bad or normal good but I'm arguing what you said about the GE and such. 
---
First, you obviously looked up quest guides to know the items you need and are complaining it's too easy? Then don't look them up. Suddenly the quests become a lot more difficult and interesting, especially ones such as underground pass or monkey madness that are insanely long and can suddenly be in the middle of a fight without your gear.  Some people only do quests for items or areas whereas others do them cause they usually are interesting or fun. Some people look up everything, others don't touch the wiki at all. 
---
Second there is a bunch of items that aren't tradable that people spend forever trying to get (Firecapes or clue scrolls for example). You can buy all the supplies you need but could just keep dying and never get it. While some bis(best in slot) items are buyable, it doesn't mean that you will always have enough to buy it. You said you have around ~60 mill ish but the twisted bow is 1.2 billion. Not to mention the quests and stat requirements needed to use some of them like the trident or dragon platebody.
---
Third, not everyone has 6 hours a day to play. Some people can only get on maybe an hour a day and if they have to spend weeks of that trying for 1 item then it's going to cause them to just not play anymore because then it becomes an endless loop that could have been solved by buying that 1 item. 
---
And finally just because you don't see the point in a skill doesn't mean it's useless. Lots of people like runecrafting and agility because it's relaxing and simple compared to doing other skills like Slayer. Some people like fighting monsters, others like just fishing and cooking. and the game allows you to do what you want. Not to mention the grand exchange only works because people have a location to sell the items they get instead of standing around waiting for some to buy their stuff at the price they want or to get ripped off cause all of the npc shops are overstocked. 
---
Defaulting to a mode that discourages interaction between players entirely will not help the new player experience at all and impede it even more.
---
This is not a dating website.
---
/r/Arcanists has remakes going
---
No it doesn't, go to the grand exchange and besides the usual scammers it usually contains people talking about best methods, helping new players, or just trying to one up each other. It may not always be direct but it's way better then 
---
Ironman can't trade other players at all, can't pick up other drops(that another player did 1 damage too) can't even gain experience from pvp, use group mini games or even go in a other players house. All that causes ironmen to stay away from other players and almost treat them almost as toxic for fear it will ruin their drops or xp rates.
---
Yup, black mirror.
---
Because that fucking dragon dropped me 3 jars of decay in 500 kills.

I want to get a mutagen too and vork don't drop those.

I disagree with the point in the edit. Dexter wasn‚Äôt a cumulative series, it wasn‚Äôt really leading up to something. It had season long arcs that had their own exposition and resolution. GOT had some arcs independent from the main endgame, but it was ultimately leading up to the long night and danys conquest, both of which they didn‚Äôt deliver well. Because of that, it seems much easier to rewatch early dexter than early GOT because you know the resolution will be trash, while dexter the resolution is independent from the early seasons‚Äô storylines mainly

\*braces for downvotes\*  
---
ya know, I kind of feel bad for rs3. It's truthfully not a bad mmo, even though I don't play it, and really the only reason its so low is because of how annoying the nO cHaNgEs crowd is of OSRS. If it were the first iteration of runescape, imo it'd probably be up there with FF in popularity.

Log out after wave 62 and take break to cool off. On jad, looking at his feet animations are infinitely better than relying on sound for the prayer switches imo. If a healer is in a position than you‚Äôd get pulled into jad to lure, just click the ground to reposition yourself between prayer switches.

It‚Äôs just a matter of not pre-switching prayer needlessly.

I agree, i dont see why it would be a big deal to have them show up on all courses.
---
This is a scam, to explain the scam basically someone comes up and says buying X item for X amount, and the amount is always WAY over what they are worth (They were 178 this morning, now 254 which means the scam worked) now what happened is over the past week/month the scammer bought tons of this item while it was low. Then he creates an artificial demand by saying he will pay way over GE for them.. and he does, at first. People buy the item for higher and higher which very quickly drives the price up, and sooner or later the supply is just straight up gone. Now the scammer is sitting there with his original pile, plus the hides he just bought from you at X rate. Now he raises the price (in this case 400 gp) to something he has no intention of paying to get people to start buying again, he then puts his in at like 300 or something and gets all of you to buy them, then when you go to sell to him he will be "busy" or he will just straight log (one common theme is to have an alt trade you so it always says they are busy atm). At the end of the day he sold all of his supply at a huge markup and you are left holding leather you cant do anything with except dump back in the ge for a major loss.

I'd probably be more or less whatever about it since I'm pretty casual about the game. I worry, as I think Jagex does, that with roughly 90% of the player base on some client banning then would have a very negative effect on the short and long term of the game.
---
Ik this is a RuneScape subreddit but it's very similar to weakauras in World of Warcraft. It's an add-on framework that is very powerful at building helpful mods for whatever you need. At this point Blizzard either had to accept it because to remove weakauras would be to neuter the player base.
---
If I‚Äôm not wrong wasn‚Äôt that a suggestion posted on this sub from a year or two ago??? So did RS3 take an OSRS idea and implement it lol.

I think theyve talked about it before and said it wasnt easy to do in OS. I really wish they would do it though it looks amazing.

Demon slayer requires getting a key through the drain or something like that if I remember right, wiki doesn‚Äôt mention if the key respawns in the sewer or if you have to flush the drain from the start again, so I see why op would be lost.  Especially a low level going into the sewers could potentially be a bad time.

Tbow zulrah &gt; dhcb vork &gt; trident/bp zulrah &gt; bgs+bp vork, especially if you don‚Äôt woox walk and have a pb or 2:10

I highly recommend selling something and getting a trident of the swamp, it‚Äôs a really big upgrade for zulrah

I‚Äôm sorry what‚Äôs elitist about having game knowledge? You did something dumb. Yeah, it feels bad, but you‚Äôre going to be ok. Get over it, make it into a zerker or something, and move on with your life.
---
Probably. We will see how it goes.
---
Oh my god
---
Just go on a pvp world I doubt there will be bots.
---
Gz!

High effort. This has potential.

All in.

Why would you stop at 60

Lol. Government smart.

thx :)

I tried it after the youtuber put out that video, I got 3 in 12 hours, definitely not fucking worth it in the slightest unless you have a horseshoe up your ass.

If you‚Äôre an Ironman and need it for diary, my deepest condolences.

I actually like them, but I'm sure itll get annoying after a few days.

That‚Äôs pretty sweet

If you want to get over 5k GP per task konar

That‚Äôs what I thought as well. But I‚Äôm only 100kc and the last 25 kills have consistently been 3mins.

Megatron back at it

If you google it will say the tomb at Shilo village in search results, but this was just changed not too long ago after the last DMM fuckery.  Learned that the hard way yesterday after wasting some chins there.  Kourend is really the best option, or if you can round up friends to do clan wars with you and just get them to be honest sacks for you it might work
---
Ugh I wish
---
Shut up
---
What? That‚Äôs only 500k members and we almost always have 100k online. Makes perfect sense to me
---
two words, engine work
---
So this is a bad idea because of the spoiled brats afk. Dont play then

I‚Äôd go with Konar for sure.

Another option is law runes via balloon transport. Finish Enlightened Journey, unlock to route to Castle Wars and you're set. It's more afk than any running and almost as fast as Abyss rc. It's decent money 500k/h) and half of the run is afk.
---
This is vorkath, unlocked after you complete dragon slayer 2
---
It would probably kill you tbh. Go train on chickens/cows until your CB lvl 20 or so.

I need this for Weed Lit. He‚Äôs not even close to 99 firemaking or herblore tho :(
---
ok
---
Ohw damn, now I see. Thanks!
---
If you fight a mage, use leather armor. Metal armor actually make magic more accurate against you.
---
What levels are you? Might be better to bust out some better levels before trying it. I don't really remember how hard demon slayer is tbh
---
Omfg lmfao !!
---
I feel like the Farming cape is one of the more impressive untrimmed capes to have.

Has it still crashed?

True

---
Obor's drops are essentially identical in f2p and p2p (members also get ensouled giant heads, but that doesn't interfere with the main drop).
---
It's bryophyta whose drop table is influenced by f2p vs p2p - in p2p bryo can drop the essence, as well as blood runes &amp; seeds etc. So the chances of rune armour drops are lower in p2p (and bizarrely enough bryo only drops the rune full helm in f2p).

Ahh that's why the security questions are so old...

Its wierd though, the past week there have been alot of posts of this exact same situation.

Just to add a few details to this but he targeted odd stakers at the duel arena who had 50bil banks and even to this day it's impossible for anyone besides Jed/whoever he was working with to know the full extent. We do know that a little over 900b was refunded from screenshots/recordings of jagex spawning gp but those are just the cases of 100% jed related accounts. Most likely there were cases of hijacked accounts there were probably hijacked by Jed/friends but couldn't be confirmed with 100% certainty so the actual amount he made off rwting will never be known.

Quest, if you don't have the stats for the next quest then train for it and do it. Get a quest cape.

This is sad, I find there are too many distractions from reality that cause people to lose touch with their goals and aspirations. Runescape helps with that I've found, it's all about that.

Underrated post.

In Snuggle Quest‚Äôs YouTube guide she takes the tank route. It was actually pretty easy following her guide. I‚Äôd recommend that, especially considering the 55 agility.

The hardest part of MM2 is the platform. It just takes a little patience. 
---
Like others are saying, with 99 range, you are going to put the smack down on Glough.
---
I think it's just funny that you think his comment is kind of annoying when he made a very basic statement that could be annoying if you personally take it as such.
---
  
---
So your "answer" honestly just sounds like a personal problem.
---
I wish this shit happened to me too, it sucks that I don't get lucky like that. Am I a pouting child now too?

Your answer just came off so arrogant.

Two words, not really

Oh yeah? Say that to it's face.

I use it as my spec weapon almost any time I'm fighting a large opponent. A single spec often kills a gargoyle at once, you can hit over 100 on kril.

Our game has a massive trading bug. Can't wait for more info on this. Wish I was an insider and could use this tbh.

Yes, it freezes the whole OS on my macbook pro.

Is this a dexters lab reference? Not sure if it's just me who remembers that episode so vividly.

Tried to line them up but idk how and it caused me some panic with jad trying to rape my brains out at the same time. I just killed them 1 at a time. My DPS is high enough

Wasn't he just at the after party? Nothing to do with jagex
---
Duradel is objectively the best master for xp and for profit.
---
Absolutely. If they want this boss to appeal to mid level players and ease them in to bossing, allowing max combat players to steal their kill midway through won't do them any favors, and could make these players feel like they can't go bossing until they're max combat. That would defeat the purpose of the niche they were trying to fill here.
---
Are you killing it for a Slayer task? What are your combat and Slayer levels? Definitely bone crossbow over iron darts lol.
---
oh yeah jagex please make an update for the one weirdo thats walks around with 100k chocolates no offense lol
---
Buying such a service can get you banned. So my advice would be to not risk your account because of the frustration of not being able to complete something as quick as you wanted to.
---
The thing about Jad is that it's the first boss in OSRS which requires you to be conservative with your actions, and not act in an impulse of panic. It's usually the nerves that causes you to lose the overview of the situation and make fatal mistakes. 
---
Best advice I can give you is to stay really try to stay calm. Use your F keys for switching between inventory and prayer book, and limit yourself to 1 action per Jad attack. 1 action meaning 1 sip of a potion, or attacking 1 healer. 
---
So wait for an attack, switch prayers if needed, do 1 action if needed, switch back to prayer book, wait for the next attack. 
---
And take your time. Even if it takes too long to deal with the healers and Jad heals back to full HP, all that time dealing with it is valuable practice for the next attempt.
---
Damn that is nice. I just got to 85. Any tips on the harder quests like ds2 or mm2?
---
People saying Konar either don't know what task weights are, or have like 50 slayer.
---
If you can use Duradel, you probably should.
---
its the posts like this and all of the constant anti pker sentiment that actually makes me not feel bad about killing people in wild, even if they have nothing or just a clue, its posts like these that remind me there is no reason to have any mercy.
---
Downvote on your post because they are funny!
---
Have you ever been outside

Just did it with a brine sabre for another goddamn rockslug task. Felt amazing to massacre the fuckers quickly with an expeditious bracelet + the sabre and then make a profit on the rental

\&gt;The thing is he could have kept getting away with it too, but did some really obvious stupid shit and got caught

What was it he did that got him caught?

Posts like this will guarantee that people still vote no to pvp polls

Not the worst one

I don't understand what would be complicated about it, all they need to do is make new models?

This needs to happen. Bring back the real Clan Wars. Have risk fights outside the sz.

Slayer? - Farming? - you think you can harm me? - with 99 defense I'm a 1 man army - I solo theatre of blood homie its alarming - I also got a runescape GF she says I'm charming
---
great thing about rs is you can stop playing come back have fun and log out and few months later you come back to fresh content so yeah play a little a day and when u have some free time you can really grind out and enjoy higher level content even for 1 hour a day high level content is fun

"permed"

This is the only topic concerning that meme that won't be getting a downvote from me.

I got the pet drop twice, the second time it says ‚Äúyou have a funny feeling like you would have been followed ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt get another drop it just pops up in the chat box

Lmao, thought you were making a bot farm joke. Didnt even notice the animation.

Wtf, though. Are they really like this? You're telling me the case worker could look at this: https://i.imgur.com/1nUzVwb.jpg

Also Bryo is easier in f2p because it doesn‚Äôt poison I think

Yeah, I'm not a fan of it either. I think we should have fewer worlds and bump up the total players for member worlds to at least 2500.

Ask mod ash to marry you guys, he is a wizard

I wanted to help communicate how I felt when the pet finally came. Looks like I got the job done lol.

such a bold and thoughtful comment

All of the loot.

Jeez that‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm making 600k+ doing addy bars in blast furnace. Guess I‚Äôll working on skilling until Zulrah and Vorkath rather than trying to knock out that whole diary.
---
The numbers stayed like that dispite real number of players going down. And then we had the bot nuke and every world went down to like 100 players it was awesome
---
This isn't even a repost from a long time ago
---
Roughly 1/3rd player base for rs3

 but I am still so annoyed that the twisted bow is the superior weapon for so many high level bosses!!!!

this is also just not true, like raids and hydra not vorkath, zulrah, tob or sire.

How the fuck do people manage to lose their clue? Just take clue, spade, dds with you, if you need to bring more use a clue box they're dirt cheap. Literally 0 risk of losing your clue ever.

Thanks for the good wishes! I'm slowly but surely grinding out the essentials, spreading out the skills, looking into quest unlocks and what the "meta" is for OSRS. It'll be a bit of a journey, but a fun one for sure.
---
You've got to take into considering that ALL skills in RS3 have a cosmetic 120 cape. People these days don't go for 99's, they go for 120s, so it kind of evens itself out a bit.
---
Just viewed your reddit profiel¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Also good luck trying to learn the game, am level 93 and still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Honestly that‚Äôs my favorite part of this game tho
---
Best way to train magic from 83 without MM2 done and without losing too much gold? Also off task. I'm thinking using my highest burst spell on Nechs in Kourend dungeon. Is that correct?

Lmao

No. Bot farm is dumping their balls before ban

---
Who the fuck gets married without meeting first? Obviously he has physically been with her and seen her
---
Well that means messing with the formula for magic accuracy which is harder and maybe there are some things in the game that could affect unintentionally like some sort of quest you aren't supposed to be able to use magic or something idk.
---
From a development standpoint I would think it's easier to just adjust XP for consecutive splashes on the same mob. It would have a quite tiny impact on people legitimately using magic because they have to splash twice in a row for it to be relevant and even then it would be like a 10% decrease. Could even give a 1-2% splash xp boost to compensate.
---
It would need to be worked so as to not hamper people legitimately training magic through curse or stun/alching etc though.
---
I think they just don't wanna do anything about splashing though tbh now. Magic can be a drag to train if you aren't bursting/barraging, and that can be downright expensive if not done through greater nechs which have a pretty hefty requirement of 80 slayer.
---
THE LOWER THE BETTER
---
Except we don't know if MTX = bonds as well, because if that's the case OSRS greatly outshines RS3. Not to mention some players were grandfathered into osrs with rs3 $5/month membership prices from back in the day, because they've never canceled their memberships.  Those are counted for rs3, even if they no longer player rs3 anymore and just play osrs (which means they would cancel their membership if not for osrs).
---
Even if MTX is exclusively counted for RS3, if you take 2018 that will mean RS3 earned 47M and OSRS earned 42M, but the entire profit Jagex had was 45.1M, so we can assume that RS3 costs more than 5M more than OSRS in Employees/Developers, Upkeep costs, Servers since their team is much more than just twice as large.  If MTX includes bonds and if you take into consideration the grandfathered memberships, RS3 makes WAY less than OSRS.
---
So in reality, OSRS profits more than RS3, despite it not being "the main game" and the main focus of Jagex, and the trend shows that every year OSRS is earning more and more while RS3 is earning less and less, and as things are OSRS is ALREADY earning more than RS3 if you take into account the costs RS3 brings to the table.
---
He could of framed Framed but he had to settle with Settled.
---
It's better than all the other "2 type if skills" memes.
---
I get the sentiment, but what solution would you propose?
---
I wasn't thinking about myself, more so new players with bad magic gear, getting their low level grind punished by a change to the xp.
---
No. This isn‚Äôt rs3

It was kind of a joke, my man. I know he isnt going to actually just look at a game hes completely unfamiliar with and stamp it off because it doesnt appear to be a marriage broker.
