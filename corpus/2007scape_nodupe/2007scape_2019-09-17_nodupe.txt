People only use torva to make t92 armour now. Masterwork armour t90 is lots cheaper to use.

---
Heh I did fear a reply of that type, but I decided to be honest about it anyways.  Considering the NPC's are already there and that this is already their purpose, it just seems to make sense.  Thanks :)
---
God dammit. Now I have to go do that elite that's been in my bank for 3 days.
---
Sawmill Operator or Perdu.
---
It‚Äôs not inane. It devalues his achievement. It‚Äôs like playing a sport or e-sport and climbing to the top only to learn half the people there cheated. It feels unfair and ruins the experience.
---
if they had a quest that brought a rogue banker here, I would always bank skill here.
---
Wtf lmfao are you seriously trolling me or something? I'm not about to go on with this shit so we can just agree to disagree from here on out but I can't believe how small minded you seem about this situation.
---

---
Just because I used black people as an example you think that I truly believe black people are the only ones that have been victims of racism and oppression in the past? Idk where you jumped to that conclusion but it's delusional to say the least.
---
And I'm not talking about some big bad racists jerks saying some mean words to you that you think you're too big for racism now. I'm talking about actual violence, profiling, discrimination, and biases because of a person's race. With the examples you've given me it's hard to believe you've ever been a victim of any of these things.
---
You think just cause some racist said some naughty words to you that you are now enlightened on how to stop racism?
---
I'm not even going to comment about your views on the civil Rights movement or whatever you think would be happening today if there wasn't one.
---
 Also, if you're just talking about people saying racists things online or whatever then I agree with you. I don't think people should react to those types of people because they are obviously edgelords who are doing it to get a reaction out of people. But racism is far more than just that, and I don't think you can see beyond that.
---
I think the next major update needs to be offline, downloadable mode. Even if they charge. I want to be able to play this game for a long time and it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to at this rate.
---
75 def nh kr even main nh you can hits 0s off pray all day and 30s on prays. 
---
The higher def you go the more rng it is and less skill, i think the only people who would want this would be wildy pvmers and pure that try def nh for the first time.

ahh, that explains it. 
---
I was killing 2 skeles and a worm, is that correct? not sure which gives 86.8 on the dot
---
Because there are.
---
Any other RS3 players lowkey disappointed that they pretty much copied the quest word for word from Plagues End?
---
You don't have to pick up the pet.
---
Probita is an NPC located in the small building next to Aemad's Adventuring Supplies.. Probita runs the pet insurance bureau, and will insure a player's pet at a one-time cost of 500,000 coins per pet. If a player loses their pet, and it is insured by Probita, they may reclaim the pet for 1,000,000 coins.
---
Because models behave so differently. Everything is not just one model. It's much safer to check every npc that can appear here, manually and make sure scuba is correctly applied. Than to make a general code to add scuba to everything. I can't believe this is not common sense to you? But maybe you haven't been around as long as some of us. Yet you have the audacity to voice such a retarded opinion when you know you're new? Don't speak again please.
---
Damn bro I felt bad just reading that. If you ever see him again give him the cash and maybe some futa pics.
---
Just do separate trips. You're trying to force something that's going to take 5 minutes. If you die it takes 20 extra minutes
---
Don‚Äôt think I ever read a single text box. I‚Äôm saddened that I‚Äôm not immersed into my favorite game since playing it all the way back from 2006 till now. :(
---
Let's not be hasty
---
If you hop worlds, it's actually good smithing xp. just sayin'
---
"Extreme Alchemy" - Provides 150xp/cast, for low alch GP, and a heavier cost. 
---
Becomes the new alchemy meta, providing less gold into the economy than high alching, and costing more. Would be effectively 180k xp/h, though there should be a sufficient cost to offset this.
---
and maybe we should update bronze to rune armour so it looks straight out of an anime üßêü§î
---
Can the Drake's fireball attack charge the DFS? It doesn't charge it at all, despite the DFS partially protecting from it.
---
PVP'ers are a really fragile breed aren't they. They're toxic AF when they are attacking you 3 on 1 whilst you do a clue scroll risking 5k, then they cry like little whiney babies when people vote no in their little polls. It's simply karma.
---
You won‚Äôt make money before level 65 slayer anyway. But definitely work on range and magic. You want to be able to safespot to save money on food
---
[removed]
---
Did you ever train in the range guild?
---
If you don't mind leaving your desktop on your whole shift, id recommend just running runelite at home and maintaining nmz with a remote access app. That way you can lock your phone or use the GPS without it disconnecting you.
---
Have you pked??? Bolts hit through pray all day. Pull up rev caves in like 150k bolt rag risk and zgs. Take a couple bois with you and youll see what i mean. Ot take 14 brews, bolt rag with ags/gmaul to rev ent and bolt rag a single pker down through pray.
---
Also in def pking you can hit 0 off pray all the time because defence rng
---
They're equal afk.
---
You just had to use bronze armour didn't you. Racist pig.
---
Killing the lesser demon in Wizards' Tower and telegrabbing the chain were the good old days
---
I'd suggest you level fishing to 58 and then try barbarian fishing.
---
Not even at drop rate
---
Yeah i realize i need a decent amount of slayer to profit. Just wanted to figure out which stats i should be training while i‚Äôm still in f2p.
---
Other ones I was considering.
---
AlKarhid gate guard.
---
Lumbridge General store.
---
Brimhaven dungeon toll.
---
No, just tested it.
---
Honestly, I feel bad for skipping through it because of the time devs spent on it but st the same time, I've never enjoyed questing. It's just a chore to me.
---
Your "statement" does nothing to address my point: a total of 50,000 experience in a skill should not be the line in the sand for surviving in this game.
---
I watched some of that meeting that was referenced in the shitty response from Jagex. Besides all the disingenuous answers, there were two things that I laughed at most:
---
1) when asked why osrs doesn't have MTX, they gave a long winded answer which essentially stated the community would destroy the company if implemented (they also stated that 2\3 of their income stream is through subscriptions, the other third through "additional services" such as MTX etcetera). Go us!
---
2) when asked why they have a 6 hour log. Oh boy this one was funny because the questioner was rather blunt. "Why do you even have a timer at all?" he asked. He was obviously a lawyer because his line of questioning was very forward and was setting them up to contradict themselves.
---
Both of the reps from Jagex (already forget their names, not going back to check)  sort of fumbled through their answers, giving the old "because we care about the community and want them to take a break every so often" - which the questioner flipped and reversed, trying to force them to acknowledge that they're aware of the mental health related effects of long gaming sessions. 
---
The guy from Jagex says that if someone was reading a book for 6 hours, "I'd probably tell them to take a break. 
---
And this whole ballet, all in the name of not saying that they implemented the forced log as a boring measure lmao
---
Only time I skip is when a quest is in the wilderness.
---
Do pking clans also require applicants to pass a pking test?
---
Your argument makes no sense.  Writing generic scuba code and checking if it renders properly on your npcs is not mutually exclusive.  This is a very basic OO concept, and even a basic programming concept.
---
You asked if scythes were tradable.
---
Dude it's been like 10 years ago, get with the fads. When this generation grows up 2013 dubstep is gonna be "classics"
---
seen and heard so many people say it was awful to do, both on here and in game, never really heard anyone say it was easy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My first back in the day was woodcutting, my first on OSRS was strength
---
Nice!
---
You could try the ones you use in the wildy.
---
"Sit, idiot"
---
Except you dont say idiot
---
woodcutting. i think on my rs3 acc its like 108 or something high af now. i think i quit for a few months a time or two during the grind.
---
What we really need is a whole graphical rework.
---
The shadow gem series has always been cosmetic stuff. Even if it does have stats it's worse and more expensive than regular t80. 
---
If you want to complain about the mtx model then complain about them nerfing skill xp while increasing th xp at the same time
---
gz man, one of my favourite pets üòä
---
I've jumped ship.
---
I've absolutely had enough. I can't keep up with it anymore. Holiday events are month-long promotions where if you miss a day or two, you need to buy event currency with RuneCoins which cost money. I can't tell which updates are actually updates or which are new promotions. It's now beyond a joke. The back of my camel broke ages ago but it's hard leaving behind a game you've had so many friends in, spent so much time playing, and have so many memories in it. But it's done now. I'm pretty much done with RS3.
---
The content that comes is mostly DoA. Mining and Smithing rework was honestly the last thing they did that made me think that Jagex still cares. 
---
IGN is Wizardmon. If anyone wants a new friend learning the game again (I've not played this style properly in well over 7 years!), hit me up!
---
We dont say that word here. 
---
I mean the c word.
---
Dungeoneering would be cool but sont talk about the c word weapons.
---
First ever 99 was fletching, followed by strength back in 08.
---
First on OS was magic.
---
Don‚Äôt forget you will be getting a lot of combat XP in your slayer grind. So whatever you do, make sure you account for that. The best way to train combat is through slayer
---
Max portal nexus worth grinding the extra level for? Just got 83 the other day but honestly think the second best nexus is just fine for now
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Well at least he earned it on his own.
---
Right?
---
I still haven‚Äôt been to the Prif mine but I‚Äôm assuming they have a regular respawn rate. The rocks in the mining guild have double the respawn speed so that‚Äôs why it seems like it may be slower in Prif. If you‚Äôre looking to power mine iron for xp then the mining guild is still the place to do it.
---
It does not function the same

---
If you have a Discord, they can get you into the channel!
---
Damn, and it's a good flexing piece. Gz, alch yourself.
---
That would imply that the app is going to be released. Winter 2017 btw
---
if your cb stats are up for it, for the earlier slayer lvls go for wildy slayer. normal slayer doesnt really bring any money in until around mid 60's. whereas wildy offers emblems and larrans keys right for the get go, great points too.
---
also range is great for alot of tasks, unless im bursting I dont tend to use mage.
---
id reccomend doing the slug menace questline asap for proselyte armour (will save you a tonne of money on ppots)
---
He says ‚Äòcya‚Äô but in reality that guys gonna be talking again in 2 hours lmao
---
He faked his death
---
Boy are you gonna look stupid when they badly implement a fix for this in 6 months
---
Explosions are usually typeless or magic damage. I guess protect from missiles would help if you got hit by the actual missile, but you'd have to tick-eat or switch to protect from magic immediately afterward.
---
Your loss
---
Uhh 99 everything here I come ?
---
was clearly a joke
---
I used to pk a lot before EOC came out and really liked it. I want to pk again but I'm hearing the game is really different now and that there are only sweaty people that pvp now and that pvping is dead. Is this true? I'm afraid of taking a few months to make an account only to find out that it's not as fun as before.
---
Thanks guys!
---
Oh man it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen this one and it was perfect üëå that‚Äôs that good shit right there oh boy üí®
---
I knew this girl who I thought I was good friends with, but she slowly but surely became one of those people who has their private off because "too many people talk to [her]" when it's on. Then I saw her in priff even though she has been logged off in my friends list for months. How nice. This is why I quite literally have no friends.
---
140m for 2 weeks actually
---
MY VENEZUELAN FRIENDS DISAGREE WITH YOU SIR.
---
Wow talking crap about the nicest person in the clan (lotus).
---
What did you do?
---
&gt;At this point the rs3 player base is almost entirely the hardcore fans of the game. The controversies don't matter, they will continue to play
---
It's more like the players who don't care, don't care.  But every time jagex pushes the line, more and more players who are on the fence quit, I'm sure there is a point where it becomes unsustainable
---
Yep!!
---
lance is better money and chiller, just a little slower kills and you gotta count on your spec but it‚Äôs chiller imo

---

---

---
Because you don't have to be a genius to figure out that RS source code is a complete mess and a nightmare to maintain. Which is the reason why there can't or are reluctant to update their 20 year old legacy login system to improve account security.
---
That would be great, maybe it'd promote the use of the built in auto typing feature the game has (most players dont even know it exists because you can't see other players' autochat with it off by default)
---
Nice! Zombies are my slayer task haha
---
Read the comments before you comment on them. If all the bots in go to that one furnace it makes it easier to tell they are bots and ban them

I‚Äôm not even maxed lol. I‚Äôm 5 skills away on RS3 (Thieving, woodcutting, cooking, invention, and fire making),  but I wanna give OSRS a try since it is what I grew up on.

Oh no honey what is you doin
---
Why are steel arrows constantly more expensive than mithril arrows even if they‚Äôre weaker? The prices for both hover around 31 and 20 respectively.
---
Jagex‚Äôs hand is being forced due to the players who vote no to any and all PvP updates because they are upset they die in the wild.
---
Can we add tournament worlds forever it‚Äôs fun fighting friends
---
Bruh this idea is lit
---
Pay attention people, don‚Äôt be that guy who boosts before using the portal. I‚Äôve seen youtubers do it and it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful to those who spend literal MINUTES cleaning your fucking grimy herbs. The nerve of some people.
---
Wee woo wee woo this the police open up. I smell rannar

How?

I find it awesome aussies built the crabs their own bridge lol.
---
Password reuse attacks happen when a website you have an account with gets hacked. Eventually most of the account information from these hacked websites ends up available to the public through various means. If you have the same login in details on another service, someone taking a giant list of leaked credentials could have gained access to your account. You can check if an email of yours appears in any leaks at haveibeenpwned.com, it is rin by a security researcher, you can look it up before using it if you want. The best way to avoid this is using unique passwords.
---
Why can pmods get it? That makes absolutely no sense lol
---
But runelite has a calculator?
---
Trade one in for another box?
---
Yeah ghosting is one of the shittiest things a person can do
---
No, it‚Äôs not even close. Sports are designed to be and are inherently competitive. An RPG is not designed to be competitive. It is a role playing game. If you make it a competition then the onus is on you, but that is not the intention of the game. You are only competing insofar as your direct interaction with those bots in game (via skilling or I guess if you‚Äôre trying to kill green dragons) or your indirect interaction via the resources they are gathering. The only way I could understand this argument is if you were trying to participate in the same types of activities that bots were and they were outcompeting you. But simply having higher levels doesn‚Äôt affect you at all. That‚Äôs like saying that your neighbors who are cheating on their taxes are ruining/devaluing your life, when really it‚Äôs your *need* to compete with your neighbors that is. Botting sucks, but if it ruins your experience out of envy of their progress then you must have a very superficial enjoyment of the game to begin with.

People who PK at the Wildy Agility course: why? You realize the people there risk basically nothing right? You do know that the runes / ammunition you just fired into my groin for 43 damage are worth more than the 8 sardines you'll get from me. Why am I worth skulling over?
---
I really hope this gets an answer. Would help give skilling more of a purpose, they need unique rewards.

Oh shit I remember I was moving and was gonna end up with no computer for a while, was happy as shit when they said it was winter cause I would end up just playing on my phone. Ended up straight quitting the game cause I had nowhere to play for a couple months

Man I hate it when I accidentally sip a pot right b4 the timer clicks down, wasting a whole boost is another level

Do you agree stuff like this should be removed from the collection log?  It's just sad that most of the log items are reasonable but there are a few outliers like Chicken, 3a and Dragonstone armor that make it basically impossible to complete the log.

It is helpfull. I confirm that it is not possible yet.

Funny story of how I got my heron yesterday. 
---
So I got 65 attack and strength and decided to go for the Dragon defender. After about 30 kills I was astonished that I didn‚Äôt get my bronze defender yet, so I scrolled my chat bar up and there I see the valuable drop text, I afk‚Äôd and forgot to pick it up. I kill another 20 cyclops and no luck, I gave up and I decided to try again later. 
---
Discouraged I decided to afk Karambwans (lvl 72 fishing btw) to make some money. 7 karambwans later I see a heron and I‚Äôm not shocked at all because I knew that it was someone else‚Äôs. Nonetheless I decide to right click it for shits and giggles and I see a pick-up option. Then I right clicked my fishing spot to see if any other players are fishing and it was only me. Excitedly, I right clicked my heron and picked up that shit. I wasn‚Äôt going crazy like I thought I would, instead I was in shock of how I went from not getting a fucking BRONZE defender to getting a heron.
---
So basically auras from RS3?

this, people are fucking stupid
---
An hour length boost to DPS in that kinda level will easily be the new norm in PvM. Divine Potions proved this. Rigour and Augury proved this. It wouldn't be purely PvP.
---
"Nothing forcing you to use them" is a bad excuse for content that pushes the new norm into using it.
---
I'm not forced to use a tbow but is the meta at over half the bosses involving it? Sure is.
---
Doesn't make it ok
---
I tried it and I found that while Prifddinas indeed offered marginally better xp over Ardy, it was just a little more click intensive than I'd like. Additionally, I can't make use of the crystal shards with my current stats, so the \~30m profit from marks of grace was more appealing. Ardy is a small little course that I can click through without having to turn the camera at all, allowing me to run Youtube or an alt account on the side and still maintain the max xp rate.
---
I knew hoarding all my clue rewards would pay off eventually.
---
Just for context Full torva(with boots and gloves) is 160m RS3, if one would swap that over to osrs he would end up with 30m osrs. 
---
Doesn't sound that bad tbh. (Ironman can't use treasure hunter on rs3, so everyone else could just buy it at ge)
---
I‚Äôm convinced that the developers must have written that one because the whole quest is literally just an exercise in recursion.
---
I never pvp, but still id say i vote yes to things i believe would benefit the pvp scene.  But some things are just stupid, a lot of the balance changes back and forth for the sake of doing something, while its never been an issue before seems pointless...
---
Cold War.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs stupid... people are dumb when I say we should allow players to transfer bonds between osrs and rs3. They say it will wreck the economy. 100% false. It cannot destroy the economy any more than buying a bond for 6$ will and selling it in game.
---
In fact it would be the first gold sink implemented into both games at the same time. 
---
It opens the door for other ideas like XP earned in OSRS to be added to your RS3 account(and xp already earned would be transferred as well)(FORWARD CAPABILITY)
---
*** NOT RS3 XP TO OSRS ***
---
Yes for btw, no for non-restricted.  Kraken is still around 4m a task if extended even without uniques

They can't just ban them because you think they're bots. They have to follow the procedure. The system has to identify them as bots, they need to check up on it. I don't think Weath would waste his time looking up these bots manually, while there are methods worth way more that need attention.
---
Revs, Zulrah, a few others all have 1m+ p/h. Compared to 150k/hr. They do get banned btw, just not instantly.
---
Mishtalin mystery will always be my favorite just because of the godsword sitting 2 blocks from the player and not being able to pick it up
---
Ill take that trade.   3952 no pet
---
I'm so glad someone else read Rum Deal. That quest was amazing
---
Good riddance.
---
Nice bait ngl
---
but it wasnt the wilderness back then, it was a nice area like misthalin or asgarnia, it only became the wilderness later
---
Here they go trying to add the same rewards that failed in another poll
---
No, it's my first and only Fight Caves. I am able to have the task because I've unlocked Hot Stuff on slayer rewards shop.
---
I stabbed his dragon cloaca with a DHL
---
It‚Äôs been sub 1k for a while now
---
Don‚Äôt log into a pvp world then
---
I‚Äôm talking more about like someone using a dds to do a slayer task and I say ‚Äúyou should use a dragon long‚Äù and if they talk back I‚Äôll say to aim to do monkey madness, not just straight up telling someone they‚Äôre doing it wrong. 
---
I‚Äôm no master of the game myself, but I want to help people not make the same mistakes I did years ago, not just stand on a pedestal and mock them.
---
when i got 99 slayer i was 99 mage, 99 str, 99 range, 97 att, and 95 def. i cannoned a lot and still barraged after 99 mage on defensive. i trained a lot at crabs and nmz tho. you most likely will be in the 90s range by 99 slayer
---
&gt; Quite rare that PDC is actually well designed, but this one is.
---
you are very dumb if you think these are anywhere near balanced
---
Yikes
---
Jesus... what does your therapist think about this?
---
Looks great
---
if you read they do stack, and that makes them very stupidly OP
---
Why would you want to remove it?
---
Ahaha I like this
---
Lol the only reason I ever play rs is for quests.
---
pkers dont want to get baited amd raped by q clan u mean.
---
Most, but not all. For instant, the absolute best melee armour in RS3 is Trimmed Masterwork Armour. It's repairable by using unused pieces of its lesser variant Masterwork Armour on the relevant piece, along with some Divine Charges as well if it's augmented.
---
I think you're a little too attached to a "girl" on runescape lol
---
You were the most obvious worthless mercher. So obnoxious.
---
&lt;3
---
these are already completely broken with 1hr timer, theyre just stupid permanent
---
Pretty easy to melee too, since you can hop over to nature grotto to refill Prayer, although it is a bit less AFK
---
Gratz! What other 99s do you have?
---
Also what is your bank pin and social security number?
---
Right click is equal to back on Android, so I'm still not sure if it will require some extra tweaking or something
---
Can we please look at reducing the drop rate of clues? These are really difficult to obtain compared to other clues and the rewards are not even that great.
---
We have enough stupid ass cosmetic clue rewards
---
10400+ no pet, will it happen? 12 claws btw
---
Photowhat?
---
idk why this is downvoted, it's perfect r/comedyheaven
---
Show green stack cash

Decline second window

Say ‚Äútest‚Äù trade 100-200k
---
They double it
---
Take money and run
---
???
---
Profit
---
I dislike the idea of prayers that "degrade" but I think a really neat way of making this work would be to only have one of the god spells available at a time, and if you wanted to switch you would have to consume another god scroll, losing the original prayer.
---
&gt;At what Smithing will Will Smith smith Will Smith?

I'd say mainly just questing. A lot of content is locked behind quests.

That too. Singles PKing (deep wildy) is dominated by clans.
---
You typed a supremely dumb message, nice
---
You should shave my dude lmao
---
Im not exploiting my status for it, i put it on medium when i made the sheet originaly cause i did the same thing on my mage only ironman before ever getting somewhere on youtube. A lot of people are talking about this but im having a hard time understanding why its such a big issue as even at higher tiers ill have to run with teams while having subpar gear, do i just never do raids then? I only put it on medium cause i thought it would be a fun thing to do early on. As for the protection, i did the crazy arch on stream, druids was just coincidence cause the guy was working on 99 str.
---
Good idea, helps abit with bots and gives maybe nice drops to people who kills them.
---
NICE!!!
---
Cache
---
i thought this was a mech from some osrs youtuber.
---
Is that the ‚Äúscream‚Äù quest? If so holy shit that one had me rolling.
---
Sure can. After enabling flash you head to idle notification&gt;hitpoints notification then enter the amount of hitpoints you would like it to notify you  at. Can also do it for prayer and change the amount of idle time before you get the flashes.
---
oh wait fuckin crumb uploaded this lmao
---
No you don't have to wait for it to wear off (just like any other boost bro) the reason you only saw 3 so far is probably just because 4 and 5 are pretty rare. It could take up to an hour before you see the +5 you want
---
Please stop misusing the word troll he's just having some fun for the laughs
---
Also worth mentioning if the stew drains your stats you can drink a super restore.
---
No way they would buff range even further but nice idea
---
These are rs3 curse prayers level of strong.  Def not happy with what soul split did to the game. Don't think we need strong stuff like this in the game yet. Maybe a few years down the line if there's some separation between content difficulty and player difficulty and they are looking for ways to make players stronger without adding weapons and armor
---
I just started watching your vids a couple days ago after meeting you at [ba](https://www.imgur.com/revqwKl) and you're the only osrs content producer I've actually enjoyed watching. Not only are your videos interesting but they're so well presented and I think you have a great taste in music. Plus nathan for you is the funniest show I've ever seen and I'm not surprised that you'd relate to his irony. I laughed through this whole vid and to me you're very relateable so I'll continue watching whatever you put out. Thanks for the entertainment
---
thanks
---
Welcome to the club!
---
Nearly there mate after hydra it gets stupid fast.. Just keep at it!
---
He has 1800 cb and yes that is his cannon
---
Had to pull out the 99% on em
---
1800 total? Lmao
---
I'll share my thoughts later this week
---
Can we fuck off with this shit already? Its borderline spam...
---
Hold your horses goblin boy I think you where missing the point of what I said. I could see your brain was firing on all 6 brain cells figuring out how to join our conversation before it posted a crash file and spat out that message.
---
every time you get a duplicate while you have that specific pet out, it puts another stack on top of the pet
---
I think your math is off there buddy
---
&gt; It can act as a small gold sink too
---
You're putting that in as a meme right?
---
&gt;I love the penguin quest dialog. Also the average RS player can't think for themselves so reading is too much effort.
---
*Reads quest guide*
---
That is outdated information and not good. Train by casting fire strike on monsters: hill giants if f2p, if p2p you have many more options.
---
You‚Äôre a dumb cunt you got it the wrong way around
---
Looks good homie
---
Same, I actually choose to use range on slayer tasks like wyrms now because I have a low-cost alternative to blowpipe that still does bits :)
---
Start an ironman, makes the game experience much better
---
You can get masters from mediums though.  Honestly you should be hunting masters if you want a mimic. Getting the reqs would be a great boost to your account regardless.
---
I did barrows for elites and converted them in masters.
---
Not sure if you're aware as they are still somewhat new, but membership bonds  can be purchased entirely with in game gold. Working towards that could be a good starting point. Getting 30 smithing you could smelt steel bars at the blast furnace and pay for another 14 days in 5-7 hours. The only requirement would be getting a coal bag from motherlode mine (100 gold nuggets) and 30 smithing (Knight's Sword quest gets you from 1-29), as well as some startup cash to get the ore.
---
You should work for jagex, you've got their whole "buff range and melee but leave magic in the dirt" thing down.
---
D
---
Skelle Skelle Worm is 86.2 and the best combination.
---
Wait.... What?!
---
The Guthix one is pretty wild as well. Passively heal 50 health a minute with blowpipe or darts, even in PvP. I don't know how OP decided these were good ideas and it worries me that votes from people like him are able to change the game.
---
These are absurdly strong for how common they are lol
---
Seems like they are considering adding unpolled content.
---
ely price is having monetary premiun, it's not used just as an op tank shield (pvp, inferno), it's used by rich people to counter item/gp inflation similar to 3rd age rares from elites, that premium vanishes in matter of weeks when there's a huge preference-paradigm, for example when raids 1 or raids 2 came, ely has droped in both scenarios over 40%. If you want my tip, don't own an ely during runefest, just in case they announce raids 3 for next year.
---
I think the more likely thong would be them adding more strict requirements to specific poll questions. For example, if an update is aimed at the PvP community, give a higher weighting to people who have a lot of wilderness/bh/pvp kills. If an update is about Zulrah, give a higher weighting to those who have over a certain amount of kills. That way the people who use the content most can have more of a say about it.
---
I could be completely wrong though, we need to just wait and see.
---
/s
---
Heyyyyy what's poppin tonight
---
This is like when Youtubers post newbie guides to killing a boss or doing a task and do the whole thing in BIS gear and are like, ‚Äúyeah but it‚Äôs not that different in mithril armor.‚Äù
---
The storylines in runescape are the best part of runescape, does that mean the game is wank?
---
Me with 90 range unable to kill him cuz i‚Äôm bad and have a tune crossbow
---
Wait until you meet yourself in the Nightmare Zone
---
I too recently got 1k kc on vork with jar as the only unique
---
Good bot
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind, but I can see the reasoning for the complaints. The problem is the extent to which you‚Äôre leaching. You didn‚Äôt just run with teams while having subpar gear, you literally waited outside the room while they killed Olm. I imagine people would be happier if you at least tried to contribute.
---
I did mm2 before ever using nieve since my combat was too low for her. I feel like I missed out on something core to the OSRS experience
---
You better enchant bolts, way quicker.
---
Depends on which you do but the xp rates are insane
---
example:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7S7oBVal3w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7S7oBVal3w)
---
Working on osrs you mean?
---
Aerial fishing content is seemingly not worth doing unless you are a completionist.
---
What are your thoughts on either raising the XP/ph or lowering the number of pearls needed for Arly the Anglers shop on everything besides Angler outfit? Or raising the number of pearls received p/h as at the moment it is terrible.
---
Even perhaps being open to the idea of making the fish sack, not just a cosmetic but allowing it to store maybe half an inventory of fish that could act like a looting bag.
---
My total level is close to the same and I‚Äôm just as dumb as him, turns out if you do something incorrectly for enough time it has the same result as doing it correctly for a short time in this game
---
i'd slide in with Ellamaria too. already gave her a big white tree
---
I plqy LMS all the time, and think it‚Äôs an amazing minigame, but I still have NO IDEA why you can do competitive on F2P. It‚Äôs such a bad idea. Fair enough, there are some bots on the members game, but in F2P most games have at least half of the players in the game being bots. They should make F2P casual only, it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Playing 5h a day on average? Dude that's insane.
---
Yikers
---
Is there any plans to do a new quest in the Mahjarrat quest line?
---
Yep. It‚Äôs done. Was abused by bots to hell and back so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs outlived its use.
---
I really like any of the pirate quests. I hope they make more sometime.
---
Google chrome remote desktop brother. Game changer.
---
sounds like you're the one whining because a pker called you names once. stfu and sit
---
I wish you luck with pets.
---
Nobody cares. People just use the house for prayer xp, nobody cares about this weird blues shite
---
These are questions for the "pressing issues" Q&amp;A which I'm sure will be done sooner rather than later.
---
Why is it whenever there is a major issue revolving around the game, Jagex's response is typically silence?
---
Account security... I know that you know that we know that you know all about the issue. So I'm not going to go into detail about this.
---
When will something be done about the official client? It has barely seen an update since release. What if you go the route WOW and allow players to make add-ons for the official client and let jagex scrutinize them? This seems very lazy on behalf of jagex to leave your own client sitting in the dust whilst you let 3rd parties do the work for you.
---
You seem to mention quite a bit that you are losing new players by the mass. Could this perhaps be because of the official client?
---
Polls. It's time to change who can vote on what, and raise the minimum requirements. As we have all witnessed, PvP polls get mass downvoted. A few solutions I can think of for the main poll is raise the minimum voting level to 1250, with special circumstances allowed for 3cmb to vote at 750. As for PvP polls only allow votes from people who have performed 50 kills in a PvP scenario.
---
ikr, ive been getting these and they change it up each time and theire a good laugh
---
Reading through the first paragraph like, where‚Äôs the bait
---
This can‚Äôt be a serious-
---
Oh there it is!
---
I love when I teleport with Ardy Cloak and someone is completing the quest. I get to join in on the party.
---
I mean... the concurrent playercount is declining daily in their version... so players are actually leaving. Still.... Jagex gives zero f's about it.
---
Quick maths
---
I respect the work you put into this.
---
For me its a yes
---
I've personally never gotten any rs phishing email. How does one end up on a list like this?
---
Well I usually just take an AGS to anti them, but OK kid ill let you think that if it makes you feel better about yourself kid.
---
Me lol found this funny
---

---
I like your artstyle.
---
What did you farm them with? Guards?
---
1. 5m bonds, last I checked
---
2. He bought the whole account. Nobody would have 99 hp trimmed using dragon plate with ACB.
---
Lmao did you really safe spot jad for 2 hours just for the meme?
---
The people you see using lunar magic might be ironmen. Bottomless bucket is definitely worth using if you have access to it.
---
having a reaaaally old email,ive had mine since like 2008 or something, used it almost everywhere so it gets leaked from databases
---
And please move the side bars to the actual side of the screen!!!
---
This is very accurate to my life.
---
Jagex.
---
Im a joke. Atleast thats what my mom saysüò¢
---
Imagine crying yourself to sleep because you have to risk your granite maul upgrade kit on your 900 total account. Best ask your step daddy for another bond kid.
---
10/10
---
Allows me the option of grinding while I'm sitting at my desk at work.
---
The game's transition from desktop to mobile is one of the best I've seen too.
---
its about 8 hours a day
---
It would be even better if it shat out death runes as well
---
Yep, true, need to hit their profits too.
---
you guys know that evil bob and bob are different characters right.
---
They had us in the first half!
---
Your ego
---
How high are you? This reply isn‚Äôt even relevant.
---
Gratz have a few question to ask. What is the exp rate you were getting per hour and did you use summer pie to boost your agility level up to level 96 in order to guarantee success for the course?
---
proof? i use s pen for 90% of my runescape playing
---
Sold two bonds at 5.4M
---
I thought he looked like Jesus because of the white robe and long hair lmao
---
Bruh...
---
Nah man sorry, I don't bot anymore so I wouldn't know
---
Yeah it only takes pre reqs into account
---
It is worth to bring in unless you are lazy/too busy with switches then I suggest wait until later when you are more proficient.
---
Venge any damage from Zulrah generally speaking, mage/range/melee hits all can be reflected. I usually use it during mage when I see a range attack coming or when it has low hp, just venge up and let the snake kill itself
---
Yes
---
Do you know their ratio? their calculator on the website has been broken for years
---
Bit too powerful.
---
He had me in the first half ngl
---
i'm not even gonna bother
---
They should just make it already so you can redo quests whenever you want to get the dialogue. Without the end of quest rewards.
---
Instead you could just literally play the game and do the same activity that you have tattooed. You know
---
..... the whole point of the game.
---
Blast furnace? You need some sort of gloves there which breaks the set bonus.
---
He‚Äôs eating them most likely so it‚Äôs in his supply tab.

Aight chief good luck !

Is that a fucking problem?
---
Got an ensouled head from her last night and triple took before getting super disappointed. Congrats OP!
---
How do you use 3 prayer potions for 4 kills? I use one for 5 kills.
---
God damn you must have a real hard on for downvotes mate you're killing it. You'll have a record soon lol
---
Stay in touch Maz &lt;3
---
U mad
---
Thanks
---
Immersive!
---
It really is, I Always heard about how bad it was until I actually did it, was quite fun imo
---
I think the ratio was the same as the rs3 to osrs bond price ratio. I could be wrong so take that with a grain of salt 
---
I imagine if you are swapping in bulk the price ratio drops a bit
---
If new content dropped an item to combine with these that was relatively difficult to obtain I would fully support this
---
?
---
People actually spend thousands of dollars a month on RS3 promotions?
---
*black panther* 
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---

---
The only thing I'd like to see is a better way to deal with right-clicking somehow.
---
He is using  high tier crossbow (20-23 mill I think) with melee boosting gear, expensive melee gear at that. He should be using ranging armour to increase his accuracy. The combo of high total level and cost of his gearset he has on makes it unlikely he grinded it himself. So either he bought the account, or is trolling.
---
I don‚Äôt think that the game should receive no good rewards just because some people are botting it. I mean, Zulrah gets botted 24/7, making at least 1m per hour, but no one is arguing for a Zulrah nerf because of that. What they‚Äôre arguing for is better bot detection.
---
Its the exact same here, the solution to that is removing the bots. And since its a minigame which is only available on a select number of worlds, instead of every possible one, it should be a lot easier to catch people botting LMS.
---
Except it‚Äôs a mall cop that can only punish you for a day
---
Cute? Fuck outta here with that. Agree or disagree with the guy‚Äôs points, you can‚Äôt deny how much thought and time went into his post.  He came up with graphics and names for all the prayers too. Calling it ‚Äúcute‚Äù is such a cunt move; it‚Äôs like going into someone‚Äôs home and calling it ‚Äúquaint‚Äù.

"are we there yet"
---
I appreciate that you've tried to contact him after it happened. I've made similar mistakes in other games where someone came to help me out but my Internet went down for like 5 minutes and I completely lost track of what I was doing when I came back on, never messaged the guy and I had private messages in another window that I didn't see until later. 
---
Try to make a new account and message him, might have you on ignore now. That's what I ended up doing in my scenario and it worked, they were chill about it. Anyone that's gonna go out of there way like that is probably a pretty relaxed person who would likely be pretty understanding.

Template has been around for months

What everyone is missing: we don't even know if he's on a Slayer task.
---
i had a shit ton of attempts on my old ea account, until i closed the acc lol
---
Was going to quit RuneScape but I guess I can't now. Game is just too good
---
That‚Äôs a better idea. Well thought. So say for every 100 damage you deal you heal 1 hp
---
I had the best RNG ever with Ruby's on Galvek and I misclicked on the waves. It was soul crushing.

hi its me ur husband

Imagine if our Chinese overlords just cut mtx, raise cost of membership to $50/month and stop updates to both games..
---
Obviously that won't happen like that... But damn.
---
You use one for 5 kills? What do you do sit there and prayer flick every single attack? Are you not using piety/rigour? I melee vorkath and I'm 99 prayer and I use 2-3 prayer potions for 5-6 kills per trip...
---
I'm just stating the amount of income that was shown on the report. It was almost an even three way split between osrs membership, Rs3 membership, and mtx of any sorts (bonds, keys, spins, runecoins etc)
---
Can confirm, am one of the intimidated young boys
---
No one will buy them
---
Agreed.. a no for me as well
---
Are you supposed to spec twice even if you have hit one already?
---
That's a dumb reason to quit lmao. People bought gold with or without the introduction of bonds. And smart people still use rwt websites cuz its so much cheaper with no chance of being banned(never heard of a buyer getting banned, it's always sellers)
---
It's not the average player.
---
The average player is just like osrs. They buy membership or use bonds from in game currency.
---
The whales that are buying those bonds, mtx, cosmetics, multiple accounts for EHP... Etc. That's what makes up the profit. 
---
Crazy rich/debt people...

How hard are the grandmaster quests (mm2, ds2, soto)? I got my quest cape back in 2007 and im about to get it again and those are my last quests but they look pretty intimidating because my combat stats feel pretty low for the bosses (75 across the board). Congrats on on the cape!
---
flicking time

you'd be surprised the kind of things that people collect for the sake of collecting them. There was a guy I had seen before who had over 100m worth of potatos

I feel so bad for people that have gone 1500+ or 3000+ no whip. My only luck is with the demons I'm at 1100kc and at 7 whips. God knows my whip luck is going to be taxing any luck in the future tho üòï

Yea I am very aware of the collection community

Wait why wouldn't you use chally to spec at Corp?

yeah well i grinded a fire cape and some dude still called me a noob so i dont think its any different in game

Are they technically investors?

This part is still true and entirely up to you. Play for yourself, and if you truly care about other people's opinions, recognize what takes actual skill/effort and what doesn't. Kids running around with rapiers means nothing, but that maxed account with every pet and 200m slayer xp did not buy it.
---
Yeah the problem for jagex and osrs is that any old school player who plays for a long enough time eventually learns to sustain themselves on bonds. Very few have to pay out of pocket monthly and those who do are either newer accounts or new to the game or (very few) seem to pay because they don't want to concern themselves with bonds.
---
I mean especially with high level raids and bosses, I can sustain a bond with no more than 2 hours of game play doing something I was doing anyway trying to get a pet.
---
Rs3 having cosmetics is a significant income stream for jagex that circumvents the learned methods of sustaining membership by experienced players. I don't blame jagex for that, nor do I think they should necessarily avoid putting cosmetics only in osrs. Maybe they could afford to hire some customer support with the extra money! (/s)
---
Fucking normies
---
I played RuneScape since I was like 8, I know for a fact that both in osrs and rs3 that nobody was balling like they was after mtx was introduced into both types of game
---
Okay, I'll maybe look a bit further into that. thank you

This is huge. I know some people say it's too early to say this, but I think Elon Musk will go down as one of the most influential humans of all time, surpassing Einstein and Newton. He is responsible for so much and he's still young. He will be known for saving the youth team, colonizing Mars and changing the human race to use only 100% renewable energy which will save us all.

If they add an "attachment" then they basically can split the value of the Maul into two pieces, letting players profit from both LMS and raids.  Its a bad design imo, but they seem to really like that trend.
---
Can I bot real life? Or better yet, get a Venezuelan to do it for me?
---
Trash. Try again
---
If you genuinely did not realize you were being a dick I'd be shocked.
---
Back when my dad played he rigged a little paddle on a RC car wheel to high alch. By 99 mage the friction divot in the mouse button was pretty damn impressive.
---
I'll make it really simple and explain why it's conflicting.
---
Either work hard at earning something, and a lot of people can have that by just spending a few quid. 
---
I can work hard at something and just think, I could've spent a few quid. 
---
I could spend a few quid myself and think, I didn't achieve anything there. 
---
Bonds create an atmosphere in which I never feel satisfied because I'm constantly conflicting with whether or not I should spend irl money, and whether or not my achievements mean less because someone can have what I have without putting in a seconds grind.
---
This is why I chose to quit. What's hard to understand? If my views on something which you said yourself "aren't wrong or anything" then I'm pretty sure they're justified
---
i still play because of bonds. Havent spend a single real life coin on this game since bond release, love it.

---
Don't do the fally course, stay on canifis until seers for the marks of Grace
---
Its possible. Not from purely slaying of course. But considering he didnt post stats I could believe  he has skilled alot of it.
---
It is pretty terrible, no doubt. I've always felt they should make it where you play different roles through the waves and not rely on an entire team of random people to know what they're doing. You basically have a few options:
---
Grind it out. Like you said, you'll get there eventually. You only need 1 queen kill (two if you want Kandarin Hard which I recommend) and it isn't that many points. You don't even need to upgrade your roles as far as I am aware. Look on the wiki and make sure you aren't doing anythin that lowers your points such as attacking with the wrong style.
---
Option 2 is, as you noted, buy it. The only way this makes sense (to me at least) is if the time saved will allow you to pay back what you spent so to speak. Otherwise, you've spent 10m+ for a torso that you probably could have used elsewhere.
---
Option 3 is the best option and that involves being the group leader and being selective with who you choose. Hell, even standing up at the bank area and just chatting with some people will help. You will figure out real quick who knows what they are doing and who doesn't. And don't forget, you're all there for the same reason. You'll need to be more knowledgeable about the minigame, and like others have said, you'll need to be willing to switch roles (such as going from 2 attackers 1-9 to 2 healers on queen), but that is not too big of a deal as you'll still get a lot more points than playing with a bunch of noobs/randoms who either quit or need to be coached mid wave.
---
PM me your username if you'd like and when I'm on sometime and feel like playing BA I'll invite you. I have a few friends that really know what they're doing.

I agree with most people except on the rings. If you want to save a bit of time imbuing you can get away with buying a brimstone ring. Gives stats of all unimbued rings so it is good all around. Imbued rings are better but if you start doing bosses like dks it is really nice to have for one less switch.
---
That's what I was thinking lmao. Interestiiinngggg.

So what? MTX is only bad if your're poor.

He must have some game knowledge to be able to get into that dungeon though, like compared to most places it's a pain in the ass.
---
Explain how it does, please
---
Oh it's you!! Lol
---
Banning those gold farmers and setting a higher barrier for entry slows them down significantly though, no?
---
Or just faking and end clan chat tab or something.
---
man I didn't anticipate this much hostility for calling out mediocre writing.  Keep your elf waifus and endless fetch quests my dude
---
No, ironmen are actually playing for their own amusement and accomplishment. Ask most ironmen. They get bored of the game being ez for them so it‚Äôs a harder way to play. It has nothing to do with mtx or peoples opinions of them.
---
RS3 is as canon as Dragon Ball GT
---
Just another one of those sweaties.. someone that hasn't played for 2 years and accomplished 2k total in 4 years, 500 total every year. Don't think so mate. 
---
Go make a thread in this sub explaining why you think ironmen wouldn't care if bonds were added for all iron men, because achievements and competition in an online aspect of this game are meaningless. See what people say to you mate.
---
My buddy won a 25M roll on one before and got paid out. I‚Äôve won a few 5M+ rolls as well. I believe some of them are legit, but the odds are still definitely against you so if you continue playing you will eventually get cleaned

Wanted to, but nope.
---
Musta been the same person showing those two fat girls.
---
Problem with DWH is, while it is nice, the little shit never wants to hit.
---
If you don't mind soloscape, you can do it solo and drop him to under 10%. His damage procs drop with his % hp remaining, so if you keep him hovering between 5-10%, you can grind points with very little need for food. It works out to more loot, construction xp, and fletching xp, but you give up some FM xp in return.
---
Q
---
Banned already lol
---
I have quit playing and thought about renewing how is the lance vs dhcb is the woox walk hard with lance?
---
like bruh did you already forget what you wrote lol
---
&gt; But for me RuneScape used to be all about making something for yourself and going to the G.E or a bank with your newly obtained whip or bandos chestplate and feeling like an absolute god amongst men for it.
---
I'll make the thread for you and I'll let you see the backlash
---
The story was interesting in SOTE, and I did take the time to read it, but the actual gameplay was extremely tedious. One of the most boring quests I've completed.
---
I was just doing the lance method last week.
---
Having the SERP is nice to save on antivenom, but make sure you use barrows gloves (ferocious gloves have a wicked negative mage bonus). If you use barrows gloves and a staff to autocast crumble undead, you should never splash. I think my PR with the lance was like 1:49, but that was a small sample size.
---
The DHCB is more work, but more efficient because of how OP the ruby bolt specs are.
---
If the account was bought and if he was on a slayer task, he would've used wiki to find the fire giants. Probably still took him ages to work out how to get in the dungeon.
---
Thanks Lyon sent a ticket in
---
Just enuf
---
Is it possible to change the sound system so that if I have "Area Sounds"  disabled, I can still hear audio that is associated with my character?  Such as skilling and combat.
---
Hearing  the repetitive sound of other people mining, wcing, fletching  (especially in populated spots) and the stomping of other player's pets  is really obnoxious. But if I disable "Area Sounds", there are several  bits of sounds that I can't hear my character doing and I find it a  little hard to play.
---
Thank you for reading!! =)

It should just be a massive grind to get new stuff in a clan keep, maybe you earn points from participating in Clan Wars and you spend those to unlock stuff. They could also make slight changes to clan wars to accommodate this.
---
Total levels is an awful idea as it punishes clans for having newer players, meaning clans will exclude them as much as possible. Of course it could only count ranked members but still, just the general notion that there would be some benefit to excluding people from your CC is an awful one.
---
So I get molested by a monk, then I intimidate everyone who watched it happen into not testifying and then we party

Jeez I really need to stop spacebaring through quests

How do you complain about lack of immersion in runescape?
---
These are the opinions of u/J03130 and I just wanted to see what you guys thought
---
As a footless person I can only recommend
---
Ardougne - Ardy cape tele  
---
Morytania - Ectophial  
---
Catherby - Home nexus/portal chamber  
---
Falador - Explorer‚Äôs ring  
---
Hosidius - Xeric‚Äôs talisman  
---
Troll Stronghold - Home nexus/portal chamber  
---
Harmony Island - Arceuus teleport  
---
Weiss - Icy basalt  
---
Farming guild - Farming cape or skills necklace  
---
This is my exact route and teleport methods. I camp the Arceuus spellbook and bring Blood + Soul + Law + Nature + Dust runes (3 of those in rune pouch) for the HI teleport and Resurrect Crops spell. An herb run takes me ~4:45. 
---
Hopefully that helps you or someone else!
---
its like you have amnesia or something. my original comment said its up to you what you make of it. if you derive your accomplishments from flexing at the ge like you said thats your problem lol
---
i play the game as do many others for myself. i dont even interact with other people outside of my core friend group lol because it means nothing whether or not some kid sees my capes nor do i care if some kid just skipped the whole game and bought the same cape i still accomplished what i accomplished that's the point
---
i never said people cant derive accomplishment from flexing on others, in fact, its clear you do and just wont admit it and now youve turned a conversation about mtx into some weird shit all because you fail to acknowledge something so simple and fucking quit over it lol
---
and others noticed it too g
---
how interesting, a person who space-bars through quests can assess its writting? truly a godlike reading speed mate
---
As long as it's possible to dual wield obviously
---
Not as much as you would think. Since the ban rate for hand played accounts is much lower, there isn't that much time spent actually creating the accounts. It would maybe cut down on bot farms since Zulrah ready accounts would be more expensive; however the people that run those bot farms make a TON of money so it probably wouldn't be that much of a deal to them.
---
These would all be so broken
---
Bro, you asked a female you met in RuneScape for personal contact information.  You might have freaked her out lmfao
---
whats the correlation of rune scims to them buying bonds? they cant buy bonds on the ge? rs3 ironmen can buy bonds on the ge which is why i ask
---
&gt; smashing them with a hammer manually.
---
Probably not what you meant but it does do a full inventory automatically off one click now. Still slow though. Same with adding the milk from the coconut half to a vial. One click per inventory.
---
Its a lot better than before.
---
You don‚Äôt need the entire set for blast furnace. Just the other pieces besides the gloves
---
if you don't want to kill 500 fire giants for a rune scim then ironman probably isn't for you. there are far worse grinds.
---
also are you suggesting ironmen should be able to buy bonds off the GE? I'm confused by this post. what does buying bonds have to do with grinding item drops?
---
I'm assuming divine super for spec? Any switches? I see people mentioning bringing like 5 items for a melee switch that seems like a lotta lost inv space? Unless they're banking and rejuvinating after every kill?
---
Good to hear though, I'm stoked to try out some new (to me) content.
---
Ironmen should be able to buy bonds with irl cash and sell them for gold on the ge and use that cash to buy what they want from vendors
---
Talking about buying bonds with irl cash and selling them for gp on the grand exchange

The lunar isle portal is better in most cases cause you teleport to lunar isle, bank, go to vork, repeat, this is only for vorkath though

There are lizards that can shoot blood from their eyeballs to freak the shit out of predators.

its all about finding trusted resellers that sell gp as their job. as crazy as it sounds single resellers will buy over 40b in one day at 53 cents and instantly sell it to another reseller for 58 cents each. I would do 8b trades/stake transfers wait till the BTC hits my wallet then do another 8b trade/stake transfer and repeat.

Max mage definitely helps, but if you‚Äôre learning, you want as many brews and restores as you can. Max mage = more gear to bring. Try going in there yourself with no food and see how far you can go, waves 1-34 are pretty much what you see, waves 35-66 are the same waves, but with a mager.

I think this is better. Better items (or at least ones used more often) would get hit with more deaths than weaker items that aren't worth doing the buyback on.

If membership prices ever go up jagex is doomed. Thats simple as that, we love this game, the update team has not proven its getting fairly strong budjet at all so if they want to raise membership prices they are just milking us players then.
---
It's one of the fastest runecrafting training methods. It's a slow skill overall so people are always willing to spend big money to get through it faster.
---
This is one of the coolest places.  I'm glad we were brought back there during SoTE.  I wish they would boost the exp back to normal levels inside there, though.  Would make it actually usable.

I think Jagex should remove every fairy ring except for the one in the Ardougne Zoo.
---
After all, isn't it time to remove all non-BIS fairy rings?
---
Lmfao, it didn't even stand a chance.
---
my whole point is that magic attack without magic "strength" is shit so OP has done the same as jagex did with augury vs rigour and piety. IE 1 useless prayer 2 strong ones.
---
Catch me if you can! Mwahaha *teleports to Camelot*
---
Unfortunately thats how it is, and I dont really see a way around it. F2p is a "test version" after all so I dont expect to see any changes coming soon or ever regarding moneymaking.
---
The best tip I have is to try to get a good foundation in f2p statswise, save up IRL for a Bond or a month then try to unlock one or more good membership moneymakers and keep at it from there. Invest rl cash until you are at the stage you comfortably can sustain the membership via in game cash. To start from scratch in f2p and only buyung membership via gp seems like such a chore early on and requires quite alot of game knowledge that most probably burn out from it.
---
If you're only there for 99 FM though it just increases the time needed
---
From the wiki:
---
&gt; The average loot roll is worth 142,761. On average, master clues are worth 856,567.
---
&gt; The average loot roll is worth 60,185. On average, elite clues are worth 300,926.
---
&gt; The average loot roll is worth 31,566. On average, hard clues are worth 157,833.
---
&gt; The average loot roll is worth 37,338. On average, medium clues are worth 149,352.
---
&gt; The average loot roll is worth 20,747. On average, easy clues are worth 62,243.
---
That wouldn't make a difference? The % would still be taxed, and the gold/item sink would be the same.
---
The prices adjusting like that would just mean flippers can still make profit.
---
Using a bastion will help push your average trip length by taking less damage on average.
---
For the last part, I would only suggest keeping 10k cannon balls on hand at a time and 100p pots max, especially if this guys bank is only roughly 100m, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to keep 5%-10% of total bank value in only 2 supply items, just my 2 cents, but good overview nonetheless
---
You should be able to just math it out yourself, the wiki I believe provides average values of each clue (and OS buddy stats may as well).  I think the general consensus is to hand in a clue if you can't complete a step, or if you're doing a task and don't really want to do the clue, so you get the chance of another clue drop
---
Also it may be worth it to use less than BiS gear so if you die the buyback would be much cheaper
---

Mind Talisman -&gt; Mind Tiara, for making Mind Runes with teleport. You do it with Respawn Teleport in PvP worlds, entire process becomes left click and quick banking.
---
Unless your account is fairly progressed in the game it's a waste of time to grind for bonds. Work 1 hour at your job or grind for 5 to get a bond. Waste of time tbh.

I support a GE tax. Sinks some gp out of the game and promotes a more varying gameplay by for example rewarding you for smelting the rune ore stack you got from revenant PvM without being as extreme as ironman.

The devs can‚Äôt update skills like smithing because they‚Äôve been consistently shot down by the community, they never poll skill content because it never passes. The few times we do get skill updates, they‚Äôre bundled alongside big updates (Kebos with aerial fishing and farm guild. SotE).

Okay but in reality do you actually make that much extra..? Everytime I've referred to those calculators they're for a *perfect* hour, not an average your.
---
Lol
---
My life
---
Asking the real question here:
---
Why were you on your lunch?
---
Welcome back!
---
I feel like a lot of quests were just attempts to learn/implement new mechanics
---
By rd u mean rune drags? The fuck you mean a few days to make like 100m through rds lmao
---
Fuck u cuntbucket take my fucking downvotes
---
Well there is still plenty of accomplishment in this game to be had. Getting cosmetics, pets, drops, 99s that aren't buyable, not giving a fuck and realizing that you should be proud of what you have BECAUSE you didn't buy it through bonds.
---
DHL is were it is at low cost kills that from my estimation are quicker because you can woox walk it faster, and you get the BGS spec in with out tons of gear switching.
---
For real, need to get a print out of it
---
Are you saying that black people cant be guards? *TRIGGERED* 
---
Anyways Ive used the hand I always saw in the memes, so since noone was complaining about it I went for it.
---
Bad at the game or have my priorities straight? How can you be bad at a point and click anyway?
---
Add new rewards for existing courses-
---
Ape atoll- Occasionally you can find "golden bananas" on the course that when eaten, increase run energy restore by 10% for 10 mins.
---
Barbarian outpost- After a certain amount of courses, the barbarians are impressed and five you some of their armor. It could give you slight stab/slash/crush bonuses.
---
Dorgush-kaan course- Every couple of items that you fetch for Turgall, he will give you a reward. This could include insulated armor, which gives high magic defense and slight magic damage reduction.
---
No Dark Bow spec either
---
This is just stupid level of difficulty.
---
2 of them have venge abilities, 1 drains prayer, and another drains defense AND they are all in deep wildy...
---
First issue: NPCs don't reflect damage in OSRS for a reason. Drop all effects that reflect damage. Especially in PvP areas where if you get 20 damage reflected back to you on one of your last hits to a boss, someone else will definitely spec you out. It's just too powerful for an NPC and consumes way to many resources for it to be a wildy boss on top of that.
---
Second issue: clans would camp this place 24/7. No one could ever feasibly complete a run and return to a bank alive. We have to get rid of at least a little of that risk, we can either move this place to the tele-friendly wildy or do something else (explained further down)
---
Third issue: the gear you're rewarding is comedically over powered. It works in DMM, but there is no circumstance where it's OK to add this nonsense to the game. Curb them rewards. I don't know what they should be, but it ain't that.
---
Final issue: sporadic bosses just suck, but I still like the way this ties into revenants and want to find a new way to make this boss accessible, grind-friendly, and still related to revs.
---
So here are my thoughts:
---
Issue 1) Just drop those damage reflecting abilities. I don't even think you need to add anything in their place just drop em right off the planet. Bye, Felicia.
---
Issue 2) Build an entry room to this arena. Make that room SAFE (no PvP) and put a second bank into the wilderness. Obviously we can't just have people popping in for the bank and safespot in the wildy, so we gotta lock that door. Let's just say we put a spider web in front and a consumable, tradeable key that you use on the door itself to get in. This way you don't have to risk anything to get to the arena, you can't easily run to the arena for shelter, and once you've looted the arena you don't have to run all the way to a lever to secure your rewards. The arena itself will obviously remain unsafe.
---
Issue 3) There really isn't a need for this arena to give out best in slot gear for anything. It already resembles Barrows, so let's just have it reward Barrows alternatives that are themed appropriately to the contents of the arena. Could do some new sets with new set bonuses that are used in specific niches and degrade as they are used. You might MAYBE add one new BIS item. The ammo slot does feel pretty under utilized and we got new melee gloves at Hydra, but not new ranged gloves so maybe that. There are possibilities there for tiny upgrades.
---
Issue 4) Getting into the arena requires a key that I mentioned could be tradeable and would be consumable. Have revs drop that key or maybe have them drop a ring of those keys that you could stack? One entry to such an insanely difficult and random boss sounds unfair.
---
Lol let me rephrase I went just over 90 dry got the maul and I'm now 190 dry after getting the maul. But yes still hurts I wouldn't be complaining if it was a bow lol
---
man oh man,  why dont people ask GE whats up before doing shit like this?   my home world is 353 since i i noticed alot of rly high levels like to hang out there.   so before i do something ive never done before i always ask the boys at GE.  you get a few trolls but also alot of wise knowledge from the owl boys perched at the bank.
---
5K+ Zulrah kills for good RNG
---
I didn‚Äôt know so thank you
---
Buy rigour
---
As far as I know you can leave and come back.
---
Lol my account has no combat stats I‚Äôm 12 hp but thank you
---
It fluctuates daily depending on supply and demand just like all things when trading within a market setting.
---
Just pay for membership
---
Nope. One is a skillcape.
---
Look at mister money bags over here
---
Yeah, runes aren‚Äôt cheap. Would spend about 3-4K bloods and deaths every attempt. Most of the money spent were. Just on runes. You hardly use up restores and saradomin brews tbh
---
This is so disgusting to look at.
---
Until he votes no
---
Ahh yes, I forgot about K'ril Tsutraroth. In that case, I feel like giving the porridge a duration will either make it only useful there (with low duration, like 1 minute), as it's the only monster that deals significant poison damage or will make it overpowered at K'ril (with a long duration, like 5 minutes) and relatively balanced everywhere else. If we delve into more complex mechanics like only allowing X amount of poison damage to be converted into HP, we get into the annoying situation where the same poison tick could partially heal you and partially damage you. In any case, difficult to keep track or and probably difficult to program.
---
Late reply but exactly what happened to me... I was pretty low lvl when I got the first drop and I literally didn‚Äôt even know what it was or the significance I was just like oh hey better pick that up and wiki it lmao
---
The amount of time it takes to get a bond through gold you could literally go on craigslist and do some random odd job for like $15. Help someone load up their truck or something.
---
I too enjoy having 2 dps for a fire giant task.
---
Yeah it's like adding bis boots as a clue item in the game...
---
Yes but it is the Stength skillcape.. shouldn't it provide more strength?
---
Rofl nice
---
Died to triple jads 10 times before I was able to pass it. Zuk wasn‚Äôt too bad, just healers. Always got to healers with zuk. Wave 62-63 weren‚Äôt bad at all
---
wtf lmao
---
Making skillcapes have different stats would alter the value of certain skills. So no, all skillcapes should have the same stats. What would you do for say, a smithing skillcape stats wise?
---
It‚Äôs not worth your time to maintain a bond unless you don‚Äôt have a job, if you made $5 an hour it would literally take you 6 hours of work to afford membership for 3 months, versus god knows how many hours of f2p money makers to afford 3 months worth of bonds
---
Hey man, as long as you're employed full-time you're free to live your life as you see fit.
---
030 more like 0w0
---
dmm armour and weapons is too overpowered. it would break the game.
---
Yeah I guess the system would be similar? If I‚Äôm recalling correctly.
---
I would think it would be worthwhile to put in some fail safes to prevent abuse. Killing your target would be one.
---
Perhaps killing non target players would only give you a non-tradable ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù version. Though it‚Äôs not guaranteed since you still have to roll for the drop.
---
Could also make it where you can‚Äôt get this same target within a set time frame. Idk just thoughts.
---
Interesting theory but I don't see how it really matters. No one who is concerned about 875 xp in a certain skill is doing that quest anyways.
---
firecape with full arma haha wat
---
If they want pvp to stay active they need to find a way to make it easier, or cheaper to learn to pk, so more people will be interested.  I am ok at pking, but when I was learning on my low level gmauler, (which I feel was a great account to learn on, but got really stale once I learned what I was doing) it was nice to know id end up even if I kept my kd even. 
---
I was in LMS the other day to see if I thought it was a viable way to learn to pk for new players. It seems fine if you want to brid, but for someone with no experience, I can see even casual being too fast, as the barrier to enter PVP is so high, skill and, unfortunately money wise. 
---
On terms of PVP polls, Jagex needs to find a way to implement new things to PVP, but not make the rest of the game feel like it'll barrel over them.  Like, it doesn't look good to do an unpolled nerf the Dihns, and and then ask non-pkers if they want to buff PVP content a couple of weeks later, so timing is key as well.
---
I quit playing this game over a year ago but these are the reasons I still come back to this sub
---
The Nex gear thing really isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things... They've had the 200m possible drop for ages and nex gear is worth less than that. Not saying it isn't a problem, but it's really not earthshattering.
---
yeah i will.
---
Blood barrage, see how he's got the symbol on his back?
---
what, the east bank? workshop is one of the best soundtracks you horse
---
Range cape provides no range bonus, attack cape provides no attack bonus, mage cape provides no mage bonus. None of the skill capes provide any offensive bonuses, they‚Äôre not supposed to be the bis, their perks are usually fairly niche with a few more useful ones
---
Bursting dust devils in prossy is the greatest thing as well, you barely use PPots if you kill them efficiently enough and maximize your prayer bonus
---

The strength cape is a cape of achievement, it isn't supposed to be the cape that gives the maximum bonus in that given skill.
---
That's fair -- I've seen the issue come up a few times by content creators who want to preserve 1 Def accounts
---
You sound like a total douche
---
Oof high mark cost is right direction but as an intermediary between agil cape I wouldn‚Äôt see a good reason to slog to 99 for the perk anymore. (Didn‚Äôt see much reason to begin with). Perhaps lock this 5 set perk behind a diary and lvl requirement/high mark cost would work.
---
wild, I read the dialogue, didn't mention what you said.
---
I like the use of the original SSJ grades for this. High IQ post.
---
It's a little convoluted however it aligns with the fact that hespori deals poison damage.
---
Additionally, I think these foods should be available at 85-90, 95, and 99 just so there's something to do with the seeds before 99 cooking. Based on which ones are strongest, which...could be open to interpretation.
---
Not really something to complain about. 5m isn‚Äôt much. Kinda glad it went up
---
People who skip dialogue and just go directly to a runescape guide miss out a lot of cool things.
---
I recently started playing the game and when i gave the wizard in the wizards tower his marbles, i saw a guide someone doing it before actually accepting the quest and then he even asked him if he stole him as he has the marbles. Also runescape doesnt spam you with lots of annoying fetchquests like wow does where some stories might be good its still just too much to read especially if you arent solo leveling.
---
What have I just read...
---
**After months of trying to get in touch with jagex about one of my older accounts who has been banned since-2016, Jagex refused, to reply, check on my appeal, on me.** 
---
**However, shortly my friend send me these pictures.**
---
**Pictures of him getting unbanned, while he actually did  bot,** 
---
**Yes the owner broke a real, Yes he did bot, No he wasn't gone for a while or w/e the Jmod is saying in the mail.** 
---
**Really suprised about how these appeal's are being viewed by bots who give you 50/50 chance of a return to your account or you stay banned.** 
---
**Even if you did really get Hijacked/hacked.** 
---
**Gjob Jagex**
---
I agree with you, it feels like people throw the term EOC around without even knowing what it means anymore, they just know it has a negative connotation.
---
more like flinching time
---
If a moderator or a "Jmod" (as I recently learned the name of) can provide me some reason of me being reported or "macroing" (also new term) I would greatly appreciate the insight. Just an old soul enjoying some video games, would love to regain access back to my account.
---
You are un-ironically my favorite content creator
---
Thanks!!  I never would have EVER expected to get a pet playing OSRS  I struggle enough trying to get a Fire Cape (4trys no luck) xD. Keep grinding Skotos shall set you free!

Yeah, there was that wierd HD mid switch that happened. I remember now. I wonder...is that why the varrock guards and the Camelot knights look so...out of place.

&gt;thank you so much

Definitely need this for reasons. Not because I just bought 100 of each blessing or anything.

As a player with 99 thieving, I can confirm that this does happen

The set bonus only helps when walking or standing still

Yeah its a bad image for twitch and rs. And if they lose their loan the only way they pay it back is with more loans.

Never get avernic that early, its a big ol waste. never get avernic till ur getting close to t bow and if thats the case, its better to save that 170m for a tbow rebuild
---
Answer my question please. Please give examples where is makes a MEASURABLE difference. It saves maybe like 10 stams throughout getting a quest cape and you have to be more specific saying "skilling" pretty sure you don't need graceful to level combat skills.

ahh the fight for the sacred clay. that was a game I never much played that game but I do remember gathering a load of clay and then getting absolutely murdered by a team and loosing all of it. lol

Switch statements are *usually* better and more efficient. Unfortunately I think that a Jmod commented at one point that the engine doesn't support them hahaha.
---
finished rfd today, pretty happy with myself tbh
---
Nope it was Zamoraks nuke that woke Guthix up
---
I dont usually post a real constructive comment, especially on reddit, but from my personal experiences regarding the loss of a loved one and how unhealthy runescape actually is for you, if it makes you feel better to be away from the game and lessens the heartache you're currently experiencing then you should get away from it. If you however somehow manage to embrace it and cherish the memories you and your mother had playing the game and in time can smile when thinking about it(this probably wont be for months, even a year or two, at least in my experience) then keep playing and try to enjoy yourself.

One was doable from the base client and the other is from cheat clients.

This would greatly improve alching on mobile. On PC you can put your stack of noted alchables in the same spot your high alc icon is so you just click one spot repeatedly, on mobile you have to bounce back and forth to both sides of the screen.
---
How is that forced. You want the dragon pickaxe to be more efficient. You dont need it for any content in the game it just makes things easier. If you want the item you gotta take the risk. Again no content is locked behind the dragon pickaxe and nobody is making you get the pickaxe against your will... Smh
---
Lol. OP never claimed graceful was better or worse than wearing other gear + stams. The whole pointing out that graceful only works to recover run while still was not relevant. And omg you did math; what‚Äôs your point that his suggestion equates to 9.5m? Seems like a fine number to me. Besides it‚Äôs a concept and numbers can be adjusted lol.
---
Nah, if you want untradeable supples play an ironman

Iirc javascript dont do jit.

Pls no more bis pvp gear, pvp has changed enough alrdy. Range is meta, melee sucks balls unless u prod ags gmaul, and mage doesnt only hold you in place to switch to melee or ranged cause it venoms and blasts 45s

Yes this gets posted all the time. Yeah nobody cares.
---
Yes, but what does that have to do with Observatory Quest?
---
Link to proof?
---
You're free to your opinion, but luckily the PvP polls speak for themselves.
---
Castle wars needs to be revamped, and I think they could revamp it to make it exciting and worthwhile like LMS is.  They need to provide runes and ammo inside the game to mitigate the advantage rich maxed mains have, or provide something that works like the tridents but for a castle wars only version of the god spells. I think the best way to play castle wars right now is on f2p.

Yes, it's one of the many draws of using the dungeon.

With runelite client you can hold shift and right click a tile to mark them

I meant in real life we can't repeat the same thing over and over to get where we want. In my experience at least we gotta improve.

If PvMers are outanking them because their gear is shit then the system is working no? Them whining doesn't make them right nor does it mean they'll be listened to.
---
Dragon darts?
---
I have a few screenshots that I can black out the items for obvious reasons but it's roughly 1-2M profit a day, checking twice a day. Once at lunch during work and once before I go to bed.
---
And risk fighting contributes to probably 25-30% of the stack. Usually I'll do 2-5m risks per fight with roughly a 65-70% win rate in the 65-75 bracket.
---
yeah just what the game needs, more instanced Pvm nothing sounds more interesting than more added soloscape to the game

Because they‚Äôre rare. You don‚Äôt profit off med-clues unless you‚Äôre lucky, you usually break even until rangers.

it's commission staking with the commission being 100% of the profits lol

Did we just become best friends?!?  Thanks and congrats to you as well!!!  I feel like this doesn't happen all that often and never would of thought in the ~15 years I've played RS  would I have this kind of luck xD. Few days before opened up my 3rd hard clue on this account for a Robin Hood Hat

Runescape quests don't have good writing most of the time anyways, but fuck me this quest had insulting bad writing.

Our character will kill innocent of civilians, steal from the masses, murder their fellow players in cold blood, and cause mass chinchompa extinction events all for the sake of some XP and GP. You can't pain him as this  misunderstood good guy, when you've literally massacred dozens of elves before just cause you were out of slayer points to skip. 
---
They could have given Baxtorian a non-traditional story arc, but instead they opted for the disturbed old man regretting their past decisions arch. They could have made the obvious racist analogy character have more in depth, by making him try and take control of things, since "a filthy human couldn't do it" and involuntarily fuck things up.  They managed to actually building up some actual depth with Lord Iorwerth...only to throw it away with the crazed fanatic type. 
---
The OSRS team has all this freedom to break through the typical fantasy settings, and make non-standard storylines and characters, yet they resort to fucking Thanos memes in their quest writing.

The player is not supposed to be this glorious do gooder almighty hero, he's supposed to be the annoyed everyman mercenary type. He's the backbone allowing the story's heroes to do what is needed of them. The Samwise Gamgee to our Frodo Baggins.

Its commission staking but instead of taking 5% of the winnings they take 100% if they win, or 0 if they lose and add you to a fake debt list.

Well dinh's bulwark got nerfed because "integrity change" so who knows where it will end. Seeing how the higher-ups at Jagex are all about the money and PvP contests (DMM in particular) attracted a new players to the game, they may bend over backwards to PvP in a way that will end up killing the game.

It‚Äôs just the way the engine was designed for client delivery. It could in theory be negated with a hardware rendered client like the mobile version, but it‚Äôs a lot of work and probably not worth their time.
---
I got the pet at around 60kc but haven‚Äôt gotten anything else in about 200kc so I feel you
---
The problem with this is they can only do it for solely PvP content... And then it would need to be restricted to the type of PvP the requirement is for... Like even if you poll a new weapon that only works in PvP, you can't limit it to just BH Kills since that excludes Wilderness, PvP Worlds, Castle Wars, Clan Wars, and so on; the latter of which are still PvP so PvP weapons would work unless they were excluded.
---
Then when you have something like an Occult Necklace upgrade, that affects the entire game and not just PvP so it doesn't make sense to only allow PvPers to vote. It would be like only allowing PvMers to vote on Raids 3 Rewards when those rewards could have huge impacts on the PvP meta.
---
So requirement would likely only be added for the content itself, like "should we rework BH". But from what we've seen, I am not sure if they were even planning to poll that... So far we've only seen the rewards would be polled and that BH Rework was getting a beta before any polls. They also didn't poll the LMS Rework, so... Not really sure what they are going to do differently if they were already doing to do the BH Rework unpolled and if requirements on rewards are problematic and conflict with their recent statements.
---
The probability of that happening back to back to back is:
---
(1/1,016)\*(1/4,221)\*(1/2,032) = 1.15026E-10 or 0.00000000015026 or \~1 in 6,655,131
---
Too bad you didn't buy a lottery ticket, ey? /s
---
The judge apparently
---
We need to stop with the wilderness/pvp updates. Enough is enough. It's limiting future content/devaluing existing content.
---
Declawing should be illegal. Thats like cutting your fingers off at the first knuckle or something

i only play mobile. 8/10, would like more of the runelite features on a mobile client though.

Most honest answer I can come up with: I dont know, I dont have 1 bil lol. But the DPS on that thing is insane on some of the most profitable bosses in the game. Saradomin, bandos, zulrah, etc. The usual strategy is they do those bosses with the tbow to get some funds to start building their bank for raids or tob!
---
Idk why you wanna find this guy, he seems lile a drag to be around.
---
Pirate boots gz
---
Youre not understanding the purpose of skill capes
---
Fuck you for showing me this. I have to go smoke now
---
Don't touch my dead content!
---
Get 95 rc make 1.7m an HR doing wraiths
---
LMFAO most underrated comment ever.
---
Right? I see so many chads at PC standing around the whole time probably thinking "look at all these scrubs not afking"
---
Only to realize when the thing goes to 0% they dont get points
---
D:
---
UMASS Ahmerst :)
---
If you exhausted all options, try the general store where you start the quest
---
Pvm updates being forced in the wild are 100% responsible for Pvp polls always failing, they're band-aid fixes that temporarily 'rejuvenate' the wilderness but just create resentment between the game's communities.

Texas a&amp;m wya

---
there "doing something non-optimally" but this dude literally has full dragon with an acb
---
I started at 58 and took me 44hours which I have nearly grinded out in 1.5 weeks
---
OP please used the screenshot function built into your OS.
---
This game was good don't hate lol
---
You shall not pass!
---
So sorry to hear.  It sounds like you guys had a good relationship and that she was a great mother.  the only thing I would say is to make sure this is something you want to do.  Dont feel "forced" to come back to RS.   Im sure your mom would want you to do what makes you happy so if this does then perfect.   If you get around to this message lmk your ign and I'll add you, if not Im very sorry for your loss and I hope you make it through this alright.

The head part made me laugh out loud
---
I destroyed my book got it back then Robin had an option so thanks mate
---
I have full ancestral and a tbow, is there a good guide I can look at to see what I should use gear wise?
---
Just put soul wars portals in the wildy, I'd be game for that.
---
You know Jagex is English.. right? lol
---
And should I use crystal bow over arcane? Or will crystal be more than enough
---
Please this
---
"save less time" - so it \*is\* worth it? As I save more time using bgs, thus taking less time in total...
---
This guy gets it.
---
Beautiful man/ woman that is just peak sexual tension.
---
What's IDeal?
---
HomeSchool University. Mom you here?
---
Shouldn't the losing clan all return in unison?
---
85
---
Wow looks great!
---
no
---
The breakfast one reminds me of baron sharks, but a budget version of them.
---
They should increase the base requirement of smithing cannonballs to reduce the amount of bots doing it. That would make it more profitable for real players.
---
Or, you know, just kill the damn portals before the knight dies.
---
Yeah it's shared but I don't have any kc on any other boss that drops it other than vorkath. My kc there is also really low XD
---
No sorry, less time is saved than you would consume during the actual animations of the special attacks. So the net time difference leaves you with longer kills. In addition, you can bring less food so shorter trips
---
I did but it was a 2nd post, was at work and found it faster than editing my comment
---
Reanimated bloodvelds 500 ish 2-2,5 same for wildy altar kinda
---
When you hold out the blurite sword it has no hilt, unplayable af
---
They gave reasoning to why its too strong, can you read?
---
&gt;and to repair you have to use it on the anvil next to your suggested location in the wilderness.
---
Or it just degrades to dust like it originally did, making it not op as fuck and giving a reason to actually continually do the content
---
I honestly wouldn't be against the idea of a blessing that beats the radas blessing because a diary being bis everywhere but gwd feels just as odd. Even ardy Cape which is useful is niche in its use case
---
Big brain time
---
Why do you perceive me as having assumed that?
---
You may be able to finish it at 80 combat with decent gear. Read some guides and make sure you know that the only way out of the boss fights is through the portal
---
Yeah, spam clicking a pixel isn't for everyone, I agree. 
---
I do love this game though
