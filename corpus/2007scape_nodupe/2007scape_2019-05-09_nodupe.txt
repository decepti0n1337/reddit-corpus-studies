You being penalized is a mindset, not an actuality. Sure it's pretty shitty that people can get huge xp advances because they chose to spend money, but at the end of the day, their choice makes no legitimate difference to your account or gameplay.
---
I play both games, I enjoy both, MTX is annoying, and of course I wish it wasn't so prevalent, but I understand that there are always going to be players that are ahead of me, due to MTX or otherwise, so it's really not that big of an issue for me, choosing not to partake.
---
? It's not hard to make a 126, you can literally 20 minute afk every combat skill except for prayer which is borderline useless in pvp above 77

Oof, sorry friend.

Reminds me of when I got a champions scroll from fire giants in wild and was immediately pk'd

I was super tired one night, and I decided to finish a clue.

Had an abyss step, and then a lvl 50 wildy step. I took my blowpipe and full graceful to the lever. I fking almost pee'd my pants when the guy at the mage arena bank told me I was a beast.

Bp is very expensive, I have roughly a 14 Mil bank total.

I got hit 3 times in a row by rangers and I am now at 37 HP debating if I should afk for regen, brew, or just essentually give up lol.

I mean.. have you done it? I recently did it and even with the guide, the puzzle was incredibly tedious. Like, 1 single mistake, you waste 30mins and have to restart. It was way worse than ME2.

Did you switch from mobile to PC?

It is a reasonable question when you look at it from the perspective of a player who has played more traditional MMOs. With those kind of games you aim to get to end game pretty fast. It's not really applicable to OSRS.. but for someone who doesn't know that it makes sense to be looking for a new MMO based on what the endgame is.
---
Why u do curtis dirty like that?
---
They are reported constantly and not banned or the throw away bots are just re made straight away
---
Are they bad over there too? I only see the ones at the ore shop in Jatizso and they're actually running free.
---
Nice switch btw, haHAA.
---
If you want a change of pace you can try running essence, it's 4.5m/h for astrals and 8m/h for lavas. It's very intensive though
---
Great marketing, Starbucks.

---
Using a rcb then is fine. I've done it before, but its just slower and requires slightly more skill. Some people prefer a rcb over a bp at Jad because you have a lot more range for the healers and its harder to get into melee range. Make sure you use diamond bolts (e), especially on jad and on anything that is actually damaging you like a ranger when the mager isn't safe spotted.
---
I would give this attempt your best shot. Probably just regen, then keep going depending on how much you value your time lol. Practice is the only way to clear the caves. You might even go all the way!
---
Zeah rc is basically mining with extra steps
---

Cast (make sure you splash) level 80 stun on an npc, then alch and repeat. Can do it with 76 magic if you boost with a magic pot. I did it in the wizards tower

You got any info about that? 4.5 and 8m sounds like a fking ton

I think steve is only preferred if you aren't gonna burst AND you wanna cannon the most tasks possible, but with bursting and a proper blocklist, duradel wins across the board for xp/pts/gp (unless you can do konar hydra). You'd also need western elite to make the points even and doing konar every 10th is a good idea so you can skip more shit tasks

Are you flexing your racism?
---
Mod Ash has been carrying osrs on his back for years now, why wasn't this done years ago?
---
No real reason, though I believe the rapier is ever so slightly better even though it's weak to crush because of the stats the rapier has over the Hasta. They would be both very comparable though.
---
I’m flattered my dick head of a character made it to this level of quality meme.

Very alpha

I did this for a solid hour, cleared around 30 world's. Obv new people came on the world's after I hopped but I still felt good at the end of the day. I kept telling them I was the exterminator and that rat protection was 10k, 1 person actually paid me :D

You are obviously a lot higher level and have better gear than me, but I found 9 brews, 11 super restores and 2 super combat potions to be way better at cerb than normal food

Well they’re 1/300 so it should take 1200 for 4 theoretically so there’s that

I wasn't tracking but I went from 97.5 range level to 98.2. Took about 3 hrs. Exp per chin averaged at 200 so a super rough average exp would be 600k exp. So 200k exp per hour, which is shit compared to mm2 tunnels, but i like the idea that im making good exp without much gp loss.

As for your first question, probably. I know boosts don’t work for some things, but I’d assume it’ll work for hanging a painting.

For your second question, yes that’ll work. The tea gives you a visible stat boost, just like a spicy stew would.

There is no way to store it without becoming a member again, but hackers wouldn't be able to take it unless they refreshed your membership. They could drop it and remove it from the game though.

It's mind boggling how hard people fight for the right of multi billion dollar corporations to censor speech, isn't it? Especially when 5 or 6 of said corporations have a pseudo-monopoly on human speech, since being blacklisted from them wipes you out from 90% of human discourse on the internet.

They are only in the wilderness and the myths guild and by the time you get there you’ll be well past 77 combat. As long as you pay attention it’s very easy to avoid being pked at wilderness green dragons.

I personally don’t like doing runecrafting, imo it is boring and a drag, but I have yet to see anybody make an actual valid argument, i think the main reason why you got downvotes was because you were pretty brash. You convinced me at least it’s a good skill lol
---
Consistent money making methods typically require either high levels, skill, and/or risk. There are better money making methods that would require higher levels or there are worse methods with little to no risk.
---
Obviously it would be easier?? If you have more restores you can bring more brews and make more mistakes. You're being intentionally dense if you think flasks wouldn't make inferno easier.

The long answer is still no.

My wallet.
---
Out of curiosity what are those xp rates lol?
---
Are you sure it's one way?
---
I always seed-&gt;compost to prevent the chance of weeds spawning (and I'm too lazy to do tithe), and you can run away from the composting as soon as the xp drop appears before the animation is done. Theoretically it should be the same speed either way.
---
Yes because it is deliberately farming emblems, this is taking advantage of the system and it introduces a fuck load of emblems into the game.
---
I'm sure you're not wrong but I browse new every day and have never seen a post like that.

How can you get 2m farming xp in an hour?

Someone passed me thieving guards in ardy and asked if I was grinding out 53 for DT. I wasn't really, I prefer to do sorc garden til around 60, but I said yes. He told me wait, and then brought me 10 dodgy necklaces, told me I got this, and said good luck. Best experience since coming back to OSRS a week ago.

Did nobody realize while they were curb stomping this meme to death that the max cape variants are cosmetic versions of their normal version? There is no difference between the fire cape and the fire max cape other than aesthetics. The [fire max cape](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fire_max_cape) has the same stats as the fire cape and has none of the perks or passive effects of the max cape. 
---
There honestly isn't any reason for the max cape recolors other than letting people flex their maxed account while they wear a better cape. When the max cape variants were first introduced, they were only for capes that were BIS for any particular stat. As new BIS capes came out, new max recolors were introduced for those capes.
---
I'm amazed that everyone on this sub has been losing their minds for the past week over one guy proposing getting rid of a cosmetic override.
---
All these triggered people probably pee sitting down
---
Bruh, theres someone underneath him...
---
Same
---
Seems like you benefited from them, why complain lol
---
I mean every time you make a tweak to try to change it plenty of people will be looking for the next method around it. On private servers they used to make it so you got no bonus for killing the same guy, so you started rotating three accounts. If you make it so no points come from kills under the same IP/MAC, then you either get friends or a VM. It's so hard to combat this kind of issue because there are people who are dedicated to keeping it going and will adapt just as quickly.
---
LOL
---
Thanks man definitely joining.
---
The more you 'expose' the method, the more people will do the method. You understand that right? The black market side of Runescape is fairly secretive, and many farmers don't like to share their methods, but I will say that methods that get shown on reddit blow up underground, you see far more requests for the scripts to be written, and then you'll see far more users running them.
---
If you want to see less cheaters, stop posting about it, and report it. You're only making the problem worse, and if its an actual issue for you, its like adding gas to a fire, you're just making it worse.
---
I've personally had four people ask me to code this type of script and it was only brought up after the initial video, I personally have lists of hundreds of ways for low levels to go about farming gold in efficient methods, but I can assure you, every post that shows that they are getting away with it is another person asking for the script to be made and used.

&gt; Why are ranger boots BIS for both new and end-game players?

I don't necessarily see an issue with it being strong for new players who just started out while being necessary for the bis boots that end-game players wear. That being said, is the suggestion to make ranger boots weaker, like +5 to fill the gap?

Please do. Hard to believe like that. Also show the collection log

It's OSRS community what did you expect

Wouldn't expect a bwana to be the one racist npc in Runescape.

That's not true at all
---
PVM is by far the main part of the game. It has some truly great content like Telos been the best piece of content in any version of runescape and bosses like AOD and Solak are a lot of fun to do with friends.
---
Sadly they're ignoring pvm and haven't released a decent boss in over a year now and making life refreshers mtx really ruined Telos to some extent

Nonono this is good. Haven't played in years because I only played classic before classic was classic ..? I sub because I love the meta. But sometimes you don't get the meta unless someone goes meta on the meta. I appreciate this man's effort.

Does the max cape share the same stats as infernal?
---
-fandom in the google search should do the trick
---
I actually did the math after this. Prossy will give you approximately 96% accuracy while vestment robes give you approximately 97.5% accuracy depending on mage level. This is negligible at face value, but if you’re barraging for over an hour this could potentially save you more in runes on your occasional splashes than you would save in prayer pots. This is only between prossy and vestment robes though, your robes need significant prayer bonus, and prossy is still a great and easily accessible option.

I have botted on a fresh account using both runelite and vanilla because I had the same thought. They both got banned in around the same amount of playtime. 
---
Note: I didn’t transfer any wealth onto or off of the account.
---
If you are talking about colour bots, then yes you are right. However they are easier to detect.
---
Why fletch?
---
Sorry if you had your volume maxed lmao
---
Nice. Yeah all I'm still hunting from Cerberus is the pet. I'm up to like 6 prims and a couple of the others
---
LOL lata biitch
---
still crazy.
---
Unless you like PvP.
---
Oh, i gotta check death runes out cause im at 66 and doing cosmis for the money but the xp is just stupidly low
---
You can setup your search bar to where whenever you start a search with a term, like "osrs" it will automatically search within the real wiki, so you never even see the google search result page. 
---
I also have mine setup to where I can't even see any results from that domain in case i forget the search tag.
---
Thanks for doing this, Maxy!
---
Same. Maybe after I can afford a dhcb or dhl I'll unblock them
---
How do you know that’s a f2p world
---
Too much sexual energy in 1 image
---
The failure you forget is that runelite on average has 20+ people working on add ons for the client alone as a minimum each week that get pst everything and implemented into the client. Jagex has 2-3 at best. 
---
As many others have also said, yes some bots work off injection, majority these days don’t however as they are detectable. 
---
Why punish so much of the player base when it won’t solve the problem at all
---
Banning 3rd party clients would ruin the game. People can’t go back to vanilla after having all of the available add ons we have now.
---
Not really.
---
For starters the client has to know it's been injected with code - the code (in the client binary) that performs this check can be bypassed.
---
I wouldn't bother patching the client though. In order to Jagex to know their client has been tampered with it needs to call home. Intercepting and inspecting the packets sent by the client would allow somebody to hook the communications and prevent the client from informing Jagex that it's been injected with code.
---
You botted on Runelite?
---
How come you can buy broad bolts on the GE but not broad arrows?
---
NIWA Wikis are high quality as well!
---
Just FYI hill giants in f2p is hella crowded and not a good place to train. at least direct him to varrock sewers or something
---
There is so much wrong in this picture it makes me very anxious.
---
You misunderstand. The features of the 3rd party clients would still be on Vanilla, just for members.
---
He was alching, probably just pulled out the stack.
---
It's different for everyone. For me it took 3 attempts after my first triple jad but loads more before just to do the waves because to me that was the hardest part. You might struggle at zuk between timing the spawns and healers or you'll get it on your first attempt. There's no way to know
---
Similar story, I've been playing about 14 days now, and on day 2 someone handed me 6m and just said hope you enjoy the game! And ran away... Since then I've literally averaged 6 hrs a day and am currently 80 cb... Thanks if you are out there stranger at the ge!!
---
Imagine the look on the bosses face when they find out they have to fight woox themselves.
---
Hot take:
---
Jagex gets a kickback from these bot farms.
---
How many dragon foreskins would equal one hide?
---
&gt;haven't released a decent boss in over a year now
---
I can show you my bussy if that will get me in
---
There doesn't need to be a "fix" for it. Jagex have said they view it as a game mechanic now
---
&gt; I still felt good at the end of the day
---
Why?
---
Agreed but if they just add Karils scales that looks like this🦀
---
They'd deal with it
---
That's possible but no, they use bonds.
---
Did you let them choke you tho?
---
You never pick up bolt racks, they disappear when you shoot them
---
I used to think the same thing until I got dumped a week ago. Now my life is in shambles
---
h
---
What level can i begin to see decent cash from master farmers? Got 7 days on my bond left and really want to buy another one before it runs out :S
---
I get 7-9 without spectral, you must be doing something wrong lol
---
Cool.
---
It's already been made, like two times
---
People like you are idiots man

Player: How does 10gp to pass the gates sound?

Mod Ash: We do not support Pay to Win features. Mtx will ruin OSRS.
---
It seems to me that the Fandom wiki has been taken over by new admins, and they've removed all traces if ever leaving. I also saw some deletion logs about a "rival website" so I'm pretty sure that's the case.

Judging people for their sense of humor is much worse than liking trash memes.

Limps, both types of cacti, white berries / poison verries and mushrooms (albeit not much since theres only one patch). Watermelon can be decent considering you get large harvests
---
They’re really not worth it on mains until you have the elite diary done
---
Yeah even got the rainbow boots so I know all about secrutit
---
Zzzzz, these posts...
---
Thank you :) I've been working for rfd and only need around 10 quest points so I might as well do that, and I think your goal advice is good so I'll keep it in mind!
---
Slayer
---
I'd do it for a membership
---
To be in rot u have to have dedication. They have 72 hour wars and would go long. You think you can gather enough people with 2k total to constantly rag them for 2 weeks straight? Lmao.
---
absolutely 0% since people who buy leeches are the ones who don't want to learn minigame and want to spend 1hr instead of 2-3hrs playing minigame
---
Only if there's a Mod Ash on the other side of the gate
---
You're definitely doing something wrong then or AFKing doing nothing for long periods of time
---
If you wanna splash more for faster rates, then teak benches. If not, oak larders, then doors at 74. I personally did oaks from 54-84 cause im cheap, wrists hurt after 84.
---
That's not funny at all, that's terrifying. Censoring words ain't right.
---
thanks haha
---
oziach
---
&gt;a nigga would if he had a 126
---
Implies he has 2k total already. You literally have the reading comprehension of an 8 year old "arsehole"
---
Same. I used normal void + bgs + bp. My best so far after learning (just 17kc now) is a 2 kill trip.
---
I mean they didnt participate in the dmm before jed got fired. They just had like ten people play and one got 3rd or whatever.
---
I wasn't aware 1-2m/hr average wasn't worth it for a med level.
---
Killing about 45/hr is very doable at 75s. Considering ONLY rings, that is 1.5m/hr. Cost of supplies should be mostly paid for by other drops. 
---
The method is so profitable because people assume it isn't worth doing and the ring prices stay high.
---
i hate it, when your 40+ hit doesn't register because sire is changing phase.
---
I use a throwaway email, random password, authenticator and bank pin. Never click the obvious links, only use YouTube and reddit. Yet I've been hacked before(couple years ago) :/ they got whatever was in my inventory, wasn't too much but enough to set me back a little. I've been logging on regularly Just to make sure but the BGS is worth a bit to me so I was just wondering if there's a way to secure it. Sorry for the little rant but thanks for trying to help!:)
---
&gt;autoplaying videos 
---
Gee I wonder
---
😂😂
---
&gt;Furthermore I do think that allowing it to include words that are typically associated with racist rhetoric, in a way, brings light to it.
---
And I would argue the exact opposite: Censoring a word for being "bad" only puts light to how "dangerous" it is. If we're not allowed to use the word, that's real terror. 
---
It's like censoring past movies/whatever and removing anything that people find offensive. You're erasing the truth.
---
I wish Desert Elite didn’t have 85 prayer requirement, 77 prayer is *a e s t h e t I c*

Your telling me that after multiple years and maxed stats MM was difficult. Not to mention all the guidance released.
---
50% chance it happens, 50% chance it doesn’t.

It either happens, or it doesn’t. 50-50.
---
I hate PoE wiki, it loads 10+ seconds and scrolls uncontrollably. I prefer asking things in global chat rather than checking them on wiki.
---
To rig a minigame is a rule in a cotext of people abusing their alts to force one of the teams to lose in purpose... nothing else.
---
That's not how statistics works my friend
---
In MM you become a monkey's uncle, so now he's just repeating the line in a matter of fact way
---
I can really relate to this, I played Runescape so much as a kid but when I log back into my old account on RS3 the stats are so low compared to my OSRS account, I guess back thenI just spent mytime messing around with friends in game and exploring.
---
200 iq

I guess your sarcasm wasn't obvious enough? Sorry to jump on you then.
---
The fandom osrs page to Drakes is the most stupidest troll shit ever, LOL
---
I have ... at school ... in 2006.
---
Last night in 100kc all I got was an archers helm c:
---
Anyone know how to remove that shit from search results
---
Proselyte is better in every way over vestment Robes though? Only thing better is Ancestral for damage %
---
I've been farming Cyclops on the top floor of the Warriors' Guild for nearly 6 hours and not got a bronze defender yet, what am I doing wrong?
---
Vorkath + green drags bots thats why
---
How the fuck wasn't it obvious enough?

Sorry to jump on you.

Again, I disagree. Playing games with a similar combat bar based combat, such as WoW or Guild Wars, or even Everquest, which don't have such a long tick system, and then switching to Runescape just makes everything feel super laggy.
---
tbh, getting money given to you in f2p is literally the best way to earn money, which is why there are so many beggars.
---
I feel like giving people tips on how to make money themselves is better, both for their enjoyment and their self sufficiency.
---
Would be a hypocrite to say that though, as ive gotten over 10m through drop parties, trivia and random people giving out cash.
---
just very different from how I remember the game
---
&gt; Nice man, I wasn't going for the pet, never thought I'd get it especially that early into the grind.
---
I thought the same while doing ZMI at level 50~ I freaked out when I noticed it as I was going back to switch off lunars.
---
Lmao gtfo dickhead
---
Black lobsters are the superior crustacean.
---
I hate that fandom site with a passion delet pls
---
Osrs wiki shows gp/exp
---
Lets just go full out and say you shouldn't be able to get any of the capes if you aren't using 2004 methods on an iron man.
---
No it isn't. Proselyte only has +3 pray bonus over vestments and vestments have a +59 magic attack bonus over proselyte. Vestments are much better.
---
Lmfao agreed. Snowflakes these days smh
---
People have done math on it, it does yield a slight difference in dps.

The OG tier list.

You'd fit in well Mr NoFap, virgins everywhere

I really dont think the hacker got a malware on me. Cause I usually play on a deep freezed computer.

I've completed all the quests on F2P and I now I wanna become a member and do Iron Man.

Should I go with membership from the beginning?

You have malware on your computer that's allowing him to see what you do.
---
The only solution is to reinstall windows and then change all of your information. There's no such thing as an authenticator cracker.
---
you should protect mage if you are using bp and protect range if you have anti dragon shield
---
Maybe it’s the other you fucking with you.
---
I had both of them done for my target and can't be bothered grinding the other 2 rooms. Just waiting to forget I have those points when I want to go back

More like imagine paying your own phone bill

Also if you add -fandom after every search request, google's ai will most likely notice that you don't like fandom links and start pushing them down.

Enchant and graveyard are fucking incredible compared to those 2 (though graveyard is trash pre b2p)

Secure your account first.

So you don’t put it inside a slayer helm. You combine it with other pieces.
---
I basically know everything about F2P, but I have no experience with Members.
---
I don't wanna go for a super efficient run or anything. I just wanna experience the game fully, not just F2P, without the shortcuts of the auction house and whatnot.
---
Thoughts?
---
There should be an rc cape denoting people spent a majority of their time at zeah so they can be laughed at by the real players
---
Yeah we don't have that in Canada.
---
Dude hand chick character

Did you have a second phone to take this photo or were you using your cyborg cameralens eyeballs with which you plan to eventually take over the world and banish all humans from the realm of the living oh god oh no
---
After 256 attempts it's basically a human version of the chimp and typewriter parable.
---
Theres as many posts asking this as there are shitty removed bis memes
---
It doesn't matter how much the bonus over proselyte is, I simply stated it "yields a slight difference in dps" and whether or not that's 1% or 50% doesn't change the fact that vestments are still better overall.
---
Yeah tell youtube about “fair use” and tell me how that works out
---
!remindme 26 hours
---
This comment actually made me audibly laugh, thank you for that
---
It really is the prayer flicking that's the biggest problem. Personally learned it after a few hundred kills at Zulrah. Got that damn fire cape at 113 combat but hey, better late than never I guess.
---
Eh what? Thought it was a bot client at first but a quick google shows its just a private server. Why the fuck do you care ?
---
Fuck Google
---
Haha nice one, that was really clever
---
Bank pin or Authenticator? Auth on email! Change password? Pop up blocker on internet program? Not typing info into phishing links?
---
You also said "much better"
---
  
---
&lt;1% difference with negative side effects is a negligible upgrade at best, not "much better"
---
Why would you ever be on Netflix in-browser on mobile if you care about data?
---
If you're willing to look things up on the wiki and really want to enjoy every bit of content ironman is the way to go,it's really rewarding to play too.
---
Just keep in mind you can't go bossing with friends or clan mates until you unlock raids which for an iron takes a long time.
---
Just make sure you understand the long grinds you need to do on ironman which could be made redundant on a normal account in minutes, like getting 75 crafting for a glory takes days on an ironman or you just pay 11k on a normal account, or needing 85-87 slayer for a whip and trodent
---
I’ll check him out thanks
---
What the fuck is everyone talking about? I feel like I'm missing something 🤔
---
Fandom is a trash site filled with predatory ads and poorly coded functionality. It's definitely hot garbage. Years playing Warframe has made that very clear.
---
Splashing is stupid and nobody can convince me otherwise
---
Will this fill square boy in the desert?
---
?
---
Just have fun on the early levels. If you want to be rated on your efficiency it would probably be 2/10. By doing the waterfall quest you get 35ish atk and str in about 30mins. You can follow the link the other guy posted, it will show all the quests you can do from the start at the most efficient order.
---
Nobody seeing the joke smh
---
Who would go on a rsps if they're maxed, thats the rule hes breaking.
---
Also, Ikov no longer exists, he's probably just got another application renamed to it.
---
Messenger, but sure.
---
His mom only loved your fingers cause they're bigger than your tiny dick

Or if you guys just kept vandalizing it, just with more sexual/vulgar stuff. People have had their wikis deleted before after that happened.

I’m the toxic one? Get real you fucking idiot

This is quite a bad comment. It does not have predatory ads nor poor coding. Please be careful with comments in future
---
It's a helmet
---
you have gay
---
It's time!
---
Verac and Guthan is wayyyyyy too strong, Dharok is probably too strong. I like the idea of the torag and ahrim set but the % chance to proc would have to be reduced. 100% increase the speed of the torag hammers!
---
Why would we bother lol
---
If it's with just a name and stats, it's usually through social engineering. So they look through your reddit history, maybe find you on social media, and gather up enough information to recover your account. How common is this? I have no idea, but apparently it's a thing.
---
I was reading online and many people said halo was taking around 50 hours, depending on if you win/loose games. Plus I’d have no problem grinding it out, but from what I’ve  experienced most people just afk or have mains do they’d wreck my pure

If it really is only 10-15 hours hell yeah I’ll do it

Morytania hard diary is very good for barrows if you want to do that for GP some day.
---
Imagine buying this...
---
If you have the dedication to actually invest the saved time into money making methods then yes, otherwise its a valid method I think.
---
prolly full of tears and moths
---
Would be awesome
---
Needs more unregistered hypercam2
---
lint. lots and lots of lint.
---
it costs 75 tickets 
---
if you lose or draw with both teams scoring you get 1 ticket
---
if you win and the other team scores it’s 2
---
if you win and the other team doesn’t it’s 3
---
so i figure the tickets per game average is probably 1.5 
---
75 total / 1.5 per game = 50 games * 25 minutes / 60 = 20.83 hours 
---
ideally you could have a friend to tie with to guarantee 2 but unfortunately using an alt to boost is against rules
---
wtf vorkie is one of the best pets in the game. 1100kc here, just hand it over plz
---
True but sometimes its faster to just search something.
---
moral of the story: don't fall for phishing links
---
The Lumbridge Elite diary rewards a sixth block slot and allows usage of fairy rings without requiring a Dramen/Lunar staff.
---
Iron maulers can't get b necks
---
Remove bis karma farms?
---
if you're high lvl you make easily 5m+/h raiding. So it's less than an hour for a bond.
---
PSA: Phishing sites may result in your account getting hacked.
---
Hard diary for Western Provinces is worth it as it lets you get Elite Void which is best in slot for many things and you don't lose it on death as its untradeable. 
---
But the best thing you can do is just do as many achievement diaries as possible as they are all worth it eventually. Also don't forget to use the xp lamps on Runecrafting, because it can give you quite a few levels.
---
I had the same log as you around 950 except 1 head and no jar.
---
Claw at 1k and leather at 1.1k. it'll turn around eventually
---
So if you think you put it in a slayer helm, go try and use a black mask on a slayer helm. If it works I will give you 100m
---
Man, I had jaw surgery 3 years ago. I wish osrs mobile was out back then. Get better soon! The recovery is going to be tough.
---
It was used by 99% because it had the best information. It was still a dogshit site in every other aspect.
---
Because it takes more skill. Nh pking is like boxing. Pvp and bounty hunter pking is like two kids swinging their arms in circles and running into each other hoping to land the harder hit
---
I use fandom because its not blocked at my work although I do recognize how much better the real one is.
---
My account got hacked, I’ll survive but I’m a bit confused. Last night I logged out and I had a bank pin, this morning it was removed and my bank emptied. How was it able to be removed overnight? There’s a 3/7 delay right wouldn’t I be able to see if someone had logged in had set it to be removed? Can it be removed if the hacker had known my pin? Just trying to figure out if my computer is infected with a RAT as antivirus says I’m clean.
---
I think it would be great, make all parts of the wilderness useful, be fun to hunt them or the danger posed of being hunted, would mean you can't safespot wilderness bosses and there is more risk in the wilderness. They can also drop some good rewards.
---
Wow look another reason to vote no on PvP polls.
---
Is it worth using ultracompost on limpwurts? I did for one batch and only got 3 roots from each.
---
Also I just invested in a bottomless compost bucket and I feel like something is off. I got a 3 toadflax harvest from one patch where I had never gotten less than 6 before. Is there a known bug?
---
New game bad. Old game good
---
There was an F2P money making guide on YouTube released not too long ago. I suggest looking that up. Gave a few methods but I forgot them.
---
What do you use the staff for? Zulrah and Olm?
---
&gt; This thread is just a bunch of reddit noobs who don't realize that the fandom one came first.
---
It did! And then all of the admins that had been running the Fandom wiki for years and years moved to a [new site](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki) :-)
---
I use a Firefox add-on to block the fandom domain. I also block the rs3 wiki. it works beautifully
---
no mtx of any kind !!!
---
Hey guys I lurk this sub sometimes but generally am not usually in the loop on many of the meta jokes or issues. Can I get some context on what BIS is?
---
407 KC - 1 jar,3 heads, 2 tails , 2 outta 3 pieces for ring.
---
This task at the moment has been nothing but black dhide,mystic staves and sharks.
---
But regardless of the claw its still one of the best money makers in game.
---
I would say your fastest gp right now would be steel bars at blast furnace. Move up to mith and addy when you can
---
BIS = best in slot

I regularely go over 100 gb with my plan, never get throttled

Studyjng for finals, afk infernal eels all day

You have to overshare A LOT of personal information.
---
A lot of people might have where they live on Reddit. That gives you an IP to spoof so that it looks like the creator is recovering the account. They might also have some link to a 3rd party site with a different username they use. That username might have database leaks with previously used passwords that could have been used for runescape as well.
---
If you've posted your Hans account age/creation date, that's another bit to make the recovery appeal stronger. Add in a few more overly personal details scattered from Facebook/other social media and you could have a VERY strong account recovery form for someone's account.
---
If you're proactive with your account security, have 2fa on everything, don't reuse passwords, and don't share personal info, you will not be hacked by not censoring your name.
---
You'd be surprised, but other MMOs allow GMs to revert and give back items on an account, and all you do is say you spent money on the game and detail what you'd like back.  That's why people think they're entitled to mod help in RuneScape as well
---
thats my fuck that shit it aint profitable enought food

splashing is slow and cheap magic xp and you only need to be active every 20 mins
---
Do you know how many hours people have worked for to get those add ons?
---
 They won’t just be up and implemented into the game. 
---
This is like a runescape HD all over. It would literally take years for them to put all the add ons in that we have now. 
---
And that would be still behind the eight ball. 
---
The real person who misunderstands is yourself
---
Look at osb vs runelite. People would rather use the vanilla cline than use the free version of osb
---
Yeah was planning on getting it over the weekend actually, really don’t know why I held off on that for so long tbh
---
Okay.
---
Fandom was and is hot garbage, but it was pretty much the only place to get that degree of runescape info, so we all put up with the shit pile. No more!
---
I would like to see them similar to implings, where you don't really expect to run across one but when you do and are properly equipped you get loot
---
Quests are for virgins
---
Yeah, I completely agree that there's an opportunity cost of me doing this versus mm2 tunnels and then just going zulrah for more money... But every grind I've ever done for only making money has been incredibly boring. So this just feels more satisfying.

Might depend on your area. I can only speak from my experience, but I am regularly throttled towards the end of the month, especially during the day when data usage is high. It essentially cuts me off from using the internet sans text.

Damn dude hope you feel better soon, I was in the hospital from Dec. 17th - Jan. 7th for an ultra rare blood disease that nearly killed me (100% kidney failure lol) and a couple other times for Ulcerative Colitis, and if I didn’t have Mobile I would have went insane. (I may have been going a little insane by the time I was discharged 🤷🏽‍♂️) HMU if you want a bond or two to get back into P2P.

🦀jagex is powerless against JC Staff!🦀

Just kidding, fuck JC Staff

True true.

Cool! Any specific reason you went for Android and not some lightweight linux distro with java and run the regular client?

And then i stated I had one previously. There was no fake email? Idk where u got that from.

I'd like to thank all of the JMods for the game they helped to create (Oldschool team) just not the JMods in customer support

Get an archers ring (if you can afford it), and make sure your BGS hits high (64 is minimum but it's usually hard to hit that at lower levels, I go for it when I hit 50s but anything below that gives me LONG trips)

My friend got hacked too 2 weeks ago. Auth was on, bank pin set to be canceled. He lost 200m worth stuff, bec he did vorkah and didnt bank after that. Before he got hacked, week earlier, i also did log in and saw that my bank pin was set to be cancel. That moment i was doing zeah rc and hacker(s) did go back excact same tile that i prev logged off. I changed everything and i was lucky. Still we dont know how is this possible, we had pro antivirus (computers were clean), our email was set 2-step auth, almost impossible to hack and passwords were hard to guess and we do change very often. Only possiblility - Hackers hack and get info from Jagex servers and they are too dumb to dectect this, bec hackers are too good. Or there is Mod Jed2, who we still not know.
---
Yea you can't blame jagex for not having anti phishing classes in one of the varrok houses every week. You just need to have common sense with emails and scams. Jagex, nor any company, will ever be able to do anything to prevent you from giving your information to someone else. That responsibility doesn't fall onto them.
---
Looks like you clicked on a phishing email and logged into a fake rs site.

Just get kandarin hard and you can actually boss

Perfect, thank you very much.

At least you've made bank with it
---
Ultracompost only effects crop survival chance with limpwurts. It does not effect yield.
---
There is a highly speculated/known bug, though it is unconfirmed and Jagex cannot find it, that attas seeds and bottomless compost buckets are bugged. That only applies to attas. I have experienced the same issue you did, but never have with any of the other anima seeds or no anima planted.

What IS BIS
---
Only if it comes with copious amounts of junk.
---
Mate that happened to me a lot, its due to the runelite client or maybe I'm too lucky (?)
---
When it comes to account security you can never be too careful. People regularly get their items stolen and Jagex has no customer support. If they get you it's GG.
---
I remember farming for like 6 hours on iron defender, then got the next to almost instantly, if that makes you feel better. RNG is rng

Should have included a picture of a dark crab without the slash mark.
---
that triggers me too :L lol
---
not really, got 1x draconic visage and 1x skeletal  visage
---
Yeah but these days its not dishonor or honor. It just raises skill gap so its BM not to pray vs your opponent.
---
What kind of load out should I use for jad? I’ve just hit 75 range so I’ll be grabbing a blowpipe but someone mentioned the short range and to use Karil’s to aggro/kill things from a longer distance. I’m 1 defence and 45 prayer, should I bring the holy wrench from rum deal or would another brew/restore be a better option?
---
Everyone has their own opinion. What does kandarin hard give
---
the mail you are talking about in at the start of your post.
---
that one sounds like a phising mail, did you click it?
---
Well the original idea I had was 100% chance to heal 25% of damage, rather than 25% chance to heal 100% of damage. I don't think that would be that OP.

I hope your either joking or an ironman because drag tasks are cancer unless their vork

What's all the non BIS posts about
---
i loved that spell back in the day,but it was way too strong lol

Not set to loop??

You were on the verge of greatness. You were this close 👌

Yeah fuck that guy let's send him some more death threats
---
&gt; Random
---
jus press the random button til wiki shows up problem solved.
---
Yep. And while u can just pray melee or time it right, people doing jad for the first time is hard enough. Also with bp youll run underneath jad which will cause him to move and healers can become unhugged.
---
I take account security very seriously and I was hacked too somehow. I've never fallen for a phish, email could've been leaked though. I wish Jagex had better security in place to protect players, like making it take hours or days rather than minutes to get into a players account.

How much did you make on this grind? Damn
---
Which part? The numeral part? 73 is the number that boaty’s HCIM died to.
---
I changed my mind. Last week I said some shitty "mom can we get:" meme was bottom of the barrel. I was wrong.
---
**This** is bottom of the barrel.
---
I put it there because I always click it by accident and it's more out of the way there. Transparent resizeable mode.
---
People sure know how to run a joke into the ground.
---
Let's Go Blues
---
Subjective question maybe, but how much quicker would my Barrows runs be using BP instead of Rune CB and Trident at 75 mage instead of Ibans blast? I'm currently 74 range and 64 mage.
---
Nice, he got a soft throaty chuckle from me
---
Remove non bis memes.
---
Calm down bwana, it’s not like he used the hard r
---
I'm at work so I can't give you a in depth review of all 3, but the last one just isn't thought out because you haven't pked before. Your example of making it so rushers can't fully combo you out doesn't apply because if the rusher isn't 1 ticking his combo he's just bad. and even if that wasn't the case, it would be ridiculously hard to cast this on someone mid combo. So unless you're just standing there with this spell selected waiting to click on anyone who runs at you it wouldn't even work. And even if you were doing that, it would mean you couldn't be risking any of you're gear because if you cast it on them before they attack you you would skull. It would be a very dead spell that's all I'm saying.
---
IS ANYONE HERE A DOCTOR!!!
---
But I dont think its rude and no one has stated why it would be.
---
There was a good meme about using void melee doesn't offer a max hit with a scythe. Useful for ToB but I can't find it :(
---
then maybe don't be so quick to jump with 'WELL THE DEFINITION!!!'
---
If you’ve got a blowpipe, don’t even worry about guthans. Bring 8 brews if you want to be extra safe (6 is generally more than enough), 2 range pots, and the rest restores(maybe a wrench if you have one, works out to be about 1 potion either way)
---
I believe you need like 82 hunter to even do it
---
Just look up parkingmeter’s guide
---
Nice.
---
It’s even a game to game the system. I remember back in 08 when they implemented bounty worlds, but no full pvp loot dropped. I must have read those update notes about 4-5 times and the idea plantes itself: if it’s stated I must risk to lose 75k in value, and that the longer I have spent risking it will increase potential loot (EP), then all I do is go near a remote bank (upstairs southern bank Ardougne) with 75,003gp and some food and wait. I had some people in my cc come through for me to kill them, paying them over installments from restricted trade. First attempt landed me an obby shield, second was my first ever whip. 
---
This slowly spread, and by the next day I already figured out I could box or splash box a friend also risking 75k and we wouldn’t be attacked or interrupted.
---
*Then* they made it so it must be risked while actively in combat. So I changed nothing.
---
PICKLE FIVE DOLLA, HURRY UP AND BUY!
---
What stats do I need for team raids(I'm maxed melee and 87 range
---
There are no more DMM seasons scheduled

Trees you should do for xp while doing ranarrs for gp
---
we will PM crabs if you do

How else are low levels supposed to use the pool and teles and stuff lol

I just paid 100m for 4 runners to get me to 77 in under 10 hrs.

Seems pretty rated so far.

Great taste in music. The re release of that song on Indestructible was excellent

I'm not asking about the hunter level which needs 80. I'm asking about the herblore level because I heard that the higher the herblore level the better the herbs you recieve.
---
If we’re all BIS, none of us are

It's MAAM

No I was thinking of the seed vault, however it makes sense that UIM can’t use them

This is not a dating site.
---
If you like, really grind it out you could pay for a bond in a week. Maybe more. 
---
To be honest, my first account got 99 Thieving so it’s really hard for me to re-do it... but I’m barely level 53 on the new account and I can make 400k an hour while I’m sitting at work. With a rogue set, and some dedication, you can pay for a bond in a week. My buddy is level 70 and he routinely makes a mil every hour.
---
ba...baka!
---
I think your idea could be the most pragmatic and least controversial.
---
Oh lol i was so confused. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Hey, I recently started to get down prayer flicking. A really easy little thing that I came to notice is that you have to assume the next attack, obviously. In this regard, when you think about it this way, it becomes more simple to know what to pray next - you are essentially predicting the coming moves and showing the game that you know them. Grotesque Guardians are a great boss to start to learn some easy flicking.
---
Roaming revenants could be where new pvp armour comes from
---
Well played.
---
He needs to learn the HARD way...
---
🦀.
---
If they behave like other tasks, getting last hit will also give you credit and half xp
---
Your damn right, and I don’t care.
---
All the spells seem like they're partially ripped from Rs3 or world of warcraft, cooldowns really don't fit into osrs that well. Besides venge and magic imbue (lul), and they put a CD on venge because it's incredible powerful, but no one really uses lunars in deep wildy.   
---
The last spell would be useless, no one's going to stop attacking to potentially prevent a, special attack. You said "If someone's falling behind" then they should eat and pray, not do a full mage switch and cast a spell that's going to splash on black d'hide. I strongly encourage you to watch EVScapes video on magic damage to better understand why magic is maybe weak in pvp, but even then it's really not.
---
Let's just delete the internet and restart boys
---
You’re the classic mobile demographic I see, need that *instant* gratification
---
Remove non-bis u/tanmcvail's :^)
---
Congrats you certainly made the right choice
---
Then remove your post, please
---
The issue is that my risk is literally less than what they spend on killing me and it just wastes both of our time.
---
Yeah I don’t woox walk either. I got a new fastest kill yesterday at 1:22 because I hit 3 100s in a row with a ruby bolts. It was pretty cool haha. Do you know if it’s better to use slayer helm or elite void on a blue drag task? I couldn’t tell from the wiki.
---
If he's having trouble switching the thing that helped me the most was turning sound off and watching the bottoms of his front feet. If they come up and point forward pray range. If they come up and are facing the ground mage. For some reason there's only 1 guide I found on youtube that said to do it that way.
---
Most random events don't spawn/end the interaction when you get close to a bank area.  There are a handful of banks that you can use, but in general random don't like banks.
---
Oziach for drops btw.
---
Make your own money, beggar..disgusting
---
No claw no pet no leather at 1000 kc as a pure. Good luck!
---
Fuck, also nice account
---
I will never forget the 6 weeks of recovering from jaw surgery lmao. I ate lots of different soups and milkshakes. If you're overweight, this is a good time to start a CICO diet
---
That doesn't make him wrong. Reddit and Imgur are obsessed with repeating the same dead jokes for years and years, so as soon as something new pops up their immediate reaction is to parrot it tirelessly
---
This is the right answer honestly.
---
You can know when to switch long before the stomp. Look at the bottoms of his feet when they lift up. No need to go back to mage everytime it's super telegraphed when you look at it that way.
---
More nervous about the Sharks than the Avs, who I think we would’ve swept or beat in 5.
---
Regardless, LGB!!! 🎶🎶🎶
---
and then there's the other guy "What is *youre amore* called"
---
I don't think you realise how poor of an idea it is to use ToG on a skill that you can reach 500-1m+ xp/h in. /r/iamverysmart aside, the amount of people not understanding the concept  of "opportunity cost", is a bit ridiculous
---
More common? I don't see how that could be possible, given the nature of those post.
---
Pins are fun to collect. I put them into a wall in the garage out back
---
From what I understand it's still better to use elite void even on task. It's because you're still gonna want to use the salve amulet, and salve amulet buff stacks with elite void but does not stack with slayer helmet.
---
Well there you go, sounds like you have a good grasp on what goes on in the wildy. I'm not sure how much gp you have but, to improve your tank setup take a toxic staff of the dead with spectral &gt; crystal shield. Use the spec for that one minute buffer of meele protection and camp pray mage. Just make sure to not put on bulwark till the protection is over or you lose it immediately if you take off the staff.  It's your best friend. Don't use it too early. use it once the tb has landed and you've started to run south or to hobbs. another tip and this depends on how comfortable you are is turn on auto retaliate. When you're frozen and a team is falled in on you ( following you so you can't tell who is hitting you with which style) auto retaliate allows you to see who is hitting you. This way you can pray switch according to their gear.
---
After he brute forced it, which is just funny.

Thank you Peter! Very cool

If you don’t have a herb he asks you for a Guam, then gives you a strength potion. If you have a clean herb on you he’ll ask for that particular herb, then give you a potion based on that herb
---
Just to annoy you because "muh OCD"
---
No, he's not critical advertiser, he's just someone recommending you go www.twitch.tv./moistcr1tikal for quality content.
---
On the contrary, I think it's always appropriate to resort to insults over the internet because of a difference of opinion.
---
oh yeah your right, would have to be based off membership or they would just make f2p and wait a week
---
Obby maulers use slayer staves and rpg/ham joint
---
You can also look at the bottoms of his front feet. If he lifts up and they are facing forward he's going to stomp. If they are facing the ground it's mage. Combine that with your advice and jad is cake.
---
IIRC void is still better but I can't remember for the life of me why.
---
Bump
---
It has to be the herb run queers that are congregating
---
But like, that's treus dayth who does damage through prayer
---
Wait, no one here commented about the conversation in the background? Your friend needs help!

Just local record in OBS
---
Some of the sounds in game are SO LOUD. when I came back a little over a year and a half ago, I kept hearing this crushing explosion noise. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I got the bandos pet, turns out it was the pet walking that I was hearing so long ago haha.
---
Help :c

Nonkey Muts

Are they allowed to do that? It'd suck if they put in all the work just to get smacked by a cease and desist for violating some kind of IP.
---
The ads themselves aren't against Facebook policies because they don't look that much into scamming in virtual games.
---
The ads go against Jagex's intellectual property but Facebook won't even let you report it after you click "infringing on someone elses intellectual property".
---
Literally Mr Jagex himself has to report them to Facebook or nothing is happening
---
Yeah. Don't try and reason with efficiency scapers

You guys ever hear that saying that arguing on the internet is like the special olympics?
---
They put it in bold in the last news post, and reminded us twice during yesterdays Q&amp;A. I'm sure they tweeted about it too
---
Do you think tears gives you a lamp..? I will add though that OP coulda done the quest but hadn't but a house to get xp I think
---
 The Reddit way
---
One of my friends last I heard hasn't got the pet at 5200 he's higher now. He also hasn't gotten any visage drops since like 100 KC or something.
---
Worth noting as well is that he started killing Vorkath since before collection logs were a thing, so I don't know for sure if the kill count is accurate or not either on what that says.
---
y'all dissing on my boy for fishing trouts and salmons in f2p when it's hella decent xp/hr
---
I think its harder to detect that stuff, otherwise it wouldnt be an issue. They probably have a system worked out of which accounts to distribute the gold to, in order to bypass the detection, along with probably a ton of backup accounts to use when one of the mains gets banned. 
---
Most of these people are likely selling the gold, I don't think as many people are doing it to make their main accounts rich.
---
The construction cape allows you to teleport to your home unlimited times. Can you do this while in combat? 
---
I’m trying to decide if I should just get 83 cons or go for 99 for unlimited travel.
---
30-50 at 1080p, a lot better than I expected lol

---
Could be used as 4th/5th item at KBD
---
Lance, Prims, Torture, Slayer helm, Treasonous(only 300k risk)
---
Or you could do:
---
Lance, Torture, Slayer helm, Dboots, Treasonous. Which makes slayer helm 100% always protected.
---
You can't bring prims AND bring as it will protect over the slayer helm(I care about my recolor, but I guess you could always just buy another black mask for this task alone).
---
If you don't have a problem with it don't worry man. MSB i is super super cheap and very good. Blow pipe is trash compared to price
---
I have a feeling the proportion of depressed/complacent people is higher in OSRS players. This was me and I hated it.

I was wondering when I got mine at 300kc who would be the poor bastard that had to go dry...

What doesn't non-bis even mean??

i think people typically suicide kbd for longer runs, it's a good place to use spare looting bags if done w/ cerb

Different reasons. I collect some and put some on a book bag.

 Could be worse, could be a mutagen
---
Thicc
---
This is what I needed to know. In my head I figure I’d use it to switch to lunars for farm runs, between each farm run for teleports, before and after each slayer task for teleports/ recharge/ fairy rings, and bossing. 
---
I feel like it would negate any other teleport other than a 1 click tab for dangerous situations. If this is the case then I figure I’d use it ton. 
---
I just feel like the 60m might be worth it for all these other skills.

I know lol. But he is a person who took 256 tries to do Inferno so I wouldnt be too hard on someone like that.
---
Dude just go to the monastery, the monks heal you for free
---
This grind made me decide to not renew membership last year. Now I'm doing MMII because I want the agility XP so I can do DSII, and these fucking monkeys are almost making me wish I just went back to MTA.

I see what you did there...

I did the same until I understood the poll questions and what they meant for me. Not that uncommon.
---
Quality
---
Yeah, AND he wants Inferno HARD mode
---
How bout just talk to him you pathetic antisocial cunt
---
These memes will be gone with Jagex's next fuckup of the month
---
still better than this garbage post
---
I would recommend sticking with Zulrah, but if you can still get a good amount of kills an hour at Vorkath I would give it a shot
---
You can guess if it took him legit 256 tries to do inferno and 40 tries to get past wave 31 lol. You can guess what kind of metal capacity someone like that has.

that makes sense
---
yeah i dont want non-BIS memes
---
Thank you, THANK YOU
---
I’m ashamed
---
To be fair, most gaming communities would see this as a perfectly reasonable request; returning items that you spent money on. Jagex has just bullied us into submission over the years.
---
They’re equally as unfunny as the dancing crabs and or misleading title with “NO AUTHENTICATOR DELAY..”
---
I’ve been away from the game for a little while, can someone explains the “remove non-bis” joke

This is so disappointing going on other subreddits which all have standard memes

Never noticed this before despite playing pest control a ton. Thanks asshole &lt;3
---
You can recognize something is a joke but still respond to the general sentiment of it. Jokes are often a way to make a point using a different method of delivery.
---
I feel like you could realize that by the comments on the magic secateurs post (and the many similar ones before it)
---
Dude the japanese text is from a japanese dude who made a japanese parody of swampletics..
---
It's funny that when you point out simple facts on reddit like: "you all used to use the fandom wiki," or "there are still features where the new wiki hasn't caught up," you get downvoted.  How did this circle jerk become more popular than the official forums?
---
They should put Pokémon in RuneScape.

I think he means with d darts in pipe and helm it doesn't matter about the rest

He blended them up.

Well actually, if you wanted this meme to be correct you should have shown you uninstalling from the control panel. Putting a shortcut into your computers trash can does not delete the client, only the shortcut. 
---
F tier meme
---
What’s the value of all this?
---
I've been doing Redwoods, I guess that was worse for the chance then
---
My group just said fuck it and started normal accounts with honor code. I'd totally do it again with real support, and the fact that they're coming at it from a clan angle is also really exciting. It makes total sense. Clan hiscores and Group Ironman hiscores would use identical systems.
---
One just wonders exactly how it would work. How many people per group, what is "group" other than the ability to trade amongst themselves, or is that enough?
---
No. Mobile only and hate questing.

Possible to kill jad b4 all healers are on him but dps thru 4? Prob not

Make sure you speak to the wizard about upgrading the staff to hold 2500 charges instead of 250, too!

what method is this? to suicide 3/4 good items and some food, and then come back with the main 3/4 items and be fully stacked and stay there for a while?

Even if you don't suicide, I guess its better to bring the bring and risk the dboots, than to bring prims and then risk a shitty ring

Not 100% certain, but pretty sure you'd have to swap before the XP drops. Never done hydra so not sure if that's before or after the death animation.
---
Says the one probably overpaying for prayer pots
---
Have we heard anything about it being group content, or is it solo only?
---
You’re going to do one day and never come back to it.
---
didn’t even know he played rs that’s cool
---
99 cooking w/wines, 99 smithing w/ platebodies, 99 fishing w/ fly fishing would be good start for f2p
---
I seen a man at rev caves with bp and void range helm
---
There's plenty of these.  Presumably leveling agility though.
---
It made my dick 4 inches longer
---
What did you do to get 99 crafting?
---
&gt;scazmatar
---
I will never forget that post for as long as I live. I don’t know why I laughed so hard but fucking hell I was crying.
---
Found the auto clicker.
---
Yeah but ardy cloak looks whack. Tbh kind of wish jagex wouldn’t had put so many OP items into the game that make everyone look like clowns (graceful, blowpipe, bludgeon)
---
People like you actually need to and hopefully will be removed from the game via bans.
---
Kinda curious as to what makes you think that tbh
---
Okay I think having a higher range level really helps there, I have pretty low range. Maybe if I pot up+pray eagle or whatever and get some dragon darts I could out dps the healers. I'll try it on my next task.
---
You don't tell me what to do, I upvoted
---
no
---
took long enough
---
You just aren’t a chad.
---
Yeah lots do it there and at monkey bars under edgeville.
---
don't worry, like everything wrong with this game, warding will fix it. /s
---
Try both on the website and in game
---
Sometimes one will work when the other won't
---
May I ask what you did for 99 crafting and how much it cost?
---
Can I get a money bag item hold multiple types of currencies similar to a rune pouch? Just me tho not y'all
---
wow someone used Unpopular opinion: correctly for once
---
This legends got 200M pray xp and hasn’t used it once
---
Implying Bruce Wayne, the billionaire, wouldn't just buy 50 bonds and get an obby cape, bandos, regen bracelet, prims, torture, and an ags. He's the epitome of pay to win.
---
Bogiepop is just one of those Shows where if your not into the psych genre it’s prolly not for you, also I’m pretty sure everyone agrees that madhouse should have animated OP2 but on the bright side a couple of other studios could have animated it that would be wayyyyyy worse
---
can you let me know how it goes? also do you have rigour? I have 99 range/rigour and wondering if I should grind out some Jad tasks for the slayer xp
---
Have you ever thought about doing something more important with your life instead of sitting around on runescape making the most cancerous skill in the game even more difficult than it already is? I mean for real what are you gaining from this?
---
(Now that I’ve thrown this idiot off of his grove I can finally get 35-99 RC with chaos runes)
---
I dont see it as stealing though. I guess we fundamentally disagree
---
He’s better than that and you know it
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
What’s the story here
---
hahahaha
---
I would argue high levels of pvp are harder than any sort of pvm in the game ... the click intensity and room for error is incredibly high. aka , see the 7 way switch ice barrage in 1 tick video
---
D chain from dust devils
---
True. I just thought it looked like iron.
---
Dont get ur knickers in a twist
---
I wonder what percentage of players actually have the cape
---
lmao -100. fantastic
---
thats the max hit of the spec isnt it?
---
Fuck it. Down to settle as twink Robin.
---
It passed
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1557
---
Thanks!
---
Sure will do. No rigour btw. If this attempt doesn’t work I’m gunna sell some gear and buy it and try again
---
He’s in an org (Method) so naturally his job has to come first. He’s said he occasionally afks his account while raiding, and plays off stream.
---
OP lost account.
---
Jagex won’t  help OP recover account. (Don’t blame them)
---
OP post multiple shit posts on this subreddit trying to get in touch with Jagex. 
---
OP can’t get it through his head he won’t get his account back.
---
no amount of customer support can fix your level of brain damage
---
Yeah. I don't know how you guys didn't see this coming. He talked about how long the grind was going to take. Everyone's all "Wow cool he's going through all this hardcore rough work" until it leads to the obvious conclusion that it's gonna take a fucking while to release anything of interest
---
Awesome, thanks. Just waiting for it to actually be implemented then!
---
Remember what we see are like 1-2 weeks in the past easily so he can stay ahead. Its reasonable to assume he is about done with it.
---
Sorry for the noob question, but what does "NH" mean?
---
He needs to get to 85 Slayer and the whip before the next one.  
---
I don't want to do too much math, but he is ~630k exp from the Slayer level. Hopefully the whip doesn't take too long after he can get the Slayer level. Probably another week or 2.
---
I think I got mine at around 120 some qp. Kinda curious how I was progressing relative to others
---
I have nearly 90 prayer from using dragon and baby dragon bones I got from dragon implings. That was on chaos altar though and idk if that is worth the risk on uim
---
Any idea how he lost the account ?
---
s p a g g h e t i   c o d e
---
You could boost that total level up so fast by training construction bro
---
Wow I was way off, alright thanks
---
I don’t think it’s difficult. Btw, dogs feet smell like popcorn.
---
Stats are the same because the power of the bracelet is split evenly between both.
---
just because you can't do it doesn't mean everyone buys a cape, it's been out for 2 years now so you should expect to see more people with them. It is the most punishing and technical piece of content ever released but give it a go, if you're willing to put the time in you can get one too. At first it will seem impossible but just keep at it.
---
Barrows gloves is easy. Always the first goal I go for on an account. Usually have it done around 75 combat and usually end up getting fire cape later on towards 90/100cb
---
Love this series 10/10
---
Then your family needs to pay someone to update that good awful website
---
Maximum from a solo is 28 rolls, iirc. In other words, 14 crates = 392 rolls. Given a 6/150 chance of a hit on the drop table for uniques, the odds of receiving full pyromancer, warm gloves, and torch are actually quite favorable. No hate on OP (because this is still cool, especially the no dupes of gloves/torches), but I would certainly not call this RNG "crazy" lol.
---
&gt;How could this have possibly happened?
---
If you aren't getting hit by one of the braindead options (phishing, download a rat, sharing accounts etc) then the likely option is database leak. You used the same password/email combo for rs and something else- PSN, target card, whatever- and their database got hacked. Then some loser tried every login combo in the entire database and voila, he got yours. This is why people say use unique passwords.
---
I got barrows gloves far before my fire caps, mostly because it’s just easier. Firecapes take a little bit of skill and I was always just scared of it so I avoided it lol.
---
Upvoted for a good unpopular opinion
---
It is unpopular, I disagree
---
Although, both look better than max cape
---
In like all 15 posts he has made, he has yet to specify. Which is why all of us don’t give a shit anymore. 
---
EDIT: typo
---
Idk those dopamine shirts he made look dope and are generic enough that an average person wouldn't know it's RuneScape related
---
Would make way more sense to me to get the gloves first. I've yet to get the cape yet, ever. Lol 
---
I have yet to try though since starting up on OSRS
---
Try writing in a coherent manner if you would like people to understand what you're saying.
---
To address your point, it would be a gross overstepping of boundaries for the government to enforce any form of editorial policy on a private content platform. That is not the prerogative of the government, nor should it be. Any such law would be completely antithetical to the American principle of limited government. If there exists sufficient demand for a social media website that allows unrestricted free speech, then anyone can make such a website and compete in the market against existing platforms.
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking lol.
---
Soon you will get a job, young padawan
---
He has like 6 yellers. Annoying as hell
---
going up soon homie, 73.5 range right now, gotta hit 75 then I think I can do it.
---
I have no problems with metal dragon tasks using Emerald Bolts (e) and Broad Bolts. Lvl 92 Range, Ancient Dhide, Slayer Helm, and Rune cbow. Doesn’t take an absurd about of time and the loot is worth it.
---
This is the new 3T fishing meta song.
---
20k gives you a head start and leaves plenty of room for you to work towards the more expensive stuff, you can't compare that to giving every piece of gear a f2p player would ever need.
---
Yikes!
---
(Link is not a spoiler guys)
---
So it's enjoyable because you can afk it and therefore focus on not playing the game? Okay.
---
Interesting, because his eyes and nose resemble my junk.
---
Why would they bond membership when they can automate creating a bunch of accounts with free 7 day trials
---
should ban their autotypers and then their 99 con house accounts as well.
---
Loads. I did it once and made 13m in 3 hours.
---
How come Bob can say that word but we cant
---
Graduate studies in Engineering pays decently if you're used to living frugally. Being able to play Runescape while I work and study is just a bonus.
---
Hitler. Oh sorry I was just speeding things up.
---
That seems to be a really important aspect for you.
---
The new ctc2 items
---
2100 kc, two eternals, two prims and 7 pegasians :(
---
As someone new-ish to the game (Is 1/4 a year still NEW new?) and unaware of all the P2P stuff... "under an hour" sounds like a very daunting phrase.
---
Everyone knows they just spend the money on drugs
---
Ah yes
---
u/JagexStone well? Where is the update on this, been almost a half a year.
---
Because someone post 2 screenshots directly from the game?
---
thats what i thought. but since it came from @a.jagex.com i thought there was a small chance it was legit
---
You get downvoted but you're 100% right. This has been proven time and time over.
---
From what i can see so far, it will be callisto, this will probably take me a couple of weeks since i also do study on the side, but callisto it is! Loot from 1k callisto comming soon, i will most likely stream most of the kills on my twitch! [Stream link here](https://www.twitch.tv/paxonator)

Toot toot

Use your own house then?
---
Different monster tasks are assigned a "weight", so if a task has a weight of "9" it will be assigned more often than a task with a weight of "5".  You can check the wiki for the different weightings for each slayer master.
---
You go girl
---
This.
---
Had some pretty crazy RNG for the first task.
---
Only needing to click twice from the dark altar after you venerate the essence. One click to run within interacting range of the the blood altar the other to craft. Mainly just saying the running there isn't excessive
---
Oh trust me I do. I'm simply saying this is unnecessary
---
Obby Cape + bandos = credit card use.
---
You got phished, the email was a fake and you gave away your credentials when you followed an email link instead of going through the official website and verifying the information from the message.
---
Never click links from emails. if you get troubling information in the form of an email, manually type in the official address into your browser and follow up on the message.

Well 50m. Still pretty easy to make

if i want to train prayer can i kill ensouled monsters and have it count for slayer xp if it's on task?
---
Well yeah but it's not smart for him to hate the method.
---
Assuming that you meant "efficient" when you said smart.
---
Imagine thinking that just because someone doesn't have fire cape, then they necessarily bought their gold for irl money.
---
Give me and add "Sir Spice" and we can do it together if you ever need someone. I've got an alt too with with nothing but 75 mage and 43 prayer just for scorpia lol.
---
Remove non BIS eyes

under appreciated reference
---
I think my main reason to quit was the fact that it got so easy.

GWD or any boss really isnt really a challange.
---
Skilling got way to afk and way to fast.
---
Coins arent worth anything and Treasure hunter sucks.
---
84 def, haven’t gotten the woox walk down because my ping is usually trash, getting 3 a trip is pretty lucky for me based on range like you said
---
oh, fire for me lol.
---
Sounds good. RSN is "Sink"
---
Damn Dutch OSRS youtubers delivering bad ass content. Reminds me of Verf
---
I don't think thats the problem, I believe he just needs more time to create a video since all he has been doing is griding slayer at temple treking and there is little to no content to make a video from. Spoiler&gt;!He is still 7-10 days from 85 slayer at his current xp rates!&lt;
---
I didn't consider myself a fan boy until I found myself frantically searching his YouTube today...

And you didn’t even invite the subreddit smh

Gz man

I bet you're a creepy virgin.
---
bots can introduce raw materials into the game and affect prices. aside from being annoying, these auto typers don't really have much of an impact
---
not to say I support autotyping but there's definitely a difference
---
Why are you making an ironman..?
---
They only take 10 minutes so may as well do em.
---
“Miles” if this was a typo it shouldn’t be lol.
---
Imagine being so ignorant you don’t even consider that it’s a high possibility.
---
Yeah, I liked the whole craze of restricted ironmans but I feel a lot of them are gonna start dying off due to the inconsistency of uploads due to insane grinds, like the Tirannwn only ironman and their 200-400+ hour grind. That being said, I enjoy the ones that have small enough goals to keep a consistent pace, like GenerateTask, One Chunk at a Time (RIP that series), and Framed's one region at a time
---
You can dual wield a rapier and draman staff?
---
This chad obviously didn’t eat lunch, too much xp waste
---
So, approx 30m a year x 14 years, 420m?
---
An auto-typer is a bot but not all bots are auto-typers is really what I was getting at. 
---
The thing is though that these bots aren’t just annoying. They give these 99 con players an extreme influx of money. They have around a dozen bots advertising at one time and they’re bringing loads of players into their house. These players leave tips... money is consolidated onto these people because they broke the rules of OSRS to get their name out there.
---
Just now I'm realizing I think I like Robin more, since I've watched more teen titans than any batman material.

Oof just looked at it. It's gone down more in a month than my total bank value.

No worries mate
---
Wouldnt use at dks either unless a low level. Your effectiveness there comes from how quickly you can pump out damage, not how little damage you can take.
---
Honest tho, jokes aside
---
You should because of wintertoad 
---
Lower hp the better

So he doesn’t get combat xp

Should they though if it's good and awful?

Is it dramen or slayer?

Nope just the necklace which when I got it was like 20 some mill.

It can be a bit risky, and Prayer level in order to use Protect Item to be more safe if you get PK'd, but killing chaos druids can be a good way to get xp plus gp per hour!

Maybe I was on at the wrong time, but the whole sub for the week I was a part of it was mostly talking about tournaments, pro players, insanely detailed analysis, and strategies that I had never heard of using acronyms I had never heard of. No one asked what any of it was and no one explained, because apparently everyone already knew. I’m not a novice to the games, I know every characters move set and do pretty well online but I had no idea what the hell anyone was talking about
---
It seemed like a community that existed for its current members who have great knowledge of the game, but didn’t have much for the low or mid level players to get to that level.
---
It’s like logging onto this sub after playing in 2007 and seeing nothing but deadman mode, tick manipulation, zulrah, and elite clue scroll rewards.
---
&gt; If you have a an argument against my points and points for why it should be hard tier, enlightenen me
---
Because elite diary rewards should be useful to more than the &lt;1% of players who are completionist pet hunters? Because maybe the boss would be slightly less dead content if it wasn't such a pain to get to before you have the elite diary? Because the desert diaries are already categorically shit, and could do with some improvements? Because putting ropes and an agility shortcut on the current hard requirements doesn't *force* anyone to kill the KQ any more than the 1 kc required already?
---
Your argument only makes sense in the context of crippling elitism, keeping the boss annoying to get to for all the kills that anyone who *isn't* a pet hunter will likely ever do.
---
These were so annoying, had to crash one for every inventory of eclectics when I was on the grind. They littered every world.
---
you know it baby
---
Bro this kid is fucking ALWAYS doing this shit. Even before swampletics legitamitely EVERY update vid on his UIM started off with an apology. My man, i have been lied to by beautiful women, ugly women, my boss, my president, the list goes on... but my man dont keep giving me an apology because after the 30th time i can smell the bullshit that festers, thats is being conjured, by your apology. Good day

The dramen staff should be offhand anyway - it serves little purpose in the main hand slot, and fairy rings could still be accessed.

Nearly 2 months sober. Longest I've ever gone since I started drinking. I feel the best I have in years. Thanks for asking man

Lmao rip
---
Wow really! Maybe I just had bad RNG when I did it last. Thanks for telling me. This makes Jad tasks way easier cause I embarrassingly die sometimes when the healers spawn and I tag them and I switch prayers a little too late. I'll just pot up and pray and maybe swap in Rune and I should easily shred through him. Thanks.
---
Let me find out the next video has 300 hours worth of content. The mans got drive.
---
eyyy good luck next time fam. when healers pop you dont even have to rush. wait for a boss attack and tag one. switch prayers a few times and tag number two, do same and tag three. yawwwwn to yourself at how easy it was for you that time. YOU GOT THIS

You mine special essence near the blood altar that is untradeable and you run the essence to the altar. Graceful set is basically required otherwise you won't have enough run energy.

It won't magically remove stews from the game no, but it will normally remove stews from the GE, which will cause the price to rise, and which will effect the margin obviously because all the stews that were at outlier prices will have been bought up.. as long as people are buying them for the long flip then the people buying for the flip won't have an issue because the price will constantly  be on the rise, meaning the margin between the price they bought at and the selling price is growing (theoretically) infinitely. Until the people who are playing the long game decide to get out at which time a flood of stews will hit the market tanking the price again and anyone caught on the downside will lose money whether or not they are short term or long term flipping.

At least there's already a handy guide on YouTube

Just how it is, man. "Mil" was a popular abbreviation for "million" before OSRS, and people do type just "m" sometimes.
---
I believe it's 1 range bonus but vambs have a +1 prayer. Whether he has b gloves or not I'd say vambs are better for people struggling just cause of the slight prayer you get.
---
85? Why the fuck have I been thinking abyssal demons were 92 Slayer? Time to grind out 9 levels.
---
&gt;For anyone thinking they might ever try to antiscam: it’s not gonna work. You aren’t as smart as you think you are.
---
Unless you actually know what the fuck you're doing, don't try to antiscam. It definitely works, provided you actually know what the fuck you're doing and don't do stupid stuff.
---
yes but i cant set combat level to 300...
---
Nice headset!

Nice dude! I still have troubles with Jad and some of the waves before him, and I’ve been playing since 04-05ish? I’ve pretty much already thrown the idea of an Infernal Cape out the window lol. Enjoy the dope cape!

Yessir, the example you gave doesn't violate any of the game rules and would be completely fine!

You just calculate the accuracy without adding the wildy bonus. Use the dps calc by Bitterkoekje is you don't know the formula yourself (make sure wilderness is disabled in the spreadsheet obviously)

Maybe people will find another unproductive outlet. However, it is also possible that the boredom can cause someone to do something more productive and life-building. I am all for Runescape but I understand now that unless you are a streamer, it does not offer much benefit to one's life. An hour a day is fine, but too much is unhealthy. 
---
I should know, I used to play this game 10 hours per day. Although it can be fun, it can also be an inhibiting factor to the pursuit of happiness.

Based on purple rares, so if you're only looking for like 5-10m then you'd be better off probably doing zulrah or vorkath... But if you're trying to make 100's of millions or more then you'd be better off raiding.
---
For CoX, ~ half of your estimated gp/h comes from tbow. Meaning if you were doing highly efficient raids, you could expect to make ~ 4.5m/h not counting tbow drops. Tbow is estimated at around 30,000,000 points per bow, which translates to ~ 1/1000 30k point solos, ~1/500 60k point trios, or ~ 1/333 90k 4+1's.
---
For ToB, again around half of your estimated income comes from scythe. Scythe is roughly 1/190 (using Oblivion's estimates for 0 death raids), and drop rate is the same no matter team size. So running casual 4 mans you'd expect to make ~ 4m/h without getting scythe drops, or highly efficient duo's / 2+X's ~ 9m/h without scythes. However, by best estimates scythe is far more common than tbow is. 
---
To put these into time measurements... If you can do consistent 20 minute 4+1's (counting time to regear, and assuming prescouted raids) you could expect to see a tbow in ~ 111 hours of raiding. If you can do consistent 20 minute 4 man ToB, you could expect to see a scythe in ~ 63 hours of raiding.

What is recommended for fighting chaos druids ?

Here's exactly how the cannon rolls its accuracy.
---
When using melee, the cannon's accuracy depends on your current attack bonus OF THE ATTACK STYLE YOU ARE USING. So if i was using a cannon at some dragons and had a hasta, if my hasta was set to stab, the cannon would be more accurate than if i had my hasta set to slash. (Cuz the hasta provides more stab attack bonus than slash) It also takes into account your attack level like any regular attack roll.
---
Ranged is simpler. Like the craw's bow. Style doesnt matter cuz there is only one ranged attack bonus. It just looks at the bonus and your ranged level. 
---
Magic weapons are calculated the same way as melee, except for tridents. (Since you can't melee with a trident) For tridents, the cannon will choose the highest attack bonus out of ranged, stab, slash and crush and your level in attack or ranged. 
---
tl;dr, For melee: cannon rolls off of the attack bonus of the current attack style you are using. For ranged: just rolls off of ranged attack. For magic weapons: will roll off the highest of any of your bonuses. (Unless its a staff that can melee, then it rolls off of melee)

Where is that place
---
You can straight up buy them for real cheap at the warriors guild. There's not enough stat boosting demand to affect the price as much as you may think.
---
Somewhat agree, but replace fire cape with Barrows Gloves. Fight caves is MUCH harder objectively than the rest, which are literally unable to be failed, merely  time sinks. Quests on the other hand, are also unable to be failed, (Except maybe DS2? But even then, after enough tries, Ruby bolts will rng you to a win). That said, I also don't think epeen flexing is cool, so on that token I guess I disagree with your point on principle.
---
An item intended for use at rev caves isn’t really viable at rev caves, I don’t do a lot of rev killing but it makes sense to buff it or tweak i to give it a use.
---
Prayer actually does affect cannon accuracy. Special bonuses don't affect cannon though e.g. wildy bonus, tbow effect, slayer helm, void etc.
---
Really wish people would leave him alone and let him work. Do people have nothing better to do than annoy youtubers? It’ll be out when it’s out, find something else to do.
---
BIS stands for Best in Slot, it's just the current trend of memes on this subreddit.
---
yeah and thats fine. Normalization of regular use of the n word however has negative implications/consequences for black people. Plus it sets a bad precedent for black people that play osrs come on the sub, see this shit, and get turned off. This and other things alike towards different kinds of minorities only increases barrier of entry for them into video gaming culture. And what for? So some white kids can continue to enjoy being able to say the big bad words?  
---
Words should be used responsibly. Just because people live a life of privilege and the connotations behind words don't really have any effect on them doesn't mean it doesn't have an indirect effect on others.
---
Wildy slayer, maybe you'll even get a task of green  dragons to increase your profit
---
He does, it's just that you don't know what opportunity cost is.
---
This is a fucking hilarious thread, I love every comment that's spawned off the OP
---
Dude I really like the rapier and dramen staff combo looks so unusual but fits the game so well ahaha
---
Besides slayer aha
---
This is stupid, even for you.
---
Big grats!! Currently 21.6m dry myself :/ What else did your post 99 farm runs include? I'm currently only doing cactus, hardwoods, redwood, hispori, and and spirit seeds I get from pvm.
---
Doesn't need all that, Bruce Jenner is a hero.
---
Broooo this looks so dope, I really like the firecape in the end, I hope to see more of ur drawing
---
The only possible use I could MAYBE see for it is a low level ironman kicking imps for it so they could have an ammy with glory stats without having to grind out crafting. And I really don't see anyone doing that.
---
..?
---
I just over appreciated the heck out of that reference. Still the best concert ive ever been to
---
Robin funded fire cape asking for handouts at GE
---
Yes, there's just a few neckbeards on here who like to project that all the time to feel slightly better about themselves by pretending everyone is as sorry as them.
---
Al Kharid mine, outside Duel Arena.
---
It's not nearly as bad as people make it seem. I did b2p, infinity boots and master wand in like 3 days.
---
If you're willing to put in the grind and want it, go for it. If not, no shame in holding off until you're more comfortable. Or if you want a grind in-between in cost and time, bring 28 dragon bones to the wildy chaos altar.
---
Oh shit your balls are on top too?
---
what's wrong with slayer?
---
agility's next :)
---
2 outta 3 ain't bad
---
I always get shit tasks
