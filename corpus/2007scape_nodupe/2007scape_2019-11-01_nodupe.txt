i know this only effects a small majority of the game who enjoy the competitive side of castle wars, but unless there is a smuggling bug or exploitation, i see no reason for this to happen? also can we take buckets into the game? the bucket spawn is 1 minute as well and also has grief issues.

Right I’m an asshole for being bothered by people not understand a game that’s been out for literally years. Or not understand the concept of YouTube that probably has thousands of money making methods

Just casually miss the part where that's not what they said? Huge difference between *have* and *make* bud

First of all in adolescence, pretty much every decent parent pays their kids way. Food, housing, healthcare, potentially school. No shit, you need money to live. The more money you have, the more you can and will spend. What the fuck does that say about a person? If anything it should be positive as true success takes hard work 
---
Trying to turn this into a defining generalization is one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard, and honestly pretty sad. Reality is they (or anyone with such a baseless outlook) probably wouldn't fit in with such a crowd regardless of material possession/status

Oh really? That's strange that they hid it in such a weird way, and honestly it's super greasy that they offer plugins such as those.

As a kid I used to make coffee and put it in a thermos. I would hide it in my bathroom. Set an alarm at 2am. Sneak downstairs and grab my laptop. Then go back upstairs and play runescape and drinking coffee to stay awake

eh if i got mine taken away after buying it i'd probably just open a dispute on paypal.

Imagine being friends with cheating cunts lmao

Hope they both lose em pal

Did I say cut off all video games? No. I said go out more. Don’t waste away in a basement while other kids are enjoying life. It’s a fact that more social interactions=lower chances of depression. Yeah you can have your online friends your whole life but how are you gunna do in a work environment where you need to communicate and relate to people face to face. Video games are good but should be limited when you are young. I would of never of had my experiences if I stayed inside the whole time. I’m not going to remember every match of call of duty but you are damn sure I’m gunna remember getting my first kiss on some dock with a girl I stole a beer from my parents for

Hey, man. I’m not not saying “fuck you” to OP. He can live his life however he wants. Some of us just think it’s unhealthy and that people shouldn’t look up to it. What’s wrong with that?
---
&gt; instead of seeing 10 ashes it appears ashes (10)
---
Gonna be a pedantic bitch here but the parentheses are for when it's stacked, in this case banknotes since ashes aren't stackable. When it's individual items it will say "Ashes x 10"

I remember breaking down in tears while doing dragon Slayer. I just landed on Crandor, I had food, gear, and even a potion... But wait, where was my anti-dragon shield? I had equipped my rune kite because I felt like such a badass... I thought I had lost everything.

I’m 20 almost 21 now and I think I’m going to retire soon. I remember I was in 8th grade when OSRS came out and it was like yesterday. At least you recognize how good being 16 really is, don’t take it for granted because life doesn’t get any simpler nor easier from there bro.

It really SHOULD be a simple thing. It isn't a complex task. I agree it might not be, but if so, that is the fault of Jagex

@OP - is that top right pic taken from one of those lo-fi vids on youtube?

Yeah I can grind 5pm to 2am, get 4 hours of sleep and still function semi decent. After a few weeks I’m completely fried but a day here and there isn’t bad at all
---
I think they were more talking about just tabs - so that you could have the same amount of overall bank space but just a bunch more categories.
---
They've in the past said that they're more or less at the limit for bank spaces in a single bank without absolutely killing performance. Though the option of having 2 banks or other places to hold things (much like the seed vault) could work just as well.
---
BUT is more space really needed? Anyone that has a full bank probably has at least 100 slots of trash.

People call me a bond buyer/using parents credit card alll the time because I wear full bandos, ghrazi, avernic as a level 100. It's annoying, but those people are probably just jealous and sad/angry irl. I just spend 70% of my time in this game flipping/making money

Hand them to him after the quest and don’t click out the dialogue after getting the amulet... I added something there.

But WoW is like 50% standing around in whatever the hot city is this expansion waiting for something to happen.

Really lucky. I have an older post on my reddit account about it from a few months ago. Maybe I should make a video on it man because it’s actually crazy how many times I got way under drop rate. To sum it up I got a craws bow a month into the account off of the 5th rev imp I killed.

Yeah, but they don't want to set a precedent of helping people when they fuck up on an individual basis. Think of all the extra work that would be

Your brain is smooth

You can use quests to skip a lot of early levels and get some gp, it's a lot easier to start in members so you dont have to deal with f2p bots. Set small goals for yourself like all f2p quests, easy achievement diaries, 50, 100, 150, quest points, go for barrows gloves. If you have any questions feel free to comment or pm me I'll help as best I can

Gielinor and RuneScape are synonymous, [according to the RuneScape wiki](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Gielinor). I believe RuneScape could alternatively be represented as the universe the world takes place in, with Gielinor being the planet.

I would try to play as exploratory and free roaming as possible, but don't be afraid to look things up if you know you'll get burnt out trying to solve it. The game has massive progression shortcuts if you are an experienced player, use the wiki if you find yourself unable to progress

I prefer RS's gameplay to EVE. I mean, in RS you can actually do stuff to level skills instead of just planning out your skill queue for months at a time and waiting.

I believe the first one is "On the peninsula in the north-easternmost corner of the Wilderness, north of the Wilderness Volcano." - straight copy &amp; paste from osrs wiki.

The second is on the isle of stone that is unlocked after The Fremennik Exiles Quest.

Considering just yesterday we had a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dpgii4/can_we_do_something_about_this/) on the front page complaining about link spam bots, I'd say yes

Yeah but what if it doesnt be the way it do though? 🤔🤔

As a warning, if you dispute charges on your card, you'll go into negative jcoin balance on that account (and the card specifically IIRC) meaning if for whatever reason you get it back or use that card again you'll need to pay. Arguably they'd not be obligated to refund previous membership, I mean you paid and they supplied their product (membership) for each month.

slayer helm does make it significantly easier. That extra boost can also give you more confidence. I'm sure some people bought capes after failing 5+ times just because its frustrating and demotivating. Also some capes were removed that were obtained 1 year ago. a lot can change in 6months, much less a year

I’m glad you’re enjoying the game, remember to keep your posture in mind while you play :).
---
You should definitely do some more!

Same, can get 2-3 kills just tanking no switches.

From my experience, prayer switching is not worth it until i got a spectral SS since the price of p pots are so expensive compared to monkfish.

*buys bond for 5.5M gp*
---
The ranged is more useful,  but how you planning to train them?
---
Training range should cost basically zero money, even afk with mithril darts should only cost a 100k or so, unless you want to do it really fast like with a blowpipe in nmz or something
---
Fuck ya 8k
---
This is late-30s life with kids as well. Waking up early on the weekends before anyone else is up is the only time I can game in peace.
---
This is meant to be an RPG, you progress your account as you play it. Adding a tournament world with the ability to do ANY boss is bad. Tournament worlds haven’t been around forever; people successfully did CoX, Tob and inferno without them before but people are going to whinge about not having free practice at them now which is a joke. Successfully getting your first kill against zulrah in max gear isn’t an accomplishment and I’m sorry that you think it is. It’s sub 1 minute boss lol
---
Christ I feel so inferior when I see big dick chads like you on here with 500kc at vetion. Might as well just neck myself now, knowing I’ll never surpass or even dream of reaching the heights that you have. What the fuck is the point of life when there are people out there who are so fucking insanely perfect that no one else can even comprehend the life of such a divine, supreme being
---
This is the last time you’ll all be hearing from me, after seeing this guy I’m done. The majesty of this ultimate Chad is currently blinding me into submission and I can’t stay conscious for much longer. This is it for me boyos. It was nice knowing you all

Petition to instead raise subscription costs by .05 and give that to runelite devolopper

They were more than that back then
---
Can only lend 1 item at a time.
---
Yah, I think something like that would be a good solution. Also, I think it might be worth making the Rune Pouch a "PvP Untradeable" where it degrades to "broken", dropping 75% its repair cost in coins. The cost would need to be balanced to something reasonable, but that could be a nice improvement for PvP; especially deeper wilderness with the Parchment.
---
2008 had some hidious weapon re-designs and everything tended to look very plasticy, people tease rs3 for bad designs but oof, it was honestly an improvement over the restricted trade era in some cases.
---
Lmao really??? 😂😂😂
---
You could only lend 1 item at a time to prevent exactly this.
---
Database storage.
---
Yeah, I agree. Spellbook icons can be made bigger on mobile by filtering. I imagine the inventory scaling could be accomplished by having 3 items per row, and a scroll bar on the side to get to the bottom of your inventory. Or 2 items per row or 1 item per row, then the icons would be much easier to tap with huge thumbs.

You are wound pretty tight and I actually find it humorous that you so courageously fight for the rights of the “rich kids that did nothing wrong”, most rich people don’t need white knights, that’s why I found your stance humorous from the beginning.

$5/$11🦀 memberships. Jagex was just a proxy used to mask his true identity and sources of revenue. Dear god what if he owns a share in the sand casino black market too!

Some of it is that your circadian rhythm is different as a teen. Not so much that gaming itself is less fun now that I’m in my late 20s but now I’m tired at night and naturally wake up earlier.

Both of these are bugs in my opinion. I was surprised myself to learn that "0-prayer" flicking was an official mechanic displayed on the OSRS wiki. I mean, prayer drain (and the associated prayer-drain-rate for each prayer) is an official mechanic for a reason right?
---
That’s pretty dope honestly
---
You didnt do that in 1 year, unless you're a NEET of course.
---
Play iron
---
What jagex qualifies as a bug and what's not is very unclear
---
Some uses of game mechanics are allowed and even encouraged - while others aren't
---
People who do inferno cape achievements literally abuse fake logging every single wave, which is more blatantly a bug than what I did, yet jagex is fine with it
---
just seems weird standards. There's also other players who abused the same bug I did but I was hte only one punished

Setup cannon near chaos ele, get to lms while stalling the cannon, obtain 99 range boost and release stall, kill chaos ele without gaining range xp.
---
What's your gear set up pal
---
Thats how it works atm m8.
---
 I’ll come by 🥰
---
Iron is a what you would call "try hard mode". I'm a casual gamer bro. Like the millions of others. Thanks for the suggestion though!

Fake

unironically this is what should have happened at the start despite your downvotes but it’s way too late to do anything now
---
You gotta stick up your ass man
---
rainmeter is my go-to
---
Would be really cool if they combined the ice and fire giant into one single bossfight, I could see tons of possible boss mechanics involving the synergy of fire and ice. The most natural would probably be to combine a fire and ice key half which are dropped by fire &amp; ice giants/creatures, and maybe a method of converting one type of key into another.
---
What's not to like about the Fischer Price Dragon Scimitar
---
Yiu can buy them at slayers store tho.
---
give it another try. also look into mage only method.
---
Reported.
---
Since many people seem to mix up 2 different lms bugs; the one he used didn't take lms stats outside the minigame, he set up the cannon before then hit chaos ele while inside a lms game.
---
I dont understand where you would even get that observation but yeah fuck you too. I work and like to afk and not worry about dying and losing all my progress. I think you are the one with a stick up your ass sir.
---
prayer drain, cost of use and weighing when to use it/when not to use it is inherent in the game. it was designed that way.
---
tick manipulation is a bug. it can be fixed but the developers chose not to. i think their decision was incredibly short sighted.
---
You can go to the house party world and use someone’s else poh with the occult altar
---
Haha I just hit 2k feel a bit dead inside but almost there
---
Dont trust scammers, lurers or antiscammers.

Go back to the same altar and do the same thing you did to transfer to the book to remove it.
---
one of my discord friends created an imp emote and called it :AnalBeadBandit: like last year it never fails to crack me up

So I just talk to the same guy again. Jesus I’m a noob
---
Literally all they have to do is go into the text file containing the player in question and type the item id into an empty inventory slot. That's assuming they don't have the functionality on the rotten potato to do it in-game
---
Who's Jeffrey Epsteim?
---
Tried to get that double XP? Or were you one of the first 15 people to search a YouTube channel for 50m?
---
it only gets worse when you get older enjoy your childhood bro
---
UwU wait for me,
---
bro 😎💪
---
I think adding a lap timer to the Prifddinas course was a great idea cuz I have a lot more motivation to keep going and trying to beat my record (1:07 btw) which then makes me get better xp/hr. If all courses had that I'd approve for sure.
---
100k per slot, fixed? Nah
---
Make this a progression starting from 1k and exponentially growing or something
---
That explains why people cry so hard about getting pked
---
Can confirm people still do this - anytime I make my alts Slayer Partners then go to my task at a cannonable spot, I get yelled "bot," "fucking bots", "I'm an ironman and am going to get you banned for disrupting my behaviour." It's funny. Also it doesn't work for them because I let them hop.
---
Beat in spot, for when you get an item so good you have to unzip and beat it on the spot
---
😁
---
Where's Inkvember day 1?
---
id take 10 year old innocence and stress free life over adulthood anyday
---
bro if you've prayed mage/range/melee and clicked eagle eye in one horizontal motion countless times it just becomes a habit. Same with diagonal mystic might or mystic might to barrage. https://youtu.be/79QXmW8q6Mo?t=13  I literally have a video you can see as evidence that im not talking bullshit here if you cant see how much of a habit it is by watching it I don't get it. If you can truly go from my level which is pretty shit in this video but just in terms of habit and then in one fight on a med level or LMS for example you can straight up rigour and augury in the bottom right corner then Im in awe of you.
---
I don’t even play rs anymore but these posts give me so much nostalgic joy
---
Thank you
---
Cool give me the option to not pay the extra $4 if I don’t want to play rs3 then
---
You're incredibly ignorant, laughably so. 
---
All non QoL pvp content added has had negative consequences on the game.
---
Pvp is dying because the vast majority of the player base is killing it by voting no to pvp content (rightfully so). 
---
I have definitely pvp'd and participated in the first 2 DMM's teaching top 100 in the first. 
---
The game does revolve around players just like me, If it didnt, we would be getting more pvp content and less PvM content. But, as the records show. Pvm heavily outweighs pvp. 
---
More logical? I dont know what's more logical than statistical evidence showing that people dont want pvp content and that pvp content negatively impacts the economy when it is introduced. You can literally see alchables crash on the release of revs.
---
&gt;Just look at rs3 they have a crap ton of partnerships, and the game is beyond dead
---
Please name them. And before you do, keep in mind that like you said, a partnership is, by your own words "partnering with other company’s", so don't come back and say "Treasure Hunter" or "Soloman's store", that stuff is simply MTX.
---
Nostalgia and Runescape are both super cozy. Runescape nostalgia is double cozy. People love being cozy from fall through the holidays.
---
Big time
---
The only other level 3 I know with pet used the same bug and jagex didn’t remove it
---
And Imbued heart lmao
---
0tick prayer flicking where you always have prayers activated but lose no prayer points can 100% be fixed from the game.
---
And jagex has already done certain patches to prayer flicking to make it less viable
---
Very dependent on location.

If you want helpful feedback try r/typography

Sea shanty 2 on repeat

They refunded that Ironman who lost his stuff due to rollback being shitty after tbow bug. Probably a few others as well
---
Have you been training some construction lately cause i see a trend.
---
I’d recommend msb (i) with rune arrows if you want nmz

Because there were more kinds of wood than there were kinds of metal though they could have excluded teak and mahogany.
---
I think ita supposed to be used as an onomatopea
---
Swap the lame lo fi beats with weed or something
---
This is actually fake news lol, they've done quite a few updates to make sure that players don't have to rely on 3rd party software, stuff like Shift+Drop, Make-All, World map, Minor interface tweaks, Attack options.

Herb Boxes most likely

I stay cozy year round because I never stop playing

It's literally whoever gets the death rune loses

No thanks instead increase it to $15a month and implement all RL plugins into the base client.

Yeah but rune dragons alts are very easy/low effort to make. Wrath alts would be annoying at least until 77 rc

If I’m understanding the blog and what I’ve seen of the beta, emblems will no longer be tradable so the only way to get the pouch is either do BH or do slayer. Im not saying it’ll ruin anything. 
---
I do find it peculiar though that emblems were changed to be tradable back in 2017 and more easily accessible through slayer which essentially made the rune pouch tradable in the way the meme describes. Having them tradable seemed fairer to PvPers too, but I might be wrong on that.

Good job

runelite removes prayer reorder, well there goes my muscle memory

EVscape is a sketchy guy right? Ive keep hearing stuff.

Yeah lol it was like 100 hours

I actually sold the dragon pickaxe for closer to 7m
---
He said above that he did 5k kills pre-collection log.
---
To their defense the infernal capes are super easy to detect.  Every bot you ban 10 more are created its kinda hard to contain
---
75 range for blowpipe with addy darts, rest of gear is fine. If you have extra money get blessed hides instead of regular black dhide but not that big of a deal.
---
Reminds me of what happened to me, getting Bottomless Compost Bucket on my first Hespori kill.
---
Just smart mechanics
---
How many darts would you recommend bringing?
---
Yeah no need to make death even remotely punishable right boys
---
I was thinking more along the lines of 1m each for the first 50, 2m, 5m, 10m each respectively for the next batches of 50.

With additions such as seed vault we dont need more bankslots but rather more options to store certain items like the costume room in POH and seeds in the seed vault. If you as Ironman are still struggling with bankspace maybe you should clean it up and alch alot of the trash you have.

So he's just as likely to get 3rd age if he opened it outside wildy

I didn't know all of these were one person. Your post history is amazing

How are teleblock and snare drama tho? The people that wanted it couldnt vote for it so it was actually pretty great it got through anyway

Prepare to sacrifice a good portion of your life to the game.  OSRS is basically marriage.

I just got my new PB today of 28:40 with dragon darts, vengeance, and a tbow

I want to get more use out of blurite so so much. When i was a wee'un i kept blurite bars in my bank, convinced itd be someday useful. Yes please, to all of this!

I don't care about this

I didn't get it.

Tweet them. Unfortunately jagex don’t seem to care about poor customer support.

There's honestly few places in the entire game world I can think of that take me more than a minute or two to get to.

I mean I could but what would I do with 10m body runes?

That's my hardcore BTW.

I bet you have a tab full of garbage seeds and another tab with garbage treasure trail items.
---
83 construction for a max house is super nice and makes a lot of things way more convenient.  Though I dont think you could get a fairy ring or spirit tree which are nice QoL in a house.  74 prayer for rigour is nice.  For mostly just slayer, agility also comes in handy for getting to certain spots and specifically bosses.

Hey, I replied to you in a different post: I'd deleted my jagex cache, but after a while it just went back to dcing. There's probably also just a general server problem.
---
There is so much more content when your'e a member. You have basically nothing left to do in f2p assuming you have finished all the quests.
---
Odd of you to use Veracs against Vetion but gratz on the ez bank.
---
And removing all capes of buyers is intended. After you get the first one you can get the slayer task and use slayer helm. When Jagex removes cape they also remove the KC and ability to get tasks. If you can then go and grab it again yourself, you get to keep it.
---
Stop being a bitch and take accountability for your mistakes.

Now the solution:

Look for that pharagraph and follow that link to attemt a account recovery request as a solution to request access to your account in case you still have 2FA but lost access to the linked email like a dumbo
---
WOW gonna expose me like that huh
---
You are lost my friend. The topic was wildy slayer vs other slayer not what's the most money in the wilderness per hour.
---
I got my combat stats to 85,85,85 on f2p before ever once being a member. I know people who got 99 wc on yew trees and various other 99s while f2p. I think you underestimate scalpers who can play 18 hours a day at that age.
---
Well first off a bond is 2 weeks. There are numerous methods that can get you a bond in less than 10 hours will literally no stats. Your stats are already considerably better than most peoples' when they first become a member, so there are even more options available to you. One that comes to mind is turning logs (probably teak to start) into planks in the Woodcutting guild since you already have 60 woodcutting.
---
That one would be pretty menial, but it's just one of dozens of things you could do. There are many videos out there showcasing different money making methods. [Here's one I found for mid-level accounts with a quick google search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VYUomLtLw)
---
The one thing I'll stress to you is that f2p has access to maybe like 5% of the content in this game, if even that. There is SO much do to once you gain membership that you'll be fighting the feeling of being overwhelmed more than you will be searching for things to do. That's why I stressed spending your 2nd week focusing on the whichever money-making methods seem doable to you rather than exploring, because it is very easy to get caught up in all the newness and forget that your time is almost up
---
What exactly is a "max house"? How do I get fairy ring and spirit tree in the house?
---
What agility level is nice to have?
---
RIP
---
Not to sound like a dick. But this is also your fault. You invest your time into an account which had a deactivated email. My best bet is to try to recover the account or tweet them @JagexSupport.

FiNaLlY
---
Yeah I’m feeling it.. what do pvm content could I do in p2p to earn a bond? It doesn’t have to be afk but I’d prefer to earn in 12 hours of play time. Is it possible? Or am I delusional? Recently I’ve just been playing some LMS f2p but it’s getting boring cause I’m not torvesta level pker haha
---
Wildy slayer used to be good money is seriously the first line of this post fam 😂
---
How do you like it?? I remember everyone being hyped about it 12-18 months ago... then I quit all video games during that time and am just now coming back... it’s either wow classic or back to osrs
---
Yes, every plugin on the current runelite build is legal.
---
From what I've seen on the runelite discord, Adam was given a greenlight to keep the bones menu entry swapper.
---
If im introducing someone to runescape one of the first things i tell them is to not even bother with f2p. The game is just so underwhelming to play whilst being f2p. Its like buying a car and only using the first gear.
---
Suicide looting bag method allows you to take twice the amount of supplies you normally could.
---
Its also worth mentioning that with a twisted bow you often skip the ghost special attack, which saves a considerable amount of restores.
---
You don't get banned for MES on bankers currently.
---
People would definitely oppose it.
---
Take the xp/hour and divide it by the xp given per salamander. This will give you salamanders per hour. From there u can figure out the rates
---
You will roll for the loot table of the brother that pops out of the chest if you kill him.
---
Is the reward chance still 1/100k with the mimic?
---
Yes, you can. If the last brother doesn't spawn in the doors, he will 100% spawn when you attempt to open the chest
---
It's almost certainly not that
---
You can buy it from a slayer master for coins. There is no pain in the ass.
---
You've got decent stats for Barrows. Grind out Morytania hard diary first, it gives 50% more runes per chest which massively increases profit.  
---
Get melee stats and range up to 80's, prayer to 70, shouldn't take long. That will start to open up more boss PvM.
---
This isn't a calculator saying those are bad xp or gp/h and it's not saying you should skip those. I haven't tried it yet but it looks like you have to copy the sheet, edit the last 4 colums and then you can see in the top right if it's sustainable or not (ie. if you'll run out of points to skip).
---
A E S T H E T I C
---
Remember when we used to have to calc the xp left till level ourselves...
---
Who hurt you?
---
85 magic and 88 range; was planning on barragging a bit and using chins to get these skills a bit up
---
Magic or blowpipe for mimic? What is cheaper and how is the difference in kill time between the two styles? Level 96 range and 91 mage
---
Yeah def get ur skills up for the biggest improvement. 2 mins sounds solid for your stats. Vengance first off u need 94 magic for and then you just venge  on blue phase when it shoots a range attack
---
The account had posted in a iPhone giveaway thread like a month ago, not to say it couldn’t have been compromised or a little throwaway use at the end of his time , but apparently the comment or thread has been deleted. Wish he at least gave an update.

---
It's supposed to be really difficult and take a lot of dev time and resources. Also, some dude alone pulled it off but the client was banned.
---
The loot is rolled when you search the chest, not when you open it, so yes you can kill the brother when it spawns on opening the chest and then get the reward when you search.
---
According to wiki droprate of 3rd age bow on mimic is 1/5244 so its basically like getting a dwh really early on, but not as rare as I thought it would be (1/488k from eite and 1/313k from master)
---
You were the chosen one! Now look where you have ended up!
---
This is actually not true, sorry bud.

guessing you've never done them

And you are an uneducated simpleton

It's amazing

No, have you?

Doing Bandos at the weekend with his boys obviously smh my head

Oh absolutely it was. Not denying that fact.

No way meds were 30k

Hard no
---
Sorry for your loss my friend💙
---
have you been to green dragons in the wildy, a dozen bots on every server.
---
Noone ever said that
---
Good guess, but I'm not convinced this is it. I just disabled that plugin, restarted the client, and the stars still float up. I'm in dire need of some Z's, so I'm going to leave this one up to Reddit to solve and see what it looks like in the A.M. Good luck, ladies and gents.
---
Bummer.
---
accuracy increases with gear though that he wouldn't be able to equip outside the minigame.
---
b-b-but rs3 bad
---
Hope a mod comes in with a smackdown if he has the prt and is just karma whoring haha
---
How did you get pmod?
---
It's cool, Jagex doesn't enforce them either
---
You’re right!! 
---
My bad, i always thought you had to get atleast 1kc before you could get a task.
---
I think you’ve missed a few news posts, not sure about QA but there’s a news post outlining features they no longer approve of and will ban over.
---
It all kicked off when osbuddy got upset nobody was paying to use them and decided to go nuclear by releasing plug ins that were essentially cheats.

Forgot about limewire. Were you even a kid in the 2000s if you didn't tank your family computer with a virus from downloading a 192kbps mp3 of mr brightside?

You spicin bro?

I had dialup till like 2007

i dont need sleep i need slayer xp

The clan I'm in is pretty good, "Twelvey12" it's pretty casual there

It's one of my fondest memories among side guild wars 1.

I never did much as a kid, played for many years and barely got over 100 originally... But it was fun and I didn't care about exp waste or anything.

 I remember I couldn't beat lost city so I was sitting in the safe spot, someone came by and killed the spirit and it said "quest complete".

Seems like he was lying about pmod

I have noticed this with water wheels at the motherlode mine, when smoothing is on the wheels turn one rotation and then rewind. I quess maybe it's because of repeated frames during the animation and the smoothing thinks it just repeats one motion.
---
Divines are pretty cheap as well even, I mean for a divine super att + strength, it’s between 5-10k (can’t remember), but that’s 20 mins at training at high CB stats for minimal cost for great efficiency in combat
---
Yep! The cc I'm in is really helpful, name is "Twelvey12"
---
Naw fish swordfish go kill lesser demons rinse and repeat

This would probably make me switch to old school of they brought out HD. I started playing in 2009 so the current old school game doesnt really give me nostalgia
---
Osrs hd now available for only 🦀🦀🦀🦀$111🦀🦀🦀🦀a month
---
I totally get what you mean. HD has some of my best memories.
---
.....

Why not just go play Skyrim or Oblivion or something then?
---
Zezima
---
Sike it's broken and probably just as bad as external plugins right?🦀🦀🦀

for easy clue scrolls
---
It’s not a birthday event its more of an anniversary event. The birthday event happens in late February/early March.
---
Those prices are correct. I made my first mil buying individual rune pieces and selling the full sets.
---
I always hated HD graphs, also this is oldschool runescape...
---
I like this idea.
---
It's similar to family pest or whatever it's called where you have a quest to pretty much buy the luxury of having all three gloves at once (goldsmith/chaos/cooking).
---
&gt;💙
---
 💙
---
Like I said then stay on standard. But why not improve and bring more players?
---
Reading the comments in the post this guy seems like a real dick, I don't feel bad for him.
---
ah ok.
---
Zuh-Zee-Muh
---
I’m not sure about hundreds or thousands...
---
Do the Bone voyage quest asap, it unlocks birdhouses which are pretty good passive money makers and hunter XP. Getting your crafting level up is pretty important for this as well.
---
Training your agility and getting the graceful outfit is extremely boring, but will make pretty much every non-combat activity(especially questing) in the game much less tedious, so it's worth getting 50-60 agility fairly early. 
---
Do the Fairy quest series as soon as you have the requirements, it will unlock fairy rings which are arguably the best quick travel system in the game.
---
Other than that, do quests and train slayer in your free time. Try to slowly get to base 70 stats, by the time you're done you'll have the requirements for nearly all quests
---
Surprised Vorkath's head is still pretty good looking after all those hits.
---
Lots of updates and events.. we just had Halloween event and Runefest has a lot of announcements
---
yeah and why do maples have those weird ass textures that aren't connected to anything
---
I agree with you, but if you want to bring the message across, say it in a more positive way. As someone who used to never really leave the house for years and now does it all the time (almost too much, lol), this sentence would have put me off already:
---
&gt; Don’t waste away in a basement while other kids are enjoying life
---
It's like an accusation and will make the reader all defensive. So if we want people to be the happiest they can be, lets only focus on the positive things. Your first kiss is a good example. Or funny stories. Slightly dangerous activities. Adrenaline. Absurdities you experienced in other countries. Beautiful places. This creates desire for greater things. Just felt like adding a little to the conversation, idk.
---
Roughly 60m, Bandos pet ~120 kc
---
Because it costs a lot more
---
Lower prices, according to them.
---
I watched Rendi's video and instantly knew it was going to be slapped down on.
---
Integrity wise, you're in the LMS instance. Therefore, interacting with objects outside that instance seems to harm integrity by default.
---
Think of vice versa, what if you could (hypothetically) win the LMS prize without being in the LMS instance?
---
Second, you make that harm worse by having access to max stats, inflicting damage *and* not gaining exp from it. It's quite reasonable to assume this is abuse, more than a harmless interaction between engine objects.
---
I sympathise, but I dont pity you. You're smart enough to know this wasnt going to end well.
---
In my opinion, a little self hype is great as long as your hype for others is even greater.
---
Oh damn
---
So jealous
---
Achool is actually canceled for me today
---
Agility is amazing, nothing like afking a few hours of laps after a stressful day to relax.

I fished my lobsters to go pking... i gave away 200 lobsters to a girl on runescape bcs i thought she was a girl... i gave away so much lel hahaha
---
It's for nostalgic reasons, Jagex doesn't want to ruin the full immersion experience, understandably so.
---
this had me crying from laughing so hard. thank you for your service
---
You get more if you buy gold directly from a seller instead of bonds.
---
Greed.
---
You can pretty safely clean your list entirely after reading this comment. By the time since you posted, they’re probably all banned.
---
Sounds like both could be true at once
---
Pretty sure this was added in a recent update so not a client feature but a vanilla feature.
---
And it doesn't seem consistent I frequently hit 6 hr log and only see it some times(could just miss it tho).
---
Requires 200m xp
---
A lot of people come back for the nostalgia. A lot of those people stay for the game itself. 
---
It just appeals to certain people and mindset. You have 23 skills that you want to max as super long term goals, but OSRS does a good job of breaking it down into a lot of gratifying smaller goals along the way. 
---
Of course you have aspects that other MMOs have, but OSRS has its own charm at the end of the day.
---
I don't know if he did

But promoting something that fucks with bottlers is hilarious

---
What you're not understanding is that it won't bring in as many players as it will push away. You're sample size of 6 friends who won't play because gRaPhIcS don't speak for the community as a whole
---
Stfu op
---
Rarely do I relate so deeply to an image.
---
They easily have the money to make it happen. They just won't spend it. Very little of the money Jagex makes is invested in the game.
---
This made me laugh harder than it should of
---
Only irons with 99 con, smithing and fletching. And they likely don’t need more bankspace at that point in their account.
---
How would this push people away if its toggable?
---
Because who gives a shit
---
Agreed. I play this game specifically because I can afk so hard while I work on other things. Not to say I don't talk to people sometimes, but if I don't reply don't get buttmad about it.
---
damn.
---
Maybe skill icons instead of rune icons?
---
It was recently abused with automated server calls input to be 70-80k from the first level. At human level this method was fine but now it isnt.
---
Incorrect, phase 3 verzik fires regular regular ranged or mage attacks at the player standing beneath them.
---
I'm all for this but you have to remember rs3 is bringing in bank from mtx. Size of the game, while it is important to us, doesn't really matter if they're making money off the games
---
I find it so weird people do this shit in class.
---
In my school/day OSRS would literally make you a pariah and a target.
---
Even when I moved in the right social circles, I still had to keep it under lock and key. 
---
Great design by the way! Not knocking it at all. Just weird how your school experience is so different from mine..
---
yeah do this and give it a drop you need for a new Masterclue-step so the irons have to grind for it
---
They explained it before. They would need to create more models for everything in game and basically double up. They'd rather spend time coming out with better content.
---
Lots of us play this for the pre eoc runescape not windows xp graphics
---
You would still be wasting time if you constantly go there instead of going for more efficient options
---
Also: just get maxed kek
---
I mean if they brought MTX I think this community would have a riot.
---
The nostalgia train has passed years ago. Look at this [graph](https://i.imgur.com/parrLyh.png). Nostalgia as a motivator to play OSRS was gone within a year after the game's release. 
---
The growth we have known through the years comes from content related updates. Ironically, you suggest an update that will bring in people because of nostalgia. 
---
I use animation smoother on runelite, so I will concede that I do not mind changes in how the game looks. However, RSHD would require a stupid amount of resources and we all know how the higher ups at Jagex think about that. IMO, the resources should go to creating content like quests, minigames, skills,... and not to a facelift.
---
It would take 2 years of no other updates.
---
I’ve been having a shitty night and this made me laugh for about 5 minutes. Thank you
---
Unplayable
---
Wrong. It uses your accuracy roll based on your highest attack stat. If your slash is +2 and range is +1, rangelevel will have 0 effect, but attack level will. Level, equipment and orators that affect your accuracy roll for that stat affect your accuracy for the cannonball.
---
I agree. Not only do we have to feed bankers, but they also complain about working long hours. Chests though? Sure, every one in a million might be a mimic and eat a kid or two, and people can take whatever they want from it even if it's not theirs... And there's no security.. and they might be stolen by goblins too...
---
But they are far superior because they have h
---
Which I agree. The game is classic and has and always will be so fun to me no matter the graphics. As resources are concerned as yes I would love to see content I would love to see some smoothing and crisper things in some of the game. Let's be real people shop with there eyes first so if the game looks good it can bring in heeps of people
---
Ah. Then, we are definitely not on the same page about this. 'Perception mismatch' is the root problem of our discussion, not 3rd party clients.
---
How many employees does the old school Runescape team consist of?
---
M-m-m-money sink! Jamflex!
---
Magic!
---
Menu swapping has always been a blurred line between OP and fine. Blame OSB for creating a bunch of BS OP menu swappers. Instead of leaving a gray line Jagex is trying to avoid any controversy in the future by creating clear rules now. Damn shame.
---
Everything about this post indicates you are in fact still 12.
---
What I'm saying is that watching it for the sake of the video games is not for me. But I forgot, this is reddit and I'm not entitled to my own opinion.
---
how would ironman mode fix the economy? either you dont participate in the economy or you create supply without creating demand by drop trading stuff to a main.
---
800 is the current bank space which is a pretty even number. They added 8 for a bank pin and 8 for the Authenticator which is a total of 816 though. Just 2 extra rows iirc
---
Usually do a birdhouse/farm run but won't actually 'play' play.
---
Like Jeffrey Epstein.
---
&gt;I doubt the bank items and placeholders are seperate items from the ones in your inventory. 
---
It is, it's why the RS3 dev team couldn't use the same approach OSRS did for the bank placeholders on RS3, because RS3 has too many items to just double the number of item IDs. To quote the devs:
---
&gt;The key answer there is in items. Old School placeholders are automatically generated objects, like notes. This means each item actually has multiples types, for example:
---
&gt;
---
    Item
---
    Item (Noted)
---
    Item (Placeholder)
---
&gt;Being the game from 2007, Old School has a significantly lower amount of items. We can't take this approach as it would push the item ID over the current limit. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/a89nax/bank_rework_state_of_play/
---
Hill Giants, flesh crawlers and green dragons are the ones that immediately come to mind.
---
So when it says "Modifies menu options for pickpocketing, such as swapping 'Pickpocket' and 'Talk-to'" followed by "Any features which act similarly to those described in the above list can also be considered unacceptable, and as we become aware of features we reserve the right to add features to the list in future" on the main site it doesn't affect the runelite thing?

Jagex needs to implement their machine learning system in OSRS. they claim it can track specific player's playstyles across any account/IP.
---
Oh Konar says it, interesting
---
Haha I'm glad I did such a great job conveying game knowledge to the point that you think jagex has given us all the info. They are keeping much of the twisted league secret, and have only hinted... "relics and tiers will toss out all the Zeah only meta's". Essentially they said my prep will be futile, but idk... I think I have a lot of good info that people need to know prior to twisted league :p
---
Great memories.
---
Respect for the effort haha
---
I think this is fairly off-set by new items and weapons that speed up tasks significantly. Take for example metal dragons which used to take 3 bans and now take 5. While there are more metal dragons, dragon hunter gear and their location in the catacombs speeds up the task so much that they aren't worth blocking anymore.
---
The most recent Q+A stated that Nightmare will have more complex mechanics than previous (in particular, older) bosses.
---
I think the main issue with raids 3 is that we're at a point where Jagex isn't sure what the rewards can be without big powercreep. Most niches have been filled out for tier 75 and a lot of the playerbase (enough to shut down a poll) won't accept new, more powerful gear being introduced. I have no problem with the devs taking their time to collect player input and try to find a median between dead-on-release rewards and overpowered rewards.

Knowing that it'll be Zeah only is still a huge thing to know.
---
Hey man, comments like this are why people think you’re a loser.
---
Just as a RuneLite dev stated in a previous post, when the RL client pulls from the servers for GPU rendering it reads the code from the magic trees that Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
Oh our computer was incredibly fucked with viruses and whatnot lol and I’m pretty sure in 2004 I still had dial up. Still loved playing RS that way!
---
Base 90s would be the logical next step...
---
I'm saying Jagex have the money to do it, if they wanted to.
---
The osbuddy GE actively traded prices have all been 0 recently too. Everyone just quit buying and selling things too!
---
Stacked clue. This is sick lol
---
It's pretty hard to see references of it in OSRS, which is probably why many people don't know about it. It seems this idea was expanded upon in Runescape later on after 2007, and it is explained and mentioned more often in RS3 and even in the days of Runescape before EoC.
---
As far as I know, there is little mention of Zanaris being a moon in OSRS except for a small line from Konar saying specifically that Zanaris is the moon of Gielinor. I will add that, in my opinion, this might be why the Lunar Staff is able to be used with the fairy rings. But, this might just be coincidence and actually be the case because the staff is made by the player out of a Dramen Staff.

If you keep this up you're gonna have to kill a couple thousand Zuks by the end of it.

Jeffery Epstein was killed by [Redacted]
---
I would like to say that I have been sad for a very long time and am going to commit suicide. This has nothing to do with my previous comments about [Redacted]. /s
---
Get 70 prayer and work towards unlocking barrows gloves and piety from there I would focus on some Slayer to get your combat stats up and upgrade your gear with the profits. This will allow you to start bossing for better gp (best to find a friendly clan at this point).
---
It’s a magic tree dude
---
Ah yes, anecdotal evidence.
---
I actually found some real shit over the years. No idea if it was safe, but I actually was able to hack in coins and even some items if done safely. Once I found one that gave me literally every item, including the beta hat that was only available on the very first day and would get you banned if seen with it by then.
---
Flash games are easy to fuck with, Club Penguin was no exception.
---
It's nice, that you write this stuff but...
---
1) Editing isn't such important stuff in OSRS edits, important is message what you want to give to your viewers. Obviously its not like filming and uploading you need spent your hours to edit that stuff, but adding these effects and stuff like that thats everyone style
---
2) That`s called clickbait titles, i agreed sometimes its good stuff but doesn't need too often.
---
3) About giveaways, there's sketchy shit nowadays about fake subs same shit about titles giveaways are good to celebrate like 1k / 2k subs to giving some mils.
---
Want a bond for what you've learned today?
---
How bout us both ;)
---
Ahh yes, just what I expected to see when visiting the OSRS reddit. Someone with an actual brain getting downvoted into oblivion.
---
Also way to let things get out of hand, OSRS team. Maybe you should've stuck with your ToS from the start and disallowed third-party clients 5 years ago.
---
Didnt mean to include driving
---
Are you wooshing right now?
---
You just blew in from highschool or smth
---
Hopefully next league isn't iron man nor area locked.

I surely hope that isn't the case and that he's the friend the original post was talking about otherwise it's seriously fucked up to post
---
Lmao you seem poor
---
Maybe a little bit, unfortunately i did not have BiS gear at home in my wardrobe.
---
I already checked both, they were clean. I'm mostly confused as to how someone figured out the email I used for the account in the first place.
---
Cute!
---
I agree, although I'm personally extra keen because of it now, for reasons.
---
Fucking weirdo
---
What? do people actually think people instantly die at the 2 month mark lmao
---
What's the difference?
---
Sounds like a job for sirpugger ,
---
I think we’re on to something
---
Lmao I couldn’t care less if some nobody on reddit thinks I’m a loser. Get a grip, this is the internet.
---
Probably not. No 3rd party client is 100% safe, but thousands of people also use RuneLite. So you're probably fine.
---
Ban4accountShare
---
That's not really accurate though, I mean I see all my friends complain about not having pvm pets but they've got like 50 kills at half the bosses because they don't grind it properly
---
I'm 214mil total exp zero skilling pets whatsoever, but 49mil of that exp gone on pvm, therefore I have had 10 pets
---
Out of the skilling pets, the only one I've fairly grinded for is the tangleroot, currently 17m exp iirc and did Apple trees etc post 99 so it would equivilate to 30mil exp or so if I kept doing proper farm runs, but no need coz it's a set rate, still no pet though
---
Hot stuff, girl on the right is ok too
---
 Be-boop. Nice!
---
No you are lmao
---
What should I make for 85-90 herb?
---
My hoarding ass with 3 parts of every god rune armour set would like to have a word with you
---
Bro... i would fucking shit myself
---
There will always be cheating clients, even if RuneLite was banned - it wold just punish legitimate players.
---
💙
---
no its definitely the boss timers
---
yea but what if people buy 100 extra bank slots? Thats 10m a person.
---
Its humour dude. I did this when I was like 12 a couple times. I barely manage to get 6 hours a week in anymore.
---
Unlucky, dont worry you will get the warrior ring soon.
---
Because ice Giants are better than moss Giants are better than Hill Giants. Having a progression is good for the game, even in f2p. It's not like they're comparable in gp/hr to members content

Nope, you’re wrong. One Skeleton, One Giant Crypt Spider, and One Crypt Spider is 86.8% and the highest you can achieve. I only kill 2 Skeleton and 1 Bloodworm when my path doesn’t take me thru the spider room. Best of luck on drops!

HOLY FUCK I LOVED THAT GAME
---
I mean we're just playing our game and you're wasting time half assedly trolling our sub...
---
They're removing features that are perfectly fair to remove. Oh waah you have to pay attention at bosses. What a crime.
---
It's from an old addage: "shitposting on /b/ is like pissing in an ocean of piss"
---
It is. That's how the ban message is shown. Rwt minor
---
Jagex can actually detect menu swapping if they cared to enforce it. They can tell what button you clicked and how far your cursor moved to select something.
---
yikes
---
i bought 4 bed 2 bath for 180 cad, no idea how many square meters

---
we had 29,000 individual votes, if you believe about the 3rd party client nerfs, why didnt they just ban them right off the bat? when i went to RF the few people who i cant name said they are seriously worried about the player base if they banned them.(these same jmods also said they used RL fully themselves)
---
people would be much happier if jagex hired someone full-time for an official client like RL

---
Indeed. However if they ever went for this approach, it's not given that they have to make such a fire/ice combo boss f2p, as imo some new and interesting boss mechanics should take priority over trying to "shoehorn" something into f2p. It's a discussion if the standard and easy-to-implement "kill ice giants, get a key, kill ice giant boss" format which we have gotten twice already, should prioritize over some more advanced and unique fight involving the elements of ice &amp; fire.
---
Also took a brief look at what could drop the fire key half in f2p, and unfortunately there's not many alternatives as almost all of them are p2p. You have lesser/greater demons, but dunno if that is too farfetched. Also no fire giants are currently in f2p accessible areas if they should ever be f2p.

CPU = central processing unit. (Processor)
---
GPU = graphics processing unit. (Graphics Card)
---
 The difference between CPU and GPU processors is the way each one handles different tasks. A CPU performs different calculations to process tasks while a GPU has the ability to focus all computing abilities on a specific task. GPU rendering is about 50 to 100 times faster than CPU rendering.   Hope this explains it abit.
---
Selling stuff on FB marketplace? Just use the GE
---
Nope, the bank is on the way to the altar already
---
osrs gear in rs3 graphics
---
To put it in the simplest terms, GPU stands for graphics processing unit, and it renders graphics a lot better than your CPU. 
---
If you have a GPU in your PC, it will do a better job at rendering the game at a higher framerate, and will let your CPU focus on other things instead of trying to do both.
---
Jagex should release metallic giants to go with the dragons lelel.
---
Theres a few holes in this. Bitcoin isnt a one time drop like Christmas crackers. It's being consistently mined to the point where there is none left. Once there is none left to mine it will be pretty much useless as a currency. Especially due to it having no physical value
---
No because you teleport to ourania and bank at Eniola.
---
Oh fair enough, thanks for clearing it up
---
I can see you’re either emotionally unstable or having a bad day because nothing you said was good advice, helpful, or intelligent in any way. Slayer is one of the best money makers in the game and my favorite skill to train. It’s a great way to make cash, Hell I made over 2.2mil on my last kraken task alone. Quit trying to act like an elitist tough guy on the internet. “I don’t know anyone who has gotten banned incorrectly so it doesn’t happen.” Yeah that’s incredibly smart logic, in fact I don’t know anyone’s school who has been shot up so it doesn’t happen. I’ve never been raped either so that obviously doesn’t happen. Somebody get this guy a juice box
---
Haven't been following for a few weeks, did Jagex move forward with banning 3rd party clients recently?
---
Support.
---
How isn’t it comparable? F2P moneymakers are Generally garbage so adding any boss with a good drop table and an expensive unique is adding their version of a members boss with high profit per hour. 
---
They’ve already gotten two giant bosses, both with good drops and an expensive unique. Adding more is just throwing GP at them at this point. Other people keep saying you want them to have F2P version of vorkath now with no requirements so they can farm bonds for free and that’ll somehow inspire them to get members? That sounds stupid. 
---
Members should receive the final two giant bosses. It would be pretty stupid to have four elemental giant bosses, all with keys, all weak as fuck, easy to do and dead content for members.
---
Ok that sounds really promising, what is the download website?

He's in a ton of different locations, but the easiest one is in Lumbridge castle, inside the castle walls south of the main eastern entrance. He has a shop with all of the mentioned items at a cost, and you can buy them whenever(no death mechanic), but he doesn't let you buy duplicates of things you can't get dupes of, like diary gear, ectophial, etc.
---
I am mobile only, I’ve done about 50 barrows chests mobile and it isn’t bad.

I don’t prayer flick (because I haven’t figure out how yet) but you can long press the doors to the chest room and figure out the path quite easily.
---
homie go get yourself one of those electric shave kits from walmart, they’re like 40 bucks and has everything you need to not be a neckbeard haha
---
What’s worthy of a ban still isn’t entirely clear despite Jagex giving two posts trying to explain it.  Regardless, they can’t detect you using it.

Bit more than other general stores... it’s high alch price no?

if yours has some weird green shit on the end I don't think anyone wants to see it

What do you mean force third-party clients on people?  I can't imagine the official client will ever cease unless the game itself does.

Wholesome post of the year. The feels are real rn.

Thanks! I feel bad because thats my friends 3rd duo where his partner got the pet haha.

Don’t think you can delete your comments you cringy man baby. You will never be a pmod so I don’t know why you were noting what to do. Clearly from your comments you are one of the biggest problems with the game today, toxicity and immaturity. I’ve read through your other comments and from what I’ve seen you’ve already committed fraud with your bank. Quit being such a fucking twat in general offline and online.
---
Have you tried sire?
---
So yes the attack bonus matters to what type of melee damage you do ie. You have to use the crush style to benefit from the crush bonus and will be rolled against the monster's crush defence. Additionally the attack type (agressive ,controlled, accurate) also give invisible bonus agressive +3 strength bonus, accurate +3 attack bonus ,defensive +3 def and controlled is +1 to each.

Took me 17k also for my first. keep grinding

actually i'm just amused by ur intellect seeming to quite match Lalli's
---
I don't find the add-ons convoluted.  They can be, but even installing RuneLite and never changing the settings will just give you things like color-coding where to go on rooftop courses that aren't usually obvious.
---
You do you, of course.  Nothing wrong with liking the jank either.
---
The main appeal of currency as a theory afaik is that its anchored by some entity to represent a theoretical share of resources.
---
Bitcoin has no such backing, as it lacks physical assets to tie it to.
---
The world used to use precious metals but it didnt work with inflation, now we use debt (i like to look at it optimistically as stock)but it still has a representation.
---
Is that what you are saying?

If you're consistently teleporting with 0 prayer and extra food, bring less food and more prayer potions :P

Highly recommend the looting bag method though. Without spectral you should be able to go way past the ~21 kills/trip you need to profit teleports (assuming you run to boss with looting bag, then gear up and teleport). If you *do* get a spectral + scythe or tbow, you can go past the ~42 kills/trip you need to also teleport w/ looting bag.
---
what if 😳😳😳😳

I just use third party clients so the game will look playable

This is a video game.

It's worth it just for the gpu plugin and turn everything else off. You'll see frames in the osrs animation you've never seen before.
---
"Cares a lot about his content"
---
Meanwhile the actual game footage is flickering so much its painful to watch.
---
Its like the early days of OSRS where you'd stretch the game to full screen with OSB and make your eyes bleed.
---
You’re using gmails inbuilt catch all
---
Let’s use test@gmail.com as an example for this.
---
So when you use test@gmail.com 
---
You sign up for an account using test+runescape@gmail.com 
---
If anyone emails either test@gmail.com or test+runescape.com both emails will go to google and they’ll send it to the same inbox.
---
The perk of this is it’s a different email address in the eyes of jagex so you’ll use test+runescape@gmail.com to log in with your new account.
---
You could do this again and have test+runescapetwo@gmail.com to create another account.
---
All emails will still go to test@gmail.com.
---
It’s just removing the step of having to create a new email address for each account, you can manage them all from the same gmail account but jagex will think it’s separate email accounts.
---
Ps I actually recommend doing this for every site ever as it could improve your online security.
---
Plus if a company sells your information you’ll be able to tell what company sold it, if you get junk mail coming into test+Walmart@gmail.com you’ll know Walmart sold your info.
---

I know plenty about muscle memory, being able to move a mouse and change to perform are all about you as a person.  You would have learned that in your life time if you did anything other than sit at your PC. Sports/video games/education/social everything is muscle or brain memory and being able to change those BAD patterns that YOU have make you a better person/athlete/gamer/ect
---
  I've 100% pk'd more than you in my lifetime of playing osrs, about all I do anymore is highrisk tri/hybrid fights (100m+ fights) People cheating in these fights by reordering prayers are trash pkers and always will be.  Learn how to play the game as intended and not something that makes it easier for you and gives you an ADVANTAGE.

that works though look /********
---
OSRS has been out. Runescape mobile is in early access on android
---
dont need an alt, once theyre agro on you they dont leave they keep coming
---
This is how people get caught. 
---
Any time you enter the Inferno, Jagex is taking a snapshot of your IP. 
---
Here’s how people aren’t getting caught: 
---
They have the person complete the Inferno using Team Viewer. Team Viewer allows the other person to remote access into your computer and control it. Doing this means that it’s still the original IP and not the cape sellers IP. People can still be caught this way. 
---
1.) Player uses RS gold to buy the cape. A large one way transaction occurs (let’s say 500m), and suddenly, the account has an Inferno completion.
---
2.) The player suddenly changes their password shortly after an Inferno completion, especially if they haven’t changed their password in month(s) or year(s).
---
3.) The player has zero inferno attempts under their belt, and suddenly they complete it out of the blue, first try. Not saying that one attempt capes aren’t possible, but it’s highly suspicious, especially if you don’t have a lot of Jad or bossing attempts under your belt. 
---
4.) The player openly brags about cheating the cape and it gets passed onto Jagex. 
---
These are the situation where players are being caught and having capes revoked. It’s only drops in the bucket though. There are tons of players doing it the safest way possible. Which is to purchase it via a 3rd party payment method, to at least attempt the Infero a few times or fake a few attempts by suiciding in, to use team viewer, and to not change their password for at least 3 weeks after the completion. 
---
So the issue is much deeper than IP tracking. Machine learning is pretty much the only way to stop this. Any attempts to stop Team Viewer would be Jagex overstepping their bounds, as Team Viewer has a lot of legitimate uses, and also legitimate uses outside of Runescape. So Jagex can’t punish players for having the app installed, etc.

Not trying to be an ass but what boss is high end that isn't raids?
---
It's just Runescape 3 on mobile.
---
Fuck I forgot you can buy the grip from there. I don't really play as much as I used to and am not a good pker, but sometimes go out with some friends and fail horribly while laughing. Maybe I can get some of the cash back from grips.
---
Lol all your comments keep getting deleted by either you or someone else, so I have to reply to this one.
---
You can think what you want, I work here at the city with community and economic development, I can assure you that any house you can buy for that price either is a shit hole or is in a shitty neighborhood
---
Apparently he wasnt even a pmod according to a mod ash post
---
It's not new - it's RS3. Hopefully it succeeds to delay the inevitable cashcow milking of OsRS.
---
Right? The Runelite client looks so much better. Plus stretched fixed mode
---
i havent seen the rs3 client so i cant really say much about it,
---
just i wouldnt mind paying for a client, specially when its runelite/osbuddy and bunch of others that led to jagex even have to put resources into it
---
no.
---
backtrack, try again, reread etc.
---
it's extremely unlikely for you - doing a quest normally, especially a very old quest- to encounter a bug that makes the quest in-completable. 
---
you likely skipped over something/already completed something/misread something.
---
Zulrah/Vorkath. All the other bosses (according to the geniuses I’ve encountered on here) are inferior and not worth doing. Again, not my words.
---
Ok move on
---
This pleases the N U T
---
hey you're allowed your opinion my dude but you're just stupid as it seems! the reason is because its a pking build, I've limited my self to low attack defence and prayer to keep my combat level as low as possible so i can fight lower levels too. and the colour helmets are just a fun challenge because i also enjoy pvm. but hey you're to stupid to see that without being told i guess
---
I'll put in my credit card number too!
---
Hunter2
---
Ummmm no i meant how organic it feels.
---
Everything you have to figure out yourself sort of thing. No plugins just the game. Not dissing any 3rd party program i use Runelite because it has good stuff like Menu Entry Swapper etc.
---
First of all you’re a monkey you cant see me on the court or in RuneScape.  Second of all if you’ve been using eagle eye and mystic might long before rigour or augury was added and have done the same motion countless times how are you going to sit here and call it cheating to give yourself an advantage when technically speaking rigour and augury are closer to your spec bar and  switches. It’s not about giving myself an advantage as if I put all my prayers vertical or all lined up next to each other or some shit it’s about my preference.  Third hybridding or high risk hybridding or whatever you want to call it is autistic and I’m laughing that you even bring up hybridding as if it’s anything more than getting a good barrage and ags gmauling full hp.
---
Thanks man appreciate it lol
---
I would say all but the demi bosses. GWD Vork I would consider high end.
---
Okay he’s never done it before we can’t compare Apples to oranges here. His kills per trip can go up but learning he will start off slow around 3-5 a trip. Simple.
---
No, I prefer the grind.
---
Lol number 1 you’re wrong number 2 that’s not what you said at the beginning of this.
---
If I’m shadowbanned that’s fucked.
---
the thing is he didnt see that i too am a variant of a pure, my account is restricted to keep my level low
---
This is everyone after 60 to 70 grind

"07 Rebellion" sounds perfect for you

The left click action showing up near the cursor instead of in the corner of the screen is pretty nice though.

Yeah mate they did a great job!! https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8sige6/there_was_a_rsps_back_in_2015_which_had_osrs_in/e10qepz/
---
There are other gold sinks in the game though. Ever heard of construction? No? Do some research
---
Can't trust anyone who gets "your" and "you're" confused
---
Spwn tile markers were mentioned, idk if that's what he was using or not
---
of course
---
Windows keyboard and mouse center might be able to help you? But otherwise idk man, it kinda just sounds like you've got a hardware issue (broken fn key) and need to have it replaced.
---
Could you use V's shield to get the faceguard?
---
If you’re gonna do raids, I’d suggest DWH and rigour. And use the rest of the money on zenyte jewelry.
---
What pvm have you been doing? Friend is level 104 and idk what to suggest him (i do Cox/other pvm but don't know what's suitable in his cb bracket besides barrows/gwd)
---
Congrats Brent! - Dr Rone

You can boost from 93 herblore with a botanical pie too (that's what I do).

If you can dream it, do it

If you literally can't play without third party, do you really like the game?
---
You arent supposed to hunt them
---
crystal keys iirc
---
Never used Inspect Element?
---
I have those socks too! Good choice! They look great :)
---
Says you
---
well i don’t know, the image is different too
---
I mean okay I get it, but can someone give me an example? Every site has asked me for those
---
Vanilla wow will reach nowhere near the lifespan of osrs.
---
I don't think anyone wants vanilla osrs lol, even removing 3pc was impossible for jamflex
---
Oh hey I got it on my second kill too! Had him as a task for boss Slayer.
---
Yeah! Very cute outfit op! Have fun
---
I only play mobile, so none of this is my problem.
---
Yeah i don’t really afk anything for this reason. I’m too poor boi to miss a drop.
---
Hi Jacob
---
It's like a comb-over. Otherwise there's a little magic tree bald spot.
---
UIM don't
---
Photoshop does that part I guess
---
The negative lamp genie is killin me lol why does it look like that hahahaha
---
Yeah but unfortunately it’d be practically impossible to complete clue scrolls with any sort of efficiency since completing one generally requires equipping something tradable. Rune scimmy might be feasible.
---
&gt;12-15k/hour max on release- it is now around 90k/hour
---
Lol what? Maybe at like 95+ when you have thousands of points to throw around and can literally skip until you hit a barrage task every time, and have full max mage gear and an alt that can tag every mob. 
---
Also, slayer is the biggest EHP above even rc and agility, by a pretty decent margin. It's slow as fuck. So what's so bad about it taking someone like 430hrs instead of 450? Still going to be exactly the same, the only downside is sweaty's "MuH aChIevEMeNt!"
---
You need more than one person to form a gang.
---
Lmao how bitter can you be about someone else’s existence. Go crawl into the hole from which you came, scum.
---
You always make shit up for attention?
---
I hope what has made you so toxic looks up for ya and you can stop being such a negative person
---
Doesnt mean the intention you're abusing the bug, if you abuse bugs to clear pvm challenges you should get penalised for it, this was OBVIOUSLY not an intended game mechanic
---
Ah yes the good epstein didn't kill himself joke 100 times in one thread.
---
I like the idea, but there's no hover options for other players when seeing your pet and it might be too crowded to add.
---
As someone 143 raids dry the amount of lust and envy is palpable.
---
I’m gonna go ahead and prescribe you Xanax.
---
you guys are so fucking dumb, they aren't coming after your "left click bankers" menu swapping. Anything on runelite (and maybe osb, idk I don't use that ex-botting client) is permitted by Jagex, and you'll probably notice barely anything has changed.
---
Hahahahahahaha, mad + sweaty + fat + peepee dagger
---
I guess Ironmen can't do quests
---
It literally says i need Java SE 6 to run it xD
---
Personal opinion but I dont think oldschool is going into a right direction either. We're entering the area of powercreep because people want new bosses which means better gear/drops. plus lets not forget the ironman  mode issues and pvp.
---
Yeah the thing that’s making me toxic keeps replying to me. Once he leaves I’ll be fine.
---
Me and my friends were saying about a mini game which in essence allowed you to “bind” items to your account (essentially like Dungeoneering) which you could have a “bind chest” in your house of armour/weapons which become unreadable and give a slight improvement in accuracy once binded. Only issue we found would be the pvp/death implications to which we said if pvm death you can speak an NPC and pay 10% of the market value for your gear, and make them 0 stats in all pvp encounters. But I think that would be a solid idea, it would also help with the staking issue/gambling issue, as addicts who have binded items couldn’t unbind them to stake
---
Pioneers used to ride these things for miles
---
Are you insane?! That place scares me. I wont even look at it let alone put a body part there!
---
I love OPs mom
---
With Sire the head droprate is just over 1/1000, and I can definitely kill 6 demons faster than I can kill Sire once.
---
They say it's for "quality of life" but really it's because they can't be fucked to put real effort into playing
---
Because the spinner landed on 2 when they made the quest.
---
Very nice come back I’m sure it took you forever to come up with that lol...rate 1/10 just like your mom
---
You are credit card
---
I knew it was a good choice to choose electrical engineering
---
pretty sure they'd have to add combat stats (attack, strength, defence, mage, ranged, hp) to make each combat level specific to the level which you got it lol
---
It means tele immediately
---
GG I don’t pvm much but for 99 slay my best Rng was at abbys lol got 23 whips and 2 heads in 6600 kc 😶
---
Holy shit you really spent 10 minutes of your life writing this.
---
Jagex specifically banned a handful of plugins that they consider bad for the game. Runelite immediately removed them, not sure what other clients are doing. If you were already using Runelite the impact is pretty trivial.
---
Cute meme, did you buy it at the GE?
---
nice
---
 They would get to control what is and isn't on the client, what they deem is or isn't too OP.. Also security reasons... Also then they keep the community happy.
---
 Its looking like the alternative is getting rid of all third party clients soon because of a few bad cheating ones out there, which obviously would anger alot of people who can't seem to play rs without it. 
---
so by buying it it solves all the problems they are worried about and all the problems the community is worried about aswell. 
---
And of course it would help jagex profit in the long run because better client = more people playing = more money...
---
Eh, I use RuneLite for the OoL. If they ban it, I'll go back to vanilla, whatever. A few features just make it more comfortable to play as a disabled player, like the key rebinds and the hitbox highlights. My hands jiggle a lot and hurt if I hold them in certain positions for too long. Keybinds let me bind more actions to my 18 button mouse for example, and the hitbox highlights mean I can mitigate some of the shakes as I have a better idea of where to aim. It'd be a shame if I couldn't use it.
---
QoL for disabled players is something I would have thought jagex hold in high regard since they so avidly support special effect. I can only hope I'm not proven wrong.
---
I always so my blue dragons ;)  although I kill the undead large one
---
you can find java se 6 if you search for it, it's archived.
---
as i said though, that's not the problem with your client, despite what that popup says
---
It's magic
---
Nice try
---
I get it since the bug doesn’t hurt anyone.  If someone wants to spend mils and 100 hours into getting an untradeable cosmetic, why should Jagex punish it?  It’s their responsibility, not ours to keep the game bug free and they should only punish us for their fuckups if we’re abusing them maliciously.
---
You can still screenshot on an old laptop lol
---
I need to know who's buying all of this beer
---
People too busy grinding at home
---
And? Half the work is already done. If they follow like osrs did and have community voting you easily get to wotlk without any massive changes. You give em the wotlk leveling and loot system, and boom. You have 4 years of content just ready to be pushed out with very minimal effort. Use that 4 years to come up with ideas for future expansions... Emerald dream?
---
idk why, anything that would make more sense?
---
Yeah its being put on by jagex, on specific server worlds for 2 months, starting Nov 14
---
Bro what, obviously you wear a fire cape during your first fight caves completion.
---
exactly, look at skillcape, statistically they are basically obby capes because if they had BiS stats then everyone would bot to 99.
---
good point
---

Hahahaha oh my god dude you put this shameless ass photo on the internet and all you can come back with is “your mom”

No its not possible.

Yah what the fuck. They are like the only npcs with names that arent involved in any quests directly.
---
Thats obviosly why he's getting a warning
---
Allright thank you. And do you know for sure if I am able to revert back my previous name using this method? When I look up my previous name it says already taken :(

Imagine not even knowing those player counts are not both combined

20k on rs3
---
Well at least now you know you’re colorblind.
---
And they still advertise rs3 as the main game with not 90 but 20k players on 😆
---
rs3 only have 20k players. what you see on the homepage is the osrs players numbers + rs3
---
OP should edit this guy in in the picture
---
ROFL, I’m crying 😂😂😂
---
when i was 10 i traded my mithril armor for black armor because i thought it looked cooler
---
I finished ugh it sucked lmao
---
Like OP said, it would be neat to have a Bounty points system or something like trading in quest points for rewards.  Also a leaderboard would be epic so someone can flex how many times they've completed Ratcatchers.
---
no q p btw

---
I mean, there are a lot of NPCs in Slepe and Zeah that give lore but these guys just do *nothing*
---
 
---
Can’t talk to ‘em, they don’t have any remarkable drops, and they have some wacky names
---
You got a link or anything? Just curious what got the hammer.
---
not really because in melee most of the attack bonus comes from the weapon, where in ranged a ton of it comes from stuff like armour. ranged also ends up with more total accuracy.
---
as far as i know the only difference between attack styles is the opponent's defense, which is their defense level plus their defense against that style.
---
so if an opponent had high defense level but low defense against particular styles, you can use any style. if the target has low defense level, but high defense against ranged, use melee, or high defense level and high defense against ranged, use melee.
---
originally ranged strength only came from ammunition and was basically at a premium, but now with items like the slayer helm (i) and the anguish you can buff that a lot too.
---
Saw this in Taran’s discord. Gratz!
---
Offspring?😂😭...you are high on shrooms and clearly not cultured please don’t offend me like that
---
why dont you just go to nmz lol
---
Runelite, smooth animations, anti aliasing, gpu. Someone will add any im missing im sure lol
---
I definitely wasn't being specific enough—I mean for things like left-click banking, left-click dropping, big spellbook icons, or prayer warnings plugin
---
Meh, I'd rather own Microsoft.
---
Nope
---
Finally someone who gets it. xD

---
The reason it's capped per day is to prevent boss grinding being replaced by this slayer system. As long as it doesn't grant some nutty experience per hour efficiency, it won't be considered a daily like farm runs, battlestaves, kingdom and herb boxes are. This would be a segwey into introducing bossing to newer players, who will over time be able to take on tougher bosses through the task list and then  branch out to other bossing content. Currently the gap between newer players and veterans is quite large, as far as skill in PvM is concerned.
---
I got in between both games I go thru my gaming phases where I like to concentrate on just 1 game and move on to another one only to come back to the previous game later lol
---
That's a smart way to tackle this. I really want higher construction but find it so boring lol. I also want to grind vork without using 330 POH so I guess I'll have to grind con until I get there haha
---
This message never fails to make me smile
---
Which anti aliasing do you pick? I feel like i remember seeing the setting and it having a couple different options
---
I'm sorry mama
---
Only a certain amount per day I think
---
If this is true, I feel like my original statement is even more validated. 
---
How many companies can say they were on the edge of collapse and saved themselves?
---
I'm sure there's a joke here that I'm missing but shouldn't that atleast say iron, since it references a 50% success rate?
---
Yeah thieving was rough, but ardy knights!  After the 80s the spot NE is generally just clicking the same spot + F key to open and close inventory, with the bag in the same spot without moving the mouse.  really helps with HP cape and regen bracelet to avoid needing a lot of food.  fewer people too so less ardy knights disappearing.
---
early accessing stuff is not ideal either tbh
---
I'm not a fan of non-PvP content being added into wilderness but I am a sucker for clues.
---
I would vote for wilderness clues if it is a separate type of clue and if other clue scrolls have the wilderness steps removed.
---
Yes they are.
---
Imagine complaining about a training method that is intended to be high risk high reward

[Bandit Duty Free, owned by Noterazzo and located in Wilderness level 23, is a general store that is one of three to buy items at their High Level Alchemy cost as opposed to the normal](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bandit_Duty_Free)
---
Omg
---
Its inconvenient to have to go to a boss, its literally not difficult to run to a boss. So add all bosses to our POH. Perhaps we can spawn bosses wherever we want by just opening up an interface. Its not hard. Its not good enough to justify the inconvenience.
---
For me that was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I had been increasingly losing faith in the OSRS team after things like the unpolled Arceuus library nerf that deleted millions of banked runecrafting experience from some players. That and stuff like it becoming public that their bot detection randomly bans legitimate players, along with no real customer support, makes it feel like it'd be a mistake to continue playing. That's if we're lucky enough for corporate not to shove mtx or 'partnerships' down everyone's throats too, which it seems like they'll try if they ever think they can get away with it.
---
Because I have no time to react. I'm frozen before i even see them because they log in under me. I'm ok with dying, I'm ok with it being a risky activity. But there's no counterplay,  I don't have the skills to kill them, so I try to run instead, but there's nothing I can do since I'm frozen before I even know I'm there. Why is there not a grace period so I can actually realize someone else just logged in?
---
a lot of people want vanilla OSRS lol
---
to be honestl, dont deposit logs, their essentially worthless and ull lose mad xp, if youre trying to level purely wc, just drop logs. If u wanna make money, drop logs, cause in the long run, the amount u make off teaks with banking will be 100x less than that time u would have in future cutting magic trees.
---
If it wasn't for people killing you then you wouldn't be able to reap the rewards of an altar that gives half your bones back at gilded XP rates, stop whining.
---
If I am understanding your question correctly and you are wanting to bank the teak logs, the best thing to do is plant your own on fossil island. Of course, this would mean you would need the farming level and access to fossil island.
---
Youre right. Grand Exchange and F2P are the only reasons we saw an increase in player count, 10 other updates didnt do anything notable to it. Also, this only shows contemporary player count, not long term effects of adding an update.
---
Because it's the fucking wilderness and it's not catered to massive pussies.
---
Brhu
---
??? Prayer is used at all levels except for shit pures. Pking is only fun on a maxed main risking 100m+. Ive done pvp in this game since 2001 I've been involved in boring ass low level, pure, zerk, void pking... none of that is fun. Literally none of that changes the fact that moving prayer around to make it easier for you isn't an advantage and is cheating.
---
slayer item store, same place you buy enchanted gems, rock hammer, etc.
---
Alrighty thanks.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEpost (this has been posted on this subreddit like 40 times)
---
and we already know he was wrong.
---
Why didn’t you go for bones 2 peaches and buy the other items?
---
No for 1.5m?
---
Some people say that but don't realize stuff like data orbs won't be in the game and likely haven't even tried playing on the default client with features like minimap missing or being able to click the shoe orb to toggle run.
---
Though there are a few who would like that.
---
you can cannon from a safespot in the chasm of fire
---
otherwise you could block yeah, pretty afk task but it's not good if you're actively playing
---
agility pyramid, ham storeroom thieving, fletching bows and selling, wildy steel platebodies, thieving in general
---
Memes don't destroy discussion. There is a lack of good discussion and the void gets filled by memes.
---
That's not a reason and is an unbelievably illogical argument
---
also you posted the question like 5 times, may wanna delete the dupes
---
No it doesnt. Everyone that wants vanilla OSRS has played through all eras of the game and realizes which era was the superior one.
---
when i played the game back when i was 10 i always wore steel armor, and my friend was lole "bro you have 30 defence why dont you wear adamant" but i was deadset on thinking steel was stronger cuz i knew steel was strong but i didnt know wtf adamant was
---
Go check the code then.
---
Have you ever considered that some people have and they found nothing to be worried about so they never said anything? 
---
Regardless, who even uses OSB and who even cares? If OSB wanted to sacrifice their integrity and fuck over who knows how many customers paying $3 a month for OSB pro, just so they can get a little yellow pixels aligned in the shape of coins on a 15 year old game then by all means? But I don’t think that “yellow pixels” pays the WiFi bill. 
---
30K - 50K people used OSB at one point. Even if a tiny tiny amount of that, say just 10% of people had OSB pro, that’s still a truckload of cash for basically doing nothing but running a business based off someone else’s property lol. 
---
People need to stop being unreasonable conspiracy theorists.
---
Except I'm not upset about being killed, rather the manner in which it happens
---
The whole argument is since I’m used to pure pking with mystic might and eagle eye that I want to swap them with rigour and augury for main pking are you actually slow in the brain? Pking is only fun on a maxed main? You’re an actual monkey if you think main Nh is fun it’s literally a grandmas pace you will never ever kill me on a maxed main if I want to brew to 120 it’s an rng simulator. I realize now that you’re just shit at the game and have no right to speak on what you’re clueless about but if you think you got big balls you can catch me in the wildies give me a time and a place but you won’t cause you pussy.
---
minimap orbs? That is an abomination to the game, im glad I can toggle them off. What a weird reason to play the game lol.
---
Dude. Type ::renderself
---
Then, hover over logout. They’ll never get you if you pay attention
---
you should be able to do it now and get the poh theme when you reactivate members, yes
---
Except that it passed the poll twice before failing the 3rd time. If Jagex had just done it then it wouldn't be an issue. Players choice and will of the playerbase is the exact same thing. Ur logic is flawed.
---
Alch them ya, but start farming and birdhouses. Also Varrock diary and miscellania. Free money!

The new volume sliders are a runelite thing. If you think they should work differently go ask for it on the discord.

No idea about bond price, I’ve never bought one before haha
---
Damn this meme really makes me feel like I'm in 2007
---
The fact that it was polled 3 times. And that it passed the poll twice before failing the 3rd time. And you know what else? It should be up to the individual player. You don't want to resize ur spells? Then don't. But you shouldn't be able to tell me that I can't. The most successful franchise in gaming history, world of Warcraft, has add-ons that cater to the player customising their UI to however they want. Maybe Jagex should follow their example. And if they had just updated their client to keep up with 3PC in the first place then this wouldn't even be an issue.
---
90 range my dude
---
Probably agree, it’s pretty hefty. I wouldn’t pay that on a short flight, 15 hours though, it was nice to be able to play rune, chat to the girlfriend etc.
---
If I had to guess. You would need to start by getting pesos. Once done you would have to access a VPN and go through a Mexican port to access the the jagex store. Could use a VM if your sketches out. But in the end I must recomend against this, I don't know what shift things daddy jagex will allow.

Alternately you could also have an occult altar in your house, It's what I'm using to burst/barrage to 99 hp
---
Crystal halberd
---
It was pretty funny. Everyone was afk and quiet until the fishing spots disappeared.  We all ran around looking for them and no one hopped because everyone got a kick out of it. Had to have been there I guess
---
That’s the reason I did mta on the flight. What else are you gonna do? Seems a pretty good time to buckle in and grind it, though would have been so much easier with runelite features (not sure if they’re bannable now?). I still got in a good 4 hour sleep so the flight wasn’t too bad. Had an aisle seat with no one next to me so pretty spacious as well, pretty good flight actually
---
just a comment once
---
Yes I believe that is the point
---
MVP
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
If you want to learn, trios is better choice. 
---
Due to how turning Olm's head works, duos are significantly harder than trios, especially when you are new to a lot of mechanics. 
---
Go to a discord where people learn raids, like 'we do raids' and find someone to teach you for a couple. Its easy to find raids with randoms there.
---
Its certainly possible to learn with duos, and thats how I started, but its just a lot harder, need to suicide brews to Olm ect
---
Must be a drunk bot farm.
---
I do have it but leaving repeatedly is a pain. Having an alt there seems most efficient
---
Slayer looting alts opaf
---
What a load of horseshit.
---
Finally someone else with the right suggestions.
---
Miscellenia and varrock diaries end up just being a salary while you train and quest. I would get these done asap
---
Every sentence starts there in truth.
---
Don't worry, you still got 1281 kills left before officially going dry.
---
that master stash unit tho
---
Depends on how you view efficiency/what you view efficiency in. It's probably more efficient for xp/hr on your main but overall efficiency between the two accounts not so much especially if you account for the price of bonds
---
Clan man mode, as in a clan feeding 1 person, isn't going to ruin the competitive nature, unless again you're aiming for #1. Iron man is a more fair competitive game so fair enough for you guys to want it iron man but I would enjoy a non iron version so I still stand by my original comment. I would enjoy non iron because iron man forces you to play every part of the game where I may only want to do a couple specific things. Majority of the player base isn't iron so I think a non iron league would have more broad appeal too.
---
I mean he had a hit video on bots so he’s really just cashing in on the hysteria

This was in their first post about 3rd party clients under prohibited section. I think it's  it okay to use

"Features which allow you to interact with altars with fewer clicks than our client would allow."
---
Jagex cracked down on Zulrah bots as of late. I've seen hardly any obvious bots in my 500ish kc since scale/unique prices went up. Only seen 1 gibberish username, whereas before I'd see several gibberish usernames in a couple hours of Zulrah.
---
EoC literally halved the playerbase within a week of its release. What are you on about?
---
Then I shouldn't tell you I have the smoke devil pet which I also got at 20kc?
---
It failed to get 75% support three times and only passed once when bundled with another question. And player choice and will of the player base are not the same things; a specific player can choose to do anything they want, but it doesn't mean the player base will agree that thing should be possible. But if they are the same thing, then you said it should be the player's choice and those features failed their polls, so you agreed they shouldn't be possible since the players choose not to have them.
---
Sir I've seen so many people go dry on different things on this game, some ppl have more than 10k kill count with a single unique item at a boss, some people have 50m+ exp on a skill without getting a pet, me myself I have almost 32,700.000 exp on thieving without getting Rocky, I've tried almost every available method on the game just to get that chance to get the pet. But I think I'm not lucky enough or something. Most of the time I see people with 40- thieving have that pet that I was hunting for months and most of them are iron mens, I don't know what's wrong but I'm sure that there is something wrong.
---
I know this might sound as silly evidence but I cant trust osrs wiki any more with everything.
---
There’s zero good item sinks and every one that comes in never leaves because of the non existent death mechanics
---
Sniper take the shot.
---
EoC halved the playerbase within a week of its release, and the vote for opening up "oldschool" servers were opened up within the year. I do not think that is a coincidence.
---
Lance is far better than DHCB in CoX. If you plan on doing a lot of raids, you should sell the DHCB. Assuming you were doing vorkath with the crossbow, you can also melee vorkath for similar kills/hr and gp/hr. Personally, I preferred doing melee vorkath over the DHCB method.
---
I know

He's in Maize clan chat! Good guy, totally not a bot. Insane skillet account, like holy shit.

No never, FOR GUTHIX!

so whats the joke i missed?

Except I could be playing like 5 other games instead lol
---
No problem. He's max combat, I'm max melees with 91 range and 90 mage. I'm also 70 prayer. He's got tbow and max gear, I'm I'm void lol.
---

I know this is a joke. But in case someone was actually wondering this wouldn’t really work because modern browsers (Chrome) are ditching Java support.
---
I have not, I did 30,000 pre-collection log, I may have gotten around 20 or so. I've gotten 6 in the 6,000 after the log released.
---
One of the reasons they made inferno was because firecape is pretty much a joke to get now, they wanted to create something that would be an accomplishment for people that beat it, obviously the want to protect the integrity of that. If you go back and read the dev/release blogs they pretty much state this
---
A lot of the mobile players that came in a year ago are on bossing now. Theres probably a huge amount of those items coming into the game, much faster than they are leaving. Supply and demand can be a bitch.

While money makers like you mentioned are pulling in less money, everything is also costing less for the most part so thats nice. Even COX items are crashing hard, like the DHCB and stuff. Not sure about tbow
---
Yup and everyone on reddit bitches about having gold sinks, they are too dumb to realize item sinks is what we really need.

I have only killed 6,000 since the collection log released, I've gotten 6 from these 6,000, possibly around 20 from the previous 30,000. No daggers yet, kinda surprised, figured Jagex would give me that big finger, tbh. I have gotten about 5 or 6 Dragonstones WITHOUT the RoW, so there's that... xD

There will never be a right right only a right and wrong. Welcome to diversity. Rep and dem, zerkers and pures.💁🏻‍♂️

I did sheep herder recently and was shocked to get 4 QP.

Lol it’s not against the rules though, they didn’t say anything about hiding options, just moving or resizing. 
---
RIP you dude F lmao

I really liked his desert only ironman series.
---
Yes. But the runelite devs have been in constant contact with jagex. If it’s still there it’s fine
---
Can’t you alch them ?
---
Same. Well, I did try OSB once back in the day and I've logged on mobile a few things, but I have no issues with the vanilla client. That said, the desktop game really needs to port some of those mobile features like GPU and address some of the other accessibility and performance issues that Third-Party Clients offer.

Agreed man. But understand, that most people play this game 16+ hours a day and have no life, so they can get mills in a day. Be glad you arent one of them

Nmz normal custom rumble turn off a few bosses use super combats and dharoks. Use absorbs and stay in the middle so never out of cmb. Repot every 19 mins and lower hp back to 1.

Bandits if you go over 20 mins you stop auto retaliating, die, and get logged, possibly losing some stuff an hour later. Nmz you just lose the 26k you put in the coffer, which you make back and more from herb boxes anyway.

What does it actually say?

We're you praying melee? Cause praying melee makes the fight much harder
