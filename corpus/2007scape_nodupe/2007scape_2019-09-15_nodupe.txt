Just came back to RS 3 weeks ago. Havent played in over 8 years. Whens a good time to get membership?

$2 an hour is more than minimal wage in Hungary

---
noob
---
The game has been out for over 6 years dude.
---

---
If you started in 2013 and only played an hour a day, you'd be maxed right now.
---
\&gt; They're not going to work on apis, mod shauny over on rs3 has made it be known that's not something they will do. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Rs3 also said theyre not planning to be a good game or have mobile. OSRS has different rules.
---
\&gt;Good luck in your crusade. 
---
I mean mentioning that this is the only sensible solution isnt really a crusade.  We have more to lose from not lobbying for this than from lobbying for this.
---
Looks like you can’t cut a normal tree. 1 Woodcutting confirmed
---
That's an inefficient shortcut, the bridge should obviously be arched or the road should be dug down through an underpass so the "bridge" can be at ground level
---
Not even close...
---
There's just too much stuff to do in this game I'm always getting sidetracked
---
Good point - thank you, I was leaning towards blowpipe too but you are right I probably couldn't sustain it without constant blast furnace breaks
---
actually its 50/50
---
You have to click each individual rock on that shortcut, so unless they changed that...
---
You make 4m/hr at zulrah before costs, so 2m/hr and 5hrs/month is nothing.
---
This kind of pet luck makes me insane.
---
Easily the ugliest armour in the game.
---
Mate, bonds delete money from the game. They don't produce any money at all. When you buy a bond you need to activate it to be tradable to sell it. So you're putting in 10% of the bond's GE value then selling it. No money has entered the game, only left the game.
---
Why are you trying to report ?
---
Whenever you're comfortable. You could try and do all the f2p quests first, or you could get it right off the start.
---
They use the cats to catch the mice, theres dialogue that tells you if you know how to read.
---
It's already ingame so...
---
It makes you ass me you do
---
Weird place for it tbf
---
Yeaaaah, thats pretty bad. /u/jagex_wolf, this doesn't look good man.
---
Well, this is an abuse of moderator privileges..
---
&gt; Rs3 also said theyre not planning to be a good game or have mobile. OSRS has different rules.
---
That was meant for both games actually, they have no plans on working on any apis due to how much time they would have to dedicate to it. Also there's no difference between the games and their rules, both are owned by jagex; if jagex has already said they won't spend dev time on apis then that goes for both versions.

Yo I'm 1980 total and I just did my second firecape. It's just as fulfilling the second time too!!

Dude go join a cult rn
---
Sorry I don't read every dialogue chat in the game.
---
2.7?! I bought at 6!!!
---
What’s the context, what’s goin on here?
---
without any? probably decently difficult
---
maybe kill rex for a bit, see if you can get like 1.5 pots worth
---
I’m pretty sure Jagex can connect the dots on that main account receiving the money from the bot.
---
ah yeah. a skin is most certainly content and not a premium. 
---
it sounds crazy but some people want actual content and progress :)
---
PKers do 2 things.
---
1) PK people that aren't trying to PvP. Don't get me wrong, I understand PKing clue hunters / boss hunters. The former occasionally forget to bank so there's potential loot, and the latter bring loot and potentially get more in the trip. What I don't get are the people that PK at agility course / black salamanders. Every time you're just going to use more in supplies than you get from the kill, and the person can't even pretend to fight back so it's not even a challenge. No one ever brings more than 10k risk when doing these activities either (and 10k is assuming a stam pot at agility course). They just waste everyone's time, including their own.
---
2) Are extremely toxic. Not all pkers, but there are just so many pkers / pures that are overly toxic both in and out of the wilderness. I'm not sure if it's the PvP mindset, or the fact they're not playing on their main so they feel even more incognito (on top of the anonymity already present in any online games), but a lot of it just goes so far beyond what's reasonable. 
---
Add these two things together, people will vote no to anything that benefits that community just so hopefully they get bored and quit.
---
I'm pretty sure in some fine print somewhere, it most likely states you shouldn't be a dickface and mute people for 'annoying' you. How can you really not see that as an abuse of power?
---
Damn gg.
---
I thought auto clickers and stuff were actually ridiculously easy to track??
---
Steve W handles pmods more than Wolf.
---
Wait, how do you manage to buy a month of membs for so cheap??
---
Great time to make my first post on reddit. Sequoias are a redwood and are in California and Oregon. As well there are metasequoias in China.
---
It’s really not that bad...
---
the actual bot ie the shit that does the clicking is made in ahk. it uses runelite or a android emulator to play the mobile version of the game.
---
Swings like a pussy
---
increasing arceeus xp/hour by  under 1% is going to have the whole game shook, nobody will ever recover from it
---
I know him irl and he actually has a nice family and a well-paying job. He doesn't think it's unethical because he's not harming or stealing from anyone, he's just taking advantage of an opportunity to passively generate some extra cash. He's actually saving it all for his daughter's education
---
Can’t remove the PvP clan that has literally won 90% of pvp competitions.. LOL
---
I certainly do not blame you on RC or Prayer. Both of which are so much more incredibly quick to train on P2P vs doing so on F2P. Altars literally let you get 1-43 pray in something like 10 minutes. RC isn't as quick, obviously, but most of your options on P2P definitely beat out Fire Runes, lol.
---
I usually equip a Monkeyspeak amulet so I can talk to colored characters.
---
That is where you are wrong. History is written by those who they think they know what is best for the future. This is one of those moments where we know how to fix world hunger, but we aren't. 
---
There will come a day when our grand children look back on these statues and wonder what was wrong with us
---
There will always be skillers. Items will just be more expensive.
---
No gold sink? Must be a bad suggestion
---
He is scouting out the birdnest
---
Pick one of the rotations, and only attempt that one, and if it is a different one just log out and try again
---
why am I erect
---
It would significantly increase xp/hr. It's pretty much the sole reason lavas is fast. It would also make a skill most people dislike even more attention requiring to get good rates.
---
never proven to have done anything wrong btw
---
Might be cheaper to put a glory in your house and use house teleports. Extra time but save some money.
---
Well sorry for suggesting that players should actually look at the numbers to make an informed discsion rather than supporting or rejecting something based on assumption.
---
There's not two separate delays. The crafting of the runes is the only delay in runecrafting (and contact NPC)
---
First claw at 2750 and no pet at 3300. Consider yourself lucky
---
It's all AHK, there's no reason to get complicated because all this stuff is static. You mark items in the inventory, you put the items in the right bank slot, and you run the script.

Nah it's pretty real, I have a friend who has a cooking/fletching only account with the bot in the video and is nearing 90M fletching exp. He's ran it basically 24/7 for the past few months.
---
Frickin hell all I wanted was a prayer and stamina recharge before heading off to the GE I didn't realize this was being treated like a full time job in a dog-eat-dog market.

&gt;lotta complaining about bots on this subreddit
---
There's more complaining about people complaining about bots. This sub is all but pro-botting.
---
Hey man i don't blame ya, i've seen some really shitty things in some other games. I used to have a guild of 300 people in another game that was child friendly and a more for fun gaming group that did some occasional speedruns for fun in a game that had some flashy titles. Nothing too big or fancy. But i saw firsthand the low levels that people would go to see the dirty and low levels people would go to for a video game. Ddosing, attempted doxxing, drama and rumors sent in and also all the underhanded natures where when we went to try recruiting people with fun they'd start ddosing members if they joined ours and poach members and ddos. Some people are just fucking disgusting and underhanded.
---
Sammich
---
Do you mind telling me the const level needed for that? Also isn't there a fountain or something that restores run?
---
I started again last year as lvl 3. Went for rfd and 99 rc first. After about 9 months I am at 2.1k+ ttl 1 pet smolcano, all buyables skills done, and about 570mil bank atm. I played about 2k hours so far. Don't boss except for kree and vork really seldomnly.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
Former ex.. so you were, then you weren’t, and now you are again?
---
Even those were gone. We sent a scout and he... hopped worlds.
---
Lava runecrafting is zero delay. Applying that to other runes should be little work. In any case, I wouldn't care for this change because I think band-aid fixes/buffs delay fixes to fundamental issues.
---
All the fishing spots were unavailable for like a minute lol
---
absolutely not, you can sell back glories for basically full price or go recharge them for a chance at eternals. Its negligible cost in comparison to gp/hr from abyss crafting. 
---
Plus you could EASILY get pked for it, considering you get skulled every entrance into the abyss without the bracelet (which only has 5 charges in and of itself).
---
I’ll finish up 80 rc by tomorrow. Around 34-36 hours for 70-80
---
47 construction for the glory and a lot higher for the fountain but definitely a worthwhile investment. If anything spend the money you’d use on an eternal glory for the construction levels and make your life easier
---
How do the coffers work for Managing Miscellania? I'm confused on how you get profit from this mode.
---
I need this template nephew
---
What is that?
---
Could pay to play, i mean as far as enjoying the game. If you need time saved,  that's the way top do it. I paid for one year and now I am end game
---
Example: go to the air orb obelisk in the wilderness.90% of the players there are bots woth 70-99+ magic all botted lol
---
Because it's an unbelievable pain in the ass to obtain. 1 in 250 chance from a 1 in 40 item from mith drags, or 1 in 32k from mith drags themselves. Unless you
---
That’s just what RS3 looks like
---
Imagine thinking anything is impressive
---
It has nothing to do with "rs3 design", the proportions just look goofy. big shoulders, tiny arms, huge grey underwear?! 
---
Orikalkum armor doesn't have any of those problems, it's sexy AF.
---
my first language is english and probably half the shit I say is based off me spamming random shit on rs lol.
---
I understand the sentiment, but this post is written pretty terribly.
---
I think its supposed to be a joke, the herblore level is 2 and the 73 is a reference to b0aty
---
QPC was one of my favourite achievements in RS3, I can't wait to do it again in OS. Song of the Elves is going to murder my hands and my bank though, so many high level skills
---
Correct.. that’s when happens when you stop playing and restart playing..
---
Your GF is making some cool AF shit, keep HER
---
I would highly recommend just being kind and helpful to new players and the people around you. When I was a noob slaying spiritual warriors with a D Long back in the day, some kind person started a conversation with me and ended up giving me my first whip. That encounter has made me want to pay it forward as I've progressed in the game. A simple gesture can mean a lot to somebody, and I think that is an amazing way to support and promote a positive community.
---
Lol I’m salty one, sure. Or what you and the boys will 5v1 me in rags on my way to kbd lol

Hey Jase did it to 200m

95k/hr mining xp afk.. That will never be dead content

Jagex gave a streamer a 2 week ban for RWT so that publicly set a precedent for the first offence. They can't really stay from that or their favouritism becomes blatant.
---
why is reddit mentally challenged
---
Watch a YouTube video and follow the exact same rotation they have. If you get the wrong one tele out and enter again until you get the rotation as the video. Follow everything the person does

Why is farming so frustrating? Is there a better way to try and level it than just growing potatoes and then forgetting about them(lmao)? Are there really any benefits from high level farming?

Not enough moving on the operators part. Not nearly annoying as ele workshop

Are there any discords / clan chats for people who do BA? I need to get kandarin hard done and I figure I should grind out fighter torso while im there. Doing one round solo was fine but i think a group would be much better.

Anyone wanna grind it out tomorrow? or push me towards a group that'd help? thanks :D
---
As an Australian, Christmas Island is mad fucked up.
---
quest cape is a big one for a lot of people.  base 60s/70s/80s, etc.  I guess 80 slayer for nechs and maybe 85 for abby demons.  Barrows gloves is an important early one.
---
Is it really?
---
Abyss runecrafting makes you skulled though which makes you lose it unless you protect item
---
That shit looks awesome. How much gp for your gf?
---
It's of runescape characters, what else do you expect? Every r34 sub is like that
---
these are extremely simple bots, essentially glorified AHK.  reimplementing the gradual camera drifting or random events would get rid of these bots.
---
Make east drags great again
---
Yeah it's a detention centre island where we send all the refugees that try to come here via boat, Australia treats them all like shit, you've probably seen a few news articles about teenagers being killed there
---
Can confirm, can't read.
---
Sheesh. That sounds like some other worldly shit.
---
Nope. Get with the times
---
[deleted]
---
these are extremely simple bots that don't reverse engineer the client at all. its essentially glorified AHK. reimplementing the gradual camera drifting or random events would get rid of these bots. otherwise there isnt really a way to detect them.
---
jagex actually does a pretty good job banning the typical bot.
---
Required for a master clue step now.
---
Yeah our government is all about the human rights violations
---
Me when i was 10 going into my sister’s room
---
It's one of the few (only?) skills that doesn't (appear to) offer any form of instant gratification. Not to sound condescending, but I recommend trying to have more patience.
---
I recommend questing through the early levels of farming.  
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quest_experience_rewards#Farming
---
Once you hit 32 you can grow Ranarrs and make some good money.  Fruit trees are an way to level farming up, just do 1 run a day and collect 10k-25k xp.  
---
High level farming increases your yield when harvesting some crops, like herbs.  This makes you more money.  It's not uncommon to see people with 99 farming doing herb runs.
---
Jagex sells gold (by selling bonds) which is a huge incentive to ban other gold sellers, it gives them a monopoly
---
Thanks! That was my goal to make them not drawn out. Short, simple, and to the point. Thanks for the sub too!
---
Link to bot??
---
These mobile bots are literally just input recorders. There's nothing sophisticated or new about them. 
---
An example would be the salamander "script". All it does is click in one spot every like 10-20 seconds lmao. It doesn't even detect if a salamander has been caught or not, it just has a long enough time inbetween clicks so that its very likely you've caught one. 
---
To my knowledge no one has created a deobber for the mobile so the only types of bots that can exist are either color detection bots, or just basic ass input playback
---
You aren't supposed to say it out loud.
---
2.2k is strictly for Rot. No spots are sold.
---
Why hasn’t Jagex allowed us to opt for the trim/untrimmed version as an option? Maybe a toggle or just ask an NPC to switch one for the other. 
---
Maybe this isn’t really a priority?
---
you can autoclick alch on the exact same interval for 18 hours a day and not get banned so delay between interactions plays no part. i know many people who have done this
---
You're completely right. I think Weath does a splendid job on his own, I don't really think he needs help. Bots are always an issue, and have been since old rs2. I don't understand why people are bitching about it now, when they were far worse in old rs2. Heck, even rs3 is full of bots that aren't banned, but nobody complains about them? Maybe because RS3 actually needs those players hahaha. 
---
I'd guarantee you if pugger worked for Jagex, he'd sell out to a bot developer and tell them exactly how the anti cheat system works. It's why only 2-3 people work in the anti cheating team, to prevent exactly this from happening. They probably make sure to hire someone with fk all knowledge about the game, just to ensure they don't do exactly this. 
---
Bots have been in this game since thee beginning. People are getting salty over them now for no reason that I can think  of other than to cause more drama.
---
End me right fucking now.
---
Not that much cause you cant forget to leave a tip for the npc
---
That is really depressing lol
---
This is my problem with osrs there is ZERO incentive to not bot. How many are botting at yews? how many are botting fletching at lumby bank?  how many are botting red chinchompas? how many people bot motherlode mine? Don't tell me you don't see it otherwise you don't understand a bot's clickrate/response rate/random camera rotation. They have random a.i. to make them seem human.  
---
Point I'm making is there is no reason not to bot. If you want to start playing old school I'd honestly recommend you start botting 3 accs at once. Being a botter from the past its super easy to get away with it now! You can easily get a 99 wc 99 hunter bot that is unbanned. So that leaves you as a mem with a nice 200 mill cash stack. Only idiots play this game legit and I am one of those idiots Jagex really does not not care they ban 1/10th of the bots out there. Botting is so easy in 07 its laughable. This is what makes me hate playing legit I put my real life time on this game and people just scoot by while they are out at the bar. Just like real life people abuse and capitalize on things that you do not!  
---
You know how EASY it is to set up 10 scrub accs run the tutorial island bot and have 10 accts farming for you? Thats called real life passive income friend. If you can secure minimum 5mill an hour (easy you can get 10-15 mill an hour no problem) you are making a decent source of income on top of your job. All this requires is your pc being on (low energy compared to an incandescent bulb) then you have them log out every 4 hours. Its hilariously easy to win the game out of game if you catch my drift.  
---
The only reason to play legit is for your own egotistic sense of pride. Which is narcissistic. Thanks Phaqex.
---
  
---
P.S. downvote me if you want none of you can provide a legitimate reason as to why I am incorrect here. Because I am not!
---
Were you risking it or something?
---
what else is reddit for... low effort memes and bitching. 
---
r/ironscape is no better, it's just "Hey guys look I got a drop", or "Hey guys look i didn't get a drop"
---
I heard it from another you been messin' around.
---
This 100% when I first started I spent a lot of time trying to make money on like 200-300k an hour methods and wasted allot of time now that Iv spent some time progressing my account I can make 600-800 k an hour and I know I can make a lot more if I keep going

I don't even remember. I think I might have misclicked examine when I was trying to run under her to eat and panicked.

Not if that is construction, herb, and prayer xp

24th battalion mafia boi here. I also did the pvps.
---
He stole hundreds of thousands worth of gold, that’s a massive misuse of power and has to be criminal.
---

---
No you can't, don't say you can. Because I've talked to a lot of people who said they got banned for autoclicking. The ones I've talked to who said they autoclicked to 99, all said they used randomized intervals. Furthermore, if you play legit on that ip address and also bot at the same time, it's harder to get banned. 
---
The people who use the same interval are either full of shit or were playing legit on the ip at the same time on a very high skill total main. Also the accounts age is taken into consideration too. 
---
You can bot on an old account and get away with it for ages without getting banned. All it takes is one simple report to get yourself banned. 
---
Weath prioritizes gold farmers more than casual players. I really don't want to get into detail here, so I'll just leave it at that.
---
All I'm saying is if you go and make a new account, get 55 magic and high alch at the same interval for 18 hours a day, you will be banned within the next day or two. I guarantee it.
---
cool flair.
---
Once they do that, sure.  Point is right now they aint.
---
What are the rot hackings?
---
So the toxic one is the one trash talking you as you are killing them whilst tehy are in shit gear pvming?
---
Haha that’s an old gem just wondering why slayer glove haha
---
So tired of this nonsensical "trashtalking is toxic" shit that has begun to plague gaming communities...
---
Yeah, I dont blame any youtubers that do 10 min vids. If it's interesting enough I'd much rather them get paid for it, and have incentive to make more.
---
nice meme arrows u sperg

A little?

I think we were just so young at the time we probably didn’t realize we were wasting a gear slot. I asked myself the same question after seeing that haha.

He can make and wear it later. Then he should take it to the bank and deposit it.

i pick up all drops. so ill take the steel and bank it. shorter trips and takes longer. i end up just making them into cannonballs to get a little bit of xp and gp off them

You’re*

 Dumb pkers.

Crap does nobody get my joke? The mod mat k vid meme where hes trying to drop iron ore?

You tryna pay ridiculous prices for consumables? Because that's what happens when all the bots are gone.

Mining and smithing are both pretty bad gp per hour. You're better off making gp from pvm and buying cballs

You're best bet is to not worry about gp

Iunno. Like i dont pvp at all. But i will admit it was torvesta and his silly sound bite laden pvp vids that got me back into the game after my last break. I can deff see why people enjoy it
---
Thats even worse
---
Hail satan
---
KempQ was banned for selling. I was referring to buying. Selling = permaban for the first offence and buying = 2 week ban for the first offence.
---
2k here and 11 long bones on my hcim
---
just dont cheat
---
thats good advice, however this ban was like a year ago. Since then I've made a new acc cheating but just really not enjoying rebuilding. Maybe I deserve it; I'm still gonna try and get that account back tho.
---
There is always the same number of spots. Everytime one "disappears" it only moves to a new spot. Sometimes it seems like there are less becuase several/all of them are in the same square.
---
Imagine not just using the forums back then. I used the forums to buy everything... the ge just made it a slightly more convenient experience.
---
???most of skills in osrs can be classified as needless tedium
---
Funny
---
Hey im doing it on my alt. I may need a partner and ill check which clan im in. If u wanna do heros next weekend pm me! If ee in same clan cant do

Didn't a jmod come out and say on here that you won't get banned for buying 100m? I can't remember which one said that

Looks like Giovanni from Fire Force

Sounds like a lot more fun than doing all this myself, would love to have a proper pair/group
---
This is not a bug though, this method of infinite TBs has been in game since Jagex changed how TBing works. Not arguing with you at all, just pointing out that this has been an issue since Jagex updated how TB works. 
---
The way it works now is you can cancel the TB if the TBer dies. In theory this is beneficial if your character can kill/do the most damage to the TBer and get immunity from attacks. What happens in reality is a clan will half TB someone for 2 mins 30 secs, unleash specs for ~2mins 20secs on the target, kill the 1st TBer, then throw another TB, repeat until target is out.
---
Indeed I am, it is better DPS than rune crossbow (someone posted a detailed comparison here, I'd find it rn but on my phone and just woke up lol), and I have bh points for the rune arrows so I'm using it for the long run 
---
Got serp helm yday as my first unique around 200kc

Whats the best way, money wise, to use crystal shards?

Oh damn man, I have about a 5 in 1000 chance of being lucky to get no drop, if you were 200 dry without a split, assuming low point 50k total raids that's a 1 in 200000 chance of happening

Keep in mind that the puzzle resets each time you fail it, so you need to start from scratch. This delayed me for ages when I did it cause I didn't realise they had moved when i'd made a mistake. The other tip is that for the clue 'I am not next to number 2' or something along those lines, that is number 2 or whatever the named number is. Im on my way home from work so can't figure it out right now but will do when im home if no one else does
---
Correct!
---
Booo
---
It's upsetting that this video was more of an advertisement for the bot than anything else.

Nice.
---
U know what sub ur on. We get useless 99s and items. Some of us are even more autistic and go for 200ms or pets. These people are just addicted to lifting more weight or addicted to building more muscles just like how we’re addicted to rs
---
I expect a video with facts about the beaver now
---
Instead it's just informed me mobile bots exist and can't be banned yet. After searching the YouTube comments I found the bot he made a video about. Fantastic.
---
Depends on your situation I guess. I pay membership every month because I work 45 hours a week and I don't feel like farming 2-3 hours in free time for the bond where 20-30 minutes of work earns me one. I spend so many hours in the game 11 dollars is nothing.
---
The fuck kinda dirt hut, Alabama population of 3 shittastic school did you go to fella?
---
Worked for me and everyone else who i suggested it to and i explained why its easier.
---
It's the focus on efficiency that ruins the game (and of course the bots, but those have been around for a very long time)..
---
they forget, they don't do it on purpose
---
You attacked him but clicked on his friend so you skulled and you either clicked your quick prayers which didnt have protect on or just didnt turn it on
---
Couldn’t possible have noticed the chatbox without all the extra white surrounding it thanks.
---
this happened to me in game, just turned out to be existential dread following me around
---
Did you talk to Oziach?
---
Yeah this is dumb and needs changing
---
it was just a comment about americans and tipping please understand
---
Isn’t that the case with 90% of the bosses in game? It’s like a slotmachine that you have to pull with effort waiting for that 1 big drop
---
Lets not pretend that the game was perfect back when we were kids. Nothing wrong with improving the game.
---
Efficiency and the introduction of vorkath and zulrah, followed by raids. 500k an hr pales to 3m an hour, when back in the day 500k was alot.
---
Terrible idea
---
F2p is wasted time just buy membership, bonds, or gp lol
---
Granted. Konar yeets you off the cliff.
---
Just common sense to me after reading the post pretty obvious hes having a joke
---
don't
---
*The boys are back in town.*
---
Check slayermusiq's guide on this part, his explanation made this puzzle extremely easy.
---
Nothing. Alching is terrible XP and everyone should stop bank standing to do it.
---
dare i say it...?
---
PVMERS MAD
---
And that's actually a good thing 
---
Why? Because the botting problem will now be even worse, forcing Jagex to take actual action.
---
Besides, paying for a bot? Call me when it's free haha.  
---
Or don't. I don't need a bot to play rs, and you shouldn't either.
---
Have I?
---
Auto Weed baby
---
Just kidding, ive never done tithe farm :\*(
---
Vorkath does.
---
What they could do is trace the bot's trading.
---
A bot trades with a mule -&gt; that mule is marked too.
---
Now that mule gives money to others for "free"? - &gt; Those must be the ones buying the gold, ban anyone who had interaction with a mule.
---
Actually leave the mules "alive" to see who interacts with them as a honeypot.
---
Solid music choice. Veni vidi vici

If you’re looking for a clan you should check out Divine Valor, we’re a pretty big social clan that’s active in pretty much all timezones.

Ah, this is great!

My friend made a slayer cape years ago, and I'd forgotten about it.
---
[Not the best pic of it](https://imgur.com/a/tRiymDb), but the only one I could find.
---
I'd imagine EVE online is similar.
---
i think after getting the pet at 640 kc, my rng for any visage went out the window like 960~ kills later.
---
In the past you were allowed to have multiple accounts per ip. But each account was not allowed to have interaction with each other.
---
Trading between accounts was strongly prohibited and actively enforced.
---
Oh no of course I won't. I just think it's probably *not* a good idea to have made this public. He should have sent this to jagex only. Perhaps should have worded better but it was mostly in a disproving way.
---
And you can’t argue, so it probably is for the best.
---
If you're going to tet your avernic you might as well go for pen. The only real issue is getting the fail stacks.
---
I will look into his video. Thank you.
---
Exactly, this is not the type of bots they care too much about. In terms of all other public bots, they do get hit pretty hard. Private bots is another matter however.
---
Yes
---
The first thing that pops up is [literally a guy in full dharoks](https://imgur.com/a/t60Pbg6).

I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

But then again, that is kinda his ‘thing’ now. It’s what sets his YT apart from others, and is now well known for it. It’s interesting content, &amp; there’s probably quite a bit more to uncover on this Botting scene, so idk about sending it to Jagex
---
if you have 91 range and can't afford blowpipe you dun fucked up
---
Also do hue shifting!
---
You wrecked those guys ! Do you usually pk or have much experience in the wildy ? 
---
I'm a total pleb and freak out every time I get attacked even though I'm 122 cb :')
---
Was terrified of the wildy as a kid and never got over it haha
---
ogress
---
Because ranged is op, thus rigour makes it batshit op
---
That's beautiful. You really do love to see it.

I haven't read this story in years.

How is it toxic? If you can't beat them then don't use that world. That's the price paid for not being good enough.

---
Sure, I love watching how he breaks bots or find unique bot farms but this one is quite different. He's literally told everyone "hey look guys there's a bit with next to zero ban rate" and as I stated, people in the comments of that video are naming the site. That's much more damaging than the usual "check out this weird bot farm"
---
Question. 
---
Is my "old" RS2 account now in RS3?
---
I quit OSRS ~3 months ago. I would be playing ESO right now if WoW Classic hadn't launched. Good game choice that 1
---
It’s part of the set...
---
If jagex did weekly youtube vid about bot banning this image would be the opposite
---
Yes :(
---
See I’ve been doing that while I’ve been on but RNG has not been kind to me so started getting bored however I may return.
---
ZMI is 20k to 30k xpph
---
I agree. We now start with equal gear. However, but we used to start with equal gear aswell, which was the spiky staff. The first chest you opened decided what your combat style was gonna be for the first kill(s). And of course this meant you could get in the disadvantage of the combat triangle.
---
Right now, you have all combat styles available by default, but can still get RNG from chests. Especially with the superior offensive drop table. This can still make things very onesided if there is equality in skill. Do you think this RNG is more acceptable because at least there is a tribrid foundation that prevents falling victim to the combat triangle?
---
And do you think RNG is bad? Personally I think it is a necessary ingredient to make it fun. And therefore I thought the RNG in the previous LMS was exactly what made it fun. Working with what you have on a more strategic level. That has been very much reduced in the current LMS. It is more like a DMM final in my opinion, and is not the intended battle royale anymore.
---
Prove this to me please. Just because you seen like 10 bots all in the same place, that doesn't mean "the game is full of bots". Do you even know how many bots are in the game? 
---
Maybe no more than 5k. The only time it peaks, is on the weekends. There are more Venezuelans than bots.
---
I know for Konar she rolls you the same creature but the location can be different. I'm not sure what happens when you ie; get a greaters task from steve, finish it then go to Konar to get a  greaters task.
---
In any case you get a message if you want to repeat the last task so it is very testable.
---
Except you probably didn't get out with the loot lol
---
Thanks for explaining but i don't see any benefit it brings to the game and this just sounds like a selfish request
---
Are there any places where I could have left my salve ammy ei? I don't remember leaving anything at Torfinn if I died there but my salve ammy is still gone. Haven't killed vorkath in a couple weeks and I still have all my other gear.. Is there anywhere else I could have left it or have I just dropped it like a dick head
---
Gotta have a tip for the pker too
---
The benefit is literally connecting your wallet to the game allowing items to be bought and sold on the blockchain. There are a ton of economic benefits it brings. 
---
You gotta do a bit more research on the blockchain and Ethereum to see it? Because its definitely there.
---
new one is very fun.
---
haha thanks for the free Tele stupid rat
---
Gz
---
Go to stronghold of security and train on minotaurs, they drop arrows, runes, and essense. Also when urcombat stats are base 40s or a little higher go to floor 2 and train on flesh crawlers.
---
Camel btw
---
Keep going dude now ur dead you unlock wildy content and other stuff just go for it champ
---
Yes, never should "of".
---
9/11 and 3,032 killcount? Nice.
---
Pretty sure most UIMs alch their blood runes for exp right?
---
Why are cosmic runes all of a sudden 270 gp each?
---
Proto-venom
---
You can alch between attacks for passive mage exp, I did it to 99
---
Love pretending to be a bot, triggers people so fucking hard.
---
I was AFK at Vorkath entrance and this one dude called everyone standing there a bot, couple hours later I still stood there he passed by again and created a reddit post crying I was botting
---
they don't really 'help' with anything. but imo in a good game, the world should exist as a place for the player to exist within not just an environment who's only purpose is to serve the player.
---
These little stories or messages npc's can tell you really just make the world feel much more like a world
---
Dude I was having a shitty day but this gave me the warm fuzzies in my chest that I needed to keep going
---
"The art of the deal"
---
yeah but the current method pre 90 is 1.8x the speed, so you're rewarded with more attention. and Souls through the abyss are 300k+ an hour. Runespan is dead content post 77 unless you want to half afk
---
fuck off rat
---
tbh id argue that zeah rc is more afk haha
---
Yeah you are probably correct about that. Forgot that method existed, never trained it.
---
Yeah, I know
---
Lmfao
---
and 2277 total on the skills tab
---
snakeskin boots
---
Does that give a prayer bonus or smthn? If so thats really useful
---
Uhm Chambers of Xeric? That's about all I can think of.
---
I honestly don't know
---
This.
---
Dfw is an extremely marginal difference compared to antifire shield. Rigour is used in almost every ranged scenario and is a huge increase in dps.
---
they were waiting for the entire j mod staff to get 120 farming lol
---
Pretty much, yeah. Except next month the Outer Worlds is going to take up my usual OSRS time.
---
I thought d boots gave a better bonus tho when i compared them side by side? Or is it just better defensive stats for dboots?
---
Nice job.
---
u r correct
---
Is the graceful dyed as a result of the player shitting himself after eating spicy stew?
---
B0aty has less viewers because he isn't doing popular content (he streamed wow for a bit, sekiro, his hardcore died) so people like to watch other people like Sick Nerd (who b0aty often promotes and speaks highly of as they're good friends) who have good accounts/content.
---
yep i agree sir
---
Unless you care about high scores keep it going. That's a lot of time down the drain of you quit now.
---
additionally the reason I believe intervals don't mean anything for alching is because you can queue alchs up, this means that every X amount of time an alching will occur, the queue ensures that every single alch happens the exact same amount of time apart. 
---
so on their end I think they see you alching at max possible speed regardless of how often you click, by hand or otherwise.
---
and as I said, I have done this multiple times and my friends and their friends have all done it too. call me a liar if you want but i swear on my life.
---
On many points i agree. But not all hosts are a like, i've been hosting for 1-2 months now and as i do agree on some of your statements, you can't generalize all the hosts with this. The ones that are acting like this are really toxic are trying to get w330 to be their own. However there are a lot of hosts that have dipped from w330 because of them. So on one side yes i think the board is a good update because everyone can host with or without an ad (because the ''bigger, more well known hosts'' always had an ad. Hosting is still a free service, i don't know why these people are so ''godlike'' about themself. You make your own choise to host or not, it is your own decision if you'll go like '' yeah ill host ofr 8 hours today''. A host him/herself should never be dissappointed by what he makes, in the end everyone is there for the money ofcourse, but as you said in your post, it is always completely random. I still believe every player should have the chance to go into someones POH without any issues, some hosts have come into my house with their own/other accounts trying to make me quit hosting and spamming shit in my house so i see where you're coming from. This board has made it an even field, and the big hosts dont like it, i didnt like it at first either if im honest, because i had an ad up ( i still do:) ). So i like the post, but indeed don't remove the board!
---
Well, you took the bait
---
Now I feel dirty
---
My first purple was at 208kc ngl
---
F off
---
You see advertisements everywhere, remember when Runescape was only available on a Browser and they had 3 ad banners, one at the top one left and one right of the screen? It's the same thing. Most people just click their world and don't worry about the advertisements, mostly all of this is just telling the player what's going on. Free items from a Raffle, some TH Promo, Vic is free every so often to dump your bonus exp you don't have to buy him and Server Maintenance is just a general thing. Overall it's not that bad. As for player owned farms, yeah that was op as heck, still is kinda, always do it as a daily though.
---
Even if it was an advertisement from the beginning I'm pretty sure you're the only one that cares.
---
Lmao, how would you naturally reach that page without the direct link?
---
Don’t play anymore, but love to keep up with the community.
---
Who is sir plunger? Are bots as bad as they were circa... 2007-09? Why would jag. Keep the bots? Or not do anything ?

---
I'm 43 RC right now solely through Tears of Guthix and a few quests lol, never actually trained it. Although it's getting scarily close to my hunter level now.
---
redwoods is the best afk content in the game
---
Sure I believe I'm Phoenix Gang, I'll have to double check. But my username on here is the same as my RS one if you wanna add me!
---
I'm getting sentimental, this workshop is elemental, the guide is essential
---
Train your strength up to 60 would be a good start. Really it comes down to you picking a skill and just doing it. That's up to you but I can tell you some that I enjoyed at lower levels. Cooking, fletching, and smithing were all breakeven or profit. Cook fish, fletch logs into longbows, Smith bars into dart tips (requires tourist trap quest). If you wanna do combat but are bored of the sandcrabs you could start with some slayer. Some of the low level tasks suck and personally I'd recommend getting 85 combat to get tasks from neive before starting slayer, but if you really wanna do slayer at low levels it's an option. I did it at low levels, it's doable, just a good bit of annoying tasks and slower xp.
---
Purple btw, purple everywhere
---
I’m about to be seeing the same stuff at my place.  Got a Samsung 43” curved widescreen coming Monday or Tuesday.
---
The way to solve this problem would be just to mod SirPugger
---
Content creators are in the business of creating content. If you think they don't script some of their "crazy drop" videos then I've got a bridge to sell you. It's technically possible that you might run into a moron abyss RCing with an eternal glory and not using fally shield to 1 item protect it, but I wouldn't base that decision based off of a likely set up PKing video. Popular PK channels wouldn't be popular if they weren't embellishing the actual experience of what PKing is in OSRS.
---
Almost impossible to have 2M exp and have grinded for anything, nice look though.
---
I personally use Zammy Hasta/defender and SGS switch for spec
---
Pvm for profit at these levels is not really doable. Lots of people like training slayer since it trains combat, and allows you to make.a lot of money later on. At around 70 combat (not too sure) you can use konar as a slayer master which also gives quite the profit. 
---
Slayer also gives clue scrolls along the way from which you can make money too. They also kind of force you to train other skills and complete quests along the way
---
Guess I'm not going using my bones at the chaos altar for a week now...
---
you can do shit like that in pretty much every mmo lmao
---
The main problem with voting no is people don't like pkers and their solution is to allow no changes and wait for a part of the game thats been alive since the start to slowly die out where as it hasn't after 18 years of this game
---
I want to slap your parents.
---
I hope so but the example given makes it so hard to detect. What does stop someone from cutting out a bit of paper and using a pen to get consistent clicks just like the bot is doing? No mouse moving around to detect... I guess the last thing is reaction times but if someone is proper power leveling that goes out the window as well.
---
Did you try changing the color of the tile marker?
---
You know we had accounts on runescape before OSRS?
---
whos gonna tell him

---
I had an old account called bake baker 1 and can't figure out how to get it back for the life of me.

Because swapping to bp for blue phases is substantially faster. If you’re just camping this you’re wasting time. My kills are around 1:15 avg with bp swap. 1:45 is abysmal

Well you should really have snapped his neck in the shower. But again I saw your story and I feel very sorry about it I get to feel that how devastating it was and it shouldn't happen to anyone being lazy I can understand ( because I am) but enjoying on someone's else hard earned money and not contributing nothing plus cheating that's horrible plus bitching behind your back wow he's going to go to hell. I saw your story today (On YouTube) moving on is the right thing you should do and please take a lot of time to recognise people  ( that's my experience 😂)  and I wish you good luck with your future life I hope best wishes for you. 
---
And yes I have also started playing  Runescape today ( Inspired by your story) I can't do something's can you tell me where I can find a manual to instruct me ? And You are awesome Girl 👌🔥😎

Kingdom maybe

I have to know what's on the front side of your Nintendo shirt

---
Look at your journey this way, instead of your goal just being “make profit through something” make your goal “to build my account into a beast”.
---
To do this you need to complete useful quests, like recipe for disaster, dragons slayer 2, etc. Completing achievement diaries for quality of life upgrades. Making money becomes very easy once you properly build your account. Good luck man!

I used the EHP rates listed on CML for agility at each listed rate by level. Training agility standalone 1-30 is 6k/hr, 30-50 was like 44k I think 
---
EHP rates dont factor in Bonus XP (Start/End) afaik
---
Also crude chair guy 200m all lol

The IPs that he sent to ROT to DDoS aren't Jagex property though.

Bruh sorry if I dont know shit

Do you have a link to the original?

Ah yes, the "it's buyable, so we shouldn't have it" reason. Because firemaking, fetching, smithing, herblore, etc are totally not buyable.
---
Dislike it all you want (I do), but that's the dumbest reason to do so
---
How? He’s talking about clickbait and ten minute lengths?
---
There's already ahrims and rune pouch but i don't see any of y'all using that, none of it is relevant anyways since if you know there's a chance of being skulltricked, there is absolutely no incentive to anti-pk since your rags are worth less then the food im carrying

They're not. You must have just bought from the GE at a time where the only comics for sell were 270 coins which is pretty damn unlucky.

You can't determine that shit.

Ignore all these comments if you wanna make a skiller you have to be level 3 or you can be a 10hp skiller and get magic str from barbs etc. But imo either make a skiller or a main what you've suggested is pointless you'll realise it after you've spent hours on it
---
='(
---
Assuming your account was not hijacked in the interim (because sadly for a while many accounts were being hijacked due to poor security practices on jagex's side and easy recovery methods), then yes, you would be able to sell off your rares in RS3.
---
At that point you could either take the 100% safe and legit route and buy bonds in game to redeem them for membership time which would work on both your RS3 and old school accounts with the same username; or take the quasi legit route and transfer your money from RS3 to old School. it's technically a matter of trust and technically not sanctioned by jagex, but I'm sure others here could direct you to fairly safe swapping groups.
---
Rigour hands down, assuming you can dedicate yourself to another rebuild grind
---
Pvm drops is like 110m.

Pker loot is around 35m give or take.

I got the pet at 120kc and then again at 190, guess I won't be seeing a visage
---
delet
---
probably nothing considering he didnt say the name of the bot at any point
---
Highly recommend a bunch of the nerd rappers on YouTube
---
Rustage, Gameboy Jones, Daddyphatsnaps, and JT Music are some of my favorites. They often feature on each others work too so theres a bunch more to find
---
Unless those are their only 99s and they bottled for them...
---
Btw
---
There have been discussions in RS3's subreddit in regards to ongoing political discussions in Britain. It's speculated Jagex might be forced to remove DA (and TH!) in RS3. If law changes were to become reality, one could easily presume it would apply to our DA aswell.
---
I like what the DA tax is doing though
---
I get annoyed with how many RCing bots have untrimmed rc capes.  But the crazy thing is that Sir Puggers video only advertised the bot instead of trying to prevent people from using it.  If anything he needs to interview with Weath, but promote the bot...
---
Why is this so funny
---
The highlight of my week.
---
Yeah kinda, he's getting less and less coherent
---
Why dont you roll up and see for yourself
---
Ah yes, the famous discontinued scythes and tbows. So elusive.
---
Jagex killed zmi essence runners iirc
---
Wtf why do u only ok people for like 30k???? Wtf loser pker
---
The DHCB rebuy is some of the most fun I've had in a very long time in this game, so I might go for it!
---
I'm assuming you're doing vorkath?
---
Regardless of what content, the best move you could make would be to sell that dhcb back and get rigour ASAP. Then start re-building for dhcb. 
---
Pegasian boots are an extremely minor upgrade, and the Dragonfire ward even less so. Accuracy isn't a particularly important aspect of most combat situations. That goes doubly so when you have a weapon with an accuracy bonus against dragons.
---
If I were you, I'd sell dhcb for rigour, get a dragon hunter lance, and do melee vorkath. It's about the same kills/hr and slightly better profit/hr compared to dhcb vorkath.
---
They are becoming less common. People are saying that if they have a crasher, they tell them about the "Zalcanohost" CC and they normally just leave. The ones that crash are normally the ones that don't know about the in-game chat.
---
hmm ok good to know. Ill have to check if I got hacked. hopefully not though. I'm probably going to sell for real cash as I don't have interest in playing osrs anyway. I've had success selling gold in the past so shouldn't be a problem
---
was just there for 45 minutes no pkers so
---
People create 3-4 man teams inside our CC and these worlds are strictly for the team size they want.
---
That is a super casual set up, no switches at all.
---
When you realize anything over 85 doesn't really help that much, so you only have to get 85 and grind the rest slowly overtime.
---
Damn, good thinking on the organized crime tomes. Maybe a mix of both methods along with sand crabs here and there would keep hp low enough to make it interesting. 
---
And by that do you mean like a 60/99/1 PK build but with high skilling levels on it as well?
---
I'd be surprised if Jagex doesn't offer him a job on the bot busting team
---
i got another claw few kills later🤣
---
I remember how much variety did corrupt weapons bring to the game for f2p and p2p both. Glory days of pking for pures imo.  
---
Ep % was fun also because pking was sometimes very profitable due to that, the waiting time for it to get high was annoying though.
---
Everything is getting edited and improved. The Owner (Try Speaking) of Zalcano Discord lied to me and scammed me. People have seen screenshots, got angry and asked me to create a new one.
---
Yes they are, I bolt people out of 2.2k from time to time.
---
before seeing post :)
---
after seeing post &gt;:(
---
You mean masochistic, not sadistic ;)
---
I think that's part of the intended humor of the vids, but it has gotten old
---
Good. I think. Actually unsure, mind informing about what it is that annoyed you so much?
---
No but I seriously feel that pugger was trying to kick the hornet's nest to trigger some concrete reaction from Jagex. Yes, this sadly means more people will fall into botting, but if it gets a reaction out of jagex and helps the game in the long run, then I'm all for it.
---
We need bots gone, or at least under decent control. It's kind of a joke at this point. Everything gets botted.
---
What about helmet?
---
Nice run energy your beaver is mine now
---
I smell some lowkey begging for bonds right here
---
They do impact your gameplay by effecting the economy, though.
---
Hes had a 3rd age axe or pickaxe, I cant remember which one it was, from masters.
---
No idea, I think someone went through my post history after I made some comments that were pro PVP that people don’t like.
---
But anyway the account build is really fun but BH at that combat level is dead. 
---
You’ll have to go either deeper wildy pking or GE in pvp to find fights
---
1170kc no blowpipe
---

---
Rng pls
---
Seriously they already do, to buy gold legally all you have to do is buy a bond/bonds from the website, which are given to you in tradable format, and either sell them on the ge, or by trading another player. Replace the word sell for "buy gold with bond/s"
---
I haven't played in a while, why are the usernames the same?
---
Most of the activities in the game are easy and repetitive, it's no wonder this game is infested left and right with bots considering most of its content appeals more to machines rather than people playing a videogame.
---
Bots will never go away, it would require changing or introducing activities that are hard to bot or are more complex than what you would find in a cookie clicker flash game. Unfortunately whenever this is brought up, it's instantly shot down by people who think unengaging and boring gameplay is what makes Runescape what it is so i doubt the situation will ever change. If anything it will get worse with time.
---
Brilliant 😂
---
Here I go again arguing on the 07scape subreddit... This is why I don't talk to people in game. Everyone thinks they're the best player around. A sub 2k ironman will shit talk a max cape for fucks sake. Why do I even bother
---
Gz! What defense and attack were you rolling at while you trained strength?
---
You can tell the advertisers are getting to his head with these extra long videos
---
I had 60m before FC, I rushed Hunter when osrs first came out and I suck at RS
---
Yep that's it thanks, probably when i teled there to go to the obelisk. Idk why it didn't go off.
---
No, because monks are still significantly more afk than barb, requiring only to click the spot, click the deposit box, bank, and click the spot again rather than constantly drop full inventories. They're compatibly in intensity to eels but more exp. Eels would be the option if you want more gp/hr but less exp while still being afk. You're completely wrong about eels being faster than monks.
---
Ofc I did
---
80 in both mate

---
If I were a botter I'd program my boy to immediately pm him so I can do a video interview that leads to free publicity and hundreds of people buying my botting service.
---
If your above a certain str level even has the advantage seeing as they have 8 hp.
---
Appreciate it, congrats again!
---
why do you bother holding opinions that are wrong and then attempting to argue when its just not a winnable argument? I dunno lul
---
Would you say its somewhat easy?
---
What is dg??
---
Sounds awesome to me! I definitely prefer skilling to combat, but there's too much content locked behind combat requirements for me to ignore it. I don't know how well your idea would work, but you'd have to make some decisions regarding what you're willing to limit. All-in-all, play the game how you want to! Perhaps avoid combat only until ABSOLUTELY necessary? It's your account, your rules! Some things that are good to consider...
---
1. Priffdinas is a skiller's heaven, but it's locked behind SOTE, which is locked behind MEP1, which has a lvl 60 Range requirement
---
2. Dream Mentor is needed for some of the best Lunar Spells, but the quest requires 85 combat :(
---
3. Anything with a Slayer requirement (Diaries and Quests) should be considered.
---
As far as training Attack, you can get to 50 on Attack Dummies, then complete Vampire Slayer, Fight Arena, and Grand Tree for some relatively free Attack experience
---
Hot take. This game relies primarily on nostalgia and an OG player base. When that’s finally passed it dies. The game isn’t growing with new players it’s returning players who were reached by mobile.
---

---
He'd be better off trying to get rigour and just using blessed hides with a bp and snakeskin boots. Rigour is incredibly strong
---
Cheers dude, nice one!
---
Me: is rich
---
Literally everybody: You RwT'd!1!
---
I tanned leather lol
---
So what I see is someone tb'd you. You killed him, so the tb weares off. And you using a client such a runelite which shows you a timer for a normal tb time fucked you over. It doesn't refresh instantly when you kill someone. Seems like you got outsmarted. Not a bug at all.
---
Yup currently on that slayer grind
---
So sad there’s only 2270 to go :(
---
Just chin now
---
Did you train with the dagger?
---
Yeah, the whole function of bonds was to combat RWT, isn't this then a good thing?
---
Oh yeah thanks
---
No?
---
You're responsible what happens to your account, you're allowed to lend it out, but your still responsible for what's being said on it. Being mentally ill isn't really an excuse to behave poorly online and your account was rightfully muted. I hope you get it unmuted if this was your first offence, but jagex isn't really at fault.
---
Scavenging in wildy on f2p shouldn't be too risky, use sparsely populated worlds and be ready to world hop, wear green d'hide or leather, try to save your run energy and dodge around the npcs, bank any thing your aren't willing to lose
---
bruh...
---
You can't be level 1 in rs3.....
---
All you're getting from adding a vorkath head to a range cape is the assembler's ammo saving, it doesn't give you the range bonus or the extra damage
---
4:20 every day brother.
---
Yep another story, my friend told me he would edit the botting scripts, changing timers, and easy to edit stuff and never got banned. 1800+ total btw.
---
Source?
---
Yeah mine had a free and paid option, the paid option just had more anti-detection built in (more RNG mouse movements, etc) plus the paid option had the ability to return to the bank to refill waterskins so that definitely helped.
---
But even with the free version I don't think anyone got banned until I stopped being able to update it.
---
It's on the back burner now
---
Yeah like this jungler on league named "osrs sucks" who keeps feeding in my games!
---
Yeah I wish those bot-busting streams were more common. I even watched some of the RS3 ones because they're so entertaining
---
I think just the 2 largest pouches
---
how do you recover a 10 y/o plus account? mine got deleted :(
---
I hadn’t thought about scavenging on a quiet world before. Thanks so much for the tip :)
---
Shouldn't be a lot of camel on camelot?
---
People watch a youtube video and think they know it all man, botters aren't this issue, the buyers are. Same as guns (kinda), drugs, alcohol, cigarette ect. If there's wasn't demand there wouldn't be supply
---
just like my balls!!!!!!!
---
That would have been a good title 😂
---
You are aware the sub that you're in, right?
---
False. Plenty of bans are dished out. Free or premium doesnt matter. It’s true that if you actually would bot 4-5 hours a day the ban rate drastically decreases. Most people getting banned are ppl that bot 10h+ a day. Jagex makes alot of money they should just get a team that bans them 24/7. System won’t help
---
Exactly, but then they'd be Banning there player base, also a bad move.
---
People are going to bot, deal with it. It's not even really an issue. It's been going on for the entirely of the games life so clearly it's not going to kill the game like all these brainlets think it is.
---
Had a 250 streak with only a harpoon back when harpoon came from raids...
---
Recently had a 198 dry streak... Then got like 9 items in about 20 raids.
---
Currently on a \~100 dry streak of mostly 1+2's / solo CM... Can't wait for it to break :P (All these are solos btw)
---
If you're doing solos, dry streaks like that are really common... But they always even themselves out in the long run
---
they're not the multi and single combat areas... it's the aggro zones, that's why they keep changing
---
They were literally removed because they didn't actually kill bots anymore and were only killing afk players
---
Fair enough man
---
Botting is good for the game keeps skilling prices low.
---
I hate that this statement is true. Over the past 3 years the community on osrs has gone to shit.. personally I play a iron man and went dry at bandos and yet I’m still happy you had stellar luck, unfortunately most people would be jealous and salty that someone els got lucky.. that’s not how it should be. We all get lucky and unlucky In a game of rng, the osrs community needs to grow up.
---
Yes. I did barrows for 10 hours and averaged 956k/hr without a diary. Every bit of loot was tracked.
---
What? Are you implying that the building on the south side represents a right-click in-game interface?
---
The most effective way to get Jagex to deal with bots is making them such a big issue that they can no longer ignore the problem.
---
I recommend audible
---
Chinning MM2 monkeys is like 700k xp/h with black chinchompas. If money is no issue, getting 99 would cost you like 65-75m
---
More Slayer is always fun
---
Each account is separate for each game. Your account will have an RS3 character and OSRS Character that are completely separate from each other.
---
If you log into either one and it's on a tutorial, it means you had no prior character on that specific account for that specific game.
---
grabs popcorn
---
Gratz bro. Thos was my first 99 as well
---
But couldn't you just make the distribution not standardized? Sure not everyone clicks perfectly random in a radius of .5cm, but what if the bot was able to be random while still displaying certain tendencies (mostly clicking in a diagonal line for example).
---
You're going to need all those scales anyway, not sure what the problem is.
---
Nearly the entire player base buys gold.
---
You may not believe your friends do, but they do.
---
I have several friends from closed RWT communities and forums that partake in many “gray area” tasks such as skulking jobs, questing, trading rsgp for forum currency. 
---
When I came back to RuneScape I recovered my login to a forum and was able to do jobs to build my initial bank.
---
My point here is that it’s hard to tell who’s legitimately moving gold or what defines real world trad exactly.
---
People say rendi RWT inferno runs. Maybe. But in reality he did them for 600m gp. Granted inferno runs have their own rule set, but that’s just an example of a case where TECHNICALLY rwt didn’t take place, but a massive amount of gold moved hands.
---
TL;DR banning buyers would result in the game being wiped and many bans wouldn’t be correct bans at all and it would be a shit show.
---
Which is the point. If the problem becomes big enough, Jagex won't be able to avoid dealing with it.
---
Why even play runescape at all at that point though
---
At the end of the day if you max, almost nobody cares except yourself. If you cheated the system and used irl money for it, can *you* even care about maxing?
---
One never “quits” runescape. They just take breaks.

---
I don’t think it’s as big an issue as people say, because we get blown up population numbers for advertising/marketing and a steady flow of items in game.
---
But I do feel that if we banned some bots and wiped say an entire location such as dragons, then players could earn an honest wage manually killing dragons to sell bones and hides again. Which when I was a wee lad a trip to green drags to bank everything was worthwhile.
---
It's better to use Slayer helm if doing Slayer anyways
---
"I've been really busy, doing fuck all"
---
Not really because either way this has blown up his channel and he will have a shit load of views from it.

Probably has to do with the core gameplay loop being addictive to an exploitable degree.
---
I’ve officially checked out of this meme, but I appreciated it while it lasted for me. Quality, and ironic. Well done.
---
[You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqZY2zatqDg)
---
The bots he "gets banned" vs the bots banned is such a fucking small number that it's completely irrelevant.
---
Look at the bans for [last week](https://i.imgur.com/XvC9mk8.png) he did a video advertising a client, hovered over a few account names which Jagex still have to do investigations on. Lets say he was instrumental in at max 100 account bans, that is fucking nothing comparatively.
---
Imagine getting attacked by the feral vampyre.
---
This was brought to you by the 123+ combat gang.
---
as someone who has used xiabot since its release, i can confirm it's killing the game but most of us botters don't care. we just do it for the monetary gain irl rather than trying to get ahead in the game.
---
i won't stop doing it because it's too easy right now and i don't think a single one of my peers who uses xiabot has actually been punished so far. 
---
i emplore you to not get involved though as the more people who start using, the easier it will be to detect us + the cost of the bot is pretty hefty compared to other bot clients out there. i only use it because i make back way more than i put in.
---
Yes, but some smartass will bring up how bot developers will just create a workaround. Which they will, but even a short-term solution is better than just ignoring the issue.
---
And why are people so against these videos? Please give a serious reason because bringing the community together by celebrating highlights (and these *are highlights*, unlike Sean ranklin’s bullying videos for example). 
---
I hope I’ll know one day why people are so against this ^explainplz
---
And nothing of value was lost that day, who would want to be in that dudes stream anyway?
---
Im maxed.
---
It's ironic that you have "limited time" yet you're in a forum about a 2007 point and click medieval game commenting about how you're too grown up and don't have time for the game.
---
I hope one day i'll grow up to be a big boy like you.
---
I still have a few of my old 07 friends on my list on the off chance that they’ll maybe log in after all this time, used to game with a IGN called Adamlaws a whole bunch but he’s not logged in for years.

From a older more F2P, noob time.

I did Mage Arena 2 a week ago on a 1 def pure with 75 magic and 67 HP.  I'm not phenominal at the game by any means. I just cast spells and ate sharks. I did however locate the demon first, teleport to a bank, geared up and came back.
---
Whats the fastest way to get elite clues?

I have two sets of Easy/Med/Hard clues that I need to turn into master clues.

People on this sub keep whining about those lvl 3 gold farmer bots but at the same time seem to be completely fine with partially botting their mains etc.
---
I agree with you almost 100%. The problem is I did have a buddy start playing just to 99 cooking and rc then quit. He definitely didn’t do any exorbitant xp numbers, but he still looked like a bot lol.
---
I can't wait to come home from work, pour a nice glass of fine whiskey, and read over this once the kids go to sleep

POG
---
there really isn't a method that hasn't been countered yet.  the concept of detecting and blocking emulators isn't remotely unique to osrs mobile
---
people are going to start botting with glee now
---
Bots have been a problem since the beginning of time. The reality is, the price of selling GP has nothing to do with your gameplay or your quest to maxing your account. Just put on your big boy pants and you will be fine.

If you have an itch for some rare drops, go for it. Same goes with any boss variant on task.

That is very wise as I had problems I think he hit me with an 8 one time

You can minus raids 1 from there

What’s this from?

I’ll give you 50m osrs gp

In all honesty I don’t know what that hat is worth in rs3 but it’s easy to sell and swap

The only one I knew was the calf's, I accidentally used a bucket on one at lumbridge cows when I was a noob lmao

raids 1
---
Taking in to account the value of RS3 GP, about 2M OSRS GP.
---
One of my first and only succesfull scam attempts was when i aproached 2 dudes killing cows, i told them i was sam from school, they replied ''sam smith'' (or something along those lines), i said yes!

They hooked me up with some decent gear and i was on my way.
---
23 cents per kwh in california
---
I'm looking to do the inferno but have a quick gear question. At the moment, I've got 11m cash, justiciar faceguard, arma chest and legs, and ahrims. If I sell stuff, I can afford to buy:
---
Justiciar helm and arma chest and legs with ahrims top and bottom for mage
---
Verac helm, arma and dhide chest and legs, with ancestral and ahrim top and bottom
---
Justiciar helm, dhide chest and legs, ahrims and ancestral for the top and bottom
---
Which setup would be best?
---
I want to have this.
---
Adding onto this, sometimes they can get stuck closer up north so they can whack you at the farming patches.

highscores is trash concept anyway imo; one of those cheap exploitative tricks to push people with more vulnerable mindset into addiction

For sure! Thanks for the kind words.

I’ve been having the same issue for over a month. When i login on PC I get the error but mobile always works instantly. I just wait 25 minutes and usually PC will work

😂
---
Yes, and all I found was the vague bigger is better.
---
nope :(
---
No you still couldn't find a meaningful correlation because of the nature of bot bans, you have to consider which bots he went to, which ones he exposed and you would still have to compare overall bot bans and plenty of the bots that he "exposed" would have absolutely been banned before the video was released.
---
Go do your statistical analysis yourself mister standard deviation LOL, cmon, do a T test, compare bot bans before and after he released a video, will that beat your alpha value? It would dismiss something, and not your null hypothesis.
---
Pretty sure it changes assignment so you can get monsters that are Duffy for you tio kill (higher CB than you)
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
gz
---
which is why instead of just banning people like that, their accounts should be internally flagged for bot detection and investigated, then banned.
---
Is it worth it to start playing in 2019?
---
Casinos are regulated and you’re only allowed to enter when you’re an adult. This is a video game where children can gamble that’s not right
---
Thanks!
---
You realize this dude streams, but on top of it is making very grind intensive videos that are not easy to make due to the sheer amount of ingame time they take to accomplish?
---
When none of your friends play anymore and you get a 99
---
If you’re inferring anything from that video, you’re an idiot and you are killing and devaluing the game.
---
My girlfriend and I just created new accounts together and I have no clue what to do other than grinding levels and getting money. What are some other stuff we can do together?
---
It’s a straight buff to tanking with no buff to DPS. It makes it more difficult overall to kill anyone in the wilderness.
---
A buff to tanking on protected styles would need to be accompanied with a buff to DPS/damage on unprotected styles for the overall balance to be maintained. If that was done then I would happily support the update, since it would encourage higher skill tanking and defence as well as higher skill style switching.
---
It would actually mitigate a lot of current issues with low-skill tanking such as camping mage pray with bulwark and hides setup in addition to making PvP more rewarding to higher skill.
---
And it’s maybe a half second faster if it even is faster at all
---
Huh. I wondered what the code was for. thx.
---
You wanna walk all the way to the troll mountain then realize you need an iron bar?
---
Why? There’s a good reason it’s not 100% protection against players... that’s insane, you couldn’t even smite them down with one style.

What? I’m over 40 Skoto KC and no pet lol

You described a form of commission staking. Keeping ANY cut for profit is against policy as a player run game of chance. There are people who do 0% commission stakes which I think is fine but then you have the people keeping some cut

---
Exactly mate, this is gold
---
It won't disadvantage you in any particular way, its not a competitive mmo in that sense. The only effect botters have is typically on the overall economy, but if anything its somewhat advantageous in some regards as it makes certain items cheaper to purchase.
---
Is it getting nerfed again?
---
I feel like all of these very relatively known back in the old days..
---
Laugh at it all you want, but the point of explaining how you could show an impact of his video with a statistical analysis proves that there is value in having other weeks to compare this one too. If including the week is useless for a bunch of hypothetical reasons, then not including it is twice as useless. At least with including it we can start thinking about possible reasons for the fluctuation. By showing only that one week in a vacuum there’s nothing to think about. It’s just a number.
---
Thank you
---
The way it was talked about made it sound like the whole island was the detention centre, it wasn't until I googled it when writing my comments that I realised that
---
Either way, not too concerned. Never done it so it's not a concern of mine
---
Botting? Never heard of it
---
Research the prices long before you sell.

Many rares are way above max cash and the GE price is wildly inaccurate

no one likes you

Why is this being upvoted?  This post is at best, tasteless hating on overweight people.  Obesity is more than a health issue.  Mental issues and poverty play huge roles in obesity.  Go travel to the poorest counties in America and you'll find that the only food people have access to are what you would classify as pure "junk food".
---
It's sad that people think making fun of obese people can be classified as "humor".

Nice

It's true, if you are knowledgeable enough on coding, you could make your own scripts + custom client to run the scripts. Pretty much 99.9% undetectable

I would agree that this could be a great addition to cwars. But I don't see the devs taking the time to do so. I would assume it would be easier to just make a cc for each team or something of sorts

Hi 25 buttholes

No it's not just a number holy fuck LOL. They ban LOTS of accounts, him right clicking in 100 in a video is a drop in the bucket of the over 150k banned in that week, you are completely missing the point.
---
i love the weekly *“make me play this game even though im constantly rendering myself an inept retard with no understanding of how anything works and no will to seek information myself”*

please stay away, you’re a disadvantage to the subreddit already.

Are bots the reason for items crashing/rising weirdly recently? is something bad incoming for OSRS?

You can try to appeal the ban and say it wasn’t you playing during that time and get it unbanned. It’s happened for some people at least.

5b isnt quite enough for max all gear so there's a lot to do with it.
---
I know some of those numbers. 
---
Explain it to the rest of the people who may not understand.
---
(not me of course as I 100% understand what you were doing there)
---
That is a 16 bit max int. You'll find it all over.
---
I’ve decided to only go for 99 str when I can afford a bludgeon. Would you recommend the dagger tho?
---
Is runelite still banned ?
---
Now THIS is content. Cant wait to see what happens next!
---
Damn I had a really ancient account back then. But I sadly closed my email. Wonder if I could get it back
---
Or just (509/512)^(900) = 0.5%
---
1/200 stil doesn't seem too bad. It's annoying how a 900 drystreak is still not a statistical anomally. When I went 98 dry on my first Barrow's item I concluded that I was among the 0.3%, or roughly 1/300, and I realized that if 30.000 people tried barrows for 100 chests, 100 of them would have gone dry as long as I did, statistically. Even if you are going dry this badly, you can't even brag that you are the only one with such bad luck. RNG sucks if you are unlucky :(
---
So wholesome.

This is just him displaying an old picture of rendis previous occupation. For some reason people are taking this seriously.
---
I'm trying to complete the Varrock Kudos, the only thing I'm missing is display case 3 which is the Dragon'Hai history book. When I talk to Minas about it I cannot tell him about anymore quests and using the book on him does nothing. Any ideas?
---
29k chaos would be quicker with the right rc lvl
---
don't buy it if you can't afford it.
---
Okay, cool.
---
Depends. I do it for the pet chance, absolutely no way I'd bother otherwise. Boss isn't fun to and the loot is only okay. If you enjoy it though why not, it's a game for having fun.
---
Nothing to use the scales on.
---
Their foreheads are beginning to cave in
---
If you see yourself getting unsireds at a decent rate I'd keep going at it. I'm 73 kc into the boss with no unsired so I stopped killing it because its regular drops aren't very good. It's a good pet hunt, though.
---
Aah thanks
---
This is amazing. RuneScape has such a massive impact on social connections.
---
That’s what my internal struggle is lol but I guess since I’m NMZ training, defense isn’t paramount in anyway shape or form. You’ve made up my mind for me. Thank you sir.
---
Then they should go pvm or skill rather than bank stand. Nobody cares about pets anyway.
---
Oh, much faster. Most ironmen get 100-300k chaos runes during their Barrows grind, so it is quite pointless. This guy is just unlucky.
---
He is working on loot from 1000 kills in pvp
---
More gp in game now. 3rd age is probably the rarest thing in game.
---
i got mine on 18 kc
---
You can dodge the vampire if you do it correctly, and at 123+ combat he won't attack you at all. I'm around 108 combat and I can still escape without him attacking me (I trap him behind the patch basically) because I have the paths figured out after lots of experience running around there. This is zero time -- I can just click the patch and the autopathing will get the vampire stuck as long as I'm running instead of walking.
---
Also it's around 2-3 seconds faster so I prefer to use it since I already have POH teles when doing farm runs, and this saves an inventory slot since I don't need to bring an Ectophial. I suppose pre-Lumby Elite you'll still need a Dramen staff so it won't make a difference inventory-wise.
---
.
---
Maybe they care why the pets, abd maybe they just got done pvming and are waiting on the split with their team.
---
I havent played for a while so im not up to date with the upcoming stuff. Is there anything big even planned right now? Like inferno, raids, gwd, grandmaster quest style?
---
I feel like there is a drought of upcoming content. Kinda remember getting hyped on the raids 2 release and the game exploding on twitch etc.
---
Current online player amount is also decreasing a lot i see. From 140k when mobile launched to 90k on sunday prime time. Reading posts on the reddit also kinda makes me think at least 30-40% of those are bots.
---
So what's going on and is there anything fun happening soon?
---
That’s not bad wait till you get a double rdt empty roll and get just 182 scales.
---
Do old accounts get removed? I have one from I think 2003 but I can't remember anything.

Can you take the bikini off that Ogress shaman please Zuhaar?

Flush your DNS cache, worked for me.

Love the idea of getting hunting exp

Uhh..that acc will only work on rs3 if its from 2006. Not sure I get what you're talking about here. Have you made an osrs account?
---
Literally playing in the kitchen, beyond help. It’s a shame really
---
Way less funny ripoff of the one level per episode guy if we're being honest
---
Clearly you are not part of everyone. I am sorry but that that is just the way it is.
---
Took Acorn 30 minutes to do something Mod Stone couldn't do in years. What an absolutely useless employee that guy was.
---
depends on the rotation, rotation 4 with tbow only can get sub 1min kills, the other rotations though are usually longer for sure it's just a lot more chill.
---
Genetic factors and microbiota factors have huge implications for weight gain. I used to work with various strains of mice who would  become severely overweight or look normal based off of their genome or gut microbiome. I'm under the personal belief that anyone can be healthy and fit, but to disparage genetic and environmental factors of weight gain shows a superficial understanding of the subject.
---
On one hand it's disgusting what people do to themselves... but on the other it's quite amazing how malleable the human body really is.

I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted this post is pathetic, literally just laughing at fat people with the tiniest tacked on link to OSRS
---
Mine too. RIP my very first account, noname8888. I was like 12.

Max hits do matter even with the damage cap, you’re more likely to hit a 50 with a higher max hit

Quick post a redberry pie

So fat she turned Asian.

I'd love to watch him violently conquer my expensive 10m gp RS gf tbh. With his bulging rune sword I reckon he could *truly* satisfy her in a way my gp never could.

You can use we do raids discord or offer a team money to let you do it

Split the quest into 2 episodes
---
Yeah I guess you haven't seen the memes on here doing exactly that? I love 70% of this sub, there's a lot of good fun going going on, bit there's also an annoying amount of tasteless "humor" like this or ableism. It always makes me feel a bit ashamed to be part of the community
---
Learn how many attacks you can do with blowpipe on each blue phase and then subsitute the last blowpipe hit for a bow hit instead.
---
An example is on rotation 1 and 2, the blue zulrah that spawns after the red in the centre, you can get 5 blowpipe hits + 1 tbow at the end as it goes down. Not all blue phases allow 5+1 though, some a different so you'll need to trial and error it, eventually it just clicks and you do it automatically.

I swear I remember these women having a youtube channel and that one of them died and she was crying really bad and people were making fun of her. I don't really find this shit funny, though. These girls need help. Also, kiwifarms, the name of the uploader, is actually a site that trolls people it finds funny, usually people that are mentally ill in some way, -- much like encyclopedia dramatica back in the day -- so if that's your type of humor, then go check it out. I'm wondering if this twitch is actually one of its user's.
---
I know that but there's no max hit difference mate. The **only** difference for OP's setup would be the 0.83% accuracy boost from using assembler instead.
---
Against Blue: https://i.imgur.com/kI8v4su.png

Against Green: https://i.imgur.com/BGsPOiB.png  this one is &lt;2% accuracy

Hahaha it's funny because it's really easy to get one level it's not even hard xD
---
Next episode is the collab?
---
It's less about quality, than it's about quantity. For example the medium sized soda that you get from McDonald's is still larger than a large in Japan. Not to mention the overuse of salt and sugars in almost everything imaginable. The old food pyramid didn't help things either since it cut down fats for carbs and sugars. That said you can eat all that unhealthy food and still be normal weight, it won't do the same for your overall health though.

The death mechanics were added in the first place because of people ddosing

Gratz on joining the club, I usually just bring an invent of lobsters and still have to drop half of them to pick up loot

Yeah, I made my account on OSRS with my login/information from 2006 about a year ago. 
---
 I've been playing it on and off but am now running into the Invalid Credentials error when using my username to login. This is the first time that's happened.
---
Troll shielding huh?
---
Like 2 seconds a video
---
A good employee would inform their colleagues of things like this, not just quit and leave everything to be up in the air again. Even if he didn't personally care, you'd surely do it just to get a good reference.
---
The one meme where there is an handicapped person finding a way to delete google "chrome" was pretty funny. No need to be so PC all the time, relax.
---
You don't have to worry about those bots, public bots get banned super quick. I garuntee you that the public bots only profit on weekends (hardly any bans then since weather doesn't work and mod tyrant barely works every week). 
---
Only around 5k bots will last weeks/months without a ban. Those are the bots you should be worried about lol.
---
The ones that are banned almost daily make probably a few dollars at most.
---
So yes, while there are a lot of bots, most will be free to play. However, even in members, they get banned pretty fast unless they are using a private bot. 
---
You need not worry about them. Quantity doesn't kill an economy because they always will have low stats. It's the ones with high stats, you should worry about.
---
Why is it 511/512. Wouldnt it be 255/256. Magic dang or bp is probably needed.

Behind the shutters, our life flutters,

Our work batters, our dream shatters,

I know not what I could've done,

To find the things that truly matters.

So to my past, I explore once more,
---
Traverse virtual lands, discover ancient lore,
---
Training mindlessly, to numb the pain,
---
While hoping, one day, perchance...
---
The friends of mine, would come again.
---
Just like how they used to before.
---
Mine for the rest of the year is Link's Awakening, Outer Worlds, and Death Stranding. Cyberpunk is easily number one for next year though.
---
I had all the uniques but the tanz fang and mutegens at around 400kc, it took another 2090 kills for my blow pipe. Grinds like that break a man
---
Is it naive to doubt that the vast majority of the player base buys gold? No, I really don't think it is. I don't even know any current players that I know for certain has bought gold, despite having played OSRS for years at this point. I know plenty of people who used to buy gold back in RS2, but I don't think any of them play any longer, at least not on their old accounts.
---
Could these players still buy gold? Sure they could. Could a majority of them buy gold? Absolutely, although unlikely since at least one of them would be likely to share that information with me since I've literally known them for 3 years at this point. Only a single of them have ever bought gold, but this was by trading it over from his RS3 account. Could he be lying? Well, sure he could. But that's 1 out of about 100 people. How would I not have noticed if more than 3/4 of them have bought gold?
---
You're also forgetting that F2P accounts and ironmen exist. These players don't buy gold.
---
This is a thing?
---
Well the setup I used isn't exactly cheap. It's about 180m
---
Alkan
---
What bot is that
---
That first sentence is actually insane how ridiculous and yet factual it is.
---
Number of accounts =/= number of players. You said it yourself. A ton of these were banned for botting, with the vast majority of them being bot farms with no active player behind them. These are not part of the player base.
---
The rest was adressed in my other comment.
---
I always felt like I was doing a rulers job.
---
I think he meant the drawing looks kinda like an accuracy but idk
---
Great art though!
---
UIM is more impressive to me, because imo HCIM's impressiveness comes from how long they could play without dying to a disconnect rather than any pvm
---
Mtx sucks but the games still fun. I made an ironman over a year ago and almost have a full box set and many other cool gear upgrades. Pvm on the game is fun as fuck despite what people think of EOC. Theres literally thousands of hours of content or more that you can go through

Asking people to upvote is against reddit tos

10/10 for the cursor
---
Those logs are about 3 weeks old fam all post rigour/99 pray

Pros: Actually requires some form of skill

Cons: AI can win every game, so people could just make a bot to do it for them
---
It's similar, depends on your house loading time. If your fairy ring is north of you as soon as you enter and you have a 2t house, the POH should only be slightly slower than quest cape. More convenient since you'll already have house teles/tabs so you can save the slot on bringing a quest cape.
---
That was my impression.  No clue why laughing at obese people for the sole reason that they are obese is ok.

What’s your total superior kc? Just curious I’m still waiting to hit the unique drop table
---
I got one last night! And today me and my duo received 3 arma helms doing gwd... Goodluck on your rings
---
yeah that's what i was thinking, like a salad is cheap and quick, like you could even buy precooked chicken.  
---
The only argument i could see is if you weren't able to justifying buying any fresh products and lived off like tinned preserved food bought cheaply or something.  
---
In which case, yeah, i could see health issues in that being not entirely the fault of the person buying them making bad monetary decisions, more just trying to survive.
---
A piece of the outfit has a drop rate of 1/300. To get an egg you need to get a nest drop from a tree 1/256. That nest may be an egg nest, a clue nest, a dead nest, or a jewelry nest. I’m not sure the drop rate of egg nests. To get a full outfit requires roughly 1200 eggs to sacrifice. Getting 1200 eggs would take forever making this full outfit extremely hard to get.
---
281, i got my first imbued on 17 kc and these 3 are my other ones. i haven't had any other uniques except like 1 staff. i wish you luck though!
---
Or with an Aussie accent. “Nah, get bent mate.”
---
Little more flavorful imo.
---
I think this problem will always be here and that reason is that if GP is in the game that’s how bots will always be here. 99 skills are irrelevant in the game at this point. It’s only the need for GP to buy things to train more. What do you think would happen if the game was complete changed to Ironman mode and no more free trade?
---
i get that uim is impressive and all, but it's basically who can do a task in the most tedious way, a lot of the time.  
---
HCIM wilderness pets is one of the most actually impressive feats in the game.
---
I have had like 4 in 3.5k kc or something. When I get on later I'll post a pic. Stuck at work rn. Totally not in the bathroom on the toilet btw.
---
It obviously is and OP is probably the host himself.  This is the 2nd post about it.  The last one was Singaporeanword, this one is chinaword, twitch is kiwiword.
---
So pretty much what SirPugger just did. He also shows multiple issues of current bots that the creators use to fix.
---
Well I mean completing the quest starts you at level 3! What can be done? The whole channel will be a fraud!
---
my clanmate has almost 200m total xp and currently a 30m bank because she constantly sells everything for skills (99 pray, crafting, construction etc.) just leaves the minimum raids/vork gear. while personally i agree with you i dont sell my gear for skills cuz i like pvm more than skilling but there are people who like skilling more than pvm its not that strange
---
surely root causes would be how you would solve it.  
---
i was just suggesting that saying it takes too long, wasn't really tackling a root cause.
---
It’s okay, believe me I’ve seen it all. Everyone always wants to share their low kc when they see me going dry.

In a sample size of 1000 stakes (or any 50/50 game of chance) losing (or winning) 10 times in a row occurs roughly 30% of the time. It isn’t as bad of luck as you may think. 
---
Over 1000 stakes, one could expect to win close to half of them. However, the distribution of wins/losses doesn’t alternate in a similar manner. In a sample size of only 10 stakes, for example, the odds of losing all 10 are quite low because you’re selecting such a small sample size, but when you look at grander scales, “down swings” and “up swings” can occur at rather large intervals and tend to occur somewhat frequently.
---
Wut.
---
After we pk a few more people to see high intelligent spade posts.
---
I was f2p for many years. I miss those days.
---
Unk and Pd are the clans.  Gf is good fight
---
Ok, go back and read this with sexual innuendos in mind.
---
It’s alright now, you’ve posted about it on reddit. Give it 50-100 more kills and you’ll have all your uniques
---
Just make everyone an ironman. Ez fix
---
1. Do some Pest Control. Get points for full void with atleast 1 helmet for now. Or go full void + all helmets. This will benefit you in the long run for solo PVMing. Like zulrah or vorkath. You'll also have a bit of cash made, not much but every game u win, you get some cash. You'll also get some exp in your fighting style. It can also be a good place to get to know people, and make future PVM partners.
---
2. Start doing some slayer maybe? When you get the appropriate levels, you will surely make alot of cash by just slayer tasking. Also slayer adds in alot of combat exp, which is really good. 
---
3. Starting Recipe for Disaster quest series is also not a bad idea, working slowly towards barrows gloves is one of the goals for PVMing. Not saying finish the quest series once u started it, but just maybe every week try to do one of the required quests for it. And if u like it, more than one. It will pay off.
---
4. You can maybe start training agility more? Get like round goals 35 in a few days and in a week like 45? And so on? Rather now to grind it and get your graceful set than to do this later on. Graceful set is really handy for questing, as it makes u use way less stamina's (in my opinion).
---
5. Starting with mining is a good idea too, get the requirements for Motherlode mining. Its a good way to afk and make a decent stack of money and/or get your ores for blast furnacing later on? Good exp/enough money - afk mining + you get gold nuggets required for diary achievement later on.
---
6. Do the Natural History Quiz, it gives you 9 slayer and hunter levels. Really handy for those first few lvls.
---
7. Start thieving? Get to lvl 38, start thieving the Master Farmer in Draynor Village. Good profit if you hit the expensive seeds. Also a good way to get your starter seeds for starting with farming? Planting Guams for example? Make some potions out of your own Guam herbs and get the herblore up!
---
8. Did you get to do Fairytale Part I? If no, go do that quest and start the second Quest of it too, to unlock fairy rings. Really handy to get you across Gielinor.

I miss the good ol days when you could buy a gf for 500gp .
---
You have no idea how much this helps me. Thank you!
---
I tested it with pretyped and not pre typed to see the difference (and due to my first test being not pre configured).
---
It matches it at best. I truly want to see you getting it faster. As the only potential difference is I'm on my work machine which has slightly less CPU horsepower than my main rig. But it really shouldn't change my house load times.
---
I've matched Ectophial time once, and that was with possibly the worst Ectophial teleport. Remember, this is timing to the Herb patch itself. When you can begin harvesting. It's on the side of Ectophial, so if you're measuring to simply reaching the farming area, ring will be faster by a second max. But Ectophial definitely beats it to the herb patch. A gif proving otherwise would be nice. But my 5 test runs right now make me doubt that's truly possible. And even when it does it's in the &lt;1 second time saving range to have to visit a house and do more clicks. No benefit to non maxed players as it uses same amount of inventory
---
yes its called "regular bellows"
---
Praise Bob
---
you sound like you've never timed it yourself lol
---
for reference an optimized poh from the moment clicking tele to poh to the moment you touch the herb patch is like 22.5 seconds. that's pretty much equal to a perfect ecto spawn and like a second faster than an average ecto spawn. 
---
it's obviously not much but when you also factor in saving an inv slot and better leprechaun placement on the way to the patch (which is something you take advantage of in efficient herb runs for spending as little time noting the herbs) it makes it the best. for the average player though with a normal poh ecto is probably better, but that doesn't change the fact that in terms of most efficient fairy ring is best.
---
I use a quest cape, so that removes any house loading time and spellbook swap delay. I have the elite diary so no dramen staff needed. I've timed it, it is faster. I don't remember by how much I do remember it being a decent amount faster or else I wouldn't do it.
---
Have fun using that Ectophial
---
Just delete your account, mate
---
Ah sorry I'm not measuring to the herb patch. As an iron I do use the allotment patches too, so I was just measuring to the closest patch since the order in which I farm things locally within a farming plot doesn't matter. Definitely it takes extra time to get to the herb patch from the ring side which would make Ectophial better.
---
But I'm measuring just time to get to watermelons/snape grass (I do herbs last). Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
I usually don't play with that mod on Skyrim. Makes everything weird between me and Lydia.
---
Does anybody know if I can reset to Ironman?
---
Quest cape ring is literally the same speed as an optimal house. So that changes nothing except making it use the exact same amount of inventory even if you were maxed.
---
I also don't need dramen staff. I've also tested it literally in the last 30 minutes. It at best matches Ectophial. Either way I wouldn't be luring mobs cos I'm above aggro threshold but I still don't see any benefit to doing it outside of 1 inventory spot thanks to max cape 
---
Have fun talking trash to people who proved you wrong. Go and do some more testing.
---
So I personally do cater to the ring which is why I found it useful. Maybe I got an unlucky Ectophial teleport RNG when I tested it which is why I found ring to be faster. As I explained in the other comment I'm only measuring time to the first patch, not time to specifically the herb patch.

Jagex needs to use Machine Learning to detect bots.  But they won't hire anyone who knows how to good enough.  It's not even hard to detect bots.

I can confirm that this doesn't happen, no head drop on 257. Gonna take a break for a while and come back to it later.

*Edit* do I just say signed?
---
lol!! thats the fight!  thanks for finding, that's pretty awesome that it was uploaded as well
---
This makes me realize that there’s no BIS melee gloves for F2P.
---
Just for completeness of responses I will again mention that I'm not measuring time to herb patch. If you're only measuring time to the nearest patch then ring is faster since you gain those extra 2 seconds back, making it 2 seconds faster (with matching assuming you're going to the herb patch).
---
For regular accounts that are farming herbs for profit, allotments are useless I suppose so you should stick to Ectophial since you specifically want to go to the herb patch. But as an iron I use every single patch (allotments for watermelons/snape grass and flower for limpwurts) in addition to the herb patch, so it doesn't matter which one I arrive at first -- I'm only measuring time to the area (although for Ectophial herb patch is also the first patch in the area). Not sure what the meta is for regular accounts -- do people farm snape grass these days since the XP is good?
---
quality post
---
From the thumbnail I thought the left was a screenshot from AdventureQuest
---
There's a really good cannon spot not marked on runelite in the far northwestern corner of taverly dungeon. I'd suggest checking it out on YouTube. It makes black demons absurdly fast and reasonably AFK.
---
You can check out “Noble Bros”. We do everything from gwd, raids, pking, etc. A variety of players from new to max!
---
lmao this has to be satire. JMods aren't even responsible for customer support. If they help you resolve something here or on twitter its literally out of the goodness of their hearts to help their players.
---
They did shut it down?
---
It was removed in this week's update....
---
Ahhh that explains it then! Yep it's definitely faster to the first harvestable patch. Makes more sense there. I was talking purely on herb runs, as a main Normie account I don't bother with allotments because the XP doesn't really justify time spent.
---
11m xp since superior update, 400kc nothing but staves.
---
Did he just Sudoku?
---
Oof I'm at like 950kc 
---
2 claws 
---
3 leathers
---
And pet. Also I did all those kills on release
---
Yep time to the west allotment patch would definitely be competitive or faster than time to herb patch. As a person doing just herbs, ecto continues its reign! ;)
---
If you don't put a space after the arrow it looks a lot better cuz Reddit formatting
---
Without the formatting it really just looks like a wall of text and the arrows don't really help seperate it
---
Yikes
---
Yeh precisely correct. Sorry for the confusion and I've undone any negative votes I gave. I thought you were talking specifically herbs.
---
As for mains, doing Snape grass is definitely worthwhile to speed up levelling if you're doing herb runs anyway. But as post-99 I don't really care. Fruit trees and big patches will get me to 200m well before I'm done any other skills, and the pet chance on allotments is horrible, and profit not really worth bothering about.
---
if you ever feel useless just remember red spice exists
---
Fucking scary that it was connected with the release of a widescale bonus XP event shortly after.
---
Let's get a 7th piece of graceful for that then. How bout a graceful scarf?
---
We used to all hate updates. It was a different time. We voted no to almost EVERYthing. Anything that wasn't the whip was dead Content. Anything that was better then the whip was too op. 
---
I remember at one point the staff of the dead was actually the best str training weapon in the game, and was commonly used during Slayer.
---
I tested it with a timer. The confusion was that the original comments were talking about time to any patch. Which ring would be slightly faster to allotment..I'm talking time to herbs, where Ectophial wins.
---
So sure I didn't screen record my work computer and send you a YouTube video of the testing. But I've told you you're welcome to go and test it, I've done the timing just now and it proved what I thought. You obviously haven't and/or are talking specifically about allotments as well without specifying that.

that order is decent, but I can see you having you deviate to less than optimal leps as a result of using ecto. like after lumby you either have to run back to the lep at that patch or run to the ardy lep twice, which costs a few seconds that with a better order you wouldn't even touch the ardy lep and only touch the lumby one on the way to the patch. but ya it's just a few seconds here and there but it adds up when it's something you're doing thousands of times.

I have to myself. I've timed it. You can do the same. I'm not about to screen record my work computer to prove something so easily tested. Ectophial wins to herb patches, which is what I do and what I was timing. The misconception with the main comment was he was referring to any patch, due to being an iron. I don't do allots or flowers, and therefore ring is slower. If you do, go for it. I'll stick to ecto being faster for my runs, which I've tested it as being. You can stay in denial with no testing if you are doing herb runs. Doesn't bother me.

You can afk gargs for 2 mins no problem (or loot disappears) these can combo you out in 3 hits.
---
Gz on unban and reward but it's actually awful that your competing was largely in part to seek jmod attention, really glad it worked out but it's lousy that it has to be like that sometimes
---
Looks like Will Smith's makeup is rubbing off.

loot from 10000 collective bot hours ft. 1000 bots

loot: all accounts swipe banned

What's your estimate for the percentage? That's much better because you then wouldn't go all over the place with anywhere from about half to almost everyone.
---
It's only 5-8% 
---
These are official numbers from jagex
---
Y'know the ppl who actually know the numbers
---
in all seriousness, this is a trap you fall into quite easily at this point.
---
You don't know what to do, but you're bored. But you can't decide on what to do because it all sounds boring.
---
Just pick a thing, whatever it is, and go fuck it let's go do it.
---
Kill the giant mole. Go do a barrows run. Do a quest. Once you've actually started doing something it'll snowball. 
---
The same thing happens in eve online. You end up ship spinning then logging off, bored.
---
 If you just undock, even if you don't initially enjoy it you're at least doing something. It can be hard to start, but then eventually you'll find it's harder to stop :P
---
Haha good post! Big fun when say make rune bad x)
---
Lmfao yes
---
F2p has a huge portion because of how easy it is to just make a new account and have it start farming
---
It's def more than 5k, but without f2p I wonder
---
First priority should be to go questing to get those Barrows Gloves. Not only are they incredible, but you'll gain some great xp, teleports, and useful items along the way from other quests.
---
As far as money makers? If you're so combat heavy, I'd suggest Slayer, but that really doesn't start being good until the mid/late 60s. That said...cannoning is worth it. I know it hurts. I've been there, too...but Dagganoths, Kalphites, and a few other tasks will be worth it. Consider it a down-payment on getting to better money makers (Gargoyles, Nechryeals, Abby Spectres, etc.).
---
You should also do your dailies. Completing Easy and Medium Diaries gives you access to some super fast money every day. Battlestaves, Bow Strings, and Dynamite (Varrock, Kandarin, and Kourend, respectively) are earning me 170k every day, and it takes about 40 seconds total to do all of them. I have the Hard Diaries done, but the Medium rewards are about half that, so if you would like to make 85k in 40 seconds, once a day... ;)
---
Herb runs and birdhouse runs are stellar ways to efficiently earn some gp, and they can also be a nice break from whatever you're doing, so it doesn't get too monotonous. They're VERY easy, but can seem intimidating, so just look up a video guide on how to get started. Getting started is the hardest part!
---
Good luck!
---
No you'll need to make a new account. However, I believe you can go from iron Man to a normal account but I might be wrong
---
I didn't mention anything about the skill required, just that the plugin tells you what to do.
---
I don't think it's bad game design. I don't use plugins or anything and the only time I even thought about where to click was when people using overlays were complaining about not having them on mobile. It's really not that difficult to click the agility spots.
---
Yeh I often actually do ardy as my 3rd patch, and lummy after ecto. As that way I can utilise lummy lep on the way through and lummy to cath uses a no tick loss lep. 
---
The reason I slightly altered it is on the move to ardy Lep I do my spellbook swap, which you have to wait for anyway, so there's no time loss there. It's only two patches that create any tick loss. Ice troll is 2 ticks, and ardy is about 2-3. But I've not really seen a better way to organise them as you always have to lose out on a patch somewhere. There's not enough patches with leps on the way to the patch or 0 tick loss spaces away to be able to spread amongst the run.
---
How long is that on average?
