Somebody probably has your name on either osrs or rs3

You're not crazy but yeahh ign's don't share across osrs and rs3. Gotta make the name twice and hope it's not taken

Atleast you managed to upgrade your dragon dagger to a dragon longsword

Here's what I don't get. The Vampires of Morytania keep humans under control as they are their food source. We "sneak" people out via Temple Trek, and sneak in new resistance fighters and supplies. It's like the old iron curtain. And yet......we the player can come and go as we please, teleport in and out, even just take a charter ship. Instead of temple Trekking, wouldn't it be safer/faster to just bring in a bunch of teleport tabs and hand them out like candy?

Doesn't Anakin try to jump over obi and get cut in half? And also obi kills maul from below too....maybe the high ground thing is all a a hoax

No, there are items that increase magic damage such as an Occult necklace, Mage Arena cape (i), Tormented bracelet, and Ancestral robes, but most magic gear only affects your accuracy.
---
yes but it only has one dose and there's zero difference between using superantipoison and regular at zulrah

I remember sitting with my older brother watching him do quests around 2009. In particular he waited for me before doing Shadow of the Storm and the Zanik quest line up to The Chosen Commander(my all time favorite quest).
---
I did Underground Pass and got into the Elven Lands, but didn't know anything about the other Elven quests and just wandered around Tirranwn getting blasted by traps and lost in the forest. I spent a lot of time doing Dungeoneering and Stealing Creation/Fist of Guthix too, listening to a playlist of Parry Gripp songs and older pop songs like Tonight Tonight and DJ Got Us Falling In Love.
---
I remember reading the wiki pages on Zaros and Guthix and the Mahjarrat and watching tehnoobshow videos, back before we really knew a huge amount about them.

Be careful or you'll be down voted into the lava like me.

Not true, at all. The data is already spoofed, and if they banned 3rd party clients, they'd just change it up a bit so it 100% mimics the osrs client. Then, you'd not be able to tell a difference from the official client and a bot client. They currently don't do it as aggressively, cause it doesn't matter.

Please post ASAP, I’m very curious!

Somewhere in the depths of the underground pass perhaps
---
It would be in some quest area, maybe the cave during the legends quest
---
These hubs existed when we had to choose between like a hundred banks before the GE, and would happen with many more GE's.
---
Also restricting it to a single GE for the 10 people in the game that still do non-GE trading is silly.
---
How do you balance both.
---
I play LoL and RS but never at the same time.
---
I’ll always play RS for a few months straight and completely ignore LoL, then vice versa for a few months.

For solo play I believe it's used for melee Vork kills, and sometimes also if you're really bad at Zulrah and for some reason can't spare the apm/inventory space to use anti-venom+

---
You're not wrong there. If your password is long enough (with just lowercase letters and numbers) it would take a very long time to brute force it. 
---
P.S. Most of the bruteforcing is done via database leaks, it all depends on your password. If it's long enough, even if a db got leaked, they wouldn't be able to brute force it (unless the database didn't hash and salt the passwords). 
---
Passwords are cracked by using rainbow tables, how they work is you just get the hash, you find the algorithm of the hash and then hash every single password in whatever dictionary you have, and then check to see if it matches the desired hash. If it does, then that's the password.  
---
I've never, ever been hacked in my entire life and that's because I don't have a basic password. 
---
Although, it still wouldn't matter since most of the accounts that get hacked, is from phishing sites. People still far for it in 2019.
---
They'd have a higher chance of reducing hacks, if they could solve the phishing problem.
---
Isnt vestment robes even better then?
---
I'm not saying it's a good or bad idea, just that that's my point; it's a hub. Just like you said, the hubs existed before GE. But each area had its own thing. Varrock Bank for general trads, Seers bank for fletching type shit, yada yada.
---
I feel like my comment was worded poorly in that I was saying "Don't add more GEs because it's only bad!" I meant more why banks was a bad example to compare to GEs.
---
West Ardy and Lletya teleport may shave some time off there, though it is really lonely there.
---
So if your account with thousands of hours got banned tommorow and the reason they gave you was ‘fuck you no reason’ you would be perfectly okay with that because you agreed to the TOS? Just because it’s they are legally allowed to do something doesn’t mean it’s morally correct.
---
I played during the transition between the UIs, and more fondly remember this layout. But I much prefer the 07 tabs for aesthetic purposes.

Legends Quest cave is a bit of a pain in the ass to get to during clues. While Shilo Village is pretty close, this one might be it.

Fremmennik Trails and Isles will unlock the Helm of Neitiznot
---
Lunar diplomacy will give you access to the Lunar spellbook, with Dream Mentor unlocking more spells afterwards.
---
Desert Treasure unlocks the Ancient spellbook.
---
Underground Pass gives you the Iban's Staff and the related Magic spell. It'll also grant you access to the Elven lands and the rest of the Elven questline. 
---
I'm assuming you've already done Lost City and Monkey Madness, but these would allow you to wield the Dragon Dagger and Dragon Scimitar respectively.
---
And generally any step towards Barrows Gloves is worth it.
---
everything
---
Terrible health bar.
---
What about quest NPCs that give me items?
---
I’d buy it

great, and now i'm horny. thanks a lot r/2007scape

But with this you can't use the rest of the keyboard. And you could just bind the number keys to your f keys. 
---
Not knocking the set up, I have used a similar one in the past.
---
Have you done the easy Kourend diary? That should significantly speed up your talisman hunt since it changes the droprate to 1/125 from 1/250.
---
Assuming you haven't done the diary, though, there's still a 6% chance you wouldn't have gotten a talisman by now which isn't completely unheard of.
---
Master wand can autocast too, people only prefer kodai because of infinite water runes, which makes it slightly more convenient (and ofc kodai is more accurate too which is nice but doesn't really matter at nechs/dusts). It's like how people used to use master wand + tome of frost back in RS2.
---
I do. But that’s not always the best option. I’d rather not drag my mouse all the way across the screen in a PvP situation if my opponent moves. I middle mouse button in general, but it’s nice to have the keys for backup.

If you haven't seen Hunter x Hunter, it's made by the same dude who made YYH. I think a lot of it is on netflix as well.

If you’re going for 70 prayer, I highly recommend the wilderness altar. I used to do ectofuntus until I realized wildy altar is 13k exp each dragon bone load. Use the burning amulet to lava maze and run west. Go late at night or early in the morning when less people are on if if you’re worried about dying. Most people are looking for mains with noted d bones rather than an iron with only one inv

Ah, so would the timer reset (i.e. I half TBed someone, but then once they switch to protect melee or range someone else fulls them and they can't tele for the full duration) or you can just override someone else's TB and it'll keep the same time?

I dont see factorio with Rs
---
I would have blocked this person like 2 messages in, totally not worth the effort typing back to them.
---
correct. Jagex requested it as such because having those tools open to the public could, according to them, be used to create bots, which is a nono.
---
Ye but honestly I still feel it's pretty PK-heavy and if you're not careful you can get lured into multi there. Wouldn't recommend without higher stats because honestly dragon pickaxe isn't that useful for anything besides Olm at CoX. When I'm 3-ticking sandstone/iron, rune pickaxe is the same as dragon pickaxe. The only place where it's better is something like MLM/Blast Mine where you're AFKing, so the faster tick speed helps. 
---
I'll get a dragon pickaxe once I'm geared up for Raids probably.

This is the reason I quit. Handed him a full mithril set and he logged.

Damn, i did alch with numpad before but never thought about this. Any webpage where i can look this up? And is there a way to swap f-keys just with the horizontal numbers and leave numpad as is? Or does it not seperate those bindings from each other? That would be so awesome tbh.

I knew this was coming.

😁😁😁
---
I'm staying neutral but the one note I will add is:
---
Just because there are rules and the makers *say* they make them themselves, means absolutely fucking nothing.
---
“Uhh hehe Eddy, I don’t think scamming other players for their hard earned coin is a good idea. Player Moderators take that stuff very seriously ya know!”

“Shut up Double D, this is our best idea yet! All it takes is one sucker to give me his GP after I wow him with my awesome armor and the jawbreakers are all ours!!!”
---
My life is a lie. I was always told it's bad for it, and I blamed myself for the old Dell family PC shitting itself and slowing so far down because I forced shut down the PC easily hundreds of times when I thought I heard someone walking down the stairs.

I think the real issue is the fact that it's a Dell, and they were so shit.

By bulk I assume it means 50 of the same? Not like 1x 50 different designs

It’s such a bummer that it didn’t populate these lists from stuff you got before it was released, I understand how they couldn’t have done anything about it but it would have made the collection log so much better

That’s my best guess. Unless they ban people for trash talk whilst pking.

Unless you already had it, it 100% is

Everyone probably recommends mining in members because they have f2p bots themselves and love to have their goldfarming machines running in free. 
---
Seriously! Don't recommend someone with 15 mining to get members! Won't get new players into the game at all seeing how broken it is.

I'd say get some decent defence level and go to the dwarven mine east of Falador party room. The king scorpions there keep the bots in check most of the time.

Jagex need to get rid of this.

You can get there without the agility req. just takes longer

don't think you can do those for the diary task

I guess that wasn't the right word. They knew what they were paying for.

Meh, i watch quick guides (which do spam click) and just read at my own pace. Ain't no rush

I suggest that jagex sends someone to break your kneecaps If you dont have authenticator
---
I cant even count the amount of hours i was there, i think i finished 4 seasons of Lucifer, all of GoT and a over 10 movies and also played some Hearthstone. Not sure if its worth grinding it out but i was omega afk so you can do it much faster than i did
---
It is, you get logged out but then you can just log back in immediately after.

Thanks! :)

Hell yea it was a recent update that made it f2p makes smithing way better than al kharid.

Great, thanks for letting me know :) I'll look into the agility req

Of course! my bad

This show pissed me off, they would never come out on top. I love it, but dammit I want them to succeed.

Ofc it's on private, otherwise you get spammed by bots. It's not even just an ironman problem, just worse of one. Loads of normies solo Sara for cash
---
Wut? I always thought it was a octopus. Why would you eat an urchin?
---
If you specifically go out of your way to make an account that sacrifices defense for offense so that you'll have an edge in PVP and then complain when someone you're trying to PK is wearing armor, you are the ultimate brainlet.
---
Fetching arrows lmao
---
I'm implying it's the same grindy content as most of the game.
---
Stupid question but whats 35 runecrafting for?
---
You’re the only one taking about woodcutting though. I’m talking about skilling in general. Anyone can get a blowpipe drop from zulrah. It’s nothing compared to a 100m raid drop or a hydra claw etc etc.
---
I learn something new today thanks
---
Yeah I mean I've gotten crashed plenty of times at bandos &amp; arma, but then I started using the 2k worlds and never had an issue. Can't really escape it if they max total accounts camping sara crashing every world. Whatever, it's toxic but there's no point in dwelling on it
---
Little tip. You don't need to see his legs, turn game sounds on and you can predict his attack without looking.
---
When I was a kid I made a friend on runescape that ending up coming over and playing with me. He was fighting chaos druids with some dragon weapon, a dragon dagger or scimitar probably. I had been in members for months and had never even seen a special attack bar, I was so amazed lol. Most of my time back then was spent waiting for good shit to drop in the falador drop party room
---
Where can I buy some? I’m going to a festival soon and want one for a hat so I could possibly meet fellow scapers
---
Jeez ill give you 8pairs of boots for my first tassys, or hilt, currently sitting at 8boots, 2 bcp, 0 tassys and hilts
---
Dude at 1:12. What the fuck outfit is that? Like I know the armour but where would you ever use all that with only a d scim? And holy sandals? Is that an ironman flexing at the ge or something? I'm pretty confused
---
Well yes it is now, but at the time it wasn't against the rules yet.  It was made against the rules eventually though
---
I'll buy if for 1m and a cake.
---
??????? how does that help? no matter what it'd take 1 extra inv space... use your head
---
i'd vote yes to summoning and dungeoneering don't @ me
---
Made from scratch? Bruh you're just resizing an imagine that A JAGEX ARTIST MADE and selling it for mad profit.

almost like jagex cant do anything about it
---
Slayer is always an option. Get them gargs
---
^(quit while you are ahead)
---
No only when using pray and attacking monsters with low magic levels
---
This happes way too often
---
I use troll stronghold and Catherby for herb runs and then kourend for the third one, teleports you right to the catacombs entrance. 
---
For slayer tasks with prayer in the catacombs, I sometimes home tele, Dragon battle axe spec for strength boost, drink from pool, then throw on piety and spec a combat dummy with an ancient mace to boost my prayer over level, then hop in the kourend portal for a quick trip.

Did it on my on my Ironman with a crystal bow at 72 range first try...the biggest tip anyone can give you is to calm yourself as much as possible during the jad fight. I personally think people being nerve racked is a big reason to people losing the battle

My main goal is to get all pets and this is info is breaking my spirit lol I thought boss pets were hard to get .... oof

i dont like the helm shape

I got membership like two weeks after the trade limit was added... Kind of disappointing
---
What do u win tho
---
The pheasants don't give any xp
---
Right lol. I dont either. Im almost 97 str and 97 hp tho my 2 highest stats. Followed by 93 slay. 
---
Like 200m all i understand, but in one stat Jesus. Unless op was just going for pet and this was the first time getting it? If so thats fucking crazzzy. Idk. Dont get me wrong there are games I'll play for a bit of time and come back to them, but i also like playing variety too. I could never sit and play just one game THAT much. 
---
To each his own - im not hating in any way lol. So dont take it the wrong way to anyone who goes for 200m exp, or stuff like grid locked slow leveling stuff. I would just get insanely bored, and it doesnt do anything for the account either haha. 
---
Anyway sorry for all that, just think its interesting what some people choose to do. Again - to each his own and theres no prob with that!

If someone ever says “hey bring all your shit here” your best bet is to not do that at all.

I really need to do something like this and stick with it. I need about 10m.

My uncle was max combat and payed for me and my brother's membership, even though we had no idea what we were doing and I just mostly played castle wars. Ahh the good old days of having to take turns every 20 minutes on the one PC we had in our house.
---
My dad installed a program when I was young that shut off internet on my computer after a certain time. It was somewhat early so he often deactivated it temporarily if I asked him (on weekends or summer or whenever). So I hatched a brilliant plan and installed a keylogger (for personal use, not the malicious kind) and asked him to deactivate it one evening. He did and I got the password and uninstalled that shit. He never even realized as far as I know.
---
On the flip side, at 26 I came back and started playing again. Can’t remember why, but for some reason it came up in conversation with my mom. Told her I was playing RuneScape again and she said, “that stupid computer game you and your brother made me pay for that you used to play at the library?!” 
---
“Yeah mom, and I’m totally way better at it now I might finish something for the first time in my life”

dedicated shitting time when? if I can't shit on a toilet IRL while smithing then why can't I in the game instead?
---
Do you need the hidden track on tutorial island?
---
Not sure which item upgrades to get next. I currently have Ahrims, karils, bgs, trident, blowpipe, berserker ring, occult, mages book, serp helm and guthans. Should I save some money and go for bigger items like tassets, sgs etc. or maybe sets some of my stuff? My current goals is just slayer and general bossing.
---
First thing I did was entering Taverly gates with music on, going to Camelot and buying G Maul then Tyras helm from Catherby General store. Even to this day "Horizon" tune brings up lot of wonderful memories.
---
I ran to the post box near my school before mum would pick me up, had 15$ I think and addressed to jagex, this was when that was an option, but I don't think I used a stamp and I never got my membership..
---
Get a max Cape :^)
---
Yeah mate mine was 2.2k got a 144hz monitor 16gb ram 2tb ssd. And it just runs osrs all day. It probably likes it's easy life.
---
It takes around 3-4 hours of actual playtime
---
Still there?
---
Ok so straight up I don't understand why you even need to randomise chunk completion order. I don't think picking which chunk to do would take away anything from the series, it doesn't detract from the premise and if anything, planning your route could be quite interesting.
---
You’ll really want like base 85 stats before trying most bosses. Unless you have a high level friend carrying you, it will be hard for you to dps almost any actual boss aside from Obor or Bryophyta. 
---
You could do crazy archeologist and chaos fnatic but they are both in the wilderness so it’s a risk.
---
:*
---
probably zenytes, you could even sell some stuff for them since they're massive upgrades
---
Seriously I just take inventory of sharks on most Slayer tasks. Thought that is what most people do.
---
Ahrims is a tiny, tiny dps upgrade over vestements or proselyte, but the prayer saved by prayer gear is more than worth it.
---
If you have ancestral you should use that though
---
To do Sara... what's sara in this context?
---
Someone tried something similiar to me too lol. Just don't ever take out your expensive shit from the bank and you'll be fine
---
Sorry, I wasn't specifically talking about you in that comment. But you do make some vague statements. 
---
The reason the 284 or 283.5 doesn't matter, is because /u/springstof was never talking about how rare it is. Rather, he was talking about _how many_ clues you could do while having the same odds as others (and the answer is that the number could be anything). But honestly, he explained it better than i ever could, so I won't bother typing it out again. This entire discussion feels more like a miscommunication than a disagreement anyway.

Jagex doesn't reset accounts. It sounds like you're logging in on the wrong account. Are you using the **registered email** to login? If so, that is wrong. You need to login in with the **login email** (or **login username** if created before 2010).

Because for every 3 shots you do with rcb you'll shoot 5 times with msb. 67% increased damage from attack speed is a big deal

What's a goal you have in mind?

Yeee someone else said it I was just agreeing lol. No shame my dude I appreciate the advice. I have some Nike’s, converse, and some vans also but I just don’t wear the same things all that often.

because they're missing a lot of still huge but old games. it seems like a very "snapshot" kinda view of it all.

somewhere in the bottom of that void is old generation MMO's, EQ and FFXI and that sort.
---
90 magic. 90 str. And go smack raids. Of course. Slayer is #1. Make sure you got the untradeables, firecape or inferno, void, ma2 capes etc. If ds2 isn't done...def get the reqs and smack it out. Along with mm2. To burst that magic. It will take legit a day for 90 or less than a day. Get a trident, imbuned heart etc.
---
Gwd.
---
Honestly why go through the effort of alching them when you can just quick sell them, it's like a 5k difference if you sell 10 of them
---
Gain 5% def buff in the cold
---
twitch prime is great isnt it
---
At that point the alch isn't even profitable anymore
---
upvoted for YYH
---
Rune dragons are literally the most used alt they're pretty afk
---
Which is why I don’t think it’s a grand conspiracy that he left that information out.  Either this is a brain dead policy, even by Jagex standards, or he legitimately should not have mentioned it as it is irrelevant.
---
Is it really used at sara anymore? I know you can get pretty long trips with it without flicking but t bow just completely blows chins out of the water in terms of dps
---
just here to read your results

Pretty sure it's only for beginner clues.

Yeah, but what looks more bad ass, Adams or Prostate¿? Dont mix n match tho, dont wanna be caught seen in Adams Prostate.

I started playing long before mobile and I still didn't know that leprechaun can note items nor that you can pay farmers to cut down your tree

Who looks at items on the ground? You obviously use runelite ground items plugin
---
That last sentence you typed, sums it all up. Nice way with words you have!
---
Well i wouldn't say i deserve to loose hundreds of hours of progress over a chargeback that was done in Jan. The manual ban didnt note anything. Nothing at all. Which is why im confused.
---
No. but is is close to a re-post of a similar post i put on a different community. I edited it a bit to sound less "entitled"  and put it here as one of the people who commented on it said that this was a more appropriate place to post it.

Oooh yes. Remember the huge competition over birds on the release day? Even the desert was swarmed.

Looks there to me man

Yes,[ confirmed by Mod Ash.](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1010426536305070082)
---
Summoning was kinda dumb.
---
I remember that having enough summoning for stuff like yak, war turtle or terror bird was almost required for efficient bossing. They essentially acted as bonus inventory space.
---
Except I didn't, if you posted this, it was a coincidence. I saw this come up on my farm run, lol'd at the name, took a screenshot and made this post myself.
---
&gt; It will help to fuck with bots.

The irony, they were removed because they didn't do that

Its 100% more profitable than leaving stuff on the ground while slaying

Pre bp it's probably msb (i) with rune arrows &gt; k crossbow &gt; crystal bow &gt; rune crossbow with broads.

That's true, but I'm somewhat hesitant to use RS3 as it has a lot of power creep in what the Adventurer is capable of, extending to actually killing Lord Drakan himself (though again with the help of Vanescula). It sort of throws a wrench into the concept that the vampyres could annihilate you if they cared.
---
Wait, now he can high alch it for free with the ring
---
Well obviously lmao, u/SaladFury was talking about banking his drops as opposed to alching them.

I sometimes like to Sgs mid-kill, especially to kill Core (not using cannon). Heals up, gives more prayer = less 1tick flicking required. Definitely not needed though, just a tad more AFK

Two people thought of the same meme in a close time frame. Nothing ever happens!

1 Corp kill takes on average about 15 minutes, meaning its 4 kills/h.

Im not sure if it can be considered mid level. But i think it have a really damn good reward ( acess to proselyte armour ).

Maybe you have too low mage and range? Or your gear is trash.

Yes, when you are in the lobby of the raid. You go in, check the map (or a client does it automatically). Then if it's good other people come in and join and you start the raid, otherwise you leave and try again.

At first I thought it was a subtle joke that Benny (the newspaper NPC) is part of the Phoenix Gang. But the guy you bribe to find out the location of the Phoenix HQ is actually the [close-by fur trader, Baraek](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Baraek).

Lmao do that so they might tele to go bank/insure it, then it's your world.

It's all tongue in cheek, calling people really skilled for being lucky is a really common joke but I guess people didn't like it

What's the deal with the traders that always have 0 of some items in stock? Why are they even listed if they're never stocked? e.g. Brutal arrows at uglug nar

By the time you're facing Drakan you're World Guardian, not only that but an entire hour plus long quest is spent with the player character and Myreque COMPLETELY helpless to drakan, captured and on the run the entire time, it establishes him REALLY well.
---
Drakan is a worthy villain, the quest line like 7 quests long, it has high requirements, and the fight is mechanically challenging.
---
The kill ends up earned in a lore sense AND in a mechanical one, and even after all of that there's another quest in which the Vampyres under Vanescula are still a problem.
---
That’s all you needed back in the day. Log in, kill 4 moss giants and log out with excitement
---
Bots run away, instead it just killed normal players who got upset.
---
Well, what's even crazier is if you look @ a lot of Oskars friends/fans on Twitter, most of them play RS &amp; are very fit. I doubt most of them could do 11 hours a day + hit the gym that much.

Well one run would take anywhere from 20-40 minutes with a group of people that actually intend to kill the queen. I suggest finding a group, maybe ask in CCs rather than trying to play with randoms as 9/10 times somebody will leave. Also go attacker or collector, it's pretty braindead compared to other roles.

You continued your trip after getting the pet? You're a fucking mad lad if I've ever seen one.

Thank you for motivation. I played RS a lot on and off from 2003 to about 2009/10, had membership mostly, almost all levels maxed out, but unfortunately I forgot username and password so I had to start over now. I'm planning to be f2p for at least a while.

It's almost like zero effort, zero skill, zero quest and zero equipment activities should give less rewards.

Please tell me more about how afking for 3 minutes at a time at anglers should be as rewarding as high level PVM.

no
---
The easier something is to bot, the less it's going to be worth. Only better bot detection systems (or decreasing RWT) will do that. For ironmen most gathering skills are somewhat worth it though!
---
Yeah, Jagex. Just press the button already!!
---
Kidding aside, they ban in waves so as not to alert the botters what triggered the ban.

I had diary cape way before music cape somehow. But yeah same I had it until mimic came out and haven’t been able to get one yet ejther

I meant Castle Wars my bad. I get them confused still when looking at the Ring of Wealth teleport options. I will click Clan Wars thinking it's Castle Wars. I've never actually played Clan Wars. I was playing Castle Wars. You caught my mistake and it's my own fault. I keep mistaking them because of the C and Wars, plus I have horrid eyesight. Thank you for correcting me.

Besides pking, is heavy ballista useful for anything?

CoX is definitely pretty easy once you understand olm. Depending on your competence as a PVMer and how quickly you learn you can easily pick it up in a kc or two.good luck on the grind man.
---
Regular players camp zulrah, so do bots and gold farmers. Blowpipe isn't that rare from it so alot in the game. Most players already have one also, prices gonna drop bc more are entering the game than the amount of players buying there first blowpipe.
---
Y'all I greatly enjoyed arcanists but even if it got 50k sales that's 450k (generously) to Jagex that would start immediately going into uptime and support.
---
This will never happen.
---
It's shit comedy for a garbage common denominator. Go through his profile and see what people actually enjoy. His Savage Robot bullshit got tiring after the 3rd video and only a particular subset of autists like you enjoy it.
---
The point is that this guy wears a setup as expensive as BiS while it's much weaker. What does that setup cost? 150m? I could make a better setup for 10m. That setup would never be called out because it's just a standard budget gear.
---
Suboptimal budget gears are "cute noobs" gear. Suboptimal expensive gears are "mum's credit card" gear. The twitter picture is the latter.

In 3d modelling the area between 3 vertex's is called a triangle.
---
In games a way to save processing power is to only render the visible side of triangles (imagine rendering a cube, you can't see the inside so why render it). Called "backfacing".
---
So to determine what side is inside and outside every triangle has a perpendicular line called a "normal" that determines inside and outside.
---
Flipping the normals of a triangle would effectively turn it invisible (instead of only rendering the outside of the cube you now only render the inside).
---
Hope my scuffed explanation helped a little.
---
tl:dr 
---
"Normal" make triangle face wrong way this becoming see through.
---
Mathematically speaking. What would my combat look like compared to someone with 45 def? I'm thinking max 1 combat higher

Wtf do you mean only I've been taken down? Are you seriously sit there and pretend I'm the only person who's even been hacked on Runescape now? Jesus fucking christ lmao. I've literally just spent the past hour reading dozens of stories just like this, people who've quit because they randomly lost their accounts after using OS Mobile, even with authenticator active, with a PIN, nothing matters.
---
And you tell me to calm down, that I won't get any help. Some fucking help you are.
---
Doing the math to get to 60k is actually pretty easy. All you need to do is know that you need to make up for those 8 hours lost with 2k additional xp. So essentially, (8*62,000)/2000, or 248 hours. 
---
And this formula will work for you to get back to any number. Basically:
---
(Hours missed*(xp/hr))/((xp/hr)-new avg)
---
So, let's say you wanted to get back to an average of 61,950 you would do:
---
(8*62000)/(62000-61950), or 9920 hours. By which point you should be well above 200m xp anyways.
---
The runescape community has always been elitist. Even back in the day

Maybe try and ironman mode a lot of people found their love for the game came back when they had to play the game in a whole new way and gather the resources and things themselves. Also makes the reward of getting say a barrows or Gwd item that much more satisfying. Hope you find your joy for runescape again I know how it feels to get burnt out.
---
Are you even listening to me? Lol
---
Go for untrimmed slayer cape!
---
I've done glitches with them in the past. I'm a decent bug abuser in my own right.
---
I've found many cft's, pafts, etc.. myself
---
I'm not trying to be something I'm not. Bug abuse is my hobby and has been for over 10 years now lol
---
Lol, 6 different previous account names, proof of me getting the Twitch Prime free trial in November and the email verifying it, proof of me buying fucking membership just a month ago on Paypal, none of that matters? None of that can get my account unlocked? Are you fucking serious right now?
---
I told them it's a training program for real life work ethics and efficiency standards.
---
Great video. Love your content. I really was hoping for animated wink and sparkle with a ding sound at the end.
---
I remember getting bored of runescape after playing for two years as a kid and told my dad to cancel my membership and he told me "It's only $5 why?" 
---
I miss those days.
---
We do raids discord
---
It depends on what your stats are if you're low to med level you could try killing Blue or green dragons or maybe mix it up with some skilling catching sharks cutting magics or doing some slayer.

Bots increase your gp/hour if you have herb sack, since they dont pick up ranarr

Yes, that’s why i asked a question

Maybe try and use it as an alt for your main you've already started mining so maybe you could use it as a motherload mine alt train it upto 72 and just ask on the top tier level

A bit too high of a cmb I think too bad :(
---
So would my normal ancient pl8 body, dlegs, and dmed helm be a good idea even though im going mage and range?
---
less xp p/hr as well tho
---
How would an emote make the cape non-cosmetic
---
Haha normie that was merely intentional R/wosh yet again
---
Cheers dude, deffo considering this !
---
Do it on an alt
---
Oh damn...
---
Ironman has made me addicted to the game again.
---
I got burnt around 1700 total on my main, not because the grind were excessively long, but because I felt like it was all about what’s most efficient.
---
Why do DK’s if you can just farm Zulrah/Vork? Obviously, you can still play the game how you want. But actually having a reason to do content is far more rewarding. 
---
My main felt like
---
- Grind Boss for X hours to buy the items necessary to kill the bosses that drop those items.
---
I saw it was #1 on Miniclip's most popular list for the longest time and when I found out a few friends played it I tried it out. My neighbor came over and helped me through tutorial island
---
I'll just keep using chrome remote desktop, mobile is ass for everything.
---
Thanks man!
---
Gen III was the best gen imo.
---
Me wanting RuneScape membership taught me some basic life skills when I was little. For instance, one time my parents said they’d buy me membership, but first I had to learn to tie my shoes. Good times.

Lmao you're fucking delusional. I shouldn't have to encrypt my fucking Runescape account like a god damn nuclear launch code. The fucking authenticator should do it's fucking job.
---
I think its because hes wearing a range amulet :P
---
Yes, the Barrows brothers that you use magic for have a negative magic defense, so as long as you stay above -65 magic attack you'll be able to hit normally. Magic strength still does play a role in it, so using an occult will potentially boosts your max hit.
---
That's great for when you're maging but I'd recommend bringing at least d'hide top and bottoms to switch into for when you range.
---
Some people dont want to use it. Go in a total level world and have peace
---
Why do you think that would never pass a poll? And why would it be nice - just for aesthetics?
---
Do they use student email account to create amazon account, claim free prime, claim free twitch prime, get free p2p on bot, change the email alias, and repeat? I used to do that to get unlimited prime for my own use, but I can imagine that could be abused.

So is spending hundreds/thousands of hours clicking on a screen and being rewarded with make believe pixels. What's your point?

It is funny because this guy clearly doesnt know what hes doing, not because he has shit gear... its like watching a baby try to do an adult thing and fucking it up. Its not a negative things, its "cute"
---
Isn’t this the rarest way to get a DFH?
---
Yep. People romanticise this kind of trading but in practice everyone got sick of it pretty quick and moved to zybez, then voted in the trading post and finally the GE. 
---
Personally I preferred the trading post, being able to see individual offers rather than them all being invisibly stacked together in the ge was nice. Easier to play the market when you can see exactly what people are trading for
---
I pray to Bandos that such a thing is never brought to OSRS.

Kill it with fire. Jk, make an alt. Rune dragon, brutal black, gargoyle or maybe a skiller.
---
if someone has access to your email the authenticator is useless since it can be disabled (for if you get a new phone) which is why it is so important to have a secure unique email for rs with 2fa and unique passwords for both at the very least, even if you dont do random passwords, the rest should be bare minimum to have a secure account.  Your lack of understanding of this is why you got hacked, not jagex.
---
Doing 1 clue increments the step count for both

Just a miserable pile of secrets... But enough talk! Have at you!

Oh man the hustles when I was like 7-12 to get the one month memebers.
---
I was in student council in 3rd-5th grade and we got to work at the school store in the mornings, they just sold little things like animal erasers, stencils, notebooks and little toys. I remember stealing a few of everything everyday then selling them off in the playground for 50c-$1 each and when I got enough go bike to the local Blockbuster and cash in everything for an RS membership card.
---
I told my parents how I got the card and they told me to just do chores around the house for membership and to never do that again lol.
---
X20, but that only applies for Skilling Pets. Phoenix counts as a bossing pet, so the chance is the same post 200m.
---
How do people make money rune crafting? What level does it start being profitable?
---
Spamming trade offers is not real community activity. Varrock west was not a social hub, it was an anonymous marketplace
---
Honestly soups quest guides aren't favourite guides because I feel like I'm just with a friend and he's got no clue what's going on either. "Stand here to safe spot" I immediately get slapped and die
---
&gt; What the fuck out there was supposed to be more effective than the 2 step authenticator and a bank PIN? Because none of you fucking shills seem to be able to answer that.
---
He answered your question as you asked. Don't get pissy cause you don't like the answer
---
Nothing can or will be done.  Jagex is entirely powerless to goldfarming bots.
---
Time for sandcrabs
---
A lot of people create a 2nd main to money make while they focus on their actual main to max out. I personally make a lot of purses while playing my main because it’s just a matter of faking at sand crabs.
---
If you’re into pvp or want to get into it, then I’d recommend getting your range up to the same lvl as ur magic and 50-60 atk with rest in strength and then have fun... or you could continue wood chopping on it for $$.
---
Ultimately, do what you want.
---
The I apologise 😂
---
Eventually, now I'm going for the goals I could never get as a kid because I didn't know what efficiency was
---
BAM!

Anguish is ranged and guardian boots is a completely noob item. He could sell his bcp and buy a torture/farm ba for torso and sell guardian boots for d boots or prims if he has enough cash
---
I’m not sure if you’re being sarcastic or not. But growing up, I always played with the lights off, and the brightness up(relatively high, not completely 100% though) and my eyes are absolute garbage. While I think genetics probably weren’t the best to begin with, I can’t help but feel like that exacerbated the problem.
---
I used to get constant headaches and had to get glasses.
---
Cut the middle man out and post the pic yourself and farm that sweet karma
---
aren't there still Dwarf,TzHaar,Werewolf,Elf and Gnome champions still in there? you aren't the champion yet. you just defeated Human champion.
---
But then the TBer could just run away into deep wildy instead.
---
Anytime someone posts a simple picture like this I can’t trust it and search for the hidden memes.
---
That's what made it nostalgic. Not great. Big difference. Sure, the idea of it might sound reminicent, but if you actually had to wait around doing nothing but spamming the chat trying to sell your pvm loot or buy supplies, you'd want an automated system to make that easier eventually. I honestly don't believe for a second this game would have as wide of an appeal as it does without the ge. It's more efficient and the actual gameplay loop that makes runescape fun has nothing to do with standing around spamming the chat in frustration.
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
If you're really starving for cash just take your losses and sell. Investment merching has has its ups and downs. You'll make it back soon

Idk I kinda prefer the text guides because it makes the quest feel less mindless to me. I think it depends on which content you value. If quests are no interest, then video guides work well. If you like quests, text guides or even no guide are sometimes fun too
---
Nah I wear my combat bracelet with my tbow

Already got my diary cape :) boosted at 86 rc

It’s about the flex dude

On one hand I miss the nostalgia.  On the other, it'd would be a major pain in the ass to go back to this AFTER knowing how good GE is.

Yeah im considering just selling them but they could restabilize, I'll probably leave them in offer for a day or two then if they don't go back up I'll sell them
---
Full graceful increases energy regen by 30%

Each piece lowers your weight. Lower weight means less energy used. While weight under 0kg doesn't make a difference it'll help while carrying stuff.

Two options, sell now and eat the loss  use your money to make back the loss.

Or

Put in GE and leave an offer in for awhile.

I remember back in the original RS the ''exchange'' was beside the Varrock palace.  Good times.

Nice one man, I got one there at 4 Jc earlier!!

The OP above me said wiki was faster.  If youre going to do quests for fun then dont use guides at all unless youre really stuck.

Also hate to say it but rs lore is absolute garbage and most quests just are not fun at all.
---
True, but it's only about beating the human champion atm, so I might call myself the champion :D
---
The worst if when your parents realize you are playing the same damn game.
---
Why
---
I see the problem here. You have to be at least 2.2k total to be autistic enough to properly appreciate the content on this sub. Alternatively, you can get 2k total on an ironman, 1750 total on an ultimate ironman, 1500 total on a restricted ironman, or 1k total on a restricted ultimate ironman.
---
This is gold, nice job
---
For proof, look at RS3. If I recall correctly, phats and such that're above max cash are done through the forums.
---
No one is going to enjoy sitting around somewhere spamming for hours that they're selling something worth let's say 3b with 99% if not literally just every trade either being people just wanting to see the item OR people trying to scam for the item.
---
*Barbarianism intensifies*
---
15 accuracy and 10 strength bonus lower. I wouldn’t necessarily call that “much” weaker. That’s two max damage lower.
---
This made my day even better. Cleveland's "no no no no no no NO" was a genius idea for comedy! XD
---
I just use the Arclight on the "Accurate" option
---
But it takes patience to learn the prayer switches because new people probably will die a bunch

And here we have exactly why this law is such a good thing lmfao
---
I recently had an issue with Amazon and it was a huge headache to get my account back. Turns out it had nothing to do with anything I did, their security system just fucked up and falsely flagged me. Would have been nice to have some legal backup when I contacted their support to force them to actually look into my account
---
Hell, replace amazon with jagex and we've heard this story here many times haha
---
Also don't forget that the Kraken pet is half of a karambwan.
---

---
Once i was called nice cape unit while i did herb run with full slayer gear but ardy cloak ,obviously for tp
---
Agreed, especially for puzzle quests
---
I mean its pseudo ironman for some rare things, people can enjoy that for sure
---
:( I was so proud of my meme. Why you gotta hate on me? 
---
My wife cherished the ridiculous enjoyment I got out of this while we were at Hobby Lobby.
---
Yeah, I get your explanation entirely. Just the phrase "noob boots" caught me off guard because it felt pretty harsh for what (I feel) are pretty decent boots. I still use dboots and don't plan to swap 'em 'til I can afford prims, but I was just wondering why.
---
I appreciate the explanation! Hopefully our buddy in the picture can uhh.. kit himself out properly in the future. I'm still trying to afford my upgrades. One zenyte piece down. :(
---
Bracelet of slaughter is essential for good Slayer xp rates and profit. Great magic xp to extend dust devils, then wear a slaughter on top of that.
---
Right? Might as well take advantage of free we xp... and magic roots for Herblore... why waste money cutting a tree when a few extra minutes makes 10 times that...
---
Karils bow was that cheap back then? I thought was more
---
Why would you sacrifice neck slot for that when bonecrusher exists
---
Holy fuck rng is a bitch, i got my golem at 73 mining
---
RuneScape. Where sociopaths are made. LOL
---
Show me one guy getting 85k slayer/h using bgloves.

Maybe if you want low slayer exp/h you can use them.
---
Just trying to give use to a useless item aha
---
Wait for runefest this year

Well the guy is wearing a range ammy and bandos boots with sgs as a main weapon. This screams lack of game knowledge with excess wealth. Aka mom's credit card

I'm not sure where these exact ones would be sold, but I know there are some pins on etsy and here https://runescape.backstreetmerch.com/

Not having to bury the bones is only when you combine te necklace with a bonecrusher and a hydra tail
---
so essentially i would ask in chat 
---
“hey anyone looking for teammate?”
---
or does it auto assign?
---
and what are recommended stats and equipment if i may ask
---
Torso only takes a couple hours just FYI. People make it out to be harder than it is.
---
If you're playing iron, and even if you get 1-2m starting out on a fresh account, that boost in gold allows you to immediately go to shops and buy adamant armor, it then allows you to stock up on some basic runes to splash to 37 magic, the rest can be used to get your construction from around the level 30 wintertodt gets you for free to around level 50-55 which is huge at early game.
---
Wintertodt for irons is meta now and gets so much damn shit unlocked quickly that before would actually take you time.
---
Yeah, the conclusion to the elf questline.
---
Vorkath is definitely easier than Zulrah, it makes it kinda boring after a while though. If you do end up doing Vork, use blessed d'hide over elite void, it's way better DPS when using a blowpipe.
---
Glory trimmed works
---
Consume alcohol, be depressed, put on a show or movie. Maybe some weed if that's your thing
---
I would suggest using sound for switch queue until you’re more comfortable.
---
It was only cash from Rune pouch, Imbued God cape and Bgloves.
---
Same. I don't get how anyone consistently uses video guides. Why the fuck do I want to hear someone mumble for 6 minutes about how to get to X location when I can literally see, "Travel to X and talk to Y. (Fairy Ring ABC)," go do that step, and then click a checkbox next to it to know I've done that step.
---
lol thats actually clever
---
I didn't say you deserve to lose hundreds of hours of progress I said you deserve an answer.
---
That's a decent sign, maybe you'll play in a better way someday.
---
Hoeren neuken, part-time werken (want best duur)
---
Getting the items for quests is something I miss, I'm not sure why that's so hard to believe, it added a bunch of variety. Sometimes you would use your skills to make something, sometimes you would have to look for someone to buy it, sometimes you would have to go to some weird area to collect it, etc.
---
You buy a bond with money... Then sell it for gp. People actually grinding out their gp are never in this kind of gear. You often see they haven't invested in better bonuses that would cost less. There's nothing wrong with this imo, but it shouldn't be that confusing why buying bonds to to sell for gp (aka the entire reason for a bond's existence, which is why you're being laughed at for that weird response)  results in a player have bis buyables
---
Surely people don't enjoy training RC lol the xp should be 400k/hr.. That way they can get back to training that super fun slayer skill. 
---
Been playing an ironman and I'm at like 170 QP and actually kind of enjoyed getting the items so far actually. Literally less annoying than buying all the shit on the ge. Obviously way more work but for some strange reason I found it so fucking annoying to go through the list and search the items and buy them, even if it took way less tine.
---
Find a goal you want to reach and get to work on it
---
So my advice is to watch some guides on YouTube as BA takes some time to get your head around. I did it with void and a magic short bow. As for finding a team go to the BA room marked "one" and just spam the roll you want to play until you get an offer. My advice is to start with attacker and do defender last
---
Yeah, don't try and downplay your noob status lmfao
---
Are we finally getting a crystal magic weapon to fill the gap?
---
Im torn on it.  Im all for supporting the game, but it used to be really impressive seeing a guy in super expensive gear.  Now ppl post here with base 50’s like “what should i do next, budget is 20m”.  I played from 2004-2008 and never had a green cash stack it used to be a huge deal.  Feels like a lot of the magic is gone, but who am I to judge how people spend their money.
---
Yeah, it's a humorous harmless thing to do. What's your problem?
---
Ey, we hebben een nederlandse thread haha. Turbo edition!
---
wow thanks for the advice imma get that fighters torso now!

Don't think so. Last I heard the plan was a rapier-like but degrading weapon (might have failed the poll?) and crystal armor (Tank range armor?)

Was I kind of right then?

Using the winter dude for seed money is always a good idea
---
I was always terrible at merching. Always sold too early cuz of impatience.

I spent the greater part of my childhood smacking shit around with a rune battleaxe so I relate to this guy. Took me years to realize that two 12s are more than one 16.

&gt;loved this part of the game
---
For a couple of weeks/months, sure. When you're attempting to play efficiently long-term, you'll start hating it. Too unpractical and annoying.
---
Hoes mad
---
Yeah this next run I will be. Getting there wasn’t too bad, just need to do that again. Got about 3 runs worth of supplies stuffed into the blowpipe so I should have a couple of tries. I definitely learned some stuff, like don’t get in melee distance from, well anybody, but especially the mager. Also don’t count on the blowpipe spec to work when you need it lol
---
Oh disappointing.. more melee weapons. I guess that's okay though.
---
I do NMZ easy mode when playing League. RuneLite will make some notification sound after 15 mins, for something, and that's when I would repot and take my health back to 1
---
Don't ruin traditional and innocent rs equipment..
---
Video guides are nice to fall back on when you just skim through the Wiki guide and somehow brainlet yourself.
---
Or just stop staking?
---
Support, a simple reskin to a Dutch flag for a couple of worlds wouldn't hurt
---
It's annoying if youre youre rude about it. If your annoyed by "yo just in case you didn't know, your gear is counterproductive," which is typically my exact wording, then that's on you. If they tell me they don't mind I just back off. If they tell me I'm wrong and think their gear is optimal then I ASSUME they are trying to use the right boosts
---
thanks, didnt know about ankou :)
---
If it's a rooftop course it won't change how it looks.
---
because its slow and speed is king.
---
that's why gmaul has been so op and they want to nerf it.
---
Like most items, it has to be designed as an utter throwaway item that has a single niche use or the community will be up in arms about power creep
---
People are opposed to a big visual change, because it would ruin a perfectly good castle. Luckily, rooftop courses don't change anything visually, and are usually created by adding a clickbox to a crate, ladder, ledge, etc. The rest is just running around on a rooftop.
---
Selling Dragon axe. 2.7m

Because Gmaul is far more superior in getting KO's. Jagex is trying to address this problem.

OOOOF so far you’re the big winner.  Sorry about that, fam...  may RNGsus smile upon you soon

2 to 5? Hmmm ok, I recently got skulltircked for like 30 mil and it definitely said 5 minutes at least, what would cause it to be less than 5? And that’s a crazy long time to survive
---
Is this your stream or did you just find the vod? Either way it's hilarious, thanks.
---
I use it for cannoning ice trolls. You can stay at full prayer the entire Slayer task with no potions.
---
Nonsense. You have no other option. Barrow gloves are useless
---
To elaborate... House Tele, pool, portal to lunar island, bank at Birds Eye Jack or whatever his name is from Dream Mentor, and then talk to a regular banker and get kicked from Lunar Island.
---
Oh, did they change it?  I could swear the initial idea was to make it compete with Justiciar.
---
Yes, its really fun to spend a week doing nothing but running around in circles picking up circles
---
Long story short BH and PvP worlds are a cesspool of Gmaul prods (regardless of attack level) and rushers. Don't expect to fight anything that isn't MSB-Gmauling you with a house tab hot on your heels because you won't get it.
---
There is no trick, he just got lucky enough that no one could land a tb on him. The more mage defense u have, the less likely u are to get tbed.
---
The guy is using an anguish necklace for melee...
---
Nothing says fun gameplay like grinding for pennies so you can spend 100 run energy running to Varrock to buy an energy potion so you can drink it all on the way back to Lumbridge and realize you drank it all and can't use it because it's gone.
---
Some things had their special attack changed but i'm not sure if anything has ever had a special attack removed.
---
Osrs didn't have a ge for a while and it was awesome. If you wanted something, you really had to want it in order to go and get it. It made people more ironman-like, because it's easier to kill the imps than it is to buy them.
---
Add a poke attack

ive been using it on some slayer tasks.

works well at ice trolls and suqahs because they have big bones so i don't need to use ppots

Like completely or changed? Whip and g maul back on release of the 2 would either hit your max, or 0. Thus being pretty op with the gmaul because you could do the "3 spec" trick and get 3 specs out of it that could be 3 max hits and ko easily. Its how i pked my first whip day of release. Made mad money lol.

That's why you level your skills, making the game easier as you level up. It's the same thing as dropping out of high school and expecting 15 dollars an hour minimum wage, rather than finishing school and going to college to actually get a decent paying job...
---
I mean, If you want it to be stupid easy, you're playing the wrong game.
---
Even when you exclude bots it's still not really social to spam same thing and haggle
---
They should have like one day or weekend a year where they block off the GE. It would be fun for a day or 2
---
Idk what kind of cartoon Network you have, but the crap kids shows they make now are total trash compared to the older CN and Toonami shows.
---
Commenting for later
---
And it's a problem with every meme subreddit since a lot of uncreative people want useless internet points for some reason.
---
Kill gobbos till you wouldn't get thrashed by cows lol
---
No I'm cooking meatballs.
---
You clearly do.
---
&gt;I don't really mind that it takes long for energy to regen
---
It really is miserable. At level 1, it takes literally 12 minutes. It could be a little easier if people had earlier access to Agility.
---
Nevermind, he deleted all his quest guides, tragic
---
Litterally nothing
---
damn homie i hope it comes soon! i really miss my air guitar emote.
---
Nipples protruding, very disrespectful!
---
Why?
---
A better comparison would be buying an item from a store or buying a gift card and then buying the item. It’s just buying the item with an extra step,  but would you make the same long winded argument that you didn’t actually buy the item? You’re just being needlessly pedantic and not making a very good argument of it.
---
Voting no, it just seems like it wants to force in content that truth be told I doubt anyone will use other than for training the skill itself, everything they have shown so far looks like it would be much better placed in runecrafting itself, and it would give a good variety to the skill as apposed to the current just running back and forth till 99.
---
Its beautiful
---
I wear my granite gloves and I’m in the mid-80s. I’m just a trash player and I don’t know enough about other items.
---
Meh you all make fun of me but I’m not the sad douche who reposts others just to get internet points lmao. I’ll never be that low in life.
---
I got it killing fanatic trying to get a splitbark body on my Ironman for a clue.. got 3 splitbark legs and the pet, no body tho ffs!
---
First thing I did when I got a dark bow lmao
---
I got my mom to buy membership, and it ended up being a reoccurring charge that she didn't notice for about a year.
---
Best year of my life
---
&gt; exceptionally gay
---
Lmao I'm exceptionally straight but yes, I imagine. Literally make the bio say "super gay but need bud", make your profile obviously super gay, and as long as you're in OKC or Tulsa it will be 2 or 3 days I bet.
---
Rose-tinted nostalgia glasses
---
Like after 75 when you can start getting consistent Kurask/Gargs/Wyverns
---
Its pretty obvious, you open the skill guide and it says in some pretty obvious letters:
---
LEVEL 1: GNOME STRONGEHOLD AGILITY
---
If that doesnt tell you where to start it i dunno what to tell you.
---
Do you also wanna complain about hunter since there isnt a hunting spot in lumbridge? 
---
Theres no reason everything needs to be introduced in lumbridge. Part of the game is exploring and finding out whats there, if you spend like 10 seconds reading the skill guide and looking at the world map youll know where to start agility.
---
I remember making a fucking graph showing the price of membership compared to the price of membership during the next month and apparently that $0.50 hike and presentation was enough lmao.
---
I guess at the end of the day, who cares if someone wants to train with godswords or any of their favorite gear.
---
dunno but i think it's at least a few invents, a while ago there were people griefing by dropping inventories of junk on people's death piles in pvp to despawn their untradeables, i think that's when it was changed to prioritise alch value
---
I prefer the one that doesn't have the moving spinning blades around the big square
---
You're literally claiming yourself that the problem with low level energy is that new players can't figure out where to start their agility training. I proposed a couple of easy ways to inform them of how to do train agility, and where to do it. 
---
&gt; I would argue that an agility course sending you around rooftops would be a great way to show you what the town has.
---
That isn't the purpose of Rooftop courses. Rooftop courses are always instanced off from the rest of the town, and players are capable of walking a small distance to see the other side of lumbridge themselves. Claiming that your course would "teach" players about what's around the town is a stretch and a half. Especially considering there's no way for them to learn anything about the town being constrained to a monorail where they can't interact with anything while going in circles.
---
&gt; It would need to get it to level 10, or the reward would be futile and still require you to travel to Gnome Stronghold.
---
You can use the Gnome Stronghold course at level 1.
---
&gt; It's not overloaded, it's just very well complete.
---
If it's very well complete, then why add anything more? Convenience? Why not put a slayer master in Lumbridge too? As we all know players have a hard time finding a slayer master to start their training. (That's sarcasm. The most popular skill, slayer, also has one of the most hidden ways of starting the skill, yet is the most trained among all new accounts.)
---
&gt; It would make it regenerate faster.
---
You see, it wouldn't make it regenerate faster by any noticeable amount. What level do you plan on people stop training at your new course? 10? 15? You can't have them be there for long, especially since you later claim that this course would be made so that it wouldn't make other courses obsolete (ie. the gnome stronghold course that you can use at level 1...). If they're not there long enough to see a difference, it doesn't solve the initial problem of run energy being too low in early levels.
---
&gt; It would literally give you access to them, making itself irrelevant in the process. That's its job.
---
Again, you can access the gnome stronghold course at level 1 agility. Not sure what you're going on about here.
---
&gt; It's easy to be suddenly against something if every conclusion you draw is wrong.
---
In your opinion it's wrong, but you failed to even consider my points. You didn't think farther than "this is a neat and convenient idea!" and you didn't stop to think about whether or not there were better, easier, simpler ways to do this exact same thing.
---
No. 
---
Stop being lazy. 
---
That's my opinion.
---
I'm not completely against the idea, but even as a new low level player having to go to gnomeland was exciting. You get to walk across the entire map and see all the new content.
---
Doubtful, even if gnome course is like 10x more exp almost all new players would just train at Lumbridge until level 10, there would be no incentive to trek across the map when you could just spend a bit more time and achieve the same goal.
---
What, exactly, is positive about not letting two people -- one, buying at X price, another, selling at X price -- be matched up because they happen to play at different hours?  You're just arbitrarily blocking a mutually desired, consensual exchange because you prefer the nostalgic aspect of forcing people to stand around auto-typing or developing arthritis.
---
Do you not have the cash to train in a members world? Lots of easy quests to give you range xp and you get sand crabs
---
The first time you bought a Dharok's set or a whip, sure. But standing in Seer's bank and selling bowstrings for two hours straight was not fun.
---
Trading part of OSRS is largely glorified and, despite playing uim at the moment, I strongly believe GE is one of the best updates since 07.
---
Maybe you're the weird one
---
you're really willing to say anything to push the idea of spoonfeeding noobs content
---
Ugh I'm like almost an hour north of Tulsa. It's awful. I at least go there about once a week though. Didn't think about that. Definitely not paying tinder for a dealer. I think Tulsa would be in the range of my search? God there's no trees, no food, no entertainment, this place is a wasteland.
---
dumbest thing I've read in a while.
---
&gt;Is buying bonds code for buying gold or something, how the hell does buying a bond translate into BiS gear?
---
This was your first comment. That sounds like you were not aware that people buy bonds with real money and then sell them for gold. The illegitimate option is always going to be a better rate because if it’s not there is no reason to choose the option with even a minimal amount of risk if the payout is the same.
---
If an iron gets crashed in a multi area, they just don't get loot, many will happily stay and get reduced xp. Why do ppl act like it's so one sided.
---
Oh my, what diary reqs require chewed bones?
---
You can say that again.
---
One sec check inbox.
---
This happens in the hood
---
I just joined “noble bros”. A wide range of levels, quite a few 100+. We do group events including some pking, gwd, corp etc.
---
The drop rate is 1/128 which isn't technically the answer to your question but is the answer to a more relevant question
---
What is the best defence gear I can buy? 
---
I have 11M gp and def 67.
---
Missing the point entirely. Good job!
---
the gods are pleased with your offering.
---
Kinda rude to use Pic of someone's funerals for meme and can't even sensor those people who are there for losing someone in their life
---
If you’re looking for honest (elitist) opinion - some possible upgrades you may want: barrows gloves, fighters torso, dragon defender.
---
Did you at least Buy the GF?
---
129 iirc (but don't quote me on that)
---
I got mine at ~60 farming. 50/50
---
This was annoying af, took forever to sell shit
---
I can’t see it
---
Selling stuff is fun sometimes.
---
Dps is insanely favored nearly everywhere. Defender will always be better. Even on dragon tasks if you have the levels to not pray melee and cash for extended super antifires.
---
I didn't know he was redoing his old guides. That's pretty cool.
---
I thought it was 1 every 10ish mins, but I think you know it better than me so I'll trust that.
---
Just fake it till u make it. Watch a guide and then just call out whatever role you need until someone picks you up. Even better, start your own team and no one will question you.
---
Also should've waited another 28 days for a nice round 5000 days which would've come out to 13.69 years
---
I’m not sure if he’s doing them all, but I’m pretty sure I’ve seen a few of them done.
---
I still struggle to kill Zulrah as me not big brain enough to remember how the rotations go.
---
it didn't go through my mind because it's so mind-boggingly stupid that you want to take away travelling in an adventure mmorpg where a big original focus was discovery and walking around the map. 
---
If a new player doesn't know that the game necks exist, and that gnome is a less than 5 minutes run from it, then they have not spent the necessary time to develop proper game knowledge.
---
You want to remove the adventure and discovery part of a MMORPG, which is simply hard to understand your rational reasoning behind that except that you just want to make the game easier.
---
For ironman just make the walk out to the mage bank
---
Ehh.  I'm not saying the days before the GE were the ideal scenario.  I just think you could come up with a better trading market than the GE if you hadn't designed it with the intent of removing free trade.
---
When you say you're gonna remove free trade, you need to have a single price for every item so you can tell if any given trade is "balanced".  So the GE was designed to be able to provide that single price.  And that to me has been its biggest flaw from day 1.
---
Wow I never knew this lol thanks
---
Looking good brother 👌🏻
---
40 years late to the meme bro - even the other day’s repost, which you missed, was several years late
---
But honestly no big deal. Good luck in the grind brother.
---
I think most recommendations if you're going to do blast mine is to start at 75 since that's when you get rune.
---
How the fuck do you get this from that ugly 8 bit bitch in falador park?
---
Isn't the brimhaven arena in the members part of karamja?
---
Also it would be kinda weird that canifis is between varrock and fallador but not f2p
---
50/50
---
^Tee ^hee!
---
Easyscape
---
When you spawn in lummy for the first time you have an array of tools, some equipment, bread  meat, let's also add 1-2 energy pots. Then new players will know they exist and how useful they are.
---
Or if youre that worried about your items, bank them before logging off.
---
You're welcome to your opinion. Your argument would defeat almost all QoL updates though, which consistently pass polls.
---
Bandos items are a total meme. Just get torso and obby legs. 
---
Armadyl and ancestral are gonna be your big bonus items after zenytes. Range is OP so arma is really good.
---
Not a 9 HP acc, useless
---
Definitely a 50/50
---
It is just helped my buddy do it you can still block but its iffy. What we did when blocking failed is have a second account dropping food and potions
---

They didn't have a tber
---
That's good that he's redoing them. But there are definitely guides with damn near no  flaws and at that point it's hard to justify taking a gamble on slayermusic.
---
OP plz.
---
I'm very new to this game and I have some questions.
---
What weapon did you use that hit for 71 at the start?  O.O
---
Second. Was it just me or was he holding over 25 items when you killed him? How he hold so much stuff?
---
I thought text posts don’t add to your karma count though
---
Get runelite bro fix your render distance and add a skybox
---
That location and all the autotyping is just pure nostalgia and I wish this would return to osrs!
---
I'm not saying it would hurt the game. I'm saying it's unnecessary, and doesn't solve the actual problem which is low run energy at low levels of agility.
---
Throwing an agility course in Lumbridge, dusting our hand off, and calling it "mission accomplished" is what would hurt the game. This suggestion doesn't solve anything, and doesn't have any real reason to be put into the game when there are other options that work just as well.
---
It's cuz you gotta get lucky with em
---
Melee is used for a lot. Blowpipe and Melee are pretty interchangable for most, but once you have 90+ range and can afford a tbow that works for like 75% of bosses.
---
I really miss those days actually...
---
Socks

I even catch all the youngs/babies in case of a clue scroll. You get used to dropping needles.

Haha I remember my first godsword back in the day! I sold my entire bank for a BGS and was rocking sacred clay armour! I felt like such a badass
---
Congrats man. Currently grinding these out at 114 combat 😂 I hate questing so much. I had to cancel my membership with 21 days left to motivate myself. If I don’t get them in time I’m chucking my bank and will have to grind out a bond in f2p. 
---
120qp so far 😑 long way to go.
---
Probably just a huge turn off to train agility when you have to go all the way across the map to start. Not to mention theres countless monsters that will aggro and possibly kill you sending you right back to lumbridge. 
---
Imagine being new. Brand new. Running (well walking, hence the problem) for 15 minutes to be killed and sent back. 
---
"Fuck this stupid game" and bam, jagex failed to retain another new player.

It will last for 5000 burned logs, granting 50% of the normal experience for burning the log. It has a 1 in 3 chance of activating, so will last for approximately 15,000 chopped logs, burning 5000 of them.
---
Bots are rampant everywhere
---
Zulrah raids kbd
---
Having to walk across the map to begin to train a skill is not challenging, its bad design.
---
Lol turns out people like sharing advice boohoo
---
At least I didn’t take the picture with my phone tho, minimum ms paint skills yes, but effort lvl 99.

Once I can afford that 1b+ item, that's gonna be a long long while. Nice to know that melee can be used atleast

Wait but who wears eternal boots to a raid?

i am the creator of the 30 to 80 interactive steven bots you see running around world 301. They copy what you say and follow you around the game. They also take a series of commands from you. **The only intention is to entertain people.**
---
here's the current list of commands:
---
    kill or attack,
---
    swarm or disperse,
---
    randomon and randomoff (toggles random colors of text),
---
    circle,
---
    vertical,
---
    follow or square,
---
    dd or death or death dot,
---
    infinity,
---
    horizontal (they make rows)
---
    home teleport,
---
    run and walk,
---
    reich or swastika,
---
    stay
---
I was hoping people on reddit who have seen the  bots before might have some **suggestions for new features** for me to add to the bots?  
---
here's some posts people have made about my bots in the past

You will
---
Being in mage gear while trying to tank hits and heal up definitely isn't better than bolting on pray range though
---
Hadden we vroeger
---
Those extra fuzzy and fluffy socks.
---
No
---
It shouldn't, that might be a bug
---
What kinda car though? We got Toyota corollas and Lamborghini Hurracans.
---
Just dump and grab melee gear
---
id have quit a long time ago if it wasnt for the herb run rebuilds
---
How do you think Ricky would say ranarr?
---
Ray-nar?
---
I'm gonna be honest. I had no idea how to get to the gnome stronghold when I was first starting out and had to ask a guy to get me all the way from varrock to the agility course. He was a total champ.
---
Max in max str is 83, max hit with dboots/bgloves/ glory, helm of neitz is 73
---
Just as bad
---
osbot client
---
why are u so keen on beginner scrolls that ur willing to use cballs for it
---
It’s Morytania, chief :)
---
LOL HAHA
---
Useful for showing off that big dick energy
---
Ah fair enough will just have to cope with it till it gets fix
---
It's challenging in the way that there's obstacles on the way, and a navigational challenge
---
What we need is an overhaul of non-rooftop agility. There's a dozen courses that are completely dead content.
---
The Agility Pyramid already has some nice perks, but as it stands there's no reason to spend any time doing other courses, let alone gnomeball! There should be a strong reason for players to venture into places like the Dorgeshuun cave course.
---
adam in lumbridge
---
True, but the good pkers I face will switch back to tank top and legs immediately after blitzing/barraging and they do it habitually. It's the meta atm
---
It takes a while to learn but if you put enough practice in and really believe in yourself you can 1 shot someone with a lucky spec like op did
---
I know I know
---
Yes. OSRS uses the old ancient combat algorithm from 2001 era. There’s almost no situation where scimmy isn’t going to be the best weapon for XP and training
---
Lowering the draynor course to 1 is probably the best way to go about it. Not a very far walk from the spawn point in lumbridge and also has the added benefit of no dev time required.
---
Yeah, it makes everything quicker and liquid. Currently, if you have a torture, you also have an anguish and a tormented bracelet, because you can trade one for the other on the GE pretty much instantly.
---
Without the GE, that would be less easy, and gear would mean more.
---
Hahahahhaa
---
He probably meant 300k cash, to prevent people from offering other items
---
Obviously one is not as bad as the other, its an analogy, they are both equally as annoying. It’s like when people tell you to stop drinking, go to the gym, go study, etc. Its unsolicited advice you arent helping anyone youre being annoying. if youre trying to be friendly theres so much shit you can talk about, so why would you choose the one annoying thing you can say.
---
but what if that’s how they enjoy RS?
---
Super hard hitting weapons ARE better if you’re flinching and trying to trade attacks. Like for the chaos elemental, thermonuclear smoke devil, etc.
---
Even luckier than op in my opinion.
---
I had a major breakthrough (see my edit in original post)
---
Yeah I hate seeing the xp drop for a big hit but also seeing it didn’t register. If you could kill the respiratory in one go I think it would encourage people to stay for multi kill trips instead of going to the PoH every kill. I actually really like how the fight plays out I just don’t enjoy farming it because it feels like the majority of the time is spent running there and killing the respiratory. I’d even be keen on a sire HP buff to counteract speeding up the respiratory phase
---
YOU HEARD THE HAND! THE KING IS TOO FAT FOR HIS ARMOR!
---
nice i could really tell you were joking from the tone of your voice
---
Well if staged I understand but without context it's looks bad
---
Muts*
---
Yeah cause the time delay to attack the next monster carries over from the last kill. As another said in here, when you are flinching, speed doesn't matter anymore
---
Or just use the Quick Guide on the wiki.
---
Assuming you know the general layout of the map, the quick guides at super straightforward, to the point where they literally tell you what numbers to press for the dialogue.
---

Rust is really good practice with this kinda thing. If you can win a late game fight and remain calm looting all of their guns and armor and valuables, then the skill translates nicely

Cross dressing fire giants are now a thing. Thank you for putting that into my conscious awareness.

Yeah, you can brew down to very low offensive stats and box a spider until the tb wears off.
---
Super organized and big clans have ways around this where they either lure the demons out of the enclosure, and have boxers on the red spiders in the dungeon. You won't encounter this level of organization unless you're risking 50m+.

PIJLTJE OMHOOG LINKS! PVDD STEMMERS RECHTS!
---
Should we have it be this way for all skills then? Hunter you need to go to like feldip hills to train it. You don't need agility early on unless you already know what you're doing. Most things you focus on early are around lumb, and if you're taking a efficient way to start like rushing combat quests you wind up in gnome strong hold(or the general area) anyway.
---
Cool account and little thing you missed though but i might be wrong i dont think you could equip hloves with platebodys in runescape classic not really that big a deal though

people who have lost the will to live
---
Why does the game always have to be about efficiency? The game is heavily structured around being self sufficient, and creating everything from scratch. Which I do enjoy doing very much. Manipulating xp/hr is a competitor’s game, and sometimes it makes the game too easy giving little satisfaction out of it just to power through levels. Just so people can be the elitist and call other people cute noobs for being slow... go get 99 Runecrafting if you want to preach about efficiency...
---
Are you sure it's the right account?
---
This is really more a problem for /r/runescape, most people here don't play RS3.

Trashing CB levels is soo 2007 (and earlier) though. Even before NMZ

It’s effective at KBD to drop a inventory of food considering how fast you go through food

Now that's a cc and a name i recognize

That's not account security. That's just people being dumb.
---
It's waiting unless you are actively achieving the goal you want to achieve where you're standing. For example, alchemy.
---
For all other definitions, walking is essentially waiting to reach your next goal. So is running, except it's faster. You don't see many people turning off run energy so they can enjoy walking, because walking isn't fun. If we had unlimited run energy, everyone would run everywhere. That says a lot about how much people enjoy walking.
---
Nice, I’ll have to remember those, I just know that a lot of companies are like that
---
Welcome to the Grand Exchange, Steven.

Why do you rock cake ?

Wow you suck at negotiating lol

I would fall asleep
---
What are we looking at here? This is good gear for someone in the 60-70 stats range.
---
That’s hot
---
I'm on negotiating I'm just selling my collection cuz I don't really need or want it anymore, I'm not trying to scam either I'm just not wanting my collection I'm losing actually quite a lot of money for it too
---
Well technically if you think about it the max cape itself doesn't have any cosmetic variants, it is used to make cosmetic variants of other cape but there are no cosmetic variants of the max cape which gives it a different design while keeping it with the max capes stats and perks. I know that doesn't really mean anything but I think it would be nice to have a cosmetic variant for the standard max cape and I just think the champions cape would be the best fit for that :)
---
who the fuck would auto click that shit? is it even good xp
---
Great response,  thanks for taking  the time to figure math out to give me this answer

Same for my elite. Had 97 QP, needed barrows gloves. Nonstop grind doing RFD

Yeah, you make 10-12k per patch. I make more doing Yannillian Hops runs than herbs now.
---
I’m crying. I hope runescape made your childhood better, as it did for me.
---
Did you get any duplicate platebodies in that time?
---
GET THE BREASTPLATE STRETCHER BOY
---
Oh, I misread.
---
Somehow I don't miss this lol.
---
im a noob :(
---
I'm basically billy in this lmao
---
Your character is a damn near clone of mine wtf, same everything
---
Lol I’m just giving you shit for saying you’re selling it for 4.5m after a guy “offering” 10m
---
I'd say it was worth it. I think I was using whip, defender, barrows gloves, climbing boots, and glory as a +1. The kills weren't exactly super fast, but they're super afk and the other drops you get aren't too bad, nothing to complain about.
---
Assuming you can find a time where you don't get pked every five seconds, I'd say it's well worth grinding out.
---
My clan actively looks for other clans in the wild, usually at revs or gdz. Clan warring is a whole other beast to singles or rushing even. 
---
Wg is still an honor clan though. They’re one of the only honor clans left.
---
80 to 99 range 2 viss keep it up man. (B4 dhc new update)
---
I use goingcrazy201
---
Yeh like Camelot bank chest is right there. But in wc guild maybe its less populated? Idk this just seems odd
---
OP: where did you find that screenshot? I am the user C O C O 9 3
---
Can’t believe I happened to scroll past this. I made most of the money luring. I think I was saving up for a Santa hat at the time.
---
I would much rather juggle drops then have them go to deshawn. He can get his own drops!
---
I never banned you that's the thing lol.
---
You got a fury, b ring, barrows gloves, slayer helm and defender. Only thing I could see you needing is a torso, otherwise you look fine
---
Its interesting how those kind of posts never get too much karma
---
I loved your post.
---
I did underground pass with like 26 agility pre eoc.
---
It’s a pretty easy quest once you commit to doing it. Just follow a guide
---
A new chair and a psychiatric evaluation.
---
Yep. All you have to do is find a way to reach the other side of the game map without knowing anything about how travel, jewelry, or death works. Easy!
---
Just follow a guide, it’s simple once you comity to it
---
My parents set up some program on my computer that shut off the internet at midnight, but I found out that setting the clock back on the computer would re enable it.
---
what's your opinion on the method?
---
It’s just extensive and requires a lot of sub-quests and such.  One can’t just simply do it.
---
I've only been wearing armor I can smith.
---
I'm walking around as a lvl 50 with a mixture of steel and mithril on. 
---
I think my noobness is so intense and bright people just can't bring themselves to comment in their awe.
---
I see. Either way I don't have a whip quite yet so I'll have to wait for that at the least. I do have dragon boots (over climbing boots) and everything else you listed, so I guess as soon as I get a whip I'm good to go.
---
I didn't care much for it.  It's click intensive so you do have to put more work into it.  I personally let the fish get autocut which gave me a short reprieve between catching fish, but I know you can get much better exp rates by actively cutting the fish every time you send out the bird.  However with that method you really are constantly focusing on the game.  If you're okay with that training style then I recommend it.  Also plenty of beginner clues should you care about those.
---
This is a pretty stupid mentality. "I'm going to crash you, but if you ask nicely I'll hop worlds, since I'm such a nice guy". People know what they're doing when they crash you. I'm not going to feign politeness when they already decided to be annoying. 
---
The only real way to deal with someone crashing is to ignore them. They can't handle crap xp rates for more than 10 minutes, they'll leave eventually.
---
haxunit? yeah get this guy
---
&gt; The efficiency obsession is ridiculous
---
Yes. And I was mocking him for being so obsessed with efficiency that he would shit on the other person for it.
---
&gt;people who get defensive and claim something is correct when its clearly not are annoying as well.
---
He wasn't claiming anything was correct. He was saying it was "worth it" and argued why he thought so. u/HiddenGhost1234 seems to think "worth it" is synonymous with "highly efficient" because that's how they like to play, but that's not how words work and policing the other guy over it was shitty haha

I keep a cannon base on me in case people act like arseholes. It's nice when you get to a point where you don't need loot either from tasks as you can outlast anyone. We're a stubborn breed.
---
Tool box too
---
My most recent mute before these two without evidence was back in 2014.
---
What does a bastion pot do?
---
Before these two that show no evidence to learn from, I havent been muted since 2014.
---
Savage
---
Can you help me get my torso:rsn p2p inners
---
For leveling? Feathers, extremely cheap. Least that's how I did it 10 years ago, no idea if it is still viable.
---
Raiding and looting are not the same thing I take it.....
---
If it helps when I started doing barrows I was running around in a rune platebody and dragon legs so if you dont have money for better gear that will suffice. It doesn’t a lot to do barrows you just wont be as fast as better gear. Still could make close to 500k an hour if you’re lucky. If you haven’t done morytania hard diaries that’s a must. It boosts the amount of runes you get by 50%. If you’re close to finishing them or having the skills for them it’s worth it to put off barrows just for mory hard
---
Practice, then once you get comfortable with switches start pking with groups and in welfare.  Make a pure, theyre cheap to pk on and tons of fun, great for learning as well as you don't need many switches.
---
I thought they just cancelled that
---
Buy a bunch of minds, airs and a fire staff and find a demon to attack.
---
Idk getting to gnome stronghold is such an adventure when your acc is new!
---
I love wearing stuff I like the appearance of. Even if it's not optimal. Sometimes I walk around wearing noob looking stuff, too. It's fun.
---
Splashing is slow but very afk
---
If you want faster and more cost efficient, actually kill something. That way you get xp for the spell and damage rather than just spell plus drops. 
---
Imp Catcher + witch's potion gets you to 10 or 11 magic.
---
Sara Sword for cheap strength training weapon maybe? Otherwise whip is better for def and att.
---
Why is the second "i" lowercase?
---
Thank you!
---
This mentality is exactly why I was surprised and excited for the series
---
Going to be honest mate, but it is really difficult to get a permanent mute. I'd put money on you being a dick on multiple accounts and you haven't stopped so they got your main.
---
Isn't there a demon under the mages tower that's southwest a bit of Lumbridge?
---
How much of a speed difference are we talking about in splashing vs killing? I'm stuck to only using mobile so I would like to go with something less click heavy.
---
I don't remember what Imp Catcher and witch poitions are, sounds like a member thing. I'm staying free to play till I get a PC soon.
---
Dwh kc?
---
Trying to win an internet argument by criticising grammar? 
---
Is it 2003?
---
Watching pro DMM gave me a whole diff perspective on pk intricacy. The best players are absolutely nuts. I suggest checking them out, it's crazy.
---
Sara sword almost the same price as bludgeon, a cheap str weapon would be leaf blade axe, or SOTD or granite hammer I guess lol.
---
Idk i just know i got my 99 str off sotd and a bit of dh.
---
Needs to be much more oldschool looking
