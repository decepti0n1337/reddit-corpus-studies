Plus it's a problem of jurisdiction. A game developed in the UK being played on servers located in Germany with "criminal actions" done by a US national against an Australian national. Too many places for the battle to bounce around that it's not worth it.

You don't want to wear ranged gear while using mage as it has very negative magical bonuses.

For the people getting all grumpy over how it's all so childish and how people have the mental age of 12 year olds, keep in mind that most of the OSRS community is exactly that. Complaining about it here won't change that, so just accept it as it is and have a laugh if you're capable of humour.

If I complete Karamja Hard Diary for the sole purpose of gem mining, will I still need to complete the lower tier dairies in order to access the mine? I‚Äôve heard you can‚Äôt claim rewards for higher tiers until the lower ones are also complete, but I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs only for the pieces of equipment, like the gloves etc. 
---
Don't fletch, the extra rewards shouldn't matter because it's not going to be that much more gp/hr and you want to be offering logs as often as you can for the most xp/hr.
---
Yeah exactly. Making a separate sub for it would just normalize it and make Jagex think it‚Äôs actually an acceptable way to deal with customer support. Which it most definitely isn‚Äôt.
---
Fletching gives better points and a little fletching xp (obviously). Not fletching gives higher FM xp rates.
---
Since you already have full pyro, I wouldn‚Äôt fletch if I were you.

These used to be completely legit, the public scripts at the time had no option to rig the bets and would always trade the winnings unless the host manually stopped the script. Then a new script came around which had rigging options where it would change the outcome on wins over a certain ammt, basically making it a dead method. Bots get banned very fast now especially on f2p and you can't make too much anymore. Used to make 100m+/hr with just a few accounts.

Go in, click middle chest, click on one of the 4 doors in the room, go next room. Repeat til you enter last available room. Loot everything in last room. 
---
Only random part is the entrance. All the rooms have same layout.  You have 5 minutes to make your way to the last room and loot there. Click on a pot and wait about 3 seconds for animation, then go to next pottery. Pretty damn afk and chill. 
---
I thought you had to just get it recharged at the well for free tho?
---
for vorkath void and blowpipe and salve (ie), and aim to get a dhcb makes it much easier and faster
---
for zulrah, blowpipe, trident, occult and just dhide ahrims to start with, upgrade with tormented bracelet, anguish, ahrims etc
---
for vorkath just get range up, for zulrah just mage and range up. You can do both at your current stats but the higher you get them the easier and faster it will be
---

---
That's what I meant, I prefer the poh method so I'm wondering if there's any reason not to use it 
---
Okay, most people there seem to fletch. So fletching is more afk but less xp?
---
I've seen several responses to posts with hardly any karma. Have you considered you just aren't seeing the less popular posts?
---
That‚Äôs a bit naive of you to say, man. If the hacker managed to find out that your password for both Runescape and email were the same then that means you were possibly a victim of data breech.
---
Check haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email brings up anything. Also keep in mind that hackers pay premium to have access to data breeches that have not been added to haveibeenpwned.
---
If someone managed to get on your account they CAN do it again. You dont even know 100% if they got it by matching matching passwords. It could have been anything from recoveries to finding out about you through social media, etc.
---
My viewpoint is not ‚Äúpessimistic‚Äù. It‚Äôs called being realistic and cautious. Do what you want man, but I have taken every precaution to not get hacked and I have never been hacked in my decade+ of playing. I continue playing because I know that unless I PERSONALLY fuck up (clicking phishing link, etc) there‚Äôs no possible way someone can take my account.

You have to complete the lower tiers as well. I highly recommend doing it, I‚Äôve done gem mining with Karamja hard diary and you rarely see anyone. It‚Äôs also a convenient teleport to Duradel. 
---
Please don‚Äôt take my son ( my friend said cover everything I tried lmao)
---
The whole tier system on osrs is unusual. They‚Äôre purposely keeping things on T75 even though they‚Äôre more like T80s. It‚Äôs just so the playerbase doesn‚Äôt think the end is near. 
---
oh no, poh method is much better
---
That‚Äôs like twice as lucky
---
What you just said, is verifiably false.
---
These bots aren't too common, maybe on W2. Bot busting streams for game botters are all people determined beforehand, and really, it's quite repetitive and boring because they limit it to F2P map. It's amazing the first time but once you've seen it once it's a bit boring  It actually replaced the data stream at RuneFest. 
---
The real bots that cause issues are GE spammers and F2P bots. GE spammers are annoying as hell and constant. PMods are useless and can't do anything. It's 2019, services exist to automate these bots. Once they're muted there's a replacement sent in a few minutes automatically.

Most people playing the game dont personally know a venezuelian. Most of those people will not feel related to them in the slightest manner. The only impact those venezuelians have on their life is in the game, specifically on the economy. You might feel concerned by the situation but most people playing OSRS live where problems are different and the game isnt an income source. So obviously the majority of them will denounce and react when their game balance is affected. I dont think anyone of these people do it to be assholes/hearthless toward venezuelians. Some people might associate venezuelians to indian scammers or chinese botters ( grey area of morality) and feel hatred toward them by ignorance.

I love RuneScape to bits, let's be real, but there was always one thing it never had that most every other MMO has.
---
In every other game I play: I heal people from friends to people near-death from a mob or a boss.
---
In RuneScape: it's never been possible outside of Daemonheim in RS3 (save for a members-only couple of Spells that cost both Runes and your own lives, plus it's locked behind a Quest).
---
I'd like to suggest just a simple Healing ability. Maybe a low-healing spell in the Basic Spellbook or, far more simply, the ability to Use food on players.
---
I would just love to ability to heal people. Help them out a bit. That's all! \^\^

I never though of that. Good point. It would be op for training def pures for example. Thanks.

Why would you scam when you are literally telling the people you have a 5% house edge?  The scam is right there in plain sight.

---
The playerbase is apparently growing / staying steady
---
The game was built off a 2007 save of original runescape, and the 'feel' has remained the same -- no EOC, etc.
---
honestly, i'd like to see more tiers of staves, buff on the regular master wand to have a magic damage boost, and kodai and the toxic variants of trident and SOTD made T80 magic where they actually belong (theres like 6+ different magic weapons, each slightly better than the other at t75, why?)
---
also, for ranged, a specific shortbow at T70 would fit in, that could fire dragon arrows - so basically a more affordable and reasonable 3rd age shortbow. i've always thought of an abyssal shortbow (an abby demon or sire drop) that could fit right in as it wouldn't be too expensive.  
---
It would offer the necessary step up from the current 800gp magic shortbow that's dominating every edge fight currently. with this, msb's accuracy could be nerfed a slight bit aswell to condition people to use this weapon or alternatives.  
---
you could argue that blowpipe already exists - yes, but blowpipe uses scales so its expensive to keep up, isn't really meant for pvp (with its attack speed being different in pvm/pvp) and has a shorter attack range than other shortbows so it's not really incentivising to use it in actual fights, unless you're unskulling.
---

The corporation is managed poorly and I feel bad for their employees. People who berate the employees for something outside of their control are what ruin the enjoyment and work ethic of the game developers.

how do you guys handle things like this, the drop rates are pretty clear from even this screenshot, but the runelite kill report is different than the actual number due to multiple being killing on the same tick

Ok, the bandos chestplate and abyssal whip weren't very good examples. They are heavily priced and overall aren't traded enough. Look at things such as ranarr seeds/snapdragon seeds/red chinchompa.

Dicing was bad enough when there were actual in game methods of generating random numbers, but you have to be a special kind of stupid to think an rng bot completely under the control of its owner won't cheat you.

U got an assembler before 6kc??? Or am I trippin

Holy shit yes
---
If you mean the one that keeps track of them, that's Loot Tracker.
---
If you mean the one that shows the item names/value on the ground, Ground Items
---
It does make them money. Notice how you, the player, need 55-100 to win. That means the "house" (the bot) has a &gt;50% chance to win. The bot could be completely legitimate - no rigged rolls, always paying out fairly - and the owner would still make money.

Its been that long since it happened i couldnt even remember the car exactly haha

Seercull is dead. But any upgrade should be related to the Fremmenik theme.

Zerks arent bad either

You didnt hide your feather amount. GG account

Cant say I'm sad. Jagex needs to do more against them. Anyone with a Venezuelan IP should be under scrutiny. 
---
Yo man, i seriously appreciate this answer. That makes a lot of sense and seems like the path that i should set on now at this point in my account. Sorry i didnt see your answer earlier, i was workin. But thanks man, im gonne be referring back to this thread so if i have a dire question ill ask ya. 
---
sweetie, do 2000+ chests and then come talk to me ok? alright thanks sweetie
---
No
---
What extra struggle? I dont understand. Are you talking about the emblem farmers?
---
Jagex should just pay the Venezuelans to be their customer support so they don't have to rwt for money
---
Solve 2 problems at once

ballista is terrible dps though, its only good for big hits in pvp

is that a trackball mate

The osrs one is a virus

The rs3 virus is safe afaik

Because people don't understand reddicate

When the main theme came in I got goose bumps. I just finished this quest for the first time yesterday and I gotta say, it was amazing. Vorkath is pretty fun too for a money maker. He does enough attacks that are "dick moves" for me to get angry and want to keep killing him.
---
ik, i heard i gives you 1m every time you click it

Thank you for an actual reply other than "ur wrong hurrrrrrrr"

Btw I'm using a wireless trackball mouse, good stuff.

Amethyst javelins also exist
---
I'm talking about the extra struggle of staying alive and really fighting for your survival(since it has double meaning for Venezuelans lol). 
---
Emblem farmers are pretty hard to kill since they stay within such specific level ranges. I didn't even know people tried to kill them. 
---
It's the NPC's name buddy
---
My god. Imagine trying to be this edgy in 2019.
---
So there‚Äôs a chance...sweet!
---
the best part about gnomeball is that you can dunk it from the starting line
---
Honestly, vorkath is a lot cheaper. All you need is salve ei, full ranged void, a blowpipe, snakeskin boots, and the achievement diary ring as a base setup. Zulrah you need ranged and mage gear to effectively kill it.
---
Prims? Do you have all your rings? (berserker, archers, etc.) 
---
Quest for 42 def one cmb lower and I‚Äôm sure the 61 attack you will probs get wont make a combat level difference and you only miss out on 1 max hit for one cmb level lower which is worth imo 
---
Imagine starving in 2019 like just go buy some food

Whats the meme here? Picture wont load for me.

1. Thats not what i said, "less people that use osb traded those items this week" is. The wording changes the meaning. Quit twisting it.

2. Your graph is that data my dude. Correlation is not causation

No he didn't 
---
They're on Amazon starting at $3.
---
Tormented bracelet is nice too, if you are just focused on banging out Slayer levels to do high Slayer level bossing instead of like wildy bosses or vork/zulrah I'd get either prims/pegs/tormented and keep up the hussle! The world is your oyster.
---
Specifically the context i guess.. Like when it says "Jagex is powerless over a PvP clan." That one leaves me in the dark
---
Join akira28 we are a mix of pvm skilling and just memers. Youll see easily who the skillers transitioning into pvmrs are such as myself trying to get diaries done and stuff its a fun little spot

That's awesome! Grats brotha'

Don‚Äôt worry brother, I‚Äôm with you.

Thx
---
I guess I see what you mean, but it hardly seems true that theyre ‚Äúharder‚Äù to kill. Theyre probably worse pkers though so im not sure.. either way to each to own, It just seems to me that its a bit harsh considering theyre only playing cause they depend on the coins to live irl. 
---
Are they pking as well? In that case its alright
---
Someone trades bots

Thnx bro!

Getting anchor on my pure always hated quests but working towards anchor and the quest line ended up being somewhat enjoyable and nostalgic 
---
Short answer is you can really play however the hell you want. It's a game, you should do what you find fun. 
---
With that being said, I find that since your goal seems rather vague (do you have a specific boss in mind, or do you just want to unlock late game content in general?) I recommend you do 1:1, since most of the game is unlocked through quests and that way once you eventually decide on what content you want to do, it'll likely be unlocked already (plus unlocking things as you go might give you ideas on what to do, what seems fun, etc.), however quest rewards will not suffice to get your levels up to what you need for bossing. You WILL have to do some plain ol' grinding as well. If you enjoy quests like me (I do all quests without a guide, it's a ton of fun), you'll also find that getting a quest cape won't take that long, and by the time you're done with it, you'll just barely have breached into endgame content. I don't do raids yet, but I can do most bosses; the bosses I can't do are mostly locked by my slayer level still (78) but I'm having fun grinding out the levels now that quests are done.
---
At lvl 60 combats you can do most quests except the really high end ones like MM2 and DS2, so I recommend you do quests as you feel like doing them (I recommend against "rushing" or "grinding out" quests as that makes them less fun - just alternate training and questing), and in all likelihood by the time you finish every quest that's not DS2 and MM2 you'll be ready, or close to ready to doing those as well.
---
Oh and, I also recommend you work on your diaries, as they unlock a lot of cool perks that will make everything easier (I have all Hard diaries done, my current goal is all elites, but that'll be a while).
---
Magic isn't really ever worth it in an average scenario. it's best kept for enemies that are weak to it and that have good enough drops to pay for it, such as barrows, bosses, etc. or one-off quest monsters. It's fine to train it with just fire strike up to mid-low levels, but beyond that, you'll find you'd much rather hit for 10-20's with your melee/range than hit 8's with your magic. If you complete Family Crest, you'll unlock gauntlets that boost the damage of "bolt" spells which makes using fire bolt reasonably worth it, but even tend, most people unlock it too late for its usefulness.
---
I‚Äôm currently 50kc dry at Barrows. I kill every brother and kill enough mobs to get 100% everytime. I noticed a lot of other people running barrows are killing the mobs. Is there something I am missing here?
---
It does look that way, huh? I have 39 prayer, but it is so slow to level up! how do I get it up?
---
Straight fact

I never had parents

This trade is no different than the Mexican-American Drug trade.  Americans funnel money back into Mexico/Venezuela because the profits are so extreme compared to their home currency.

real talk. i want something like soul wars to drop in OSRS. something fun and enjoyable that's still pvp but has more worthwhile rewards than castle wars.

"yet they thought the vote would pass the poll, and all already developed content"
---
Are you ok? Why is Jagex devloping content that hasnt passed the poll??
---
They're better than my elites by 120k every time tho
---
New players that afk and are interpreted as being bots?
---
Keep at it! Make sure to watch all the videos you can, and also try out the Jad Simulator (Rune Apps on Google) for getting used to the pray switches.  
---
I only did it once on the unrestricted world (didn't want to waste money on my first try) and ended up messing up my switches. But since I made it that far with no problems, I decided to do it on a real world. And sure enough I got it, with supplies left over too!
---
So fucking cringe
---
&gt;no because re-rolls still dont make sense logically
---
Since when does that matter in RS?
---
&gt;and clues dont need any buffs, plenty of people already do clues
---
So what? I want to be able to complete master clues just for the fun of it and I can't without raising my defense.
---
You can join Akira28 its a small clan my stats are about yours maybe a little higher but we have a good mix of our levels and high lvls doing raids. Most of us that around the same level have a little thing where we try to one up each other when it comes to diaries and quest but its all for fun and even help out with quest or diaries. I my self have had a great time in the CC and once im higher level theyre even willing to teach me COX so join us itll be fun we are nice and we are memers which is most important

hide your pin on your posts smh

Actually tho. Couldn't you put an offer in for a bond for all your cash.  It would insta buy at normal price and then be locked behind your pin
---
Rs3 looks toxic
---
I have no problem communicating with anyone. It seems like you entirely missed my point. Of course there's segregation. Just look at the news and the mass media. It's right in front of you. I don't need your judgement and only your ego thinks your judgement is correct. 
---
Why would you cut oak for money? 
---
So this is not the actual ingame model, right? This looks like it has way better deformations than the ingame osrs models which seem to just have limbs clipping through each other.
---
part of the issue is the duel arena is not nearly as accessible and theres still a fair amount of  player learned things you can do to increase your odds there such as stance swapping so theres a barrier to entry, osrs needs a money dump gambling method that is easier to access than the duel arena and is available at the GE. But Jagex doesnt want to take responsibility. 
---
wow holy shit
---
We get it the other kids at school are all super liberal and they don‚Äôt like you no matter how hard you try so you‚Äôre s cool edgy conservative kid to counter their culture

Imagine a pet Nex if that got added. Literally just a sex-slave succubus to follow you around.

Might be a little tight though.

*cough* pubg
---
Isn't it funny how you got downvoted for being logically correct? It's cool dude, don't think your wrong because of the weak emotional people. Always stay true to the truth regardless what the HERD thinks and FEELS. 
---
Yeah, oaks probably aren‚Äôt the most profitable.  Farming can add up pretty quickly though and it doesn‚Äôt take a ton of effort to really get going. 
---
I don't care about pvp. Never had, and never will.

I care

I looked into it. And you cannot get banned for buying gold. But thanks for the concern.

I really hate that they added the outfit to such a horrid minigame.

Huh, I thought they were weak to stab this whole time myself. Whoops. Lol

Good for you

Me too! How would you feel if they simply upped the rewards for castle wars?

.......................................

I feel like having this much money would make the game not fun

It's called Fashionscape, Honey
---
Well I was F2p lol. 
---
I'm not arguing about whether Jagex is right or wrong. What I'm arguing about is who people direct their anger at. The Jagex CEO is not seeing any reddit front page crab memes, and all we're doing is flooding the rs community with this weird (and in my opinion, slightly toxic, albeit possibly necessary) form of protesting the company's management structure.
---
*Kanye Shrug*

Thanks babe

The way he worded it it‚Äôs impossible to know if he means his first Hellhound task or his first Hellhound task after reaching 91 Slayer. Since I know you‚Äôre just re-using the last insult you seen someone else use on Reddit; I‚Äôm going to help you out. Autism is when someone struggles to respond ‚Äúnormally‚Äù in social interactions. Now I want you to re-read his post carefully and realize that without proper punctuation it‚Äôs impossible to know exactly what he meant. In case you‚Äôre not familiar with punctuation those can include commas, periods, parentheses, etc. I am glad to enlighten another child on the internet that thinks he‚Äôs smart but is rather dull in reality. If you need help with anything else feel free to @ me. 
---
Miserable people are miserable people.
---
The worst it does is make it harder for legitimate players to find profit from green dragons, but they have many other choices. If anything, it may in the end be a bigger benefit because people will be able to train prayer and crafting cheaper. I'm not sure how much gold green dragons drop, but that may be an additional issue but I don't even know if they drop gold, or if gold farmers pick it up.
---
I remember there was a few month period where gold farmers were getting banned left and right, and the prices of dragon bones went up nearly 3x, and players were actually upset about this. In the end, I guess too many innocent Venezuelan players were getting caught in the bans, and they stopped whatever they were doing.

5 year old are 5 year old. Unless it‚Äôs this sub then 20 year olds are 5 year olds.
---
For Vorkath, you want blowpipe and BGS. You can try it at 80 Ranged but it might not be super efficient.
---
Yea with OSBuddy not being open source it does have a higher chance of pulling some shady stuff, especially with many OSBuddy users moving to Runelite, there's always the possibility of OSBuddy trying to cash out with shady tactics if it's worried that Runelite could take away too much of its business. Not pointing any blame at OSBuddy until something confirmed actually happens, but just saying it's certainly a possibility.

I've had Jmod replies on threads that have had very few upvotes but they were typically when I was calling out bugs (something that should be handled away from social media as well).
---
Only downside is people would spam it. You would want a level cap of some kind 
---
You sure torture is better than salve when speccing?
---
He's entirely not concerned and is probably annoyed like I am. Play the game, ya wannabe.  I hope buying that ruins it for you lmao. Also total bullshit you cut for 86 hours, I refuse to believe that.  Anyone who would buy gold wouldn't last that long doing anything on this game.

Ummm... yes!

I think a new player knows that those people are in combat with an enemy way lower level with them, aren't responding to them, and aren't doing or taking any damage. At best it looks like the game is buggy and glitched out, at worst it looks like the first thing you see in the game is that it's a facebook game where you come collect your experience/gold/gems every 6 hours except at least with those facebook games you can close them in between the 6 hours.
---
Runescape gold farming can be like 10 bucks an hour, that is good in any latin american country.

It's honestly kind of pathetic that this experience has had me so stressed out and feeling powerless. It's just a game. But I haven't been able to focus on any of my work this weekend due to it. A lot of people in the last thread were calling BS, that's to be expected I don't fault them for it, but people like you and plenty of other people who have been supportive and kind and given advice: it really means a lot to me. 
---
It's like this whole time, Jagex gave us no customer support on purpose. It's like deep down, they knew that we had it inside of ourselves all along. We are the customer support..support group. A support group for customers, traumatized by the 1337 h4x0rs of gilenor. 
---
Sorry Jagex, it's just a joke. I love you. $11 tho. Gonna go cry now and wait for my account to disappear.
---
This from [my line](https://runescape.backstreetmerch.com/tag/angels-scapes) with the official merch store! Restocks &amp; new designs are currently underway, I‚Äôll update on those when I can. 
---
Just here to remind everyone that the staking "addicts" are the drastic minority of the people at the duel arena, and it isn't the staking that "ruined their lives", it's their gambling addiction. Don't blame the platform, blame the individuals who can't control themselves when placing a bet. If it wasn't staking then it likely would have been something far more harmful. Even at the highest end of staking in OSRS you're only ever better $1000-$4000. That's a tiny amount compared to what people risk outside of OSRS.
---
He mentioned it at the end, but those individuals do need to seek help, but it's not OSRS's fault for having a mini-game where people can fight each other and place bets on themselves.
---
He could have done this video well, but he just threw out some anecdotes about some guys who broke the rules of the game and purchased coins. I don't personally know a single person who purchases their gold they stake with, they either solo/dolo raids or grind Duradel, and come the weekend they throw down some stakes. The people he's talking about are a tiny minority of very troubled people.
---
Be careful that Freddo doesnt come for you
---
Jagex sends the merch np but won't send contest prizes smh

A fresh batch is in production currently, these will be back!

‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have a lot of money‚Äù dude, you‚Äôre blowing enchanted bolts on dragons.  also, they‚Äôre METAL‚Äîtheir highest defensive stat is Range, with their lowest being Magic.
---
Yeah when I get the itch, I'll stake. If I start losing large amounts, I buy bonds to replenish the losses and then tell myself "I'll just pretend I didn't lose anything", but then I also tell myself "but if I stake this and win, I can make back everything". Then I lose the new gold and buy more bonds again to cover that loss.
---
Fortunately I only work with small amounts like 20m stakes and stuff. No 1B stakes to totally fuck me just yet.
---
Literally the only reason I do them [stares in 38m farm xp without pet]

Free for all HCIM that lost their lives from this.

Someone‚Äôs got penis issues... go away child
---
Coming from /r/all lmao. On a serious note, I hope you get your acc back man. I've never played Runescape, but I've played and invested my time into many others to know the feeling. May I ask how you got hacked?
---
Bounty hunter was farmed by bots. Pvp, although niche, is still a community. Whether it be legacy or EoC fighting it has its members :o Legacy is less bursty than OSRS pvp these days lmfao.
---
God damn it Jagex just because we meme that social media shouldn't be your customer support doesn't mean you should ditch it completely, it's your ONLY customer support ffs.
---
Something is wrong
---
How's osrs PvP doing?
---
Shame people are down voting you but literally this and Venezuela is another failed example.
---
HEY JAGEX HELP THIS GUY, ALSO REMEMBER 
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä REDDIT SHOULDN'T BE YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
TIL venesuelans don't use OSB
---
I was wondering why the views spiked suddenly
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä Jagex staff won't respond to this thread ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä 
---
You can put 2fa on your account but that can be removed in under a week. So if you are on holiday you are out of luck. I haven't even gotten a notification that 2fa was being removed.
---
I'm going to be doing blood runecrafting pretty soon. That was the best guide I've seen, thank you.
---
No. You‚Äôre fine. He can get over it
---
That's what I told the hacker was in my bank...I was lying.
---
Help this guy. Getting hacked fucking sucks. I know myself and many others have experienced a similar thing and it‚Äôs just such a saddening thing to experience even if its ‚Äújust a game‚Äù
---
No matter how much we beg, Jagex is never going to give proper customer support.
---
Lmfao dude this actually made me lol
---
Upvoted, hope you win the Jagex Customer support slot machine
---
Quit it, botting bans can be delayed and you've barely played it. Not worth it.
---
This is terrifying :/
---
Happened to me as well last week. Account was recovered and 50m bank was cleaned. My account was then used as a green dragon farmer/Bot. I had two step on both my RS account AND email. They changed both password and auth on the account. There is literally nothing stopping hackers from getting into your account. I had been away for a while and wanted to pickup osrs again. QUIT immediately.
---
Happy cake day
---
They should make Tinder for runescape players so that I can have more local friends that I don't interact with physically
---
Yeah I was under the impression it was 0.7-0.75 USD per mil gp. I'm not too well versed on the subject though.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard a success story about Jagex customer service. I‚Äôm wishing you look OP.

---
Thanks for your support here. I made a new update thread, if you fancy checking it out. No good news, I'm afraid. Yet.
---
As the playerbase keeps getting whittled down you're left with a more and more delusional playerbase that don't want to accept their game is dying because it's garbage. 
---
Up you go bro. Ive got no words... to see this sad joke of jagex support still continuing should honestly never be acceptable. I hope your account gets saved.
---
oh cool thanks man
---
Wut?
---
Oh man really I bought a 3 month membership.
---
Doubt it. Wouldn't want the potential new playerbase find out about this shit would they? The game is growing very fast since the release of the mobile app and that would definitely slow it down. 
---
What happened to your account? The same thing happened to me long ago, and the ban was quashed and they returned the account to me. I'm sure you can probably get the same result I did that time. This time I may not get so lucky though. Even if the hacker got your account banned, you can get that reversed potentially if they decide that you were not the one doing the botting or whatever.
---
Honestly your best option. Get some imbues done while you're there.
---
c'mon man.. was this really necessary? don't be a dick, sure he might have been able to put more security measures in place, but what's done is done, no need to say something like this..
---
I need level 5 in everything for elite diary and don‚Äôt really care about being the most efficient team so I might be down to help y‚Äôall out

You can join "BrutalityPVM", for daily raids, some gwd and clan-Events! Just post an app on the RS Forums if you want.
---
survive being 5 min tbed against a team? trolling?
---
Damn, goodluck getting your account back! I really hope jagex will take a look at this.
---
Sorry I couldn't hold it in I gotta go laugh with my friend mod jed
---
good luck man, been following your posts best i can with hopes you would post something good. it pains me to see how little they care for dedicated paying players. from what im seein, i had better luck with swtor support. ive done the recovery here before and just made a new account. i couldnt remember what date i joined or internet service i had at the time. sad we cant tie our phone numbers in as an added layer of recovery. 
---
The Jmods even said on a Q&amp;A stream that 1m was waaaaay more than you would ever normally pay him to get in over your time in rs, but people would still drop the gp just for the convenience.
---
Jagex is a joke of a company
---
Honestly, in todays age of tinder, it really is not difficult to get sex if you're just normal looking and take care of your body just a little bit. A lot of people havent seemed to realize this yet and treat sex as this holy opportunity you must jump at, any time it presents itself.
---
This kinda making me a bit sad 
---
Honestly shit like this is why I stopped playing. Your entire account's progression shouldn't be on the line because some fuckhead got into your account.
---
Jagex do your job
---
I'm glad I bought my bones for 99 prayer before the prices shot up an extra 300gp ea!
---
It's quite sobering to see how much they affect the economy of the game. 
---
&gt;Mobile App
---
Makes sense now. Wow this shit is corrupt. 
---
I doubt anyone at Jagex who could change that ever takes a peek here
---
Yeah wtf all she had to do to get in his pants was play some Runescape. Women these days dont put in any effort.

Make an alt and trade literally everything, and die at zulrah with your untradeables, make it hard for the hacker and  save ur bank
---
Upvoted even though I don't play this game anymore but I feel your pain.
---
This is really cool. I've brewed chefs delight on and off for years in game, I remember unlocking 'the stuff' what a revolutionary substance!
---
u/brodaki what do you have to say to this?
---
We do both.
---
And the "original owner" would be threatening to loot and pillage the account why exactly? The "original owner" is also trying to scam people in OPs friends list. Even IF that person is the original owner he has no business playing on that account and you should lock it. What the fuck are you even doing man?
---
It's Zamorak BTW, but yeah that's BIS (except the magic ammy) for F2P magic.
---
Since when was 2K total considered shit stats?
---
Not all pures tho, and it's a short walk to get out away from them
---
OP's liar, read Jmod response lmaoo
---
Hespori looks like Groot
---
I agree. This is getting to some soap opera type drama as we speak

I actually feel bad for you, I can feel the panic from your replies now. gl brother my account got perm banned in the past and I had to play the reddit game with jmods too.

you need to be appealing not posting on social media. how many appeals have you sent and gotten denied? what are the denies for.

im a fairly casual player and im 80 melees... i can wear literally every item in the game, the only reason i dont is because i can't afford it

i'm pretty sure it's the same for 90% of people too

Plot twist: Mod Ash was watching everything in-game invisible or a random lvl1 man walking back n forth

Wtf is that attached gif, that looks awful. Why does it look like some fucking bionicle shit

fuck you jagex, this is fucking disgusting
---
Smacked.
---
Well, a mod said it was, and I'll believe them over you 
---
Is it some sort of right of passage that every noob has to post a picture when they get a fire cape? Jesus christ.

lmao
---
First time I feel my comment will be part of r/bestof before the mods lock the thread.
---
Dude I don't have a single 99 or impressive achievement I'm not tryna show anyone shit. I'm just trying to say that Ironman being only to challenge yourself and not to show off anything is ridiculous that's the reason why tons of people do it.

Admitted to account sharing. Lol.
---
his individual stats are garbage, not max combat, not 99 crafting, low slayer, 77 prayer, total level padded out by junk stats like farming fletching and hunter
---
i wouldn't take his account for free
---
Although I understand and admire your love for the fellow player, I do not think that Jagex cares about 1 player not-paying anymore.
---
I hope he will get his password back / changed before it is too late!
---
Great ,now do it to Sandstorm 
---
How so? How do the screenshots make any sense whatsoever. This is the second time this person has hacked my account, but the first was when there was almost no wealth on the account at all. I've been playing on this account in the USA for 1.2 years, aside from it being hijacked once, and will be back on March 16 to the place of account creation. I don't even care if I get it back right now, at this point screw the bank. This is my 2k total account that I've been working on day and night for so long. Goddamn this hurts to read. All I want is for the account to be locked until the decision can be made. 
---
I still have zero correspondence from jagex via email or whatever. Why would the original owner be moving wealth off of the account, extorting me, and threatening to drop untradeables? It's insane that they would come to this conclusion without looking at this. Just tell me what information I need aside from making a recovery request at the exact location of account creation. FFS it's an email login and I STILL have access to that original email. The hacker DOES NOT. Wouldn't that prove it then and there?
---
yeah, that seems reasonable. the guy that is threatening to drop all untradeables is the rightful owner of the account? seems legit
---
Honestly 7 days should be the default bank pin delay. Best of luck man I really hope a mod checks their tweets soon or reddit!
---
Oh shit this just got real
---
this is a yikes
---
Oh shit. This might just be amazing.

I cant wait for a more full explanation of one comes. Hooooly shhheeeeit

Na, his mouse moves perfectly flat back and forth every time and seems to always click the exact same spot ingame, (like the x click marker shows up on vorkath) away from where the actual mouse is
---
Oh fuck this is spicy 
---
Yeah I dont know, just linking the mod reply...this makes no sense to me.
---
Do you realize how much your comment makes you look self-absorbed?
---
I have a raging boner for all JMods rn. Thanks for the entertainment. 
---
What shitty support.. 
---
Your hearts in the right place, but not paying your $11 a month will have zero impact on jagex. Even if 100 people stopped paying it wouldn't make any odds. You'd have to somehow convince 70% of the playerbase to stop paying membership in order to achieve what you're wanting to achieve.
---
This is Woox alt no way a normal huu-man discovered this 
---
Tbf I sold my account for ¬£5 to a mate at school when I was like 12, tried to recover it when I started playing again like 8-10 years later. Recovery got outright denied, they said while they could see I played the account at one stage I wasn‚Äôt the original creator. When I certainly was. 
---
I believe you.
---
&gt;x = y then y = x
---
 i mean
---
yeah...
---
"i can't assist you" is a lie. You can, but you have decided not to. Seeing how much traction this whole problem has gathered, wouldn't it make sense to at least remove the 'time' sensitive portion of this issue and lock the account so as to give a more thorough investigation and hopefully not ruin someone's experience with osrs forever?
---
All I'm saying in the end is to tread carefully on this one because you have a lot of eyes on you. 
---
How is this mobile? 
---
And you can‚Äôt lock the account in the meantime while this ordeal is sorted out?
---
we were "negotiating" me just giving him money in exchange for the account back. And he was also just trying to get me to give him the bank pin and he promised he wouldn't take anything from the bank, he would give me the account back with the wealth still on it, he just wanted to know if i was lying about the bank value amount when he asked me. He was just trying to steal the bank. 
---
LMFAO
---
bruh_sound_effect_#2.mp3

thats's what I mean brother, I've been lurking here for years and this isn't the first questionable JMod smackdown I've seen. this is fishy as hell
---
No its not, you get the stale baguette from the mystey box quiz random event. 
---
you might have made a lot of progress on the account since you bought it from him.  
---
Still doesn't change the fact that he is the original owner.
---
Still trying to figure out wtf that is supposed to mean.

I know quests are vital to account progression. Doing them burns me out very quickly though. How can I motivate to keep questing.
---
I never played this game but this whole is really getting me excited. Hope for quick reply from u/brodaki
---
Have fun waiting lmfao
---
I literally spent 5-10 minutes going through your post history on your account and there is very strong circumstantial evidence countering multiple claims you‚Äôve made tonight. I would be willing to be you weren‚Äôt in England, in fact I would wager you‚Äôve never left the USA for longer than a day or two.
---
What do you plan on doing if jagex just ignores you? Surely you won't make a new account and just continue
---
Yo did you see the smackdown? He actually wasn't the original owner, the jmods also locked the second account he was messaging from as he wasn't the owner of it either. Turns out he was lying this whole time
---
The smackdown he just got was beautiful
---
That screenshot proves nothing. You gave a small snippet of a conversation. 
---
Slayer
---
So is the person who hacked your account a clan mate you previously shared your account with?
---
He just got jmod smackdowned, wasn't his account 
---
too bad the community is too addicted to the game to boycott it 
---
2x F
---
Thank you so much. 
---
If you wanna train melee efficiently, get full obsidian, obby sword, berserker necklace, and berserker ring (i). You can also use that money to train up prayer and range, then get a firecape.
---
Uh sounds like a bug. Like with what happened with the tbow. Does it keep happening?
---
My $11 put to good use. 
---
Can someone explain how exactly they know if youve created the account or not?  Like what if someone created their account at a friends house 15 years ago? 
---
OP is claiming that he travels back and forth from the u.k. and the states.  Do they know based on I.p. address?  
---
Hijacker has changed the email with security questions
---
TL:DR: OP is stupid. 
---
goteem
---
Waiting for him to finally admit you‚Äôre right. He‚Äôs just spitting in our faces saying he didn‚Äôt buy it... does he think everyone that plays this game is fucking stupid?
---
I‚Äôd say this is inaccurate, only because I‚Äôm almost 100% sure from the way that OP is acting that he bought *stolen* accounts, meaning that the original owners weren‚Äôt taking shit, they were getting back what they already owned.
---
I cannot do Zulrah so cannot comment on that.
---
I do have experience with vorkath though.
---
Aim to get 75 Def/80-85 Range before starting. You‚Äôll still be able to kill him at your current level but you run the risk of wasting a whole inventory of supplies and not getting a kill the odd time if you mess up.
---
Blowpipe, BGS and Void is what I use. Imbued B Ring and A Ring. Accumulator until you get head for assembler. Possible boot switch although not necessary (I use D‚Äôhide). Salve (ei) amulet. Obviously elite void is a nice upgrade so work towards that although not necessary to start. Rune pouch helps to save inventory space (take dusts, laws and chaos). For your first few kills it might be worth taking a one click teleport just in case.
---
Then just learn the different attacks. Always keep run OFF but when you see the fireball attack hold control to run out the way of it (I hope you already know of the control the run feature but if not it‚Äôs very helpful here). 
---
Apart from that it‚Äôs all down to practice practice practice. Vorkath isn‚Äôt that difficult mechanically to fight but his range and poison attack can hit 30s so you can be fine one second and dead the next. Once you get your moves down he is a piece of cake.
---
Good luck!

---
OP bought 2 accounts which were both recovered by original owner who decided to fuck with OP in PMs
---
This is why checking your e-mail and passwords at https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a super important thing to do. A few weeks ago I got around to deleting my old email that had been leaked in 10+ massive leaks after changing accounts to my new email. 
---
The JMODs have spoken, I'd stop digging yourself a deeper hole and just stop trying to "prove yourself as the owner". I'm sure along with thousands of other players that the jmods know what they're doing when it comes to account recovery and if they've found it to not be your account then it probably isn't yours. 
---
I'm not sure how much the "exact place of account creation" comes into recovery of accounts since that means the instant you move house, you've lost ownership to that account and I would highly doubt jagex keep track of where each and every account was created (or if they even have that information in the first place)
---
Basically, just stop.
---
Wait... metal dragons aren‚Äôt weak to stab? My life is a lie.

---
If your bank is only 50m and he‚Äôs going to get into the bank reguardless.. why not save your account and just give him the bank pin?? If he said he just wants to see if your lying about the value.. then what‚Äôs the harm?? You‚Äôd be saving all your shit and get your account back.. seems like a no brainer, since I‚Äôm what, 5h he will have access to it anyways...  unless you did lie about it, which sucks for you... seems like the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù is fucking with you..
---
Honestly it seems like they handled this one well, they said they fixed the situation in the comments. That‚Äôs some GGG-level engagement right there
---
That‚Äôs not why people get hacked 
---
Good doggie
---
You never post in r/2007scape except for this one incident
---
People change, I haven't heard him say anything like that since I started watching him. Plus, he's more entertaining than most other OSRS content creators, excluding papa settled.
---
They don't hold your credit card information, a third party does.
---
Also, the double exp twitch streams were fake.
---
Blows my mind how people are still upvoting OP's thread and comments after jagex laid the smackdown twice....
---
Threads like this end in one of two ways: either J-Mod smacks down OP or OP gets vindicated. Either way people tend to want to know the outcome so it gets popular really quickly.
---
I think that mainly relates to making stupid decisions like account sharing or using easy passwords in general without using 2fA. Even with all that it is still possible but I think most of the people claiming to get hacked have some more history that can explain why they were hacked. At the moment, I don't think that buying a membership will cause you to get hacked but just be careful when using your account. Meaning use a hard af password, set a unique bank pin, use 2fa and then buy a membership. Better safe than sorry.
---
So the hacker probably has a main account. He wants to get more wealth on that, not this one, so he either cleans you out and transfers or extorts out for more gold and then transfers. Since you either bought this account or shared it, this isn't too far of a leap to make.
---
sh'es just xp waste bro, you made the right decision
---
No hacking, OP bought 2 accounts with real money and they got recovered by the seller. Seller proceeded to troll OP in the messages he keeps bringing up 
---
Some next level hacking here. Pretend your account got hacked to have it manually recovered by a mod through reddit.
---
Again, no reason to believe you when multiple mods say you aren't the owner.
---
I dont even play RS no more, but this shit right here is why i keep coming back to the sub
---
Nah it's simple don't get hacked
---
Woah there Timmy let's calm down bud. Can I get you a juice box?
---
you just know
---
Hm did u buy law for? 500m
---
whos still watching in 2023? -__- 
---
I once saw people on rs3 fighting eachother and it was the most gay shit I ever saw
---
You probably bought his account, and he is having some fun with you
---
__I can't assist you because you did not create the account and it is now back with the original owner.__
---
It's over. You fucked up. Cya back on tutorial island kid.
---
Hmm maybe this type of mindset will lead to Jagex fixing account security and adding 2fa delay.
---
If people start thinking that it is not safe to buy membership because of account hacks (even though it is unrelated) and Jagex makes less money than I am sure we would see a quick fix.
---
Can I get an F in chat for OP
---
or cant use symbols in the password field!?!? what year is this?
---
Shot for the reply, i have a bit of additional info...
---
I checked my old emails and saw my account name that i used to pay membership for.  When i log in to OSRS with that email address, my username is different (I understand that, i changed my username). NOW the exciting part, when i check hiscores on OSRS, my old username name shows up but not the changed username.. if you follow me. I definitely jammed OS, RS3 fucked me off.
---
Hence why I took care to specify my fl - I'm sure there are a handful of people including you guys interested in it but you're in the minority  as far as that goes. Decimation is gonna spike in price lmao.

It won't really do much, if people have that story of access to your account. You're kind of fked and it's a waiting game before you get hacked. 
---
Oh, another one of these threads. 
---
Audibly laughed when I saw that was the Twitter handle 
---
Hate to say I told you so. 
---
&gt; another victim
---
Posts like that are the reason people think Jagex's customers support is shit. So many people claiming they've been banned unrightfully for macroing or RWT or claiming that there's a hacker on their account.. The majority of all those posts on reddit are untruthful. It takes a lot of manpower for Jagex to work outside their ticketing system on individual cases like this. Unfortunately, there will always be unique cases that do need individual attention from a JMod and that's hard to get outside the official website.

Anguish and Torture are both fantastic

It really depends on what you want to achieve on OSRS.
---
What's your current gear? Wouldn't reccomend going for zenyte jewelry if your normal gear isn't too good.
---
"Do you realise how much your comment makes you look self-absorbed?"
---
"Because this is fun for me"
---
Hey, wait a minute
---
im pretty sure you did the math wrong, i came to the conclusion ist 50/50
---
Yup, this is exactly why you shouldn't share or buy an account. 
---
It baffles me that the community thinks that account sharing is perfectly fine and allowed by Jagex. While in reality it heavily compromises the account's security and is in fact [officially against the rules](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules). While on the other hand they also blame Jagex for poor account security. 
---
Sure, there are areas where Jagex can and should improve, but the vast majority of cases it's the users fault. Threads like these do not help with us getting better security features, such as Jagex giving us more control about our recovery process. 
---
If anything these threads show Jagex that we're all idiots that can not be trusted. After all, if we're willingly compromise our account, why should they give us new security features? Threads like these also try to gain sympathy from the community and Jagex, eventually we'll become numb to them and real players who actually need support will not get any. Which kinda seems to happen already.
---
I honestly don't know what Jagex can do at this point. It's extremely difficult for them to introduce new security features, as they don't know who the original owner is. If it's bought, shared or hijacked at the time they introduce a new and effective security feature the original owner might never be able to recover their account. 
---

How does jagex know your the original owner? Account was created before email logins were a thing and by now ip/computer changed multiple times over.

After that I was wondering, do I count as the original creator of my irl friends accs because they made them on my pc 12-14years ago when I introduced them to the game? 
---
I just slimmed enough to conclude you're a hyper emotional person and the fact I can make you this upset is actually somewhat pitiful.

Better off buying membership at 7/11 or amazon

I have a custom built computer that can run Fortnite and battlefield and things similar in full detail with no lag yet soon as I run osrs on rune lite I'm lucky if I hit 25fps ü§£

Or just only withdraw what you need. A quick withdraw x followed by "1m" or "10m" or however much you need.
---
I just checked and it was not active. I'm sure I did not disable it and my account isn't so good that's worth stealing so I guess it was disabled by Jagex itself during one of their rollbacks or maybe it has an expiration date? Don't know but yikes I don't feel very protected like this

Yep because people running these sort of bots would never lie right? imagine how naive you have to be to believe they tell you the right odds
---
&gt; I've toyed with several of these bots using a martingale betting system and have always came out on top, if it were rigged how am I up 20m?
---
Using anecdotal evidence but calls this sub retarded lmao
---
Nah I'm just having fun.  I'm in bed, drunk, cant sleep comfy semi numb and you're entertaining. 
---
:D
---
I see what you're saying, yeah that makes sense.
---
Have Aussie servers been fixed?
---
Mine have been like this all day on Runey and it‚Äôs fine for every other game
---
You're allowed to think that. I think he is, and I'm obviously not alone.
---
Graceful set is not a flex, that's something every main account should have 
---
Ok yeah anecdotal evidence is worthless in the face of baseless speculation you are right.  So right in fact the mere fact that i'm up another 10m must just be a fluke right?
---
Fuck it ima have one last morhdul for yeam.
---
&gt; You can go to real casino, get 20k up and leave, 
---
Real casinos are regulated these bots could be doing shady stuff to make money and not tell you, for you to be right you are assuming they are not lying, which is highly unlikely.
---
I honestly did 40-99 in a day or 2
---
Honestly girls that are very easy are a turn off to me. I'm way over that phase of pussy. Once you understand the game, you just do your own thing in life and pussy will magnify its self to you without even trying. but of course sometimes you want to try because it's somewhat fun

Chat is what makes bottom teams worth watching. Imagine watching a 100t game without the chat.

I truly want to believe Brodaki, but his story is too inconsistent for me to believe. Generally I value a JMod's response more as well, as they are (more) objective.
---
I'm just hoping that Jagex understands what he's saying. I mean, he claims that he made the account in the UK and is currently in the USA and has been for several months. Jagex takes the location in to consideration when recovering an account. Given that the location is significantly different he's at a disadvantage. If this 'hijacker' happens to be in the UK and roughly knows the same details, Jagex will tend to believe them over Brodaki. 
---
Just unlock the side entrance for 5000 trading sticks.

It's even that a large difficulty of textual matter can be rather daunting to interpret in its totality, so it is at all minutes adviced to keep on your remarks clipped and to the degree and abstain active on a tan and you'll be more presumptive to stay fresh the mental faculty of the pedagogue. Plainly this doesn't meanspirited that you should boot out worth fixes of accusals in your mention as that would be causal agency the man of the cloth of your commentary to be missinformed or even up misled. It's life-and-death to find out a middle tie wherever you anticipate you've reason out a dependable Libra the Balance 'tween the extent of a note and the duration of the contents you're difficult to impart. If you do nevertheless compose large difficulties of text edition don't be goggle-eyed that a educator doesn't forebode it in its totality and strength explain on your bemused gossip without all the accumulations necessary to evince a fitting and valueable upshot. If this haps don't be displeased and decidedly do not be demoralised to commentary once again. If this finds oftentimes you could add thing known as a tl;dr. This continues for "To Longish; Didn't Anticipate". This is largely put-upon to kick in scholarly people an selection on what they deficiency verbalize and how so much they lack to forebode. A tl;dr oft endeavours to discover your interpret in a make full (mayhap two), but unquestionably do ne'er go on a tan! The use of a tl;dr is wholly nonobligatory and there's no prerequisites ever so to reckon one, but it is oft gratifying. So in mental object, accommodate your mentions piece of land and to the bespeak, like I do.

TL;DR: Affirmative, I agree.

Did you not see what I said? I said the more I thought about it the more I realized the whole "You bought the account thing" makes sense, to an extent, aside from the screenshots and aside from the email thing. The email the account was created with. It's ten years old. I created the email. Ten years ago. I have emails in that account in my name going back ten years. Way before the osrs account was created. How would that be possible in the slightest if I bought the account?

Also enable 2fa for your email and change the pass there. If someone disabled authenticator on your account they must have had acces to your email and deleted the email confirming it.

Or its a major fuck up by jagex again hwo knows.

If You r wearing a d chain I would really recommend to get a fighter torso as it have the same str bonus as a bcp. Upgrade legs to obby legs and get a b ring and imbue it. Then with the rest of the money u can maybe put them on a buyable skills tht u lack the level for a quest.

Is it possible for your account to be bugged so that you never receive rare drops? I'm currently 120 barrows chests in without a drop. 
---
I've played pretty casually over the last four years and don't think I've ever received a drop. I've always put it down to horrible RNG but I'm starting to think the account might be buggered.

Pure's can already enter Meyerditch &amp; ape atoll if you don't finish quest. Slayer block list can already be reached at 200 QPs for pures. As for 1 extra block, you'd unlock way more monsters reaching 250 qp's than the block is worth. (Suqahs, elves, fever spiders, cave horrors, etc.)

---
In regards to acc sharing being bannable, Jagex has said that while it is against the rules, they won‚Äôt take action against people doing it unless it threatens game integrity. Examples being stuff like getting someone to do The Inferno, or Fight Caves for you.
---
Already done buddy! But good advice nonetheless!

I know you're just saying that to be meta but it's not the case. And this question would never pass im a million years.

Not Rune drags necessarily. It's more likely to be blast furnace rune bars. (And partially revenants too(
---
At the very least they should make some way for people to contact support for other issues than billing. Not sure where they would go from there. 
---
I always wondered why people played RS3. No one plays OSRS for the glorious combat and details. There‚Äôs real MMO‚Äôs for that.

Possibly the account with the most wealth on it but doubt hes the wealthiest player.  Most high wealth players spread their wealth over multiple accounts making it pretty hard to estimate how much wealth everybody has. Also stakers can fluctuate in account wealth quite a bit.
---
Yeah exactly, and OSRS is the other way around. Play both games for the best of both worlds.

I killed 160 of these yesterday and didn‚Äôt get s single clue

Shit they're on to us!

So which one do you have arthritis or carpal tunnel?
---
The thing is, Jmods have so many tools that actually confirm details that they'll see on their computers. You continuing to complain to them won't make those tools change the outcome. You're done lol. They've proven you fucked up in one way or another. Move on and maybe try to play honestly this time around. 
---
Same man. How am I supposed to farm reddit karma? 
---
That is a spicey accusation, as someone new to rs, could you show me the evidence? 
---
That's fine man, I appreciate it. I don't blame anyone for being skeptical. By the way, the second account Weath locked, we already recovered it and got it back. I'm on it right now. He tried to insinuate it was mine and I bought it or something.

Ooh, examples? This would be awesome for a ton of reasons. I love using something similar on twitch to see banned users messages.

Don't forget to report the people that play for player-run games of chance.
---
Anything for publicity.
---
I'm going to nitpick and argue semantics here, but *technically* speaking it is against the rules under Real-world Trading.
---
Jagex their definition of RWT is:
---
&gt; [Game items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game.](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules)
---
They key part here is "within the game". RS3 and OSRS are both separate games at this point. RS3 currency does not exist within OSRS and OSRS currency does not exist within RS3. Therefore you're technically speaking breaking this rule, as you're trading ingame currency for something outside the game. 
---
Obviously Jagex doesn't enforce this, because they own both games and can check the data. More importantly they don't want to lose customers. 
---
Gotta commit to that bwaner

He does that on his stream yeah

Hilarious, I saw pathetic shit like this all the time when I was working tech support. "My account got hacked/there's a problem with your website and all my grades got changed or my assignments aren't going through." Kids like this don't realize that their bullshit only sounds convincing to themselves and their parents, then get pissed off when people don't believe them because they think they've crafted the perfect story. 
---
Having been in this position countless times, I feel bad for the JMods putting up with it, but it's hilarious to see the exact same behavior surrounding a fucking video game
---
This IS the same sub where you're a pussy if you don't like going into the wilderness with anything that ISN'T some form of "Pure" designed specifically for player killing.
---
I mean it's one thing if you just, don't want pvp, but we have an entire fanbase dedicated to maximizing their destructive potential while minimizing their personal risk. And they act like we're pathetic for NOT wanting to face them, as an average player. We know defense is shit tier, but we're not interested in being a pure.

Dae RS3 sucks guys? 
---
Subreddit full of thousands of people from different walks of life and varying opinions on things :thinking: i got it we're all just idiots and dont know what we want! Although the thing ur complaining about is not bipolar in the least, it makes sense if you think about the circumstances.
---
If you want to know why the subreddit is lambasting the idiot on the front page so hard after supporting him for a few days its because the reason still stands, Jagex's custom support is fucking trash. You HAVE to get noticed on the front page of reddit or be a notable member of the community to get any support, so people do the right thing and upvote requests so they can actually get seen and dealt with appropriately. 
---
Whether that be getting caught with your pants down like a idiot or actually getting some help, you have to do it in the public eye. Which leads to ridicule when you're proved to be an idiot or sympathy when you're not. The point stands this wouldn't be an issue if Jagex had more/actual people in place for this shit. Why did that guys emails/website query's go unnoticed for DAYS and when he FINALLY got a response it was over reddit, not email or website. Its a joke.
---
Lmao I remember trying Rs3 bounty hunter on day 1. EVERYONE was boosting right from the start. You would get a target then they immediately start pming you about buying/selling a kill.

More proof that this sub is filled with legitimate retards.  I have been here for going on 4 years and I've seen 1 actual post where the op isn't full of shit.  Yet everytime someone comes crying to reddit it gets upvoted to the front.  
---
Then the threads are filled with the same exact comments as the previous ones.  "WoW Security." "$11 a month." "Authenticator delay."  "Database leak."  "You have a RAT."  
---
No, you fucking idiots, the op is a liar.  Jagex is incompetent as shit, but goddamn if their player base doesn't have an average iq of 70.  The reason you think support doesn't work is because you keep getting baited by liars whose appeals have already been processed and denied.

You can just collect one inventory of the bag every time you fill it. No need for a bigger bag or for an emptying trip.

Good to know, let‚Äôs never put any valuable information on this joke of a forum :3
---
Because everyone and their dog wants to profit off players who want to skill up fast..
---
And because of all the heavily farmed materials that bots collect. I would estimate the bot players have over 90% of all the raw farmed materials in game, which they can then set the price however they see fit. 
---
How can they do this? They have all the materials they do whatever they want and jagex don‚Äôt give a flip.
---
Why do they do this? So you overpay for everything you need and they sell the gold you over payed on for bitcoin. Jamflex don‚Äôt care.
---
Does jamflex care? Obviously not.
---
Have fun..
---
This will make collecting toads so much faster!
---
Nah i dont mean like just using it willy nilly i meant more like the doctor giving you a couple tylenol 3s or something after say getting your wisdom teeth removed in case the patient is in extreme pain. Not sure if thats exactly what you were looking for but thats just how i see it
---
I agree. Imo, it's a win-win. Either the OP gets schooled by a JMod, or we legitimately get someone help. What's the damage being done by upvoting these?
---
Q
---
Unfortunately the minimum combat level requirement for pest control is level 40.
---
Oh for sure. Members was easier 10 or so years ago when I had less bills though 
---
If you are Dharoking than attack level is very important and strength is less important, you already hit high so you're helped most by hitting often.
---
tbh you need a ton of each to finish off the museum

Thought it was gonna be a lame '99 fishing on shrimp' video but pleasantly surprised
---
None that I'm aware of which is why I'm asking if anybody knows some sort of method that was maybe introduced with the newer content. The only actually reliable method is cleaning finds in the museum for xp lamps but it's so slow one couldn't achieve lvl 99 in a lifetime. Wondering how Swampletics (SPOILER) got his hunter to lvl 15, he's currently experimenting with force spawning randoms for xp lamps. But I'm honestly hoping to find something better hopefully. 
---
Safest way to effectively transfer is to buy rs3 bonds and redeem for membership which automatically applies to both osrs and rs3
---
99 hunter I can understand, but what method did you do for fishing to actually make any decent money

Wait you can see my password?!

First off, welcome back! And secondly Woox is a player than many people believe to be the top PVMer in the game currently. He has a majority of the solo world firsts for all new content. In addition he technically won the deadman competition a while back but his methods, while totally within the rules, were deemed unsportsmanlike (he just sat in a hut and ate food in the storm to stay alive instead of fighting). You can see a bunch of his videos on youtube if you are interested in soloing any of the end game content!
---
What..?
---
I don't like animation smoothing, so why would I want to watch it? xD
---
Can't you just... bring the exact amount of gold and free up a slot?
---
Since it's from the Jagex official store and all, i'm worried about purchasing it. If I was to buy it now, it would probably take about 7 months to arrive at my address. 
---
Or am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
No one cares about pures tho 
---
Ok! 
---
Well I‚Äôm glad I bought 1m worth last night 
---
It's as if they're legitimate issues and not just memes or something

---
Actual answer is not very much. I believe they're outclassed for crush damage by a few other weapons, and Torag's set bonus isn't very good. Much better off just selling them for the cash.
---
Can we revert death mechanics back to the way they were during launch, or at the very least make a 1-2 minute timer before loot appears for everyone? There is currently no risk involved, because when you die you have an hour to get back to your items, and even if you do make it back in time, those items wont appear for anyone.
---
There must be some way to fix it and not keep this ezscape with 0 risk, because it also feels like sort of a meme now, how everytime someone brings this up, we end up with "Muh ddosed worlds, no good, lose bank".
---
send me ur run energy an character face/helmet and im right on it!!!
---
Thank you uncle
---
It's unnecessary because the case sensitivity would stop .000000X% of accounts stolen. 
---
Sure thing, join the "Unbuckets" cc and say you came from reddit, I'll know who you are ;)
---
Whats unfair is a bug has ruined many players accounts because of someone on the oldschool team. There shouldn't be any cut off date, they should fix every players account that they ruined.
---
 Bro, do you understand how you sound? I‚Äôm asking for the simplest of account security, and you are saying it isn‚Äôt necessary... I know how to properly secure an internet account. Part of it has to do with passwords being case sensitive.. 
---
Most likely didn't brute force it, bud.
---
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt kill unarmed opponents maybe pking isn‚Äôt for you‚Äù 
---
To illustrate how dumb this point is: I‚Äôll put up 20m you can‚Äôt kill me in whatever hybrid gear you like on tournament worlds, when I‚Äôm using bulwark tank gear and a reasonable amount of brews within 5 minutes (teleblock length). Let me know if you want to try when I‚Äôm back on my pc. 
---
As the loot of crates scales with your represented level, saving crates is essential for ironmen unless they fancy doing acorns all the way till 99
---
Really? How so? 
---
Hey now. Im not old. Im still under 25. I think. Lemme do the math.
---
I literally explained in my first comment 
---
What mage book is he using? Is that lunar? I might try this method
---
Yep. The buyer holds all of the risk.
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
Loot from reposting content another user created to farm karma...
---
Lol. Yup, I have no idea what‚Äôs been happening. Smh. This subreddit is filled with 10 year olds. Your odds are wrong. Case sensitivity does help. I hope you lose your account because your arrogance. 
---
btw
---
They should do a couple things.
---
A. Have this thread always open to the public to allow resets of pures
---
B. Give the genie a right click option for lamp, this will automatically put it in your inventory like it does now. When talking to him he offers two lamps and one of them is the de-experience lamp. Works the same as a genie lamp but opposite.
---
C. Be able to straight up Lock Experience
---
D. Some sort of Mini-game where you could de-level. Think like Anti-Bob and his cooked fish.
---
E. Let us lock our experience in a skill at the Ironmen in Lumbridge
---
F. Prestiging like in CoD where you can talk to a NPC and completely reset your xp in a stat to zero. Maybe offer a bonus if you get to 99 first then prestige, something something electric boogaloo
---
You could pick a few of these, combine em. mash em. Put em in a stew. All I know is that it's obnoxious in a modern MMO you can spend 3-4k hours leveling a thing only to fuck it up and be told "piss off m8, learn to game". I understand wanting to make achievements worth it, and someone who has a perfect pure atm definitely earned it. But it really shits in peoples cheerios if you tell them "you did 99.9% of things right but aren't perfect, make a new account nerd". Let people fix their mistakes, these accounts are usually alts/novelty anyway and just extra monetary finance for Jiggetyjaggyflex.
---
Not gonna get far if you stopped at 84 firemakin omegalul
---
Control to run feature? That would have been nice to know when I did my Vorkath kills for the head.
---
DUDE
---
Lol
---
Totally fair point, was thinking more along the lines of all time greatest (like a Michael Jordan to Lebron James comparison)
---
For the lols 
---
I don't have the money to spend on chins.
---
Welcome to Jagex Customer Support!
---
But theres no humor here. You just removed the word "yew"
---
Guess you weren‚Äôt around when a certain mod got fired and criminally charged. 
---
Yeah just hold control in when your run is off and when you click your character will run instead of walking. Never needed to use it before Vorkath but it‚Äôs a godsend against the fireballs. Also helped a ton against Galvek which meant I didn‚Äôt die fighting him.
---
Wow I'm retarded
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Adorable. 
---
I don't think they are Venezuelans. 99% of Venezuela has been without power for days...
---
You may have deposited your bonds which give credit to your account. But unless you actually redeemed them for membership, your bonds should still be safely attached to your account. 
---
People like buying accounts and having insecure emails. Easy hack
---
This has always been able to be done but was made a little more obvious when I coded the left-click op on them. 
---
I did consider potentially only having the bubbles in the area have the ops/functionality and remapping different bubbles but realised that it's not really a big issue. :P
---
Maybe this is why Jagex has Reddit and Twitter as Customer Support. 
---
Runescape players love two things: Drama and Nostalgia. If they had a normal customer support queue, we wouldn't get all these JMod smackdowns, something no other game has in such quantity. 
---
I'm with you on it being unfair, but it's the way things are around these parts. Doesn't mean this guy shouldn't be helped, it means that a system needs to be in place to allow the players to fix it themselves. De-exp lamping when???
---
There's a lot more data they can check.
---
For example:
---
* Membership payment method (including names attached to method, if not bonds)
---
* Computer/device that's playing the account.
---
* Playing habits (e.g. hours per day, potentially even specific habits in game)
---
* Account is could still be attached to original owners email address.
---
* Original owner could still have their original ISP and IP.
---
RS updates every 600ms, so 1.67 tick. 
---
124 tick servers when Jiggleflex
---
The correct answer. Don't forget that there's always gonna be a bit of fluctuation, so if you're alching something that has a profit of 2gp, anticipate you'll probably lose some money. The "Profit" bar on there factors in the GE cost of runes, as well, but I think it assumes you're using a firestaff.
---
Your better bet is, if you have the capital, buy the ones that make at least 50+gp profit and use those items, and try to buy as close to base price as possible.
---
"my continued rule breaking is doing people a favour"

and now, instead of having to constantly reset your name every time you break the rules, they don't have to worry about you, sounds like you got what you deserved.

Ironmen can't get xp in pvp, do you know of any sort of low level splash attack? Just trying to do some brainstorming
---
lol no.

enjoy the name 84buildtoad

This is by far my favorite drawing of yours to date. 
---
Damn I want her to molest a little boy like me
---
They had a forum post open for this exact reason for weeks. Your friend should have posted his info in that thread. If he did not then idk if he‚Äôll get the acc corrected
---
He‚Äôs Danny‚Äôs brother?
---
Good luck with the Jmods.  Twitter might be your best bet.
---
I can agree with the small difference between items that are tradeable and untradeable. However, what i am suggesting is something in the area of an "accessory" such as the Necklace of Anguish (or), which requires a zenyte shard, onyx and anguish ornament kit among tradeable items. Also, the discretion of the buff increase would give more of a reason to keep hydra tails if multiple are needed for the lance if the buff does become degradable or if the abyssal bonewhip were to be reconsidered.
---
I know the feeling
---
Yep, I learned the hard way when everything was secured except for my email. 
---
delet this
---
Jagex fucked up that bad and they *closed the thread for fixing their mistake*. Hey shit 
---
Case sensitivity only adds complexity which only protects against brute force trials. In that case he is quite right that with only letters and numbers 36^6 are too many tries to get by any brute force protection.
---
Most 'hacks' these days are just them trying to get you to give them the login credentials in a sneaky way. 
---
Lol. It‚Äôs adorable that you believe case sensitivity doesn‚Äôt help with password security.. whatever. Can‚Äôt help stupid. 
---
Account sharing isn't against the rules anymore lmaooooooo 
---
Jagex loves puns
---
This will never happen otherwise you'll have 1 Def pures with barrows gloves etc. You could do any quest you wanted without getting Def xp, att xp, hp xp etc. There requirements for a reason.
---
Just had an auth check yesterday. All good on my end.
---
If you have this view on women I‚Äôm sorry to say that it is you with the brain the size of a peanut you jerk
---
The new couch to 5K workout plan 
---
Yes, but then it would be empty instead of filled with something useful.
---
B gloves are locked behind def reqs already and they can just add def reqs to other stuff. 
---
You'll probably be able to change it after a year, i was after i got force changed
---
Because too many get into the game without them leaving it.
---
Jagex doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. Ever. 
---
Bad bot
---
Doesnt cover hackings. Also this update affected people with 60 atk, 75 atk, etc
---
I do all of the design work for the pin and the mould, and a machine does the rest! Each design takes me anywhere from 4-8 hours, the 3D ones can be even longer.
---
If you gain experience in a locked skill, a twisted bow spawns near the farming guild
---
It's true, I've now looked at the bodies of 75% of all runescape players and I can say truthfully I've been surprised. 
---
Built my computer about 4 years ago so that rules out the first thing lol. Are you saying check my ping to the RuneScape servers, and if so how do I check that and packet loss? Or do you suggest running an ookla speed test
---
I want some platinums. Someone please hack meeee
---
Rfd gloves already have a def req now on the main game. They could easily just add def reqs to other stuff
---
If only you told her sooner
---
Welp, I upvoted. Jamflex has to fix this.
---
Only using 384GB of a 2TB
---
I'm going to make the mistake of trying to explain this to you because he didn't. He understands case sensitivity helps, but it helps in such an infinitesimally small way. They would get locked out only after a handful of attempts. However, if you have the same password on another site that doesn't lock people out after a certain number of attempts, they could brute force it there, and then they would know your password. And if that was the case, then case sensitivity wouldn't help in the slightest. No matter what scenario you look at the effect of case sensitivity on top of everything else that is already in place to protect your password would make almost no difference.
---
All reversed XP is granted to Runecrafting

I could! Very pricey to make though.

Pure BiS is not the same as BiS.
---
Balloon transport system needs a nerf, it's too slow now.
---
I just can't believe girls really do shit like that
---
If you don't have the levels for stuff like zulrah and vorkath yet, then yeah I'd say barrows is a fun way of making money that doesn't require too high of stats.
---
There might be other things that are more profitable for you (but perhaps duller, like blast furnace) but barrows is pretty unique in being a lower level pvm encounter that is fun, actually has a place in the meta and is fairly profitable.

UK shipping takes a few days and international is 1-2 weeks. These are shipped from a third party merch company, not Jagex themselves.

Depending on the rate they bought at, it means a bunch of rubes wasted ~$25 all told on that thread. Idiots.

50m for that polished turd?

Awesome!

I'm 105 cb and almost there, but Im abhorring the 91 Fishing / 85 Agility / 86 RC grind
---
&gt; i would of never thought to do that 10minutemail thing. 
---
Probably because using an inaccessible email for a video game is an uncommon practice. The need for a secondary email isn't something I think most new people would consider.
---
If homosexuality isn't politicized, then why did it take so long to legalize gay marriage?
---
Why, in America at least, one party seen as homophobic and the other is seen as inclusive?
---
Why do we have massive pride marches in which there are clearly politicized messages primarily with a singular ideology?
---
It has absolutely been politicized. 
---
Or they get you to jerk on cam, they record it and then blackmail you. Happened to a few guys I knew in the military. Hilarious and horrible.

Pro tip: the more obvious the meme the less funny it ends up being
---
Authenticator can be removed immediately. Meaning someone with access to your email/account but not your phone can log in on the website remove authenticator and then are able to log in to the game without needing to use authenticator. The suggestion is that it there should be a delay so that it can't be immediately removed. 
---
I see "Mess hall" emotion step. And no stash there

Yeah! Draw sexy men!
---
Reading comprehension is not your strong suit, is it? Jagex offered to fix these accounts once already so he's trying via Reddit. Just a few days ago an iron got their items restored via a similar reddit post. These posts work so of course he's going to try. 
---
Jagex isn't just RuneScape, to me they're the company that murdered Ace of Spades.  A game that I loved ruined by them.  Also while I grew older and Flash games on FunOrb kind of died out.  It woulda been cool to see more of that too.  They could've branched out to other things.  We shit on them a lot for their customer support, however people seem to forget they have a lot of talented people who work there that brought us RuneScape.
---
My speculation is they're too focused on RS3 mobile right now because that is what shareholders want.  With the success of OSRS mobile, they're probably shooting for the same success with RS3.  Reviving an existing game is a lot less expensive than developing a new one.
---
At the end of the day, the CEO doesn't care about you or me, he cares about making sure him, his employee's, and shareholders all get their paycheck.  We don't know what's happening on the inside so don't act like you don't know everything or "I knew it back then and you all didn't."  That's just super narcissistic and unappreciated by most people.  The JMods are doing their jobs.  Gaurentee you they'd like to change shit that we are asking for, but somebody higher up who doesn't give a fuck is saying no.
---
WOAH
---
You'll probably get hit pretty hard but I believe you could get some kills, especially if you use chin method. If you can afford an ely bring that for offhand and you'll last a lot longer.
---
Good luck when you're included in a database leak
---
No problem. I still wouldn't pay the 1m personally. I rarely use that dungeon. The 5k trading sticks is a way cheaper work around anyhow.

Im that max combat dude that needs a squad to do BA. Procrastinating it tho

Can someone message this guy to make more guides? Easily best guide maker in RS.

I used to 3 item there cause I was an idiot, and I still got targeted first. 
---
Why should novelty accounts get special treatment? The player alone is deciding to make that kind of account knowing very well the issues and dangers that come along with it. Part of the challenge of making those accounts for people is the restriction and the trade offs.
---
This is why you take black chins when you go to crabs, only need about 100 after about 5 they usually hop
---
JaGeX fIX yErR GaME
---
Yeah, ping to the runescape servers. Since you're using RuneLite, if you use the RuneLite world-hopper tool, it'll show you the ping from you to the servers, every one on the list.
---
You could also run a tracert to the servers to see if you're dropping packets anywhere in there! If you open up command prompt, type in "tracert oldschool52.runescape.com" it'll do a trace route, showing you the path from your machine to the server. If it's suddenly showing one of the steps in the path as like "200 ms," that's probably your problem.

We're not all adults. OSRS is a 13+ game, not 18+. I seriously doubt you yourself are an adult.

Autism
---
Ok, now we all judge.
---
Ah yes so he should have constantly been refreshing the news post in hopes that an edit was added, you need to lighten up.
---
In what way was OP being an armchair dev? They were giving several solutions plus rebuttal solutions when issues were pointed out with the original solutions. Sorry, but this is exactly how good ideas are created.
---
Furthermore, stop being so goddamn elitist. I don‚Äôt give a shit about pvp, but people should have safety nets so they can‚Äôt fuck up builds. ‚ÄúBecause everyone has had to deal with messing up for years‚Äù is a shit excuse. A game evolves over time and the quality of life is supposed to improve. This is a great instance where gameplay needs to be made into ezscape. Players experience better QoL and developers don‚Äôt have to tiptoe around the matter as if it were a fragile vase. Likely, they can implement new features that they couldn‚Äôt before.
---
In summary: Developers fix issues with safety net. If a player fucks up, they‚Äôre accountable because the safety nets were there for them. Developers don‚Äôt have to waste time on issue because they know the player fucked up after placing the safety nets in place. QED.
---
Craw‚Äôs could have been a scout. He‚Äôd make everyone there think they were safe because he would be targeted first.
---
God damn that must feel good, though possibly it was botted, so hopefully he gets away with it
---
Can you define lag more clearly, please? Are you encountering stuttering or lower frames? Or, are you lagging in game as in network latency? 
---
Disruptive behavior equates to following them through world hops and leaving that area just to target that specific player. Crashing does not qualify. 
---
Nmz brother. You're gonna want b ring imbues anyways. 
---
Did you just... kill elvarg with silverlight? 
---
The wild is currently dead due to an abundance of worlds for PvMing purposes. Would limiting wild access to a certain amount of worlds ever be considered to rejuvenate PvP interactions within the wild? 
---
This is something that is heavily discussed within the PvP community but is rarely discussed on Reddit. 
---
I manage a restaurant and I get about ten calls a day asking for our address. You can only find our number through Google. Literally beside the button that has a phone is the maps button. All of this is directly below the address. People are just fucking retarded. 
---
You'll need 43 prayer to complete it but I think you can manage otherwise, though it might be a bit tricky at times if you're a fresh player.
---
Yeah it should be changed to harrasment or greifing, because crashing has always been part of the game. 
---
Use your degree and learn to not beg
---
I dunno. Some people just rock that on repeat all day.

Gimme that sweet sweet dopamine

It really is.

They‚Äôve held onto them for awhile I guess since it‚Äôs a long time ago that I was in contact with guys who knew him. 
---
Like you say, small world.
---
I agree as far as achievements, but I can see why people buy PvP accounts. It‚Äôs too monotonous questing them over and over again. 
---
Any possibility of adding some sort of stam potion in CoX: it wouldn‚Äôt really affect the meta and would just be a nice change,
---
For instance it could be done by using an empty coal on the energy well to create an unstable energy potion, then mixed with a noxifer to create it. Could require 80-85 her more to make.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why.
---
I did tai bwo wannai trio, I've got my pass bwana

What's the cost of red chins vs black chins? Currently sitting at 89 range, and would like to know how much gp/xp I'm looking at to get to 99 range with either red or black chins.
---
I didn't say it was contradicting, I said it was contrasting; RS3's lore style contrasts with what's already present with OS, and I see no point in trying to retrofit new lore for what already exists. If you have to alter existing old content to match the relatively 'new' canon then you fucked up somewhere down the line.
---
Agree, altough it would fit in the Lunar spell book. Maybe guarded behind a quest with heavy skill requirements. And unusable in the wildy as you said.
---
&gt;Not falling for phishing links anymore

LOL "anymore" XD

I promise i am the original creator. I just need to get back to my home in Uganda to get the info. I never click shady links, and I only shared my account with 2 or 3 entire clan chats

probably dumb of me but i got you. tell me a world and we can meet at the ge
---
It's been addressed before, but more security features would be great. I know 2fa is good for most players, but certainly some players that post on reddit/social media/streamers are suspect to social engineering. If the account gets recovered, it does NOT matter if the account has 2fa OR the email tethered to it because the account gets reassigned to a new email. Weath confirmed this the other day in the thread concerning the individual that lost the twisted bow. 
---
It's been stated before that jagex doesn't want security questions for players either making them too hard to remember or too easy, is that really the case? I mean I have them on my bank account, credit cards, plenty of things that require a decent level of security have them.

ü¶ÄPOWERLESS AGAINST A CLANü¶Ä

This idiot let slip that he has an osrs account

Jagex is corrupted

I hadn‚Äôt played for like 3 or 4 months and logged off with 20/20/20 combat in Varrock. When I logged back on (after having to reset my password), I had a rune scimmy, full adamant and 70/70/70 combat skills and was in the Taverly chaos Druids dungeon. The best part is that there were 3 other accounts grinding druids with the exact same gear.
---
I also had a membership attached to my account after having logged off as ftp.

Yes, let‚Äôs sexualize the church. That has never caused problems before!

The one time on tinder a chick was super straight forward and wanted to meet day 2 of talking I ghosted. It didn't help she wasnt attractive but I was spooked that I was gonna get stabbed. 
---
HHELO SIR..!!!!!! YOu hVE NO PROO FTHIS is ur account! 
---
\*Gets 1000 upvotes\*
---
SIR! Your account has been recovered! 
---
Yeah. In RS, since all weapon slots are held in the right hand. Bows are technically shot left handed by our character.

Wow, I didn't think you could do that any more! I think now they made it impossible NOT to 1 hit them

308 GE rn.

Please stop bitching about people‚Äôs posts on Reddit. Don‚Äôt read them if they bother you so much. Simple.

Jeez, talk about a lack of subtlety...

I use camulet teleport for ancients because ironman

I think you don't understand sarcasm.

sucks to sucks they wont do nothing for your "friend" its his fault he missed the dead line 
---
Where in the feck even is this?
---
I stopped playing because the only PvE content left was raids and im not autistic enough to spend 1000 hours maxing my combat. 
---
I guess it solves that problem.
---
maybe he just wants to draw sexy RS characters
---
Anyone who creates a new osrs account is not eligible. Agreed?
---
Combat is better, 10 mins fixed
---
Could you add the make X, All, 10 etc. to the raids chest? It would make raiding on mobile much more streamlined 
---
Add a new unique "Sticky Chronicle" rare drop to the Deranged Archaeologist for Sulliuscep woodcutting. It's an off-hand equipable book that contains the secrets of the swamp, which when worn would allow you to traverse the Sticky Swamp unseen by the Tar Monsters.
---
Would create a great niche item for skillers and add an incentive for pvmers to tackle this cool yet commonly forgotten Demi-boss. 
---
theyre called bullymongs man
---
Ahhh, it was quite a while ago when I saw that.
---
I mean, you're taking all the right steps and doing everything you possibly can to stay secure but I'm telling you, some things are just out of your hands.
---
By today‚Äôs standards nearly all skillers are more skillful than Zezima.  No hate to Zezima it‚Äôs just the game was a lot more simple and easy back then.

Void apparently doesn't work at the chompies last I read

Friend of mine made a new account never even played the game before. He was killing chickens and cows. Got hacked somehow he swears he didn't go to any weird websites related to runescape. Anyway jump forward a week later he gets it back. Has 75 wc and about 2m worth of logs with a dragon axe. Definitely botted, but hasn't been banned yet for it. 
---
rsn?
---
He doesn't have a degree yet, moron.
---
Yeah, bummer you can't see that any more
---
open them?
---
Please help the man ffs, he's fucking devastated
---
Or a sarcastic roast of the people on here who whore for karma only be debunked hours later, pretty funny unless you don't follow these steps and have been hacked.
---
Yeah man you‚Äôre addicted to gambling. Those small amounts add up over time. If you‚Äôre staking 25M paid for with bonds you‚Äôre staking $50 at a time. If you do that a few times a week that really starts to add up over time. It‚Äôs the same as people who play slot machines a few times a week and put blow $50, it‚Äôs still an addiction. Further down the line you might end up spending a lot more.
---
thats ur issue not a game issue.
---
I failed twice 
---
Beggars on reddit? Soon well see people begging for osrs gp on national television
---
One other thing to note is to try to change your passwords every couple of months. You may not even realise before its too late that your email and password have been in a data breach and leaked online, just as an example. 
---
No, Metal Dragons are weak to stab. But they are not weak to crush.
---
Gotta take risks. Day 2 of talking is normally just a hook-up. Day 1 of talking is stab. 
---
Yeah pretty cringey

Because they use googles IP and they aren't allowed to make any changes to that, all they have to do is enable authenticator to login the website and it will stop every single piece of hacking going on.
---
I come here for memes not to here about some guy who was too dumb to keep his account safe. Sorry not sorry.
---
Wow someone whos actually not retarded?
---
Because the legitimate cases don't make melodramatic sob stories and thus don't get upvoted.
---
I've made a simple post for my shit and it got no upvotes and people attacked me so meh whatever. It's been two years and I've just given up.
---
Just like your proof-reading
---
Dungeons aren't really a thing until you are a high combat level, they are also more for the members skill slayer.
---
You can kill things cows/chickens for xp, and you can get food and leather/feathers from that to use for crafting later.
---
You can also fish for shrimp and cook them for food. Having a lot of food makes combat a lot easier. 
---
First time I've seen us addressed as vennies and I squeaked out of how much I love that lil nickname. I'm absolutely going to use that name from now on. 
---
Thanks for the helpful info, but this was quite a while ago. Good to know for the future though just in case. 
---
Finished Desert Treasure and want to do some mage training with it (70 magic currently), but I'm only 42 slayer so I don't have access to nechs/dust devils/etc.
---
Is there anything else I can kill to break even/only go slightly negative and still get good XP rates?
---
"Let's just add a bunch of unnecessary, and pointless details to everything, and call it HD"

It does not look good, it just looks over the top
---
Have fun! 
---
Yeah, I would really like to know further details why the two JMods were certain he wasn't the original owner.
---
I'm not really sure what to think yet. I guess we'll find out when the dude makes another appeal in a couple of days. The JMod response makes me think something like a location change wouldn't be enough to make a successful appeal, but OP is confident so maybe he also has more of the original info to give as well? Dunno. I'll wait and see.

It looks like they rely catching a barrage freeze. So it would make sense to give them negative mage bonus so they do not splash.

Recent update killed Volcano Mine for Ironman. Currently, a player with 97 Mining can receive 6.5k Ash/h, while  only 365/h participating in VM. Could the shop be updated to make Ash cost 3 points? This would allow a player to receive nearly 5k Ash/h and make VM a viable option for Ironman again.
---
I have two QoL suggestions for Volcanic mine. 
---
- Wintertodt currently keeps track of the players' personal best point game, could this be also done for Volcano Mine?
---
- A start timer like Wintertodt (30s) + a quick start / coffer system to skip dialogue when joining a new game.
---
That's fine dude
---
but also the recovery system is flawed stupid, 50% is players fault and 50% is jagex's fault

The person driving the motorcycle at about the 20 second mark gives me anxiety.

Can you prove that you actually give a shit about your player base by addressing many of the concerns at the top of this thread and not just saying some bullshit lie like ‚Äúit‚Äôs being looked into‚Äù for the millionth time? 
---
he admited hes no orginal owner in the comments.
---
Definitely. I agree - and my personal guess would be that too - I just don't see why my guess, or anyone else's, in any possible way, is relevant here. Everyone will have a certain belief, and that is absolutely fine, but we have no definite evidence, so it's pointless to even discuss this, as it doesn't concern us on any level. I guess my question isn't who is right or wrong, but why we are even having the discussion in the first place. It just seems so redundant and tiring at this point.
---
You chose to enter an area specifically designed for PvP, therefore you should accept that someone else have take your stuff. Playing a different game mode should not make that any different.
---
Not gonna happen. Can you pause an Netflix,amazon,etc subscription just because you were busy and didn‚Äôt use it? No.

Alright, i'm sorry. It was a bad suggestion.

What about the force spawn random event that was in one of the last videos by swampletics? I don't recall the requirements or specifics on how it works though
---
hes still the owner of the account and can take it when ever he feels like and you are shit out of luck.
---
Yeah, if I saw myself entering that dungeon even as little as 20 more times, I might have paid it. But I doubt I will, so I won't.
---
which you may choose to not install
---
I think there are various types of other games out there such as Overwatch for example that disagree with you. 
---
Hey all I can say man is at least those 30 other people can have a meaningful discussion. Apparently you're the one too far up his own ass that he can't even bother to read my comments. To be honest if you haven't been reading my comments I don't know why you'd even waste your time replying.
---
Got a dragonstone drop from fire giant.  Is there anything useful I cAn do with it. My uim is still super new. Two days old. 
---
I can't find him admitting anything. The closest was him saying he wasn't the original owner of his friends account. He said multiple times he is the owner of his account (the one in question).
---
Apparently he didn't use the original email and was in a different location. And most of the information isn't with him. So...idk.
---
They‚Äôre available on twitch right after they‚Äôre over.
---
Unless somebody has recovered your account. If someone recovers your account, they get to associate a new email with your account. All communications will be sent to the new email, including authenticator removal notifications. 
---
Well your account probly doesnt have enuff value for mod Jod to care 
---
Is there a way to level up farming from 61-70 without breaking the bank or taking months?
---
Oh i'm meming alright

Play RS3 then. 
---
I think it's totally fair to vote no. I know not every no is a spite vote. I meant only to speak against the idea of spite voting, not voting no in general. I am quite certain that a lot of the votes are spite votes because people actively advertise that they're spite voting on this subreddit and in game. I'm against that. I wish people could look at polls objectively and vote without bias. I'm not even really mad at the players who do this. It's more of a fault on the system than its users in my opinion. 
---
Please, by all means vote no on anything you don't agree with. I just want people to vote for the right reasons. 
---
Good man
---
That's not what it's for lmao
---
I don't trust this subreddit to see the irony in your post. But hey, let's hope they prove me wrong for both our sakes, eh?
---
Since we know that Black Graceful is a potential outfit for new and fitting content in the future, can you confirm whether or not Marks of Grace may be needed to obtain the outfit?

Sitting on enough Marks of Grace for one recolor, but too afraid to use it now and find out that I need to farm out another 200+ or more for Black Graceful.
---
You have 6 ticks to get your prayer right, just take a breath and think that it is legitimately a *slow* switch. 
---
Can we have an option in our account settings or just in game settings somewhere that can turn on aggressive/dangerous random events again?
---
Ah, my bad - I didn't read everything. But even then, what if somebody created it for him, and he then used the account from very early on? I mean, if he has been using the account since level 5 or something, I guess he would have at least a reasonable claim to the account? It's obviously a bit of a grey area in that case, because the original creator technically owns the account, since that's the person that agreed to the terms and services etc. - But I don't even want to go there. I already feel like Jagex called him out on being dishonest - I just don't feel like it's my judgement to make.
---
So the simplest solution is to just let you lock stats in.
---
here :
---
&gt; Did you create the account?
---
&gt; Access to the email account used to login doesnt apply to account ownership.
---
op replays :
---
&gt; It doesn't? Why wouldn't it. You can't change that email no matter what. I can prove that I have had that email for like a decade.
---
so yeah..
---
Completely different type of game with different objectives so that's not relevant. Plus I'm pretty sure Reinhardt was meta for a long time
---
Username and comment checks out.
---
That‚Äôs not a terrible idea honestly. 
---
My bad, didn't read that.
---
Some capes are in members only areas they would have to be moved 
---
Maybe they have a low G.E. sell value, but the Barrows equipment is a SET BONUS type of item Karils coif has a high value if it's the last piece you need to have full Karils set for one reason or another. Torags hammers, same story. 
---
I just don't think that taking an item like this that belongs to a set of items and giving it an arbitrary use somewhere else in the game is a good idea. Barrows is such an old, established set of equipment, why mess with it?
---
So your account was hacked but in absolutely no way is it your fault? Hmmmmm. 
---
It‚Äôs like a disgusting ugly playdoh creature
---
All these people saying it's awesome you're brewing irl but I'm more amazed you did brewing in-game. 
---
'Trust Trading' and then logging out with the items still in his possession. (Back in the days before OSRS - Disk of Returning were worth 600-700m) Somebody trust traded him around 6 or so of them, he then logged and didn't log in for the day, then logging in to ignore the person.
---
I usually pop a titty through one 
---
50 IQ is generous.
---
What's the couches thought on this new reward idea from wilderness bosses or a future update:
---
An equippable item that when worn removes the players white dot from the minimap.  This item could be helpful to both PvMers and PKers who want to try to sneak past other players in the wilderness. 
---
My thoughts is it would be a new ring as to not synergize with ring of nature, coins, or stone (or maybe it should synergize with those?)
---
There's no way pussies like that would do anything remotely offensive in real life. In real life there is actual threat of getting harmed, online you can be as big and tuff as you want.
---
Well, it is... but it's way better than the situation currently, so it actually looks very smart.
---
he didint creat the account but had it for long time, and he thinks that means hes the owner of the account.
---
thats why he sais "it doesnt? why wouldnt it"
---
I don't think there's a splash method that doesn't give XP per damage, so you would get XP for hitting the gansters still
---
If this is true  we need more pro tips for mobile and to up vote them.
---
It shouldn't be polled, it should just be done. We can't trust the integrity of the polls whilst the results are visible during voting.
---
That's like saying high level players will never leave ge. 
---
Can lucky Implings be revised to only roll drops on the Unique table of each tier? They are so incredibly rare (can't be farmed either) yet give junk loot like firelighters and salmon.
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs like fighting fire with marshmallows. 
---
SARAHU AKBAR!!
---
No chaotics, don't make it a skill. Though we have a replacement in osrs with raids and new crucible coming up with priff.
---
I just mean the prayer demand of bosses like Vork, Zulrah, Hydra, etc where you need to adjust prayer every so often, but at a significantly lower intensity than 3-way flicking
---
It's +6 prayer and +2.5% magic /range damage so yea
---
Sounds like a personal problem to me 
---
I already had all of the drops from Zulrah, The joke was that I got two sort after items for Ironmen, in the same drop.
---
Not sure if you understood this, or are just bored.
---
Not gonna lie.. I like Summoning and Dung.. just hated the combat update. :[
---
Why are all the artists on this sub fucking weirdos
---
With the introduction of Beginner clue scrolls, how will monsters that have easy clues on their drop table be affected? For example, if we assume Goblins will drop beginner clues (which they most likely will), will they still drop easies? 
---
Honestly just letting u set stats at will below your current level would be the best (so if ur 60 def, you can set ur def to 1-60. If ur 99, 1-99). Then anyone can pk without dedicating so much time to just 1 build. Anyone who is hacked or messes up or experienced a glitch can just set their stats to whatever. add hard reqs to anything that has a soft req (like veng) and call it a done deal. 
---
Probably banned 
---
Just because its rarely enforced, doesnt mean its not againt the rules.
---
Pretty much the unofficial stance of Jagex about acc sharing is you can do it at your own risk, but dont come whine to us when shit like this happens.
---
jagex methods of making pvp more revived are to put pvm/skilling things in the wild, which is dogshit design. pkers want ways to fight pkers, pvmers and skillers don't want to have to interact w/ pvp to be efficient.
---
the issue is more that jagex doesnt have a clue with what they should be doing to improve pvp so how can they expect a 75% majority to have a clue either?
---
This shortcut would be good for explorers ring
---
That's true. I didn't care for chaotics. I like dungeonneering cause was kinda like ironman mode but only in a certain aspect of the game.
---
Romeo and Juliet
---
Not true at all. There are alot of people who enjoy pet gameplay, look at WoW for example, but it's a very common archeytpe in RPG's. Not to mention it would enable whole new PvP archetypes like Summoning tanks.
---
If you think Summoning is bad you simply don't understand MMORPG design. Yet another example why players don't make good gameplay designers.
---
We crap on those people too
---
Aha, okay fair enough!
---
Wow.

I can agree. Hydra should have a shorter range to be able to make luring manageable. I'm currently still testing the lance out. Even with the dragonbane element adding to the current accuracy and damage bonus, hits were not as competitive as with the DPS of the ranged weapons. I just want to see if the melee experience at Alchemical hydra could be improved.
---
&gt; mean, if he has been using the account since level 5 or something, I guess he would have at least a reasonable claim to the account?
---
nope.
---
that i drive a new car that was stolen and put 100k miles does not mean i have reasonable claim to the the car, same thing there.
---
its like him purshasing a car from a shady guy with out any paperwork and the orginal owner of the car latter reports it as theft and gets it back, that OP had the car for long time and put miles on it or upgraded it does not make it reasonable claim its his.
---
Not a neck beard, that's just how it is. Society might have all kinds of ideas about purpose of life, but if our world collapsed today the only thing that would matter is survival, and finding the best potential mate is important. The more options you have the better odds of a good mate. Nature doesn't give a shit what your job or upbringing is. Procreation is king baby.

You could telegrab wines of zamorak for over 500k/hr (it was close to 1m hr at one point but prices have dropped a lot). It's in the wilderness and not afk, but a solid moneymaker nonetheless.
---
As far as afk money goes, those methods won't yield as much profit. Making diamond bolt tips out of cut diamonds is super afk, and more profitable than anything else that is as afk. Requires 60some fletching if remember right, but well worth it.
---
Did they even fix it my acc almost level up to 61 attack nothing was done after I wrote my name on the forum

It's a video of a bank Haha

Yea if they could make it so that the stats are as if you weren't wearing anything maybe, but I just don't like the thought of locking or losing xp. Too private server-y.
---
They weren't here, the forums were.

Something similar called gaunlet will be released in summer locked behind the new grandmaster quest song of the elves

Which plugin? I have the health and prayer bars like this one but I can't move my timers down to the chat box.

Ive heard the same thing. Quite an annoying bug, I hope that someone from jagex will know how to fix this eventually.

Hey all, there are questions being asked in this thread (and elsewhere) that the Old School development team aren't perhaps well-placed to answer on this specific stream.
---
We're calling these "big questions" and we've been collating them. We are going to answer them, probably in a live stream format with members of the Old School leadership team. There's no set date for this stream yet, we want to make sure we have actual answers to present before doing it, but they are not being ignored.
---
Must be low iq to understand

One thing I'd like to add is that he has said that he thinks he knows who hacked him, as the same person has gained access to his account before. Though through the hacker manipulating friend, which is somewhat weird.

Random question but does Zezima still play? His whole thing was being #1 on leaderboards back in the day right? Its been so long I dont even remember anymote.

I have already maxed two osrs accs that account has under 5hours playtime btw. I‚Äôm getting back to it. When I do. I play efficiently I don‚Äôt want to burn myself out I‚Äôm not an idiot.

You can get an item for super cheap that turns you into a normal iron when you die. And you can buy extra lives. The extra lives thing is whack. 
---
Pest control isnt that bad, it was better than rc and agi for sure.
---
As i stated on a post below (Because it's being fucking downvoted, big surprise). If you acknowledge showing poll results as a problem then that means that every poll that failed (And those that passed) met with the same bias that hiding the poll results is trying to get rid of and it would be fair to argue that most things should be re-polled.
---
They aren't going to do that, ever.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like it tbh. I probably will repost this as it needs more traction. 
---
Here's the thing I don't understand. You want to give Barrows set effects to a single item. Will the shield have the same equip requirements as a full set of Barrows armor or the barrows weapon? If not then you are basically taking something that people normally need 4 items to achieve and giving it to them in a single item. So you're really devaluing all Barrows sets since I can get the set effect just from buying the cheapest item in the set and putting it in my shield. 
---
Mate, you should see what he was replying to. It was someone talking about the account from which he took the screenshots from (aka the 2nd acc that got locked pming the hacked acct in question). He went on a friends acct that had his hacked acc added to msg it while the hacker was on. 
---
Might not be a direct repost but it's definitely the same joke
---
You checked his post history because you didn't agree with him? Yup, sounds like a redditor.
---
Lol, you guys really get pissed off when you're called out for being the literal party crasher bullies you are. Also what hilarious logic between "This game is designed for PVP" and "How dare you guys not vote for more PVP." Bully to you, the community has spoken and we don't want PVP in the game, and I damn well hope we'll remove it as soon as we can. If you really wanted to PVP then you could go into PVP worlds and duel people to your heart's content, but you won't because what you really want to do is take easy kills.
---
When are poll results going to be hidden?
---
Yikes.
---
I would assume there would be some down time if you moved country, whereas a sold account would insta login from around the world. Also password changes, an account would have its pass changed after or a little before been sold,but not if somebody moved country.

literally just do all of the ones you can, you might as well. I usually wait til I have the reqs for a whole tier and them pound em out....someone please do BA for me I fucking hate it.
---
You can give all those things defence/other level requirements. It sounds cheesy but it would be a message that only pures would see. any action you take by clicking on something can have a level requirement
---
The password consistency is a reasonable metric, for sure

The bulk of your damage at zulrah comes from magic - so you‚Äôll have a much harder time learning zulrah when you have to survive a lot longer because of your tridents low damage. Although it‚Äôs doable without, I‚Äôd highly recommend getting a toxic staff first
---
yeah honestly the case sensitive password thing isn't all that bad though. They have anti brute force measures so as long as ur password isn't 3 letters long its not an issue, all be it very lazy programming.
---
Authenticator delay is just ridiculous, they obviously have code for delaying things (bank pin), should be able to delay the authenticator removal just as easily. Authenticator is only bypassed by a compromised email though, and if your email is unsafe you're probably not going to take many steps to protect your rs account unless you really don't know about computers.
---
Thank you for telling me this! I didn't see this news post. Similar enough to dungeonneering for me :)
---
i mean by definition if theyve been punished they've already been proven guilty.

Theres nothing of importance at those places though. It would only be useful for limited ironman accs. U still appear as 60 def on highscores for example so u cant even abuse ‚Äúfirst 1 def uim locked to varrock achievements‚Äù

Yeah it's 1/35 so I'm not that dry. I just want to be able to switch to attas seeds finally.
---
&gt;If it's an unwritten rule, how do you expect everyone to know about it and follow it?
---
I think people SHOULD respect it, just like people SHOULD respect their enviroment and don't throw trash in the floor. It doesn't mean that it'll never exist people who do those things. 
---
Most people know about this unwritten rule, even the ones that don't respect it. You are saying like most people don't know about it, while it's just a minimum number of new players that don't have any idea how the system works.
---
&gt;Assuming that this is the jagex-intended way of training, that would mean that there would also be enough supply to support there demand, meaning that you wouldn't need to server hop to find a space to train.. You shouldn't have to server hop a world to train something, if it was intended in the game's design
---
I don't exactly understand what you mean, just because its a method people found out that MAYBE wasn't exacly intended by Jagex, this unwritten rule created by the players shouldn't be respected? This completely shows your mindset that completely disregards how a community in a game works.
---
&gt;Couldn't be more wrong, I don't waste my time on this shit
---
Of course, probably isn't a part of the game were you are focusing. If it was the same situation in a content that you wanted to do I bet your opinion would be 100% different and you would start to "give a shit".
---
&gt;At the end of the day, you can turn off your computer walk away
---
Again, this just shows how you are one of the people that don't understand the concept of a community, and feels like acting toxic is ok because "it's just a game and you can walk away".
---
&gt;For someone against toxicity, in a game, you're awfully toxic on Reddit. But hey, that's my opinion, we're all allowed to have those, just like we're all allowed to kill the shit when and where we want to on Runescape - Oh wait, that's mean
---
Keep using ad hominem and calling me toxic as long as you want, it's kind of understandable when your only argument is "it's just a game bro" or "it's just clicking monsters".
---
23:59 - I'm just here for the meme, and agree with it

00:00 - We're all allowed to kill the shit when and where we want to on Runescape
---
You can't even make up your mind about what you think about it, you should just admit that you are one of these toxic players, and not hide behind excuses of "it's just a game and I don't care lol".
---
Literally started in 06, just now finding this out... I love this game.
---
I'm about to start this grind just need to get the herb sack 
---
tanking was never going to work well with the combat system in place
---
Yeah that should go without saying
---
Yeah but unlike dungeoneering it will be locked behind the hardest quest in the game so i hope you have a decent account already :D
---
I wonder how retarded he feels
---
alright I think i could probably sell a few things and get the toxic. the toxic is also good for barrows, right?
---
also i would have full void, fury, barrows gloves . are there any other items recommended that i can make a small upgrade?
---
:O
---
‚ÄúTheyre pretty much the same email address‚Äù 
---
no one exists and one doesn‚Äôt. Only solution would be to recover the account on an legitimate email address.
---
I‚Äôve recently been banned for macroing and I can‚Äôt get it appealed, I haven‚Äôt used botting nor will I, so I wanna know why I‚Äôve been banned and if I can fix it. I‚Äôm around level 500-600 and I‚Äôve earnt every level myself, I don‚Äôt use bots, I don‚Äôt even have that much gold (like 1mil if that) I really enjoy playing OSRS and I‚Äôve really began to start building up the account, I even bought a year membership that I cant use now because I‚Äôm banned. but now I‚Äôve been banned and I can‚Äôt do that, any way someone can help? I tried appealing it but it said it‚Äôs unappealable. 
---
This too. I own a set of justy, bought it when it crashed to 60m a while back and rarely use it because of the set effect
---
Dam. Feelsbad. 
---
Let me know if you need a finishing companion, let me know! :D
---
Wait, are you the real michael_rs?? Wow, big fan man
---
Why don‚Äôt you just get better at pvp instead of complaining about something that won‚Äôt change.
---
Just a thought.
---
Summoning ruins the economy... stop
---
Can you tell me the benefit to sell it there?  I looked and it would give me only tokkul.  How will this be useful?
---
Had the same problem, created a new user profile which made a clean profile with default system settings, osrs worked clean
---
Ive been grinding out the skills needed for RFD for like a week now. Only one left is thieving and im at 51 now. Im considering just doing mournings end pt 1 which will give me 53, need the quest points anyway. 
---
Yea I really appreciate everything the OSRS team has done,
---
But I also agree. It is crazy that there is not real support system.
---
it was understandable when the game was a miniclip com kids game, but now we are well into the point that the game is taken very seriously by a lot of passionate players. Myself included!
---
You clearly don't know what you're talking about. 
---
Are you seriously nitpicking on him saying ''illegal'' instead of ''against the game rules''? Or am I reading this thread wrong
---
Not every time, but you have the potential each time.
---
Just dive into it. It's not really hard. Just long. If you follow slayermusiq guide on YouTube it's really straightforward. Plus he breaks it into multiple parts so you can just do it in stages if questing is really boring for you. 
---

#Hide Poll Results
---
Tithe Farm Suggestions:
---
* Could Tithe Farm give points ever 4 fruit handed in as opposed to 1 point per fruit past 75?
---
* Can Gricollers Can be equippable in the shield slot for fashionscape?
---
* Grape Seed cost being reduced to 1 point, and maybe even multiple per point.
---
* Thoughts on adding another tier of fruit above the current one that gives less XP but gives 2x the points?
---
No way if you type your password backwards it comes up in stars!! \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* SEE!!!!!
---
Farming Contracts, and Bird Nest helps a lot. Fossil Island is a great boost to Xp. Bottom Less bucket is Great, Farming Guild is Great. I thought Herb Bag would be have more use, but I tend to hit the 75 limit very often. 
---
It's incredible how long they have ignored this issue for. At this point, this thread could be made up of only questions pertaining to hiding poll results and they'll still somehow ignore all of them and make up their own questions.
---
Thanks for the reply man.
---
Just like the high effort they put into customer service yeh?
---
its worse than valves but i would probably put them next to each other on a tierlist of video game customer support.
---
The authenticator shouldn't even be removed.  The only way authenticator should ever be removed is through email or a phone app.  There is 0 reason for an account recovery to be disabling a security service.
---
Because they‚Äôre *too* smooth. Almost reminds me of some uncanny valley shit. Also they just don‚Äôt fit the overall style of the game
---
That's why no one will ever guess it
---
You‚Äôre too kind! I‚Äôll let you know if it happens again anytime soon! :))
---
Yep as soon as themages come out my heart starts going nuts
---
I really hope they fix this for him. Please let us know either way.
---
Id recomend watching SlayerMusiq1 quest guides on youtube. He's turned quests thatd take me hours into 20m. 
---
This. That friend display allows me to pk at agility arena without having to risk the skillers main coming after me. It shows you exactly logged in even if they're private is off.
---
was this recorded on a potato? 
---
Not even Ironman with all the herbs not even worth
---

---
Nah, cause that's the action of chopping to begin with. The text saying "yew" is what OP said could be a 1/1,000 chance of happening
---
44 deaths without a kill? Wtf?
---
Now that we have a diary for kourend is there any chance of adding a diary requirement to lizardmen shaman's in the canyon? It's nice to have the single way spot in Kebos but it would also be nice to have a spot to cannon them as well. It's still impossible to find a canyon world without hopping for 20+ minutes.
---
Now my question is, should it get a buff? It's sort of a catch 22, if we do, it's power creep and instantly devalues Bandos. If we don't, then it's practically useless. Safest option is to leave it be, I suppose, but it still makes the set useless
---
I don't know where you got the relation between being against crashing and defending pk's killing newbies. It doesn't make any sense.
---
Pioneering.
---
You are mixing up the two incidents.  The rollback was the twisted bow incident.  What they are referring to is a manual rollback on specific accounts, on an account by account basis.
---
Devaluates my AMERICA FIRST embargo only account.

3rd party clients can make any feature they want, it doesn't matter. Jagex can just tell them not to, like they did with runelite's zulrah helper, and it'll be gone.
---
wait wait... tomorrow? Q&amp;A on a tuesday? 
---
I used to think this way until I quit for a semester to focus on school and my side Ironman got hacked even though it had basically everything stated above except it was an account that‚Äôs around 12 years old and not 15. I have Authenticator on all my emails as well, but during my break it was still hacked. No phishy links were used as I exclusively used osbuddy (back then, official client and browser didn‚Äôt allow my arrow keys to be used on Mac)
---
This was over 2 months ago. You fuck off 
---
Send it to historian minas
---
When I was training range I already had 60attk so i would just bust out a d scim and a dds and spec crabs until the crasher left. They are missing out on xp as well. The less you give them the higher chance they hop. Its just not afkable at that point.
---
No, noted hyrda bones with completion of the kebos diary was initially going to be polled, but mods didn't want to increase the profitability of alch hydra.

**Tithe Farm Suggestions:**

Would you consider some accessability changes for Drift net fishing? It's currently pretty dead content in spite of good xp rates due to how difficult it is to the trident and the nets. Perhaps they could be an uncommon drop from Kraken, or Jute Seeds could yield more crops. 
---
This man is a meme God. 
---
&gt; Playing habits (e.g. hours per day, potentially even specific habits in game)
---
This is a very bad idea
---
Yeah except every other company in the world also deals with fraudulent support requests or people just looking for handouts but a lot of them still manage to offer quality customer service 
---
The medium boat is still fast.. It didn't take me long at all to get full ranged and melee helm.a few hours tops. 
---
Aaaand it's the top comment now
---
Devalues my 2 mile 13.4 minute irl Ironman

Then make quest rewards still give the xp

---
PepeLaugh He doesn't know.
---
d def too
---
Get splitbark. Shits bis
---
Yeah, that could be a possibility. But if I correctly recall, I don‚Äôt think that is possibility according to Jagex. I think the hop limit is in place to protect the servers. Might be wrong, but it‚Äôs something along those lines based on what I‚Äôve read. 
---
Party hats are made of tanned brutal red foreskin, not plastic

---
at that point you might as well cannon
---
Then why does Jagex let every YouTuber and streamer openly account share like crazy.
---
They dug their own hole. 
---
Don't you think you're giving them a little too much credit?
---
I'd just solo Rex ans try pulling the mage.. After every kill before you jump into all three. You'll be surprised how much slower that mage dies.
---
Same stats btw and better gear.
---
Runelite takes upto 40% osbuddy took max 25%
---
ROLL IT BACK
---
This is my case too. I love having my login be my old username cuz unless someone has access to a list of all my name changes, I don't see how anyone would ever know what my username is at this point. Plus 2FA on my registered email and the account. I feel like its gotta be pretty foolproof.
---
New items dont always need to be bis. Its useful at inferno and im sure it has other uses. 
---
good luck explaining that to this fucking subreddit
---
As weird as this may sound, I‚Äôm glad I saw this comment thread. I wish the best to the both of you. 
---
You managed to be wrong and then retort with 0 information.  Nice.
---
I see what you're saying. The current animations have more pronounced movements. The poses are more sharp and defined which does give it a different feel. Smoothing enabled - they remind me a bit of action figures for some reason. Still like it tho.
---
Name checks out
---
&gt;I personally what to know the improvements they have made to their systems after this event. If any
---
Spoiler: it's none. 
---
Any chance you can look at some Theatre of Blood reworks? Nothing too fancy but Xarpus P1 seems much longer in trios compared to any other size group.
---
Also in the Nylocas room, attacking the crabs is very inconsistent when the crabs first enter the room from the three passages. If I attack a crab right as they enter the room, my character all of a sudden loses aggro on it so I have to spam click. This only happens when the crab is just entering the room so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional. It‚Äôs purely by QOL.
---
**Also please hide poll results.**
---
More or less the point I was getting across, on top of some girls are just god awful boring to talk to. 
---
D
---
Which is not what the guy I replied to said. 
---
Yeah whatever. human trash 
---
61-70 is about 435k exp, papayas net you approximately 6200 exp each whereas ranarrs are roughly 235 exp per patch assuming you average 7 herbs per patch (you can plant avantoe instead for lower profit but also lower risk). Assuming you plant 4 fruit trees a day (gnome stronghold/village, brimhaven, catherby, if you have lletya unlocked then plant a 5th) and you do 3 herb runs a day (at falador, ardougne, catherby, port phasmatys, hosidius) you can expect around 28k exp per day with minimal effort while making profit. This would take around 2 weeks to hit 70. You can double this rate by doing multiple tree runs per day and also planting allotments, though this will be time and money
---
Tithe farm is a minigame on Hosidius and is a separate thing from the farming guild. It's got some nice perks that you can unlock like the autoweeder and the seed box.
---
I feel the milestones thing, and I have never bought an account but I understand why people would. To me the fun part of runescape is bossing  mostly so I would love to not have to grind max combat 
---
This has to deal with GP being traded.  There's 0 reason for an account to be rolled back because Jagex said they track the gold and punish accounts that exploited the glitch.
---
What you're saying is accounts were reverted to a previous state, individually which makes 0 sense in this scenario.  
---
Jagex DID roll back individual accounts when they caused attack styles to change.
---
&gt; The thing is, this game was basically open pvp (kind of how Deadman works), and these assholes would often be killed by other players because they disrespect the system.
---
This is not totally dissimilar to how human societies have formed in the first place
---
Right.  Its so obvious now lol
---
Someone sounds salty 
---
We've already voted in what is essentially going to be dungeoneering as not a skill for the crystal city.
---
can we please have more items like the bcc wintumber tree that can be freely placed around the poh.
---
So what's the story behind the Rev cave monkfish drop table?
---
because you're most likely just a random pleb with a 20m bank so you're not worth being targeted. get a couple of bills and post about it on reddit and you'll be hushed up real fast
---
No one is twisting words? The post you linked could be interpreted multiple ways, although the latest one you quoted clarifies.
---
The only thing worth going there for is metallic dragons isn‚Äôt it? I just use the service entrance west of Tai Bwa. Saves me the gold and a stupid axe
---
Just for anyone who doesn't know or is not sure, yes this is a sketch.
---
The original is funny on its own, but this is a masterpiece.
---
Never seen this is a meme template.
---
Potions on a hard clue are 3rd age rare if I remember correctly 
---
This is why we need to roast the shit out of people when they come here complaining about getting hacked. If you don't provide at least one valid current/former password, your recovery request gets automatically denied. So for every post here about getting hacked, there's a 95% chance they either bough the account, lent it to a Venezuelan to get a fire cape, or fell for a fishing scam. Either way, it's hilarious.
---
Go fuck a jar of salt before i cum on your doorhandle
---
this actually happened to me once lol. i still remember my original two passwords as well as a few others from 10+ years ago. 
---
got my account hacked and stolen. friend lets me use his personal account for fun, one day see some dude log into my old account. get in touch with him, he outright says he bought the account from someone. talk to jagex, get my account back. it happened some 7 or 8 years ago and that session has since moved onto rs3 but it still means the world to me that i have the account back. still use it to this day, holds a lot of nostalgia to me
---
&gt; I really don't understand why this is such a hot issue. 
---
It mainly bothers me that they ignore it.
---
This game is supposed to be community driven. Jagex is proud of that, yet when it comes to acknowledging certain subjects they're silent.
---
I agree that this topic shouldn't even be a hot issue, because it's not even controversial. It makes perfect sense to hide poll results before voting. That's how literally every poll works. Some even allow you to click a button to see the results, but none show it by default. 
---
Changing the default menu should have been resolved during the QoL month. Perhaps they thought we wanted to entirely hide the results before the poll ends, which would indeed require more development time (ingame + website). While that would be the ideal solution, they didn't even engage with us in a discussion about what we actually want. I'm sure that a lot of the community would be perfectly fine with simply changing the default page and change the "vote" button into a "results" button. Would be a great temporarily solution at least.
---
I think that's what most people are upset about. We are supposed to decide which changes we want and don't want in the game. Yet when it comes down to it we're being ignored.
---
just get 99 + grind whatever amount they did in addition.
---
Roughly an additional 940k xp
---
I did enough barrows to get a tank bottom to go with my torso for slayer since I am usually too lazy to flick prayer, and I didn‚Äôt want to waste ppots on straight prayer. I then waited for trident and mort hard diaries to grind the rest.
---
ok
---
Put it in your house and don't be fucking lazy
---
Jaapie, start de Nederdraad
---
Better to just go train then come back and do 100 boat
---
First point is countered by just making you pay for the ability. 
---
You can chin/barrage on ape atol with 1 def anyway. It would just mean people who plan poorly arent punished. Not a big deal at all. Also thats not even meta anymore. 
---
U save a few hours by getting 65 def before getting 99 str after taking into account the quests and 500k xp u have to get.  Whoopie. Meanwhile most people never get to 99 str and the people who do wouldnt be deterred by a few extra hours anyway. The big majority of people who play pures do so for pvp. They dont care about achievements. 
---
&gt;except this is rs, they can close your account for whatever reason or for no reason at all. and from my observation you only get unappealable (rwt, cheating bans) when theyre absolutely certain
---
They are unappealable always. Doesn't even matter what ban type it is. People have gotten unbanned or moved to a temp ban thru Reddit/twitter though. To top it off incidences like mod Jed show they aren't perfect. Yes they unbanned thecaccounts involved with that but only if you could prove it at the right time and place because god forbid just having a single support system you can consistently go to for any problem without needing to check Reddit or twitter all the time for updates like with the pure ruining update.
---
Fossil islands mushroom place still managed to destroy my fps
---
You're complaining about spending literal seconds to keep your account secure once a month?? You have issues 
---
How did i never know this existed. I almost have 2 accts with 99 hunter.
---
Hahaha I love your comment
---
I have my own questions for you but I feel like those would give you ways to ignore the authenticator delay and hiding poll result questions, so I won't be asking any questions this week.
---
I feel like an idiot what does kc mean?
---
Nice.
---
You're just as much a problem as them because instead of making the problem bigger than it it you're minimizing it. When i got hacked(and banned cause the hacker botted) it took my months to get my account back. Everytime i posted on here people would tell me i deserved it because i must have bought the account. Had to make a twitter account and pm a mod a few times for only then to get nit looked at. And guess what? the ban was lifted. Comments like yours are only going to give people more incentive to call everyone a liar, while in fact that there's always a minority that did get dicked over.
---
‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you take a seat right over there?"
---
Ok so the best way to help your friend is to let him kill you. It cant be obvious though you have to put up a fight.
---
'' Extremely strong recovery knowledge '' Nice flex
---
yes and people in at the drive thru as well
---
Holy shit that's so cool
---
Better way to do it is have it be passw0rd as your password. Hope this helps.
---
Lol down voted for asking reasonable questions... This Reddit is a joke. A bunch of lemmings that follow whatever is being upvoted without actually questioning it. No wonder people want poll results hidden if the whole osrs community is thus easily led.
---
In all honesty I think longer time should have been given for people to have chance to have their accounts fixed. Like I said it sucks his account gets ruined. Hopefully jagex will sort his and anyone elses account out that they fucked up.
---
I don't do much PKing, but I believe this is the type of situation where we would tell Brodaki to "Sit, kid", correct?
---
toppest tier meme
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people think there‚Äôs no support. Every time I‚Äôve needed support I got it pretty easily ü§î what more do people need exactly? And why?
---
Is it possible to move the tool leprechauns to more convenient locations within the farming patches? Having them located in the gap between the allotments, flower patches, and herb patches would save a lot of running back and forth to note items. Having the compost bin nearby would be a bonus.
---
This is why u skull friends 
---
Ah yeah, I forgot 99 wasn't max exp, but 200m or something right? Thanks.
---
You pray Magic with Blowpipe, together with Super Antifire that'll make you immune, however you're tanking the range attacks. With a DHCB you'd pray range and tank the mage hits. It's not a big difference in damage you take, given that the Blowpipe has way better DPS than any weapon aside from DHCB at Vorkath.
---
You seem to have suffered a stroke there friend
---
lol I've only ever used that entrance. 
---
2 liter machine broke. We got a 1 liter tho.

---
Time invested was more what I was on about, of course a mini game is going to less time to finish than a skill?
---
I guess, but what do you suggest for runecrafting?
---
seeing as you brought it up, I mean the skills literally called rune crafting.. 
---
I can‚Äôt see what else you wanna do within the skill?
---
Solid 9.2/10
---

I didn't know Michael j fox plays osrs

all that just incase some novelty account manages to fuck up, why not just stop them from fucking up instead, by allowing them to lock an attack option.

What time do clan events/bossing usually happen? Timezone would help also! Thanks!
---
I might just do a few chests every now and then for the fun, I guess getting tank legs early on is Great
---
thiccness aside, those sandals are dope. i'd buy them irl
---
Ah I see. Thanks man! 
---
You're the second to mention rune drags.. what stats do you have to kill them?
---
Lmao wow
---
Ah makes sense. 
---
Friend of mine had the 50 91 42 94 94 15pray build. At 79 cb I think(He went for a bit lower hp).
---
It does really well but the money is really a problem.
---
Btw you can test out the build on turny worlds to finalize your decision if you want to put in the effort.
---
I mean I think it can be fun, it's just not explored enough.
---
Not sure how time locking would encourage tanking?
---
I just completed all the sub quests for rfd then tried going through the portal. Come to find out I have to complete this quest reeee
---
This is the new wallpaper for my apartment
---
Same thing happened to me... 75 def, 1 att, 1 str was my goal. I was at sand crabs training the last remaining def xp to lvl 75 and SOMEHOW I gained a few str lvls. I caught it very fast but was using pots so it happened in only a few seconds. 
---
I contacted a mod about it saying that it must have been a bug as I knew I couldn't have misclicked; I was extremely careful about it. Sadly they said there was no proof it was from a bug which really sucks. 
---
Having one extra combat level doesnt really put me at too much of a disadvantage, I just hate the constant reminder knowing it could NOT have been a misclick. Having spent hundreds of hours Skilling on my account, it really sucks that it happened right before I was almost done with my combat levels. 
---
Please Jagex, reconsider negative xp lamps or something similar. I dont care how many limitations they put on them or if they cost an absurd amount of gold or whatever. All of us pures who've had this happen to them, mistake or unavoidable bug, were only talking about a few hundred xp gained, if that. 
---
Why hire QA when the players will do it for free? 
---
thieving is honestly the worst thing in the world
---
Jmod smackdowns are more common than the poster not being a scumbag lol
---
First off, I really appreciate your response. You're absolutely right that there is spite voting on both sides and I did not mention that. It is definitely a design flaw that 25% of a playerbase can significantly effect the state of the game. I think you hit the nail on the head. 
---
&gt; first and preferably, the two groups recognize this and stop being asshats.  
---
This is a solution I desperately wish to be viable. Unfortunately, you're right in that it won't ever happen. It's like trying to end a feud and there's already too much bad blood.
---
I personally am a huge fan of your first suggestion. Jagex needs to take control of the balance of their game. A developer simply can't afford that responsibility to its players. Players are naive and biased and they don't know what's good the game. Imagine a class based game that polled balance changes. Players of x class would be much less inclined to vote to nerf THEIR class. They would much more likely vote to nerf others or buff theirs. Not to mention only a small number of players would be experienced enough to truly understand the implications of certain changes. Only the developers can truly know how a change will affect the multiple layers of skill brackets. Therefore, it's unreasonable to ask the entire community to have the final say in the balance of PvP when only a small percentage partake and an even smaller percentage truly understand it. 
---
LOL
---
Wholesome.
---
Yes ;) - I lurk on reddit when I am at work.
---
I actually made this account with the intentions of doing blue dragons and yeah the way I did it so fast was doing dwarf cannon quest after the creation of the account then I chopped the oaks while my cannon shot then once I got 50 range I trained with just a crossbow on defense attack option 
---
They are not the same thing, PKing is a mechanic and crashing is a behavior. Pking even have warnings when players are on risk areas, lol.
---
And what do you mean Pking don't give anything to the pker?
---
The reason why, historically, is that "3rd party clients will just give out the results anyway" even though all of the major clients would honour Jagex asking them not to do that...
---
we need a lawful good and chaotic evil chart of pc players
---
Damn bro, hacked 4 times? That's not jagex's fault, you just dumb after.
---
Fair, I caught it at -2
---
He got more gold and 2 more platinums after the smackdown.. How?!
---
Stfu retard it was polled and failed 2x
---

In game, check that you have actived the option to allow you to switch using the F keys in the client.

Can an ‚ÄúEternal Slayer Helm‚Äù be added? This helm would have an enteral slayer gem instead of a regular one and allow the helm to be equipped with unlimited teleports to the slayer ring locations. It could also be slightly graphically different one the normal or imbued one (this one would be able to be imbued still). 
---
Would it be possible to rework the reward system for tears of guthix? Currently it grants XP to your lowest skill, which in a lot of cases can be a combat stat, preventing accounts from using the content. My only ideas are to allow players to choose the skill that they are rewarded XP to (given that they are a certain total level, or that the skill they're rewarding XP to is high enough).
---
I was hacked once. Not because of a jagex leak but email leak. Learned my lesson since and have 2 step on email as well now but it took me so much trouble to get the account back. People being ultra skeptical like you didn't help.
---
Ah yes you are right ! Didn‚Äôt know the ferocious gloves existed
---
That‚Äôs just fucked up.
---
You should get a combat bracelet or granite gloves. (Ofc Bgloves would be the goal but untill you get addy those are your friends)
---
Fury/Bring are quite good.
---
If you need to be tanky pick yourself some torags up its cheap and really tanky.

I have to disagree mate. Pmods often keep low profile, and mute spammers daily. The fact you don‚Äôt notice that, is exactly why I created this post.
---
I do take your reply serious though man. I get that it seems it boosts ego, and that they feel they‚Äôre above the community.
---
However, let‚Äôs set that aside - and let‚Äôs come to a conclusion on how to keep the extreme toxicity/botting issues away.
---
dang i didnt kno that thx
---
You misunderstand, I am asking for more of the actual identity of runecrafting and less of "this is just what it has been". From a literal perspective, the *runecrafting* part of runecrafting is *crafting the runes* which is what you spend about an eighth of the time actually doing.

Many people simply hate the grind and only enjoy pvming for drops or pvping.

Thank you for telling me my own thought process. If I were a bit more presumptuous I'd start telling you yours.

pking for no rewards is a behavior lmao this is why you're autistic enough to name yourself Alpha_Centurion

I agree that Jad phases and "AoE of death" are overused. But just something simple like a boss with high ranged defence or spawning minions with a combat style different from the main boss would create some variety.

I posted on that thread and I still haven't had my XP rolled back. As this point I'm about ready to turn it into a main. Makes me mad that I spend hours making a special account only to have it ruined by an update. And then I can't even have it reverted back.
---
I've said it multiple times and I'll say it again. We NEED a way to get negative XP in skills for situations like this. Put some safeguards in place like an XP cap or a requirement (for example Addy gloves) so people can't abuse it and allow us to have full control over our account builds. The fact that a simple missclick or a server error can cause someone to lose thousands of hours of work is ridiculous. 
---
Lose 40 hours fishing to buy a bond to grind more 10 hours to buy a bond to grind more. Instead of working for 1 hour to play grinding for upgrades for 1 month. I think you outplayed yourself.

It's not too bad to do around 100 chests without diary. Won't miss a lot in the long run if you do 1000 chests with diary. I also got tank legs before diary

Hi VladimirMarx1917,

Dinhs and justiciar just to name two. Justiciar is literally brand new and is designed to be THE tank set. Your defense bonuses with it actually reduce damage taken instead of just increasing the chance of getting a 0.

Within the last few months something changed the way you open bird nests. You used to be able to just like spam click the last one in your inventory and it'd open them from start to finish. Some update recently changed it to where you have to click them individually to open. So spam clicking the last one in your inventory just only opens the last one.
---
Can this be reverted back? Please. As someone whos opened a lot of nests and will continue to be opening more, this is an annoying change out of no where.
---
If not, why was it changed?

How do you know they knew there wouldn't be rewards for PKing? Does players carry a sign above their character saying "killing me will give no rewards, because I don't have anything in my bag"?

Of course. I likes how it looked and spent hours trying to use it but always felt the same way afterwards. Glad it works for some people though

good meele training that isnt shit means more high combat players, which means more competition for old players who are already maxed combat
---
I mean it would depend on how many you plan on doing since the rarer drops (d legs, d skirt and even draconic visage are worth quite a bit more than the normal drops). Short term rune crossbow will be better profit I believe but if you're doing a lot I'd say Blowpipe but that's all just anecdotal evidence rather than any proof.
---
SLAYER.

It's about 50k to just buy them off the GE.

This is a joke, I don't use it while driving.

Moral of this story: don't believe everything you read online!

hey man we're just joking around here
---
Nope. You don‚Äôt speak for everyone. I don‚Äôt pvp but I never want it removed from this game. I‚Äôve been playing this game since 03 and pvp has always been a big part of the game. I thoroughly enjoy watching pking videos while I‚Äôm skilling. PvP has a very rich history in this game and should never ever be removed. 
---
Yeah legitimate circumstances are usually sorted out pretty quickly in my experience. I quit RS3 the summer of 2015 and tried logging in around May 2016 to see I had a perm ban for botting from March 2016. Turns out my account had been hacked and used on the OSRS (which I had never played). Not sure what the hacker was using it for but I was wearing a nature tiara and my combat stats had all been trained to level 10.
---
Anyway, I was able to get in contact with a JMod and gave him all the info I could and about a week later my account was unbanned. The offense is still on my account but says "Quashed" next to it.
---
Can anyone clue an /r/all user in on what a pure account is, and how exactly it got ruined?
---
Not trying to make anything out of anything. But I agree that it's a waste of time. You are ignoring anything that contradicts your way of reasoning.
---
Bolt pouch isn't worth using. If you want a bolt switch, then bring it in your inventory. You won't need more than one bolt switch, so the bolt pouch will be taking up the same space as your switch
---
Because in like 99.9% of the cases the ban was applied rightfully. Jagex doesn't have the manpower for those unique cases.
---
Are any being sold :o
---
r/whoosh 
---
Yeah but can you blame us?

Read the post MaN

Didn't Jagex already try to end Runelite once with a Cease and Desist letter? I don't think intentionally going around Jagex's decisions like that would be a smart move.
---
To sell bulk I've seen as low as $0.45, buying it you can get around $0.65 at 1b+. Those ~$0.90/mil sites are for the sub $200 normies. My friend is highly addicted to RS staking, he's about $2k in the hole even with a high win/loss ratio. Last time he got tilted and rage staked 3-4 times in a row to get cleaned. 
---
I guess I'm an enabler, cause I train the accounts he uses ü§ó
---
Wait what? you can add people to your friends list and just see where they are no matter what? Do they need to be using OSBuddy too?
---
The point is, you're wrong. People don't do things just because it's meta.
---
Love the agility one!
---
The poll to fix that has already passed
---
I feel so left out, do they not think my account is sexy? Why not me hackers?
---
I don't think soldiers in Afghanistan went around killing innocent citizens lol
---
Yes easily although I'd advise doing two things. Firstly do it on task (either aviansies or kree boss task) with a slayer helmet (I). Secondly, use chins. If you don't use chins kills will be very slow, especially with a budget set up.
---
Jagex doesn't have time for that.. Then people would continously start these posts for JMod attention.

If anybody is interested.  Some of these designs are available on Etsy.  My shop name is **OSRStuffs** and prices range from $3 for the Bandos pin upper right to $26 for all 21 runes as a set.
---
If you want a sold out design, I make limited quantities of each pin and will not be remaking them.  You might be able to find one for resale on the Facebook group "The Runescape Pin Grand Exchange". 
---
Thanks for all the support guys! If it wasnt for you I wouldnt have been able to keep making my designs.

Why is bow string so cheap? It currently buys for 57 ea and used to be around 140-180.
---
Someone suggested Konar but it doesn't even drop it (through keys).
---
I honestly don't see why something like hiding poll results, isn't something the Old School Development team can talk about. It is definitely something that would provoke a discussion.
---
Besides, there is an easy temporary solution the OSRS developers can do. Currently when you open up the Poll Booth, you're shown the results of the current poll. You need to click on the VOTE button before you're allowed to vote. How about just swapping the default page to the voting page and change that VOTE button into a RESULTS page?
---
That is something Jagex could have easily done in the QoL month I recon. It shouldn't take more than 15-30 minutes to do.
---
Anyway, I do want to thank you for this response.

All of PVP's rich history is griefing lmao. Also of course I don't speak for everyone- just the majority who want to play Runescape without worrying about being ganked.

I made it a meme in my lobby last night to hunt down the dudes in DH with 1hp (I ended up recruiting some brave acolytes to assist me). The DH dudes knew we were coming for them and they would all take off when we ran up on the portals screaming REEEE with like 5 splatters in pursuit. Made PC bearable for a little bit lol

what would really be funny is the people that upvote it without reading it.   to them i would say,  "wtf"

what is the achievement diary ring for?

Yes some are sold out though.  Check etsy my shop name is OSRStuffs

Thank you.

Thanks. I also could wait until I can get a blow pipe. If I have blow pipe should I use crossbow and blow pipe or just blow pipe?

Torags set is still kinda useless though

Bots spinning flax

I understand your confusion, but it's not a super difficult concept so let me try and explain. If you're doing 2 seaweed rolls every 40 minutes you effectively have a 1/3750 chance every 0.66 hours. If you're doing 2 seaweed rolls every 40 minutes as well as 2 cactus patches every 9.3 hours, your effective chance will go up. Now if you do all the things I listed, it goes up even more. Feel free to either PM me on here or read the wiki page on the skill 'farming' if you have any questions.
---
But can they afford good power infrastructure 
---
Ibans till tank legs, plate~&gt; trident ~&gt; ktop, bot, ahrims top and bot
---
No, just use addy rune aren‚Äôt worth the price. It‚Äôs not a big difference in dps for 10x the price.
---
Lmao that moment when no one reads the chat box 
---
Oh yeah of course, I forgot about the mythical cluers who carry their entire bank into the wilderness.

Yeah, paying customers want customer service. What a bunch of spoiled assholes, right?

When I bike or run at the gym I will do agility. Stamina gains on both levels.

Blowpipe is higher DPS, but shorter range. If you can't effectively pull the healers off Jad with the range of the BP, then bring a crossbow to switch to

This isn't an exhaustive list but here I go.

Holy wrench, bonecrusher, Barrows Gloves, fighter torso, elite void, slave amulet ie, berserker ring I, archers ring I, amulet of Fury (if no torture and anguish), whip, Blowpipe, trident of the seas or swamp, tormented bracelet(if you can afford it), mage arena 2 cape, occult necklace, fire cape, slayer helmet I, dragon defender, Ava's assembler.

Yup lets give pmods more power surely that will end well.. 
---
If the person is on your minimap, it highlights that they are there. They will show up green. Works on any player.

Just blowpipe.

Will there ever be a Barrows pet? Perhaps with a gamble system like BA? 
---
So weird no one suggested getting a torso
---
Nice 
---
i know but just keep playing... it isnt that hard

Cannonballs are the most afk training method to smithing. It‚Äôs not hard to buy steel bars and do them on an alt while you play a main. I did cballs to 99 when cballs weren‚Äôt this low (around 250 a ball so 1 bar was 1k). It could also be a bunch of bots dumped them last night after training. 
---
you dont understand how easy it is to recover an account do you?
---
you only need a couple of question which can easily be found or asked from the account owner himself
---
He needs to be tagged in every post like this until the end of time, shame that moron for the rest of his time here.
---
There's a myriad of technical and logistical problems with letting people reduce their own stats on a whim. 
---
You're going to require **A LOT** of exceptions. All of which will have to be "hard-coded."
---
1) You could never let these accounts into the wilderness. Ever. It would be entirely unfair for people to reset their stats to a perfect scenario and then have an ultimate pking or rushing build. EG: 99 range, 10 hitpoints permanently. It would decimate anyone in the level 50 combat bracket. 
---
2) How do you prevent people from unlocking gear through quests and then lowering stats to a point where they can use despite 'lacking' the requirements. It's easy to say "add requirements to the gear itself" instead of the quest, but this adds even more complication. Not only do you need to run through the entire list of quest-obtained gear and add a requirement to it, but also make sure that it doesn't affect currently existing accounts in any way, especially special builds. 
---
3) This is the fun one. People who reset their stats and then complain about it later and want them returned to normal. I'm not even going to try to explain the enormous company-wide migraine that would follow. 
---
And then there's like a million other small things you'd have to change. Even one mistake in an update like this could result in massively unexpected results or problems. It's REALLY complicated to do something like this, and it's just not worth the effort. 
---
If someone's accounts is ruined because of a bug, or a jagex oversight or mistake, then fix those cases manually as they occur. That's all jagex should do. 
---
Yes I know, and I think it's a bit underwhelming that they aren't useful in very many places
---
This is why I'm fine with Venezuelans being banned

I haven‚Äôt done mort hard yet. I‚Äôm a bit over 100kc at narrows and have 2 tank legs, verac top, ahrims bottom. I don‚Äôt grind it like crazy. I do a few runs here and there when bored. I‚Äôm still under 100cb. All you need really is ibans. YouTube some videos on kiting the brothers.
---
To be fair though, after losing Alice and Oswald, Walt didn‚Äôt want to lose any other character he‚Äôd create from then on. He got fucked over hard and still came out on top. Not only that, but Mickey Mouse was what finally got him going after being fucked over. IMO it‚Äôs something that should belong to Disney and have a copyright forever.
---
Curious question, do people actually look at the poll results before voting as much as we think they do? I mean, you have to scroll down to see almost all of them. I just click the vote button.
---
This is strange to me, given that other companies almost certainly have to deal with people who definitiely and knowingly broke the rules trying to get their accounts back. I don't think anyone expects anything different happening to Jagex, were they to expand their CS team and revise certain (very frustrating) policies. 
---
The problem right now is that players have very few places to turn to when they are falsely banned (especially for unappealable offences, e.g. RWT, bug abuse), lose control of their account, are being targeted for harrassment, are scammed, lose items to glitches/oversights, etc. There's also no guarantee, even if you do reach out to @JagexSupport or post to reddit, that you'll receive any help whatsoever. 
---
I'm sure that Jagex, internally, have very good reasons not to expand their CS department drastically, and certainly some for not completely revising the appeal process and the powers of CS staff. If that's true, then what comes with the decision to do nothing is a very untrusting and tired playerbase. 
---
Do you not enjoy slayer? Then yes your suffering, but not because the game wants you to suffer, no because your a masochist who apparently does things he hates.
---
Go get 25k kc like them dwh bros and get back at us when you don't have the items. It isn't even like your dry, you seem to be doing pretty well as far as drop rates go. Just not on one particular item.
---
Or better yet kill 28000 harpie bug swarms for a Yew short bow, then you'll know the definition of suffering.
---
Lol yeah

---
Jagex has commented in the past (like a year ago) that in a large portion of cases that Authenticator delay would do nothing, seriously its just a big fucking meme that uninformed people are falling for. And lots of people with unjust bans have had them reversed, people on the internet lie and most complaining about false bans are lying.
---
The only good pure is a ruined pure. If he still wants to get the name on a stupid account he can change the name of the normal account. I don't know if there is a delay on how long it takes for the old name to be freed but it's better than not having the name.

I‚Äôd be down

lol yeah I'm sure if they got no money they would love to stand in a cave all day doing nothing except killing one person every hour occasionally

Is it tho.
---
There are a lot of things mentioned that have been left hanging. TBH, I was a bit surprised they did a Clue Expansion before the BH Rework...
---
But they did say they were going to have an answer to hiding Poll Results in early 2019, which meant or turned into the Big Questions Stream thing. We also have the Hosidius Rework that got pushed back a fair bit now, originally planned pre-Kebos. There is the BH Rework that is still coming. And there is also the Death Rework from last years integrity changes that still need to be revisited, with mention of it early 2019 once time becomes available.
---
If I had to guess, I'd suspect most of these delays is at least partly due to the changing of staff in the past months. This is especially true for the shuffling in the Community Managers with so many things happening between newsposts and the QoL Month Dev Blogs, but we also did have some new hires that needed to undergo training too. So I'd expect that between now and April things should get back to a normalish pace as the Dev Blogs slow down and the teams get to work on their bigger projects like Prif.
---
All I see is *****************
---
What about an in-game clock?  It doesn't seem that hard to integrate.
---
Maybe they kill because they think the person is carrying something of value, ever considered it?
---
They definitely could do a tank type boss. It would have be to done through a type-less damage. 
---
My 5 second idea is something like one player takes a special relic that when wielded, protects them from the typeless damage of the bosses minions (or the boss itself). The tank then has to pull the aggro to ensure his team doesn't take the massive and/or rapid typeless damage.
---
They rolled the game back to fix the twisted bow spawn issue. This bug happened before that and the rollback didn't affect it.
---
Well thank you, my friend. I appreciate your kind words. I really understand that dying in PvP areas is frustrating when you're not there to do PvP. But yeah, whether we like it or not it's a part of the game. The game is completely playable without ever entering the wilderness or a PvP world, too. Sorry to all those non-PvPers who die in the wilderness, but remember the reason the wilderness is worth going into is largely because of these deaths. Otherwise it'd just be another spot to grind and the value of its content would fall as it became easier to obtain. 
---
Ask your mother
---
It's really rare to see people defending themselves to that extent. Most people who lied and got caught deleted their Reddit account.
---
This guy writes reams of essays. I don't get it, he says he's gonna recover it back later as well. Makes absolutely zero sense as the original owner will be able to recover again in the future in the same manner.
---
The best part about high profile smackdowns is posts like these. The ones where people go "everyone else is so retarded" which then gets upvoted to the top as well.

Okay thanks

Nah man, it just seems like you label anyone who doesn't magically know your unwritten rules as a toxic player. You don't seem to be able to see the game from a casual players mindset.

Why doesnt jagex have a actual customer support team/livechat/phone number/anyone working for them in 2019? 11$ a month and 100k+ players bruh cmon the hell u doin over there put the cookies n tea down and start doing some interviews for some human customer service.

Imagine getting not only your account but also your car hacked. 
---
Thoughts on adding the ability to note logs at tool leprechauns? This would help us weirdos that like to cut the trees that we plant. There currently is not much incentive to cutting your own logs as you have to often drop them or make multiple bank trips per farm run. 
---
Interpret it however you want. Nothing in the post is disrespectful or demeaning. It's simply my opinion that I ask others to consider.
---
Up voted for visibility, but it's jagex fault for people not checking things before going to train. 
---
I can't sticky other's comments but I could make a comment linking to his... Probably should do that.
---
And I think they don't want to bring it up on regular Q&amp;As because they have before, but it is quickly forgotten and just asked again the next week. They mentioned a bit ago now that they wanted to do a Big Questions stream and then chop it up into separate videos so they could easily refer to them when the questions come up instead of having to explain it every time. In most cases, I doubt it will result in much new information and won't satisfy most the community, but not much more they can do.

Except that typless damage ignores defence bonus

Why don‚Äôt all skills have equipment that increases xp gains? Just curious. I mean most people dread training Agility, RC and other skills and such.

Are there plans to bring other such guilds as the new farming guild? I mean most skills have their own guild or training facility, why not all?
---
It lacks political correctness. Lol. But seriously. Why isn‚Äôt there a guild for skills that are more cumbersome?

Any and all support is welcome üëç

Admit it OP you've been thinking about Swampletics and wanted to try and sneak an item into Morytania. Nuh uh mister, were wise to you. 
---
Yellow cape season Swampletics is already so good, you just have to wait for it to happen. And spoiler this item was never added, I'm sorry.
---
We‚Äôve had additions to pvm in form of raids, slayer bosses and soon a gauntlet that‚Äôll be for solo players. But what about a nex style boss? One that you have to fight in a team and you can fight it many times without having any form of buildup or any encounters before it. 
---
Nostalgia :(

Sea Shanty 2
---
Nah it'd probably be down there with 07reddit. 
---
Amen to that.
---
It's not MY unwritten rules, ever since I started playing the game people follow this system, and if you go to any place you will see other people following it. Also, being a casul is not the same as being toxic. You can be casual without being toxic. :)
---
That's why I love it when people crash. Really adds to the competitive nature of the game.
---
[Put them to good use](https://jog.fm/workout-songs/at/100/bpm?sort=popularity)
---
Right, because when I go to kill bots, and a real player talks and I apologize and stop, that's greifing, right? When I gear up my main and sit near wildy bosses, offering protection to people killing them, I'm obviously just greifing pvmers.
---
If all pvpers like to do is grief, then I guess all pvmers do is scream at the monitor when they don't get the drop they want, talk shit to other pvmers for not having high kcs or all bis gear, and crash lower levels all day because you're higher level and therefore it is your right!
---
It's super easy to cherry pick the worst things, then apply it to a large group. The issue is that isn't accurate at ALL. Do we want to talk about my 230 raid kc and how 1/4 of them are solos, or my 800+ on damn near every single boss, or the simple fact that as a 15 year vet I enjoy every aspect of this game?
---
Not every single last person is an asshole. Yes, there are griefers out there, but just because they exist doesn't mean every single pvper is one. Just like pvm griefers exist, but we don't call every single pvmer a waste of space abd throw every insult under the sun at them.

No I've already gotten my double xp and gotten rich from their 10b drop parties. 
---
Can you link me to one of these where it's proved that the OP bought an account?
---
I haven't seen that yet.
---
The problem with NMZ is that they patched the 6 hour timer to 20 minutes before I could benefit from it :(

---
good luck.
---
I understand that things need to be polled so we as a community have a say what's added, but that shouldn't apply to poll results, are they really that terrified of the community they need to poll something like that? nutty.
---
Idk about strats man, just found ourselves getting more kills in a trip taking more pray and less food, praying melee all up it's arse. Minimises profits but I guess it's good for pet hunting and KC, plus we wanted to avoid banking as much as possible because none of us can PK so any team would shit on us lmao
---
For some reason I see James instead of Tamas
---
They should make Penance skirt the optimal leg piece for Melee/Ranged defense in ranged setups for 40-45 defense. Give it similar (or possibly slightly higher) range bonus compared to black d'hide chaps, at the cost of less magic defense. 
---
This will give accounts (likely zerkers) an alternative, tankier option over Void. It being a repairable item means it could be a good gold sink and could potentially make ranged tanks more viable while their account is in-progress.
---
Losing it in deep wildy along with a lower magic defense will mean it will only be used in BH and PvP worlds.
---
How much has the blackout in Venezuela really affected the rs economy/certain items? or is it mostly the communities perception and knee jerk reaction thats most of the cause?
---
This is sorta similar when hydra released and blood/death runes crashed super hard, kiearan checked and said the amount was fine, that it was just the community thinking the game was being flooded with them and the reaction that caused it.
---
I guess a follow up would be, how much/how often does the community affect prices in this regard? Any specific/significant/memorable cases the couch can remember? Any long term effects? 
---
[Comment from Mod Sween on the "Hide Poll Results" questions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aztaxy/submit_your_questions_for_this_weeks_qa_130319/eiaceut/)
---
&gt; Buy a house after someone moved out? Not yours, 
---
the situation is diffrent here.
---
the example should be like this, goverment gives you a housing becouse of your situation, and you sell that house with out any documentation and also illegaly since goverment isnt giving it for you to sell but to live in it, and latter you call the cops on the guy for living in your house, he will say "but i payed for it!" no documentation, shit out of luck.
---
also about the car, it would be like me selling you a car with zero documentation and just geting cash, i can latter report it as theft and say you stole it.
---
yes you will not get hacked but theres people that wants to do these activitys.
---
Why would you not want proper account security (authenticatior removal delay and it being harder to recover accounts)? Im starting to believe u are recovering accounts/ hacking accounts youself? Why else would someone say no to better security?
---
On second thought it's Tamas
---
I've never been into pures either but that's probably because I never had interest in PKing. Thanks for the suggestion, not really just about the name though it's the whole account really.
---
EVE Online, Checkmate.
---
It's a buguette
---
Love you bud
---
is this what adderall does to you
---
Love this idea! 
---
Explanation: A pure is an account that doesn't train certain level's and finds ways to train other levels so that they can be as low a combat level as possible able to output as much DPS as possible for a lower level account.
---
They'll do things like 99 strength and 1 defense, which means they hit like a truck, but can also take huge amounts of damage due to not having defense levels like everyone else.
---
Pures became a thing a long time ago so now it's basically the norm, you hit hard, have a lower level overall, and lower defenses, which allows for usually pretty quick high damage fights.
---
The /best/ pures can do some really insane shit where they'll do like 5-10 really accurate clicks in under .6 seconds to maximize their damage output. Quick little video example [here](https://youtu.be/O7JiDj5EjEA?t=70).
---
Now, the way the account was ruined is that You don't want to gain any XP in certain skills Over a certain amount as it'll cause you to get extra combat levels, which 1) looks ugly as fuck 2) makes it so you're not the lowest possible combat level.
---
People have quit entire accounts over one misclick of the wrong XP type because it doesn't hold the "prestige" as having all your stats at exactly the level you want them at holds.
---
Same goes for Mournings End part 2, not really hard just suuper boring and tedious.
---
Oh my.
---
You got a point. My 1st cousin is autistic, so when I first started hearing it as an insult (seriously, no use used to say this to each other back in 06-10) I was a little annoyed.
---
But then I remembered I say shit like that's gay, fag, etc. And that shit doesn't bother me even though I got nothin against gay people. So yeah autism 
---
Even if you did it wouldn't matter, OSRS wasn't released until 2013 so all your stats from your level 120 would be on RS3 so you'd have to restart anyway.
---
"How do you deal with the healers" "The what?"
---
? are you stupid.
---
pking at revs isn't standing on one world 
---
Thanks for the reply! How did you go about 70 prayer? Did you just kill green dragons 
---
Ooh, ooh! I remember this post! 
---
That sounds like a great account to scout everywhere with no risk
---
That's actually real lol. Runelite
---
username? gonna recover ur acc now ty
---
And if you buy inferno capes or bot you‚Äôre breaking the rules, but we still know people are going to do it. What‚Äôs your point?
---
Ok but these are just lines with images on random places
---
Well, data breach do happen. And it doesn‚Äôt even have to happen to Jagex for it to do damage to your Runescape account. 
---
At the beginning of this year over 770 million emails had their information posted online. So make sure you all go change your email password. Check your email login history and activate your email‚Äôs 2-step verification. 
---
I argue this point with so many people. It's op. Period.
---
This is actually an interesting idea.
---
Bro in reality, if you have a few copies of a real password and your bank pin, nothing can happen. If you die, your account dies with you. 
---
well you can also use recoil and veng.
---
That is a completely different gamemode it's meant to be like that but if you accidentally got attack or defence level on a pking account that should be totally different case in my opinion
---
400 hours on the low end. Grinding the GP for 77 prayer minimum, both prayer scrolls, and other shit takes a long time. Plus actually getting base 90‚Äôs as well
---
I just started my grind yesterday. I like these odds.
---
if changing your password at least makes it stop for a couple days, your account has been compromised. if they persist after you changed your password, more than likely phising.
---
Any reason you think they shouldn't be hidden? As far as I know people only want them hidden because of bandwagon voting, what would be the downside to hiding them?
---
Made 40m off of one yesterday, biggest bet won was 8m. I don't know if they're honest, but it's worked for me.
---
Except they are *your* unwritten rules though, precisely because they are unwritten. Everyone's version will be slightly different. What you see as a dick move might be totally fine with another player. 
---
Like me, I don't mind sharing spots with people and I don't mind competing for resources to an extent. 3-4 people all fighting for the same 4 fire giants I'll hop for sure. But if it's just me and one other guy sharing 3-4 fire giants I'm not bothered by that. And I've had people be completely fine with that and I've also had people tell me in-game the unwritten rule is 2 giants per person, or 3 giants per person or even 4 giants per person. And then on the far end of the spectrum I've had people cannoning hogging 8+ mobs yell at me to hop because I'm taking one of "their" kills and that I should either hop or kill myself. 
---
Alright, I'll start mapping out what is best to do and to make my own ultracompost. Thanks!
---
The resistance to micro transactions got me lol  
---
Welp. It's time to inform you of some quests /u/jonesy2626
---
* Waterfall Quest
---
* Vampyre Slayer
---
* Tree Gnome Village
---
* Tree Gnome Stronghold
---
* Merlin Quest line 
---
* Spirit's of Elid
---
* Fight Arena
---
If you haven't done those quests they all lead you into Monkey Madness very well. You'll be mid 50's on attack and strength with high 40's in defense. No combat required and it takes maybe 3-4 hours of questing.
---
Train Range at chickens using a shortbow and bronze arrows until level 20, it's slow but cheap. If you get your defense done you can pay 1,000 GP in Relleka to go to Waterbirth Island. Take your shortbow and like 3k bronze arrows then go stand near the northern spawn where there are two of them then afk and reset every 10 minutes. By the end of 3k bronze arrows you will likely be 40+ range. After that mithril/steel darts are cheap as dirt(Steel darts are like 7gp each last I checked) and you can afk until 60+ at Waterbirth in about 6-12 hours playtime.
---
For Magic I would buy like 4-5k casts of fire strike, it's cheap and anyone can afford this, even ironmen. Then go to blue dragons in taverly dungeon.(Search the wiki for dusty key on how to get in there) You can safe spot blue dragons at any level, you should bring an anti-fire shield as a precaution but you don't even need that as they can only ever attack you when you run out of the safespot. Buy about 40 or so teleports to Falador, the runes will be fine. So grab like say 40 law runes, 120 air runes, and 40 water runes. Then all you do is bank the blue d'hide and d bones. 40 trips will get you roughly 400 dragon bones and 400 blue leather. Sell the blue leather as your profit. Take the 400 bones to World 330 and use a gilded altar, you'll fly past 43 prayer and wonder why you didn't do this before.
---
50/50
---
You can vengeance and purposely get hit to kill Jad faster.
---
No shit, if they answer in the exact way this community wants everyone will REEEEEE. So they just aren't answering until they know how to answer
---
I don‚Äôt remember, but probably around 35-40 minutes. I‚Äôm not very fast and I play pretty passively. Also, I did this whole thing on mobile so a lot of missclicks were made 
---
Thanks for the math and the location list. That really helps me get an idea of where to put/do everything. As well as explaining Tithe farm.
---
i was in the wildy yesterday, running from someone after my spade when I noticed a swamp in the distance and just had to right click, seeing if i could s u c c it, losing my spade but gaining valuable knowledge in the process.
---
They did ignore it. During QoL-month Jagex specifically asked the community for questions that failed a poll. Someone suggested hiding poll results and that post ended up being the most top-voted suggestion in that thread. 
---
See [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aztaxy/submit_your_questions_for_this_weeks_qa_130319/ei9wk3u/) with links to those threads. 
---
Bumpy road :)
---
‚ÄúThe best course of action‚Äù? So you‚Äôre calling Jagex who‚Äôs been doing this shit for a while incompetent? Seek help 
---
maybe because twitch prime offers runescape membership as a reward. there is/was a recent promotion that also offered rs3 cosmetics.
---
At least now you can go get an inferno cape relatively more easily than if you didn't have any of these
---
Yup. I can‚Äôt offer 10 hours a day as I did back in the day due to adult commitments 
---
I heard you can find it next to the farming guild
---
No one seems to realize this is loot from the nmz boss "Me" and not actual attempts by OP...
---
Lance&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
&gt;What you see as a dick move might be totally fine with another player
---
Yes, that's why people always have such nice reactions when some random asshole come kill their sandcrabs. Yeah, maybe I'm trippin with this unwritten rule of not ksing others.
---
Nah, wasnt driving :)
---
Just a cool thing to try
---
Oh dang yeah I forgot about that lol. So I guess it‚Äôs possible to 3 hit with the bow + venge
---
So are you implying I have no control over my own actions? I don't even how to take that. Just feels like you're just assuming that because I pk in any way shape or form that I grief just to do it. 
---
If you die to either of them you just pay 100k and you get everything back
---
They would‚Äôve had to do it regardless, I just expedited the process. 
---
Oh my god could you imagine think a woman ever owes you sex??
---
Do you talk to human girls?
---
Pets are shit tho...
---
I hate pvp and I still think it‚Äôs reasonable to have one on both servers. They have like 4 different blast furnace worlds for each timezone!
---
Because people are too lazy to enable authenticator on their account AND their email. They also usually won‚Äôt set a bank pin or change their passwords regularly. And most of all they usually have none of that and click fake links. It‚Äôs very easy to secure your account takes under 5 minutes 
---
Look up flinching. Can easily be done that way.
---
ERROR ERROR does not compute 
---
Well done m80
---
We had a house guest at the moment and my wife knows when I‚Äôm raiding to leave me be but I let her know when I‚Äôm going prior so she knows. 
---
My house guest came up behind me and started rappidly tapping me on my mouse arm whilst in olm, let‚Äôs just say she left the next day because of the way I told her to leave me alone.
---
Its a good meme but been done dozens of times
---
Tzhaar-Healer for mayor! He will bring the jobs back!
---
It might have something to do with Machinima privating all of their videos.
---
Yeah this whole thing is really cringy. People are literally commenting that she owed him sex because she lead him on
---
The fuck?
---
Where do you get ¬Ω divided by ¬Ω ?
---
92/99 is ¬Ω as its half of 99 lol. Just a joke.
---
the later safespot i mentioned is wrong, it‚Äôs northeastern triangle rock area to kill prime, safe from supreme. had it backwards. killing supreme is best done by the latter. hope you‚Äôve figured this out and are getting kills already though! 
---
yet people had the nerve to call divine ss "too op for OSRS"
---
I agree but people are getting hacked and Jagex could provide a better safety net for them
---
That does sound like a problem. They should probably be locked out of PVP areas. 
---
I always see Jagex mods saying that the delay is unnecessary and would not secure accounts that are compromised to that degree. I've noticed this video stops at "the fact is if you add authenticator delay it will-". Tough call for me on whether to take those employees at their word, just pointing this out. 
---
I agree completely about hiding poll results though and contest prizes.
---

Atleast run energy and prayer is censored, you can sleep well tonight.
---
Right, so the fishing cape for example, would be unavailable to f2p players. That's fine, but why is the cooking cape members only? Along with every other cape in a f2p area. And even if they keep it so that only members can purchase the capes, why are they "member's items" in f2p worlds. They should be allowed to equip or unequip it without having to hop to a members world.
---
Yeah I had absolute shit luck with this when I was getting them. Killed near 500 as well but it came eventually 
---
Mod mat k the type of dude to finger your ass while you sucking him off. 
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
Probably the single biggest power gap ever created in Runescape actually. It's just amazingly better than any other ranged weapon, there's a reason it costs so much. A near necessity to even try inferno.
---
what the fuck
---
I have a friend who didn't fucking change his password after the Jed incident like wtf, there is probably a lot of people like that just sitting in a leaked spreadsheet just waiting to be cracked.
---
I see it as the community being a bunch of cry babies that can‚Äôt handle PG-13 content.
---
There is already a method to keep your first skillcape untrimmed. Also they have addressed this saying that it is impossible for jagex to tell what skillcape was your first to untrim it, and they will not allow you to randomly pick on to untrim. Certain untrimmed skillcapes (like untrimmed slayer) are difficult to achieve and require lots of prep time and planning, they want people who took the time to earn and keep them untrimmed to maintain their status.
---
Go ahead
---
you alright?
---
They definitely ban sellers. There's a reason why gold sites have their gold spread across multiple accounts on different ips. There is money in it but it's a lot more effort/riskier than you'd think.
---
Wow this is was crazy helpful! All I‚Äôve been doing is AFKing kinda my magic at lava dragons in the wildy but that can be frustrating when you get killed by players for your ~15k gp gear and rune loadout. Anyway burying those bones was getting me through prayer pretty quick too but I‚Äôll try your methods! Thanks!
---
Ah okay. I always remember having a message come up saying you needed x defence to wear these if you didn't already have the level. But as I say it's vague.
---
They didnt send out a message for this via the in-game mailing system for those that dont use 3rd party sites?  Simply shocking 
---
Death to pures. 
---
This post is golden, just keeps on giving the more you look at it
---
Actually impossible as you won't ever get the required combat level to do pest control. (only having 99hp results in combat level 25)
---
Looks like he knew the whole time, trying to fake a vid to get views. gj
---
I can‚Äôt think of any other game that has this problem on a similar scale as Runescape does. It might not be their problem, but it is a problem and they‚Äôre the only ones who can do something about it on a large scale. 
---
Obsidian Cape btw
---
True, I don't think any of them can enjoy it due to there being no servers near there. It's gotta be close to 300 ping there.
---
None of those have actual stat requirements to start them. The upcoming gauntlet will, but probably is tailored towards end game content, and is more appropriate to be so. Something like NMZ with easy mode wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate to put behind a higher level quest.
---
"They introduced a lot of powerful equipment to the game, so why not keep adding more."
---
Is it not on the hiscores?
---
I'll give you my honest opinion. Most of the videos I come across are ass (especially the pvp ones). Boring content, no voice overs, poorly edited, generic music. There isn't much people haven't seen so new ironman/hcim content is boring unless it has a twist or the person is very entertaining, because the content 9 times out of 10 has been done/is boring to watch. And most of the pvp ones are just cuts of speccing people out with shitty music playing or piling with clans, which isn't impressive at all.
---
Some people are so blind, I spotted it straightaway
---
Couldn't agree more. So ridiculous... if they hide poll results, the same vocal minority begging for poll results to be hidden will be crying about how polls are rigged when things continue to pass that they don't want.
---
Oh shit does that work?
---
funny as fuck, keep the memes about this strong.
---
Please don't, I agree
---
Not really, you profit using it, unless you're slaying or nmzing with it. 
---
You can do it, and it will work, but there's a reason people are prepared to risk the extra 130k. If you're really looking to welfare pk then go for it, but if 130k is an issue I imagine the cost of 94 mage might be too. 
---
Having max cape without being maxed, is there code to prevent you wearing it if you drop a lvl? Or prevent you from using the teleports, it's a small loophole but it isn't intended and if you think about it yourself you could see there could be quite a few game breaking issues
---
These plebs aren't even old enough to remember when every gaming company was a small indie company
---
HOLY SHIT BOYS this mans living in the year 3000

How much total profit did you make? Gratz btw, totally awesome achievement!!

Basically you solo everything but everything has more HP. Your alt helps to tank some hits.

I thought it was weird at first but I completely forgot it was even on pretty quickly. Then I switched to mobile one time and was wondering why the game animations had like 2fps.

how is this comment getting so many upvotes lmao dick

Yup bp out dpses tbow in some places lol

The preserve prayer icon is a guy grabbing a chicken drumstick.

Thanks dude! 
---
tf is auth delay tho? been seeing it everywhere is my account unsafe FK! 
---
I just did it a few days ago. I had to get used to dying first, and know when to teleport out to my house. Know when to give up, give the ornate pool a thicc succ, and then come right back.

Took me at least 15 tries. What eventually won was just praying best I could, eating an invy of anglers, and standing outside of the fog.

"Yup, company is corrupt AF. I'm making this post then handing in my 2 week notice."
---
Then proceeds to out all of their dubious actions.

He's not. Members skills are grayed out in f2p worlds. 
---
Through all of this.. nobody has answered my question on what I should be doing now. It is appreciated but... uk. Talking about here and now not 20 lvls from now
---
What a horrible excuse lmao.
---
I don't see why Jagex can't hide those from the 3rd party clients.
---
Not trying to say your comment is invalid. Just starting that if that's actually Jagex's reason, they either really need to work on their privacy, or come to work better excuses.
---
Yeah there are definitely faster kills than this. This was my first tbow Jad kill so I wanted to record it. I got insane results lol

You‚Äôve been doing it for free? I‚Äôve been paying them for the opportunity.

It is to many people.

Tried to quickly look for the value, but didn't see a big number so I assumed you weren't part of RuneLite masterrace. Started looking around the rest of the GUI for evidence until I noticed it...
---
Buying accounts for Skilling and such makes no sense but pvp accounts I understand because it skips all the grinding of making a strong pvp account and gets right to the action
---
Lol you sound like a vaccinated kid
---
Damn I only noticed the inventory
---
the movements are fine IMO. It just loses the emphasis of striking those iconic poses.
---
Just want to add words of encouragement; I completed DS2 and beat the final boss on my first try after watching Slayermusiq do it twice, and I am not very good at this game.
---
Aside from some fix to something or such, the only "new" thing I'd really like to see now is a Guild Rework, mainly for the Quest Guilds but the others could use them too. I'd love to give each Quest Guild a miniquest with higher reqs than the quest (e.g. Heroes' requires 55 QP so its miniquest could require 75, putting it between Heroes' and Legends'). The miniquest could act as a followup to the original quests and as a reward, it would unlock new content in the guild, like a Deposit Box in the Heroes' Guild or content in the Legends' Guild's basement. But I'd also want to make some changes to the guilds in general that wouldn't require further unlocks, like some content in the Legends' Guild basement and changing the Heroes' Guild Trees to Yew Trees.
---
*the game* is subjective
---
Play stupid games, win stupid names.
---
I actually did 70 prayer in kind of an non-conventional way. I killed hill giants in the Catacombs of Kourend for the ensoulded heads. 
---
I did this for a few reasons
---
1) Killing Hill Giants is much faster and more chill than killing Green dragons. You don't have to worry about PKers, and you don't really have to move from a single spot.
---
Here: https://imgur.com/a/lnSTUUp
---
2) By killing them for the ensouled heads, you can stay in the same spot without leaving (As long as you have the bag to send the heads to your bank. This means less travel time (And it is right next to the Kourend Tele, so its very easy to get back to your spot. 
---
3) You end up with a lot of Catacombs resources in the end. This is not all from killing Hill's, but honestly, it mostly is. 
---
I have 138 extra shards for my arclight
---
Here: https://imgur.com/a/WgrC7pv
---
I have 35 Skotizo kills (Probably 20+ just from the Hill Giant grind)
---
Here: https://imgur.com/a/Ugk6XFe
---
4) The experience rates for killing them with lvl 60 base cmb stats is around 60k experience per hour or more. This is a really good way to get your training for cmb in while also training prayer. At green dragons, you are probably seeing 10k an hour max, as most of the time you are just running stuff to the bank. 
---
5) You end up getting a lot of Giant keys, where you can kill Obor, for things like cosmic runes, rune items for alching, and other items that are just nice to have (And with each key, you get a free head)
---
Here: https://imgur.com/a/fMvNuNO
---
6) There is almost never any competiton for the hill giants spot, and you will always be able to quickly swap to a world that is free if you do end up finding someone in the spot you want.
---
All in all, I think that it is a great place for an iron to train up their melee skills as well as train prayer (You can also bury the bones, but I found that to be quite annoying for not even that much of a boost. 
---
Let me know if you have any questions about it. Feel free to add me "IronNicka" - pls no hackerino
---
 
---
What darts are you using? I did 1.2k kills using rune darts--it won't eat into profits much. Darts definitely make a difference.
---
Jeez, hang in there!
---
They're p2p cause of that reason, people fall for it.
---
You talk like a frustrated child, my guy. Getting aggressive like that gets the conversation nowhere
---
I play solely on my ironman atm and have given up the normal play, so for me its no real issue but that ardy cloak change seems like it was intended to work that way from the beginning, not being able to use a teleportation in your inventory seems like a design flaw, but the bank and ge are separate, and always have been, i dont really see why a couple extra clicks matter it literally save you like no time and no real benefit other than to not being annoying, the ardy cloak on the other hand having to swap a piece of armour and change tabs seems much more inconvenient. 
---
ok thanks
---
Legit just straight up train your stats to 75 combat, it honestly only takes a few days at sand crabs, and if you complain about that taking to long I'm gonna give you the honest answer and tell you this game isn't for you.
---
Crabman btw

&gt;cases

If they keep at it they‚Äôll get it soon. I mean no disrespect. I died to Jad on my first attempt and I had very good gear with 88 range iirc

That's cuz the majority is risking just \~60k or so &amp; the majority of pk attempts on them won't be "good"; as in, the pk attempt won't have a chance to smite.  So it isn't really cost-effective to bring / risk a prayer potion.
---
That or the rev grinders are bad in general :) I just know for me I'll get away a majority of times cuz 85 agility + pod + magic log out button.

What about an account so old it doesn‚Äôt have an email for login? Am I at risk. I‚Äôd be devastated if I lost this shiz

How?

Any significant other that craves attention that much and needs to seek out attention for happiness in a relationship needs therapy. A healthy relationship includes alone time. I get home from work my wife knows to give me some love when I get home but after that it‚Äôs me time to unwind from my stressful job. (I‚Äôm a police officer) after I get done with playing a couple of hours we spend time together. It‚Äôs really easy to get caught up in ALWAYS trying to please your S.O. And not worrying about yourself and your happiness. If she controls him to the point where he has to stop playing a video game for a few hours then leave that shit or nip it in the butt before it gets too serious.

We need more player moderators who actually mute people doing this.

With the upcoming Hosidius rework, can Country Jig be shifted to the Tithe Farm and otherwise replaced with Forlorn Homestead or a new song? Going from any other region to Hosidius as it is now is practically aneurysm-inducing not only because of how repetitive Country Jig is, but how poorly it ties in with all nearby music.
---
Im my own person and so is my money. Sorry you're poor.

Lol tbh I did think of swampletics while doing this but I wanted to find some sort of narrows item sink as there are just too many pieces in the game...

Would you kill crabs there, powered by those super sets?
---
I agree with some points, but imo there is a big difference between unfinished content and content that has room for expansion. For example sea slug questline alongside many other questlines is just unfinished. But the ending of MM2 is both finished and could expand. (Since glough is defeated but not confirmed dead.)
---
I understand what you're trying to say, but I just wish they'd released it with at least the one quest that's kinda teased about through town.
---
If a vote is passing i dont vote no because i feel like its a waste of time if i couldnt see the poll result i would vote every time
---
Just gotta tank it bro. Bring high healing food and combo food (eg sharks and karambwans) and a stamina pot. Do your best to pray against whatever combat style they are attacking you with. Try to get a gap between you and the attacker and don't stop running.

Enough of the community wants it that it's derailing the entire Q&amp;A thread and has been top comment/close to it for almost two months, alongside showing up for long before that. It's clearly an important issue for a lot of people.
---
There are Hill giants that are a little more fun to fight they are level 28 and have drops that are worth collecting. Next up might be moss giants and there are a spot or two with lesser demons that can be fun. The early levels aren't that entertaining. I always recommend just killing cows and collecting hides until you have enough to sell and make good money (&gt;400) by this point you should be a higher combat and be able to do vampire hunter/ demon slayer

# THE WHAT
---
i would rather have a few uniformed individuals vote with the majority then a bunch of uniformed vote freely to the point that something passes that shouldnt pass.  Look at american polling, we have people like Alexaondria cortez sitting in congress when she is only qualified to run a bar.  That is what happens when uniformed individuals vote freely.
---
Any help to get my account back would be amazing

good thing its a 1.2b price difference.

OP couldn't even afford proper spelling. F
---
Okay so there's quite alot of stuff then! thanks for the info
---
Cap it's max hit like they did with ruby bolts, and make blowpipe slightly less accurate.
---
You only get a roll for the tangleroot when checking the health of a crop. If there‚Äôs not option to check the health, you‚Äôll get a roll when harvesting the final crop from the patch (Herbs, Seaweed.)
---
You don‚Äôt get a roll for every single action 
---
Why not just kill an iron dragon and fletch till you can make one

it was a bis bow for dungeoneering, but you could only use it in dung. people would pay 10m just for a chance to play with it.

He actually shows the name of the character on stream all the time.. Oh god I wish there was something to do, I am so pissed at that cunt

Optimally the useful rewards would be moved to other content.

I'm sure there's ways around it to make it accessible to pures.

how about bis helm and body for pures?

On the topic of ranged weapons.. What pvm scenario is armadyl crossbow bis? Usually it's outshined by blow pipe, twisted bow or DHCB.. 
---
dude did you lose your computer or something? literally all your posts are on mobile, how do you stay sane? I alreaedy get fucking furious if I have to drop an inventory of fish on mobile...
---
Always had to fight behind the wall between draynor and port sarim so people could watch without running under you and making it harder to cast spells.
---
True.  There are tons of weapons that can kill it as fast, or close to that fast.  D claws could spec out jad pretty easy.  Also blowpipe with max gear and dragon darts can cream jad.
---
8 hidden references I‚Äôve seen, am I missing any?

Yes, I'd assume and hope so. But they also said the same about Fossil island Boss. And after some time they just scrapped the idea.

Either my eyes are bad or my phones colors are messing up lmao my mistake
---
pvm has always been a joke
---
If you get max hits and he hits high on your veng you could 2 hit him even.
---
Yeah I lost it at the healers my first try. I feel like he was going soft on me because I got like 5 range shots in a row when the healers showed on the second attempt. Your heart starts pounding but you just gotta keep that flick ready lol
---
Eh at this point the best you can do is ignore the pathetic fucker... He'll always try to worm in some way or another. The less attention he gets the better he's already irrelevant as is
---
Lmao that moment when you think you‚Äôre intelligent for pointing out that I pointed out something obvious. 
---
Ok, I'll try to give you as detailed info as I can.
---
If you do not yet have a black mask get one. The price is well worth it. Imbue it through the Nightmare Zone minigame if you can. Make it into a slayer mask when you have the reward points and crafting level for it. This will greatly increase your accuracy and damage during tasks so you will complete them faster and use less ammo/food/potions. Regular mask/helm gives a 15% bonus to atk and str. Imbued gives 15% to range and magic as well.
---
Speaking of potions, use them. Range/super attk/super def potions are cheap enough to use them every task and be worth the extra speed of your kills.
---
At your combat stats you can use Cheledar, the fairy slayer master if you have completed the quest Lost City. Since you have high range you can probably get away with ranging most slayer enemies and use prayer for the ones you have to melee. You can flick prayer to save on prayer pots, though this is more click-intensive.
---
If you find that you are having difficulty with Cheledar's tasks go to Vannaka in the Edgeville dungeon and use him until you are a higher level.
---
At 55 slayer begin using broad bolts. They have the same bonus as addy bolts at half the cost. 
---
At 75+ combat use Konar (75 combat is the only req to use her). This is where the money is for slayer. Due to the drop rate of brittle keys and the chest table every kill is worth 1900 coins more on average when on task with Konar. Every brittle key is worth over 100k on average. Some chest drops suck and some are pretty great. The only downside is you must do the task at the location she assigns, meaning you may be forced into the Catacombs of Kourend where higher leveled than normal enemies are bunched together in a multi-combat area.
---
If you're in it for the money you can ignore Nieve/Steve and Duradel. Their tasks are not area specific, but they give fewer reward points per task and monsters do not drop brittle keys on their tasks.
---
also funny info, Rigour pre-eoc was 20% range damage, Rigour in OSRS is 23% range damage lmao.
---
Would you be willing to stream you making the plugin?

Newer ones are getting it on the back,  I try to give every one a punny name.  They make me laugh, and are mostly sold out.   See Hunter bottom right to see my newest one im officially releasing on Friday

You'd be surprised how useful it actually is. Some games even track your click pattern, and it would shock you how much of a pattern you use without knowing. 
---
The will fixit with a rollback
---
Well that‚Äôs fair. But to me the goal of the team at the moment was to fill in all black squares in the map. So when designing eastern Morytania they wanted to add a bit more than just raids 2 with no plan in mind. I would say in their defense. What I would like to see is Slepe be given a purpose and Darkmeyer become accesible along with Draken castle but we‚Äôll see. 
---
The OP just sounds like a baby. He‚Äôs obviously trolling
---
Literally just safespot it, then go for an attack every time his health bar disappears, and quickly click back to the safe spot. If you did it too quickly, you won't attack. Too slowly, he will hit you back. The timing is super easy when you know how to do it
---
Gz, not to be a dick but how do you have bcp and tassets and 9m total XP?
---
Currently running 8 RL clients while simultaneously rendering three 4K quality videos on my $25 pawn shop laptop, pentium processor and 10mb RAM

Good luck bro. Jagex customer service is top of the line so you should get a response any time now. 
---
Fuck ups or not, I think its *very* easy to see how people jump on board with the smack downs. If a doctor misdiagnoses a patient, Is he never to be trusted again? No, I don't think do, but I will be much more likely to go get a 2nd opinion. However im still going to be somewhat aware of that first diagnosis, because an expert who is looking at the data came to that conclusion.
---
However, not only are we on the internet, but also r/2007scape, its own little corner of autistic angry mobs. People will almost always over-intensify on subjects on the internet, and is notorious for finding a wrong-doer, and really letting them know the world is not with them. Its how its been on-line ever since the birth of social media. Its really not that surprising, as the way I took your statement is like your the only one with a clear mind around here. Its just not how reddit is. 
---
do you have a bank pin? 2fa on your account? 2fa on your email? An email that you use for only that account that is different from the login email? A unique password for your email and your account? If you answered no to any of those then there may be your answer.
---
A ridiculous price that fights inflation a little bit and will never ever be worth it or making cats grow automatically. There's a very slight difference between the 2
---
Torso for sure, it doesn't take as long as you think. Also Guthan's if you're gonna focus slayer and can't afford sgs
---
My bad lol, I didn't know what tag to use
---
You are not really at "money making" stats. Like you said slayer isn't good money until 70+.  Barrows honestly isn't great money until hard diaries. You could work towards that.  I would just focus on getting requirements for quests and diaries things like (varrock really pays off)and not worry too much about money.  
---
Farm runs and bird houses pay good money while being passive too.
---
I agree with most of it except hcim nothing skilled about playing cautiously until you die to a dc lol
---
runescape also has a problem with a playerbase that is perfectly comfortable with cheating their way through the game by buying gold, buying and sharing accounts and using 3rd party clients to achieve mundane thought processes. they invite it on themselves by making their account info public. if you don't share your info you can't get hacked, simple as that. 
---
Agreed.
---
lol im not a noob I have 1652 total
---
It‚Äôs not all that bad tbh, I finished the elite without getting poked more than a couple of times, just don‚Äôt risk much. It‚Äôs honestly worth all of the rc xp you get lmao, I‚Äôll gladly lose a few glories to get myself 75k rc xp
---
Very cute
---
lmao yeah true. 
---
Can you please add a mudskipper pet into the game at a rate of 1/10000 from mudskippers and also not tell anybody about it, so the first pet is discovered accidentally during RFD?
---
why?
---
Jagex will 100% ban you if you look like a bot. Doesn't matter if you actually bot or not, so long as you look like one. They have a lot of false bans and J-mods don't really care about false bans either. TBH they can ban you for anything and don't have to provide proof unless you go to court or something which most won't.
---
My old account was banned for a macro major(during the mod beno desk move when he banned a lot of players by accident) and it's easier to just restart than try to talk to the wall that is jagex's customer service.
---
Ye I wanted it all across every server and so that you could flex with it such as doing !pk in chat and showing ur kd

naw, I do it with ahrims bgloves and occult.

Yeah you're retarded

You gotta dig deeper

There are 2000 total worlds already though....

Do you have to get a smoke devil task? I‚Äôve been really close to 93 slayer for like 6 months but I‚Äôm a lazy bum lmao, if I don‚Äôt even need to get a task maybe I‚Äôll just do it

Bogla gold

Ok cool. Been looking for an efficient med clue setup. I always seem to forget something lol

you've got upper management written all over you. Your hired! and now your fired.

Thanks that gives me more hope, which phases are the ones you wait for? After jad/pre healers?
---
Seems this suggested a few times. This would be great. The existing one is so clunky.
---
So? You got blood runes.
---
Yesterday I got a chest with 761 gold and 4k in chaos runes.

But the blowpipe is really cheap?

Just got bp last week! Had seas before that because it's cheap to buy on GE. Thanks!

People have been asking to hide poll results since the last time it was polled and failed (polling such a thing was idiotic at best). And that was almost 2 years ago now. Are you implying that for 2 years they haven't collated enough data to measure the repercussions of hiding poll results?

Botters always state how much they no lifed and go too much into detail

Hmm. Interesting..

RuneScape really doesn't need a frame rate higher than 1fps if you think about it

Until 75 all the slayer masters are pretty garbage tbh. Just keep going. Being real until your slayer is higher non of the tasks are really going to give you a profit.

Chaos gauntlets. From the Family Crest quest. They boost the damage of bolt spells. Occult ammy is only 600k. Slayer helm (i) is a must have even if you're not maging.

Tbf, most non-gamers don‚Äôt understand the no tap zone when someone is gaming on a computer. My girlfriend will do this to me occasionally and I just look at her with this like death stare from hell and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to get me fucking killed‚Äù.

But yeah, like, please don‚Äôt tap my mouse arm or anything that works with my arm e.g. my shoulder, or patting my back, or better yet just don‚Äôt touch me until I give you my undivided attention.

Edit: Well thanks. There's confusion over the rollback. The rollback was to correct the more recent twisted bow bug, not the ruined pures bug. A handful people have now replied and said that accounts that were affected by the bug and posted in the official thread have not actually been corrected yet. So. If this is true, perhaps if someone is reading this... could you please take note of the account name and add it to your list, presuming you are going to do anything about it that is? Thanks.

---
Ah true.
---
Very interested how do i even go about installing other plugins
---
I am not certain, but I believe I saw an answer to this in a prior thread:
---
Currently if you disable the authenticator it happens immediately which means that all someone has to do is log in once and disable the authenticator to then have full control over the account. Adding a delay would be helpful because it would been that the person would have to continue to bypass the authenticator until it is fully engaged, allowing the original owner time to protect their account.
---
It‚Äôs like OP is trying to communicate something!

Why'd this get deleted?

Also, brodaki posted screenshots of the guy on "his" account chatting shit and saying he was going to drop his untradeables.
---
If you're some guy who just got their account back, why the fuck would you brag to the guy who stole/bought your account that you were going to drop their untradeables???? It doesnt make any sense whatsoever.
---
Jagex just wiping their hands and going "yup back with original owner now" really doesnt fill me with any confidence.
---
YES FUCK YOU REDDITBITCHES
---
My opinion: mobile is not intuitive, the controls are clunky, holding for right click is slow, movement is not responsive, buttons are too small, textbox is too big, the UI is inconsistent with different devices, ground items like seeds are impossible to see....
---
  
---
It's doable for ago things like cannonball but that's not fun. I don't think they should have released it in its current state because now these things wont be addressed.
---
Can say I fell for this when I was 8. 
---
I know they're never going to provide proof, but that doesn't mean you should automatically think they're infallible here.
---
It's like you people forget what company this is. Their most consistent trait is that they make mistakes. 
---
You just really can't critically think for yourself. You'll see a new highly up voted meme and take that as fact, because you're a lemming who can't think of an opinion for themselves.
---
That's basically my experience at 1,200 KC. We'll get 'em eventually. :')
---
i'm not sure what you mean, to my knowledge a death at cerberus means you need to go back to your death spot within an hour to get your unprotected tradeables back, vorkath is the one that has the safe chest
---
Technically, since Runelite and OSB has such a large marketshare of total clients; they can track what their players are voting and there is no way jagex can hide it. 
---
However Jagex could just tell them to not implement it, however I'd never imagine such a feature to get merged to runelite, I'd me more inclined to believe a hide poll results plugin to be implemented.
---
At the moment, someone can immediately remove the Authenticator once they recover your account.
---
Which basically means the Authenticator does nothing. A delay would mean someone would have to wait a week to get into an account if it‚Äôs compromised, and the person would be able to take actions to protect the account/lock it.
---
what is the blue stuff next to the pet?
---
Replied to the other guy with an explanation 
---
That's a fair point about maintenance cost. Especially now with amethyst arrows which are quite strong. The cost can be even lower for close to the same power as dragon arrows. I also mostly agree with what you said about only cerb and hydra mattering. Zulrah has BP but doing BP/Mage is far more expensive and less you have literal max gear minus tbow then it's actually faster to do that than tbow, but tbow has that low cost.  
---
I think it is to late to make any changes be it truly needed or not, but what I would like to see is it "moving up" on a tier list. People complain saying no 80 tier weapons/armor so they just add the same thing but give it lower requirements. Weapons such as tbow/scythe should require a higher level. At least to show they are "worlds" apart from other weaponry.
---
This is episode 1 of my one chunk at a time series. The goal of the series is to unlock the whole RuneScape map. Feedback is appreciated! Thanks to Pookaguy for having this idea and inspiring me to make this series.
---
Man you just draw random girls and loosely attribute them to Runescape characters 
---
And walk straight to the unemployment line!
---
Tbh i think jagex should just add tax to GE and then sell that to players, and undercutting gold sites. That would probably reduce some of the scummy things that happen thanks to black market sites.
---
The lengths to do what? Ruin their own account? Are we talking about the same people who can't be bothered to send prizes to winners of competitions they themselves held? Allowed Jed and RoT to roam free? Etc?
---
Ye failed was within last few months
---
Nice! 
---
Not compared to other weapons. It's only 5m right now. It does "degrade" in that ammo gets expensive though.
---
‚ÄúPls watch my hcim progress videos I need to pay the rent I promise I‚Äôll say things like B0aty does‚Äù

Is google down?

Quests get you 41 attack then buy rune sword from champions guild

I believe doing the quests with intent for him paying you in gp/$ could be bannable for rwt.

Many YouTubes dont own their account but use others for videos.

zombie (tarns lair), kalphite soldier, Kalphite guardian, militated bloodveld and insatiable mutated bloodvelds all drop them

Terms of Service and End User License Agreements are **VERY** far from legally binding considering how poorly some have held up in court cases.

the feud or safe spot kalphite soldiers

The more you look at this the better it gets
---
Will it blend?
---
Are you interested in just getting the 1 kc or learning to raid? Raids are really great end-game content and still fantastic gp/hr.
---
The hat you might be thinking of and can't find on the ge is probably the decorative magic hat from castle wars. Took me a while to figure it out myself. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Decorative_armour_(magic_hat)
---
Use the house planning tool in the game. For low levels focus on power building (build, remove, repeat)
---
If you‚Äôve got money to burn flatpacks might increase xp rates but are huge money sinks.
---
**PLAN AHEAD** (goes with the first tip) ‚Äî this skill is very expensive!! The rooms cost $1K minimum. If you can, build your portal chamber(s) close to each other.
---
If you want ideas, not saying my house is anything fantastic but you can take a look at either my RS3 house or my OSRS house. Username is 180054Giant. If you PM me on here I‚Äôll try and get online when I can and let you look around.
---
The biggest thing though is to have fun imo
---
What situations? Some raids 1 bosses, Sara GWD, Inferno are the only relevant ones and in all of these situations you STILL use a blowpipe. Whereas the blowpipe is OP in pretty much 80% of bossing and many non-boss NPCs. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
If you're willing to really put a lot of work into it recipe for disaster is an iconic quest that would be really cool if you put a spin on it. Or if you want something really easy do cooks assistant, which is basically the first quest anyone does
---
That sounds a lot better than doing green dragons tbh, I‚Äôve added you, thanks for the help :)
---
what thread
---
Thanks man 
---
Varlamore for sure, they have mentioned they want to complete zeah/prif before moving onto new areas.
---
link? 
---
why would they replace a fallen toaster with a cake?

With being able to get a week free membership because of mobile it was bound to happen. Plus you can keep creating new Amazon accounts for the free membership via Twitch Prime since Twitch let‚Äôs you demo prime before truly subscribing.

Record with OBS and edit with Blender. All free

I feel so bad for the people that fall for these, but it's an effective way to learn not to trust emails 
---
Whether they're actually right doesn't matter. Just think about it from jagex's perspective. There's no reason for them to waste more time on a specific case like the one you want proof for.
---
I think you mean Hanlon's razor.
---
Thx for the account kiddo

Brainlet OP pays 1m to run longer than he could for just 5k trading sticks lmfao

 [back to back smouldering stones](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a5p26e/a_back_to_back_smoldering_stone_drops/) if I had to guess, less than a one in a billion chance.

Shit argument brainlet

no melee

Ok but T-bow didnt break the game and meta.
---
Blowpipe did (and rigour in combination). 
---
Given its such an easily accessible and cheap weapon, yet incredibly powerful and more than worth the operating cost in the vast majority of cases makes it just game breaking. Plus its pretty much not only viable but the best DPS or very close in so many situations its just stupid, meanwhile the T-bow is only particularly OP against things with high magic defense. 
---
T-bow really isnt an issue, blowpipe is.

You can find a private server that is with a quick Google search :)
