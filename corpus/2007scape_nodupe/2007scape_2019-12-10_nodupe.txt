Thanks man. I'll look for 1% and up.

Honestly. Imagine working a job with the level of criticism jagex takes. Like a million karens all trying to return something at once.

No I‚Äôm not take it back

I imagine that this is being written by some 6'2" 190 lb powerhouse Greek god-esque chad
---
Agreed. I'm having a great time with Leagues especially, and I think the game as a whole is going very well. I always know the team does what they can whenever something goes wrong, and my expectations have yet to be disappointed.
---
Thanks! Next major goal is Dragon Slayer 2. Not sure what to expect. All I know is the last fight is difficult.
---
Yeah man that's not a good attitude. This was your fault. Nobody elses. Either accept responsibility and build yourself back up or forever wallow and play the victim like the scammer wanted.
---
Oh now it looks cool
---
RIP. My friend got permed on his main (9 years old, rs3 slave) after taking a week break soon after switching to osrs.
---

---
His rsn was his login so maybe he was hacked?
---
edit: Hijacked and botted on, maybe this could've happened to you?
---
Scrolled to the bottom.
---
Was not dissapointed.
---
What's the joke
---
Good luck!
---
Don't. Mouth turns black and it tastes like swampy sawdust, a friend told me.
---
The promo ends in a couple days or so, but it was still a full month bots/alts/gold famers got to abuse 2 weeks free p2p.
---
Better yet... when attacked, you die instantly and all valuables in your bank get transferred to he who hath conquered you
---
Dude it's easy. Everytime it turns blue run to the other side.
---
What are you on about no proof? Just search "Rendi Infernal Cape" and his scythe forum page is the first result, with confirmation comments from this year. And one of his closest associates(bea5 i think is the persons name?) Said that rendi helped discover this dupe because he thought he could use it to complete quests without claiming the exp and get the lowest possible barrow gloves. And then the golden gnome thing was a shit show all around holy fuck how can any public figure think its ok to act like that?
---
I'm sure there's something to do with crabs here somewhere
---
Wtf is this sub lol
---
Obviously you aren't magically going to be compensated for membership by posting on Reddit, and expecting otherwise is silly. No Jmod is going to read this post and think "yeah, go ahead and compensate this person just because they asked" lmao
---
You really want to know the answer to your question? Use the support site... it's literally what it exists for.
---
How long did it take you
---
It is but you‚Äôll overcome!

Gz on your first fire cape! I remember getting mine about a year ago, you‚Äôll slowly make progress and learn all the PvM mechanics. Good luck!!

But what if you could use them on the serp helm??

Thanks!!
---
I like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally convulsing‚Äù
---
So, let me get this straight. You got banned previously for macro, then had three completely unrelated accounts get banned, randomly and for no reason?
---
This is the biggest crock of bullshit I've heard in my life.
---
Let him project - its cathartic
---
As far as I know the zammy spear is literally only good on corp beast, the hasta is better everywhere else
---
Why not a weapon for kq
---
Oh fuck off
---
Can you seriously help me please lol
---
This isnt' real
---
This is a pretty bold post with no proof
---
It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm the friend, also his clan leader.
---
Oh I agree, I just assumed since he was replying with the same comment to the last guy he was doing it to mock him because the comment was dumb.
---
I did the exact same thing except you use the locator orb to kill your self after (on a pvp world) and just tele back from the bank. Instead of gear I took food as my extra items so that I could eat a few times and use the full inventory of bones. If less then 3 people where on me it made no difference at all. They have maybe 30 seconds if they‚Äôre waiting at the door for you, most of the time you end up still using the locator orb while getting pked because they just can‚Äôt kill you anywhere near that fast
---
And the account that died gets instant ban as well.
---
V nice!! 
---
I hit 70 earlier this week, I‚Äôm so close I can taste it lol. 
---
Same boat tho 72 agility, another small grind
---
i agree
---
Best way to train prayer honestly.
---
Only thing I'm worried about is a rollback
---
For a better tip 4 item with ely/bulwark, dhide top plus bottom and ds2 orb/enchanted symbol/enchanted key/rockcake. Deals more damage per tick.
---
Also unless ur a hcim, wildy activities are zero risk cept ma2 and even then the risk is tiny af. There is nothing to be scared of. Lose 100 d bones but save 15000 on your way? Stfu lmao
---
this is great
---
or learn to pk and kill people that have wealth ;)
---
Everybody is being so shitty about this, what happened to innocent until proven guilty? If OP wasn't convinced he was falsely banned he wouldn't have made the thread, get a grip some of you it's embarassing, impersonating a J-Mod just to try and fuck OP? WeirdChamp
---
Jagex just sucks as a business that cares about its customers, and I think people are tired of it. The mods/devs are great. The game and content is great. But the people leading the business just straight up suck
---
None of them were glitches, not sure what you are talking about.
---
Rates were either discontinued, or holiday items.
---
Phats came out of crackers which were spawned all over the place, the same as halloween masks, wants hats, easter eggs, and pumpkins.
---
Other items like disk or returning/ half jug of wine were tradable items that were discontinued with updates.
---
unless someone corrects me, I dont know of any rares that resulted from glitches.
---
(Its possible you are referring to the huge amounts of dupuing that happened in rsc, its why the pink phat want from the rarest/most expensive to the least expensive).
---
Are the beta worlds available for mobile? The only thing I remember like that is when they did the open world for a limited time a while ago
---
Looking at ‚Äúold posts‚Äù isn‚Äôt good pr in any context, they‚Äôre ignoring *active* questions from the player base.
---
You can buy a facemask from Konar.
---

But she isn‚Äôt one of the most known. Or at least imo. I‚Äôm working on more and she will again be left out.

---
Just buy gold if you care about the money so much. You can play the game just the same with less gold. You said you like what, 300M? That‚Äôs like $200. Not a lot of money if you have even an average job.
---
I understand supporting the company and all, but at the end of the day they are still getting everyone's $11 a month, we are all the ones that have to deal with this god awful drama.  
---
Imagine being a hardcore ironman right now, you are borderline locked out of 60% of the content in the game as it is so volitile atm, im all for letting them know that we are being patient, but when you dont make an announcement for 5 days than that's a fuck up on their end and they are obviously going to receive backlash.
---
20 pounds should get ya 3 and a half bonds. Honestly though your mate is better off buying 2 months membership instead of bonds. But if they don't wanna play two straight months then bonds are the way to go.
---
The real question should be why isn't a multi million dollar company not protected against it
---
I also saw that ocean depth site the guy made and thought the same thing. Thank you for this creation.
---
No problem, it definitely can get very confusing when theres multiple replies to the same post. I would try to describe it to you but I'm not sure how to say it. Basically the little lines on the left of the message go up by one when it's a reply but if they're on the same line then they're not a reply to each other they both are a reply to the same message. Not sure if that made any sense lmao
---
Damn, grats
---
Well I didn't only make money in those hours, quest cape, void, diaries, invested a lot of the money in skills etc.. Didn't just spin flax or smith cannonballs for 3k hours with 2qp and lvl 1 prayer, construction and herblore.
---
Reddit stalker? Little creepy over a comment over me p much saying fuck plugins but ok reddit police
---
They probably bought the account. You canceled 3 memberships over this? Dude it‚Äôs like $100 worth of osrs GP you lost... who cares?
---
ü¶Ä//
---
\&gt; So you think that just because someone hasn't been caught yet they are automatically innocent (not just presumed innocent)? You think Jagex has some kind of RWT investigation squad that goes on third party forums and tries to entrap RWT'ers? They have a tiny ass team as it is and it seems like a lot of them had been engaging in RWT themselves.  
---
I don't think anything.  I know that if you had conclusive evidence of RWT, you would send that evidence to Jagex and Jagex would have banned him.  The holdup with enforcing RWT is finding evidence.  If the evidence is found, banning someone takes no time whatsoever.  You're fake news.

Mining and smithing usually go hand in hand. 
---
Raising mining by going to motherload mine then after while use what ever you mine to do smithing.
---
That's not exactly what you're after, but this way you dont loose money.

Who cares

You posted on a public forum website. And I'm being serious.
---
If you‚Äôre finding a profit in your training method it‚Äôs not efficient.
---
Basicaly what I was doing from the begining. Sadly, I was looking for a more "especialization based" type of profession. It feels a little like you are forced to be a jack of al trades. Thanks for the advice, anyway.
---
Shittier quality too.
---
Tf is that?
---
That pic shows nothing. The dupe required a world to crash and abused the roll back to duplicate the money. No worlds are crashing right now. Instead people can‚Äôt log on or they can and the game is just running slow.
---
This scary
---
Protect melee in prayer gear in the catacombs with a bonecrusher. Each one killed restores 2 prayer points because of bone crusher. At 80 pray, my prayer points last the entire 10 minutes that they're aggressive. Then, because I'm a cheap fuck who won't spend on prayer potions, I reset aggro by teleing to my PoH, restore prayer at my pool, take portal back to catacombs, repeat. So it's about 30s of clicking every 10 minutes.
---
There's a shit-storm brewing Rand. We're about to go sailing into a shit typhoon.

Don't care how much it is in irl money, not gonna rwt it back. Talking about all the time lost. Even tho it's my fault, it sucks, and I Will just try to find another mmo

Which spirit tree is the best to plant first? Also is there a guide with the most efficient farm runs or do people just kind of screw around until they find a route that works for them

Maybe if I kill enough goblins this week I‚Äôll get 10gp to go to alkharid and try my luck there.
---
What does your girlfriend think of this accomplishment?
---
Just think, a day at your job and you could probably buy all the gp back. 300M costs like $100... but buy it and continue like nothing happened.
---
Man rs3 bond-only players got it rough. Because of mtx, bonds are 30m
---
Getting the recognition and praise he was desperately fishing for!
---
Thats how this game works
---
Raw materials are often cheaper than finished products because you get xp for turning raw materials into finished products
---
One other example;
---
Uncut gems have an examine text that says they would be more valuable cut
---
This is the case if you sell to NPC‚Äôs
---
But in reality uncut gems are more expensive on the GE because one of the best ways to train crafting is to just stand at a bank and cut hundreds of gems
---
Usually if you want to make a profit and buy materials off the GE, you need to do a slower experience gain method than most people do
---
The rendi hate train has no stops at logic station
---
Right but it's the same concept isn't it? Overloading the server with a ton of requests until it crashes?
---
Why the hell are bonds so expensive?
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs your fault for not keeping the monkfish as a pet
---
You realize its 1 max hit right. Even if were extremly generous and say the mager has to cast 1 less barrage on the clump, there is no way that outweighs potentially splashing and letting 2 crabs through
---
Humor is subjective, but I wasn't really referring to the image. Him and other people bashing people for requesting their memberships being extended because it's not 2010 any more is a bad argument. 
---
Standards for quality have risen since then. Just because Jagex isn't good at these things doesn't mean it's right for them to be bad at it.
---
Are you inferring you‚Äôre worried about being hacked by simply saying what boss KC you‚Äôre on?
---
Which do you think is more sensible for a company: Immediately promising things as soon as there's a problem or internally getting your ducks in a row before issuing a response?
---
defence just doesnt matter. The very few nieche places arcane was used will all later be switched with sirens tome
---
Thank you.
---
Would be cool to add as long as the hasta+defender wasn't made BiS and the bludgeon would still be the most efficient. 
---
Completely in favor of making the keris useful for irons or lower levels who wanna do kq but aren't quite the level for top tier gear.
---
That's gotta be a no from me dawg
---
I thought grinding the house rep would be accelerated... I don't have it in me atm do max them all again.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that coincidentally when fewer people knew about a glitch that could make someone 10s of thousands of dollars IRL, there were fewer servers being taken down? And then when a popular YouTuber essentially posts a guide on how to perform said glitch and gets 100s of thousands of views, a larger amount of servers are affected?
---
Yea jagex has updated their post on the website saying they've added a cold fix.
---
The magic Mush tree reminds me of a Thomas the tank engine meme. I love him.

you cant change it after it comes into the game

Is it worth it to switch to sulliuscep from cutting teaks I planted on fossil Island from 79-90 (or 87 since dragon axe boost)? I just got a master clue with a sherlock step to cut a redwood in the lumberjack outfit. The outfit is easy but I have 6+ and woodcutting is not the most engaging of content besides the occasional clue nest
---
Wuu2 for the rest of the league? More tasks? CoX?
---
I don't completely agree with OP, but there examples aside from just Husky's latest tweet.
---
The most obvious update was the sand update, which is basically ironmen only content. There was also the corp instance update. I'm sure there are other very obvious ironman only content, but these are the two that I can think of off the top of my head. I'm not saying this content is bad, just wanted to point out that it does exist.
---
Everything has been way smoother for me today after the coldfix they did that required server reboots. Mobile loaded right away when I tried it earlier
---
It‚Äôs too bad the arcane is just a stat value item (mediocre at best for the price) compared to ely and spectral which both have unique effects. Without some niche use like spectral for cerb, the arcane was just waiting for something to overtake it as BiS mage offhand.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm saying that linking the fact that the mobile client literally did not connect for about a week people attempting to repeat a dupe glitch without evidence is magical thinking.
---
\&gt; And then when a popular YouTuber essentially posts a guide on how to perform said glitch and gets 100s of thousands of views 
---
The glitch that no longer works and has no relation to whatever is happening now?  As evidenced by the fact that for this entire week we've seen no evidence of hundreds of accounts just chilling in random clan wars worlds?  And by the fact that **no one** even suggested that these two events are connected until Jagex offhandedly said "DDOS" today?  When the original dupe glitch happened, people were on reddit hours later already trying to talk about it - it's why the automod started auto-removing mention of it.  This has been going for a week and no one's suggested that's what it is.  If that's not evidence that this isn't connected, idk what is lol.  Not that the burden of proof is on me.
---
Yes Sulliusceps are quite a bit faster than teaks of you are not tick manipulating
---
I think he knew what he was saying. A day of membership, based on a 30 day month, costs $0.36. People are at arms because they couldn't play a game for a day and are insisting on getting their 36 cents back. It's sad, and sort of childish. Especially considering Jagex has allowances written into their contracts for this sort of thing. You can't agree to be OK with something and then get mad when it happens.
---
Not broken OSRS: now?
---
sup lol
---
Isnt a (still) overly powerful set of armour good enough motivation to do it?
---
My account was stolen by a hacker once and I had forgotten my email login so I tried to get it back thru jagex, and they claimed it wasnt my account and that it was the hackers account. The account was under an email that had my first and last name, it had used my debit card, my authenticator was linked to my phone, etc. I had provided a mountain of evidence, yet the support seemed to decide the account wasnt mine. Luckily a few weeks later I found out i could recover my email with my phone number, but it was just stupid.
---
This was a year or two ago and it makes me wonder if a jmod hacked me or something when all that was going on. I quit the game soon after so it does not matter anymore.
---
When all of the players now in their mid twenties reach mid 30s with children etc. Not enough zoomers will pick the game up and they will ad mtx which will spell the end.
---
Uhhhhh go fuck yourself
---
He looks like he could eat my claws and cannon
---
Yooo that's a huge update for me. My two biggest gripes with rs3 is the bank and the weird movement lag. Sounds like the took care of one of those things.

I'm sorry mole

Going to try to do the clues I collected and maybe afk some skills for more points. 
---
Interestingly enough I played 16-18 hours a day and still only have 8 staminas from dr jekyl, I want to finish my pool before doing any clues.
---
I suppose technically the bot farm is a ddos as well, I was just stuck in thinking of it from a network perspective. I was also assuming that the issue right now was with the network and not actual servers crashing, since it seems like when servers crash people are locked on that server for a few hours until it's rebooted. I haven't been reading the subreddit too much so idk what's actually happening.
---
Idk but if rshd was polled I think it would have a good chance to pass and would make the game more interesting for a lot of people.

Adderall or Ritalin is my thought

Thanks for the reply and the links i really appreciate it. (especially since ban appeal stuff is extremely hard to find)

also it took way longer for first hardcore to max, this gamemode has fking 5 to 20x higher xp rates based on relics you choose
---
NGL you could have just said "pwease pwease pwease just say you're wrong pwease", saved my time.  Answer'd still be no though, sorry chief.
---
If there were proof that Rendi is currently RWTing, he would be banned.  If he isn't banned, there isn't proof.  IDK what "caught wind of" means in this modern world where you can literally send Jagex a PM with any proof you want.
---
\&gt; you KNOW somewhere deep down what this tweet means. 
---
How about you worry about what you know.  A guy said that he was selling shit now.  I said there's no proof of that.  He showed me a tweet of him saying he did it a year ago.  Go do your algebra homework, Lao Tzu.
---
Me playing TL and not having any issues at all.
---
Just a little other 3 weeks. A casual person with a little research can get 1k points the first day or two, and easily 6k by the end of the 2 months. I play casually and I just hit 10k. From your comments, I'm thinking you know very little about TL. 
---
Weird.
---
Bro my alt often carries large amounts of wealth in gear, if it was locked either way, my main and alt would essentially be disabled, in which I wouldn't play. 
---
A better solution would be 24 hours of down time for them to fix the problem.
---
Viagra

Lol how would she click on the tiny little items? She's smarter than you!!!
---
I agree with your point, I feel bad for the people working on it, but I still don't think it's a full pass. If a critical system I worked on was down, not only would I be pouring myself 100% into fixing that, my company would be pouring every resource they could into it.

Don't recommend playing rn until servers are stable, aside from that Dragon Slayer 2 made Vorkath like a 2-3m per hour boss and Song of the Elves Zalcano that is pretty much the same amount of money per hour

No.... I really wanted 6000 points for the slayer helm recolor.
---
A single 99 skill gives you 250 points....

Maxing (23 skills \* 250 points = 5750points..... which is not even enough.

I know there are many other points you can earn but this is a rough estimate.

Sad reality is, you really cannot "stop" a DDoS attack. All you can do is kill connections to offending IPs and wait for the trolls to get tired and go away. All a DDoS attack does is take legit traffic and do a lot of it. Not like malware you can just delete and fix the damage of. This is a human issue and some people being cunts.

Welp. If you are a troll, have a nice day, just trying to inform somebody. If not, then I think you are very confused and not understanding. Either you are confused and don't know how many points your streamers have, or you are watching some streamer that is playing a bunch, but is just not doing tasks for some strange reason. I hope you come to understand your misunderstanding and give the league a shot.

I found rune crossbow easier than blowpipe during the final fight because of the extra range (and being significantly cheaper is nice), but it does make the whole thing take a lot longer.

Idk? What's wring with me?
---
Just start at 40 40 atk str. And get whatever range level matches that for the cb lvl youll be. It will depend on hp exp. Then you just pk range xp and catch up the str xp every couple levels. If you wabt lower hp you can quest in p2p for mele xp and cannon your range. Goodluck, ive f2p pked for many years so any questions hmu.

Can Barbarian Assualt High-level gambles be added to the hiscores?  They're currently tracked in-game on the PoH Adventure Log.
---
At least he‚Äôll get plenty of rewards for his main and be set up for the next league.
---
Couldn‚Äôt the people he owes to dox him and do some really shitty things?
---
A result of some r34 art if I had to guess.
---
Wow less than a month in, impressive.
---
Do anglerfish now
---
imagine thinking someone is going to come after you irl over rs loans, he can just log out lmao
---
no one with the capability to get their money back from him is also dumb enough to loan him billions to stake while he profits from views/subs/donations lmao
---
Finally a meme built for my 460 x 5552 gaming monitor
---
Yeah exactly. At my first job they literally fired our only QA because they said the developers could just do it. It sucked.
---
I guess. I just want to lms bots back so some legit players turn up for it. Legit not a soul nor bot has been there in a week on any world. I even DMd one of the bot farm owners on here begging for him to start it again.. he said it just isnt worth it anymore :( 24hr req on rewards and bots get banned before 24hrs. This means lms is actually dead content and cant be played.

Adwaam changed his name to troll people it‚Äôs not the teal cape seller

A union? Lol this is America in a "right to work" state. They aren't required to pay overtime at all

What keyboards do they own? I just went on Amazon and aside from the literal 5 dollar keyboards that come with oem pcs I could barely find any that didn't have them, even 30-40 dollar Logitechs, etc have them
---
West side cause I live on the west coast and east is kinda stinky
---
I see it more as keeping arcane relevant rather than becoming instantly obsolete. By attaching it to a low tier, botted item used as a stepping stone for a lot of players would make arcane irrelevant very fast. MTA would become a bigger botfarm than it already is, and arcane would become trash tier to a lot of players and instantly lose value. An attachment to arcane instead would keep it stable and naturally go down over time to balance out other while keeping a more natural gear progression for players. Book of darkness &gt; malediction ward &gt; mages book &gt; arcane. (Not sure on stat differences for ward + book)

Same on 366 or 373, don't get why everyone's acting as if the game is unplayable

Your inventory bothers me way more than it should.

You need to be careful showing your creation date and account name. It's a known method to recover an account.

I myself have an older Tt eSports (Thermaltake) keyboard. But i purposefully went for a bare bones Cherry Black keyboard. Was around $110 AUD like 5 years ago or so.
---
Brother has Corsair Strafe, which doesn't have dedicated macro keys but does come with software that binds macro's. So i guess if we go to that point i'm sure most of the main brands these days do "come with" macros, in that they suggest installing their software that achieves that.
---
Maybe thats where our disagreement / confusion stems from. I was thinking you were talking physical Macro Keys (like M1-M5 etc).
---
Logitech has been known for them being present for over a decade, so it wouldn't surprise me if they're hyper common in that brand.

I mean Jad was one of the best tasks in the game pre catacombs. Even nowadays its like.. 50-70k xp/hr at Jad i believe? A confident Zuk killer would easily top that i imagine, so i assume it is EHP to do until Pet drop for both.

No it isnt

---
LOL WTF
---
So what about the people that started playing when mobile came and only play on mobile?
---
How should afk mindless skills make "good gp"? It's not the bots. It's the fact why mine ore then smelt it when you can pvm and obtain the final pieces way easier... Most skills aren't meant to be a 2m/hr skill. Everything in that sense was crashed by pvm drop tables and alch prices.
---
Even if let's say mining became a 2m/hr skill then pvm would just because a 4m/hr skill for generic monsters that drop products you'd get from mining.
---
I saw you like an hour ago, at the Motherlode mine!

How about anglerfish? Which lives deeper ?

This is whats called cross site scripting (xss). It's when people embed javascript into the URL of websites in order to collect information from you. You can tell by the odd URL endings with things like "changekey" and "changekeycancel". By injecting this info into the URL attackers are able to collect your data from websites without actually linking you to an incorrect loading page. Avoid it at all cost and always use the OSRS homepage for info like this.
---
You do you, but acting like not paying chump change every month is some sort of 200 IQ lifehack gets pretty old pretty quick.
---
Reason why mobile wasn‚Äôt connecting was DDOS attacks. Who just made public an exploit having to do with DDOSing?
---
Why‚Äôd you go and attack me like that?
---
Garbage fire again

I updated my email and password in the account tab as the article suggests, but I still cannot log in using that information. That's actually why I made the post because I just couldn't figure it out.

I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, that‚Äôs a reasonable thing to ask for. They even promised to with the update they made.

my iron is just about the same! im 20 totals off max on my main, started my iron a year ago and its 1893. i find myself playing my iron more even when im so close to max lol
---
A public exploit that shut down 2 f2p worlds for an hour is now causing mobile clients from failing to connect to anything?  Even before servers?
---
Again, as the guy said - lotta people here talking out their ass that know nothing about how servers work.
---
Tim Allen biker boy*

I have already done, my authentificator always on i changed my password minutes after this message appears
---
Only 4 votes?
---
Why, what does that change? You can't change your login username (in this case email used to create the account) and they don't know his password, hence trying to brute force it.
---
can't wait the day when one of the jagex goons at the awards gotta say his name out loud when Jesus gets his pmod status

No idea to change it. They only know your login username. They're trying to brute force your password or something like that

Thank you!

Just happy to hear the servers are finally fix. Look forward to scaping  with you lovely people again!
---
Guy I was responding to: "he sells infernal capes"
---
My response: "yeah there's no proof he does that rn"
---
To this point, you've replied with a past tweet... saying he did it in the past... but doesn't do it now...
---
Did you mainly want to talk to me about the weather then?
---
\&gt; I'm **not** saying that I believe Rendi was working with them, etc. Just that I disagree with your logic about it first being in f2p, meaning that they **would never** try to do it in p2p later. I think anyone trying to crash f2p or p2p servers would start attempting it in f2p, that's like a cheaper dev server for botters. Basically, the fact the dupe attempts were first on f2p doesn't mean much either way. 
---
Even with the prime exploit, you're free to do the math on how much 2000 p2p accounts would cost.
---
No it's Elyse from the funhaus drunk stream they did a few months back for 24 hours.

Lol I meant 72 mage. My bad

Gonna tell my kids about the great osrs lag of 2019.

Might be a dumb questions but, are you really not able to play on a PC at all? Like not at any point during your day?

If you may of entered in the wrong password then that would trigger that message but to be safe I would change my registered email address after scanning your pc with malware bytes or hitman pro make sure to only get the trial version from the vendors sites

Wow üò≤

Which Amazon pays for ?  lol ?
---
It sounds like this buck tooth nicholas cage clown has a problem with His savage methods
---
i almost always play hearthstone and osrs at the same time, it goes so well together since hearthstone has turns in which you can half focus and osrs many skilling methods or combat half focused.
---
He is the special
---
If you took me on this kind of date you could bang me 100%
---
But how would that stop certain people logging in from certain connections
---
I literally reported you myself your acc Sandkreb was apart of a whole Zulrah bot farm.

Dont waste your time memorizing this toilet seat chart and just hire pink clay to kill zulrah for you.

Don't know why my text didn't post. Got back to back, died on last hit of next kill. Lost tanz fang...

---
Idk why you were downvoted.. you literally answered the question correctly lol. People have with access to botnets can control thousands to hundreds of thousands of zombie computers and request to login over and over to overload their server. When a server cannot keep up everything gets delayed (in game) and for logging in cannot be validated because it's too busy trying to handle the massive traffic.
---
There is literally no way to be immune to DDoS attacks. This is why huge companies like Blizzard and Riot still get DDosed from time to time.

no, actually. there will be another league tho.

I'm sorry, I wouldn't KNOW. I hope it works again soon man

Damn did you hit an 80, be careful man you might smite someone by accident
---
I personally think $11 per month is too much, if I play for a year it‚Äôll cost $132. You could buy so many great games for that much money and I don‚Äôt think RuneScape is really a $100+ game. But thankfully there are bonds which can be bought in-game which I am happy to use and if I want to support the developers I will happily buy merch on their store.
---
But after saying all that I think the ‚Äúreee $11‚Äù is just a meme at this point.
---
Thank your for the epic journey our Savage Leader.

What happened? I lost power and now have finals.

In the words of 25 Buttholes: wow
---
Was disappointed like 15 years ago. I know what to expect. I think ffx has the best rpg battle style of any rpg, but ill be playing x2 purely because i want to know more about spira.
---
Lol.
---
I see. Where could I go to buy kills? I'm two months new to osrs and have made zero connections haha.
---
this is something lmfao
---
Google statistics and start doing some research
---
Amazing!!! Please do more
---
You would stand in edge and get a target in lvl 1 wild. You would walk in safe zone as he approches and ask to buy the kill off them. Some people will scam you, others will troll but some people will help you.
---
I used one thats way better than this, shows the thing you have to pray every phase, which is great for learning
---
He didn't cause this imho. It was bound to happen because the product is broken. People already knew and it was going to get leaked either way.

Hell yeah bro! I‚Äôm untrimmed agility so unfortunately can‚Äôt untrim it, but I‚Äôm still excited!

If you have.. change your registered email address.
---
sir bruh dude
---
It wouldnt though. A brute force would take the same amount of tries and no one would guess catfishdog anyway.
---
fming maples is never worth doing, other than 45 to 50, since fm todt is more xp/hr
---
redwood logs are worth (for some people) fming since its more xp/hr than todt
---
making maple bows is like 90k gp/hr, which even for bots isnt worth doing, so almost no maple logs are consumed
---
Just play more efficiently then.
---
Literally me with Diablo II, ladder just reset last friday.

They still give us runescape after all these years. Cant be that bad

Shhhh. I‚Äôm up tonight. Took a scaping break and I‚Äôm downstairs. Lol

I duno. Maybe 100k. I havnt done it personally.

That‚Äôs the page that wasn‚Äôt working for me originally because it was all automated and they didn‚Äôt look at my weird dual account thing:

They are rare though, 3a pickaxe for example is more rare than any partyhat in rs3.

Quality shitpost. 10/10
---
Untrimmed Agl, I tip my hat to you sir  Respect is earnt.

Only just

I completely get that, the OP is just putting himself on a pedestal to condescendingly talk down to everyone else

Just watch evscape

At least my man has barrow gloves

What the hell is up with farming contracts? Ive planted and harvested 2 separate snapdragon patches and not gotten a "task completed" message either time. 
---
And yes, I confirmed that snapdragons were my active contract so is there something im missing or are they bugged?
---
True.
---
The ol blast furnace been burning too much coal.
---
Yeeeeet
---
idk man, there's no way the gold-buying sites weren't aware of it after rendi's video and a lot of them probably new beforehand. no way are they going to buy the massive amounts of gold that was supposedly going to get duped, let alone buy it all at market price. 
---
best case scenario for the dupers would be managing to offload some of it for essentially pennies on the dollar before their hundreds of bots get permed and all the leftover gold gets deleted
---
Nope i have not, could it be an ip address problem?
---
125b is more like 40k since you can never get a good price for such large amounts
---
Gambling is bad, but really whats the difference vetween risking bank in wild and staking your bank?
---
do you have a source on that or is it just conjecture
---
Some people expect everyone to care about everyone else's problems. Snowflakes.
---
never ever
---
That‚Äôs it?
---
thats not very bodacious of you to say
---
You mean like any other job. Enjoy your innocence now, you wont always live in that world.
---
Other way around, monkfish doesn't refer to any one fish and one or two of the fishes that can be referred to as a monkfish is an anglerfish just fyi
---
"Ironman cc" loves imp calls :)
---
Ah I havent done birdhouses for months once i hit 70 lol. Those were a little more tedious (even tho they really dont take much time) but i forgot the amulet.
---
No because jagex follows normal business hours mostly that's why you get more bots on the weekend
---
This is the most uneducated take I‚Äôve ever heard on the Venezuelan crisis.
---
A big part of Ironman for me (started as hardcore) was the fact that I had to do so many separate tasks to achieve a bigger one. 
---
Staying away from long tedious grinds and splitting up the necessary ones with farm runs, quests, buckets of sand etcetc kept me addicted.
---
If you really find yourself struggling just set a quest goal. I did DS2 and that made me switch between all kinds of activities,
---
you can quit anytime
---
The glory dated back before the duel arena existed. Back then you could duel people anywhere you liked... Al kharid was basically just a quest hub + tanning and smelting, basically just as dead as it is now
---
Not me? Sounds about right.
---
its almost like they never made rs3 or ever make new content ever
---
this idea is outdated and stupid
---
Yeah but it shouldn't take more than a day or two to flag all the Ips in the botnet and block their requests.
---
Of course depending on the attacker, they could keep using more resources and keep this up for literally months.
---
You can get multiple at a time now.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
Yeah it's probably slightly closer for many things but I've become so accustomed to using dueling
---
Get in the trap bitch
---
Anyone that has 200m in all skills should have their accounts banned, and Jagex should tell their parents that their son is a loser
---
Forgot fishing
---
SoV will never fall below it's alch value of 2.4m that is insane to even mention.
---
Some have yes
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
You‚Äôre the loser for judging other people
---
Good idea. My original goal was to max mining at MLM, then get various skills up to 50 for Wintertodt and go max FM. Maybe I should take a break and try getting those Wintertodt skills up to break the monotony.
---
Wut
---
Shouldnt the same be said for every other log(except maybe redwoods)?
---
In that case he can grind EVoid and do Vorkath since it's BiS there and Vorkath is top 3 money makers
---
Facts though, i coulda done this with my fists on a level 38
---
Don‚Äôt have an Ironman but I could tell you that if I was feeling burnt out from rs one of the things I definitely wouldn‚Äôt do would be a disgustingly long mining grind.
---
It sickens me that people like you are allowed to vote in polls
---
Its really hard for me to follow global politics, so I can't really comment on that. I know their government has royally fucked them but honestly I just want them out of my game. I don't like when my virtual items are worth less because a group of people mass farms them for fiat money.
---
Make your own puzzle tile box?
---
I could make that by selling my pee to anime fans
---
Just gimme mems days back for this shit. It won‚Äôt happen
---
...
---
Probably grind out a shit load of black chins
---
&gt; We load test and improved until the infrastructure can handle many times more load than peak usage would require.
---
Did you just imply jagex doesnt load test? That's ridiculous. And no amount of it will help with a big enough ddos. The only reason servers probably stayed up at all, unlike previous osrs server ddosing shows the upgrades we've had and that whatever load balancer jagex have was doing its job.
---
American here, what's a meter?

Which are the most fun enemies to grind for rare drops?  My combat level is now 42.  Been grinding hill giants and minotaurs.  Need a change of scenery!
---
He's been playing 16-18 hours a day for a month. That's not super casual
---
Im pretty sure scythe is close to its anchor price. I was checking out some analysis and after taking the average loot from all uniques and the cost of use into account, if it fell too far below 500m it wouldn't be worth it to use at tob. 
---
Basically leading to "the scythe is expensive because its expensive". When you release an item that drops from the same content its almost solely used for it's in kind of a weird spot. People would stop doing tob since so much of the chest value comes from scythe, eventually leading to a decrease in supply of scythes, rising prices and making tob worth doing with scythe again. 
---
Pretty much the only way scythe can fall far below 500m is if there are significant price increases in rapier/sang.
---
I concur

Im actually interesting in doing something like this with node, i know theres an api out there but not sure what the official is

Nice.
---
I like west side just because I naturally tend to go there.
---
I ended up switching to east side though eventually because I realized that if you click on the brazier from where you cut logs, it paths you into the corner spot of the brazier where snow rarely falls. West side on the other hand it puts you in a spot where snow falls, so to compensate I have to click on the corner spot of where the brazier meets the wall in order to do what East side already does in 1 click.
---
Although I still gravitate to west side.
---
33 u?
---
clearly are shit servers if they can be brought down by an attack lol
---
But why max account?
---
dude get off your high horse. we ain't getting shit from jagex. if 11$ is a high percentage of your monthly salary, you shouldnt be playing runescape. shit happens. don't expect jagex to pay for something that could happen to any game at any time.

This is pretty accurate to my own playstyle but without my parents taking away anything. I'm 27. Also am a nightowl so different times.

fair fair, not 100% sure either

Well, this is a rather boring resolution, however, perhaps the best for all.

Really? I did 150games (it‚Äôs not alot) but I didn‚Äôt get lucky üò£
---
Ok.
---
I don't really have much experience in raids just beyond gearing up with a few friends and going and (trying not to) die to olm, what's differentiates efficient raids from like, trying to do them as fast as possible while not dying?
---
Multiply that $1.47 by the amount of people affected, and you get a significant sum of money

I‚Äôm so sorry about this man, awesome flex item for the league though, drop it in crowded places just to fuck to people
---
No offence taken, it wasn't my analysis I was just reading something someone else did. But what you said makes more sense. I honestly think the scythe is overvalued either way right now for the rate at which they enter the game. Its fun to use but I cant afford to fully charge it so I feel the gp draining on every xp drop lol. 
---
Also touching on that last paragraph I'm sure some of the scythes value comes directly from PvMers deeming it's worth more than X00m. If the majority of scythe owners decide to never sell for less than 500 most of them coming into the game would be from splits, providing much less downward pressure on prices.
---
Buying membership. Oops, I dun need rune armor anymore
---
Yep. take a look at a lot of the top rated posted and comments the past few days.
---
this isn‚Äôt a fucking smackdown
---
Problem is, you need semi-good stats to start making bond levels of money in a reasonable amount of playtime (Say 2h a day.) without playing the market.
---
Because most people thought it would stop their blatant cheating, instead it's helping them by giving even softer decisions.
---
Prayer relic good for 6k pt goal. Next leagues I‚Äôll get run though. After base 60s it gets a bit more difficult and I‚Äôd rather have run to do shit like library and clues.
---
I stand by the relics I picked for my purpose: prayer, selection, artisan, dinhs, 2x
---
Didn‚Äôt even need to go for 100m firemaking, but afk todt was really nice. 100m easily doable, 200m would be a 17 hour grind from there

Uhh, yeah I totally would lmao I'm sure there have been times where Netflix had connective issues for a few days. Things don't work 100% perfectly all the time, that's life learn to deal with it

What will it take for an IP ban? Likely nothing because the people at the top just see bond purchases.

The other issue with rates would be knowing an item was going to be discontinued before it happens. It wouldnt ever have the same effect as RS2 because a lot of people didnt know going forward that the items would be discontinued. That caused a lot of people to lose or remove a statless cosmetic item reducing the amount in the game. If the holiday events were like that now, people would just stack as many as possible and none wouldnt be as "rare".

If you intend to keep your account private, share the least information as possible.

. Blatant penalty not given for Everton,

Alexander Arnold not getting a second yellow for stamping, 2 minutes after an Everton player had been booked for the same tackle.

Last minute penalty never should have been given against Leicester,

Blatant penalty not given against Man City leading to Liverpool actually scoring. 
---
Goal ruled out for nothing against Palace.

Their definatly more I can't think of right now. Most teams have had some in favour and some against. Liverpool have had nothing to against them

wow you got them, i bet they stopped because they saw this reddit post

I see him all the time hes on 340 never responds to my questions about gear. Dont think it's a bot cause he dies rarely probably a gold seller?

How is the response BS? It's literally industry standard: Get your internal teams to align on what the problem is (malicious attacks on the servers) then issue a statement explaining why the servers are down. They also kept that article updated as events unfolded.

This post is NOT about making arcane better than siren's tome. On contrary, tome would still be the BIS item in most cases after these changes. It's just a fact that arcane is a bad shield, barely any better than mage's book/ancient wyvern shield. You'd expect a corp shield to be a noticeable improvement over a 3m item from mage training area.  
---
This proposal makes arcane a decent improvement over the next best items, so people that can't afford siren's tome are more willing to upgrade to arcane, keeping it at decent value. It'd also keep arcane relevant in specific cases for people with both arcane and tome, which is a good thing because both items come from a group boss.  
---
And no, your examples are terrible.  
---
Bandos is higher level content than barrows, torag must not get a buff. It's actually already at higher melee defence stats than bandos.  
---
Whip should not be buffed because rapier is better: whip comes from a slayer monster while rapier comes from end-game PVM content. Same reasoning for trident vs sang staff.
---
I wish al kharid / lumbridge would get some new content. I love the scenery and nostalgia but have no reason to be there.

If you can afford it, switch to members my man, the game becomes 100x more enjoyable as a member. Totally worth it.

Is it the players' fault for not being able to play on stable servers or is it the responsibility of the company?
---
Honestly I think if the characters weren‚Äôt gone in two months I would‚Äôve stuck it out more on TL. But as it stands considering the rewards (bar trophy) are tradeable I just couldn‚Äôt give myself enough motivation to carry on past 2k points when I know it‚Äôs mostly wasted time I could be putting into my main. Love the concept and it‚Äôs definitely fun, it just seems a bit too... pointless? Just my opinion and I‚Äôm open for discussion!

Pretty common for van lifers. I'm no authority on buses but I've looked into doing it before, I'm pretty sure you'll want a diesel one with the weird half-manual transmission (shift first to second then the other gears are automatic), the other kinds are nightmares at high mileages.

yes its a scam, but also delete this bc you just showed your email

Most likely scam. Look at the email address of the sender.

this subreddit was creaming over him two weeks ago but now that everyone‚Äôs calmed down because the servers are ‚Äúfixed‚Äù they‚Äôre attempting to seem more logical when in fact it‚Äôs the exact opposite. It doesn‚Äôt matter what time of year it is. Jagex is notoriously awful with customer service. Giving an update 5 days after the fact makes absolute zero sense lol

say that to the 4 dragonfruit tree seeds i opened yesterday from 1key (800k+)

Guess it is a scam. But you can visit the website by searching osrs on Google and change check which email you are using for the account

They made redwoods into a thing irlüòØ

I know you said you blame yourself, but clearly you don't as you are asking for a company to hold your hand through every social interaction you have. Maybe if you would explain how you got scammed people would have more sympathy because right now it seems like you just traded some random dude your bank in good faith and want someone else to fix your naivety.

After level 50, there are lower level tasks that disappear and are replaced with higher tiered ones.

If they react to certain gear, that means you'll easily be able to attack them by not equipping the gear until after you've already started attacking them.

And yet you still replied. Sad, especially considering no point has been proven. You've said nothing in regards to why someone cant modify a publically available image to make it unique and then upload it. You've yet to give any reason as to why I or anyone should care that they traced an image.

I miss these so bad, I know bots got 'smarter' but they at least disrupted them and kept players on their toes.
---
The game shouldn't be so AFK imo.
---
this is going to sound facetious but there's a moneymaking guide called work part time at taco bell that's over 8m/hr if you buy bonds with the profits. it's probably the most efficient thing you can do for profit at your stats.
---
(translation: just buy membership because bonds aren't 3m anymore and you're better off keeping any 6m you have to buy a fury, berserker ring and other things like that which will help you)
---
I already stopped playing months ago, I'm just here for the drama now.
---
How many times did it result in a comeback chief

Good luck lmao. My preoc main was hacked and botted on EoC in 2015 or 2016 and is still permed unappealable even though I've never played eoc
---
Zezima bit me once, now I can't stop eating grass.
---
Honestly, you just gotta grind it out. That is sorta how OSRS works a lot of the time. Sometimes things are good XP per hour but often times lower profit per hour or the other way where you get lower XP rates but better profits. 
---
There are exceptions but there are usually reasons that they are exceptions, harder content, tougher requirements. 
---
If you really want to buy your membership with gp. You might have to make that decision. 
---
Also it‚Äôs hard to figure out what money making methods will work for you since I have no idea what stats you have besides combats.
---
They still can.
---
OSRS can be a free game.  There's recreation - they can pay for bonds via OSRS gp.  And "but that takes forever and isn't reasonable" isn't a valid answer. 
---
Mobile users - like I said before, they are paying for the PC service too (not ideal answer, but still reasonable).  
---
Kids - don't really want to discuss because kids have different parents (some parents may have tons of money and say no, others may have parents with little money and say yes to a membership)
---
I agree, 5 days would be great for free, but I understand that it probably won't happen and I'm not butthurt by it.

The way it was done wasn‚Äôt performed until that very week. The concept itself has been around for years but that particular method was around for about a week. They put bandage fixes on the particular method, NOT the concept as that requires heavy engine rework. Because of this, people are probably now attempting alternative methods to accomplish the same concept because the concept ISNT fixed

You know this isn‚Äôt the crimson chin right?

I'm glad he maintained the anonymity thing. It would've been so easy to capitalize on his fame and become like a Shroud or something, just someone at the peak who shows everyone how he does it etc.

I think the fact that nobody really knows who he is gives him a very unique and interesting place in video game history. He'll forever be Zezima: The man so many men wished to be, and not like "Carl Smith, aka Zezima" which isn't nearly as cool.

 Also it means I can keep telling girls I'm Zezima on tinder and that might work for me one day.

Sorry, what‚Äôs a bond?

Lol ain‚Äôt that the truth, I remember when I was a kid I thought if I bought membership I could change my character into a skeleton....never got membership in my defence though.

PUNY SLAYER, I WANT YOU TO KILL 20,000 ELVES! CRUSH THEIR LITTLE BONES UNDER YOUR BOOTS!

does it have anything on the front? i wouldn't recognise the design as representing osrs if i saw it irl

yes and i love it
---
A bond is a token you can buy at the grand exchange for 14 days of membership time. If you make enough money in the game, you can sustain membership without having to spend real-life money
---
Haha you got it! Thanks for the feedback and for bearing with us through some holiday-based delays
---
Wait you‚Äôve lost me
---
To be, or not to be... ANNIHILATED!!
---
I think the best way to go about this would be through new questlines. And don't change anything until you complete the quest (and even then, make the changes minor, i.e. no new buildings or giant craters).
---
Like end up kill Bob from Bob's Axes for being a HAM member, and he's replaced with a Dorgeshuun goblin with a better shop and maybe cheaper repairs. Maybe a few unique items - degradeable like Barrows items - are only repairable/available here.
---
Al Kharid perhaps unlocks an anvil in the room below the furnace, free daily uncut gems from the gem store merchant, and a new slayer monster or two below the palace.
---
Basically new content that doesn't make it seem like anything has changed. The scenary and nostalgia remains intact, but the areas are updated and given a reason to visit slightly more often.
---
Wow!

Either you're wasting your time trolling or youre wilfully ignorant, sad either way

Some friends of mine have been trying to encourage me to play runescape again and today I caved in and decided to play the game again with them. When I went to purchase membership I was given a message my account is not eligible which we thought was odd. I started looking through my account and noticed it received a ban on 15-Aug-2017 for "Macroing Major" and evidence is "Jagex Moderator Comment" which I find very odd as the last time I played was back in 2015. My friends asked if it was possible that my account was hacked however my password is still the same and it still had the same authenticator linked to the account.
---
I'm not really sure how to feel about this and would like to know if there is anything I can do to get this looked at. I don't have any emails from Jagex/Runescape notifying me of this either. Quite disheartening to be excited to play again only to find out I'm unable to use my old account because of something like this, and even more so that it states in the "evidence" that this can't be appealed? Any help and assistance on this from the community would be much appreciated. Thank you.
---
p.s. I know social media platforms such as this are not the best places to get this kind of thing looked into but we didn't know where else to turn to.
---
I KNEW Jorgen would show up.

They've already researched the effect of random events on bots, which is negligible. Bots are complex enough to be able to avoid aggressive random events, hence when they took them out in the first place..
---
Your clearly searching, that is nothing to do with what I said. Except at least one of Liverpool penalties shouldn't have been. Leicester at least should have had 2 more than they have.
---
Anyone who isn't a Liverpool fan can see how many of the decisions they are getting. VAR is just highlighting what everyone thinks. The big sides get all the decisions.
---
Trueeeeee

Have like a 1/1000 chance to get a rare expensive drop. I‚Äôd be on board.

Maybe the drop makes you more efficient at the skill you were doing

I remember scrambling for my life on the docks of Karamja as a super noob fisher... good times... gooood tiimess....

Kinda sounds like you were hijacked if it's asking you to recover the account. Most likely it has been locked and they are awaiting for the owner to submit a successful recovery.
---
Once you regain access, make sure to use a new unique password, set authenticator, and create a new recovery email (also with authenticator) with a different password so you don't get hit by DB leaks or something.

---
Jagex haven‚Äôt convinced a high enough proportion of the player base yet, glad to hear your open to new stuff. 
---
What‚Äôs the point in changing your mind, if you feel strongly about this it could be your job to inspire others to the other side :) 
---
If you goal is to have the best melee setup possible, you should buy them. If you have other stuff you are looking to buy, then I would probably buy the torture and delay prims. Torture is one of the most cost efficient end game melee upgrades, with only ferocious gloves beating it out, so it's worth getting soon. You can sell both if you are getting a very important item like rigour or either dragon hunter weapon for vorkath.
---
Most of the endgame armor upgrades are tiny upgrades anyway. Even if you buy the "wrong" choice, you aren't really missing out on that much. So feel free to just buy what interests you the most.
---
You can get 15x exp per bone at the bone burner on a Zoomer or a pew pew boi.
---
If you get bones on a prayer boi from a dragon impling and bury them, you only get the standard 5x exp instead of the 20x, too.
---
The halved prayer drain is amazing though.
---
Even though you lose out on range, I prefer the Blowpipe. Its easier for me to round up the little healers.
---
Why you have to be mad? It's only game.
---
I was following enele's progress and was sure he was going to, but hyper had easier 99's left when it came down to the wire

Is there anything I can do

Could do with a. J mod having a look at it for me thanks.

I would LOVE an ornament kit for the D2H with a star like that

I had a friend who sold all his items to buy a tbow. After showing off his tbow at the ge for 30 minutes, he had it scammed.

Have you upgraded your contract or got a new phone? I upgraded and Vodafone turned some securenet shit on which age restricts content and blocked osrs on mobile data for me. Same problem as you, worth checking your settings in MyVodafone app.
---
Never understood why they took them out.. it‚Äôs like they want bots
---
Surprisingly, they rule out this kind of requests. That's why I add people willing to take the oportunity instead. Some people of that cc have added me and are also cooperating, althought the cc is hostile to this.
---
Post is absolutely the same, changing a couple words doesnt matter, u still post the same request for the same thing for the same place just switching a couple words in description. Why not join a cc?? oh wait youre advertisiing on reddit cuz its cheaper.
---
Zmi or lavas

Now that I know I have the ability to complete it, I might do that! I'm unsure if it's worth the time at the moment though as I took 1h40m to complete. I will say I did go slow to keep things calm and what not. 
---
I wonder what the slowest time is for making it worth it?
---
Are you happy on mobile or would you prefer a laptop?
---
92 here with no pet, still time tho haha
---
Technically I typed that right before I started the fight. XD
---
Congrats bud! Great feeling isn't it? :)
---
The defence was just an idea but I agree it's not the only choice. My main issue is that any 2m/hr PvM method requires gear switches, supplies, tickwise mechanics, etc and a lot of skill and not AFK at all. Although Zalcano is supposed to be "skilling pvm" it shouldn't be any less afk and risk free than  mainline pvm.
---
Other ways to encourage more gear switches is to have mechanics requiring  axes and harpoons that need to be equipped.
---
MONKAfish
---
Sure is. Means a lot to me because I never got my own back in the day until after it became really easy to do in rs3.
---
I work a desk job; plenty of RS time
---
You lot would hate my page lmfao. I was even awarded a golden gnome for taking shows from Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney.. you name it and adding RuneScape items to spark some sort of nostalgic feeling for the viewer by bringing two ideas together. Now... her crossover may not have much difference from the original like most of mine do but give her a break she is just doodling for the rest of the community to have something to look at and appreciate. Instead you sit here and belittle them. All I can say is at least they are doing something at no cost for the community to enjoy.
---
The best feeling when you get a drop like that!
---
The servers grow strong, my lord
---
This is awesome. Keep up the great work
---
Not sure I support the other stuff, but something definitely needs to be done about the dying without penalty mechanic
---
Do you have anything to cite for either of those claims? I'd believe it but jw
---
Only 4gb of ram
---
Was it due to https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Tim_and_Crunchy_2006.png
---
Kind of a hellscape when you really look at it

No... definitely don‚Äôt do this.

They got the swamps and deserts as their new content.

I was working on making one but got burnt out and busy irl. I think I'm a few quests away from mm2 and ds2.

Doing mm2 for the dragon javelin drops
---
But yes, it's very much so like a second main
---
Even in like 2007 when these were in game the bots back then were capable of dealing with most of these events, nowadays it wouldn't cause any difficulty for them it's really not hard to avoid these from a scripting point of view.
---
[**Oh that‚Äôs the same guy**](https://clips.twitch.tv/ManlyCourageousGoldfishWOOP)
---
The other stuff was just spitballing ideas but the riskfree death (and how easy it is to never die) is a major issue
---
If you upgrade your dragon defender to an Avernic defender, can you then go back and get another dragon defender? I'd like to have a dragon to use for PVP and an avernic for PVM.
---
I‚Äôm only mildly chaotic, I don‚Äôt check the weather forecast ever. If it‚Äôs going to shine, rain, snow, blow, doom gloom or whatever, I‚Äôd rather it to be a surprise, way more interesting.

Can you make it into a wallpaper? i would love to use it!
---
Lmao looks like Sick Nerd.

Open task manager with it open. Click the performance tab and see how high your cpu/ram usage is.
---
Did magic damage and everyone walked around in their full rune (or how else would you flex) and it would slap you rapid 7's. 
---
Evil chicken had no fucking chill, absolute ruthless cunt for some reanimated poultry
---
Not exactly, warding added in a ton of stuff in addition to making magic gear, and I think if all it did was add the ability to craft magic robes it would have passed
---
GL! Achieve what I could not!
---
Thanks for the reply, been checking out your old posts.. he f‚Äôd with the wrong person haha, nice persistence
---
Yup its a very straightforward fight. The nature of the way RS has evolved means that its going to be very difficult to move away from PVM/combat based money making.  They almost need to explore more puzzle based ‚Äúskilling pvm‚Äù in order to add a new mechanic. Lol im imagining a guitar hero style rythmn game where if you screw up you get kicked out with no loot.
---
There is one guy named "Bob Vance" that I think put me on ignore since I would always ask what line of work he was in when I'd see him.

I will do my best :)

Someone posted this pic in an osrs fb group. Was unaware of the video, my apologies.
---
They were supposed to combat bots, bots got better and the events just hurt real players.
---
Regardless of there being a better cape, this is a big step for most casual players. You should not have let that take away or belittle your achievement. It was YOUR goal and no one else's and you reached it. It doesn't matter the size of your goal compared to others. If your goal is to smoke one less cigarette a day and you do that, then get hype because you succeeded and that's all that matters
---
read your second paragraph bro that shit makes no sense at all
---
For thieving I mapped right click to A button on an Xbox controller and laid in bed watching movies lol

Is the twitch prime 14 day membership promotion already over? It says it was available from November 5th till December 10th, I can't find it on the twitch prime loot page so I'm assuming they took it off already?
---
I like it. But I want to see another version with Waldo hiding somewhere.
---
Current world and location? I need it for reasons.
---
Did this all last week and got to 90 str and 84 attack so farüòÇüòÇ
---
That's different though. They purposely changed something and made players not like it enough to quit. They didn't change anything this time.
---
I would also buy this
---
The worst is the repeat phrases:
---
Any drop like getting an arma helmet:
---
‚ÄúFucking shit I don‚Äôt even care, I‚Äôll take it. I don‚Äôt even care. I don‚Äôt even care man, I‚Äôll take it. Not even mad bro I‚Äôll take it dude I don‚Äôt even care.‚Äù
---
Why is this a reaction to having a drop??
---
Or that clip of Ice Poseidon dying on a hc during MM1:
---
‚ÄúExcuse me? I had 26 hp? Excuse me? Excuse me? What? Excuse me? Excuse me?‚Äù
---
Holy shit I love the content butt some of these guys need to expand their vocabulary...
---
Second that, amazing work. Hit me up with PM with link if it is to buy anywhere :)
---
Tag yourself, I'm one of the bone piles.
---
I mean.... avg key is legit worth 50k...thats not a guess lol
---
MA1, MA2, and chaos ele for dragon pick. Ezpz.
---
Lol your points were all awful. Just spend money is what you said. He wouldn‚Äôt be making a post about making GP for a bond if buying it was an option. 
---
Can‚Äôt spend money on a membership? That‚Äôs fine buy the bonds instead. Lmao great advice /s
---
i know whart a goat is and thats not a goat lol
---
Uhhh
---
Yeah this seems to be the popular opinion. Guess ill start using him instead
---
Same thing with Chocobo. Like I get it, you got a 1/1000 drop after killing 800 of them, it's not that big of a deal. He hyperventilates and kinda sounds like screeching.
---
Man I remember that, it was so funny looking at noobs trying to eat and run just to get auto'd back in.
---
Thank you very much! I'll inform you about the outcome.
---
Lol all these comments can‚Äôt even see the humor tag
---
78 herb if either someone else has 90 for overloads or you do a muta/tek raid. Decent farming level, 70s preferred but it just speeds stuff up, again depending on who you are playing with it isn‚Äôt necessary (you could get seconds as they farm), construction level for the chest. Other skills worth training are mining, agility,  wc. But none are necessary. You should be fine with your stats if you have 78 herb. Anyone who is scared to take you with your melee level is bad at raids or so elitist you wouldn‚Äôt want to put up with their shit.
---
Goblin Lives Matter.
---
He was the first famous video game player ever.
---
Zero sympathy for scums like you. Seen ton of posts about mutes before and it's always the same, "no evidence waaah", the jmod smack down showing and OP confessing. 
---
Absolutely a well deserved mute I am sure of.
---
Oh sweet. I‚Äôve always been interested in drawing. But stick figures has been the best I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôd need a stylus. Lol
---
You‚Äôre super talented man keep them coming
---
Hahaha jammy fuck, grats
---
Just posting this because I'm mostly curious if there are other players out there that regularly play accounts that are permanently muted, and furthermore if the offense that resulted in the mute is coupled with evidence to support the infraction. Four years muted is a long time and I've had to rely on communicating to other players with emotes for the most part. My account (an Ironman) currently has closer to 340M total XP and a 1.2B bank. I play it every single day but it is deeply frustrating to have an account I value so much rendered incapable of chatting with other players. Perhaps the mute is justified, perhaps it isn't. The frustration lies primarily in not having the evidence to know for myself.
---
Fuuuck. And I bought one on release for 31m cool.
---
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs how it goes. Until you start meeting some harder to reach requirements you might end up having to choose. 
---
If you want something that‚Äôs pretty good money, I recommend slayer. You might need to put work into it later and start with something else to get your bond money but it might be more reliable in the future, but for now you might just need to choose
---
Same I got on 2nd day sold for 46m lmao
---
get 90 str 90 range 90 magic 77 prayer rigour augury piety and some basic gear or just elite void works too
---
RL ranks?
---
Tbf it was pretty cool of a drop when I accidentally crashed an iron at KQ and got a d chain
---
Ive checked the average price for my last 50 keys and the avg price for the loot os 50k, of course there are outliers way above that, but the avg was 50k

Your best bet would be to find a clan on the forums. Most clans around that level would be happy to take you/teach you.
---
Hey, thanks for the hint. I didn't switch my phone (I own mine for more than 3 years now) and I'm using a prepaid card by Vodafone. Nothing changed. I give them a call tomorrow.
---
I only crash Ironman, well it's not really crashing because it's equal to an open world
---
Never forget trapping other players in the Edgeville yew woodcutting area when an evil chicken spawned by spam clicking the door, waiting til they die, and looting their precious rune axe.
---
I mean... The first maxed TL player didn't use it, soooooo......
---
I guess you dun need to buy it at the last moment.
---
Thank you for the reply. Just FYI there were a variety of other accounts that were permanently muted at almost the exact same time as mine in the middle of a spam wave in Mod Marks CC. Many of them were granted a second chance. If the mute is actually justified I'm willing to own it. But for four years I've been deeply unconvinced that what I said to recieve it matches the punishment given. In others words, awaiting a Jmod smackdown.
---
was high alching once. at catherby farmspot 2006ish. apperently after a high alch i deceided to watch a short video on this insane platform called youtube. a evil chicken spawned. luckily i switched back to rs to see my last 2 hp vanish from my health bar. 15yo me lost 2m and 700 yew longs/nature runes or so that day. in 2006 this was devastating lol. ran back and some people picked up my loot. asked really, reallyyy kindly to give me at least some of it back. got 2gp and 1 yew long
---
Lol what a poor sport I would love it if someone said that to me every time! My rsn is ScottsTotlol xD
---
&gt;	it is deeply frustrating to have an account I value so much rendered incapable of chatting with other players
---
That just adds to the Ironman experience though, no?
---
Unable? You had a team working to fix the servers and you could actually play. Like really you're so entitled lmao.
---
Yeah. It's designed to crush the skulls of gods and demons. A tree? Ha...Better go talk to Bob
---
Eh. Not particularly.
---
I had finals that just ended yesterday evening so I thought I‚Äôd wait until today to get the most out of it.
---
Thanks, me too. I am about to just make a new account though. Plus with the whole mobile being down for a week issue... I think she's already done playing after all this :/
---
Lmao, yes I've recently hit base 50s and just shy of 1500 total. Been playing since August this year. It took me a solid 2-3 years to do this as a kid, it's unreal. I think it's a combination of efficiency and the addition of new content as well as a fully-developed GE market. It's ridiculously easy to do things now, I don't think it's just the fact that we're more goal-oriented as adults, but is largely that. What has helped me a ton is fishing afk at work so that I can use money to train skills efficiently when I do have time because I don't have a lot of time to play the game actively.
---
Dude, if no one report you or some pmod saw you,you won't get banned. Just think of what you said recently
---
They should have a minimum risk mechanic like revenants. Where you pretty much always Pk a 46k bracelet from the PvMers.
---
No
---
Holy shit..
---
 They've done it...
---
Yooo rs3 here I come babyyyy

Jed was at both RF 2018 &amp; 2019 &amp; shared his side of the story.
---
There isn't much more to say other than opportunities present themselves when the game is run by a small group in what feels like a small indie company. 
---
Jed is as guilty as several of his ex-colleagues and the accounts that was publicly refunded &amp; posted on the internet was only a handful of the actual victims as there was no way for them to track this.

It'd suck if people tallied up our own individual common phrases, I say "decent" a *lot*

&gt; it said botting macro major, and yes, i ran runelite and it was up to date, i run it through intelleja or something, its how i backed up my runelite settings, i compared it to the a fresh install and fight caves is the only plugin thats different
---
OP was banned for botting, this has nothing to do with runelite as that gets banned for something completely different.
---
There‚Äôs also a runelite plugin that shows when the blue ones will change :)

---
The only thing worse than Zalcano itself is getting crashed by Venezuelan gold farmers every 2 minutes or the inability to find an empty world
---
Arguably one of the worst ideas I've ever read on this sub, and that's saying something.
---
It wasn‚Äôt Jagex‚Äôs fault either...they were being attacked lol
---
&gt; But what people expect is some form of compensation when the service they pay for is not delivered
---
They're delusional. I live in a place with sparse infrastructure and our ISPs and Cell Providers never give us partial refunds or anything like that when our service gets knocked out by ice storms or whatever. The only time I remember a company giving out compensation for downtime was Sony when PSN was literally unusable for weeks and our information got leaked which was a huge edge case. If a company compensates its users for downtime, then they're going above and beyond IMO.
---
Zero tolerance is best policy.
---
A lot of people don't see it, but partnerships gives a resource in -&gt; payoff out feedback loop that they'd inevitably speed up. It takes a few hours/ days to make a reskin of something, they get a deal out of it, that means they can up their profit margins with these "partnerships" or whatever they rebrand to moments later by accelerating that process.
---
It's hard for the OSRS team to see the tangible benefits something like Song of the Elves. "Game integrity" is a hard metric to gauge- best you can get is player retention/ player involvement to justify such a large project.
---
But partnerships would finally be that "foot in the door" with projects that have a defined "resources needed" and "profit made" margin. You don't think their higher ups will see that formula and ask them to pool resources to doing that?
---
Bruh
---
the 64 is rng, this is why when you are going to splasy you try get some gear who gives you -64 in magic attack, because in the end your damage will be negative or 0.
---
and ty by the advice, but i'm just trying to know more about how the accuracy math works o/
---
Something needs to be done about the wilderness there‚Äôs no risk/reward factor anymore . I used to do lots of wildy slayer when you could easily make 300-500k per task from emblems and keys, now I haven‚Äôt been into the wild for ages. 
---
Most of the wildy bosses are pretty rubbish and because of the safespots really boring to kill. They also don‚Äôt offer much profit beyond what you could make afking brutal black dragons. 
---
Most of the wildy has become clan man mode too regardless of singles or multi. No one is gonna be out risking lots of gp as they can get fallen in on by 30 dudes in max flaming them.
---
They could keep the system where gear is dropped on death, but either the timer is long enough that it becomes trivial or short enough that bad servers could cost you a good few mil. People with serious risk could keep a mobile alt near them during dangerous pvm and login, like if their internet goes out.
---
They could also expand the pay-on-death systems, or fully do it like in rs3. These systems are already kind of trivial when you can make back the loss in a few kills. Deaths in rs3 are pretty cheap for what you can earn, and doesn't make the bosses shitting out money thing much better.
---
High risk low grave timers and hcim are probably the only ways to actually make death non-trivial and satisfy the people demanding change. But I doubt it'd pass a 75% poll. And it probably isn't a good system in 2k19 when gear is far more expensive than back in the day, and servers are the leading cost of hcim deaths. So idk. Skilling bosses shitting out money is interesting.
---
Omg, ask and you shall recieve! That's a joke, not taking credit for the idea. It was a plain obvious road to take :) 
---
Brilliant work as always. Can't wait to see what you do next!
---
No, random events as a whole were there to deter bots. IIRC the internal Jagex name for them is "anti-macros"?
---
There's a reason that half the existing ones are basically just shitty 3D captchas. Random teleports sure as hell weren't put in to "combat afking".
---
&gt; Slippery slope is literally a logical fallacy
---
Literally look at how squeal of fortune evolved in just a few months. They promised no pay2win MTX when it came out.

Lol one glance at your profile and every post you make is a one liner similar to this one "trash game, suck a cunt, etc". Your life is trash and it's easy to tell as the mood of your comments reflects the mood of your pathetic life xD.
---
You don't, clearly you haven't been playing very long or are not knowledgeable about many passive methods. Daily staves, cadantine runs, cactus spines are all things that even if you can only spare an hour, stacking up over 14 days easily equals the amount needed for bond maintenance. Even something more active and hands-on like Barrows pulls out solid profit even on 1-2h trips if you can only spare that, and you can do that as low as the level for an Iban Staff.
---
I shouldn't have to train combat to do skilling.
---
This is so charming! Captures that storybook feel that makes the 12 year old in me want to start crying. Good shit
---
hey man I tried

Yeah, can't wait for the non-stop DDOS attacks. Much fun.

Honestly though it‚Äôs only temporary, I‚Äôll get membership eventually just for now I‚Äôm enjoying not paying for it
---
Don‚Äôt miss the point of my comment by latching onto something that is irrelevant. The point is you compared whip to rapier, justifying the new time should be BIS. Whip takes ~3 hours on average to obtain. Arcane does not.
---
Right lmao fucks sake take a break from Reddit if the mere presence of somebody bothers you this much
---
Oof
---
This is awesome. It‚Äôs like I just made my account in 06 and my 3rd grade friend is showing me the ropes (terribly)
---
Try to find an empty world on a 1750 total level world or below. It‚Äôs impossible, not all my friends I want to do Zalc with have 2k total
---
I play in bed with a mouse and a laptop.
---
I remember back in the day you would get permanently muted for saying mark donalds and stuff like that in the CC.
---
Ill bless you with reddit luck for a visage
---
You should try asking u/Dicksmith47
---
So you along with a bunch of other people were perm muted at the same time for the same thing  and you now want it reversed? Don't be an annoying pain in the ass
---
Being an addict myself, it's just something we do
---
Major scam!
---
No no no make it jar pls
---
That has the same problem.
---
When I was a kid I always took 8 lobsters and full rune with me when I would chop trees. Whenever a tree spirit appeared, I would fight it to the death.
---
It's how I got my first rune axe.
---
Being an addict myself it's just something we do ü§∑
---
**END HIM**
---
I dont have that power with a jar
---
Ye I mean that is the implication of "banned while hijacked", is that you weren't playing at the time. And they'll be able to see you randomly login from another IP address and start botting lol
---
Contrary to reddit popular belief they are actually pretty good at identifying these cases.
---
So what now then? They just gather dust?
---
Ok well skeletal at least then
---
woopsie same

This is cool, I‚Äôd love to see a GE one

---
That's true to some extent but it's also extremely general.  If it's only bad for the economy because it's bad for the game then people should be saying things like "Jagex's customer support is ruining the game's economy" and "Griefers are ruining the game's economy"
---
Uh oh FaShIoN pOlIcE.
---
can someone make this into a huge mousepad
---
I mean there hasn't really been a period in rs where clans didn't dominate the wilderness, except for when free trade was gone. Even then clans would still hit mage bank in bounty hunter worlds, and would dominate craters before that.
---
Right now it's rare to get hit by a max team if you're in basics. Most you'll get is a fall in of like 4 random people after a cape swap. Clanning scene is pretty dead compared to before, it's been blown way out of proportion by spade memes. Truth is you'll almost never have to fight off more than 1 person and the odd team of 3 salad robes that are way undergeared for even a dhide rcbow rag
---
Hold it in boys, hold it in.
---
Nice rng!
---
60 attak med u might end up at 61 tho since u alreay got 60
---
Where you belong
---
PLEASE BRING THESE BACK
---
The game becomes 100% better when you stop caring about efficiency.
---
Goodluck, the mod mark mute wave was bullshit back then. My first ever iron man was victim to this and I immediately dumped the account after receiving a perm mute. Would be cool to see you unmuted. None of these mutes are justified at all tbh.
---
To be fair, it's not really a boss you camp in TL, so something like a fee or instance payment seems wasted.
---
At the same time though, so many activities should have been changed, like Sarachnis, to deal with potentially 100+ people switching between the same 14 worlds trying to participate. Especially one that should only get busier as the league goes on.
---
Bottlenecks like this just aren't fun, and considering the brevity of the content, why would it matter at all to have free solo instances like Hespori, or something?
---
Everything is gone in 30 something days, arguments about maintaining integrity are silly to me.
---
torso is the only "really great" item from there. the other stuff is all usable but not that great.
---
Basically why they were removed. Bots were changed like a day later to handle random events, while regular players still had to deal with the shit.
---
Why isnt there anyone asking for 10gp to get into al kharid?
---
Not as high quality as the version which edited actual tears in, seen a year ago.
---
Good. Cuz I don't care lol.

We had been doing raids once or twice a night for weeks so once we finally got something we couldn't help ourselves

Bar agility pipe only agility exp regular account....man?
---
In my experience it was always the shitty base 80 cb mains rushing pures in max str/dh bombing that would flame
---
Why are you the way that you are? You‚Äôre a grumpy 80 year old man trapped in the likely overweight body of a boy who plays too much video games. Why would you be such a cunt all the time? Just seems silly to get angry and act like an ass every day, especially over games.

Twisted people of Runescape, I give you Anti-RNJesus

Jokes on you I just used it to cop a free 10xp.

(:
---
Do you think there is a possibility for the divine supers to be revamped to work like divine overloads?
---
Why they were not designed like that from the get go is beyond me.

lol

I have bis ranged for vork. I just bring void melee helm and a bgs to start the kill.
---
You're a little bitch dude. Jagex owes you nothing because they didn't fuck up. Imagine you ran a clothing business where you make and sell clothes. Someone comes and Rob's you at night and steals your stuff. You get your orders out 4 days late, but now some little prick is telling you to refund his money. They got ddosed you entitled little child, fuck off.
---
Inefficient only ironman, he could've amped it up and hopped the falador wall for 1xp a hop.
---
You fell for a obvious scam, if it is too good to be true it is.  Divine potions have been scam items since they came into the game, next time someone offers you strange items you aren't sure the price of double check on the ge or at the ge tracker website.

Do vampire slayer just be sure to wear a condom, it‚Äôll be fine

Also I‚Äôm still bracing myself for the existential crisis that will be post-swampletics life

You‚Äôll accept my mom any day.

the good old days of killing goblins for the 10gp al kharid gate toll

Spend the $11 real money for 30 days membership.
---
That thing has like 9000 defence it's pain in the ass to kill
---
Connection memes are like sooo yesterday
---
Reminds me of when Mod Matk showed the logs of that one dude that "didn't do anything, pls unban me", when in fact, he had been slamming constant racial slurs, prejudice, sexism, threats, etc.
---
Every reasonable pitch for a Mory league has had it paired with another region like the desert. On its own its simply too tedious even with relics and some quests/stats being available by default.
---
Oh that‚Äôs clever dude!
---
15 minute quest that stems from Morytania lore
---
I hate that fortnite made battlepass a thing, but the whole dlc system b4 it wasn't great either.
---
Stopped working for me days ago. I mean it still kinda works but hafta click 100 worlds and sometimes restart my phone
---
Gottem
---
It's easy to play osrs for 6 hours/day when ur a student that afks the game while studying. Gonna be in that chair for a while anyway
---
This is like the most common dupe problem accross all games. Part of the meta to Minecraft speed running is killing a either skeleton on the same eact moment you force quit causing it to drop it's item and respawn the skeleton saving time, and in essence duping it.
---
There's even a mod in Minecraft that works on this principal called the parabox.
---
When you start the parabox it makes a save state right then and there. You gotta keep it powered for about 10 minutes, and from there you can grab whatever you want to dupe in your inventory then loop the parabox, which causes the server to crash, then when you restart you have the duped items and everything returned to normal.
---
This dupe method in no method is a new concept, even a lot of older games had this problem like Pokemon where you could dupe Pokemon/rare candies by closing the game when it says saving do not quit.
---
lmao
---
70 in what 5 skills is nothing
---
You can also get a 4 dose stamina if you carry a torstol around for the jakyl random
---
I think it was around 500 hours, didn't keep track. And yeah i did try to finish it off quickly yesterday with lavas but got frustrated with the lag and my own lack of skill :p
---
50/50 either they buy or they don‚Äôt lol
---
I fucking knew it, I told the boys you were a walker and they all called me a praying noob
---
I want 60 smithing for fremennik exiles so im doing blast furnace
---
Yeah I mostly sit in 2k-2.2k worlds it's fantastic.
---
Bro I remember when they updated the 2Hs to look like that I was pissed
---
I didn't read where this sub-reddit was coming from and thought it was a cool parody of Goblin Slayer.
---
I love how bright the colors are makes me want a RuneScape where's Waldo where you have to find party pete
---
That is unfortunate... I‚Äôm sorry for your xp loss.
---
My personal experiences have shown me that only Australian servers will guarantee a connection. I have issues connecting to UK/NA servers.
---
Wish they would do that for me too, over a year since my manual perm ban which I'm still oblivious over the cause and actively trying to get info on still
---
don't think voiders usually get to 100 cb
---
Pray lvl¬ø
---
I get what you're saying but at the same time Evscape got manually reviewed and banned for macroing so just because something gets a manual review doesn't mean anything other than a person at a desk went "yea that's a ban". Without knowing context and seeing evidence I wouldn't just side with Jagex
---
Dang man rippppp
---
gold selling sites being taken down would contribute to the supply of bonds, rather than the demand
---
Dueling nexus is online and free. Once you figure out the site its tons of fun
---
It's easy to anyswer cause it's skilling boss pet.
---
Butch will sue you for stealing his idea watch out
---
It's not possible for a venezuelan player to just trade over GP without getting banned.
---
They will only transfer money to their own mules through other methods than trading before selling the gold from those accounts by trading normally. This is only common practice for VZ farmers and not everyone else goldfarming.
---
To be clear I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs my point of view, merely interpreting his statement.
---
Lmao I don't even play the game anymore so it wouldn't affect me.
---
Did you try to refund the membership through Google?
---
You're not missing much. Havent had a single positive encounter with anyone in TL, maybe its the limited resources and competitve game mode but people have been toxic as fuck. I literally have public perma off and entity hider on, I just pretend its a solo mode.
---
bro you gotta put more enthusiasm in ur vids it‚Äôs pretty boring lol
---
Swampman good
---
Yea dupe pokemon gltich wad the real thing
---
Nerd
---
Okay
---
Makes sense some thing are a bit difficult to find enthusiasm for especially when you are in pain and tired lol
---
Great plan, doesn't work.
---
Ahh damn sorry to hear. Do volcanic mine you'll get it back in no time. If you want I can send you the discord just pm me.
---
I hope you know this made a lot of people smile. This kinda made my day tbh, thank you.
---
Pm me I'll hook you up with a bond or 2, won a fair amount staking.
---
Great work! Doesn't look quite as refined as your previous, though I think you made it much more challenging by having the foreground more up close. The shading on Konar is a tad lacking imo but I'm no artist so I can't give you any pointers really :P Solid regardless, keep it up :)
---
It‚Äôs A small twist on the classic selling spinach roll 50k, buying spinach roll 100k.
---
 Sorry for your loss.
---
i swear. reddit is so good for lols. but completely useless for anything else :D
---
I like to play with friends or watch tv. In my case its easy because both my roommate and my boyfriend play so I can hit them up when I'm bored with grinding. Even just being able to chat with people while u play makes it easier.
---
I muster have played the game for a hundred hours before knowing about notes items!
---
Yeah alright, don't cut yourself on that edge. Bootlicker is just the new buzzword from whiny entitled twats who are mentally stuck in middle school and think they're cool for hating something people like.
---
You're pretty free to fuck right off and find another game or service that never has downtime, but you'll be disappointed because they don't exist. Nothing is perfect and you can't always have what you want. Stop being a spoiled kid, shit happens and sometimes it's inconvenient. Get over it. Swear to god, if not being able to play a 20 year old game for 2 days affects you people this much you're not going to last in the real world.
---
ppl replying are completely clueless
---
Sorry https://imgur.com/a/ICuc5CX
---
I like this drawing. I can tell you had a lot of fun doing it. I love it because I can feel the fun.
---
Really???!!!! Coz I thought that if you put things with lower than the market price it will sell to the guy with highest offer. It is because if it will sell to the lowest one, you can buy many items with 1gp. Dun really understand how it works.
---
For mage I think there's better ways. Splashing in nightmare zone (practice on a piss-easy boss is fine) is OK but you may as well to super-easy NMZ. 
---
Normal customised rumble; Vampire, Sand Snake, King, Trapped Soul, Kendal. BIS magic shit you can afford/void and a Salamander on magic. Absorption potions to 1000 Absorption and mage pot.
---
I would be surprised if there is another area restricted any time soon. I feel like no other area in the game has such diverse content available for every skill.
---
ok gamer
---
Yeah i should have caught it when the ge price was 3k below what he was buying for, but i just wasn't thinking.
---
It's not the biggest blow to my bank, and I can make it back, but i just wanted to make people aware.
---
Man, "conversate" in the very first sentence? Enjoy the unsubscribe, swamp man
---
What was that problem?
---
40m is nothing
---
"Playerbase treats devs like shit" is gonna be an equally big problem
---
Wow surprised this didn‚Äôt get much attention. I love the idea/lyrics haha. 
---
Would love to see a lyrics video or somethin!
---
It would only increase the value of hardcore accounts.
---
The best part is it makes sense lore wise as the whole point of ToB is that if any citizen of Morytania beats it then they are allowed to leave.
---
Imagine if you were dealt a good card of hands in life that made it so you didn't have to worry about any financial things. If I won the lottery my life would be half video games. half my significant other. Don't hate on him because he has a supporting family, or whatever his case is. I would use the fuck out of that if that was my life.
---
Maybe if you keep defending them they'll make you a pmod!

3 uncut diamonds as well. Look it up. üòÇ

I mean rimmington house has leprechaun literally 9 steps away from portal

Leave ur poh dungeon for once NERD
---
TIL that monkfish exist irl
---
might happen if a streamer makes a serie in zanaris
---
At the beginning. Early wintertotd is op with cakes (definitely not a unique start though lol) and early questing is unbeatable
---
Check out the blast pump, shit's pure aids
---
Last I checked gold was .58 USD for 1m. I just did the math from there and saw it was 70k. The price has been dropping though.
---
Gold farmers going all out on zalcano
---
I really love the art style in this!
---
No. A developer should not make exceptions for accounts that have chosen to limit themselves on purpose.
---
If someone said that to me I'd be even more inclined to talk.
---
THE

In a game where you can do anything you want, I see no reason why it can't be shaped for casual as well.
---
F2P area, not literally F2P. The only skill you wouldn't have decent access to would be Hunter
---
You get maxed stats and hope someone doesn't scam you by switching rules. Than its 50/50 but your ev is like 48% or something
---
Wife here, swamp man good husband bad. Also, boyfriend good.
---
BH trading requires even less skill and generates more gold/supplies.
---
Its just staking at duel arena, 100% RNG. dont do it
---
I read your comment first, and hoped with all my might that your username was Stiffler.
---
Crystal tool seed has hit its high alch price, around 300k.  I don‚Äôt think the displayed price has caught up yet.
---
Upgrade trees fix thus.
---
Powercreep with new content killing old is sacrificing valuable parts of the game
---
Powercreep should respect and build upon old BiS, else the whole trend ahead is straight fucked
---
Conversate is more fun to say tho
---
I kinda just started making an alt while playing twisted league on the main.  it's currently at 197 qp 75att 89str 75 def in terms of prepping for rune dragons.  It's also living at bbd's right now (94 range started bbd's at 88) since that seemed like a good way to make my alt more self-sufficient, and not be 100's of mil in debt to the main.
---
The other guy is kinda right that it is like making a second main, but while I'm working on maxing the main I might as well do something else while bank standing right?  As for most rune drag alts being an iron's main I don't think that's all that true.  Sure there's definitely plenty of people who do that, but I personally know a guy who has two rune dragon alts running at all times, and they're definitely not just his irons main.  His main isn't even maxed he's basically a Zulrah prod and has absolutely ZERO interest in playing an iron.
---
They accept Reals as currency but yet no osrs servers on brazil yet. SMH
---
I try to vote on merits myself despite being a pvmer, I voted yes on the ancient weapons in wildy only, but at the end of the day, toxic pkers cause the divide between pkers and pvmers just as much as spite voters do.
---
Oh wow
---
So much this goddamn it :(
---
I trim rune

F.

COLLECTION

The duck even says "Quack!" I love it!

I trust the ban system more than some person that is likely leaving out a couple of "slightly" important details to the story.
---
You should have to work for the things you want, giving them away devalues everything.
---
I was curious and found out he is named 'LARGE UNIT' incase anyone else is interested.
---
You're complaining yet you've hit the 1/5k drop table eight times with 14k kills. Come and see my dry streak then you'll have something to complain about lol
