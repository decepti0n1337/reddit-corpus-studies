Got on my 18th. Get gud kid.

---
---
Well if course not, and the 70m is a theoretical value, because you cannot continually check spirit tree health for an hour in one go. 
---

---
These are all theoretical values, but they still are still taken into consideration because if you add up the time spent just doing this activity until it reaches an hour (which will of course take a few days to a week or longer, depending on your playtime), you will get a high XP per hour. But over the course of this week, you did actually only spend an hour of your time on it, and so it's a value you can use.
---
After starting to use it, i’ve already noticed quite a huge difference with how long my run lasts! Kinda crazy!
---
What's the best setup for melee vork? Avernic and pray mage?
---
If only they were still at 33
---
I did, it’s just been a very long time. Think it was a fluke lol. I think it’s my inventory that gets messed up. I always take too many hits and I’m out of the minimal food I take by wave 55ish and have a shitton of prayer left
---
[removed]
---
Oh my b I’ll fix it
---
So don't complain then lmfao
---
That's actually kind of interesting could it work to trade gold sink for item sink?
---
Bit of a sausage-fest.
---
No one's ever seen the two in the same room
---
I could be wrong but as long as you have +1 mage attack you will deal the same damage to them because they have 0 magic defense. So if you used and ancients staff it would have the same result.
---
"Creative"
---
?
---
&gt;70m is a theoretical value
---
So is anything above 4k Hunter xp.
---
&gt;You cannot continually check spirit tree health for an hour in one go
---
You cannot continually check bird houses for an hour in one go. 
---
Birdhouses are 4k an hour, but very fast. Notice how people don't talk about how much gp per hour it is to get daily battlestaves from zaff? It's not "5k gp an hour" it's "70k a day".
---
Smh my head he is a NMZ prod
---
Just do multiple kills per trip, makes it much more chill
---
We are just volunteers. We are partnered with Jagex though, but they don't have any say in our content.
---
Submit a support ticket.. just like any other support system.
---
Appeals are more or less an automated process. Knocks back most of the garbage but the few times a clear mistake was made the appeal system quickly reverts it (I once got auto muted because I said "join cc" and "buy" in the same sentence or something so it auto flagged me as a gold seller or something).
---
If you want a more detailed ticket... Submit a ticket.
---
What about the classic wishing for more wishes?
---
Not that rare lol
---
~~I bet 1m that~~ Runelite will have this feature in 2 weeks
---
Rip... 74 just made mine
---
Or ya can let ya boy play how tf he wants
---
So strange, I remember it clearly but can’t find any reference to it
---
Where did he suggest to make rev caves single?
---
Kills without spec are trash, nty.
---
It's banter if the last 15 lines before we see are the other dude saying more of the same.
---
It's not at all banter if this is the first thing said in a pking situation. 
---
Geez bro when are you gonna grow up and realize context matters and OP has omitted the most crucial part, THE BEGINNING.
---
Wtf am I looking at?
---
Rough, addy cane is the most essential medium clue item for an iron man
---
&gt;I use justiciar
---
Just camp pray mage lol
---
The 15% damage boost applies to bursting
---
He said a naughty word, offence and drama ensued.
---
No wonder the sub is trash now
---
So basically you regret selling the pieces back to get some quick gp with amylase packs.. well played
---
The bank is right outside though.
---
Although stretched fixed mode on Runelite helps you have it be full screen
---
Ditching the justiciar and using ahrims instead so you learn from your mistakes. Spend the money on an acb and supplies
---
Assuming you have an authenticator on you RS account and not your email while both are hacked, they can remove the authenticator and get into the account immediately. They want there to be something like a 3-7 day delay to pull the authenticator off. Why they don't have an authenticator on their email as well is beyond me.
---
Can't a guy make a wholesome osrs post without getting shit nowadays? Like come on, I haven't even pegged him in days.
---
Lmao
---
Please do this
---
English contractions have stood the test of time and yet...
---
Yea the one with 1yna winning went great. The only issue is there’s always a few guys that make it into singles and ahk during their fights. Jagex still can’t detect them right away :/.
---
Or a man with a beard
---
Yes
---
Time to start doing boss tasks now!!
---
5
---
you gonna keep reposting this?
---
you ok bro? if you need someone to talk to my pms are open
---
Also the gloves in boxing prevent the damage from really showing up until the swelling kicks in.
---
I've seen a lot of studies that say Boxers suffer way more brain damage than MMA fighters simply because of the difference in the gloves.
---
I keep getting signed out every other world hop. Shit, last night I hit the world hop limit and couldn't log in for 45 minutes 😂 trying to mine rune sucks right now.
---
The dmmt were 1yna won went pretty well. They did the beta tests and nothing went wrong during final hour I’m pretty sure.
---
Give us 1st person view so we can see the tv
---
I was getting the same, just managed to log in! Try again!
---
Why? Just Why?
---
...
---
There are 19.  Which one?
---
Rune *dagger
---
Get all blue cheese.  Veggies are a waste
---
Will send leweds photos for prims
---
Honestly, I wouldn’t focus on combat too much until you get members. As was mentioned, maybe work on getting the F2P quests done first (and obviously train the skills required for those). But even at low levels, training combat is *so* much more efficient and enjoyable in P2P. For example, there’s a quest that will take you from 1-37 attack without ever training it and a lot of other quests for decent combat XP. 
---
Even as a lower level, you’ll still get your money’s worth as a member. But do whatever you want to do and just make sure you’re having fun!
---
Get  hot bbq or jerk
---
Rev cave or the ge on pvp worlds
---
I don't get it
---
now I want to make a 69 all level locked UIM named sixnine
---
Any specific world for caves?
---
The sites already in top notch condition! Keep up the good work.
---
Hey man I have my moms CC. How can I obtain this lootations?
---
yes but for real, I have gotten 84 unsireds which of 52 pre-collection log, as you can see my kc on this picture
---
Same problem.
---
Seems like the benefit of the doubt is being misplaced.  On top of that, I don’t tend to tolerate people who behave like that, even when provoked.
---
You know it’s people like you that just downvote for the hell of it. I had to clarify something in the title  then I decided to remove it and post when it’s more active on reddit. If you’re going to downvote, at least mention why. It’s the least I ask.
---
Same here... Still trying
---
Where did you get the other 5 wizard boots?
---
The screenshot says 1523
---
Bro what
---
I love the OSRS WIKI. How do I stop making the fandom one pop up??
---
No sarcasm dude...
---
Same, no luck so far
---
you don't even want to know about the crazy night back in settlers day after Brian and Rommik had immigrated from other parts of Gielenor.
---
Let's just say that there were a few long and cold nights shared before they decided to call the town Rimmington.
---
"jinkers"
---
Thank you for this wonderful phrase.
---
I treat it the same as christmas. I just buy and avoid selling, most items/bonds will revert to their normal prices over time.
---
How many snails did you have sexually mollusk to get that?
---
But he has far more than 4 wizard boots so he must have been hunting for longer than the collection log was around
---
They take a 50k split so seriously.
---
If you have less than 43 prayer the price will be significantly increased.
---
I just ground out my large runepouch. Wish me luck getting to 70
---
Hi AnD wElCoMe To My GuIdE
---
But they're 60m on the GE right now...
---
EDIT\*
---
I just got a new robin hood hat, just two clues later
---
The real question is will the ely go back up. That thing was once like 700m, then 400m now it's 600m. That item's wild.
---
During my rc grind I didn’t make a ton of gp and I had sold a lot of my bank for Rigour, my construction level, Farming a lot of other skills, so I ended up broke and on welfare gear when I went back into combat, questing and slayer. I just managed to finish ds2. Maybe a break is something I need for now.

I will build an absolute unit of a bonfire with these logs

I spent some time looking through the source today and it appears you're right. I was under the assumption that it was handled the same way as lyzards client (which was downloading and running his own edited bytecode from his own server last time I checked). My apologies, runelite plus appears to handle the injection on the user side in plain java.
---
I did it at 30 hp, so I just thieved a ton of cakes. That was maybe an hour+ of prep time, but I didn’t include that in my estimate. There shouldn’t be any change in speed between iron and non iron. I’ve only gone to 80 on my main, but it’s the same speed. The biggest difference in xp gain is fletching. There’s more than enough time between rounds to resupply.
---
Does anyone fall for this scam
---
I got 9 ranger boot sets (they're made to resemble Robin Hood) in one mild clue.
---
Nah, juggfux knows all about it, but won't give us the sauce we require
---
&gt; yet they would be just as toxic in a competitive situation
---
I've been in plenty of competitive situations and I never resort to being a toxic prick.

I like how this implies Alabama just has one communal Buffalo Wild Wings for the entire state.

No
---
How do you get to see a collection log like that??
---
There is a prompt for alching untradables, but not for dropping them
---
Runescape really needs to bring back the classic 3 minute item drop on death that it originally had. That was the true "everything sink" that kept gear rare and valuable. Also it made gearing up decisions a little bit harder than "always bring your best, most expensive gear because there is zero risk." I don't think any introduction of degradable or consumable gear is going to come close to the simplicity and and universality of the classic death mechanics runescape used to have.
---
How TF is that only 18m
---
is he really that difficult?
---
It helps with seers if you don't have the hard diary completed
---
Lou Malnati’s is my go to deep dish
---
try talking to oziach
---
Uh
---
I remember when Jagex were suggested a Slash equivalent of the rapier (blade of saeldor from new quest/pvm gauntlet) people were hoping that the blade was made by combining the rapier with the broken blade (much like the hasta and hydra claw) so that it would create a sink for both items. As we know, they decided to not do that at all.
---
lmao 😂😂😂
---
This is like, top 10 best ideas I've seen here, not joking. Also could make Agility way more interesting. Plus gives streamers something funny to do.

You can’t use crystal saw for fairy ring, so you need to go to at least 80 for it :(
---
you like sausages eh?
---
Have your tried giving thurgo a redberry pie yet?
---
Imagine having to do either: Pay for a firecape service. Or advertise a firecape service cause you can’t do infernal.   
---
Best of luck I hope you can find some noobs that can’t do fire cape! :-)
---
So in other words you've no clue either
---
Meh the MA2 items are always lost on death. Sounds like a real chad took you out either way
---
Is there any opportunity to bring back Great Orb Project?  Between it being a fun old minigame and the nice rewards, especially for F2P Runecrafting, I think it would be a welcome return.
---
Yeah you do have a point but they don’t control the screen they can only relay what they see on stream.
---
Not even Jesus could help him, but you know... Satan
---
I thought he meant a chat prompt for untradeable DROPS, bc for some reason a lot of people don’t know about it. Unfortunately there isn’t a prompt for dropping said untradeables :(
---
Of course it's possible. You just need to be lucky enough that the monsters roll a 0 for like 99.9% of their hits.
---
It’s blue cheese with wings, or go fuck your mother

Well to be fair, he was probably just trying to get a free trip to lumbridge.

3 iteming isn't that hard
---
If someone throws a punch at me, it is acceptable for me to return the favor.
---
However, if I threw the first punch and wanted to get back at the guy for nailing me with a fresh right hook that immediately knocked me out, I'd send the police only the video of me getting knocked out, and not show them me throwing the first punch.
---
Get it?
---
See response to comment above this :)
---
Cuute hope ya’ll had fun
---
Zulrah bots are a long term investment, unaffected by twitch prime.
---
I heard iron drags are supposed to be blocked for slayer.
---
Is that true?
---
Those are 1 max hit if spec -1 if no spec
---
good work, cant wait to see the finished product!! do you have a twitter you can plug?
---
See rule 2
---
Someone stop this mad lad before it’s too late!
---
I got the other two boots back to back. Pissed me the fuck right off.
---
Thank you so much for this comment I really appreciate you!!!!! My twitter is @rinibunnie!!! But I'm not very active there... Perhaps I really should be ha ha ha
---
Depends on if woox has tried it or not
---
Shutup, you fucking idiot. It's not cool to describe yourself as an incel just to fit in with a bunch of trash people. Make friends with people who have actual likeable qualities and learn from them.
---
Make your own fucking money, pleb.
---
Not enough to make it any more visible since prompts were ignored to make this post
---
Oh mr. Diaz
---
Still only roughly a 6% chance, cmon that's not bad. Go do 1 barrows run and if you get a drop you win.
---
I've been trying to find something like this for months. Thank you. So much.
---
You need as much dps as possible dude, def upgrade the crossbow to able to use ruby dragon and diamond bolts. Also finish off getting barrows gloves and an archers ring. Solo arma is tough without chins man, but that’s what I’d upgrade for a good chance at a kill.
---
Yes, it is that much better. Because if you get it to 83, you have pretty much *everything* you could need in your house. Ornate pool, which refills spec, which the clan wars does not. Ornate jewelry box for unlimited teleports to all the Jewelry teleports. If you get frisky, portal chamber/portal nexus with optionally mounted pendants for even more teleports to wherever you'd need to go, and a fairy ring.
---
Having a built up POH is **absolutely** a gamechanger. There has not been a single thing in this game that has absolutely knocked it out of the park of me patting myself on the back like having 83 construction has, lmao.
---
200-500 hours depending on the player
---
Are you dumb or what? OP dropped his graceful on accident, there is literally no drop warning prompts for that. Get a brain.
---
I'm guessing his kc is around 260,000 so that's pretty unlucky
---
Correct! 83 is for the Ornate Jewelry Box, which is fucking awesome.
---
Thx
---
At least slayer is semi-interesting/has variation
---
Going for pool is way quicker since its right next to the portal + restores spec so for things like vorkath it's very useful
---
You gotta be daft as fuck to think IP bans do anything in 2019.
---
Correct. Once an account is compromised in that fashion, its forever compromised.
---
What about wishing that there are no rules?
---
It's such an easy solution, too... just have a 1/100 (or whatever odds are reasonable) of any item sold on the GE at or below market value just generate the gold, give it to the seller, and delete the item. The seller wouldn't even know it wasn't an actual person buying their item.
---
you gained a follower :) and as far as being active goes, do what makes you happy. if posting there often doesn't bring joy then dont do it :p
---
I dont think thats the pegging they are doing
---
The diamond bolts (e) have a chance to ignore defense. This is especially useful since arma has ridiculously high defense. They’re worth it.
---
Essentially the only things you can't boost for from 83 (don't quote me on this I'm at work and can't check the wiki) are Spirit Tree and the max-teleports Portal Nexus. You can still do the 4 teleport one, and I *think* the 8 teleport one? But not the 16 teleport one.
---
Everything else; ornate jewelry box, pool, fairy ring, alllll that is available by 83 with boosts.
---
You're stupid.

---
Theres a person in varrock museum that gives you a book
---
Nice.
---
Hehe this is so original 😍
---
Know your fucking place, trash
---
Had me in the first half; I thought you were going to say they are outdated and need to be brought up to the meta. T bow is the best weapon against mole of course they should say to use it if possible, they also offer downgrade suggestions for all the gear.
---
After splitting the loot, you manage to earn a respectable 4k as well.  Only have to fuck with 83 more people who would likely literally rather drop you 50k each in protection gp to have you leave them alone since their time is worth more than the shit gear you're killing them for.
---
Seriously, someone start a new OSRS series about gaining profit in the wild only by demanding payment from players to not kill them.  I guarantee it's a moneymaker.  Teleblock into freeze into the chat demanding they drop their looting bag and any gp on them.  Easy profit, nobody dies, and the PvMers would likely prefer you over any other PKer because at least they can continue their task without having to waste time setting stuff up again.
---
I'd watch that shit.
---
Was this highalching, nmz prayers, or something else? Of it's highalching that's wild
---
Lmao suicide f2p looters?
---
40m an hour on lava runners and it’s 250k/hr, not too slow. Expensive af.
---
Sounds like a mobile game
---
But you don't ever need wizard boots do you?
---
The massive amount of money being taken out the game from staking is probably finally catching up with the market
---
Neat, thanks!
---
does anyone know roughly how many marks of grace i'd get from 90-99 agility with ardy elite done? i want to know if i can buy every set of graceful for some reason
---
youve never seen that meme?
---
Always have players set as right click
---
Or herblore if he’s a BTW
---
The boom roast was too good that the person who reviewed the report new a monster like you needed to be silenced.
---
Or slayer if he's level 3
---
I got to 83 with oak larders the whole way, unnoting every single plank at phials. No regrets
---
Is this a Dynamic Banter reference? :D
---
Clicking the check health on a spirit tree only takes 1 tick.

Those are gloves

Don't think u can to be honest since they have a talk option

You can go for Giant Mole pet. Decent money  as well

Ring of Wealth makes a very tiny difference.  You'll basically just get a couple more gems.
---
😂 This tickled my laughing pickle

but it didn't
---
Did you heat it up at least?
---
Hey I got my fire cape with 98 range and a slayer helm. I feel good about it too!
---
Why not just get it as its cheap?
---
Maybe a favorite items option that when toggled prohibits you from dropping items without holding down and manually going to drop.
---
Reign in Blood!
---
The mobile version is just another platform to play the same game, so there’s nothing different from the main version. The community has definitely been thriving lately
---
Rsn: 5th ag3 fury
---
The only negative impact will be the much slower xp rates and limited content, so if you’re fine with that sure
---
Take an addy what tho? Helm?
---
Not really, maybe don't complete dragon slayer tho so you don't get shafted by bad slayer tasks
---
Okay, Aristotle
---
OPs question is really about a ring switch. It's about generally increasing gp/hr/task.
---
My friend wants to know which video is getting referred to?

just shortcuts

Damn that sucks I got 2 rangers in 7 meds

Mobile and PC versions are actually the same game, you can play the same character on both. Definitely worth playing though, Runescape is quite different from any other game.

If you are going to do slayer in magic I recommend using the slayer staff (e) it’s slightly slower than trident, but cheaper and actually has a higher damage cap.

Don't have an opinion either way, but why would it not?

My point is I don’t want it to drop another 10m where as I could have waited and saved 10m buying it then.
---
Who tf said anything about soccer? And I’m talking about professional there have been boxers coming off injuries that did no sparring during camp before their matches
---
Your first mistake was watching the videos on Dailymotion.
---
And also allow you to gamble mark's of grace  so the winner can shoot goals while working towards that graceful. Ain't nothing gonna motivate you more to get that win than some marks of grace and some hot little gnome cheerleaders.
---
I hate reddit circlejerks
---
Why? And how long did it take?
---
This was an extended Nech task - I came close once with Wyrms before they nerfed the task size.
---
I've used that staff before, but I can hit higher with a ahrim's staff and tome of fire
---
noone knows for sure, anything anyone says is purely speculation
---
Good idea, so far I’ve only done a few (mainly Prince Ali)
---
I don’t know what your slayer level is but if you take a look at what’s in the table it’s actually a worse value that other generic drops on certain monsters. 80% of items on the table are pure junk worth less than 5k, best item is like 1/6k chance for 90k shield left half
---
Oof, I bamboozled myself, thanks! Didn’t realize virtual levels counted towards total levels!
---
They say you’re wrong and you answer again
---
gl on 2k total grind :)
---
Same drop rate as DWH. Rip my rng
---
Make castle wars rewards give BIS ammo slot item to give an extra 25% run
---
Thank you!
---
No, TYL (.50\*.50)\*(.50\*.50)=6.25% chance

Not exactly but basically
---
I think they hot fixed streamer luck cause I just got cleaned for 2.8b. 50/50 my ass.
---
I'd say do the following:  
---
* Add a mobile only alch warning for untradables that defaults to ON. I know there's one on desktop but I'm 99.99% sure they share the same setting. I want a warning for alching/dropping untradables on mobile only, on desktop you have so much more dexterity on things like this that players will want different settings.
---
* Add a drop warning with it default ON for untradables for mobile, similar to above. This setting doesn't even have to exist on desktop.  
---
* Consider a similar approach for alch warnings and allow them to be set differently on mobile &amp; desktop, but both defaulting to on at a conservative value.  
---
Tangentially related, when a lot of these warnings were added, I vaguely remember them being defaulted to off and players had to turn them on. In my opinion  that's the opposite approach for how it should be done. It's a lot less annoying to have to turn off an "annoying warning" than it is to regrind graceful because you accidentally drop or alch it.
---
i didnt mean it in that way.. just that when i posted it, within 30 seconds it got dowvoted then i got a comment by you. so i thought u did. my apologies mate.
---
I'm not sure what you mean. If you set the "auto-buy-delete" value below high alch (34k &lt; 38k), that feature only hits the rare occasional noob - no substantial change in the gold flow since 99% still end up alched. And obv we don't set the value above high alch, because that's just increasing gold flow
---
you must not be familiar with probability

IMO low level Ironman questing is very fun, and you'll kind of miss out on that if you hang out in f2p until you get decent levels.
---
It will also be much slower and more difficult to progress, which might be frustrating. You'll probably quicly notice that items you take for granted can be rather hard to come by on a f2p ironman.

the plaintext password exists in memory as long as you are logged in. The RSA encrypted password is stored in memory for a few milliseconds during the login procedure. The username and password are treated identically in this regard.
---
The point of saying it is stored in plaintext in memory it that it is vulnerable to a different set of exploits, where it wouldnt be if CryptProtectMemory or equivelent is used (Microsofts CryptProtectMemory docs even desribe vulnerabilities of not encrypting passwords in memory).
---
Dont know why you bring up TLS. The RuneScape client does not use TLS.
---
MITM is 100% impossible in regards to the RS client. If you can describe why it is possible the crypto community would like to know im sure.

No but seriously, the collection log didn’t track what you got before it came out. He has been playing longer than the collection log has existed.

Less pkers is okay with me cya!

Well, I'm not claiming i have an insane money maker lying around. Of course it would take a bit longer, but afterwards your bank value would be a lot higher than before. The possibility of upgrading other gear is something I didn't consider though, that makes sense. Now I understand it a bit better :)

I did the exact same thing in December but I just fucking bit the bullet and did 70-80 agility. Got a full set, full recolour and ~120 marks left over just in case they release a cool new colour. It really sucked at first, especially the first few minutes after I had realized what I'd done but it wasn't too bad. Remember; movies and yt videos are your best friend until you get graceful back

it says some weird stuff when you talk to it, and it looks goofy

uhhhh, we had 10 trillion gold, now we have like 40 trillion gold. Obviously gold is worth a lot less.  What's a sand casino? And no the eco isnt doing well in the long term, in a year we will have eight times more gold than we had four years earlier. Look at rs3 eco. No one plays the dead game and there are hundreds of trillions of gold in that game.

---
&gt;uhhhh, we had 10 trillion gold, now we have like 40 trillion gold. Obviously gold is worth a lot less.
---
i mean obviously, how do you figure? keep in mind total gold in the game isn't the same as actively traded gold.
---
&gt;And no the eco isnt doing well in the long term, in a year we will have eight times more gold than we had four years earlier
---
so? this game has been around for almost 2 decades, what exactly is the issue? gold "value" is relative.
---
&gt; Look at rs3 eco. No one plays the dead game and there are hundreds of trillions of gold in that game.
---
I dont know why you think these things are related in any way. gold has different values because it is dropped in different quantities.  that is all.

---
yep it seems this was it. I actually always had Dream mentor bosses enabled but they gave such crap points (like only 2-4k points per kill) and now i'm getting 20k from just adding 4 DT bosses...  wtf haha
---
My baby be listening to ANGEL OF DEATH in his mom's womb...
---
Lost my prims this way! Epic
---
I’m moving towards switching. Right now I’m trying to learn rotations (doing pretty good already). I’ve not done bossing like at all so this is a good place to learn.
---
Don't be so hard on yourself.
---
The osrs RNG is both bad and good. On ome hand, i got pets very early on. On the other, i have got 99 in some skills with no pets, but I have got random drops that are more rare.
---
I’m moving towards switches, just trying to learn rotations first without extra hassle. Zulrah is the first boss I’ve done if Jad doesn’t count :P
---
In rs3 where there is hundreds of trillions of gold, do you know how much a prayer post costs? 450 coins. It's pointless and dumb to make arguments based on arbitrary items. Besides. Any items where the raw material comes from drops, or shops, those items are being stabilized by the economy. Why pay another player 1000 coins for an item when it can be purchased from a shop for 400? As long as there is a cheap source of items crashing their price, they won't go up. You have to look at rare item drops, they won't have methods of replenishment and will reflect the price of gold. Dragon crossbow used to be 25m now its 116m. Dboots used to be 100k now they are 350k. Tassets used to be 20 mil peaked at 35 mil. Zammy spear was 10 is now 15. This is even despite the fact that people are permanently farming these npcs for their drops, permanently increasing the supply of these items in the game until the items crash to the high alch value. Despite the quantity of these items exploding they still get more expansive over time because of inflation.
---
You alching?
---
Now never train mining again
---
I love farming becaus it is sort of quick. Yea, you can only level during farm runs but when I do a farm run then my XP an hour fore those 5-10min is about 1m an hour. The only thing I do no like is my tree runs ruin all the profit from herb runs so farming is just another money sink, unless you are willing to do herb runs until 99.
---
People on RS love to collect random items, and I am guessing OP took as long to collect these as the trade limit allowed, unless he had people buy for him. I know certain players who pick a certain cheap item, create a bunch of f2p accounts, and then load gp on to the accounts to buy a ton of the item. It is quite common.
---
This is a place to ask other players about the game, you're probably looking for the "Post your questions for the weekly Q&amp;A" topic.
---
Jmods don't read these threads so querying here is pointless.
---
Gz on your new slayer helm?

Ppl who whine are ppl who dont keep theire password for emself and get hacked. Authenticator delay gives em time to retrieve the account. There is no delay now so a hacker can instant change theire autenticator and password.

Yeah Zulrahs a great entry into learning bosses, great practice for standing in the right place and gear switches and prayer, you'll get there!

Reminds me of the Fairy odd parents show, where at some point it became some kind of science where the Fairies couldn't do immoral things, while the genie could grant anything - even more wishes.

Holy shit

I always leave my drops on the ground, so once I finish the trip I get to see this thicc stack on the ground waiting for me. It also motivates me to pay attention and not die, because if I die I lose all the loot!

what's the point of this post?

For us players, we don't see any cons, but for Jagex, perhaps data upkeep costs or something like that is the reason why this is not a thing.
---
But honestly, none of us are a Jagex Moderator, so we cannot be certain why is like this. I suggest you ask from a moderator like Mod Ash.

Prioritizing playing games and your own personal time over a relationship is totally okay.

What's not okay is leading a relationship by only choosing the game over the relationship; much better off ending the relationship and prioritizing yourself.

B gloves is easy questing. Fire cape is a little less easy bossing.  Plus id rather see the community hyped from completing a goal they never could when they were younger rather than people asking how to make money with what ever stats or to avoid some weird pker cause they got rekt.

Because that's how Google works. The Fandom wiki existed for a long time, and therefore has received a lot of clicks. Google ranks the site higher because of that.

Use 250k xp/hr as an estimate and work it out. When you get to upper 90s that rate will increase to 300k xp/hr but for now i'd just use 250k to give you the max amount of time it'll take.

I am having trouble with him...if you die and lose your stuff like 5 times in a row can you just pay 100k to get it all back or is 100k a time?

Just to play devil's advocate - how would this work with newer items where the displayed GE price is much higher than the actual value of the item? Surely people would just keep listing their item up on the GE in the hopes that it instasells for the displayed GE value?
---
I see a lot of them sell runes to the shops. Doing slayer and Alching drops as well

I reckon completing ther goblin quests until you unlock the ham storerooms, then you can steal jewellery. You can sell the ones you don't need and keep the teleport ones.

Otherwise, work on your slayer and alch the drops. One good easy to kill mob are ice trolls, you can kill them using fire strike and there are safe spots. Otherwise, another method is making battlestaffs

I've been doing some wintertodt. Was considering going for 85-90 for some starter csdh and supplies. But I just can't stay away from the combat haha. The higher the hp gets the worse it's gonna be at wintertodt. Thank you so much though for the tips man, I've seen that before but didn't know much. I've been playing runescape for 17 years, but the Ironman play style takes me back to 2005 lol

dont die a second death anywhere when your items are stored on death with anyone like at vorkath or zulrah. the second death will make you lose everything!!

1. You can try, but it only decreases the chance of disease, doesn't eliminate it.
---
2. yes obby is the way to go until you get 90-95 hp, depending on your other stats at the time. NMZ points are used to imbue rings and salve amulet as well, all very important uses.
---
3. Different drop chance per plant I believe, but all (regular) plants should have a chance to drop them.
---
I'm off work this coming week, so I have more time to play which is why I wanted to see if grinding it out was viable. Looking at the calculations someone else suggested, it does seem so.
---
I will probably stick to the official world rather than soloing though, as it will be more afk. I appreciate the suggestion though. I might look into it if I get too bored of the official world.
---
If you want to do it there then go ahead. You can pray redemption and tele out each game if you have ornate pool/jewel box in your house to not use any food as well.
---
Yeah, but that's just saying there should be safety for pvmers..
---
And I disagree, there's simply to many servers making the area to safe, as for you running in to 5 pkers, Iv gone 5 hours there not seen a single person it's just chance right now.
---
That is probably true, but it was still an item sink - it shouldn't have been removed in the first place, also as I said it made the game more exciting. Jagex could do more charity events like the Well Of Goodwill but make it so only items could be donated. They waste a lot of $ on DMMs so why not do something that's good for the game and charity?
---
I wish i could see how this convo originated! She got obliterated!

100k each time you want to get your stuff back. If you die while he's holding stuff for you, the first batch of stuff gets deleted and replaced by the second batch. **Don't die more than once in a row without getting your stuff back**, if you want to keep the things he's holding for you.
---
I'd support it if the only thing you could add was items
---
probably mythical if you're using veracs or vig mace
---
While I agree that high effort high rewards is prevalent today, as it should be, bones for example were likely not designed to be harder to "use", they were probably designed to be easily buried, for less tedious xp, as I'm fairly sure there was no gilded altar.
---
you also get way less fm xp per hr if you solo im p sure, and your rewards won't be 28x as much since you complete more rounds on official worlds per unit time.
---
Dependent on thieving level.
---
Actually, Granite ring (i) gives +4 every melee defense and +16 range defense, but -4 magic defense. It's not a bad option despite bad melee and magic defenses because Kree'arra uses ranged based magic = magic attack which rolls against ranged defense.

how embarrassing  can the email be? you play runescape with your gf lol..
---
Oh, so it's like, when you cast magic, you get XP?
---
So basically, you're going, and doing no damage, but casting the spell, and getting XP that way? And if I want to splash, is there any specific armor I need?
---
Yeah but getting pissy about other people being proud of themselves is just being a buzzkill. Maybe it's not much of an achievement but it doesn't adversely affect you in any way

If you have decent stats, 99fm at todt should make you around 15m and considering how you’re “playing frequently” it should take about 5 days.
---
99 thieving(ardy knight+rogue) should also take around a week with your pace and will profit about 15m.

---
Downvoted to Keep it on 420
---
Thats a lot of slayer alts
---
Most people would do 99 at wt but just putting it out there that standard burning logs offers faster xp. Wiki is saying that burning redwoods is over 500k xp/hr so it's hella fast. Only downside is that is does require attention and consistent clicks and you will lose money as opposed to wt where you can make some ok gp. But if you want it fast then this is the best.
---
This would never enter the game. Think about ironmen that spend hundreds of hours to get a single item, only to have it break on them. No, the community, nor the jmods would do this. The only thing they could really do, would be to place a gp sink on items lost on death. It would mean enough for ironmen to try not die and it would be healthy for the game for all other accounts. The only problem it would run into are the accounts that use death mechanics as item storage, such as UIM. It would completely destroy UIM. So there's really nothing Jagex can do.
---
Is Occult Altar worth the ~10m if I'm planning on getting 99 magic for the magic cape soon? I'm assuming no, but just in case maybe there's another interesting thing I can do with it.
---
You need a pair of glasses
---
What if your membership has run out?
---
Is he jacking it
---
I'm pretty sure that you're not missing out on that much fm xp. I'm doing it on a hcim right now at 88 fm and getting 220k xp/h. Wiki says you get 290k xp/h with no fletching at 90 fm so I can't imagine you get much lower when solo and fletching. But on the reward thing you're right, it's &lt;14x the rewards per box. 
---
Wiki says with 800 pts per round you'd have around 670kc to get 99fm. You're guaranteed a crate with two rewards and have a 60% chance to receive a third. So it'd be 2.6 * 670 = 1742 reward rolls. On solo I have no clue how many kills you need to get 99 fm but I saw someone with 99 that did solo only and he had about 80 kills. 28 * 80 =  2240, almost 30% more reward rolls.

ironman
---
You had me there
---
My friends iron man was hacked aswell. He had 2fa on his email and the account and it was de-ironed and used for botting.
---
About 1 in 740,750 according to the Wiki. 
---
The chance is 1 in B - (Lvl * 25), where B is the base chance and Lvl is the player's Mining level, so adding in the drop rate from the Wiki for iron ore (1 in 741,600) and your level you get 1 in 741,750.
---
You ok?
---
You are right. LMS sucks and I don't get why people compare it to sw. Sw required team work, and LMS doesn't.

Even better, since Mod Ash was the one to work on that quest IIRC.

They can do that as well. Even if they couldn't, they can recognize songs, and just have the solutions stored.

Bot detection would require frequent changes to the form of detection. Simply a game of changing the bot detection more frequently than the bots can or are willing to keep up with. That's also not very simple, and will be inconvenient to normal users as well. Along with accessibility options, near impossible.
---
 it will be a random rotation that's chosen next. Also, there is also a chance of getting a random jad phase in the middle of a kill if it's taking too long. Just be aware of that
---
All the 2007 death mechanics would do is remove most of the demand for good items.  Nobody is going to pay 30m for primordial boots for an extra +1 strength if that means losing 30m when you disconnect; they'd just use a 300k pair of dragon boots instead.
---
As he said, dying was not a good sink of items, since there was almost always someone else there to pick up the items before they disappeared.  Keeping items actually incentivizes you to buy and use high end gear without losing dozens to hundreds of hours worth of money.
---
Also keep in mind that when those death mechanics existed, max gear was only worth 40-50m.  There were no Cerberus boots, zenyte jewelry, Tbow, scythe, Ghrazi rapier, avernic, etc worth dozens or hundreds of millions.
---
theyve said they cant really do well of goodwill events anymore because the legal team told them not to equate in game value to irl money

Well - the best way to bring them back is to start hosting them ;)

Drop overlays on mobile would completely eradicate this and make mobile much more user friendly for people with smaller phone screens.

So last night I was having a great time killing lesser demons for slayer, mainly cause they stopped being hostile so it was super easy to safe spot them with magic. Wanted to get some more kills this morning, but couldn't get them to stop being hostile. Is there something specific that will stop them attacking? And does it work for all other enemies?
---
Just pretend to have bowel issues, and play on mobile in the bathroom
---
Bring back the days of runescape classic, where cutting an inventory of logs fatigued you and you needed to sleep in a bad or sleeping bag and enter a really hard to read captcha everytime you want to play again.
---
But gilded altar is a SIGNIFICANTLY higher intensity method than burying, and rewards appropriately. If you remove 1/3 of the clicks required for the method you’re making it massively easier. I don’t think anyone is arguing that chaos altar is incredibly unbalanced content.

Give a warning for any untradeables as well as items over 50k or something around there?

Herblore is considerably faster than agility on an ironman
---
Are you in need of money (e.g. still need to do a lot of buyables for the elite diaries)? Go for a money making alt. If you  are good on money and just want to make another account for fun definitely go for any kind of ironman that you like.

I got my second pair at 44 just last week, first was at 11. He's pissed.

First Settled now this??

You know theres mobile

Golems are the worst looking pets

Did you follow any weird links on youtube/twitch/facebook/twitter that claimed to be giveaways/bonus xp?
---
I also chose this guys homemade ranch
---
Except you'd never be able to sell all 30m items without causing the price to drop back down again.
---
Yea my same friend just asked me too
---
I don't, but you sure do.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty good in terms of money for buyables. In fact, I'm left with farming for buyables. I think I'll create a regular Ironman then!
---
gayest post i have ever seen
---
Ya
---
I went to look at mine, and damn I was a horrible 12 year old: https://i.imgur.com/LHQnWlO.jpg
---
Lol, no. I have a buddy that bought it, before it was buffed for 30m. After the damage percentage was increased, the price then steadily rose up to ~170m. Since then, it has dropped. But it has not been dropping, as you put it, “aince forever”.
---
It's because it's summer time
---
The numbers u/AnotherRandomFinn!  What about the numbers?
---
1.  Ability to access Ape Atoll again without accepting the experience reward. 
---
2.  Exploitable tick mechanics.
---
yeah but he would have said the same thing if he got a champion scroll, shield half, rune javelin or a curved bone. So it's not really that unlucky
---
But how will I fund my children's Oxbridge kindergarten education?
---
If you drop items in the wilderness while being attacked, I thought they became instantly available for anyone to grab.
---
Within the first five minutes, some asshole crashed me and then he had the balls to tell me he doesn't crash people. Right lol. For the following hours until I finished up, literally no one crashed me. I had to world hop to find a free world, and was fine after that. Super surprising.
---
For my 0 subscribers and viewers :P
---
I will go start pking for sure if this comes out on mine.
---
How the fuck didn’t he run? Who goes to Callisto with TB runes?
---
Some of the newer osrs quest actually are taking the place of osrs ones. From what I heard the devs either cant/dont want to rehash the same quests. 
---
They can remove nmz once I've gone back and maxxed my combats
---
Hahaha
---
True art
---
when the servers were being ddosed u didnt lose kc for leaving gwd, so there basically was no kc req.
---
Bundle of sticks. Nice
---
When can we expect the full album?
---
Im glad youd enjoy the update but I still believe there wouldnt be enough people pking on ironmans to warrant a full fledged bot farm haha
---
Any advice for how a person could get started who has literally zero experience flipping?

Gz. Odd choice of boots though.

Whenever you Google something add -wikia to the end. That removes all of the fandom links. Works well for me. An other option is just to bookmark the page and use the search function there.

You can literally buy captcha over thousand captcha solves for under $1.

feel free to post a video of you constantly getting 33 kills with that setup. appreciate
---
Yeah that update happened over a year ago, you’re right
---
No, brimstone ring gives same strength bonus as unimbued b ring plus some more offensive bonuses. I imagine a build like this would have a hard time getting (maybe impossible I don't know) getting it imbued.
---
Yes it is, slayer is one of the easy ones!
---
RATs can also keylog you. Certain RATs have built in PIN detection. Even without RATs can see your screen, so anything you press on screen they can see

No prob finding a team in raiddiscord. Some teams might want maxed though, but I’ve raided with lots of pures and low level mains.

Re 7, I've got 70 construction but it cleaned me out. I've also got 92 farming lol, which is nice. 
---
I've been doing herb/limpwurt/birdhouses/seaweed roughly twice a day (sometimes 4 which is the ring/cape tele limit, any more and I'd probably burn out on them), but my profit hasn't been amazing. The first run of the day is normally only 150 or so as well, since I'm going for a bit more farming xp. (6 papaya trees, celastrus, and sometimes redwoods and mahogany). Plus, I have had godawful luck with herb numbers lol. With all 8 patches, ultracompost, and magic secs, I only average about 60.
---
I do have Varrock hard done, which does give me a nice steady amount every day. I also do some extras like the dynamite for 20k, and misc once a day at 75k 100%. I've also got Mory hard for the bonecrusher which is nice, as well as kourend hard. Every other is medium.
---
I'm probably making on average 300k a day, but I have had a lot of expenditure recently on construction, herblore, crafting, prayer and mats/gear for Dragon Slayer 2. 100k/attempt in consumables on Galvek only to have to tele at phase 4 does add up, and the one death on phase 4 to the tune of 100k consumables and 100k reclaiming certainly does sting lol.
---
I feel at this point since I've got SotE reqs that I should be investing money in some of the better gear, such as a berserker ring, DCB, Toxic trident etc, rather than burning it all on consumables for slayer. I understand the value of investing in skills for the future, but I still feel like it's a wee bit early for slayer.
---
Thanks again for the advice, I guess I'll stick with Konar and cannon as and when it's reasonable and I can afford to.
---
oh you mean something like a password?
---
Different monsters also have different chances of hitting rdt iirc
---
Is this what it's like to be safespotted?
---
ah yeah that'd get pretty complex then haha
---
Yeah it does bug me how many questline are left open. But I also see it as there are some really good places we could add brand new old school content.
---
Well it is my 25th birthday today so it feels good knowing I've been around for a quarter of a century.

I hate these stupid posts when someone gets a rare drop and all they can think is it could have been something else.

Ah I see, nobody knows that the high risk world just disables your protect item prayer and that you still keep your 3 most valuable items.

Get your cash stack out, divide it by the amount of GE slots you want to use. You realistically don't need more than 1 GE slot for your day-to-day game needs, so use 7 of the 8 slots. Say you have a 7m cash stack, divide that by 7 slots. 1m per slot. So your goal is to fill the 7 slots with 1m worth of items each. Go to the GE page on the official OSRS website and check out the "Most traded" list. Price check items and calculate the margin. (Buy price - sell price)/sell price. Assuming you only need to fill 1m per slot, you can usually get away with a 5% margin.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Extras: Write down on a notepad app of what items work for you. Commit to a rule where you have a certain amount of cash you will ONLY spend for flipping. So if this amount is 10m, MAKE SURE YOU NEVER USE THAT 10M OTHER THAN FOR FLIPPING.
---
With a 5% daily margin on your 10m you will only make 500k cash. I know this is not much, but flipping is an ROI game, your future profits kinda have no limit. If you do it consistently once every game session it becomes a habit and you can kinda predict how prices behave.  
---
I only have around 150m in gear, but a 1b cash stack. With a very conservative margin of only 1%, that's 10m daily.
---
its a restricted account that cant complete quests due to the xp rewards

theyre saying he cant get the 5 quest bosses required to unlock nmz

Many ppl do not anti pk because of how easy it can be to get skull tricked. Even the OP was in multi where it is very easy to get skull tricked
---
Nice! I got mine at level 34 mining gems!
---
Should i use d'hide over void armour?
---
I want both, you log in normally then go into a lobby like rs3 has.  To log on from there you would use a pin.
---
Sweet, and it is a guaranteed hit aswell?
---
The absolute worst is when they're blocking you from attacking the portal, so you have to either kill them first or run right around
---
Sick, thanks!
---
you dont need attack bonuses for crabs
---
thats no different than just having 2 passwords tho
---
That’s true, it’s just mainly I’m mining bronze and tin (I know it’s the least effective but I have a reason for it) so when I have to use one inventory space for the pick, it throws off the balance
---
It puts your virginity on display for everyone to view.
---
i dont get it
---
Nothing that describes the problem I have exactly, but thanks anyway. Might be a problem on Google's end too, I guess I'm just gonna wait
---
Even if it looks nice on the right I would personally fuck up everytime I try to get my gracefully on the first time.. but if it flot your boat go on :)
---
Bro you just like, type spanish words on your keyboard
---
&gt;hotmail
---
there you go
---
how is this runescape
---
Why does everyone want nmz gone? Ive only tried it once but ive seen a lot of posts about people wanting it gone now.
---
it's because i rarely use full graceful, i usually wear qpc or fishing cape with it
---
A destroy option instead of drop for items of this nature.
---
So I'm pretty sure my account got hijacked although what actually happened seems pretty odd to me.
---
For some context I hadn't played osrs since earlier this year. About a week ago I logged on to show a friend how the game worked. Then today I go to login for the first time since then and I can't due to 'Invalid Credentials'. After resetting my password and my authenticator I am finally able to log in.
---
When I log in I'm standing in Clan Wars next to a bank chest with an empty inventory (although weirdly I still have a rune axe equipped). I go to check my bank and my PIN has been disabled, but as far as I can see all that's been taken is my coin stack, despite there being quite a lot of other stuff in my bank (e.g. full rune). Luckily I assume they couldn't access the members items as my membership expired a little while ago.
---
Basically, I have a couple of questions.
---
First, obviously I don't expect to get any of my coins back but any ideas as to why nothing else was taken?
---
Second, is the fact that I couldn't log in likely anything to do with this? At first I thought they might have reset my authenticator but I never received an email about that.
---
Third, I've changed the password on my account, reset my authenticator, added a new bank PIN, scanned my PC for malware (found nothing). Is there anything else I can do to secure my account and is it safe for me to, for example, renew my membership and start building my stack back up, because it would suck if I could just log in for it all to be gone again.
---
Thanks for any help!

Preserve and rapid heal work differently. You can 1t flick to keep the preserve effect but can't do it to regen health quicker

I had a f2p only level 3 HCIM for a while lol. May as well do hcim if youre gonna do IM. 
---
Real men do UIM though. I gave up that acc for the same as a UIM lol
---
There aren't any Spanish servers though
---
Yes it's by design.. They're big fat blockers for a reason
---
Pet hunters value pets way more than items. There are some pets I'd probably take over a max cash stack (barbarian assault and the master clue pets come to mind). I'd recommend keeping your pets safe in case pet hunting ever becomes one of your goals.
---
no, it depends on the player, my stuff grows every xx:x4 xx:x9

I am actually, got a 138 kc DWH 2 days ago, feeling great :D

At most bosses all BiS makes a fairly minor difference with scythe, t bow and blowpipe in the game

He's probably referencing how you have them color coded which could indicate you don't know which is what.
---
Alch it for 60M
---
No way in hell the victim would care about losing this much or has the IQ required to know the value of his losses. That Pk was basically just a care package. The brainlet went and sold most of his bank to attempt to buy back his losses thinking it was an oopsie. If he was out of cash, he probably went as far as buying salad robes to go back pking and that's how salad robes pkers are created. Idiots who failed who are now using welfare budget gear because they can't pk. If you know how to pk, you know how not to die most of the with the better gear and the benefits are there.
---
I still don't know why he brought eternals. The difference in effectiveness is so insignificant compared to mystic boots, you only bring these if you are a maxed clan tackling another maxed clan and you want to put all the small odds in your favour. So much for the rest of his gear. It's like comparing rangers to snakeskin boots or no farmers outfit to wearing farmers outfit. It only makes a difference if you are going for 200m xp in the skill, just to show off.
---
The fool deserved to get pked
---
You're the epitome of noobs suggesting ezscape and ruining the game with them, please stop.
---
DHCB is very popular to do a "gear reset" with, as it gives you access to one of the best money making method in the game, so a lot of people has lost a lot of bank value due to it dropping.
---
Lol they literally don't. Most people who get hacked don't have 2 factor and lie about their email having it
---
The good thing is that there is no boots table and getting a pair of boots doesnt mean you were closer to getting rangers
---
You can always go to the slayer master in Burthorpe to cancel your task
---
Veracs on spike is better, so ardy cape
---
None... Dishonest or just don't know what you're talking about.
---
The correct answer is low, as long as you get it from the right site.
---
You're awesome man thanks for the info
---
You can go to the slayer master in Burthrope (or however you spell it) and he’ll give you a new, easy task. Only downside is you’ll lose your task streak if you do this
---
My friend lifts weights, you and I lift joints
---
Getting sandals doesn't mean he was closer to rangers though
---
Looks like a yellow Dragonfruit... more like a Potato Cactus though...
---
obby maulers take zero brainpower to create or pk on and are obscenely strong compared to similar cb accounts, so bad players like to pk on them to make themselves feel a little better about sucking at a 19 year old browser game

Happened to my xbox as a kid. my mom was so happy. Waited 8 months for a new one
---
I was just joking about it actually. But people dont like how others just afk their stats
---
It's literally not a problem. Getting hacked is 100% your fault in this game.you either got phsihed or lied about having a secure password/authenticator
---
Exactly this, what gigaplex said. No clue why I even got downvoted lmao do people really not understand how the drop system works? Getting a rune sword at bandos does not mean rip tassets. Rune sword and tassets r on seperate drop tables.
---
They are pointless in a sense, but also it’s easy to get 500k and its crazy rare to get a pet
---
Do DS2.
---
That’s exactly what I’m talking about lol. Earlier I saw someone with Bandos and a Bludgeon wearing an Obby cape
---
Well said
---
"fucked like ya face" coming from the bitch whose face is probably half silicone

I still don't understand cause they are the same color lol green is range and blue is mage red is melee....

Remove: the door at the back of lumbridge Castle
---
Try hard torvesta wannabe tribridder going for pvmers and gets shit on, typical shitter.
---
you are joking right
---
It would, if it was imbued
---
Yes. What people like you fail to realize is that magic is utterly dependent on teleblock as the skill doesn't have the convenience of KO potential as melee or range does. 
---
We can't break out other weapons and smack our opponents for 50-70+. Our max hit-with absolute best gear is 41 with barrage and 49 with surge.

I'm expecting more 1v1 hybrid tournaments since they aren't planning to go further with DMM.

Just want to let you know this actually worked for me.

If you're 122 and still wear a glory you need to alch yourself.

Do you really need a source to belive that in TWENTY-NINETEEN bots can solve something as simple as that? Dude, cmon.

---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
billieeye has not said the N-word yet.
---
All thr bots in the game. Look at the prices of ranarr, snapdragons. This game is half bots.
---
Still yes
---
You can melee Jad lol?
---
You leave with like 500k in loot every time, roughly. If it was a waste there wouldn’t be so many people up there
---
Hey it worked for Runescape Classic bots may as well give it a shot
---
And with the barrage you freeze them for 20 seconds right? You don’t have to kill someone in one hit when you’re able to hit 30+ and freeze them in place. You’re talking about a stats that isn’t used to just pk or kill. Magic is for teleporting and skilling as well.
---
Not for the easy.  The wiki has every requirement for every diary.
---
yeah no one online
---
Gratz man, I just got mine yesterday first try it felt amazing
---
It’s like getting curved bones from Kree. :(
---
Yeah nothing short of physical 2FA is saving you from a rat.
---
I'm going to believe all the multi billion dollar companies that utilize these know more than you.

My point is a 5-2 min Tele block is too long. You can’t possibly believe that it’s not.
---
Venezuelan citizens are literally eating compost and paper, i'm sure runescape botting is the least of their worries. Plus RWT customers aren't Venezuelan or Chinese, so why tf would their government regulate the flow of foreign resources into their country?
---
Replied in the wrong spot.
---
What's cute is you think the issue from the side of jagex... I'd be willing to bet its computer performance issues that's causing the long time it takes for the game to show you what's happening.  
---
That's besides the fact that you can take precautions and not log in/out while in dangerous locations :)
---
I finished to it
---
ah alright, good
---
Add: RS3 quests. The quests are the one thing I really miss.
---
Remove: Tick exploits.
---
He already has? Lol
---
Can’t expect these brainless to understand basic wildy knowledge. They all speak so confidently lol.
---
that's such an unnecessary escalation lol
---
Another thing that gets me is that while my osrs password is pretty old and I could conceivably see somebody getting hold of that, I changed the password for my email relatively recently and they'd need that to confirm either removing the authenticator or changing the password. If it was something obvious like using the same password for everything I'd say that yeah it's entirely my fault but something about the whole situation just seemed really weird, which is why I'm a little paranoid now.
---
Don’t I need like 75 slayer for them? Is it worth it to switch to slayer instead of zulrah as I’m getting a little tired of the snek
---
Obby mauler? The video shows which quests you could do for that build. I've done the same quests (minus Witch's House) with my defence only 10 hp account. There've been even more quests released so it's even easier for an obby mauler to get 5 bosses for NMZ:  
---
  
---
The Depths of Despair  
---
The Ascent of Arceuus  
---
The Corsair Curse  
---
Tale of the Righteous
---
Lost City  
---
These 5 quests barely have any requirements and are pretty short. They can be completed on an obby mauler.
---
Shilo Village  
---
Witch's House  
---
One Small Favour  
---
Shadow of the Storm  
---
Contact!  
---
All of these quests you should be able to complete with just HP &amp; STR if you want to get even more points.
---
yeah i forgot they added those zeah quests, my b bro
---
Congrats sir

We met 10 years ago in a chat named "Spirit of Saradomin" and pretty much exchanged phone numbers that night and a couple years later, we met for the first time. We then kept meeting up with each other every summer and the past couple years he has worked in my state and stayed with me the whole summer. Been a wild fricken ride and we've been through everything together. Love you bro. (No, I wasn't marrying him nor my sister)

Pet is the only unique I've gotten at Cerb. Probably because I quit at 124 kc.

That's*
---
Presumably because the item was moved from Chambers of Xeric to a drop from Wyrms when they released back in January with the Kebos Lowlands update
---
sure 200k pm me

Purely a personal/internet problem.
---
GE/ trading gear is too important in current Deadman. Maybe in the next version of whatever they’re planning
---
You gotta wait at least 24hrs before you repost something.
---
The original is literally still on the front page
---
Just because you still see bots doesn’t mean that they don’t have 10 people working on it. Remember that the process of creating new bot accounts can itself be botted. Not to mention the number of botters vs 10 people working against it, there are going to be way more botters. 10 people on a team shouldn’t be hard to believe.
---

---
Why do you think you don't see word based captcha anymore?
---
Yeah it’s crazy how many little zeah quests there are now lol
---
Void mage is good for low defence mobs until you get a tormented bracelet. 
---
Void melee and void range are similarly better the lower the opponent's defence is, but void range really shines at higher range levels (90+) where it out dpses God dhide at most low def mobs. 
---
Other than that you use void when you need the inv space because you have less switches so have space for more food brews etc. Learning Cox, zulrah and doing Tob comes to mind when void is typically used outside of vorkath.
---
Nah, this one running atm is the last one
---
This is one of the more wholesome RS posts. That’s awesome mate.

Only thing more wholesome would be if you bought your wife at the GE for 15 trout.

Blacks are by far best for xp. I switched from red to black getting 99 ranged when I got impatient. It’s a good amount more expensive but I don’t have a whole lot of time to play and wanted the cape. If you have the cash use black chins.

You don't have to do the most damage for it to count as a Slayer kill, you just have to do a lil

You must be fun at parties.

It's too bad so many dragon items are like this. Lore wise, they are super rare and powerful metal weapons. When we were kids dragon items were super rad. Anything dragon was cool. First time I saw a dragon mace my jaw dropped. I was f2p and was like fuuuukk what is that?!! :00
---
God you are just...too cool
---
Duel arena tournament mode could be huge for streaming content. A lot of streamers are running out of content, HCIM end game and PVP can only get you so far (excluding the top 3 streamers who could pull 2k spinning flax for 45 days).
---
I could tell you post on the Donald even before searching your posts. I don’t lean hard left or hard right but I am always down to have an actual conversation about how government is run instead of immediately resorting to childish name calling. It’s crazy to me how divisive your comment is with me basically only saying Crowder is a right wing commentator who aligns with every single GOP talking point which is true.
---
cool send me a dm I can send you my info thanks
---
Finally? Kc 2 ;D
---
Will there be a reception in the falador party room? Btw Congrats!
---
I’m willing to bet you’ve never played DMM
---
Anyway, gratz!
---
Didn't hide your suit flowers! Rip acc
---
a video games vs a sport
---
I say Are doughn lol
---
This is a pretty common glitch, even listed in the wiki. I don’t alch or anything, just straight agility, and this happens to me pretty frequently on mobile and desktop.
---
yes
---
Hand around your mates waist?
---
Spicy.
---
they look fuckin cool though
---
The fuck is up with this meme format? Am I just too old? The joke is Nice but fuck this meme format. Get on with the next one please kids
---
If you need a Clan chat to hang out in “SnC osrs” is nice and friendly!
---
Cheers genitals!

To get spades.
---
Then what else is he referring to? The only prompt for banking is at Grimm and the only other thing Grimm does is resource allocation. If he means favor, then you can still view that at resource allocation
---
okay i'm pretty sure OP was exaggerating when they said 50... they were just talking about teams that trade specs and pj lol
---
Just hit 99 and I'm sad
---
Yeah, you really have to count any rdt drops as the base chance of hitting the rdt (or godwars rtd) so the drop he got is really just a 8/127 roll against other graardor drops.
---
Something you have to learn as an ironman grinding the dwh, where you likely get most rdt drops before the wh :)
---
That sounds needlessly horrible as an official gamemode
---
I have no idea what I'm looking at. Its like Shrek nutted on my screen.
---
and if you die (even a safe death) you lose all the bolts in it. 
---
Have fun.
---
Do some more quests, i can think of 5 relatively easy ones that give prayer xp
---
Hi!
---
Probably the best tip I can give is having the wave breakdown [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzHaar\_Fight\_Cave#Wave\_breakdown](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzHaar_Fight_Cave#Wave_breakdown)  open on a separate screen so you have an inkling of what's to come. And if you manage to get to Jad make sure to focus on prayer switching, people tend to forget about that when facing healers - attack "1" healer at a time and FOCUS on getting your prayers right.
---
Cheers!
---
The mode actually used to be like that before they starting catering every update to ironmen. Now it's just shopman mode and slayer for skilling supplies.
---
Max gear and you need 3m that desperately?...
---
thank you that makes sense.
---
thank you thats it
---
What can I say i'm not a funny guy xD
---
That's exactly the fucking point, it wasn't thought through
---
Obviously anecdotal, but I havent really played rs in years, and i've never watched DMM. I just hang here for memes and Swampletics, but i'd probably watch the shit out of competitive castle wars
---
Sooo did you get saved by swamplectics just to wake up to your girlfriend saying shes pregnant? Thats one hell of a morning lmao congrats!
---
Yeah I'm going to binge a few guides tomorrow so I know what to expect, I was working off that setup too, wanted to know if anyone knew of any alterations.
---
I'm hoping the mobile thing wont make it too hard but it's made everything else harder so far so I don't know what I'm expecting haha!
---
Appreciate the luck, if only that's all it will take!
---
lol it went from 6m to 600k gp
---
and no i never owned one, it just feels weird to see a lot of items crash because of new areas and slayer mobs being introduced.
---
No- thats just overkill
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah, if I ever get to jad, prayer prayer prayer! Cheers mate!
---
99 Slayer and never done Guardians. I should though.
---
Thankyou
---
Before anything get a fire cape and barrows gloves.
---
Not just you, coming from a pker/clan pker, the servers are absolute trash rn.  
---
Trying to hop worlds in wildy with clan has resulted in all of us sitting on "Please wait..." for 1-2 minutes in-between world hops only for it to be 50/50 on getting booted to login screen or not, then after that it's another 50/50 on if it will even let you log in.  
---
P.S. If you have a wildy task to do, do it now, deep pking is scuffed rn.
---
Lmao i havent done tears of guthix yet but i love always sunny so take my updoot
---
That’s a good start, do some quests and unlock more content. You could always play barbarian assault mini game and get the fighter torso until you have enough money for a bandos chest plate at level 70def
---
I usually bring pretty kick-ass boardgames.
---
Honestly dont know how the team introduced an item like this, it is obviously a fun weapon(?)
---
Dont mind new 1 atk weps, but this was the wrong way to introduce it imo...
---
Is this Pollen farm?
---
You're fucking nuts aren't you
---
Yaaaa lmao. Are you trying to go with a different setup because you arent trying to range or cant afford the setup? Or what sort of alterations are you looking for?
---
I have about 15M so money isn’t a huge issue
---
Sneaking in the plug
---
This, unless u want to get flamed by every 99 farmer you meet
---
Ao only one person on mage hand and only 1 person does last head phase?
---
You died before the next tick happened, so the prayer never went up. Pretty simple.
---
It would be fun to see if u could complete a raid in that gear. The only rule is no gear switches.
---
I tried spamming log-in for some mins, got in for a few secs and got dc'd and now the same...

Contact local pharmacist for any questions about any pain or side effects you may have.

Can’t seem to find you on hS
---
that poor dude in torags
---
Will message tomorrow if you’re on
---
Oh now I see what you mean, I used that too back then, had no idea that was gone! Totally agree that was a crucial mechanic when using ranged (or magic, but it kinda sucked even back then lol).
---
Why tf did Jagex "patch" that out??? That really sucks!!
---
I actually made a rework post of Warding that would have specific wards that could work just like this (or kinda more like Castle Wars barricades, least those were what I had in mind when creating the post). Might be sick having those in Clan Wars along with this.
---
Good advice ☝️
---
that actually sounds pretty effective, plus the obby sword would help for Vasa yeah?
---
\*steals\*
---
Mate I'm sorry to say but either she knows and is too embarrassed by the cape to say anything or she's been working a lot of overtime with her infernal caped coworker
---
Sites like 2captcha.com

If OCR doesn't work you can have some dude in a third world country solve a captcha for a fraction of a cent in around 10 seconds

Amazing, Hope you had a great time!

Most wholesome thing I saw today😁😁

Y’all tryna bash him on his obby cape? This man spins more rhymes than a lazy Susan, and he’s innocent until his guilt is proven.

No clue, but I’ve been seeing a lot of people get this error only recently, surprised they haven’t tweeted or posted something about it

Advanced ancient lost civilisation, Jagex woke af.

Lol, I got muted once because I said "pocketwatch" in chat because "twat" was in the word

No but I'm basically dont do invention

I always felt like it was an anti-bot measure. Not necessarily for the full blown bot clients running scripts. But for the people who try to position their camera just right and ghost mouse. Gettift placed on this floating tile once every few laps would completely break extremely simple bots like that
---
Is she not the mother of your kid?
---
Cool.......
---
A lot of people go far past 99 without a pet. They're much rarer to see than skillcapes, which people pay many mils to get 99s. and how do you manage to reach 800 bank slots without having a spare 500k?
---
Looks like the white walkers entering Winterfell
---
cannon slayer with blowpipe if you're decently rich
---
it's fast enough.
---
If you're turbo rich just chin at MM2 tunnels
---
Depends if you have a rich main or how hard you RWT
---
I don’t think pets and all should be added that’s more like a collectionist thing. Maybe max cape, all achievement diaries, quests, max zeah favor and things along that line. Pets and all drops shouldn’t be included I believe
---
50/50
---
Farming patches next to the name.
---
&gt;o you have questions about?
---
i got your point, i have just checked all the Support Center and didnt find any answer about this.   
---
as the RWT is a problem i dont want to get banned by making a lot of Drop Parties on live streamming, also i want to know if there are some special program for streammers and some other questions and help.  
---
i appreciate your time, thank you.
---
Did you try turning it off and back on again?
---
I only used justicar in waves 57-63 tbh.
---
Weve
---
OMFG HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Well this one makes sense after watching, right? :P
---
Just use rune cross it’s fine. Or blowpipe if you really want to get it done
---
🦀🦀🦀 Jangleplex bad, Monster Murder gooood 🦀🦀🦀
---
That’s cute. But it doesn’t look centered:(
---
You made zero points to counter, you just spewed insults because you’re upset about being pked too many times by obby maulers. You’re a living meme.
---
I've got a 200 KC, the trip pays for supplies, let me know if you want any tips on inventory/ set up
---
It's the steps of the campaign escaping the prison
---
Preemptive "nice."
---
You get nothing from killing chin hunters in the normal game anyway
---
i dont get pked by obby maulers because i don't make accounts in that bracket due to the fact i am not a brainlet
---
good attempt at psychoanalysis, alch yourself
---
I-Is this a Brawl skin mod?
---
Dude that's Andy Samberg what are you trying to do here
---
What percentage are you getting, 1/16 I hear
---
So by your logic, the original Ironman armor shouldn't have been added? Ornament kits too? Trimmed items? All optional cosmetics that don't serve an actual purpose.
---
Lumbridge?
---
84-88%
---
Do you have sheet music?
---
 I am not here to give misinformation, much less to create a disturbance or complaint. if that's the impression then im sorry.
---
im trying to host some events in my stream, i want to know about a program for streamers and some security questions about my account. the RWT is a problem and i dont want to get banned just by trading items to my winners.  
---
ps: Jagex is so clear the tickets you send on a wrong section will be removed and they wont answer.
---
Some people think it should be included
---
And thats why they dont add it in
---
Too subjective
---
I don’t think that geezer can reach higher
---
Also from wyrms.
---
Add elemental workshop 3, quest line is unfinished.
---
Then why do you have such a strong emotional reaction towards a niche build in an 18y/o browser game, friend?
---
No, the reason i started runescape was cuz twitch prime had 1 month free. Most of my money comes from fletching.

Tithe farm  gang

It should be orange.
---
who else likes to remember back when they were happy?
---
Hi there, thank you for your help. Ye fire cape definitely way off still have 1 lvl in range.
---
HERE'S HOW THEY DID IT!!. The scammer asked for money and I gave it to them.
---
I told someone to enjoy 50k loot yesterday when it took 2 of them 3 minutes to take me down. I wonder how much in supplies they wasted?
---
You got married before you could grow facial hair? Bold
---
How to solve these: get the first 3 of the first row in place (use google for a reference) then line the next 2 up so you can slide 4 and 5 into place. Repeat all the eay down. Or you can get runelite and it tells you where to move each piece 👇
---
Yeah but you do the top row first and then you start the next row and the top row gets messed up. Same with starting at the bottom row
---
500 bots doing it 24/7 account suiciding... it adds up.
---
Aesthetically pleasing sky blue, not wannabe purple emo blue
---
Actually this whole experience has done me a favor. Because of my chat limitations I now feel less inhibited to do other socially taboo things like crashing skilling and pvm spots.
---
Have you ever played with entity hider on before?
---
nice one my dude hoping i can get my first cape tomorrow
---
Runelite - yes easy. But I wanna try this just once the way jagex intended and god damn it’s just making me realize how tedious this game would be without runelite
---
I’m with you! I have everything done except freeing the monkey, Desert Treasure, and 30 QP’s.
---
Stfu ty
---
Gz beast very wholesome
---
reminds me of sharks and minnows
---
I don’t want to get ruthlessly shamed for my obby cape IRL too
---
Theres also an op ass client called runelite plus that i believe is gonna make them block 3rd party clients again. History repeats itself you heard it here
---
Cough* warding
---
Yay?
---
If you start with the top row (or bottom row) and finish it then how the hell can you mess it up by doing the 2nd row? You literally don't touch the rows that are done lol.
---
I have a 4 way switch, I wear blessed d'hide, tassets, slayer helm, blessing, b gloves, b ring, prims, Ava, bp, anguish. I switch into BCP, Abby bludgeon, torture and f cape. I have sgs for spec. I'd say 4-5 is a good switch amount. I angler and pot up at clan wars. I then take fresh:
---
Inventory is slayer ring, ring of dueling, rock hammer, 2 s combat, 2 ranged pots. 8 s restores, rest brews. I generally do 10-12 kills a trip. Kills 3m ish. Always make profit (about 120k inv cost, 500k+ in loot)
---
try doing a coordinate clue without the list, like actually using the sextant and bullshit.
---
only the first 10 characters matter? what???
---
The second one might be some MTX shit for RS3
---
He has 60 prayer... Good luck with that
---
Oh man you're in for a treat with ds2. Most fun I've had questing and I usually detest quests :p
---
Gl bro
---
No tbow? Gz
---
Bet he snogs ya wife ha
---
Do top row.
---
Then 2nd.
---
Then 3rd.
---
Then bottom left 4 pieces 
---
Then bottom right 6 (5 and one blank)
---
Easy I used to all the time
---
&gt;Don't show people your hours at Hans in Lumbridge
---
Isn't this a myth
---
God I’m dumb I never thought one person would have multiple bots

Makes no sense
---
Olmlet in the background is thinking about mcdomalds
---
It’s always hilarious when cheaters get called out too. They’re always super incredulous like “what?!?! I would never! You can’t prove it! You know you have to prove it for anything to happen and you can’t so shut up!” It’s like bro, calm down and stop cheating in the future. It’s not like most college exams are hard if you put in literally any effort and pay attention. Even the low IQs on this sub could probably get by with Cs.
---
Well done! Actually impressed.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
That's how I solve them, my record is 45 seconds before runelite and osbuddys addon
---
I get only 3-5 kills per trip as I don't have brews but my kill time is about ~3-4mins as well so I guess I'm not doing too bad
---
Probably not the noob wearing 50k gear
---
The humor tag is a bit of a stretch here.
---
I had this happen to me a week ago, I'm guessing you already tried reloading the client? That's what worked for me, there wasn't actually an issue with my account.

---
Is your gf using her work email everywhere?
---
Thats pretty poor online practice she should change if so. I hope shes not using the same password everywhere as well.
---
She also seems to click links w/o seeing where they're from. Just hover the link to see where its really going before clicking. This is true anywhere online, discord etc.
---
This game aside, these are behaviors that can easily end up with her identity stolen or some other big headache (ransomware or something of the like). 
---
So some better online practice will be a benefit. 
---
I'd also keep screenshotting anything the guy says, because if he had access to her work email hes going to know her name probably and might be pathetic enough to harass her over the phone or something.
---
Go all in again.
---
:'(
---
That was my all in lol
---
Add: Stealing Creation and Daemonheim (as a minigame, not a skill)
---
Remove: Free member trials from Twitch / mobile
---
You started it...
---
It was a joke man. Guess I should use /s.
---
I mean people have fun luring pvm bosses in the wild and killing them without a challenge. Killing a player is faster and often better loot than a callisto kill
---
we need a grandmaster quest that explains the lore of the ancient machinery and we find out OSRS is not actually medieval high fantasy, but is really a post apocalyptic dystopia.
---
Is Tithe farm good? I've never tried it, im pretty new to OSRS, I played a lot os RS2, but my farming was like 20 back then.
---
An item / gold sink would do wonders for osrs.
---
To further elaborate, the easiest way to get into pking is using a pure build. Though, you’re free to look up pking builds and see which seems the most fun to you. I’d suggest creating a pking account once you’re able to fund it on your main.  You’ll be losing money at first when you’re learning, so you want an account that can pay for that. 
---
As for your main account, the other person said it best: Max melee and get veng.
---
It corrupted my education too 😂 that veteran cape got traded in for technical college 🤘 still living the best life though 😁
---
Well carbon comes from coal. When iron and coal are smelted together it forms the alloy steel, which is just iron with 1% carbon. The final product is a much tougher metal.

Wait seriously?

Why does he shave his mustache but not his beard. Are they purposely trying to be as neckbeardy as possible?

Just wait til you see the Irish spelling of Nieve..

6 months seems like a long downward trend though. Do you think i should sell this thing or hold onto it? I dont really need the cash

Yes. You can spend 50 points to have your patches never grow back weeds after you rake it.

Depends what you use for, if your bank is like 100m. I would buy dhcb and vork for gp, items went up at the start of the year due to hydra.
---
That is fucking adorable. Get your barrows gloves dude it's an expensive grind.
---
Oh, so you get farming based rewards for playing it? I'll read the wiki page and try it.

The Keanu Reaves circlejerk really needs to stop.

Check out minescape.me

They've recreated it in Minecraft and its fucking ridiculous.

Just added in crafting this past weekend.
---
Gold sink isn't really hard for Jagex to add more of, but item sinks are a bit trickier. I'm not fully on board with the whole Warding skill proposal they showed us, but the Dissolving part is interesting.

Tin foil detected.

Are you the slay brother? I enjoyed your videos 😁

I’m just referencing a meme format tho, not commenting on anything about him

You know that I am hard. A whack mofucka I aint. So I stand here all day and I scrape the paint.

Scrape the paint, scrape scrape the paint.

u look like the kinda dude to inherit the family farm but sell it to chinks because you're too addicted to an online game
---
Except the number of players has gone up, what with mobile release.
---
He’s an Ironman. Kinda pointless
---
This. Or use RuneLite. Depends on if you want to put actual brainpower/effort into it or not.
---
Does he intend to do quests or diaries? Because that's just next level silly.

Green team = dream team
