Event rpg from diango, 3t wep with no stats

---
---
If you don’t care about efficiency just do whatever you feel like
---
I've never played an iron man and am loving playing this while i fish karambwans for 99 cooking on my main
---
Just another day on the 405.
---
Whip -&gt; chaotics was the general way to upgrade back when t80 was released, but even with the upkeep, chaotics were just so vastly better than whips that it became a must for PvM in order to compete at things like GWD.
---

---
Also, like someone else pointed out, people tend to forget that RS3 isn't just some new game that came out when EoC did. Its economy is almost 20 years old, and that's a REALLY long time for items to come into the game (and items come into the game way more often than they're lost, especially higher-value stuff).
---
No
---
not really a fair comparison tho considering 1M gp is the equivalent of like 40 cents
---
gratz brother, thats probably the first master obtained so far, too
---
I want them all
---
A hole is a hole
---
Later virgins
---
If only one “conductor” leads the train and everyone just throws their alts on it, this could work.
---
youtube in your username btw
---
You can do it with 0 decently well
---
Screw it I’m gonna make a new account I miss those days
---
So if I get a kodai wand on day 60 I can use it for two days? All my progression I will make in the coming two months on skills will be gone? So this mode is actually only for competitive players  who are trying to reach first place or casual players who enjoy it?
---
I'm completely and utterly new. I haven't even done the first quest because I literally have no clue what to do so I just run around and cut wood. Help
---
J1mmy cc best cc
---
Can you steal it when it hits the end and turns around? Lol
---
Well, the stats are reset for the account on which you played Twisted Leagues, but if you obtained any pet during the game mode, those will transfer to the next League.
---
why do you even care lmao
---
Get a slayer staff and set crumble undead on autocast. It's easier than just click on crumble undead then on the minion. 
---
how did you die during acid stage, did you try to practice the woox walk?
---
This is like the tenth post I've seen of people blaming Jagex for a runelite issue
---
I think its fucking pathetic.
---
Call me when you've been training range and/or mage for a while.  
---
This message brought to you by the 85% ammo saving gang
---
The guy in the picture apparently just plays Barb Assault now because you get no xp
---
I don't do this with other styles, I'm still very much learning and developing my craft. I've painted on and off for the past 4 years and I've only finished 11 paintings. this is number 11. 
---
I like this style because i don't have to make things look "real", and I can just focus on creating my own version of the world. Plus mixing paints to create realism is a pain in the ass. I like keeping it simple and fun
---
It can be more than 15x if you choose the right relics. You can get up to 80x for prayer and 20x for everything else. Granted those numbers are once you've been playing the league for a long time and unlocked more relics though.
---
Yes. To all.
---
Idk, probably because it's funny?
---
10/10 gg

---
Runelite is free
---
I’m playing it for the fashion scape rewards in the normal game
---
Exactly, I just wanted to level up and have fun. I didnt know much about maximizing for xp, there were barely RS guides around (even Youtube was a new thing then!), the only Wiki that existed was wikipedia, so much of what you did was look at the highest level equipment you could make and make it.
---
In my case, it seems it was mithril axes.
---
Also I was so happy I could make mithril, it didn't matter much what it was.
---
64,730 pts 2nd raid
---
Awh this is so sweet, can i kiss u
---
[removed]
---
So are they all starry night style? May I ask how old you are?
---
What does it feel like to get your asshole stretched by other men on a daily basis?
---
I completely forgot you can pick magic xp at the library, yeah run might be a good choice, I haven't even picked mine yet, I've just been training skills trying to decide.
---
Howard price slapped me in the mouth but kissed it better so I forgive him. Keep killing it j1m
---
I played RS2 for a while back in the day and then when OSRS was released I tried to do it with no guides. But holy Christ the quests are impossible without a guide. I did desert Treasure with 1 prayer and 1 defense and even WITH a guide it took me ages
---
How long was it down
---
u need 48 hours playtime to play bh
---
What age are you in ?
---
"The correct one to choose"
---
hahaha. I mean, how about people pick what they like, though
---
Wintertodt is broken and punished you for having high hp. It's easy to feel like you "have to" do it before any sort of combat.
---
I don't know how anyone managed to play the game without knowing the answer to this question.
---
Some sort of magic forkery
---
For my pure's fire cape that I got last week, I  tagged 1 healer at a time and killed them one by one that way. It made it much easier to pay attention to Jad to make sure prayer switches were still correct while getting rid of the healers outright to not deal with them anymore.   I ran around Jad to tag the 3rd healer that spawns on the opposite side of it. Make sure to have auto-retaliate on to keep DPS going while healing/restoring prayer in between prayer switches.
---
Vote no on polls, just kidding.  Practice though mostly.
---
Sounds like you should have picked endurance if you wanted to get somewhere fast.
---
Old school players will remember when they actually did take out pvp and the wildly for a bit
---
I dunno, that would mean you could use abyssal accumulator for early range/mage training then switch to endless endurance once you had access to good moneymakers.
---
Viewers and players are not the same
---
You got the idea, it would be like half a crate or so, like 50-100k. There is no reason for 600k to be deleted from loot every kill, enough is deleted already in terms of supplies without even thinking about the other untradeables like ornate. BH2 wouldn't need to generate so much if we stopped it from being deleted in the first place.
---
I’m a very casual player and this is what I think when people say “it’s only a 10/20/30 hour grind you can do it in a week!” Like dude I’m lucky to play 5 hours a week and I’m not dedicating all of that to a boring grind
---
ATTENTION: Zeahs population skyrocketed into the negatives of millions today!
---
I agree. Account is called "hardcore" ffs
---
GL getting nature runes.
---
I'll be over here with my near infinite alchs.
---
I have these memories with my friends and Call of Duty 4. We used to be so stoked when we found new glitches
---
lol...
---
awesome! the first age of empires was what got  me into pc gaming all those years ago. i wore out aoe2 as well, especially bulding maps and playing with friends. good times. its fun to see remakes of runescape areas
---
Weird flex but okay
---
I was actually saying that I don't want those tiers as it will make them too accurate. I would say we should never get over Tier 75 gear unless it's only stronger via passives.
---
the dude is not giving me any money...
---
Practice man, just keep at it. I've always had 60attack, just made a baby gmauler and I kinda suck at gmaul into obby. Leme know if you wanna get some practice in at duel arena or something
---
Honestly f2p range to rune2hand. Learn to 1 tick 2+ hits.
---
I mean, you can become a god in the first 20 minutes of the game with alchemy
---
Very proud of you, chief. Keep grinding.
---
Yum not yuck
---
I agree - there are a number of problems, but it's very tricky to fix. From what I've learned playing bh2, you seem to be able to skip when: your target is in multi (no edge pker wants to chase some random into multi then get maced for their +1); your target is unskulled (again, nobody likes fighting unskullers); you've been matched with your current target too long; or it seems like sometimes you get a penalty-free skip every x minutes (maybe based on how deep wild the target is?). These make sense in the context of being an edge pker, but when you consider it from the perspective of someone farming emblems with mates, it makes it even easier. You can just sit in multi &lt;20 wild and most of your targets will skip you once they see you're in multi. Eventually, you just get matched with one of your mates and they go donate a free kill to you.
---
Skilling gets fk all updates, it's all pvm.
---
Sounds complicated but it's very simple and easy to execute. This strat is basically like doing Zulrah with no switch for the diary.
---
Actually kinda chuckled
---
Shouldnt that mean it only takes 3.33 hours then
---
Yeah for sure dude, shoot me a message with your ign, I’ve rage quit tonight so won’t be on till tomorrow lol
---
Im thinking of doing the same.  Plus the clue scroll relic seems like so much fun.
---
Justiciar has uses
---
Is this possible? I would love to just get to morytania for one second to unlock charter to phasmatys on my alt but don't want prayer levels.
---
It’s not an easy thing to just fix. It’s not just adding something that’s hard to do, with difficult mechanics. 
---
PvPrs don’t want massive drastic changes(that would add more counterplay to genuine PvP) what do you want?
---
More skillers to get ez kills?
---
More PvPers(which are likely looking for skillers)?
---
Do you want a generated “bonus” on every kill to make it more rewarding?
---
Do you want something as profitable as revs in deep wildly so that it’s either kill or be killed? You can’t complain and say Jagex aren’t doing anything if you have nothing useful to contribute on how to go about fixing the situation. I’m down for PvP updates, I understand the risk of the wilderness, but if you guys can’t think of a solution don’t expect Jagex to.
---
Can u post this in about 6 days from now so i can loot first?
---
Not always true if fake websites buy ad space
---
If you had a whip in 07 you were rich imo. I was hella too poor back then to own a whip. Hell I didn't get my first whip till probably 2012
---
Someone should make a spreadsheet of all tasks and how many points each gives. Then input all the available relics to determine which relic benefit each task the most. Tally up all this and you'd end up with a "statistically proven" best relic combo for fastest points
---
There just wouldn’t be enough endgame content.  I bet the next league will be in Morytania after the expansion.
---
Imagine how many whips were lost in things like instanced bosses/dungeons, or when bounty hunter was instanced, suprisingly a lot of loot vanished from that pvp mode.
---
Or the 707
---
It's not that hard. You'll get it another time.
---
I've got like 6 onion rings left, do they count?
---
Not the only! There was the classic Let the bodies hit the floor one
---
I'm not entirely sure what this lol implies
---
I'm pretty sure he was talking about risk fighting in pvp worlds dude, he didn't mention staking a single time.  He's talking about practicing something with a skill cap.... that ain't staking.
---
The print screen relic.
---
Sure, like?
---
Definitely give it a try if you haven't, it's very fun imo
---
It will also greatly increase training speeds of certain skills ie runecrafting/magic. Also useful for those that want to hunt clues, and of course solo raiding isnt possible without stamina
---
Why does the mining animation look so.... fluid?
---
You could also battlefront teleport.
---
I thought I had it all together.
---
I hate flicking more than I hate walking.
---
runs for 2 months, you can earn tradable cosmetics for the main game
---
oh shit i thought only the rune shop sold runes. ty for the info
---
I did 2t teaks from 75-85 wc. I started off only getting like 30k xp per hr (lmfao) because i didnt understand the cycle at all, but after an hour or so i had it down. You also get waaay quicker at luring the birds. The only hard part to get the hang of is dropping, but even that becomes pretty consistent after 2 or 3 hours. I don't normally tick manipulate stuff, but 2t may be the one exception for me. It's less clicking than most 3tick stuff.
---
it's a tourney? what is the goal
---
Completing every single easy and medium tasks gives you about 6700.
---
I think calling 6000 points medium difficulty is a little off.
---
This is wholesome af &lt;3
---
Its fine for every skill except wc and fishing.  If you just want exp for those skills and you took that relic then you are screwed.  It would be nice if it was toggleable.
---
Question; can you store untrimmed capes on the cape rack and get them back untrimmed?
---
r/beermoney
---
I mean. The makeover mage already shrinks or enlarges certain proportions, so it makes sense for feet too. I didn't actually know you couldn't toggle the vambs so i guess I'm supportive of both.
---
This is Nick-Conner. All he does is post new posts all day about PvP related topics, most of which are just top-of-the-head shower thoughts. Sometimes there are good little nuggets of information but most of the time it's just reiteration on the same old topics without new insight or thought applied to the situation.
---
but then you have to make dynamite
---
Maybe get 78 herb if you raid with randoms.. I learnt raids through we do raids discord, google it they have guides as what they expect for gear and everything. Pretty easy to learn too.
---
I think the GWD actually unfroze during an earthquake caused by the anima mundi. The anima mundi being the soul of nature essentially created by the 5 elder gods themselves. I think its said that the anima mundi cried out in pain after zamorak essentially destroyed an entire continent(what is now considered the wilderness), during the god wars of the 3rd age. This cry of pain is what awoke guthix from his sleep where he banished the other gods from the realm and enacted the edict of guthix so ending the 3rd age.
---
You can do this already in a POH
---
1T Tbow? Woox would finish inferno in like 5 minutes
---
And those people will feel bad for you when you are safe spotting with range and running to pick up your shit every 30 seconds
---
Do the quest and get 20% favour of your choice.
---
Came here to say exactly this. Looks more like a screengrab from the news here in NSW 😂
---
I think it was like, an hour or so after leagues went live? (I dunno when the update hit, the servers were brought in sometime after)
---
Slappa da bass man
---
Flex accounts
---
Has to tell people he works in IT for some reason
---
🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
---
It’s kinda like bragging about having a good job and lots of disposable income that you have no real hobbies or social life to spend it on
---
It was down for an hour lol?
---
Getting combat higher will obviously help but also 78 herblore to be able to make tier 2 potions
---
make a new account where your goal is to see how much you can beg for at the ge. thats what everyone else seems to do
---
Issue with the Amazon though is a lot of it is preventable man made destruction and is seriously harming a very vital ecosystem to a whole continent. 
---
Australia's fires are serious and massive, but the Murray River crisis is more environmentally impactful than the fires will be for our country.
---
&gt;Yellow
---
I have some bad news for you bud
---
Real talk, is this a why Fletch meme since you should be doing wintertodd?
---
I think the twisted league is perfect for that sort of player.  You get 5x xp and cool buffs, and the progression based on tasks is nice since theres a lot of misc stuff on there you can do in just a few minutes.
---
If you're looking at making an ironman in the main game and you think it's a play style that suits you, then go ahead.
---
You will almost certainly learn more about the game as an ironman than a regular account.
---
Alternatively play on a regular account for the next few months and look at making a group ironman when it's released if you have a good group of people to play with.
---
Hey everyone, I need tips on how to stay motivated. I’m at 92 mining and mining will be my first ever 99 in my RuneScape career. I’m just tired some of it now and need to motivation to push. I’ve got my quest cape which was another goal, but I need the motivation to help me get this first 99. Any tips!??
---
Are you one of the crazy people who thinks kratom isn’t a drug and just a miracle cure for all your problems?
---
Or do you use it recreationally like me
---
Yrsa in Rellekka already changes your default boots (colour and style of your shoes) for 500 gp. You can also change your shoe colour and hand type for free using Oak drawers or higher tier wardrobe in the bedroom of your POH.
---
One thing I will never touch again
---
For a new account that will be your main, your first goal can be to get barrows gloves.
---
Damn that’s some real shit I used to just kill chickens in RS
---
All runelite is doing is taking the source and changing its rendering client side. It's not rewriting code or anything, it's just a fancy middleman for the graphical output. It's why overlays and information display is possible. It all exists, there just isn't an official interface built to display that information. Runelite creates that.
---
It's the same reason their GPU renderer works because it's essentially taking the whole output and running it through (I assume) an OpenGL renderer to utilise your GPU instead of a single CPU core like it's standard java renderer.
---
Friend recommended slayermusiqs guides. Holy shit did he save my life the other day with SoTE
---
Being able to sell them is super lame but Jagex knows that they would never pass a poll otherwise because the community feels like it is entitled to everything in the game no matter what and it would be “unfair” if they were “forced” to do leagues 
---
Buncha losers
---
Oh you mean like Old-school RuneScape?
---
right fair enough. thanks
---
Just start skilling
---
Yuriretarded!!!!
---
♥️ a true legend
---
Np my friend.
---
*gilded
---
Yeah they're trash and I doubt they'll be expensive
---
Wtf is a Blazik
---
Touché
---
Because it gets you into the mindset of being a kid, where everything was funny
---
Slayer next.
---
updog. ha, gottem.
---
Get base 40 stats while you wait for a guide
---
Slayers definitely not next
---
I got skilled trick today and lost my around 3-4m..
---
The graphics in AoE 2 look amazing for a 20 year old game. 2D graphics age so well compared to early 3D
---
It's short for virgin
---
At least you’re not an Ironman
---
Any idea how long it takes Filimina's wares to restock? No fire staffs on any twisted league world.
---
Imagine wasting your rng on a meaningless game mode. F in the chat boos.
---
Not much I bet. Getting points is ez

No, I'm not, because I chose run energy.
---
However someone who chose ammo saver will save 85% of the ammo that you will lose. In relative terms, they have 85% more ammo than you.
---
Hey guys and welcome back to my shitty 99 grind ironman series. The series where we take fun and start as far away from it as possible so it really feels great when we get there... in 2 years.
---
Shit I killed hespori like 50 times before I got the bucket. By the time I got it, it was like 400k :(
---
gz m8
---
It does the check before it lets you quickhop. It isn't a bug, it's the nature of design.
---
You were the clock that was ticking in my heart
---
So if the nature of design is wrong... its a bug. They obviously need to change the check to hiscores, or somehow your main account.
---
They will be tradeable, so probably yeah.
---
Did you set it to wombo?
---
Looks like pugl just achieved 99 cooking with that roast
---
This made me lol, lol
---
Or slayer
---
High Scores are not live, and are updated after you log out. If you want it to do that, you have to log out for every quickhop. It is the best design option. Just accept you can't do this One thing.
---
I got the cape on my pure when I hit 75 mage and fell for the same skull trick when finishing off claws of Guthix. However I was 62 combat and the guy who showed up was a max main and he couldn’t attack me, so I killed his alt just to make him have to lose aggro again.
---
Very appreciated
---
I finally got a plough and then when I started I realized I forgot my hammer and had to give it up 20 seconds in.
---
What's interesting is that, from personal experience, it doesn't even require sweaty-ehp-grade amount of in game hours to reach a billion. Even a 2% ROI on your money from 1 hour of daily flipping will go a very long way. I personally play like 2-3 hours on average daily and got the first billion in probably just under a year. No bosses, just flipping.
---
This is oddly satisfying
---
L000l dude. You proved his points. 4pts is fuck all. Only pkers use it. The price would be low and tied to the point vs crate price anyway.
---
It's safe and I definitely recommend
---
Amazing idea to solve a very big problem that jagex does not seem to care about. 
---
Ill still be boosting at least 1000 pts on each of my non BH accs just in case they fuck us over and dont revert runepouch to being buyable again
---
Probably cause you're rocking a strength amulet when ranging
---
It’ll seem like a completely new game, so good.
---
I wish I could play terraria. I love the game, the art, the concept but I just get so caught up with trying to make the structures I build look good. I know I lack the creativity and effort required to make something amazing but I still like to try. If I focus on building it feels monotonous, a tedious waste of time with very little reward. Killing a boss and unlocking the next piece of content is way more rewarding. By the time I get to where I have been I get bored and have no urge to play.
---
I've been wanting to do something like this for a while, but allow the use of the forums. That and good old fashion b sales!
---
Haven't even received a single clue scroll yet unfortunately, but when I do I'll report back. I'm not sure if you could get 3 though, as when a clue nest drop, it reads "Clue Nest (Difficulty)". From from what I've seen, as the x3 nest drops are all of the same type (3 rings, 3 seeds, etc. It would be impossible to have 3 of the same difficulty clue scroll). Would be pretty crazy if you could get 3 clue nests though if they were all different difficulty
---
Akchually, they’ll have 666% more ammo!
---
not that I wouldn't necessarily believe in a 1KC pet, it happens, can we see the version of the image where you didn't crop out the KC?
---
Just seems oddly intentionally unverifiable for no reason.
---
Interesting. Nice thing about having untrimmed agility is that I just need to wear it with full graceful when I get a new 99 and it won't trim. I do wish I bought some extras though in case. Only got the one.
---
Indeed! 
---
Also the General store in the Warren's, and the lady next to the fruit stall in Hosidius.
---
Save the fledgling fletcher some searching.
---
It's so you pay for more memberships. Duh.
---
Many players have several members accounts—in other words, they'd make about 5 people worth of money off of that 1 person
---
I very specifically remember this being mentioned during the Livestream q&amp;a. "No, we don't anticipate the ploughs being a problem". They laughed about the idea of people lining up to plough.
---
Construction would be one of the worst, purely as you need the cash to blow for planks. Wintertodt will only get you so far.
---
You know that moment when you forget that B and D arent the same letter? I just had one of those moments.
---
It's a competitive mode using Ironman rules..? Get over it
---
I HIGHLY doubt it was the runelite team. You were most likely got through other methods such as phishing, using the same password in other places, or having your email hijacked. I recommend you change your password to something secure and unique to ONLY runescape, enable 2 factor authentication, and set up a bank pin to go along with it. Also check your emails login history as well as possibly change its password as it may be compromised.   
---
On phishing - If you ever go anywhere thats not runescape and they ask for your password, just dont. If you ever click a link to another place ALWAYS triple check the link to make sure it is authentic.
---
I think most people are held up on this though. Realistically, maybe 0.01% of the people that chose the run perk will attempt cox solo, and even less will actually finish. And then even LESS will even get close to finishing the challenge. So, yes, people who want to beat that mode in the allotted time needed to pick the run, but I highly doubt we will see many successful runs
---
went lvl 9-50 hunter
---
That needs to be said with or without onions
---
The Lance is going up in price pretty decently, the bow is decreasing. Melee is definitely turning into the meta for vork, keep at it.
---
$11 🦀 🦀
---
Dragons and goblins?
---
If you didn’t pick the infinite endurance; your best bet for raids is to go in teams and not use stams or do clues for purple sweets (will be vital for solo). Keep in mind, while running mage hand, regular spells have a longer range than trident by one tile. So you’ll have to step one tile back to perform a ‘tile skip’ as I call it (Synq calls it teleporting) on the tick that you cast your spell [fire wave]; similar to what you do when performing a 4:0 on the third phase in solos.
---
My strat right now is just to get base 40s. Im focusing on herblore, fishing, mining, farming, and woodcutting. Im going to get those up to 50~60 before attempting wintertodt. Then using the seeds from the crates and farming contracts, ill work on stocking my herbs and collecting secondaries. After would be slayer/combat. 
---
Just a rough idea of what im doing. Might change/improvise as i go.
---
Nearly 18m fm no pet.
---
By a longshot, heck it's infinite with just Resilience and +7 prayer bonus. Dark Altar lets you turn on a +15% prayer.
---
Wintertodt was funny
---
Wait it is!?
---
has nothing to do with runescape besides the title
---
anglers are already the highest healing food if you're above ~91 hp, not really much room to go up
---
try bringing fewer karambwans as you get more comfortable and don't have to combo eat as much
---
Dm me a typing test to take I will reply in morning

biggest e-peen

Is your password a full sentence?

pretty sure you just have to run past the trolls
---
mountain guide doesn't guide you up (doesn't appear? idk) before you talk to him at the top of the mountain
---
But if they can get in-game to get to that account management tab they can just use the in-game name changer...
---
You can play both accounts in the Twisted League and go back and forth to the main game as you please
---
you did a trip to revs with player attack on left click and still didn't realize until you skulled on the second trip?
---
Say what you want but he will be casting spells forever.
---
What about Sara brews and super restores? I was watching an osrs maxing series and one of the videos briefly mentioned using them as the meta for longer trips.
---
lmao. OP those are piscatoris teleports, they take you to the piscatoris fishing colony north of gnome stronghold. NOT piscarilius.
---
When there were no bots yesterday, it took 2 hours and I repeat, 2 hours to get into **one** game. 
---
Removing them will essentially kill the game mode. 
---
My question is, if you want to play  the game properly, why don't you go to the AUS LMS world (425) and vs the pro players there? 
---
These bots are actually fun to play against. They actually kill a lot of legit players hahahahahahahahah.
---
watson teleports are the only ones but he has piscatoris teleports lol
---
The pop up warning also tells you.
---
This is HD, not DE.
---
Oh no, I just realised this hahahahahaha!
---
He use to wear Dagon'hai robes. Now he looks like a poor mager. :(
---
Scrolls are 700k. Back when LMS was played by legit players, the scroll was 500k. These bots aren't harming anything imo. They only made something more affordable.
---
The parchment costs 500k to use, on top of the price you paid for it. If you wanted to sell your own parchments, then just wait till prime is over and the prices will go back up?

I didn’t take endless endurance and I don’t regret it. I waste all my energy going somewhere to get something I need then suicide for fast home tele and to replenish run energy. Anytime I need the run  energy I just attack the guard dog, only been a few times where I had to walk and that was on my way to WT. not as efficient as the relic but once I start Slayer I will be thanking dark devotion.

dont think theres much point since you destroy your stat boosts every time
---
it takes about 30 seconds to get back anyway, 1-2 kill trips are fine
---
This is definitely a boring task, but it takes no longer than from like ~65-70 mining lol

Could mine in wildy resource area (level 3 so low danger I guess?) and note all the ores?

Don't so it man, you have so much to live for.

Wintertodt loot is dependent on fishing, mining, herblore, crafting, woodcutting, and farming levels. Since he rushed it from the start its likely everything other than woodcutting was left at level 1, giving pretty crappy loot. Also with it being much faster to level, the overall amount of loot is going to be lower as well

pro-tip: if you end up with one of the outer (one closest to the fence) plows, do your best to ensure you don't sync up with your neighbor. plows have a massive pathing hitbox, and having to run around them to turn them around means that if you've synced up even slightly with your neighbor, you might be forced to run a massive loop to turn your plow around, and you might lose your plow in the process. The middle plow also suffers from this, but you would need both neighbors to sync up. Fortunately the inner plow does not have this issue.
---
pause your plowing for a second or two between pushes or turn around early. I was plownapped twice before I got this down.
---
Coincidentally this is also the easiest way to get a plow when they're full. stand at the opposite side of the plow and wait for the person to accidentally sync up and take too long to get their plow moving.
---
Its not awful, it should be around 40-45k exp hr

Nah you clearly know very little about the game. Run energy is a huge boost for the entire league. It effects everything. Pray is the noob/lazy perk by far
---
u/JagexHusky pls fix sir

Hardly anybody picked pray and they should feel bad if they did.

Seemingly at least 75% picked run energy and regen

And you don't need to do those for the cup

They're there for the people that reach them not so people have to reach them

So dont play it then. Simple as that.

A lot of people seem to enjoy it and i love this gamemode, could have been a few improvements like the zeah favour is a pain in the ass because its so crowded but other than that this seems like a well made gamemode.
---
The hyperloop is bullshit m8. See through the delusion.

You can get another relic that makes it 10x xp, and with 3rd relic a third of your skills are 20x xp.

I know pets gained during the league get shared between leagues, but will it also be unlocked for the main game?

---
Why are the pictures so blury?

are you using recoils or suffering ring? with elite void you should have way less switches to make, it should be better, as you have elite void, you have 100+ cb, so your levels should be in 80s, what else you are using weapon wise, jewels?

I wish they had made an alternative way to get early favour or allow people to stack up on those things.

It will take like a week before you can get a chance at the favour for that shit place with the ploughs.

Mechanics bro
---
I went for DAD as well and plan on getting agility up first through barb fishing. Currently at 48, will hit 60 after work and plan on grinding it out in Wintertodt between kills to 99.
---
Eh I don't think so. You can hunt some chins for easy range xp and mage should be just fine
---
Downvote me for asking a question?
---
Where did you find the info that it is an intended mechanic?
---
Little do you know you'll need a fair few more for inferno
---
This is actually fucking genius

I didn’t downvote you :/

Stats? Slowish kill

Not if it's so hard that you can't actually count on any reasonable supply.
---
Also you're not actually saving them, just not having to pick them up. The only actually saved ammo is in runes
---
does higher smithing/RC level affect zalcano? or is it just mining? and does higher mining levels increase the speed of mining the rocks or only the damage dealt to the boss?
---
Technically it’s correct

That looks terrible.

Awesome, can I have a link to the repo?

Can't see your comment for some reason.

you take less damage and deal more damage in the justicar setup. only downside is if you miss antifire pot you die

This is one of the few conspiracy theories I actually believe. A studio is not going to waste money reanimating the main character for a whole movie. The first trailer was bad on purpose for all the publicity. Now that they "fixed" it, there's posts on Reddit thanking the studio, lmao. The studio literally has people thanking them for a movie that didn't release yet. This is honestly one of the best publicity stunts ever done in the movie industry.

Rune pouches aren’t needed to pk? And you can buy them for a few m worth of emblems anyway ?

I'm having as much fun as ever doing quests as quickly as possible. I had high combat stats (for the time) when clan wars released and was pking most days from 2005-2012. So I'm burnt out on pking and training, but questing is still fresh and a cool way to see progression. Doing quests with bare minimum reqs and low combat is like a whole different game.

Lol then you lose every fight to the death in the wilderness.

Hey bro L0st Dynasty cc I’m one of the owners! Medium sized clan all high leveled at the moment but we are looking for everyone who wants to just be part of a fun group who wants to make each other better so one day we can have a stronger clan. We do everything content wise you can think of and there’s always people to hang out with even if it’s just shooting shit in the cc. We have a structured ranking system and discord, but we also under stand irl stuff happens, so we aren’t strict like many clans are, we are looking to build a family like environment because we all like the game together more than anything. Hope this answers questions you have. Lmk bro!

Based on the fact that they changed the rates for most everything else, and there are obviously many pets being obtained, there’s a good chance they did buff the rates.  
---
It’d be a pretty shitty objective to get a skill pet if the odds are still just as poor.
---
Ok I never say this, but you gotta give Jagex credit based on how many people that are saying that they put an attempt into things like this not happening. It's so obscure you gotta give em a pass on this.
---
Took me like 3 hours to beat the level 20ish guy unarmed in the initiate armor quest, lol. I had one attack, 1 defense, and 44 prayer. By the end I could prayer flick so that was nice. Low level questing is fun.

Humor? So r u just trolling?

Using brews and restores is only viable/ better if it takes a long time to get back the the boss and you are comfortable enough to not brew during a kill.

Is this really a bug tho? He hasn't finished death plateau. Isn't that a requirement for climbing boots?

There are banshees in catacombs that can be safe spotted. They drop some good items as well.

That’d be nice

Yeah it's not really a bug, people just assume they should be allowed to use them but lets see what jagex says.

Things applies to other things as well, like making darts.

They purposely redesigned cluescrolls to only be in zeah, they intended for all rewards to be useable (except the obvious filler trash that clues can give sometimes) but cboots aren't trash

What? Really?

It's what's called a virtual level. People have calculated the xp required for post 99 levels, and 3rd party clients show levels up to 126 (the max possible level with 200m xp). It's purely cosmetic, and has no impact on gameplay.

My idea was to go and smith some steel armour. But I didn't want to mine with a bronze pickaxe. But if you want to unlock the pickaxe shop you need 15 percent lovakengj favour. And for that I need 42 mining. I have absolutely no idea how to obtain my sweet steel armour now without grinding to 42 mining first. I feel such a noob and it feels nice.

 Ideas are appreciated though lol

I'm obviously unfamiliar with Jagex's internal processes and workload management, but I have a feeling now that they "addressed" crates (aka just raise price and buy limit), they have that mental check mark of "we did something" and forget it for a while rather than keep watering it.
---
Skepticism was mostly because it was forced content which was agreed to never be done and now it's been done. That was a foundation of this game, and it's been thrown away for this. That being said, this opens the door for forced PvP content that can't be brigaded by non-PvPer's. It's probably too little too late at this point to save, but it's worth a shot I suppose.

Shucks, what would you like to see?

People say to start Slayer at 70 combat stats but if you want to do it, just do it. Sticking to only Max efficiency will burn you out very quickly if you don't actually value Max efficiency.

Are you on Mobile? If so, try a different Wi-Fi network or to change to your mobile data if it doesn't help try another device or changing your password. It happens to me a lot when I leave my Wi-Fi on and my phone connects to different networks.

You're gonna be late for early milestones, but you only need to hit certain thresholds to receive rewards, and if you show any dedication at all to the competition, you're likely to be at least in the top half of players. Just try to have fun and ignore the early setback!

&gt;PvPers are like, &lt;5% of the active playerbase, while twisted leagues was meant for the majority.

Where exactly did that number come from? PvPers also have multiple accounts to PvP. PvPers are less than others for sure, but the revenue per PvPer likely exceeds the revenue per any other type of player. And yes, the PvP player base did reduce with years of our content being tampered with just to return to the original in the end.

Makes me even more sad that this community and Jagex are becoming more and more complacent with bots, accepting them and designing the game around them rather than more quickly eradicating them (if at all).

However, thousands of people were optimistic about the ranger glove thing passing (evident bc the gloves started selling for over 30m) and then the post I’m referring to got absolutely shit on and it didn’t pass the poll.
---
If range (or any gear for that matter) ever gets an upgrade in the future, most likely scenario is that they use current BiS as ingredient items to keep the old content still relevant. It’ll happen inevitably.

usiness standpoint, it doesn't make sense for jagex to devote significant time or resources to developing pvp updates. 
---
I'm coming back to OSRS from the elder scrolls online, where I put 7k+ hours into pvp. There is a very similar issue going on with that game, where the pvp players make up such a small percentage of the playerbase that ZOS (zenimax online studios) is no longer spending significant resources to balancing,  or developing new content for pvp. They have shown that the most profitable business model is to focus on the larger populations of the playerbase, such as the role players and pve fanatics  with the main goal being to bring in new players while disregarding the concerns of endgame players.
---
As long as this business model continues to be optimal, I expect this will become a trend across games where pvp isnt the main focus or selling ppint.

The ropes and the agility shortcut. The kill times are significantly reduced with the diary completion. Plus the extra two inventory slots you supplement for the ropes are nice if your stats aren't the best.

Hey, just going to respond to this one.
---
We are going to be addressing this by upping the combat level required to receive the following as a slayer assignment within the twisted league:
---
* Ankou
---
* Banshee
---
* Blue Dragon 
---
Right now they're being assigned when they're far too difficult to kill and whilst we did do a fair bit of balancing for the league, and some of these creatures "can" be killed with ranged / magic in a safe spot, we'll be hotfixing them shortly.
---
If you are below the combat level required to be assigned these as a slayer task after the hotfix has gone live, you will be able to skip your task for free and it won't impact your streak.

4t tbow with broad arrows (easily farmable) is similar dps to a 5t tbow with dragon arrows. Also should get tons of blood runes during the lance grind and RC-, using no more than 200/raid (presumably with the dps increases and time).

The initial roll for an item is based on the combined points of the raid. For this instance, the chance of receiving a unique is (63,334/8675)=7.3% chance at an item. Once the initial roll at getting a unique is done, it then choses who gets the item based on the weighted points for each person. The raid had a 7.3% chance at an item, since we rolled an item, the chance of getting that item in the persons name with 1,670 points is (1,670/63,334)*100=2.6%. After that has been done, the next calculation is the item, which in this case was chosen as a twisted bow at a 2.9% chance out of the uniques. Summary: 1) 7.3% chance at an item, 2) 2.6% chance that it’s in his name, 3) 2.9% chance that it was a twisted bow. Multiplying the three of those together, means that it’s an 11/200,000 chance that he got Twisted Bow, roughly 1/20k raids.

Actually, the fact it lets you hop between game types, like DMM and TL, without logging you out in between makes this a perk, not a bug.
---
Well said
---
I opened them for 3 specific reasons. 1. I wanted pryo set/ tome 2. I wanted pet and 3. Low level resources make the early levels much much quicker considering the XP boost
---
Wholesome exchange, no trolling or telling him to go over the ditch or anything.
---
I enjoyed getting 43 pray in an hour, but it probably is the best😂 once i get higher agility and teles it’ll hopefully be better

This is it. Rock bottom. I've been ignoring it for a long time but my opiate addiction is ruining my life.

&gt;	How does this make him a Chad? Because his account is more interesting than yours? This guy is my friend and if you actually knew anything about him, you wouldn’t say that. Why do you care how he plays? It’s his account. Smh people think they need to make fun of others even in video games
---
Not sure if sarcastic...?
---
No making fun, I just think he’s an absolute unit for maxing the hardest skills in the game one by one. This post was made out of respect and awe, not out of any negative feelings TBH
---
I've got around 800 right now. Haven't done many other things in game yet
---
A friend jokingly showed me he discovered a goldfarming website that lists its
---
Canadian address
---
Company Name
---
Company Registration number
---
Phone number
---
Where can I submit this information?  I recently saw a reddit post the other day about how Jagex is going after goldfarming websites.
---
good
---
Knives literally double in dps after the last relic, can see them being really useful
---
These are actually awesome suggestions.
---
Would the bruma torch being polled as an offhand equipment? It didn't seem to mention that in the questions...
---
Spice racks are a great idea. Makes spice gathering seem like a one time grind instead of every time you need a boost....
---
Adds up to 100% for me
---
10 double digits!
---
Two months from now
---
Yeah, the league points turn into currency for the reward store in the main game when the league ends.
---
This is a joke right
---
everyone knows this already, or at least they should ? nothing new lol.
---
People go 200m slayer without that damn jar...
---
2% does not help...
---
Big oof
---
My only objection is potentially to the arceuus teleports. I think the cost has to be *significant* if we're going to allow that, considering how expensive the tabs are. Maybe something like 4000 dark essence blocks (+ runes) per teleport? That would end up being ~10 hours of mining per teleport, which I think is fair considering how powerful something like infinite barrows teleports is.
---
Few others not already mentioned are Bedsheet (from Ghosts Ahoy, both version), Plague Jacket and Trousers, and Silverlight. Though all of them do have comparable counterparts, even if not exactly the same.
---

---
Unnatural selection is just superior. Farming speed is kind of bleh since youll be chained to your pkots instead of doing inbetween, and extra respurces are something you can bypass the need of, if you pick good slayer tasks. There are so many resources you can purely get from slayer
---
LMS controversy aside, how are you pvping on resizeable?
---
Make no wiki account. GL questing those barrow gloves!
---
Without the twitch comments aren't a personality comment I never would have gotten that this was about monkaW lol.
---
The dragonstone armors are all terrible.  
---
Option a) same shit no one likes.  
---
Option b) same shit no one likes but less details.   
---
Option c) regular rune armor with a medium helm and a few purple pixels. 
---
I honestly dont really care how it looks, im never using it regardless, but it looks horrible in every option.
---
I was gonna guess it was around a dozen
---
Because the notifications will...notify them when something happens without opening the game and yeah if you’re busy you can easily forget an hour idk what about that was unrealistic
---
Easier doesn't always mean better - think delay of gratification. Some people get enjoyment out of breezing through levels, others get enjoyment out of grinding for them. That doesn't make one form of enjoyment "better" than the other.
---
L0000l pk for 20 minutes and then go do hours of slayer.. then pk for another 30 mins..... hours of slayer, not fun :( The pouches have been buya le with gp for years.
---
What the feck is a monkaw?

meanwhile construction is still a dumpster fire of a skill

Thank you again.

BH2 was not there in times of Monkey Madness, restart your account!.. Wrong franchise, right?

A twitch emote where Pepe the Frog is looking stressed out (which is also monkaS) but zoomed in on his face.
---
Adding to the sack improvements, is it possible for the "Deposit loot" button on the bank interface to work with all of these storage sack type of items, not just the actual looting bag?
---
These are all great additions thanks!
---
No. If you want to camp revs, a low lvl pure with as high total as possible would be your best bet 
---
Def pures are good for black chins though
---
12
---
Clearly not dude. Probs has never left edge on his little cute obby mauler or lvl 50 pure ranger haha.
---
I found motivation through collection log! Try to fill it :D
---
The thing is, with questions like these, people are going to be voting yes, not because they _want_ to see the interface updated, but because they have no reason to vote no. It's a "why not?" question, which when having to be defended with "to keep it unique" means it's going to pass regardless, which is pretty sad.
---
i mean spam planting limps would be pretty insanely broken no?
---
Disappointing
---
Not available for UIM, fixed just for you :)
---
It’s nog that many points right?
---
It seemed right to repoll given the the extremely close margin last time plus the recent demand for the reasons you describe. If it fails again, I could see it being one of the things revisited when we have a renewed approach to polling PvP content since this affects PvP more than PvM.
---
Omanything outside of hunting defensless people?
---
Noted :)
---
Imagine calling yourself out for using illegal plug ins lmfao
---
These are all great suggestions and improvements. I’ll be voting yes on the majority, if not all, of them
---
Doing 600 Beginner clues for only an 5 second emote is pretty boring tbh. (if its the same emote as in rs3) Just imo.
---
Jesus, Minotaur looks like me squatting above my chair after a long session
---
My turn to repost next week m8
---
This is mambo no. 5
---
That would have been nice while grinding vorkath, almost every trip would have been 1 kill longer
---
Won’t their prices be quite high if they’re a limited item?
---
I fail to see how you can’t see how a busy adult who is squeezing in a few mins of gaming between tasks at work and then coming home to take care of family and being busy there too has no excuse. 
---
I’d love to relive my early 20s and teens being able to scape all damn day but unfortunately I have real life to deal with now which reflects my scrub levels of &lt;1500 total.
---
Everyone and their nan understood he meant it as it's his favourite game
---
Oh right, I was thinking that you needed to combine Hydra leather and Bgloves to make Ferocious; that was polled but failed. I truly don’t think ranged needs buffs with our current gear tiers/combat triangle, but if they do ever poll a BiS ranged glove again, I will not vote yes unless they intend to lock it behind a new *real* master/grandmaster quest (looking at you, Fremmenik Exiles).
---
I'm not sure how it happens, but I've seen it happen a few times whilst doing leagues too on various skills. I think it's when you get multiple levels within a second or something it doubles the message but only displays one number
---
But I have no friends :v
---
Could u make it look similiar to the current theme? Thats why im opposed to it. The screen is iconic and 99.9% of people dont buy runes from it so this update isnt helpful.
---
Late game I expect the accumulator to do some serious work dps wise, but endless endurance is always really useful
---
80% like running 17% like shooting 3% like praying
---
Please for the love of god let prayer reorders happen. I still don't know why people said no to this in the first place.
---
No 3rd party client will ever be “safe” in terms of your information. But when it comes to plug ins, Runelite has been confirmed to be complying with Jagex and everything currently available in the client it within the game rules
---
Regarding the Arceuss/Weiss teleports availability in the PoH. I beg you not to do this, currently we rely far to much on the PoH to do anything, once you reach a certain level you’re spending a large amount of time just teleporting you’re your PoH over and over.
---
It’s not enjoyable and I it’s a bad design choice. You have even said on stream that players rely far to much on the PoH.
---
Is it possible to get a perm for autoclicker? I think I may have used it like a couple of times (maybe 4 or 5)  for simple things like cutting wood. Now after a half year of not playing i see my account has a perma ban slapped onto it, is it because of this or did I get hacked and someone do a real macro on my acc?
---
lol

‘I’m just holding them for a friend’

how is it a straw man, both have the exact same impact on time saved

its not something way more broken that obviously shouldn't exist, its just a parallel

I thought twisted league was going to be shit but I'm having alot of fun with it. Shout out the the jmod team

It’s only overpowered if a select group gets is and the rest don’t. If everyone gets the tool in the default client no one gets and advantage over someone else .
---
You should probably make it into a view only document and not so that everyone can edit it, because anyone can go into the document right now and just delete everything. Make it into a view only shared document so that one has to make a copy to their own drive in order to edit it.
---
ye, "easier" updates are for sure worse for long term health.
---
I mean, wouldn't want the game to die off by "easier" updates like left clicking to bank without a 3rd party client
---
Ty Mr. ATF
---
Can you consider making the empty light orbs notable? Currently they are the only glass you can blow but not note. I think the 87 crafting requirement already balances out their 70xp each. If noting to sell to a shop seems like too much money, maybe you could also consider decreases the high alch value of them?
---
Red Dragons in Forthos dungeon sound pretty meta. Once you unlock the full power of the altar (Sacred Bone Burner) that’s there you’ll get x3 for each bone offered to it, making it x15 prayer overall. Given the huge usefulness and limited mobility options in Zeah plus it’s huge landscape, I think endurance was definitely the way to go. :)
---
oh wow, great analogy, that's exactly right. Killing a slayer monster(how you get every slayer helmet) is the same thing as playing an entirely different game mode on a different character.
---
Barrows gloves give +12 defense in all stats except magic which is a +6, where ferocious gloves give +0 defense in all stats. Did you even attempt to do research before responding to me?
---
The truth is none of them matter, they will both disapear one day. One of them on a known date and the other not.
---
Spend your time enjoying the game and not wondering if it was worth it. You arent investing in a business, you are playing a game. I understand wanting to be efficient with your play time ingame, bankstanding when you can play 2 hours a day is really not something I'd want to do either but playing Main game or Twisted league is not a waste of time. Just choose what you want to do the most and do it.
---
I've got a main, I've got an iron, I play twisted leagues and i'm picking up pokemon Sword tonite. Guess what? I'm only going to play my twisted league account right now, until I get bored. Why? Because it is finite. That experience will disapear one day and I won't get to play it again the way it is now. Why should I care that my main didn't get 500k slayer xp today? He can get it tomorow.
---
Put them on your feet in lieu of boots. No reason why you can't cram them toes in there.
---
In solos if you do helm, BCP, and prim take offs in typical solo gear you'll be left with 61 mage bonus. You'll have ancestral bottoms, kodai, infernal cape, torture, barrows gloves and ely left on. Maybe a good idea would be to make the accuracy scale to 100% if you do all three take offs or use a fury/occult rather than torture? I'd recommend getting some input from people who do consistent solos though, but that's the kind of scaling I think would appropriate. I think the halved spawn rates for dodging the blood is plenty.
---
Thanks for taking the time to look into it. I know quite a few solo steamers are very vocal about maiden, hopefully they can chip in (a cold one and chriskies come to mind).
---
Ok I changed it to view only, are people able to make a copy by default now or there another setting I need to allow for that?
---
I am at work right now and nothing matters. I just want to barb fish!
---
If you have to sacrifice a piece of graceful to "imbue" your fashionscape, i don't see why not?  in a setup like that you still had to grind it out and work for it.  Personally i'd love it, it gets a little old seeing "gracefulscape" everywhere sometimes.
---
Ah yea sorry, I was thinking of the smoke devil dungeon, forgot they are different.
---
Yes! He even had a conversation with the other knight about how their day was going. Something along the lines of "Oh you know, hundreds of people shoving their hands in my ass all day". He's a gem.
---
Should be "trying to get the smithing day record"
---
What about dragon weapons from elite clues?
---
Any planks to unlock them or do we consider them as alchables?
---
No I enjoy the frequent connection lost and lag, it's a very nostalgic part of RS and I wouldn't be surprised if that's a major reason why Jagex will not fix the servers.
---
You just need to enable export option in the share tab https://i.imgur.com/jcZ7KGB.png
---
Knowing how it works you probably shouldve planned ahead lol
---
Sounds exciting if it is true, i look forward dying a hundred times to ice prison.
---
Sure, but you spent time chopping them during the last game where you could have been burning them.
---
[Framed] Pretending to be an Ardy Knight in PVP worlds (BANK WAS MADE)

The extra work to deal with 1.5s delays on 330 and having to reenter houses isnt worth saving a tiny bit of gp on tabs
---
Would love to see tour take on Hobgoblins, ice/moss giants/ and nechs as I feel their character’s leave a lot to be desired
---
It'd possibly be nice for Farming Contracts. I'd rather not wait a full herb growth cycle and would happily sacrifice one seed to correct the error. 
---
On the flip side, still having to wait up to 20 minutes kinda kills the usefulness.
---
What's the point of polling features again and again?  
---
It was already not voted in to the game, it just smells like a JMod got too used to reordered prayers and now it will be polled until it passes.
---
lore. good one
---
Just like you guys polled if we even wanted twisted league or not :D
---
It's not about the difficulty, it's about the high amount of rng involved. I wouldn't really complain if they just made it consistent.
---
I mean duh... Which part of this post did you interpret as me demanding the game adapt to me? The part in which I discussed my perspective on the proposed changes? Or the part in which I said I myself wasn't sure whether I would vote for those changes?
---
I am hoping for never.
---
ironscape cba
---
OSRS vs RS3
---
Zulrah has high skill requirements already. It’s not like it will continue to take up a bunch of dev time once the requirement is put in place.
---
I think I replied to the wrong comment, sorry
---
I feel like this should be buffed, even if no one still uses it.  2% is a joke.  Even 10% would still be a joke but at least make a noticeable difference.
---
Yes you’ll never have to do a quest more than once and it’s so worth it in the end. I HATE question but Somehow I’ve got 220 QP
---
As someone has 0 pets I support this. Let people show of their achievements as pioneers of getting a pet.

Guy did this to me on twisted league, i did it to him next time they respawned. He said "have you read the posts about ragging?? Im recording you lmao"
---
My best buddy &amp; roomate is a 1st year resident. name: TraumaDPM

Perfect, updated. Thanks for the quick help mate!

I'm not opposed to the game mechanic itself, I just think that the relic is misleading right now.
---

---
Prolly because everyone complained it was boring lol, Reddit can never be happy
---
&gt; I could see it being one of the things revisited when we have a renewed approach to polling PvP content since this affects PvP more than PvM.
---
How did you measure that?  
---
Of course someone tribridding is going to switch more than someone doing AFK Slayer, but there's a good amount of prayer switching in a single COX run.
---
You know theres an issue when theres a plow metagame.
---
I just recently finished 99 mining and let me tell you....IT IS WORTH IT. It was extremely rewarding as the grind made me stop playing for months at a time 3 times. Just stick with it!
---
It's the transparency in the interface that makes it even nicer
---
No, the timing of the screenshot was perfect, that was just coincidence
---
the game massively adapts to iron men what are you talking about
---
I'm only playing about 2-5 hrs a day as well, and don't even play normal osrs anymore. Just treating it like diablo seasons, which I enjoyed.
---
all good hombre
---
Just run past them. They cant get you in the red dragon room
---
Choices have consequences. should have thought it through first
---
Could just drop trade it over to your main. No need to de-iron.
---
got some good magic xp and money tho right.
---
I'd probably use it on herb runs so I can get some extra energy while putting my Ardougne cloak on my back instead of in-inventory.
---
np
---
Especially with EVEN MORE polled POH teleports.  
---
This is from the same couch that talks about the POH being overpowered every single week and yet they want to add more to it.
---
As ferragamo said, what makes it op is that its an advantage to those using that client over someone who isnt, thats how stuff being op works, gives an advantage to someone using it over someone whos not, if everyone has access to it then it ceases to be op because it levels the playing field
---
Yeah, thought about that one. But both of them saves you from using and making pots if you cba to do that.
---
It would be interesting if some leagues had slightly weaker relics but more tiers to unlock to add more variety to what sort of "relic build" you can make.
---
With how unnecessarily wide and empty Zeah is, it already seems deforested tbh.
---
It's slightly better than MLM but you have to consistently click once every few seconds
---
I'd recommend learning Volcanic Mine if you want afk. Once you learn how to do it, you can afk for 3+ minutes at a time, and it's over double the exp of MLM
---
Recoloring Phoenix is the only thing I've ever wanted. Yes please!
---
On the topic of pet transmogs, and in light of the sire updates coming soon, what are the chances of a transmog to the orginal sire pet model of the spawn from the boss fight? I feel if any transmogs were to be added, this would be among the ones that would make most sense.
---
How does requiring an emblem to get points kill bots?
---
Only one I'm voting against is the infinite spice jars. I would massively prefer the POH spice rack. Such a horrible shame it's being polled this way.
---
talking about "fixing" graceful set can we also get a buffed version like agile pieces from pre eoc for like 80 agility or something?
---
you can smoke the traps 0 time, so you dont lose anything really, but its just not worth the effort
---
I'm hoping at least 75% of people feel the same. Adding new teleports to the POH is always a game improvement.
---
You what
---
The question is worded in a rather confusing way. It should say "each piece will give roughly 3% increased run energy restoration, with a 10% bonus for wearing the full set, matching the 30% the full set currently gives."
---
All good. And have a nice weekend sir.
---
Yeah its possible after 800 hours of soul runes.
---
Now do you want to do the math on the 200mill smithing one?
---
What a fucking awful motto. I hope you don’t extend that to your politics and just have that sadomasochism for runescape.
---
And don't forget the most important part. Dedicated servers. It's fucking amazing playing near 0 lag games in 8 player.
---
I appreciate the way it was polled as well. I thought it would devalue my Agility cape when I first started reading that question.
---
Because his argument was that an update that makes you open less interfaces is good because who cares about opening interfaces
---
so i made a separate suggestion of a different update that would also cut the interfaces you have to open in half as a comparison
---
the point is that just making you have to open less interfaces isnt inherently good
---
🤔
---
POH spice rack is good and flavorful 🥁
---
Is it possible to purchase more than one set of twisted horns?
---
Can we get a fucking coin pouch?
---
Thankfully UIM is dead gamemode making up a miniscule % of community. 
---
Calling these massive buffs is MASSIVELY OTT, yes they save an invy spot for very specific activities, but in the grander scale of things it's not even a scratch.
---
Wholesome 100, sneak 100, speech 100 because your comment was epic, I'd give you gold if mommy gave me my allowance
---
just click the desk and not the banker. no need for a 3rdparty client...
---
This is a great list. I've made sure the suggestions reached the backlog for consideration in future poll - sorry they didn't make it into this round.
---
If you have enough points then yes!
---
Yeah i get that it's a large departure from the update mentality for like, the last decade. But i really do think the games economy and concept (open MMORPG with a lot of skills) is a lot better suited for such design, allowing players to specialize and be dependant upon eachother - with "noone" being good at everything.  
---
We are moving towards a generalist scape where the "boring" content will get easier so people can do endgame PvM which feeds itself the resources it needs so the rest of the economy is irrelevant, so doubt this matters much now.
---
That’s the only downfall is the dot. But if there are hundreds of dots it’s easier to blend in 😂
---
One for me and one for the highest bidder then!
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
Ikr, I was greedy D:
---
Right? It’s a meme L0L
---
there is new twisted league game mode where you start on fresh ironman account. 
---
At the start you have to pick 1 of 3 reclis, 
---
- take endless endurance and you never lose run energy when running
---
- take abyssal acumulator and save 85% of arrows/runes
---
- rake dark altar devotion and you get 4x prayer xp and bones are automatically buried
---
I did this about a week ago and got 80k defence exp before realizing I wasnt killing the right dudes.
---
I couldn't even be mad though because dust devil drops arent even that bad and I got 80k defence exp off of it.
---
That's what i like. Zulrah was just a normal small snake as a baby but grows up to this huge thing
---
I'm not really a fan of alternate gamemodes pulling resources off the main game, but the Twisted League already seems like it's paying off big time. It's been a huge community boost that has nothing to do with PVP.
---
Why block greaters? A full task takes less than an hour long and you get pretty good exp off them.
---
With fairy rings, they are right next to one so easy access too.
---
98-99 you mean?
---
How do you have an ironman if you think 2k total makes you a no lifer
---
Nope, gotten make do with that rune scim for a while :p
---
Here's a random picture of me killing hellhounds
---
Accumulator 25%
---
Endurance 70%
---
Altar 5%
---
fuck off, latrine
---
Or not lol
---
What's your source on 6k points for helm...? Blog post doesn't show amount of points necessary for the rewards. I'd like to play just enough to get one or two rewards, but without clear numbers I'm unsure if I'll get far enough
---
Yeah fuck making me constantly use necklaces of passage for clues smh
---
Why is it rs3 armour
---
Alter gang woop woop
---
What a nutty gear setup, god damn.
---
Hurrr I'm so good at things why aren't you??
---
Oh you replaced the battery on your Mac? Our warranty doesn't cover PCs, sorry.
---
Why won't they poll to change trimmed skill capes? They shouldn't trim themselves anymore, trimming your untrimmed capes would be done by using them on the relevant master NPC, and players would be able to continue buying untrimmed skill capes for their first 99.
---
Knowing them though, there's no character flag or anything to remember it for older accounts, since they went with this clunky trim method instead
---
Jesus, im 1181 solos in and only had 1 kodai. Gz bro, respect rhe rng.
---
Prayer Reordering is the only thing I have longed for since it was removed from Runelite. Letting someone re-order gives some customization and player comfort. It would only help.
---
If you took C and gave it B’s head, it’d be perfect.
---
A lot of players can't make out the difference between EZScape and cutting down on the tedium that stacks up over time.
---
Here are some ideas I thought of while waiting for a plane to take off:
---
* Ironman + Doing a skill will not give you exp in that skill, but to the one to the right of it (wrap around, so smithing would be the only way to get defense exp)
---
* UIM + No teleports allowed, except for stuff like paying for boats
---
* All enemies have special attacks, hit twice as fast, and hit twice as hard.  Everyone is hardcore ironman and you lose all points that haven't been cashed out for relica upon death.
---
* 4 person group Ironman + divide the world into 4 parts, each person can only go to each part
---
* DMM ironman 
---
* You start at 99 all skills and anything that *would* gain you exp causes you to lose exp.  The goal being to get to level 1.  
---
It's really not hard to come up with ideas that aren't area restrictions.  I'm sure a company can spend a few hours in the board room and come up with really good ideas.
---
Again, you don't need the full graceful effect for 99% of cases. This is going around full circle. People can fashionscape perfectly fine with 5 pieces of graceful. Even if they did implement this, people would still be wearing most of the graceful pieces at zeah. Read original post I replied to for more reasons I don't think it should go through.
---
Reminds me of the time I killed Jad for 400 hours before finally realizing my task was 12 jellys.
---
I hope she wont chop my log D:
---
&gt; On the other hand, the GE already fundamentally destroyed the community aspect of OSRS by creating nothing but ghost towns and empty roads. As someone said in their video on why they dislike the GE, almost every player's "state of idleness" is now centered around the GE, and never leaving without already having a goal in mind.
---
&gt; 
---
That's just not true though.  
---
Most cities on the mainland has a lot of uses and their banks gets used a lot.
---
&gt;I don't see how adding some more teleports could possibly make things even worse. Might as well just embrace the easier travel in my opinion.
---
Jagex themselves have often talked about how overpowered the POH is, now they want to make it even more overpowered, it's just so weird.
---
Yeah, I think the arceus teleports should probably be polled individually
---
I liked the meme. It's not about polling something to make the game harder, the whole point of playing restricted modes is to make the game harder
---
Fuckin got em
---
The game should not be balanced around ironmen.
---
Honestly did some lms yesterday, it’s not even a good money maker with all the bots. Took me over an hour to get 53 points (enough for 1 parchment and 1 teleport) only made 730k in about 80 minutes. The parchment has crashed because of the bots. 
---
Also the time restriction,not the skill restriction, did lock me out of bh on my low level gmaul pure I made with the twitch prime sub. Guess I’ll just have to afk at sandcrabs for 10 more hours.
---
I dont believe the rates have been changed at all for the leagues.
---
Thanks! Just out of curiosity how many prayer potions and antivenoms do you take? Just one each for 2-3 kills?
---
I see where you're trying to come from but honestly that seems extreme. Infinite barrows teleport is powerful if you're an ironman that just kind of skipped doing barrows until you could make that portal and you want to just plow through it. As a main account though infinite barrows teleport is nothing. 10 hours of Zulrah (or anything comparable) and I can quite literally just buy every single barrows item and never even go there. I think you're overestimating how worthwhile barrows is to do to begin with
---
Should be an integrity change to be honest. Especially considering the thousands of people using RuneLite forks that already use this feature undetected in the first place.
---
I miss HD OSRS. Ngl, I'd pay $10-$20 for OSRS in HD.
---
Wait wtf is that cursor doing there?
---
I will vote yes for all of these items just to see how triggered your kind gets from changes that actually make gameplay more enjoyable. 
---
Self entitled comment. And from a pleb. Yikes.
---
As long as there's no EOC, i'm down.
---
You didn’t fight a single person from RoT?
---
lmao analysing a joke.  chill out mate.
---
Really? in world 400 they felt on par, maybe a little faster than regular ones on the wintertodt world. prob the people with hardcore harvester carrying a lot of the weight from the low wc levels and bronze axes
---
The photo was saved to a computer and my dad sent it to me with his cursor over it.
---
Probably because they serve a similar purpose and if one is implemented, the dev work required for the other will not be worth it given the marginal added utility.
---
Doctor's Gown aswell, from biohazard? Quest.
---
Yes, that's true. Have fun doing less than ten raids with staminas over the entire two month League.
---
The objective is to receive one skilling pet not all of them you can't even get them all on Zeah
---
Really? What?
---
Do you mind elaborating a little for someone who hasn't used a lot of Kourend. Is there an altar that works similarly to gilded altars? And when you say brimstone (I know that one) and spider dungeon keys what do you mean?
---
relick my balls
---
Everyone plays a Great Kourend locked ironman with 5x exp rates and there are these relics that give you powers that you can buy with points by hitting certain achievements (mostly levels in skill)
---
And then at the end you can get some prizes for your main or for the next season
---
&gt;especially when 3rd party clients will make that right click into shift+left click on day 2 of the update
---
I think you meant first 5 minutes of the update since most RuneLite forks have custom menu swapping.
---
Also really aren't good xp like he claims, not compared to the good tasks at least.
---
I’ve honestly not done any twisted leagues. This was an assumption I made based off DVS’s video. The XP rates are obviously inflated,  but he said he was averaging over 1k points a game at Todt, which is a quite a bit.
---
Just for looks is good I’d pay for it
---
Grats! I got mine in 4 as well because I wasn’t using the full screen mode so I had trouble seeing Jad’s movements lol. Probably a little nervousness in there too
---
Try the Twitter support account. It's usually pretty responsive and sorts out tons of dilemmas. Good luck, mate :/
---
Always. Yep.
---
18
---
The most recent blogs reward section has a point cost for each reward.
---
No they wont have to, not if they do the clue thing like they did for Zeah
---
Gold!
---
Yikes
---
Where did I say that it should? Is giving my opinion now tantamount to a demand that the game should be altered solely for my benefit?
---
Choosing to be a UIM makes the game harder
---
Incredible attention to detail man, this is awesome.
---
&gt; I will vote yes for all of these items just to see how triggered your kind gets from changes that actually make gameplay more enjoyable.
---
Ebic and very valid reason to vote yes.
---
What? The MTA store looks awful.
---
When iron men say they they can get you banned for it and that they are filming you😂, fucking freaks
---
It’s okay to want a pet &lt;3
---
Yeah i'm not sure why you wouldn't just plant your best stuff and choose the contracts as you harvest, i still agree that it is misleading though.
---
imagine being dead and people make memes about your death. Smfh.
---
I got my having 20% favour with the military dudes. That unlocks the weapon/armour shop and its sold there for 20gp
---
That's the joke
---
Lame
---
I feel like there is a sizable amount of the playerbase who actually only wanted Pre-EOC scape in the first place.
---
I think the change makes sense. People nitpick the weirdest shit about this game
---
Yeah, pretty sure meta would be to just plant every patch you have access to and then claim a contract for every one, then replant all and repeat at your leisure depending on how focused you are on farming.
---
This shouldn't have any impact at all.
---
One kick rick series was great because it parodied area restricted accounts right when swampletics was really kicking off. His content for me has fallen off a bit, but he’s still got a charming sense of humour.
---
Ha.....only double....
---
*inhales*
---
**DID YOU GUYS ACTUALLY NOT 1-TICK FLICK BANG JAD WITHOUT FOOD OR PRAYER? YOU SUCK AT THIS GAME LMAO**
---
If you're ironman everything is untradable
---
he’s not a king he’s a knight did you read the post?
---
Haha what would that do for yours?
---
Well it hit the FP so its working
---
34x
---
And where will you get the torstol is there a easy way, or do you have to Rush farming?
---
Just realized I’m 51 attack.... still worth the maul route?
---
yea no way, i've been saving mine up from lvl 1, sitting at 89 with more than you.
---
This ad was paid for by #EnduranceGang
---
Yeah nobody is really talking about it but i expect to see some players burn out after this mode, not only because what they did gets erased (except rewards) but also because the game will feels very slow after.
---
Riot the company that owns league of legends actually talked once about how urf mode (a super fast league experience, no resource use, loads of ability spam and speed) made players quit league after the mode was gonne.
---
You're right there is no flag. They've answered this about two thousand times.
---
Go to this link. This is the only way to get your account looked at that actually works.
---

---
I guess you can get magic seeds now?
---
60 att then.
---
Nope
---
: O f2p?
---
300 iq
---
It’s irrelevant at this point. I know I got hacked, could be my own fault from some inadvertent reason, but that isn’t the problem. I secured my account fully directly after this happened, and was banned to no fault of my own because of the actions that weren’t done by me. Sucks that I got hacked and I could’ve prevented it with more security on my account. But now I’m about damage control for punishment of things I didn’t do.
---
No, only for NPC based interactions. I.e. demonic gorillas special attack of throwing a rock at you. The plugins are not allowed to tell you where the rock will land, indicating you should move to any tile other than the highlighted one. Tile markers for cannon placement are not classed under that stipulation.
---
So everyone should just refer to your judgement then?
---
But my point is that you already save roughly that much ammo if you pick it up
---
Did she know what you were talking about? lol
---
Seeing as his the Odd Old Man maybe rather than paying him, have him request Odd items for the upgrade?
---
Say 10 rune bars, 10 eggs, 1 dragon dragger, 5 ropes? You get the idea!
---
Well when you’ve got thousands of people skilling all at the same time it’s bound to happen a lot.
---
Hate to tell you, but that’s how stereotypes and the internet work. I’ve personally never run into this with an IM, but I know why people feel this way.
---
My one goal is maxing and I picked run because it makes a massive difference in a lot of skills.
---
Prayer will be easy
---
By literally an experiment gone wrong, i mean that Jagex essentially released a printing press for money available to all players, thus the cash snake was born.   
---
Actual lore &gt; ingame lore
---
THE SAME JOKE IS ON THE FRONT PAGE AGAIN LOL
---
Not a goal I'm working towards. I'll have untrimmed HP cape first at the rate I'm getting XP in things.
---
Rigour is available
---
She had no clue.
---
my friend didn't get it until 51 kc. Nah you ain't doin anything wrong, you'll get it.
---
\^You have a point and that is also a problem with 3pc which doesn't just make the ingame progress faster but also does the logic for the player.
---
Unfair advantages :0
---
Apparently there’s something similar to a gilded altar in some dungeon on zeah.
---
Actually yes that makes more sense, some unknown weirdo was printing money then a snake jumped in the printing press and bam zulrah was born
---
Ever heard of a prntscr before
---
ok, explain how you will sustain prayer with 2 herb patches without dark altar.  Or how you will train slayer without prayer or tank armour.  Also feel free to ignore the FREE bone burying and rapid prayer xp, especially in catacombs, where you can AFK.
---
That’s not what I’m saying in the slightest.
---
I don’t think you understand bh lol
---
A friend
---
&gt;fake news, sad.
---
Terrible comment, yikes.
---
I don't think it's crazy at all! I think you're right!
---
（。々°）
---
Heyghhy is g I got
---
"I'll take it"
---
You sir are the lowest of scum.
---
It's a good thing they don't cater all content to a very limited game mode with a very very limited player base.
---
Of course you know why, you've never met anyone like this but the internet said they are
---
Very nice, I plan on voting yes to just about everything here. Thanks for this!
---
I
---
It’s called Roleplaying, you uncultured swine.
---
If I could turn it on and off I would have chosen other relics, so this update would be quite unfair
---
Dw i won't it will also be ornated to flex on the regular jewelry plebs
---
Mklake a new account and do it again
---
Will the Arceuus/Weiss teleports be made available for the regular POH portals as well or just the portal nexus?
---
Not until the main God trio are renamed to Paul, Ian and Andrew.
---
yea i'll overtake hp xp with slayer at around 11mil at my current rates, should make for a fairly easy untrim. It is gonna cost me a small fortune in cannonballs, but since i do all my hellhound tasks at cerb money  isnt really an issue.
---
Yes. Runelite remains Master Race.
---
This update would help non-ironman accounts a great deal and wasn't the argument always that they aren't going to limit updates because it helps a limited game mode. Almost everything in this update would also help mains just as much as it helps irons.
---
You wanna post this again?
---
Hell yeah. Just ditch the karam cuz they werent meta tbh
---
Their whole marketing stict is based around the game looking like you remember it as a kid.
---
Ahhhhhhh thank you I haven’t ever been in that shop so it makes sense I missed it
---
Why thank you for addressing me as "sir", that's the nicest thing anybodys said to me all week.
---
Thanks, have they removed the banned plugins or do i have to turn something off?
---
Showerthought:  Osrs is group Ironman but with all players except for rs3 players.
---
Search tz in ge is best way to find it (toktz-xil? Maybe)
---
Sanctimonious? Lose two friends and three family members to this addiction and then try laughing it off. Asshole.
---
I'm not sure that's legal
---
I've honestly lost interested in my normal account at this point. Would much rather focus on new exciting things in league than same old grind in the normal game.
---
She can give back to back tasks if you have slayer cape on.
---
Noooooice
---
You can plant a wrong seed if you finish a farming contract and you get an herb contract but you just planted one. I once had to dig up a fruit tree because of having to lower the contract so I would be in favor of this. For some reason you currently can't dig up an herb, your character says "why would I want to dig this up?".
---
Really? I checked on the wiki since I was unsure, but saw no mention of reclaiming or where. I'll have to look into that.
---
They already are self handicapping themselves...???
---
And the prayer one reduces prayer usage rates.
---
By whom? No1 has responded with anything substantial. I am still waiting, lol.
---
 You can get noted dragon bones from dragon implings.
---
Because he has... Maxed melee stats? Something that doesn't take long at all and you can get just asking nmz?
---
It was, and makes sense; everyone chooses their first relics there.
---
I’ve been skilling mostly for the last couple of months so I didn’t realize prayer reorder was removed from runelite, sir if you bring reorder to osrs I would give you well no I have no gold but I would offer to do quests for people free of charge.. love me some quests.... and diaries... and clues...
---
*teleports behind you*
---
F
---
Everyone with 70 magic and desert treasure done can get free 99 magic then
---
If you make profit while bursting those
---
You didn't type a real sentence there
---
the no-relic restricted ironmen ofc
---
Haha dude that was an EPIC CLAPBACK! You sure showed him! You said he didn't have any friends! HAHA dude! Your insults are sick bro!
---
So if you get devotion t1 relic, combat t3 relic, and exp t5 relic you will get 16 times regular prayer xp? That should be 5760 per dragon kill
---
wood please
---
swamp man good
---
I love how they need to come up with things like this to make certain demographics feel better about buying their product. A lot of tiptoeing around the issue because they can't just write 'extra small'.
---
I was catching maybe ~1000 fish an hour. You can catch way more if you try harder
---
I'm just going to assume i'll find the natures and laws from monster drops.
---
Sure, but once you get 99 prayer...that's it. The relic ceases having any use. The only use after 99 prayer is, as you said, if you combo it. 
---
The ammo one is....interesting. I suppose since we all are irons, it does save a bit of time grinding bolts / arrows, which is permanently useful. I will agree there, but I still value being able to run forever in CoX over ammo being slightly less annoying.
---
He forgot to mention the 4x as applied on top of existing xp boosts and the other two effects of double ensouled heads and 1/2 drain rate for prayer.
---
I didn't know how long it was going to go for, so I picked the arrow one. Now I wish I got the running one because I really want to try to grind out 99rc somehow someway
---
&gt; But the runaway winner (by multiplier) was Toothy's Pickaxes
---
Q: Is that pickaxe shop locked behind 15% Lovakengj favour? The *Twisted League/Guide/Mining" page says so, but the '2Toothy's Pickaxes" page doesn't mention anything.
---
Inb4 "just go to a league world and check yourself"
---
&gt;a certain bit of the IM community [...]
---
Not really lol. I've never met an IM that thought they were better than anyone else, just complain about being crashed (which is more than understandable).
---
It's the same thing with everyone here reeing about being like teamed by 20+ people in the wild with smite and d spears, when that VERY, VERY RARELY happens. It's a meme.
---
I don't think that version was ever offered or polled, but it was suggested a lot. I think they went right from no reqs to the system that passed.
---
Personally, while I do agree that ranged is strong, I wouldn't outright oppose new Ranged items. It depends on how they are balanced more than what combat style they are for. I think it is a bit silly if you take it so far as ranged should never have any new items, even if it is just +1-3 Atk bonus over current BiS, just because it is the strongest style. Back in the day, Melee was the strongest and it still got tons of updates. Though it would be nice if the other styles could better rival ranged before it gets further buffs, but chances are they won't nerf the Ranged weapons, which are the main issue, so never allowing any new gloves or such seems a tad extreme. I'd especially hate to see if Raids 3 or such offers say level 80 armors for all styles but the Ranged armor fails because "ranged is already too strong"; not releasing all the armors at once would likely be more harmful to long term balance.
---
I'm saying I don't have any friends...
---
Too loose, it slipped off in my hand
---
His friend's in his room about to make love genius
---
&gt;I think something that would be interesting bff QOL change is to be able to not rely on ice gloves for blast furnace
---
I'm big against this. It would be a major buff particularly for those making gold bars as you need to pay 0% attention, and make graceful even more powerful since you get the full effect now.
---
Again, this is how the community works! I have not experienced it myself, and I actually find most IM I encounter enjoyable.
---
thats why i do fishing first before picking my second relic.
---
ooo a good workaround right there didn't think about that one
---
gz! how long did 99 str take with 1 att and 10 hp?
---
His suggestion literally makes it even easier to do gold bars. You sacrifice one inventory slot (and you get 10 kg heavier), and in return you don't have to bother with a glove switch + having to delay retrieving the bars + 0 risk of switching gloves prematurely.
---
You can argue by watching the paint dry you can ensure there is a closer to perfect end product. Being able to see imperfections, bugs landing and dieing on the wall, or any other minimal defect could be fixed right away.
---
When the benefit is a less clunky game only dipshits vote no.
---
Your prayer still drains with prayer flicking lol
---
I bet you're great at parties
---
untasteful for you to assume that i am even real
---
How are you getting "nearly" 500k off a task? Wiki's listing their average drop at a little over 610 coins, and that's including a lot of drops probably not worth picking up and selling. Unless your tasks are a thousand demons long, you're not getting half a mill.
---
Are you counting clue scroll drops? Lots of creatures could drop you a hard clue at the same rate *and* give you better drops in between.
---
nope. you cna basically auto retaliate with a bp thru caves.
---
Pre eoc servers please. (minus terrible graphics rework)
---

---
I don’t know man that’s pretty gay
---
Double ensouled heads boyyyyy
---
Why weren’t you?
---
I've personally reclaimed the bedsheet after the quest, the innkeeper will just give you another one
---
its possible. especially on a fresh account, especially for something other than alches/teleports/nmz.
---
i dont get how you could autoclick woodcutting though.
---
If ur rings arent imbued you might as well wear brimstone ring
---
right?  Endurance eliminates agility too essentially
---
Gz dude, you and that other guy were in your own private competition it looks like 😂
---
It's not as consistent is the thing. You kinda have to already like be able ton"feel" the game ticks go by when watching the animstions to be able to consistently do that.
---
Once you're going with 1 tick it's all about keeping it up which can be nicer is different ways.
---
I’d buy one
---
#2 will still won despite looking like it was ripped directly from rs3
---
Ok so even with previous polls on similar content stating both normal portals and Nexus portals you still want to add you own stipulations and assumptions in.
---
Tell me what negative effects you think this would have on the game if they were added to normal portals. A 750k gp per hour method makes even less money making barrows tablets? Any noob doing barrows runs is already using the tablets so they aren't getting faster completions and would only be saving roughly 2k per trip as a barrows tab would be replaced with a house tab.
---
Even in your made up scenario it is much more beneficial than harmful.
---
I think you're just having a fit for no reason.
---
I agree :-D
---
i mean if you allow autoclicking you can pretty much automate the entire game.thats not a real excuse, mouse keys, alternative keyboards, food pedals etc all exist
---
Yes but u get some agility with barb fishing so not that bad
---
the endurace relic is for skilling and questing, the prayer relic is to reach mid game fast, the accumulator relic is for only combat. as far as i see it, prayer gang rise up
---
Cute stats UwU
---
Well fuck, thanks i didn't know thats why :p
---
Imagine walking LMAO
---
I remember the first sdmm, we went around as Zeah patrol killing everyone. My friend got a dragon warhammer then went 12k dry on his ironman. Good times.
---
You get rewards for your main character based on your placing in the league.
---
How do you set that?
---
A lot of people like the current armors. I especially love the blue and white ones, and how it looks woth the def cape. They redesigned them in rs3 and it looks really bad...
---
Nice try Mod Wolf
---
Man that shits whack
---
They are hotfixing that soon. Keep your eye peeled for the post about it.
---
Hold up.
---
You get damage boost on momma mutta with dhcb?
---
This is gold
---
I'd love for that to be a separate game so all you 2011scapers stop screwing up the game I love.
---
when its done you can use points earned to purchase cosmic tradeable rewards.
---
its 3 outfits (same outfit, 3 different trims), POH walls, home teleport, banner, slayer helm recolor.
---
And based on how you rank you get a trophy thats untradeable.
---
I know this entire poll is a bunch of small QoL stuff, but it’s gotta be hands down my favorite poll of all time.
---
Yeah, I only won because I had tier 3 relic and he didn't. Came super close.
---
I havent played twisted and dont care about any of the content/rewards
---
But the banter here is glorious
---
r/karmaroulette
---
Thanks :3
---
Imagine having infinite run energy and 4x hp regen at all times, is that a dream?
---
OwO hot
---
dude, just do arceuus library for rc xp, save your lamps for something harder to train
---
The prayer relic is mostly for people who want to afk &amp; chill and don't want to pray flick imo
---
:D
---
What do you mean rewards could fetch a good price on the GE? Twisted league is Ironman kourend only? I’m confused.
---
Arceuus spellbook doesn't have enough uses already, this will just make it worse. I already said that before. I will concede that the money making thing doesn't matter but I just think they should increase the use of Arceuus spellbook not push it further to the sidelines.
---
Depends on your goals. If you want to max (and yes, a lot of people want to max) dark altar devotion is really good. Probably gets you most of the way to 99 just doing 99 slayer.
---
Clan chats are really confusing right now lol
---
Why do they all look bad lmfao
---
???
---
Use it to rain rc. When you’re done training rc (77), use it to train magic. 
---
Training magic anywhere else is literally a waste of time.
---
nice
---
This looks cool, subbed.   
---
I'm glad if people start to utilize the cinematic potential OSRS has. Beyond the stupid-looking gear that is introduced and the teleports everywhere that lets us ignore the world, Jagex did build a pretty good world now 20 years ago. The setting is believable, it feels varied and to some degree i can believe that living in most of the areas is possible and the trading/food situation makes sense. The world is unfortunately underappreciated in this game, so it's awesome if some content creators can shine some light on it.
---
you forgot "iron man btw"
---
Making yourself an Ironman is making OSRS harder for yourself, even more so if you choose UIM. Therefore being happy about updates that make it easier make for a fun contrast when the gamemode to many is supposed to be about the added challenge.
---
Wrong lol you can 1 tick flick with no drain.
---
yes
---
Glad to hear baybe &lt;3
---
I'm a pretty hardcore player and I don't 1t flick when I prayer flick, I just do the lazy flash method
---
I would happily pay insane amounts again for runes, ores, cannonballs etc to get rid of the bot problem
---
Me too !
---
My gf also complains she never is first at anything
---
green spots are close to you
---
bro
---
Jagex: Hey we changed some stuff
---
OSRS: Riot
---
Jagex: Fine we won't change stuff
---
OSRS: Dead content Riot!
---
Jagex: Ok we add new stuff
---
OSRS: (does math) IF XP rate is higher than current max ---&gt; Riot
---
IF XP rate is lower than current max ---&gt; Dead content ---&gt; Riot
---
IF XP rate is on par with the current max ---&gt; Riot?

Jagex: What do you want from us?

OSRS: We don't know but we want it now
---
Jagex: he

but then you cant show off the full third age you got on that first clue.
---
Maybe. So far though, I haven't reached tier 2 and I picked endurance, I imagine there will be a lot of those players too, who don't really plan on playing this for too long or whatever, just casually so they pick the endurance to make it easier and more fun. So far that's working out.

It's amazing what a good skybox and some lighting can achieve even keeping all the Old School graphics untouched. Awesome music choice as well. Subbed and looking forward to more!
---
The ring of forging is already f2p
---
This is a game where you can play on one account for years. To have content permanently limited because of a technicality on only certain quests that you won't necessarily know about or plan for, is completely unnecessary. How does it affect you if people can suddenly obtain these again?
---
k
---
Saying that it is forgotten implies that it hasn't received ANY updates recently.  Arguing that it needs improvement is different, and even though I'm not a PVPer, I'd probably agree with you there.  Encouraging symmetrical PVP combat rather than hunting PVMers or Skilers is a good thing, but it sounds like they still need to work on the specifics more.
---
Why is a developer of the game having to check the Wiki for this kind of information though?
---
I find it pretty easy to lock into the rhythm of game ticks when I have sound on. 1t flicking is actually harder for me because there are so many conflicting sounds and it's difficult to find where the tick actually starts.
---
On top of that, you really don't want to be stuck with a farming contract that you don't have any seeds for. By picking your contract, you don't have to worry about that.
---
Iron men don't have sex because they stand alone
---
oh wow! didn't know that
---
This please. Abolish first past the post when alternative voting has no relative downside.
---
What makes the gold farmers?
---
What were they farming?
---
Speaking of re obtaining quest item, will the crystal pendant be among the reclaimable items? It seems to have disappeared from people’s banks during the song of the elves update and, well, I want my fashionscape.
---
I saw it, skipped the banshee task, and am back in business. Endurance gang is back
---
Damn dude save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
lol thanks. I had given up on ever knowing
---
if you went alpha devotion gang, you of course want slayer task choice
---
then you afk like a boss in the catacombs
---
yeah man 300 prayer per hill giant feels amazing
---
I have endurance :)
---
Found it one day on Netflix and binged the entire series and movies. Funny af
---
plus the half prayer drain is nuttyyyy for slayer
---
Eh, I like ironman mode for the knowledge that I earned something myself. When it comes to stuff like the spice rack you still need to acquire the spices yourself to fill up the rack.
---
I hate the notion that the restricted game modes are meant to be harder. Not being able to trade undoubtedly does make the game harder, but there are aspects of design (such as limited bank space) which ironmen have a harder time dealing with than main accounts, when that isn't the kind of challenge that is fun or interesting to most people.
---
Ironman is a different experience, but it is the uniqueness of the playstyle that makes it interesting, not the difficulty that is inherent to that playstyle.
---
Pisctaorius will cost you a few hundred k to make planks

Can we get some mobile/ vanilla client QOL updates?  Since you guys have officially endorsed Runelite, it doesn't make sense how unfair it is vs the offical client. There are like hundreds of dope plugins that would make life easier. As someone who is mobile only, I already feel like I'm playing with one of my hands tied behind my back.

Attack speed
---
and rares weren't worth a lot for years afterwards. 
---
The discontinued statues is what caused rares, they've confirmed they won't be creating discontinued items.
---
Or take unnatural selection AND devotion and make profit at prayer heavy tasks
---
I would expect you should be using super str pots and looking at higher str lvs...
---
Also, calc doesnt consider overkill which hurts slow high hitting weapons
---
he bought it iron-ically
---
Because magic
---
The fact you’re trying to shove the 600 worthless internet points you got from this post in my face is the real joke. 
---
And using ‘2’ in place of ‘too’. Hilarious.
---
Why can’t u wear em? Does it require the quest where you go to that guys shack near burthrope
---
20% shayzien favour needed but the armourer in shayzien
---
People do it all the time, you’ll be fine.
---
Also fun fact, my edit of their max hit still seems to be in place.
---
Not Jeffrey Epstein?
---
Agility doesnt do anything while ur running afaik.  your run doesnt restore while ur actively running.
---
168 hours seems like quite a bit.  At least the bot has to do something for 48 hours, and that gives jagex some extra time to detect them as a bot. I imagine not doing anything for 48 hours and then starting LMS would also raise a bunch of flags.
---
this isn’t 4chan either, people have usernames smh my head 😤
---
Fuck off
---
How do I get dog
---
Support
---
Nice!
---
Might as well let everyone get a "Clean Necklace" on their first time cleaning uncleaned finds in the Varrock museum.  
---
Might as well let everyone always hit their max hit.  
---
Might as well let the Blowpipe venom everything on the first hit.  
---
Might as well add more guaranteed drops from bosses.
---
Switching the builds would make LMS really fun and keep it fresh. That’s a great idea.
---
Hey bro join L0st Dynasty cc I’m one of the owners!

We do everything content wise you can think of and there’s always people to hang out with even if it’s just shooting shit in the cc. Lmk bro we’d love to have a new friend! IGN: TTTankey
---
Thats the base term for prayer flicking. Ur tone is far too cocky for someone so wrong
---
Man they just can’t get this one right huh
---
My fallen enemies give me head twice as often! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
this is a dps calc, not max hit calc
---
your hat's showing
---
Ok Boomer.
---
What the fuck lol
---
I did, at 80 str with super str pot maul is still better dps
---
Same here dude, only i didnt have to walk there.
---
That patch of blue ruined my immersion
---
1000
---
They confirmed old rewards would still be available in new Leagues, they won't become discontinued items.
---
Yeah.  Memes everywhere about it lol
---
Lot of people dedicated to the meme lol
---
Is there any way to gain Strength without Hitpoints in Twisted league besides the 2 initial lamps from Clients of Kourend?
---
I kind of want 15 Strength for barb fishing, but don't want to have more than 10 Hitpoints yet.
---
You are now my 2nd favorite mod. Good luck beating Gad Ash.
---
I made the account specifically to attatch to my rs account, not used otherwise.
---
The best thing to do is just test each for like thirty minutes and see which one gives a better rate honestly. The dps calculator is usually right though
---
I chose endurance, but does it really even matter? Is everyone gonna be playing this for 2 months straight reaching end game content?
---
and it’s all thanks to gentletractor
---
Honestly this
---
Lmfao
---
I hope they kill me next.
---
Ah thats makes sense. I just thought it was strange.
---
The sad truth is Jagex has never really cared about CW. The update they did on RS3 years ago by Asherz and Co. literally killed it even faster than normal. It's likely in the bug report queue but it'll be low (or zero) priority. Best of luck to you and the other legit players.
---
Do you think you'll lose it before you earn 1m cash?
---
If you have the budget, building a basement with four steel dragons is very fast.
---
Got irritated at myself at some points so I took breaks. But once I finally got it, it was all worth it
---
22
---
Add pets to the crate
---
Yeah, also running into people multiple times that you chatted with trying to grind out your twisted banshee task.
---
Wait what happened what are these relics?
---
I finally stopped fletching once I hit 60 for the task points. I have about 5 levels til max
---
Lmao did YOU even read what you responded to?
---
Gains
---
Maiden one seems cool
---
a whip is way more likely
---
Why is it called "monka"? And what's the point of typing out the emotes name? THINKINGEMOJI
---
I need to take a shower and get all that seagull sperm off my chest
---
You would have to be exceedingly unfamiliar with regular wt to think the twisted league xp rates are even close to "on par," this is such a ridiculous timing to say
---
technically you can save up stams from dr jekyll event, so there are stams just an incredibly limited number
---
#osrsneverhappy
---
Already knew it would be dead in less than a month smh
---
that isnt a thing really. you can try twitter, you can ask here, if its a common ish thing its been asked before.
---
generally theyre very explicit with bans. if you are automating actions its not okay, otherwise its fine.
---
I have no friends either :(
---
"No"
---
"No?"
---
"How do I get dog"
---
Had me in stitches
---
A good portion of us have been focused on the skilling aspect first but the same still applies. I made a friend because he offered to pm me when he was finished with the ploughs, then i payed it forward to another guy. I’ve seen them both atleast 5 times across the continent since. One of them was even rank 6 earlier today. Crazy
---
todt is fine so long as hp is like sub 30 ish hp. 15 str would not get you much at all
---
Tbh got bored of leagues an hour into it
---
Why are you copying BanjoRS? This shit was not funny before and isnt funny now.
---
@JagexGambit while these awesome updates are happening can the lunar spell book be revisited? Certain spells, specifically the one that views another players stats, seem outdated.
---
He's still alive probably since they didn't even check the bodies DNA like they are suppose to.
---
It's boring af that's what it is
---
I can help, what gang are you in?
---
which is multiplied by x5 or even more so it means that xp rate are actually decent. And you don't really need 99 anyway unless you are going for top hiscores. 77 is enough if you are confident that you will clear raids.
