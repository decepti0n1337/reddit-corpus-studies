That's awesome dude I have trouble maxed out myself, good job!

---
But in this case they already have the server and the domain
---
Takes like 2 games and they just made it even easier..  it's not a complicated minigame or hard in anyway whatsoever
---
This video. golden gnome
---
Wow awesome, Chad! Let me hold your massive dick for you.
---
Because fixing a broken PvP mechanic that makes no sense is a good thing for the game. And running a beta to test for bugs and fix them is the best way to do it. There's no riots because Jagex is handling this in the appropriate way
---
It's snapchat
---
You sure it‚Äôs not just because any new boss from a quest you just completed is auto selected at NMZ?
---
I'll refer you to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cqvho3/low\_quality\_graphics\_on\_osrs\_mobile/ex0h1d4?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cqvho3/low_quality_graphics_on_osrs_mobile/ex0h1d4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---

---
&gt;Specifically, this:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;As the current mobile requirements stand, you either need a phone running iOS 10.0 or later (released September 13, 2016) or Android Lollipop (5.0) or later (released November 12, 2014). 2007scape was made to play on Windows 2000/XP. 99% of phones running the required (by Jagex) version of iOS/Android, all released in the last 5 years, would far surpass the hardware requirements of Windows 2000/XP. The difference in the quality of the two screenshots linked above cannot be explained by simply chalking it up to phone hardware catering. 
---
Whatever phone you're running OSRS Mobile with, I assure you it's got a better CPU and GPU than your computer did in your family's living room desktop back in 2002. That's not the reason for the quality difference. If anything it might be based on battery life. But if that's the case, then I think it would benefit us all (new and existing players) if we could adjust the quality if we're hardwired in or aren't concerned with battery life.
---
There's nothing to do with peasantry or speaking down to anyone in my posts. I just see a benefit in making the quality as good as desktop, or at least giving us the option.
---
&gt;What's the real difference between melee attack str and attck speed 
---
Atk speed is the same for both the scimmy and claws, but the scimmy does more damage over time.
---
&gt;Why?
---
Damage is calculated as a random roll of a die so if your max hit is 20 and you roll a hit the damage is anywhere between 1-20 (completely random) 
---
The reason why the scimmy is better is because your special auto regens over 5 min. Every attack is 2.4 seconds or roughly 63 attacks per 50% special.
---
So d claws does 20 damage but every 64th attack (2 and a half minutes) you have a chance at doing *max* 20+10+5+5= 40 damage. or basically one extra attack (now keep in mind it isn't garunteed and this is best case scenario)
---
vs 
---
dragon scimmy which has a chance for each of the 63 attacks to hit for 21 damage.
---
Someone feel free to chime in with more knowledge but hopefully this helps.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah you arent going to get anything back... not sure why you didnt get the 3rd item but its kinda your own fault for not claiming within an hour
---
These kind of problems would be fixed though, as they aren't the intended target of the LoS changes. Ideally this change goes through and nothing changes in PVM
---
You make a small profit bursting nechs if you have 80 slayer
---
Thats exactly the case. When you finish a quest with bosses, those are automatically enabled via nmz.
---
This feels like a fever dream
---
Should be pretty quick considering I'll be doing Tithe Farming and it gets up to 100k+ exp/hr after lvl 74
---
Yeah mate normal, I haven't done corrupted yet
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong but the ornament kit is tradeable isn't it?
---
Were you skulled pvming?
---
Jus splash it brosabi.
---
Thx daddy
---
I‚Äôd get drunk and start pushing on my leg expecting it to get me home
---
Just bad rng. You can get a mysterious emblem from any monster you kill on task via wildy slayer
---
If your having problems with switch try mage only or void setup. So you only have to switch weapon / helm and maybe off hand. Then start to add more switches as you get better
---
There was an equation back in rs2 days.
---
 Something like 
---
(Total lvl - all 99s) x 2 √∑ 3 + (30 for each 99)
---
I doubt that's still the case though.
---
What drugs do I need to try?
---
You have 34 prayer tho
---
Venezuelans hate me.
---
Yes the kit is but the torture(or) is not

What the hell were you on making this
---
Don't use balanced attacks because they're less accurate than others. The only exceptions are zamorakian spear on corporeal beast only (it takes reduced damage from other kinds of weapons), zamorakian hasta on monsters that are weak to stab attacks and abyssal whip.
---
Your perfect solution just reduced each games population by 50%. Sick
---
It literally is.
---
$11 btw
---
mbaye
---
because jagex has clearly stated they would not make content solely for iron men.  These capes would go against that.
---
You must be paying 12$ for extra rng
---
I laughed OP, thanks for posting.
---
Holy fucking shit, I can go full big brain and courier food and quest items.
---
Wym the odds are never in your favor?
---
Yeah, but keep in mind that there is no minimum payment. They only ask you cover the cost of the item.
---
I think, and this is my strategy personally on iphone 8, that mobile is best for skilling then when u get home u go to combat.
---
Mainly due to the point you made about the drops.
---
I always have chatbox off on mobile coz it takes up alot of the screen and whenever I accidentally click the chatbox the keyboard comes up.
---
True it limits the mobile to skilling only but i mean example of agility is just easier imo to just tap.
---
Well, they have no way of knowing that you just came back from bank and assumed that you are just a dick who doesn't care about other people. In my opinion, you lose your spot when you go to bank.
---
There's certain restrictions to what they won't do, even if you offer mills
---
Okay so we‚Äôre now at, not a quest, no pvp, no pvm, so we‚Äôre left with.... oh I guess skilling. But I think there are a few places to do that as well. Sounds like everything is already there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wait hold on. How you doing this?
---
do i on a slayer task? i did mine on slayer task and got 2 spears. Didnt solo the second one so had to split but i still have my first one :)
---
It is very doubtful that runelite is compromised, I assume the same holds for OSBuddy. You probably were slacking with online security.
---
Number 1 rule of general internet usage has changed quite a bit since the early/mid-00s(Never post personal info anywhere)
---
I don't know if it's still being emphasized as much to young users, hope it is.
---
I agree 100% if I was going str but I'm not.....yes I know the scimitar has a higher melee str but it is about stances vs best in slot for balance without questing....that's how I ended up getting claws......best in slot for balanced with no shield cause if you dont have dragonkite or plate then why go for defence so I figured I would go obsidian cause it gave me melee str which is what the claws and viggora's chainmace both give without questing.
---
Dragon warhammer would be better but no balanced stance
---
Sounds like to me, people who wouldn‚Äôt want an actual quest there are just scared of the wilderness
---
Bruh my man has a vagina helmet
---
Wipe your computer and start clean then get 2FA on both OSRS and your email. You should be good from then on out!
---
I imagine there's not much they wont bring. If I ask for a tbow they'll probably tell me to fuck myself haha
---
As a pker I can confirm this set up is aids
---
You doing okay, bud?
---
Runelite and osbuddy are both fine as far as account safety are concerned. And imo runelite is better for the features
---
Those are some of the most masculine legs I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Wow thanks for the advice! I'll have to remember this when I'm out in the wild from now on!
---
Yeah except that's not the case here. I completed SOTE day 1 on my zerk, which i've now turned main and been nmzing daily and they just showed up today. So OP is correct.
---
Very true. I guess...thank you for not being rude about it? Lol.
---
The effect of splashing on real rats.
---
It's because you're being smug and a smart-ass and think we don't know weight is important in osrs
---
I believe infernal are more afk, better money, and better fishing xp. Iirc the only reason to do sacred eels are if you expect scales to spike in price or if you value the cooking xp
---
Is there any reason to keep the Abbysal Bludgeon after hitting 99 strength?
---
Yea I‚Äôve been told to do them for a year or more.  I‚Äôm kind of burnt out after 2 years of 11hr a day gameplay from start to 2230 lol. 
---
Probably do them when I go back.
---
Usually big items with high demand like that stay relatively constant in price so yeah buying them for a few days won't be too bad.
---
With them big ass hands? Doesnt add up.
---
Right but you wouldn't go and make a whole post about it either . Cause you're an adult right?
---
wtf
---
Maybe if you all left the runecrafters and clue hunters alone everyone would be less likely to shut down pvp updates
---
i straight up wouldn't. just seems like a waste of food
---
Glad they are focused on browsing reddit and censoring stuff like this instead of all the people spamming racist and violent stuff in game 24/7
---
Or you could reply once to the parent thread and if people dont see it so be it. Spamming onto every single comment is literally against the subreddit rules. Your justification is pure entitlement
---
I was taking about his other name fatass dick but okay
---
Still waiting for it to rebound to the 2.7 I bought mine at... and I thought it was cheep then.
---
I upvoted because the clan chat. ‚ÄúBandos gave me the dick‚Äù
---
Wow, never gotten a two color potion from barrows before
---
But it‚Äôs not so rare I‚Äôd assume an error in the game‚Äôs code targeting specifically his account
---
That‚Äôs insanely cheep for something so op.
---
Of course I wouldn't, but I'd probably report someone with pussy, dick, ass, or other tier 1 swears in their name.
---
Yeah, they do hit you from straight the middle.... That's where spiny helm protects.  
---
D med is protecting the wrong side!
---
Balancing combat styles are a waste of time. You should train strength before attack most of the time by a few levels. Att/str 40/40 will get to 60/60 faster if you train strength first before attack.
---
At some point (75 attackish) there's no point to training it until 99 strength.
---
Super satisfied with today. Hadn‚Äôt gotten much other than DhAxe, twice. I don‚Äôt (obviously) don‚Äôt get to play too much but I‚Äôm pumped to double up on rewards. End goal is have all the barrows gear, just from playing on shift.
---
G I N G E R I N T E G E R
---
Spamming is against the subreddit rules...that's why. One reply to the parent thread is enough.
---
Thanks!
---
Not very adult like though
---
Same goes for "dick". It's a word they're gonna hear. Not gonna ask how old your kids are but if they're young enough that you'd be uncomfortable explaining either of those terms to them, you should probably get them off the internet.
---

Ey does anyone have the image without the caption
---
No, I never jumped the Ditch, always tele
---
MMK tried so many times to get fire cape and eventually got it. The joke is that he became a god after that.
---
its the challenge it poses. a lot or the resources used in skilling are acquired through combat (slayer) by having a lvl 3 skiller it makes it more challenging to get those materials in mass. also makes it so you have to use one skill to help pay for another, unless you have a main funding it. they can be great afk money making accounts, but thats usually end game for lvl 3 skillers
---
You don't ask
---
Don't even bother with the black d hide. In the event of another clue where dying is faster then running back to exit the wild, suicide is the fastest, like a wildy course step and dying to wolves.
---
I've been back a year. In a year, I've accomplished more than I did on my old account when I played from 04-07. 
---
Now if I could just beat Vorkath.....
---
yup. The mobile client is crap. people say it's good because they don't know how good a mobile client can be. clicks are so inaccurate and long press delays are uncustomizable. There is this RuneScape classic private server with an amazing android client. Clicks are rarely inaccurate, long presses can be changed to any delay you choose, and the screen rotation can be inverted. In addition, menus are usuable without taking so much valuable screenspace. 
---
Jagex needs to make the mobile client actually playable on non afk tasks.
---
Ok
---
Maybe you'll have the highest kc without pet?
---
Jagex addressed this one earlier in the week and said no.  They want to, but the report system infrastructure is so old and so few people know it they don't think they could find the time to get it done.
---
Noob should have used protect from melee
---
You still pay what you ask for, just the delivery is free.. altough tipping is a good gesture
---
Oh so you weren't actually getting those rates
---
Looks more like the 2h stance.
---
Yea
---
Jewish google. Google it
---
Hey I main Oberon
---
Looks dated? Don't you mean iconic interface that will ruin the game if it's changed REEEE
---
I just cut them. You lose money, but since you never bought them its okay. Pretty great xp especially early on
---
I dont get it :d what was your name supposed to be thats wrong? Haha
---
Yeah, in the longrun it would be better to just camp wyverns and gargs. The skilling grind gets hella old and you'll eventually have 2 mains if you keep at it. Win win. :P
---
I‚Äôve been saying it a couple times before in other posts related to clue doers, but this is indeed one if not the best setup to not get hit while having minimal risk.
---
A longbow instead of the crystal bow completely changes things. The crystal bow is rag because you can almost infinitely return without having to regear.
---
The longbow might however insinuate other things, such as:
---
1.you have arrows, maybe a lot of.
---
2. Depending on the location, you might be doing callisto/venenatis
---
3. You are a noob, which means you might have brought random wealth
---
I never hit those people. There is absolutely no incentive. The end result is always the same if you do hit them: Ragger drains your supplies, he drops garbage loot (if any), might talk shit while dying, and you have to bank and regear.
---
Point is, if you look like you know what you‚Äôre doing, and their expected result is annoyance to themselves without any reward, they won‚Äôt hit you
---
Runners are attracted to all food, bad food makes them run north. If one gets by, throw some bad food down and they'll run back north, good food within 5ish spaces of where they are leading to the trap.
---
If you run fast enough though, you'll never let any by.
---
I ain't never been downvoted like that before, shit almost hurt my feelings haha.
---
I think at that point you would want a better term than big boy but that's just me
---

yeah last time I changed into a girl and gave the first person who called me cute half a mil.  We've been married ever since.
---
More importantly why isn‚Äôt this being polled when it‚Äôs essentially the same thing as changing the color of clue scrolls (which was polled)?
---
Ya, no it's just not necessary clearly because they made him change his name. You are immature.
---
Depends what you are going to do, it doesnt have too much uses, but its good for barraging/bursting on Dust devil/Nech tasks and on Inferno. Also some other uses, but those are main ones.
---
this is cool, but the hot pink torso is pretty sweet as well
---
Hell, will any of them be polled?
---
We polled changing the color of clue scrolls but seems like we‚Äôre not going to poll the clue scrolls Casket colors. Which makes 0 fucking sense.
---
nope just gotta do one of those unfortunately
---

---
True, witchers don't kill dragons.
---
Its a runelite bug, its not a negative amount.
---
Most PvPers are the same fuckers that deliberately vote no on the new skills and content updates because they're pures that don't want the game to change even if it's for the better. "Uh fuck you, I had to get 99 the hard way, you should to". So yeh, fuck you, I sabotaged your poll.
---

Came back to the game recently with a fresh account after many many years. I've been working on getting attack and strength to 65 while doing slayer tasks, so I can grind defenders. Think I'm sitting at 53 for both.
---
My question is, is this at all worth doing, or would I benefit by doing exp grinds away from slayer tasks and come back to slayer when I can use higher combat level slayer masters?

OSU is a game where you click circles to the beat of the game.

---
If you want some crazy gameplay of OSU go youtube Cookiezi
---
Nope. Pickaxe and mining level don't impact rate of gathering there. It's fixed. I'm not sure if it changes depletion based on level, but I'd doubt that too 
---
You can use a black pickaxe, especially if doing abyss method. But also because it's 0 weight.
---
Yes, because being offended by the words ass and dick is the hallmark of maturity. It's perfectly fine if you don't want your kid exposed to that language, but it's also your responsibility to protect them from it if you think that's an issue, and if you're letting them play Runescape they are inevitably going to come across much worse than fat assdick. I'm just saying that the Jagex filtering system is not going to protect your kids, so if you think they need protection, it's on you to monitor the content they consume and not on everybody else to cater to them.

osu! is a free rhythm game, you press on the notes using z and x, and move the cursor by moving your mouse, or in this case a drawing tablet pen. There's every song you can think of from western to eastern, and there's lots of OSRS soundtracks as well.
---
I recently finished farming Fishing Trawler for the full angler set and it's used for minnows and a master clue step. Do any of the other skilling outfits have uses outside of the xp bonus?
---
Lobsters and regular combats?
---
Is it worth using divine ranging and magic potion over their regular counterparts at Zulrah? The wiki was changed to recommend the divine versions which cost more, but are the benefits worth the extra price?
---
Switch skills, set a goal for a quest and work towards all the requirements.
---
With Song of The Elves releases recently, that‚Äôs a decent enough goal if you haven‚Äôt done many of the pre-reqs.
---
If the medium is graffiti in a vacuum, then you could expect a lot
---
Wealth, Speaking of clan support, can we do something else about the total lvl requirement to join a CC? A bunch of my friends were wanting to get on and make accounts and hit the F2P wildy with like lvl 10 mages, and now we can‚Äôt because of that.
---
They should just add a comp cape and be done with it.
---
The way it works is that you keep your 3 most valuable items (regardless of whether they're tradeable or not) in addition to any other untradeables. So if you have an untradeable with a high alch value (or GE value if it has one assigned to it) worth more than the GE value of a tradeable item, the untradeable item gets counted as one of your 3 most valuable items.
---
I heard someone taking about seeing a rat running in circles,  is this a common thing or a disease maybe?
---
I always afk anglers when im doing something else
---
I found [this layout](https://i.imgur.com/w7a9fhp.jpg) from another user on here a long while back at the top of a thread asking a similar question and made my house look the same. Can't think of any ways it could be better, think this has to at least be pretty damn close to the best layout.
---
Time for 16000 dpi
---
No, the "small window" isn't actually that size or in that position on their screen. They just get their screen recording software to resize the window on the stream to make it smaller. In reality it can be the same size as the main window.

Whats your current Avengers endgame watch-through count?
---
Hello are you me
---
Then they'd need a Champions Maxed Ava's Cape, Ardy Cape, Imbued God Capes, and so on...
---
&gt;But why dude, the wilderness is risky for everyone, pkers shouldn‚Äôt have to be forced to only attack other pkers, what‚Äôs the point of having it then?
---
You answered this yourself
---
&gt;They have fun by, get this, killing other players
---
So again, pvm and skilling content is not necessary in the wilderness because there are other pkers there to fight. Why are you so threatened by the concept of only fighting pkers? 
---
You are right, nobody is forced in the wilderness, that's why I and many others choose not to go there at all. I would love to try the bosses and skilling content in there, but it's not worth it. The one thing that might be worth it is the chaos altar, and the meta for that is to bring one inventory of bones at a time and suicide because of skull tricking and clans. You aren't even allowed to go in a full tank setup where your only option is to chug brews and run, because they are forcing *another* pvp integrity nerf on the bulwark and magic defence. What a shock people bring nothing/3 items and suicide!
---
&gt; if that pisses you off then it‚Äôs worth it for them. That‚Äôs the whole damn point. You get pissed off because you‚Äôre pked in the wilderness, and they get the satisfaction of you getting pissed off. 
---
This is the mindset that's come to bite the pvp community in the ass. I can change what you said there to piss off probably every single pker. And they will cry that *they* are the victim. "If people voting no to all pvp updates pisses you off then it's worth it for them. That's the whole damn point. You get pissed off because you don't get content, and they get the satisfaction of you getting pissed off."
---
Quit being such selfish fucking dicks and people will probably start being nicer in return.
---
Nah dude that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying dumbass, you should be removed from the gene pool simply because you can‚Äôt accept another persons point of view and have to resort to wanting them to die for it. 
---
I‚Äôm saying people who enjoy pking don‚Äôt need to be forced to only fight each other. You go into the wilderness you risk dying to a pker, it‚Äôs a part of the game. If you don‚Äôt want to die to other people don‚Äôt walk into the wilderness it‚Äôs that simple. If you want to complain about it because the games only risky mechanic makes you cry at your keyboard then don‚Äôt doooo it. 
---
You can pvm and skill at every other location of the game, and just because there‚Äôs one area you can‚Äôt do it safely in you choose to shut down every pvp update because it doesn‚Äôt cater to you.
---
I don‚Äôt pvp at all, why? Because I fucking suck at it and would die against anyone, does that mean I should cry about those people who took advantage of me not being skilled at pvp? No, it means I shouldn‚Äôt walk into the wilderness expecting to survive easily.

I got lucky with a dwh drop back when they were 70m early on in the game before I had barrows gloves or a firecape. That set me up with full bandos running around with an obby cape and had never bought gold.

Did you try using a tinderbox on them? Maybe they added it in as a shortcut!
---
This looks like a /u/25_buttholes character.
---
Thanks for your honest feedback to this mystery.
---
Any good money makers that aren't mind numbingly boring like vorkath? I have dhcb and the kills are just stare at the screen the whole time and don't get smashed by his fireball.
---
Are demonics worth it off task? Do I use normal whip to avoid wasting arclight charges?
---
Magic logs? Definitely infernal eels are better gp and xp.
---
It's not smart at all. Its a waste of time overall ahha.
---
yes
---
Oh for sure. It's a convenience thing rather than a pure benefit.
---
Prolly, but Jagex is powerless ü¶Ä, so who knows?
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Hahha the sanity factor definitely can be a benefit ;P
---
Magic longbow spec has 100% accuracy.  It's common to use the spec when callisto has very little health left.
---
Don‚Äôt do woodcutting then man, plenty of easier 99 capes to get
---
Probably, if the magic potion gives you 2 or more extra max hits. Otherwise probably not.
---
Ranging I would say not unless you're using tbow, but I don't do super long trips so idk
---
Yeh I know, just providing added info right here. As the old system used to be super simple. Just send em to a farm clock website and it would tell em when the next growth occur.
---
Why do you have hat
---
d
---
I'd say maxed players when a new skill is proposed is pretty close
---
Also as long as you don't click off of reloading the cannon at the wrong time and get pulled into multi... Though probably not using that method on a Hardcore since you kinda need to safespot Ven somewhere.

77 KC one happy camper
---
Probably the pvp updates made the merchers excited
---
Yooo grats man!
---
Most things have been trending downwards for months now. Just keep accumulating items and try to just ignore the ge value, it'll save a lot of stress.
---
Everyone‚Äôs first 99 should be 99 mining @Zalcano. Make 3-4b then buy every 99 you can.

Meet YourUncle, my abusive, alcoholic, granite plate, ogre club, boot head Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can only drink alcohol and train on female npcs. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Ultimate Cow Ironman.
---
I‚Äôve got the 75+ in all melee stats but 60 prayer and level 94 combat. Can I still learn raids with y‚Äôall someday?
---
I think if he just kept dps on zuk he had it
---
It said 1 kc tho
---
Am one, can confirm. Seeing this gear gives me ptsd
---
How is this... what... why Jagex :(
---
I‚Äôm x3 drop rate and you have all my pet drops &gt;:(
---
Rl saves your casket openings in a folder on your computer btw
---
2277 ain‚Äôt big boy. 200m xp in everything is.
---
My alts are poorly quested with bandos.
---
Because he killed zuk and got 1 KC, but he was still defeated during the challenge
---
Also to note if you go for quest cape: there is a quest locked behind each of the favours
---
vaxei - wizard's tower hddt
---
lmao just no
---
Looks like the price went up lol
---
Few reasons honestly. Inflation happens. But bonds have historical cost more during the summer since more kids are playing, and the Summer Special.
---
Zerk being the zammy hasta and torture being the theater of blood stuff???
---
They don't need to know your email, if they know the login and try to do a password change through "forgot password" it just sends a reset email to whichever email is registered to the account, they will then get a message saying " a password reset as been sent to email a****.**@hotmail" without actually telling them your full email
---
100m isn't really all that hard to get any more
---
Clearly it is 50/50, you either get it or you dont :^)
---
this sounds delusional tbh, username along with comment does make sense though
---
also his 500 dollar bounty
---
completing inferno means getting the cape, he killed zuk but he did NOT complete the inferno
---
W
---
Nobody is talking about grinding 100M.  
---
We are talking about paying $163.
---
500kc only a dust battle staff, I‚Äôm incredibly jealous :(
---
Just kill the dragon not hard ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They don‚Äôt say that at all lol. They said they‚Äôre going to adjust inferno as the beta progresses and will test changes at a later time.
---
Mediocre range/melee raggers can fuck good brids up if they're lucky and hit well and the brid isnt praying, and it's easy to tank when you're not having to switch gear all the time. Having a plate leg dhide bottom switch is enough to do pretty well
---
Not always. They could just be swapping gear from a main or something. But when you see a jimmy that literally knows nothing in 100m worth of gear and no quest items it is prettt clear he bought gold.
---
Holy shit how did I forget about DKs, I even grinded the diary for them
---
NPC aggression timer
---
Yeah his "pro" teachers fucked him by telling him to tag the mager off instead of only the ranger and instantly going back to Zuk. This is why it's better to think for yourself than 100% rely on others like he is.
---
A lot of people who work and make decent money probably have expendable income and don't mind throwing it at this game. Especially when you take into consideration that this could potentially be the only game they play and there's no other accessories needed, its not too surprising.
---
iroman without knowing what the chaos ele is. bold.
---
And you literally don't have to pk people that aren't interested in pking. You still haven't said what is so wrong with the wilderness before they started adding all the unnecessary content to it. Surely fighting other geared up players is more fun then slapping running combat dummies?
---
I‚Äôm on an uim haven‚Äôt played the game in years, 40 combats. Why not, you know, help out instead of just commenting dumb shit.
---
Oh just kill the dragon! Sorry but I probably hasn‚Äôt played as long as you.
---
Or he doesn't wanna do RFD for the 5th time?
---
youre a good guy
---
And that's what I'm saying. It's not hard to get 100m in game even at low levels so I would say it's less than likely a kid spending $163 on their mom's credit card.
---
Yo just click it and eat food üòÇ
---
No you will afk log because arrow keys don't keep you logged in.  Also splashing stops after like 20 min if you don't click on the enemy again
---
It‚Äôs my only Osrs acc. I‚Äôm a total noob.
---
no he tagged the wrong mager 3 times if he tagged correct the shield stays alive lmao
---
Join our fellow boothead on his quest to smite off the evil bucketheads and free the land once again
---
Yeah I might have to go in with melee next time. Saw the safe spot brought magic, safe spot didn‚Äôt work almost died lmfao
---
90 since you can't use the saw to boost for tree ring. Often 8 slots in portal nexus is enough teleports so the marginal utility of getting those extra levels isn't worth the cost of 3-4m extra con xp = 30m+ extra gp cost since it's like doubling the cost compared to just getting 83 + max house.
---
impossible right?, the only thing you could even feasibility kill with cannon would be chaos ele but the attack range is so huge on it i doubt you could do it without dying. And if anyone dragged it to a safespot for you would the tanking update stop you getting any loot
---
thats like 2 hours of pvm on rs3 ...
---
Bingo Bango Bongo keep your children out the Congo
---
There should be a system where fuck off mate
---
Thank you very much
---
That attitude is exactly why pvp is in the state it is now. People have changed, but the game has not, and it would take a lot to really revitalize pvp to a point where everyone would want to try it.
---
Right now, there is absolutely no reason for new players to even try. They'll get destroyed and lose money, which is completely counter productive in, especially with everything being about efficiency nowadays.
---
All metal helms should I mean they're armor but that would make too much sense.
---
Add a recoil for extra annoying.
---
I see this a lot I'm gaming. People seem to quickly forget what gave them difficulty in the past, or fail to see what gives other less skilled players difficulties, and start offering suggestions that are insane to expect someone learning to pick up on before they've learned the basics. And now in the steamer generation everyone is an expect, or likes to act like it. So much bad advice is thrown around by bad players because they saw a good player do it.
---
Now that the Gmaul is nerfed, I have some questions about making/using a pure.
---
Right now I have a f2p pure, around level 40. I want to transition into a p2p pure.
---
My plan was to go for 50 atk, and I was going to use MSB&gt;Gmaul.
---
With the nerf, that is now not really doable (sadly, I really wanted to try out 50 atk pking, but I wasnt able to get members on my pure til around today :\*( )
---
So what would be a good build/weapon to use be?
---
I assume I should go for 60 atk, but it seems like it is really expensive, since the only options I really know of are DDS and D claws, and one is significantly better.
---
Could someone give me some advice on what kinda build I should go for? Did this nerf just make pure pking a lot more expensive? I wouldn't mind using a bit more expensive stuff, but claws are too expensive, and I am not confident I could avoid smite/always have prot pray on.
---
Fuck off mate. Rsn:buttcheese69
---
Unless you have clue box, it's better to open in wild so that you can protect 3 valuable items from the clue rather than losing everything
---
honestly, you can make $163 faster irl then you can make 100m in the game.  I mean for most that isn't even 1 day of work.
---
I consented to nothing when I was born, I was forced into it. I do not consent to PvP, I'm forced into the Wilderness for a clue.
---
Rag with snakeskin boots and rune gloves, very cheap and rune gloves are much easier to get than barrows!
---
I only come to the wilderness when duradel tells me to kill scorpia and Im out of slayer points tbh, thats not high reward at all :\^(
---
That and wildy clue steps, either way Ive never set foot in the wilderness for the high risk high reward skilling
---
I dont really care about being PKed tho, just wanted to throw in some examples of being "forced" into the wilderness by the game
---
Deflect, deflect, DEFLECT!
---
To add to this, a ring of recoil will make you reek of bait.
---
Still waiting for people in favor of PvP to understand why people are not in favor of it.
---
PvP and PKing are different things. Player vs Player and Player Killing. Player vs Player would imply one player is fighting another player and they're BOTH fighting. PKing is killing players. The Falador Massacre shit wasn't PvP it was PKing.
---
PvMers and skillers do not want to PvP but they're drawn into the wilderness by content that suits them for one reason or another. You're trying to level prayer? Well you're either lazy, or stupid if you aren't doing it at the chaos altar because of how much more efficient is it both cost and time wise. That doesn't mean that the people wanting to level prayer are no interested in PvP, hence why they tend just to bring tank gear and bones or tank gear, coins, noted bones and a bunch of supplies.
---
Do not be surprised that polls for PvP get a lot of no votes when the main association with PvP that people make is, "I'm trying to skill and these shitheads are annoying me." Why would people with that mentality want to vote in favor of your content which would likely draw MORE PEOPLE into doing the shit that gets them annoyed if it introduced people to PvP/PKing.
---
Get Jagex to deal with issues such as PKing people doing clues risking nothing, people PKing those trying to just do prayer, etc. You'll probably find that more people would be okay with voting yes to PvP polls.
---
Also I am aware of the arguments that people try to use all the time. Yes, the wilderness is meant to attack other peoples in and you going in there subjects yourself to it. That doesn't mean people have to like it. Yes, people can choose to risk less and once in awhile you'll find someone risking a ton of GP, but most people do choose to risk less but they can get PKed all the same. That doesn't mean people have to like it still.
---
Just got my pet thermy at 1190kc. Also three steam staffs one dchain and one occult
---
From scratch?
---
Insure it or put in bank for fucks sake
---
3x 99 thieving and no pets
---
Give me staff and I will give you pet
---
I have always been interested in learning to PK, but it confuses my poor skiller soul.
---
This account used to be titled HCIM. You died during thieving, didn't you.
---
Eat too much and you'll get sick
---
I know "I can count the pixels" is a meme / tired saying, but I can count the pixels.
---
99 p***** slayer 
---
(bc kids play this game)
---
Youd rather play rs without any risk attached to it at all? I mean we could just turn osrs into low res world of warcraft, atleast thay way you dont need to risk anything and you can just get anything you want without really working for it!
---
True, but "can make" and "willing to spend" is an entire different thing.  
---
We are talking about almost 3 AAA game titles worth of games.
---
inb4 every pvp updates becomes integrity (which it looks like it's becoming) due to you and others being petty.
---
Assuming you have 400m of gear, maxed stats, and Priff/curses unlocked
---
Like if I have a 50/50 chance of winning a stake, how do I lose 5 times in a row... I guess I just have really bad luck.
---
Hey, yeah i know that theres Rune armor and so on that gives profit alching. But when i alched i couldnt afford those prices and i bought yew longbows or something. So i thought those compared a bit better to yew longs than those items giving profit, but if you know some good ones i dont know, let the people know
---
I make it to verzik almost every raid and my 0kc teammates plank p1 every time so I don't even have a decent shot at getting to p2 let alone 3. People with 1kc will deny me at the notice board. It's the most toxic community of OSRS I have ever encountered by a long shot
---
you‚Äôre incredibly lucky lmao go insure that shit
---
you're not forced in the wild, the reward is just high enough for you to think it's worth to risk it, as it is intended
---
Why don't you join us in ParadoxCC :D social/pvm/skilling clan where u can achieve ur 99 wc while chatting with other also do some bossing from time to time as a break ,we have also other events fun games.
---
I did 99 rc by doing a certain amount of xp daily then off to do w/e
---
I hope this helps :)
---
Maxed players are like the fucking bogeyman to this community
---
This subs inability to use screenshots is a hill I'm willing to die on.
---
That is the average gross income per kill, not profit. Profit is much lower.
---
The issue is the price of scroll box, which is pretty high, considering the possible rewards from clue scrolls. When the protection against losing your clue scroll devours the majority of your possible reward, it makes completing the scroll pretty dull.
---
You were not forced into the wild. You chose to go in and got dropped haha
---
LOL
---
Yeh i've just learned that as i came home. I bought 50 at 21k ea ahah :D
---
i would love to join but i‚Äôm 99 bc max zerk, would
---
you guys be willing to work with me?
---
FYI Dragon Pickaxe is tradable.
---
Where again are you forced to go into the wild?
---
Bored :P ? Join ParadoxCC and do some activities with us
---
He was praying mage anyways so if he got the other mage off the shield then he could just kill zuk behind the shield while safe. Pretty unlucky at the end but he still has the kc at least.
---
A true hero.
---
I've completed literally hundreds, if not thousands of wildy steps and I've lost 2 clue boxes. No one is going into the wildy and dying at a rate even close to the boxes being detrimental to their profits.
---
Me like spade
---
If you die doing family crest then you are officially a shit cunt.
---
And anyone who goes for a champion's cape probably cannoned a fair few thousand.
---
Somebody pked me last night. I think its funny because he probably used more money on runes then he got from my boots of lightness and a single dragonbone.
---
Nice work! How long did it take you?
---
Oh hey! Yes that was me. If anybody wants RuneScape related DND resources, feel free to pm me. I have monsters, items, roll20 maps, and advice.
---
I like it. Let's make it more specific and say I have to live a life outside of OSRS! That's the real challenge
---
The guy who went full on bloodlust and turned on smite was so adorable.
---
between real life and pure laziness like two years lol :/ i‚Äôm gonna start slowly working on 85s and such for diaries
---
Then you're either way more lucky or skilled than I am. I wish that was the case for me as well.
---
I bet you've stood afk for more time than it takes to unlock it lol.
---
To each their own, I really don't think two games is a lot of time for something nice and convenient. OFC nobody "needs" it
---
Greece, I heard government gave money basically for anything for anyone. Also heard that ppl there started working in games for money like wow didn't realize rs too
---
That‚Äôs not what I said - I clearly stated PvP. 
---
Also, no. A bug doesn‚Äôt become a feature because it isn‚Äôt tended too and line of sight was corrected in RS3.
---
He stands alone
---
&gt;why not just vote yes for content you think is "the best of garbage"
---
Id rather have no garbage than "best of the garbage" . And you've looped back to "why not vote yes if it gets implemented anyway" which is not a healthy state of polling content or changes.
---
AND GAZE UPON THE BATTLEFIELD
---
Mind blown, cant be unseen!
---
look at this community lmao we are talking about pixels here and people are calling each other cunts and getting all worked up. shit, i love osrs. but the forums community is so toxic lmao can‚Äôt wait for august 27th
---
I mean, what's forcing you to do that quest?
---
Oh? When was this changed?
---
I wouldn't say they're a problem really. They're in like level 8 wildy, so even if you're an ironman and don't have a glory you can easily tele out if you see a white dot. Also I've killed them many times there on low level accounts and never seen anyone pk there.
---
Way less head than I get
---
The content that would be balanced around not being in wildy already exists - red chins and regular altars. You just want all the benefits with no risk.
---
Everyone on reddit just has a victim mentality where every pker is solely out to get them, as if no pkers attack other pkers. The majority of pkers that hunt skillers are complete trash and could be tanked/killed easily if people spent 5 minutes learning how to ags maul.
---
Again, not a choice.
---
Just make ososrs
---
If i was maxed id welcome a new skill, i quit my account about a week after i maxed on rs3(ez)scape
---
Dont get what people do when theres no actual progress to be made
---
Read the post I replied to, as this is irrelevant to my response.
---
Ironically its harder to get gear in world of warcraft.
---
Irons have tons of money lol everyone should pay the farmers
---
You can buy pineapples from charters for super cheap, they make super compost then just use ash. Waaaay simpler.
---
To be fair Jagex did put a non-wilderness obtainable version of the dragon pickaxe (3rd age pickaxe) in the game. So if you are worried about the risk associated with the wilderness you can always just do clues?
---
uh sure, just pointing out the existence of clue boxes since you seem to think youre risking the clue item
---
Literally kids are complaining about not being able to kill people in the wilderness lmao 
---
You risk nothing and expect to hit through the best tank item in the game, and then cry to jagex to nerf it.
---
Both sides are at an impasse here because neither actually wants the gameplay the wildy offers.
---
You haven't entered the wilderness in a while, huh?
---
Skippable with Turael.
---
Can always obtain the non-wilderness version of the dragon pickaxe :)
---
woMeN
---
'Active trades' from the GE is more of 'recent trades'. For almost everything sold 'low quantity' such as 3rd age stuff, the active trades will show zero. Websites like GE-tracker or PlatinumTokens will show the actual quantity.
---
&gt; You're trying to level prayer? Well you're either lazy, or stupid if you aren't doing it at the chaos altar because of how much more efficient is it both cost and time wise.
---
Do you honestly think that method would exist if people couldnt PK you there? It sounds like all you want is an easy way to level up, sorry but you can't get everything just handed to you. Wanna train prayer without the risk of getting pked but still getting great xp, go do POH.
---
Just watched his videos yesterday for the first time. Holy shit does this man have dedication.
---
it kinda feels wrong that people can control a world like this
---
runelite.net looks like an SPA, so not that simple.
---
You realise you can skip tasks without ending your streak via the slayer master rewards right?
---
What shirt is the swordsman wearing?
---
The fact that wilderness is PvP zone doesn't mean that skilling or PvMing there is PvP activity. Other players can attack you indeed, but surely you don't think that a level 3 goes to black chins in order to PvP? That's what I mean when I say there are non-pvp activities in wilderness.
---
that's my point. The client Im talking about has click correction so big thumbs on small devices can still work for playing this game.
---
Dude I attack people on my Ironman so they don‚Äôt try to grief me.
---
Don‚Äôt be a prey. Ez
---
what is rag gear?
---
ahah xDXDXDXDXD le random 50/50 XD funny trollface
---
Other people test ran it for him
---
Showing its difficult but possible
---
This is a back of the mind paranoia I get turned into a meme
---
The situation is regular slayer masters give tasks anywhere in Runescape, the wildy slayer master gives slayer tasks that can only be completed in the wilderness, Konar gives slayer tasks that can only be completed in places she chooses. What is wrong with a slayer master that gives assignments anywhere in Runescape giving a slayer task in Runescape?
---
Bulwark is around 5m, but people tend to bring it with the best body they can afford such as an Armadyl or Justiciar body. Bulwark gives insane melee and ranged def bonuses and the Armadyl body gives a lot of magic def while the Justiciar is a bit of both I believe.
---
Point is that people in that 25k gear LITERALLY intro level gear to get them into the concept of improving gear since Xeracian is the next step up from level 1 wizard robes, the people wearing that stuff think they should be able to consistently hit on people wearing said 40m end game gear and that an issue existed, so they were in favor of removing the 18 magic def provided while still refusing to upgrade any of their gear.
---
I think I seen that in some PK video the dude he killled has ropes and chairs in inv LOL
---
Bank stand while looking for new porn to watch
---
Voted no to keep your Cape? ... bruh
---
Should get 3 for every kill..
---
You can train there without risking anything.  I did 20-47 prayer in literally 30 minutes only risking bones each time.  burning ammy -&gt; altar bones -&gt; suicide on the wine -&gt; repeat.
---
Play mobile only for like a month and then finally log into runelite
---
Ya it's the item they drop when you start witches potion. The in game character just hasn't studied biology so assumes it's a rat's tail.
---
"High risk, high reward" sounds nice but the problem has never been about the risk. The problem has always been the way wilderness content has been designed (it's also not even that high of a risk anyway, you can do anything with &lt;200k risk). The way the wildy is designed now (putting out lucrative pvm/skilling resources to lure out non pvpers) only serves to divide the community and alienates anyone who falls into the aforementioned "prey" category i.e. the vast majority of the playerbase. It shouldn't be a surprise whenever pvp polls fail because many players have been conditioned to resent that side of the game. It also shouldn't be a shock when more and more people start to get sick of content that continuously puts them at a disadvantage, since if you go into the wilderness to do anything other than PK, you are a sitting duck. Take a look at RS3 if you want to see the future of OSRS wildy.
---
Then you haven't been to pvm hotspots. Most of these spots have teams hopping around looking to fight pvmers/skillers(chins) and will gladly try to kill any teams they encounter.
---
Nothing makes me happier then to see this loser not get that cape :) dude is obnoxious af
---
&gt;or be targeted by PVPers and vice versa.
---
Then what's the point of a PVP area?
---
Yeah I log in and do what I want clearly I'm not actually playing a video game I'm just figuratively doing it. Hahahah imagine actually playing an actual video game whoa bro
---
Dingdingding. Skillers and PvMers don't want to PvP and the people who kill them don't want to PvP either. It's a retarded circle that Jagex just keeps encouraging with all their trash rejuvenation updates.
---
Gear that you would use to just annoy/prevent people who are trying to pk. High mage defense, no risk, and some ranged weapon.
---
Hope it dies. Vote no to anything pvp. Its a small fragment of the community thats toxic as fuck
---
Hope so
---
Higher focus in a certain area, like witg pvp worlds. It's all entered around a focus point.
---
Nobody ever said these people wanted a fight, so a lot of this is really mundane and moot. They want to pk someone. You're in a place where you can pk and get pked. They want to pk. Doesn't seem so complex now?
---
Literally anything its fucking runescape 
---
Also nothing apple because its overpriced garbage
---
For a total level 1500 account without any 99's, it'd be 1000 $? That sounds a bit much..
---
100% agree.  But when there's a new PvP poll out they act like everyone's best friends to get people to vote yes üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs what happens when half your base are a bunch of basement dwellers
---
There's already no risk in the wilderness. Clans don't risk anything, streamers who PK risk nothing, solo pkers aren't going to risk anything because of the risk of clans, and skillers/PvMers are going to risk as little as they can because of the prior groups.
---
that just leaves them wide open and bent over for inflation to fuck them
---
Idk they did it before and it became rs3 and i quit when they started changing armor designs because for some reason their art department is always on a bad acid trip and cant design shit
---
Thanks for the feedback! I just thought that seeing those two posts side by side was funny, haha
---
The consent is asked whe. Entering the wilderness
---
Now i‚Äôm by no means a veteran or even someone all that knowledgable about the wilderness but what about a gp cap? 
---
If you‚Äôre carrying, say, 50k gp worth of items, you can be attacked. If you‚Äôre under, you can‚Äôt. That would make abyss runecrafters, clue hunters, catch and release chinners, agility course goers, and questers safe while leaving areas like rev caves, bosses and resource area still a risk.
---
Then again, that‚Äôs just a thought i put less than a minute‚Äôs effort into. Maybe it‚Äôs bad, maybe it goes against the spirit of the wilderness.
---
So the mage arena that has been in the wilderness for years doesn't belong there?
---
This opinion IS toxic as fuck.
---
They can literally only be toxic and kill you in the wilderness ? That‚Äôs literally the whole point .. kill on sight . Don‚Äôt want to die ? Don‚Äôt go into the wilderness .
---
I got 3 prims, 4 pegs, 1 eternal and jar 540 kc lmao
---
You literally said you derive enjoyment out of making others miserable, that makes you a psychopath and a detriment to society that shouldnt exist.
---
1-99 in like, 20 mins. Sweet.
---
He keeps it on death not like it matters
---
For a bandos tank setup would full bandos and spectral be better or full justiciar with DFS? Both setups would have guardians, fury, suffering and imbued heart. Ely is out of the question.
---
So the vote no is nothing more than an attempt to upset fellow scapers. Man thats kinda sad. I feel so sorry for you man. I hope things get better :(
---
What are you talking about? (I honestly want to know)
---
I mean they call rs3 a fantasy game so why not use fantasy style on your armor sets.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anymore than your current inventory honestly. It‚Äôs a PK hotspot. I frequent there on my main.
---
Constantly
---
Why? Would you be cool if slayer was removed?
---
Okay so where did you get lost?

As it is CURRENTLY, it's still **WAY TOO GOOD** to not be used. There is NOT an alternative for normal accounts that makes sense. Look at the Ecto shit, that's more cost effective the gilded altars with burners and it is 100% completely safe. Why is it not used? Oh right, because it's slower and more effort just to save some bones.
---
Chaos Altar is faster, cheaper and less effort. There is literally no reason as a normal account to train prayer using any other method. It doesn't matter if you get PKed even if it's for full inventories of bones because unless you somehow get incredibly unlucky and can never make it to the altar, you'll still save time, money and effort with how AFK it can be. You could do the math yourself if you want, figure out how many bones you need from 1 - 99 on a gilded altar with burners lit 24/7, divide the count by half and that's how many bones you need to use on the chaos altar to get 1 - 99. Take that number, divide it by 28 to simulate how many inventories you could fill with those bones and then you can use that same number to determine how many times you would need to get PKed for a full inventory of bones to end up equal with a gilded altar.
---
Or but we're also not considering you need to find yourself a gilded altar with burners, hope the burners never go out when you're using bones and the fact that at Chaos Altar you don't come across PKers too often especially late at night. My friend told me they'd run into 1 PKer every 2 or 4 hours on 2k total worlds and they'd watch movies the entire time if PKers showed up they would either take too long to kill him OR he'd lose a few bones at most.
---
So hopefully you now understand the point. Chaos Altar has been too overpowered since the start, it doesn't matter that it's in the wildy, it's too overpowered. There is no GOOD alternative when all things are considered aside from you're a HCIM and don't want to risk losing status. When you get a PKer on you, it's not something that "keeps chaos altar in check with other options" it's something that annoys the person doing prayer because no matter what they're still better off then they would've been, but now they have to do a bit more shit in the end.
---
Omg shooting stars were fun
---
Often times the tip consists of some loot, like if a guy asks for 10 sharks to wyverns, you get 5 wyvern bones back or something.
---
control + shift + right/left arrow
---
Well yeah, its just that OP was simultaneously complaining about PvP content that keeps to itself and PvP content that doesnt keep to itself. 
---
And no kidding the wilderness needs danger, every piece of content within it is exclusively designed and balanced around it.
---
Okay well it's irrelevant that the mage arena is in the wilderness because it could just as easily not be the mage arena cape and be the cool Pvm cape. Maybe high end pvm gear should come from high end pvm.
---
Saitama sensei üôè
---
I PKed right up until EoC, it was still alive. Why would you go into deep wilderness if no one was up there? What would you suggest to make the wilderness not dead? Also do you know what anti-Pking is? If you don't fight back obviously you're going to die.
---
They pet hunt and work on the collection log like I do. Or the real crazy ones go for 200m s.
---
Dae dislike people whomst partake in player versus player content on the java game known as Oldschool RuneScape?
---
Great thanks! Will probably try to do some slayer at w330 so I won‚Äôt have to hop
---
The pkers dont propose updates. Pvp updates fail and all the pvm people vote yes for ‚Äúpking‚Äù content where they are the prey. Shit like callisto and wildy altar got 75% yes. Vote no to that shit, pvpers dont care. Its not pkers putting shit into the game, thats for sure.
---
Maybe they didn‚Äôt like the skill?
---
Would you like to tell me if it's logical to vote for stuff that makes the game feel less enjoyable?
---
What happened with pvp vs pvm? I came back to this game 3months ago.  Back in pre-eoc alot of pvmers used to pk from time to time. Atleast in my clan, this debate will only hurt the game long term. 
---
If you dont have a option on a poll, vote skip. Its not that hard. I meet alot of toxic people when bossing and slayer. (And sometimes i can be toxic to, if i had a rough day. But i say sorry when i notice that)
---
Don't forget those pesky spiky party hats
---
There are pots for various skills, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre what you‚Äôre referring to
---
Your thinking of Skilling urns, a pot that is assigned a skill and can be teliported away for extra xp, they are only in runescape 3, not osrs.
---
Hope this helps
---
Pretty good :)
---
Not only items, but services are also possible. I hopped in there on a whim to see if anything wants to do the Fight Pits with me for thee Karamja diary. Within 1 minute someone was there, and before I could tip them they were gone already. Amazing people in there.
---
oh ok, makes sense. what does rag mean in the sense of the use of its name?
---
I‚Äôll be honest, as a pvmer mainly, I don‚Äôt really understand the pvp hate
---
The entire point is that all of the content that is meant to bring PvMers and skillers into the wilderness is either way too powerful, or way to dog shit.
---
People rarely kill ents for example because they're horrible. But people will flock to revs because they're super good even if you get PKed. The problem is, you need to get PKed an absurd amount to turn it into a risk vs reward scenario.
---
Like as soon as you get left alone at revs for like 30 minutes, you could easily make enough profit to die multiple times with straight loss and the odds that you die so often that you give up doing revs after LOSING money is insanely bad. Same goes with Chaos Altar, it's so insanely overpowered that it doesn't matter if you get PKed dozens of times on your way to 99 because you still will save bones and in turn money, still get higher xp/hr and still be able to put less effort in.
---
The entire issue is all getting PKed does at the Chaos Altar is create annoyance for the people taking advantage of it. They aren't looking at the Chaos Altar in a way of risk vs reward. No one has ever had to ask themselves, "is it worth going to the Chaos Altar? You know I can save a bit of money and time but also might get PKed and then is it worth it at all?" Because you LITERALLY save so much time and money and run into PKers so infrequently that pose a legit threat, that you have no reason NOT to do it. That annoyance PKers create in the people doing prayer then makes said people doing prayer just dislike PKing which they end up associating with PvP which then turns into, "PvPers are annoying so I'm going to vote no to their content."
---
In short: Chaos altar has always been way too powerful and PKers existing doesn't get it even close to the alternatives. All the PKers there do is annoy the people training prayer which makes the people training prayer hate PKers who they associate with PvP which in turn they vote no to PvP content because of.
---
Next up you'll be crying that you're splashing in tier 0 mage armour and a water staff against t70 hides and a t75 shield

Uh Id like to let you know there's a 99% chance your kid has seen porn and gore if they have internet access

you're welcome

If you have a offensive display name that violates the TOS, do you really expect to not get reported eventually? And then you call them a snitch and hope it would actually solve something. I really wonder why you even set a username like that. Just to cause controversy among different peoples?
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zalcano/Strategies
---
You basically want your Best Pickaxe/Mining Cape/Varrock armour &gt; Healing Regen &gt; Graceful
---
He's saying if reddit had its way. Considering reddit is completely saturated with people that despise the wilderness and PvP and the prevailing meme is "vote no to every piece of PvP related content", no kidding the wilderness wouldn't exist with them at the wheel.
---
You using the runelite plugin as well?? That is what was making me lag the most there.
---
Just mithseed 4head
---
Once you enter the wilderness without any intention to pk, then the role you takw upon yourself is not a skiller, not a pvmer but bait.
---
Full obby armour + neck is slightly better :) might depend on defence stats, but I don't think it does!
---
Update-as-you-go works with most of Old School‚Äôs content, but here you want to release the complete ‚Äòbase game‚Äô. Don‚Äôt release LMS in early access, I.e a bare bones experience. Take the time to make sure you‚Äôre releasing a fully fleshed out game, you don‚Äôt want to lose players and then find it‚Äôs too late to bring them back.
---
Hahaha cyacyacyacyacya cccccccyaaaaaaaaa
---
Wildy is a big risk/reward area. If you don't take the risk you won't get the reward.
---
It was the credits to the Avengers movie with Chinese subtitles. Nothing illegal going on here
---
Zero self awareness from reddit as per usual
---
You might have to talk to Zooknock/Daero/Narnode!
---
I haven't played since the BFD patch but the assholes I'm talking about are the stupid fuckers that ruin your m+ keys because you ask them to do a mechanic one way and they don't like it or they cause a wipe and then leave. There's a bunch of other shit too but the trade chat/global chat spam now isn't even funny anymore. It's just 4 retards talking about thunderfury and about 100 people falling for the political opinion bait that 10 people lay. 
---
I hope classic WoW "fixes" the community but I doubt it. The people playing retail are going to go play classic when it comes out, some will stay, some will go, but their mentality will bleed over to that game too and the "streamer sickness" is gonna hit classic hard. You already have to make sure you aren't on a big streamers server to enjoy the beta. God help you if you end up on Asmongold's server.
---
 Bandos tassets, chestplate, helm of neitz, firecape, abyssal tentacle, dragon defender, berzerker ring, and amulet of torture is best.
---
so in the gif above u see him being hit by a wizard. If he were to be frozen right there so he couldnt move, he wouldnt be able to hit the wizard.
---
I wish a new skill got released. Nothing to do on the game when u cant get levels.
---
So voting in your own-self interest is how you should always vote?
---
Absolutely top option, but you would want to swap that warrior ring for a berserker (i). You can calculate the dps yourself if you google "bitterkoekje's dps calculator".
---
Sounds like you don't know what spears, tbs, or even ancients are.
---
Bro we both know you are gonna vote no to every poll anyway.
---
Slayer helm gives you %bonus dmg on task (it‚Äôs insanely strong)
---
I was gonna think up some interesting ways to essentially ask for money, perhaps something akin to Statistically Challenged selling jokes and all, just so people that would give me some coin get something out of it idk
---
this reminded me of a time I had a female character on Lineage 2 and people would give me items out of the blue
---
I'd imagine rags, as in tatty clothes
---
Haha I know exactly what you mean. And there's just retards that don't know how to read. I put in capital letters in the group finder that I'm looking to kill the last boss only for a mount run and there's always 1 or 2 people that think we're doing the entire dungeon that cause a scene and leave normally causing the entire party to just fuck off. 
---
And yeah I don't think classic will help much, from what I've seen on reddit and the forums is the classic community are just as retarded and elitist.  I hope classic does well but without new content coming out like OSRS has I don't see it keeping people around once they've done everything.
---
You're a multibot lmfao there's a reason why you don't understand singles pking
---
You're a fucking sheep lmao
---
Be me, average adventurer
---
See some old bag going on about ez magic gains
---
GoodShit.JPG
---
She tells me some weird ass ingredients she needs, a couple veggies, and a fucking rat tail
---
ExcuseMeWTF.zip
---
The veggies are easy, but wtf am I supposed to do to get a rat tail
---
Find a rat next to her house, time to die bich
---
Cut its head off, long ass pale thing slides out
---
Think "welp, that's probably it"
---
MFW it wasn't
---
MFW she used it anyway
---
MFW this big ass pot of potion that was gonna give me mad gains only gives a fraction of the exp
---
MFW it burns to pee now
---
I like your style
---
Hey all!
---
I had a question about crafting lava runes. Right now my magic is not high enough for magic imbue, but I only need a few runecrafting levels ( 47 &gt; 54 ). I had the feeling that lava runes were still the most efficient route with magic imbue, but I wanted to check.
---
Does magic imbue just safe me one inventory slot? Or does the earth talisman get consumed when doing it? 
---
Also if lava runes is not the way to go, to get 54, what other options might there be?
---
You should really check out the by release series on youtube by J1mmy. He completes all of runescapes quests in order of release and only uses items and skills released by then also. Very interesting and entertaining too :D
---
LOL thank you for a good laugh 
---
&gt; "welp, that's probably it"
---
Your drawing is correct. Good example made without making it too difficult to understand for others.
---
Killing a clue maker is a rape? Are you a rapist irl?
---
Ya I'm a pkerman and I'm not voting for the wildy weapons. Seems like a bandaid fix for the overarching problems the wildy seems to be suffering from
---
The morning after I got 99 agility I did.
---
They both sold for 11.75m each.
---
the community literally begged them to hide poll results lmfao
---
Yeah that and 6 hour logout limit prevents anything over that time block.
---
You don't have to have proof to report. That would be entirely silly, how could any player have proof that someone is botting? Like if you'd see a lvl 3 with a name like "a√∂shahf√∂asfha√∂sf025" cutting yews and the only stats they have is woodcutting.
---
Its a video game bud.
---
The chat loot is always the real loot. Pm loot is bonus points.
---
Yeah it's definitely hard to find a balance, especially when players find ways around the risks like just taking an inv and bones and dying when Jagex probably thought they would risk more. Black chins are probably one of the best things they've added to the wilderness. Best xp and gp for hunter but if you keep dying then you get neither. Not really risking gp but you're risking your time if you go there for an hour and keep getting attacked/killed then you were just better off doing reds and the risk didn't really pay off.
---
Disappointing haul!
---
I really enjoyed doing the library puzzles because I wasn't worrying about the damn shades from the temple in mep2. I'm glad they learned from that.
---
Imagine if you got the restores and then went in only to realise you have strength pots not brews :/
---
The challenge **IS** surviving Zuk/Jad. It's exactly the way it was designed, all the way back to the original fire cape release. 
---
They don't want you to land a lucky shot when you are dying and pretend like you completed the challenge. Even if you survive but die to a healer before you tele'd out you haven't bested the fight caves have you?
---
5-6k ea without all the uniques, including accorns and key parts/shards
---
You really think a majority of people make $40/hr?? Lmao.. Ty for the laugh
---
They are like what boomers are to the rest of Reddit
---
I thought it was around 3-5k
---
Try unchecking the box and check it again. Sounds stupid but it worked for me.
---
Also it's a lot cheaper than $163 if they use 3rd party for gold and really no chance of ban unless you admit it or some shit in game
---
Yeah, I just realized that and edited my comment.   https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crop_running#Herb_run  That might be what you are looking for in terms of going over farming(at least a herb run) a little bit.  You can also look over the wiki for some good moneymaking ideas.  Things like tanning dhide and collecting mort myre fungus come to mind as things that dont need very high reqs and are good money.  The downside being they require a bit of focus and give no exp.   
---
As for until you get to members, just level what stats you can for now.  If you plan on afking to make money then the most AFK moeny skill (imo) would probably be fishing at higher levels so you could work on getting your fishing up.  Especially since the exp rates are about the same up until the 60's regardless of member or F2P.
---
Except magic was OP as fuck in classic. Armor didn't have negative attack bonuses so you just fucked people over while wearing full rune.
---
[deleted]
---
42k no votes, about 7k max players. That‚Äôs average 6 accounts per player. For reference I did not even bind my one other account for the poll. I think people really just irrationally blame whatever scapegoat over this kind of thing involving massive groups.
---
Add a skill that you can only train in wilderness.
---
5fps gifs are literally unwatchable too
---
na eoc is still trash and is what put the nail in the coffin for me. The simple combat we have is a huge part of RS. EoC does not feel like RS.
---
High priority problem right here
---
F.  He's one of my favorites, but I dont think I'll get him.  Congrats though, Ironman luck is real!  Goodluck with the HCIM too, dont die to anything stupid :)
---
GEABONNEERD
---
Well when i trained to 70 prayer i saw multiple pker vs pker fights near the burning ammy tele spot. Im not a pker myself.
---
There's no thrill in escaping, it's a nuisance that there's someone that has nothing better to do than be an annoying little cunt and kill someone that wants nothing to do with your pathetic little life.
---
Yeah, the price isn't going to drop dramatically in a couple days, might even rise. Don't instabuy and instasell it though
---
Have to keep in mind ToB gp/h is down to 8.4m. Scythe will continue tanking.
---
Not really, but barb fishing is still better afk exp by a good bit iirc if your a member anyways.
---
But no agility and strenght exp homie
---
Thanks man! He is cool, however that probably is my RNG gone forever now lol
---
Not in the inferno its not...
---
Right click&gt;bank at a banker allows you to access the bank quicker as you can one tile closer (think GE and how you won‚Äôt move right clicking exchange/bank). Saves a tick apparently at some banks doing some activities.
---
You‚Äôre half way there!
---
Is [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/i2WULom) the account I‚Äôm looking for?
---
yikes
---
Already tried
---
Idk, i've seen some crazy luck on ironmen, I dont think you've used all of it up quite yet.
---
Thats actually a great idea.
---
Misclicking isnt bad luck lmao
---
Not forced into the wild but we are forced into ending our streaks?
---
Is there any reason for this post in 2019?
---
Yeah you're right, I realised that during my run but I just got what I saw on some guides. Wouldn't get them again
---
got me lmaoo
---
Accurate. I ain't got time for crystal bow bs.
---
A juicy noob carrying their bank or an inv of glories though...
---
Ever since the death mechanics got changed to easy mode its been heading that way.
---
damn you are a sad person
---
Thanks! I just keep looking at it haha. It's something I've thought was cool basically all the way back to when I started in 2006, never really thought I'd actually have one!
---
Pro move
---
I absolutely hate defender. You're the official 'Item Dropper.' I run in the same pattern dropping every food and then a little extra of what's called out. Dumbest, most boring role in BA.
---
Only 1 world where you can play lms. (If its crowded you cant farm.)
---
Oh big oof!! Didnt know that, poor fella.
---
Straw man.
---
Mournings end part 4
---
last night i found a level 78 at fire giants carrying 1.6m. literally an hour after we killed a level 126 for guthans and a whip at fire giants. both of these guys were only wearing hides and a weapon
---
How do I do that?
---
How do I join that?
---
Just add some new pvp spec weps. 
---
Or maybe a staff that considers mage pray for maxhit.
---
I hate that Jagex is constantly trying to push people into the wilderness, but doesn't do anything about mains being uncompetitive if they aren't maxed. Since I didn't specifically design my account to PvP, I literally have no way of engaging in PvP
---
If you want to engage in PvP, you should have to switch to a PvP world, because nothing pisses me off more than nearly completing a clue scroll or running to abyss runecrafting just to have some mouth-breather tell me "yOu sHoULdN't pLaY tHe gAmE iF yOuRe ScArEd tO dIe!!1!"
---
If PvPers can say that, then I can say that they're killing and strangling that part of the game.
---
agreed. pvm only here, but i'd actually consider fighting back if it wasnt a 10v1 jump every time. bonus points for the "sit kid" asshole that always seems to be part of the group.
---
Just laughed I thought I‚Äôd die trying I‚Äôm not bothered about the hardcore status never limited any content used Wiley altar etc only started as hc to see how far I made it doing stupid stuff
---
Your statement makes zero sense lmao
---
Honestly
---
It‚Äôs definitely closer to what armour looked like which is what they meant lol
---
not sure why you're being downvoted, he killed the end boss in the challenge and still didn't get the cape.
---
This game is so full of entitled children nowadays it‚Äôs insane. Imagine getting upset that you died in an MMO in a pvp area. Your parents kinda failed.
---
Only cbow. If you have another bow there's still the chance you're a noob with like 1k arrows on you.
---
Cbow and hides you know you're getting nothing other than potentially losing a couple of food yourself. It is -the- rag setup, if you're out to annoy someone, that's what you wear. I wouldn't go out of my way to attack that unless I was incredibly bored.
---
Because going into the wilderness has risks. If you don‚Äôt want to take that risk, then don‚Äôt go in and don‚Äôt cry on Reddit when I kill you in the wild haha
---
Yea runite armour looks like trash and so does mith and adamant. But you look at white and black knight armour and tell me that looks like shit compared to a palette swapped version of bronze-runite
---
Yeah, thank god nobody in the OSRS team likes to put in shitty high fantasy models that completely clash with the artstyle of the game
---
Firemaking and cooking are super quick. All the combat skills are quick and easy, my first was hp followed by ranged.
---
It‚Äôs one of the options next to your friends list, log out button etc. Click ‚ÄúJoin clan chat‚Äù, type ‚ÄúOSRS SOA‚Äù. To type in the clan chat you start your messages in the chat with‚Äù/‚Äú.
---
ssh into your new phishing server
---
   wget https://runelite.net/ &gt; /var/www/html/index.html
---
Put in link to dodgy keylogger version.
---
Done.
---
Ahh shoot in too low level =( never mind.
---
Split I tracerteed.
---
what if they just karate-chop you right in the middle?
---
Friends? What's that?
---
But this would create a dynamic where pvpers would be able to vote in updates that make them even stronger against pvmers in the wilderness. If the wildy was only a place where pker vs pker (not pker vs pvmer)  took place then this would be a good idea but jagex have created a food chain system now that is most of the reason for the toxicity between communities.
---
his info jives with my experience.
---
As it's own game I agree, but to see runescape turn into it was disheartening. Devs didn't realize what they had
---
Just looking at that image on the right gives me eye cancer
---
Did anything about monster mage def change?
---
Why
---
I‚Äôll help you do it. What‚Äôs your username?
---
That creates a scenario where you will never be able to play with your clan mates/ friends for fun. Is the prestige worth that trade off?
---
Are those third age nunchucks
---
Unlike the popular believe on Reddit, the wilderness is far from dying.
---
Little button next to the friends list with faces on  it.
---
Then some pker saw the post and went to skulltrick him
---
Also f, but smaller.
---
What I do is,
---
Use the cave entrance so you're at the safespot next to the rope in the dungeon. Logout. Exit client. Restart client. Boom. Lag reduced. I only lag when I have to load the map chunks when I go to the extreme boundaries of the demonics, so I tend to stay in 1 area.
---
I see, thanks!
---
Nostalgiastu
---
Thanks =)
---
I've used both and they're pretty safe. People are downvoting because they either consider it op or don't know anything about them and think they're bad just because they're not runelite.
---
Those stats hurt my soul.
---
If you‚Äôre still doing clues in the wildy then you probably can‚Äôt afford 94 mage for venge
---
yeah it doesn't, its mimicking the statement above
---
congrats man!!!
---
Uh... World PvP in WoW? The most popular MMO in history?
---
The thing is as far as the cluttered screen you can make your interface as intense or as simplistic as you want
---
You are a funny man
---
It takes a lot longer than 30 seconds to fill an inventory even at 99 fishing. Over a minute at least, especially at lower levels. 
---
Banking can get ridiculously fast with the right teleports. Karamja Gloves + Quest cape takes just a few seconds and 8 clicks.
---
Rs3 is only laughing stock for /r/2007scape and I dont think this subreddit is everyone. I personally quit rs since I had done almost everything there was in 2008 (could wear dragon armour and make magic bows etc.) and I liked combat above everything in all games and combat was god awfull in rs. It was so fucking boring. 
---
 
---
I came back to rs in 2017 and kept playing since the combat was actually fun and exciting and not a snooze fest like it still is in osrs.
---
pking is theft an you're making shit rationalizations which would be insane irl
---
its fine its theft, its a game duh
---
Somebody tell him
---
:)
---
Dude. Player killing or player versus player. Who tf cares what its called? It both describes the act of someone getting fucked
---
Is there even enough space to set up a cannon in the middle section
---
I voted no on pvp polls, come at me bois! Devour me alive
---
Shhh don‚Äôt being your logic into this sub. They hate that
---
Pretty sure they means via the abyss.
---
Either way they can't bring a bow.
---
Tried this and lost my crystal bow, what should I do now?
---
Runemake and agility bad
---
Slayer and swampman good
---
So how exactly is RS3 is a WoW clone? It plays nothing like WoW, hell it plays exactly like OSRS still in almost the exact same game world as most areas the two versions share are still identical barring graphical changes.
---
Maybe make it two wprlds if enough ppl play ajust amount of worlds according to usage of minigame. Aint too hard.
---
Egg cracking bad, skull stabbing good
---
UwU
---
What happened to the POH advertisement board idea???
---
This would only happen to oda haha
---
You be surprise
---
Sadly I only gave arcanists and that mining game a try.
---
‚Äúnothing personnel, kid‚Äù
---
listen the puzzles were fun and challenging and all but there was still padding to it, you can't deny that. the sheer size of the maze and the fact that you don't get a map with obstacles meant i couldn't properly plan a solution, i ended up wasting so much time just running around pointlessly to do things like check what pillars are in some area and not solving the puzzle
---
I was more pissed that they made the dragons, fairies, goblins, and other creatures more of a fantasy artstyle. Like wtf? Give me my ultra realistic blocky 480p fantasy role playing game!
---
Ye, my 60 atk pure has 55. I should have put a /s on the above post.
---
Staffs is actually correct.
---
reddit is just an echo chamber for stupid toxicity
---
Any meme on Facebook has already been beaten dead at least 6 to 15 times on this sub.
---
Not everyone knows this but the orange circles drain energy also. You can really stretch out your stamina pots if you are careful. They dont drain energy when they are still hitting zeros though iirc
---
Lolno
---
Tweet this to Ash or something, this is exactly what many players want
---
Are you surprised that a community that's constantly marginalized, belittled, and has all their content voted down would be a little butthurt?
---
People that you pay to hang out with you.
---
Sure am!
---
Another grandmaster quest/new city. They mentioned plans for Slepe and the Myreque quest line in Thursday's stream, and have also spoken about DT II for years. These could unlock Darkmeyer/Menaphos, respectively. 
---
What I would like to see though, is a major skilling rejuvenation update, affecting both PvM drop tables and skills themselves. Although I respect that such an update would require great effort whilst lacking some advertising potential.
---
Logic is the bis weapon against them though.
---
I did like the new platelegs sometimes.
---
Your ranged level is a bit low for DS2 so the fights might take a few attempts
---
If you suck at PvM (don't worry, lots of us do) those are tiiiiiiiiny bit low, but still very doable. DS2 is about proper movement during the boss fight and uses a Rune Crossbow with Ruby bolts, while MM2 is about getting the boss cheese right. Higher stats give you more wiggle room, but lots of players get those quests done around your levels.

How DARE you say something that is not completely thrashing rs3?!? /s
---
But I agree yeah.
---
stay with your unique account. 46 is beautiful and you worked really hard. i love pures and would hate to see you ruin it.
---
Oh cool I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about :L

Great thanks for including that bro. Makes a lot of sense to do it that way.

What's the n icon under slayer?
---
How does someone opt in to being prey? If you enter the wild you are a pker, bring appropriate gear or other, better pkers will kill you.
---
Yeah fair enough dude I dont mind some of the graphics but the giant pets that take up a quarter of my screen and flap around and the teleport animations that last 10 full seconds can be pretty terrible

Dragon darts and rng will do it, but if u can, tag atleast 1-2 healers, would make ur job quicker.

What kind of a chad needs protection lmfao

So you want to be able to take all your skilling supplies and have full gear/food to fight back? You can't have it both ways. That's like if someone was taking max switches to cox/tob and then complains they don't have enough space for food/supplies. You choose how to set up your gear/invy. No one says you have to be efficient taking tar/herbs but you choose to do so. Of course the pkers is better at pking than a pvmer if that's what they mostly do. Skull tricks are 100% avoidable if you know what you're doing. If it's your first time in the wildy then ya you might panic and accidentally skull trick but jagex has already made it easier to not get skull trick by enabling you to hide your attack options. The reason a team might come in to attack you is because of how hard it can be to kill a pvmer. 
---
There's plenty of guys doing chins in ely,arma,sotd,spectral that are near impossible to kill. I've focused them myself in full ancestral/arma with a team while they were full tbed. They understand how to tank and 9/10 times they get out alive. They've done their homework and know what gear/invy setup works best to tank one guy or 20 guys. You can do the same if you did a bit of research.
---
Agreed. Please also post on the RS3 subreddit. My biggest complain is the helm.

Yeah I‚Äôm not good at at, drops like that get close to costing me money cuz I use so many supplies

Possibly. Don't click any links from your viewers, odds are they're looking for easy pickings with ip grabbers if you got low number of viewers.

To make sure yt/gyazo/imgur/etc links are legit, just copy the end of the link after the .com/ and type the beginning yourself + paste the rest
---
Lol noob
---
Yet people will still lose their shit if you suggest *very mild* progressive RNG could make for a more balanced experience by reducing instances of extreme bad luck.
---
The thing is it's not super high risk. I've mentioned in another comment that the meta for the chaos altar is bringing one inventory of bones and then suiciding. That risks 0 coins and what, 20 dragon bones? Nobody risks any gear for pvm, usually not even 3/4 iteming, because of skull tricking. You risk more at places like Vorkath where you pay GP to die.
---
Basically, I just want all PvP to be it's one separate thing. Go to the wild to do clan fights, go to LMS for unique pvp (and risky since you pay to get in), go to the duel arena to do risk fights. Luring in easy targets to the wild with broken strong content like the chaos altar is just bad design.
---
I totally forgot about this game and now I‚Äôm sad that it‚Äôs gone
---
r/ironscape
---
I mean I typically don‚Äôt transfer because I‚Äôll use that money made afk skilling for skills I gotta buy later on, but it‚Äôs completely feasible to transfer if you want. I personally just enjoy Level 3 skilling, I think it‚Äôs a neat account build and I enjoy flexing the fashionscape. If you‚Äôre reallllly curious about Level 3s I‚Äôd recommend looking up ‚ÄúLvl3Scape‚Äù on YouTube. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs still making videos, but he‚Äôs got about 68 or so uploaded videos on his level 3 skiller.
---
Didn‚Äôt have to be mean :(
---
The dudes LEARNING vorkath. Being bad is part of learning. Give him a break...
---
Yeah but every single video he barely stretches over the ten minute mark, it's quite obvious he's doing it
---
People would do it while risking as little as possible (ie probably nothing)
---
Hahahha amazing :)
---
I mean, private servers are also deleted periodically. Has there been a private server that's been up for more than 2 years?
---
I don't really get why people have a problem with going into the wilderness for a clue. I've never once thought to myself, "Please don't give me a wildy clue" nor do I have a problem if a lvl 90 wants to flex on me (119) in deep wildy while I'm only carrying a dds, spade and clue. It takes 3 minutes to get back there. Not really inconvenient. People bank stand for 3 hours then complain that dying in wildy while doing a clue is inefficient. I don't get it.
---
I played darkscape more than any other version of the game, that shit was so fun. The only time I ever did mid-end game questing
---
Do you guys have a discord
---
It's not a blurred line.  One way safespots in PvP shouldn't be a thing.  You're making pointless comparisons to a NES game that wasn't meant for updates.  The great thing about modern games is the ability to update and patch away bugs that aren't are detrimental to the game.  It's especially great when the only people it actually hurts are ones that use cheat clients to show one way safespots.
---
It's getting implemented anyways, with or without rewards and the rewards are almost 0 dev time.   
---
Let me guess ur hcim died to a pker?
---
If everyone voted like this its likely nothing would ever pass a poll especially with the 75% threshold. Also as much as you think it won't affect you a dying PvP scene because all the updates got voted no to is going to affect the overall number of players and health of the game long term.
---
"just"
---
Yup lool
---
i've been doing solo corp too, only 170 kc so way far behind you. Can you give me some explanations why people bring warrior helm and barrows/ferocius gloves while still wearing voids?
---
Not to my knowledge, no.

Oh wow this is the first time I‚Äôve actually seen this room, I‚Äôve been inactive for awhile. People are okay with this art style?

Does imbued heart 1 kc count?

This is the most efficient way to do it. Crystal bow raghing is the funniest way to do it.

Grats but damn I‚Äôm so salty 1 account 99 and another 80 no pet either. Please give.
---
PvP stands for Player versus Player. Both sides are fighting each other.
---
PKing stands for Player killing. Only 1 side is fighting.
---
We do ,but can't post the link here. U will find it in our forums threads or u can join  ParadoxCC  clan-chat in game and ask one of the stars to inv to the discord server
---
Happens in Keldagrim too :(
---
In this instance, the game didn't force you to go to the wilderness but more of you were too lazy to do an actual slayer task before to get slayer points or to go to another slayer master to reset the task.
---
I thought it worked that way too.  After doing many suicide runs to test the armor, I found out it was the upgrades themselves that gave the damage reduction, not the actual armor set.   Saving food until last is very smart =) to save time picking them up, I just do it this way in case I get unlucky with fishing spot.
---
Ever watch an EVscape vid? Dude literally talks slow to hit the 10mins. I mean these people provide content in a relatively low popularity game where the amount of things to do is finite. The fact that YouTube has limitations set on the ways to make money is why the creators do what they do. Hence why you see Raid sponsored ads in every other video
---
Shit you actually went against the OSRS circlejerk. What a madman!
---
i didn‚Äôt click anything that night, but probably have in the past. there were definitely some shady clan people in the stream the night before. thanks!
---
stop watching his boring videos lol
---
Nope, I think on PC it's only on 3rd party clients too
---
Helping the noobies! Great job upvoted.
---
Do you know what is most profitable with Crystal shards? I've got about 600 from gauntlet atm
---
Thats how MTX's entered the game though.
---
Completely agree. The armor in the image does look like it could of been done better, but RS3 is way more aesthetically pleasing than OSRS. If we could have HD graphics with the OSRS game it would be perfect. EoC alone is the problem and it doesn‚Äôt feel like RuneScape anymore. The graphics update was actually pretty cool.
---
Where can you buy this kind of service?
---
I do hope that OSRS does graphically update eventually, but in a way that retains its charm. I really hate terms like nostalgic and iconic, it feels like accepting to never change, but I'd like OSRS to one day form it's own identity so you could just call it Runescape instead of always be tied to RS3 with the old school moniker. I'd never want this game to look like modern games but I'd want a bit of change, visually, every once in a while and done with subtlety and respect to its roots.
---
"Call of duty is more realistic then battlefield" - 10 year old
---
They had push back and fall off every step of the way. When classic to rs2, a lot of players opted for rsc. In rs2 they removed the wilderness, players quit, protesting for it back, and when we did, we came back. Then they removed free trade. Again, same thing, we got it back. Then chaotics and curses, okay sure whatever, we don't like it, but whatever. 
---
If they just listened to their player base, the game would be so much better for rs2 and rs3 players. A cool updated world, without all the overloaded cosemetic payable bullshit. 
---
They sure did follow that WoW path though. Keep updates no one asked for until your game starts dying.
---
Sounds good. Got a few friends that might come with me depending on how we like the clan.
---
Fuck man. It sucks if you were attacked by some pussy bitch DDOSer. Hope you get a big pk to make up the loses bro
---
It ain't griefing, though. You're in the only pvp area in the game and you're suprised you die?
---
They shouldn't exist because there is no reason for them to be there. Pkers should have no issue fighting other pkers, yet here I am getting literally dozens of angry pkers replying to me about how idiotic it is. I see that as strong evidence there is a majority of pkers that don't want actual pvp - they want a walking bag of loot to smack down for no effort. If you love pvp then more actual geared pkers to fight should be a good thing - why do so many act like it's a bad thing?
---

Imagine waking up and getting so upset about this that you need to post to reddit even though it's been done a hundred times over... Seriously, you guys need to move on what the hell do you care, this is a sub for OSRS and this isn't in OSRS it's in RS3 so what are you so upset about?
---
Downvote me to hell, keep getting all butt hurt about a 15 year old game, do nothing with your life if you so choose, whatever.
---
A real shame

Dang, that stinks.

Well deserved. The grind paid off looks like you've put countless hours in and it was worth it. That kind of dedication gets you somewhere.
---
OSRS warding fork, splits the timeline and game network. Who would play the shittier version?
---
Bastion potions arent worh it
---
this update was the reason i quit rs3
---
Exactly, like why am I going to go out and put in this hard work for a pet, just to get ganked every two kills or so, and whose to say that when you do finally get it you won't be killed right after and lose it. His pet is dope but it still has a low drop rate. Like give it a higher drop rate if it's in multicombat wildy.
---
If we never had EOC. We'd never have this conversation.  I remember when I was one of very few players still on rsc. I though I'd hate rs2, ended up loving it. Rs3 would have been the same, but many others including myself can not deal with pet dragons and fairy wings and the same comestic garbage everywhere. It feels like every korean mmo ever.
---
Selling traps 6k ea
---
ah makes sense - thanks guys.
---
Your the real mvp.... didn‚Äôt know I could do that.
---
Lmao OSRS style is not more realistic.
---
Something wrong with it? Never seen anybody complain about it.
---
PvP is dying because when they wanted to lower the barrier to entry for new pkers, the small elite group threw an absolute fit. No one wants to lose 50 gmauls trying to learn how to pk. It‚Äôs basically become predator vs. prey. The only aspect I liked about pvp was clan wars in the wilderness and except for Saturday‚Äôs that scene is completely dead
---
Yea, problem with osrs is that there is plenty of worlds you can kill revs on so it's easier to hop than to compete for resources. Big clans can just sit in high total worlds and aren't really encouraged to go to other worlds since that's more profit and easier than hopping. 
---
I think revs should have a type of depletion mechanic or something so that you can't stay on the same world forever. I'm not sure how it would be balanced but the basic idea is revs would stop spawning after killing so many and you would have to look for a new world. One way would be limit the number of worlds with revs on them to say like 40 and as you kill all the revs on 1 world they will move to a different world. Another way would be have them run out and replenish after a long cooldown like 1 day or 1 week. There's other ways but the idea would be to make revs a resource. That's what gets clans to fight.
---
Its way more than 2000 hours unless you're 0-999 Telos and spinning your way to 5.4
---
Yeah, do that. Suffering saved my zulrah career too, so good. I died so much to forgetting recoils and recoils breaking.
---
Just means using your time to waste someone elses. Has nothing to do with no risk as u can rag in max gear. Its just often done in no risk
---
Goodjob
---
Any one of those things could‚Äôve been 3a and you‚Äôre silly if you pretend otherwise
---
Actually you do the second you enter the wilderness.  That's what the warning is for.
---
Idk the more I look at it, it looks kinda like a lot of the newer content. It just caught me off guard for some reason.
---
The helmet is very weird but the rest of the armour is good.
---
I personally like the fact that certain pvm situations put you in danger of other players. It spices things up and forces you to adapt and hold your own. It can definitely be frustrating but I honestly think it brings a lot of life to the game. Last time Jagex got rid of the wilderness, everyone demanded to have it back.
---
Inflation won‚Äôt fuck you as bad as an update nerfing your gear or releasing new BiSs.
---
people vote out of self interest. lots of new things have made it into the game.
---
problem is pkers represent &lt;5% of the playerbase.
---
It's so slow
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt they be there? Pvpers do the bosses/skilling too? Lol again it‚Äôs risk/reward you just want the risk taken out of it. You DO NOT have to go in the wilderness at all and won‚Äôt be barred from any content so why are you so mad
---
It's not about rewards.
---
When I played I used to run around trying to kill everyone except pkers because I'm not fast enough to keep up with those fucks.
---
I went into wild with the mindset I'd be losing money but it's a fun way to break up the monatoney of skilling or slayer.
---
And honestly the meme advice of 'if you go to wild , expect to get attacked' is true. 
---
You don't know what someone is carrying
---
I‚Äôm never surprised when I die in the wilderness but I‚Äôm still annoyed. Annoyed in the same way getting crashed on task annoys me. I mainly go into wildy for bosses when assigned by duradel but I‚Äôve been cancelling Callisto tasks because I can rarely make it through a kill without 1-2 skulled people logging in right next to me. Which tells me some of you just target people who aren‚Äôt looking to fight you. I can get away almost every time but it‚Äôs still just like getting crashed which pisses off pretty much every PVMer. 
---
As for polls I don‚Äôt vote on PVP because I don‚Äôt actively PVP. In the US we aren‚Äôt a true democracy because sometimes the minority needs to be protected from the majority.
---

This threads hilarious, can you imagine making a post like this 3-4 years ago?   You'd get laughed at
---
And this is why you kill ALL ppl in the wild
---
thank you for your invaluable input to this discussion
---
That's why we have the makeover mage.
---
I will also never understand why they thought it would be a good idea to make weird alien-like physiques. (RS3 models)
---
It totally does
---
Yep but that's not exactly useful. You only need to do BA faster.. to get level 5 roles for diary. The only reason to do the minigame past that is for pet hunters.
---
I'm making an alt Reddit account named dingusbuddydave
---
Both sides could technically fight but one would rather try to run back to the ditch soooooooo
---
What if you're both? Im a much better pvmer than pvper but I equally enjoy them. I hope when lms comes out of beta many pvmers will try it. It's what got me more into pvp
---
I'm also waiting till I get Nieve so that the first few levels go quite fast
---
Well they weren't trying to capture their own audience. They wanted to appeal to WoW and LoL players.
---
How about you don't force pvpers to do pvm and questing and skilling content to acheive bis
---
NOPE, the vanilla wow world was the best and you don't know shit about wow.
---
Hmm, I just 3 item with spade/clue/dscim, but this seems like a decent idea, even if it does put ma precious spade at risk.

Same reason that RS3 blows on so many other levels; jagex not listening to the players.
---
Definitley

Right that‚Äôs the plan but I‚Äôm tired of doing boring tasks with 0 reward. I‚Äôm looking for peoples suggestions of things they‚Äôve blocked and been happy with.

You guys have phones right?
---
Thank god we don't have to see your runecrafting level.
---
Speak for yourself, you melodramatic. Stop caring what the majority of reddit thinks and grow some skin.
---
You're so fucking dense
---
Just a bad drop, I feel like Maybe you should try it on PC.
---
Graniteboi build
---
Wait until you realize that reddit determines every single update and controls the game :)
---
I‚Äôm legit not. How hard is it to get a clue box. I do it all the time, and dont see what the big deal is.
---
As a retired pker I can confirm, I ain't touching this shit
---
D chain flex what an alpha
---
Reddit always has to find a scapegoat for who voted "no" on updates they want
---
I finally broke &lt;1:00 a couple days ago lol. This is nuts!
---
I did the lavas from 44 to 99 rc. Try it, its really rewarding.
---
I can out DPS the healers with dragon darts and blowpipe at 87 range on slayer task really easily.. if thats a helpful reference point at all
---
Not laggy if you live in the US, that‚Äôs the point of the rota.
---
I think it depends what level of the wilderness you are in if the rune gloves get converted into coins or not.

Definitely a maybe. Unfortunately I am a poor scrub so I can‚Äôt answer. Will look back for an answer once the pros chime in. Good luck!
---
I never called it bad. I just said it‚Äôs not as good as it used to be
---
osrs wouldnt exist without the pk community
---
I would keep it if you plan on training Slayer
---
The stupidity of a few random PKers skulling for a 1/10000 chance at loot is not indicative of most pkers. 
---
Looking like you have something to hide to an idiot is better than confirming to everyone you have stuff worth an ice barrage
---
It would be cool if revs only spawned on a few worlds at a time
---
....Wait...what do you think work is?
---
Okay then genius its laggy for yanks in Eu rotation then? Point is half of the playerbase is always out of the rota and therefore needs another world to pk in
---
And for the other rewards (and because it's fun...)
---
1 bad drop, I have 950ish kills and it's a solid 2-3m/h
---
same.  i also heard just plain bad lies about eoc beta, including from my clan something like "it takes 5 minutes to kill a goblin and  i have max combat" hopped to my main which is still not this day maxed(still working on it along with osrs side at same acc) to test, huh that was a blatant lie, tested multiple things that i saw people testing and again just blatant lies!
---
There's a couple icons there I don't recognize and I think that's a good thing.
---
If you're not an ironman, you can just buy a death talisman. If you're an ironman, you can get 90 slayer and get one from a dark beast. Check the bookcase in your POH, although I don't think it'll be there if you've never picked it up.
---
You could also try Rendi's method of getting into morytania without completing the prereq quests, although thats bug abuse so I wouldn't recommend it
---
Something with the 1-time 7day free membership for mobile players being redeemable multiple times somehow. I dont do it and dont wanna give people ideas but its rightfully where the blame should be
---
My man, most PKers wanted warding. Easier access to total worlds, easier way to imbue rings and a purposefully made cheap wilderness rune pouch.
---
I remember when my dumb-ass opened a hard casket in the wildy, and got a Zammy Page 1. Got entangled and teleblocked by the lever and died.  
---
My first thought was "fucking T Bone why the fuck did you open that casket up". GG to whomever killed me.
---
What is MSB (i)?  I'm wearing: Iban's, tome of fire, Occult, Neitiznot, blessed dhide body, legs, and boots, zerker ring (i), barrows gloves - then using dragon dagger spec on the mage and finishing with blowpipe, switching to whip and drag defender for loot potential.
---
I don't know all their names yet, but the route I'm going is NE &gt; SE &gt; S &gt; SW &gt; SE &gt; Middle.  I skip the dungeon entrance and do it last. I pray melee on all but the archer and mage and use their respective prayers. Then I go to clan wars to reset and start over.
---
So you're saying instead I should bring def gear and not pray on some of them? Which ones (by mound spot if you can)? I don't really have tank gear right now, just fighter torso and obby legs. What should I bring at 72 def?

But why not? That's such a selfish perpesective, it doesn't affect you in the slightest if you don't participate in it. So why would you want to deny it to others just for the sake of it?
---
Now there you go being the one that actually implies things. I've actually never lost anything in the wilderness because I don't bring anything when I go there, but anybody who doesn't like the current state of the wilderness is just a salty skiller/pvmer that lost stuff right?
---
And you clearly are threatened, as are a lot of people judging by all the replies I've been getting. 
---
If pvp in the wilderness was so great it would be able to stand on it's own, it wouldn't need to be propped up by all the overpowered junk that's been put in there to lure in people that have no interest in pvp. If wilderness pvp is so great then there should be plenty of pkers in there all the time playing for fun or other pker's loot, regardless of any other content in there.

Im not very familiar with "west"

i was speaking from experience at chaos alter/temple bosses lavas and black chins, what i always see is ghostly/salad neit, with an ancient staff at best with an inventory of light balista/rcb/maul. i dont think these people will ever get better or stand a chance in BH/pvp worlds.

I had a guy anti pking at wildy altar last night who, despite being a super toxic boy who told me to kms like 5 times, was better at switching than almost every pker I've ever though. tick switching to his dinhs and ballista to hit. It was so fun, I actually kept coming back to fight him until he eventually killed me.

What use do they have I got one already should I alch them?

Until those suffocate the game to the point where it doesn‚Äôt profit what it used to. You can only milk a cow so long before you need to find something else. Most businesses would kill for the longevity that osrs has had, other businesses would kill for that
---
I felt kinda bad for pvpers, then I got killed 6 times in a row hunting black lizards and I thought "huh maybe not"

That's why the cut version of those and red topaz are actually worth more cut.

Not quite. Non-pkers are forced into the wilderness by jagex putting content exclusively there. They are forced into a gameplay scenario they don‚Äôt want to be in because of the game design
---
click on the booth instead of the banker you donut

I've always wondered, why don't people just use the stab option on arclight?

Mage Arena is more like low risk high reward if you're not an idiot and have protect from magic and turn off player left click attack. You just need the staff and 100 casts, which is 60k or so (and you can reduce risk by bringing less casts and makong multiple trips), and in return you get the second best mage cape.
---
Even MA2 is low risk if you find the bosses first (I healed with wines too, so an entire inventory was like 80gp) and then go grab your equipment, I used less than 40 casts per boss and wore Xeracian robes and rune gloves. Including the food and prayer pot for the fight I was probably risking 80k total for bis mage cape.

Git gud

If you‚Äôre using runelite (it sounds like you are) you may want to join their discord and ask in the support channel
---
It's one of the worst skills in the game (along with agility and mining) until level 77 and after that it barely gets faster but is afk half the time doing it. Still takes like 300 hours but it's not as click-heavy as normal rc
---
quik maf
---
the one tick saved is cancelled out by the fact you have to right click
---
Why?
---
Yeah I get that, I'm fairly new to actually using Reddit, and hadn't seen it before. Oh well.
---
It has some inherent flaws that would be abused hard. 
---
Like penalty tricking. (Fight someone while target then die once you arent target anymore he gets penalty and can't use protect item = +1)
---
The reason this shit wasn't abused to the max is because ppl weren't organized enough. 
---
Also would be a clan fest.

No, well kinda, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some of the guy on the bottom left in the icon in the top right. But really he goes more with Netflix, he‚Äôs from Fate Apocrypha.

I like the concept of ironman a lot. I‚Äôm a main and I actually play like an ironman for many things. But to be an actual ironman means grinding 10s of hours filling buckets of sand and other tedious tasks. And thats something I personally cant commit to. 
---
Play how you want :)

I still miss the old days when Alkan would make 2-3 videos a day podcast-style, just talking about random stuff and things going on in his life. Now it feels like every content creator has no life outside of the game and never talks about rl stuff unless it‚Äôs to explain a delay in the upload schedule.

I‚Äôve pked for thousands of hours and I can guarantee you‚Äôve not pked more than 5 hours. Get off your high horse

I see you're a man of culture as well with that  astolfo

I would suggest you A. Don't buy gold again, if you must buy bonds.  It's unlikely that your account gets banned but it could and buying more gold only increases that chance even if it is slight. B.  Continue to grind on your main until you can do Vorkath or Zulrah then you can fund both accounts easily.

Someone REALLY wanted it for fashionscape I guess

Just luck with the ruby e bolt procs. When your low level you just have to keep trying till ring is in your favor during the galvek fight

Hard agree. I have quit til further notice. If the poll doesn‚Äôt pass. They NEED to add integrity changes or I‚Äôm never coming back. I never say this too... it really fucking sucks.

If you don‚Äôt have your attack option to right click by now you kinda deserve it. It‚Äôs common sense which unfortunately is not so common.
---
Did you watch the video?

You make it a rare in a way other than wins. Most improved scales, or MVP scaling.

Sounds like a win win for jamflox, Having some members of the community buying 25 bonds is insane but possible.(stonks)

The arclight has such low bonuses that the buff from Void is actually less than the buff you'd get from a warrior helm
---
iirc
---
Somewhat of another self-limitation similar to hardcore accounts. This time, seeing how far you can get into the game without leveling any combat skills.
---
Also, easy money maker since you do not need to gear your toon with pricey armor/weapons constantly. 
---
I leveled my lvl 3 skiller on RS3  and made it a 1 def pure. I now regret it very much. If you can take my advice from someone who has been in your place and has leveled his lvl 3 skiller... What I have learned is to NEVER LEVEL YOUR ACCOUNT. Remake a new account. Keep your 3 for the future.
---
The crystal crown would still be 250m, i doubt anyone who actually thinks bout buying one cares
---
Not our fault that people spite vote pkers over losing a spade... what do you expect Jagex to do? The community is dying by the hand of people who are hating our whole group for something that a minority does. Pking is far more than just people hunting people for no reason regardless of what reddit would tell you. üòï

the 10s teleport animations are only visible if you do the home teleport(should be changed into lodestone teleport) (in osrs this is either do a circle, you sit down, read a book and then you teleport away or then cow kicks you), if you do the traditional ones that uses runes then the character is away in 1-2 seconds, just like in osrs and really don't have possibly to change other than the spell book, the ancient uses the purple squares makes rectangle (like osrs) and lunar makes that there is purple ring above your character, and then your character looks at it, not even joking, thats literally it https://i.imgur.com/1owHfL4.gif
---
And some of the home teleport animations are horrible and lags your pc if your computer is potato like mine is whenever somebody uses this https://i.imgur.com/qq8CTmb.mp4 but then then there are some that are just fine like this https://i.imgur.com/jVIAzfS.gif but even if you have unlocked some home teleport overrides, you can just disable them and you use the traditional sit down and read teleport, similar to osrs one but in more frames.

I thought it was funny

Your brews also heal way less though

Right click on the backpack icon and click edit. Then right click on a bone and click use. Go back to icon and click save. Done

Yeah they completely demolished the unique aesthetic of RS as a whole, and now it just looks like a generic chinky mmo. All of the iconic armor sets (barrows for example) look like complete shit. I believe the aesthetic of OS is one of the big reasons the game is still viable in the modern day, it's aged very well.

As an Ironman and a pker I see both sides of the community and lumping all the toxicity onto the pkers is fundamentally wrong. I could sit there silent as a mute bird barraging away on some poor chap and the most vitriol speech comes out. Sure, the clans spamming their garbage is garbage but your run of the mill pker is a player just like you who who enjoys the content they enjoy.
---
Pkers don't fight for money, we fight for fun. The fact that you can't understand this shows how brain dead your pixel collecting mentality is.
---
You have the advantage of not being skulled, thus bringing better items.

Vanilla is where it started, it did peak in TBC/Wotlk but it started in vanilla and for most players who played from day 1, the end of vanilla and start of tbc were the golden years.

We are hoping for similar sideways progression as osrs has seen and may even have expansions and level cap raises eventually similar to how legacy Everquest is.

I can see a lot of bullying/targetting/attacking being done with this. I like the idea, but I fear it could be misused and itll be taken away. Probably have it for mile stone players, like 5+years. I dont think someone is gonna risk a 5+year account.
---
And looking like you‚Äôre doing a clue means 99/100 you don‚Äôt have valuable things on you, so again, the minority of PKers who will risk skulling for nothing aren‚Äôt worth catering to.
---
Either most PKers are extremely stupid and will attack players who most likely have nothing, or you‚Äôre mistakenly thinking the minority of players who do represent the majority because they are more visible. Either way, it‚Äôs not a good idea to prove that you have items worth attacking for

Never.

mate Im saying that the reason he isn't confident is because he is unable to complete the inferno without a coach, saying he is lacking confidence implies that he should be confident,  when he is right to not trust in his abilities. And its cheating in the sense that it is not the intended way to complete the content, you aren't supposed to be actively coached while you do it.
---
Is there specific accounts for PKing in wow? Never played, feel like other games if you're the same level you'll hit the same, etc
---
Only players who want warding should be able to vote on polls regarding warding
---
I don't agree, PKing is a side activity you opt into praticipating. Comparable to castle wars or other mini games that arent required to complete something else (e.g. diaries), why would we want the entire playerbase voting on changes to minigames which only a handful play, when that handful has a much more nuanced insight as to what differentiates a good change from a bad one

It will be interesting to see how wow classic develops. We know from experience with OSRS that if it doesn't have regular updates, it will die once the nostalgia honeymoon wears off.

To be fair, it's trivial to bully or target with just text chat. Make it reportable and a revokable privilege, like how people can be muted, and I don't see it as an issue.

Of course he's able to complete it without a coach, I fucking completed it in a week without a coach and I'm not a pro pvmer. I can understand coaching for the first 2-3 attempts but once you've had that it just becomes a hindrance.

That‚Äôs a good point but I‚Äôm not sure how it works on RS3. How do they make all of them relevant compared to how it works in OSRS?
---
personally i think these players are clowns who are sociopathic griefers looking for people who want nothing to do with them, this behaviour is toxic and the mentality of "https://i.imgur.com/zDvlDnB.jpg" is bad for the wildy

Should‚Äôve clarified my bad. I mentioned mid lvl because from my understanding most bossing requires 70+ combat stats or higher lvls like you said. Tbh would just trying to meet people through a cc who could introduce me to more PvM/Boss features other than Barrows and just have fun through random shit.

Total lvl: 1275, and 63 Str/Attk 61 Def, 61 mage, 67 Range

Super Unpopular opinion but I honestly liked the art style change. It was the Gameplay change that made me quit. EOC was and is trash. I liked the modern graphics. No hate :0

I like the idea overall. 99% of signatures would just be spam links, with most of the rest being "8==D" and similar. But I'm sure we'd get some great ones like "Stop examining players! You're in the wilderness now!"
---
It's eventually a real nice set of armor, but the way the bonuses work only the ranged set ends up being worth using at mid levels. Even then it's only good against low defence monsters, and obviously only if you aren't on a slayer task.
---
You'll certainly want a set someday, but there's zero need to get it untill you're quite high level.

Eh, its not a big deal in rs3 where you can set your own examine text, I believe they even made a report option for it, in case people do misuse it.

Mine was set to "pm me for a gift", the gift was vodka/whiskey/gin from the grand tree, always got a lol out of people, I had a surprising amount of pms from it too
---
Nah man. The argument stands. 
---
It's like the inferno. Most people who have completed it are likely to have killed most bosses in game, and at one point may have had died at the giant mole, barrows, or any other brainless boss. 
---
Same thing goes in pvp.
---
But you're against another player. So if you have no clue what you're doing it's worth practicing the basics in a low risk situation. Working your way up, just like the pvmers, until you can hold your own against actual competition.
---
I've pked for probably over a decade now, throw me in the wilderness fighting random pkers/pvmers on a pure and I'll rack you up a 10.0 kda easily.  But in pvp world edge it's more around 1.5. People are stupid good atm.

We need pokemon evolution of pets when you get that second pet drop of the same pet. Also the option to examine someone else's pet and see what KC they got it at or currently have would be pretty cool

teleport jewelry is super useful for getting around the map, a ring of dueling is especially useful because the clan wars portal can be used to fully heal your HP/prayer/run energy
---
take advantage of the free teleports as well - you can use the minigames teleport every 20 minutes and that can take you to clan wars as well as several other locations. lumbridge home teleport can be used every 30 minutes and is decent for banking in the super early game.
---
apart from that, look into questing. most people do waterfall quest pretty early on to get jump-started on their melee training. you will eventually want to think about establishing a consistent moneymaker (like herb runs or birdhouse runs) to help maintain a bond, if you're P2P and don't intend on paying $11 a month.
---
This is pretty retarded imo if ur doing a clue take the items you need and food and a stam if u get attack drop ur food and stam and whatever else till you have 3/4 items left on you when you die you keep clue regardless and just keep coming back till u do it it‚Äôs easier than it seems people are just brain dead

I mean it is still a generic art style for the graphics at the time.

I don‚Äôt understand the ge. I just recently started playing again and usually if I give some high price for an item I will get some money back, presumably because there was a cheaper sell offer. But when I sell low I will get a higher amount sometimes, like in this pic. Can anyone explain this?

It's a persona.

Exactly.  Most people that go into the wilderness lack a basic sense of awareness and a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to skull-tricking or just PKers in general.  Sure people get inventive, but 9/10 it‚Äôs easy to spot when something fishy is going on.
---
When everything else in the game requires almost zero risk, the one place that does is a complete enigma to the majority of players.
---
Just boggles my mind, especially when you can hide the option to attack other players.  People just want babyscape though.
---
Real quick, what the fuck?
---
They are just ai that attack when you're too close. 
---
Players will try to out smart you, fight back and anti pk, box something, slip you up with movement, ect.
---
Plus there's a reasonable amount of profit in it. 
---
When I first learned to tribrid on a low level pure a few years ago it was around 600-700k an hour just getting hides and bones. At that level it's probably the best and most fun money maker.
---
They didn't need to re design it so hard. Update the textures and graphics yes, but the design didn't ask to me so warped. Like we didn't need a chain loin cloth, we didn't need a halo ODST chestplate. nobody asked for the goofy helmet either. 
---
I don't see the harm of just doing an update on the existing design but i guess it's just jagex being jagex
---
no cheating does not equal unfair advantage necessarily, in this case its in the context of asking the question: did YOU complete the inferno? if you got coached YOU did not complete it therefor cheating. Thats why its a short term advantage as youve pointed out, hes too lazy to put in the work and learn the content like you did, meaning his disadvantage is due to his inability, you can frame it as confidence but being able to execute on your ability is part of doing anything.
---
Man you can say that again
---
I mean the OSRS community was, and still is in some cases, like that as well. It was very difficult to get any sort of new content in at all past GWD. The GE was a huge effort and then stuff like Zeah, Zulrah etc. Slayer changes always seem to go right through lmao.

Yeah, beat him on my first attempt but it was close and I didn't make any mistakes. Vorkath was much tougher tbh.

Normally I never attack black sally boys, but once I got their rune stacks, about 1m profit. Zero point to send em back to lumby unless you're just being a dick. I don't pk that spot ever unless I'm going easts, but I usually just run up and ask how the grinds going. I got killed a few times while doing my grind and I just told the pker that they could use my rope for themselves.

Ah, think I got it now.

So, with EOC weapons got divided into tiers, and each tier of weapon outputs the same dps regardless of weapon type. That means that a rune dagger (dual wield) and a rune 2h have the same damage output (theoretically, theres some differences because of dual wield or 2h abilities, but its pretty much identical). 
---
The way this is done is every weapon having an attack speed, a damage, and being categorized as either dual wield or 2h. Weapons with a higher attack speed will have a lower listed damage, and vice versa. These stats are put through a formula that will give you the ABILITY damage (seen on worn equipment screen) and this is the number that is important when doing EOC combat as you are (for the most part) only using abilities (there are ways to game the system, but not important). 
---
Hopefully that makes some sort of sense, i wrote it up pretty quickly and its just the bare minimum of the weapon tiers. Source: Fully maxed rs3 player, ex comp, couple 200m combat stats. Just dont play anymore due to time constraints.
---
Have you done all of the combat xp quests including mm1? The earlier you do them the more valuable the xp rewards are. After that it‚Äôs best to train attack to 60 then focus on str after

The Chinese company that holds the majority stake in Jagex announced earlier this year that they're attempting to sell their stake in the company, but as far as I'm aware we haven't gotten any word on if or who they're going to end up selling it to. Ownership changes always run the risk of resulting in changes in business philosophy, but so far OSRS has survived at least one majority ownership change without the dev team being forced to make any major changes to the game for the worse.

Yeah but are x-rays magic or ranged based? Cuz if it‚Äôs magic it‚Äôs not going to do much

You can attack the person if they hit you first?

"Ooh, it was lovely. I lived in an eggshell. I was safe in there, dreaming of the life I would lead when I hatched, and the caverns I could rule. Then suddenly I felt a trembling of the ground, and my shell shattered. Through its cracks I saw the world for the first time, just in time to watch my sire die. It was a terrible shock for a newly hatched olmlet, but I try not to let it affect my mood. So what else shall we talk about, human?"

Good point here. Any static +X str bonus will always favour higher attack speed weapons. We need some better ways around this for both melee and range than what has currently been done.
---
Thanks I assumed it was but nice that you confirmed that.
---
They hated him because he told the truth
---
You are playing an almost 20 year old MMO. We are all losers here.
---
When don't drop notifications work?
---
Also, ground items would be incredibly crowded on mobile.
---
They just need to say a new skill is coming and just poll how the skill effects the game and ignore the vocal minority.
---
You want PvP content to pass, it's really simple. You have to fix the reputation of pkers. 
---
You do this by removing some things from the wildy that are seen as staples, and by giving skillers/pvmers, a way to defend themselves.
---
Make an untradable 80 magic 80 crafting 60 prayer item that can teleport at 40 wildy.
---
Make proper tank gear that isn't just rng to get,  
---
Give people a way to recover what was lost, and they will risk a lot more. But as it stands, I'll just risk my necklace and my bones.
---
If you‚Äôre going to be using both the mouse and the touchscreen, you will likely get flagged
---
I'm 90 hunter and using redwood houses.
---
Sometimes I only get 4 nests and not even all of them are seed/ring nests a trip.
---
It's ok though, skilling isnt the intended way to get skilling materials. Combat is.
---
It's similar to Precious
---
...Ignoring the rest of your comment, you can buy noted filled vials from stores.
---
Yeah this is the only reason people really do revs. If toy can get a good streak at revs it is *so* rewarding but because of that clans lock it down. 
---
If you make a 5m/hr wildy boss, people will do it but pkers will flock them, bringing the viability of the boss down.
---
The problem is like you said, jagexs ideas of "reviving the wildy" is dumping fish in a barrel for the pkers.
---
Truly reviving the wildy would be incentivizing actual fighting.
---
When it takes so long to acquire gear needed to be competitive in pking, and the added disadvantages with modern clients, the barrier of entry to have fun pking is way too high.
---
(consistency)
---
/u/yeetpantsfartsauce, I figured it out. Here's the screenshots showing what it was.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/gLKcBJY](https://imgur.com/a/gLKcBJY)
---
its an assistive touch setting so hmmmmmm
---
if you have any level of reading comprehension youd know what i meant was that pkers are telling people just dont enter the wildy which will lead to the wildy being dead since jagex tried so hard to get people into it
---
you're another specimen aren't you
---
!lvl Cheeki Breeki
---
Can‚Äôt think of anything else to complain about?
---
Ya, but should short sellers be able to operate like that, I think not. Definitely a pretty penny, but a bunch of insiders bought stock because they think theirs no basis for such a drastic hit to the price, ie it's not gonna go bankrupt.... Probably eh lol, have a good one.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter
---
hmmmmmmmmm
---
&gt; PvP
---
PKing, you mean. People not fighting back are not "versus you."
---
If that's your cup of tea, so be it, I'd rather skill or quest than waste 4k of runes to get bones and possibly a spade from someone running away.
---
I can't change what weird things you find fun, but I can vote no to PKing and wilderness content.
---
That's a poor excuwe. If they want a fight, just go to edgeville.
---
We got a real gangsta here. Them runescape streets is rough nah sayin. Snitches get stitches forreal out here. NiüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èas getting killed err day gotta watch yo back dawg.
---
If it needs rewards to prop it up to be "interesting", then maybe it isn't that fun to begin with?
---
Simple. WORLD OF WARCRAFT WAS STEALING PLAYERS
---
I don't think that's saying what you intended it to say‚Ä¶
---
DAE think EOC was a mistake? No downvote pls
---
That‚Äôs sad. Maybe it‚Äôs time to step away from the PC
---
Yeah so what happened is somehow they broke Google Authenticate completely. So now none of us can use the app for anything whatsoever, not just RS. Reinstalling doesn't fix it. It's like they hijacked the Google authentication service info from our phones permanently. I have no idea how to explain it, it seems impossible what happened.
---
Gl with that.
---
What did ya get
---
I hate it not because of what squeal is, but the time it stands for.   
---
It stands for a time in RS's history where Jagex broke the trust and faith many fans had in them. It stands for the time they killed the high-score community and the PvP community. It introduced quality of life items we wanted so badly (spring cleaner) and made them available... only through that squeal of fortune. Want to ignore it? You bet the game was going to remind you at least a few times per play session that the squeal contains awesome and epic rewards for you.   
---
But as I said, it really boils down to a period of time in which Jagex damaged its fanbase, from which I feel they're still recovering from.
---
I‚Äôm jealous. I ended up just buying one but I‚Äôm 270 kills deep on Rex and haven‚Äôt gotten berserker ring yet. 5 rings of life and 3 warrior rings and a few rockshell armor pieces. Haven‚Äôt got the one ring I wanted though. That juicy 3 mil drop.
---
&gt; Second, you‚Äôre talking out of your ass
---
&gt; Third, please tell me
---
LMAO
---
They've always been treated that way. You aren't an employee with YouTube you're just a glorified contract worker. Your job is to bring in views for the advertisers, and it's gotten so big now you have to make your crap acceptable for daytime television to get ads. I miss when the internet was too complicated for corporate people to understand
---
b-but jiggleflux bad
---
Tons of multi clans still exist and hold wars usually every Sunday morning. Can even go just to pick up loot and make 3-5m just from stuff people won't pick up in under an hour. Was just telling another guy here that there's even a "World War" this Sunday where 10-13 of the best multi teams (rot, frozen fury, revs, etc.) are competing to see who can hold the scorpia cave the longest. Leaders agreed on date, world, and time which sounds pretty formalized to me. You just gotta know where to look
---
Rip, Well gl on your future kills
---
Bring a looting bag
---
Yeah sure. They can have Rl remove certain plugins. Then people just compile their own and sell access to them behind a paywall. There‚Äôs quite literally fuck all Jagex can do besides outright blanket banning 3rd party clients and they‚Äôre not that dumb.
---
Same here. It's just this scent too, the others are fine.
---
Nah see. A lot of people (myself included.) think that BC was the start of the end. Flying killed a lot of player interaction and is a big part of the problem. And the addition of heroic dungeons was a huge misstep. I could go on but at work on mobile atm.
---
....
---
I also got a second on on 34kc :)
---
Sorry kiddo, but you're wrong.
---
Player Versus Player means that two players are at odds. Just because you don't click on me does not suddenly mean that you're not a part of PvP. You're in the only location on Runescape where this can occur; you threw in your lot as soon as you crossed the ditch.
---
&gt;If that's your cup of tea, so be it, I'd rather skill or quest than waste 4k of runes to get bones and possibly a spade from someone running away.
---
Your perspective does not matter.
---
&gt;I can't change what weird things you find fun,
---
The weirdest thing is that you are collecting pixels that ultimately result in nothing while shitting on people who want to experience a small adrenaline rush.
---
&gt;but I can vote no to PKing and wilderness content.
---
So you call me a dickhead but you're being a petty cunt over being killed in the wild - not that it matters since pkers are going to exist regardless if there are any updates or not.
---
Is that kieran
---
lmao
---
Well that‚Äôs just Lookup on RuneLite
---
Now I understand why you pmed me !pb zulrah. Sadly I was on mobile. Gratz!
---
Gonna have to say this is untrue lol
---
OSRS literally *is* RS2. Unless you think we're playing classic.
---
Yeah but you can't inspect gear, see their qp and achievements and other things
---
Nope. She has ranged breath now. No more rune Hally @ elvarg
---
For a small fee they can be enslaved to you once more.
---
Would rather have the brew when in 40m gear :)
---
I honestly wouldn't mind seeing summoning in osrs as long as it's balanced properly; BoBs pretty much broke PvM. Also summoning tanks were neat.
---
The voting system is there as a "checks and balances" system to ensure that Jagex doesn't irreparably damage the game.
---
Even then, what incentive could you possible have to vote no? It literally doesn't affect you, it's purely to spite others. At a 75% pass rate requirement, voting against anything you don't personally partake in almost ensures every update wouldn't pass. It's lucky most people don't vote in that way.
---
Honestly you didnt need to hit me with this lmao my mage just hit 80 so I‚Äôm probably gonna switch over to Zulrah and try my chances there
---
I'm saying they can make it so it's not "tricking" people, but getting people to go back on their "I will never support MTX" stance and say "well maybe just this one time"
---
Dang thanks for the info
---
The shiny bowl of a med helm or thw feathers of a full can't really hurt anyone. Spikes,on the hand, do hurt alot. Trust me i know, i grab spiked helms all the time
---
Right, there's nothing that can be added for PVMers in the Wilderness that can both:  
---
\- Encourage more players to enter the Wildy  
---
\- Not get them all killed in the process
---
That's just how it works.  Anything advantageous for the average player is advantageous for PKers as well, except all that really translates to is players walking around with a "Free Loot" sign.  That's oversimplifying it but I hope it makes sense.
---
A real Wilderness Revival would be (and I don't know how this could be done) something that gave the average player a meaningful way to engage with their attackers.  Because otherwise, there's no way around this cat-and-mouse situation they've created.  I honestly think the Wilderness is, and always was, just too cutthroat for the type of game OSRS is, but it's too crucial to the game's identity for me to want it gone or changed too drastically.
---
Framed does a variety of content while torvesta does pretty much exclusively rushing content
---
I only used manta rays for seren, it was pretty easy without brews
---
I am confused, what the hell are you talking about? The game's population plummeting has something to do with "about 70%" of players having the same opinion? Are you lost here, sir?
---
Maybe if it was a third party client thing that you examined them and in the side pannel where hiscores and skillcalcs are it brought up a short bio you make for yourself/character.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info! I just reactivated my old account a couple months ago that I hadn't used since 2007/2008. I wish I could have revived it in OSRS, but I really didn't want to give up starting a new game with mid-to-late game stats so I went with RS3. I'm still getting my bearings but I don't hate it. But like I said, I'm not doing anything too crazy like bossing, PVP, or anything like that, either.
---
It's a fucked up hentai. The number is how you find it on nhentai
---
That's one opinion.
---
Set up that bank pin
---
Hahaha, not an excuse for no response ;)
---
lmao.. oh okay
---
I'd be all for a complete ban of 3rd party clients if they hired runelite/osbuddy devs to Jagex and actually improved their own client.
---
Nobody cares
---
My bad it wasn't a Def req, when the quest was first polled it required fairy tale pt2, which requires you to do quests that give prayer xp, hence 1 prayer poures complained about it.
---
\&gt; Instead of rolling over and hiding when a pker shows up, you should be comfortable to be able to fight back against them 
---
This should be the new design philosophy of the Wilderness imo.  No solution that doesn't involve giving me a way to fight back - not necessarily win or go even with a PKer, just have a fighting chance - is a worthy consideration.  Addressing Skulltricking should be step 1.
---
One idea I have is that all Wilderness content should be combat-related.  At least that way I'll be equipped and probably have food and potions.
---
The shitty part is it'll be at the top result for the guides too, because it has a lot of views
---
I used to work in a neuropsych lab and one of the experiments involved mice with Usher syndrome. Among other symptoms, they would constantly run in circles. It was sad watching the poor little guys.
---
Good, nobody will miss you
---
I'm talking about some legit maxed dudes.
---
DM me and I can give you links to their profiles, and posts.
---
One of their posts made it on Reddit too.
---
Why do people keep perpetuating this garbage? They even addressed the Zulrah post on stream. 90% of the accounts posted in those reddit threads had been banned. And they were mostly gold farmers, not bots, which makes them much harder to detect. Especially if they hold onto their wealth for long periods of time or use discrete methods of transferring gold.
---
Pretty sure that's only beef, since you stop burning it pretty quickly and need one for a quest.
---
Yeah when animators could make a living in YouTube
---
I'll attest to that, I recently got the 12.9in iPad Pro for my girlfriend to draw on, but I use it as a glorified OSRS machine lol.
---
But it can run smoothly, doesn't drain battery much at all and you can multitask on it as well. And with the new OS coming out soon, it should act more like a computer than a tablet apparently. 
---
Obviously you don't have to spend $1,000, but an iPad is a good choice.
---
You think the people asking about the looting bag are just trolling or are actually just that stupid?
---
Oh shit you‚Äôre right I completely forgot about that, I do remember that happening now. I agree with you my man
---
That's true, though on twitter you usually just get harassed.
---
Definitely looking to get into Raids, though for now mostly slay and bosses like GWD and DKs
---
Monkey child the zoo rescue monkey? I know you can get a clue scroll from the monkey you rescue from the zoo if you feed it bananas.
---
Don't know what you mean ü§∑
---
I like the idea of RS3. The PVM and Quests look fun but its such a jumbled mess i cant tell what's going on in the game so i can't get into it.
---
Drop wildy clues, slay south of the ditch, use a rune pickaxe, do zmi. They don't even have a quest that requires entering the wild anymore. The "forced into wildy" argument is some of the dumbest shit I've seen on this sub.
---
You're a good lad
---
Yeah yesterday there was a thread with weath where he said he'd banned 41.2k bots that day already and he was only half way through his day
---
But not as good as [this concept art](https://i.redd.it/499023ai1hd31.png) for it
---
I would personally go SGS and BGS for what you are currently doing. Then switch over to DWH when needed
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trolling. But more than half the playerbase uses 3rd party clients. The vanilla client is garbage. Jagex would essentially be committing suicide actually enforcing and banning players using 3rd party clients without a major overhaul to their vanilla client beforehand. Which will never happen because time, money and resources and Rl already does their job for them.
---
I read this as "loot from a green dragon defender."
---
I was so confused lol, but also excited.
---
Thx for the bank pin
---
I get this notification normally upon DC. Typically resolved in like 2 min though. Could be something else.
---
Yeah zenytes are super good i would get them.
---
Sgs is also quite nice at nearly every boss
---
Sneaky edit my dude
---
You can use a mouse on any Android with a USB adapter. Probably iPhones too, idk. This isnt new.
---
It's considered iconic *now*, back when HD and all the graphical reworks started, we didn't know it was going to be iconic
---
&gt; you died. 
---
You have a problem with reading. I'll repeat: I have yet to die doing clues.
---
Why is zulrah in snape grass
---
Player run areas, emergent gameplay, area control businesses, thats some pretty cool shit if you ask me
---
King of king of ass*
---
This is happens to me sometimes aswell when  I DC, its normal
---
At the time it was a good idea on paper. Most MMORPGers thought the medieval aesthetic was lame and preferred the flashier armors provided by other games like World of Warcraft.
---
Except all it really did was make the game look like a cheap Chinese MMO and it isn't unique.
---
I honestly think a not insignificant amount of people would probably quit the game if they lost access to third party clients
---
What?
---
I never killed it pre-nerf. It was obviously way better then
---
3 tick skilling methods no exceptions
---
If you go to the range tutor in lumbridge you can have bolts picked up automatically go into your ammo slot.
---
I'm out of the loop, why are PKers using Dragon Halberds these days?
---
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs too late‚Äù
---
yeah unlike this post which is a masterpiece
---
An absolute Chad
---
Ah yes, that's the one. I couldn't remember exactly which it was. I was going to say 'backpack monkey', but figured that would confuse people since you can get a monkey in the cape slot from MM2. Thanks for the correction.
---

---
Im aware of deliver items and have delivered on behalf of the service years ago I'm just making banter.
---
You were already pking in 40m gear but couldn't afford a serp helm? So many questions!
---
Is DWH semi-replaceable by BGS pretty much everywhere except for Raids? And maybe Corp?
---
oh shit thats why the surviving animation channels only really do dubbed slideshow/story board/video essay format. because its not feasible to do a months worth of work to break that 10 minute mark to maybe make 20 bucks
---
Most players don't know or care about the black market clients. Though I'll agree that they are becoming more popular and should eventually force some sort of response from Jagex.
---
I got an elder on my first solo raid at 13.8k points. I later got an olmlet with anc legs in a 4man.
---
Ive seen 3 ppl get ffa scythes in front of me, and ive got 2 rapier drops on my name. 
---
Id really like that super rare drop too
---
Really appreciate it, thanks for your effort.
---
Gotcha. I mean, the time was nothing but pure rng. First 4 bow hits were 230+ xps. Tanz phase, i only hit 1 0 with bp, rest of the hits were 120+ xp i believe. Dumb luck is all lol
---
Just a tiny bit too detailed for me, too much going on. But i still think it looks amazing.
---
The jmods are doing the best they can, but the fact is jagex(as a company) has way more resources that they could be using on the anti-cheat team 
---
The team is underpaid and small. They do a great job with what they got right now, but the higher ups should really be giving them more support.
---
Getting rid of bots doesn't bring in new players, which seems to be their focus. Mobile fixes are a bigger priority than bots unfortunately.
---
They don‚Äôt know or care because they haven‚Äôt had to.
---
Yeah it sure is fun getting 15FPS at the grand exchange! High five 15FPS club!
---
It's also fun watching my CPU max one core to 100% so my entire OS struggles from a 15 year old medieval children's game.
---
When grinding a boss this long how do you get all the supplies required for it? Very nice grind
---
There are lots of things rs3 did right but the main reason I play rs is the simple fighting mechanics. If I wanted to have a taskbar I‚Äôd just play wow or ffxiv.
---
&gt;Same with Blizzard. When players were first asking for legacy servers, Blizzard said "you don't want that. You think you do, but you don't." Guess what's coming out in less than 2 weeks lol.
---
I have a feeling WoW Classic will be smaller and less populated in a couple months. OSRS was pretty solid in 2007 and the lack of QoL was a lot of the charm. After reading some of the "bug" reports on the beta for Classic WoW, it's clear that people don't actually want Classic WoW so much as they want to revisit the nostalgia of what they remember Classic WoW being. 
---
My whole elaborate point is that Classic WoW isn't actually what most people want, and part of that is that WoW never went through an EoC change that irreconcilably ruined it.
---
Oh my god, it‚Äôs like an in-game mafia!
---
cba chatting on mobile sometimes!
---
Can't say it annoys me, more like 'ok here we go again', I only go in when doing wildy slayer tasks and when pkers do show up I just stand there and let them kill me, take the fun out of it for them, I only ever have 3 items and food, like you said I think certain pkers only want to fight people who don't fight back.
---
Trailer park boys and osrs ay? Front page is this way sir.
---
Extra brew is too valuable when you're risking 40m and could potentially have to tank a full tb
---
lmao thats fucking crazy
---
100%. Guy was anti pking while doing something else and they skull tricked him. This is why I vote no on pvp updates. Yall dont want a fair fight. You want free loot.
---
Nice pic bro, it just makes me uncomfortable that the void helm changes into a neitiznot
---
Yeah
---
Excuses!
---
I remember being excited for eoc, but I was a child at the time
---
Go through /u/-Maxy- post history. He does the Q&amp;A transcripts.
---
I wasn't aiming that at you lol
---
Nice "singles" pking. Until Jagex fixes this I'm voting no to PvP updates.
---
idk about boss pets, but frosty the frost dragon pet from the DG token store makes a comment about his parents if you go to the frost dragon dungeon with him out, and your caracter is afraid to tell him/her the trouth. :(
---
Mod smash lord of dat ass.
---
What if I don't care about winning or losing, and just want to get that clue scroll done? I understand that you like the thrill of winning/losing, and so do I, but not in OSRS.
---
Someone is logged on your account.
---
I think KBD gets mad iirc; and while it‚Äôs not a boss pet, the Frost Dragon pet‚Äôs dialogue is *extremely* sad if you bring it to the cave... [It‚Äôs the last dialogue set here](https://runescape.wiki/w/Transcript:Frosty)
---
This game has gotten soft after they reverted death mechanics lol. People really expect to die with zero consequence
---
I say reported quite often because I think it‚Äôs hilarious but the only people I have ever reported since OSRS has come out are the ‚ÄúRNG####‚Äù guts doing the dice games and doublers
---
Hahahahahahaha cmon man simple knowledge

Lmao you will hate your life

Preaching to the choir

Ya I bet they had a steamy three some after wards. They probably both pegged mod ash with the intensity of the burning sun.

Probably that your account hasn't logged out from last session and you should try again in a few minutes

That's exactly what I was thinking. Make it an unlock via doing things in-game. Seems like it would be a lot of fun
---
I wanna see their qp
---
I like how you ran to get your sick fashionscape on before you took the screenshot
---
Im an osrs player but i think the new armor isnt bad looking at all. If any the helmet kinda ruins it a bit
---
People noticed it when fighting against a NPC which is weak in one style but not another one. After that, they asked jmods about it and they confirmed it.
---
I'm still coughing

Yeah it's a solid improvment over the crafting guild. The only problem is bracelets of clay break _so_ fast and there's no bank in the mine, only a desposit box.
---
:/
---
you say that yet at launch OSRS had lower player numbers, they had to get more and more updates and 'promotions' to get the player base up to what it is now.
---
Mobile helps alot, as well.
---
The issues is I didn‚Äôt even play this account in June, nor have I ever used any ‚Äúillegal 3rd party software‚Äù so I‚Äôm not sure how to go about trying to appeal this. Any help would be much appreciated.
---
Nope! The game is actually really good right now. Thanks for being awesome Jamflex &lt;3

Ultimate chad damn brother, keep up the nice work

He does. You can also cancel a task at turael to reset your streak to 0

Now this is epic
---
Easy to 3 tick when it only takes 2 to finish.
---
If you can take the time to research Revolution++ to auto your combat bar somewhat and research weaponry you can get back into Slayer and A good 60% of Bossing. Only the more complicated stuff like Raids, Telos, Solak, AoD, Elite Dungeons, etc. require full manual combat bars.
---
Skilling has frankly an overabundance of methods and paths you can take for Max Cape. Some are even almost pure afk. This was considered off-putting to some players however. For example, 99 thieving was basically trivial with Safecracking; Which at fastest routes had upwards of 500-700k xp/hr on release. Player Owned Farms made 99 Farming almost a joke also. Not even getting into Runespan for Runecrafting and the methods introduced with Land Beyond Time update.
---
Completionist got a sort of redesign. So I can't make comments on that having never got it.
---
MTX will always be a buzzword for negative reviews of RS3. Frankly if you don't give a rats ass about cosmetics and aren't enticed by various boosts to experience you can just shrug your shoulders and make due with the daily keys. If you get something nice, neat. If you don't, whatever.
---
And to boil down to which of the two are better between OSRS and RS3; I'll say what's the smartest answer to this question: Both games have diverted enough from each other to where they're completely separate games. Think Ragnarok 1&amp;2, Maplestory 1&amp;2, etc. Sure many aspects have similarities but at the end of the day it's upto your own preference.
---
exactly, it's out of runes.
---
I wanna see their aq p
---
I actually prefer RS3's, it looks less of 'lets add dragonstone gems to Rune Armour' tbh.
---
its not amazing, but its not trash.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know! I always skip the damn things lol I‚Äôll take my roasts though
---
Cat in name smh
---
Better than getting that off Arma
---
It was made to prevent ragging, and to make corp alting more difficult. Need an ironman alt with ornate rejuvination pool and preferable dwh/bgs for that.

Tbow zulrah was so slow and inconsistent for me lol. It might be better money overall, but when kills last 2:30 I just being mage haha
---
The PvM side of this game has been coddled non stop. Unfortunately, its due to the nature of PvMers being Jagex's cash crop. Legit just seen a post saying how "removing skulltricking" would "fix the wilderness". 
---
You cant ration with these levels of entitlement.
---
i didn't know either. i keep seeing people say nhentai in the comments tho. its anime tiddies
---
You're right
---
I'm nobody, and I care.
---
Damn, that's some sick RNG. Did you use trident for your kills, with an alt/friend to spec down corp's stats first?
---
Yeah I'm trynna match up my clothes with my questcape, but the colour on the "white" clothes are disgusting

Lmao

Sick PK dude. Actually feels good to have your heart beating fast on this game. Gratz!

Does it matter what armor I wear when canoning? Will melee gear make the canon hit less

How? I was pretty tired last night but I couldn't seem to get 2 bonds in one cart.
---
Lmao you didn't even blur out your attack style. Gf account.
---
It means Jagex has baby‚Äôd the absolute hell out of this game to the point you want everything given to you at zero risk. I mean, seriously, you might as well go play FarmVille. You‚Äôll slowly grow your farm and gain items without a worry in the world. Do you get this upset when your herbs die too? Maybe we should remove that mechanic since it‚Äôs risky and annoying.
---
I didn‚Äôt vote on this poll, and I still don‚Äôt even know what the poll was about. I‚Äôm just genuinely confused about this mindset you have. I just can‚Äôt fathom thinking that way about an MMO.

I remember one time I was shooting hoops on the street with some neighbourhood pals when Mod Ash was rollerblading past. He super politely asked if he could join for a few points and we of course indulged him. Despite his less than athletic appearance and subpar footwear, I sensed a powerful aura about him and chucked him on my team. First play I launch an admittedly low flying pass through the zone to my man Ash in the paint. Somehow he managed to jump and scoop it up from WELL below knee height as he manipulated his body to twist and (whilst still airborne) blow a kiss to a Mazda Miata with an instantly single mother driving by as he threw down a magnitude 9 two hander. He then bladed off into the sunset without saying a word and left us in the settling dust of the now dozens of slowly collapsing houses. Upon cleaning up the rubble, building inspectors realised that every single house affected had actually been built with incredibly flammable materials that would‚Äôve easily ignited with a warm breeze. Mod Ash saved my entire street and I still get chills thinking about that slam.

animes i've seen throughout my life: Pokemon, Naruto, Naruto Shipuden, Dragonball Z, One Punch Man, Samurai Champloo, Fairytale, Goblin Hunter, Hunter x Hunter, and Bleach
---
thats it i think. they were pretty decent imo, but i dont understand how people become obbsessed with anime and anime girls. 
---
if you are an anime fanatic and you watch the highschool life animes and what ever other kind of animes there are, could you explain to me how you got to being so fanatical about these cartoons? im not shaming you. im not saying anime is shit. i just sincerely don't see the appeal. 
---
p.s. i also dont watch reality tv which looks like an irl version of the anime genres that i dont understand. if you watch "reality tv" anime do you also watch irl reality tv?
---
Meanwhile, pkers bitch about not being able to kill people in the wilderness.
---
Maxed players (on Twitter) are some of the most vocal players about changes in the game though. While their own accounts may not be responsible for a huge portion of the votes, the amount of stuff they spew towards the game and towards anyone who will read it definitely does influence votes.
---
Why does your art look so familiar? Like i've seen it years ago or something. Do you have any super famous works by chance or is your artstyle similar to another?
---
Oh cool, this again
---
But why? Isn't the whole point of the update to fix exactly that? Why are 1x1 mobs any different to 1x1 players? Why were 1x1 mobs able to fire around corners, but 1x1 players weren't? 
---
Anyway, somebody else explained it. Turns out the dark wizard clip is wrong and both the LHS and RHS clip were done on the beta. 1x1 NPCs are affected by this update, so if you were barraged there, you probably would be able to attack back.
---
sending people just the 6 numbers instead of the whole link is a bit of a meme at this point. It's kinda like "Everyone in the know will understand it, I'm not gonna post an actual link to it just for the plebs"
---
My pb is 4:54 on my 1 kill pure
---
So what‚Äôs the inventive here? 
---
Because as it stands, if you want the fastest xp, you light 27 logs in a row.

If you want still pretty damn fast xp + money + pet + leveling other stats, then you do wintertodt.

I don‚Äôt see this being viable without further explanation on your idea.

I know there was a specific time where I was glad there was a cancel button because it was literally the only way out. Can‚Äôt remember though.

i don't give a fuck if you don't give the player the cape in that scenario. the only thing that's an issue is giving a player the *kc* but *not the cape* (or alternatively the cape but not the kc). if you get kc you should always get cape. if the player dies and also kills zuk, sure feel free not to give them kc *or* cape. but those two things should always be together, otherwise kc is meaningless.

I decided to take a break from OSRS, and I discovered this cute little phone game called Azur Lane... It's a battleship combat game, but all the warships are all represented as anime girls... the mtx mostly involves buying individual skins for the characters...

You‚Äôre looking way too hard into this
---
lmao actually good, rip fuse
---
I came here to say the same thing lol
---
Ah, well that is good. From how they mentioned it on the Q&amp;A, I would have figured Corrupted is more shards per hour. Anyway, that would be 2 of the big unique Prif pieces of content are a good shard rate, yet Agility is 8 per hour... Think it can be a bit better than that, but that is what it was polled at and they seem resistant to change it for some reason.
---
Not a new thing bruv

Fuck off with that bullshit semantic argument. Everything in the game is optional, playing the game itself is optional. Paying my taxes is optional. Cut the pedantry.

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electro stimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.
---
As a form of general CBT, ball-busting is when a man has his testicles kicked, kneed, punched or squeezed. In addition to its occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (ÁéâËπ¥„Çä and/or ball-kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. Like many other forms of CBT, it carries significant health risks, including the possibility of permanent damage to the testicles through testicular trauma.
---
Another member of the CBT club is the ball stretcher, which is a sex toy used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if overly tight. While leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from about 1-4 inches. A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.
---
The most debilitating yet arousing tool for CBT is the ball crusher, which is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself.
---
There is also the parachute, which is a small collar that fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3‚Äì5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are utilized. Smaller weights can be used when the male wearing the parachute is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.
---
And lastly, to further restraint he participant in a BDSM make-out, there is the humbler. For the most part, it consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs and at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing considerable discomfort. A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.
---
And now, you are officially an expert in general Cock and Ball torture knowledge.
---
I just want to say this was one of the coolest comment chains I‚Äôve read in this sub. Thank you all for your insights and observations..what a treat
---
Its normal
---
*Her* huh
---
woah youre probably the first person ever to stake that much
---
See, I don't understand the argument where you want pvp completely separate from the rest of the game. The skilling/pvm in the wildy provides a way for people who aren't terrified of pvp to train skills or pvm in a way that is more varied and exciting than just in the main game. You can catch chins in dhide with msb/ags and have a chance at anti pking some nice loot. The multi areas are more problematic, but you can have situations like revs where teams work together to lock down particular worlds. 
---
But people don't see it like that. They just want the improved gp/xp per hour without the risk. I genuinely don't understand what people expect. Would you prefer that there was nothing at all in wildy so you don't feel jealous of the people who aren't too terrified to go there?
---
Also I'm not sure how the updates such as bulwark nerf affect you. Bulwark is literally only used in wildy, so it only affects people participating in pvp. Unless you mean that it's affecting you in the sense that it makes it harder for you to skill in wildy in 400 defence bonus with little chance to die. 
---
And the resized spellbooks would have easily passed if it was separate from pvp, so you can blame jagex for the way they polled it, if you really struggle that much to click spells.
---
You want updates to focus on pkers fighting each other instead of pvmers? I agree, but why don't you try and suggest something? The only things that would encourage it is gp incentives similar to old pvp worlds where the random loot meant you could profit even if you weren't a great pker. But nothing like that would ever pass a poll because people are disgusted by the idea of pking actually being good gp/hr.
---

Not really. It's painfully obvious while watching his videos that the majority of his content is totally unnecessary and  a lot of the stuff that might be useful is frequently wrong.
---
there's actually over 7600 maxers already. If you look up RSN ''Red Roger95'' in hiscores, he's one of the lowest xp max capers, so his rank is approx the amonut of maxers in game.

Crafting.  These memes aren't going to craft themselves.
---
I agree with that personally. Why does it make sense to let people not at all apart of a community vote for their content?
---
If Ironman want to turn Sandstone into buckets of sand, they have their reason pretty much ever iron was in favor of it. Normal accounts, myself included, consider it stupid considering it's designed solely for ironman accounts. However that's the issue. The content is NOT designed for normal accounts, for normal accounts that's completely dead content from release, but for Ironman accounts it was I believe slightly more buckets of sand an hour then the sand pit in Yanille as well as some mining XP.
---
Main problem with locking polls to requirements is that some of them could be insane. If they tried polling a hard mode inferno for example, less then 1% of the player base has an inferno I believe. So they're just going to get AT MOST a few thousands votes as opposed to the normal like 70k+ votes, assuming that they would lock inferno based polls to inferno completion requirements.
---
I do understand though that it's generally not a popular idea, people want to vote on ALL of the content in the game. I just don't think it makes sense to allow people unaware of issues to vote on the issues. PvP has issues and these polls are aiming to help them, people have issues with PKers who are associated with PvP, vote no to PvP because of it. That's stupid to me.
---
Gz on 200m
---
Construction has always been a favorite. Can't say I love to train it, but it does have a nice rhythm to it at times. But the main reason I like it is the POH; even back on release day I just loved building up a house and getting to customize it, even if variety is pretty lacking. And to this day, I've probably spent more time planning my house than training the skill.
---
yeah right^^

Prims are a better upgrade statwise than tassets, as verac's skirt has better defences except for 9 range and while veracs has an additional 3 extra prayer. Prims have a very slight attack bonus, and even more defences than dboots. If you don't have fighters torso bandos chest is after tassets.

the new graphics in rs3 are ok, but they went to overboard with it. Every area is cluttered with tons of shit. It's too much. They should have updated the graphics on rs3, but not added so much stuff to the areas. 
---
It's like the remade original star wars movies with Lucas' updates to them. Theres too much shit crammed into every scene (they also added a new scene where Han talks to Jabba in SW4 a new hope)

If you're trapping them successfully now great! If not, or you want some people around you, join the cc "splashworlds" and ask for a world to join with a knight trapped in Ardy bank. There will be someone splashing on it to keep it in place.

I do, in fact, have years of experience coding. 
---
Assuming it's possible for the LOS function to get whether or not something is a player (presumably possible because of overhitting in PVP), you add an arbitrary boolean-returning function cmp(a,b) satisfying cmp(a,b) != cmp(b,a) for all a != b. Then:
---
    new_los(a,b):
---
        if (class(a) != player) || (class(b) != player):
---
            return old_los(a,b)
---
        if cmp(b,a):
---
            return old_los(b,a)
---
        return old_los(a,b)
---
That would work once moved from pseudocode to actual code and involves nothing they haven't already used elsewhere. PVM is unaffected and PVP is symmetric.
---
the black armor looks the coolest. They should have put the best design for the rune armor, it is the best armor after all.
---
tldr:  black armor in rs3 has the best design

I bet they raid..

The 2007 scape that you sloppily referr to as the "retarded brother" here is smoking the 2019 evolved RuneScape with 12 years of updates added to it. Your analysis is far off.
---
This reads like someone who played wow in 2007. RS players in 2007 mocked wow in the same way that you say RS was mocked. 
---
RS had something that made RS very special. Wow had something that made WoW special. If WoW tried to be RS, it would die. If RS tried to be WoW, it would die. RS tried to be WoW and paid the price.
---
This is what your analysis should have concluded but you fail to grasp anything. And I love how you bring up minecraft in the same turn, minecraft with the possibly worst graphics you can imagine, and its still being played to this very day.
---

Why are people being so critical? There are literally noobs running about in d med helms with combat bracelets who don't give a flying fuck about anything being said in the comments right now. How about you stop thinking of it as Firemaking training and think if it as magic training with a bonus.   
---
The OP simply offered an idea. These ideas are pretty much never implemented in the same manner as they are suggested. They are tweaked. If you polled FM today, you'd have literally no idea that Wintertodt would be around the corner as a possibility.

Why can't this suggestion, or literally any other suggestion, be the same way? Ideas CAN be improved, you realize that right?

2 almost identical names is an easy enough trick for someone to fall for. It‚Äôs an easy thing to put in a fix for. And killing someone vs spotting a name difference are 2 different things. Most people are looking at the person and their inventory and not of the name is DIIICK or DIIIICK.

You get a slayer xp boost from finishing a boss task, so id say if you cba with the boss it gives go for 3 as youll get more slayer xp/hr that way since the boost it gives you, if you want to grind that boss for an item, i.e. Kril from zammy hasta go for the max (35 iirc)
