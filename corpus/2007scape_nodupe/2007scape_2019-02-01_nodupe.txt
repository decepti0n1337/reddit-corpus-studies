you don't profit staking long term at all. especially now w/ the tax.

Really just gotta keep at it - every bit of experience helps

Congrats on 99 Magic :D and an impressive untrimmed cape!

If you say “17 is not a child” then you’re either a pedophile, and pedophile apologist, or (most likely) you’re 17 or younger and you don’t really understand the perspective that real adults have. I’m not robbing her of her agency as a human being when I say she’s a child; I’m just stating the  fact that you don’t have to be that old to see “17 years old” and think “Yeah that’s a child, and an adult 23 year old probably shouldn’t be acting sexually toward her at all”.

And just because I always saw people asking, his maxed UIM series music was Freeze Me by DFA 1979.
---
the process has to be delegated somehow in a more efficient manner yes. seeing as it is a game and not real life as youve pointed out, I would just say the people are picked in some logical and reasonable manner by Jagex. Its their game so they need to realize its in their and the games best interest and just do it

I got to well over 90 farming before I figured out you can pay to have the trees removed.  I am not very smart.

Honestly expected the opposite reaction but I don't watch him that much to judge how he'd react lol because after 24k kc you'd think he'd be like "ok cool finally" lol
---
Right, I'm agreeing with part of what you said and disagreeing with the rest. 
---
If you see this chick, and she's bangin. Like, shes got perfect tits in a tight shirt with booty shorts on and shes got this smile that makes you hard on command,  and she turns to you and says "I'm only 16." Does your dick shrivel after that or does it linger for a while and go "idk man this is risky is this the kind of guy we are I might head out."? Because if it hangs around for a bit, you might have a problem. But that's where we agree. Where we dont seem to agree Is that you got hard in the first place but shes only 16. Its in your nature. At least if you're attracted to women. 
---
Just want to say that you're implying everyone stopped using AHK after the ban.
---
And if say most maybe get 4 drops in a tick.
---
Yes shift click is better, but let's slow down there
---
Here's to hoping they don't have to find out the hard way, I know I did :/

its like a ptr build it doesn't carry into the real game :/

That's just a flaw in democracy though.  In reality, voters are regularly faced with a choice between what's "right" vs. what's good for them.  The whole point is that polling the population at large should produce some idea of what it is that people would like to see happen, regardless of what their reasons might be.  
---
I got laser eye surgery over a year ago and i still catch myself adjusting my glasses sometimes.

its just one of those things that jagex decided to spend time changing. it's only a real niche scenario where it would be useful to be able to do that.

---
That one is definitely QOL, that's why OP did not circle it.  I don't even see what the argument would be for that to not be a QOL change - what, because it makes Vorkath slightly easier?  There's no way that would result in any significant impact on the content.  I would be shocked if a SINGLE person in the game would go from not being able to farm Vorkath to being able to farm Vorkath based on that change alone.  
---
Swapped out the Book of Darkness for a Mage's Book to make it a bit more fair, and the Swamp setup is better than Fire Surge until 105 mage, where DPS is equal until 101 where Fire Surge starts being better. So if you're keeping 100% uptime on the Imbued Heart, it's better even considering the stat drain after 7 minutes. [Here's a screenie of the chart if you wanna check it out](https://i.imgur.com/1AdRgfV.png) . Augury does actually make Fire Surge slightly better from 104, but the overall average is still better for Trident.

Please stop assuming other people are stupid. We all know it's not actually 50-50 in real life. However in this game it's 50-50.

I only included rooms where you fight monsters. Since there is nothing to fight in the thieving or resource rooms, I did not include them. Scavengers are in the image though!

---
Uhhh you sure seem to fantasizing about the “hot body” of a 16 year old girl a little bit too much, there. And don’t use biology as the justification, please. That’s horrifyingly ignorant, and abusive of science.
---
By the way I wouldn’t get a hard-on in the first place, because she’s 16 and it’s super duper easy to tell when you’re a full-fledged adult (and i don’t just get a binder every time i see an attractive adult anyway). You’ll understand when you’re older. I even see college aged Undergrad girls around University campus and I’m like “Holy shit these are some *children*!” I taught a class for undergrads for the past 2 years and every semester I would be baffled at how young they look. I certainly wouldn’t fuck around (or even think that way) with a girl around 18 even if she looked on the older side of that age range. 21 would be an absolute **minimum** for me if I wasn’t married, and I would still prefer 22-26 because that means at least she’s out of undergrad
---
That does not matter, just because something is or isnt does not make it 50%, it just makes it 2 outcomes. Its like saying you have a 50% chance of winning the powerball, because either you lose or you win. But thats not how probability work.

Thanks for an actual answer even tho it’s not what I want to hear.

With that said WHY can’t I put the items back in my bank? I have a full inventory of members items that I was gonna sell. This account is basically being held hostage unless I pay $11

Yeah, it's been posted at least once a day here for the last week too.

You know someone is still living in high school when they bring up age as a valid form of argument. You're pathetic.

I never said whether the reason was one thing or another I just said its a reason.

Seems like he think AHK were banned then Mousekeys were banned after which led to shift-click. He is definitely misremembering what happen or don't fully understand the situation.

Haven’t seen it and I’m on Reddit every day my bad

I just hopped worlds in the Varrock anvils. Found him quickly.

Not backtracking at all, but you definitely doubling down on your stupidity.

Take my upvote.
---
Get this man some friends!
---
So it's okay if the 17-year-old is not in education, but has a job and lives in their own flat?
---
Why is that in any way a consideration? It's not about a set age, it's about maturity. People grow up mentally and physically at different rates. If someone is physically and mentally ready, I don't think it makes sense to set an arbitrary barrier. In most cases, that will be around 15-16, which makes sense since that's where a lot of people get their first sexual experiences. At that point, girls will typically look physically mature so there is nothing odd about finding them attractive. And when the mind catches up a year or two later, what's the harm?
---
In these cases, I don't think it makes sense to decide based on your own conviction. It makes most sense to decide based on what research shows. And research shows quite clearly that people are often mature around that 15-16 mark, which is why most Western countries sets that boundary as the legal age for consent. It won't work for everybody as there are always people who are not ready for it at any age, but that doesn't mean that it's sensible to ban it for the rest out of some kind of scare mongering about paedophilia, like the other commenter who shares your opinion has been doing.
---
First day here?
---
Virgin head vs chad bones
---
I’ll be your friend!
---
I'm 18 soon 19. I realize that once I'm 25 I'll look back and think it's a young age (since I already see 14-15, who I once viewed as big, as young), but I still believe that a 17 year old is old enough to be in a sexual relationship with a 20+ yr old.
---
You keep making these ridiculous quotes as counter arguements to people where you straw man
---
&gt;Living in high school
---
Hahaha
---
&gt;Being up age as a valid form of argument
---
Yeah you’re right. In a *conversation about creepy adults hitting on teenagers*, age is I consequential. 
---
&gt;You’re pathetic
---
Aaaaand there’s the insult. Right on cue. I love Reddit.
---
Thinking 'this meme is for intellectuals' means its for intellectuals is a whoosh buddy.

It depends on what slayer master you’re with as the weighting for tasks change from master to master.

This same shit happened last year.like the exact same thing.

Didn't the entire rev caves clusterfuck come about as a QoL improvement?

You list in your title the whole reason this is a bad idea. It makes the wildy gwd almost completely worthless and the only benefit is having a chance of requiring lower kc becuase you're lazy.

I'm fine, mate, I just think this guy needs some motivation to work out that Feb comes after Jan. I think he's close to getting it.

Or just add more Australian worlds
---
Get your meme game up son.
---
woosh
---
Just camp the monsters below lvl 30 wild, stand so that when people log in from the north they have to run around the rubble to hit you. Always be zoomed out looking to the southernmost part of the cave up to the 30 line. As soon as you see a single skull, hop at least 3 worlds away. Bank every 200-300k. If you bring a craws bow, you have a target on your back and clans will try to log in under you so don’t use craws. Bulwark is retarded op so use that if you can afford it. The best escape if you get tb’ed is running through green dragons down to hobgoblins and try to get a box and brew down. Gl summoner
---
Look at all these comments taking this post seriously...

Congrats to them?

Is this serious?

i can barely be bothered to get one 99 let alone seventeen.

did u say 25k prayer xp per kbd head? brb with my stack of 30
---
God bless your poor mother. 
---
I've always out of habit banked everything before logging out, to kind of reset myself before I log on again and not feel committed to continue doing something previous. But the day I get cleaned for my gear is the day I'll quit, likely for years. I just can't be asked to rebuild. 
---
Those ever-so-precious ticks that I use standing at the bank

Let's see you go almost 5x the drop rate on warhammer and not be fucking insanely overjoyed when it finally drops. Idiot.

Yeah I know, I just couldn't be bothered making a meme format post just to bring attention to a really important matter. Just hoping there's still some level of maturity and respect within the sub.
---
Yeah, it should be locked behind quests, just like Bis Boots, gloves, chest, legs, amulet, ring and weaponry! The only thing that isn't "buyable" is cape and neitiznot lol.

&gt;I’m 18 soon 19
---
There it is. So you’re in category 1. I know you’re not 17, but you’re not quite olde enough o get it either
---
&gt; I realize that once I'm 25 I'll look back and think it's a young age (since I already see 14-15, who I once viewed as big, as young), but I still believe that a 17 year old is old enough to be in a sexual relationship with a 20+ yr old.
---
Wait so you realize you’ll change your mind when you’re older but you still think it’s okay now? That’s super weird. It feels disingenuous. And yeah 17-20 isn’t actually that bad. But 17-23 is a much different line to draw. 
---
And yes. When you’re 25, you will view 17 year olds as children. I promise you.
---
If it ain't no penetration ain't illegal dawg
---
gotta get all 23 for max bro ;) 
---
I was planning on dropping 200m for dragon bones. As someone who just returned after not playing since OSRS, what method are you speaking of? Because that sounds unbelievable 
---
I've been hearing some shit about this. If your statement is true, I don't care. 
---
complaining about it isn't going to make them do it. write an addon for runelite if you are really wanting it.
---
He looks genuinely hurt lmao. Well runescape is the greatest online mmorpg ever.
---
It's unique to each player. Keep hopping or suck it up and use wiki to find him.
---
You could use some untradables so I'll list those real quick.
---
Do Fremmenik Isles for the Helm of Neitiznot, start working towards barrows gloves (Recipe for disaster), get a dragon defender once you have the requirement to enter the warriors guild, Get a fighter torso from barbarian assault, and get 75 range at some point for your fire cape.
---
As for the buyables...
---
Get a Black Mask when you start training slayer, it gives 15% more melee damage and accuracy while on task. You can also imbue it at nightmare zone so it affects range and mage too.
---
Berserker ring is really nice if you don't already have one. You would want to imbue it at nightmare zone if you do buy one.
---
A fury is a nice upgrade over the glory but not super needed for you yet.
---
Once you hit 70 attack get a whip for training attack and defence.
---
Obsidian Legs will be a nice upgrade once you get a fighter torso as well.
---
How do you prefer to crush your weebs? I prefer to smite them with FACTS and LOGIC
---
Idk how you came to that conclusion. Most cases for Slayer karils is better dps than rune crossbow. Neither are very good choices for Slayer though
---
When a monster attacks you, it uses a certain attack style (stab/slash/crush/magic/range/etc). This is the attack style you'll need to defend to.
---
So say a mob uses 'stab' as it's attack style, and has +10 stab bonus, +20 slash bonus and 0 crush bonus, those last 2 bonuses can be completely ignored as the mod doesnt use those styles.
---
As you may know, attack only affects the accuracy of the attack, and not the max hit, which is determined by strength (and is usually listed as a separate number on, say, the wiki).
---
Hopefully this clarifies your question.
---
Good luck in life. 
---
ohh. gotcha sorry.
---
hi, I'm wondering if I'd be able to do efficient zul'rah kills with my current stats/gear
---
[https://imgur.com/YxPdy93](https://imgur.com/YxPdy93) are my stats
---
I have a blowpipe, a toxic trident, occult necklace, and 6m to spend.

---
Join the CC "Galaxy Clan" in-game and tell them Sensual Gaze sent you.
---
They regularly do learner raids and are very good at their call outs, they have a Discord server that's pretty well organized as well.
---
Everyone says train slayer but it's actually more efficent to wait till 80-85 melees before doing much slayer. You can still achieve 99 slayer before 99 melees exceptially since barrage slayer. 
---
Cheers I've just changed the post, I've got nieve. Dunno who to block yet

I'm a little confused though, you still have to make it to verzik and you can't do the inferno in tourney world?

Dumb fucking twat, neck yourself 
---
Weird idk from what I understand he used his buddies comp p regularly
---
Your conclusion doesn't really match your opening statement. I assume the reason you're saying "it's not as useful as one might think" is because brute force attacks aren't a very powerful cracking method, and protecting oneself against them isn't much of a priority (as server timeouts are already implemented and very effective against this). Am I correct in assuming that this is the logic behind your opening statement?
---
Agreed. 
---
I also love the irony of how the PVP community single handedly gave us this game but have been marginalized over the years and the clamming &amp; hybrid community are dying out. 
---
For those that don’t know about the history of OSRS; the idea came from a PVP private server called 2006scape, during the time before OSRS release priv servers had a collectively larger population than RS3, was about to release with a lot of hype. A popular priv server already out but not based in 2006 version of RS had a population of roughly 20k that were all getting ready for the new 2006scape release. Jagex found out about this and decided to steal the idea and used their copyright to file and lawsuit then promptly announced a poll to vote in a 2007 version of Runescape. Old PVP clans that were either on priv servers already or still kept in touch launched a massive campaign to get all of their members and friends to create as many accounts as possible and buy membership to vote on the poll. I know people in the PVP community, pure pkers, who had a competition to see who can have the most accounts voted on the poll with the highest confirmed from one person being 73 accounts voted on, with at least 15 others with over 50 accounts each. PVP youtubers began spamming videos on YouTube using YouTube’s emails about new videos feature to reach all of their old viewers telling people to vote on the poll and make oldschool happen. When the poll passed and the game launched, the PVP community made up the overwhelming majority of the OSRS community with very very few skillers and PVMers for the first year and a half. The PVP community sustained the economy by itself for longer than that; keeping the prices of all pots, food, craftables (Smith, crafting, fletching), runes and tele tabs at a very profitable price. Without those “toxic angsty kids”, I wouldn’t be able to waste my life away skilling for 4 hours a day and spending at least 8 combined hours raiding non stop with my friends on the weekend. We owe that community a lot, but instead we flame them and troll vote them in an attempt to marginalize them out of existence almost completely due to the toxic mindset that this Reddit community breeds. It’s a damn shame.
---
Some people will actually vote yes on this going into PvP if they think it might ruin the PvP community, that’s how toxic Reddit has become. It’s affected many of the people in my clan too, when it didn’t used to be that way in the skilling community. Quite depressing to see the state of the OSRS community devolving like this.

You don't swap auto cast back while you're tick walking to stack the mobs?

Thanks you too. I hope your child never meets Drake. And I feel you’ll need all the luck you can get. My life is pretty good 
---
Oh wait, I think I finally understood what point you're trying to make.
---
&gt;people, mostly those who never bothered using AHK of MK in the first place, made a stink to make the game easier,
---
&gt;And I lol'd at this.
---
You think I lol'd cause I thought this part of what you said was inaccurate about when AHK was banned and shift-click was introduced? I lol'd cause of you stupidly thinking that people who never used AHK/MK made a fuss over it and got shift-click introduced. Most players used AHK or MK within the boundaries that Jagex set and when it got taken away because of a few people pushing the boundaries of it, they were rightfully upset.
---
you're trying to say what everyone is thinking, but you're fucking it up. please don't respond with another assumption.
---
Please #8 pass! Range tank melee switches while having to switch to defensive and back to rapid every time are the worst. Happens at Demonic Gorillas, DKs, in Raids, and pretty much everywhere you'd want to use a DWH/BGS spec. I'm sure other accounts could benefit too, but this is pretty huge QoL for tanks that do PvM.
---
&gt;not giving me everything
---
arceuus spellbook, requires like 60% favor to gain access. take rune pouch and a bunch of ensouled heads, there's also a fairy ring right nearby. it takes a lot longer than dragon bones, but who cares. at least you're not spending 1b to get a few prayer levels.
---
ok, a nub or an idiot is willing to depart with 5m for 10 bucks. 75def still takes longer than the combined requirements for the 2 fremennik quests.
---
what do you think about my quest idea though
---
Gosh darn Jogflix
---
I feel you on that. I found it more cringe than anything but as long as she allows it then I guess its fine? I mean, she is of age but I could see how she would feel pressured especially in front of that crowd. I just don't want to see a story 10 years from now about how drake sexually assaulted her because if she feels that way, now would be the best time to come out about it.
---
I like some of the music drakes in, sicko mode went hard, but fuck man something about him is just cringy in everything that he does lol.

&gt; a game made for 12 year olds

Excuse me sir, you have to be 13 to play this game!

that was hard to watch

You can show it now

Sincere question is the OP too much screeching? Idk if I could contain myself either if I were in his shoes lol
---
I know that i mean the display area
---
You're a hero. TY. 
---
zulrah
---
What about it is not good, though?
---
Because their game has gone to shit because of ezscape once before already. I and many others began playing OSRS when it released because of it being harsher and slower. Lately a lot of new people have jumped in and been demanding the changes that we originally fled from.
---
It sucks when the game and community that you were part of and enjoyed from the start is hijacked by others. Nothing else to it.
---
Jordans and an elder maul usually do the trick. 
---
&gt;What's up with the self quoting though?
---
I do it when I have to continuously repeat something I already said.
---
&gt;it's not subtle enough for a good troll.
---
Says the guy who gets asked bout when AHK ban/shift click happened, then turn around and ask the questioner the same question as if the questioner doesn't already know the answer.
---
Like I said, you would give Serene a headache with how much of a dumbfuck you are.
---
The fuck you here for then
---
Also smaller question I've got 2 hunting levels to gain before I go back to aerial, did they add the exchange 100 pearls for the golden boi with the last update?
---
The AOC is 16. 
---
If two consenting 16 year olds have sex, which one is the pedophile, Tantilating?

23/2 + 7 = 18.

At 23 years old you can be with someone 18 and up without it being creepy. Half + 7.

At least one Jmod on the OSRS team is maxed, but I forget who. A lot of them used to play, but I imagine that working on the same game for years would dissuade you from wanting to play.

---
Well, if you upgraded that means you already had bronze. 
---
Bronze is 3 months, 5 bonds. 
---
Silver is 6 month, 10 bonds. 
---
You paid 5 bonds to go from bronze to silver, which takes you from 3 to 6 month, which is 3 additional months. 
---
You've lifted a weight off my shoulder holy moly guacamole thank you so much

Are you asking what it means?

Hey everyone. So I recently got lucky at zulrah and demonic gorillas after doing about 200 of both, and ended up with 30m in cash. What should I purchase with it? I currently have 84 mage/83 range/79 melee stats/70 prayer/51 construct/72 slayer. I have blowpipe, whip, ahrims, trident of seas, ring of suffering, fury, occult. My question is, what should my upgrade be (for zulrah/slaying). I currently get 1 kill (avg. time of 3:10) per trip at zulrah and want to maybe increase that. But I also want to lvl up my slayer, and would not mind spending money to get 83 con for a nice house (I barely use my house currently). What should I focus on in terms of upgrading at the moment? 
---
Since (23/2)+7=18.5, no.  Thats not what theyre saying.

0/10

Serene could do better.

I agree, drake isn't the best, but fuck off with your stupid ass.
---
magic can be interrupted by level ups as well as other interfaces, dragging you forwards to melee, running out of runes, just a few possibilities, but as your items are on the floor something messed up, possibly due to the disconnection and thus it moved you forwards. report it as a bug if you want and they will have a short log of what happened.
---
Did you ever figure this out? I was googling this question up and came across your post. Definitely a good question. 
---
Nah you seem pretty mad, I'd give myself a 6.

I'm sorry if that's the case for you but it's just that 5pm EST is typically the maximum player count in-game and it would make the most sense to do it then.
---
So I was curious about this and here's the math I came up with. Note that I'm not entirely sure about the 1 catch every 5 game ticks part so if someone has a better number for me to throw in there I'd be happy to fix it.
---
1/100 (scales with level up to 1/75 but we’ll assume the lowest) chance of getting a Molch Pearl
---
100 Molch Pearls per Angler piece
---
4 Angler pieces
---
~30-40,000 catches for the full set
---
1 catch every 3 seconds
---
~25-33 hrs to get full angler
---
Hate to say it but Fishing Trawler is still the way to go.
---
The rate isn't any different from cutting and dropping 
---
I mean you never know. /s
---
But she didn't tho
---
&gt; That's how it's always been though,
---
It hasn't been though. The wilderness existed before KBD, it existed before green dragons, it was just a place for people who wanted to fight each other, to go and fight each other.
---
Over the years more, and more, and more non PVP content has been added to the wildy to draw in more people and more people who don't actually want to PVP.
---
They're drawn in for no reason other than fodder for people who want to PVP, but don't actually want to fight anyone who's going to fight back.
---
Does anyone actually make money PKing those people? No, not really. As you yourself said, they're probably averaging a glory and a spade per kill. You'd make more money killing cows.
---
So they're just doing it for fun. Their fun is predicated on inconveniencing others. That's the issue here.
---
&gt; It seems nobody ever had a problem with this until osrs came along
---
For what it's worth, this same conversation has happened on the RS3 subreddit, after they've made big "wilderness rejuvenation" efforts. When things were added just to fill the wildy, that's one thing. When specific, obvious and blatant efforts were made, not to encourage real PVP, but to lure in skillers and PVMers into the wildy just to give PKers something to do, since they no longer fight each other.
---
&gt; the wilderness should always be a harsh place
---
The wilderness is a PVP area. And should return to a place where it's nothing but that.
---
Why is this even upvoted? You'd have to be genuinely retarded to think removing this tree would make it anywhere close to being the quickest way to a fairy ring.
---
Depends on the mood
---
That's intense. Congrats man

Zulrah. Insanely easy with a t bow and a breeze on mobile. If you don’t know how to do zulrah then learn up on the tourney worlds while you can.
---
Why are you downvoting me for asking a question I genuinely want to just hear your discussion on it..
---
Why should everything be catered to 1 def pures? I would say no.

LOL, you still here. Give yourself a 0 for being invested in something which you were "done" with.
---
mughinn, what do you call someone who installs blinds on windows, makes rap music, and touches little girls?
---
I can't blame you, that's a fucking giant dopamine rushportunity. Please keep up the amazing attitude and content, I love this shit.
---
If you're auto casting and you level up and it stops you auto casting it wont turn off your auto cast and make you melee 
---
Jesus it's Jason Bourne 
---
Ok yeah that's run for sure.
---
1) online poll results showed some things didnt pass.
---
2) in game poll shows everything passed
---
3) this I believe is because online shows the didn't vote option as a percentage.
---
4) does that mean they didnt pass if so I believe that's silly a skip question shouldnt mean a no.
---
5) my test was with a previous poll spellbook icons, it had 75 percent yes if you dont account for the skips and it isnt in the game.
---
My question could be more simply put do skips count as a no and if so why? 
---
Mod Bruno
---
Its a I(eye) on the front not an L
---
Normal? Different things are always rising and crashing... If you mean because of konar, little low but nothing insane
---
Sure, you *could* but it would be incredibly inefficient. Better off just ranging normally. Unless you know of any good chinning spots that someone with no quests or slayer levels can access. 
---
Don't vote yes for the other heads either, they first suggested turning them in for slayer points which i think we'd all prefer over prayer xp
---
Bars don't sell for more, the total cost of the ore is always more than the price of a bar regardless of how prices fluctuate. You'll want to find another method to make money. 
---
Haven't listened to it yet because on train to work, but in my experience settled is reasonable so it's probably well deserved reaction
---
Look at you trying to act like you’re on the high road. You put yourself into this by being a douchebag. 
---
It’s annoying when you ask a question and someone responds with some dumb shit. Like I don’t already know I’m not a member. 
---
So because jagex doesn’t want me to be able to sell my members items after I’ve already lost my membership means I need to use common sense? You should try that for yourself. 
---
Common sense says I should able to sell the item if I have it in my inventory. 
---
You should try using some common sense kiddo 
---
Max player count is usually around 7pm est because most people will be home from work/school by then. Maybe consider moving it? If not, congrats on everything you've done and goodluck with the future!
---
Sorry bot :(
---
Doesn't apply to Cox, already had the +3 from overloads. As someone with max gear I will use serp helm LITERALLY EVERYWHERE where I use scythe, here's a list of such places: (writing)
---
it costs more than potions and does less dps
---
I wouldn’t call him humble lol
---
This... I need more people selling them :)
---
Did u buy gold lol, just asking cause you got low stats in slayer and other money making skills to be at 5 mill.
---
Audi isn't Ely blue. Immersion ruines
---
https://i.imgur.com/3trjJKE.png 50m lol
---
Still a quarter of the cost of dragon bones, but is the extra time spent really worth it?
---
Hahaha they literally gave you the answer. The exact answer you asked for and you shit on it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hahahaha the level of stupidity you display is astounding. I love it 💖
---
Gratz!
---
Entangle poll failed like 3 times already and they're still repolling it. What gives. I understand the serp helm buff, but it's honestly not necessary... we don't need to raise max str even higher... we already had avernic/ferocious/rapier this year alone... that's an additional +7 to the previous max with tent...
---
The website is wrong. The game and actual poll decisions only consider the percentage of people who voted yes out of everyone who voted yes or no, but the website considers the percentage of people who voted yes out of all participants, including those who skipped the question.
---
Fix your clocks.
---
Go to Zulrah in the Aussie PvP world. You might just find me there again
---
It's not. Serp still has better defensive bonuses and venom immunity.
---
Why are you quitting? Perfect time for petscape
---
TIL Vorkath has no requirements.
---
Anything involving balance, stats, or new equipment is not qol. Qol is stuff like making a small clickbox slightly bigger, adding hotkeys to teleports/dialogue, etc.
---
No downsides
---
Alright, I'll report it as a bug. I'm still amazed that something like that can happen.
---
Coif shouldn't be included in the same question.
---
It’s a bad habit he picked up before he got his teeth fixed. He still does it from time to time 
---
I mainly skill and barely ever do pvm or pvp stuff. Lemme click rocks / trees in peace.
---
idk what 99% of the stuff in this game does bc I hardly ever had membership back in the day. 
---
who cares bridding shouldn't be about how accurately you can Fkey  and click an icon. It should be about timing and catching your opponent unawares.   The fact that people want 'bridding skill' to be based on how good you are at clicking a tiny mage spell book icon is bad game design imo.   The skillgap should be outplaying your opponent, not if you manage to get a freeze of depending if you misclick. 
---
Why? still won’t be able to wear body.
---
Ok so everything did pass? If so why haven't the spell book sizes been added. 
---
You’re a fucking STUD 
---
Support. Pking in free max gear was the most fun I've had in Runescape for a long time. I didn't even have a YouTube video playing on the side, 100% focus on the game. That's rare for me.
---
Can confirm fell for it.
---
"Free teleports to camelot"

Sure why not.

I had some food on me, but it wasnt enough. I lost a lot of stuff..
---
#**low tier bait**
---
if he levelled up and the message was there while disconnecting, on reconnecting his client would be trying to attack the ent, but there is a ""bug"" with the level up message being open and clicking to attack the monster again, it moves the person next to the npc before trying to autocast again, so yes he would continue using magic, but he would be in melee range. i would say you can test it but it would require levelling up, i just know it from training on low level accounts
---
Lol thanks not gonna like I can hit a nice 3

I did whatever ones had a good margin and it’s fairly slow but it’s profit

I have a pair of wireless Corsair Voids and they're the best headset I've ever used. Got sick of nearly necking myself, tripping over or spilling my drinks. Never had an audio issue, I play games like Escape from Tarkov and Rainbow 6 Siege and i'm constantly asked "How the fuck can you hear him" or asked how my directional sound is so good.
---
?  
---
wasn't being sarcastic, exclude yourself from our exchange
---
Funnily enough, the PvP community started the initiative to start OSRS, primarely started by so wreck3d, a pvp youtuber.. but nowadays everybody forgot about that and pvp is neglected.
---
Pop!
---
champs and vambs are fine as they don't change anything.  coifs are a big no.  the snare/entangle stuff is an attempt to separate the huge divide between ancients and standard, but is not QoL.  Serp helm is also a flat no.
---
I agree with you there, I don't plan on voting yes. I'm just explaining the issue everyone is having with your argument.
---
uhhh im 23 and I would definitely feel more than a bit creepy afterwards for making unknowing moves on a girl that's still in high school, while ive finished college. going for a 17 year old at my age is definitely not cool... 
---
you'd definitely get called a pedophile for good reason - in this specific age gap there's really not much at all you have in common with people that are still in high school
---
But yeah sure keep going on about how going for high school girls is alright, when we're grown ass men. fucking weirdo
---
I will my dude

You might have the greatest username ive ever seen

Excuse me whT the fuck

damn that 2 str is such a drag
---
its not the same anymore.... you're like a 2 def pure at this point
---
The spellbooks icon one might be the worst one to use as a test case because it was actually repolled multiple times due to issues with the wording. Only thing I can offer ya.
---
Found the pedo
---
I'm not sure if your familiar with this subreddit but people here really hate rs3 and asking for features from it in OSRS is basically treated like a war crime. 
---
Yessir. I started playing about 2 and a half months ago now, only on mobile. Absolutely love the game. Just hit 950 total level as well :)
---
considering I only found out about you this week. The grind really didn't feel that long. Would you mind doing it again so I can get extra hyped? /s
---
Get a trident of the swamp first! With the remaining money you should have enough to hit 82 construction for an ornate pool. 
---
In the grand scheme, yes. Diminishing returns.
---
Dealing 1 damage, then dealing 2 damage is +100%. 
---
The point is, you can't call it 'nothing'. It *is* something. It's just not a lot.
---
Doesn’t sound like a bad idea, the only thing you’d be risking is items equipped. Quick question, how do you add the “flair” thing to your post? The option doesn’t come up on mine.
---
Organized crime?
---
pure because you can always turn it into a main
---
There are mass amounts of high value items coming into the game and just like he said earlier there is zero risk while pvming. So people get max gear and farm out high reward bosses and things like raid and easily bring things like t bows and claws into the game. So as all these items drop in price because the demand does not meet the supply the economy is starting to crash. So if nothing changes then we’ll end up with an inflated to shit economy like rs3. Also hide poll results please lol
---
Litteraly unplayable 
---
Good idea. Always worried about the gear on my character. I have the authenticator and pin, sometimes I can’t bank before I log out so I stay with like 130m worth of gear on me. If they can’t get past my bank pin they still get more than half my bank.

Also, what about the boots? Currently the only option for range boots that don't require defence are Ranger Boots that cost 36m.
---
Do strength next.
---
sounds like mod CHAD 
---
19/24 is *completely* different from 17/23. At 19 you shouldn't be living with your parents anymore - you've either been in college or have been working for over a year. There's nothing wrong with a 24 year old dating a 19 year old here in the US either. You probably won't be able to relate to each other that well, if you're each where you're supposed to be in terms of maturity.. but to each their own I guess
---
What I don't understand is why the age of consent in some countries in the EU is 14 - that's fucked. But yeah us Americans are the weird ones
---
You *pooped* in the refrigerator! And you ate a whole wheel of cheese? 
---
Right. Too bad his next clue step has nothing to do with the slayer master and OP just can’t click. 
---
Whens the next swampletics episode my dude? Binge watched it lol. Great content!

Play it full blast on the train... you won't 
---
Only sex offenders go B

I go B idk why but I fucking hate the other bank. Lol

Missed out on b2b opportunity smh

this just made me miss WoW a whole bunch...questing in OSRS sucks

Ugh, if you do this in a f2p world we're going to have jokebots soon.

!flair D

Doge on suicide watch
---
Not today, hombre. Not today.
---
I don't get this, someone skulltricked me at Edgeville Druids and I instantly sprinted 6 steps East to safety. They almost never have the magic level to Teleblock you or Ice Barrage, but even if they do they have to do both in order to make you vulnerable. If they TB, you run. If they Freeze/snare you, Glory out. Do people actually die to this at such low wilderness?
---
Gratz! Mobile only is tough for boss fights

Finally the game is playable
---
I know he acknowledges the other terms in the rest of the video. But let's be real, this comment section is a reaction to the first minute of the video, and he still acts like a drama queen.
---
What can I say? I have a nose for justice. The truth jumps out and bops me on my schnozz of fair treatment, and calling for the ban of an innocent man is unlawful. Maybe I'm the only one with the balls to call you out for harassing a typical rev PVMer (1 item due to threat of being pked/skull tricked), but god damn it if I won't stand up for him. Please stop killing him.
---
Need. Lul. 
---
not really
---
source: have been a 20 year old
---
I believe Steve Jobs would've said apples and computers are quite alike.
---
It's the absence of immediate sound that tells you it's ranged.
---
"Unrestricted worlds are now open for the duration of the Twitch Prime promotion."  What's the twitch prime promotion?
---
For ranged in particular there is a difference for sure. Increased max hit and accuracy and a faster average kill time. 
---
There's been many requests about exchanging boss heads for Slayer points but Jagex doesn't seem to accept that idea.
---
Frankly, the second best idea is: "at Slayer Masters, allow us to exchange our spare Boss Heads for a task of the same kind of the head. E.g.: 1 Vorkath's Head &gt; 1 free Blue Dragon task. *When exchanging Dark Claws, you will be able to pick either a Greater Demon or a Black Demon task.* If you happen to have a block on the task you're eligible for, nothing will happen."
---
People who still kill black demons
---
we pay we gay
---
Only 125ish MBps
---
You trying to give us a seizure?
---
I actually don't like this feature. I'd prefer the item I click on to be put in bank, not the closest to the too
---
\&gt; My friends all say main pking is just as fun    
---
main pking is 10&lt; people at peak time (in pvp worlds) half of which sit around in dhides and rune gloves prodding ags.  
---
you can't BH pk on mains as there's no one there your level, below level 20 atleast, but above you're mostly going to be bullied by singles clans.  
---
We want the video!
---
It's ”take a seat, dear"
---
Played WoW for ten years I think blizzard is just killing the game tbh

what are you on about, mate? age of consent in some parts of the us is 16.. so a 16 year old could fuck a 46 year old, legal.

Can upload olm head in raw footage xd

That's what I've seen people say, but it's usually met with the response that there essentially ISN'T a Blizzard to break off anymore, even if it wanted to.  That Activision did not just buy Blizzard (unlike the Bungie relationship) but rather merged with them.  The implication is that the culture change has already irreversibly set in, and key people have been lost.   I'm not sure how accurate that is though, I love (or loved, anyway) Blizzard games and I do want to see them take a hit so that they can somehow wake up in one way or another ("breaking off" or not) and make some changes to how they're doing things.
---
The d long spec lmaoooo
---
Yes it is stfu
---
Melkwyrm Silk Robes actually.  Supposedly the white dragon wyrms (lil larvae) would spit out silk and the Ferynts in Varyka would steal the Melkwyrms to harvest their silk.  Before Arrav was cursed he was actually one of the first cave raiders to steal Melkwyrms!

You can manually add them in the Ground items settings, very first option. Write the item names separated with a comma.
---
Also, a native OSRS function, you can make an untradable drop be highlighted in the chat. (settings&gt;light bulb icon)
---
lo #2 and #10 are straight troll

It's less a hate for runescape and more a sadness his baby is dying on it's last legs. He has like 97% completion on wow or some ridiculous shit. 96% achievements and 98% uniques collected.
---
Yeah lmfao, cost me like 25-30m to get from 47-83 construction and build an ornate jewellery box &amp; pool, and I wasn't even doing mahoganies.
---
Ha! You just revealed my trap card!
---
It’s a part of the game mode. The restrictions were in place  when you made the account, and the alternative to changing those mechanics would be compromising game integrity. I don’t think that changing this solely for iron men is a fair thing to do in the game.
---
It’s a super cliche argument, but for almost every suggested Ironman-exclusive update it essentially is just complaining about the restrictions of the game mode. It’s tough and challenging to get a BiS item, it should be a grind.
---
For context, I have disagreed with almost all of the new instanced boss rooms. I don’t think everyone in the game should be allowed to kill a boss at the same time. Competition for the worlds is the downside to keep item prices high. Although this isn’t exactly the same bc the drops will be given to Ironmen, people can and will still drop trade dupes... it won’t increase the amount of items in game as much as if there was a payable instance available to everyone, but it still will increase the amount of items in game.
---
I think he is going for inferno gear
---
Getting blessed chaps would be so helpful for me as a pure that likes to use this account for some PvM &amp; slayer as well
---
He’s like R.Kelly minus the pee pee stuff and keeping girls captive. He’s still a bit of a pedo IMO
---
You’re calling me “mate” and telling me age of consent is 16 lol I’m from california. 6ix9ine is 22 and a girl that was 17 was naked on his lap and was called a rapist and ruined his career. Yeah it’s “legal” where you’re from and the fact that you think a 46 yr old being with a 16 yr old is completely fine to you, idk why im wasting my time here lol nice mentality btw. Literally the ONLY place where age of consent is 16 is Washington state. EVERYWHERE ELSE, it’s 18 in the states. 
---
Yeah my concerns wouldn't be about how this affects mains really, but more those accounts like pures who have limitations. I'm in favour of the content being inherently harder for these people but reducing their points even if they have to work harder for them just doesn't seem productive. But I really don't want them to make any changes to content in a difficulty sense for these accounts at all
---
God this is so pathetic. /u/SettledRS sorry bro, but one day you'll see you wasted your life away on this game just as i did and it'll be too late.
---
Can we ban this please?
---
He's making deposits
---
Am I not able to get teleports if I am free to play? I wanted to do mini quests to get my runecrafting up but the guide I watched said teleports were needed. 
---
LMAO try driving at 14/15 and legally permitted at 16
---
Also try guns at like 14/15 with no background check, just walk in walk out. But Americans still wanna take the moral high ground on most social issues because "lol everywhere else is a godless shithole"
---
If you know you know
---
You give me hope. 56 def atm. Not even halfway to 75 😭
---
Took me 132 raids to see an item in my name, 10 raids later another, just keep raiding, it’s going to pay off 
---
This guy is truly a iron man, no concept of social skills.
---
Pretty much everyone in 1st-world countries have done that. It’s called graduating school. *Plenty* of people also do things like run marathons raising money for causes, master music or acting to entertain the masses, etc. Point being accomplishment comes in all shapes and sizes, and this accomplishment specifically serves precisely dick to society, apart from fueling the lasagna and bread industries. He can be happy and that’s good but it doesn’t mean he’s not really anything more than a burden 
---
6 years isn't a big difference when you're talking 40 and 34, because they're much older so 6 years is a smaller difference. You think it'd be cool for a 21 year old to be dating a 15 year old?
---
You stop trying to justify dudes who are old enough to be graduated from university fucking around with high school girls, unless that's what you're into, of course.
---
"Isnt even that long" brother its 19k over the drop rate are you daft
---
&gt;The irony of construction being a literal money pit
---
You can unlock and use any teleport to any ftp location. 
---
I didn't think so, just the drops with the alchables wasn't it?
---
Yeah, from disgust
---
you are just wrong, the age of consent is 16 in ohio as well as others, which you mentioned L0. and i never condoned it, fella just said it was legal. 
---
pure facts, no personal opinion. i used that age to emphasize how wild it is, but just fact. 
---
I have an itch and only osrs hits the perfect spot
---
Talk to one of the soldiers fighting the shamans in canyon or slayer  only cave.
---
the lack of reward for completing this is demotivating.  
---
atleast toss me an insignificant cosmetic upgrade for my fire/infernal cape on the regular server or some shit.
---
Well I did say they started dating a year earlier when they would have been 23/18. Age of consent is 16 in like a 1/3 if the us too.. and it depends on how you define adults. Is adults anyone over 18? So an 18 yo can't have sex with a 17 year old? Like where's the limit for 18 your olds.
---
Wow :) 
---
Trust me and we will escape from the city!
---
You're retarded as fuck. I don't agree with buying gold but let people play the game the way they want. It doesn't affect you. Stfu
---
I nominate you as the OSRS PvP ambassador
---
Just head on over to the top of the Slayer tower. You'll get the Bell Gargoyles and Ornstein and Smough fight all in one. 
---
Ugh do I just play a main so I can do everything even though the pking is slightly less fun 
---
I'll always have the pure to play on 
---
Thank god he’s Canadian!
---
I'm guessing it will get announced/activated over the weekend or on monday and they didn't realise the delay/change before releasing the blog.
---
Wow 3 whooshes b2b this is truly a momentous occasion.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
bet that shit slaps
---
That was hilarious. The excitement OSRS 🙌🏻
---
&gt;Watching reaction videos

There's your problem. His Dark Souls streams were pretty good, don't care for his WoW content though.

My alt has 82 slayer and I am just now starting to skill to do mm2 so I can train mage down on the monkeys
---
Nothing that gives me that sense of accomplishment and pride is not funny.
---
I dont think ANYONE
---
Everywhere. It's a +3 max hit. That's pretty fucking huge.
---
High end gear costs money to use. If the ends justify the means, people will make use of the additional strength bonus it offers. Chambers and tob are the two best money makers in game; those are two places you would benefit greatly. Faster runs = more money.
---
Give it like 4 days. New one came out yesterday and they take a long ass time to make.

As someone who has literally killed over 5,000 people in the rev caves, using entangle, I am far from confident that the buff to entangle poll question will ever pass!

The OG client would stop responding. Happened at gorillas twice I think.

OSRS doesn't have a very strong reputation in the industry, most people look at the archaic designs, surface level simplicity, and how it doesn't conform to industry norms and just brush it off as some niche relic of childhood days.

we got a birthday boy!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

F2p teleports are limited to very few items such as the chronicle as well as the f2p locations on the standard spellbook. If you're trying to find teleportation tablets on the ge you won't find much success because those tablets are members only.
---
whataya mean? the hype hasnt Settled yet
---
For the fight caves use black d'hide. 
---
I feel like you're overlooking the main reason why people use god d'hide.
---
What phone/tablet do you use? 
---
When I got 99 farming I was too cheap to not cut them down myself and tried to recoup some of the cost from logs. Mfw I got a beaver doing that. Mfw I still don’t have tangleroot at 99 farming but got a fucking beaver cutting down a patch. 
---
Bro that’s like graduated college and a high schooler that’s fucking weird lmaooo
---
I’m really sick of people using autistic as a slur. People were being dicks to you. Call them dicks. I have autism. I don’t feel compelled to harass people and act like a douchebag because of autism, I mind my own business because autism comes with a crap ton of social anxiety. You have so many options to use as insults and instead you call people autistic for acting the furthest thing from autistic. 
---
... Next raid after this post I get claws.  Thanks Jagex Gods &lt;3
---
18 year old and 17 year old?
---
I think there should be a tournament arena where you fight other dudes at a scheduled time for points the tournament winner get the most points and you exchange points for items like herbs and stuff and it's a safe mini game lots of people would have fun and basically you get rewarded for contributing to pvp
---
Neither of them
---
Hope you’re carrying a homeward bone
---
Sample size: probably not even 1% of the community. sick post. 
---
Thanks!
---
Offense bonus
---
Sad thing is that you're 100% correct, but efficiency nerds and RS3 migrants will still downvote you into oblivion anyway.
---
You're not wrong
---
Except you already brought Serp to ToB, so that doesn't change at all. I guess a +3 max hit for Scythe could help with raids, although that's another switch you're now taking on top of the Ferocious Gloves switch that was just added.
---
So question repeated: where is this "everywhere?" 
---
However you wanna justify it. 
---
Because it gives my scythe +3 max hits...?
---
This would quest lock you out of a majority of content. 
---
I wish character faces looked like this. 
---
Do you enjoy sapping the life out of everything or do you just hate yourself?
---
In the last thread I asked for help about training constr for the ardy hard diary and I was told to work from 58 to 60 and use the poh tea boost plus my crystal saw to get 65. Does anyone know what i should be building/training with to get to 60? 
---
You forget that drop trading exists. It'd be OP to have an Ironman farming bandos for gp even if it wasn't rwt.
---
For fucking real..
---
Such as what
---
Me, i keep putting off spending on crafting
---
-gasp- they're giving us lots of content?! WHAT? BLASPHEMY! 
---
Respect. Good luck man! 
---
~30 superiors killed, got it from a gargoyle.
---
Well from 248kc that’s kind of what you would expect lol. Statistically 
---
robin hat doesn't degrade and the price doesn't fluctuate heavily either, you can use it to train and sell it back to the GE without losing any money.
---
the only situation in which price would be relevant is when you are risking the item, which you are not outside of PvP situations.
---
&lt;3
---
Oh no, new content! How terrible! D:
---
I can’t see Bobby brown so it’s not true 
---
Coming back to the game after a break. Where is this that he’s killing shamans?
---
Mostly because it is annoying. like we are already 90% of the way there. just let me shift click all certain items into my bank. It will make it feel better and go faster.
---
also sometimes i click the deposit inventory button, then i have to spend time grabbing everything that i need out of my bank again.
---
Man I wanna do raids so bad but I don't have the stats. 
---
That’s insane, GZ!
---
You should ask a pmod to lower your strength to 1.
---
Amen
---
But that's one of the main points of the wilderness. They don't put content in there that gives higher exp rates or higher value drops for the laughs. You know what you're getting into when you go there. If you doing clues, take the bare minimum to kill the wizard and a clue box just in case. Pkers can also flag you down as a scout for a larger clan and they don't want that who barrel of monkeys flying in.
---
Fucking what??? You fucking can get that fucking thing back? Fuck fuck fuck 
---
Hi, Schwimmkerze!
---
I hope you have the best day ever!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
Price is relevant because I didn't have 3m to buy it in the first place. 
---
Does the Iasor seed speed up Hespori's growth rate?
---
Are kalphites a good task to block? 
---
Leveling defence is inefficient before 99 strength/attack because it generally doesn't increase your exp rates any. Unlocking gear does slightly increase it due to strength bonus and less food needed, but that stops at 80. That said, you don't *lose* anything by leveling defence if you're not going for some sort of pk build, so don't worry too much about it. 
---
Humble :)

Why though?

QoL Poll question #73: Should players be given the max cape upon completion of tutorial island?
---
Isn’t this the dude who sucks dick at Dark Souls?
---
There is already a rankings for BH.
---
I think it’s perfect like this. People shouldn't fight for a rank, they should fight for the fun.
---
But where's swampletics? Kappa Fucking gratz mate.
---
Imagine having taste this bad
---
any new bosses with big drops from here on should be around half this difficult.
---
Well, if your RS login and pass gets out in a leaked database, then you used it somewhere other than RS.  Definitely a big no-no for securing your account.
---
Though seems to me like Jagex account recovery should take with a grain of salt anyone trying to recover an account with passwords that have been "publicly leaked".  [It's not like it would be hard for them to check this.](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
---
Ye I wish the difficult was in flicking the boss for longer trips, rather than log in limit
---
Yep that’s the point of this post
---
Nice fashionscape, love it!
---
Either minnows or infernal eels unless you dont mind it taking millennia
---
Lol its obviously a trick, hell double your money.

Hi Swettledletics, I'm approaching 30,000 KC on my IM.
---
Can you please wish me some streamer luck?
---
15 Curved Bones and 0 DWH right now and it's pretty rough on my spirits. 
---
Thanks and keep up the Swampyness! 
---
Are there any plans to make the unlocked worlds permanent? I think it's so cool being able to practice PvM (especially since I'm nowhere near high enough level to do most things) with no risk and test out different equipment.
---
Isn't the coif better than archer helm? That alone should be enough of a reason to say no. 
---
Young LaFlame, he in Sicko Mode
---
With the sponsors and events he attends, I don’t doubt that. 
---
Nah. Tekton was a shit boss that was wildly inconsistent. 
---
No, go get quest cape.
---
Dude you are dense AF. You think I don’t know I’m not a member? Are you that fucking stupid? I asked this question to see the real reason why. Which is to get me to spend $11. You are so fucking stupid it’s astounding. That dude who said “because you’re not a member” is trying to be funny and state the fucking obvious. Thanks captain obvious you dumb fuck. 
---
How fucking hard would it be to allow me to sell a fucking item I own in game in a f2p world? 
---
You must think you’re so smart lmao 
---
Tell ‘em what they win, Johnny!
---
I’m happy with any meta where you don’t have to camp protection from magic instead of smiting because of a Korasi banging you out for 80 damage. 
---
120k/hr oof... that blows
---
Drake likes taking underage females into Marvins Room
---
Can you do the math for 30,000 kc? I'm approaching that right now on my IM.
---
I explained why you can’t do that. But you just wanna be mad 😂😂😂 I love how spun up you are even though we have you all the answers you asked for 😂😂😂😂😂 what a childish prick haha hahahaha
---
srupid fuck
---
I once bought a bit of hair off a gentleman at the Grand Exchange for 100k. 
---
Do you even realise how much effort all these things are vs an easy diary, it's there for that reason.
---
That’s at the first lvl u can fish em
---
Just off the top of my head a couple of the mods on the osrs team have maxed accs but go off
---
Good bot
---
I did sharks pre-eoc and that took forever to get 99. Probably the reason I’m only 72 fishing in OSRS.
---
^ yup I got jad on my first attempt... I messed up a few times but got lucky and he didn’t hit me very high
---
My first master clue required me to get 80 Slayer and kill a Nechryael. I got it pretty early on in my account's life so it sat in my bank for a while.
---
Made like 90k from it. Worth. 
---
stams too smh
---
But the real question is: would you have done all that without the clue? 
---
You probably unlocked a lot more content for yourself in the process. 
---
Thanks for the info
---
Huh okay, I only watch pkers on youtube never actually do it so there I see a decent amount of robins. But I trust your opinion more.
---
Dude this is the realist shit I’ve read today. 
---
Alright, they're not "Meta-defining and game-changing", does that change how anyone actually votes? I don't think so.
---
If MLM didn’t exist I wouldn’t even be close. 
---
They'll never make it permanent because people would just camp those worlds and get bored of the main game.
---
Happened again @ 10 KC lmao.
---
&gt;I’m 26. I'm grown up-

Lmao I’m spun up? You know you can cuss without being mad? And you guessed why. You don’t know for sure lmao. Jagex is just desperate for that money. 
---
Your use of emojis really state how young you really are.

I knew this was going to happen to you when the scandal was first brought to light about 1petatatime lol
---
💯
---
Yep, going to play for WoW for a while.... Too many good memories sparked by this...
---
No it isn’t, not everyone has hundreds of millions in the bank, so paying 3m for +1 attack bonus and less def and prayer isn’t worth it for most
---
Yeah and you get better fairy rings that will remain so regardless if that tree is removed, so what's your point? And I really doubt it's there for that reason, because the tree was placed there before the diaries were a thing.
---
I was so offended by that &gt;:( (Estonian btw) (NA ed btw)
---
People will just buy stuff on alt on GE and sell to their non GE account! I thought about this and there’s just no way around it unfortunately!
---
Hey, I'm not the person you replied to (I'm OP) but I just added the XP portion to it in order to achieve more parity with High Alch, as Dissolving as a concept seems to be very closely related to High Alching, just as a source of materials rather than GP.
---
Otherwise, I do admit that it would be a pretty small addition to the "gameplay experience" with quite a lot of far-reaching ramifications. I still personally like the idea of it, but thanks for letting me know some of the biggest concerns! : )
---
I hit 97 fishing a few days ago and I've gotten 4 pets so far. It's a wild ride at sacred eels.

Yep. These polls should just be called "QoL and Balance month"

before he starts screaming "YES" you could easily cut this into any liveleak video lol
---
im 600k~ xp away from 99 slayer without MM2 or DS2 lel
---
First calculate the probability that you won't have it by 30k KC.
---
(4999/5000)^30000=0,002477. Then 1-this is the probability that you will have it, or 99,7522%. 
---
0,002477*5000=12,39. So 12,39 people won't have it at 30k KC.
---
Looooooooooooool I meant swampletics, spaced that one bruh
---
12/5,000
---
(4,999/5,000)^30,000 = 0.002477 = odds you don’t get the hammer 30.000 kills in a row
---
0.002477 / 1 = 12 / 5.000
---
The head lmao 
---
Maybe if you're doing a crap skill like SLAYER, lol. 
---
thats a good fucking meme
---
If u watch it at 1,5x speed his vids are okay
---
High alch is based on the "shop value" of an item. Many items alch for 60% of what it would cost to buy from a general store when the quantity is 1, but there are many exceptions.
---
The current ge price is only a guide for what an item should be traded at, and has no affect on alch values.
---
That dwarf has saved me about 20 cannons on my way to 99 slayer..the true mvp
---
Wew lad
---
What are all the slayer tasks that can be burst/barraged? I know of dust devils, smoke devils and nechs - are there any others?
---
I’m at 4079 kc now and all I want is the pet. Got two magma mutagens around 1300 or something, never got tanzanite mutey, pet, or jar
---
I love it!! Nice work. Just got lost on the sub. 
---
coif is +1 range bonus and +2 range def so yes this would change the pure/45 def meta for range (tho with 45 def u could just use void)
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PiliableOptimisticTigerPoooound
---
That is the clip if anyone wants to see his reaction.
---
Could be worse. Could be me with 99 farming and 99 woodcutting and \~600kc herbi with no beaver, tangleroot, or herbi (only kittens here) :(
---
Virtoso and tanzoo have an on-going challenge series where they go head to head and do silly things like "most loot from kbd".

Really entertaining videos. I believe they won a golden gnome last year :)

shut up serene

What is mlm?
---
So fucking funny
---
In that case you can make brews, restores, and prayer enhances at the (+) version. It's basically the "best" tiers of each potion. You can also make normal overloads, not tier 3 but tier 2.

Dude, I completely agree. A 23-year-old and a 17-year-old live in very different worlds. One is pre-maturation, and the other is post-maturation. At no other time in life would 6 years make such a difference. It's definitely creepy in almost any context.

If you are carrying nothing but a rcbow and runes you are accepting the death with no resistance and shouldn't be mad about it

Bought one for the necklace at like 950k. Just holding onto it now lol

Nice

I agree with you :/

I bought it yesterday to do pyramid plunder for clan thieving event then sold today for a tasty 1.4m profit

Practice ,practice ,practice. I killed zulrah my 18th attempt at first, just takes some time. Gl
---
Still no news on this?
---
Just practice.
---
Are you lvl 3? Which magic spell one shots you?
---
Are you considering making them? I wouldn’t. You get no xp and there are other money makers. If you’re wanting to use them at blast furnace, they make you good money and give you good xp
---
that hype
---
he should settle down
---
I brute forced Zulrah my first try no food left barely
---
Even did things right. I honestly think just learn 1-2

AHK is extremely a lot easier to be fast with than mouse click will ever be. Lots of people use AHK still becuase its just that much more comfortable than the point-and-click dropping that can get pretty annoying.

iPhone 7+ here and it’s crashed on me lately. It used to not though

Cmon brah. Just give the god swords +20 extra strength. And maybe +40 slash while we’re at it. It’s outclassed and I just want to use the weapon. You can even throw it behind a boss drop brah. Put it on alchemic hydra. Call it “alchemic god enhancer” brah. 
---
Obv what I meant was you don't want to make them harder because of that. Broken and intended or not my opinion is you should not be able to skip basically any raid room...
---
Right click the item after buying it and select the option to receive it unnoted?
---
yeah it really opens your eyes if you wernt taught much about financial literacy. 
---
ty i think every account has their own and size isn't what matters
---
Fuck off, mate. It was for the meme.

If you need to argue about the balancing of it it's not QOL.

I believe I just love having a lot of money in game. Makes me feel powerful and important. I live mostly on that game. It makes me happy having it in my bank. Thank you.

Right. But it would be more interesting as well as a gold sink. What’s slayer without being a hit man? 
---
Our education system just teaches us to be sheep’s for the rich. Nope, not me. 
---
People worshipped Zezima and top players because the userbase were like 10 years old back then. No one took into account that playing excessively was unhealthy.
---
Zezima is mainly criticized for playing with a lack of efficiency these days
---
He's a bit lesser known, but Wild_Mudkip is really fun to watch for this reason. He obviously just loves the game and it shows.
---
I actually invest in the stock market as well. I will check that book out for sure. Thank you.

Well my rsn is Wilma Cokfit

I do not really plan them. I usually just drop shit with out really telling anyone lol.
---
It was for the MEME BABY WOO. 
---
Oh yeah, range and hp are the ones to watch out for. If you balance cannoning the right mobs with bosses that give better slay xp than hp xp, you'll be golden. I finished with about 1m ranged xp to go and 500k hp xp. Also had 2.5 points left over, skip rng was good to me.
---
Buying rares. Drop parties.

If this is the case and he maintains that sub count for 12 months, he will make 420k a year from subs alone

The stockmarket is risky. but a 2 percent interest rate on a savings account is amazing. Trust me man, start investing in yourself. 
---
This is amazing! Good job bro and welcome to the gang 
---
Not either.
---
I should check that out. Thank you
---
hahaha, that's a good one
---
yeah they should make god wars drops rarer for accounts under 90cb. Because that makes a hell of a lot of sense.
---
idk then if you decide to buy pm me the drop party location and time

Dude wtf I was thinking to myself "how tf this guy gonna hit all the high notes with a trumpet?" He broke out that dope-ass whistle and I damn near smiled myself off my chair. Talented man over here, way to go brother.
---
 there's no way for a non-pure account to compete with a pure account. By being anything other than a pure you're accepting death if you enter the wildy, that's the problem I'm getting at. 
---
I think you are vastly overestimating pures. 
---
Also stop with the neutral way of speaking.."should"
---
"i will" should be your mantra...
---
its powerful
---
Not to get too spiritual here but close your eyes and use positive affirmations vs neutral ones. 
---
It closes the doors of "maybes" and "well perhaps not" and opens the doors for "why the hell not" and "worth a shot" 
---
I just got Tangleroot the other day from Hespori at 75 farming (งツ)ว

Anyone got a ds2 quest guide list and req list so I can rush it

Cuz he went to school for engineering and didn’t work as a scientist/researcher. He still knows a lot about science though.

Btw can you See the drops and the pets you have got before the update or no..?

How do you get that message to print? At least I passed soup?

why would i get 99 cooking before doing ds2? i have 235 qp and just recently leveled cooking from 72 to 80 last week

Three reasons, either they are shit xp, shit gp, or you just can't stand the task.

That's not an issue with the argument. It's saying that the answer is they should go for heads.
---
I'm just answering his question with a question who's answer is the answer to his question.
---
Pretty sure b0aty gets around $3.8~ / sub
---
This is a known lure, they've been doing it daily for several years. 
---
Unfortunately Jagex doesn't seem to care because its a "PvP world". Totally neglecting the fact that it is in fact a scam. The scammer is misleading their victim by pretending to sell/buy stuff to trick them in to moving in to a PvP area and kill them.
---
To be honest, Jagex should just disable trading in PvP worlds. Does anyone even legitimately trade there? 
---
Cool. No one cares about easy pets. Go get a real pet like hydra, gwd, wildy pet etc. 
---
Brilliant, the lizard shaman in the top right looks baked
---
Fire giants 
---
Korasi was nothing compared to what we have today. 
---
Its not bug. If someone trades you and walks away from you and you try to accept it, your character will automatically try to get near to the player that traded it. Sorry to break it to you, its 100% your fault. Its shitty thing to do from that guy. But its still your fault for falling for old trick like that. 
---
Really depends on the face and pair, tbh. Thick rims will make anyone look like a know it all douche bag. Thin rims, such as Woox's, are very neutral and can either add to or detract from attractive features. Before having seen Woox without his glasses I thought he just looked kind of awkward, but without his glasses he looks kinda like a military lad.
---
That doesn't even work...if you sell an item to a general store as an ironman, you can't buy it back because it's considered overstocked.
---
Make your self advertisement less obvious next time
---

I can rely that it is more relaxed comparing to paying attention at Zul’Rah all the time. Just wondering those coconut price changes currently going around 1740-1800 and blowpipe/serp visage rise, is it better gp/h average
---
Compost increases the yield of allotments, so it is worth using at least supercompost imo.

I did not expect the whistling, fantastic job!! What a great rendition of Sea Shanty 2. :)

The worst part is, it's going to jump back to max cash stack in price after the blowpipe gets nerfed into the dirt.

Good luck with the chuck man

"puzzle wasn't trivial so it was bad"

Nobody cares in dmm when u play for some real cash its different story.

Basically wingstone is a clue npc that's meant to be wandering around by the crevice in the desert, I usually have a hard time finding him and thought it was a bit funny that he's so far away

Cant wait for somone to start a Guthix follower only ultimate ironman. That only does things Guthix likes.

Runecrafting*

Huh
---
LMAO
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Before the recent climb in price, I'd say Vorkath was better money. But with the recent increase in value of Zulrah drops the two bosses are probably very close in gp/hr. Most likely still leaning towards Vorkath though due to lower cost of supplies.

Was going to help him transfer stuff over to his main I told him that he could just multi log by opening two clients but he just ignored that and i figured he was just a retarded noob so Id just help him do it regardless then get back to what I was doing. Once I figured out he was luring I wanted to take what he was 'transfering' then tab out.

Idk about you but the looks of it most gear items are going up in price
---
how is the gp/h for soloing arma and sara gwd?
---
would they be feasible with 95 range, 75 defence, acb, anguish/archer ring, and a mix of arma/blessed dhide armour?
---
should I just stay at brutal blacks?
---
It depends on what you want to do. Most tasks have some draw to them depending on what you want to do. 
---
For example, Suqahs and trolls are great for efficient slayer but are useless for cash. On the other end of the spectrum, Black Demons are pretty bad XP but are great cash at demonic gorillas.
---
I think most people are like me where it's a mix between both. So for me, what I block is those tasks that have no draw whatsoever. Drakes are a perfect example of this. They're a long task, you need to use prayer, you barely break even with profit, there's no superiors, they're average to bad xp, they're not not AFK and their rares are rare enough to not really add much to your trip if you get them at an average rate. They're a pretty clear block for me. 
---
There's no hard and fast rule to this, it's really just your personal preference. If you have a healthy block list and sometimes do some boring tasks you should keep enough points to warrant a few skips every now and then too. 
---
Happened to me with a fang, Luckily got another one 2 kills after which made me feel a bit better.

high iq post
---
But you responded to someone who was pointing out how strange the 18 years age of consent was in the US. 
---
You also referred to London (or a parody of the name), where the age of consent is 16. 
---
Either you messed up and are now backpedalling, or you geniunely think that having sexual relations with prepubescent children is a part of London culture.
---
Either way you're retarded.

There’s also the sulphur vent next to the chest in Mor-Ul-Rek (needs fire cape)

This is absolutely sensational, it moved me close to tears.

Thats just false. 16 is the youngest. Period.

Yea thats one that i should try

Dunno if this is a troll, but the player who got the Phoenix is called ‘reewards you’, it wasn’t you. You only roll the Phoenix when you open a crate

the player "reewards" got it.

Well before Zamorak went Brutus and Caesar on Zaros his followers were demons vampyres things of that nature. He came late to Gielinor and had to take the species that no one else wanted as followers
---
And most important and most powerful of his followers are the Mahjarrat, which Zamorak is. They have a reputation for being ruthless and powerful and conquered most of Gielinor before Zamorak killed Zaros and became a god from doing that. After that most of Zaros followers became Zamorak followers. Most Mahjarrat stayed loyal to Zaros like Azzanadra from Desert Treasure, some like Koschei the deathless from Fremmenik Trials followed Zamorak. Lucien and Sliske are kinda doing their own thing.
---
Since Zaros is mostly lost to legend they only have stories of his followers and that's how he became known as an evil god
---
I've completely given up on Blizzard. 
---
Username checks out for sure
---
Touche.
---
Trees for xp, herbs for profit. But always herbs, regardless of if you’re doing trees, herbs are always worth it 
---
Don't know if your trolling or not, but the player iD 'reewards' got the drop, not you! When you get a pet drop or a valuable drop, the text will be in red!

On the last update they mentioned that the Gold Premier Club package would be avaiable longer. I know the last date was Feb 4th, but I can't find the information for the extended avaiability. When will it end?
---
Jagex has lost it. sorry. I havn't played the last few weeks/months and for good reason. They dont know what to do anymore so they just release another slayer boss, they are constantly trying to sneak in changes into the game that make it worse for those that loved oldschool. They sweep everything under the rug they can or make their employees do it (or make them leave like ayiza probably).
---
now dont get me wrong i dont blame the oldschool team, I love them (nohomoexpectformaybealittlebitwithashbtw), I know they are just humans who try to do the best they can in their current situation but not whoever manages that shithole at Jagex, they are not.

---
Just training slayer really. From 75 onwards you can earn 2-3m gp in just 1 task. Theres no need to just camp 1 monster really. Plus you get more xp/hr cos the black mask (I) (or slayer helm (i)) gives you a 15 or 20% damage and accuracy boost, which speeds up how quickly you kill the slayer monster (only works on task)
---
Meh just seems like a bad life choice

Because it was such a controversy when it came out and said it wasn’t actually a female. It was like 2006 back when people didn’t identify their gender as Apache Helicopter and things were normal.

Which requires less effort? I have kinda bad memory so i might forgot to check on em :P

No one quite has the enthusiasm of Settled though. His videos are fun to watch because he's have a lot of fun making them.

All of those perks, even if you only got 1, are really really overpowered

Um, no, they arent. Shamans have 150 hp and mechanics you gotta avoid. Fire giants are 111 hp and no mechanics at all. Just how fucking retarded are you? When you're this ignorant, you dont talk. Alch yourself.

Its not fielxed 70 30. Its on a per streamer basis. You're obviously just assuming things you know nothing about. Stop.

The degree is mechanical engineering and then he worked as an engineer. Just different things. 
---
It sucks but imo all mining sucks so I just use the fastest methods so it's over asap
---
Wouldn't call it QoL, but supporting anyway. It should be a hard diary reward if you ask me. Their other drops are 90% shit, they're far from a bank and slow to kill. Noted bars drop wouldn't hurt.

I couldn’t help but dance emote with a smile on my face.  Great work!
---
Yes, she followed them from her dying world as the sole survivor after killing all life in a lust for power. 
---
But both Aslan and her are older than Narnia, so I'm not sure the magic in question is from Narnia or older and from a different world, or the world between worlds.
---
What sort of alternate bank sources do UIM use? I always seem them with a full inventory of pots and stuff. Like where are their actual items?
---
About 3 inventories (can be upgraded but the amount you store doesn't really change the pace) and I just start unloading the bag when it's full.
---
Its shit to see this game slowly turning to making life easier and easier for iron men. All the supply drops, every boss released now drops a stupid amount of skilling supplies, instances for iron men... iron men knew when creating their accounts that this game is competitive and that this game has assholes. If you’re not prepared to accept that like the rest of us then you’re playing the wrong kind of account. 
---
I wasn't sure what else to call it. I'd be perfectly okay putting it as a hard diary reward. 
---
I will eventually. I just hate that damn skill along with rcing. Even construction sucks but at least it's quick to level. I have had 50 banked for a month now lol.

Were stuck in a loop

You're too scared to 1v1 me, it's okay I understand.

I agree with the sentiment in this thread that these are absolutely no QoL changes and will vote no to all questions.

Mining heads, I have 74 mining and I’m interested in getting 99. What’s the fastest way to do it and how long would it take? Also, is it worth doing at the Motherlode Mine for the ore I’d end up with?

So after the new Updates yesterday we started trying out the new rooms. So this raid is a first room scouted thieving room which was the perfect chance to see how much points grubs give.
---
After depositing 1 grub, we noticed we got 100 points from the grubs( 5x increase from 20)
---
Well since it’s thieving and we’re doing 4 man, someone goes back to scav as the other 3 do the room
---
As we finish up the room I notice my points, 2150.... somehow I got 50 points from a grub? Not sure if it was like the last grub or something but there was for sure a glitch in the point system here 
---
Yep check my post history for my stats. 100% mobile. 
---
more like 2
---
I'm not trolling you, I'm dead serious. Maybe you're just scared to lose your 500k in gear to someone. I get that it looks like a lot of money so if you do lose I'll give your stuff back.
---
&gt; Think of the reverse. If PVP content was locked behind skilling. Like if overloads were allowed in the wildy and all of a sudden everyone who wanted to PVP seriously had to get 96 herblore. Or they placed level 99 agility shortcut everywhere. Or if blood runes you made yourself did extra damage.
---
Pvp is locked behind skilling/questing etc to some extent to get things like barrows gloves/fire cape/torso etc/construction for pool/obelisk etc, but that's fine it's part of the game.. just like wilderness content is. Again you seem to be thinking that every player is either a pker a pvmer or a skiller, there's a hell of a lot of overlap.
---
&gt;The wilderness is the best place in the game to train prayer, to use the abyss to train RCing, to hunt black chins, it has a bunch of clue locations, 8 unique bosses, 7 of which drop pets, Mage area 1&amp; 2, dark crabs, etc, etc.
---
There are lots of reasons to go to the wilderness that you can't get anywhere else.
---
And none of those are so much better than non wilderness alternatives that you're FORCED to do them, prayer probably comes close but then I personally didn't vote for that one, mage arena 1 and 2 are basically the only mandatory things that you have to get, and they take an hour tops, you probably spent longer than that raging at the explosives part on mm2 but for some reason just because the content is in the wilderness it's suddenly a bad experience?
---
&gt;Then I'm requesting a 99 agility requirement to enter the wilderness. As a skiller, I have no problem with that, and as a PKer, I'm sure you wouldn't have an issue with that, since you're "not bad", and that's all that matters.
---
Comparing fun wilderness content to maxing out the most mind numbing skill in the game doesn't seem like a fair comparison really, the requirement for the wilderness is experience you can quickly pick up if you spend a bit of time time there, 99 agility is just a worthless grind.
---
Again the bottom line comes down to, you seem to think everyone is either a skiller, pvmer or pker which isn't true.
---
I'm dead

As someone who used to be on a Top 50 raid team (in MoP), I'd be searching just as much "WoW &lt;item/quest/dungeon/skills" just as often as I now search "OSRS &lt;quest/item/map&gt;"

Just wait for the big wave of "nerf gmaul and make the current gmaul a rare drop from the gargoyle slayerboss ~~to increase gp/h of the slayerboss~~ to fix pvp balance" thats coming for the next polls.

They only want the best for pures

You took a wrong turn at Gundyr, but your armor looks a lot like the Faraam set!
---
at this point they should change the name from runescape to slayerscape 
---
People will argue that +1 prayer bonus is "meta defining" and "not QOL", so they will vote NO even though it has no effect on their playstyle at all.
---
I don't have a pure, but it sucks that people won't even let them look fashionable.

Buffs and balancing have nothing to do with qol

It made me want to make a Kourend-only Ironman but I don't even have my main maxxed.
---
Wtf dude he litteraly tells you not to tell anyone. You are gonna drive him out of business.
---
&gt; I agree, so is the wilderness.
---
That's what the wilderness should be. And if you removed all the bosses, all the skilling methods, that's what it would be.
---
&gt; Pool and obelisk aren't convenience items at all lol, there's a reason everybody has those on every account, they're game changing for pking.
---
Or just leave their main logged in to use their house, so you don't have to bother leveling construction on your PVP alt to use them. Or just use someone else's.
---
I can't just use someone else's wildy boss pets :p
---
&gt; Something that some people want to do vs something that only autists want to do, not a fair comparison at all.
---
I'm sorry, which of those was supposed to be PVP again? :p
---
&gt; There's a lot of them, they just don't bother coming to reddit because it's full of uninformed opinions of people that barely play the game yet somehow have control over the content.
---
There's a lot of them, you just can't see them. Just like your girlfriend who goes to a different school, and is currently travelling abroad, and is DEFINITELY REAL. :p 
---
You can't just declare people real that no one can see or talk to lol. 
---
-------------------------------------------------------
---
Luckily, we live in a game where polls exist. Easy enough to poll the question: 
---
"Should all PVM and skilling activities in the wilderness be mirrored to also exist outside of the wilderness?"
---
Then, if people who "are enjoying pvp based pvm/skilling content we currently have in the wilderness", actually exist, they can continue doing so. And those who don't enjoy that, can go kill those bosses, and use those skilling methods outside of the wilderness.
---
None why do we need a new skill??
---
Just put a comment with Q or D
---
No to all
---
Just get max gear tbow/blowpipe and blow through the first waves
---
When you get to jad he literally heals himself so you can stay there indefinitely as long you don’t tag the healers 
---
If thats the case, it probably is a bug.
---
Sime items stall your walking animations, like books or easter rings used to do it too.
---
You would trade someone, click to run away, then open a book and your character appears inside the bank but your real position is outside the bank. When the person trades you, he runs out of the bank and you close the book, and you shoot out real fast and its game over for that guy.
---
Looks like a snake spine to me.

I can't believe people still think it gives mage bonus

So if they removed the "QOL" from the poll title, that would make it all better?
---
Who cares what they label it as. A poll is a poll.
---
"Wtf?? +1 prayer bonus! We can't have that! that is too meta defining!!"

"Ooh! what is this? +2 str buff to the serp helm??? Going to vote yes instantly! Great poll question!"

Every time my cannon disappears I nearly have a heart attack before remembering this exists.

Ahh, that's better.  Been a decent bit since Kemp's last ironman vid + he got banned, so without him around to say **11/12/13 HP**, I needed something to fill that void.

I have low magic, so those teleports are off the table, and I didnt know the ring of dueling was so cheap. Wow. Might consider that, thanks! Mining coal specifically because I like to, and this is just for my own personal fun, roll my resources into my other skills rather than selling them directly. Like, mining into smithing, etc. Im sure it will get old eventually, but for now I just kinda enjoy doing it that way.

I have the same bug, but irl

It would make more sense if ithe title was something like "when someone casts ice barrage on me" then they could have edited in pray mage above aslan's head.

Lmao thanks peanut gallery I’m sure that your vast experience as a professional psychologist has trained you very well to know when an internet stranger “needs help”. Don’t be condescending.
---
MLM is slow compared to iron. I can get 15k-20k an hour at MLM (simply because adding the AFK factor makes me less focused).
---
You can get up to 70k/hr if you focus a little bit while mining at the Mining guild (I've noticed the rocks respawns faster there, and you get an invisible mining boost as well).

There's a flying spagetti monster on there as well, must be praying for zamorak then...

Stamina potions would still have a use and may potentially have even more of a use! Agility could be tied to the skill as well, say you need a certain agility level to attempt a certain feat.
---
most likely 1 month of p2p with twitch prime.
---
Oh, I didn't see they had made that change.
---
To be fair, the vambraces only have like 25 less no votes, so that's not really relevant.
---
true, but runescape has a combat system very different than any other rpg, its more close with dnd than with video game rpgs, having another skill factor into combat would also mean rebalancing, as well as having to recalculate everyone's combat levels and shit, so by running around levelling stamina, you're increasing your combat level, very very bad for pures
---
Actually looking at your post history you’re definitely him. Sorry man, its not personal. A skill like time keeping is just not made for Oldschool. In another game it may be alright but it’s trash for OSRS
---
Only reason I came back to this game when mobile dropped was because I used to pk massively pre eoc. Seems like the game has pretty much turned into ironmanscape and pvm. IDK why, because back when I played it used to be pkscape :/
---
I could never understand how people could enjoy watching someone else play RS, so I checked out one of his videos and then ended up watching like 10 in a row lol

Don't tell me that.... Was also told that it's a good way to make money, and I just got my first bond...
---
People don't bank every runite ore they mine in the wilderness? I don't see why you assume that people would bank every mark. Either way, the amount of pkers and the amount of skillers will always be in balance; if there's too much PKers, the skillers won't come, which will result in less pkers - and the other way round. I guess you just don't like the idea of 'having to be in the wilderness' as a requirement for the cosmetic. That's fair, but other than that I don't see your point at all to be honest. If anything, this will give players an incentive to train at a semi dead (but awesome) agility course again. Again, if they don't like it, they can choose not to go.

Why not just put the resting areas back and call it a day?

Each power of two increases the storage size of the number by 1 binary bit. Storing in lower size integer = less memory used

And I don't know what the solution is for that because it doesn't really seem they have anyone pvp focused working on the designs or changes as seen with the errors when pvp changes are pushed out. 
---
Minnows= 3x the exp and 4x the amount of sharks caught. Its a no brainer.
---
Today I realized paper money is just noted coins.
---
Don’t lose hope. This exact thing happened to me and I recovered my account successfully by tweeting at Jagex support and going through the normal channels. For me, my account had been muted for advertising websites and perm banned for bottoming; both of which were obviously deviant from my historical RS behavior. Just write a good appeal and keep the faith, man
---
Yeah that's the ladder option I mentioned. Couldn't think of the name. Haven't done it in a long time on my pures. 
---
Changes like these shouldn't be polled at all though. They should just be added.
---
Rewording the poll to what it actually means, it says "Would you like to be frozen for longer and increase your chances of dying".
---
No sane person would vote yes to this. I don't even blame people for voting no, it's such a shitty fucking poll question.
---
It's not that they have to separate polls - they shouldn't poll these changes at all. It makes the game harder for players but it is needed. It should be added regardless.
---
damn must be that time of the month
---
Did you know that in the medieval times people slept in beds much smaller than themselves? 
---
You want to send items “back in time” in order to revert them to their unprocessed form. Terrible idea for countless reasons. Like i said, it may be good in another game but its shit for osrs
---
only straight men fuck traps
---
I get downvoted all the time for talking about pvp. It's just the way of this reddit. Some pvpers are on here but most are in discord channels or on sharkbrew. 
---
yeah, although you see at opening day mostly people getting to 1-2 hp and then try to dharok you away. They do this for 15min-3hours and then they log to regular worlds and don't return till next time it is opened.
---
Good point i wouldnt want it to affect combat levels either, which is which i originally went with the stamina idea or more like endurance really. Like the more you do certain strenuous tasks and abilities the more xp you will get etc.
---
Everyone be sure to like on YouTube too! This was soooo lit!
---
Very true let me just mute this MMO its not like I play a MMO to interact with other people. I also enjoy clearing the chat a little even if its only for myself, Its nice to actually see genuine convocations and begger rarther than GP Selling adverts/Dicing Games and Doubling Scammers. 
---
You should definitely do more covers! That was amazing! 
---
I mean you’re not wrong. Surprised to see so much positivity from this sub for once. 
---
Technically abyssal demons but they're probably a block. Those 3 are the big ones. 
---
And you seem to be doing it the fast-ish way too. 
---
Part of the problem with crabs is you have a bunch of limited or low level account then unfinished mains or shit accounts clogging it up. Then you have the people who hop around to intentionally crash because they think it's fun.  It comes down to an efficiency issue with crabs.  
---
Pvmers really be like that
---
Someone mentioned that it could make fire surge with tome of fire viable at zulrah.  Would lose the use of venge though so I'm not sure if it's worth it.
---
Found the other pedo. Get help.
---
To be honest I don’t even know what it is I’ve just heard it in videos about how to train strength for 10hp accounts lol
---
Nooo I changed the idea. 
---
Because then the game starts feeling more and more like rs3. Im sure thats why a lot of people arent satisfied with just adding resting spots. If its tied to something different like a new skill called stamina that everyone has access to then i feel like thats different!
---
That was fucking amazing.
---
Do you believe the mentally ill are people?
---
He has gotten over 10m range alone from ranging shamans without a cannon that is a fucking long time to spend killing one npc for a unique drop you daft cunt.
---
It's all about choosing the right shape of glasses for your face
---
Nettz
---
They did but I thought it had more to do with all the pvpers migrating to private servers. After they got rid of the wild and later did eoc private server populations went way up. 
---
Is there any way to get rid of the high alch notification on valuable items? Its 2 clicks too many, really!
---
I’m doing Cerb and Hydra 
---
I wouldn't even know they existed if not for Reddit. 
---
I'll say it once again:
---
"Ignoring and marginalizing a portion of your player-base inevitably makes them a minority. This creates a vicious loop, because poll booths don't favor minorities.
---
If you wish to completely kill pvp in osrs (much like in rs3) then keep on postponing pvp updates."
---
At this point if the pvp community has any chance of revival, polls need to be separated into categories.
---
To my knowledge. no other poll has ever failed by 30:70. Keeping the poll results public doesn't help at all either.
---
It's just blatantly obvious spite voting.
---
Am I the only one who can beat Jad easily if I get to him? I always have trouble with the waves prior to jad. Must be a practice thing.
---
Clearly scripted cardboard door, not the oakdoors im used to

I'm only 36ish agility, do you think I'll fail a bunch? Was honestly thinking about just thieving from guards until i get around 80k for 37 con
---
Stupidest post ever. UK players will have finished working hard all day and have had 5 hours to chill before this party. Not everyone lives in the US. 
---
Can’t wait for the party! 
---
You can disable account recovery? 
---
Keep fury until you get anguish at least, and then decide. You can use fury at demonic gorillas for example
---
Cause its staged
---
"oorrrr just dont get scammed" 
---
Thank god you saved us all.
---
It might be worthwhile to get the Ferocious gloves as according to GE tracker they're worth half as much as the torture (~8.5m) which is pretty cheap for the upgrade they give.  Though you do need dragon slayer 2 to make them
---
But yeah the torture is pretty affordable and the biggest upgrade so that would be a good way to go.  
---
Right click the high alch spell and you can set the alch value you want a warning at
---
if spellbook resize passed would you have voted yes?
---
There is snow around him so he’s already started the DLC
---
Pyramid scheme shit
---
Really it was just an effective way to get him to stop making shit music.
---
Yeah no shit. The problem is them still calling it Quality of Life updates. If you look back at other polls when they mentioned "Quality of life" it was rare that something was getting buffed, removing of requirements etc. 
---
Reminder: One spell book being stronger than another isn't an excuse for having spells inconsistently operate and be so unbalanced as the game develops. Same goes for one spell book being a "Dedicated combat spellbook".  That is awful logic.
---
Reminder: The ancient spells' freeze timers didn't initially ignore prayer, but it was added in because of the direction that the game was going. It was something that was added recently.
---
Reminder: The ancient spell book is equally as strong regardless of this change. It is a matter of consistency. 
---
Reminder: The modern spell book has more combat spells, including damaging spells, teleblock, and freezes, than the ancient spell book does.
---
So why does the combat spellbook have the best freezes then?
---
My buddy and I started playing once mobile was in beta. He's done all the quests and his highest stat is high 80's. Entirely possible. 
---
+1
---
Kinda shitty to blame it on Jagex. 
---
Besides that, if you've got a TBow to begin with you're probably going to be fine. Go cry on your massive pile of money. 
---
This is a really important one!
---
He better get ready for the long-ass grind this DLC has to offer
---
Well I’m not upgrading to any of those anytime soon as I don’t have the defense or HP levels lmaoooo. I got some training to do. 
---
Does it have all quests done? I was thinking of using nmz for easy boss practice.
---
For realllllll. ThIs is ridiculous if the chaos and vamps don’t pass I’m gonna be mad. 
---
I mean, I don’t think this mini game was meant to be a viable training method but moreso a way to get new cosmetics. Molch pearls and the Golden Tench are good enough for me, the exp gained during it is just a little extra.
---
I’m definitely okay with it being upgraded, but it doesn’t have to be. 
---
Not in the molch temple, no.
---
Because they dont want them to be
---
i dont want the chaps for the prayer bonus just the fashionscape.
---
i voted no to the blessed because i feel it should require a prayer of 20 instead of defence of 40 in order to wear
---
They tweaked the basic spell book over time to include more PvP friendly elements and are polling one right this moment. That doesn't change that the basic spell book was designed since inception for PvM. 
---
Definitely. That was the point where I decided I am gonna vote against every pvp update.
---
Because it should've always been 1 def? Because black d'hide has the exact same stats except -1 prayer and has the same requirements except for the defence requirement on the chaps and vambraces. Don't you think it makes more sense that they have the same requirements across the board for their respective pieces?
---
[Suggestion] Make it true QoL and allow it to be opened and equipped in ammo slot to give you a +10 str bonus.
---
That’s rough bro. Anything luck after?
---
Most likely staged but in some area it is required to have weak in-door doors for firefighter to go in.
---
VOTE NO TO ALL PVP UPDATES
---
Dude you’re stalking my account replying with paragraphs? You’re a fucking freak I’m blocking you 
---
It’s a pasta
---
Isn’t the gauntlet more of a boss than a mini game? If so, this makes sense. 
---
Ye nobody cares 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Except blessed isn't from 06 
---
This is clearly in G.E., account ruined
---
Nah, topez has it right.
---
Lemme go put on my serp helm, dragon hunter lance, ferocious gloves and some justiciar armour while we go pet farming! The game has changed for the better *many* times
---
Letting a pure have purple pants instead of black doesn't change shit
---
Why would the have the same requirements but different stats? Not saying 1 prayer makes the difference but they aren't the same item so the argument of the should have the same lvl requirement is invalid. Train defence if you want to wear an item that has a defence requirement.
---
Do you type osrs everyday? I just have my wiki already open.. I think like most of the players
---
Support. It’d also be nice if you could use tools and buckets on him to store them although I don’t know if this would be possible with the crop noting functionality

Then there needs to be some form of check and balance in the voting to protect different parts of the community.

This is when you should be using ring of wealth so it goes right into your inventory nub

Lol I doubled up my tree runs with wc and fm because why not. But now that those are at reasonable levels cutting trees is a huge pain.
---
Stop fucking posting this
---
I hope you voted no to almost every single question on every poll ever, otherwise you have no leg to stand on. Also, there are so many other things on the poll that make the game less "OSRS", for example the autocast options being remembered on staffs, which is passing by 91%. Somehow I think this is failing for a different reason.
---
Try Pepsi its a better cure for Polio
---
That angler one sucked, took me 15 hours to get the full outfit. But i like doing clues masters because it gives me a reason to level up besides diaries. Only one i can’t do yet is woodcutting and mining steps
---
I usually close my tabs when I'm done. Just a habit and then i type right into the address bar and google gives a drop down pretty fast of what I'm tryna type. I usually pick the wiki
---
I use steelseries arctis 7 wireless and find them to have great quality audio. Plus you can adjust the audio between game and chat with a dial on the side. Useful in clutch scenarios where you can mute discord to focus on in game sounds.
---
You're going to care if 10-15% of the community votes no to every poll that you want to pass. It will make a difference.

I've never heard of this guy but I really enjoyed that, in gonna check his actual content out.

---
MAKE SERP HELM GREAT AGAIN 
---
I think if they made it to where you had a slight defense buff if you're attacked but don't fight back that's about the only change they could do that wouldn't completely shit on the pvp community. Would basically make it so people getting rushed/clanned have about a 10% higher chance of escaping. Tbh I don't even agree with my own idea right now, the whole idea of the wilderness is the risk/reward. PvMers know the risk they're taking when they go out there, but the potential reward is what draws them in.
---
You're so fucking stupid. Blessed d'hide is just black d'hide with a "god trim". Why do the blessed d'hide bodies have "the same requirements but different stats"?
---
If you tell yourself that enough i wonder if you’ll actually start to believe it. Don’t worry though even if you manage to delude yourself i to believing it we’ll all know how serious you were!
---
Also, last I checked liking the shitty ideas of ole H0lidayExpress isn’t what defines a gamer. And thank goodness for that because if it was there wouldn’t be any gamers! Look at your previous posts, literally everyone hates your idea mate. They’re trash. You get roasted every single time you post them. 
---
Give it up or at least learn to take valid criticism rather than just telling people they can’t see it the way you do. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so while you may be able to see some great skill (because of your personal bias) all the rest of us see is a giant steaming pile of shit made to imitate a skill
---
Bruh put that shit in an investment account what the fuck is that doing in paypal
---
Look at the peak around BfA release and how it dropped down... Look at the steady OSRS :)
---
I am definitely for having some BH kills to be able to vote.
---
I don't see any PVP content / polls ever passing at this point in RS. 
---
I don't think anyone took the time to do that. I'd recommend watching the whole series since it's fantastic and there's only 7 episodes. 
---
4 left halfs in 7.5k shamans, 0 dwh.
---
Holy shit those are like 10M on the grand exchange. Nice!
---
You’re incredibly bitter and seem to be very jealous of him. It’s entertainment for those subscribers, nothing wrong with paying for entertainment. Who cares if producing it doesn’t cost as much effort as some other forms of entertainment?
---
Why 24m?
---
Cannon: Lighthouse dags, slayer cave kalphites in the southernmost room, baby black dragons in the tav slayer-only tunnel (KBD isn't the best xp but it's not bad - free slay xp from the babies is too good to pass up), stronghold trolls because I was too stupid/stingy to figure out ice trolls, Nieve cave bloodvelds, hellhounds in southern room, spectres, ankou, fire giants in the east room. Greaters in the center of the chasm are GOD-tier cannoning. That's all I can remember offhand lol.  Also keep autoretaliate off and pray/eat if you have to or can't safespot. RL has most of the cannon spots I used and approved some that I suggested but there are a few that I kept secret ;) PM me here or ingame if you need help with cannon placement.
---
As for bosses: I did all the Jad, wilderness bosses, Thermy and Cerb I could. Cerb isn't good xp but if you can afford the margin, that bitch will make you all the money you'll need. Kraken is good but not the best xp, likely block once you get pet - everyone does.  Skotizo when you get a black/greater task (shards from abby demons, not good xp but pretty much the only thing worth doing in cata for untrimmed slay), and do Gargbosses unless you find yourself dying a lot. Their xp is baaarely viable but if you can do a whole task without dying, you'll come out on top and profit. Do DS2 asap so you can get to Vork for blue tasks.
---
I also barraged dusties and nechs until ~95, that mage and hp xp is ridiculous.
---
lol I just think it's hilarious that they've all basically forgotten or don't know about rock crabs, which at this point are basically a ghost town full of free afk exp.
---
Gah that saddens me so much you have no idea
---
Nechs are demons, arclight works vs them. Bloodvelds are not demons
---
Sounds like you have a rat in your pc. You've clearly downloaded something sketchy or clicked some link that did this 
---
Did you kill a skeleton by accident?
---
It was designed AT inception for PvM and its obvious Jagex with their new tweaks want it to be viable PvP option
---
It's an extra 10% not an extra 20%.
---
Jagex already killed pvp 2 times and now is going for the 3rd time lmfao
---
What even happened to the bone whip
---
That or if you have a defence/main/alt there then complete your shit and go to ammonite crabs, nmz, or elsewhere. 
---
The point is that a short (0 to 255) uses 1/4 the space to save as an integer (0 to 2147m). Granted it does seem odd to have such a low cap in this example.
---
Time for christopher archibald to conduct an election to form a  council of players that will decide upon PvP updates
---
Did any of your examples involve changing the stat requirements for items that have been in the game since 2006? This isn't rocket science. If you want new purple pants for pures, add a new item.
---
Points per time, obviously. I said that in previous replies.
---
Guy could definitely play on a private server to get practice, lol
---
Not to mention getting drops makes it far more bearable 
---
Can you give me any other example in the history of OSRS where an item pre-dating OSRS had its stat requirements changed?
---
OP af hell no
---
My idea is better than yours!
---
The same could be done for bossing polls have a required KC of so many to be able to vote on it I like this idea 
---
I don't understand it either, seems like a huge waste of time
---
TIL December 5, 2006 was not part of 2006
---
This has to be fake hahaha
---
If yes props to the production team !
---
Ah good point, I guess only 3 runes are needed for ice barrage vs 7 for Surge, Entangle, and Teleblock.
---
Still though, I'm not sure this is unbalanced. You sacrifice 4 inventory spots and longer freeze times in order to ensure your target is unable to teleport while getting substantially higher DPS via Fire Surge.
---
So in other words, you wanted the defence requirement of the blessed chaps to be removed, but you voted for it not to be removed. Smart move there, fella.
---
Fvck
---
Nice but now the barrows boots grind begins!
---
Better have FAP ring and Havels ring or else I will hurt someone 
---
Ah my bad dude didn’t realize youre 8 years old. 
---
Reminder barrage is unaffected by protection from magic and even if you pray flick perfectly you can still get stacked out by a 20 second freeze. 
---
#VoteToHalveIceBarrageTime
---
Doing a ground click when the freeze phase starts is part of killing Vorkath right now. It doesn't really matter to me either way, but I guess some people see this as making a really good money maker slightly easier, so they're against it.
---
Not always. It's just a +1 str bonus
---
As an exercise in healthy debate, I'm curious why you think this is the case. 
---
Why should those kind thing be implemented just because a small vocal minority of the player base doesn't agree with how the plebian majority vote?
---
Regardless of if I do boss stuff or pvp or do high end activities, I can have an opinion and vote on it accordingly. 
---
Isn’t every cereal ONE OF the highest protein cereals?
---
If it has no impact whatsoever then why does the change need to be made in the first place? You're the one arguing for changing original Oldschool Runescape item requirements, I'm just pointing out how ridiculous that is and that it's never happened before. 
---
For real, nobody is forcing you to do anything in this game, you choose how you want to play.
---
All other d hide chaps are 1 def. the developer of blessed chaps probably just forgot when he introduced them to the game 13 years ago and its stayed since. Even royal chaps/vambs when added in 2012 had a 1 def req. 
---
make the herb sack be able to store up to 100 herbs so I can do my herb runs in peace
---
All depends on your stats. Here's a list with practically every skill or combat you can imagine. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide#Hourly_profit_table
---
Right so 30m for a +1 str and +2 acc for prims is probably not worth it as well. I know we are not considering defense here but I’m sure the defense upgrade in Bandos is also worth it to an extent. 
---
If you think that pvpers are close to the only people who voted against spell resizing, you're seriously misunderstanding the issues people held with that update.
---
You probably shouldn't have voted on the update at all if you were honestly that clueless.
---
Fighting your own alts to farm easy wins for points

You can’t see them walk away. They animation stall and run into a dangerous area while they’re still shown in the bank

---
You’re correct, we’re a minority community without voices
---
I feel ya, been sick at home for 3 years. Cant really go to school or do fun things with friends. Life can be harsh sometimes, but the high points make up for it. Good to hear things are going better for you!
---
Yeah it's not really a big thing how it is currently, just surprised since it's such a small change actually is more QoL than most of the other things on the list that get massive approval
---
Cause listening to someone say "bois", "let's go", or "chat" 10x an hour makes me question my entire existence on this planet lol.
---
Also, streaming takes little to no effort. A video takes thought, preparation, perfection, etc. A stream just simply is. The medium just doesn't translate to entertainment for me. :P
---
That is because Runite is mined for Profit. If you bank every ore, it hurts your profit. But the Elite Marks aren't gathered for Profit; they are gathered to unlock something account bound. The Wilderness Agility Course is a Level 50 Skilling method; we shouldn't make that worse just so higher levels can force in a recolor.
---
And to touch on the having to be in the Wilderness part, I think the Wilderness should only offer higher profit for the risk. If you offer other perks like unique items or higher exp, then it starts to cause problems. You shouldn't have to go into a PvP Zone for the best Hunter exp if you don't like PvP; it should be the same exp as Red Chins but for more profit so the choice is "do you want to spend the same time training but make more money at risk of PKers" instead of "do you want to train quicker with more profit at risk of PKers".
---
yep it changes nothing but 1 prayer bonus, which is basically nothing.
---
I'm interested to see the amount of voting players who actually know the difference between black d'hide and blessed d'hide. Because if you look at those questions without any background knowledge, it seems weird to suddenly remove wielding reqs on certain items that have been in the game for years.
---
Also this has to be one of the worst poll results I've ever seen. It's sad to see the only pvp updates nowadays are unpolled "integrity" changes since they won't ever pass a poll.
---
Any pvp poll that doesnt benefit pvm in some way is always gunna fail the poll. 
---
ancient freeze timers aren't affected by mage pray!? 
---
hp above head is vanilla fella :)
---
Just the higher the better, really.  If you plan on counter-pking then I'd train up either range or mage particularly high (or both). If you're planning on doing a lot of wildy slayer you'll want to clear your block list out and block ents, lava dragons, and a few other of the slower/awful things to kill.  
---
You were just waiting for the 73 cooked
---
Standard spell book already has tb and a fire wave spell that hits 45s it doesn’t need a buff. being frozen for half a minute would be crazy. 
---
TRUE
---
Tbh I wanted the coif to pass because then pures would risk more than 15k a fight.
---
Very disappointed in the toxicity of the PvMers in this community voting everything for PvM at 80%+ passing but voting everything that potentially does with PvP into the ground. If you don't like PvP then don't fucking PvP, that's no reason to fuck it up for everyone else.
---
Well yeah that’s what caused a lot of players to leave but it isn’t the sole reason
---
&gt;Well, colour me surprised. I assumed all black d'hide had the def requirements,
---
and this is the main reason polls don't work. People don't even know what the questions are about.
---
Magic isn't the most accurate form of attack on someone in black dhide, which makes up the majority of ppl pking / in deep wild. 
---
as fascinating as the strategies/content actually is, i think it's the personality that really stands out to me. he's just a really likeable guy, great video-making voice etc. it's partly why i can't get into the karamja ironman, the dude just sounds uninspired about the whole thing
---
idk why u think every1 is skilled enough with fire surge and theyll take a tome of fire and 6 inv spaces of runes instead of a 1 space inv of runes for a 20 sec freeze spell
---
Woox is undeniably the best pvmer in the game
---
All you pvmers only risk spades in the wilderness anyway, why not let us have an extra 7.5 second freeze? It makes a big difference in pvp whether you think so or not. It's not "terrible for strictly PvM only players" if you honestly think that you're beyond help.
---
Jagex should just unlock all quests, there's no reason for requirements. - QOL /s
---
Look at that Chad Chin 
---
This is great info, thanks. = )
---
I don't even pk that much but idiots like you inspire me to pk more.
---
The universe did when it allowed these brainlets to exist in the first place
---
Well, I came here to discuss before I voted. Under my original assumptions, you're right, I would have voted no without all the info. I'll vote yes though, since this obviously makes no sense. I still think Jagex needs to reword this question to remind people, though. 
---
Only for scrubs. Real hardcore old school RuneScape OG players train their defense so high in the training island that they never get hit!
---
Yooo good tip tysm
---
&gt;smithing
---
&gt;Making money
---
Pick one sweety
---
black dhide vambs and chaps require no defence level, so its logical the blessed versions shouldnt require defence
---
unfortunately this is would be an update that would mostly benefit pkers, so i was obligated to vote no
---
not sure whats up with the mass no voting to the vorkath question, but oh well
---
you got me there tbh
---
It is basically small updates that can be done in a week or so, with a different theme each week.
---
Except entangle doesn't deal damage
---
Rune 2h/platelegs
---
Let's see him beat 6 jada first off then.  
---
ahahaha
---
It's called a tool leprechaun 
---
Stop repeating yourself, stupid ass. I've already told you to talk to me when there's more than 3 qol updates in this so called qol month.
---
Hey, there you are again bitching. "Make the game easier for ME!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Realistically though you are bridding someone with d'hide so you hit less often and not near that high.  I'm not gunna have all the gear on me to max a 45 in deeper wild. 
---
Yeah but this isn’t really an efficiency thing, the armor is straight up immune to ranged
---
Your cat is better at zulrah than me rip
---
Soul bearer sends your ensouled heads straight to bank iirc
---
So not necessarily QoL, just little bits that people want
---
15 seconds isn't close to half a minute and any skilled pker that is able to bring enough runes for tb, entangle, and fire surge deserves to get the kill anyways with the normal 15 second freeze timer. Its insane to think normal spellbook needed a reduction in freeze
---
Scorpia
---
Hahaha what.
---
You can teleblock or you can freeze, you don't get both.
---
If you gave this buff to standard SB then what is the point of using ancients in 1v1's? Fire Surge already best damage in game
---
Anyone got pics on the old lesser / greater demons? 
---
You make a new account
---
the buttler that brings nee oak plank: am i a joke to you?
---
I have a pure but don’t really pvp.  I voted yes to this stuff purely for fashion scape.  It’s a shame it won’t pass, most serious pkers won’t change their setup for a pray bonus and a massive increase in risk anyway, all this would do is add some variety and value to hard clues.
---
Except entangle doesn't deal damage, the fire spell requires you to also have an expensive offhand that doesn't offer defensive bonuses, and adding in teleblock means you have dedicated a ton of slots to runes. 
---
I'm talking about lack of pvp updates.
---
Pking with normals is ridiculously under powered and awkward even with that extra max hit. 
---
I honestly didn't know there were metal dragons anywhere else. TIL
---
Doesn't it have a pray req aswell?
---
Grey areas represent 
---
But in just enough time to make boomer memes. Blessed.
---
Reading these comments gave me cancer
---
I disagree that a good stream takes little to no effort. The key phrases you listed might not be as simple as that,but I agree that streamers have their personalities and they are fairly predictable.
---
I’m usually not really into watching ironman series, but swampletics is enjoyable af to watch 
---
I do the same and it happens at least once a trip.

I know exactly what you’re talking about and if you click off vork before you get an attack off you won’t have that delay when you turn to the spawn. Like everyone else replying I’ve never been hit by it either due to that delay and I use dhcb a lot.
---
Yeah I’m pretty depressed, this games the reason I live
---
100% agree with this
---
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!!
---
bruh smh... oof that’s a yikers.. brb gotta go charge my juul
---
i had the same problem with digimon world prosperity
---
Ok so its the other way around. I thought they already ignored protect from magic. They way I see it the change should be ice spells as its the odd one out as regular binds and TB are already halved.
---
Toxic pvmers as usual 
---
There's a lot of additional information on screen which can be helpful or borderline play the game for you in a lot of instances. They make the game much easier, so if that interests you then get a third party client. 
---
boy mm2 is fkin worth it. loved the quest and the feeling when you beat glough is amazing. even more after getting your first zenyte 
---
I don't vote no to spite pvpers. I vote no because I don't believe you should have access to the highest damaging spell (fire surge.) TeleBlocks, AND now a guranteed 15 second freeze on one spellbook. 
---
Anything to do with defence levels are almost always motivated by the PvP community, because just about anyone who isnt a pure would rather train defence anyway.
---
I wish haha I’m 178 
---
Wait how do you do this?
---
Clearly you did, else why would you be advertising your body on stream?
---
It’s against the twitch rules, AND it’s against this subreddit’s rules. You’re a dumb thot. A cancer that needs to be expunged from the communities.
---
this is a skill issue
---
I could only manage 1 jad kill in an hour of learning this from scratch. I however am not doing it with sound on, Any tips on sound cues, whenever I tried with sound I wouldn't even make it passed 2 rotations.
---
monk robe body requires no prayer level to wear unless you are an ironman and also gives +6 for the body.
---
Low population worlds are good for that.
---
I mean... I do that.
---
Stamina only adds to the agility skill. Yes you can teleport from point A to point be rather quickly at high levels and when youve done the right quests to unlock those teleports but this could even come into play when doing something that requires the use of a stamina pot currently like solo raids where youre constantly running. Or even raids in general where half way through the raid you could be completely out of run energy until you get to the well at the end of a floor where you can restore all of your energy. 
---
You must only be there for the other half
---
It displays even during movement it's a constant outline.
---
Can you link some?
---
That’s basically the extent of it. 3rd party clients have a bunch of built in tools that can keep track of things for you automatically. They aren’t bots, they don’t play for you, but they can tell you when your farm runs are done, or how many more kills/actions before a level. The two main ones people have used are OSBuddy and Runelite. OSBuddy had some issues come to light with the security of the client so lots of people moved over to Runelite in the past year or so. Runelite is now the most popular one for casual play. I know of some more specialized for PKing and what not but if you’re interested Runelite is free and trusted by the community. 
---
As for the cheating side of it. Jagex has 3rd party clients in a grey zone. They don’t consider it cheating, but because they don’t control them they say you use them at your own risk. If you download a plugin that does cheat or if an update happens that would cheat and you are using it then you could be banned. Runelite seems really good about this though with quite a few updates being changed so as not to push that line. Of course you still use at your own risk but at this point if jagex banned everyone using a 3rd party client they would lose 10’s of 1000’s of players over night. 
---
Runelite is the best one in my opinion. Simple, unobtrusive, and lots of plugins that add QoL changes. 
---
They're an item that you can only get after doing the entirety of the Recipe for Disaster (RFD) quest. You buy them from the Culinaromancer's chest after completing the final battle.
---
They are called Barrows Gloves, so OP was making a joke showing them inside of a Barrow's chest.
---
It was hard to read the last line 
---
If you don't even pvp then why are you even posting about jagex killing pvp? You have no basis to make any points because you admitted you have no experience.  This is something rs3 does good! Targeted polls to the communitys that have authority on these descions .
---
I 5
---
Weird flex but ok. Pked since 2005 but if that's not "OG" enough to have an opinion I'm sorry! Also nice response, It's much easier to immediately get defensive instead of making good, well thought-out counterpoints :^)
---
Runelite
---
Lol someone didn’t get their way
---
Let's just say, don't take this post too seriously
---
:') Ur so cute
---
Just splash 
---
Stop killing me when I’m clue hunting then :)
---
[yes they do](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zamorak_platebody)
---
I mean the polling system here is pretty clear, at least 75% yes votes makes the question pass, and Skip Question votes are not counted as either Yes or No. Nothing to misunderstand about that. I'm not affecting the outcome either way.
---
I do clues for the 14k loot caskets, if I want to make money I could just go to raids or hydra or zulrah or literally anything more consistent than clue scrolls.
---
No lol. I just said I don’t watch him because of it. You think i keep track of them when I don’t watch him anymore? 
---
I haven’t voted yet, but I will vote no on that one for your reason, and also because I assume they’d somehow fuck it up and we’d lose a tick of attacking
---
How did you get 99 range on mobile?
---
Go to an unrestricted world, they’re tinted blue in the world selector and if you hover over one it says “unrestricted world.” W443 is a US one. There’s a yellow portal close to the clan portals that says “Jad Runefest” or something, simply click that and you’ll go into an instance. You can also gear up and grab supplies in the chest where you spawn in 
---
Click the button that says try again
---
There are a few problems
---
Things like lavas and muds require extremely quick banking and fast/accurate clicks in general.  If your clicks are shit, you get closer to 30-35k xp/hr, so for a lot of players 70k simply isn't happening.
---
The second issue is that when you're training rc, you're only training rc. That guy getting 15k slayer xp/hr at bloodvelds is also getting 20k hp xp/hr and 60k strength xp/hr, for a total of 95k xp/hr.
---
See the problem is we can't get everyone on the same boat. Right now the PvMers are the majority of the playerbase, which is fine, until PvP related polls come up. The people who actually know what they're voting for are getting ignored because the majority of the player base sees something that could make a part of the game they don't enjoy more difficult for them and are voting no on them before thinking about the people who actually care for those updates and how much it will improve the quality of their gameplay experience. The common conception is "pkers bad" and that's hurting the game.
---
You need max gear for fight caves? Brah
---
Leaving the motion on gives a better chance at a drop. 
---
why does pvm need change? Why does anything need a change? legit i dont understand anything you just said, legit makes no sense, are you saying that there shouldnt be wilderness or bh/pvp worlds? Why u just dont go rs3, its only pvm/skilling? and with better graphics??
---
Maybe if those people did one of the hundreds of pvm opportunities outside of the wild or dropped their clues with risky wilderness steps if they don't want to risk dying, they wouldn't die in the wild.
---
It's a shame the fact that pvmers/skillers wanting everything given to them for free means that pvpers get their polls spite voted. 
---
but its bannable now and some people do get banned for it so im too scared to use it
---
Not gonna lie, the quest where you get to meet Zaros and decide if you want to help him or not was the most memorable quest in rs3 for me. Made me feel like the choices mattered in a way.
---
Can't believe my dumbass didn't think of this i went to buy the fletching cape in catherby haha
---
I’m confused as to why ancient freezes aren’t.
---
yes you're absolutely right there's not a single PvMer or raider out there who could do switches as clean as you. Do you want me to kneel when I speak to you?
---
No they don't only the chest does. That's why the chest obviously isn't being polled. Coif too which is why it was removed
---
Literally no reason to not allow us to change the colour of our d'hide chaps &amp; vambraces other than to be a dick
---
and I accidentaly dropped full graceful instead of wearing it because I forgot I had that red inventory feature on.... not playing at work break again
---
You sound pissed
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/R7Sza2u
---
But black d'hide has a def req and they're the same stats minus prayer, why wouldn't the blessed version then require 40 def?
---
We can call them “dollars”
---
If you were to bring all those spells into the wilderness it would take up 9 slots, or you would have to risk 1.5m to save a couple extra slots. That's not a well-thought out argument. by the time you factor in switches and pots you would have room for a small amount of food, which ups the risk substantially. 
---
This is why non pkers need to sit this one out. Y’all are just plain ignorant.
---
Try pking with normal spellbook and let me know how it goes.  
---
It’s called Runescape for a reason
---
“Run escape” but can’t hide.
---
I recommend trying out farming seaweed patches if you're low on hespori seeds, they seem to have a fairly high chance of giving them (which would make sense since they also have the highest pet chance)
---
What about something like solo raids where you have to bring at least two stamina pots into a raid to be able to complete it as quick and efficiently as possible? Resting areas is only a simple fix for lower levels. The stamina skill could provide a boost to run energy maybe even faster restore and ignoring the weight your character is carrying etc. Another practical use is something like runecrafting where youre constantly banking and running back to an altar. 
---
Why are you so mad LMAO
---
Not everyone nh pks, there's a ton of us that honor pk and are just wanting improvements to actually happen.
---
check out the cc OSRS SOA
---
people use it for both quests
---
Reminder: the spells you are talking about in the normal spellbook are dedicated to combat just because the normal spell book has utility doesn’t mean it can’t have combat dedication.. please understand what you’re talking about before being a sassy moron just because you disagree with pking
---
What's it like being Jesus Christ?
---
Oh the horror, two viable spellbooks for tribrid, how will the pvm,ers ever live with this.
---
The problem wasn't on actually implementing it, it was whether or not it would be ok to not allow people to vote on things they don't directly interact with.
---
If I know how it affects my own gaming experience I vote accordingly to what I'd like to see.
---
If it doesn't harm me whatsoever, I either vote yes or don't vote at all.
---
Better get your boys in line then 
---
I know what you're talking about, I have played WoW for almost a decade. Every expansions it lost a little, and the last one I didn't even play for the first time.
---
I really hope vanilla delivers back that rugged gameplay feel I miss so much.
---
Get 99 mage and use your spellbook swaps lately. Pray mage will forever half entangle, as it should be. :)
---
Wouldn't that make you the snowflake since you want everything to be based around you?
---
It’s just an image and I set it as my desktop background and then I make the client smaller to match the size! I got it off google 
---
At its core, it is still a question about game balance. They aren't polling any new content, they're polling a tweak to existing content. It's a balance change.
---
Do a test run, maybe just change it on the BH world for a little bit. Don't leave it up entirely to the players who have it in their best interest to vote against it.
---
You're missing the point, were not voting no because we just spite you. We are voting no because this negatively effects pvmers directly. There is pvm content in the wilderness (which their shouldn't be) if I didn't want to go to the wildy to do pvm I'd let you have anything u guys wanted. But this does effect me directly. You voting no to just spite us doesn't make sense because no pvm update effects pvp directly. The real solution here is stop putting pvm content in the wildy. 
---
Its a meme, stop crying and continue collecting spades nerd
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/a=7/oldschool/results.ws?id=1335
---
&gt; If a poll question only affects the gameplay of certain players, should we only allow those affected players to vote on it? In order for an update to be polled to a specific part of the player base, it would need to truly be exclusively a change to only that community. If it provides an advantage over other players or a change which impacts the wider game, it would still require approval from the entire community.
---
Failed. 
---
The bigger problem is how do you set the limits on who is allowed to vote for what?
---
How do you fairly determine what questions affect which people?  You can't, it's impossible. 
---
Everything effects everyone in some small way, and any limits are going to be entirely arbitrarily. 
---
I didn't say anything about removing Wilderness or pvp worlds legit. Legit I tell you.  
---
HELL NO. I just wanted to do Max gear so I would get to Jad quicker LMAO.
---
Wouldn't voting no to any addition/change be the opposite of turning osrs into rs3?
---
you seem like the kind of guy with a max stack of plat tokens
---
You should get your eyes checked. [Here they are overlayed over one another.](https://imgur.com/RroC0Q9) 
---
Hey guys! I found Guthix!
---
I don’t see the issue with this tbh. If I live in the UK and you live in the USA, why should I direly need to vote in your country? 
---
&gt;  I don't think Jagex should be catering primarily to niche accounts
---
they literally add itemspawns because snowflake regionlocked ironman ask for that on twitter.
---
That's the problem with PvP polls though, compared to something like Raids polls or polls about Hydra, EVERYONE participates in PvP if they go to Wildy, not just PvPers, so unlike other polls, there's no logical way to separate voters without bias being introduced.
---
Maybe click on it
---
By the way, your ass may appear to be made of bone, but it’s supposed to be made of muscle.
---
I can understand your misunderstanding.
---
The number of nh pkers is actually relatively small compared to pkers as a collective, problem being people who don't pk don't know how to react when they get pounced on while they're clue hunting. If you guys just kept the log out screen up while you're running in the wild to your clue you can log out and world hop before anybody gets on your the second you see a white dot.
---
that question still 57% yes, its more than double of this poll
---
Oh shit i didn't know tourney worlds are back! And with that website I'm on 30 something kc. But wearing full void with trident of swamp and normal recoils. 
---
you’re hired!
---
I just finished this grind for barrows/ds2 yesterday.
---
Have you done MM2? MM2 tunnels alone make it worth it IMO, but it also unlocks heavy balista and tree pod 
---
Quite a grind for the reqs though
---
What they are like 500k chaps. They are not wearing them for pking. And if they are, more loot for whoever kills them. And my argument was that its really not that big of a buff. Hence it should have passed.
---
Can only use bronze daggers. 
---
So be intentionally vague? 
---
Hey u got this man keep going! And keep me updated I’d like to see your progress 
---
Well clearly you're a lost cause so just keep in mind, pvpers post something like this every time one of your polls fail and your updates keep failing while ours keep passing without issue ever. If you want your polls to pass make them mutually beneficial to all players not just you. Give suggestions to make us want to vote yes, not just "we need longer freezes so we can kill pvmers" you're not going to have any luck with that. Best of luck man.
---
How do I avoid this? 2FA on email and account? Plus recovery questions that are random and not related to my real life info? 
---
I want to see the look on your face when they alch their stuff before they die
---
herbalore 
---
Dont mess with autism lmao
---
herbalor
---
Velds aren't demons, just weird booty monsters
---
It's disabled for the bigger streamers but no we don't have the same option. 
---
The pvp community isn't solely responsible for that poll failing, and even Ash said they might repoll that one to make it pvm exclusive as to not "devalue the skill of pkers".
---
I voted yes for that one because it seemed handy for casual use like alching and tele'ing, idgaf about the skill some people picked up with their muscle memory, if they're that skilled they would be able to retrain themselves to be more efficient so what's the problem there? lol
---
Honestly one of the main problems with polling is definitely the results being shown. Makes it so that once one choice is ahead people who don't know which choice to pick will just go with the leading choice, as well as makes it so people who want to pick the losing choice feel like their vote doesn't matter.
---
Your title is a bit misleading, its +2 strength.
---
That’s what I was thinking about doing, I do have 43 prayer. Do you think it will be too hard for me though? As in me dying a lot and losing my items?
---
Ya, that’s what news tends to do lately lol. Misleading titles and lack of clarity to get you interested for the wrong reasons.
---
I don’t blame you. Clickbait is the culture we live in lol
---
You could do fight caves for a fire cape, definitely do that. Raids are far beyond your stats. 
---
Once you can do barrows reliably look to some actual bosses like kril/graador with a small team.
---
I'd say most raids groups are gonna want 85+ in combat stats and at a minimum like 20-30m in gear
---
Most pvmers are too stupid for this. 
---
Oof I made a typo
---
GINGER INTEGER
---
Welcome to life buddy
---
Uhhh I'm gunna pass on that one 
---
Slayer until 84, then nmz with blowpipe. Probably spent 20m on scales alone. More expensive than I anticipated but worth it. 
---
&gt;Changes like these shouldn't be polled at all though. They should just be added.
---
Wow.  TIL Vixa knows what’s best for the game and his suggestions should be pushed through without community approval.
---
Nobody wants a high tier boss to become easier for everyone, so of course easyscape polls usually get shut down.
---
Because the current BIS is a quest item thats costs nothing?
---
You don’t lose items in fight cave. 
---
name was probably changed
---
Ohhh lmao. Preciate you explaining 
---
&gt;sit retard
---
Love this community
---
I really don’t know. It’s all of reddit. Sometimes it’s more convenient, like if you sent it to a friend first.
---
What ui update?
---
this seems like the rational thing to do? you don’t have interest/knowledge, so you select to skip said questions. commended. 
---
Apparently the pvm brainlets don't want more money on clue scrolls since they are so adamant about doing them. 
---
If you weren't in the wrong why bother hiding your username?
---
Just because you have not killed a boss or used a certain piece of content, doesn't mean you wont ever kill that boss or use the piece of content.
---
Why stop someone from voting in something that they may use just because they haven't yet?
---
Why does the meta have to be 2v1? Sounds shite to me. 
---
Devalues my frustration only UIM
---
Ok, here's a deal. I won't whine about PKers killing defenceless people in the wildy if PKers stop whining about the people they kill not wanting to make it easier for PKers to kill them by voting against PvP updates.
---
PKing clue hunters and the like for literally no drops just builds animosity towards the PKing community. And building hatred from the majority is usually not a good thing for a minority to do when the game is run democratically.
---
ty
---
Skilling:  
---
Add Rocky chance to chests, its dead content atm  
---
Add Amethyst to the Expert mining gloves perk
---
Lol I was debating on geting 75 atk for that shield 
---
just train defence? it's only 40 levels lmao like do you even play this game
---
I do agree. QoL should be about fixing unnecessary burdens and annoyances. This seems to just be miscellaneous month now. 
---
But, as it’s here. I don’t see why it’s bad. Literally no body loses from this. No one is going to die in the wild to someone wearing blessed chaps over black. 
---
I still don't understand it
---
Yeah I agree that example is very weird. It’s not even as though he could not train hunter, it just gave him a better training method. 
---
SUPPORT
---
If you can't make use of a 5, 7, or 10 second stun thats your problem.
---
Because the odds are that you don’t know how the mechanics work at a deep level. And only know little from watching content creators simulate the mechanics.
---
Would be fairly op for uim
---
They're literally all like within 5-10 spaces of the patch
---
Sounds good! Will check it out
---
At the very beginning of rs2 the game (and the wild) was mostly populated by terrible mains and the odd rare pure or range/mage based character, obviously the flat 70 mains got absolutely destroyed by all 3 of these and complained a storm leading to hatchet job nerfs, firstly on the magic shortbow special (from 50 to 55% so you couldn't double spec) and secondly on spells such as entangle
---
How is an NPC holding items even close to an invisible inventory for all Skilling related items?
---
Young grasshopper. When one leaves front door open, people steal your shit and lock you out. 
---
Said it before and ill say it again, if jagex get rid of the predator vs prey idea in the wildy then it will resolve this issue
---
r/damnsublinkers
---
To her chin
---
&gt; PvP gets far more updates than 80% of the dead content skilling stuff.
---
What was the last actual pvp update not counting dmm? LMS?
---
A lot of us also have mains that do both. 
---
I really want the original clip 
---
2008 called. They want their gear back.
---
I mean pkers do not make up a significant enough of the playerbase to effect polls to pass or fail. 
---
That's like a 80mil door bro.
---
It's a vocal subgroup of a subgroup of players' fault for thinking that having an icon that's 3x bigger will completely devalue their skill, break the meta, and allow casuals that just started pking to compete at their big dick level. 
---
The range skill cape and standard max cape both currently function as an Avas accumulator. 
---
The question is basically asking should people be able to wear range/max cape and benefit from their respective stats (namely defense and prayer bonus) while also gaining the improved ammo collection of the assembler.
---
Actually disgusting. 
---
Oh wow I didn’t know that, I’ll def do that next. Should I use my 70 range as my main combat method with fight caves?
---
This is why the voting system in this game is fucked up. Always has been fucked up and always will be. 
---
I agree, I voted no. But you can't say " all of the PvM updates are going to pass with flying colors " when in the same poll, a PvM proposal is failing.
---
It's not a stun, it's a root. If they camp pray mage you have no choice but to half freeze, and it's very easy to tank all the way down when you're only getting half entangled. 
---
Yea I see your logic and I’m clueless when it comes to pvp, but I think the two aren’t comparable
---
...like keeping your defense under 40?
---
Im a heavy afk player, only play while playing other games. Slayer is REALLY slow for me
---
A guess a little risk is too much for a chance of getting 50M items
---
My point is that 99% of pkers wear salads and hides and also risk nothing.
---
Nice!  I’ve been using mith darts without the blowpipe. Also msb with rune arrows are cheap. I pray flick eagle eye and get 70-80k xp/hr without power ups. Much slower than bp but cheaper
---
That's fair...not the greatest comparison but imo its ridiculous the poll isn't being passed 
---
It's worth it though.
---
Reminds me of that guy that did this irl with an oversized paperclip and ended up with a house at the end of it
---
I get annoyed with the constant PvM updates too, but this just isn't true. PvPers have tried coming together to stop tons of updates for PvM.
---
fuck me the irony 
---
No worries man, all the jokes here went over my head until I started really progressing in the game. Still happens from time to time :P
---
I
---
Individual spells have no accuracy modifier. Every spell is equally accurate given the same external factors.
---
It's better xp, yeah. Just more click intensive.
---
No, dumbass, nobody risks blessed d'hide in wild unless risk fighting maybe. it's just for pvm. 
---
I agree we the above comments as I have 7 accounts.
---
Hello it's me, elite void, the range gear that also gives prayer bonus
---
When your construction and woodcutting are both 99
---
Waves prior are so fucking easy wtf
---
Well players already have the client installed, so they wouldn’t lookup “runescape” everyday. Interesting statistic tho
---
My favorite part about polls not being hidden is that they didn't hide them before doing qol month that involves lots of polls
---
Autist. Jmods said mobile updates were never supposed to influence desktop.  
---
An activity bar would work, but it should be enough to just run around for example, because sometimes you have to wait for enemy runners to show up. If you got kicked out for that it would be unfair.
---
Y'all got any more of them pixels? 
---
No one told me socialism is bad, I can just look at history at every socialist attempt failing miserably and impoverishing the people.
---
Yes women do have it better off. Stop playing victim. Achieve something in life and you’ll realize how dumb your younger self was
---
The pvp community did though. Obviously not everyone in the pvp community did, but it was such a simple and perfectly reasonable quality of life update that was voted no because it could make casting a specific spell quickly a bit easier.
---
Well it is literally ruining the game for one side for sure. 
---
This fucking guy jumping on every thread to pretend that jagex never does anything for PVPers.
---
There are 10% as many PVPers in this game as PVMers, tell me why you deserve more than 10% of the updates.
---
Do it, you’re only like 5 medium length quests off of 200.
---
Yeah, no point leveling, say, farming when you can get to 35 from quests you'll have to do anyways.
---
Got to 99 cooking with sharks from 83-99 in 4 days, made 6m profit as well, this isn't worth it.
---
I've been doing this grind on mobile as well. I wish I could fill the coal bag from bank and empty it with 1click. Otherwise it's fairly easy. I just don't know what the best method of using stamina's is yet.
---
74% voted yes.
---
Quests
---
oh no the horror, people might actually start risking more than a 20k gmaul.
---
It isn't quality of life if it's to counteract someone's own problems lol. Just remember to bring tools instead of being silly and making the same mistake over and over? The game shouldn't reinforce your own errors.
---
That's a little different. That's an economy thing, and while it sucks. If it was a safe zone, your black chins would be worth shit.
---
You've not unlocked the master diaries yet? Loool
---
What does it add to the fight though? When I first learned the fight every video said to do it, but even when the few times I forget to make the click and my blowpipes smacking away at Vorkath, the spell will go off.
---
&gt; It's a flat-out buff.
---
Yeah, thats the point. Normal spells need a buff, but pvm dorks won't allow it because they want it to stay easy to escape
---
45def is zerker
---
The only manchild here is you. Nice bait though.
---
Just try at weekends whenever you have freetime. Whats the worst you can lose, 400k and/or some  time lost?
---
Just do it at weekends and if youre really poor/desperate ask a friend to loan some gp or buy a bond. Really. Noone will coodescent you for selling bonds if youre really just nervous.
---
GO AHEAD AND DO IT MAKE UR DREAMS COME TRUE!
---
Oh god it’s an Alpha male get him while he’s weakened fellow RS BETAS 
---
Right, it’s always seemed like a bad design/ bug when I first killed it, doesn’t make sense to me why it wouldn’t pass
---
The only difference is one right click...
---
I went to a small school, everyone knew that I played hard for and I didnt give a rip what they had to say about it. It was so well known that i overheard some grade school kids on the bus refer to me as my rs name a handful of times.
---
We apologise
---
that shit was harder than galvek no lie
---
&gt;I can just look at history at every socialist attempt failing miserably and impoverishing the people.

Oh here we go taking extreme examples, there are shades of socialism you know. I want european socialism where they have universal healthcare and education. 
---
&gt;Yes women do have it better off. Stop playing victim.
---
Except they really don't. I am a male, how am I playing the victim for admitting we discriminate against women?
---
Newsflash: Men "get paid more" because we work harder. The gender pay gap is an illusion that women on average are payed less. They, on average, occupy positions that pay less. It has nothing to do with comparing people with the same jobs. The reality is, CEO's and STEM related positions pay much more and those jobs happen to be occupied by men traditionally. There is no barrier preventing women from entering those fields that pay more. No one is forcing you to go to college for gender studies. Want to get paid as much as the average man? Do what the average man does and go into a science or engineering related field. Those employers are BEGGING for women to apply but they just don't. Giving off the illusion that women are paid less for the same job when they absolutely aren't. 
---
I can dispute your other points as well, I just want to make sure you understand that the gender pay gap is bullshit before we continue. 
---
Are you going to start crying about people dying in a pvp zone?
---
I 100% dont buy this whole "people are voting no out of spite" bs. Its just a needles update that wont change the game, nobody is going to use blessed hides in PvP because it cost over 20x as much for +1 pray bonus, which pures dont even get that much use out of anyways. Its not passing because it's pointless and a waste of dev time
---
sooooooo much this if you feel youre gonna screw up at prayer flicks
---
Is it? I think this type of poll really kind of shows it's not. I thinks this type of poll completely debunks the theory that everyone just spam votes yes or bandwagons.
---
What type of person votes no to 1 def god hides but votes yes to buffing snares?
---
What type of person votes yes to serp but no to 1 def god hides?
---
Vorkath isn't passing because there are a legitimate amount of players who don't find it necessary to nerf a mechanic of the fight for no reason. Just click the ground. It's not like the mechanic is broken.
---
There are very clearly quite a few different types of people who are voting differently from this poll.
---
I would vote yes on raising the requirement of basic d'hide chaps. It makes no sense that they have no defense requirement.
---
The worst part about a Settled video is that I have to wait another week for the next one to come out :(
---
Lol your reddit post is going to change EVERYTHING! No more hate on runescape guys. This guys fun is being ruined 
---
Reminder that ancient spellbook doesn't have teleblock.
---
75k magic and 75k crafting xp per hour.
---
Because nothing says "I'm totally fucked." like getting Barrage frozen in the Wildy.
---
I think it's more toxic to spite vote against people for doing what they're supposed to be doing. What's next, people gonna vote no to pvm updates because "I had to do a clue and the kbd kept attacking me. What a toxic douche!"
---
I voted 'no' for all changes that are not "QoL". Are you assuming that because the other buffs are passing, that the person you replied to voted yes to them? You may be right, but you have no evidence of this.
---
The Serp helm is different, it used to have +5 Strength, and it was taken away. It was made strictly worse than a free, garbage, easy to get helmet. It's not QoL, I still voted no out of principle, but I agree that it should be changed back.
---
Standard spellbook binds should be considered a consistency or integrity change. They shouldn't be polled, and it should just be done regardless. Either Protect From Magic reduces all binds, or no binds.
---
Pures aren’t allowed the plus 1 prayer apparently 🤷🏽‍♂️ not like they’re getting rid of the 70 range requirement...
---
plus those rejuvinations were catered more towards pvm than pvp. I assume the two updates were Mage Arena 2 and Revenants? One is a BiS mage cape which everyone would want no matter what. Then the other is massive gold/hr pvm content with the occasional world hop/teleport.
---
I kill most of the noobs who attempt to pk my alt, so idc much about the risk as much as I care about the idiot's trying to make it harder forppl minding their own business. Doesnt matter what you think about the concept of the wildy when the majority of the game doesnt think they should be forced into it for certain content. Things like rev caves are the only place I accept ppl pking pvmers
---
I only want to know one thing.. are you shaking?
---
Useful for tree runs
---
I sincerely believe most people on this sub are illiterate. Serp helm and normal spellbook buff are also pretty big changes and the second I mention those things everyone fucks off.
---
just because you haven't seen the clip yet doesn't mean he didn't do that already.
---
I agree that a lot of people vote against PvP but come on bruh, you cannot deny that the PvP community is incredibly toxic in general. Every top clan / team has been known to do stuff below the belt and just the general flaming of victims isn't new. To be fair, Jagex messed up with GP / HR and ezscape a lot themselves, NMZ was never supposed to be the best combat xp for example, look how that turned out... same with Zulrah which wasn't supposed to be THAT good. On the other hand Jagex HAS to keep releasing stronger stuff because else it'll be dead content pretty fast. This game simply wouldn't survive or flourish as it does now without constant updates of new content that bring in new items to grind for.
---
You have no clue how pking works do you? 
---
needs more jpeg tbh
---
Sorry you wanted it and it didnt pass. I know some pkers who wanted it as well. I think a lot of the issues with it was the fact that jagex stated mobile wouldn't effect updates yet that was polled multiple times in different ways.
---
Yea I'll just bring my friend to teleblock the people I'm pking outside of multi. 
---
"why can't this game mechanic designed to increase risk be changed so that it has.no risk?"
---
I'm glad it didn't pass. Want better gear? Train defense.
---
I don't know what's happening but he is so excited 
---
Name checks out
---
Nice way to hate on an anti hate post
---
Not adding pvp updates=dead pvp, you literally dont make any sense, i linked ur last comment to couple friends, and they have no idea whats you are talking about.
---
Exactly same story. Very very involved in sports &amp; other shit, and played runescape / Minecraft every night nonstop.
---
lol why would that be something I ever noticed.
---
For what it's worth there's a safespot in the Slayer tower, but it's a little difficult to set up.
---
No you don't xD
---
is there a reason why you assumed I voted on it? I skipped that question.
---
So ur saying it is aids to click, but it makes "fuck all difference" to pvpers? Delusional player.
---
I dont think pkers would want some1 who has trouble clicking on a spell icon as they are likely to stop pking after a couple days cuz of their low level mechanics. And if u do struggle to click on a spell in the spellbook, ur probably unable to do any difficult content.
---
Ur cat should trade u in for runes
---
Or just....log out. Over 1k clue scrolls done and I've never been killed on a trail. 
---
*hands pkers a pepsi*
---
Yeah this doesn't make any sense to me. Why would I start watching him if I never watched him before?
---
Let's make the GE less click happy while we are at it
---
Imagine thinking 1 def pures is an overpowered build. That just shows your ignorance on the meta
---
\#jadlivesmatter
---
None of those ways can be controlled by the victim. Currently no ways to escape in the wild atm except luck but I'm sure you don't experience that side of the coin so I wouldn't expect you to know.
---
I would be heading out into the wild a heck of a lot more if people couldn't just log in near me and instantly stack me out while I'm frozen. There's no skill involved and the odds are stacked so far in favor of the aggressor its stupid.
---
It's basic knowledge that has been around for over a decade.
---
it used to have +7
---
Waste of dev time. Implying pkers (and more specifically pures) are going to use blessed dhide in wildy is just an outright lie. Nobody is going to use gear that has 20x the cost for 1 prayer bonus. Stop whining its a waste
---
With your stats there is so much you could do! From what it looks like youve done a decent amount of slayer and trained range and melee stats. 144 qp is a decent amount for your level considering the total you can get is around 260. With your stats you could easily start learning barrows as your melee stats are perfect to start using dharoks, veracs, and karils etc. You’ll need 75 magic to use a trident to be more effective while killing the brothers but you could use an ibans staff until then. If youre interested in joining a clan message me and we can meet up ingame or something. For long term goals go for something like a quest cape or base 60/70 in every skill. Theres no way to max your account overnight but working at one skill little by little youll eventually find yourself closer and closer!
---
Just looking back, if mobile was out back then, id have a maxed acct, and probably would have dropped out of school lol.
---
"CC for feminists" 
---
"jewboy405"
---
The entangle update has been needed for ages. Go pk with entangle you’ll see. It’s not just the length of the freeze it’s how inaccurate it is vs dhides
---
What combat style is worth investing money into first? I’ve got around 80+ in all combat stats apart from ranged which is just below. I hear a lot of people talking about how powerful ranged is compared to the other two, is it worth selling melee gear to upgrade ranged gear? I’ve been making money doing melee slayer so far, but would like to get into some bossing soon. Any help appreciated!
---
You're a cunt
---
Haha one of the little guys tried, but cats can't use runes. Go him with that freeze 
---
I agree
---
Well, I had one of those slide out keyboard phones with no data throughout high school, so it wouldn’t have mattered for me LOL
---
I mean obviously it isn't? Sorry dude but you may be the stupid one here.
---
Call me crazy but being tb’d and frozen on same spell book all the time sounds like literal garbage to me. No thanks. 
---
Lol.
---
You can PM the HCIM_deaths twitter and the acct owner will add a little message for you of your choosing when you die.
---
So it's not easy to escape ancients when you're not teleblocked? 
---
Going in lmfao
---
because that's how mafia works 
---
Amen same reason I voted no and will continue to vote no on pvp polls
---
Amen. If one truly gives a shit about feminism and equality, that fight needs to be fought over in the middle east. Women have already won here and are measurably more powerful both legally and socially in western countries. Idk what the fuck this person hoped to find in a group of aged 25-30 males who play a videogame that most women would relentlessly insult us for playing.
---
Can you show your source for this? I have been using ice blitz when people are about to get away because I thought it was more accurate than barrage, this will make my whole life a lie
---
Who is telling them they can't go into stem though? As far as I can tell, it's just the feminists ironically. They are the only ones left telling women there's a reason they can't go into those fields. I'm in a stem major currently and I can tell you from experience, that employers in these fields are begging for more women to apply. The women that are in my classes, do very well and are great examples of how a little initiative can go very far.
---
The past has a huge effect on the present. That I agree. Race is a separate issue though, let's not detract. Women, after the 2nd wave of feminism in the 1970's, gained a lot of stride in becoming more equal in the workplace. They wanted office jobs with more power like the men had. That's fair, and they got rid of the stigma against women going into leadership roles for the most part. I agree that an overall social stigma doesn't just disappear over night, but to be fair, it has been nearly 50 years since then. There simply isn't anything left preventing women from taking these career paths. There are more tv shows, movies, and other media that show women in leadership roles. There are tons of examples of powerful, wealthy women who one can use as a role model. 
---
Why do you still allow this idea to fester in our society? Women can do whatever they want and are slowly incorporating themselves into these workplaces that traditionally accomodated men only. That's all we can hope for. You can't force companies to hire a certian percentage of women. It doesn't work. Affirmative action is a good parallel example, though I don't want to get into race. You can only hope that more women, over time, apply themselves through their own initiative and have the same or better qualifications than the other applicants. 
---
Complaining about that trend is exactly like a child constantly whining during a road trip, "are we there yet?? Are we there yet? Why aren't we there yet? This is bullshit, drive faster!" What I mean by that is, society is gradually incorporating more women in higher paying fields. There is no good being done by complaining that women "get paid less". It is a false narrative that is pushed to sensationalize the public so the media can make more money by making more controversial articles. It's a bunch of horseshit basically. Women are strong and independant and can do whatever the hell they want and that should be celebrated. As long as the trend shows that more women are becomjng ceo's and engineers, then we're fine. No one wants to hear people complain about this nonsense. 
---
Look, I can't speak for the whole sub, but I'm a 20 something year old guy and am just assuming my opinions are shared by a large majority of people on this sub and in game. Most of us probably don't want to hear about feminist garbage, sorry to break that to you. Feminism is needed where women genuinely don't have rights. Runescape is just a weird place to get that conversation going lmao. I'm just tryna get some xp.
---
I highly to encourage you to test it. Get a friend and go to a pvp world. Have them put on black dhide and pray mage. Try to cast entangle, fire wave with mystics on. 
---
It definitely is.  Even standards regularly splashes on full rune which makes 0 sense. 
---
They won’t. From the past experience of how jagex treats pvp they couldn’t care less
---
ThIs Is QoL nOt PvP PoLlS!!!
---
I honestly dont care for that for now.  Att str def is about 43/45/41 so there is no way I can kill 29 adulr green dragons. I did Elvarg yesterday, the costs in food means I have to walk to a bank every other dragon.. need to lvl woodcutting to reach the babies though, its at 17 now
---
Fuck. You. BTW.
---
Getting it banned.
---
Chaps and vambs don't require 40 def...
---
**EI PERKELE**
---
Is halloween getting too sexy for kids?
---
????????? so dont go into the wilderness?
---
With Skiller Girl trying to make you give her bonk
---
That’s hilarious, my girl calls it “your wizard game” because I was barraging a Slayer task and that was her first sight of the game. Then she kept trying to Snapchat it to her friends calling me a dork. Now she just accepted it as well. Love hearing this stuff haha
---
Gotta love people down voting because they disagree with the polls
---
420 copy that
---
Fuck
---
Lmao, let me get this straight. You're against pure getting +1 prayer and fashionscape, while having no effect on other aspects of the game (other than increasing demand on items from clue scrolls).
---
But you support completely changing how the combat level system works? 
---
Great thought process!
---
Na I voted against it as payback for the resizeable spellbook shitstorm. What goes around comes around.
---
You probably die because of boredom, everyone else dies because of nerves
---
If you don't want to get killed filling buckets of sand don't do it on a pvp world. Clues force you into the wilderness sand doesn't. 
---
What are you talking about? This is about runescales popularity
---
Lucky for me i didnt care if people knew that i played back then. I just kinda did my own thing.
---
Hours of effort? What are you bringing into the wild mate?
---
Go ahead. Ill vote against your pvp content.
---
Still trying to watch your channels back catalogue; episode 41 so far 🙂
---
Im confused, so if there garbage then bring some pvp gear of your own and fight back. You will get your clue done and 100k+ loot
---
I read this as Full Graceful Underwear. 
---
I was intrigued, I'll admit. 
---
Most hardcores won't go for emblems. Not worth the risk.
---
For some reason I have a really hard time getting into slayer... but it is certainly on my list of to-do's
---
Are you dumb? Who are you to decide what people get to talk about? I am asking for a specific CC to talk with like minded people. Mind your own business. 
---
What's harder? Killing a demiboss a few thousand times, or clicking an inanimate object 50 thousand times. A 3 year old can get 99 wc, a 3 year old can't kill hydra. 
---
I named some easy bosses. 
---
Splash on full rune? What mage armor are you wearing? 
---
I interpreted nasty in the original post as toxic piers. I agree it should be dangerous and scary just not toxic Is what I was meaning
---
literally only hurts pures, how would adding 40 def requirement do anything when 40 def is literally 2 quests
---
😁
---
1. That's a dumb way to look at it. 
---
2. Yes but it functions as armor
---
3. Nah
---
Getrude will gladly sell you a kitten :)
---
wanting to change a process that is literally a single click to make it easier lol ya'll are funny
---
yeah, work smarter and more efficient. I forgot the game changed to efficienteasyscape
---
You refused to make an informed decision on spellbook size filters. Why should we listen now?
---
I felt bad cause i did not intend to offend him but I accepted him banning me and told him to take care and assumed that was it.
---
But he responds by complaining about negativity and then tells me to fuck off.
---
I honestly thought he was a nice person that I had offended but such an extreme response proved me wrong.
---
Selling twow
---
Fyi a main with defence and a reasonable magic level will easily outlast a 1 defence pure assuming they know how to correctly switch prayers and fight back. Playing a pure doesn't give you that much of an advantage against a player that knows what they're doing.
---
It has nothing to do with the challenge. No one bosses for the challenge, everyone bosses for the potential reward. The same applies to pking, you attack and kill people for their items/perceived items. 
---
You don’t kill Bandos expecting to get a tassy drop every kill. Pkers don’t kill nakeds/PvMers expecting a +1 either. Both parties do it for the unexpected rare chance at a high value item. 
---
I have no research to back this claim up, but I'd find it very likely that having "Skip question" as the first choice would at least subtly suggest to players that the developers do not want players voting Yes or No if the players feels they are not knowledgeable about the issue or implication(s) of the question passing/failing and are not interested in educating themselves.
---
Range is obscenely strong but compared to melee it has pretty few items to invest in. Armadyl is a very marginal upgrade over dhide, it's not super necessary. Which really just leaves anguish (15m), arch ring (5m), and pegs (35m, also pretty marginal upgrade). And then the big daddy rigour at like 70m. Bar rigour, you can unlock the vast majority of range dps upgrades with like 25m. The difference is that range costs a fair bit to operate from blowpipe, which is very good most places.
---
Imo if you have blowpipe/anguish you're like 90% of the way there, no need to sell stuff to buy any more than that. 
---
They have never come anywhere close to catering more to PVP. People aren't advocating for them to do more pvp updates than pvm updates. Half of the pvp updates they've done have been partially pvm or skilling updates, they just involve pvp because they're in the wilderness. 
---
Pvmers outnumber pkers 10:1 because in early osrs, the game was dying, and the initial set of updates that revived the game were pvm updates. This attracted pvmers, and took a small amount of people away from pvp. When the ratio changed even further towards pvmers and fewer pkers, more people asked for pvm updates, and fewer people asked for pvp updates. You can see how that cycle went. It's not caused by merit of the potential of the respective areas of the game, it's the history of development without careful consideration to what they were influencing. 
---
I'm not a pker, but I respect the design vision of a game with more active pvp where more players are incentivised to use the wilderness for useful pvm and skilling content, and they accept that being attacked functions as a balancing factor and not a useless gimmick. I'll support good pvp updates when I see them, same as skilling and pvm updates.
---
I’ve been here for 2 weeks 
---
I skipped that question.
---
pkers bitch about it more because they haven't had an update in years. imagine if only pvp had updates and pvm was left in the dust, how would you feel then?
---
Not having time to play is sad, but being busy with stuff that makes you happy is dope. Gotta pick your battles homie!! 
---
The amount of memes you managed to get in this is god-tier.
---
Make her bag not require a herblore lvl
---
This is what I was meaning
---
But where is toto?
---
Yeah they brought this one on themselves. Hope they enjoy losing it for the 1% difficulty increase in clicking barrage.
---
I'm a pvmer. I also voted yes on the d'hide shit. I don't think it has anything to do with pvmers, it has to do with the fact that people view lowering any requirements at all as "ezscape rs3 bullshit" and ignore the fact it doesn't actually make any sense in the first place for them to have those requirements.
---
For some reason though, that doesn't carry over to buffs. Buffs seem to pass. My gut says that's because players tend to look at things and say "does this make it easier for me", and if yes they vote yes. If no, the next question is "does this make it easier for other people", and if yes they vote no. Because it's a "if i had to put up with it, then so do you" mentality.
---
...Which means vote results for polls like this could probably be determined beforehand simply by looking at the % of players who will benefit from it vs the number of players who had to put up with it the old way. And this is why mods shouldn't poll this kind of stuff, they should just make the decision themselves and tell people to deal with it.
---
Semantics, but any additive stats to something/someone that was not there before is a buff. Pure accounts cant use them atm and if it passed they could gain access to them. That's a buff by definition.
---
It's a shit buff that would almost never even matter but a buff none the less.
---
Why can't nooby pkers get ancients?
---
if you read my other replies, youll see that i already said that i do kill a bunch of the ppl who try to pk me while im doing stuff even on my alt lol. they dont have the ability to fight ppl who fight back and that is why they are hunting clue scrollers. if you dont see the issue with that then idk i am wasting my keystrokes here.
---
I'm just going to continue not to vote.
---
Great contradiction. "Who are you to decide what problem get to talk about". "I'm angry that others hold different views than me and report them for talking about it". You are the dumbest person here. And I've seen your other comments. Demeaning minorities while promoting your owns "troubles" is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Take a good look at yourself dumbass.
---
What other ironmen series should I be watching
---
Suggestion: program emotion into cats
---
&gt;Couldn’t be any more insignificant 
---
Then who cares if it passes or doesnt 
---
It's for pures who have 1 def.
---
Dude you’re absolutely fucking retarded if you’re concerned about saving $.13 per mill you’re so lazy that you can’t to get the money yourself and you’re worried about .13 cents. Get a fucking actual job and buy the bonds the right way you p.o.s.
---
Bet you also announce in chat whenever you gain a level. "w00t 68 fetching." 
---
Cool, you got a pet. 50k other people have that pet too. How many people have olm pet though? Do something that's actually an accomplishment
---
Pures can and do still do it you fuckin dolt. I’m not even a pure but people like you who purposely want to block them from everything possible for no reason are pathetic 
---
Care to share the template?
---
Same.
---
I made this like 1-2 days ago so I'm surprised you know it's a repost?

Don’t bother raiding til your base 80s combat. At this point you’d just hold teams back unless any of your friends take you for fun

Since Woox is quitting, they’re hosting a double xp weekend.

Where do you see hate sjw? Only positive words from this redditor from here on out ! Let's come together guys not attack one another
---
Wow. Part of me is wondering how the hell people don’t know chaps are 1 def, but then I remember Jamflex does something stupid like make god d’hide require 40 def across the board, when clearly their counterparts only require 1 def for chaps/vambs. 
---
Are you at white wolf mountain? You have to be there for the npc to actually take it.
---
**IT'S MA'AM
---
&gt;It doesn't even matter why are voting no?
---
Vs.
---
&gt;You're going out of your way to ruin the game for people.
---
Pick one.
---
ok see you in 2021 lol
---
I am assuming defense was probably your next 99 (if you didn’t fuck up str)
---
Post the logs then
---
OMG stoopid noobs with a totel level of 60 are FUCKING UP THE GAME REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
15k omegalul
---
Yeah. That's the point. The point is to enable solo pkers so you run into a solo pkers more often than teams of them.
---
You stand a much better chance of getting away/fighting back against a single pker as opposed to just getting raped when a team appears.
---
I agree, naturally a group of people would have the advantage over a single player. This doesn't change that at all. You seem very confused.
---
Vestment robes.  Believe me I don't understand it either, must be my rng. I don't really feel like risking chaos elder ones. 
---
Agreed, but at least it's better than 500exp per head like they were proposing yesterday. Maybe for 2020's QOL we can increase the prayer exp lol.
---
Ironically you wouldn't have a game to play without pvp players, but of course you wouldn't know about that.

Go kick rocks bud

We live in a society
---
This is just straight fucking stupid and will ensure a viscous cycle. Jmods said mobile wouldn't bring changes to desktop and here you are crying about a change that was only meant for mobile.  
---
&gt; Also it’s ridiculous that you don’t hide poll results jamflex. 
---
This community voted against hiding poll results. Personally, I'm not sure why it was even polled and not sure why people would be against that, but that's what happened.
---
&gt; All this hate on either side is ruining the game for me more than any mechanic that could be polled.
---
Play a different game or ignore others; the OSRS community sucks, and this thread isn't really going to change that.
---
If I die at Corporeal Beast, do my dropped items instantly appear for everyone or are they safe for an hour?
---
Because people will teleport lmao. Nooby pkers need to start fighting people doing green dragons and shit, which is easily teleportable.
---
Didnt woox do a no supplies inferno? 
---
This would make it extremely hard for pkees to find other pkers to fight, for pvmers to find open worlds for wilderness bosses, and would likely hurt people trying to avoid pkers more than help them. When i do clues or train prayer on my ironman i log from pkers way more often than they happen to log in next to me.
---
Also there is a way to escape pkers lol just bring tank gear and food and you can tank out even a full tb in singles pretty easily. Players complain about not being able to fight back or escape from pkers but they don't even consider bringing items and gear to do so. Obviously a naked person or even someone with only veracs shouldn't be able to escape from a pker with freezes...
---
I'd rather they make pures less viable than give them better equipment.
---
fuuuuu I want that pet so badly
---
Yes this is totally a good idea, because getting the opinion of 100 people is enough to make a decision for the 100,000 that actually use the content. 
---
Lol... Eoc killed not bro
---
I highly encourage you to try it. Put on mystics and try to entangle someone in black dhide with pray mage 
---
No thanks no need to make things easier than they are ay 
---
No, ancients is MUCH stronger than standard magic.  Ice barrage can also hit many more targets at once, freezes and deals damage all in the same go.  Not to mention for fire surge to deal that much damage certain conditions must be met (hello tome of fire).  The freeze from barrage is also longer than entangle.
---
No, it's really not. Trying to look for small technicalities like that is a joke of an argument. An AGS looks pretty heavy and has a strength bonus, but that doesn't require a Strength level to wield. 
---
Using arguments like that just go to show how petty the people against some of the changes are. It just shows you don't have a serious argument against it
---
Which wont do anything, we out number you at least 5 to 1
---
Leave the poor bots alone man especially the Zammy wine grabbing ones. They are helping a lot of players by making herblore more affordable. If anything we need more, not less bots.

Didn't really think that one through did you?

Low defense pure pking is giant, im not big into pking but it could definitely help low defence pures. Not a big thing 
---
Upvoted for visibility, community is fucking losing it
---
Spell book filters were broken since they were to be allowed in the wilderness. If they removed the option to be used in the wildy then it would have passed. 
---
I dont see how these are related but it really depends on how the nerf is proposed.
---
&gt;Who is telling them they can't go into stem though?
---
Parents, teachers and friends who perpetuate rigid gender roles. Why can't a male child play with barbies and wear dresses?
---
&gt;they got rid of the stigma against women going into leadership roles for the most part.
---
Yet management roles are overwhelmingly men.  
---
&gt;You can't force companies to hire a certian percentage of women.
---
We can if we elect more people like AOC and ilhan omar or a leader like trudeau &lt;3 who's cabinet is at least 50% female. 
---
&gt;You can only hope that more women
---
Hope is useless, we need to continue aggressively pushing our agenda. 
---
&gt; As long as the trend shows that more women are becomjng ceo's and engineers, then we're fine.
---
I am sure this was the attitude in the 70's too when women won great battles. It's basically men afraid of losing their privilege saying okay ladies that's enough now. 
---
&gt;No one wants to hear people complain about this nonsense.
---
White males don't want to hear. Minorities do. #outoftouch
---
&gt;Runescape is just a weird place to get that conversation going lmao. I'm just tryna get some xp.
---
That's why i am asking for a specific CC to discuss with like-minded people. Why did you click this thread if you don't want this conversation? You are full of shit.
---
Nope, different person. I am 3km. 5km is my friend :)
---
It seems kind of fitting that the Tai Bwo Wannai Tribe would have the equipment necessary to hunt animals in their environment, no?
---
I don't think they should have put a chisel at the arceuus runecrafting mine, though, that seems excessive.
---
Imagine playing osrs and wanting to rework the combat system LUL
---
And minor changes like adding def to everything 
---
That's because in 2007 the only reason we were in the wildy were to kill green dragon bots or run to kbd. Basically everything else is need. Every update since has exacerbated the problem massively. That's why the complaints about the issue have grown.
---
&gt; Also you would be fucking shocked at how much loot you can get off random players who seemingly have nothing 
---
PKers are like gamblers. They may get nothing 99/100, but they'll never talk about that. Then that 1 time they hit it big, they'll tell that story forever, and use that 1 time to justify those next 100 trips.
---
&gt; because they're too fucking stupid to bring a hide set/some brews and learn how to change prayers correctly in a pvp 
---
How many PKers know how to flick solo bandos? Or do inferno? "Fucking stupid" people who can't be bothered to learn how to change prayers properly in PVM. But they don't pvm, so why the fuck would they bother to learn that? Just like why the fuck would pvmers learn to pvp, when they have 0 desire to engage in pvp?
---
Hai :)
---
I’m less inclined to care about pure accounts. I just think if your account is a main you should be st least 115 combat. I raid with maxed pures all the time!
---
If they polled it once and it didn’t pass, I wouldn’t mind.
---
But they polled it 3 times and waited for it to fail by .1% percent and didn’t implement it because some pk streamers were angry. 
---
Yeah, but that doesn't mean serp should be BIS slot again, I'd rather have a different boss/quest/content give a BIS helmet. As it is every unique drop Zulrah has is BIS.
---
Nah it’s more the fact that they aren’t able to implement updates that would be better for the overall game because people hate a certain community and would downvote a poll due to pvm vs pvp rather than the content of the actual poll.
---
If im ever in the wilderness for whatever reason, I want to minimize my chances of death, as is logical. I camp pray mage a lot of the time when PKers are near and halving the bind duration of these spells is ideal for survival, voting against this would just be shooting myself in the foot
---
Anybody know if you cant 3tick efficiently with mousekeys/ahk? Im currently suffering from pretty bad tendinitis in my mouse hand, but I would really like to 3t fish by primarily moving my mouse using WMK or AHK.  
---
Not funny, 0/10 meme 
---
Pls never post again :\^)
---
Why though? I can’t see where they’d be a problem unless you choose to take part in stupidly specific content in the game
---
This is a horrible guide. You didn't even tell people not to fletch! 
---
So the only questions besides the hide thing that arnt QoL are...
---
1.Trophy heads on alter
---
2.Serp helm
---
3.Vorkath
---
4(?). Pest control win board.
---
Trophy heads are passing because people want a use for duplicate heads they have stored. Not QoL, dont know why this is here skipped it.
---
Serp is passing because it got over nerfed into the ground so people want it to be better then a 50k helmet. Not QoL but should have never got nerfed this hard because the nerf never passed a poll.
---
Vorkath is failing
---
Pest control is passing. Not a QoL but will literally not change the game in anyway so its w/e
---
So to recap, 8 non QoL questions in the poll. 5 of which are failing. 2 which do almost nothing or do nothing.And 1 is passing. It seems to me the non QoL updates are getting fucked pretty hard.
---
So that’s what having no life looks like 
---
Prison Mike spitting rhymes
---
Agreed. I did this the other day. I would have much rather played but I didn’t understand at all looking through the book and it doesn’t have rewards I need, I just wanted to complete the diary and start my barrows runs I was so excited for! 
---
The issue is the fun of the mini game or the quality of the reward. Neither are there with trouble brewing haha 
---
No, different person. I am 3km. 5km is also my friend. :)
---
&gt; streamers
---
I think listening to any of these guys pvp or pvm is a huge issue but that is a whole different topic that I don't like at all. 
---
hai :)
---
Ive seen pkers freeze people in black dhide???????
---
Well the serp helm comes from an endgame boss and should be end game gear, not a neiz that you can unlock at level 60.
---
Waste of dev time? It won’t take more than a couple minutes.
---
This just doesn't solve anything.
---
This is a thing that i see a lot of people misinterpretating or outright refusing to realise.
---
**The people who vote no on a certain type of question is probably the person who is most engaged with that type of content**.
---
The guy who votes no on PvP polls is probably the guy who doesn't want their OP methods or the meta to change because they have gottengood with it.
---
The guy who votes yes/no on Slayer content is probably the guy who does nothing but Slayer all day, complains that it is boring and wants a new boss or the skill to be easier and/or faster.
---
You really think that the people who are going to vote no to Warding are going to be noobs? The people who are going to vote no to warding are probably longtime players who don't want things to change or become more interesting, the very same group of players that people consider "experts" of the skill are probably the most adamant to vote no for them.
---
Just let the developers handle the updates to the game already.
---
Then propose a solution that benefits your pker vs pker environment but doesn't affect your pker vs pvmer environment, like changing how Entangle works only on Bounty Hunter worlds. People aren't ignorant of the topic, they just aren't voting yes to a question that asks if they want it to be easier to pk them.
---
PVP in this game is fucked because PVPers can't decide if they want  to improve actual PVP interactions or if they just want it to be easier to kill people doing Wilderness slayer. So long as people insist on the two groups being married there isn't a single meaningful PVP update that is going to enter this game.
---
This entire thread is full of people who don't understand dps
---
can i have tassets
---
Wow so suprised that the vorkath one isn't passing wtf
---
Every example you listed is tied to a legitimate reason. There IS NO REASON for the 115 CB average.  
---
Arent some of these arguments void? If in a predator situation normal spellbook is worse then ancients whyd you continually bring the normal spellbook. It seems as if peopme are arguing the path of the normal spellbook simply because it those have teleblock. Logically we still should be looking at all the angles to come at this from a balancing perspective.
---
Tldr: havent voted yet.
---
~no one cares~
---
Why?
---
Pures will not, and will never, used blessed d'hide over black d'hide. It's a higher risk for stats they won't even benefit from anyways.  
---
This is entirely a buff to PvMers, allowing them to access that sweet sweet +5 Prayer from a full set of God D'hide without first achieving 40 defence.
---
The integrity of the game for most has nothing to do with pking, im voting for whats better for me.
---
That only applies to targets who try to run away? How does the dps from standards versus ancient compare to against target who actually fight back?
---
"They're teleblocked" Yes because no one has a tber in singles and multi that gets on then gets off so someone with a real spellbook and kill the target.  Standard spellbook isn't just teleblock, its incredibly underpowered.  Good luck fighting someone who's tele blocked and on ancients if ur on standard spellbook.  You sound like someone whos never pked, go try it out
---
Teleblock
---
dear lord
---
False equivolency. Free speech stops when you are being abusive and harassing. Am I really out of line for reporting someone for saying women deserve to be raped?  
---
&gt;And I've seen your other comments. Demeaning minorities while promoting your owns "troubles" is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
---
In what way did I demean minorities? 
---
I love him
---
meanwhile I spaghetti on one jad with my eyes glued to the screen
---
Yeah but imo it’s unfortunate because now there’s less room for a bis melee helm to come from a future update, whether it be a new boss or new grandmaster quest or something. At this point post-nerf it seems like an unnecessary power creep that no one asked for.
---
Tell that to the pkers getting 2000 blood runes from that kill. 
---
It's a pretty negligible DPS increase and will most of the offer none at all while potted. You'd be better off using something like Verac's plateskirt. The extra Def will make you eat less and thus attack more. Plus it has the handy prayer bonus.
---
Again, numbers are variable and is more related to high-level content.
---
All 150k of the players we have can't access vorkath. And those who can access vorkath, must have X amount of kills to vote on a poll related to vorkath. See where I'm getting at?
---
Okay now here’s a couple more questions:
---
1.) Were the vast majority of jobs extremely labor intensive? 
---
2.) How long did it take to cook 1 meal?
---
3.) How long did it take to do laundry? How long did it take to clean a house with no company created cleaning products?
---
4.) How long did it take to travel to the store?
---
5.) Were daycares prevalent back then?
---
6.) What was the average number of children per family? Did latex condoms exist yet? 
---
7.) Were labor intensive jobs safe? At what rate did women die when giving birth? How effective was medicine in saving lives? 
---
8.) How would children end up with no parental supervision at home? 
---
9.) How long was the average work day when there was no law about 40hrs/week? 
---
10.) What was the death rate for those labor intensive jobs? 
---
11.) If the death rate for women giving birth was relatively high and same for the baby, and women also then worked the same dangerous labor intensive jobs, what could people have done to stop the population from decreasing and ultimately going extinct? 
---
12.) Name some jobs positions women could have back then (given that they’re free to do whatever they wanted), positions that had enough openings for all women to work. 
---
13.) If women stayed at home because most jobs were physically labor intensive and most chores took all day and was basically a full time job, how would they know about the difficulties of the work place and use that knowledge to make an educated vote? 
---
Maybe it wasn’t oppression, maybe it was the only way to survive in a time with no modern technology or medicine or convenient businesses. Maybe chores that take you an hour today took all day back then. Maybe most women back then didn’t feel oppressed, they simply did what they had to for their family to survive and same with men. Maybe you’re looking into the past with 2019 eyes instead of 1919 eyes. 
---
Here's a very useful spreadsheet. You don't need to necessarily block the ones listed, as I think it's based solely on xp, but it helps you figure out necessary common blocks and whether you should block any others.

Logs?
---
Lol didn't know Shantay was finnish. Great meme
---
It increases risk pkers can take + adds variety? Why not? 
---
Ohh I got it now. Thanks for explaining this to me! Makes sense that I would have no idea since I have only done BP kills. 
---
I was really hoping the gif was gonna go in reverse at the end, so he’d build the door.

can anyone explain how he got 99 slayer?

It's a prop from the 2014 Hercules movie

---
Is this a joke? It’s like a 1/4 chance to even hit on someone’s black dhide with pray mage as it is
---
Each Piece is +4 mage attack dude of-course your going to splash. Especially if your trying to entangle someone with 90+ mage 
---
A ______ only that actually made me laugh. 
---
Ive used 3 different guides everytime i when to the beginning to solve this shit 
---
You should tweet Mod Ash asking why he did it then, it's probable he was involved in the 40 def requirement in 2006
---
That's why we have a skip button. There's decent people out there that use it when they can't form an opinion. I skipped it because I didn't know how vorkath worked. Btw.
---
PVPers are a minority so they get fewer updates, end of story. There was plenty of wilderness rejuvenation and the PVPers have nothing to complain about.
---
[Watch this and say that normal spellbook doesn't need changing](https://twitter.com/KFramed/status/1091042370601259008), and I'm not even a Pker. How can you not see that this is a problem...
---
And once again, people used AHK for more than just dropping items.

&gt; Normal spellbook is garbage and it needs to have any buff it can get. If this isn't proof enough of that fact then idk what is https://t.co/EDvVpSsYSp
---
Okay? I'm just saying entangle shouldn't necessarily be as good or better at freezing than ice barrage, even though freezing is it's only purpose. I'm not against the buff
---
He does 6 jads. He just fails D:
---
Pretty good, I'd say
---
You can just chose not to raid with shitter mains that aren’t 115 ch dude. The average prevents pures from participating. It’s not a choice 
---
I don't doubt there's *some* people who really vote like this, but is it really safe to say that there's a large enough majority of people who do this? The community on this subreddit is only a fraction of players who play the game.
---
Jagex is also free to manipulate polls however they want; you can see how you voted, but do you really *know* how others voted and if the numbers are accurate? There's no 3rd-party tracker for votes, and only Jagex presents the numbers for votes.
---
Alright since Doctorvenom said sooo.. dont get too butthurt Doctor! Remember this is all just a mmorpg from early 2000s :D so much seriousness and anger around here! Take a step outside and back and breathe some fresh air!!! Breathe in annnndddd breathe out. See doctor doesn't that feel good :) this is a reddit post calling for peace on a game thats almost 20 years old lol dont be such a serious sam ya downliking dickhead ! 
---
Raids 2 &gt; raids1 &gt; revs &gt; hydra &gt; arma/vorkath/zulrah &gt; everything else. 
---
If osrs progressed the same way rs2 did, we would of had 1-2 new skills, just based on frequency of new skills in the past. 
---
Congrats on the achievement dude! Do you have an estimate of how long this took you?
---
Stop being a pleb and use ancients?!?!
---
Pvp community is dying due to lack of updates.
---
&gt; with slayer partner and alts :)
---
How about instead if buffing Entangles, just make Protect Magic lower the freeze duration from Ice spells but also nerf black dhide to compensate?
---
loooool
---
Your chair must stink pal
---
Agree 100%
---
I love when noobs comment on reddit :) enjoy your dead content 
---
Perfect! That's my break exactly. Please do the drop like right away. I will only have 15 minutes lol
---
I said the combat level system, not the combat system.  Two level 80 accounts should be relatively equal in combat ability.
---
Is the 6 Jads challenge not sufficient practice? Do you have to fight all of them at once? If so how is that even possible
---
I don't think this is an apples to apples comparison. One change is to PvP, which is something all players have access to, regardless of account type. The other change is big only for UIM account types. Yes both UIM and PvPers are both minorities but one has way more implications than the other. One affects the balance of a multiplayer mode and one affects the access a more restricted account type has to a resource.
---
Not really comparable imo.
---
Ayy classic bros. We didn't even have an equipment interface, all your gear filled up your inventory!
---
Thanks, looking forward to more pure polls failing in the future.
---
This would end the opening and closing of the backpack and attack options and continue to maximize screen real estate for what’s actually happening on phone screens. 
---
&gt;appearently a few more but I havent seen any details on them so i wont include that
---
The only other change remotely similar to this I can think of is allowing an empty rune pouch to be brought into glarial's tomb. It's a change that only effects uim that rushed a pouch before the waterfall quest and I asked Ash to make the change after having to destroy mine. 
---
Those are the only 2 changes of their kind I know of, feel free to find more. Let's switch gears to why changes like these are fine and why god hide should be polled though. 
---
Adding a teasing stick to Karamja has a negative impact on no one. It may help very few people, but the person who came up with it gave a strong enough lore reason as to why it should exist. Something along the lines of:
---
&gt;why were these pits built if no one on the island can hunt these.
---
Mods got together, decided it makes sense and now the karamjan locals can hunt whatever those things are called. 
---
Essentially the same happened for my rune pouch change. I didn't come up with any lore, but pointed out that a small number of players on a specific type of account were being pointlessly punished for doing the early game out of order. Mods got together, saw it didn't effect anyone else and made the change.
---
Now, if those changes weren't polled why should this god hide one be?
---
Frankly, it impacts a lot of people. Let's be real, no one cares if pures have 1-2 more prayer bonus. The problem is fashionscape. Black d'hide g chaps are 1-2m for a pair. Why? Pures wear them. Absolutely no other reason. 
---
I dont know about you, but I dont personally want to pay more for my chaps just so pures can be a little more pretty while they pk and I'm sure not all, but a good portion of the no-voters followed the same logic. It's ridiculous to assume everyone voted no just to spite pkers.
---
Don’t enter the wildy if you’re afraid of getting pked. You go out with a whip a spade and your clue. You risk nothing, what’s the problem with a 1 minute inconvenience.
---
There should be a third form of punishment in addition to ban and kick: minigame ban.
---
For things like this that aren't against the rules, but are against the spirit of the game.
---
What did he mean by "Here's your logs"?
---
I have been in a familiar position, I told a streamer I really liked his stream and his mentality, he thought I was being sarcastic and banned me.
---
on kc 32, those are the right two.
---
Corporeal beast is no different than any other non-PvP area of the game. 
---
Your items will be safe for 1 hour. 
---
It does makes it easier to get fire capes. 
---
Two prayer points is 6.66% more prayer. 40 doses becomes 42 doses. Could be significant.
---
Fire capes are quite good.
---
Depending when you see it, the abreviated hiur time could be different. When I replied to you, this one said 6hrs, and the trending one said 4hrs. Regardless, the one that got upvoted more was definitely posted after this one. You can tell by sorting content filtered as 'new'. The one that was on the front or the Reddit was posted 2nd.
---
Ooohhh it looks like I’ll be able to get 30k exp from my cockatrice heads soon
---
Playing a pure doesn't give you an advantage? Guess that's why there's so many...
---
Because if people want to TB me AND catch long freezes, they can get 99 mage and use their spell book swaps wisely like everyone else.
---
Since the conflict between pkers against pvmers, skillers, clue hunters, or basically anyone that's not a pker, is this bad, would it actually be better for the game to have a separate game mode between pvp and pvming/skilling?
---
PvMers do clues/bosses/slayer in wildy and a pure kills them and they get butthurt. It's literally why theres almost never a pvp poll that passes.
---
I don't even do pvp anymore, so i dont really care but its just sad really. then pvmers wonder why pvpers dont vote yes for their updates. its a vicious cycle
---
because they didn't want random event NPCs taking up a bunch of space crowding bank areas and the ge
---
Oof its like real life
---
instead of just defaulting to yes, I usually vote no if the question sounds like it's a change just for the sake of change. like when people ask for every useless p2p item to be made f2p. these little incremental changes/buffs aren't necessary  
---
there's definitely some irrational hate towards pkers but I don't think this is a good example of it
---
Perhaps I should have clarified for pkers that are quick to throw out the irrelevant conclusion + ad hominem combo.
---
It makes fuck all difference clicking small barrage or slightly larger barrage since the ancient spellbook is already spread out. There isn't a problem with ancients beyond small icons. 
---
The problem with the normal spellbook is not only the small icons, but how cluttered and packed it is. The spell filtering that passed did help with this. 
---
This is what a shitty cheap door looks like. 
---
Source: I’ve kicked down a shitty cheap door 
---
I think the answer here is not to remove the halving effect of normal spellbook spells, but to halve the effect of ancient spells!!!
---
A perfect way to bring balance to content, as things should be.
---
Thanos approves
---
Now *that's* a reaction
---
It's best to start bursting, if you can afford it, at MM2.
---
Nice, thank you
---
And nobody is forcing you to PK on normals, brainlet
---
Well hes a pure they are all pretty toxic, i dont get how anyone other than people that exploit pvp by creating and using pures could be ok with them. It is directly taking advantage of the game.
---
This.  
---
I would like the prestige of a UIM without all of the trickery, but not the single life of an HCIM.
---
I won't argue that seeing that at first is odd, but it has led to so much versatility. Something most other games are unable to offer. It's one of the reasons RS stands out still.
---
Let the game have variety
---
The food would be too complicated. What if you have Summer Pies, Brews, Sharks and Karambjwans? There’s already a left-click option for the HP Heart (to cure poison/venom).
---
I do like the sword spec idea though. 
---
It's about fashion. Also pures are pretty weak
---
They're not still going on about that are they?
---
isthisbait.jpeg
---
Because Vorkath is easily learned.
---
How is the standard spellbook failing so hard.  Wish only pkers got to vote on pvp updates, this is fucked.
---
So you own a couple of these I’m guessing..? 
---
&gt;PKers are like gamblers. They may get nothing 99/100, but they'll never talk about that. Then that 1 time they hit it big, they'll tell that story forever, and use that 1 time to justify those next 100 trips.
---
So you think i'm lying? I have zero reason to brag to you about peasant loot from pvmers when my return sets are worth more than most players banks, i'm being totally honest with you, also how could you possibly know the rates of items dropped from pvmers if you don't pk yourself?
---
&gt;How many PKers know how to flick solo bandos? Or do inferno? "Fucking stupid" people who can't be bothered to learn how to change prayers properly in PVM. But they don't pvm, so why the fuck would they bother to learn that? Just like why the fuck would pvmers learn to pvp, when they have 0 desire to engage in pvp?
---
Are you trying to imply that learning inferno or how to flick bandos is harder than high end pvp? This will probably come as a shock to you but high end pvpers can perform better at high end pvm than the reverse. Seriously go and watch a high tier brid and tell me they couldn't easily learn inferno or learn something as arbitrary as flicking bandos.
---
The general store near the nature altar comes to mind 
---
1-69 was about 3-4k xp per hour, 69-83 about 7-8k, 83-99 average 10-11k. If I had to estimate the time it took it would be around 1300-1400 hours. that's without the making of alts. add another 500 hours ish to make the alts+money... 1-99 slayer did cost above 600m. 
---
Serp helm drops from an endgame boss and only holds value based on the scales you can break it down into.  Where our current bis helm is from a quest you can do at 60 combat, that's why it's passing.
---
This guy is a mad lad. Props to him though, he's great at what he's doing.
---
Looking forward to it man, don't think there's a way to stop you from quitting so best of luck in the future
---
Many reasons it should be implemented;
---
Pures can actually risk more 
---
Pking becomes more profitable 
---
God chaps value increases
---
someone made this over a year ago, sorry pal you werent first maybe not this

 version but the concept and photoshop

AHK would not be allowed for that kind of function.

The only thing mousekeys is useful for is dropping, but with shift drop you don't need it. 
---
It may help you to get some [celastrus bark](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Celastrus_bark). With that you have a 1 click action to start your 3 tick cycle, you don't need to use herb on tar. 
---
Personally I don’t want it as it will increase the price even further and I’m always poor, but it’s a change that should happen so I’m going to vote yes to it
---
I can't say I agree with you on this one. The 'influx of brand new players and RS3 transplants' is precisely the reason I want it to be hard for new suggestions to pass. Even if I am disappointed by these results. 
---
There's so many because pure vs pure is a totally different style of fighting than main vs main, one slip up basically means death on a 1 def pure.
---
I honestly don't own a pure, and I do duo pking, not solo pking. While both updates would have been good for the community as a whole, it's not like not having them impacts my massively.
---
Just sad to see them fail for the wrong reasons.
---
Look, I don't pk and I love wildy slayer but there's nothing wrong with PKers merking PvMs who are on task. Once you're in the wilderness you're fair game, you're the one putting yourself at risk so you *are* in the "same group". This update would encourage solo pking and imo it makes sense from a gameplay perspective.
---
I think there's certain content that should be removed from the wilderness(clues, maybe) to make sure that going there is an optional risk but that's a separate issue.

Actually, I'm not salty about anything, just disappointed. And re-read what I said please. I didn't say "everyone bandwagons votes", which you've tried to say I've implied twice now. I said that enough people do it to negatively impact the health of the game.
---
Has nothing to do with not getting my way, this happens no matter what the issue is. People did this with Pkers, Skillers, Low level players, High level players, ironmen. They voted no on redirection scrolls for ironmen for years, if that's not bandwagon voting out of spite, what's the argument for why that should have stayed the way it was?
---
It's fine if you want to willfully dismiss all the evidence of things over the years that have been voted on, either yes or no, in a bandwagon fashion, but don't try to act like it's such a small issue, when it's a pretty big deal. 
---
Also, I like how you keep trying to throw your own generalizations onto me regarding what my motives are or aren't, to try to attack my personal opinion by degrading it to just being "salty" or "whining because I didn't get my way". That's not how you have a constructive argument. 
---
Either way, thanks for the debate. Enjoy the rest of your day.
---
Dont see the problem with new spells, I never have pked before but when I'm in the wildy doing revs (doesn't happen often) I find it easy enough to get away from at least 2 people. As long as you  pray switch right and have a couple brews and a energy pot you're good
---
Is this a real question? If you are fighting ancients vs standard book, ancients win every single time. I shouldn't say win. But are way more powerful than standard. Like way way way more powerful. 
---
1.) Women showed they could do any work in times of war
---
2.) Men can't cook?
---
3.) Men can't do laundry? Men can't clean a house?
---
4.) Men can't travel to the store?
---
5.) Men can't look after children?
---
6.) "" ""
---
7.) This question is not specific to gender
---
8.) Men can't watch children?
---
9.) This question is not specific to gender
---
10.) This question is not specific to gender
---
11.) You realize it takes a male and a female to reproduce right?
---
12.) Agriculture, textiles, bookbinder, carpenter, hatter, printer, ropemaker, saddlemaker, teacher, lawyer, doctor, scientist, chandler shall I go on?
---
13.) Again this idea that women can't do physical jobs is silly, they had to do them when men went off to war.
---
Too bad all the good clues are in the wild, only thing that keeps you spade looters happy.
---
The problem is that the developers deliberately pitted pvmers, skillers and pkers against each other, they want PKers to buttfuck unprepared PVMers ripe with loot and they didn't care if it meant people would dislike pkers even more. All though the wildy content they've made is pretty good so I'm not too bothered personally.
---
Try using ancients
---
Use them spellbook swaps wisely
---
Serp helm was +5 before nerf dumbass..
---
As I said, I rarely pk. I'm just not a salt factory who complains about risking nothing doing a clue and dying in the only pvp zone. You deserve to sit kiddo
---
&gt; Then propose a solution that benefits your pker vs pker environment but doesn't affect your pker vs pvmer environment, like changing how Entangle works only on Bounty Hunter worlds.
---
The wilderness is a Pker vs Pker environment.
---
Its balanced, the freeze time shouldnt be cut in half with prot magic.  Prayer is already so fucking broken lmfao
---
Yes. Each item has a slightly different "max" in the log
---
can't disagree with that. it's pretty damn easy
---
Lol, well it won't affect me since I'm not a ranged pure. Just pointing out the lack of common sense in your post
---
Incredibly jealous, good shit man
---
Yeah this dude is a douche bag. 
---
To elaborate a little more, I want to know what's going to be better right now. Tele-alch'ing nets me around 130k xp/hr right now if I continued to do that. However should I start bursting right away? I don't have MM2 done obviously, so I'm not sure if the MM1 tunnels are going to be better XP for me vs the tele alch. I could knock out 70 crafting and do MM2, I didn't realize my stats were so close to doing it. However I wasn't really \*looking\* to do it right away..but if the EXP difference is that big of a gap, then maybe I should go ahead and do that. 
---
Honestly I want 94 pretty bad because I would like to do a little bit of pking before I further level my defense. I kind of want to get some DH'ing in for nostalgia purposes, but I'd rather do this before I get to high of combat. Although I don't care to much about pk'ing anymore, seeing how I'm 75 def already..I switched to PvM when I came back to start playing because the state of PvP just looks quite stale/bad right now.
---
ANYWAYS..main question: burst right away? Keep tele-alching for a few more levels? Or should I bang out the req's for MM2 and burst there if it's that much a difference between the MM1 tunnels. 
---
Ah, the name was so similar I thought it might be you lol.
---
If you want the stronger combat spells, then be in the combat spell book. What's hard to understand about that? Are you saying you don't like being caught out unprepared against a pker because you were trying to kill people that couldn't fight back?
---
&gt; a tber in singles and multi that gets on then gets off so someone with a real spellbook and kill the target.
---
I think that's perfectly fine. If I'm such a shit pker because I don't know how useless teleblock is, then why bother bringing that person along?
---
download a bot and run it for a week straight. boom deleted.
---
Ah alright I see. So Armadyl is kinda like bandos armour then, a very last thing upgrade? I think I’ll stick with blessed d’hide for now before I manage to save up for pegs then arma. Thanks a bunch! 
---
3rd age longsword btw
---
To be fair, this also comes at the cost of losing 9 range attack and 2% ranged strength.. 
---
Do a poll to remove polls and see how that plays out lol.
---
The pk meta is so impenetrable and unforgiving that the community has closed itself off from new entrants.  Like trying to go play counterstrike 1.6 now and just getting headshot ever 4 seconds from people who know just how to tick manipulate well enough to always 3-hit you.
---
That's why pking is dying.  Because the system is rigid and designed by people who barely knew what they were doing a decade ago and the combat level / wilderness depth system is meaningless.  Not because pures can't wear blessed dhide.
---
Well GWD pet drops are 1/5k so you can’t really complain when you get them at 1-2k kc 
---
Game wouldn't exist without pking you should probably respect pvpers a little more.
---
They’re not. Test worlds have 5x normal rates
---
Rs3
---
I would still say just go down the line up with food. So you’d eat a price of pie at a time till it’s fine then move on. 
---
I’m sure with enough community input Jagex would consider it. 
---
I dig the spec the most. Flick prayers on, spec, prayers off 😏
---
Very easy boss that doesn’t need any nerfs. Especially not at the gp/hr it is 
---
You could use the mobile 1-week free trial to go get it, equip it, and then never ever take it off once you're F2P again.
---
Everyone played who cares
---
Wtf, hiding your hobby, what a baby smh my head...
---
Pkers are already at a massive advantage in "no man's land" when it comes to pker vs pvmer combat. they're geared and prepared towards killing someone who's not gonna fight back. How much more do you want?
---
Well combat for one, including an ultimate goal of 80 prayer, for pvp/pvm. Personally i love pvm thats why i recommend that first, plus its just good to level those as theyre pretty 'core' to the game. From there you should look at what content youre more interested in, is it raids, bosses, pvp? Or perhaps are you like me and like to play leisurely for months on end, and then binge for months at a time?  if the first, figure out what specifically it is you want to do and go from there. zul/vork require some quests to do so you need those stats, whereas cerb, thermy, and kraken just require the slayer grind. Raids require more skilling than bosses and is a bit more fulfilling imo. The latter, playing leisurely, is viable for me because ive played for a while and have good skills already. i like to log in and doing farming runs and farming guild, do some birds nest runs, maybe a little slayer and sometimes thats it. other times ill dick around in minigames like castle wars and what not. the trick is to let yourself enjoy it, and let things that you want to do in the game come to your mind organically, because once youre like 'eh i guessssss i could do this for a bit' is when the burning out begins. play for fun, sometimes half the fun is the anticipation and excitement of what is to come
---
It does say he got it twice, and he would have been followed twice...
---
Three more thieving levels and I can do Desert Treasure, and then finish RFD.....man I hate training thieving.
---
That doesn't work either. Lower than level 90 can complete DS2. And there's so many instances where just because you haven't killed it doesn't mean you shouldn't vote in it.
---
Say I'm a lvl 3 skiller who used to have a max main where I had 50k vorkath kills but I got hacked and now play a skiller only. I can't vote on a piece of content that I have intimate knowledge of? 
---
And an update to one of the most popular bosses will have far ranging implications. So if I'm a med level that is killing blue dragons for hides I can't vote on a question that will impact me when more people farm a boss and hide prices drop? That doesn't seem fair.
---
You must have missed where I pvm on my main and use F keys.  Learn to play the game.  It will make you better.  Having a remember autocast is so lazy and the reason they have it separated in pvp proves it's not just some simple qol. 
---
I used about 200-225 tridents / atleast 250m in scales / 40-50m in darts / not sure the other supplies but atleast another 100m in pots/food.
---
good explanation except that bp is 2t and cbow is 5t since you use rapid for both
---
Nice. I got mine from treasure trails. 
---
Look at the polls. you might want to look at your pvm community before blaming pkers. Look at all the tiny changes that aren't passing just because they are aimed at the pvp community. 
---
So, where's the thread?
---
Well hopefully you do soon! Don't get discouraged, this is really a great game!
---
pures choose to have 1 def. If they want armor, they should get 40 def
---
It's under the options for the prayer plugin.
---
You seem to forget that there are a metric fuck ton of players who play the game almost entirely solo.
---
That being said, I agree the clan side of the game could use some TLC.
---
It’s easy without it lol.
---
Then wouldn't a Hunting Shop at Tai Bwo or selling the stick from the General Store be more fitting than it being left on the ground next to where you need it? But you could say the same for anything really. Like should a pickaxe spawn at mines because the locals use the mines or an axe spawn in forest because the locals would cut trees?
---
Oh I agree with that sentiment, maybe for different reasons though. I think it's clear that the game is getting more and more of the runoff from RS3 refugees and they're likely to vote for different things than we initially wanted when OSRS was created. 
---
And, to be clear, I'm not trying to shit on RS3 or RS3 players, but I think it's likely that they like different qualities in a game. I'm not saying that what they like or want is wrong, but clearly it is different than what the original OSRS community wanted.
---
when talking about players killing other players that want nothing to do with PvP it can distort the meaning of "game integrity" ... also I wish everyone would stop using that word so much... it's literally only used to try to push a change to the game through without needing discussion from others that disagree.
---
🤠
---
Splashing to 94 mage with fire strike takes almost 600 hours
---
this, farm seaweed as often as possible and i have like a shit ton of hespori seeds
---
Ah, Gratz on the 99!
---
just give them bronze throwing knives.
---
Exactly
---
The way you worded your comment LITERALLY IMPLIES you did.
---
"The world is a pyramid" is a false statement. This implied you thought my statenent was false. 
---
Dont be so triggered over realising you said something retarded. Just man up and accept it.
---
It does not make you a better player. It does not take skill. It's literally pressing a key on your keyboard. 
---
power of zaros &gt; stupid normal prayer book
---
Since it’s always 50/50, you either get it or you don’t. I’d say if you go 2 or more kills without the drop you want then that classifies as dry.
---
listen I hear you. Differing opinions happen though. I know PvP is in a shit spot and a lot of things that should pass don't. I generally try to vote yes to most of em. Unfortunately some I personally don't prefer.
---
I'm married. I get "laid" damn near everyday. Definitely not lacking anything in that department. Also I have 2 small kids so my life is pretty fulfilling. What I do at work doesn't mean anything about my personal life lmao 
---
I don't see runescape gold as real life value.
---
Yeah I'm aware, both communities are preventing each other from having shit they want. 
---
Look to the right of the picture.
---
Been playing since classic so even if it was it'd be fucking irrelevant. EOC was the worst thing to ever happen to this game. 
---
Due in large part to community involvement, of which polling is a large part. RS3 is what you get when Jagex runs wild.
---
Can't tell if this is bait. Aggressively pushing an agenda is the problem. Forcing companies to hire unqualified women is not the way to go. Allowing them to hire naturally qualified women is what we need and it is happening. Forcing your agenda upon society makes everyone disrespect you. A world where female presidents instate laws that force companies to hire 50% female would be facist. Idk what kind of crack one would have to smoke to make that idea of a world sound appealing.
---
This is probably bait, but if not, it's a great example of toxic feminism. Claiming that men are somehow still the gatekeepers of female success. Build your own legacy. Stop blaming everything on men. Yes, the majority of ceos are still overwhelmingly men. That was explained in my response, though. The number of women ceos is rising and that's all that matters. You are like a child that is impatient. The agenda does not need to be aggressively pushed. All that did was create backlash against feminism so great job creating a generation of young people that cannot identify with feminism anymore. 
---
everyone should be voting no to everything until they take away our ability to vote
---
Because you shouldn't be voting selfishly? The game exists outside of your subjective experience of it. Think about others and the game at large when voting.
---
Get better at the game kids. 
---
Different spellbooks = different spells. There are no correlations between their mechanics other than they both freeze. There are so many flawed arguments.  Vote yes bc why not. But don't say vote yes because Ice barrage freezes. No entitlement on runescape. 
---
You're properly warmed up for first levels of construction.
---
Consistent =/= identical, you cabbage. Nobody said make entangle exactly (or even close to) ice barrage. The issue is that protect from mage affects freeze time inconsistently. Protect from mage vs ancients doesn't change timing. Protect from mage vs regulars does change timing. That's what an inconsistency is. 
---
The point of different spell books is to have different spells, not different mechanics.
---
Why would they be?
---
I’ve never pked a spade in my life fella. I care about fighting other pkers. Why is it a problem to vote yes to something that helps people enjoy the game? 
---
Curses and summoning I wouldn't mind. 
---
If only I could fit all those runes in my inventory. 
---
Yah but standard spellbook isn’t locked behind a quest. Seems like a good trade off?
---
So quick to post for that sweet karma 
---
pvp bad
---
end of story
---
Aaaand time to get some free karma for "I was hacked, how could it possibly happen?"
---
Sorry, I'd usually catch the sarcasm but there's people arguing just about anything in this thread that it's becoming hard to tell. If you put it to a poll on reddit I unironically think your hyperbolic suggestion would have a decent chance of passing or at least getting 50%+.
---
I don't buy the "prey" argument. To use an analogy that another guy used I'm a "rabbit" that's making the conscious decision to enter a den of wolves. It is player vs. player, I'm the one putting myself in the position to get PKed when I do wildy slayer or chins. I know the playerbase will never vote to make wildy riskier, but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to argue that solo PKers(without 99 mage) pose too little of a risk as it stands.
---
Which is part of the skill. If you can't do it effectively to switch attack style then you are limiting yourself and will not be as good.  In all pvp/pvm style keyboard games being able to effectively change spells, prays, etc is part of the skill. 
---
If it is as easy as you make it sound then you would be doing that instead of wanting an ezscape autoremember. 
---
Make a level 90 entangle spell with can’t be blocked  by magic protect 
---
whats the rate on that?
---
That's not the kalphite lair. There's a dungeon just east of the shantay pass, go in there. 
---
What will we do :(
---
thats literally all of osrs
---
I agree with that completely, or at the very least have the teasing stick in someone's house
---
But how is you not hitting vorkath going to let you kill the spawn more easily. 
---
&gt; I just think that telling people to 'research both sides' is a little silly if you're never going to be on the benefiting side anyway.
---
Is it really that silly to want people to make informed votes? I don't understand why that's silly in any way. Why are we trying to embrace being one dimensional...
---
We're going to be left with a very sterile, boring game in a few years after we vote out everything that slightly "annoys" us.
---
same mate, that intro gets me each time 
---
I remember u :) good old times in Leech BA!
---
What a gamble. 
---
no you don't understand pkers voted against something that I wanted so they are toxic and deserve to have every pvp or pure related poll fail with no regard for the merit of the actual question being polled
---
I have a serious follow up question for you then: Why would you say that this change is in the best interest of the game? This is a game mechanic that's been in OSRS since the beginning of 2005, shouldn't there at least be some caution in making such a change?
---
No, its out of spite. Go to the GE and ask people.
---
Nice work man!!
---
-pussyslayer69
---
That is just awkward as hell looking at...Like that just doesn't satisfy me at all no matter how impressive.
---
Stupendous
---
Why does it need to be a level playing field? If you go into the wilderness you know there is a risk of being pked. If you don’t bring gear to fight back then that’s your own fault. There’s a reason there is a warning at the wildy ditch. It makes no sense to cry about getting pked in a pvp area. It’s like speeding through a camera light and complaining about the ticket.

Jokes on you he’s 35 with big tits and a neck beard
---
It is as easy as it sounds. Literally everyone in the game has to do it. Qol =/= "escape" 
---
So? Being an autist wouldnt stop him from calling others autists too.
---
People agree to risk more in arbitrary all the time because killing pures for a G maul over and over again gets boring. They would be used for that as well as just fashionscape.
---
Not sure how it would be a buff to pvmers, snowflake builds maybe? But that affects probably like 100 people in the entire game. 
---
I wouldn't say it's doomed by any means, it's still a long way off from where RS2 sprinted into EOC's clutches. But I will say that if it keeps going like this the whole game will keep shifting away from PvP which is tragic.
---
haha yes
---
If you're dying to a solo PKer then I'm sorry but that's your own fault dude. Teams are a different kettle of fish altogether, but this would buff solo PKers much harder than it would buff teams.
---
I am making this happen
---
gotta cater to the influx of 100iq cretins you know that
---
To be fair remembering autocast is a pretty big change to pvp.  Not having to press an f key and select the spell compared to just reequipping the item and autocasting is big. 
---
Hey quick question can you tell me where I said anything about EOC being preferable please?  Thanks in advance.
---
Yes jagex stated  August 2007 was the only backup they had. I’m saying this is a lie and they most certainly had backups of the game after this but they feared it would compete too strongly with the “main” game.
---
OSRS was expected to fizzle out and die. It was never supposed to have a dev team, never supposed to have new content, support team, etc.  
---
PvPers founded OSRS, on release the strongest PvM content was KBD. We then voted in GWD once it was felt enough players could complete that content 
---
Yeah, games gonna be boring as shit when I don't have to go reselect my spell. 
---
THANK YOU
---
The fuck. This dudes a robot. Tbh I feel bad when i see woox though, I'm a skinny guy too but he's borderline anorexic if not actually. And the back problems he has when he stands. Dudes an absolute legend but I do wish he could be healthier. Didnt mean to stray off topic here, but hes a very young guy (that makes his achievements even more amazing btw) and id hate to see what happens down the road if he doesnt shapen up a bit. 
---
I heard he is a "nice guy"
---
Does lessen the gap though especially since PvP has people using scripts to 1 tick switch barrage.
---
Experienced Pkers still get an advantage since autocasting is slower.
---
Hook it up with 95m all I need to finish tbow ;)
---
If you learn the multi lines then you would realise it's really not as bad as you think, there's non multi routes all over the place aside from super deep wild.
---
Ironic.
---
the whole thread is about people crying that they can't tb + 20 seconds snare to make it easier to kill someone when you have the solution "just use ice barrage"
---
Right. But those rare drops could be moved to a new boss that is outside of the wilderness and much more difficult. I really do think that doing something like that would help the game out a ton. 
---
I think the rev caves worked where the wildy bosses didn't. Its insane money/hr with high risk and people don't get (nearly) as angry when dying there. I think the rev caves are an example of how it was done right and the wildy bosses were not.
---
The entangle update has no effect on those that pk in groups, but has a massive effect on solo pkers not wanting to be limited to 5 chances to kill someone in full hides and bulwark everyday. 
---
It's easy to see the people who comment on this who have very little experience in PVP, and again, have the same vote towards PVP content that I do. 
---
That's fine by me, don't really need em. 
---
No. Pkers are bitching because we represent a tiny portion of the community and the polls require a high majority. That means basically nothing passes. Also saying "they have specified worlds to do pvp" is a lackluster argument. There are also specific places to do pvm, but you chose to go to the wilderness where you could be attacked.
---
&gt;  propose something enticing enough for pvmers to vote on
---
How do you balance anything in PvP if it requires people who don't PvP to approve? The only changes that pass are changes that nerf PvP or items that have uses outside of PvP. Because of the polls, there's no way to properly balance combat. 
---
I love historically accurate games!
---
Go and PK for yourself and then check if it is balanced. You’re stating a strong opinion on something you said you know nothing about (literally in the first sentence). The two cannot compete with each other in a 1v1 fight.
---
I'm calling you a sperg because you've been using reddit actively for 7 years.
---
Nope... you’re basicly the retard here... you spouting a bunch of words and believing in yourself won’t suddenly make all the shit you’re spewing any more true
---
I'm 4800kc dry for kree pet what the actual fuck
---
Pures should be real happy about this one. fuck 2 defence. 
---
I mean statistically yes but it's effectively negligible. It takes 30 prayer bonus to extend your prayer duration by 100% (so if you drain 1 point per 10s it becomes 1 point per 20s).
---
If you have 0 pray bonus +1 will extend your prayer by 3.33%. If you have prayer bonus even less, so with a glory and whatnot you'll be seeing your prayer last around 3% longer, which doesn't matter as a pure because you should never be prayer gated with how fast fights go, unless you're bringing in like 2 dose ppots or something.
---
It's really only a buff to pures who like to dps at gwd since it lets you be a bit more flexible with the gear you bring.
---
It’s all I’ve seen today. 
---
Its also it isnt what I wanted because this is the osrs community
---
It still increases the current melee max hit from what it is currently, whether it's a revert or not lol. That's a buff.
---
What does RWT stand for? I know what it is, just not what it means
---
Tbh I'm not sure. I'd bet on him moving but he might not. I've only done mage arena 2 once on my main. Got all 3 kills the first time. Sorry i can't help more:(
---
LOL

LMFAO

HAHAHAHAHAH

You're never going to get pure/pk updates, sorry. :(  Always &lt; 75%.

Just so people know this is just a satire post... Don't take everything you see on the internet literally 
---
I dno I've still seen plenty of rage posts on getting pked at revs. So much entitlement on some of these pvmers. 
---
About defence capped worlds what happens if I over level? Do I get auto dced? Iron man and such will have an incentive to stay low defence to access shops and training spots not filled with other people, a capped world of such shouldn't exist sadly..  I'm down for a good pvp update to revisit my pure, but I just don't see it happening. 
---
You kissed 89 frogs?

🆗

No, you're just an idiot lol

Hmm. I might just buy one of these even if I don't play mobile. Kinda neat. 
---
Who?
---
Ruskiy
---
because pvp content should be players killing other players not forcing people into the wildy that dont want to be there.
---
Everyone like who? How far into the wilderness are you going that a pure is more dangerous than a 60 atk Piety account or a main?
---
And are you implying that the +1 prayer bonus will help a pure pk you?
---
Real world trading
---
Because a solo pker on normals even with this buff would be easier to deal with than a pker on ancients with a friend/alt tber.
---
If you knew the history of why 2007scape came back I think you would understand why a lot of people feel that way. It doesn't sound like you played much pre EOC either.

No i don't. 
---
100% agree. It will always be pvp content getting shit on until pvm isn't in the wilderness. And I've said this in the past and the general consensus is that is easy scape indicating pkers want pvmers to kill. So kind of a stalemate. Pkers want easy free kill and to have buffs for that. Pvmers don't want to get pked but still want access to the pvm content. Nerf the drops and move the shit out of the wildy, problem solved.

Killing him isnt a problem. It just took so long to find him that I had no food/brew pots left. But I was poisened by a spider got him to 10% health then died
---
Train crafting, you'll need the levels for onyx/zenyette anyways.
---
Okay, bye mongoloid.

---
A slippery slope that our once beloved game took, and now it's RS3, not saying that would happen here, but the 'leaving behind PVPers' is what started the decline in RS3.

So this is the power of Ultra Autism?
---
Which means pkers are more likely to run into each other, regardless of what reddit may tell you most pkers want to fight other pkers they deem to be weaker than them rather than some kid in veracs. 
---
Preventing people from receiving enjoyable updates and forcing them to continue playing the same stale content they have been playing for years can be considered ruining the game for them. Imagine if there were no new pvm updates since God Wars. The game would get stale and people would quit.
---
The d'hide poll doesn't matter for the people who are voting No. That means they should be selecting the "SKIP QUESTION" option. Since once again, letting pures have a higher risk in pvp and allowing them to look nicer does not negatively impact the experience of any player that isn't a pure.
---
Voting "No" on this poll is specifically voting to make sure that people who like pure pking don't get to have as much fun as they potentially could be having. There is literally no other reason to vote "No" on this.
---
That's fair. Just personally talking with friends/clanmates I interact with, the ones who don't PvP generally hate PvP'ers because of wildy bosses and whatnot. Every seems to have a story of trying to kill Callisto/Venenatis for 2 hours and they died 8 times.
---

---
That is comedy. I managed to miss the original post somehow.. I'm lolling
---
Unfortunately IQ only measures certain aspects of cognitive ability related to logical reasoning and pattern recognition, so someone with high IQ (such as myself) could just as easily make poor voting decisions.
---
Seems like a fun idea. 
---
Yeah, that was another point he made. I didn't respond to that point, because like everyone basically else, I am in favour of hiding polls result. 
---
Side note, if there is a 'bandwagon' of following the previous votes, that only strengthens the likelihood the result (pass/fail) wont change after the first 30 minutes, not the opposite as you appear to be indicating.
---
Because I would like to see a reason to use other spellbooks than ancients? A tradeoff of 20s freeze and 30+ damage vs teleblock and 15s freeze with 0 damage is a fair tradeoff IMO. As it sits right now, there is no reason to use the standard spellbook if you're solo pking. 
---

Implying that doing incredibly repetitive tasks for hours a day for 5+ years isn't also indicative of autism.
---
I’ll never be half as good at anything in life as that guy is at this damn game..... 
---
Voting no doesn't do anything since the Pk community is in the minority. Tweet at the JMods regularly about this instead of silently voting no.
---
Stacked shit that high is the winning phrase
---
*Unique*
---
No actually I’m pretty sure removing wildly killed PvP there
---
No shops then, honestly nothing matters except being able to kill other players in those worlds, there are no need for shops either. Good point though, because I'm not an ironman, I had not thought of that. 
---
What's the wildy? Is that the place meant for players to be able to kill other players. Ohhhh that's right ur retarded and got salty because someone killed you :/ aww poor thing 
---
Women are weaker than men meh
---
Pking is already good, hence why lots of people avoid the wildy completely
---
You'll vote for buffs cause you gain from it and I'll vote no because ill lose, i dont need to pk to be effected by pking
---
That's accurate, yeah.  
---
Oh but don't forget that I still get updates I want and you don't.
---
I never noticed the sound cues. Dang. 
---
20%*
---
My friend will not play mobile because he's convinced that 80% of the player count consists of bots, and that the game is dead. He used to play rs2. Even new players know that bots aren't real people, counterintuitively making the world feel even emptier since you don't end up talking to the real players
---
EOC in general was basically straight kill along with some other changes that basically made pures useless. 
---
the fuck is wrong with you
---
What is this fuckery?
---
your just making your case worse lmao surely you see it
---
You're missing inventory space from all those runes you are carrying 
---
yeah but it's a t75 helm while nezzy is t50. 
---
Yeah that's what I think too. Or even make a new boss and give it all of the old drops at 10X the rates. I think both sides would heavily benefit from it.
---
This thread is being invaded by RS3 players lol
---
It's pointless to argue here
---
Thanks for the feedback :) I will send you the kickstarter link and feel free to share the post 😁 I  mostly use it on PC too, it is so much better having your left hand resting on your laps while bossing.

**Results From 10 Hours of Sulliuscep**
---
Hello and welcome back to another data log! As always if you've got any suggestions for things you'd
---
like to see drop me a line. The stats: 
---
- Starting Stats: 71 Woodcutting 
---
- Finishing Stats: 78 Woodcutting 
---
**Key Stats - Total / Hour**
---
- Experience - 793k / 79.3k 
---
- Supply Cost - 50k / 5k 
---
- Mushrooms cut - 6240 / 624 
---
**Summary**
---
- Alot easier to do then it looks, especially with a house pool 
---
- Fantastic woodcutting xp semi-afk 
---
- Profit neutral / minor profit if you bank everything [not worth it imo] 
---
- Overall the best method for people who hate tick manipulation to train woodcutting 
---
If you don't understand why teleblock is powerful than use ancients? Normal spellbook doesn't need an ice barrage equivalent.
---
If you were a *reeeeal* player, you'd know!
---
I've had this exact sentiment about the game mode for a long time now. Support.
---
You guys are so cool bashing someone who plays the game at their own pace. Get jobs.
---
No. The absolute irony in this comment lol. You don't even know what you're talking about.   You think BH is a good way to introduce people to pvp??? It's notorious for attractimg the best of the best.
---
Pvp world's are much better for introducing people to pvp since you get to choose who you fight more freely.
---
And f2p already has that so no need for bh if that's your only point 
---
I just call it as I see it, Woox kills 6 jads and suddenly there's like 15 posts about it on here from different people all within like 30mins lol
---
I always put the broad interests of the game ahead of my own selfish interests when voting. I hold the entire community to this same standard and consider anyone who doesn't abide by it to be massive cunt.
---
having the amulet would entice me to bring a better weapon with ko potential. making me risk more.  but your brainlet mind can't even think about that, can it?
---
It's like 1/5k. Stop complaining until you're well over the drop rate. 
---
Don't ember and you'll make it through fine.
---
I'm just in doubt that is going to happen because it's been like this since long before EOC. It's just over time there are less pvpers because there have been so many updates in the entirety of runescape that has been antipvp. 
---
It's because people vote for what will benefit them rather than what is fair for the game, PvMers will benefit from serpantine buff but won't benefit from lower blessed dhide requirements.
---
I don't play rs3. I said I have an rs3 max combat account, which I completed before rs3 was a thing.
---
How much a month you get for disability? In all seriousness this is a crazy achievement, well done
---
I haven't voted yet at all actually. Haven't been on all week. But those sort of assumptions are kinda case in point. 
---
You don't know what I do or don't know. 
---
the point of those updates is to bait pvmers and goldfarmers into the wildy so pkers can kill them
---
How about just voting on shit you're informed on instead of what makes it easier for yourself? Ddosing isn't solvable, single pking in large groups existed before you knew what rs was, extortion (assuming you're talking about rot and the 2200 worlds shit) doesn't even effect 99.9% of the player base and is easily counter-able whenever people decide to stop being plebs and trying to play the game alone, the rest idk what you're talking about.
---
Suggestions from players, form into polls made by the developers. You’re literally making a suggestion that has nothing to do with gameplay, but rather the mechanics of the polling system. BYE. Lol.
---
It adds nothing to difficulty though. most of the time it doesn't time out to affect you anyway because of distance or the way the ticks line up. It really isn't a nerf to vorkath. I just see it as qol.
---
I believe the dude is a real player, he is just glossing over everything that has happened and condensing it into a meme. 
---
TBI can be severe or minor. TBI often results in bleeding and swelling of brain tissue and sometimes will push the brain stem into your spinal cord and kill the victim.

Exactly my thoughts. This change does absolutely nothing and I'm having trouble understanding why it's such a big deal that it's not passing (besides of course the whole 'reeee spite voting' argument, which really just comes across as 'if you don't agree with me you're just a bitter PvMer'). It feels as if it was included just so they can say 'hey look we included some PvP QoL changes!' seeing as most of the other polled changes are PvM-related.
---
If we get this skill, we won't see another new skill for years, if we ever even do. Don't let this be it. 
---
No, it's the definition. 
---
It sad but I'm guessing it's always just been the majority thing. Why spend time appeasing 20% when u can please the other 80. Shit way to look at it but that's what's happened.
---
Holy fuck I never thought about doing that at WT
---
Stop AFKing the most profitable solo boss in rs
---
Thats because OPs post was set up poorly. He made an incredibly weak argument, pretty much a strawman, to sway over easy opinions. It allowed the top posts pointing out that tb might be a large reason for entangle being weak to take over the post.
---
That sounds so boring though. I guess if you have shit ping or a fossilized PC, this would benefit you.
---
But nah no support.
---
You mean a rims?
---
I like the part that even if you could go back and tell your old self you most likely wouldn’t have believe it. I was thinking the same exact thing. This is turning into an awesome thread with awesome past experiences 
---
We can't have pure getting too OP with that +1 prayer bonus. There absolutely no other reason for this change
---
/s
---
Exactly, wilderness rejuvenation was designed on bringing non PVP playerss back into the wilderness, **because a majority of players don't care about PVP** but jagex still wanted to provide updates that benefit PVPers.
---
I think it's funny that the PVPers arguing about not getting enough updates can't even agree on what kind of updates they want. Some want to nerf range, some want to strengthen standard mage and nerf ancients. Some want new weapons, some don't because they're afraid of power creep. No fucking wonder all the PVP updates are focused on PVM and Skilling in the wilderness
---
I’d love to add the moron who wanted better equipment for pures today to this conversation. 
---
NOWWWWWW I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

FREEEEE FALLIN'!!

Been thinking for a while now we need an actual bow to use that's not 1.5k or 1.15b that's good for more than just spec.
---
it's really not. Its a built in function of your computer and makes you look like a fucking idiot for not doing it.
---
Oh yeah just risk more lol
---
Right, and they were put there to be more rewarding for the risk of being able to be pked.

I read it as 'there's only been 400 votes, so the current result doesn't hold much merit' (emphasis on his use of 'only') but 'then you remember poll results aren't hidden so it will be bandwagoned and the result (pass/fail) wont change'.
---
I was just responding to that first point.
---
Olm however is not scaled at all by combat. Only the rooms, which make up a small fraction of your team's total points, are made slightly and not noticeably easier

I hate watching a stream and theyre on edge like 1 comment from losing it. Lmao i cant stand it

Blue blunt and monocle
---
No plz, I don't change mine 
---
Maybe 2 people are stronger than 1, idk.
---
Generally speaking, on reddit, yeah the vast majority of pvmer responses ive seen to these bitch fests have been pretty respectful. They try to explain what they don't like about the update and get met with "ur just mad about ur spade." I dont think you know what a meme is.
---
The people making the posts haven't been setting a flair so they've been getting auto-deleted after 15mins it seems.

His spinal cord was displaced and had to be fused with pins in order for him to not paralyse him I believe? He was pretty high up there like they called it extremely severe he had amnesia for like 6 weeks but he didn’t die fortunately

Well it used to be way closer and there were no polls then. Clanning was huge. Lots of people pked or were learning to pk. Varrock wild and multi were packed.  People actually pked around black knight fortress south of bandits, people bridded other pkers at west drag, etc.  It was a beautiful time. Even large fights in pvp worlds occurred in multi. Eventually though shit led to EOC and ezscape and pvmers/jamflex essentially killing what is now rs3. A lot of pvpers are pissed bc osrs came back due to what was about to be a mostly pvp private server and yet we still get shit on. Right out the bat with polls and tb not being f2p a lot of people just said fuck it. 
---
On range? 20mish from 84. Magic, not sure, maybe 5m? My alch s are mostly free but the stuns cost money. 
---
You misspelled "I'm a pussy" wrong.
---
Have you ever picked up Blue Dragon Scales off the ground
---
the can add back revs like rs2 for all i care
---
WOOP WOOP das da soun da police 
---
I'm indifferent about them and voted yes because I like my hard clues being worth more.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Holy crap autistic much 🤣🤣🤣
---
I am saying that the osrs team should take over and not let the community drive content towards PvMscape with no pvp and always adding stuff to make skilling easier
---
I didn't vote on it but I would have voted no in the hopes that with a higher defense req the blessed dhide wouldn't be nerfed as much as black dhide when those balancing changes come through. Would be a nice intermediary gear set between black dhide and armadyl
---
I laughed way too hard at this 😂😂
---
Also btw im actually in favor of this poll and will be voting yes even though i don't pvp at all. you guys deserve good updates as much as the rest of us.
---
What would your ideal new skill be? Not criticism but genuinely curious as to what you would like to see. 
---
Interesting idea.
---
It would fit into the lore pretty well too given how many different demons get summoned in diff quests.
---
Support.
---
Honestly would love regular high alch to be changed how alching works with the explorer ring 
---
Sorry, speaking as an Ironman there.
---
yikes
---
There is no way black dhide would be nerfed, the mods understood that from the chats reaction the second they brought it up
---
Bad attempt at trolling mate
---
Didn't get anything either eh? I don't even think I popped a balloon lmao. Was fun seeing all that shit in the chest though. 
---
How is that even possible. Inferno is way easier that 6 jads. 
---
the games 6 years old now. people just tb and log onto their other accounts (watch a torvesta vid, and hes just a mainstream pker). it would be nice that if the vets didn't have this pay2win advantage (technically paying for 2 memberships). 
---

I think this is supposed to be sarcasm but I can't tell. 
---
Lol did you see the spec,definitely going be a like 300m bow for sure ,this will be op in PVP 
---
Macron by the end of this year
---
Trouble brewing actually seems like a really fun minigame. I decided to learn it with my 20minutes. I think it would be cool to have 2 teams actually battle it out.
---
They added the open/close option to 1 type of loot pouch. It should've been added to all of them at the same time. Herb sack, seed box, etc.
---
No matter what any mother fucker says you’re a God
---
Uhm.. you know that's literally how all dhide other than the God ones are right?
---
Just please, screen shot on you computer, I am beggin you.
---
Tardersauce..
---
+1 pray. So much better. 
---
Well, it increases the skill gap. Those that can pray flick effectively will be rewarded even more in a PVP scenario
---
Doesn't that help the idea that it's not being bandwagoned? The fact that so many people skipped the Vorkath question indicates people were reading the questions and decided they were indifferent, not just going with the current result.
---
Glad some one else is with me here.
---
Vorkath is amazing money and is already easy. 
---

---
just to support your points, take a look at the clan/pking section compared to the rest on zybez lol, pretty sure that only goes back to around 2008 also, pvp was bigger than half of these retards can even imagine.
---
Probably because of some spineless kids picking on him instead of building him up in middle school.
---
I agree id love a new BIS helm to come from something else but i guess it was just easier for them to satisfy demand by just reverting serp helm to +5
---
As someone with an untrimmed mining cape, can confirm. Autistic as fuck.
---
I can tell if you are being serious....
---
Allows you to gap or stand under then attack. 
---
put your Game chat on "Filtered" 
---
Are you praying mage? Do that then switch to prot melee at 25%.
---
Well barrage is locked behind Desert treasure and requires 94 mage, so not at all comparable to entangle.
---
But regardless, you seem to simply be comparing entangle and barrage. When in reality it's entangle, teleblock, and even fire surge compared to barrage. Emphasis on teleblock because that's essentially what the entire entangle debate is about. PvPers are mad they can't have long freezes and TB.
---
It would be a togglable option just like Varrock, Camelot, ect. I dislike it, cause when the portal/teleport came out. I grinded for hours getting the x1000 needed for the Nexus portal. Only for it to take you atop of Ttollhiem. Which is great, but I assumed if it was a Trollheim teleport, it would've been fire runes/laws not the new salts. 
---
Yes I am
---
His own fault!!!
---
GTFO
---
I guess go back to rs3 then. 
---
Accomplishmentism
---
You sound obese bro maybe focus less on runescape and focus more on not eating so much
---
That’s so garbage.. fuck those ppl like go fuck yourself lol
---
Sonoma here, I've found my people.  Also worth mentioning I played for the Petaluma River Cats in middle school :P
---
Its prob easier knowing you're not wasting time just doing the 6 jads. Nothing to gain or lose. Actual inferno comes and nerves fuck you up
---
so you'd be okay with there being armor only people with 40 def and under are wearing? Because like you said, you chose to be 99 def. 
---
Saying pures shouldn't get updates is like saying ironman shouldn't get updates or noobs shouldn't get updates because every1 should be a 126 maxed main. 
---
The wording of your comment makes it sound like you want to get rid of polls lol
---
Update isn’t even in game yet?
---
I literally cant fathom why this was downvoted lol 
---
What's your gear?
---
Peak rigging
---
Tied to dragon slayer and defence. 
---
you know a lot of us pkers hate those fuckers too right? the ones that just win by pure numbers
---
At zilany with raids gear getting a hydra claw named saradomin hilt and named bandos boots in the chat with a minimap of the grand exchange
---
You summon things! Like demons to fight or bosses!
---
 You can also get extra xp for a time! More resources!
---
Get blessing for strength or att or defense like +5 for a time, give gear some extra bonus. idk man put some thoughts into it.
---
The serp helm got nerfed in the first place tho and it made it obsolete. That's why people want it back to +5 strength. 
---
Got a jad task for the first time after my fire cape. im 99 range with rigour, should I bother bringing a rune dart switch? Also what brew/restore/range pot combo do you guys bring? 
---
Lol troll? Just filter you chat. Why do people always run to reddit before even trying to solve their problem? 
---
blessed dhide compared to normal dhide: it's very expensive dhide with identical stats to the fucking normal version of dhide but has 1 prayer.
---
Lol 
---
Hold on. That means that the coal must be coming from somewhere else. Something is generating the coal. But where?
---
Go back to rs3 then. 
---
Explain further please
---
Not sure. Probably finished his goals and time to move on. Happened to me back in 07/08. Maxed my range tank and got bored. 
---
I see a neck beard player tipping fedora and saying I’ll buy mi’lady
---
I like to use the "hide" option
---
0000FF
---
its better than black dhide, just barely but it is better. so it would help pking, if ever slightly. and even if it didnt help pking, its stupid to remove the defence req anyways. it makes no sense that regular black dhide chaps and vambs have no defence req, i would vote to add that not even as a spite vote. thats just logical
---
&gt;most pvmers do clues
---
false. and even if they did, oh no, we lost a few thousand gp per clue on average. worth it for salty pker tears
---
lol...
---
You would claim the account as hijacked to force it offline i think
---
I’m sorry for your loss
---
I just want the spite voting to end.
---
thanks greatly appreciate the feedback! only wish this wasnt downvoted so fast and people actually cared to voice opinion :/
---
Thats not my point. This change would not by any means make normal spellbook rival ancients in pvp. It would just be ever so slightly better to create more variety.
---
Yeah I guess the newer players who just started think PKing is fun and worthwhile, especially if their mobile Youtube app keeps recommending to them Torvesta videos. 
---
Most guys I talk to who have played as long as I have (years+) consider PKing to be an absolute waste of time.  We tend to think the PVP mechanics are too stale and/or it's too hard to actually get a kill.  I think both.  PKing on a main is pretty dumb and involves more chance than anything. PKing on a pure is fun because the low defense makes gear switching/mechanics actually useful, and it also means you're more likely to correctly execute stacks of damage.
---
We kill cows and chickens and no one blinks an eye. Double standards at the finest
---
How about you uhhh go fuck your mother
---
you cant balance it. there will always be meta. 
---
And actually, past 50 combat, the combat level is a pretty good indicator. A pure at 70 combat will have higher K0 power than a normal account, but that normal account will almost always outlast the pure in a DM. it's just runescape pvp isn't structured around Death matches, so it benefits the pures. also the pures will have generally put in 1000+ hours into the game at 70 combat, while normal accounts will have only put in about 100 to get where they're at which is pretty disadvantageous. Stick that noob from a normal account on a pure and have him battle that pure on the normal account, the pure on the normal account is going to win every time. 
---
Settled is that you?
---
He voted no out of principle, because it’s not a fucking QoL. It’s not retarded to vote no to meta changing updates, when it’s a month dedicated to **QOL** updates. There’s no other way to express your opinion, so what else can you do? 
---
Full d armor(chain) with zerker and tz shield
---
its more like you Jumbabwe fucking your own mom :)
---
As a pure i think being able to wear blessed d hide will feel out of place since it’s always had a defence requirement, im fine with just black chaps
---
Fyi i you havent recieved barrows gloves as a drop yet its because you needa talk to Jorral at the outpost north of Ardy and he will tell you that the weird brown gloves your character has been automatically discarding at barrows are actually powerful barrows gear!
---
Edit: if the text doesnt appear as one of Jorral's options that means you havent "received" them as a drop yet. Your character mustv'e rolled to get barrows gloves at least once before this will work or else the brown gloves option wont appear.
---
So summoning
---
Start off in lumbridge/draynor, have a set list of goals to complete. Once completed i can unlock one adjecent area at a time (rimmington/falador, varrock or the desert). Continue in this manor until all of map unlocked/all goals complete ;) have fun, enjoy the vid if you watch let me know your thoughts!
---
That extends further than this game tho, people fall for dumb scams all the time.   Especially credit card scams 
---
the pk clients already hide and resize the spell icons and it's not really fair.
---
Nope. It sounds like I'm saying they shouldn't poll this because it's a waste of time. It should simply just be added.
---
You don't take damage from the regular hydras on the way
---
this post is just a continuous what the fuck ? 
---
Snakeskin at 30, studded leather at 20, hard leather at 10. The bodies require def, the chaps do not. Hard leather chaps currently do not exist.
---
No, it's not like saying that at all. Pures intentionally limit themselves at have low def; armor requires def therefore low def players should be limited to low tier armor. Metal armor already has def requirements for 10, 20, 30, 40, etc... why should range be any different.
---
Nope
---
Ya, I destroyed his entire life.
---
Is that actually slayermusiq
---
Again, nothing to do with gameplay. That’s out of reach for us. Lol. We can’t make suggestions out of the realm of gameplay dude. 
---
What a well thought out response, I appreciate the input
---
You're not getting the anology... 
---
The necklace makes sense. It's just stupid. But I really dont care about whether or not it's in the game so I would SKIP the vote instead of voting no just because I don't like it or spite.
---
theres something wrong with this pic but i cant put my finger on it
---
Well we can definitely rule out reproduction here
---
bruh i've seen pures use black d hide chaps g just for swag, and they wear those 50k-150k tt hats all the time lol. Yes, 9/10 pures wont bother, but theres so many pures that you will be pking blessed chaps.
---
it's mainly a buff to clue scrollers who get blessed chaps as a reward. 
---
Haters will say it's fake
---
Aren’t we past writing out that a comment is sarcastic 
---
As a PVM'er I am usually against the idea of disabling people from voting if they don't meet specific requirements. 
---
I think it is disingenuous to think that a person doesn't understand a piece of content because they do not have the level on that account, or haven't done it before. Also I see it as a way to sneak something past our 75% threshold that has kept the game integrity mostly intact. It has worked really well.
---
That being said for issues regarding PVP I do not mind it being locked behind kills, because unlike most content it takes some actual experience to understand the core mechanics and what is being changed.
---
You want a cookie oh great bastion of morality?
---
Yes, lets make the most underpowered combat style more underpowered. Balance.
---
I understand that as authenticator delay is still not a thing and I still think the best ideas for these issues is to keep it as topics as discussion although they can choose to ignore them there might be a time they decide to make the changes we desire. 
---
Nice try, but it is were not. Were it not for the fact that you think you’re right about this you might have thought before trying to correct something that is right.
---
RS3 is that way 
---
It still does have the BIS KO wep doesnt it? Able to 1 tick an 83 or whatever the max hit is now with very high accurancy, nothing else as far as im aware can match that.
---
How the fuck is disabling mining a better solution than making a chump throw rocks lmao
---
I wanna be tracer
---
&gt; should I bother bringing a rune dart switch? 
---
No. 
---
&gt; Also what brew/restore/range pot combo do you guys bring?
---
2 ranging potions, 8 brews, the rest is super restores. 
---
Or if you're confident replace the 8 brews with 2 brews and 8 anglerfish.
---
happy cake dayy
---
Yeah  I always say the wild just not pvp it's pking
---
People aren't really going there to fight each other. It's always a hunter vs prey, someones always just getting killed, not fighting.
---
I don't see this as fun for either side, and it's created this wild where people are only after your items. Everyone's just trying to trick someone out of their +1s or kill them for their pvm loot.
---
It's led to a very toxic pking community and it's something that most of us want to avoid.
---
Lmao boty jest
---
I'd suggest to try using all offensive armor if you can, since the flail has terrible melee stats. obsidian / bandos / dragon defender / etc. Otherwise you might need to get 70 def and get torags
---
I think the guy on the bottom literally headbutted his keyboard to get a username. 
---
The “ its the same bonus as black d hide” argument isn’t very good. There’s plenty of items that pures can use that have defensive stats like steel plate body or black full helm. 
---
Oh nope, I had not read them. Okay thanks!
---
Do I let them go? Fuck no, you enter the wilderness accepting all risks. If I was that hardcore I'd be slaughtered, so if I dont do it, someone else will. 
---
Read and vote. 
---
how long do table items last mate ?
---
That’s like if the bgs needed to be nerfed they decided to nerf dragon war hammer instead to even it out
---
DP? I’d be down for that. 
---
Hadn't read them yet thanks.
---
This comment is just pure rage lolol
---
It's not like the ban will happen overnight. Most of the time, it's done in ban waves. What would be nice is if you got a notification if action was placed against a player you reported. League does this. 
---
Pssshh I got 99 def and Slayer at lvl 30 preeoc, using soulwars and xp lamps
---
Oh nice so I only have 7 seconds to cast 1 spell then I have to wait 3 seconds for another entangle to be able to cast again?! That’s so viable! 
---
Yea I don't know, but It is reset and I can complete it again. Kind of a cool thing to have.
---
There is not a specific sequence I thought.  They attack on different ticks but you need to listen or look at each of the 6 as they are doing their attacks to determine the prayer.  It isn't just mage mage range mage range, rinse and repeat. 
---
You may have meant that but wanted to clarify.
---
Well he used blood barrage along with max gear which makes it possible
---
Its not pray flicking. Anyone running camps pray mage, so its not a skill thing
---
lol no it shouldnt it has been like that forever and it almost defines low level pures. changing it because "it doesnt make sense" without acknowledging gameplay is just plain stupid.
---
and it mostly gives an offensive range bonus anyways and if you look closely your quiver is actually on the legs so maybe it DOES make sense
---
he's still using osbuddy
---
&gt; You missed my point. You were using an incorrect argument for why it should be polled.
---
Fair point, I did misread your comment.
---
&gt; I disagree, its what defines the upper bracket of skilled players.
---
It does now because content was been designed around it. The inferno almost requires you to prayer flick otherwise you'll run out of prayer before Zuk. But if it was just discovered today most people would simply see it as a bug where you don't lose prayer points.
---
&gt; That isn't an argument, its a statement.
---
And?
---
&gt; It becomes an issue when the majority of the playerbase is voting to harm parts of the game.
---
Not true. The OSRS would never allow that opportunity to arise. For things affecting small communities, they're generally only polled after getting a good consensus from that community. Thus other players can't vote on any poll that harms them. And maybe PvPers should try not being the most toxic pieces of shit possible and the rest of the community would support them. By far the worst community in OSRS.
---
Lol, trash trying to make a dollar. Yes, we will risk losing our accounts instead of buying them legit through Jagex. Idiots....
---
You too man, try to stay dry!
---
GG
---
Just gonna leave this here https://redd.it/a4chv3
---
Ffs how much free time do you all have? Like seriously? I have a full time job and fuuuuck, even on a non ironman account its going to take me like 5 years to max..
---
All that arm muscle is pushed into those sexy abs.
---
Prob bot farm
---
I remember having to get a queen kill for the kandarin hard diary and having every public team quit after just a few waves. I got tired of resetting so I bought a leech queen kill instead. Holy shit you guys are amazing! Just watching everyone communicate with numbers and getting everything done was awesome. I think the team that was formed for me got a queen kill in 10 min, not even. I'm grateful for the service you guys provide.
---
why you liein
---
100% will be in my hoarding only Ironman YouTube series.
---
uhhhhh you seem confused
---
Peak ddosser. 
---
Doesn't he have to understand how combat works to know that how pures work?
---
He's not saying a lot of the shit you're accusing him of, he's just saying combat level should reflect effectiveness. The level up system is extremely flawed and pures are just accounts taking advantage of the flaws and pushing them to the max
---
Just to clarify, he voted 'NO' not 'should serp helm get buffed'. He did not vote 'NO' to 'are these quality of life changes?' But he submitted his answer as if he actually had voted 'NO' to 'are these quality of life changes'. Hopefully I laid that out for you clearly enough so you can wrap your brain around how that's retarded.
---
You can deal 500 damage to zulrah, a high level boss monster, in about 1 minute with solid gear.
---
Now tell me you could do that on another player who isn't a pure. 
---
I have so many questions. 
---
losing accounts? Would pay 15$ instead of paying like 3-4 mills? Nice logic, good luck with that
---
I bet mommy gets you everything you want
---
I don't even know where to begin 
---
They are artificially adding large amounts of wealth to the economy 
---
That's bad.  Imagine if we just printed out a shit ton of money and gave it to everyone
---
Absolutely 
---
You're a fucking neanderthal. If mobile gets a massive qol buff, turns out to be a good thing, you're going to sit on your ass and quote this one line for the rest of your fucking pathetic life?
---
"I just want money."
---
Dude you got two coin drops.
---
If Dps was high against players then you would be eating A LOT more. Fights would go super fast because a lot more KO opportunities would occur or people would run out of food. 
---
Sounds neat.
---
Shut up! We aren't you even speak of that sword!
---
Honestly, the most relevant use case is when you're using ruby bolts and you take like 10 damage from the proc while vorkath takes none.
---
That poor Pewdiepie.
---
Update its not big deal if it passes otherwise REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE voting no on every pvm poll btw. 
---
6.6 mill in almost 180 kills idk if that’s pretty successful 
---
Lmao, what?
---
"Standard is shit, tangle spells need a buff."
---
"Here's a great idea, let's buff ancients and that will solve the issue."
---
looks nice i would raise my children here
---
True, no ramp for you to cross the wildy ditch.
---
Make it hard enough so that I can't afford to? Like what kind of complaint is that lmao.
---
Depends on the level of course, but it's not always the best dps.
---
To counter this, I voted yes because I would hope god d'hide would rise in price and make clues a little more rewarding.
---
Wow not one but two rusty swords!!!
---
in addition to what u/zyean said, reg magics requires minimum 7 runes while ancients requires 3, and if you use kodai then you can even bring soul runes to blood barrage. 
---
it's just a losing battle vs someone of the same skill every time minus a lot of RNG luck. Having to land freezes and hits separately really is a major tank in DPS. also if you ever have the opponents on the ropes, you have to sacrifice tangling them to deal dps and risk them running away whereas barrage u just barrage. 
---
Salty over a joke on Reddit? Guess I shouldn't expect much from the PvP community.
---
I don't know why but that almost made me cry. gg feels grats on the cape.
---
Oh oops. I included the magic thing. Ignore that. 
---
As a pker i am amazed at the complete lack of knowledge about the usage of spells in pvp on this thread. Ill make a few things clear.
---
1. Ancients always wins over normals. Always. This update wont change that.
---
2. Fire surge is trash. So is entangle. And they will remain trash even with these updates, but they will be slightly less trash.
---
3. Magic is already at a point where its barely worth using in a deathmatch, because of the way mage defence works in osrs and updates like augury (which actually made barrage more inaccurate rather than more accurate!). Halve freeze time of ancient spells and magic will be irrelevant.
---
4. The variety of normal spellbook does not mean that "highly skilled pkers" can use it to their advantage. There is only one useful spell on normals in pvp and that is teleblock. The rest are utterly useless.
---
5. This update is already a thing in DMM, and it did wonders to the normal spellbook fights. It made it possible to kill people without ancients while still keeping ancients far, far better. AKA it has already proven to work out fine.
---
The tip almost twinkles.
---
Id be more inclined to kill them knowing they dropped red bones, apposed to the generic white ones.
---
Dontcha mean always come out at the bottom
---
I’m gonna vote yes because it makes it equal to the other variation of the same item. I agree that the chaps should have a def requirement but they don’t so why vote no to it?
---
??? He legit explained it in the most simple terms, even expressing dps as actual numbers to show you can't out dps healing
---
lets change the meta, pking, and alienate part of our player base for the sake of consistency!
---
This task was insane and took me around 10 hours
---
&gt;Again, risk vs reward.
---
Yeah, I'm not opposed to having this risk vs reward, I'm in favor of it actually.
---
Most PKers, when killing most Ironmen will have no risk. Most Ironmen won't have an alt there for looting (and even if they did, the alt will see the loot at the same time as the pker) and, at that point why not have your alt just pk the guy instead?
---
The thing is, most Ironmen won't have an alt set up for wilderness content.
---
Green dragons are about to be extinct
---
Thanks.
---
yeah that was a myth people spread so you would try ice blitzing in duel arena stakes and give the people who camped it odds. 
---
Id rather have one making sense than neither
---
That's fair, but guthix and zaros will always be cheaper than the rest, and it will make getting blessed chaps better as a clue reward.
---
Gatekeeping, accessibility is important, updates effect all players.
---
And next, the world.
---
Sometimes you gotta think that it don't be that but then you really think if it like it do and then you realise that sometimes it really just does be like that.
---
Forgot to list total barrows kc, diary completion, and end game progression.
---
Where da fashionacape at? :D
---
Missing "Poll meta defining changes as QoL changes"
---
Neither of them did that tho.
---
Love that OWO 💗🦋
---
you know they can just freeze you then run then you're at max distance again right?
---
The sequence of 6 repeats.. so it may be mage mage mage range range mage.. you just gotta remember the first sequence
---
True, Forgot about the ban Wave system but I wasn't expecting anyone to get banned at all just muted for a few days (Hope they learn there lesson) and maybe if they continue to break the rules a Perm Mute, Don't think anyone in my list anyway was seriously breaking the rules just public annoyances and bad scammers 
---
Thanks!!!
---
So you think leaving it overrun by bots is better than it being slightly annoying for new players(they'd just kill the mugger quick or go somewhere else)
---
Like, a bunch of new players seeing that shit is not good for the game. A lot of people quit when they see the botfest that is f2p(which is a shame because it's really only very early f2p that's like that). 
---
It's not a good look for the game at all. It's a hell of a lot better than new people quitting because they can't get a single rock from these "level 3 people who don't awnser."
---
When is the Farming Guild going to provide an invisible +7 boost for Woodcutting like the Woodcutting guild? I really want to chop the redwood that I’ve grown myself but the XP rates are significantly lower to cutting redwoods in the Woodcutting guild.
---
This give me motivation, died 2 times to jad today :/ (first time doing fight caves since 2011)
---
any tips? (45 def, 52 prayer, 75 range)
---
And most of them fail to kill you if you flick appropriately. Thats why you see some many rcers with a fally shield. Its sort of like an emergency prayer pot.
---
I'm interested in meeting the rulemakers who decreed you can't be mad about what's in a video game.  I can be mad all I want.  When a majority of people consistently vote against content that benefits them, maybe they're the problem. As much as I admit they make the wilderness more exciting I'm also happy their content additions consistently fail.  Coz in the end a lot of their success comes from players who just want to do shit efficiently or get clues done, and get their asses beaten with little recourse.  If the wilderness had to be nerfed and pkers removed from the game I'd be perfectly happy.

Looks like he’s fitter than 90% of the rs community with the added grace of a swan ..
---
No shit the DSM 5 recognizes get 99 stats in OSRS as a symptom of autism spectrum disorder. Getting 99RC is an automatic diagnosis.
---
yeah theres definitely no way theres legit reasons to vote no...poor pkers are the victims :( ignore the pvm question also failing by a wide margin btw
---
Yes. 
---
It more of a defensive tactic on the opponents' part. You won't get killed if they stood under you. And you can just bring mithril seeds to move away like they do in DMM if you are on standards and want to stop this from happening.
---
gotta love krs
