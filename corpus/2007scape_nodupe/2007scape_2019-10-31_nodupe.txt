gear is important and defence actually matters against rune drags since they hit like a truck. justiciar is dope for them. inventory is basically right thoguh yeah, personally i prefer alchs to veng in the pouch but you do you
---
In top dps gear and supply cost, you have to factor that in, not to mention people aren’t getting them every 10 hours. Basilisks are beasts that take longer to kill than that.
---
dude you sound like a total boomer lol you state your opinion so confidently as if it's a fact and then act like some martyr for what's right lmao. "Almost nothing added by RuneLite, OSBuddy or whatever other third party client qualifies as quality of life." Opinion not fact.
---
Qol mandatory update plz.
---
My icon is still from winter 2017. Mine still has a santa hat on ever since I installed in during beta.

Just why? Why can't jagex see that runelite makes the game way more playable and enjoyable... removing stuff is just gonna kill the game...

lmfaaaaao 1 jaw every 10 hours 🤣🤣 bro you're in for a bad time

the serial abuser with a t slur in her new bio? 🤔🤔🤔

CasualBA or casual ba or something like that.

Holy shit! Nice!
---
PVP’ers are uncompromising with us, so we’re uncompromising with them. It’s a bitter Cold War where eye for an eye continues to increase in proportions.
---
How in the hell did you find that post hostile or aggressive? It was a lot more reasonable than your own post. You just started acting really defensive for no reason.
---
Don't be so insecure. I don't think it was a personal attack.
---
I agree, but these sweaty nerds keep raging
---
I’ll check it out! Thank you!
---
This is what they meant when they said 3rd party clients give unfair advantage
---
What a nightmare
---
&gt; For that reason I believe that if you cannot possibly enforce a rule, it just shouldn't be a rule.
---
While I get the logic, I can't agree with that. That is saying if there ever is a bot they can't detect, then that bot should be legal. Cheaters will cheat regardless but that doesn't mean cheating should be made the norm.
---
Please don't tell me you think a Tesla is flex worthy
---
She cute tho
---
It's a great boss for early ironmen - super easy to kill, and shits out tons of Crystal keys (dragonstones are pretty scarce on low level btws)
---
no, these are bots. they hop the instant you say "Bot?" even mid run.
---
MTX nice pvp bad
---
WELL it sold for 700 mill. I literally have no idea what to do. I have not decided if i want to buy every buyable 99, and then see what bis items i can buy with what its left. Or if I should prioritize buying bis items, and focus on slayer with really good items. And then just train buyable skills when needed. Lol im kinda overwhelmed. Also i dont really play thaaat much. I usually play like 2-3 weeks, then take a 3 month break. Lol so, idk what to do rn.
---
A good majority of them, menu entry swapper alone is bannable.
---
I just checked, apparently five times but they were all several years ago. My passwords have been changed several times over since then and I honestly don't even remember my passwords at the time.
---
Vote no to PvP polls boys
---
I've gotten this drop and this made me laugh so fucking hard, i feel this meme.
---
I mean how bad is your computer? It’s a game from the early 2000’s it runs awesome on any piece of shit machine I boot it up on. I’ve been playing for years with the official client, do raids, got fire cape, high lvls, and I’ve never had an issue. Anyone who needs runelite is handicapping themselves
---
I understand that this isn't just you, but this is an incredibly disappointing announcement. 
---
While I appreciate providing further information, I find the content of the newspost to be a bit confusing and ambiguous. 
---
So many people are tied into and used to using clients like base RuneLite, which has in the past co-operated with you and removed overpowered features. 
---
The main client is lacking a lot of quality of life, and I agree with the sentiment that it's absurd to start threatening bans without any reasonable, official replacement in place. 
---
As others have said, I personally don't care to play the game with the official client in its current state. 
---
If I'm banned for using things like the menu entry swapper and tile markers on runelite, then I'm out of this game and my money is gone. 
---
Do we really want to make this the hill that OSRS dies on?
---
I didn’t take his comment as aggressive at all?
---
Honestly I think its better to have quality songs where they fit/not feel required to have one every episode. Keeps them a little more special and makes the videos more varied. Loving the series.
---
I see why a lot of people don’t look forward to it vs normal iron men or mains. But me and my bro in law are pumped for it.
---
Use OSbuddy or Runelite at you're own risk. Unfortunately I've only used the original client so can't help. However Runelite has cut the features from it's client that aren't allowed, but I don't believe OSbuddy has.
---
Tbh this is a great suggestion. I'll ask him tonight but I really think you might be on to something. Thank you very much for the help.
---
Atleast it was the ugly one of the two
---
They did poll it again after that and it failed again. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing it repolled in the future, like in the upcoming QoL month or such. Though they would likely avoid repolling it too often, especially given its history with polls.
---
Is switching bankers bank option or bones to use similar to thieving and talk to?
---
Runelite doesn't make money. It's osbuddy you're thinking of.
---
Picture of totally average elite clue.
---
Great content dude.
---
Thanks for doing this. As a mobile only player, I had no idea PC players 3rd party clients had the capabilities to put me at so huge a disadvantage.
---
I’m not trying to pick fights with anyone or anything, I just see content releases or statements from Jagex being heavily criticized. You go on twitch for the Q&amp;A streams and basically every time one of the mods opens their mouth there’s nothing but criticism. I’m not saying Jagex is free from criticism or attempting to white knight- there are definitely things I disagree with. I just feel like at this point people are being critical for the lulz
---
Asking third party clients to remove certain features. Without having an alternative solution on the Official Client. Doesn't really fix the problem.
---
Wtf? Who cares how someone sees an item. If a main enjoys it for the money so what? Voluntary iron men acting like pretentious pricks because they voluntarily chose to be an iron man is laugh out loud funny
---
Hit the nail on the head Flemts. Jagex should have addressed this years ago, but instead they let 3pcs become an integral part of the game.
---
I see it as the final drop for most bosses, as far as I'm concerned if I have pet in most situations I won't return, sadly only that's been sire, as my pet rates suuuck
---
Holy shit, I remember this video. Could it have been an old Spac Mac clip?
---
Both prayer and spellbook reordering has failed in-game polls not once, but twice. Clearly they should not be in the game then. It ruins the integrity of the polling system if third party clients allow you to simply circumvent the people's choice.
---
[Link to the 2019 poll that they failed](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1552)
---
Pretty hard to do both together because the saplings take up too much space to be efficient. You could do the farm run and throw in the catherby fruit tree spot as I think that's the only one near a farm that isn't also near a more efficient teleport spot
---
I wonder if Osbuddy removed those shortcut clicks on altar...
---
huh?? 2 black d hides is worth 6k dude its not rare l0l. It even says how much they cost in your chat 😂
---
I’m 130 kills in (using slaughter) and I’ve had Pet, knives, heart and SLH so far... god I hope I get claw soon!!
---
99 ranged was my first 99 as well. I was in a pvm clan, and thought I could go bossing with it, but my hp and Def were still in the 80s at the time, so I couldn't =/
---
yea stay behind while 70% of player base uses runelite LMFAO.
---
prayer reorder was just the ability to move the prayers around in the prayer tab. It was nice cause you could put all the useful prayers at the top left, but it's not a big loss either way.
---
Didnt realize we had that to begin with.
---
Nieve gets crushed by a boulder in monkey madness 2. It’s horrific.
---
well RL removed the plugins jagex wanted or so I heard so you wont be able to use them anyway. I have no idea tho since I dont have RL and other 3rd parties probably still have "illegal plugins".
---
Pretty sure you just need to pack up a desktop PC (laptops will not work), rent a space inside jagex , move there, and solely play the game in front of a designated chaperon, even then a false ban is a reasonable 80%.  - Jiggleflex player detection department
---
Do you even understand what you're ranting about even does?
---
It failed the poll sooo...
---
I have a couple of skiller 99s but I've always wanted 99 range ever since I was a noob getting gem cutting scammed. I also got 99 hp a few minutes ago which was another childhood goal :D all around good day
---
is cerberus break even or profitable if not counting unique drops? Using bludgeon and bandos.
---
 I feel like the pray pot usage is bit much (I don't plan on buying spectral yet).
---
Unrelated issue.
---
This would have effected integrity of pking by lowering the skill ceiling. It shouldn't have been polled.
---
I get really irritated by the amount of absolute tripe posted in this subreddit, that people continue to support. It's like, do any of you play any other games ever? Have any of you even played something other than harvest moon or fucking animal crossing?
---
Integrity to a competitive environment should trump QoL.
---
It was also polled to be distinct from pvp, such that it was implemented to the main game. That failed the poll also. People dont want any more inconsistent behaviours.
---
Yeah let me cry you a river real quick lmao
---
Yes yes yes
---
NO SONG?!
---
Iron man and vegan. You will be a downvote machine.
---
definitely agree, but it had a pretty healthy population until Bluehole doubled up on the korean p2w. It was one of the better korean MMOs that I have played
---
Lol. But to be fair, their lack of colorblind accessibility after 20 years is pathetic.
---
"removal of cerberus plug in" NOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Only runescape YouTubed I watch is flipping old school to learn how to ge flip. Other than that I find a lot of them to be irritating especially for vesta
---
Last task I got 2 jaws, made 60m
---
Could kill around 70 per hour, jaw is estimated at 1/512.
---
So 1 every 7-8 hours in average.
---
It's over 3m per hour right now
---
Usually those older vids are removed by the creator, just because it doesn't age well. The only couple you could find might be some Ice Giant 99 vids, no guarantee on those either though lol.
---
Puro puro. Just gimme my glory
---
Almost looks like a spirograph, really neat looking.
---
They would have to update their TOS. In order to detect screen markers, they need to be able to see your screen. In order to do so, they will be invading your privacy, it will essentially be a RAT but without being able to control your pc. 
---
It is a privacy concern and I don't see it anywhere in their policy that says anything about having the right to invade users privacy by observing their screen, for detection purposes. 
---
They would have to make it clear, for EU laws. They can't just add it in without disclosing it. 
---
This will probably make people quit the game more than anything. But expect there to be a lawsuit if they do it without disclosing it.
---
Pff i need a gtx1080 to power my 3440x1440 panel. This way i can run 20 alts at once AND a pornhub window.
---
World 302 by demonic ruins sounds good to me
---
Nope dont want u ancient nerds too barrage easily in pvp
---
Didnt even make a purple light come out of suitcase feelsbadman
---
Only to keep constant surveillance on us
---
Just search Liz768 on youtube. You’ll be 300m richer
---
Lmao my guy before you loose all hope, I agree with you. If 10,000,000 humans are involved in, say, a car crash each year, in the scope of the entire human population, being in a car crash would be an extremely uncommon/unlikely occurrence. 
---
I think what everyone else is getting unnecessarily bitchy about, is that those 10M people are still a fairly large group which need to be catered to. 
---
This example is on a much larger scale, but still applies here. It is **not** common to be colourblind 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Buttttt then again it also depends on how you describe ‘common’. Bottom line, you’re just loosing those magical internet points for no real gain, or even constructive argument, and I’m just chatting shit at this point
---
Banning all the clients are going to make the problem you mentioned worse. Then the only clients that are going to bring those features to their ecosystems are ones that are already banned and probably botting clients.
---
If the official client had community made plugins you wouldn't even have to ban third party clients, because most people just want the simple timers, and floor item text features.
---
But is  there a way to get things back? I really want to play the game again but I don't want to grind everything back again...
---
Left click reset?
---
It was 67 from Venenatis at a 1/170.7 chance. I'm pretty lucky on them and a little lucky on rings
---
He's like my YouTube guilty pleasure. When I'm feeling real bored, I'll watch some wacky pk vids. Otherwise, swampletics is the only video game YouTube videos I watch.
---
I’ve compiled the client with IntelliJ before, but is it possible to build a standalone app on our own? I don’t want to have IntelliJ running in the background.
---

---
Are you skipping your pure ess?  Slackers
---
They never had the power to enforce it &amp; still do not. It's not a matter of how long you've had access to a QOL update without them interfering, it doesn't just reach 4 years &amp; its suddenly irreversible.
---
They made a game on their client. Other people modified that client to get around it. Now Jagex are working on moderating those clients. It's simple really.
---
Lmfao what? It requires dragon Slayer 2
---
Sweaty nerds dont need those shit plugins
---
Sup Spoon it’s Troubled
---
True in that we don’t really know about Jagex’s implementation.
---
I suppose this would be a good question for the QnA.
---
Although, is it not the global farming tick cycle that dictates when a plant advances a stage? I agree with everything you say, that when the plant advances a growth stage, there is a chance it will skip one also. If not then it will wait until the next **tick**. Is not this tick here the global farming tick? I know each plant has its own growth times but those must align with the global clock also. That’s why sometimes when planting a herb within a short proximity of the global tick, it will almost immediately grow. 
---
So my assumption is that in the case where a plant advances 2 stages as soon as you plant it, it is because you got lucky and planted it right before the global tick, and also got lucky in that the chance to skip a phase procced and advanced the plant two stages instead of the one.
---
So how then, can you say it is irrespective of the global farming tick given that is pretty much how the skill operates? Again as you said, given the current knowledge we have of the game then what I’m saying here seems largely more likely. I think it’s fine to make the assumption that perhaps Jagex has wired something else under the screen, but really **why** would they add a sort of “cascading” ability to something that was always said to be used to advance a single growth cycle? 
---
At least in the example you provided, the secateurs, it turned out it wasn’t a direct 10% rate of increase to crops, rather a 10% bonus chance to save a life when harvesting a plant (each plant has a certain amount of lives upon pick, and there is a chance to deplete a life as you pick). So the effective bonus to overall harvest is less than 10%, which you could say is less than they intended. In this case, if they did add some hidden mechanic like this, it would be a fairly significant buff to something intended to only be one cycle, rather than something slightly less effective than intended. Besides, if it is a bug that it can advance several stages at once, this is certainly not intended, and as Jagex has stated and done in the past, anything they unintentionally add to the game that is not how it was intended to be added as per the poll, they will change (for example, the whole zmi rc rate thing, and the rate of thieving and agility xp in the underwater course). The example of the magic secateurs is not exactly valid as they have stated that they would not fix things that were already in the game before the release of old school. Or else they probably would have fixed tick manipulation for skilling among other things also.
---
Anyway, I digress back to that it is a good question for the q&amp;a, although I really do not think it is far fetched for me to believe that it works as I described above. Just as I believe that it is not far fetched for them to have messed up and coded something unintended. Although it is also not far fetched to believe that this should be changed if so, given that it is not what they intended.
---
Imagine being born after 2000
---
Devalues my 59kc mole pet. ^^^^^/s
---
I was mostly trying to work it out based on estimates for supply and demand, and how it'll take quite a while for it to settle. For example, killing basilisk knights on task is currently around 4.1m gp per hour with jaws at 29.5m, assuming it's a 1/500 drop chance (might be wrong). For something about as afk as rune dragons, I imagine it'll eventually settle a bit above them at say 2m an hour, or around 14.3m in a couple years, unless the drop rate turns out to be a bit worse. But as it is slayer task only and poor slay xp per hr, it'll take a long time to settle. I agreed with you - 15m within only a couple of weeks, and 9m approx settling point. Prices always start out pretty crazy. The first rapiers in game cost in the bils, 50m for the first few infernal capes doesn't seem outlandish.
---
I meant in a way that is anyone detected on any non official client gets 2 temps than a perm ban. Give botice with a big banner when u login for a month before removal. 
---
It would force all clients to move over to a model like the alt1 toolkit for rs3. Because tbh ive played legit on bot clients for the past like 10 years just for the xp/hr tracker.
---
It’s a collectors item
---
Looks like a NMZ account if I've ever seen one
---
Amazing, I haven't seen a dev so out of touch with their community since the whole EA 'pride and accomplishment' thing. 
---
Are we really going back to the days of 'Markdonald' and a studio that is willing to cut off their nose to spite their face? 
---
Not to mention that the OSRS team only has 26 staff members listed on the post, are you seriously suggesting that one or two of them are gonna step away from delivering fresh content/game optimization and instead focus their efforts on punishing players for wanting a more streamlined game experience?  
---
Come on guys, really, is this just an out of season spooky April fool's joke??
---
This could've been funny
---
Oh wow, expecting a company to actually do some work on their game. All these "requires engine work so no or too much work" points are so stupid. Sure, this is a small thing and most players won't ever get 2 mutagens but it's not consistent with something like the pet. "5m shouldn't be a huge deal if you have two 1/6500 drops from zulrah" his point was about bank space too, buying another helm is a space + 5m. For something like an ironman, every space is pretty crucial.
---
What armour are they wearing?
---
Give Oziach that damn dragons head.
---
Even better is rolling the empty slot on the rare drop table and getting a talisman
---
It's really easy to stop them rs3 is virtually free of bots and jaddex easily has the tech to implement, they just dont
---
I had the same problem. My Zulrah time to kill has definitely suffered and I had to tele out twice. It comes back pretty quick though.
---
I like to party.
---
yeah i'm trying to make up for what i've done and be a better person to the people around me so i never hurt anyone like that ever again. sidenote it's funny that you present having "trap" in my bio as on par with abuse but that's not a conversation for the 2007scape subreddit
---
1. How are you bored after 8k points
---
2. How did you create that within 8k points
---
King Narnode
---
Yes. If you don’t want to wait to pk at any point then yes. Lower level pking is mostly 1 def pures. Any pking accounts with defense generally wait til they’re mostly trained before pking.
---
I said "Vanilla client is only how it used to work where it's 1 of 5 volume options instead of a slider." which is saying that Runelite has a slider, vanilla doesn't then I said "It being green is also Runelite as well" saying that is also Runelite only.
---
This is actually it though. It's what makes the SkillSpecs bullying so good.
---
That guy doesnt know what hes talking about, dont listen to him. DFS has 10 magic defence: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragonfire_shield
---
Dfs is mainly used for melee dragon killing because of its +7 strength bonus
---
If you think I’m right clicking farmers to pay for my trees you’ve lost it. 
---
Fix your shit client first and then come down on the other clients. Also, pick some reasonable shit to be mad about. Menu entry swapper and 1 click black jack are not equal. Putting them in the same category is brain damaged, no one is this stupid on Jagexs payroll... right? ....?
---
Rendi would die though right?
---
Can't Jagex just poll for the default left click option of NPCs to be the most commonly used option? I know RS3 does this.
---
The fact that you think one click blackjacking isn’t fine is measure of how autistically some people gatekeeper their arbitrary clicking number goals. If the sole argument for banning something is because it makes an activity more convenient, not faster, then that’s an idiotic ban. Making things more convenient without making them stronger is exactly what QoL is.
---
I just want runescape to to taste like real runescape again.
---
Charge your shield bro. Lol jk, gzz
---
Have 3rd party clients gone too far
---
Good comeback
---
Magma def goes with more stuff than tanz does but tanz individually is much cooler
---
I said "that bot", not "all bots". So if they can't detect say a specific mobile bot, then that bot should be legal? Because they can detect some plugins, just like they can detect some (most) bots.
---
Read other explanations from people who actually know wjay they're talking about
---
If runelite dies, a bunch of the player base will die with it. Most players are using the client and have no interest in playing without it.
---
If youre kills are around 2 to 3 minutes, do the math. Its actually not that long. Vorkath can be annoying though, if you have even the slightest bit of lag or connection issues on the acid phase, or really any phase, youre dead
---
&gt; Indicates what prayers to use in what order, for example in the Cerberus boss fight 
---
Back onto the block list hellhounds go
---
That's simply incredible. I can't imagine the amount of grind that went into each account.
---
Because runescape is a simple fucking game it's super easy to bot. Not rocket science dude.
---
God I wish I had gotten your brothers
---
&gt;just ban the bots jigglyplex what the frick!!!!
---
These memes are dying out. The community has moved on.
---
Yea pking is my favorite part of the game
---
Except it's still in the updated runelite client and you're all acting like crazy people.
---
Every single gaming company will at minimum lock your account if you chargeback, and at worst ban you.
---
Having attempted to obtain such a prized piece of equipment vital in obtaining optimal rates of experience for mining precious resources, on behalf of men &amp; mostly women of iron, I have to declare my eternal and undying envy at your ability to obtain such a prized tool on such a short amount of time.

 I hereby, express my hatred at your luck in this matter, but still wish you luck in your future endeavours, and hope you gain optimal use from your pickaxe comprised of the rarest of materials , known to gielnor.
---
What about the agility course obstacle markers?
---
Shift walk under
---
This is happening, it's classified under combat according to jagex but they can't enforce it. It's just fear mongering.
---
Other MMOs have allowed more brain-dead addons since before 2007. I didn't mention "entry-menu swappers" for a reason, or anything automated for that matter, but setting my own screen markers? It's one of the best features that allows for efficient play.   
---
They shouldn't be a permanently bannable offense the first time. Also there are many people that use runelite that don't go on reddit or read the website. My biggest issue is communication. If they can detect use of a banned addon, but don't issue warnings nor provide evidence, then it's an issue of lazy moderation. I could be banned for an addon I didn't realize fit into these categories, or one I didn't realize I left on. Permanently. Without the ability to defend myself. UNLIKE SOME STREAMERS
---
Actually pretty fucking rare for any YouTuber and this guy consistently pulls it off.
---
Can't kill it if it is in a task only area.
---
LOL what kinda response is that
---
Jagex should know better by now and speak very slowly and carefully. Apparently the majority of osrs players are still in 5th grade.
---
Cool, all the shady clients will be getting more customers and users after today, and you penalize those of us using runelite. God forbid you guys just hire a dev to fix your God awful client in the first place. Jagex made 50 million pounds in profit last year and can't afford to spend a dime on obvious shit 3rd party clients shouldn't need to do.
---
To be fair, how did tiles showing you where to and where not to stand, projectile landing, etc.
---
NOT count as cheating before? Gives people who use third party clients an advantage for bossing over people who use the vanilla client.
---
Know whats funny most other Mmos let you literally do every single thing on that list because they know QoL &gt; babyragers crying about the game being too easy when you have to spend 500 hours to max.
---
Ooooohh that's how the wise old man did it....
---
Weird how when Introduced to better quality people don't want to go back to bad quality. If you eat spam for 5 years and eat steak for 3 months why in the fuck would you want to go back to spam. You aren't spoiled, you know what higher quality meat is and that's what you set the standard as.

You are blowing this out of proportions. 
---
1) Tile markers are allowed. The ones you manually mark that is. Automatically marking of tiles based on projectiles or boss mechanics are the banned ones. 
---
2) You don’t have to pay attention to anything as long as you are using one of the Osbuddy, Runelite or Konduit. They all comply with the rules set by Jagex (which they also helped create). 
---
People cry so hard and try to see the worst in things. What more than this statement did you honestly expect?
---
Worst case: ban all clients
---
Middle case: ban plugins bypassing game mechanics
---
Best case: surprise here is our new client
---
If you honestly think about it none of the features currently listed would have passed an ingame poll. Imagine the "should vorkath projectiles display where they land?" type of poll. People cry just because they are used to it. 
---
Yes vanilla client needs updates. Yes they shouldve happen years ago. But now we are here and can only control the situation until those updates hopefully happen in the next years. 
---
Botting clients are also publicly available. Should we all just bot instead? Where do you draw the line?
---
If players want it they can re-poll it, but having FAILED a poll the have to have a stance against it.
---
Another great piece of art as per usual, king.

I think the issue people had with the spell book filter poll (which is what I assume you're memeing) was that it was polled in slightly different ways three different times.

If you ever somehow get entirely cleaned, whether from being hacked or the likes of the sand casino, void is really nice to have to rebuild as it costs nothing.
---
Can you just bring your mouse with you? 
---
If you have a mouse then what does it matter of you're on a laptop?
---
Jesus christ unhiding this made me jump
---
That isn't my thought/logic lol. Your "joke" is suggesting we replace an ethnic slur with a stand in word "bwana" so it would be okay to say it without feeling offended/causing offense. That logic sounds so stupid. Joke or no joke.
---
Yeah I have a mouse but I can only play on my bed at home haha
---
It’s a joke it’s not supposed to be logical
---
And below this is my beautiful art.... I dont know how you people do it
---
I think they just removed splashing xp from lumbridge area so maybe try somewhere else.
---
Pretty sure it’s legos Star Wars
---
Infinity isn't an upgrade really
---
Didnt realise you know most uims
---
Lol how old are you? And what country do you live in? I'm interested to know why you think this.
---
I hear you but tbh if I get banned for reordering prayers so I have convenience across my accounts, then it's time to move on anyway.
---
Cheaters gonna cheat. It will always be a cat and mouse game. 
---
Where do you draw the line? Bots and bot-like clients are also publicly available if you want. Should everyone just use them instead? Almost no risk in ban there either if you set them up right.
---
Iban staff (u) is still a solid value.

I mean he probably wasn't world hopping literally just hunting me, I'm saying he was hopping around green dragons for over an hour, saw him several times but didn't log in time once

Yupp that was it, I was trying it on a Rat at Lumby and once I read your reply I moved to Varrock Zammy monk and its working. Thanks! (I do think it's weird to remove it from that one spot though what difference does that make except make it look more barren than it was.)
---
Drews of the world, unite!

You don't have any tables at your house?

LOL!! You're wild.

I suppose I could do play on the kitchen table haha didn’t even think about that 😆

wow dont fuck this one up

I know I saw somewhere saying menu swapper was bannable but it hasn't been removed from runelight yet so idk. I know the others aren't bannable I just felt like mentioning them. Also that method is only around 34k xp an hour while 3 tick woodcutting. That is why I like the menu swapper because it makes limestone bearable and keeps you from destroying your flamtaer bag. Losing out on 20k per hour is pretty significant when you are going for higher levels for building a maxed house. I did limestone from around 60 con to 80 for master stashes. I just don't like the idea of getting banned for training construction on an ironman account.
---
I had troubles picking the right sammich from.. distractions.
---
Mod Ash option was a clever way of counting how many individual voters there were
---
I like watching my guy run to it
---
&gt; people who use the vanilla client
---
Masochists?
---
Some people did not vote for that I noticed. I wish strawpoll had a choose X option instead of as many as you want, but it still works out okay.
---
seriously how can you get rid of prayer reordering?! thats like seriously trying to kill the already dead wilderness. talk about reviving but enforcing rules that kill it
---
I'd love to join but I'm too introverted and I've gotten used to playing solo and not having any friends for a year now. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
---
Do quests, MM1 gives you a whopping 3k
---
Do these even work? I always see them at G.E. when not in total level worlds, but who in members is clicking these? I could understand F2P as it will have a lot of newer players, but I’m surprised this scam has lasted as long as it has. 
---
Side note, I’ve recently seen them breaking a bit where the person spamming randomly starts sending stuff like “shfjakahfjaks” and then goes back to spamming their website message. I don’t know what causes that but keep it going. Humors me.
---
You don’t realize how lacking the vanilla client is until you play on a 3rd party client like RuneLite. Even putting all the fancier features aside, simple ones like being able to see the names of items on the ground, or seeing how many charges are left on a piece of jewellery, make the game experience more fluid and enjoyable. While it’s true certain features go beyond QoL and get into the territory of unfair player advantages, the vast majority of features MAKE SENSE and should be in the official client, and probably would be if Jagex had the resources to focus on it without slowing content. 
---
Another thing I’m going to say is that the RS2 you played (pre-EOC/pre-RS3) was a much simpler game all around than Old School. Bosses with varied, unique fight mechanics simply did not exist then, let alone high-level end-game content like raids or the Inferno. A more
---
complex game warrants more complex features and the vanilla client has lagged woefully behind.
---
Imagine if you were lv 1 and got it

Ahahaha. 90 seconds dedicated to a Reddit geek's spiel is most often 90 seconds wasted mate.

thanks heaps i had been using the osrs normal client for like an hour and it was awful

Bruh the "reeeeee" is apart of the memes. Grab your crabs and join in.

thanks heaps i had to use normal client for like an hour

Talk to any ironman in game that's above like 1500 total. They are almost all like this
---
So, do you not play any other online games because there are toxic people on them too? What do you do when someone is being toxic in PvE?
---
I got another d chain and d2h after this post, at 230 kc now lol
---
same and I haven't played RS in over a year
---
What do you mean by original stats? 
---
Also, what's it gonna look like? Nice Skyrim one btw!
---
All the other input (especially RFD) has been good. As far as dailies, farm runs (specifically herbs) can be very profitable. Look at the wiki for quests that give farming xp and get to 34 if you aren’t already (and get magic secateurs), then do ranarrs. You can make 100k per run depending on how many patches you do, and you can get in several runs per day depending on your schedule. It’s a nice way to keep building the cash stack for relatively little effort.
---
Im positive its only because a thousand people do birdhouses for every person doing mole.
---
They aren’t online 24/7
---
As others have said, the og mod andrew had that name. But in the future juat know it can say name tejected if the name is on an account that is perm banned.
---
Whaaaat! Those odds are insane!
---
But the prestige diaries, could be based on a specific skill.
---
Although they'd have to have arbitrary numbers like:
---
Cut 1k logs, 2k oak logs, 3k Willow logs.
---
And then the prestige diaries add some boost or give access to an item.
---
The real question is how did I play up to this point without it?
---
mate thats like dressing like a columbine shooter a bit fucked up dont you think there are fally massacres survivors on here with ptsd disrespectful smh
---
I’d be a p mod just so that I can mute you over an over
---
I love it when the person being pranked plays along like this lol
---
Yeah this post has caused some serious xp waste.
---
&gt;More likely what their working on is detecting menu/entity swapping and moving.
---
This is maybe possible, but it seems kind of unlikely. You'd have to send every right-click/menu open to the server, collect literally every single action, then run some sort of analysis on it to see if people are doing things without incurring the correct number of menu-opening actions.
---
I'm sure this is technically feasible, but it seems.... kind of unlikely.
---
Try not to get stressed about keeping up the songs each episode, they're awesome when they happen, but don't let it make video-making less fun. :)

"This fairly easy, non-grinding way to train skills, that makes money exists, and is widely broadcast... why are the prices of the rewards dropping?"

yeah this is a good one. Just found this randomly in a meme compilation on YT and thought this sub would appreciate

Sween is the escapegoat

Lol pking isn’t about the loot, it’s about having fun. Making people cry about dying is hella fun.

spec
---
Same, sold mine for 21m day one. Oh well, I don't mind it. Just happy I got the drop and got fat cash for it
---
lmfao...... the barrows mini map plug in was too OP........ they're trolling right?
---
Supply is wayyyyy up and obtaining shards to make/use them is not fun at all or a quick process. I think the prices of tool seeds could change someday if tool/weapon/armor seeds could be deconstructed into shards like zulrah uniques into scales.
---
Jesus 87 days playtime and only 1761 total? What do you do ingame?
---
Doing barrows on a main isn't efficient so probably not then
---
Why you being a condescending little bitch

Was polled, in multiple forms. One of the bigger failures, never breaking 60%
---
Yes, we know. Mentions it in pretty much every video uploaded.
---
Just answering your question. Pretty sure my reply gave you a lot more clear of a picture as to what happened.
---
But let's not talk about all the forked clients which had all the OP features first and still have.
---
if I hold shift and p it works, so it must be bound to something. I don't know where to go to for hotkeys in runelite, nothing comes up when i search for keybinds or hotkeys.
---
You guys spend 8+ hours a day required to think about the best action for this game and still manage to fuck it up every time. Banning the communities solutions to your willfully ignored problems is so fucking ignorant. Yyou will be joining a select few who has destroyed their game(TWICE) through your own incompetence.(cerb plug in for color blind people, tile markers, boss respawn timers were all QoL we did cause you lazy fucks wouldn't.) 
---
Go manually ban some bots that are being created faster than you can shove your own thumb up your asses, you useless cowards.
---
I don't think people realise there's an entire set of players who will be active but will never get a 99
---
Rookie numbers, kid
---
Jk, thats dope. Nice account.
---
More expensive but more afk time. Overloads only give 5 minutes, personally I prefer overloads
---
If it's not a removed feature in runelite, it should be allowed. I think someone at Jagex and Runelites developer had a good talk about what is and what is not allowed. So they straight up removed any plugin that violates the terms. Take this with a grain of salt tho.
---
6,322 days ago for my account and same age.
---
So does that include the plugins that switched the slots for certain prayers?
---
You're like a Californian that posts a picture of a forest fire captioned "can we do something about this?"
---
Like what makes you think nothing is being done? *Maybe* the problem is just really fucking persistent and hard to solve?
---
What a world we live in
---
You can go in the cave after you've completed the quest
---
It’s ironic we were talking about left click black jacking being non-bannable still because they can’t detect it and less than 12 hours later they released a statement saying that it is bannable, even though they can’t detect it.
---
I’m curios, did they do a server roll back when that happened or were the people that lost their stuff shit out of luck back then?
---
D
---
These are designed to give a loot like this almost 50% of the time and people still upvote this when it gets posted 4 times a week.
---
Actually fell for that shit when I was a pleb, like I knew it most likely was a scam but still explored a bit before I noped out. Had 500 total and a bank of 50k. Logged in a few days later with 30 more smithing levels and a million worth of cannonballs. Reclaimed account, changed password, added authenticator etc. Wasn't mad, got free training and cash. Kind of nervous of getting banned for botting but I never did.
---
Good to know. Glad it helped.
---
Are you implying that you maxed in a year on mobile?
---
What does a premium client have that the regular doesn’t? Genuinely curious
---
anything in the official runelite client is implicitly okay to use, because there is a long history of the runelite team removing plugins at jagex's request, or when they just seem OP.
---
Noyes
---
Awful, who would do such a thing!
---
ah, true.
---
what’s even more mind-blowing are Zulrah bots. These aren’t bots who go straight to the iron rocks southeast of Varrok. No, these bots manage to:
---
Get 56 Agility
---
Get 43+ Prayer
---
Get 75+ Magic
---
Get 75+ Ranged
---
Kill a lvl 110, 3 lvl 91s, 3 lvl 62s, a lvl 89
---
All in doing so to complete a 4-part questline and be ready for Zulrah. Then they manage to gear up and do consistent trips of a boss that consists of 4 different rotations of about 10 different phases each, some of which require adaptive movement. 
---
If shit like this can go that long without being detected then yeah, I’m not going to pretend their integrity for 3pc/bot detection is solid.
---
They should have made stance on 3pc a long time ago. But its too far gone. We have people that have pked for 2 years for 1000s of hours and have never pked without freeze timers etc. I had my prays up to for zulrah. I relearnt thte normal spots for pking and it wasnt to hard. Done a lot of switching from pure to med pking mid trip and im used yo different prays. Moving aug where mystic might is, is a fucking godly qol. I voted no to having it in game because i believe it is better as a plugin. They need to repoll it now ffs. On detection, after puggers mobile botting vid, jmods went around manual banning anyone on the bluestacks emulator, 100s of false bans overnight, they can tell what client your on. Also check this from sween https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460188154029408256/639150304834879498/image0.jpg
---
ur mother
---
Even by that logic if it’s aimed at developers not making those plugins or having them available, then they don’t want the player base using them. Meaning it’s directed at the player base.
---
whatever they have in store is definitely not "Exciting" I'll give you that right now.
---
look im an optimist, maybe they hired a guy to work on the client
---
Picking flax is always insane money, doe!
---
The most notable is exp tracking. It has other things like mob kill tracking and drop tracking. That's pretty much it though, like I said, bare bones. But they're charging for stuff that would come standard for free on most clients in OSRS because they have a monopoly
---
slurping that corporate D
---
The little things?  They are removing such a small amount of features you'll still have tons of QoL features they added.
---
They actually didn't, and that's why they were removed
---
Oh don't worry, when you get a DHCB it's even more mindnumbingly boring
---
What part of the plugin is getting removed? I don't quite understand which part the minimal overlay is
---
Imagine not completing barrows before 86 magician s
---
I actually love you right now, thank you so much I’ve got it sorted!

i wonder how many of those 471 capes are legit players? they make false bans for bots all the time inferno cape false removals are likely happening too
---
oooo wah
---
We just made bonk, boys
---
That you've taken it upon yourself to create a guide to help people do this in the first place shows that there is an issue.
---
Is this updoot automatic? Is there a setting where it might be turned off? How can I check plz I am fear
---
its the 18+ part of the community. Its the dark lands. Dont ever go there...
---
Sticky keys?
---
I am not sure if this works... but the “rune-guy” in the Grand Exchange enchants them for a small fee.
---
JageX suck. The only thing I will give them somewhat credit for is banning these plugins, but they should rather have banned all 3pc
---
Never seen the Great Olm portrayed so greatly, well done

The whole minimap is supposed to be black so you can’t see where you have to go.

I read that in his voice lol.
---
First time I played this game as a kid, I couldn't figure out how to cook the bread in tutorial island. English is not my first language, so I had no idea what a 'range' was. I assumed it has something to do with bows, because of the icon of the skill called 'ranged'. It also didn't help that I couldn't read the part of the tutorial that tells you how to turn the camera with arrow keys, so I literally couldn't see the range from the default angle. 
---
I wasn't the only one at my school who had trouble, so we met up and spent a solid hour of expensive megabytes brute forcing it, using the dough on anything in the vicinity untill one of us hit an arrow key by accident. It was a revelation!
---
My mom wasn't happy about spending so much time without being able to use the phone though.
---
AFK skills like mining are perfect for mobile
---
Tfw 50fps at max so 144/60 won't make a difference
---
I personally use the official client and have never had any problems with it, or felt the need to change. Also if someone went rogue in one of the third party companies there's more of a likelihood of compromised account security. I am not saying it would happen, but it's just something I'd be aware of. Just my own personal opinion!
---
You're greatly misinformed about how much juice is needed to push a 4k display.  Commercial laptops using integrated graphics from like 2013 on haswell chips had QHD+ displays (yoga 2 pro and a few others).  When you start to do any form of gaming or video editing on them you will notice a huge hit to performance, basically unusable for those tasks, but watching videos, word processing, internet browsing etc all works fine on integrated graphics on 4k panels.
---
Which aid in any boss fights
---
right clicks arent visible server side. thats the reason this whole thing exists
---
They got an apology lol but there was no rollback
---
ive definitely had people who develop rl/openosrs say the opposite in terms of server side visibility.
---
if jagex could tell then youd easily have people banned for things like leftclick blackjacking, but as of right now its entirely safe.
---
I got pet at like 20 kc :)
---
Hill giants?!?

You Sir, or ma'am, are one crazy mother trucker.

It's based on our characters but I let the artist change some things

Hopefully there's more thrilling stuff to come!
---
He meant you can buy a bond with real money and sell it on the GE for like 4 mill to get that fashionscape.
---
Why are boss fight tactics prohibited?
---
Yes, I think that is also pretty clear in the post.  
---
"Any feature which reorders, moves, or resizes prayers or spells."
---
Runelite removed that plugin after communication with jagex to make it compliment.
---
Yup, i think that's rarer than any unique(except mutagen and pet. Maybe.)

---
I like making money while training though.
---

---
\*Tomorrow.
---
Honestly, at this point Jagex should spend some money and build a new, official, modern client themselves.
---
Nah I still couldn't get the hang of blackjacking even with MES, thieving is just so boring to me
---
This whole thing started because of OSB adding op plugins lol
---
Damn if they implemented a day/night cycle in this game...
---
I'm not going to argue with you because I already know there's no point.
---
Jagex wasn't banning simple shit like prayer reordering until OSB came out with their 1 click bones and 1 click construction.  Upon them starting to say that those things should be banned their reply was "don't worry keep doing it, i'll make sure you don't get banned".  All he cares about is selling OP plug-ins and hiding the fact that people are using them.  He's a greedy cunt that is getting a lot of nice non overpowered plug-ins removed from the game.
---
&gt;Anyone could have predicted this situation was going to happen eventually with 3rd party clients because again, that's the nature of 3rd party clients- to make the game easier in some manner.
---
Wow it didn't happen until OSB started releasing ridiculous shit?  Wow guys don't just blame OSB!!  It's not all their fault!!  Runelite is a big reason, they made OSB do it!!
---
Yeah, that's the one that's been removed, corp is so dead for me that I forgot about that, shouldn't be too impactful though for anyone who does corp I imagine.
---
Except they're not willing to pay someone to make it a permanent fix. Jmods make like ~50k a year equivalent to usd where as the average price for an engineering degree for that specific coding is about 135k. 
---
So the people able to fix it aren't going to fix it because money. Can't pay off your student loans with a third of a normal paycheck. 
---
Not to mention that management sucks fat cock according to most the jmods who have left.
---
I agree. So do like me and level thieving through Witch's garden. It's only almost as good as ardy knights, but I enjoy it.

Pretty sure that just means stuff that automatically/dynamically show what you should be doing

Dude, the sheer thought of making these icons easier to click has got me going on a 53 killstreak out of nowhere.

I mean it’s not like playing on mobile is really that friendly once you get into any kind of repetitive grind and don’t have a stylus. Shit is so hard to tap properly if you don’t have one if you’re using a phone.
---
Can someone more knowledgeable explain to me why simply restricting game access to the official client would not erradicate bots overnight? From my knowledge on bots, all the modern ones (aside from autoclickers) use their own botting client to interface with the applet. Is it not possible to detect (or build a robust system which detects) whether the official client is being used in each instance?
---
If it is possible, then the fact that Jagex have ignored their own client for years seems unforgiveable. They'd have had the answer to botting sitting in their laps since the game left web browsers.
---
Ranged is a really good stat for members bossing / slayer, so you’ll actually see a lot of people with higher range than strength if you join members (myself included)

Thanks alot!

runelite cant really work cus its a community project, we should look into integrating the osbuddy, if anything

How to kill deep wild pvp 101
---
Replace dfs with a defender plus extended super antifire, get a dhl, get a fire cape. Get a dragon warhammer for specs as well ideally. Make sure you're using a torture instead of a fury. I prefer bandos over justiciar tbh if you're planning on banking bones.
---
Lance over justiciar any day, especially if u already have bandos. With 85 def ur gonna take a lot of dmg even with justiciar. So it's better to invest in a higher (much higher) dps weapon to reduce the time u are in combat with them. Faster kill times = less dmg taken &amp; more money per hour.
---
Honestly surprised the Rune Pouch price from slayer got reduced. Thought it’d be another one of those “I had to grind it out, so you should too,” type votes. 
---
Glad it did though. I may not be able to get my 500 points back, but you can save yours.
---
I got 2 ballista springs and a zenyte in my first task, but haven’t been back since they removed it
---
Vivendum rs for all dutch pvm-ers

Mine was 2 zenytes in 2 tasks. Made the game playable lol
---
A lot of you are saying "banking and leprechaun is still allowed" but how do we actually know this? It can all be considered a "similar" feature. How do we actually know that when they develop whatever detection method, people aren't just going to get a ban because it detects MES with things such as banker and leprechaun?
---
Only in cases where jagex fucked you. Like a false positive for botting. But they still ban you if it's your fuck up. I.e rwt
---
You are absolutely correct, however I kinda forgot to highlight the fact I’m a 1 defence pure and going back to Ape atoll after completing MM gives defence XP
---
It's sad but I honestly don't think I'd play without Runelite.. a bit like wow, I've never played that game without add-ons.
---
are you kidding me? I just bought the rune pouch yesterday...
---
I didn’t got banned
---
Runelite doesn't make any money. The client is completely open source and essentially developed and maintained by volunteers.
---
Sick combat bracelet cuties
---
I did? When did I ever say a word about PvP lol

only very few ironmen purchased the rune pouch with slayer points. most ironmen i knew boosted emblems for their rune pouch.

Well you have to wait for the update, which is prob not today buddy.

He was also threatened legally by jagex not so long ago so he probably wants to stay on their good side as much as possible

That is so poorly photoshopped but it's a good idea for A shirt
---
Seriously jagex, am i banned?   
---
Coz it's been hours i cant log in.   
---
Srsly, if i am banned. And swear to god, never have i ever botted on any of my accounts, you can even check the total networth of all my accounts and what i said matches, even if you check your database histories of my accounts it won't even surpass 20m. And if i am banned like this. For god knows what, then whatever. Good riddance to this addiction.
---
Jagex backpedalled insanely quickly after the community backlash.
---
Its only in the face of that that jagex focused in one specific element of the client instead of shutting down the client as a whole
---
So you have to manually check for the right door now wasting a lot of time? It's not worth doing anymore if so since runs will be cut in half at a minimum
---
&gt; some 
---
You mean all lol. I used to Mythic raid on WoW for years, if your RL finds out you're running w/o at the minimum dbm (most want bigwigs) you will not be raiding with them lol. DBM=Deadly Boss Mods, BigWigs is the same thing just better. These addons will give you the cd on when bosses do abilities and such. They used to be a lot more OP but blizz told the devs to nerf them or no more addons.
---
Yah, the meta is based around range rn. It’s good to train magic on some slayer monsters, and I’m sure there’s a boss out there that people use magic for. Magic is incredibly expensive tho, which defeats the purpose of bossing / slayer, which is to make money. Magic levels are really nice tho because it affects both magic accuracy and defense, and the spell you use affects the damage. Magic is pretty meta for wilderness PvP for sure.
---
Runelite is a lot more trustworthy than OSBuddy. Im with this guy
---
virgin elfboy vs chad scaper
---
It's actually a lot easier than I was expecting post-plugin removal.
---
Yeah it required slightly more thought than beforehand, but it's almost entirely a matter of counting to 3 and having decent switches.
---
But overlays are a big no no
---
Long ass time
---
still works with /range iirc. Set range to 5 or something and  just don't have the circle be red. The super OP stuff happened during the final wing of WoD (Hellfire). Addons legit did the fights for you, told you where to stand/etc.
---
The official polling site says that only Question 4 passed?  [http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/k=1/oldschool/results.ws?id=1577](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/k=1/oldschool/results.ws?id=1577)
---
Chat filter, use the redex to filter out phrases such as the spammer in this post or whatever you come across
---
I looked for it but can't remember where I saw it.  I want to say it was something they said on discord and I was seeing a screenshot of it.  Might've been on reddit, I only checked twitter.
---
Only the room nearest you, you can't scout on vanilla as the instance isn't on the world map.
---
In that case, it didn't happen as far as I'm concerned. But thank you for voicing you opinion.
---
Watching jagex freak out over a jagex minimap lmao
---
I'd suggest just alching anything profitable. Mildy click intensive but you make profit from it. If alching isn't your thing, I'd suggest splashing for a few days. Pretty afk.
---
Does this mean GWD timers like when bandos will spawn is bannedable to use?
---
You didn't answer the question:
---
Do you believe Jagex has the option to effectively tackle the bot spam problem but simply chooses not to?
---
PS: Existential = relating to existence. An existential threat therefore is a threat relating to the very existence of the game.
---
Agree, I think most people haven't even read the post because most seem to think left-click bank on bankers is banned.  
---
I have the opposite view on the barrows plugin, showing the door directly increases chests per hour when you can go straight to the right door and should be removed.   
---
The puzzle is actually dumb, both the plugin showing the answer but also how it works in vanilla. Because the interface closes when you get attacked and everything is agro you get attacked constantly so you have very little time to figure out the puzzle, even with the plugin I sometimes fail to click the green highlighted puzzle piece in time.     
---
Let the interface stay open when attacked and there is no reason for the plugin.  
---
Agree on freezing sire that would indeed make it more tedious but might be a case of consistency being more important to avoid confusion and grey areas.  
---
&gt; Modifies the menu options on worn/equipped items.  
---
Correct drakans medallion can't be one-click teleport, but that only applies when it's equipped not when in your inventory.  
---
I believe this is targeted at lava rune crafting where the speed and accuracy of clicking teleport on drop-down menus to duel arena and crafting guild is a major factor (maybe the biggest) of how much xp/h you get and also harder than not wasting ticks emptying pouches and crafting runes without MES or AHK
---
wat
---
Any reason you're not doing NMZ?
---
That sure is exactly what the blog says, isn't it
---
Didn't mentally link those two sections together for some reason, my bad
---
Oh, thanks for all the information, king. I will level up my ranged as well if it's this useful, because my  def level is same with my atk and str, people say i am not made for PvP and only other option is PvM. However i am not buying membership for a while so is it okay to not care about it that much as a f2p player?
---
What the fuck is wrong with you to target PKers with this one? This shit fails because of elitists, and because it was already offered by clients. PKers love moveable prayers because we constantly switch between accounts that can't use the piety tier prayers and those who can.
---
Between this and failing tradeable Rune Pouches, you cunts sink your own ship and then blame your favorite scapegoat.
---
That's gay
---
Ingame is the truth site isn't accurate.
---
100% heal in pvp? Thatll never get added
---
swap to autocasting blood burst/barrage and you should be able to sustain through it.
---
Manually marking a tile should still be good what is not allowed is plugins automatically and dynamically drawing tile markers based on certain criteria such as diffrent zulrah phases.
---
Hey!!
---
Everything you just said is wrong...
---
Ehgh fucking kill me, that was beyond annoying.
---
It looks to be holding up well.
---
PVP stands for players versus players,(ge pvp for example) we shitting on pkers
---
150 hours?
---
Why the fuck is jagex still so stupid and packs several important questions into one? Yeah I think it would be cool to have several looting bags or pouches but I dont want them to be tradable, that will just create another market for bots. smh they never learn
---
Yes, but as a result we should all be aware that Jagex's ban detection **does** throw out false positives, and if you don't happen to be a streamer then it will be **extremely** hard to recover your account as Jagex do not tell you how to appeal that ban.
---
Took me 9712 to get rex pet, was my last of the 3, was a nice afk safe spotting it and playing other games.
---
When it’s night in draynor
---
It seems you have bested me in this battle of wits. Well played, I concede.
---
What on earth are you alluding to?
---
use it
---
Damn, slayer already takes fuckin forever going to standard way. Gratz
---
The issue was dynamic tile markers. Automatic indications of where the Vorkath fireball would land, for instance. In your image it would be like the tile marker appearing automatically to show exactly where to run to next to shoot while still hiding behind the shield.
---
Outside of the end of tier bosses mythic raiding really isn't that challenging.
---
are you replying to the wrong comment?
---
it's on the wiki page for Rocky.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rocky
---
Jagex just never thinks about crap like this, they just think "yeah lets pack it all into one question"
---
Ayyy I was just there! I got like 100k in holiday items before he left
---
I wouldn't have downvoted, even though you literally couldn't be more wrong, but this:
---
&gt;Edit: damn this sub is rough. Getting downvoted for stating a fact. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Made me downvote :-D
---
&gt;most real men i knew 
---
ftfy
---
Fremmy rings really do not need a buff in any way shape or form.
---
problem is the client has too much power and what 3rd party clients can do is far more than what addons for WoW or ESO can do.
---
the way WoW was built made it so that any addon can be made immediately defunct if deemed too powerful. they did this with a few features of DBM before that helped people figure out their proximity with other players, or something like that. they did it recently with WoW classic that just remade the LFG/dungeon finder.
---
Jagex would need to completely rewrite their client in a way that would either offer what RuneLite offers and then ban any 3rd party clients like runescape 3 does, or find a way to make it so only officially sanctioned clients will be allowed and not just immediately ban you. but all of this is a stretch, and that is a lot easier said than done. rs3 literally rewrote their client from scratch in a new language which consisted of a ton of engine work, server side code work, and a brand new client. it took over a year to make and it's been 3 years and still runs into problems.
---
$11 for this
---
TBF, I doubt most players realized it either. I don't recall it coming up in any discussions, but there were a lot of players talking about the Rune Pouch so making it tradeable either came from or in response to players.
---
This is why you have no friends my guy, stop holding so much animosity toward people. Welcome to my block list.
---
Yeah pretty much this comment right here. Just because I have a certain amount of money, doesn’t mean I can spend it all on candy. The development team is small and has a small budget. They are trying to balance new content with an ever complaining fanbase that believe it’s all possible at the same time. 
---
Imagine if they only revealed that the client was gonna be updated on RuneFest and no other content. How would that be recieved? 
---
And also, they are developers that also want to enjoy their job. If we are requesting them to only sit and do engine work and not allow them to use their creativity on new content, most likely more people would quit.
---
Why doesn't jagex just communicate with the runelite peeps and flat out tell them which plug ins are against the rules and to be removed from the RL client?    RL already released a statement acknowledging this crackdown and even disabled a few existing plugins
---
This video is sponsored by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
---
Then so is 50% of the playerbase, because the majority of people playing this game are fucking bots..
---
Imagine if he did sheep herder
---
I voted no to rune pouch tradeable and yes to reduce its slayer cost.
---
Untradeable rewards make a grind feel worth it and more fun. 
---
I honestly didn't  think about PvP.
---
Voted yes on looting bag because the way you get them is just killing low lvl wilderness monsters for 5 minutes which is rather pointless. No satisfaction in having that as an untradeable.
---
Do they still have them? They said it was ongoing.
---
this lmfaoooo
---
Cursed goblin bow l0l
---
He deleted his post, mission accomplished.
---
Just saying we all fine with pvp updates -bounty hunter, LMS etc.But we are spite voting anything that buffs or help pkers into the dirt for our own benefits.
---
What? Botting and RWT literally fucked that game hard
---
Nahh sheep barber is much harder
---
Enchant bolts for super quick xp.
---
Not surprised it's purple after all - the best color
---
Sure mate, keep telling yourself that to make yourself feel better. lmao
---
*insert baby crying noise*
---
This is such a clusterfuck, are they just going to keep adding ambiguous rules for specific inputs and actions that can be modified?
---
They should focus on creating their own customisable client which they can monitor and police to their hearts content.
---
Besides, I'm fairly confident they can't monitor or track this with enough consistency to warrant a ban.
---
Same reason Linux is still going strong. People are bros.
---
I was too busy with my magic to pick any drops up 😂
---
oh I saw a video of that guy getting banned!!!  so he did get unbanned??? good
---
That wasnt my reasnon for voting no. I voted no because what this essentially would do is make it so slayer point effectively have a real tangible value and i don't really like the idea of that. i said yes to the looting bag just not the rune pouch.
---
But what about the other private clients and add-ons for more plugins. Its not hard to find these if you want to. And no they cannot find things that doesn't require data output from the client to the server. Its like saying they can see that you take a picture with your phone of the RuneScape screen. They can't.
---
Thanks for the feedback - I'll talk to the team and see what other players think about this spot.
---
It is hilarious how uninformed people are. The reddit echo chamber is incredibly strong when everyone cries OSB.
---
If only you knew about the other, lesser known, clients that do so *so* much more than OSB / RL. Yes, there are multiple other clients ranging from private for personal use to larger communities - that go unnoticed to the reddit hive mind.
---
There are clients out there running with all features that has ever been requested removed from OSB / RL. Want Zulrah helper than was removed years ago? It's available. Want gorilla plugin that was removed recently? It's available. Why are people so hell-bent on burning OSB?
---
All clients try to stay competitve with each other. When one client has something and Jagex doesn't shut it down the others have to follow suit. OSB merely brought the underground plugins to the surface for the general public to see.
---
You are kidding yourself if you think removing OSB solves anything.
---
That would mean that runepouches drop on pk-deaths, dropping the price significantly
---
If you look close the doors you can use to get into the chest room are slightly lighter in colour than the ones you cant. Bit like how it always is in cartoons.
---
J Mod crowns would complete this.
---
What would the filter be based on though, sometimes you do want to use lower level prayers, such as mystic might over augury at Scorpia. (If not flicking of course.)
---
That can be avoided if there are untradeable essence you get which provide some sort of other advantage, like better rc xp when used
---
We won’t get our points back. Probably be too difficult to do something like that. BUT wasn’t there a pole about being able to acquire a second rune pouch? All hope is not lost.
---
I suppose that's a fair point. I voted as if it was asking the second question the first time around.
---
When you care more about Bought capes and 3rd Party clients rather than Botting/False positive Bans
---
That's some great progress in a year! Keep it up :)
---
To any programmers/CS in the comments - - is it realistic with a solid team to actually code a effective bot detection system? Sir Pugger makes it seem like they will always be a step ahead. TIA
---
Why wouldn't you? They're nice people.
---
Doesn’t make it fair that Jagex didn’t consider this scenario.
---
Roasting a Youtuber =/= Roasting every single pker
---
As a non native english speaker who started playing english rs worlds at some point, I never understood the difference between lending and borrowing. Like, it confused me when people spammed "borrowing ags" and I traded them, expecting an ags for me, and both just put up coins.
---
Osbuddy owner was a jmod and the CEO of automatron and jagex have been the same people at different times.
---
Loving that Sire is definitely more niched than rune pouches and looting bags, and a fair amount people who probably don’t do Sire actually skipped the question rather than voting no!
---
I voted no for one sole reason. Now i may be wrong about this but afaik atm you can have more than one pouch, with different runes in them. If that question passed, they were also going to make it so multiple copies of rune pouches shared the same inventory, making multiple rune pouches worthless.
---
They never said anything about player made markers, just about ones that automatically tell you where to stand based on attacks or timing
---
That’s where I misinterpreted
---
"if youre gay" was available or something on the line of that, but ive went with "Where r you"
---
I'm not even a PKer and I wanted the rune pouch to pass. Wtf
---
Yeah it's easy now with elvui and twitch program
---
That's fair man. I'm not trying to argue with you, I was just explaining my viewpoint. 
---
Yeah any updated number would be helpful. Hopefully Lottie comes through.
---
Let’s get this name release going! It sucks to search for a ton of names only to see all occupied by crazy low lvl accounts holding to the names to be sold.
---
Not really. Flipping was a thing before this data was available. The only reason you require it right now is because if you didn’t use it you would be at a disadvantage compared to people who do
---
I feel like I'm forced to do it but an extra kill per hour is nice
---
How are you attempting inferno without understanding basic game mechanics lol.
---
Only semi related but last month I was in a pvp world watching fights and decided I was gonna gear up for NMZ the next day and go to bed. It was like 2am and i was exhausted. Geared up in like 30m of gear with my entire 45m cash stack in my inventory. It took me so long to gear, I was half asleep and I was in a deserted bank so I totally forgot I was in pvp. I teled straight to Varrock square thinking I’d log out in Zaff’s for the easy staffs in the morning and appear right there in the middle of a bunch of brid fights with no food or teles or anything IN A PVP WORLD. 
---
I thankfully realised JUST as I teled in and instantly logged out before I could get TBed. But that’s why people a) camp teleport spots and b) kill everyone on sight.
---
Seriously I saw a post a month ago about how you could get a pouch for $200k if you get a t10 and trade it for a rune pouch RoW scrolls. Now I have to pay 1.5M or 750 Slayer points? That's bullshit.
---
That would require thinking. People don’t like thinking these days they’d rather have the client tell them
---
Just did the same. Amazing art OP!
---
Great idea.
---
Suddenly $11.10. 
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
i played both tekken and starcraft at a high level so ill probably do that in my sleep
---
It was on Star Augur, I remember it. They removed it from DBM and players simply just made a weak aura that mimicked the same thing and Blizzard didn’t do anything.
---
Don't forget that Jagex only let you buy it for 1.5m temporarily while the BH rework is in beta.
---
Should i worry about rl telling me where to stand when doing a clue scroll?
---
A friend of mine who I wont rat out had a cape done for him in person at a lan event 
---
He hasn't been detected because how would you ever do so obviously.
---
More relevantly I've heard of people doing these capes over screen share software (surprised that works with lag but whatever) 
---
Are Jagex gonna just hammer anyone doing it successfully first try
---
Depends which ones you use.
---
Well get to it. It's a VR game so no buttons.
---
Plugins should definitely require jagex approval before being added to any client.  There should be a list of approved plugins rather than banned plugins.
---
You could do same thing as other non cheaters do
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
click to booth?
---
They were renting the ability to scam
---
Read the post
---
&gt; be me
---
&gt; hop on to osrs for the first time in years
---
&gt; my client has an update, which makes sense, it's been a long time
---
&gt; client finished update, now it's just a message that says "[client name] has deprecated and is no longer being updated. Use of this client can lead to a ban. Please download the official client at osrs.game"
---
&gt; phew, dodged a bullet there
---
Have you been using OSM in your maths class instead of paying attention?
---
One day a guy came up to me near the fight caves and traded me. I’m not sure why, but I accepted. He put a blue party hat up to lend. I’m sorry, but what. These bitches go for 2b easy and I didn’t even have a 2m bank.  I was happy as could be seeing something so expensive on my character.
---
I thought nieve was a guy
---
Osrs good, now upvote this comment, i need karma
---
trade limit increased with quests didn't it
---
Yea but the idea is when jagex comes out with statements like this, at least runelite will actually take the plugin completely out of the client. For example, they completely removed the demonic gorilla's plugin after the first official statement that said you couldnt use plugins that told you what to pray and when. So I think that's maybe where jagex is coming from. If they specifically say a certain plugin is against the rules, then runelite can just remove the plugin entirely so nobody can use it.
---
Way to ruin the joke
---
Because it's the exact same as account sharing but that's not bannable when it doesn't provide a competitive advantage.
---
nsfw version plz
---
This isn't that lol
---
Ty for doing what is expected and only a year late
---
Some of the opposition is because of the fact that the rune pouch would access the same inventory. 
---
There were people in my CC who voted against it because the only use they had for multiple rune pouches would be having different loadouts like a teleporting setup, a barraging setup,  a raiding setup, etc
---
King, thank you for appreciating my opinion on the subject we are debating. It means a lot to me that another human being accepts what I have to offer to society as far as opinions go, I hope we can keep sharing our points of view of the game we all love, through this forum system.  
---
\- Chief
---
Obviously you died afterwards. Have fun rebuilding lolol
---
Look at all these 'experts'. 90% of them probably never even attempted inferno.. Or just had their capes removed by Jamflex.   
---
@OP This was an honest mistake bro. Shit like that happens when you're grinding this hellhole for weeks... Don't sweat, you've got this!
---
Currently at 1502 kc
---
no, im saying that they should be tradable
---
Exactly!  They are getting a competitive advantage so should be banned
---
Other side of the room?  Are you retarded? It's no more than 10 tiles away.  If you're that whiny about training the easiest skill in the game do wines or myths guild. I read what you wrote and provided a counter argument. Gtfo
---
Flipping would be more profitable without it because it would actually take an 8th of a brain to do and there wouldn’t be a ton of noobs jumping on the easy flips making the margins super tiny
---
I'm guessing this was hinting towards the theatre of blood maze auto-solver and op shit like that.
---
They did yes
---
You're deluding yourself if you think the Infernal cape is the one true achievement. It's just a matter of committing the time to learning the Inferno and then all it takes is one successful attempt. The Infernal cape has **nothing** on the Max cape as an achievement.
---
I would bet anything that every active player in the game (even the brainlets) could get the cape in less than a third the time it takes to max. This includes the time to grind out the GP to brute force your way through it with absolute max gear.
---
hey I tried reaching you on Twitter but you ghosted me - heh. any news about the ubuntu repo update where you fixed the outdated lib?
---
*gobbles down 50k in supplies*
---
"That's pure profit!"
---
Ah, yeah that would make sense.
---
This is true. I guess I'll just have to margin check before selling now
---
Probably an alt stacking
---
"appeals to extremes" is also an easy fallacy to fall into.
---
Check the date 😱
---
"cheating is easier and more enjoyable so it's fair"
---
We fought the good battle
---
Agreed, they wont comply with any of Jagex new rules and just moved all the OP plugins to a "beta"
---
Just don't lose it in the first place
---
autoclicking alch huh :thinking:
---
gottem :\^)
---
Yikes, condolences
---
What the fireball always lands where you were standing who needs that
---
Thats the current best method, but try timing your demon butler and oak dungeon doors with it. Its significantly more difficult than using a mouse+keyboard
---
Wat.jpg
---
Vanilla runelite is fine. The admins of it removed any feature that jagex requested to be removed.
---
I'm obviously not the dev, but from what I've been reading RL had a lot of back and forth with Jagex over these last few weeks proceeding this blog post, and so I think it would be fair to assume that anything that is still in RL has been cleared by jagex.
---
Level 5 enchanting 😉
---
I think playing the game on mobile in general is significantly more difficult than playing on pc
---
I think competitive leaderboards. Capes have been out for ages now and people were banned right at the start.
---
Legit got one of those for christmas and it straight up broke from my first plate of spaghetti. Jagex'd. This why we need runelite to create an osrs fork.
---
You're mentally challenged. No one is going to run 10 tiles back and forth to train cooking. You're still deflecting the entire point, so I'm done. Don't waste your time responding because I've already RES tagged you to make sure I don't accidentally read anything else you type.
---
As a casual player, who really only plays by himself a few hours a week, seems crazy to me how quickly RS threatens banning people. Do you not want me to pay for your game? 
---
What’s next? Banning quest guides?
---
I wish they did this with firecapes back in the day.
---
Lmao hes not, he shits his pants when fighting Odablock.
---
Change the second one to banned
---
What?
---
Nice.
---
Ah, the classical wand bash.
---
Thank you
---
🦀🦀 reddit is powerless against the idea of enjoying fortnite 🦀🦀
---
He probably bots. Something I've learned over the years from the osrs community, is that those who defend botters are 99.99% botting themselves. And they always get caught, then bitch saying they never botted in their whole life.
---
That's kinda why Swampletics is so popular TBH
---
Last time I saw, they now let you buy it from Slayer Masters for GP
---
iirc I used to do this when I was like 12 years old and trick my friends into thinking I was a magician by opening doors from 15 metres away
---
0.1$ per few days. Rish boi
---
You can also get it for 1,250 slayer points
---
on runelite look up “stretched fixed mode” if you mess with the settings you can play full screen fixed mode, it’s what i do. such a game changer
---
How is it any different then it is now?
---
I didn’t mean IRL money lol
---
It is yes....
---
Just because it takes longer doesn't mean it's necessarily more challenging
---
I used to shit my pants when the shades would show up from burying bones. I just want to train my prayer!!
---
STOP SPEAKING TRUTH. IF I DIDN'T READ THE BLOG, IM NOT GOING TO READ THIS REEEEE
---
illiterate pleb downvotes incoming
---
Not to be rude - but being a CPA doesn’t necessarily make you business minded. 
---
OSRS has been around a long time as far as games and software goes - and although the client is dated and bad, it’s an integral part of the experience of what OSRS for many people. For lots of users, if they updated to a new client it would lose the feel and identity of what is OSRS. Don’t piss off your existing clients. OSRS already has almost no curb appeal for anyone who hasn’t played RS before, and if they took away what made it feel like the OG I’d be lost. I came back because it was exactly as I remembered it (mostly). If there was a client update I’d be fucking lost and wouldn’t feel as inclined to learn the janky system all over again. 
---
Also, a third party client buy-out would result in an increase of third party development which is not what Jagex wants, not only because people will cheat but also for security of its users and also the company pride. Generally, buying out a company because they made something better for your game than you did yourself isn’t going to impress any investor about your internal development team and leadership team. If they need a new client, why didn’t leadership identify this and have one made sooner internally?
---
My guess is on any employee with enough technical knowledge like devs not having much say in those decisions.
---
What about pvm bossing?
---
I think an item valie limit would be necessary for weapons/armour.  Cosmetics dont really matter.
---
You sound angry, you just get pked for your spade?
---
All other clients would Wireshark it and have the secret message reverse engineered before the grace period was over.
---
🍴$11🍴
---
Huh how would item prices go up because of lending?
---
The game is different now there aren’t an abundance of noobs that can’t afford whips. I feel all this would lead to is people who don’t have gear being able to raid/boss effectively and item prices drastically falling cause so many more entering the game
---
I remember when I got my hands on a rune halberd. I'd spend so much time in Ardougne because due to the sheer number of mobs and walls that you can kill them from behind. One day I was killing the hero over a fence and buried the bones he dropped. A shade random appeared and I proceeded to kill it over the fence. Got a shade robe top from it.
---
Back in my day 40k was worth too much to round up that far!
---
*shatters hip*
---
Zalcano is the least intensive. Zulrah is great at your level and the better your gear the better vorkath is
---
Vorkath
---
The iron men aren't saying btw and it's ruining my immersion.
---
Imagine putting a top tier pvmer who is arguably the greatest inferno runner in the entire game in the same bracket as the average player.
---

---
I just looked into this and under their bsd license it seems you don't actually have to publish the source code if you fork it and change it
---
60k in rs2 = ~250k in osrs
---
Changing the setting to right click on tab helps.  Could be better but it helps
---
you’re off your fuckin rocker mate, this is hands down some of the best art ive seen on here
---
I didn't say that, but I don't disagree that it's a useful feature that doesn't hinder the game's integrity. I'll gladly play without any plugins Jagex disapproves of. There has been plenty of great updates that have failed polls; not to mention passing the polling system isn't based on the majority of opinion.
---
Pink clay has already stated he’s more than confident his buyers won’t be banned. 
---
I’d imagine these are people being banned for using gold selling sites services etc.
---
You can’t detect team viewer. And even if you could somehow through the client, you wouldn’t suddenly learn how to months later, it would be a matter of finding the dual IP as it is currently occurring.
---
&gt;Are Jagex gonna just hammer anyone doing it successfully first try
---
More or less, yeah. Jagex has the means to distinguish alts, so as long as they rule that out it's a safe bet that anyone beating the Inferno in one try is illegitimate.
---

---
I have 0 thermo smoke devil KC, and now have doubled up on the dragon drops here. I think you get what I'm saying. And the title literally says without head.
---
3 is bigger than 2 so almost was used correctly here, and don't go stretching out the scale to say is 300 almost 500 or something.
---
Did you just downvote me for pointing that out? Big yikes.
---
You claimed the rune pouch becoming tradable would reduce its price even though it has no price because it isn’t tradable...
---
Yeah, let's make a client that doesn't even have a fucking built in calculator the offical client
---
Double wrath talisman drop is pretty good, at 650 ea that's 1.3k you didn't have before.
---
It’s wild.

They actually think this is believable.

---
Some say after reaching 200m prayer he still trains it to this day.
---
Depends what you like, if you like killing zulrah, then go for it.. but on the other hand if u like killing vorki more, than don't hesitate.. but from other side , if zalcano is your favourite activity, then there is no reason no to do it.
---
I believe once you’re caught, you get put on some kind of watch. Someone who earned their cape after it was removed for buying one got it accidentally removed a second time. I also remember reading some time ago about how they prioritize trying to get the seller’s information. Like selling/buying gold, they think targeting the source is better and give minor punishments (if any) to the buyer. The whole punishment system needs to be reworked in my opinion, but I’m sure that will come after the security update.
---
Oh shit, Inkvember coming up tomorrow?
---
They can still know. If you've never done Inferno before and then you suddenly kill Zuk on your first try, that's pretty obvious evidence that you cheated it.
---
Looks like you've got to make yourself a new main and surrender your entire account to her to keep the peace.
---
That's just your supply cost lol
---
It would take too long to make a new account for nearly every video. Why **shouldn't** he borrow accounts?
---
The only thing that makes it illegal, or against TOS, is faking the giveaway (which I’m certain they do).A
---
the rune pouch isn't tradeable, you can only buy them with points. you can't sell the one's you have. it's a gold sink not an economy.
---
I don't get it.
---
2 week ban, pets, kc, and tasks removed.
---
2 week ban, pets, kc, and task removed.
---
Glad they don’t, I make 12m per fire cape job.
---
This has to be bait.
---
This is bad logic, from a meta view.  
---
"Even if you remove a Big Bad thing, Small Bad things still exist. It changes nothing."
---
My last post was deleted because I didn’t follow up with a comment including a capital D.
---
Really, OSRS mods?
---
Don’t worry. Once you get a task you will wish you had not gotten it
---
Jagex didn't mention when they would remove it but I just decided to buy one for 1.5m. it just sucks because I could have saved 1m if I got one before the 18th.
---
ouch surely its possible to welfare albeit extremely difficult lmao
---
But why is that right?  Why are they treated differently?  If a top lvl player account shared so someone train fletching post 200m utterly pointlessly you could still get banned for acc sharing by being at the leaderboards.  Mid-high lvl account who has paid for a cape to give them advantage don't get banned despite presumably having enough evidence that they cheated to get something that gives an advantage.
---
Ma’am, I’d just like a slayer task, please.
---
This post was deleted 
---
Find the new on in my profile
---
Let’s be real. None of these plugins are going to get you banned. The day Jagex has an actual 100% sure way of figuring out who is using it will be the same day they actually have an updated and usable client. The only thing they will do is drive players to more obscure/dodgy clients with actual OP plugins and in turn make the issue much worse. Once Jagex sends them legal papers in a year to take down non-abiding clients you will see a 10-15% in players I imagine.
---
Yes, chat box.
---
If people are borrowing items instead of buying them, that means the demand for buying the item goes down and the supply of the item goes up. This would cause the price of whips to go down, not up.
---
&gt; The Infernal cape has nothing on the Max cape as an achievement.
---
Apples to oranges. Infernal cape is about technical skill and gameplay mastery, max cape is about time investment and patience. Both are huge accomplishments in their own way.
---
Lol why on earth would jagex bother trying to control bots when they make up a sizeable chunk of their membership profits
---
What a kill time.....
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
I didn't really get to enjoy the lending system much. If the item lending function was more flexible and allowed us to have a guild chest instead, our circle of friends wouldn't have quit in 2008, since we pooled all of our resources into a spreadsheet.
---
That's what he suggested as anti cheat, I didn't comment on how effective it would be, he described code signing so I linked the wiki.
---
Yeah but how long before you can't do it anymore, cause surely you'll level your cb up as you said and then it won't be able to work anymore
---
Petition to ban any and all 3pc users!
---
Runelite is an opensource community project
---
I think as long as you are only allowed to have one lended weapon or armor on you at a time it wouldn’t be that bad especially if paying someone to borrow their weapon. I bet prices would very depending on the item that was being lended.
---
Someone is salty that they got their cape removed
---

this \^\^\^\^\^ people would borrow them to appear wealthy to assist in lures.

Require more validation during acc creation is a start
---
i meant emblem farming bots that make money out of nowhere.
---
I had a friend who botted tons of his skills to 99 while attempting max. He also had a sorc garden bot to make money.
---
He never got banned on any account. I know this is RS3 but the point remains. Tons of people not to really high levels, or even to max, and don't get caught. It seems like if you're really casual and smart about Botting you're less likely to get caught.
---
No reply yet makes me think OP was like "Wait, oh yeah oops lol".
---
Judging by the fact he usually puts out 1 vid a day, he defo did inferno himself.  He's a great player, means he can adapt quick enough. I love pan1c, he's an AWESOME content creator and a monster of a pker, but when he bashed that update that really didn't matter or impact him, it ticked me off.  Glad he abstained from voting on topics he wasn't educated on which made me continue to respect him at the end of the day.
---
Skybox is ❤️
---
&gt; even if it makes some grognards unhappy
---
No one cares about these sweaty twitter neckbeards. It's a wonder how they can even tolerate playing OSRS when the entire community despises them.
---
Oh nice I didn't know any of that thank for the info bro
---
Pretty sure anyone that uses teamviewer is safe
---
In regards to your last point: 
---
Loot is not visible to someone who wasn’t logged in to the world at the time it was dropped. 
---
If you log out of the world before it appears on the ground for you, it will never appear
---
Same, had osb pro sub for ~4 years
---
Reading only the title, i wonder whi would win? Id normally have my money on zulrah and his snaklings, but zulrah and vork cant hold a pick axe so i think zalcano would win this match.
---
You're welcome.
---
Seriously??
---
Depends if they paid extra for it to be done through teamviewer as that way is pretty safe
---
Jagex disliked that idea.
---
Undead chicken is tradable? TIL.
---
Got my first one at 2200 800 on task, gz OP now block them lol
---
You get transported when mem runs out I think. Not when you log in without it.
---
I know the feel, did the same when I did ds2. Bought the lance and went to town
---
It’s definitely a yikes. I’m not sure if it’s RWT.
---
Tile markers in wow are used to communicate location and coordinate movement for 10-30 people. Tile Markers in RS aren't.

I agree that it *should* be done. 
---
People (who don't know how it works) will often look at a problem and say "cmon jamflex, it's an easy fix, just do it, you never listen to us, *incoherent screeching*"
---
When it comes to engine updates, the general measure is player satisfaction / dev resources used. Stuff like this simply won't make the cut until the demand increases or the list gets smaller.
---
The third party clients are cheating in many cases. Calling it QoL is disingenuous and it just hurts your cause.  Jag ex created this problem by having no policy for so long and giving third party clients free reign.  They have to do something and now since a vast number of the player base has gotten accustomed to these clients there will be painful transition. 
---
Noone cares if you're readjusting your ui with clients to customize your play experience. We want the cheating to stop.
---
I don't do any pking so the freeze timer means very little to me.
---
All the other qol is so nice though, it'd be a shame not to have it. I play a decent bit of mobile because it's awesome to have the game on the go, but you best believe if I am playing on pc I won't use the original client
---
This reminded me of the Lil Dicky lyric from Pillow Talking lmao
---
Good day sir, we can see that you died and lost your gear and while we can understand by never having played the game that this is a very stressful scenario.  There is nothing we can do, however have you considered using the prayer protect items to lessen your loss, or perhaps a ring of life to gain additional HP?  
---
We at jagex feel that we could and should help the player base understand mechanics so we'll provide you ways to get it back.
---
You can purchase pest control armor on pest control island which is a mini game, you can teleport there for FREE! Using the minigame tab.
---
We hope this helps you, and if in doubt create a new character and try again!
---
Also your account has been banned for third party client usage.
---
This is not appealable.

Please do not reply to this mail as this mailbox does not receive replies.

But why is that a problem for a rune pouch (comes from pvp) but not anything that comes from pvm lol
---
even pvm experience isn't a deciding factor. I know 2 people who no-lifed a pserver for a couple weeks to learn inferno without wasting supplies. got it first try ingame and they are both shit at PvM lol
---
Yes you can.
---

---
So no head?
---
Well i had more than that in the supplies i just used to kill the fucker.
---
Shit, I went back to sleep and never did herbs. When choosing an herb, look up a calculator like the one on the wiki. Input stats, check the magic secateurs box and ultracompost. For now, choose a seed you can grow that has good profit and a low seed cost (not ranarr/ snapdragon). Buy some seeds and some ultracompost. You can buy a bunch of the compost and store it at a tool leprechaun and take it out when needed. You can bring it to him noted and then withdraw it noted. Look up all the herb patches, see what ones you have unlocked and can get to reasonably quickly, and note how to get to them. 
---
Getting ready for your run: grab seeds and transportation methods from bank. Go to first patch, withdraw rake, seed dibber, spade, magic secateurs, and enough ultracompost for the entire run. NOTE, EQUIP YOUR MAGIC SECATEURS OR THEY ARE USELESS. MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN YOUR HAND WHENEVER YOU'RE HARVESTING. Rake patch, plant seed, compost patch, move on. On subsequent runs, you will click the patch to harvest, plant seed, compost patch, optionally clean herbs if desired, and use herbs on leprechaun to note them. Also neat little tip, spam click the herb patch for the first 5 ticks or do and you'll harvest at double the rate, 2 herbs per 3 ticks instead of 1/3.
---
Notes on compost: there's 3 tiers of compost. Each makes it less likely plants will die, and give higher yields. If you get less than 6 herbs when you harvest, you forgot to ultracompost. Ultra is the highest tier and straight up the best for every situation except mayyyybe Fe btw. Use it anywhere it can increase yields and anywhere you can't/ don't want to pay protection. However, realize some plants will still die sometimes, even if you're good at remembering compost. 
---
This is really good money and how I maintain bonds. 8 patch snapdragon runs regularly make me 200k-300k and last around 10 mins if I'm paying attention. Add in some other plants (happy to elaborate if you want) and I'm usually making 350k-450k per trip. Do that twice a day and you're sailing
---
The article is the wiki entry to code signing, which for all intents and purposes is what signing off code would be....
---
It'd be an argument of dev time.
---
(almost) Nobody would disagree with a toggleable setting that is off by default
---
Why is botting worse?
---
I’m not only talking about the freeze timer I’m talking about any timer, overlay or anything that does the thinking for you. The community is reliant on it and without it you’re clueless. You won’t use the official client because 3rd party clients are available for use so why wouldn’t you use them? If they were somehow completely banned and you only had the option to play on the official client would you quit? If so that’s really sad
---
It honestly feels like they gave up on them. Either that or the bot detection is absolutely horrible.
---
Noticed this the other day. Really fantastic fix.
---
How do the cannonballs not give you ranged xp?
---
go play w45.. 20 online at low peak hours L0L
---
The bond price is pretty much an indicator of inflation rs3 bonds are like 20m or something
---
The cake is a lie
---
I completely disagree
---
Buying out something because it’s better is something that happens all the time. Google buys new startups all the time. If someone made something better for your game buying but and making it like if it was your own merit is good.
---
No and that wouldn't cause a run to walk instead anyway. Walk = 1 tile per tick. Run = 2 tiles per tick. You shouldn't be able to move only one tile when you have run on and click two tiles away.
---
My bad, I misread the initial comment as he had done 1 fire cape in his life and now just happens to have an Infernal cape, not that he's completed 1 fire and 1 Infernal.

You’d need to update your engine to get native functionality that runelite and similar provide. So it’s not just “ADD CLIENT FEATURES LOL”.

I mean they aren’t small but I’m not going to call them sausage fingers either lol
---
Not being able to organize your UI to your liking is pretty stinky imho but then again it would devalue some achievements which is the real evil here
---
Thanks for the support but I'm not sure this would really help anything if it could/did happen. I am convinced if Jagex management made it a priority to run their own RL fork they could (presumably they need to hire the right people, which takes money) and I am trying to push them into that direction.
---
That it isn't handed to you on a silver-plate
---
If he’s used roughly 1000 cannonballs and 1000 fishing explosives that means he must’ve used the ring of recoil to get the mogre down to significant hp and then finish it off with ~1 cannonball. 
---
Guessing OP has gained range xp just not enough for lvl 2
---
I never used reordering prayers. I'm not really sure of the uses of reordering the prayer book, honestly. Spellbook reordering/icon resizing is a much more essential feature IMO.
---
The second one
---
Making the abyssal whip a crush weapon?
---
One point per kill, right? That sucks it looks like.
---
thats Mercy from overwatch, isnt it
---
oh lol, I expected it to be a feature
---
Every one plays 5 rune drag alts at the same time as their main, what do you expect.
---
local man eats food
---
If tile markers are still allowed you could technically run through wildy and mark the border yourself. Of all the things to consider overpowered, a tool to help you memorize where the border lies doesn't seem like a big deal. If for some reason tile markers become disallowed in wildy, you could also run through there and memorize the tiles yourself lol.
---
no one said it was difficult
---
The seed isn’t really that useful, maybe if your going for 200m mining or whatever you choose to put the tool seed on, it boosts the speed of mining by 3%  faster than the dpick, do not worth 10m for 3% imo.
---
I think if you have higher mining and a special pickaxe you should be able to get better essence that gives more runes or more xp. Perhaps the pickaxe could be hard to get or make the essence untradeable so bots couldn't farm.
---
Where exactly is the smooth textures plugin?
---
Have they made the same change with for example long press on GE clerk/banker? with loads of people there all you can see is the stack of names and no options to interact with the banker/clerk are visible
---
Actually it's locked behind a quest so you'd need to complete all the quest
---
Its simple if you listend to what others said on the internet you would have commited suicide in about 5 minsnof playing any online game
---
You could ban cheat clients and maybe detect people not using the approved client? I'm not sure if this is possible.
---
I suppose updating the existing essence would be less work than creating something new.
---
Yeah it's free real estate.
---
What is boosting?
---
Abyssal beads
---
Did you use quest guides on your computer? If so it’s not mobile only
---
I had no idea they dropped super combat pots. Gz dude

i mean you can get pretty good xp/hr with 65+ stats wearing full obby and at least u dont have to run to reset aggro lol

Oh I'm sorry I actually only did the first example so I didn't see that part yet.

the reddit concept of Runescape
---
Working on the main client help preserve new players and new content help keep long term sustaining player and that seemed more important to Jagex

That has not been my experience. Never been ticketed and done it in front of cops plenty

The guy has been doing this for months now.

Think as a new player bro, don't know where to find chickens. Don't know where to find cows. How do you know where you can buy a bucket? These cows that I actually did find won't let me milk them, only able to attack them. Where is the mill? How do I know she is there to teach me? Where do I buy a pot. You are still being ignorant and not thinking about it from the perspective of a BRAND NEW player. Not YOU with clearly thousands of hours of experience, but BRAND NEW, never played before.
---
2017*
---
because hair is wrong
---
Thanks. After some testing, I can say this is definitely the case. Mystery solved.
---
That was legit the dumbest comparison lol. A game to reality. Let's keep it at game level. You rwt to your main, main gets banned and alts don't. Explain?
---
I’d also think botting has more effects to the game, such as changing the economy for better or for worse, than a couple more people having the BiS melee cape.
---
What? You don't pay undead chickens to get Ava's accumulator
---
They could sell the QoL as new content. Just release it as a major QoL/client update and people will lap it up.
---
It isn’t as bad at botting lmao stop over reacting
---
You need to go to the OSBuddy discord and type ?beta in the #bots channel.

Then you get access.

Nah mate, it may look like the place you put a straw in, but it definitely doesn't hurt like it.

Lmfao at this interaction
---
Someone did some math on another post and counting the seconds wasted per hit per kill were over 2 hours wasted. Plus the time I’ll save not waiting to stun him again. I’m excited for any change honestly.
---
Lmao love this
---
If you bought the lance then no you do not know the feel
---
&gt;Because the quote i provided earlier seems to state just that. If a rule can't be enforced, it shouldn't be a rule. How is that any different?
---
Because laws against theft **CAN** be enforced, and very frequently are. There is a massive difference between a rule being 100% unenforceable and not being able to catch everyone.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
&gt;This issue has to be addressed, even if it's enforcement isn't currently reliable.
---
This is where I take issue. It's not that the enforcement isn't reliable, it's that it quite literally does not exist. They cannot enforce this rule against a single person because they physically cannot detect something as simple as screen markers.
---
This is a forum for runescape discussion, if you have a problem with the state of the average population take your complaints elsewhere

Couldn't it be the BH pkers voting no to making rune pouches tradable so they can keep the prices of other BH rewards high?
---
Lofi beats = life
---
Oops its been years since i made/used mine thought it was 50 for maul
---
This belongs in rs3. Not hating, it's a creative idea. But not one that fits the osrs model imo.
---
i was 7 hours away from bank pin activation lol
---
If the item becomes tradeable you'll drop it on death no?
---
I'm not sure why people who use RL even think this is a good idea, and I don't mean from a business standpoint. I mean from the stepping that, if Jagex did "buy" RL and make it the official client, you can bet your ass one of two things would happen.
---
Either A. They'd go through the entire plug-in list with a fine-toothed comb and remove a BUNCH of them (including some of you fav """QoL""" plug-ins).
---
Or B. They'd poll the return of EVERY plug-in, and then you'd STILL lose plug-ins to them failing in the polls.
---
In either case, you're losing out. Keeping RL unofficial is in your interest if you actually want to keep plug-ins that would likely be be removed if Jagex took over.
---
no more updates it takes too much dev time
---
What about server lag :?
---
The changes are welcomed for sure, but that sounds like a &lt;5% time save.
---
Hopefully you get the pet soon and it isn't an issue!
---
This is absolutely wrong. They explicitly stated any menu entry swapping is bannable.
---
Even if 10% of the post obtained capes that were legit were off task, why punish them. Just because 9/10 runite miners are bots, they don't punish the 1 that's legit.
---
And it's actually not hard for them to determine which ones were on/off task, mod even confirmed it in Twitter they can see all on task obtained capes.
---
And some people progress and decide to pet hunt, lose it pking and surely don't want to fork out x00m every time they slip up, and many other reasonable reasons to get one legit after. I got 3 capes on my zerk but doesn't mean it's "quite easy" recurring times. Sure it's easier than the first attempt, but it's still a pain in the ass, easy to mess up, catch a lag spike and waste time. Not to mention the 20m in supplies every attempt. 
---
I'm definitely not condoning buying capes, but just seems rather lazy on jagex's part they don't want to take the extra 30sec to determine how many of their xx capes were off task. If you're going to punish them harshly, just do perms, if you're just trying to get the point across not to buy capes, remove the bought capes.
---
(I assume they mean things like dedicated WC bots and etc)
---
If I pay for/bot my way to getting an untradeable on my account, that's one thing.  But someone creating one or more accounts that flood the GE with resources especially can influence the entire playerbase.  Only one of those actually affects my gameplay experience by impacting the value of commonly tradeable items.
---
A good example is Zulrah bots.  Scales would be more expensive, and Zulrah more profitable to kill, if there were no Zulrah bots.  But if one person cheats themselves an Inferno Cape, I'd never even know.
---
Grats!
---
I wonder if this means the blastmine warning squares break the rules since they activate automatically and show where you would get hurt standing.
---
Can't jomflax just make it impossible to connect to the server unless you're running their client?
---
People would still miss the message and be wrongfully banned
---
Im not hating im just jelous, how do you do it?
---
24 hours in a day, 8 hours sleep/wasted. 8 hours of work. That leaves 8 hours which all go to RS, could ofcourse be while cooking food, traveling, socializing, but still ... how the fuck
---
mad hard but quite valid

Depends. While pouches technically wouldn't leave the game anymore, it shouldn't matter that much if only a few pouches enters either (not forgetting the natural demand from new accounts). If the archaic emblems eventually will be removed then no more rune pouches will come into the game from wildy slayer anymore, leaving the only 2 sources to be the new BH shop and 750 slayer points. 
---
75 points from the BH shop is roughly 1.5M gp based on the intended loot crate values, so if the GE price went below this then you'd better spend those points on something else. The question is how much GP do you want before you think it's worth spending 750 slayer points on those.
---
It's so much cheaper. That's why people buy black market gold
---
Me too brother, thanks for the reddit luck and I’d say 5% in RS is a big deal. People try hard to get sets for a 2.5% exp boost, and 2 hours is a good 30-40 more kills.
---
Which QoL plugins are now banned?
---
I'm sure that they do back-end work to improve their servers, but to ask them to change boss mechanics because you lag is going to be out of the question.  Also 700kc bgs and bp is tedious AF, just use a DHCB or lance and woox walk. you can get 4-5 kill trips with ease and theres a lot less downtime to refill spec bar
---
You can always one click the bank booth and not use the menu swapper until clarification is issued on it if it makes you feel safer.
---
Far too many tradable BIS items... nothing is really worth anything other than on an Ironman.. 
---
why the hell are jars tradable when they are supposed to signify an achievement. 
---
Why is the basilisk jaw tradable when it’s the best helm and can just be traded over to an acc with the EASY “grandmaster” quest finished.
---
Uh unlike RL, OSB can be detected and users banned by Jagex. OSB pretty much has to comply
---
🦀MARKED TILES ARE A BANNABLE OFFENSE🦀
---
I liked the lending system but I heard it completely warped the economy when it was introduced. I wasn't rich or high enough level to get effected by the changed economy though.
---
Everyone on this subReddit are leet coders. Engine work? Easy fix. That is until someone asks the question "would you work for jagex"
---
allowing?
---
and $0.05 to end world hunger too
---
It's messed with my muscle memory and I don't feel like playing now lol
---
You sir, deserve a crafting level. well done!
---
edit: or ma'am?
---
It was removed for a reason though so I get why it's an issue to Jagex.
---
Seeing players liked having the map there, but it isnt meant to be there, make the minimap appear as a reward instead. For example building lanterns in the catacombs with construction, or an uncommon untradeable drop that only drops once, of a map of the Catacombs.
---
Locked my demon Butler out of my house. He must've been strolling around the lawn for years now
---
LMAO this wont do shit.
---
Bot clients will just send that 'secret key' and nothing is secret if it's on the client.
---
Aww no way looks cool!
---
Nice
---
Damn I missed that lol
---
Elite Void and Salve ammy are better than Slay Helm on task btw.
---
Yea because I think the event is a waste of time?
---
When did jagex say they had to remove clue helpers?
---
Elite void with Salve (ei) 
---
If you can get hold of one, an DHCB
---
as far as i know, haven't seen them complain yet in discord.
---
Start alching battlestaves
---
Wondering how this would be received if it was polled.
---
Nvm just found out, on mobile you go to the subredditpage and there is 3 dots, tap that and tap change flare

But in reality with how farmed they are supply is actually always increasing

Idk if your post is a statement or a question lmao

"If you remove my easyscape I'll quit"

Just move to rs3 buddy

It's not a singleplayer game made to be modded to fit your playstyle

They already are

It bothers me that you're an asshole

its the flair thingy, go on desktop (easier), go to your name at the sidebar, and set your flair

Hope you guys are ready for some series now. Quest series, Ironman series, deadman mode series, and pvm series. Lot of content and dialogue for me to work with.

you most likely logged into something malicious, do not click anything runescape related on social media.

Nice depth/lighting control.

You don't know what code signing is and it's painfully obvious. This has nothing to do with validating clients.
---

---
"I am trying to push them into that direction."
---
You wut?! why?  If you are you not making ends meet, surely you could advertise your patreon on the client. Myself and maybe others would not be offended. Its clear as day you put a load of effort into making this thing work exceptionally well
---
The undo button is too powerful
---
How would it have been unfairly obtained?  Im curious.  Im assuming this is osbuddy bs again.
---
If by quality of life you mean ezscape
---
Bruh. Money isn’t hard to make anymore. Back in the day yeah but 10M is easy. Thieving, hunter, Firemaking, wc, mining. You don’t even need to have good rng for the most part
---
I've been playing for 4 years and your playtime is closing in on mine what the hell.
---
I wonder if jagex know they are pavloving the community into posting constantly about problems on social media.
---
Cheaper than QA testers I suppose.
---
I mean for example you can’t buy clue scrolls directly from GE, but you can essentially buy one for an average price (that I don’t have the number on me right now) through various methods.

Since we all die anyway isnt everything just a waste of life

The introduction of a method objectively worse in every way to existing methods is not a good argument for not adding a new, competitive method.

Yes, 3pc is 'optionally' offering a feature that **FAILED THE POLL.** 
---
By your line of reasoning we should just take anything that fails a poll and allow an option to implement it through 3rd party clients. Thereby rendering the poll system utterly useless and spitting in the face of everyone who participated in it. 
---
WHY have a poll at that point? Please explain.
---
How tf do those two things compare lmao
---
something something integrity of the game
---
Yea I’m rocking the obsidian legs because I don’t have tassets yet. I play maybe an hour or 2 a day so hemorrhaging 5 mil every 2 weeks isn’t feasible for me.
---
I’m not pathetic, keep your points 😄
---
Torags legs, Proselyte legs, Bandos tassets, Verac's skirt are all solid leg options.
---
A count prehaps
---
We've been asking for this literally since launch but it seems to be ignored because slightly too much work or something idk
---
I answered your second part in my second paragraph lol. You noted the 63.4% and so did I. What directly do you want me to answer?
---
Pay someone to go into your account and finish the inferno for you
---
You do realize you can use your herbs on a leprechaun to note them, yes?
---
Hit me up in game in like 30-60mins if you want some company! IGN: mobilestonks
---
It's not possible. No matter what anti-cheat code you add in, all someone has to do is delete that code. Sure, you can add additional integrity checks on top of that, but ultimately they can all be disabled. It's just an arms race at that point.
---
Anti-cheat needs to be done on the server side, and the only reliable way is with behavioral analysis. Any "am I the real software" checks can be spoofed.
---
so you got pet pre log, why need reddit luck for it /s
---
Sounds like a good way to get your account cleaned out tbh
---
Only bought it because I spent 300k in death fees with range lol
---
Another botter. Know that you are ruining the game.
---
Yah don’t have 83 mage :/ trying to get it up at barrows though!
---
Its effective in the majority of cases and that can be tested. Report one of those spam bots, mining bots, or zammy wine bots. note its name, search on the highscores in a few days, its most likely been banned, thank you report button.
---
Fr I'll keep my fire cape that took me dozens of attempts and literally never take a look at the inferno
---
Ok so then the only difference now is you spend the 1.5m cash on a rune pouch rather than an emblem? Seems as if that removes the middle step in OP’s picture already, without making it tradeable.

---
Exactly, and those first time in 15year players are the ones Jagex needs to hook for the game to grow. If they choose to then switch to something like RL later then it’s a personal choice to switch. OSRS has to feel familiar to bring anyone back.
---
Imagine defending a fucking 3rd party client to this sort of extreme lmao
---
Are you trying to compare having somebody log in to your account to do a piece of challenging content to automated software that constantly undermines the entire economy &amp; every single legitimate player's efforts at grinding?
---
The difference here being one person gets a glowing cape and the other is a catastrophic network of illegal macro systems that undermine the very foundation of Runescape around the clock.
---
Runecrafting can be 1m+ gp per hour. I don't see why people wouldn't train it past 99.
---
I recommend you take a step back instead. I made an edit ~4 hours before your comment that points to information that Jagex failed to deliver themselves, which would have prevented this "needlessly toxic" behavior in the first place. Runelite already updated their client and most of the things people harped on are still on the client and ok'd by Jagex. Had Jagex been just slightly more transparent, or the relevant updates to runelite been stickied to the top of this sub, would have prevented far more misinformation and rioting.
---
Unfortunately this post is no longer stickied so this information is promptly going to fall into oblivion, so it's back to word-of-mouth and bad memes about those misinterpretations. What a shame.
---
Definitely get elite void and a salve (ei). Better than even slayer helm, since the bonuses stack. Afaik the best weapons for Vork are obviously the dhcb (range) or dhl (melee), but if you don't have the money for those, I'd stick to the blowpipe. I guess you can upgrade your god d'hide boots to pegs, though I don't think that's a priority.
---
I guess my witty post back fired, but I want that fancy pool and portal nexus
---
I'm hearing between 10-25 hours per bond.  You can do a lot of dailies like herb runs, battle staves, herb boxes, and probably so many more that help add up a little bit each day.
---
I tried paying him more.. but jamflex wont let me
---
If you don’t currently use a CC or are in a clan you can join my clan chat thru my username Twelvey12 and ask for any bossing PVM advice! I’m willing to let you tag along and learn anything really. General Gaardor and Sarachnis are good to learn given that the mechanics of knowing what the boss is doing at all times can make the difference. Other than those, I’ve got plenty of friends in the CC who can help!
---
Where is that rule stated? Account sharing isn't against the rules in OSRS so as long as real life currency isn't being exchanged there's no reason it shouldn't be allowed
---
Runelite doesn't work on my Mac :(
---
don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the wit in the post, I lawled at the ikea comparison. ;p
---
justiciar is already the best defensive armour, if it gets uograded to be the best offensive melee armour then theres no need for any other melee armour, which suuuuuuuuuucks
---
I should just do it shouldn't I? Like 10M cash stack (a lot locked up in bstaves waiting for a swing up), 114 points or something
---
Run away far enough so it completely ungaro you, including the spawns. Switch to a blitz and finish of the necheyarxh, the spawns wont even attack you again.
---
Like I said multiple times in this thread. They just need to buff getting them from Tithe farm. Make it faster than telegrabbing wines, as this method has requirements that are more time consuming to get than just 33 magic. All would be well.
---
You can pay someone gold to do anything on your account with few exceptions, you're just responsible for them botting etc on your account.
---
Save up for dragon fire ward. Costs 30m but is worth every penny. Also what everyone else said, salve (ei) plus elite void
---
&gt;I just wanted my Construction cape to be a left-click teleport 
---
It's shit like this. I like magic cape being left click spellbook.
---
When he said "paid", I assumed with money since he didn't specify RSGP.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uKVKMfx.png
---
No gymnastics required. This is a point and click game that uses left click, right click, the keyboard, and *your brain*. The last one being important and largely replaced by 3rd party clients, the first 2 being made easier by 3rd party clients. 
---
I'm in full support of a universal ban of all 3rd party clients, hugely invasive anticheat, and no updates to the official client. Make it all happen TODAY. Work out the details on the official client later imo.
---

---
Is using runelite bannable offence now? Which plugins do we need to turn off?
---
Find some random monster on zeah no one has ever heard of, might give you some cool exposure
---
except lfg still worked?
---
And yet did they explicitly state that or is your interpretation of what they said? It’s your opinion. That’s the correct answer, so unless they release an actual list detailing exactly which menu entries are allowed to be swapped then I am telling you that the language they used is a catch all that will leave them full discretion to ban for any MES options.
---
Oh this is fantastic lmaooo
---
Makes no sense to me then
---
I wouldnt recommend it.  It won't necessarily be the exact same mechanics and if I was making a pserv to rat people, an inferno pserv sounds pretty juicy to me.
---
might have something to do with the fact my parents aren't siblings
---
Do you put your helmet on by yourself?
---
nieve for sure until you can use duradel. except do konar for bonus tasks (multiples of 10 and 25) as she gives the most points.
---
So happy for you, little chad. Is that more than your current bank? Feels good to get more than your current bank in one action.
---
Solo missions recently made a video making a new account and trading his revenant emblems in for cash on that new account, and the new account got banned for RWT but there you're talking about 500M transfer to a new account so for sure that was an automated trigger he did get unbanned after appealing it tho.
---
So OP saying he was banned for RWT for "just lending 20M" seems like a load of shit to me.
---
What do you mean a "real poll"? Where is this poll standard published at?
---
Those accounts are hand played gold farming accounts. Every time accounts with insane exp in one skill get exposed the Jmods always say its hand played accounts. I'm not sure why people keep saying these are bots.
---
You can’t just ban them for using OSBuddy.
---
Cheers, is that just down to Konar giving undesirable tasks?
---
Why make shit up?
---
Are they getting rid of 1 click banking ?
---
Runelite deserves 25% at least
---
Well, working for a game company is generally not a great career move if you're already in the software field and not super passionate about game dev.
---
Yeah dude every time
---
Bullshit, you rwt'ed and got caught. My buddy and I share his tbow for weeks at a time, and nothing has ever happened with 1.2b. Now stop trying to get reddit upvotes ya fuck, bet ya lost your infernal Cape that was "legit"
---
No.
---
None. (Provided its the most updated vanilla runelite.)
---
Holyshit that's insane.
---
200 KC in I got 1 pair of prims, 2 pegs and 2 smouldering stones and I thought I was lucky.
---
Fastest way to make enough to buy bond as F2p?
---
RWT minor is for buying gold. Selling is RWT major. This is BS.
---
I got 4 jaws before the buff, sold them all for 21m each... *cries*
---
makes it easier for multitasking
---
Well done g! Enjoy the money and spend profusely!! 🤓🤓🤓
---
LOL, "Cross Play", enjoy your 2 week ban. There goes your infernal LMFAO.
---
They absolutely can. I trade hundreds of mils in cash/gear between my accounts without a problem, and plenty of players lend high ticket items like Tbow or large amounts of cash to eachother without an issue. OP didn't even get the excuse right, if they think you sold gold, it's RWT major not minor.
---
Are you allowed to pay a Venezuelan gp to get 99 RC for you? Because that sounds like botting but using poor people instead.
---
Well, you can if OSB has plugins that are against ToS. I don't see the issue with that.
---
The only way I can distinguish melee is that I cant distinguish it. Maybe they should give it a battle axe or something?
---
Having an existential crisis and trying to work through it, just like the picture shows.
---
Aw god why didn't you do it in blue text
---
This one guy in particular (around 72m runecrafting xp at the time) had notable bot-like behaviour, it really didn't seem hand played at all tbh? I kept speccing him out and killing him and he just came back with the same route, same behaviour and didn't acknowledge me or speak etc.
---
Makes sense, thanks bud
---
Tokenized access is not an easy thing to break when done right.
---
Yeah it was quite a bit more. I have gotten few bigger drops, dwh, range boots, and few zenyte shards, but nothing close to that.

You could trade up to 240k per 15 mins with friends

Inferno has been out for awhile by now.  Conceivably someone has gotten the cape, lost the account with the cape somehow (rwt ban, hack, etc) and trained another account from a completely different IP, location, computer (like they could've took a 6 month break after being banned and moved in the break time).
---
Those accounts would be entirely independent and Jagex wouldn't be able to tell they're the same person.  They could still 1 attempt inferno.
---
They said make, not pay. It was a strange example to use as the pouch isn’t made but purchased and also isn’t a quest item. I’m being downvoted though so I guess I’m wrong.
---
How dare you serve your country and play a video game at the same time. We're deleting stuff you earned while serving and banning you for two weeks.
---
\- Jagex
---
Won’t get unbanned even if you are telling the truth.
---
You don’t have enough twitch followers.
---
Deal with it.
---

---
————————————————————
---
On the real though that sucks, and  I hope if you were wrongfully banned it gets taken off your account, but I highly doubt it.  Good luck
---
the best gp/hr you can reliably make in f2p is roughly 250k/hr telegrabbing wines of zamorak and you will be competing with bots most of the time.
---
right now bonds cost about 5 million gp or $7.
---
it would take you about 20 hours to make 5 million gp in f2p.
---
so you would in essence be working a part time job for 20 hours at a rate of $0.35 per hour by farming gp in f2p in order to buy a bond.
---
if you can have fun during those 20 hours it is a different story, and only you can decide what your time is worth. if you are still interested I would check out the first few episodes of a youtube playlist called f2p to main by smallxplamp. he uses a variety of methods and depending on the market for things like team capes and certain runes you may be able to do it in under 20 hours.
---
Grats mate.
---
how is a pic on completion proof it's him that did it though. all the inferno capes done are done via remote access.
---
sure maybe if he had an album of all his late wave deaths and progression, that'd be very strong proof of his own completion.
---
So how would you use it if you have to hide it? Just wait it out?
---
I don't think that's true. People vary a lot on what they think is a good place for any games ui. Just look at how diverse the WoW ui of top raiders can get.
---
Interested to hear a jmod reply, upvoted
---
its was a **buyable**. you can't get your money back after your purchase it. that is different from being fully **tradeable**
---
Yup. Did about 620 for a bludgeon, and the wasted hits felt demoralizing. This might be enough to convince me to grind the pet.
---
I'm dreading to grow up. I love being 16 and able to game for pretty much as long as I want at night. Gonna be real sad when I'm older :(
---
I love the idea of bankers just hating adventurers and being tired of all their weird bullshit

That guy doesn't give a fuck about anything, he even pisses out the window.

I’m collecting data for a school report what’s your BMI?
---
My 2 cents would be: learn one rotation at the time, once you know the rotations and where to be  you will be taking hardly any damage
---
Is there any way of doing it without rooting?
---
This is true, but I just thought I would give some context and witnesses.
---
Maaaan im right up there with you. Literally remember first making my username and password.
---
It's pretty significant that you can get 1m+ per hour from skilling tho. Pretty sure it's because of pvm though :/
---
it wasn't true duping. Just a way to lend an items while also keeping them.
---
Idk how jagex can use location changes as definitive proof of wrongdoing for a ban, what a load of shit.
---
LOL
---
This game is rife with inconsistent mechanics, using other items as examples of how things should be is kinda silly.
---
I mistakenly thought pointing out the issues with someone’s statement was the whole point of discussion, but it seems I’m wrong 🙃 I suppose I’ll go back to lurking.
---
Due to Jagex new stance on 3rd party clients is it still safe to use OSBuddy?!
---
RIP AVR
---
&gt; (Unacceptable features include those) which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using **fewer clicks than you would when using our client**.
---
They said this in the first blog post on 3PCs. Menu entry swapper is deemed unacceptable. Use at your own risk. 
---
A little bit of further anecdotal evidence: I've seen people calling for justice on Twitter this week because a streamer got a task from Duradel in one click (entry swapped 'Talk-To' for 'Assignment').
---
Feels like you ain't doing that well either ;)
---
Although you don’t have to, I would encourage your goal for your first account to be doing all the content, quests, pvm, and mini games.  You’ll learn the game and items through that. There are even pvp mini games (Last Man Standing) you can try out as a f2p. But don’t restrict anything. You can always make a shit ton of money with your main, and then spend it to fund a restricted alternate account (like a 1 defense account that is really good for pvp). 
---
So yes, train range so you can learn how the mechanics and safe spotting works. Also you can talk to the range tutor in lumbridge to make arrows on the ground you pick up go straight into equip if it’s the same arrow type you have equip, meaning you don’t have to safe space for it in your inventory. 
---
Lastly, make sure you use range gear. Range gear will increase your accuracy. Always use a short bow for training range (best dps in f2p). Magic gear or melee gear might give negative accuracy. Range gear is stuff like the leather coif and leather body.
---
Good luck friend
---
suspiciously fast inferno for first timer
---
Buying gf
---
Yes, but I like having more than half my inventory empty to fit the herbs and limpwurt roots. Otherwise I have to note things multiple times per patch.
---
Just use sticky keys.
---
There's a guy in my cc who I'm positive bought his cape, as he is a mediocre(at best) pvmer and he got the cape in one single day of attempts. I reported via tipoff email and a month later he hasn't been banned. But seeing that it took you 3 months to get banned I now have hope that justice will be served. 
---
As for op, nothing here screams proof to me. But jagex definitely makes mistakes so I'll keep my opinion nuetral
---
Blast furnace
---
I said "don't really" use that method, because it's not good. Just because you decided on a worse method doesn't mean others do it.
---
Where does this number come from? Also will runelite be available to all players? Will it be optional? SHOULD all of the features of runelite be available in the eyes of the devs and jagex?
---
If OSBuddy hasn't removed banned plugins, no it is not.
---
I have a friend who admits he bought an infernal cape. He still has it. Until he loses it, I don't really trust anyone with an infernal cape :/
---
I don't see how jagex benefits from buying it all
---
What does sticky keys do. I have it turned off as it can be annoying
---
My guess is that people who have a shit ton of slayer points saved up could just buy a bunch of them and dump them in GE. This would also become a money making method for mid high levels until eventually pouch is worthless.
---
I don’t care if it was balanced or not, over half the runescape population got 99s with it already. I think it’s unfair that now I won’t be able to - the majority of players had an advantage in leveling that I now don’t have access to. That’s pure bullshit. Unless every account that used this plugin gets banned or reset, then removing the plugin isn’t fair.
---
Google it for further explanation but you can use sticky keys to basically “stick” the shift key to an always on position so it’ll be on til you click it again.
---
*insert my pp in your mom noise*
---
Good for him. He reverse owned that noob giving him a hard time lol. Reverse owns are the best.
---
I love how Im the only one who only has to pay 10 dollars for membership... no idea where you all are getting the 11 from. Ive canceled and reinstated it many times, so its not an old figure either
---
I mean yea takes &lt; a month to make and most of the time spent (2 weeks) is from afking NMZ but its worth it long term.
---
I remember being afraid of accidentally waking up my parents, as they would turn of the internet if they knew I was online.
---
Despite what people saying growing up is fantastic. This month alone I’ve gone through unexpected really shitty life stuff, but I’m learning more about myself everyday. I’ll be in my 30s here soon and I’m more excited everyday, even while fighting medical depression. You can do it bud
---
didnt they take that out recently? you had to buy some shit and trade it in or whatever
---
Because it's Bis for runes. We all worked for it. Also, you keep it on PvM deaths and the runes inside.
---
This is my favorite by far. The whole series has been amazing. I would have loved if this one ended with "boss demolishes my bedroom because of 'quicker load times' but doesn't fire me wtf do I do now"
---
i thought they removed that method?
---
Man love that chilledcow.
---
Lol sounds like a lie
---
the blogs were designed to encourage players to get their shit in line. you arent at risk of getting banned without warning using regular runelite.
---
Ardy knights still work with left click attack off. Master farmer in farming guild still works left click. The boss overlays i couldn’t care less tbh. The zulrah one is neat for learning but it hasn’t been on RL for a hot minute
---
It's not just you. Got a high res monitor? Official client is unplayable
---
He is banned xD
---
Lol best one yet
---
They did though. There's a voice chat in league now.
---
Because its ge price is still higher than the price people are actually willing to pay for it.
---
Real answer is more and more people are doing ToB,  adding scythes to the game. ToB itself is pretty much the only place scythe gets used profitably, so the demand for it is limited to pet hunters and high level pvmers, who aren't that big of a group, with many of them already owning a scythe if they cared to.
---
That's how it happened when they first dropped back in RSC. They just appeared on the ground, but all over the place, not just social hubs. I got a Green Mask and sold it for 30k that day. Bad life choices.
---
They defo deserve a shout out! Great work
---
Yeah it's also pretty pointless. If you want to risk fight grab cash stacks and trade to verify in the wildy. Emblems that have no net gain and actually offer a potential net loss are worse than risking gp for anything other than verification purposes. 
---
Makes more sense to just bring the extra gp or upgrade to a fury risk or a regen brace or dragon boots or any other item upgrade for your build. If you're already pking in max gear then your risk is often in the ten to hundreds of mills anyways.

It infuriates me because it doesn’t have all of the skills lol
---
Thanks for clarifying mate
---
I double clicked the prayer orb in the picture instinctively smh
---
I want to see two more types of ess you can mine. One untradeable. This one gives more exp at the chance of not making a rune. The second one tradeable that give you double runes at half exp. Downside is you can only get it by trading an NPC the untradble ess.
---
I think I'd do:
---
Iban's Staff
---
Dragon chainbody and legs (fighter torso if you have it)
---
Unholy book, book of darkness, or malediction ward
---
Amulet of fury or glory
---
Brimstone ring, seers ring, or berserker ring. 
---
God cape, fire cape, or Ardougne Cape.  .
---
Barrows gloves or combat bracelet
---
Neitz helm
---
I'd recommend getting to 50 range to use an MSB. Works great against Ahrims as he's very weak to range. I also use black d'hide as my main gear rather than melee armor. It's as tanky as I need, helps with range for ahrims, and has less negative magic attack bonus. Not sure if blue d'hide would be worth using.
---
Is noone going to mention such a simple change is not a “random mechanic”? Wtf is he saying...
---
It's the only thing that stayed in my brain from those early years of art classes that I dropped when they became optional, haven't heard anything about it since so I'm glad it's at least a real thing.
---
It could be an alt account, or maybe they watch a bunch of guides and are crazy skilled enough to get it first try.
---
However, if 6 months later they never went back to get a 2nd cape, the notion that somebody gets it on first try and never goes back to get another one on slayer task is completely implausible.
---
Even if you could mine 10k essence an hour that would be 20k/h per bot. Plenty of more worthwhile boys out there.
---
Change the threshold to 65/45 for passing and re-poll it. I voted yes for both things because I thought it would be a huge positive QOL.
---
I vote for "Learn to code your own bot"
---
Adding features to the vanilla? HA.
---
No. That was before the beta update. Unless they took it away with the system update today, you should be able to.
---
But he is a pure....
---
Dont forget healbot and multibox macroing is allowed
---
Sold 2 a few days ago for 30.5m each.
---
Now dis a mood
---
Most likely not. It’s only 1/118 drop
---
True. They’ll probably just buy RuneLite or something
---
This has been a daily occurence. Most know to avoid this.
---
Prayer reordering was polled and failed.  Its not surprising that its not allowed.
---
Yeah but 6 is unbalanced and slow and scuffed sf
---
Not if there was a mob on the tile. Then your only options were to attack the mob, examine the items under it, or go through the hassle of turning your npc attack options to off and then picking up whatever was on top of the stack.
---
Same here. I hate the wilderness.
---
I regularly lend my twisted bow to friends and have never been banned. 
---
I’m curious as to what their methodology for banning people is for this offense.
---
At first I was like: *"Thats a cool whip! I'd love that!"*  
---
Then I was like: *"oh wait those look like anal beads, oh shit"*
---
Gold sink?
---
It's like a 2 for 1 at the BDSM shop though
---
Literally this. There's no such thing as a unique ID anymore. Let alone the fact that some manufacturers reuse Mac addresses.
---
Oh I had no idea tbh. Ah well better safe than sorry
---
Its like they understand that they shouldn‘t keep their paying customers from playing the game they are paying for, and let them play the game however they want to, as long as it doesn‘t hurt the playerbase or the game on a larger scale...
---
So you think runelite devs have been colaborating with jagex for weeks, removing every feature which is not allowed - but leaving the menu entry swapper in?
---
Where are the siblings hovering over my shoulder watching me play?
---
Re-download runelite it’s definitely fixed for me.
---
Youre not alone. Its just me and you who get unlucky though, 100% of other people have a pet or a 1b+ bank by now. I have a life though so yeah
---
That doesnt make sense
---
People indirectly buy them with gp now anyway
---
If they buy emblems from players, no gp leaves the system
---
the truth!
---
Jamflex strikes again
---
You can do that, but just do it with the statement and not the analogy itself.
---
And it's even becomes a joke to get it now. It now costs as much as the herb sack, while having incredibly more uses.
---
Choked lmaoooo
---
That I like myself more then I thought. I’m actually ok with who I am and what I think makes me that way. Took me years to realize that.
---
Oh fuck
---
This game really has a one-of-a-kind way of unceasingly giving you more and more things to do without having anything even resembling a "defined" path of progression.  You walk off tutorial island and there's literally tens of thousands of hours of shit that you could do, in pretty much any order.  Even a high level account can decide like "I want X pet" and end up fly fishing some random river in bumfuck nowhere because they needed higher fishing to do some quest to unlock some area to more efficiently train some other skill which needs to get levelled to be one out of the 10 requirements for some hard or elite diary which makes it slightly more efficient to kill the boss that drops X pet.
---
?
---
they didnt change their detection at all yet. read the most recent blog, they even acknowledge most of the things theyre banning wont ever be...
---
kodai acb ahrims and dhide is honestly all u really need
---
bcp is optional, nice defense and makes first cape easier imo
---
pegs/arma/ancest are more or less luxury items, and sgs is very optional (it doesn't profit prayer for itself in the inventory space lost until ~wave 55)
---
i soent about 50m in supplies for my cape
---
Put snow in the rain spot
---
It's not all bad. Also you're still pretty young and have plenty of time to game and go to LAN parties. I agree with the other posters that it doesn't happen all at once, life just changes overtime and you look back and think "Wow where did the time go?"
---
"Wait.. this is where you tried to kill me Eric!"
---
'I told you sweetie, you made me late to the pumpkin patch'
---
Don’t worry dude, I’m 30 and late night gaming or day long marathons are still common for me.
---
Makes it easier to lose the one I already have
---
Or flip the list priority. No real reason to ever talk to them
---
Sit.
---
There must be some way to detect it. Maybe a key in the code that matches a hidden key in game that shows the user is using the official client, but even then people would just go back to screen scraper paint bots. cANT'T EION
---
Greek life at my school and schools around me is all the rich kids(not chads) that have their parents buy them everything. Nope, don’t wanna be friends with those people.
---
There’s a reason alumni continually donate to their old frat, because they are stuck In that time and their life just gets worse cause they don’t make real friends, just ones that like to be drunk.
---
Accuarate AF
---
&gt; 'Gielinor' are made up words of 'Religion'?
---
I think you mean "Gielinor" is an anagram of "Religion"
---
&gt;nothing is really worth anything other than on an Ironman..
---
And now the rune pouch isn't an achievement either with its price cut down by 40%. I absolutely despise how Jamflex caters to helmets.
---
If you can run userscripts I wrote one to fix the "skip question" issue, /r/2007scape/comments/7wqiy0/
---
Sounds like those players need to get good
---
You think bots are generating 1.5 million USD daily?
---
At $1/mil, that’s 1.5 trillion GP per day. 
---
MMK said in 2017 there was a little over 10 trillion in the game. Let’s say conservatively it’s tripled.
---
You seriously think it’s feasible that bots are selling over 5% of the gold supply in the game on a daily basis?
---
I mean it sounds completely feasible... you can actually get a big cake from that NPC, just only during a different birthday event. 
---
This is a pretty lame bait/prank honestly. And yes I did fall for it before I read the comments
---
Also f u my slayer log for these is at 2.5k and only 1 jaw :’(
---
Ps these still going for like 30m iirc don’t screw yourself :)
---
Yeah adding a special case for their talk option would do the trick too but that would probably be engine work
---
This is also a birthday event though so you should be allowed to get the cake with a smartphone on top
---
I love this meme. Don't let what happened with Epstein ever leave the public consciousness.
---
 *insert baby crying noise*
---
In a couple QAs they've said its engine work. So low hopes... But yea, redownload runlite and their new launcher will fix it.
---
Jagex don't get 11$ if the players stop playing. They don't want to ban legitimate players unless necessary.
---
To be fair, the official clients UI is super super tiny, in RL and even on mobile its scaled in, so you can actually read words on the page and see your items. Not everyone has amazing vision
---
Hope you have a great day my friend
---
Sorry but I just don't see how it was OP where not many used it. It means that it provides such little advantage that most stuck with the og version since they already hsd it at muscle memory.
---
Has literally nothing to do with mtx wtf are you on about
---
Runelite is good. They actually did an update to comply and are working with jagex a bit.
---
I've been injecting Raid for years and i feel stronger then ever.
---
this \^\^\^
---
Why is it easier on task? I've never attempted Inferno.
---

---
I saw the rain just as the song mentioned it. It really is coming together.
---
23 here. I am the same way. Also working 9 hours a day 5 days a week doesn’t help either. College was my last time to game all night and I rarely did it :(
---
Yeah i turned 18 two months ago and im a freshman at college and I cant help but feel anxious and depressed about getting older. I loved being at home and grinding hard, hate to leave it behind.
---
Boss timers really? Update your fucking client already, its 2019
---
I was replying to a guy that said "first attempt"
---
I had people tell me they voted no because they don't trust jagex to implement multiple rune pouches after the coin pouch and tbow spawn fiascos
---
Try using a herring on a redwood ;)
---
I agree if it wasn't polled or passed one, but it failed one and any script that circumnavigates a failed poll is a hard no.
---
The statement was a bit vague there but it's safe to say you won't be banned for using any of the official runelite features. Jagex would just tell adam to remove them instead of banning all the users
---
Woulda been a sick twist. New headcannon.
---
If it makes you feel better, as an iron with 4 buckets I don't even use any of them anymore. You move to ultra fertile soil at some point.
---
&gt;the only use they had for multiple rune pouches would be having different loadouts like a teleporting setup, a barraging setup, a raiding setup, etc 
---
That is the only reason I wanted them. No point in having them if they can't have different runes
---
Nah lmfao my acc wouldn’t of got to the inferno hahah
---
&gt;one day a bunch of random people show up
---
&gt;this dude built a chapel
---
&gt;like an actual church
---
&gt;they all run over to it and throw bones on it
---
&gt;bones just disappea
---
&gt;they do this for hours
---
&gt;boss sits there, drunk
---
&gt;some people walk around, drink his fountain water and start yelling at a podium
---
&gt;wtf.png
---
The type of person to use a forum of any kind is probably already in the bottom percentile of players.
---
No doubt 97% of forum users also use clients. But clients are not as widespread to the general public as people on here might assume. 
---
If jagex truly thought that removing these 3rd party client aspects would result in a relevant percentage of players quitting then they wouldn’t do said changes.
---
Even though I disagree with the changes, I also disagree with this very popular mindset that 3rd party client nerfs would in anyway kill the game. 
---
We are the minority.
---
Zulcano probably is the least botted boss in game to be fair.
---
Complaint is valid anger slightly misdirected.
---
blast furnace boots are probably the real problem. Just look at dart prices.
---
I guess I'm not the only one listening to lofi
---
Why would it be dead? Too hard? I mean it is a raid...
---
They gave an armadyl chestplate to an ironman after the ToB dawnbringer bug made him lose his. It’s doable, but I doubt many of team members would be confident in doing it. It’s not exactly something they’ve codified into a procedure I’m sure.
---
Upvoted for Jmod smackdown
---
The trick was turning off the alarm before it woke anyone else up.
---
Those are considered stomp mechanics not regular attacks
---
They use a special attack to hit them underneath them (Dawn has this effect too)
---
Hydra is able to use its auto attack on anyone under it  and its the only monster that can do so
---
Why did you get banned?
---
The title makes it
---
I pay 75 SEK, or about 7.7 dollars for one month
---
Working 16 hour days atm, still get a few hours to play on weekends though!
---
The rich just get richer from lending out the gear that they don't use for example overnight. 
---
 It makes the game lose all gear progression as its most likely just better to lend a tbow/bis item for that boss even if you have to pay some guy 500k to borrow it. Little reason to work to own items anymore other than a slight rent charge. 
---
No longer huge itemsinks as not everyone needs to have every item. Right now a lot of people have for example a kodai just sitting in their bank waiting for a bursting task, but then you could instead just borrow it from someone for each burst task. 
---
Just borrow a tbow when you are 75 range and do the fight cave with it. I think it would make a lot of high valued items drop in price, because right now "everyone" needs their own tbow/scythe/kodai/sang just sitting in bank waiting to get used, but if you can rent and borrow then the BiS item will get used 24/7 to get more BiS items quicker than with the normal shitty gear they would have, which just makes all items crash in price.
---
Lol no
---
lowering the pass rate to 70% got [56%](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1335)
---
I was also on at 5 30 but it wasnt because i woke up early :)
---
That poor man had his honeymoon ruined. Ruined! Imagine how proud you would be if you gotten away with buying an inferno cape. Only to have that taken away from you in an instant. That trip from Georgia to California wasn't cheap. And neither was the hotel, or the wedding just days prior. And now he can't even enjoy himself because his purchase was discovered. And his new wife is never gonna appreciate just how much that hurts. Now all he can do is sit there, ranting on Reddit, and waiting for the honeymoon to end so he can finally send Jagex all that proof he has on his desktop back in Georgia.
---
Lmao at that baseball convo
---
no
---
I am upset I used my slay point thinking back at it. Just didn’t want to shovel out the 3-4m it was at the time. And didn’t trust the ccs despite what everyone has said.
---
well i dont see it about greed, its about helping the companies pay their bills
---
Bahahaahahahah
---
Wait so you cant use any third party clients. Ow?? I havent logged on in a week where did this come from?
---
Lol what
---
That's kinda funny to know this whole time that plugin was because someone had the same problem as me with flux lol, I never would've thought that.
---
Its literally the same thing swampletics does
---
Limit yourself for the fun/challenge
---
Crazy how you see someone enjoying the game and it makes you devolve into a horrible person. 
---
Seems like you've got sone personal issues to work out
---
I understand how rearranged books look.  What i'm saying is it's unfair to people who can't do it, it failed a poll, and the normal prayer book isn't complicated or unorganized.  Learn the game the way it was developed. If the prayers were in some real shit order I would agree with you but they aren't.
---
My first attempt I got to zuk and I was actually worried about getting banned if I succeeded. Jokes on me though, I died
---
feet version pls
---
No one knows about this awesome trick, but super attack and strength potions are super cheap now.
---
Try having some fun inbetween. It's a game.
---
What kind of proof could one have to prove they didn’t bot?
---
50kc is a garunteed head
---
Most people on here play 14+ hours a day. Youre underestimating how nerdy and no life this community is man
---
Shit man my names playingOSRS I need to get on some leaderboards I guess
---
It’s for a clue step
---
Yah, please get a life. Im actually concerned you pulled this off in a year.. like what. The. FUCK.
---
It’s for light orbs
---
I think it really depends. I did 1 inferno attempt with the cheesy justiciar setup and it took me 4 hours before dying to zuk. I imagine that wouldn't have raised many flags if I had cooked it because it was clearly someone inexperienced just trying to brute force it. However, I imagine if you did it first try in 80 minutes with full offensive gear and everything it would be far more suspicious.
---
World hopping limit is back? D:
---
Raids/active bossing - Justice, Daft Punk, Simian Mobile Disco, Goldfish, other electronic but not clubby music.
---
Anything else - Netflix since I don't have to look at osrs the whole time, or if it's slightly engaging it'll be a podcast. 99PI puts me on autopilot in game
---
So we should base control in the game around the highest xp rates?
---
Probably 10 imbued hearts from a banshee task
---
Maybe they don't have 75 magic yet but want to cast magic spells in the wild and have it count as one of their three items. 
---
In any case, the situation is already confusing. Adding more special mechanics makes it even more confusing. 
---
We almost need a pk / wildy tutorial island at this point.
---
Wait you didn't know a 30 second video of you playing the game is 100% totally proof you never once botted? I mean come on you have legit proof you played the account once therefore you never botted.
---
Better charge your device soon
---
i know this only effects a small majority of the game who enjoy the competitive side of castle wars, but unless there is a smuggling bug or exploitation, i see no reason for this to happen? also can we take buckets into the game? the bucket spawn is 1 minute as well and also has grief issues.
---
5 head
---
Right I’m an asshole for being bothered by people not understand a game that’s been out for literally years. Or not understand the concept of YouTube that probably has thousands of money making methods

---
Just casually miss the part where that's not what they said? Huge difference between *have* and *make* bud
---
First of all in adolescence, pretty much every decent parent pays their kids way. Food, housing, healthcare, potentially school. No shit, you need money to live. The more money you have, the more you can and will spend. What the fuck does that say about a person? If anything it should be positive as true success takes hard work 
---
Trying to turn this into a defining generalization is one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard, and honestly pretty sad. Reality is they (or anyone with such a baseless outlook) probably wouldn't fit in with such a crowd regardless of material possession/status
---
Based on those arms you probably could go elbow deep.

Oh really? That's strange that they hid it in such a weird way, and honestly it's super greasy that they offer plugins such as those.

As a kid I used to make coffee and put it in a thermos. I would hide it in my bathroom. Set an alarm at 2am. Sneak downstairs and grab my laptop. Then go back upstairs and play runescape and drinking coffee to stay awake

eh if i got mine taken away after buying it i'd probably just open a dispute on paypal.

Imagine being friends with cheating cunts lmao
---
Hope they both lose em pal
---
Did I say cut off all video games? No. I said go out more. Don’t waste away in a basement while other kids are enjoying life. It’s a fact that more social interactions=lower chances of depression. Yeah you can have your online friends your whole life but how are you gunna do in a work environment where you need to communicate and relate to people face to face. Video games are good but should be limited when you are young. I would of never of had my experiences if I stayed inside the whole time. I’m not going to remember every match of call of duty but you are damn sure I’m gunna remember getting my first kiss on some dock with a girl I stole a beer from my parents for

Hey, man. I’m not not saying “fuck you” to OP. He can live his life however he wants. Some of us just think it’s unhealthy and that people shouldn’t look up to it. What’s wrong with that?
---
&gt; instead of seeing 10 ashes it appears ashes (10)
---
Gonna be a pedantic bitch here but the parentheses are for when it's stacked, in this case banknotes since ashes aren't stackable. When it's individual items it will say "Ashes x 10"

I remember breaking down in tears while doing dragon Slayer. I just landed on Crandor, I had food, gear, and even a potion... But wait, where was my anti-dragon shield? I had equipped my rune kite because I felt like such a badass... I thought I had lost everything.

I’m 20 almost 21 now and I think I’m going to retire soon. I remember I was in 8th grade when OSRS came out and it was like yesterday. At least you recognize how good being 16 really is, don’t take it for granted because life doesn’t get any simpler nor easier from there bro.
---
It really SHOULD be a simple thing. It isn't a complex task. I agree it might not be, but if so, that is the fault of Jagex

@OP - is that top right pic taken from one of those lo-fi vids on youtube?

That's the alch values, each one would have to be updated manually

Yeah I can grind 5pm to 2am, get 4 hours of sleep and still function semi decent. After a few weeks I’m completely fried but a day here and there isn’t bad at all
---
I think they were more talking about just tabs - so that you could have the same amount of overall bank space but just a bunch more categories.
---
They've in the past said that they're more or less at the limit for bank spaces in a single bank without absolutely killing performance. Though the option of having 2 banks or other places to hold things (much like the seed vault) could work just as well.
---
BUT is more space really needed? Anyone that has a full bank probably has at least 100 slots of trash.
