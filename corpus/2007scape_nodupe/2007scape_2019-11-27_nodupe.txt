I just don't understand why a mod can lock me out, THEN use the right email to let me know that it's locked, knowing that I don't have access to the other email... Smh

I haven't watched it yet but great video mr. Settled

Very fast, very click intensive, if you stick with the Ardy knights, at lvl 60 with the diary it's 80k an hour, at 90 it ends up being about 200k an hour, when you stop failing it ends up being 250k an hour. It might also be worth getting some Dodgy Necklaces for best XP rates.

7 minutes ago yooo lets goooo!

So you req everyone to have dwh? Even though it’s better if some people have bgs?
---
That's how any MMO goes. There's the most efficient weapon, and then the fun ones.
---
just wear accumulator kappa
---
I’m in a similar situation with a very very very old account. There was a link that you could say you forgot what email you used, and then it asks you for previous passwords, a description of the account, when it started, what credit card it was first payed for with and so on. Hope it works out man, didn’t for me :(

This thing looks awesome

i remember buying the dragon mace, i was like HOLY shit this is the best weapon in the game

So you can do this a total of 5 times per day with mage cape?

Wow a whole 3.5% drop on an already volatile item. Surprised it didn't drop more tbh...

Guess it did huh! God works in mysterious ways...

Assuming you only switch to ancients, yeah.
---
However, you can use Veng, then spellbook swap for ancients too.
---
Don't need a cape for a few extra runes. Not like inventory matters when you rush.
---
I got hacked a bit ago but never noticed because they only played UIM on my rs3 account since they didn’t have my bank pin. But also they couldn’t note or unnote so I just had a few dragon bones and was cutting Magic’s.

You would actually only need to kill 1,085,208.83 chickens for 99 attack.

Oh yeah for a single barrage that would work

oh shit

Swamp ass bad

Tbh I question how the Niagara Falls keeps flowing and falling at a steady rate when so much water must go at the same time
---
swamp man good

How’d you get all of these?
---
There's many many people who are in the same boat. Not looking good for me so far, I really wish they'd change it... I'll try a letter and see what happens.

Okay thanks I will start that also!

30 defence req is more fun than 50. Give other builds a chance at some point. Lower the defensive stats if you have to but keep the 30 def req.

YES! Nice work as always.

And the swole gym bro stance? Yes please!
---
You're forgetting the fact pkers can stack the numbers with magic, if you can hit a 90 with magic, you can't even triple eat that. Don't start about being able to stack ranged attacks with melee, ranged doesn't hit 90 either. If the staff would be like a trident where you can't attack players with it I'd vote yes.

I love weapons like this in games cause they never existed in reality and I want to smack some bitches with a huge morning star flail

Can i get a few more photons

not when i get home, it's off peak and the world I normally play in had an empty wintertodt before I hopped to the main world

Swampman good. Swamplady bad.

Tldr: must have been playing since day one or be addicted to bonds
---
Yea the time difference between leagues and dmm is such a toss up. Feel like 2months is very long for leagues since a lot of people will take 2-3 weeks to get all the relics and then there isn’t really anything to look forward too beyond just grinding with the relics you’ve already got. I can’t do late game shit like raids 1 on my account so there’s no chance of me doing it with an msb and fire wave. Also if I’m gonna grind shamans for a dwh, id rather do it on the main game and make bank.
---
On the other hand dmm being only 1 week and competitive just meant people put in some really  unhealthy hours. That was partly why I felt like dmm was a bad system for jagex marketing osrs, because it promotes people thinking you need to put in crazy hours to do well at osrs. If they put the average number of hours played/day during dmm for the top 20 players it would’ve reflected badly on jagex that 12+ hour days are required to even get close to the top.
---
You can do the callisto safespotting method, my stats are similar and I think its fun. 70 pray for piety would be better, but its not bad with chivalry

---
I haven’t played since 05 and just created a new account and bought members. I’ve decided to follow quest guides to avoid as much grinding skills as possible for the first month.
---
I just completed Waterfall Quest and want to know if there’s any guides that detail efficient ways of getting decent gear without grinding too hard for gold or smithing? In my 05’ limited mind (and only ever having played a month of members before my mom pulled the plug), I would need to grind fishing/wc/mining to get some gold and go to GE to get the gear I need. Can anyone provide some better methods?
---
If you’re talking about my tabs I’m in nursing school haha.

If F-keys weren't a feature, would you vote yes on a poll to add them?

So yea, I def won’t be joining up with those requirement, jeez, that’s not casual in the slightest, would you like to see my bank? Cause that’s casual
---
I don't see the point. In a month and a half it's gone and then 2 months of your time and effort is gone with it. Why?
---
If homelessness could be permanently ended nationwide with only $100 billion or less, then I'm pretty sure the government would've done it years ago.
---
they should make the new offhand magic an upgrade to the arcane spirit shield. Basically like kodai insiginia gets added to the master wand, tey should make an arcane insignia added to the arcane spirit shield making it like +25 mage attack +2% magic damage. This way the new arcane insignia from asahshama will be very valuable and it wouldn't devalue the arcane at all.
---
Ah yes back when every moss giant had like 5-10 people around it waiting for a spawn. The only way you could get the drop for yourself was basically slapping a 15 with a rune 2h
---
strange fruit and energy pots though. Enjoy chugging prayer pots bro. :D
---
I really dont know what youre talking about. Whos getting banned? Intended looting system invisiable impling?
---
What do you mean about +50% magic strength bonus is dumb? Smh my head, people these days.
---
I like how you even put an "on a serious note" in parentheses and multiple people are still taking the body of this post seriously
---
runescape sure does have interesting effects on the brain
---
People shit on accuracy a lot. Even at Olm magic accuracy is still around 1/3 as good as max hit increases, percentage over percentage. It’s not useless, it’s just that better options exist for switches.
---
that's what happens for rushing all his videos. only 57 days for this one, he's just trying to capitalize on his popularity smh
---
Nah was just trying to make an Iron-Meme joke haha, my joke was the only depressing here.
---
I think sanguinesti+10% tome would be more dps than Fire surge at 2.4s, since fire surge has likea  49 max hit and sanguinesti is currently 47 max hit so with 10% extra would be 51 i think
---
Ahhhh
---
Because it essentially removes any sort of gear progression. If 75 is the highest they're willing to go it means that the moment you hit 75 you unlock every single piece of high gear content. Of which 2/3 is useless because there's actually this better weapon that came out more recently... But it's the same level to use.
---
It would be like when they brought dragon armour out if they made it also 40 defence because they didn't want to "power creep" the levels. So now when you got to 40 defence you unlocked rune... And dragon...
---
Why would you ever use rune? Dragon is better. You'd use that.
---
Decent, cheers!

Murder is just real life PVP

&gt; the rapier is already basically completely dead content with lance in the game,

it's actually BiS at many places still especially at vasa, and theres' a reason the rapier is 192m atm, because its still BiS for slayer etc too

Same. It's so satisfying playing league. The fast levels, different rules, and specific location only makes it fun. Limited world's kinda suck, but also make the whole world feel super alive.
---
&gt;doing small stakes for a very long time while maximizing your advantage with swapping attack styles (winning slightly more often against opponents who don't).

I doubt the slightly higher win rate is enough to offset the tax

This is why I never started TL. I know that if I experience 5x xp and unlimited run I'll just get sick of osrs and never play again. Same way U.R.F. made me quit league of legends.

Taxes are not some moral obligation.
---
Country was in fact founded on bullshit government taxes and regulations (land exploration).
---
Taxes are a diversion of labor to fund government programs.
---
It's fine to argue about the morals of good social programs and how we should do better by our people.
---
But let's not pretend the government is known for being efficient or good with money.
---
Go Chicago where the taxes rates are through the roof inflation is out of control poverty and homelessness is rampant. High taxes sure must mean better services right?
---
And don't cite the poverty rate check the supplemental poverty measure.
---
It's far more well founded and academic yet rarely published.
---
Ask yourself why.

Also ask yourself why you hear bullshit like California New York and Chicago having good economies meanwhile people literally die on the streets.

Those high taxes sure did alot to save them.

This needs to be in the game already. There's no reason not to. Any reason is an excuse. Where there's a will there's a way and they literally don't want it.

Not really sure about bans but pretty sure there is a plugin for 3rd party clients that can see the implings before they spawn on the map because they are invisible or something. I dont know what what this has to do with intended looting systems though cause we definatly are not supposed to see them before they appear

only 80 lul. what is this day 4?

He killed his own series, his need for perfection was his downfall.

Taking this long for each episode is suicide, if he was more consistent, one per week, even with less progress, he would maintain his huge success.

But he chose this path, good luck swampman.

People saying a 2 spec 80+ max hit magic weapon or 4t fire wave isn’t op seriously blow my mind.

I distinctly remember using a g maul as a main hand. Also I trained from 60-70 attack soley with a dds because I had cold everything I owned to buy a whip, and needed 70 attack to use it. I paid a shit ton of money on that thing. Back when they were  8m

The maul and axe are easily held with one hand by resting in on their shoulder, but are swung with both hands. All the others are easily held with one hand regularly before attempting to attack
---
Not creating an argument just being salty
---
I sold as well for 8m loss. What people in this thread don't realize is that even a 2% dps boost crashes arcane to 80-120m. Put an offer in at 100 and watch the q/a tomorrow, imo.

I only have one account (2100+ total) and I'm honestly using TL as a break from the main game. After getting 93 slayer and finishing the Western Elite diary, I felt pretty wiped on everything. No objectives really set anymore (as I'm still a ways off from Elite Desert diary), and I didn't even feel like afk fishing or woodcutting, my usual go-to's when I don't feel like doing anything actually engaging.
---
TL has given me freshly reinvigorated me though. Coming up on my fifth relic soon. Meanwhile, I log into my main, collect dailies, so some farming contracts/Hespori kill and then go right back into League. I feel like by the time League is over, I'll be refreshed and ready to dive back into the max grind.
---
I think that might have been me lol
---
People "lend" gp to streamers just for the chance to have their name said aloud by the person streaming. People get major dopamine rushes from that for some reason.

And I thought Brad and Matty Matheson going noodling was good content.
---
That's because scamming in EVE isn't actually against the rules. As long as you aren't scamming real life items/currency, passwords, or in new player zones there are no rules against scamming at all. It's just apart of the game.
---
Did you take my visafe???
---
It definitely doesn't Always refer to range, and on this sub it absolutely refers to Random Number Generation.

No one uses "rng" to refer to ranged in RS.

I haven't heard of any plans for future twisted leagues. Twisted (Zeah) league was the first and they plan on having other leagues but none of the jmods said anything about a second twisted league.
---
Wonder what the DPS is with that relic
---
Gonn need pics or proof.. for science
---
Its viable everywhere where you'd use the arcane. If you think the +10% mage damage doesnt outweigh the -5 prayer and lack of defence you are lost. Defence in this game is useless. What good is a lot of defence when you can just kill the boss before the boss kills you? This tome literally renders the arcane useless even if they nerf the tome down to 2.5% dmg boost.
---
He probably wants to do something else. Let's face it, the content he provides is amazing but the grinds for his account are incredibly draining even with the best attitude.

Ashihama, what a pathetic name

In a combat system that was designed 20 years ago, that is the only way they can implement mechanics. That doesn't mean they're good.

????????
---
Imagine not having an alt with veng

My thoughts exactly

Eh only if you're just grinding vork. If you plan to mix it up with other bosses rigour will make a huge difference

Imagine not being able to veng with an alt in a fight unless you’re in multi

Master farmers are not even close to the best source of ranarr seeds, and you assume its the only way.

I feel like if you’re asking this your not a maxed total main. You have to have more brain cells then that to focus on maxing RC and mining.
---

Not a word. Try again with at least 40 brain cells

I think it just means someone went to the website and tried to recover their account. I don't think it means they are compromised at all.

That's a trap. Go to official site and change everything there. You can also report that email to google I think

This is cool as hell

38 minutes with that gear is also pretty beastly.

If both passed, the question with the MOST yes votes would be implemented. So if one passed with 77% and one with 80%, the 2nd would go through. The way the questions were posed meant there was no way to be in favour of both questions *and* showing a preference.
---
What you described is how they should have been polled.
---
Probably fake. A good thing to do is copy the link for “reset password”, paste it in notepad and see if it’s legit. Also by clicking on the email address it will show you the actually email address that it was sent from. I get a ton of these a day on an email that I never signed up for runescape.
---
A good thing to do is enabled 2FA and use a strong password that you haven’t used before.

please make the new offhand mage book an upgrade to the arcane spirit shield and not the mages book. Call it an arcane insignia or something.

this please. When I don't have access to my monitor I simply can't be asked to play runescape on my laptopscreen as its a new resolution and runescape is simply unplayable on it.

Everytime I need to go I can't resist the pull of the sand casino. idk how you do it :P

I remember they said there was lots of cool idea's for new rewards, what did we get? Just BIS flat power creep.

Is there a big crossover between users from 07scape and users from WSB? I fucking hope so, because thats my two fave subs.
---
Is that your ign?
---
Is what ?
---
It's BiS Vasa crystal, last time I checked it wasn't BiS anywhere else important. Last time I checked you still don't use rapier at vasa crystal usually because you use lance for setting up olm, meta is to claw spec crystals iirc. Pretty sure the main use it has is doing inefficient afk slayer tasks when you're afraid of the cost of a blowpipe or want to train melees.

Ironically probably more than half of the no voters are shitty pures that never even train prayer cause M'clvl
---
No, the point is exactly as stated?
---
It makes it easier to use certain prayers in tandem with other game mechanics. Not hard to understand bud lol
---
We deserve answers here. The whole thing is out in the open now; it looks even worse if there's still no mod transparency at this point.
---
I agree that freely being able to switch whenever you want isn't the right thing, but if you could swap a relic once at say 10k/20k/40k points it wouldn't be that insane, you'd still have to grind a lot, but it wouldn't completely limit you to only being able to do one path in leagues. With those numbers a total of about 100 people would have been able to swap one relic, with nobody being able to swap 2.
---
ye hope you go dry 2k+ kc now for another tbow split
---
Strange how this was so hush hush
---
Thanks bro
---
They probably wanted to keep this under wraps because osrs has a larger player base iirc. Having the currency in game devalued would drive away a massive player base. This could potentially affect the worth of the company itself.
---
It is very likely that there are more potential exploits in the game that either they are not yet aware of, or are aware but have no way to fix immediately without shutting all the servers down for an extended time. 
---
People knowing that the game *can* be exploited like this could potentially prompt others to try to find other potential vulnerabilities and exploit the game (and devalue the company) even further.
---
That being said, Rendi is absolutely right in making Jagex aware of this and shame on them for not at least acknowledging how he saved their asses just now.
---
Threads popped up a lot on Reddit with rumors and speculation (obviously nothing concrete) but it was hard to see even that because so many comments and posts got removed.
---
God I can't believe it was actually him, this changes everything
---
No it’s not? You’re trying too hard to put words in my mouth and failing at making a failed straw man argument out of our point that: it just doesn’t matter to players who don’t cry over pking.
---
Wrong font, its a no from me dawg.
---
I just said it as it was, it's a .08 dps loss. Don't see how that's misleading it's just the truth, deciding to disprove that yourself is not something I accounted for no. I'll have a limited number of str boosting pots so I will care about unpotted max hits, 96 is definitely what I want.
---
Make sure you claim your triple double xp while you're there
---
I always knew it was possible to double money! 
---
And yet people told me not to trust the guys at the G.E. saying they could do it.
---
He's right - this incredibly devalues all current no-beard locked iron women. Vote no to all beard related polls.
---
Jagex just needs to buyout runelite and make it the official client
---
they looked out of place on rune armor tbh, was a eye sore.
---
the hero jagex needs but not the hero jagex deserves
---
i would find a way to safe spot fire giants or head guards tbh
---
Bruh, that's "intentional hyping"
---
i posted it aswell
---
This is just embarrassing on behalf of Jagex. I can understand not wanting the method to spread but god this is not even close to the right way to avoid situations like this.
---
They probably just purchased a bunch of fresh f2p accounts. Wouldn't be expensive if you were profitting billions per day

Making all pre-bulge platelets obsolete? Sounds like power creep to me.

you attributed the 0.08 dps to the prayer and made no mention of potion decay which is why i commented in the first place lol
---
&gt;I'll have a limited number of str boosting pots so I will care about unpotted max hits, 96 is definitely what I want.
---
fair and understandable
---
Ahh my man.
---
Time to update the Drama calendar!
---
Also thanks Rendi for literally being a hero lmao
---
How many times do you have to post this?
---
still sounds like this would work provided you could find other ways to crash worlds/force roll backs.
---
obviously stopping the actual intentional world crashing is a good start though XD
---
Yeah, buddy.
---
This is the problem with the subreddit's mods being so lovey-dovey with Jagex. It leads to extreme censorship.
---
So were you one of the exploiters or were you just investigating like Rendi?
---
Respect
---
I'd usually wave this off as a conspiracy theory but it's way too plausible... I've noticed the comments and posts missing, and the posts about worlds crashing. This is spooky, I really appreciate you posting this.
---
exploit awareness is the best way to get it patched, dunno what the fuck the deal is with that.
---
Smh my head some people these days

Why is mage not allowed a good item? Everyone wants to nerf it all to hell as if it isnt already useless
---
Like $40k ish

should be 5% for arcane 2.5% for mages book, making the arcane still valauble lol.
---
But you need money for that right?
---
The same thing happened to me last week. In my case, i probably deserved to get muted, but going from a one time 1 day mute i had a year ago to a permamute? That seems a little ridiculous, no other game i know of has such harsh restrictions. Jagex really needs to show evidence for these types of punishments if they want to validate them. I feel for you brother, hope you get your case resolved.
---
Oh my God. This bug is insane, what's even more insane is the guy that ran 2000 accounts.. wonder what kind of hardware he had.
---
Agree that mace is fucking sick. And so is the armour 
---
The current armour and mace look like dollar store versions of this
---
exactly this, and call it arcane insignia, to merge it with the arcane spirit shield.
---
I just cant understand how anyone could know the email. I use it only for osrs and I dont go to any sketchy sites. I dont even use any 3rd party clients
---
I don't know if many other people can empathise with this, but when an organisation prioritises engagement through content creators first and foremost, it makes me feel second rate. Please don't misinterpret this, I do have an appreciation for the value content creators bring to a community and organisation.
---
I lose faith in the organisation and content creators when I hear about the first path of damage control when dealing with a potential catastrophic situation is to throw out NDAs and/or dismissing community concerns. When left in the rumour mill, I believe many assume the worst and with a hesitance to address the issue, I can only think to compare organisational values to how Sony dealt with their personal compromises in 2011 (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage#Explanation_of_delays for more details).
---
Rendi, you put yourself out there and have done a lot of controversial acts to bring knowledge to the OSRS community. I understand you didn't get the response from Jagex you may have sought originally and I'm disappointed for you, it must feel upsetting.
---
I will be following this topic to see if Jagex wants to incentivize the playerbase to either fight for acknowledgement of current issues/bugs or to turn a blind eye.
---
Ty based rendi
---
Because this is a forum for talking about a video game. A game breaking bug is worthy of discussion. The main abusers are gonna abuse it anyway. Censoring discussion isn't going to magically stop it.
---
You might find this useful: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=sharing
---
I feel like this part of the video was really exaggerated, If the dupes had gone off and destroyed the value of gp then I'm sure that there would've been a rollback.
---
Obviously a rollback of several days would be catastrophic, but probably not as bad as the entire game's economy being dismantled.
---
It's true, just as there will always be cheaters that haven't been banned. It's an arms race, and they'll always be keeping up with each other.
---
Pretty sure the current proposed model is hella bigger than that chain mace
---
Oh mighty God, spread the word.  [/u/Mrjmfs](https://www.reddit.com/u/Mrjmfs/)

Glough and cough dont rhyme with ploughe tho
---
Could it be that the negative effect of 110b entering the game is far less if nobody knows it had entered the game?
---
Whereas if people think that much has entered the game they will panic and actually react disproportionately as most people don't really have an understanding of the actual impact of that amount of money entering the game?
---
Their actions seem sensible to me, just a shame the content creators they trusted decided that the truth must be known regardless of its impact. Irresponsible I think.
---
Why go through the effort of making 2k accounts when theres discords that sell bulk tutorial island accounts at 100k-150k gp a pop.
---
Theyre probably mostly a ton of these type of accounts.
---
The 24 hr mute is from a pmods report then jagex reviews it
---
Fire surge with tome and being 4t is barely better DPS than sang staff at olm, and with no healing and worse mage bonus because tome is way worse than arcane. 
---
Not that much of a DPS increase.
---
Because the effect of 110b entering the game is probably a lot less than people think it is. People's perception of the impact of 110b entering the game is worse than the reality and so by not letting them know you mitigate the effects of this bug on the game.
---
Jfc
---
Thanks for the video!
---
Sounds like really difficult problem to completely fix. The fundamental issue is that when two players trade just before a crash or rollback, it's possible that the trade is rolled back on only one side depending on when the players last logged out. This is because your character's data is only saved on logout (and every 15 minutes when logged in according to this video, I guess).
---
One particular problem in Runescape is that you can use the same character on any server, which means that character data has to be stored on a different server than the ones you play on. In a game where each character is tied to a specific server it might be possible to save after every trade, but in Runescape it would just flood data server with a huge amount of traffic. And of course drop trading is also possible, so your data would also have to be saved every time you drop or pick up an item. It's just not a realistic solution.
---
So in order to permanently fix this issue they have to guarantee that every crash and rollback resets all characters to the exact same point in time. And by that I mean that if a server crashes, even players on other servers have to be rolled back. Otherwise player A could trade to player B, player B could hop worlds and player A could crash his world to roll back his account.
---
Increasing server specs can reduce the chance of a crash happening, but I think it's inevitable that another server crashing method will be found in the future. Hopefully Jagex can find a solution by then...
---
That’s not even remotely helpful
---
*cough* Rendi's new vid *cough*
---
I appreciate that Rendi took initiative to bring this to the Dev team's attention, because he saved us from an event that would have been more significant than the Fally Massacre.
---
However, I'm going to play devil's advocate on the censorship, even though this thread is heavily leaning towards Rendi's opinion that the censorship was to cover Jagex's ass.
---
Censorship isn't a bad thing when a bug like this exists. OSRS  isn't a moon landing system that will graceful fail in every situation we can think of. If the exploit was possible in the clan wars situation, it's likely that it could be replicated elsewhere. Giving the entire community a platform to discuss it increases the risk that others will find more ways to exploit the issue, without giving the team an opportunity to investigate and put a proper fix in place.
---
I think we need to be careful about calling the censorship malicious, as opposed to an emergency response to a difficult situation.
---
This video and it's overall tone will prevent Jagex from discussing the issue without being labeled as forced to do so, which is another difficult situation for them. They can't win no matter what they do. How will we know if they were going to explain it to us once they had patched things up?
---
In any case, it's out in the open now so we'll get another stamp for the drama calendar.
---
Again, thanks for being proactive on this Rendi, you really have saved us a lot of grief, but I'm not convinced on your conclusions with the censorship.
---
There was no chat log on the 24H mute provided, nor justification/evidence provided on behalf of the jmod that perma muted me
---
lol the only reason i got back into OSRS was to have some fun pvping with friends XD
---
Where there is a will there is a way, i can almost guarantee that it will come back in the not too distant future. Since it seems that the clan wars version of this has been flagged I could give an example but I dont want to potentially be the one who discovered the new method via pure conjecture.
---
What did you say? You clearly have some idea of what you said..
---
how many/long
---
You’re a legend for trying to get this story out. I was going to watch it tomorrow morning but I’m glad I watched it in bed just now. That was crazy
---
Wait what's the problem with making gear not BIS anymore? The power has to creep somewhere and mage is by far the worst style for high level PVMing. Sure it devalues the arcane, remember when ACB was BIS? What about pre GWD when black d'hide was BIS?
---
10% might seem excessive at first but mage will still be the lowest DPS style in the game for high level PVM and it's not even close. It's really due for an overhaul to make it competitive with scythe/tbow on some level.
---
Are you blind or something? this armor is new bis melee, the crush accuracy is massive dps boost
---
The first set of numbers is for an NPC that doesn't exist and not an olm claw. Basically just a blank sheet with some def levels. The second part towards the bottom where I said roughly 1/6th is in reference to the numbers you just quoted.
---
sounds like the lengths to which someone needs to go in order to force a client-side induced server crash were thought to be impossible to coordinate. These efforts required the use of a full server controlled/directed at the sole purpose of crashing the server. 
---
Multi accounting taken to botfarming-levels of extremes, in other words.
---
Huge respect to Rendi.  I have no doubt if Jagex were dumb enough to take any action towards you that the community will have your back, like you had ours.
---
Nothing that I deemed worthy of even a report, hence the making of this post.. it was very likely a bankstander reporting me in response to a conversation I had on the side with a friend in public chat about irl things and alcohol/weed lol..
---
This is good for ~~bitcoin~~ rsgp.
---
yeesh
---
Such wow jagex approved
---
Jagex just brushes you off. Ridiculous
---
Please tell me when you find out cuz i dont know
---
Lolol the reddit admins are in on it. They don’t want to stop that sort of thing. Special interests are what keep this site $$$$ profitable.
---
So Jagex should do the responsible thing and take the servers offline until there is a fix.
---
That's fucking insane
---
Garbage that only wins by using bots vs. Garbage that only wins by using bots
---
no. I'm not blind. I'm making an observation based on the fact that in order to release a new set of melee armor they have to give it the same defensive stats as adamant and the same str bonuses as Bandos, BUT because they're adding some accuracy it's totally okay. I just think it's stupid for the sake of keeping some items that are so easy and not even a challenge to get we have to release new HARDER content for items that don't even surpass the old. I mean shit the least they could have done was offer a slight bump to str if the defense stats are gonna be that garbage.
---
are opinions allowed? I respect j1mmy as a creator but I personally do not enjoy his content
---
The real story is this "Bolton" discord user

And this, folks, is the Streisand effect
---
dharoking requires alot of effort and is very sweaty, most ppl just afk it without paying much attention
---
The game has never been real life bro
---
&gt;Yes there is a possibility of it coming back just like every glitch
---
Straight up not true. There are absolutely ways to patch some types of bugs easily and be confident they won't return. There are many others that you can be sure will come back because applying a temporary fix is quicker than developing a full fix to the root of the error
---
You've been frozen
---
rendi is the GOAT for this one.
---
its already broken op as is and you want to make it even stronger, really?
---
Imagine being a boat fanboy, with 173637459 dead HC’s.
---
As long as the mods aren't breaking Reddit wide rules like doxing and invading other subreddits they don't really care.
---
So your point is that accuracy doesn't do anything when you're already hitting every attack anyway. And also that some pieces of gear make bigger differences than others.
---
I don't see how that makes accuracy useless at bossing. You're stating the obvious about situations that either never happen or aren't relevant to any decisions the player ever has to make.
---
but he's not looking for perfection... just in this episode he laid out that he's not getting max melee/ranged stats for the theater
---
what is burning man
---
This is one of the best death animations in game imo
---
dinh gang rise up \\o/
---
Please, 3 spawns is not enough for all of zeah, you hardly even see implings across zeah because the spawns are pretty much permamently camped.
---
the bug hinged around getting 2,000 people in a small area in a single  world to lag the server out, having someone at jagex work night shifts making sure no random worlds suddenly filled up is simple enough while the bug was patched.
---
You generally want to save account information whenever a change is made to the account information you want saving (which is generally replicated information). I've no idea how or when Jagex saves player data, but that's how I do it.
---
Why would you go through the effort to get hacked accounts when you can literally use lvl 3 f2p accounts?

---
OSRS community should vote this video for a golden gnome award for 2020.
---
Jagex don’t pay him for his videos, YouTube do.
---
ok so 2x is double, 3x is triple, 4x is quadruple, so what is 100x?
---
What is this bug? what is going on?
---
I'm fine with it being impling only one of the challenges of a area restricted.
---
However the number of impling spawns needs to be improved very least for this league.  Its far far far to small for the region and density of players, and amount of players looking to catch them.
---
Typically most players ignore implings so lower ones especially are plentiful across the numerous spawns for the main region of the game.  However since there are only 3 spawn locations I believe in Zeah, they get depleted/camped out extremely quickly.
---
The runescape community is fucking terrible. This thread is full of petulant children that don't realize how many thousands of players would immediately seek out how to do the glitch if it was made more public.
---
Your account can only be logged into one server at a time.
---
Going into the next league i think endurance should be a default, it makes the game more fun considering you’re starting over and it’s temporary anyway- would allow them to add a new rune to a tier 1 slot
---
You can pay for runners and get 200k+ xp/hour. 
---
*laughs in Agility*
---
Posted right on the day of the weekly Q&amp;A stream, impeccable timing.
---
I mean, I understand that none of the devs on the couch tonight have anything to do with handling dupes/glitches. But Jagex is going to look bad when Jmods are going to dodge the topic entirely.
---
How the fuck does making this more public help literally anyone? I'm so fucking lost here just seems like a bunch of autists cumming over the fact they get to complain about something new. Fuck all of you.
---
No, the damage has already been done and had been going for ages. 
---
You won’t see a roll back unless they are rolling back months.
---
I have no clue. just seen someone say roll backs take about 5 hours and just wanted to know if one was coming. would be pointless to train if so
---
Check out the video on hot that rendi posted
---
Theres a reason we stall for it and i can some it up in one word. RS3. No, we do not need to add more bis apart from monster specific items, youre literally killing content everytime theres a bis item, and in this case,its nothing but bis essentially killing so many damn bosses. Thank god we only pass updates on polls and most likely most of this stuff wont even get close to passing
---
This won’t get mentioned in the q and a’s
---
More interested in the beard coming into the game than the armours. Jagex pls include beard in poll thanks
---
Did you give yourself silver?
---
That’s like laughing at your own joke.
---
They will not be doing a rollback that far. No way.
---
Bolton used to be riot if I remember right. Guy was toxic.
---
Server can't handle it. How they do it is every 15-10 minutes your account is saved. So it will loop every 10 15 min etc. Why that is so it won't lag the server. And you have temp memory that is what is saved till it saves after 10 - 15 min...
---
He was hired from riot what do you expect
---
H
---
Not even close
---
Wait till server laggs again. See my other topic than you understand I hope
---
Pretty incomprehensible paragraph you wrote there.

It has been going on for months, not days.
---
We don't deserve Rendi and fuck whoever is overlooking/running the OSRS content creator discord
---
Annoying af
---
Can we actually get a look at this so called **backlog**. A lot of shit gets throw there never to be heard again. 
---
Some simple communication with ‘we no longer see this as a high priority’ or some other reason why you’ve chosen to just take it off there.
---
Sorry you find it hard to believe. It's in their TOS that you accept when you make an account. You don't own your account and Jagex can do whatever they want with it.
---
Right. But his relationship with Jagex is an essential part of his career as a content creator for the game and his overall standing in the community. He’s not just in it for the money. Otherwise I don’t think he would be doing the type of high effort niche content he does.
---
I really wish he'd stream again. I don't think spoilers are an issue as we're pretty much all caught up with his gains. It would really break the monotony of grinds, and it wouldn't matter if he was just killing the same shit for hours on end, other streamers already do that. If he's worried about money in the slightest, streaming would help.
---
He won't have a chance at one now but he definitely deserves one
---
You're talking out of your ass dude. That's not what a contract is and it's in their TOS that you sign when you make an account that you don't own it and they can do whatever they want with it.
---
He doesn’t require a relationship with jagex to put out a video..
---
And yes, he very much would be in it for the money, that’s their job and income.
---
Maybe this is part of the reason why bonds sky rocketed in price and are starting to drop back down again?
---
Support
---
As much as I wanna say Gz your gonna enjoy praying bones at a altar. That 1m won’t last long
---
Then how are you shitting on this guy, any 99 is an achievement and still takes a fair degree of dedication and effort
---
Okay did they seriously not have something that flags 2k accounts all logging in at the same time from the same IP?
---
I decided to go for the outfit because I knew that my heart needed it and luckily the first outfit looks better than the later two.
---
Not really. A friend of mine learned most of this as a pre-teen and Runescape inspired an info-sec career. None of this is complicated.

Buy them from that guy up near the sulphur mine? He’s got 50k

So nothing new, just as with the last video?
---
Ye, I'm kinda allergic to censorship.
---
How do you know he didn’t?
---
What sex is that?
---
yeah, it sucks don't get me wrong, but honestly it's basically a drop in the bucket. especially because most of it probably got banned on accounts; the thing about a exploit like this is the value grows exponentially so selling any percent of it will decrease future exploits by a similar percentage.
---
Okay you realize the tbows got rolled back, so any gold buyers who bought gp during that period got scammed (assuming they didn’t back charge their payments). If what you’re saying is true, that would compromise their relationship.
---
Let’s say that it is true, for shits and giggles.
---
More power to them. I’m mortified by jagex employee salaries.
---
The glitch specifically required 2000 accounts; I'm sure DROVES of people would just hop right onto it!

The crash is patched with anything related to its current form as shown in the video. What likely isn't patched is the ability to trade before a crash, which has been an idea passed around for a couple of years anyways.

I'm pretty sure this is the only footage out there of the [REDACTED] actually being performed in real time.
---
For whoever finds it interesting here it is, and a little bit on the timeline on this bug and why the censorship is a good thing
---
My guess is there is a panicked Jagex staff meeting happening today.
---
I really hope not but wouldn't surprise me
---
Welcome to real life. If you earn more than I think 38k a year (in the uk anyway) anything over that is 40% taxable
---
The reason why this exploit was so hush hush is because they didn't want everyone to know about it. Part of what you need to do for this exploit is getting the servers offline. And so attempting to fix it would require them to take servers offline for a bit and if everyone knows about it, more people will try it as they're trying to patch it.
---
Tbow incident comes to mind.. jagex obviously is a sketchy company where the mods implement and use exploits to gain real life money
---
I’d remove posts telling people how to do it as well...
---
January: Konar's drop table included 2m+ drops of Saradomin Brews (amongst other things)
---
February: A rogue Twisted Bow spawn appeared outside of the farming guild. It has now been replaced by a Twisted Bush.
---
March: They left the death fog on the new duel arena for the final number of players, causing everyone to instantly die.
---
April: They made it so you couldn't trade essence at the Ourania altar, destroying one of the best RC XP methods with runners.
---
May: No drama!
---
June: No drama!
---
July: Warding fails.
---
August: No drama!
---
September: OSBuddy release 'enhanced mode' which enables 1-click blackjacking, chaos altar prayer training and construction. We are still experience the effect of this with 3pc's receiving greater scrutiny from Jagex.
---
October: EVScape, a popular streaming currently doing an unofficial Group Ironman series, was banned whilst streaming for a macroing (major). This ban was almost instantly reversed as it turns out this was an error.
---
November: You will likely be aware of the duplication glitch that Rendi has produced a video on. If not, I would recommend watching it.
---
Where's the rollback nerd?
---
Bug abusing at its finest x Colin
---
people should be more upset that jagex would have never even fucking told us.
---
Video would've been better at educating the community on the matter without the conspiracy stuff attempting to sway opinion on Jagex's methods. This was obviously a huge game integrity issue and I think Jagex chose to keep it as internal as possible due to that and whilst trying to fix it before it got any more out of hand.
---
The Runescape economy crumbles, mains are in shambles. Prices skyrocket. Riots continue at the grand exchange
---
Meanwhile ironmen stroll through unaffected
---
For real though thank you for spotting this and trying in any way you can to help
---
Hot take but Jagex trying to do this quietly was probably their best option. What do you really think the average RS player would be looking for this information for? How to get in on it. 
---
Personally I would have shut it all down while a duct tape fix was worked on because, like the video stated, the longer this glitch exists the more dirty money gets into the system. Downtime sucks but a market crash is far far worse.
---
Also, leaving a Discord server doesn't make you immune to NDAs especially if they're legally binding, lmao
---
All of this is difficult to an average person whos knowledge base is not in computer programming...
---
No worries at all homie. We will quit for months or years but this weird ass game brings us back
---
This guy talks like he thinks he’s some kind of big hero.
---
Just the xp from tithe farming is worth doing when you only have 2 farm spots no? Especially due to the tons of league points from farming activities
---
 
---
I  also think when discussing mage gear that the boot slot is fairly weak  compared to the shield slot and more deserving of an upgrade. Magic is  primarily used in hybrid content (dks, ToB, Xerics, Inferno, GwD  healing) and because of a limited inventory space eternals are never  really chosen and mainly just see use in magic only content like kraken  and maybe barrows.
---
However that's besides my main point so i thought i'd leave it in the comments.

A couple of things I can't wrap my head around  
---
1. Why are you people always trashing the mods? Who gives a shit if they thought it was better for the game to make sure no info leaked in regards the bug? Hell, I'd probably do that too if I wanted to search and destroy these dudes destroying osrs and not leaking out info that they are caught. Mods make a living trough OSRS and every decision they make on situations like these are crucial to them and their families. Why is everyone doubting the J-mods on every possible occasion? Seriously.  
---
2. Why would anyone think OP made the wrong choice by reporting this stuff?
---
3. Why are you people always so angry and upset even in these "All's well that ends well" - situtations? What the hell is wrong with you people?
---

Netflix wants to know your location

Disclosure is a two way thing. If we're to take Rendis info as correct, they stonewalled him and refused to acknowledge it. For all he knew, they hadn't seen his messages or they weren't planning on doing anything. They don't need a statement, just a "k we'll check it out" and he knows they're on it. Alternatively, he's concerned that they're aren't aware the issue is as bad as it is and he knows it's currently ongoing, and so discloses everything ASAP as to force their hand.
---
This is all assuming Rendi is 100% with his presentation of the information. I'm a fan of forcing hands from companies, so I'm mostly on Rendi's side, but as a qualified developer I also appreciate the Jagex side of "oh fug we have to rewrite entire sections of the server code" and having a panic about it being abused on a wide scale.
---
This is why you always wait until end of the month with drama calendar.
---
Oh I see, gotcha
---
Nobody gives a shit about rendi now he's been overtaken at lowest fire cape.
---
His times up and just trying to stay relevant.
---
There's also the Duel Arena DDOSer who dumped 90B in a single day.
---
Gotta say, you're a better person than me. I would have sat by and watched the world burn.
---
Oh shit this is nice, thanks for sharing!
---
I mean... they also confirmed that in 3:48 of the video you linked though.
---
they didn't make rendi do anything. but they did make their bed.
---
Subreddit mods rarely answer questions this thread, in fact they're pretty much permanently MIA. Might be better off making a separate post to get some attention, or sending a modmail (lol)
---
It can't go lower because there's no production pressure trying to sell new ones, because the minigame is dead.
---
At current prices, it's barely 2M/H and it's comparable to raiding.
---
Rendimento is... the dark knight
---
I agree, since the root cause of the exploit is not fixed lol
---
20% combat xp bonus, because of its defensive stats. Check out the combat xp article for a detailed breakdown of how that's calculated.
---
yeah but it would be community made so jagex couldnt really do anything and i dont think it would be a problem if they didnt mind controversy in runefest
---
👌🏻 &lt;— Zero fucks given
---
Hey all. There are a few things being raised here, and we'll cover each, in some way. There's the exploit itself. There's us NDAing content creators and the responses from Mod Bolton. There's the idea of any collusion between Reddit and Jagex.   
---
In terms of the exploit. It's standard to not discuss active investigations and actions being taken, at least until after we've taken steps to resolve the issues. We became aware of a method being used to duplicate gold, and a combination of things - including tip-offs from Rendi and our system monitoring - led to us becoming aware of it very quickly. The Support and anti-cheating teams worked on removing a large amount of gold and investigated the accounts involved, whilst the SysAdmin and Engine teams were working on stopping it happening more. We remain diligent, and are yet to see any repeated occurrence of the exploit - work is continuing to improve our game systems to prevent this sort of thing from occurring again. In response to Rendi’s tip-off specifically, we were (and remain) very appreciative of his tip-offs. The video doesn’t seem to cover any of the other interactions that occurred between him and the JMods in the server in which we did quickly acknowledge his tip-offs and did thank him for his vigilance.  
---
There's no collusion or conspiring for suppression with the Reddit admins. We don't astroturf or censor posts and we will never do that. It seems that they independently took action to prevent information sharing of replication steps for duplication methods. I'd presume that they were acting entirely in good faith, and did so to prevent knowledge of the bug being made public and risk its further abuse. If that's the case, then I think it's because that they think it's better if everybody doesn't spend their time duping cash. I don't think there was any malicious action.   
---
In terms of NDAing the content creators. This is entirely separate from this specific game issue. Mod Bolton is the Head of Influencer Management, and he tried to reply to this thread at 7:07am to explain, though it looks like his comment was auto-hidden! I'll reply to my comment with his message.  
---
If you have any other questions, please do reply and ask them.
---
I mean, I for one, would rather they just have shut everything down until they fixed the issue, just so we as a community, know that there is no shenanigans going on.
---
Part of the problem is how can we, as a community trust jagex's actions are the right actions? Iether its fixed, and we can discuss the methods, or its not fixed, and the assets on the servers should be frozen.
---
Right now, the message is 'its fixed but you still cant talk about it' which tells me it might not actually be fixed, which leaves the community in a precarious position of censorship, which I am allergic to.
---
I would say that rushers would wear it for more dps making them more powerful. Although it would mean they risk more and it wouldnt be that worth considering the risk but still.
---
How would moving them over a few inches change the fact that people need to build muscle memory as to the location of their prayers?
---
Always. Even though we like to believe our effort affects the next trial, it doesn't. 
---
That is unless jagex have some interesting code that makes the trials not independent. But that's up to conspiracy theorists to believe.
---
&gt; They didn't tell you about it because they don't want people fucking abusing it.
---
Imagine thinking just any random players are gonna be able to abuse a bug like this. 2 people had to have access to 2k+ accounts to make this happen and not only that but the accounts all had to be in the same area performing actions.
---
Goodluck getting that many legit people together all at once to attempt at abusing this.
---
I'm not talking about this bug only, but all bugs in general.
---
You don't need to purchase server space to log into 2k accounts to do all bugs.
---
Drop rate is always 63% iirc just use binomial calc on the internets
---
Someone should notify Google that their not detection doesn't work
---
Thanks for your service, borther.
---
You've changed
---
That's North America for you
---
He didn’t rip kemp q off though lol he’s been doing low level fire capes for over 10 years now.
---
There's bugs where you don't need unreal amount of resources too, you know?
---
And either way, I wouldn't even call this unreal amount of resources.
---
Ah yes, because someone isn’t a saint themselves they are not allowed to call out other people.
---
Best of luck regardless Sween, this can't be a fun topic lmao
---
plz enjoy game
---
Any estimate on how much gold you were able to remove in total?
---
63% of getting item after you reach 'drop rate'.
---
I feel like part of tob is being able to fix your inventory on the fly. Please bring a warhammer and defender, let the man bringing an arcane for nylo wield the bgs.
---
&gt;NO COLLUSION
---
The people doing it rwt the gold pretty fast. They made a total of 16k USD or something
---
Why did you have to make a new account?
---
Will you be my dad
---
*Mod Bolton’s message (auto-hidden earlier this morning):*
---
Hey there Rendi, I'm sorry you felt you needed to leave the discord, or that you are in any way unappreciated. I really don't have any info on anything in-game, as my focus is wholly influencers, but I'd like to explain my comments that you discuss at the start of the vid.
---
I should clarify that the reason I was concerned about "incorrect info" leaking out of the discord, was because we were seeing a "telephone" effect on what was actually said in the chat. Players were hearing second-hand stories through streamers, and creating reddit threads with totally incorrect claims about what creators and Jagex were saying. As the person in charge of influencer, that is unacceptable regardless of the topic, and is traditionally solved with an NDA.
---
In general, NDA's don't apply to anything you bring into a channel yourself. An NDA just protects what others say in the chat, allowing both creators and Jagex to speak freely, and preventing creator conflict or content spoiling (e.g.- someone shares some info in chat for a new vid, and it leaks on another's stream). I hope you can understand how it's a tool meant to allow discussion, not stifle it.
---
Additionally, we’ll be NDAing content creators as part of the new content creator program we’ll be implementing in 2020. We want to start circulating more advanced publishing and game information in the future so that creators can pre-prep content, but that will require a decent amount of confidence in the security of the channel.
---
I hope that explains my position a little bit better. If you'd like to chat further, I sent you a friend request on Discord.
---
Making them req 80 or 85 is not really different, it would only make higher combat requeriments for custom account builds around that new gear.
---
Power creep and level requeriment is unrelated. 
---
Healthy power creep (doesn't destroy value of previous items but adds on top) and unhealthy power creep (kills/replaces old content) is also unrelated with level requeriment.
---
Balance to PvP is also unrelated to level requeriment; look at tridents, you simply can't use it on players.
---
Stop your autistic complaints around level requirements, you're being fools. Its not like "exp required on the skill" is any sort of cap, legitimate players below that threshold that are not alt accounts won't afford that new shti anytime soon any fucking way.
---
Damn dad kicked me out of the house today and this happened lmao
---
They probably did notice. Whether it has been / will be handled properly...
---
They need to put existing weaponry at its appropriate level (t bow and blowpipe at t90 and t80 respectively, not familiar enough with mage to say) and then underfill
---
$11.
---
u/rendimento , you should probably read this. Mentioning him because he won't get notifications on self replies.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYzMYcUty6s
---
Because making an exploit public is how you get it fixed when the company won't act, as was the case here.
---
It's the same whether it's a video game, an email service, or a banking website.
---
So did you or did you not exchange gp for any form of real life currency or value cos you are evading this a lot. Enjoy your bancos it seems like you bought a couple mil to power level your pure with cannonballs and got caught.
---
How long was this bug in the game before it was discovered?
---
It's a fine chariot, but where are the horses?
---
My email with password reset info got hacked
---
Do you actually do anything to follow chasing up abuses like this with legal action.
---
Or are these just big paydays for bug abusers, and is Jed just happily retired somewhere
---
Good Job team!
---
Good one
---
&gt;"We want to start circulating more advanced publishing and game information in the future so that creators can pre-prep content "
---
So content creators are going to be able to get ahead of everyone else when new content drops? Seems a tad unfair for competitions?
---
I feel like Rendi may have jumped the gun on posting this video.  Jagex is likely still evaluating the issue and planning their response to the community.  It wouldn't do anybody any good I'd they came out and said it was fixed only to be proven wrong immediately after.
---
That said, full respect to Rendi for feeling that the danger to the community was more important than having a lasting relationship with Jagex. Hopefully Jagex understands and invites him back to the content creators discord (even if he doesn't accept).
---
Ideally Jagex would be more transparent but they truly never have been. Jagex comes to the community with Action Plans not rising issues.  They tend to keep knee-jerk reactions closely under wraps because to us it's just a game, to them it's their livelihood.
---
They for sure knew about it. The second night when the two worlds crashed they were offline for hours and came back around the time we expected J mods started getting in the office. We can only assume this means once a world is crashed like this a J mod has to manually reset it.
---
The 100b got rwt for a total 5 figure sum
---
I'm sure that there are more than 2 people out there that are able and would do this but weren't aware
---
Lol, first rule of an apology NEVER say "sorry you felt that way". Fuck off
---
Well maybe you shouldn’t be leaving bones on the ground.
---
Yes, we should make RuneScape easier. why the should this game literally take 1000 hours for a single skill
---
ferocious gloves require 80 def and 80 attack, pog
---
This reminded me of that Courage the Cowardly Dog episode in which Courage and his family were enslaved by a giant robot from outer space with a hobby for carving reindeers out of wood LMFAO
---
I believe what he is saying is that discussion within the discord can't be talked about. This means people in the discord can freely discuss issues without it being parroted to other sources.
---
JK I care about other people's fun.
---
&gt;This community is so toxic towards possibly the most open and feedback driven developers of any game to date.
---
after EOC and what happened with microtransactions, there's a reflexive lack of trust. i mean i did this just now and basically said i thought jagex was trying to tank the economy for a re-reboot. 
---
it's not really fair but when you see the past couple of years and how many random times they've ended up with 2b cash glitches compared to the years 2005-2010 or something, its becoming reflexive to just say wtf are they doing.
---
You bet, but how true do you know that person to speak for him? Don’t assume
---
Hey sween, appreciate how quickly and forthright y'all handled this. You guys did well.
---
I feel that, the pool of top tier players that can play test that content isn’t a large one so either ship content blindly or play test and like you say I guess any perceived advantage isn’t massive in the grand scheme of the whole ToB. 
---
In my mind these things (and the orb and the holiday item spawners and etc etc) kinda leads an “us and them” feeling. 
---
But overall for good reason I get. content creators are obviously a massive part of strategy and in their own right are one pillar of having a strong, thriving and growing community.
---
Damn. That sure is confusing. But you definitely can get around the confusion through thorough thought though.
---
Or it could just be taken straight from the bank like Vorkath/Hydra death item reclaim or Kraken instance.
---
\&gt;It wouldn't prevent botting
---
You know what's actually frustrating to read?  People who claim they are professional programmers insisting that there's no way Jagex could be incompetent/indolent - when they've been caught being 100% provably so before.    
---
This problem has existed for almost a week now.  In that time the only response we've seen from Jagex is their attempt to censor the knowledge of the problem.    
---
Rendi has his almost entirely substantiated his viewpoint on the matter, providing great detail.
---
Jagex have:
---
a) Substantiated nothing
---
b) Not commented at all until forced to by this video
---
c) generally responded by claiming "uh, of course we were aware of this and working on it!  Rendi just beat us to the pitch haha &lt;sweating&gt;"  
---
Why exactly are you, as an alleged professional, giving the benefit of the doubt to Jagex in this debate?  Professionals traditionally try to make claims based on precedent and evidence. Why are you making a claim entirely based off... neither of those?
---
So you're saying you duplicate the object?
---
This didn't age well
---
I'm sure there are a hand full of people that have that kind of access and that would be enough to cause serious issues. It just makes cleanup significantly more annoying if even one more person abuses it.
---
Bet he dropped a sneaky N in chat
---
Hey me too, safe travels.

---
Too be fair, maces have some of the best prayer bonus stats, which makes rping a monk all the better
---
How about you do something about the ddosers then?
---
I like how every year we get new money dupe or something like that :D
---
Good to know i showed my friend with me your post. He basically said now he doesn't have to sell his crystal armor seeds.
---
Dope idea but being able store more armors in poh makes poh more even stronger, which is what dev team doesnt want to do.
---
if they truly did remove all the gp that was duped then the economy might be safe, but idk if this is still physically possible it's only going to happen next time there's a server crash.
---
They actually once stated on stream that their monitoring tool was too powerful they  could identify basically any pattern.  Like if you got up, flew to Venezuela, made a new account from a public computer, they claim they could tell it’s you based on patterns.
---
There are people employed to perform both functions. Getting the issue resolved is super important, but maintaining the faith of *the entire userbase of your game* also ranks pretty high on the priority list.
---
Neck beard alert
---
... Theyre not on about a runescape account with 2k+ total skill
---
To crash a server you need 2000 individual RuneScape accounts
---
I remember this from ages back someone explaining in a youtube comment how you could double your gp using the tbow rollback, a lot of people have been waiting for some big fuck up to come about to exploit that.. now everyone knows you can do it with a simple server crash i think we are in a bit of trouble...
---
Great, thanks for ruining another great money making method Rendi, smh my head... just let people have a little fun
---
Ikr
---
Of course they did, its just the reddit community loves to shit on Jagex at any chance they get

---
found the guy who didn’t watch the video
---
I was referencing to the fact that it took ages for jagex to notice Rendi's messages and he had to stir up some shit for them to act.
---
All it needs is another way to crash the server.
---
So far it looks like they might have only fixed the crashing but not the dupe itself.
---
You're pretty scummy trying to scare people who helped save the game and your job, since nobody would bother playing it if he hadn't of told you.
---
And your apology is fucking awful "I'm sorry you felt this way" and "don't talk or you'll break NDA" absolute scum. Why didn't you just say thank you for the information, we'll get back to you soon? 
---
The next time somebody nice finds a bug like this, you're game is done for, nobody is going to help you if this is how you treat your loyal players. 
---
What a dick head.
---
Dumb bot, reported
---
tiers are a mistake
---
Just play fixed.
---
no u
---
Ok so a 600k necklace has a 10% damage bonus but a more than likely 400m offhand mage book can't?
---
Wot
---
Sween just PM me your number, promise I’ll only call for game breaking bugs.
---
Jagex don't own discord and nobody signed anything, so that's just an empty threat at their loyal players who were trying to help.
---
Fuck off with your lies. Trying to do damage control after you shit down his neck? Pathetic.
---
Link or screenshot?
---
I disagree that this is drama
---
The issue was handled quickly and it didnt seem to affect the playerbase.
---
All we have is rendi dramawhoring that he saved the game singlehandly and being stroppy jagex did not immediately respond to him with dev only information.
---
Couldn’t potentially hundreds of people now perform this dupe if a crash is being set up? If everyone does this simple trade and log one out and leave one logged on shortly before a expected crash?
---
Real eyes realise real liea
---
&gt;Reply
---
Nerd
---
this is a point not brought up often, but a large portion of the playerbase came into the game in the last two years, while runelite allowed reordering. many of these players are used to their reordered prayers so on top of reordering being objectively superior, change sucks huge ass.
---
Smackdown when?
---
God you guys are a shit tier company for having Chinese investors as a bank.
---
Fair enough: Jagex has made terrible mistakes in the past (removing trading, wildy and old school combat) but that doesn't even remotely suggest that this situation was handled badly.
---
The game was almost destroyed. OP and the mod-team saved the day by saving the game. /r/2007scape complains about censorship and riots occur.
---
So many virgins in this subreddit proving time and time again all the reasons why they are uneducated and/or unemployed. Terrible but true.
---
whether i was being a dick or not, the fact remains that the dupe isn't fixed, the *server crash* is fixed.
---
that looks sick, we need this!
---
there was 3 months for the price of 2 during the summer. I played for many years on and off and it's the first time I saw something like that.
---
Until a new crash is discovered, that is. I'm sure the root issue is being worked on right now.
---
Dafuq?
---
mildly related but with holiday seasons coming up, please dear god people treat the retail workers nicely. they hate their lives just as much you hate yours, and they have extremely little pull in the company.

Did champions cape challenger w/10hp and then the  he exp came from the scrolls, was cb46 on completion though 🤞🏾😊
---
Hmm. Ok but if what you're saying about having nothing to gain is true why put company time and resources to sprcifically setting up and maintaining influencers? Thanks for your time.
---
Some of you HCIMs are alright
---
Don't go to Zulrah tomorrow
---
The economy-breaking dupes Rendi revealed have by no means been going on for days and can not currently be reliably replicated.
---
Could literally happen in a span of 30 minutes.
---
Don't you think they would've tried to take action against ddosers if they could?
---
You got to be some special kind of *** to think Jagex will report to a customer the steps that are being taken to fix a bug.
---
Correct. As I replied to another comment fixing something like this isnt a 15 minute task. They have to think of a fix that doeant crash the game completely and doesnt cause more bugs. They then have to code it and test it. 
---
This is just all the more reason they should want to not expose anything regarding the bug.
---
The censorship being a good thing doesn't imply he cares. It just makes sense that jagex would.
---
I was going to be sad if we went a month without this one...
---
Jagex bad
---
The issue rendi brought up with Jagex is entirely PR-centered, not programming centered.  Rendi doesn't need Jagex's help to figure out the mechanics behind this shitfest - he understood them better than they did, evidently.  It's Jagex's communication on the issue that he specifically targets.  So I'm pretty sure it's not the "tech heavy" side of you that's angry rn.  Maybe the corporate clown side?
---
this might have just blown up but at the time it was happening most a few months ago, people were saying this exact method in ge. and i dont mean the named individuals like drew and shit, i mean randoms in ge.
---
a lot of people knew about this.
---
the servers have been very unstable recently haven't they?
---
Why not try and get permission if you have hundreds of thousands of viewers? If you applied that reasoning to other youtubers of any genre then everyone would all be using the same 4 samples for every video.
---
Edit just realised it was your comment I replied too a moment ago LUL
---
I totally agree with your points on Sween. He's been professional and very patient with an upset community.
---
My biggest issue is that it's been days since this bug has been identified and all the comments he's made I feel should have been made when it was identified. Sween hasn't let us know how much money has been introduced into the game and he hasn't released information as to how this bug can be exploited for personal gain.
---
I haven't personally attempted the bug so I can't comment on whether or not it still works but I have faith in the fact it's been hotfixed to a point that if anyone attempted what was discussed in Rendi's video, they'll just be wasting their time. I also believe that fixing this issue takes a lot more work than just a hotfix and will require a lot of time and effort for Jagex staff. I believe Rendi just forced their hand on the hotfix.
---
Upvoting to either see you get justice or the Jmod Smackdown. Can you smellllllllllllla, what Jagex is cooking!?
---
Sadly not viable with the competition and limited amount of worlds, wish it would instant restock though.
---
so everytime there's a bug in the game does this count?
---
patch notes come every update "WOW LOOK AT ALL THESE BUGS, TIME TO RESET THE DAYS SINCE LAST FUCK UP COUNTER, BOYS"
---
i saw a video just now that said their head engine dev quit recently, and thats why they *can't* fix it, but take that with a pinch of salt idk, i should probably try to stop looking like a dick
---
There is no way Jagex didn't know about this, I was playing on 500/501/502 on my F2P alt with my girlfriend who just started the game. The world was full of bots who wouldn't do anything but stand in the same place for hours without logging off, then every now and again they would mass migrate somewhere (we know its clan wars now). It was odd behavior even for bots, we literally saw the same mass of bots standing around for a week or so.
---
But they literally just said there was more interaction with said customer who reported the issue, What you're annoyed about is that they only spoke to him, yet he was the one that reported it to them.
---
It's more damaging if they start releasing statements before the bug is fixed, as there's plenty of people who didn't know it was a thing, and would have known and tried to exploit it themselves had they known before the exploit became common knowledge.
---
They kept their channel open with said content creator, who tipped them off on the issue, whilst working on the issue. Not sure what more you want from them?
---
Ahahaha it’s pretty dark down here.
---
Why is it always his bday
---
If the root issue of how 15 minute rollbacks are handled is not fixed players will surely find new ways to crash servers at will.
---
And paying for runners is 120k-200k xp/hr, 230k xp/hr at max efficiency
---
\&gt;Mods censor posts talking about literal game breaking bug
---
\&gt;mods bad hurrrdurrrrrrr
---
Idk I only know league servers are shit I havent been on the main game in a minute LOL. However I'm sure they are monitoring all possible server crashes quite thoroughly. I dont think jagex is stupid I just think something like this takes time to resolve even if they maybe did put it to the back burner shame on them, but I still don't think they should be lynched for it
---
My point is that content creators - who often have a vested interest in gaining in-game advantages, and thus sometimes perform actions that are beneficial to themselves, close friends, and clanmates at the expense of all other players - should not have access to content, or even knowledge of it, well before the rest of the community, for a multitude of reasons that have already been stated here. Their feedback *should* be taken into consideration, absolutely. At the exact same time as everyone else's. Don't show content to them that you aren't ready to show to all players is the suggestion I'm making, which would almost certainly have a net beneficial effect on the game's health going forward.
---
how is it being swept under the rug when there's a thread with over a dozen jmod replies explaining what happened. are you upset there isn't an official post on something that is STILL being fixed or something?
---
I agree, if content creators wanted their content protected, wouldn't they be distributing the NDAs to Jmods and not the other way around?
---
What I meant was that we'd have nothing to gain if we forced content creators to feel like they had to stay on our good side, and act against their usual nature. We have plenty to gain from them remaining critically-minded and empowered to voice their actual opinion and expertise.
---
Sound like dimension of disaster from rs3. I like it.
---
very well done

You know who isn’t sad? Romeo. His life partner “died” and now he’s hit it off with her cousin. Sometimes you can just be happy that others are experiencing something a little you know?

So in that case; I’m glad you’re no longer going to be sad my friend, Guthan was ostracised from a young age for him wearing a skirt; but that didn’t stop him. Thanks for the chat friend , and I’m glad you’re happy.
---
I dont think you look like a dick you're just having a conversation. But I would take what you see on the internet with a grain of salt.

We have no right or reason to know why an employee of a company got fired. Are people forgetting that this is just some game?

If you drop the scroll while killing the champion you can pick up up after the kill as a trophy.
---
People have quite probably gotten away with it. Gold prices crashed over 50% in the last month. It's $0.48/m atm, far lower than it's *ever* been. That only happens when the supply increases - if none of it made it to the RWT market then prices wouldn't have changed anywhere near that much.
---
What? Bolton literally just specified that the NDA would allow content creators to receive updates/information ahead of the general population.
---
Anyone not wishing to participate would simply lose the privilege of receiving that information..
---
Fair enough,  I was just thinking in this case, it seems like the server can handle being overburdened now. I doubt there are server crashing bugs in place that aren't just overburdening it. Could be wrong.
---
It's difficult to see this as anything but a cover-up if you actively tried to prevent people that knew and wanted to create awareness from blowing their whistles    
---
And when they **did** blow them, you guys make a visit to the Subreddit to discuss your 2020 NDA program.
---
that was recorded before episode 23 tho
---
They could make it so the fee is taken straight from the bank.
---
I'm having a blast and looking forward to another 49(?) days.
---
My goal is at least one solo cox run.
---
there is an active exploit, and information about it is being hidden because it is an **active exploit**.  
---
and people cannot grasp that that is a standard practice.  
---
if you're going on vacation for a week and the lock on your back door is broken, you don't fucking tell anyone. you'd get 10 thousand idiots showing up for free shit.
---
If only you knew how bad things really are
---
He made solid 100$ off that video, so unless you livr in venezuela that money is almost nothin
---
What good does exposing such an absolutely massive bug do before it is fixed? It only serves to drive people to attempt to do it, considering there's tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to be made, I don't blame them for keeping quiet until they are 150% sure it's taken care of
---
It sounds like you just don't like him, and that's perfectly fine
---
The coolest concept I have ever seen is that mace and that armour. Rip Justiciar
---
I want his phat.
---
They had since the 22nd to say literally fucking anything about the issue that was (supposedly) patched by than.
---
how does he have that name in game lool
---
Nice man
---
Are you dating a 9 year old? Dude...

Because of this video we were able to know what happened ***today.*** Sween has been answering a ton of questions in the video thread and trying to clarify as much as possible. You may be right and they might have kept this whole thing under wraps, but that's getting speculative and I won't bother one way or the other. 
---
What bugs me about the Rendi video is that this was very much still an active situation and he just had to get the scoop out to get all of the attention associated with it. He very much deserves all of the praise for his service to the community, but if we are to believe Sween at all then there's still parts of this that haven't been resolved. We all know that there are going to be a lot of people trying to replicate this, so to put the video out there before Jagex is confident that the whole thing has been patched is inflammatory and doesn't put the health of the game first. If he puts out the same video next week he risks someone else or Jagex spilling the beans and stealing the thunder, but giving Jagex a chance to fix a game breaking exploit is better for the game.

Looks like I missed what happened in october. Can someone explain?
---
Only logged on my own phone and my own pc to play osrs. I've used the original osrs page as well as Runelite to access my acc. Could Runelite be a possibility?
---
An Ironman could have hypothetically duplicated items too, right?
---
Unless I'm misremembering it shouldn't have been limited to just gold
---
lets try adding words onto this so its readable for all audiences:
---
____
---
heres the timeline:  
---
*an exploit is found and used*  
---
there is *now* an active exploit  
---
*several community members discover that some kind of foul play is going on*  
---
*the general community begins to pick up that something funny is happening*  
---
information about it is being hidden because it is an active exploit.  
---
people cannot grasp that that is a standard practice *to prevent abuse*  
---
Except no. That's *literally* what an NDA is. It means you are not allowed to talk about something you know.
---
Didn’t appreciate this when I was grinding inferno (still am) for a good two weeks lmao. Would get to jad, it get to the 60 waves and just disconnect black screen. Thought it was my connection but later found out it wasn’t, literally made me quit RS for a week since it happened multiple times.
---
it really is just an effect of 2007 and EoC destroying their trust in jagex. It seems absurd but some wounds will never heal.
---
Ayyye this man knows what’s up.
---
Hint: the duel arena is the problem again
---
Let the people decide
---
Bh2 update
---
They’re literally paying for vote manipulation right now.
---
You couldn't stop the truth, so now you're trying to inject an alt-truth.
---
Not going to work.
---
actual timeline:
---
Bug happens
---
Rendi raises alarm
---
Bug happens again
---
Jagex "fix" bug by freezing the accounts of everyone in the worlds in question
---
Exploit is now no longer active, servers are patched to be not destroyable with current method
---
People who have heard about exploit or had their accounts frozen go on the subreddit asking wtf is going on 
---
Automod bans them, Jagex stay silent
---
People continue asking as days pass
---
Automod continues to ban, Jagex continue to stay silent
---
Rendi releases the video
---
Suddenly Jagex are more eloquent than Thomas Jefferson
---
Jagex send in PR team to deliver alternate narrative of "just censoring when it was an active exploit haha &lt;sweats&gt;"
---
watch rendi last video.
---
POH links me to almost everything
---
Never shared any of my details with anyone. Password is VERY strong to say the least, never using any common ones.
---
Ah lovely, thanks again
---
How do I wipe my machine dude
---
Slayer is already 90k/hr long term, tasks like smoke devils are almost 200k xp/hr. Buffing mage without some kind of nerfs to barrage will only increase the xp/hr.
---
There is almost no task that you do while slaying efficiently that you do not barrage currently.
---
Thanks dude much appreciated
---
Maybe he shouldn't make a video to get clicks if he doesn't know that the bug is 100% gone.
---
Jagex' stance on this issue makes exact sense from a professional perspective. You're taking the right steps and we appreciate the communication.
---
Well, good for them because they don't have 10000 eyes on the glitch. They now have 100000 eyes on the glitch because no one fucking understand how the internet works.
---
so if u wear dragon lance whit it u get a lot %damage ? but does it mean its defence gets lower to maintain balance  since it is a 60 tier ?
---
I definitely read it as a special attack (not a spell from your spell book).
---
I appreciate your comment it all helps
---
Jagex won't even pay its hard working employees a decent wage.  I wonder if they would spend the money to own a subreddit.
---
e is defined in tons of different ways.
---
"Hmm I've been called out on my lies.  Guess I'll just repeat my lies, get my 8 hours in that way"
---
Good press is still good. Rendi is not at fault of anything, awarenes of Jagex incompetence is always welcomed. They need harash feedback on their wrongdoings to wake the fk up
---
well, im kinda lost then. you're going all master debater and shooting me down but we apparently have the same argument but im not ending it with a catchphrase
---
And she's smarter than him. :)
---
It should have stats of mages book but with 2% damage bonus. Arcane and by extension corp absolutely shouldn't be devalued
---
You're not lost, you're just lying and clueless.
---
It involves trading items between two accounts and then causing a rollback so both accounts have the items/gold. It takes hours for you to be able to log back on after the rollback so if you tried to do it by dropping items theyd disappear.
---
Want to discuss but not read?
---
Making them tradeable has a much larger impact than literally making them tradeable, due to the death mechanics in OSRS. Making "closed" rune pouches tradeable likely would have passed. You open the pouch to make it usable, and it's untradeable while open.
---

---
They already said there was communication than what he stated.
---
I would imagine some of them had signed NDAs on the jagex visit while other members of the discord haven't because they have never been.
---
oh 110b wasn't bad enough to rollback then
---
Either way, from here I would recommend the following:
---
1. Scan your computer for malware.
---
2. Remove any detected malware.
---
3. Restart the computer and rescan for malware.
---
4. If no longer detected, use secure browsing to change the password to your email account.
---
5. Enable 2FA on your email account.
---
6. Log into runescape and change the password on your account (Ensure this is different to your email)
---
7. Ensure 2FA is still enabled on your runescape account.
---
8. Log in using Runescape's official client and set a bank pin.
---
If you follow these steps you should be OK moving forward. Please be aware that some people value twisted bows over friendships, some people will hunt for information regarding common passwords (Whether you have birthdates on social media etc) and be wary of which devices you authorise your account to log into and which game clients you are using.
---
Pretty sure they are monitored just like jmods so they can't take advantage of inside information.
---
How does making them all t75 affect power creep in any way ?
---
Oh, dang, thanks
---
You need money, that's pretty much it.
---
There is no companies that are constantly  upto date with their codebase (Excluding companies that habe products meant to be uptodate like Microsoft, apple and other phone producers). Its important skill to learn and know how to handle old code and how to adapt them to new tech needs.
---
This is totally incorrect and misleading they don't charge script makers for the bot or any scripts, that's not a crime. They charge botting websites with copyright infringement. This usually doesn't work though, so they take down websites for trademark violations through uses of "runescape" or "rs" that could confuse consumers. No clue why you would state information like that like it's a fact.
---
Damage definitely needs to at least scale with magic level...  
---
Maxing 78 at that combat level means you get to 1hKO pretty much everyone at that bracket 😂
---
So be in combat.
---
It would already be widely known at the time of announcement.
---
What's worse in your opinion, knowing something is happening with no indication of a resolution, or not knowing something is happening and being told something is happening and is currently being investigated?
---
One shows being proactive, the other shows incompetence.
---
was there a rollback? if not then its not handled.
---
Until they remove the perk limit which they are pushing for
---
People think you have to be some kind of unbelievably talented nerd with "unbelievable amounts of resources" to pull something like this. It's pretty ridiculous, really. :D
---
A rollback wasn't going to fix the problem.
---
In this case i meant, that powerbot charges (sells) scripts for their bot.
---
Yeah /r/2007scape would have fucking melted down if this happened.
---
.. read the post please
---
Pm me your osrs username. My friends and my goal for twisted is to raid. 
---
I also went accumulator gang!
---
Settled: I'm going to make this the biggest OSRS Thanksgiving of all time!
---
Rendi: Hold my beer
---
Thanks, I've sent some contextual chat log evidence to you.
---
At Runefest they did a mythbusters segment and one of the questions was "were climbing boots an inside job?" and I was so interested to see how they would answer that one. They said "nah, it wasn't, next question" which was hilarious because it was obviously shady.
---
Nice, still wouldn't have wanted my pet rng on zulrah lol
---
Well, i have the set, so any buff im all for. Its just for fashion except for boots imo
---
His point is people might be less forthcoming with information if presenting it means that spreading it anywhere else would by default, be breaching nda, if they ever decided they wanted to share it. 
---
Such as if rendi shared this and Jagex said, meh, too difficult, nobody will know, rendi then sharing this outside the group would be nda breach, even though there's no real nda.
---
Definitely an improvement over what they proposed in the blog
---
Actually they never did. No quite sure how this rumor got started exactly.
---
Diamond response, boss! 😃
---
So you’re saying that rendi was probably just overreacting...? Nah.........
---
yeah, rendi is notorious for wanting credit for things he think he did.
---
can only take them at their word at this point. if they go back on it i can point to this post and say "see lmao", and until then their statement can only be taken as one of intent.
---
Yeah I’ve been seeing a few posts here about the same thing. As long as you don’t click on it you’re good.
---
... ok man, you have not the slightest clue about any of this. Really neat tactic though, maybe I'll try saying something completely irrelevant and then adding "regardless of what you think" in my next inane reddit conversation.   
---
(Why would I disagree with that completely irrelevant statement? I don't. And even if I did disagree, it has NOTHING to do with what we are talking about.)
---
Cheers, bucko! I'm done here.
---
I'm the only one that said what 'extreme assumption'?
---
Yeah thats what i meant haha
---
If you actually watch the video without fanboy glasses you'll actually pick up that he's demonizing jagex for not being transparent enough about the issue, for not letting the community know, for "possibly forcing 2007scape mods to censor threads regarding the dupe", for forcing NDAs that will probably be used to censor content creators without actually knowing what is in the NDA in the first place.
---
But like I said, unpopular opinion.
---
You're all spare parts bud
---
Accurate asf
---
Keeping in mind that the original comment mentions early stages and stepping stones-
---
Because a good career starts with proving that you've mastered fundamentals and have worked in a team with a production environment / release management / release cycles.
---
Companies are definitely going to check if you've had exposure to the technologies they need, but having the prior work experience (even with an in-house scripting language) is super valuable.
---
Anecdotally, people with relevant schooling but no work experience (including internships) are a nightmare to onboard because there's so much more than just coding.
---
No the old email was made maybe 2 years ago and has only been used for runescape. Im really surprised that this has happened.
---
Lol at the conversation
---
Was it the vide /u/michael_rs posted?
---
Do normal players get their SO flew out also? No.
---
&gt;don't even fix the glitch completely.
---
Come on man. I get it's a meme but be realistic. Don't you think maybe jagex might not have a magic button that just instantly solves any issue that might come across..?
---
I enjoy watching him open clues, that's about it lol.
---
Sorry bub, thats how businesses work.
---
And the bug no longer being replicatable in that exact fashion does not mean the core fundamentals to how it worked in the first place are fixed. Just that it cannot be replicated in the exact same way. It may still exist in similar untested methods.
---
Ya think you know better than most, don't ya?
---
&gt;Why would anyone hire a dev that hasn’t touched relevant tech in 3 years over another dev who has experience in C with CUDA, or C++ with concurrency? Jagex doesn’t teach you some secret guru problem solving knowledge, working for them doesn’t give you an edge in algorithmic thinking or optimization. Coupled with the outdated tech - career suicide.
---
Bro you literally asked if being 27 was too old for a cs career and now you’re handing out advice like the woox of programming rofl.
---
Aaaah thanks anyways
---
&gt;If you can't tell me why Jagex can't disable trades 1-2 hours before an update
---
How did you get to this point, while still having absolutely no idea on how the bug even works? The bug is related to server crashing, not to updates. Seriously, you accuse jagex of something, when it is clear you haven't even watched/understood the video
---
Will look into the twitch prime, thanks
---
Literally only 7 people would understand this reference
---
Thank you mod stevew, I support the decision to have me permanently muted. Moving forward, I’ll work on reforming myself and/or not playing the game intoxicated
---
I'm not just talking about monetary gains, of which he could've made a fair amount for someone his age and in his position, but the amount of GP he could've accumulated in-game for his personal use. When I say making out like a bandit, I consider the ability to unfairly gain hundreds of bills as a definition, not necessarily monetary because you're right when it comes to the handling of that amount of GP going across accounts.
---
He completely in the wrong.
---
Except OP is responsible for 4 of those posts. He's double posting everything.
---
Rendi is a dumb as fuck leech that can't even explain other's bugs properly
---
I bring a rake every time I go farming, it's in my farming tab so I take it. Can't remember the last time I've raked outside of twisted league
---
&gt; Gives the Staff a special attack that fires a single spell at the target. This spell requires no runes to use but costs 50% special attack energy. The attack deals up to 65 base damage (which can be increased using damage boosting items) with 50% improved accuracy.
---
I mean, yeah, it says spell, but I read that as the description because it's a magic weapon. I can see where the possible confusion would be, but the wording (imo) makes it seem like it's just a ranged, magic-based special attack.
---
I feel if they intended to make it buff a spell in your spellbook, it would have been stated in the description.
---
...This week on Rendi Wants Credit...
---
Was it a justified mute?
---
I think it was a great shame Rendi decided to make this come across as some sort if great "exposé" piece, when clearly anyone thinking for themselves could see this wasn't some giant conspiracy. Unfortunately everyone here loves conflict and also don't like to think for themselves (if you present something with confidence they'll believe it). Keep up the good work, sorry you have to deal with all this crap. Would be a shame to eventually lose more good Jmods over silly incidents like this making the job not worthwhile.
---
When 110b is all on one account, they can just remove the gold from that account, no need to fuck over literally everyother player.
---
Wonder what he means by this lol. Couldn't have been more vague if he tried. 
---
Does he mean wonky code wise and whats plausible?
---
Conspiracy level theories about jmods that are actually true?
---
Things being exploited right now no one knows about?
---
When does his nda expire? lol or whats his favorite beer? someone get him drunk and talking!
---
I agree. If some random-no-name person with a bot farm did it, they could probably get away with at least keeping and selling a few billions. But a content creator literally famous for bug abusing and in the content creator discord? Even if he wanted to, he probably couldn't get away with it.
---
Yes it was
---
Nowhere in their comment did they mention playing twisted league. Just voicing their opinion that it sucks because it’s going to be removed at end of season unlike on the main game.
---
Everything I gathered from this whole thing is that some of these elitist players are assholes, some of the mods are assholes and this could have been avoided. How have they not developed a tool to track gold traffic between accounts?
---
I'm just saying, Sween has the right attitude about it.  Right now he's on damage control and so far, he's doing a decent job.  The absolute WORST thing he could do would be to demonize the community and hold them to a higher standard than what they've currently shown.  People are going to act this way whether we like it or not, the best way to deal with it is to accept it and try to forge some communication with the more reasonable people.  And that's working, look at how his comments are rising to the top for us all to be able to see.  He's being respectful and understanding about it.  I won't say my personal opinion on jagex or how I feel they're handling their own game, but I will say that Sween is doing a good job in communicating here.  He's viewed as one of the bad guys in the situation, he's accepting that, and he's working to change that opinion.  It won't happen immediately no matter what he says, but he's making the right steps.
---
Either way though, 0 days since last fuck up again.  I'm just impressed that I'm seeing the situation get defused pretty well for once.
---
You are livin the dream my dude
---
It’s being downvoted because people with no experience in game dev or computer science was to believe that working at jagex is some once in a lifetime opportunity instead of a giant shit smear across your resume. No game dev or software dev with ambitions for future prospects would touch Jagex with a 10 foot pole with a badger attached at the end for extra protection.
---
i literally went up to the other side of the story and asked for them to show proof of their side.
---
So close to the end of November and this happens. So close.
---
Go pking on your HCIM instead. What better way is there to lose a HC than pking? Be a chad.
---
do you have a precedent for this?
---
Sounds like the average successful youtuber to me
---
How hard would it be to completely break the game down and recode it for PC so it runs better and doesn’t have game breaking bugs?
---
Didn’t PUBG do something like this?
---
Claiming that he saved the economy is a bit of an overstatement. He did however bring to our attention that the Jagex moderators would rather stay silent on such an issue rather than telling us what happened.

They saw people weren't able to log into their accounts - they didn't know anything about how that's related to any exploits, but decided that people don't get to know why the game is fucked because blanket kneejerk censorship is apparently a natural reaction.  And that censorship would have remained indefinitely if not for Rendi.  
---
  
---
Rendi made the situation better, twice.  They just created more problems that Rendi had to solve.  Seems pretty clear why I'm happy with one of the two more than the other rn.
---
Yes, and since then I have finished my masters, begun a PhD and completed several Co-Ops with software companies ranging from business management software to software architecture consulting. 
---
What’s your point?
---
Most likely a virtual machine
---
Not nice
---
Noob
---
Gloff to me 
---
Or am i retarded
---
that depends, the NDA can have a part where it says no content creator can discuss bugs or exploits that sign that NDA.
---
You get preset stats in LMS to give all players an equal and fair playing field to pvp on.
---
This bug is not recent if you look online. People have talked about using rollbacks/crashes for duping 
---
It honestly seems like Rendi is just trying to grow his channel from an issue jagex has known about but ignored for a while now
---
https://youtu.be/XF5oS5sMzU8
---
It was more than just 110b, it affected players that weren't even involved.
---
I miss these memes
---
Are you talking about them trying to fix the coin pouch issue or the duping issue? Because that applies to both of them haha?
---
&gt;No one would have found out if rendi didn't post it in the content creator discord either
---
Everyone had already known, which is why Rendi knew.  Hell, even I knew and I'm not on any of these platforms. 
---
\&gt; Botters, gold traders, and exploiters aren't going to share this lol they'd keep it to themselves. 
---
They'd share it with other exploiters, yes.  That's exactly what happened.
---
\&gt; but both made want they thought was the best decision at the time 
---
Which is meaningless when in the end they did a bad.
---
\&gt; I think(rather I know, rather it's a common and agreed upon practice among many businesses) that information regarding a bug should be suppressed until it is completely resolved to prevent further abuse. 
---
I thought we were pretending that the subreddit mods are a separate entity from Jagex?  Or are they a business now?  You seem to have done a bit of a freudian there.
---
Castle and clan wars are PvP but you still use your actual combat stats
---
I imagine this has been abused countless times, but has only come into the limelight recently.
---
Why not cater to both? OSRS is a game that encourages avoiding people because that's how combat and fight for resources work. Plus, it is better to do raids 1 alone rather than with a team since you might.. get scammed.. Why is it an MMO again? You get punished in most activities for playing with others with a few exceptions that someone will respond to with, and it's almost as if they call it an MMO just to get hundreds of dollars in a span of 2+ years. Of course, to fix those issues they would have to remake most of the game which is unnecessary, so in the end they should strive to make it more enjoyable for both sides.

He didnt get shadowbanned on rs. This subreddit has words that are autodeleted and one of them is T) u p 3
---
It's not an experience, it's a built-in flaw to the question that I've then explained. It doesn't require a super specific way of voting for it to be true. 
---
This is you:
---
&gt;I do not think it's safe to assume that there was an inherit problem in how the options were setup.
---
So yes it is safe to "assume" there's a problem in how the questions were set up, because there's no need for an assumption, there was. I don't know why you'd continue arguing your point when you've only demonstrated that there *is* a problem.
---
Lol rofl omgcopter fuck off.
---
Way rarer than 1/10k. Your example probably never has and never will happen.
---
But people don't think like that. If they did they'd be in a constant state of reacting to slight variations in the volume of their breaths or the exact position of their foot on the floor as they walk.
---
Lol. Fuck you.
---
Those are for fun, they prepared lms in a more "esports" like fashion, as it is extremely competitive.
---
lmao you watched a video on the topic and you think you know "anything about anything", swayed by the dramatic music and ready to die on the hill. Rendi's video was mostly good, but try and stay just a bit critical, even of the people you like. You sound really extreme
---
ps critical does is not a bad thing that inherently has negative connotations
---
You forgot a couple letters
---
What in the name of Guthix is this?!
---
a) Rendi knew about an issue
---
b) Rendi informed Jagex about an issue
---
c) Exploiters successfully abused the issue to cause a shitfest for Jagex, so Jagex clearly weren't prepared to deal with the issue
---
d) Jagex try to suppress the known issue for some reason so they could keep ignoring it I guess
---
e) Rendi whistleblows.
---
This could be alternate timeline quest just like in *scoffs* RS3
---
As I already stated - I like it perfectly fine in his videos ment for entertainment, but it was clear this video wasn't really about his own accomplishments, so the entire thing was grating, obnoxious and unwarranted in my opinion. It doesn't matter if he's "a content creator, not a journalist" - he chose to report on something that's usually out of his scope, so one could assume he wouldn't be applying his standard formula to it; A lot of content creators have a decent "range" of things they're able to do well, while others are just one-tricks. Rendi is apparantly a one trick, and it made *this video specifically* annoying to watch to me.
---
Understand that I'm:
---
- Not saying I dislike his content in general. I'm as hyped as anyone to see him do stupid BS on a low level account.
---
- Not saying he shouldn't be making a video like this.
---
I'm saying doing it with the same formula as his entertainment videos when it's blatantly not just didn't work for me.
---
Legit this, all the comments I'm seeing are abuse toward Rendi like he did something wrong by informing the community? How dare he tell us about the shady shit that's going on...
---
With that much supply there is no way you can assume demand would stay the same. I’m curious if any good sites share how much they sell.
---
Q: Can lockpicks be added to a store in Twisted league? 
---
Due to the level of competition (sometimes 10-15 people on a single world at a single impling spawn) and the rate of provision (1 imp every 2-3 min, 1/6 chance of being a young imp, and 1/10 chance of a lockpick : total 1 lockpick per spot per world per \~3 hours) it is unreasonably hard to obtain a lockpick for the hard diary and tasks. I have met players who are 10-15 hours in trying to get an item is required for an easy task.
---
An alternative could be to auto complete the hard diary task for everyone and move artifact collection to a higher tier in the book.
---
"Got any tips for me?"
---
Holy shit
---
The heron pet is 1/5k from fishing trawler...
---
That's fish caught though not games played. Bloodhound and penance pet still take the longest.
---
Aaah lmao, cant believe all of that happend in one moth. Seems also forever when all of that happend...
---
Probably won’t for much longer lmao
---
This has to be bait, please tell me you aren’t serious about the servers.
---
yep
---
Actually looks like Fred Flintstones top.
---
It's the old rpg gauntlet. :)
---
Except Jagex mods don’t run the Reddit sub and have been pretty good at answering questions people have left on posts about it
---
Naahhh im sure there are gonna be better contenders
---
Just no. There are multiple buyers who accept 50b gp at a time or more if u go cheaper. 5b in 2013 woulda been like u described.
---
A J-Mod said in the main thread that an NDA only acts to stop content creators from sharing content initially found by someone else, or from sharing information Jagex gives them.
---
Anything a content creator finds of their own volition is 100% fair game, which this would fall under.
---
Had Jagex informed this guy of the exploit and then he had gone on to make a video about it after learning about it only from Jagex then it would have violated an NDA
---
You’re so salty the community is better off without your toxicity
---
Jagex introduces new quest. Quest rewards include unlocking access to a dungeon with new monsters (Basilisk Knights). The quest is a Master difficulty quest, with a fairly easy boss fight. Skill requirements are about 60 Slayer and 55 Runecrafting. 
---
Basilisk Knights have an okay drop table for the slayer level/combat level they had. Basilisk Knights ALSO have a chance to drop an item that's used to upgrade the Neitz helm into the new best-in-slot melee helm. 
---
On release, Basilisk Knights are basically just kinda-beefy Basilisks. Pretty AFK, just need a Mirror Shield or its improved version that was added with the quest. It's also now possible to unlock Basilisks as a slayer task from Nieve, Duradel, and Konar. You can also extend the task if you wish. 
---
Some members of the community complained that a best-in-slot item shouldn't come from such an easy monster. Some Twitch streamer gets one early at a very low KC and makes a long, ranty video about... easyscape or something. (I didn't watch it)
---
Jagex buffs the SHIT out of the Basilisk Knights. Their Defense and HP goes through the roof so they're a pretty slow kill. The Superior version of it is especially bad. Video surfaces of maxed account + near-max gear taking upwards of 2:30 to kill it. Now the Knights are a money-losing task because they don't drop enough to pay for the supplies/time you need.
---
Community infighting ensues. People in favor of buffing the knights argue that a helmet that good shouldn't be so easy; they say it devalues the Serpentine helm; ~~they say that the game is going to shit and easyscape reigns supreme.~~ The people against the nerf point out that the Knights are now basically untouchable by people just finishing the Master quest; that the Neitz helm has *always* been quite good and easily obtained; and that melee helms aren't even used much given how Slayer Helm/Black Mask are way more common anyway (with the Mask coming from an easy monster). 
---
Community remained split until the next big drama came up, but general opinion is that Knights went from a fun/profitable task to "not really worth doing". Jagex has not reverted the buff. Jagex maintains that yeah, this is too easy of a way to get BIS melee helm.
---
Fucking bullshit man cant even get acknowledged.
---
I mean you're commenting on the subject matter covered by the video and do not know basic facts regarding the subject matter that both Jagex and the video agree upon.  So you in fact do not know anything about anything, which is what I'm asserting.  My knowledge on this matter isn't on trial today, your ignorance is.
---
You're ready to die upon the hill of knowing nothing, you sound really extreme.  
---
Being critical requires critical thinking - and idk if you're even capable of standard generic brand thinking.
---
Fucking bump
---
If you were not part of the dupe, why *wouldn't* you have cash?
---
People just mad they couldnt abuse the dupe themselves.
---
I kinda never paid attention to it. What happened?
---
Feelsperma
---
You're not going to get P Mod for this post bro
---
Right back atcha!
---
It was just done in f2p so if ur panic selling 3a rings then go ahead.
---
As if throwaway accounts aren't a thing.
---
Umm, I have a genuine complaint about being wrongfully banned and everyone is shitting on me, so when I respond I'm salty?  Makes total sense buddy.
---
Except the content creators talking about it brought the most attention to it..
---
No... If you find a bug like this you don't share it... That makes it more noticeable and diminishes your profits... You keep it within the circle of people who discovered it
---
Both didn't make the perfect decision but neither made a bad decision
---
Not really calling them a business but OK. Just stating the fact that it's a common practice among businesses, subredits, and other gaming forums to suppress information about bugs until they are resolved. Thought you'd understand at least that.
---
LMS needs a restriction on it to stop the suicide botting issues that appear with the Twitch Prime free membership promotion. Perhaps 100 hours time played + 500 total skill level is enough of a restriction to lessen the amount of botting people can do there.
---
At this point botters are already utilizing pretty impressive PvP bot scripts where they actually stand a chance to win against noob players.
---
Part of the reason I enjoy osrs is content not being blocked behind forced group play.
---
(Fuck you barbarian assault)
---
Group content is great but not when it’s mandatory. If I wanted mandatory group PVM I would go play any other mmo
---
New boss has not been confirmed to be team oriented, since it most likely scales based on amount of people in the area.
---
Clan system sure, but they never revealed if it actual has some content on it except just another clan chat. IT would need citadel, missions, capes and other community driven content to actually encourage multiplayer.
---
Group ironman is just another try at taking people's subfee with minimal effort since still only 1 character/account allowed.
---
Other then the tbow glitch there doing good this year compared to last year. If I remember correctly I think every month had some sort of jagex drama
---
Even though it’s Trump that’s says that wtf?
---
The lack of a lootsharing system is kind of a hindrance regarding regular bossing. Also we'll be getting a proper clan system sooner than later, which will help some.
---
Yeah, I think that was a fine comment. OP was trying to justify his actions by saying others have do it all the time too, and those people deserve to get muted as well, and one day when they get caught they most likely will too.
---
we got money like that jagex ain’t getting a dime from me lmfao
---
They never said it is near impossible to solo. I need to see source on that or hear about it on today's Q&amp;A.
---
What *exact* purpose does an NDA serve other than to censor content creators? 
---
This reeks of so much corporate bullshit Sween. Come on, dont revert to 2008 Jagex. Youre better than this.
---
titfucker
---
Not sure why there's such a need to have this "Jagex vs playerbase" narrative, it's so unhealthy. Jagex sets the GOLD STANDARD for communication within the gaming world, and yet get treated like garbage whenever there's even a whiff of a misunderstanding, miscommunication. Grow up and go watch some shitty TV programmes if you want drama, stop ruining the game by pushing the Jmods away.
---
100% agreed. If they made a requirement similar to what they did with BH (if i recall they have a total level requirment now) it would help a shit ton.
---
Because seers rings (I) and ahrims pieces have value. If you repair ahrims/let it break completely it can be sold for GP. If you unimbue the seers ring it can also be traded for GP.
---
If you dismantle the avernic defender all you get is a dragon defender since the hilt breaks. Therefore, the defender technically has no value as no parts of it can be sold anymore. Magic cape isn’t tradable at all so it has no value.
---
That’s why he kept those two items. Cause the items themselves can be “broken bown” into tradable items while the other two cannot.
---
You're a Jagex shill defending shitty policies by attacking complainers. Good for you.
---
Wasting hundreds of hours and dollars is precisely what I intend to do here
---
You don’t just “wait until the world crashed,” you have to actively crash the world, ie you need the resources
---
Big time over-stepping to say he saved the whole game lol
---
I'm hyperbolizing above but I've seen plenty of people react in such ways to arbitrarily rare drops. Double wrath talismans from Vorkath, rdt+pet from a boss, etc. Every drop combination is 1/*big number* when the monster has *bigger number* of possible drop combinations.
---
Seems like tourettes or a nervous tick to me.
---
Seems you need to grow up tbh
---
2 By Release and 1 Swamp Man upload in the same week, are we sure its not Christmas instead of Thanksgiving??
---
Use the opportunity and go kill some demonics. It's one of the best money makers atm
---
Work in the business (not game dev but dev) and you can know about lots of broken things, but even a smaller broken thing gets done a lot faster if there's incentive. Incentive meaning people higher up saying so. And the easiest way for that to happen is something being made public. It's not miracles, just how the world works.
---
I'm glad someone else see's the potential :) From a fresh start it would take forever for anyone to comp cape!
---
Thats not what im saying at all. A real fact can never be disputed. Thats right. A fact: runescape is an online game. But many 'facts' about the intend behind the runescapes team's actions are mostly assumptions based on interpreted texts by a few individuals. Not a fact either but god do i feel it: you treat anyone who disagrees with you like an idiot.
---
You don't usually pay volunteers.
---
Is that using humidify lunar spell?
---
Sounds like you have no clue what you're talking about either
---
Dude youre trying to belittle someone for using 3PCs. How sad of a person are you? What a joke.
---
I actually had someone call me a totalitarian because I didn't think this knowledge should be public until it's completely fixed. I don't get why people are so obsessed with spreading a game breaking bug, for the game they're playing. It's like they want the economy to get fucked.
---
It's actually beyond fucked that Rendi released his video when Jagex only had a bandaid out and not a concrete fix. Staff at Jagex are going to have to be more vigilant and likely live a significantly more stressful on-call rotation and work long hours as people try to use the information he revealed to produce dupes.
---
Big dupedeedupe of a one hundred and ten billion coins by crashing the servers.
---
Sort of sums up the internet nowadays doesnt it :)
---
Or accept they have a system their fanbase enjoys? Nothing NEEDS to be fixed with the current system.
---
Thats not a good thing because melee weapon specs allow you to damage your opponent 1 tick sooner than with range or mage. Its why AGS, Claws, etc are so good.
---
In pvp timing&gt; damage 
---
Of course you still generally need a large hit, but your more likely to K0 someone with a 30 than you are a 60 if they dont have a chance to react or eat.
---
Try 55x max cash
---
[deleted]
---
And he put out the video before knowing the bug was fixed, potentially making the problem worse.
---
"Saved the game"... "Wanted to be an attention whore"... Same difference apparently.
---
Rope and chair is bis
---
NDA is a legally binding contract. If the person who signed a NDA breaks the contract, you can pursue damages. So instead of being censorial children, put your money where your mouth is and pursue legal action.
---
Waiting for the first company that is ddos proof.
---
(It won't ever happen)
---
Sorry your parents raised you to be a special snowflake :D
---
READ THE CHAT. ITS A PERFECT CHAT.
---
He couldn’t stream because had he gotten the rcbow on stream it would have spoiled the video and big reveal for when it did happen, same reason he kept catching lucky imps afterwards. Now that the surprise drops and RNG portion of the grind is over and it’s just skilling for exp and banking smithing exp he could totally start streaming that again.
---
Man. rendis dick is so far down your throat lol.
---
This has been in the game for months, and has been abused for months.
---
Idk man, but I'm giving thanks!
---
You thnk they'll ignore an actively-being-used bug that crashes entire servers and ruins the economy, just because it isn't made public to everyone else? Really?
---
Damn, sorry to hear about your mum being perma muted. Can't imagine how hard that is for the family.
---
The mods answer to Jagex at the end of the day.
---
Money Dupe glitch was found out, Rendi made a video outing Jagex’s willingness to keep it on the DL, and they claim it’s crashing (or was going to crash) the economy. 
---
Sicknerd said there was a 110B GP dupe, although I’m not sure where he got that number.
---
What were the bots going to sell to crash the economy?
---
You can mine it without taking any damage by luring a spider. It's pretty chill that way.
---
It was $1 because the population kept increasing to support demand. Now osrs is stagnate at best and the more you play rs, the more gp u have to sell. Even without the dupes, gp would drop.
---
This statement is completely unfounded. 
---
If you’re trespassing, the circumstances don’t matter. You did or you didn’t, and you are in this case. A jury won’t even get a say because you’ll be charged before you even sat before a jury, and if you dared to, you’d just owe more money in the end, in addition to a harsher sentence. 
---
DA does not care to save resources. You’ll get your day in court if you want it.. it just may not be for close to a year.
---
He’s full of shit, like his latest video
---
\&gt; Thats not what im saying at all. A real fact can never be disputed. Thats right. A fact: runescape is an online game. 
---
An example of a real fact like that is that this bug is not dangerous anymore and discussion of it is not harmful.  Something Rendi said and Jagex did not dispute.  There is no controversy surrounding this notion, it is a fact.  Thus, " Because a dangerous bug is now outed to the playerbase? And bot farms are probably going to start ddosing the servers and inflating gold values? " is not a factual statement, and I do not need to argue it, since there is no angle at which it becomes true.
---
Christ, this took a while.
---
\&gt; Not a fact either but god do i feel it: you treat anyone who disagrees with you like an idiot. 
---
Something tells me you feel that fact about a lot of people who you argue with.  I wonder why that is......
---
Thanks. That's what I said. He was a member of the group that discovered it.
---
Sorry you didn't have parents to teach you morals and respect
---
I'm literally losing brain cells reading these replies. Jesus fucking christ, lmao.
---
If any content creator were to immediately make a video exposing this exploit while it was still conventionally possible, it would be disastrous for the community and game economy. Of course from a business perspective Jagex is going to try to limit the spread of knowledge with any tools they have. Since content creators are the most dangerous in this circumstance, you block them with an NDA until the issue is resolved. It's common practice and makes total sense.
---
If a big name creator came out and made a video detailing the bug and promoted it to someone who took advantage and crashed the market, that's okay? You would really trade that for no NDAs?
---
This isn't the same as censorship of negative opinion. It is censorship, but for the integrity of the game. You can't compare the two. Jagex acted totally fine in *this* instance. I'm not defending anything else.
---
No. Hes right. It crashed from 50 to 10 cents and then never went above 20.
---
Happy to see bludegon killed.  Its the UGLIEST most unfitting item in the game and should straight up be deleted and a new model made
---
It's different with the .G.E method because it doesn't even required you to know when a rollback or crash si going to happen. You can just prep the account, never log in, and then *whenever* a rollback occurs, you'll benefit.
---
“I’m sure you’ve all learned from your mistakes with Jed &amp; ROT”
---
Probably not
---
The other day I got called and c*** and told to kill myself because I didn't go up a ladder while killing a Sara wizard. It had like 20hp left and the guy didn't even wait 1 sec for me to see his chat.
---
I also had a guy in catacombs shooting a single arrow at every monster I fought so I didn't get any loot (he was trying to make me hop) he was also trash talking me and my account etc. (I just waited until he got bored and hopped)
---
I could go on...
---
Nothing NEEDS to be fixed? So everyone is happy with mediocre difficulty content that you know if u feel like putting some effort in, you can solo for better reward than bringing your friend with you?
---
Sure I enjoy content, I just dont want everything new to be same old with same difficulty. People get better, content should become harder.
---
One of my favourite ps1 games
---
Well the fact that eoc happened like a few months later and rs lost half its playerbase. Plus the playerbase knew the game was dying on that day so everyone wanted to sell and no one wanted to buy.
---
Literally have not watched a rendi video before today, just like it when people do their part for transparency and I like it when censors lose.
---
Not everyone loves chugging dicks as much as you love chugging Jagex's stale baguette.  Say, how's that taste?  Not exactly the taste of justice but Ill still add it to my spreadsheet.
---
Thats the joke my guy.
---
The idea to draw this must of came about, while doing pest control and watching King of the Hill
---
Seethe
---
90 mill avernic hilt and still go afk while skulled above lvl 20 wild?
---
Smells fishy.. gold buyer?
---
Jokes aside
---
Imbued rings are kept when you die to a monster. 
---
Above 20 wildy you lose the cape and the defender. 
---
And the ahrims must because protect item was on?
---
Seems a legit loss.. gl with a new one
---
An exploit that had the potential to double the amount of money in the game. It was done by using the game's 15min rollback state in the event that a server crashes. 
---
In simple terms. Trade money from one account to another, force a server crash by flooding requests to the server (this was done by using a lot of accounts operated by one user). When the server recovers, both accounts have the max cash stack.
---
I believe Rendi did that right thing. Rendi being the one to come forward deserved to get some sort of information from Jagex. This as far as been communicated by Rendi, was little to none. That was wrong.
---
I believe if Rendi received information from Jagex concerning the matter her reported the video wouldnt have happened.
---
But this is just a belief.
---
As for his motives. He is a content creator. He lives to receive fame from the community. He used that information to his advantage and Presented that information in a very matter of fact way. I dont see anything he did wrong. I already a fan of Rendi videos do not view him more or less because of this video. He is just Rendi a creator of content that i enjoy
---
The group did not discover the glitch.  The group was not in charge of discovering the glitch.  The group was a group discussing exploits.  2 people in the group found an exploit and chose to divulge it despite not having to, since no one else in the group discovered it or played any part in it.
---
Litterally patrick's wallet up in here.
---
Wonder what their KC was for drop
---
we're starting early today, huh
---
Someone telling you to not be a dick doesn’t make them a special snowflake lol
---
Ofc you dont have any of the untradables lmao. Not roasting you for buying bonds, it helpa keep the game healthy, but get your damn barrows gloves and imhue that ring
---
Hi Rendi,
---
Thanks for your service to the community. You've done a great thing for us. While I do not agree 100% with how this was handled, I cannot for a second understate how important I believe your contributions to be in this situation. Thank you. 
---
I'm going to take Sween's word over yours when Jagex is determining if this is an active situation. I think it's very fair of Jagex if they say that they're not 100% certain of their fix. While the crashes alone are what made the duping possible in this scenario, I don't think it's outrageous of Jagex to want to fix the save state issue as well. It took the actions of the dupers and the critical information that you provided to prove that the save state was a possible game breaker, but that cat is now out of the bag. Even though you identified that bug years ago, the severity of it wasn't apparent until now and I think it's a good thing if they want to fix it as well. Was it a mistake to leave the save state issue in the game for two years until this happened? Sure. But patching it now is still the correct course of action and that means that this is still an active situation.
---
Actually since basically forever. No one knew how to exploit it because it seemed to happen randomly. It wasnt until ice poseidon did it 3-4 times back to back that people really thought about doing it and that wad 1.5 years ago.
---
[Big Gulps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=praFGD51ih8)
---
Yeah and neither can Russians or suadis amirite? Lol
---
Can someone jagexuplicate me a T Bow real quick?
---
Also when everyone’s like “trust the Jmods” I’m like oh yeah like the time Jed stole people’s accounts for years...
---
I can't wait for Thurgo "Will" Smith to host it.
---
Jmods did reply on the thread at least, subreddit censoring was the sub mods' decision and not jagex enforced
---
Dude has had the same amount of birthdays as gold that was glitched into the economy.
---
Bring me your Zuk, LilZik, and Puppadile pets. Man, just shut the fuck up. You're not changing shit, your arguments are not well crafted, and you're not winning anyone over by whining. There is a point to be made about directing the game more into small-team mode, but you're not making it
---
I don’t even really know what the fuck is going on but it’s clear you’re going “he said this so it’s true” as others have said, theres always two sides. Also grow the fuck up lol. Every single one of your replies is you trying to insult someone. If you can’t take criticism, don’t post controversy.
---
Man, did Rendi pay you to make this post?
---
Interdasting, is this an old exploit? Seems like something that'd come out of experimentation with private servers.
---
Im going to upvote cause you took a lot of brainpower and time to invest in to this.
---
That’s what I was thinking too 
---
Why do random bosses need to drop 5 uniques? Even raids shouldn’t do that but they jumped the gun so can’t go back anymore 
---
This boss should drop a defensively buffed version of the armor with maybe a slight accuracy set effect like justiciar’s defense effect (3 pieces) plus a nerfed version of the weapon or something 
---
No more is needed. Even if these rewards come elsewhere make them more spread out so power creep is slow
---
Read Sweens response in the other thread, not only was Rendi disingenuous about the commutation between himself and the Jmods but sensationalized the entire ordeal (for a reason i can’t seem to place? Outrage = engagement? I have no idea). Jagex treated the entire incident by the book exactly how they have to for active investigations.
---
Rendi is parading around portraying himself as sort of martyr and “whistleblower” for a conspiracy that doesn’t even exist. Did he save the OSRS economy by telling jmods about the exploit? Maybe? And that’s great but like do you want a pat on the back for not exploiting it yourself? Like okay dude cool you probably prevented a rollback if anything they were never going to get away with duping 1000b in game quietly. 
---
It’s incredibly irresponsible to use his platform in this way to rally the troops when it comes to this already rabid toxic community of frothing at the mouth children who want just one strand of an excuse to pile on Jagex and jmods for the 100th time this year, grasping at anything that reinforces their already skewed perspective on what “censorship” means. It’s fucking disgusting, fuck that dude.
---
God you make me sad. Dw ill stop trying telling you to respect other people. Clearly you dont care and think thats just fine. Didnt adress anything besides the least important things again. Hopeless.
---
Yeah...you mad
---
I actually had it with me lmao, my dumb ass ran out there with it in my inventory, not realizing you couldn't equip both a shield and a spear.
---
is rendi the guy that cried for not getting an award?
---
I didn't even think of this aspect, truly beautiful.
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
I stand corrected.
---
Yes that was about the GE dupe, I thought this dupe(Which is known to me since 1st of May 2018 is to grave to share on YT).
---
I asked ash about a possibility for this dupe on twitter back then and he just said its possible yes.
---
How recent? I changed my name after I got muted so I don’t think that’s plausible
---
But the general store made me
---
Never said he wanted to dupe, just that he helped theorize the process. His intentions were different but he was a part of it nonetheless.
---
Silly boi
---
It definately is not...  But it's not hard with the BiS Gear ;)
---
Hey man, if you're a fan of your mum's thicc ass then each to their own. Does that make you part bloodveld then?
---
scavengers in raids will drop :/ easyscape dressed as qol.
---
Except alch values lmao
---
I don't mod /r/2007scape any more, but when I did, the policy was very consistent in removing anything that provided information on cheats, rwt, or anything that broke TOS.
---
I do mod /r/eve and /r/classicwow, and both subs have similar policies. Basically any and every gaming sub has a standard of not propagating dupes/cheats/etc as they occur.
---
Of course there are situations where some issues become so large it's impossible for people not to know, at which point these threads may as well be public. When that time comes however is very difficult to judge.
---
All of the above said, I have been informed that since leaving on some occasions Jagex have asked for certain threads to be reviewed/removed. I believe this was during the period when a certain Jmod was hacking accounts and personally have no belief that in this instance, Reddit mods were just following a standard procedure.
---
Which one? The one on the left is a helmet you can paint in your PoH based on your house's symbol. The one on the right is a clue reward.
---
I forgot about this, I love these.
---
I use awesome to describe things that inspire awe
---
Yeah that was such an epic fuck-up.
---
I 100% agree with you and it is one of the reasons why people asking for “Jmod smackdowns” annoy me.  However that was one guy, the entire dev team are not in some conspiracy to wreck the economy or silence the community. They were just trying to protect the integrity of the game while the bug was still active.
---
That song was fuckin something else well done.
---
Quest man good
---
The truth is if Rendi wants to back up his story more and prove the Jmods wrong and that they are lying about response times he 100% needs to release the chat logs.  He knows he fucked up once again, he isn't reading anything the Jmods have said on reddit. I enjoyed his video but for all we know Jagex was prepping a statement to be released you don't take about a game breaking bug like this before you 100% have it fixed.
---
Why the fuck would he whistleblow it if he was making money off it?
---
Did you not see the videos from the massive dupe with Ratcatchers? People in those circles make a living from selling RS gold they buy pre-created accounts or use their own scripts to automate making them then rent servers to run botfarms from.
---
When a dupe is discovered people go ham abusing it for as long as they can before gold sellers catch on and lower their buying prices.
---
Where's Rsbool he/she is normally knocking around in these dupe/glitch threads lol.
---
i didn’t do it on purpose i promise. HELLO!!
---
This is even worse, they identified the Tbow bug very quickly and rolled it back. This has been ongoing for months/years.
---
Oh I thought he meant Jad lmao
---
Yeah, Java itself is not the worst thing (I know some basics and such), but dealing with +12 years old game code can be interesting experience.
---
Hoeft t niet te vragen als je t al zo goed weet toch? 🐴🐴

Stop saying dumb shit itll make everyone life better
---
It doesn't split the community I don't know where people get that idea.. my old cc/community from 2009 still going, with people on RS3, OSRS, Iron mans, HCIM, Ultimate IM's and regular acc, over both games.
---
counterpoint: attempts on the live game devalue my bank
---
Some people have hundreds of bils, imagine what would happen if they lost that. Thousands of hours grinding that money suddenly gone.
---
Like you cant be this dumb for real, u think the world has 0 players then someone uses exactly 2000 bots and no1 else can log in? Stop taking things too seriously, people log in and off from the world and ur just spam logging in...
---
I don't think the battle is quite over yet on the Jagex side judging by this comment   
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e2bmu0/you_thought_it_was_just_a_lag/f8v213c/  
---
Also just out of curiosity, how does Jagex telling us their side of the story hold any benefit? It doesn't change what has happened just sates the curiosity of the public by this point doesn't it?
---
Holy fuck that's crazy and chaotic, and it feels like so much of the other situations that have happened over the years. Something is too weak/strong, they change it too much in the other direction and then more fighting ensues.
---
What exactly does a full set even do? Or is it purely cosmetic?
---
I mean that’s low key sad honestly. Like I feel you have to be extremely mentally unstable to spend all your money on a presidential candidate. But especially Sanders.
---
Runescript itself is not necessarily the worst thing. Jmods said that it was createad to speed up content creation and it does that. In other hand it limits what they can do.
---
twisted league is two months
---
The least important things to you are literally what I was always talking about.  I'm sorry I don't feel like talking about whatever you think is important where it literally has no bearing on what I think is important?
---
You really don't understand this whole respect thing.  Respect in an argument goes both ways - if you're not arguing in good faith or haven't even familiarized yourself with the topic, you're not being respectful by demanding I argue with you.  And I am under no obligation to be respectful back.  Whenever I argue with someone, my respect of them is fairly consistent with their respect of me.
---
Naw they need 2 add a pj timer to singles to revive it. The people against it are  clanning in singles on solo players. I dont know how jagex sees a 5 man+ fall in singles and think hey this is fine. They did make it so theres a cooldown speccing but whats the point if its only 10 seconds.
---
Isn't it still active which is why they aren't talking about it more?
---
U illiterate little shit. Go back to meme school before you post more. You ruined my fucking thanksgiving

You basically can by drop trading cash to a main, buying the bond, using on the iron. It's semantics but basically irons can buy bonds with their own gp

yeah

Probably using gpu and animation smoothing plugin on runelite
---
They gave a whole spiel right before that announcement about how they've already been addressing bottlenecks and this fix should be fine. Unless you mean how it might affect main game. Vod link for anyone, where he starts talking about how it's basically a 1/5 or 1/6 to spawn the right imp, then a 1/10 get the right item, and the limited spawn points that are heavily camped. This one's more chemoscape than easyscape imo.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/514021289?t=00h39m14s
---
It's not a close call when paying customers were already affected. There were how many world crashes? How many players prevented from logging in at all?
---
What am I looking at?
---
This sounds really good.
---
Player A trades money to Player B, they crash the server but Player B does something to stay logged in and get his account "saved". Player A gets rolled back 15 minutes due to the crash and now Player A and player B have the same amount of money that was in Player As inventory before the crash.
---
Yep, same way the noobs of this game who grinded for hours to make a measly 10m would lose half of their hard work. 
---
Once again - not agreeing with the suggestion, just highlighting the above mistake that this would be a progressive tax. 
---
I completely get where you are coming from. I understand your point 100%.
---
he threatened with NDA in that post.
---
NDA is legaly binding contract that can result in a massive fine in court
---
Imagine being that giy thinking that your opinion is shared by everyone else and complaining about endgame when you have the stats of a 6mo old account. Yikes
---
No. If you have 100 coins, how long does it take to make 50 coins back? 10 seconds. 
---
If you have 4b, how long does it take to get 2b back? Thousands of hours (unless lucky at raids or sand casino). 
---
It doesn’t work the way you think lol
---
it's a pretty typical relationship nowadays between game companies and content creators. it allows CCs to gain access to unreleased information early on so they can prepare videos and such ahead of time to release alongside a new patch/content update/announcement. they will typically be under NDA to prevent leaking information on these future updates.
---
CCs don't have to follow the rules/NDA, but that just means they don't get the same access to unreleased stuff, which might make their job harder/less rewarding if they make those content update discussion videos or similar. 
---
i'm just assuming based on my experience in the games industry and what they're saying above though
---
This copypasta is years old bro, get mad
---
Oh I see. Didn’t think about that. I guess they didn’t want to make it a Ironman only feature as well.
---
Plenty of mmorpgs do not allow player useful exploits upon crash sir.
---
Very cool no one gives a shit

😭
---
A stereotype for bug abusing gold farmers?
---
Nope I like doing capes, they're fun. If someone doesn't like doing them and buys one it doesn't effect me at all, I don't understand getting upset about that. Someone buying capes doesn't diminish anything except their own personal sense of accomplishment.
---
Playing for efficiency, ewwwww
---
I don’t really care about xp waste on the main game either but it’s more just, if I’m going to spend 10 hours at wintertodt I’d rather do that 10 hours of wintertodt on my main that’s only 77 fm and actually keep that progress.
---
I’m sure if I was 2100 total and burnt from half the skills I’d be way more down for TL but there’s still so much easy progress I could make on my main.
---
do you even pk m8... you can hit over 100 damage in 1 tick. There is no safing anymore, unless you're playing at the lowest pure brackets where this is not a concern.
---
^(tithe farm isn't even bad)
---
Side 1: "We're not going to talk about this yet"
---
Side 2: "Here's very selective quotes, where I mistate what what said LITERALLY IN THE THING YOU'RE READING"
---
Bystanders: "Side 1, you've been accused of things that are obvious bullshit, defend yourself!"
---
---------------------------
---
Seriously, here's the exact quote from the text he linked: "we can't trust that things said in this channel are confidencial, we'll have to move all feedback to private channels until we get everyone NDA'd"
---
Rendi: "tell everyone in the discord that they'd somehow soon be NDAd". That's literally not what Bolton said. Bolton said they can't discuss things with people who aren't NDAd, and Rendi bullshitted that into somehow that they were being **forced** into an NDA. That's bullshit.
---
Mod Bolton deserves to be treated with respect, but considering the way people on reddit are trying to run Rendi through the mud for giving people info, I don't think it's a twitch only problem.
---
well i guess the intentions there isnt bad but the results of decrease price in stam and energy pots is negative
---
Literally any mmorpg will have issues with syncing informations between servers and crashing the servers in a way that it is not possible to recover will pretty much cause issues like this in every game.
---
&gt;	Jagex tried to sweep the entire thing under the rug
---
Sween:
---
&gt;	It's standard to not discuss active investigations and actions being taken, at least until after we've taken steps to resolve the issues.
---
Take off your tinfoil hat. Just because they don’t immediately go shouting everything from the rooftops doesn’t mean they’re trying to “sweep things under the rug.”
---
Simple case that the real world follows, do nothing until something bad happens
---
People are cops smdh
---
I'd be shocked if it was anything other than "yeah we're on it, chill"
---
Thats why everyone that isn't brain dead just tribrids now.
---
If he did, then yeah definitely. I found very little evidence that he did this, and if he did, it is on an incredibly low scale. Still bad and should be punished, but its not....this.
---
Surely he’s not dumb enough for this to be the same rendi.... right?
---
tbf there is strategy... imps spawn at two timepoints throughout an hour, theres like 10 mins of golden zone per hour. And theres two areas, with sandcrabs being the bad one.
---
&gt; Abusing that system is the exploit and the way of crashing servers like that seems to be relatively new
---
Read the tweet chain. The very first tweet is about crashing servers when Ice Poseidon was doing drop parties, it's the exact same concept - lots of people in one area performing red actions.
---
You do realize this entire game is “meaningless”.  You’re, I assume, playing it for enjoyment. If not then some of you need to think about some things lol. “MusT PlaY tWIstED leaGue cause Slay hElM...” it’s no longer fun. It’s an obsession lol
---
You got claaaarted and you know it
---
Love how ass is censored out but **** isn’t

This is definitely a ghost and not en egg.

He literally just said he's doing the same thing with non streamers??????
---
As someone who is a game programmer in the industry, It's stupid valuable to have worked with legacy code bases. While you won't be up to date with UE4 or Unity most game engines are fairly similar the only thing you have to learn is the small differences in how they use the language in engine (IE C# for unity and C++ for Unreal).
---
Working at Jagex on a old code base is super desired as a lot of AAA games do have a code base that was started in early 2010's. Also 10 years at Jagex is way more valuable than 5 years of unreal experience. Live service games like OSRS are becoming the norm with mobile development. Having 10+ years of work on it would give you an amazing idea on how live service work and would be super easily transferred to any other game/software live service or content job there could be
---
It is :)
---
I don’t understand
---
I am very sorry to hear that. Not only did you waste your RNG on a super pedestrian pet, but you wasted it twice! As you're probably aware you only have so much RNG in one acc, I am afraid this only means you will go super dry for something down the road, like over 5k for rangers or 30k Shamans for DWH. 
---
Again sorry for your loss of future RNG.
---
[Shameless plug.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e2k9l4/im_sorry_lucky_one/)
---
I assure you it's possible to make a system where crashing a server doesn't duplicate your character's shit.  Many mmos have solved this problem.  Stop equating osrs to the pinnacle of human programming achievement, it's an insult to the entire species.
---
Absolutely no idea why, why but this made "if we don't learn from history channel were doomed to repeat history channel" pop into my head and I'm currently completely losing my shit in the office. Thanks, needed that 👌
---
I use the app and filter by new posts

Going off of the RWT gold prices, Jeff Bezos makes roughly 1.5 trillion gp per hour.

Yes and they pretty sure that they fixed that way of crashing the servers, but they now found a different way to crash servers.

---

---
A select group, which is the same thing. If they actually cared about feedback they would just release alpha and beta worlds for everyone to test like WoW.
---
On your comment about the glitch being fixed:
---
Sometimes when you implement a fix for a large issue, you do it quickly, and therefore you may circumvent certain processes to get the fix out faster. Also, maybe their gut reaction is to get a quick fix and then a more in-depth patch out later to address the issues root cause.  
---
Testing in non-prod environments with a limited QA team is much different than making sure the fix works/doesn't break anything in production. Sometimes you have to undo the fix because something else broke, and thus the problem arises again. This is especially true for things like server crashes and load handling. 
---
In general, when bugs or exploits like this arise, the team responsible will take it very seriously. If they aren't communicating exactly what they are doing externally, then that means the process is likely ongoing and they can't make statements like "everything is fixed now". Internal communication is much different than external communication. 
---
In summary, just because something "is fixed", doesn't mean the issue is resolved.
---
I think it's fairly simple actually, you hold very limited time open betas for testing any specific phase.
---
I get the feeling that the issue is merely patched and that a "full fix" is something desired but is so limited that it'd take a major engine &amp; server update to remove potential future abuse.
---

Iron men don't make everything either. You still buy plenty of items and services from NPCs. There needs to be SteelMan mode, where you can't even trade with NPCs.
---
Dude you can just use a socks proxy per 1-2 accounts. They're cheap.
---
This is a really bad attitude to have.
---
If summoning ruined the game due to camping bosses forever then POH full heals and excessive teleport options does similar ruin OSRS. If Dung was what you say then whats that make Barb Assault lol? DG was probably my favourite bit of content RS ever released and taught me to cooperate in a team, forced me to meet and work with new people, and to get much more skilled at the finer points of the game. I appreciate your take on it nonetheless.

---
Did you do the quest ?
---
Which he didn’t discover either
---
Were the replicated gold stacks centralized back to the two problem accounts? It sounds like the gold was spread across many, many accounts to make the replication process as doubling as possible.
---
Look at my feet hehe! :)
---
I’m in fear for the RNG of the DWH tho
---
&gt;Many mmos have solved this problem.
---
They havent solved that problem, if you would pay any attention to any mmorpg you would have noticed that issues like items/progress being lost after a server crash still happens. What they have solved is by preventing intentionally crashing a server, ways to recover from a server crash, or other mechanics like item specific ids to delete duped items.
---
They however have not fixed the underlying synchronization issue between mutiple servers.
---
smh doesn't even care about his supporters
---
Well its either get rid of them and not have a minigame or just get rid of the only thing for people to get into pking For free.
---
The fact that suddenly it's ok to talk about this on reddit without getting instantly removed by the automod shows that whatever the remaining issues are, censorship isn't (and likely wasn't) necessary to prevent them.
---
\&gt; In general, when bugs or exploits like this arise, the team responsible will take it very seriously. If they aren't communicating exactly what they are doing externally, then that means the process is likely ongoing and they can't make statements like "everything is fixed now". Internal communication is much different than external communication. 
---
Again, I feel like blindly trusting Jagex to be on their ball game is rather silly when there's no direct evidence to do that, and there's some precedent to not do that.  Equating silence to "everything is ok old chum!" seems like unnecessary deference that isn't necessarily deserved.  That doesn't mean you should rush for conspiracy theories, but like, just assuming everything is fine isn't what I'd call a pro gamer move.
---
Speculation: it's pretty obvious what they mean by the remaining issues - due to the spaghetti code, there's always a chance someone can figure out a way to shit the server up and cause another time travel incident.  However, if anything, a huge vulnerability like that is something the general playerbase should be aware of - osrs is a product they rent, and there's a design flaw in that product that could result in bad things.
---
That's not favouritism though, and it's certainly not "streamer favouritism" by picking non-streamers.. Just because they don't let absolutely everyone in, doesn't mean they're picking and choosing favourites, it means they don't have the infrastructure/resources/desire to do the same type of PTR raid testing that Blizz does.

I like your strategy of just saying “pretty heavy tech background” too. It establishes you as an “expert” without you actually having to make it at all convincing
---
&gt;they could still perform the glitch.
---
Where is there evidence that it is still possible to do?
---
Melodramatic way of saying "just because osrs can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done"
---
Something like this is actually an ongoing project for a flash based permadeath mmorpg called Realm of the Mad God. Since flash is dying, the dev team has been working for the last few years on porting the game, *(which was originally made of spaghetti for a quick game design contest 10 years ago)* into unity. From what we've been told it's a huge undertaking.

Frivolous lawsuits do exist, yes, but not over non-existent documents. They could sue for something like defamation, they can't sue you because they claim they have a document they do not have.

Sometimes it's nice to read the comments to get more insight. I have zero desire to pour over the individual stats of proposed items, and as such I don't know when what's proposed is OP or not. I mean definitely take it with a huge grain of salt, but there are some active posters here who have way more insight into the long term wider effects of a proposition than I do.
---
Falador massacre? I remember
---
Instead of trying to moderate Reddit, the front page of the internet, maybe you should focus on a different form of customer feedback? 
---
It's actually laughable at how Jagex deals with this kind of stuff. The first thing you do is take to Reddit to try and defend your position instead of being open and honest with the player base. There's nothing wrong with standing up and saying 'hey, we fucked up, but here's what we've done about it' and taking the hit and rebuilding.
---
Instead you wait until someone makes a video about it actually showing the people what you won't.
---
What’s being speculated? All of these things happened.
---
Ask a Jagex employee for the raw data. Best bet most likely.
---
Yes we are quite literally on nearly the exact same update path.  The fact you can't see that just lets me know how unintelligent you are, literally compare the first 5 years of updates vs the updates we had through rs2.  Most all of them are carbon copies with a new skin.
---
No.
---
Next question.
---
I'm a pure and love watching these. It's a good lesson learned the hard way.
---
Did you not read what I said? Zalcano isn't hard because the "hard" part is doing the entire elf quest line and completing a grandmaster quest. Zalcano is the reward for doing that harder content. I don't see people complaining about Grotesque Guardians even though it has a 4m drop and a 2m one. And all Guardians need is 75 slayer and a gargoyle task. If the reward for doing Song if the Elves weren't profitable, many people would not do the quest. Just like if DS2's Vorkath and MM2's gorillas weren't profitable, less people would do them.
---
The reward for raising your skills and doing quests is good money. What's wrong with that? Do Vorkath and gorillas get a pass because they're more challenging? Is that it? Even though Vorkath shits out more money with his huge drop table? Even though gorillas are profitable with a chance at 10m? You'd complain about Zalcano dropping nothing but gems, ores and runes, with two 2m drops?
---
Yeah. And used and abused other content creators for views. 
---
Funny how this sub works.

I legitimately refuse believe you are dumb enough to believe companies have never sued over frivolous, non-enforceable NDA's.  Especially when we have a sitting US president who does this every other week, and several companies (such as Tesla) are currently in hot water for doing JUST THAT.
---
Come on kid.
---
Also UE4 or Unity have thousands of current, up-to-date resources. Proven experience of being able to navigate around proprietary legacy codebases and experience in modifying them is incredibly valuable. 
---
Someone like Mod Wolf is a recruiter's T-shaped wet dream. Deep experience in QA, some experience in developing a personal project from inception to release, and demonstable talent in presenting (and by extention, probably video production). It's a fantastic skillset to come out of a job with. Nearly every J-Mod has that very-public facing experience as well and it's rare to find in most places.
---
The people peddling the notion that (the technical) J-Mods are coming out of Jagex with worthless skills that won't get them hired either don't work in the programming/game industry or have just started. 
---
People are probably leaving because Jagex aren't paying them enough, and they know they'll get better elsewhere. These people resigning en masse from technical roles aren't going to have trouble finding jobs.
---
I don't believe they owe us a reason to why they fix things they do.
---
But being open would be cool.
---
It's awkward that randi saved the economy 😅
---
That would get me 8.145b.....tempting.
---
Not really? Rendi threw a big fit and settled told him to cut the shit.
---
Did you look at my  comment history or something? I just posted to that subreddit the other day. That game is fun, but tough as nails. It seems a lot simpler of a game than Runescape.
---
Rendi is just as shady as the guys duping gold. Dude runs an infernal cape selling website. It’s also not like he’s the face of transparency either, in multiple videos he doesn’t show his methods because he doesn’t want to get banned for bug abuse. The only reason he’s being transparent now is because he can twist the narrative into making him seem like a hero, when a lot of people, including Jagex, knew about this bug before Rendi even started talking about it. He’s taking credit for something he didn’t do. 
---
He’s also an egotistical maniac, but who cares about any of that, he saved our game right?! It’s not like Jagex couldn’t ban the abusers and remove the wealth!
---
👍 of course not.
---
I can only speak from personal feelings, i Dont like pling Because i Dont have the time spend to know the combos etc, so If i pk ill just die cause Im a Noob
---
Rendi saw an opportunity to glorify himself, that's pretty much all. 
---
If all he cared about was getting the game fixed he would have left it at the spam of PMs he sent to JMods. Instead he made it public in the Content Creator Discord for more attention (he later criticizes other content creators for making the issue more public right after he does so himself), and then, when JAGEX didn't give him the gratitude he desired, he made a video to complain about the lack of attention, whilst also sensationalizing the issue, painting him as both a hero AND a martyr who's risking his whole career (really no evidence at all to back that up, but hey, [people bought it](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e2d587/put_some_respecc_on_that/)), and assuming malice in the action of every party involved except himself, who had "nothing to gain and everything to lose".

We woulda just had a roll back.
---
Rendi managed to notice it happening in real time and get into the world.
---
Which content creators did he use and abuse?
---
Guess the skill: halfway at level 77
---
Point one his personality is an ego monster.  I don't care about his personality but his opinion on anything holds little weight fanboy.
---
Point two the bug was already know about as Jmods stated becasue they could see the server issues.
---
Point three His evidence is edited to make him look like a god and is biased.  Jmods have challenged the fact about getting back to him maybe you should read the jmod comments on the main post.
---
Point four yes it does matter, he can apologize and I like his content but it doesn't change who he is as a person everything is about him regardless of truth/fact.

I'm telling you, if you aint got a max mage/range/melee, all raids item/spirit shields bought with bonds you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt;nah, it wasn’t, next question. 
---
Idk I think you’re misrepresenting that a bit.
---
https://youtu.be/zVeGniqHxE0?t=5h54m34s
---
&gt;here babe come speak into this mic
---
But why did he do it
---
Dupe me daddy
---
Just take the ansiblex network n00b
---
If he pronounces it "Aitch See Eye Em" then the "an" makes sense. If you say the full "hardcore ironman" then an "a" makes sense.
---
It probably isn't worth getting mad about.
---
In the ideal world where gold crashed to literally being fully worthless then yes, but in the world we live in, the gold wont just become infinitely worthless, itll simply be made less, in this scenario all we would get is inflation.
---
you don't start a 'constructive discussion' by being a cock. fuck off and prick yourself
---
There is zero evidence that jagex actually knew about it before that. Remember when they "investigated" mod jed like 2 times and both times they found no wrongdoing?
---
I think it's just funny because you never hear it framed that way.
---
ahahaha lets see that runescape account hotshot, cmon flex on me daddy.
---
Me playing my ironman
---
Implement duplication glitch. Cover it up. Make bills. Buy as much bonds as you want.
---
Tldr
---
Yeah, ronan is irrelevant, and will always stay irrelevant. But at least he tries I guess lmfao
---
Idk if you're being ironic or not but it actually isnt that big of a deal... If it was a big deal they could do a rollback like they did when the tbow thing happened
---
Wait, wtf? Where did he say this? That sounds incredibly shady to me.
---
Well duh, he's an OSRS player
---
Yes 100%
---
I'd love for it to be around CoX difficulty. Hard but doable for most people if you wanna get to it. I find inferno tier content is interesting but I'll probably never get to it. I know a lot of the high level community is bored but a game can't cater to people who can tick flick everything, tick eat hits, and all the other difficult slight abuses of mechanics. i prefer just having mechanics that are hard instead of requiring people so i'm interested in this
---
Little Tim Allen goblin boy shats.

HaHyaHyaHyaHyaHyaHaHaWOW!

Go play wow kid. This game literally has a single player mode.

I can read "rune heraldic helm"

Headless clients are mostly used for bot farms, I’ll try to dig up some of my old resources when I get home.... Not that I condone this activity ;)
---
dont die
---
But what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
---
iirc, didn’t somebody buy several hundred $ worth of bonds and end up getting hit with a RWT ban?
---
It is crazy good gp/hr though.
---
I mean, there's only 52 weeks in a year, so anything 52,000 or over is 4 digits per week average.
---
&gt;Anyways, yeah, the rollback system has been known to dupe items since the Twisted Bow spawn happened
---
and jagex didn't fix it because they can't be arsed to pay a living wage to engine devs, despite the game being massively profitable. But that clearly isn't a problem, people not being nice to the small indie company is the real problem.
---
Same boat, still paying 58 bonds a month for my car
---
&gt; That game is fun, but tough as nails
---
would've agreed before they added functionality to pets.. I remember quiting soon after. Watering down gameplay and adding mtx to games doesn't bode well with me

Can we do this f2p?? Lol
---
Arcane will still be more than the new book. 
---
Arcane holds its value because of where it comes from, barely anyone does Corp. 
---
Mage books (the base) all come from bots and a heap of people will be doing the new content. 
---
It will start high and then drop quite a bit, like all new content.
---
Just stand on edge of wildy when you get a target and the come up to you move to safe zone and ask to buy.
---
How could you possibly know that without a rollback? 
---
It hasn't been patched. (Or at the very least has not been confirmed to have been patched).
---
Besides, patching that dupe would require significant engine work and also changing the way the game stores G.E. buy &amp; sell offers, which I highly doubt they've done.

Clan Wars has been used to crash servers before, that isn't new. Jagex also knew that when servers crashed items could be duped. [Mod Ash said so in 2018.](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/991369575265644544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E991369575265644544&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2F2007scape%2F) This isn't new information. The only thing Rendi found out was the 2 people who were crashing the server, but even then that wasn't Rendi's doing, it was a whole clan of people. 
---
Rendi also didn't report the bug abusers, he only told them to stop or he would, which is super shady.
---
And to add to this they recognize that people don’t enjoy the small, simple quests either. Which is why nearly all of the quest releases in the last couple years are all master or grandmaster.
---
How is the Prius V? I ended up going with the insight instead of the Prius for purely looks. I gotta assume yours is nice.
---
I’d keep maul for tek
---
That's why I stated that the replacement of the 2 factor for logging in wouldn't be the best idea. You could have both at the same time. The phone number would be a one time thing ( they can get several numbers to automate the call in all areas of the world, that's cheap). I meant a incentive for the phone number verification, and more added bank space would be a viable option. Staff don't make the calls silly, you create a call bot for validation.
---
There was a huge group of bots that were spreading the word of something with good intentions, I can't recall exactly what it was, but it seemed good at the time
---
&gt;because unique snowflakes are too shy to make some friends to play with.
---
A massive chunk of them do it just for the power.  
---
Heck, if you look at the account that opened this subreddit, he claimed a bunch of other subreddits with similar names, presumably just so he could moderate.
---
id think about adding a armadyl or dragon crossbow, so you can use dragonstone dragon bolts (e) so you can hit literal 100s on Olm head and big on other monsters with high max health. keep the blowpipe for dps tho.
---
Yeah that's just fine! You could even do it with less.
---
Really? So instead of using the argument that was he's saying is dumb you chalk it down to every Trump supporter has less than 80IQ? Jesus christ this sub is getting dumbed down.
---
Anything automated can be abused and falsified.
---
&gt;but the sheer amount of toxic interactions I've had has just kind of ingrained that in me.
---
It took you 3 comments to prove my point, thanks.
---
Agreed. Giving unsolicited advice is super rude. It assumes you know more than everyone else.
---
Who cares if someone else isn't playing efficiently? Let them play the way they want.
---
Feathers are the new currency boys
---
Yup. He’s a drama queen
---
There is a player who has a level 3 account named Sabo Lane who is intentionally throwing games in Castle Wars by spamming barricades throughout the map so that his pure on the other team can win tickets. He event told me this when I asked him why. Can anything be done about this? It's seriously ruining the minigame.
---
Yes.

You fail to realize the implications of gold duplication. Gold would literally become worthless. The creation power of this bug was far to great. But im sure you are right and this specific time would have been different unlike every other time this has happened....
---
Bull roarer clue step, defender step, legend cape step.
---
They didn’t tell the community what happened after they fixed it and separately  the subreddit was being censored excessively
---
That's one of the worst pet grinds, gz!
---
I go mental getting attacked every 10 minutes up there
---
Lol @ recording the screen with your phone
---
Yes because Jagex has never been disingenuous in their communications with the community
---
Congrats on 500k
---
Phone number linked to accounts, one account ban = all accounts under number banned / number no longer usable for a period of time.
---
Jagex is in the bug abuse community discord’s..
---
They know what they do, they know all of it.
---
People are under the impression that this is all brand new. 
---
Item duping this way has been around for MONTHS if not years, forcibly crashing servers is newer, but still isn’t as new as people think.
---
Way to justify being a paranoid asshole
---
&gt;Did you not read what I said? Zalcano isn't hard because the "hard" part is doing the entire elf quest line and completing a grandmaster quest. Zalcano is the reward for doing that harder content.
---
The reward for progression should not be that you now get to do easier content, that's ridiculous. 
---
&gt; I don't see people complaining about Grotesque Guardians even though it has a 4m drop and a 2m one. And all Guardians need is 75 slayer and a gargoyle task
---
Literally everyone complains about Guardians all the time and have done so since release because of how tedious it is to do compared to the rewards it gives. Have you literally been living under a rock?
---
&gt;The reward for raising your skills and doing quests is good money. What's wrong with that? Do Vorkath and gorillas get a pass because they're more challenging? 
---
Yes. Not sure what else to say lol Yes that's the exact reason they get a pass
---
&gt;Even though gorillas are profitable with a chance at 10m? You'd complain about Zalcano dropping nothing but gems, ores and runes, with two 2m drops?
---
Not sure what you're hoping to achieve by trying to downplay how much gp/hr Zalc, it shits out gp and that's a fact, saying lol ores lol 2m unique doesn't change that fact. And the price of the uniques doesn't matter, it's the average gp/hr that matters
---
You can actually track them on the main client as well. Find a normal impling spawn. Click to catch but open an interface. Catch on a different account. You will be able to track the position generally based on the direction that your account is facing.
---
Anyone have a clip?
---
And reddit will award you for your attacks
---
You can have opinions you know you jack hole
---
Excited to probably see all of this fail pass, sadly
---
This comment is an example of coping
---
I've never heard of him lmao
---
Feathers would be tied to the currency due to the item shops. You would need something else to be the stable defacto currency. 
---
In other games, runes of some type would usually fit the bill, but again, rune stores break that.
---
Finally telling it how it really is. Everyone keeps calling Rendi brave.. in reality he has zero risk due to community backlash if jagex intervenes, and he gets a fuck ton of views and growth to his channel because of how over-exagerated this thing is.
---
cmon papi, show me how big your xp is
---
&gt;	He was the one who alerted jmods to a dupe occuring
---
Lmao nope. I’m sure he likes to think so, but let’s be real: it’s not like he told them anything they weren’t already aware of.
---
I got one at 68 farming from a herb patch, specifically the one at the troll stronghold
---
Little shit has done nothing but cost me 5m in reclaiming fees because I had stupid deaths, he is staying in the bank until they finally add the recolors that have been proposed on this subreddit for months. Ngl he kinda cute tho
---
Nice
---
Fixed mode with stretched plugin fills the screen
---
Wow congratulations on spelling that very tough word timmy! I'm sure your parents are proud :)
---
Nice.
---
I assume for tier 4 you think the choice is clue hunter then? Dhins doesn't feel strong enough unless aiming for 100 or 200m fm. I haven't progressed that much yet (only been playing 3 days), but I feel like konar's blessing would be better than the clues because the money from clues isn't needed after slaying for a while and the 30% bonuses on tasks will allow for much quicker resource gathering from tasks (ores, herbs etc). But as I said I haven't progressed that much yet and don't have any actual numbers on this
---
Can you cancel tasks in TL without 30 slayer points? Id rather do that tbh and rebuild my streaks
---
CML assumes gp is zero time through alt accounts
---
Timmy*
---
and this is one of them
---
And now he's turning into the person who takes every word you typed literally because he knows he has no leg to stand on. Actually pathetic
---
Ah yes. That is surely why the gold buying market is so tiny, most players dont partake!
---
My job only requires high school and drivers license and I make about 400k NOK (40k pounds) a year (low for my country)
---
Looked up the first one (football302), says he as 60/60/60 str/att/def. Now maybe that clip was filmed a while ago and since getting 2 def he levelled to 60, but I'm a little suspicious that you're up to some bullshit here.
---
It fine
---
Can you make a video?
---
Take 1/2 gp from every player and give it to me.
---
Exhibit A
---
Exhibit B
---
Just kill baby blues
---
Agreed. Finally. A polling system with hidden results would of made OSRS maybe not as popular but better. And in another restart event, that should probably happen if they want to keep the majority of the playerbase happy. The RS3 community maybe to blame since now so many crossed over atlast. Im also thinking kids are just gaming retarded from too much slider app based games that are pay to win with training wheels and knee pads for special needs. The new generation knw no SEGA, SNES and PS1/N64 struggles, no certing your stacks on dial up or legends cape claws of guthix rune beasts. They will vote for whatever there favourite old nerd streamer endorses. Of course the luxury of OSB, RL does mitage so much of my current cynical gripes with "oldschool" and help those kids. Still think the game/system/design in pre late 2012 was absolutely the smoothest version of a java mmorpg if there ever was one. And the meta was essentially perfect. So many things achieved were done in amazing ways, due to the playerbase being fully neglected from end of free trade onwards.
---
I remember when just some fishing was posted here and i thought it was prettty meme and liked the style the video had now we have all these fuckin amazing quality videos, hell of a job Jim.
---
Exhibit C
---
Your whole morning has been consumed by shit talking rendi. You seem very upset and obsessed, it's very very weird
---
Those are terrible excuses. If your fingers are too fat go to the gym, consume less sodium, and drink less pop.
---
If he was paid every 2 weeks, you would double his income, not halve it. Which means the upper limit is 96k
---
Mines 57. RIP. Dream car though :) #worth and almost done.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
there is, it's called playing OSRS without getting out of your chair for 8 hours a day
---
They could get help over text chat at the GE. Thats why you need to raise the kids yourself, so you can never give them the vocabulary to ask for help
---
gold will stay a currency with a vlaue literally via any purchasable item in the game for an gold-item exchange whereas gold can be exchanged into an item and be used as a basis for trading, which still means that gold itself is responsible for all and any items values no matter what
---
The Q&amp;A already happened my dude.
---
GP is zero-time, shit method.
---
rendi bad, jamflex good
---
Yeah, no, it was amusing for a while, but now you are sending me harrassing PMs. Blocked.
---
Gain nothing aside from presenting yourself as the hero of Runescape for massive e-points (which has clearly worked given all the posts about you) after misrepresenting a lot of communication and details in an overly dramatic video, and sensationalising yourself as a martyr just because you told jagex about a bug that was then investigated and could be rolled back.
---
Of course it would ruin the game, I'm not disputing that. What I'm saying is you won't see a mass exodus from the game like we did with EoC. Hell, there wasn't even a significant drop after free trade removal. People will continue to play, the game will continue, bondies will suffer economically whereas us superior Irongods will go about business as normal.
---
You dont see the irony in what you're doing here?
---
Does swamp paste and herb do anything or are you judt looking for the nothing interesting action?
---
Sea Shanty 2 on loop at 300% volume 24/7

I’ve used/done way more content on my iron man. I just farm the shit out of zulrah for gp on my main. Id say main accounts are Goldmen.
---
Literally just a 6 hour animation of your character paddling so you always get kicked right before you arrive
---
Mortgage? Why have a mortgage when I can buy out half of the RuneScape economy?
---
Just take a stab at Corp why dont you?
---
Why enslave adults when you can enslave a few computers to play Runescape for you 24/7 on multiple accounts?
---
I normally make sure that all the accounts are muted before i give them access. Then i use parental controls to ensure that they can't make new accounts, or access any real websites.
---
Single-handedly saving the whole economy of a game like it's nothing. What a great guy.
---
so if gold ever gets 0 value, the items purchased from it will have value in trading, so does that mean u basically turned 0 gp into gold?? no, you simply have an inherent value of gold
---
There is no irony dog
---
You forgot to include part where RoT 1 itemed

---
I remember your first vid. The commentary is golden. You little shats!
---
Mine is 0 bonds just payed that motherfucker off
---
only 1 kc tho
---
rendi's content would be a lot more palatable if he didn't stretch out videos longer than they needed to be and he wasn't so self-important and insufferable
---
Dang 20 whole kc on your main? Basically woox
---
Pure evil.
---
Love your videos jimmy, the songs are so fucking good also. I hope jagex put a quest out every month just so you i never have to stop watching. Enjoying these much more than swampletics (and i love settled)
---
Yikes. I think you should sit down for what we are about to tell you.
---
Nothing interesting other than paste stacking. EHP has you cutting and eating the barbarian fish, but that's comparatively more click intensive and less rhythmic.

---
Yeah, I mean who doesn't have a 2000 account bot farm ready to be deployed at a moment's notice
---
You joke, but back when I played EvE Online the oft given advice was to get a minimum wage job to buy enough plex to get a proper start in the game
---
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks

Is it even possible to freeze crypto currency? I thought the whole point was to prevent the government from having control over assets.

99 farming isn't even dry I dont think, I'm 36m no pet, gotta keep grinding!
---
&gt;Its hard for me to grasp the fact that you like him since he isn't a cunt?
---
Not saying it's hard for you to grasp the fact, I'm saying it's hard for you to not be a cunt for no reason. 
---
&gt;That's a low bar.
---
Not like you should have high bars for liking people. You end up looking like an asshole if you have some arbitrary high bar.
---
You completely missed the point I made with my previous comment, as well as adding your own asinine insights that are unwarranted. Go be an asshole somewhere else, dude.
---

---
It's the Fremennik Shield fiasco all over again
---
Rumor is that sub mods believe more of the player base would try to exploit this glitch than helping wrote new coding to solve it.  Your thoughts?
---
dont think sirens should have feet but a big tail instead
---
No, I said this: If someone found a way to crash servers that's different than this method they could still perform the glitch.
---
Stop being disingenuous. 
---
What are you even arguing? That jagex not only patched the method for crashing, but entirely renovated their save state method in the background? That is extremely, extremely unlikely, so I'd like to see some proof please, though I'm not sure why you are even making this weird ass argument in the first place
---
Path of Exile uses their leagues to also test new content not available in the base game.  Once the league ends certain new mechanics/content that were added in the league that usually receive excellent feedback end up getting added to the base game. 
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if OSRS followed suit.
---
Not in the UK, its £3.99 for 1 or £39.99 for 10
---
Not everyone gets a trophy. He didn't complete the challenge, no payment. Becoming a man is payment enough
---
I did not say that there is going to be. I said that there would be if the economy was crashed like it could have been.
---
Same :( wish I got a cheaper car
---
So, listen up.
---
-finish uni
---
-become engineer
---
- work in a consulting firm that pays stupidly high amounts but drains you to the point where you sleep for 3h a day and dream about working
---
-quit, get half a million dollars and flood the market with so many bonds you break the economy
---
Profit?
---
Low level players are noy pures because they have 1 defence, its just better to level strength and attack first as you wont get to ear any dps bonus armor anyways that early
---
No I understood it all. I get it you're mad I called this dude out for being an internet janitor. I think it's fucking hilarious you respect that this guy mods subreddits.
---
Don’t worry my glitch cc already has many times.  The fact they believe more of the OSRS community would exploit an active glitch than help Jagex write new code to avoid it is crazy.
---
I know the pain. Not dealing with it anymore but sports cars are expensive.
---
Ronan: If only you knew how bad things really were
---
Mat K: OSRS will only last for 5-10 more years under current management
---
And the news of a J-mod leaving every other month. Yep, things are perfectly normal at Jagex.
---
There’s a banner for each house, they all look pretty cool and you can match them to your outfit
---
I think they reduced the crush bonus by 1, so it was the same stats as rapier and blade of saeldor
---
Rendi is claiming to be some sort of hero and against it though, while simultaneously telling people how to do it. He's a hypocrite and will do anything for clout.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s really that simple of a field. I think it’s something we all have an intuition for, but that I tuition is wrong so much of the time that it actually makes it quite hard to get the correct result.
---
I wasn't being a dick smfh my fr*king head
---
I snort pee probably just a nz methhead
---
This would only work if it was randomised for the server, but every player had the same. The best part of twisted leagues is the theory crafting with all your friends
---
what was so crazy about october
---
I buy shit when I’m currently using it and sell when I’m finished with whatever I’m doing. Maybe loose a few k to flippers is much better than tanking 20 mil trying to sit on stuff. But I did make 2m on a blowpipe I forgot I had lol

Currently in my bank if I have 6 Amulet of Glorys all going down in charges, 6,5,4,etc.. when I withdraw one they don't leave a place holder even though i have them turned out. Also if I have a 6 charge glory withdraw it use one charge and deposit it, if I dont have a 5 charge it replaces my 6 charge and puts itself in that placeholder spot. (I know what I stated in my first sentance) Is this a bug I'm experiencing or is this intentional?
---
They did respond to him and they detected it themselves?
---
Seriously jagex did nothing wrong here
---
Yeah I don't think the community would handle that very well
---
You mean like rendi did?
---
&gt;The word 'dupe' should not have been censored. You might be able to argue that discussion of how it happens should be deleted, but making people aware that there is an active game breaking bug should not be censored.
---
The actual thread that Rendi used to show that "dupe" was being censored has the word dupe in it several times, alongside the person typing it out as if it were auto-censored which I highly doubt. He could of just used Ctrl+F to find this but making it look like some grand conspiracy is far more engaging I guess. Thread:

Please don't call them admins, they're moderators. Admins are the pinnacle of Reddit staff and are paid by Reddit to handle the site. Moderators are self-appointed users who monitor specific subreddits, they have little control outside of the subs they manage. It's kind of like a player mod vs a Jagex mod, the player mod might be able to mute and report players in game but Jagex mods are essentially god.
---
Tbf he had direct contact with people who were just one forced crash away from doubling the amount of gold in the entire game. If jagex couldn't prevent the preceeding 1.10e^11 billion event, they sure as fuck weren't going to prevent the 10 trillion one without rendi spamming them. That's why I think the hatejerk rendi is getting is unfair, had he kept silent we would have had to endure a total rollback and lose days of progress. The video could have been made less sensational, but that alone doesn't deserve him getting all this hate. Imagine if he didn't flag jagex down and later disclosed that he was aware of the bug, we would probably all be upset.
---
It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't type of situation. But at the same time this community has the worst community when it comes to rational thinking and mob mentality. Yall are dramaqueens

Hmmm. The way bot clients used to work, you could open literally hundreds of bots at once on a computer that could only support maybe 10 actual accounts. The bot clients would render things differently to where it uses very minimal resources. I ran like 40 bots one time on a stock intel Pentium back in like 2008. If that thing could run 40 bots, I couldn't imagine how many my computer can run right now lol.
---
But I do see what you are saying, my guess is that the 2 people ran at least 900 bots each and I'm sure bots now days have multiple vpn connections so you dont risk banning a main account while botting, thus changing the login connections. Still, that's like 500 vpns or else you still have 4 and 5 connections from the same location which doesnt seem reasonable imo.
---
Lastly, even so, an ftp world jumping up to 2k players from where it was should have alerted them in general. Why would a world go from 300-400 players to 2k players that quick? Jagex must have been sleeping.
---
Not really, you don't want the information of working but exploits being spread openly as that they want others to attempt it themselves.
---
anyone got a clip?
---
This happened to me. I stopped playing for a few years and when I came back, turns out the account had gotten hacked, botted on, and banned. I tried the appeal option expecting nothing in return but they actually did unban me.
---
This is not the same. This was developed by an old Jagex employee colluding with the bug abusers.
---
Wait until he gets promoted to “sales engineer”, that’ll show mom.
---
it doesn't just become expensive, it's expensive right away, 80$ for a night of drugs ? fuck that shit
---
Remember when someone forgot to pay a bill and it started a war that ended in $300,000 worth of destroyed ships?
---
Omg. Thank youu. I forgot he exist there. Thanks!
---
I'd have loved the plot twist of him actually getting the cape like those 16-17cb fire capes that happened recently.
---
I still buy my bonds in pesos.
---
So do percs
---
&gt;sn’t seem to cover any of the other interactions that occurred between him and the JMods in the server in which we did quickly acknowledge his tip-offs and did 
---
Actually that's not true at all, unless it is written very poorly an NDA covers anything you know that you ordinarily wouldn't. As it turns out, except for spills prior to signing, it includes anything you have learned past present and future, and is usually enforceable for one year past the date of signature (due to relevancy) unless specifically stated otherwise, and that otherwise specific usually has to be spelled out, not just general info.

Your rent is only $350? Damn that's a good deal.
---
I would if i could afford one. And tbh I'm burned on vork, been camping him since i had to rebuild
---
Oh, it's not suppose to look like that?
---
I just think there is nothing Jagex will be able to do.  The amount of RWT and botting for RWT is insane.  The only true way to fix this is just to sell gp from the rs website.  Sure it will destroy the economy but who cares, RWT and botting would be fixed!

Ironman BTW

Glad people in this thread are starting to realise that Rendi's video was just a huge attention grabbing effort. Acting like he's some god-given savior of the osrs community like dupes have never happened before. And then when Jagex haven't done anything to him and are just trying to control the situation he sets himself up as a martyr and says nah fuck you I need the publicity thanks.
---
Thank you so much!

Sounds like your email is compromised. You need to put 2FA(Two factor authentication) on your email account + change email password + set/change recovery questions. Then setup authentication again on runescape and change your runescape password. I think this is generally it when it comes to securing your account.
---
(Make sure both emails have 2FA and are secured btw)
---
Another good precaution is to have an antivirus software and to make sure your computer is not infected. Malwarebytes (Premium) is a pretty good one. Real-time protection for everything (with premium). Can get a trial members version for 2 weeks without credit card.
---
Thank you!
---
Not really. Im pretty mediocre.
---
But I'm someone who has dealt with, and continues to deal with addiction.
---
 I also know that when somebody reached out to me, it led me to reexamine how I treated my body and lived my life. So if anyone needs help, I would love for them to get in contact with me so I can keep the cycle going.

Heaven

Like adding an infinite tbow spawn? Or the infinite gold from pvp that took like an hour max to find? I understand deep bugs that changing one thing changes something else 100x unrelated, but some of the bugs are pretty surface level
---
It’s like all those people who saw that allegation on the “People whose NDAs expired what stories do you have?” And someone said everyone there is all on coke.
---
Like it makes for a funny story but forgive me if I don’t buy a single reddit comment as concrete authority
---
Well, i don’t think it’s entirely common knowledge that you need a house before you can get con exp from wt. so without knowing that, the post might not make a whole lot of sense
---
first of all I do not calculate slayer with max xp rates, since this is unreasonable to keep up. 60k is not hard to keep up. i dont know where you get these 300 hours for slayer from, but it is way to long if you do duradel. 
---
Yet again you are showing me a calculation where we have no clue what kind of tasks for slayer was done and how much xp you get there per hour. So this beautiful graph may be right on paper, but it neglects a few things, which are actually crucial in THIS case. 
---
Its funny how you say to me , that I am bias with my "max efficiency playing" , but yet again you show me this. :P
---
These 300 hours are only possible if you have between 45k-50k xp per hour on average....
---
Wait what happened with gold glitching?
---
Isn't it Mod Gee's birthday as well?

Learn to lure one into the NE building. No need for splashing.
---
Do you plan on pking on that account or making an account designed for pking?
---
Awesome! Great to know! I feel like I'm too broke and have too much bossing inexperice for my lvl so I'm hyped to start learning!
---
Of all the items to accidentally add a spawn of lol...

Moved to NJ from NYC and my motorcycle insurance dropped from 32 bonds a month to 6.
---
regardless of your terrible opinion, it’s 100% against the rules
---
Literally if you had typed that into google instead of posting here, you would have your answer immediately. Please don’t expect people to spoon feed you information that is easily accessible.
---
Jagex: hold my asgarnian ale
---
Should be 2147M in Plat Tokens.
---
I would invest in real bonds that way your fake bond purchasing power increases .....after a year you may increase your 8.5 m/hr to say 30m/hr all counting that your investment in real bonds multiplies by 9% and the inflation in fake bonds increases to 10m each risky move but scared money dont make money your choice

Ahhh....Eve....spreadsheet simulator meets IRL warfare. Nothing quite like it.

I don't think you understand what "salary" means
