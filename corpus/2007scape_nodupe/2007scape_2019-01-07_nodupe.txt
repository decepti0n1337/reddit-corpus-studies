Seriously though, not cool. It‚Äôs annoying to experienced players and just mean to new players. There are much funnier Nieve jokes you should go waste your time on that don‚Äôt waste everyone else‚Äôs.

Vandalizing forces people to the new wiki which should eventually raise its rankings on Google
---
Hi beserker10!
---

---
In case you are unaware, the Old School RuneScape wiki has recently moved to an independent site, bringing benefits such as up-to-date wiki software and a fully ad-free browsing experience and a toggle-able dark mode. The wiki's new domain is **[oldschool.runescape.wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki)**. You can also use the short links **[oldschool.wiki](https://oldschool.wiki)**, **[osrs.wiki](https://osrs.wiki)**, and **[os.rs.wiki](https://os.rs.wiki)**.
---
As a result, the old version is no longer actively maintained. Information found there can be outdated or be incorrect due to vandalism.
---
Submissions about vandalism of the old site are currently treated as spam. If your post is about vandalism, please delete it.

w330 has always been unusable for me unless i‚Äôm just hopping to go into a hosts house or something
---
Slayer or herblore imo are the two best looking capes.. in terms of usefulness go for crafting or construction..
---
Hope you start feeling better OP I cant imagine the pain of breaking your neck
---
Prayer 
---
Yeah thought I was going mad. And I genuinely can't find the new one
---
To do this do you buy the notes or the individual runes? As they get more expensive in shops as you buy more, is there a certain number you should stop buying at?
---
And then you just sell them on the GE for a bit more than you spent?
---
there was a guy at the ge saying he was trimming armour so expecting a meme i went to give him an adamant platebody thinking he'd either decline the trade or give it back to me. He accepted and absolutely yote out of my world and i nearly cried a few tears of joy thinking of the old days
---
If you haven't been assessed for autism before, now would be a great time to go find out.

Agility.
---
The reader mode looks better, thanks.
---
What I‚Äôm saying is, iirc on the old wiki I could Google ‚Äúranarr weed osrs‚Äù, click the first link for ‚Äúranarr weed‚Äù and that page would have the monsters that drop grimy ranarr at the bottom.
---
On the new wiki, the page for ranarr weed does not contain that information. Instead I have to go from the page for ‚Äúranarr weed‚Äù to the page for ‚Äúherbs‚Äù to the page for ‚Äúgrimy ranarr weed‚Äù to find that same information.
---
What a bondie
---
This is by no means a sarcastic reply or a detering response,  but please tell me how you want to keep the game fresh after over 18 years? You claim the game is "easy" and "straightforward" yet there are things like the ToB, Chambers, Vengeance PKing, recoiling, tribriding, hybriding, and a constant income of gold with no reliable gold sinks. I propose a way to not only add to the current game but to try and spice things up. These items are by no means something low levels or maybe even mid game players should be able to afford. the stones range around 50m worth of value. the other consumable are that, consumables, things you invest money into to get an effect that's relatively valuable. Gold sinks, money makers for people and sinks for others. I love that in essence OSRS is a basic game, but it CAN be that and much more for other people. RS manages to please a wide range of people because of this. This doesn't mean it has to be stuck in time without change. 
---
Looks like something from r/im14andthisisdeep 
---
Runecrafting. 
---
Well then you are wrong
---
But how much HP does it recover?
---
Nah, wiki is fine. Wikia is redirecting
---
Use osrs.wiki
---
osrs.wiki
---
I feel that Agility pays off better than any other skill. Most skills only help you train that skill, but Agility helps with almost everything and it doesn't require certain milestones to start being useful, every level helps a little bit more.
---
The corp's defence level is 310: [Corporeal Beast](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Corporeal_Beast)
---
DWH lowers the defence by 30% so it will go 310 &gt; 217 &gt; 152 &gt; 107 after 3 specs
---
When you hit 20 with a BGS on corp that was actually a 40 before the damage reduction so it will knock 40 off the corp's defence (assuming it still has defence, otherwise it will come off strength or attack or magic in that order depending on which are not yet zero).
---
You will get heavily decreased mark spawns now so I would do seers. 
---
Guess I'll bookmark cause this is confusing 
---
Just someone messing with the old wikia that isn‚Äôt upkept anymore. The automod just posted the link to the new wiki that‚Äôs officially supported by Jagex, and doesn‚Äôt have the trash ads that the wikia had.
---

Look up prayer training on the wiki
---
When i was low lvl iron i made air bstaffs with the daily staffs from varrock diary. In order to get cosmics i did temple trekking for pure ess. Its like 10k pure ess an hour. Otherwise you just slay for them. Gargs, wyverns, abby demons all drop some pure ess probably a few more as well
---
Almost spit out my tea 
---
Wrong wiki new fish 
---
I just looked on the wikia version of ranarr weed (pre nieve vandalism), there is no dropping monsters listed on the clean one, nor is there a link to the grimy version, so I'm still unsure what you mean.
---
You can also use osrs.wiki/whatever to get to a specific page. If you want the adamant sq shield, like OP wanted, you can type osrs.wiki/adamant_sq_shield and it'll bring you right there.

i think its sorted by slayer level, isnt this easier? lol
---
&gt;It isn't outdated
---
It's not being updated nearly as frequently as the new one. The main page hasn't been updated since October. It's still using the Halloween background. Wikia literally does not care about our game or our community, they're just after that sweet, sweet ad revenue. Embedded videos on popular pages are absolute cancer (they're made by people who don't know shit about the source material).
---
The new wiki has a "reader mode" or some shit if you really liked the ugly centered space-wasting fandom design. The new wiki has a dark mode. The new wiki has moderation. The new wiki doesn't have ads. The new wiki is easier to edit (fandom's editing system is a fucking convoluted mess in comparison, and that's not even an opinion).
---
Stop wasting your time on a shit wiki.

You must be new lmao you‚Äôll learn eventually

Honsetly, skip coffee for a week. Spend $11 on one month of membership and earn more than enough to keep your membership going. There‚Äôs plenty of methods of getting bond money in p2p spending less than 15 mins a day on them so save yourself the hassle. I did the same and it changed the entire game for me.

---
He needs it 
---
Yeah man I think the same thing. I would also like to see a dragon killing spell for magic. Since range has the Dragon Hunter Crossbow and Melee is going to have the new 20 percent damage/Accuracy Lance it would make sense for all the combats to have something for dragons.  Not too sure for balancing but it should be like a level 89-92 spell that does 20% more damage and accuracy DPS wise than fire surge with a tome of fire.
---
Banshees for lower level slayer
---
Well that's largely because cutting down a tree isn't implemented in an interesting way. If you got logs by making a group of 1-4 people and operating a lumberyard in a minigame that required a nontrivial amount of skill, and benefited from having high wc/fletching/construction/etc then "skilling" for resources wouldn't be as bad. Particularly if there were rare drops like a BiS woodcutting axe, so it operates like a boss in terms of potential high reward. Granted, if bosses weren't overloaded like they are now then it wouldn't need this rare drop, since its benefit would already be that it's consistent money/resources.
---
Guess I am just wrong then. Me disliking change is making me think a bunch of shit is wrong with the new one.
---
Why does everyone downvote u everytime

You need to do any halloween event to unlock it. If you haven't done one yet then you can unlock it when the next halloween event happens.

When you can‚Äôt think of a good money maker and all the competition is doubling money 
---
It's crazy how people are so obsessed with the new wiki. Just let us enjoy the old wiki. Assholes going around griefing just makes me want to use the new wiki even less.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what happened but I‚Äôve never done that, this is my main and only account, I usually also argue with people and nothing happens (I pk so people get pretty mad) 
---
Thanks 
---
I remember back in the day on RS2 when I was a noob it was my go to money maker. Low requirements, and 1k pure ess would bag me 160k! When I was a low level that bought me my full time armour set and loads more besides.
---
I feel like im alone in enjoying rs. There are some things i dont really enjoy but if i ever get to the point where i get bored or burned out i either log out or do something else. Are really this many people playing a game they really dont enjoy?
---
It's not an L if you don't take it
---
I dunno. When grotesque guardians came out people immediately (and still do, to a lesser extent) asked for better gp/hr. It makes sense that they would, since normal gargs are more gp/hr than the boss version, but that's how bosses *should* be; you get a chance at rare loot, not constant rewards that outclass everything else. Afaik the reason GGs are still in their current state is because they're a "midgame" boss at only 75 slayer.
---
How the hell is agility afk? Requires a click every few seconds
---
Thanks. I did what you suggested.
---
He probably should have just created a new page for max level grinding. ‚ÄúTraining‚Äù kinda implies you‚Äôre not already at endgame.
---
On those same highscores there are about half a million people between 50 and 70 ranged.
---
200m exp in woodcutting is what hell is 
---
You do or you don't
---
false. trimmed armour wasn't added until 2004.
---
Do you even zmi
---
They cared enough to say gz, I don't even bother to say that.
---
Heeeey, it's me, your f2p brother
---
Your saying add more skilling outfits in the game? Like prospectors?
---
Yep :/ vandalizing the previous source of information is hardly going to make me want to make the greater effort of using a new service....
---
Why didn‚Äôt you switch to other methods?
---
Stealing your girl probably
---
BBDs should cap at 2m/hr on max whereas rune dragons are more gp for more effort.
---
I'd kill another 95k bbds anytime over 95k rune dragons
---
oh of course lol! sounds fucking sick as rs midi
---
why not? the armor is borderline useless
---
The last thing I want to see is RC becoming a buyable skill that's more about the size of your cash stack than any particular effort put in to level the skill. Technically it's already a buyable but it's a high-effort skill--and for good reason, I think, given how profitable it gets at high levels. This would push it drastically in the direction of bankstanding. I'm not fond of that idea.
---
I'm not convinced the skill needs any major changes overall. Pre-77 it's slow and not very AFK, yes, but not to the degree that it needs to be changed, I don't think.
---
Wowee you fixed the hair
---
yeah, "frog tea" is actually from a song and there is no actual translation for that
---
"n√£o mete o louco comigo" actually means "don't fuck with me", everything else is correct
---
On those same highscores there are about 1.5 million people below 70 ranged
---
Couldn‚Äôt they redirect all old links to their new site?...
---
If hes quadropling money in 2 trades than isn't that thr samr as doublong money in 1 trade

I never knew the new wiki was a thing, iv been using the old one religiously. I would get so triggered by how inaccurate the old one was derp
---
I found it pretty good for everything really, why didn‚Äôt u like it?
---
Thanks bro will be doing this
---
the site has been "vandalised" but its probably just them trying to get everyone over to the new one
---
they got rid of this?
---
I know this is 5 months ago, but this doesn't matter here. You have to click the spell and click the mob, so the option on click doesn't matter. That's why it's so common to get skull tricked there.
---
As of right now ornate pool renders graceful useless. Only piece of content i see it useful for is blast furnace and even then you still need stam pots.
---
If double xp were to be introduced it would never be just one weekend. At the very least it would be once a month, or quarter. 
---
Just do a bunch of quest no need to train early levels go for barrows gloves and desert treasure they have a load of pre quest and level requirements once you finish those two quests your account would be decently leveled 
---
Yeah I was doing that up until recently haha, we know now at least
---
Hmmm have not noticed any instability myself.
---
Competition is good. Considering most worlds are not even half full, no need to add more imo.
---
Join his clan chat or friends chat maybe? 
---
Are they going up because you're buying them?
---
What is there to fix about the message? It is informing players that the Wiki moved from Fandom to a new Jagex supported site. As all the posts today show, a lot of players still aren't aware. If you want to use or maintain the old Wiki no one is stopping you, but that doesn't mean players should be unaware of other options.
---
üòÇ the drug number üòÇ 
---
i dont like either.
---
Then just do that haha, nobody is forcing you to do a skill if you don‚Äôt want to
---
I'm about 20 hours into F2P mobile, just dicking around in Security while I work on combat skills. Currently have Str/melee/def/ranged at 35ish each.
---
I want to pop my trial and go member in the next few days because I want to get Ava's Accumulator. I like ranger play a lot more so I've been grinding towards the Animal Magnetism reqs.
---
Good idea or bad? Seems like a useful item for primarily using ranged.
---
No
---
Also, my post was to discuss what npc store makes the most money (i.e. where players spend the most money), not the one a player makes the most money at.
---
Okay, I understand. Thanks alot!

92/99
---
Just keep your public on off, it's not really necessary. 
---
Yeah, I think the drop rate is too high personally. I mean I understand why it is that way since if you were actively hunting for it, it'd be a nightmare getting the totem pieces. But if you do a lot of slayer in the catacombs, you get to kill Skotizo quite a lot so sooner or later you're going to land it. 
---
Glad you didn't lose your hcim status irl! Go for a money making one first and then spend the $ you get on a costly 99, boom, you got 2 for 1.

# *EDIT*
---
Definitely wasn't expecting this reaction, so thank you.
---
Here's some answers to a few questions:
---
Q: Are you going to sell them to see how low the price will dip?  
---
A: Undecided. If I do, I'll post a new thread with the results.  
---
Q: Are they going up because you're buying them?  
---
A: I haven't had any active buy offers in GE for several months. The last batch I bought was from another collector, not from GE, so it's unlikely I'm the cause of the rise.  
---
Q: How did you acquire them all?  
---
A: I originally bought a large batch from Cr1itikal during one of his streams over a year ago, and since then made it a joke to leave in offers for absurd amounts. I eventually ran out of money to fund it and have only added to the collection when I can buy out other large collections.  
---
Q: Do you collect anything else?  
---
A: Yes, several items. Though my favorite collection (other than these precious, precious kebabs) are my hammers - I am just shy of 100k.  
---
Q: Are you XYZ player?  
---
A: My RSN is Resume, so probably not.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Incase pet
---
Pretty sure the fastest way is having a fairy ring in your player owned house, but as far as no-requirement teleports go salve graveyard is one of the best.
---
PvPer I presume? 
---
Was super excited to train RC from 8-99 using astrals.  Decided since maxing is my ultimate goal might as well blast through crafting to 99 for the teleport to increase my astral xp/profit by a good amount.  Astral prices seem to be crashing.  At what price point is it no longer worth to do Astrals from 91-99. thus switching to Natures?
---
I hate agility too, but I made it more interesting with agility-alching. Mining on the other hand... 
---
How is it not worth it? 
---
Because smoke devils come after brutal blacks right? 
---
Just set it to hidden unless you honestly plan to anti-pk even right click only you can get skull tricked pretty easily
---
"Something something something hivemind sheep intellectual"
---
Eh, a lot of bosses have slayer req now. Kraken boss, Cerberus, Smoke devil boss,and the upcoming alchemical hydra boss who is supposedly going to be on the level of zulrah and vorkath for money making.
---
The alchemical hydra looks awesome, it just sucks you have to do 200-300 hours of slayer to actually fight him. I love afk skills on osrs, so my slayer is falling behind at a meager 81, whilst i have mid to high 90s combat skills from things like bursting, chinning, nmz, etc.
---
I‚Äôm confused. Why keep using a continuously trashed service if a better one exists?
---
Or are you under the impression the new wiki mods are going back and vandalizing the old one... bc that‚Äôs not the case at all 
---
I hope you're doing okay OP. I'm glad you're alive. I hope for your speedy recovery, and the dankest of Exp Gains. 
---
Absolutely, go for it.  Make sure to do as many quests as you can that will give you good XP.  The xp reward from certain quests are a lot more valuable earlier on.
---
You leveled your rc higher in f2p than I did in p2p lol. I stopped at 46 but used xp lamps from the museum and diary rewards to get it to like 65
---
I tried that and I‚Äôve not received a reply. It‚Äôs been over 3 week nowüòÇ been banned since 2012 I think it was.. would love to get back onto my old main for the memories. 
---
When it‚Äôs more profitable to make natures.
---
Make smithing great again.
---
There isn't even a blog post yet about warding, all the info we have is the basic introduction, a concept of it. How about waiting for more info on the skill prior to making hard decisions on what to vote for? 
---
Hurr durr RCing is easy with zeah, all you have to do is get 77 RCing... stfu with that nonsense. 
---
Blast furnace maybe. I just spent like 6m there over the last 2 days buying gold ore for 83 smithing on my Ironman. And there was lots of other people (both Ironman and normal accounts, many likely bots) buying ore too, and the fast restock allows for a high volume of sales.
---

Petition to be able to flair a post/comment with an S to stand for "Shutup Serene"

Natures will almost always be more profitable tho.  What you're using to determine whether or not its better is the opportunity cost of the extra 50-100 hrs Astrals saves you on your way to 99.

Well, I have obviously now switched to the new wiki, but let me just say that the above doesn't work...because I don't "open a google tab". I just open the new tab and type the phrase in the url bar which automatically searches for it on google because it's 2019 and we're all using Chrome.  
---
So yeah, using a site that is not the first choice in google search instead of a similar one that is, is a MAJOR pain in the ass.

read the new wiki...
---
Damn, only quest I havnt don‚Äôt yet lol. Thank you though. I was just reading they don‚Äôt sell for much anyway so I‚Äôm probably not gonna bother
---
This sub is about osrs. Rs3 has nothing to do with this
---
I mean the URL bar is a search engine bar. Sorry should have been clearer on my end, when I say a new google tab I meant just opening a blank tab w a search engine at the top which is the url bar.
---
Agreed. Agility makes me want to fuck a bag of dirty needles.

really easy way to find it - just add -fandom to your search terms so it skips fandom entirely.

For example 'desert treasure -fandom' gives you the .wiki sites straight away.

No faffing around with site: things, no adding things to your browser - literally just add a -fandom to it and bam, done.

I‚Äôd suggest if you have the quests completed to do afk Dharok at nmz. You get 130k+ xp an hour if your afk and you just need to click once a minute to reset your hp Regen. You also make if your willing to do it everyday 150k daily from your herb boxes. :)

This is one prob yeah. Sometimes I also just start taking them all with freeze as they spawn so he can't stack them, then when the freeze expires and they come to me I just start running them around.

Genuine question, have you heard of the mining and smithing rework? Do you think it‚Äôs good in concept and could potentially be ported to osrs?
---
So all the accounts with moderator privileges on the wikia have recently all been banned/had their powers revoked?
---
&gt;For a Pker that's nothing, for a btw that stings like hell.
---
soz forgot there's people that legit play mmorpgs alone.
---
You're a weird autistic neckbeard with repression issues. Mentally ill.

Tell Bonesy to add S0URDIES on osrs for me its a zero not a O.
---
No they don't. It's an mmo, competing for limited resources (eg dust devils) is a game mechanic. 
---
With a single exception, yes.
---
So many people on this (and the rs3 subreddit) assume that SEO is just telling google "make this rank higher than that". It is excessively more complicated than that and everyone who tells you differently is just trying to make an argument for the sake of it. 
---
Our Google rankings are improving all the time, and it is incredibly obvious on newer content released after October 2nd. It is literally just something that takes time because of the literal years of a head start our old platform had. The more people using the site definitely does help though. All the newer updates coming out definitely help as well.

What money-maker is better than 9M per hour?  As far as Im aware, there is no where else to ‚Äúbetter spend‚Äù those 30 seconds.  Even if there were, it is beyond minimal to tack on an extra 30 seconds at the end or beginning of whenever you play that day.  
---
Cannon was there long before he showed up
---
i'm in almost exactly the same boat, i tried actually training hunter one day and said fuggit i'll get 99 passively eventually
---
League itself? Fine. Not the best, not the worst. 
---
The changes to the rest of the entire game? Holy Saradomin it's amazing. Check it out. 
---
That would be an important detail to advertise then. Instead of just saying "use the new wikia, the old one is no longer being updated", you might consider saying "all of the moderators from the old wikia have been banned or removed from their positions - a new wiki has been made as a solution". In addition to that, I noticed that the new wiki has a dark mode. Is there a way you guys might be able to add an option for an "old mode" or "wikia mode" that has the same layout and skin as the old wikia? It's genuinely the only reason that I've been apprehensive about a switch.

I legit had a person advertising his going away party on world 301 while i was fishing in barbarian village(F2P at the time) about a week ago, got 2 gilded sets and a bunch of trimmed armor sets, it allowed me to sell most of that and buy a few bonds for skilling and quests.

So I am on what I suspect is the final step of my first master clue scroll and I got bombed with mine runite ore in full prospector. I just grinded mlm to 73 and I see that you can get ores 10 levels earlier from the blast mine. Will that count for the purposes of the clue scroll or no? Other than that would fastest be 82 with dragon pick?
---
Where are you chinning? You‚Äôre better off going for range accuracy and chinning at mm2 tunnels or skeleton monkeys, using protect prayers. 
---
lol if thats true then I start to believe you need to comfort a jmod phallus for pmod status that OP said
---
too fucking perfect LMAO
---
170m 77 - 99 on bloods.
---
Upvotes to left
---
Chaos druids iirc. They're also in edgeville dungeon in the lvl 2 wildy section 
---
Chinning on defensive is significantly faster, but it also will cost more money than training defence with melee because you will need more chins.
---
So it's up to you whether you value time or gp more. 
---
I got this drop 3 times while on road to 95 slayer i was shocked at the rng it had
---
Hospital wifi is amazing if you get on the right ssid, it only sucks if you're on the general patient with. Long term stayers should be able to get on the good one if they ask

It‚Äôs kinda good that you got these stats before coming to p2p. It‚Äôll be a lot easier now. Good stuff dude!

Which is the point of this thread :)

This brigading was bullshit months ago and still is. Mods had to step in it got so bad. And not one person learned a damn thing. Too many people are just shilling the wiki and justifying the brigading on the wikia. 
---
Wiki is still inferior in a lot of aspects. The fonting is super bad in comparison. For a mostly text based site that's not okay. People have a preference. So stop being a dick to the fandom mods and the players who use the wikia.
---
it's not about AFKing, it's just that you never get comfortable with the skill
---
3t4g Mining or Blackjacking for example aren't AFK at all but they're really damn consistent so you develop a natural rhythm for it that you can maintain.
---
If you like doing clues why don‚Äôt u like doing slayer, I love slayer cuz I get to do so many clue scrolls 
---
ardy rooftop &gt; zeah

Curious as to what your KC is?

Hello darkness126 my old friend.....
---
oh shit, no wonder they don't allow weapons and don't charge a fee!
---
I just unlocked double deaths/got 99 like four days ago and I‚Äôm too burnt out to even do an hour. Glad to see someone‚Äôs still got the spirit.
---
Pro-tip if you‚Äôre not; decant all of your stamina potions to 1 dose at the GE so you don‚Äôt have to sacrifice the pure essence inventory space, and toggle the ‚Äòdestroy empty vials‚Äô option at barbarian assault so it‚Äôs just a one-click.
---
10/10 reference
---
i just do it if i don‚Äôt wanna waste xp trying to find a team :/
---
only 70 atk, can't whip yet. I use a dragon scim and drag defender.
---
Yes they exist. Pures will always exist, if you wanna funnel a couple of mill getting high combat stats and experiencing virtually 0 content in the game outside of pking, go for it my man.
---
Alao the fastest xp is at lvl 23 with lavas, its a delicate balance. Rc is slow and used to be amazing gp ph but since they buffed pvm drops to private server levels 300k an hour is trash money
---
Now this is how to look at the world.
---
not even all the tiles smh
---
Lmao this is not what I need when I question why I play.
---
Were all like that guy in a bar meme, nobody in real life gives a fuck 
---
Because I don't know the exact xp rates for pre-99 you fucking idiot. Use your brain. Any mining method needs 99 for max xp. Why would you not be able to use this method to get to 99?
---
I just spit out my Pepsi LOL
---
Just a tip, for mage gear, Ancestral doesn't make that much of a difference, you're fine in just Vestments, Kodai is about the same as (Toxic) Staff of the Dead, the only major difference is that you can't get DEF XP. Imbued Heart doesn't really do anything either since it just increases accuracy marginally, like maybe 1% or something like that.
---
Everyone streamer/ youtuber was q random dude before
---
Yeah you're right. It's the RuneScape version of standard MMO quests. 
---
Slayer does have nice drops huh
---
I've not really trained a lot of my spells much, I stopped playing for like 11-12 years and started last month again
---
There are new skills, everything is so different 
---
Much of the original charm is still there though, I'm just enjoying the quests and exploring and shit
---
I will have to grind some day, today is not yet day
---
Thankfully the grinding is significantly easier now too.
---
Ah! That‚Äôs awesome thanks man
---
Lol
---
melee is more effective unless you have tbow, spectral helps alot too. If your going melee bring bludgeon, if not hasta
---
Are you taking into account the essence cost?
---
\[A\]
---
I looked up your stats and saw that you‚Äôve got a pretty good account! I‚Äôd skip going for a specific 99 and just go for the diary cape :).
---
Really sucks to hear about the injury :(. Hopefully you recover soon! Best wishes dude!
---
Im new and 30. Am I... Crazy?
---
What did you use to make this
---
Worth it if you want money.
---
He hits hard and will tear through your supplies, especially if you don't have a Spectral. He's a pretty unforgiving boss and will combo you out but isn't too complicated to learn. His drops are pretty mediocre except for Prims and Eternals.
---
So basically you just land every freeze right.
---
Pretty sure i get like 1:4 solid freeze
---
You'd want burst def unless you have no regard for money
---
glad i could help :)
---
My first ever 99. I don't know what it is but Hunter is so zen for me. I used to aim for 2k chins a day after level 90.
---
Do we even have new players anymore?
---
Yeaaahh.. It was 1-15 as far as I can remember.
---
 
---
Or maybe it was 1-20, as I really can't remember doing Draynor Agility Course.
---
No way! I may be done riding park for a while but there‚Äôs too much fun in snowboarding to give that up forever!
---
Doesn't hurt to go for it if you got nothing else going on and youre playing all the time anyways. 
---
Hunter is really only acceptable once you hit 80 and can do five traps.
---
You get free wifi in the hospital?
---
When I had a hospital stay nearly 2 years ago I had to pay to watch tv on a TINY tv in the corner of the room or pay for wifi access.
---
So instead I burnt through 10G of data on my phone in a week lol
---
Nah haha I‚Äôll have to look that up now though. I do have my accident on vid though 
---
Thanks for that info.  Realistically if astrals take 300 hrs to 99, theres no way you could completely take advantage of a big spike in prices/get screwed over by a drop.  Best to just pool them and sell them when it makes sense.
---
youtube does
---
Slayer is awful to train but the reward is pretty sweet. Being able to afk kill those slayer monsters gives good combat xp over time in addition to good money.
---
Or they know to put in periods.
---
abcde is also a.bcde and ab.cde and abc.de etc.
---
another important point you are missing is that you are probably dropping food for bones, which leaves you open to die either way without skulling. You can lose partial loot, looting bag, all your bones and d hide, and even an ammy of glory or ring of wealth. Some people log into runescape and do not have knowledge of these lures. If this is problematic of a concept to understand, especially players who are not experienced with click options and understanding the need to hide attack options, Then move on from the thread please lol.

Fishing for me. Have 99 fishing through pure afk. Only woodcutting is above 90 for my other stats and that will likely be my next 99.  I just afk a lot at school on mobile.

I will say that entangle almost literally never hits, if you are in fact trying to TB then entangle you will surely be out run and attacked by everything trying to get that entangle.

Also as an FYI, there is a setting to auto pause you skills after a certain amount of time (i have mine set to a minute) meaning even if you go afk you can still get fairly accurate xp/hr rates :)

What about the look of the new wiki? Is that still being worked on, or is it set in stone? I think that's my biggest complaint on why I don't want to switch. The new one looks significantly less oldschool-y, and feels much clunkier and harder to find what I'm looking for.

normal ones.
---
training magic with trident isnt viable trident gives shit xp. use fire wave+tome or flames of zammy+sotd or better yet go get ancients because youll get basically no xp maging with flames compared to bursting.
---
So tiny
---
If you unlocked the mm2 tunnels its like 700k exp/h.
---
You use like 1.8k red chins/h.
---
I assume you are at like 80 already.
---
So like 14h of chinning or 25k red chins needed. 
---
So like 40m
---
Chinning in mm1 tunnel is about half the speed so double price. 
---
All these numbers are from my head of when I did mm2 chinning. 
---
Its quite cheap at 4gp/exp and even cheaper than training with a blowpipe at sandcrabs for example.
---
So a pussy slayer in other words.
---
This
---
You're right, Holy shit.
---
That's awesome. I took an intro to game development class as an elective and had to use GIMP and I sucked at it, so props to you for making these in it haha
---
That's gonna happen until higher slayer lvl with her unfortunately. I blocked the common ones I hated doing (black demons until mm2, hellhounds, metal dragons etc...) Not exactly the efficiency block list but I enjoyed doing slayer more that way. 
---
this happens to me once in a while during sara kc

realistically, is mm2 doable with 75 range 70 def 77 pray?
---
I've been playing ironman entirely without wiki. I'm cheating a bit because I already know a lot from back in the day, but it makes quests and clue scrolls a lot more fun (usually).

i'm not looking for a reaction btw, i really just don't see it. 
---
it's like how criticizing Caitlyn Jenner for killing someone with her car is now considered transphobic...when that has nothing to do with the situation. that blows my mind.

Or Level 7 in Runecrafting
---
Ironmen salute you
---
Oh no, someone is making jokes about a cult of people who are 4% of the worlds population and who have a 48% suicide rate and love to act hysterical and hateful towards people. Every single transgender person acts like the one shown in the video because they are not normal and will NEVER be normal.
---
They promote self-harm to the youth and unstable individuals. I for one, will not cut a hole in myself like they do and nobody else should either. Get them the hell out of this society, by the looks of it they are getting themselves out.

good luck, if someone got banned with the name for rwting then its locked forever and cant be used. happened to the name ive been after.

You should edit your tree part with information from Kieren's tweet about rates of ultra since they're known. The wiki could use them as well.

Imagine what you could have learned or accomplished with the hours you spent on pixel parkour

&gt;it's like how criticizing Caitlyn Jenner for killing someone with her car is now considered transphobic

nobody in the LGBTQ community, especially the trans community, remotely likes caitlyn jenner and i have not once seen people talking about her [in good faith] being a murderer getting off scot-free as 'transphobic'

I feel like that'd be even more expensive than trident tho.

how is this tab 6m tho?

i see torches and tome of fire.  what else is sellable to make it 6m?

"You've been froezen"

Nice.
---
But feeling you are in the wrong 'sex' body is a mental illneas and it is called gender dysphoria and there is nothing wrong with calling it what it is (nor with having it).
---
The problem is that there is a stigma on talking about mental illness and it not being taken serious.
---
What we should do is consider mental illnesses the same and treat them as serious issues, just like we do with physical diseases. Not discuss whether something is a mental illness or not. 
---
Nice

You're right, the man in the video is delusional and messed up.

---
&gt; But feeling you are in the wrong 'sex' body is a mental illneas and it is called gender dysphoria
---
gender dysphoria was reclassified and hasn't been considered a mental illness for ~4-5 years, as per the DSM5- this is why they removed the word 'disorder' from 'gender dysphoria'. it's considered a medical condition and that's at least primarily so that insurance covers HRT or specific surgeries. 
---
&gt;The problem is that there is a stigma on talking about mental illness and it not being taken serious.
---
yes there is a stigma on mental illness. gender dysphoria however is not a mental illness and most modern science / psychiatry agrees with this premise in modern literature. 
---
&gt;What we should do is consider mental illnesses the same and treat them as serious issues, just like we do with physical diseases.
---
i agree.

cerberus is so damn annoying.  AARROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Be honest with me. Do you really think a gay pride event should be in a medieval fantasy game? It literally has no place.. It doesn't mean we hate homosexuals, it just doesn't make sense.
---
But you can't be whatever you want to be, that's not reality. And it only hurts themselves and the kids they adopt if they force them to mutilate themselves just like what they did to themselves. They are 4% of the population and they have a 48% suicide rate. Does that raise a red flag to you? Or are you just that ignorant.

itd be cheaper.

youll get legit like 25k an hour w trident at waterfiends, it has no base xp

This lure is about team capes too. If you are using a team cape, don't click it even if you have your attack options set to right click. They might even drop one or someone will give you one.

Shit, your holy right

good. Now grab a Coke

Just confirmed this isn‚Äôt his. He said his stack is now 6m. So ya got some work to do bud.

I‚Äôm not playing victim, I want to speak with a support person and there is no longer an email to contact and my appeal was denied. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I said that my account was comprised and I have since recovered it and reset the password. And I still got denied and I haven‚Äôt received any support from Jagex. Not very cool when I‚Äôve got a 12 year old account and it just gets perma muted with no chance for me to do anything. Been a paying member for over 6 years and can‚Äôt speak with any customer support? Feels bad man
---
I'm not sure tbh

I suggest your man gets an ardy cloak, but as long as he's enjoying himself.

How the fuck did you find this

I‚Äôd like a source on that statistic, and if anyone tries to force *any* view on their kids, it‚Äôs fucked up. So yeah, I agree that if they try to force their kids to be transgender, that‚Äôs insanely messed up...but they don‚Äôt do that. The amount of fear mongering and hate of this group has lead to so many assumptions and it just sickens me to see it.
---
Actually it‚Äôs hurrassment and bullying. 
---
Literally reposting everyones memes from an hour ago for karma...
---
Listen my dude, as a transgender person Im going to have to stop you right there. Please dont pretend to give a fuck about trans people just to use it as a mallet to be transphobic. Its **very** obvious and incredibly sickening.
---
How good is that tbow there? Better than acb? 
---
literal impotent rage
---
You realize it is not the admins that are sabotaging the old website, right? The admins left and started  new ones, gave good reasons for doing so, then users who thought those reasons were good decided to punish the owners of the old wiki by vandalism.
---
Anything else is just conspiracy theories. 
---
Agility is the worst because it's not afkable. I've gotten to 92 RC doing bloods so far, majority of the time at work on mobile. I can do my job and get 6k bloods inefficiently while doing so. You can't afk agility, which is why it'll be my least favourite on my way to 99, cause I'll have to be at my PC getting it.
---
Lets say he did 90-99 with Air staves, he would need to make 55,914 Air staves. Each Bstaff is selling for 8100 ea currently, that alone is 452m, Each Air Orb is selling for 1,550gp ea, needing 55,914 that equals to 87m roughly. Where do U get 50m from? Its more like 540m. Lol
---
nice
---
*eye roll* did you come up with that one on your own love? Or did you hear it in a Ben Shapiro video and vomit it back at us? Either way, its incorrect on a medical and scientific level, and not even correct about the LGBT movement considering its LGBTQ+ to include other sexualities and identities. But okay.
---
Get into hetb runs, with ranarrs I easily make 100k per run. Do this 2/3 times a day equals 300k per day. Varrock diaries for staffs from Zaff. Managing Miscellania is something like 50k anday for minimal effort after the quest series. So if you just decide to soend one month on getting going its easily doable.

You‚Äôve done really well there man! You did them quite quickly too!

What you see as ‚Äúdestroying their lives‚Äù is seen as major improvement for them. I think it‚Äôs best if you stay out of other people‚Äôs business.
---
nah, gender is a spectrum and non binary people exist, along with 'third gender' people existing in multiple cultures throughout the world, such as two-spirit aboriginals, indian hijras, polynesian fa'afafine's, albanian sworn virgins, waria's in indonesia, muxe's in southern mexico, etc. 
---
Thats the funniest part. People accused of being transphobic are usually being transphobic, and you can always very easily tell by their follow up. Its almost never "Oh dang sorry, maybe it could be seen that way" its "WELL IM NOT TRANSPHOBIC BUT WHY DICK CUT OFF?!?!"
---
It would be funny if it wasnt so depressing.

That‚Äôs the spirit! Free riding is better because if you fall you just look for the nearest pillow. Where were you riding?

Oh wow it was featured on Alt right shows? Wow! Maybe the person filming planned the whole thing to make trans people look bad! Oh wait, you retards manage to do that all by yourselves. Victim mentality! 
---
So unfortunate and yet hilarious. ..bravo
---
How is it incorrect scientifically and medically? I'm desperately awaiting your response.
---
When you have 'bisexual' in your acronym it implies there are two genders... Which there are.. And science agrees with me.
---
just stay there and and spite him lol
---
I've banked my equipment every time I log off since 2011 when I got hacked the day after free trade came back. I learned that lesson a long time ago.
---
modern science and psychiatry disagrees with you. gender dysphoria was reclassified from being a mental illness to a medical condition almost half a decade with you.
---
why do you disagree with modern science akin to a climate change denier, flat earther, anti vaxxer, or 9/11 truther? 
---
From the studies I‚Äôve read the suicide rate of ~50% remains unchanged post-transition. That is a higher than the suicide rate of jewish people in Nazi Germany.
---
ikr?
---
I don't understand why we make fun of people for doing what makes them happy. Empathy is a powerful tool that we can learn; even I am guilty of lacking empathy sometimes, but we still should stop and think about what is the right things to say and do are. 
---
I just let the guy collect the dust devils and barrage them with 2 maxed accs. They eventually hop lmao
---
Its incorrect because there are exceptions in sexuality, and exceptions in gender. Medically documented divergence isnt anything new. Not to mention gender is not the same as sex, and it doesnt even surprise me slightly that you have no idea even the basics of what you are talking about.
---
Ok so this is how you deal with it I‚Äôve been perma muted since 2008 just make a alt account that can run cannonballs and you join a cc and talk through it and it talk within discord... you shouldn‚Äôt quit, it is truly a pain a lot of the time but you‚Äôll get use to it like I have. 
---
Fuck laughing at a person who threw a tantrum at a child in an EB games of all places
---
Shut up serene.
---
The only person who's even close to bullying anyone here is you. Just because sources come from something you don't agree with, doesn't mean its false. Suicide rates of non-trans gendered people internationally is 15-20%. Suicide rates of trans gendered people internationally ranges from 32-50% (bigger differential, but factors include your country of residence, age, treatment, etc.). These are taken from the National Library of Medicine and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, you can read if you'd like. It's not attacking or bullying to state facts and try to get people help who need it. You being ignorant is what does hurt these people though. I'm sorry you feel you need to be so ignorant and hateful, I wish you luck in life.
---
Then I‚Äôll have to pay for membership for two accounts lol and I always have to be logged into two and will make a huge difference. Everyone keeps telling me to join discords, what discord do I join to be able to talk to random osrs players?
---
&gt;playing runescape

which im sure is definitely the reason the community was against it, right? definitely no people doing the closest impression of klansmen outfits rioting in game? hm. right.
---
You‚Äôre going to have to drop and telegrab 6 capes every time you get a new 99
---
I'd have to say account one because the extra range level plus usage of blowpipe outweigh rigour and blowpipe spec helps you heal some of the extra damage you get from lack of defence. And possible twisted bow makes jad himself a cakewalk
---
Though i have never done fight caves at one defence so i could be miss judging it. 
---
oh yeah don't telegrab. Get robes of zamorak and go up the ladder. You lose the magic levels temporarily btw.
---
Damn running laws and nats for cash... Takes me back to when I was a kid playing this game. 
---
Well... Guess it's. Time to stop browsing Reddit today &gt;&lt;

I never claimed to speak for everyone else, I‚Äôm claiming for myself. I hope you can understand that I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick to you and that I am offering the perspective of someone who didn‚Äôt like the event but wasn‚Äôt rioting about it.

I‚Äôve been there! I go to school up there but unfortunately I‚Äôve had an Achilles injury and I am unable to partake in the snow sports this year. Hope you get better dude enjoy grinding for 99 while you‚Äôre at it!

you can do whatever you want mate, but tridenting them is really just throwing money down the drain.. maybe melee them and splash rats or whatever i bet that would be more efficient
---
So pointless 
---
How can you be so bad at maths. You're right with the amount of Battlestaffs. Current osbuddy prices are 8077+1544 = 9621 gp per battlestaff. Each air battlestaff sells for 9020gp each. 9650 - 9020 = 601gp cost per battlestaff. Each battlestaff gives 137.5xp so 630/137.5 = 4.37gp/xp. Assuming that's the cost all the way to 99 it will cost 57m.
---
I mean sure but if you‚Äôre avoiding all members music tracks you‚Äôll have to miss out on a ton of content that would speed up xp gains. So you may as well just stay in f2p.

How so? In my college experience most STEM majors lean more conservative than non stem majors. I'd like to think you would agree that you need to be much more intelligent to get a STEM degree than a liberal arts degree. In this day and age, having a degree doesn't mean your educated.

After you unlock all major slayer items like herb sack, slayer helm and so on points are only used to skip/block...if you were able to cancel a task streak at the same slayer master you could litteraly cancel non stop every time untill whatever task you want...every player would do this after finishing unlocks as you wont need points anymore

---
I'm pregnant and bedridden per drs orders, going for 99 agility! Already to 90 lol. 
---
Because there's no point to hiding it, and if you have it hidden you may forget about it and not be able to attack someone when you need to. You can't misclick and get skulled like you could with left-click attack, so the only way you get skulled is if you actively decide to take that risk.
---
Congrats two years of your life and only this picture to show think about that. Take this as constructive criticism

You're a beast. Hope all goes well from here and that you find happiness in all the small things in this game we call life. 99 STR simply because, you're a beast. Much love and positive vibes.

It really isn't time to stop sexual innuendo memes are quite comedic to be honest. They always give my belly a good rumble or two. But speaking of smelly holes I had sex with beutiful transwomen recently and my word I don't think I ever want to go back to taco Tuesday after that experience.
---
I was unaware that it went past 20k per hour so my mistake
---
I guess ur going to be reported as well. 
---
Just quit the fucking game man 
---
So you made like 2m, lol
---
Probably more to do with the fact that it could make getting those tools the meta, people right now are against chasing a few penguins around once a week for a bit of xp because they feel like they would be "forced" to, people would definitely cry about this no matter how good the minigame is.

SC was one of the better minigames imo. Got 99 crafting/con thanks to it. Those 'friendly' worlds/cc were awesome where everyone would just grind for max points.

Im kind of in a struggle atm, cause my real friends dont Play runescape and the friends i made through the clan i play in live in different timezones which means i can only do tob with them on vacations. I am on 3kc atm, which i know is basically nothing, but i am very confident in every room, except some stupid deaths at bloat e. g. or sometimes the nylocas room is a bit messy. And ofc the last 20% of verzik is pretty tough for me as i have only been there twice, once planked at the very beginnign of the 20% and once on 5%. i guess ill jsut have to figure smth out.

Spined Kebbits around 26 hunter I believe near Eagles Peak - you can bring a chisel and grind their spikes into a stackable 500gp item. You can also bring a bird trap and a butterfly net and a few jars to get around 30k xp/hr.
---
it's click intensive but you can trap red ruby butterflies in their spawn points and make it real easy on yourself.
---
For levels 1-9, do the quiz in the basement of the Varrock musuem. Then you can use bird traps on whatever the highest level birds you can do are until you reach the aforementioned level 28. 
---
After you hit level 44 you can start falcon hunting spotted kebbits - buy a piscatoris tp from the GE, it takes you right there. Just need 500gp to get started and its really easy xp. Can do this to 53, and then do Orange Desert Lizards to 63, at which point you can basically start red chins which you do to 99. Unless you want to catch black chins in the wild which is risky. I just bring vengeance and a dark bow spec weapon for if someone fucks with me, but if you can't do combat just stick to reds.
---
Oh and don't forget to do the Bone Voyage quest asap. It gives access to 4 birdhouses which you can fill every 50 minutes and get around 4kish xp per hour doing in between whatever else you are doing, even non-hunter shit. They net you birds nests and seeds and jewelry, giving consistent income as well.
---
overall it is quite profitable and enjoyable to do.

you're getting the math wrong, 1 devided by 10\*10\*10\*10\*10, 1 devided by 100000 is 0,00001, a 0,001% chance if im correct
---
It does work, unless you have video proof I doubt it.
---
Never happend to me before but maybe try to clear cookies.

100000 / 1 = 100000. 1 / 100000 = 0.00001

I think one of the issues with group iron man is alt accounts. What‚Äôs stopping you from making an iron man with 3 alts to get the easy stuff out of the way?
---
They bite (melee) if you run near them
---
Whichever you prefer, there is no best.  The only advantage of the smaller fixed size window is less mouse movement for repetitive skills.
---
Yeah because I made it through the entire wave without touching my prayer. If I wasn't praying magic I would have 100% died earlier.
---
Crucial to distinguish between the games to assert which game's preferred. Especially since rs3 posts occasionally ends up here.

If you want more money you shouldn't be using a blowpipe. The dhide just makes you a bit more accurate so you'll kill them a little quicker.

Almost all mammals take 21 seconds to completely empty their bladder. Larger ones have larger bladders, but also larger urethrae, whereas smaller mammal have tiny bladders with a tiny, narrow urethrae. This means it balances out to be a constant 21 seconds for almost every example (with the exception of tiny field mice that don't have a proper bladder to begin with). This even has a name; the Universal Law of Urination.
---
He's totally correct these days. Jad was a challenge like 10+ years ago, if you were twelve. Now it's essentially become the equivalent of killing goblins. Time's shifted.

The (chance to get each individually multiplied together) bit of what he said is less than one as it's a probability. He's done 1 divided by that, hence it is larger than 1. It's not 1 divided by 10\*10\*10\*10\*10, it's 1 divided by 1/10 \* 1/10 \* 1/10 \* 1/10 \* 1/10.

By someone logging into your account obviously.  There's a million ways you could've been hacked so pretty hard to say without more information, at a minimum, you should scan your PC, change all account info on another device such as your phone, and link the account to a brand new email linked with nothing else, and with a password you use nowhere else, lastly enabling authenticator.

Even without changing attack options if you just right clicked to pick up bones instead of troglodyte spamming them you wouldn't get skulled.

I don't know but - the people I talk to frequently discuss the game with me and we talk about what we are doing and how exactly we are doing it. It's enjoyable and lets you learn something from someone who has experience doing it instead of always relying on a guide while maintaining a sense of community. 
---
It also makes it easy to find partners for Revs or PvM opportunities or PKing or whatever. I wouldn't want to play this game WITHOUT my friends that I talk to.
---
U can get 3250 charges for little effort if u do morytania hard diary

I think that's actually against the ToS. I do remember price manipulation being illegal.

I have found almost the exact opposite but I‚Äôm thinking the base rolls may differ with a higher chance because of the 3 level superiority

Are you talking about slayermusiq1 or about yourself being insanely tired of being told to shut the fuck up?

I finally did Jad for the second time on task yesterday. I messed up on the healers and misclicked pray twice and still managed to kill him after having to deal with the healers 3 times. Still had half an inven of supplies. I wasn‚Äôt happy I got kinda lucky with the missed prayers but it wasn‚Äôt ranged so I was good. Now I‚Äôve got a nice cape to display at my house too lol. Already had a cape and still got some jitters from Jad though.

Well played

Hey jogglebox make so each rune you craft give more xp so air rune rc is 50 xp/ess, I know balancing more than anyone else.

Runecrafting is  Good one to train while you have no otherchoice but to play, then you can keep the more enjoyable skills for once you're better.
---
Get well soon my dude 
---
It's almost zero maintenace required, low intensity. Get used to the course and you'll be able to complete every lap by barely watching the screen, via muscle memory. One of the easier skills in the games if you lay aside the xp rates.
---
It was honestly a creative way to have skilling work in PvP. I'm no good at runescape PvP, but Stealing Creation definitely took some hours from my life I don't want back. 
---
To all the people obsessed with Slayermusiq1, I‚Äôd urge you to give [n0thinglasts1‚Äôs quick quest guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE3qHw_qR1wHrJlNvSY-41YyDVthWa4Sq) a shot. His warning in the beginning is legit - if you are new to the game and need help with the basics, these guides are not for you. But if you want to complete quests as fast as humanly possible and you understand the game mechanics well, there is nothing better.
---
I guess i‚Äôm in the minority, but i tried out slayermusiq1 a few times (after primarily using n0thinglasts1‚Äôs) and felt like his guides dragged on at a snails pace. Meanwhile, n0thinglasts1‚Äôd guides are blazing fast and it‚Äôs really fun to try to stick to his pace. As an example, i just did darkness of hallowvale in 32 mins with his guide while slayermusiq1‚Äôs guide is 54 mins. Always been disappointed that people don‚Äôt seem to know about his guides.
---
These better be Minecraft sprites

SC Hammers for 99 construction, literally halved the cost of it.
---
Yaaaas!
---
They're upset about post frequency and some opinions. Bias at its peak.
---
Tbow crashes noobs with dhcb pretty hard. Can also be crashed by somebody using an alt to bring better gear up.
---
At least you're already half way to 99
---
I was thinking this too lol
---
Man you should do a guide, im on a ranged run right now but after ill do magic. congrats!

Glad you're at least useful for something right Serene?

This is all I played back then, absolutely love the mini game.

and wtf does that have to do with quest cape? clickbait
---
Still fucked me over with MM2

complaining about rc gets attention

Indeed, classic lmao

It would indeed; if that option was available to us, we would definitely have went through and have it shutdown.
---
Unfortunately, the staff (not admins, that‚Äôs us; or rather, was us until they removed our admin tools) who host the site still make a ton of ad revenue off the corpse of our hard work over the years, as they do with all the Wikis they host.
---
They don‚Äôt care what happens to it until someone goes off on a vandalism spree that would harm their precious ad revenue.
---
I grinded the shit out of this game, think I got well over 200 hammers for Construction

I did this the other day, panicked and flicked on redemption, felt like a baddass. Until my absorbs ran out 3 seconds later...

Agility isn‚Äôt afk though lol.
---
What RSN did you have back when you maxed originally?
---
With the gays, you would have the same sex in the same room. With the trans, you would have different sexes in the same bathroom (not: I said sex, not gender). With a transwoman, you could have a sitch where a recently transitioned pre-op dude will be dabbing on the women in their restroom. And "she" also happens to be a lesbian. What a shocker?

Runelite calculates Graceful sets based on their potential value had you traded the marks for Amylase instead. It isn't technically worth that much because you can't resell it.
---
Also Tome.

&gt; Most of them get really excruciatingly slow the higher you go.
---
Don't fucking play a grindy game if you don't want to grind lmao, minecraft sounds like the game for you
---
Higher level herbs actually die at a higher rate, I believe. This is determined by your farming level though. I believe for xp, people usually farm herbs at least one lower than they are capable of planting because you get too much death if you do the best one you can do. I don't do a lot of farming though so that may not be the right way to do it, it's just what I've heard. 
---
Marks of grace is the passive money maker. Compared with the afk nature of Agility, you should be able to play an alt and maximize profits if that's the goal. Great skill, easy to keep up. Gl.

Ohhh yeah I think I recall that. I noticed the mistake when it happened so it wasn‚Äôt an issue, but that sucks anyway.

What were you trying to do when you broke your neck? A fucking backflip or something?

i dont see why she wouldn't assign black demons
---
A 70k split is assuming the pker lost 700k lol. If he had lost 5m that would be a 500k split but that's not to common. Not worth it for money per hour. Either only the over level clan leaders are getting kills and not splitting or they're just there for the fun of it and the loot doesn't really matter. I've found the latter in my experience with clans.
---
Why wont they? I've stopped playing OSRS (for now) but for sure if they brought back stealing creation I'd start playing again right away. I didn't even care about the rewards, I loved the minigame.

How much xp/hour do you get? I was only getting about 20k at level 65 :(

Buy all the tools required (rake, spade, seed dibber etc) and start by raking weeds off any patch.
---
Use seeds on weedless farming patches, Level 1 only allows you to plant Potatoes but it levels quickly.
---
Potatoes and other veg can only be planted in allotment patches, the most notable being behind Catherby Bank.

You could also train hunter and farming simultaneously with the vinesweeper mini game but I'd reccomend looking it up if interested as I've never played it myself

I'll go try that right now thanks for the tips

Your ISP is blocked in the school?

I think you mean that your school has a filters that blocks OSRS?

You could use your mobile data, since OSRS uses next to nothing. (When the cache / assets are up-to-date)  
---
Another is option is that could use a VPN, I'd recommend PIA (Private internet access, it costs money, but it's worth it)

They did eventually crack down on it on the initial flood of vandalism right after the admins moved to the new wiki. Seems they have forgotten though.

Can be done with 40 prayer and like 20 magic, its not a very dangerous quest.

Holy damn I've been trying to remember what fist of guthix was called for the longest time

Rigour is worth af and helps everywhere. Assembler if you don't have it
---
Smithing is fairly fast and makes a lot of money now, though. Blast Furnace for steel bars is like ~1m GP/h and like ~150k xp/h?
---
Good advice, that was my train of thought as well. I don't have a whole lot diaries done. So that and fire cape... Eventually
---
all green dragon stuff are profitable and will buy 300gp below alch price. price of nature runes fluctuates 240-280. Buy lots of nature runes when they are 250 or below and start alching.
---
If you buy gold bars and smelt into gold necklace, you can alch that for minimal loss. If you can take 40gp loss, then just buy the necklace straight up
---
&gt; What about the medical uses of marijuana?
---
Separate question. If it's proven to work medically for a necessary recovery of a patient, sure. Nobody really objects to prescriptions and medically motivated decisions.
---
&gt;And the fact it causes less harm than alcohol and tobacco?
---
Not an argument, all of these drugs are harmful and should be prohibited in any civilized nation. Just because there's existing damaging products in a society, doesn't warrant more destructive substances being legalized.
---
&gt;And the terrible under ground market it supports by being illegal?
---
Black markets should be eradicated by the appropriate authoritites, by subsidizing enough resources to these institutions.
---
&gt;And all the tax we could put on this substance?
---
Doesn't make up for all the risks and horrible results of  accepting drugs. Not worth it for the nation whatsoever.

Do fairytale part 1. Begin fairytale part 2 get fairy rings. Then train farming to 32 and begin farming ranrarr with ultra compost averages to about 100k gp/hr and the best part is that it only takes 10 minutes to plant and pick your herb. So you basically make 100k gp/hr for 10 minutes of work. I personally tried a lot of different methods and this was the best for me 
---
Last I heard it was like 200-300k per hour. So the first 10 hours every 2 weeks pay off the bond. Not too much profit. Gargs, BBD, or rune dragons are much better
---
According to wiki, at +80 hunter you get 140-150k xp ph if you do the tick trick, which I am doing and I'm almost 90, but I'm only getting 120k xp ph at best, so... are wiki's numbers busted or I'm doing something wrong?

The thing is that if the default client runs choppy the third party clients are not just the preferred ones, they‚Äôre the only ones that run decent. That is quite a different thing from a few basic toolkit options, i think.

Just get a butt pad to hide under your bibs and always fall on your ass. Snowboarding is a lot harder to learn than skiing but once you get the hang of it its much more versitile and fun. Another tip, if you're using a "beginner board" like the burton ones you see at a lot of rental shops, stop using those. Theyre really thick and it makes handling super tough and are more difficult to learn on imo. Good luck and stay safe. Also, helmets are nice if conditions are icey.

Edgeville üòÇ. I knew most of the game world pretty well, but then a friend of mine took me to a ‚Äúsecret city‚Äù north of the barbarian village. I guess since there was no path leading to it, I didn‚Äôt bother checking out what was north of it.
---
Get out.
---
I actually got really good at math from Runescape when I was a small kid. Addition subtraction multiplication and division I was great at compared to my classmates. Also typing.
---
Not really, just putting people who issues targeted harassment in their rightful place. Not tolerated.
---
Aren't Pmods player moderators, the ones with the silver crowns that aren't employed by jagex?
---
Then you realise they just texting their other phone.
---
I gotta ask did you kill him accurately or rapidly?
---
I really fucking loved that minigame. The english-illitrrate 12yo me didn't know shit so when I saw someone getting barraged j thought it was clay
---
Shut up, Serene. 
---
Never got why people watch guides, the written quick guides are all you need.
---
Damn she's even taking the trouble to research which books the classes need herself instead of just asking OP for the titles
---
Alright then 
---
Wow, edgy! This applies to every user...on this website! 
---
You should get defence xp when you say "legit" after "doubling".  /s
---
And unobtainable.
---
Hmm that sounds correct.
---
Are you picking the traps up on the square they're located or the square next to it? 
---
Correct. There's tons of healthy entertaining aspects in life. Cherish them!
---
He has ads in his videos. Maybe not all of them but there's like seven in his monkey madness guide. I used that one less than five hours ago.
---
If you introduce your kids to mmorpg's, his life will be ruined
---
Any sort of bot or anything other than you playing yourself with a mouse and keyboard (or mobile phone screen now, I suppose) is against the rules and a bannable offence. Jmods and other players do not take botting lightly, so just train yourself. 
---
I was a scammer on RS, now I scam full time IRL! Thanks runescape!
---
Ps. If you want me to double your paypal account just send me your login info
---
Don't know who downvoted you, but you're right. The fastest RC methods, lava runes (70k xp/hr) and paying for runners at Ourania (150k xp/hr), both cost money a lot.
---
Zdzz
---
&gt;I always wondered why people downvote you to oblivion, now I've just experienced it first hand.
---
This is happening due to a harassment campaign, which you just defended here. People issuing threats, harassment, incitements of violence and similar notions. Absolutely ridiculous.
---
If you are really broke go loot rev caves(You an try pvp and edgeville bh but usually to many looters now a days). I did it early on and was making like 200k per hour in supplies. Do it for 2 hours and you will be able to get melee and range gear
---
To Day
---
Just click on that tree and watch the magic happen.
---
It was a bad experience. Losing a big goal you made like that is killer; the cost doesn't matter.
---
You sound like a robot 
---
Don‚Äôt use logic against these PvMrs
---
Should of done a T pose and tele'd
---
I always try to walk on top of them before picking them up then 3 tick it, although I'm kind of not consistend with doing that, like 7 of 10 times I get it
---
Idk why you'd ever make them on your main. It doesn't matter if you sell or use them, its still profiting/saving you the same about of gp
---
Oak doors are currently cheaper than mounted myth capes and around 500k xp/hr
---
Ooh, gotcha! Yeah you could do that, my Twitter is @TimeLierG. I appreciate it!
---
I hate rc hella hard but just bite through it, theres no way round it and it sucks
---
Lol I tried first time yesterday and died on wave 32
---
Don't respond ever again, pig.
---
This is a great opportunity for you to make your great escape from the clutches of runescape and invisible gains. You're blessed!
---
Lol the new wiki is getting desperate, barely anybody is using it. Wikia still has all the top links on google. I hate the new wikis layout.

I don't think there is a medicine for autism /s
---
Well, have a terrible year then, pig
---
Adam and Eve aren‚Äôt relatives, how is that incest?
---
Wouldn't that be why? 80% of 150k is around 120k xp/hr. 
---
That being said, I'm can't say for sure if the xp/hr is correct but it seems to fall inline if you aren't consistent with the method?
---
I‚Äôll take that into consideration, but if the skill is fun and I enjoy doing what the other guy said then I probably won‚Äôt be doing much of birdhouses. Especially since I heard they got nerfed quite badly. 
---
No, I've experienced this firsthand. Having issues with Jad if you're invested and knowledgeable is..strange. Especially if  you're an adult. 
---
What's the objection?
---
Well jokes on you, 2019 is the year of the pig and all pigs shall have good times whether you like it or not
---
Slayermusiq got me my quest cape :)
---
About a week from 94, and about 2 and a half weeks total from 93-95. Slayer was my main focus these weeks.
---
Is that Lynx Titan??
---
* I Applause those who gets it *
---
I mean I enjoy rs but I have to be doing something else while playing it, unfortunately. Almost maxed though so I can quit soon !

Get lost with that condescending bratty attitude. This isn't supposed to be an edgy preschool. Strange how I've even agreed with you in the past if this is how you behave towards others.

whilst I do agree with you on that, I dont really get people who do it at the wildy altar. that just doesn't seem fun in any way.

I wouldn‚Äôt train using full Dharok, I would keep the fury, use a d scim with a dragon defender, then use Torag legs with fighter torso combo. D scim is good dps and is one of the best weapons to train strength. Work on fire cape if you haven‚Äôt got one already. I would train strength by doing slayer. Get some slayer levels in the process!
---
Yeah you shouldn't have any trouble with those stats at getting to jad. Do you take too long to kill the rangers or do you run out of food?
---
Get lost, pig. Stay on topic next time, it really isn't that hard.

you must be fun at parties

I've seen weird shit happening in public bathrooms. It is not out of the questions to see genitals in a bathroom filled with other people.
---
Well messing up still yields xp just a tad slower so 7/10 mess ups isn't 7/10 speed.
---
I've done the hunter method and at 99 with maximum tryhard i could reach 180 but during my more normal pace it would usualy drop down to 160-170.
---
Seems like op has a combination of small mess ups slightly lower level and perhaps not being at max tryhard ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I think he should give it a bit more time and maybe he'll get higher as he improves.

Regarding Hydras / Alchemical Hydra - 
---
* Has anyone been allowed to test these monsters yet / has any information been released about what it might take to kill one? Combat styles, weapons, etc.? Wondering what gear I should buy before their release on Thursday
---
* Do you need an Alchemical Hydra boss task to kill the Alchemical Hydra, or can you do so on a normal Hydra task?
---
Yeah, on my first trip out while learning I fell on my tailbone and bruised it pretty bad.  Quickly looked up solutions for that and landed on the Butt Shield.  I stuff that in my pants every time i go out and it really does help for those falls.  I more afraid of a broken ankle, leg, or wrist than a tailbone, honestly.  Just not looking forward to breaking anything for the first time, not that anyone would.  And i feel with snowboarding, it's not really a matter of if - more of when; doesn't seem to matter how good you are, all it takes is one little screw up while going 15-20mph downhill.
---
Also, regarding my board before I started I decided to invest in a few things.  Didn't go with Burton because I didn't care for their price gouging and proprietary technology that keeps you binded to that company for your future board/binding purchases if you ever wanted to try to reuse something in a new setup.  Instead, I bought the 2016 Arbor Foundation board.  It seemed to be the most well-rounded board for beginners, and would give me something reliable and flexible to keep using once i learned what i was doing(intermediate).  I like the board a lot, it made learning pretty easy.

I always wear a helmet.  Fuck not wearing one, i don't have a death wish.

What's that interface on Runelite? 
---
whenever I hear them address it on stream, they said they're not a fan of bringing content straight over from ds3, which I find a little strange considering how much stuff in osrs is just reskinned ds3 content but idk 
---
Put an Authenticator on your email account as well and not just your RS account
---
It depends. I've seen a ton of skulled kids risking less than 70k total lol.

 Saw an edited version on some shitty Facebook page yesterday. I don‚Äôt know who created it though https://www.facebook.com/2434750769933628/posts/2455873204488051/
---
70k+ xp per hour, 99 could be ticked in like two weeks. Or ~30k+ xp/h while gaining a decent amount of gp which should highly motivate the player in question. The dissent of RC is questionable, but not really surprising when the sub's flooded with new casual users who thinks they know what they're talking about.
---
or because he already accidentally made 3 pairs of pants
---
Honestly one of the most impressive if not most impressive hc since fuse/that other hc streamer that began doing tob runs. 
---
It‚Äôs few and far between to find hcs that actually play hardcore, well done sir. 
---
How about in the gym shower room? Everybody is naked in there. 
---
Looks like you are out of answers, that's why the label "troll". 
---
Wow insane luck. 
---
Kill yourself. Congrats
---
Not liking them is fine, But there's a lot of content you won't be able to do if you don't get the quest done. I don't know your end game goals, but not only will it get you 99 quicker doing the quests and then training, rather then training without it. It will unlock content for you. (Barrows Gloves, Pking, Inferno all require it. I also think you need it in Raids 2, not sure about raids 1,)
---
If you are trying to just get XP/profit i would take a trident up to Lava drags in the wild. They are SUPER low magic defense and it really won't matter if you die as the trident is protected. You will make at minimum 10k per kill (Lava Bones, D hide, Scale) and you get onyx bolt tips about 1 in every 15 kills which is 100k. You can also take a looting bag, which if you are good at logging out to not get pked, you make about 1m per hour. Plus way better xp then nechs
---
Hold the fuck up. Is your name seriously just "Skiller"?! Forget the rest of this post, *that's* the most impressive thing here.
---
Just did Contact! the other day using his guide and I laughed so much when he died in the caves
---
Go to twitch and be sure to join the "double exp active" channel from oldschool and click the link below the stream, then you got it

wait how the fuck do you get 9hp accounts?
---
Good luck :D
---
It really doesn‚Äôt take long to bank for most tasks, and I‚Äôm mostly doing bosses so I‚Äôm banking anyway for supplies. Also the whole point of the tab was so I could see how much I made, wouldn‚Äôt be the same with just coins, which I wasn‚Äôt keeping track of anyway.
---
I have not bought one single book in 6 years of studying geoscience. I lend maybe two or three books from the library in that time. Every paper is online anyway so no books ever needed.

I actually remember seeing you in catacombs one time and thinking that's a ballsy name for a game with so many edgelords

This post made me laugh.

I was planning to go to barrows once I got my stats to 70 to use the pieces, but realized they degrade pretty fast. Are Barrows best in slot (aside from the really rare items), or is there some other armour I should be trying to obtain at ~70 combat stats?
---
I have my price. (Pssst, quests are buyable as well)
---
Didn't want to make a new comment for such a small question so just wanted to ask when/if wintertodt goes? Thank you.

Fucking lol. There seems to be no way you can get any upvotes in this sub Serene.

Making bowstrings. Not bad money for how little work is needee
---
Is this with Kara hard?
---
For your second point i'm 90% sure it's the same task as that's how every slayer boss works
---
Smoke devil task - &gt; thermy
---
Kraken task - &gt; cave kraken
---
Gargoyles task - &gt; grotesque
---
Etc. 
---
Exactly this..
---
A clear combination of targeted harassment, depraved hatred, insults, threats, and incitemts of violence every time I submit something isn't "just a meme", no. That's bullying and absolutely pathetic. Nothing I endorse. Anyone who promotes or indulges in this are part of the lowest-of-the-low.
---
What are u grinding
---
For real... I'm 1100 total on my pure with 30kc at barrows. Plan to do more bosses later just for fun
---
Have you ever wondered why everyone acts like that towards you though? Every comment you leave is condescending as fuck and everyone notices. 
---
Like we get you play this game a lot and probably know quite a bit about it but there‚Äôs no need to be such a dick all the time. Lighten up a little dude. I‚Äôve actually seen you leave normal, helpful comments and people weren‚Äôt shitty towards you. But when you leave douchebag comments at like 90% of what you say people are going to notice that you‚Äôre a dick. 
---
/r/gatekeeping

really poor gatekeeping at that

No, you seemingly not regretting the tattoos. Maybe they're all hidden enough and not cared about that much, idk.
---
I could understand deeply meaningful small tattoos engraved in a very obscure place, resembling one's occupation, loved ones etc.

I mean if you‚Äôre pking you ain‚Äôt really concerned with money/hr. The only time a pker ever splits is when he‚Äôs part of a mace/bgs team or lands a phenomenal tb

I dont really cared much if it was unbanned or not, just wanted to check out my old char, but its np Osrs is best mmo right now for me :) ty
---
Biggest perk of birdhouses:
---
It takes about 2 minutes for a run. Easy to get to and do in between other tasks. (finish a slayer assignment, between quests, etc). It's just supplemental passive xp and still brings in an okay profit. 
---
Only on RS3, rs classic had 1k hp xp at lvl 10, when the game moved to RS2, if you didnt get much hp xp, you had 9hp.
---
I had an account that had 9hp, forgot the password and jagex won't let me recover it, AMA.

What does RWT mean?

Serious question, what was it like at first?

Dude me too!

Runecrafting so you can make your own law runes

I might, honestly, but $11 a month somehow feels much worse than $5 - especially when I know it's *possible* to do it without spending a dime.

Top players, players who are famous for dominating the pk/pvm scene could arguably be considered as one. I'd consider B0aty to be pretty professional.

Speaking of which, check out f2p pvp Lumby. There's a bot that's currently getting a spade and banking it back and forth, it's hilarious.

I just used his Regicide guide this past weekend, and he got so frustrated with going through the Underground Pass the second time because he kept falling before Ibans temple. I felt so bad for him, but it was hilarious when he yelled "FUCK."

No, disgrace.

I use it for cave horrors and troll tasks thats about it
---
I mean, doesn't have arma+ancestral so not max gear. 
---
We don't need a bunch of random new tiers of armor that don't do anything just to fill space.
---
Holy shit I didn't know I had so many fuckboi brothers out there.
---
Good stuff 
---
Don't forget the hc who got calisto pet and the guy who done all wildy diaries
---
What do you mean "goes"?
---
There are a few Wintertodt themed worlds. Hop into one of them and just go through the doors and you'll be in the Wintertodt fight with everyone else there. Whenever I go there I just walk right on in. The games only take a few minutes, so I might not get full points for the first one (you need 500 points for a rewards crate and big XP drop at the end of the game), but that's only a minor loss. Your best bet is to just jump on in! Don't forget to spam "Why fletch" in chat and you'll be a seasoned pro in no time :) 
---
Some people will also do solo games (I think this takes about an hour) but I've never done it. 
---
Dying is always a bad experience. Rebuild and continue on. Shit like this happens every day to the average person. But the average person picks themselves up, dusts themselves off, and keeps on trucking. I see no reason to quit over 1 bad experience.
---
When I decided I needed Barrows Gloves I managed to get through all of the separate parts, got to the fights... Totally forgot about those 175 QP's. Was so close to flipping the desk. Was only at around 125ish.   
---
Realised that there were a few high QP quests I hadn't touched like Romeo and Juliet and Goblin Diplomacy as I just hadn't needed anything from them. 
---
Still took me around 3 weeks to get those QP's what with work.   
---
Good job getting them done bro. 
---
No, disgrace. Can't believe how users are enabling and encouraging these aggressive notions and "people" on this website. Ridiculous.
---
I got mine at 14.5m xp from seaweed(only did seaweed/herb patches post 99). Keep at it.
---
- cactus are the same base rate as seaweed i believe?

you could train your combat in nmz and get a shitload of points to get herb boxes everyday
---
now who's laughing now

I didn't know armor affected offensive bonuses. I was that idiot splashing wind bolt on the greater demon in wizard's tower in full rune and green dhide...

Hello! I'm trying to complete Dragon Slayer on my account and I'm not sure whether I should fight Elvarg with melee or range. From what I've read on the wiki, Elvarg's magic attack is higher than her melee, and my defense should be high enough for me to do melee against her.
---
My stats are below. I haven't played a lot of video games and this is my first real "boss" so I think I'm overthinking this! Any help or thoughts would be appreciated!

smoke staff can help save 10m in rune cost. but splasing is too slow and takes 4 month/8 bond/32m
---
Yeah I think the armor is the tricky part too, but if I understand correctly their real goal is just to allow for smoother progression while training smithing. So they fill space as far as armor is concerned, but they are useful as far as smithing is.
---
I also think the official updated mentioned some uses for the highest armors (I think non combat)
---
unironically you are a waste of oxygen
---
all you do is make loud noise and consume resources, you may as well be a fucking raccoon. at least they're cute.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ourania_Altar
---
I mean you could. But you're way better off just power cutting, dropping the logs, and making faster gp/hr in some other way later on. 
---
Another option is to Fletch as you chop. Keep a knife with you, chop an inventory, Fletch it up, bank, repeat. But I'd still recommend just dropping tbh.
---
At the end of the day, it's your account and you may play as you please
---
Oh wow a whole 10 minutes. That's really not bad compared to world hopping for a lot of pvm content. 
---
That's why I prefer small man teams to clans. 3-4 pkers can be just as deadly and then you get nice splits. I typically average around 700k-1m an hour at revs after factoring in losses but you could lose money or get a nice smite too. I aure enjoy it a lot more than pvming though so it works for me. I'm also only 70 cbt so we're not even pking in the lucrative bracket at revs.
---
If you kept reading my message I said that I only bring 1 prayer pot, and pick up the ones they drop then bank when i get an inventory full of pots (decanting them to 4's obviously even though i didn't state it in message) to at least get back a little bit of the cost of what i was using to train
---
OC

notice me credit me cherish me 
---
No I'll definitely hop around and do what I want, but I do like to have some for of efficiency. 
---
I know a lot of the content is locked behind quests and you can save time by doing quests and getting easy low levels.
---
I'm sure as I start I'll find my way. Just wouldn't mind having a "you're definitely not wasting time" path, and this quest guide seems the way to go.
---
Literally every single time. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd learn to watch the first few mins
---
&gt;Glad you're at least useful for something right Serene?
---
Anyone would interpret this line as negative and simply hateful, uncalled for. Unless you're brainwashed.
---
Wouldn't expect anything else by you though, since you're personally contributing towards these hateful ideas. Back off.

I remember watching his troll stronghold guide and the safe spot was not working "why za fuck wont this work!?! Lmao

Ah I must have missed that, thought you were commenting on someone who told you not to shut up see. My serene apologies

And you need to be on Arceus book which is not that useful for other things.

instead of taking the time to post this you shouldve just said hi lol

Now even pkers are complaining about pkers. We've gone full circle

But Blizzard is way worse about microtransactions.
---
I‚Äôm so confused, I don‚Äôt use my main?
---
I have that dedicated account to make cannonballs while my main does more important things, but then I‚Äôve got cannonballs for slayer etc... or profit lol
---
Let's just say one small favour is a lot more bearable with Slayermusiq
---
Hmm I mean I did it with a rune crossbow which would let the ranger be within range. Not sure what the idea is with a blow pipe except that you should be able to kill the ranger so quickly that they dont even have a chance to do much damage. 
---
Could you explain this more? Try to find something on the GE to buy super cheap and then turn around and put it back on the GE for more? are you talking about like big stacks of something? Not a single item right?
---
No.
---
I don't even understand why people dare to bring this up.    
---
We play **Old School** RuneScape for a reason.
---
Guys. I think we finally broke his spirit.

Serene, stop being a negative ass to everyone and maybe this wouldn‚Äôt happen. 
---
Devalues my 10 runecrafting
---
Maybe drink a stamina potion
---
yeah but (as far as i can tell) i cannot heal poison, turn on/off quick prayer, or turn on/off run and accidentally move on the mini map as well. Thats the issue. The fact that it visually overlaps is fine.
---
[deleted]
---
I don't play RS3 anymore, but I tend to stay in the loop for big updates.
---
The overall concept is great, but it'll definitely have to be adjusted to suit the Old School feel of the game and its economy.
---
Shut up serene
---
Are you going to do Barrows runs? 
---
I got 91 farming by doing fruit trees every day. Papayas are very cost effective! The four easy tree spots (five if you've done Mourning's End Pt2, which I literally did yesterday) will give you a pretty solid XP boost. 
---
With herbs, fruit trees, teaks/mahogs, and some cheaper wood trees you can have 70 farming in a few days. 
---
Lol RS didn‚Äôt really help me with marketing, accounting, finance, etc. like it could be said on paper. I‚Äôd have a terrible time if I invested IRL the way I do on rs 
---
I wish people would stop calling essence pouches "rune pouches." They're different things.
---
I'll buy into this format. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe you
---
Unfortunately that wouldn't help with recovering lost items from a death by disconnect since the room is instanced.
---
Got mine 2 weeks ago at 89 farming on a calquat... first pet :D
---
Jesus my dude. Those zammy wines have been a grind for me. I hate doing it; such a pain to log in and then have to immediately world hop a bunch to find an open spot. How do you stay sane?
---
UWOT MATE lmao!!
---
Pinguin cage.
---
What? That's the complete opposite of what I said. I really don't know how you got that from my comment. All I did was explain to /u/Aalae my thoughts on why people were making fun of the individual (because at the time, all these comments were flipped and they were the one with all the downvotes lol)
---
I'm saying if you throw a fit in public and start screaming and kicking things, of course people will laugh at you. I couldn't care less what gender the person identifies with.
---
I'm personally only f2p since I've somewhat came back to osrs last year (hardly play to justify members). Currently at 32m bank. If you know what to flip, there's some decent passive income. Alching is good go also. And surprisingly there are a lot of drop parties in f2p.

I'll take an easy 200k any day, wtf are you smoking
---
Better appreciate your mom instead of using her for karma you cunt

Currently combat 80 (Character name: Lord Shart)

I have zero idea or motivation on what to do next. I spent the better part of 2 days getting my dragon defender and now I feel lost. Any good ideas?
---
The spare is for the kill, not to reclaim items
---
Eh, I just used the "Fast sc" cc, and everyone that tried to do PvP got kicked.
---
It was pretty much just skillers farming the tools.
---
Yeah I want a higher chance to get tasked the new monsters in hopes of scoring some early uniques. I guess we'll have to wear Boots of Stone until we get the brimstones or Granite.
---
It always be like that in Australia servers.

Thanks!!

And then you tried reporting him instead?

Grab Dharoks and go farm some Giant Mole.

---
Wow thanks im going to go make 1000 accounts now and do this money making method said no one
---
but it aint homie g chrome and that shit saves all my shit so I can just log in to that shit anywhere and have it update all my info and shit. It's the shit
---
For those of you having trouble with my reference. I was referring to the fact that a PKer with half a brain cell would notice you doing a clue scroll the same way a PKer can clearly see im trying to kill a boss for a quest.
---
A kill is a kill though, no fucks were given.
---
Thanks man, suggestions for getting started? Any spots that will be easier where I can practice mechanics just pkign less experienced or pvmers?
---
Not chinning but melee there would use this. But all it really does is save an inventory slot, so not really a big deal
---
That seems... Oddly specific..
---
Agreed!
---
#
---
Yeah I hate when I willingly go to the one area of the game designed for players to kill other players and get killed by another player. 
---
Pay attention to the questions in the Stronghold of security and how to be more safe, maybe then you wont get "hacked" again and you even get a free 10k (winning!)
---
It was fun but I would say we kind of have this with raids. Just not as expansive 
---
Shut up, Serene 
---
Bet she reads them to him before bed too.
---
Yeah true, but it is a boss that relies heavily around firemaking so it would make sense still. 
---
Summoning should never be put in the game period. I like your idea rewards. Maybe upgrade kits for things that we don‚Äôt already have would be good. 
---
lmao
---
# yup they be do like that
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Did you just conveniently forget about the entirety of greece? The whole island of lesbos just slip your mind?
---
You can also use Proselyte with a Bludgeon 
---
When they try to trade in for their rewards they're not allowed to do so because "Ironmen stand alone"
---
Do you not refilled that there is an npc there who unnotes bones? I've pked over 1m in bones there over 10 times now, and have had other friends pk upwards of 10m in bones alone.

I have tried afk woodcutting on mobile during a lecture and I would either constantly log out or I would ignore the lecture too much.
---
I don't understand where you are getting confused but i'll put it in more basic terms, "If someone tries to make you do something you don't want to do, that's wrong."
---
Happened to me, prior to client of kourend. So I did double what is currently required lol
---
BOTH MUTAGENS AT 239 I HATE YOU!
---
Along with a d hally in the same drop thats some hefty rng
---
STILL HATE YOU
---
Yeah when my clan goes in 30+ deep to revs we don't do it cuz we are poor lmao. We do it to kill everyone pvmers and pkers. Yeah we do smite some nice stuff and can make a lot of money quick but it depends on rng. When people say "enjoy 5k split"
---
It's so funny cuz a bracelet is a bracelet. Pking is mostly for fun but when you smite acb or claws everyone wins 
---
Yes. I know how that's the situation in some cases. But there are also a lot of places/cases when it's not like that. From what I've gathered, from both real life interaction and speaking over the internet, most people, women and men, are okay with the other gender's genitals in their changing rooms, provided that they're there for changing. If someone deems they aren't, then of course they should tell staff so that they can make sure everybody's safe.
---
And also, if you were placed in that situation where you saw someone with female genitals in the male locker room, would you *want* them to be escorted out? If you don't mind them being there, as you said (and which I think is the case for most people as well), why shouldn't they be there if nobody minds?
---
Big clans is not about gp/h (aside from smites); it's about fun.
---
When my mate and I used to duo/trio rev caves we net over 3m/h since we knew what we were doing
---
That would be funny. Maybe they could do it for the cosmetics just no other things or the skilling rewards wouldn‚Äôt work because other players helped them obtain it 
---
Avernic as a gp sink (which is great tbh) but as for mutagen since it's untradeable i have no idea.
---
I'd never sell a serp helm once i get a mutagen. I can't wait to get one :(

I don't think I've ever clicked in that area. I always rotate my map to click the top right section. Maybe I'm just weird lol
---
Wow no ty
---
I mean I'd like it, but I bet there would be a lot of people who would be REEEing about the 100k/h super afk RC xp people would get, and devalue their sweaty lava rune grind.
---
Ever thought maybe people understand but they just don't care enough about the people whining about it to not say it? Especially when we're talking about reddit here not real life, people make fun of all sorts of horrendous things but it doesn't mean they support them or wish ill will to people.
---
I just pay members as I play usually just buy one month and sustain through bonds which isn‚Äôt the best method for those who can‚Äôt make much cash, but in reality you just gotta make 3-4m in 2 weeks.
---
People use for them runecrafting tiaras, good low level method since you can teleport directly to the mind altar with the zeah teleport tablets. It's better than fire runes and you don't need many requirements to do mind tiaras. 
---
unironically 
---
There were Theoatrix video for 1-50 Rc guide in 2 hours. I made quite good profit out of it :) 1 hour after the upload I bought talismans 1k each sold them 3k each just an hour ago (3m profit)
---
Find something you want and just start going for it! Recipe for Disaster (or Quest cape), Achievement Diaries, Fire Cape. Or set a goal for yourself to kill some sort of boss. Maybe try your hand at barrows to earn some cash, or brave some of the wilderness bosses.
---
Love his guides
---
There is no black king either. So what's your point exactly?
---
For real, the entire point of this kid even talking to his mom today was so he could get upvotes on reddit. 
---
Got my first pair of ranger boots at clue 581 a few days ago
---
no way bro thats so unlucky how dont u have the pet yet wtffffff
---
Lol right 
---
But we're talking about 400 superior bones, which nobody would bring except in a 2200 world *maybe*

And even then you'd have to get insanely lucky to find someone that dumb

---
Wasn't OP one bit, just entirely useless. If you carried on walking and activated the run energy when appropriate, you'd travel a further distance in relation to if you rested still instead.
---
I can't even meme, how accurate this is
---
It's one of the best capes for low/mid levels and good at high levels too. Stab, magic, and prayer bonus. 
---
I always run from the left side of the screen straight to the right. Using scroll wheel to give height if needed. Clicking to the far right of the minimap if I'm long distance running.
---
Not entirely true, most reskinned content you talk about are items (glacor boots - cerberus boots) or individual monsters (tormented demons - gorillas) put into another setting. 
---
In fact, only a handful of rs3 content have been **replicated and recreated from scratch** in OSRS, which is the category SC would fall under. The only real good example is corp, which even came without the quests, and maybe the GE. GWD and ZMI was a part of the original backup so that doesn't really count.
---
People want SC exactly as it was, meaning anything else than a straight copy would likely end in a disappointment. Now, considering every piece of code and asset have to be made from scratch, effectively adding months of dev time, how easy would it be to deliver a product (without summoning for instance) without people yelling at them "This isn't how I remember it" ?
---
Haha it can be a grind. Also, that was assuming elite void. Im not sure how normal void rates
---
Imagine being this out of touch with reality
---
But if you're buying bonds, just buy membership and utilise the ridiculous amount of better alternatives to mage training.
---
I think it was still a much faster way in travelin than run until energy is depleted, then walk until it's full again. For long distances it was better to run, recharge, run again, but hey, it's been a long while i don't remember everything perfectly anymwerjkoigjawegnjei0ejwrawop4tg
---
Ah okay, didn't know about the graceful. 
---
Tome was obvious yea, but it's only like 500k :p
---
I start potting range soon as i get the mages. To be safe I'd take 20-30 sweets. They're just nice to max your hp without wasting a brew dose and a restore. Anytime you brew and restore you also need to repot range so they save you doing that aswell.
---
Just raspberry emote those guys 
---
Practise with a YouTube video or a similar program beforehand if Jad's still a complicated issue in 2019. Retrieving the f cape should be a piece of cake.

By putting ads you're not asking people to give you money you know that right? It's a perfectly sensible thing to do because either way you'll get the same number of clicks on your video and it doesn't annoy people at this age. It's a very different concept than Patreon and the likes.

Why does Rada's blessing give +1/1/2 prayer bonus for tier 2/3/4, respectively, instead of +1/2/3? Was it determined that +3 prayer is too excessive for the ammo slot?

Wtf

Are there any current plans to revive some of the dead minigames? What would you like to do to improve them?

Double XP offers are always phishing scams. Always.
---
Or tell her not to buy them at all. You don't need the book unless it comes with a download for the web homework or something.   
---
All text books should be available for check out in the university library if you really need them but in my experience and everyone I knew at my university the text book was useless. 
---
I'm going to answer this for you. Yes it would be too excessive considering even making it +2 is making it bis for anything that doesn't require the ammo slot. 
---
I lost my job today, so now I get to play more runescape? I wish I could just get a RL job killing hill giants or something

Used to be in the same boat....hated mining. Had to grind out 80 for diaries....until I discovered Volcano Mine and turns out its 80k+ exp an hour at lvl 80+ and actually very fun and engaging. Went from 80 to 96 in a week or 2.
---
Don't bother flicking. It's easier just to pray magic 99% of the time after 32.
---
tele grab downstairs wine, by the door. Then run away. When they de-arggo, do the upstairs one
---
You mean bot wars where the 20% real players just farm the bots that are healing them? 
---
If you‚Äôre going to do that I‚Äôd recommend getting around 75 strength and keep 1 attack and then cannon your range fully to 50 that way you‚Äôll be somewhere between 37-39 combat and you‚Äôll have great ko potential with the obby maul
---
Just a pro tip -- scammers often put what looks like a raw hyperlink, but which actually masks the real one underneath. E.g. like this: [https://www.runescape.com/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape) . Always hover and look where it points to (usually bottom right in your browser) before clicking.

Ah, gotcha. Time to change my password to gibberish then.

Barb fishing is best to 99. The fact that it can be 3 ticked makes it better. But even without 3 ticking, it's still the fastest. 
---
I may have missed it but what are the requirements for the new Shaman area? I would love a gold farmer free environment if it's locked behind an hard(+) diary and favour. 
---
The best is mountain daughter " wtf I ate" 
---
Theres usually nh pkers at west dragons and graves in the 60-80 combat range. Also at black chins, but if your going there or higher up the wilderness I‚Äôd get 94 mage for barrages.
---
If I were you I'd start working on RFD since it only takes 6 subquests to get addy gloves which are slightly better than the combat bracelet.  This also gives you a goal on training cooking since to do one of the subquests you need 70 cooking (or ~65 if you just wanted to boost it).

Hmm, I obviously don't have the exact breakdown but I would say 5% (almost completely for my first 1mill) was from fishing + PVM + misc and then the remaining amounts after that was basically 70/30 from playing the market/pking. If you think about it though, averaging ~150k/day from the market is actually pretty reasonable once have decent capital
---
Quite a few of them are around 0.5 pets by level 99. It also depends on what methods you use.
---
No lol the joke is that you have 2 sensible choices and do something stupid instead.

Settled just went full time on Youtube so he can create these mortania videos that everyone is been raving for. If he has to have a full time job the videos will be posted FAR less frequently. I would gladly watch a 30 second ad 2 times during a video to be able to watch the video once a week rather then once a month,

Fuck you for blocking the ads.

an item sink is the opposite of a gold sink lol. technically it is a gold sink though because if you die in the wild under lvl 20 you have to spend 1m to repair, instead of 40k to repair a dragon defender. Repair costs are gold sinks as the gold doesn't go back into the economy.

if you adjust for inflation from 2002 its still a decent price hike but 11 a month for how much entertainment you get out of this game is still a steal.

to put it into perspective, cigarettes costs more than a month of rs, and retards spend that much on cigarettes in a day.
---
He should get augury aswell. It's not a bad prayer, just less noticable than rigour. If hes doing Zulrah a lot 7m is nothing and it will definitely speed up kills.

Yet you watch there videos for entertainment.

Hey man,  I recently got my first ever fire cape just after Christmas (after failing a few times) and here is what helped me;
---
1) I definitely agree with using / practising on the Jad simulator. Even though it is RS3 graphics, its essentially the same thing. Get those prayer switches down to a science.
---
2) I tried with both sound and with sound turned off, and I came to the conclusion that it's much easier to just look at his hind leg animations and then make the correct prayer switch. Also, to calm your nerves, try saying the prayer you are switching to out loud, and breathe. You got this. When the healers spawn, hit them enough to aggro them onto you, and dependent on where Jad spawns you can usually get them stuck behind one another, effectively only tanking hits from one. If you allow Jad to get healed to full HP and then kill all the healers they WILL most likely re-spawn again, so be weary of that, as I myself died this way.
---
3) If absolutely needed, log out and calm your nerves. Take a brisk walk, hit some weights, deep breaths, whatever you need to do. And, as always, remember: this is a game, it does not define you as an individual.
---
Goodluck.
---
It's just run energy, doesn't matter that much
---
:v
---
Thieving host is pretty much useless. There‚Äôs so many people in one world that don‚Äôt turn run off and pull the knight, the splasher loses agro then you either have bots or idiots who won‚Äôt off the knight long enough to reset lol. 
---
Most people who pk don't do it for profit, they do it because killing other players is fun. If they aim to make profit, they'll do bounty hunter on a BH specific build account.

---
Adding to your comment glum reaper, if one starts Barb asap and goes to 99 it will give you somewhere around a mil, if not more xp in both agility and strength making it efficient fishing xp all while being micro efficient with strength and agility at the same time. 
---
I've often wondered this too. I have just as much fun playing now as I did back in ~2006, but its a different kind of fun. 
---
My enjoyment these days comes from realizing goals I never would have been able to achieve back then. I never would have got barrows gloves or a fire cape in those days, but now I have and it feels great. 
---
After well over a year of rushing home from school to play RS everyday I had like a lvl 47 cb account with a bank of 10k. 
---
I could realistically beat that in under a day of playing now. It's nice because almost every achievement that I have or will have is new to me, as the bar from my old playing days is so low. Makes me feel like a kid again when I reach new milestones I never had before. Getting barrows gloves in 2018 felt just as good as getting my first rune scimmy in 2006
---
That's way too much. Should be like 1/10 or 1/20th of that.

He used to throw rocks at you if you didn't accept his little kind gesture. That little fuckwit is a bad egg. Don't sympathize for him when he weeps "Aww, me matey don't like me" after not responding to him, because you know he really wants to hand you that bad kebab that lowers your combat stats. 
---
Why not just plant a flower to break the bot 
---
I got hacked for 20m and fighter torso in 2010 and it felt pretty terrible. I didn't play for like 3 weeks. It was the most money I'd ever had. But I came back and decided to go for 99 fishing and made it all back and then some. You've learned your lesson so I'd say give it another shot if you enjoy the gameplay.
---
That looks insane lol I had no idea you could 1 tick them like that, and makes sense how reaching these xp rates is possible. Although I don't feel like practicing this since my arm is a bit tired from constant clicking, thank you though, I'll save the video.

You cared enough to comment? I felt the kill count was relatively low so I decided to post it. Dont like it keep scrolling, Toxic asshole

It's a known issue where hardware acceleration breaks the client on Linux with Intel GPUs. This doesn't include if you use the GPU plugin though.

For the new Achievement Diary releasing on Thursday for the tasks:
---
* **Subdue the Wintertodt.**
---
* **Defeat Skotizo in the Catacombs of Kourend.**
---
* **Complete a raid in the Chambers of Xeric.**
---
**If a player has already completed these, will a player have to do so again after the diary is released in order to be counted?**
---
I ask this because the Kill Counts for these activates are already tracked, making it easy to detect if a player has completed one or not.
---
Those are both from completely different rewards. Rune pouch is from bounty hunter and the herb sack is a slayer reward. But if you're choosing which one to *focus* on getting next, then I'd vote for the rune pouch. I stick laws, lavas, and mist runes in mine and it becomes a one-invo mass teleport machine.
---
Herb sack has more niche uses while rune pouch is just a general quality of life upgrade.
---
Sucks you had to take the time to photoshop and already existing item set
---
would only work if it was a free instance like grotesques
---
True, another good one.
---
i‚Äôm probably in the minority who doesn‚Äôt want fire cape cause it makes my character look like a walking pizza 
---
Took me about 40 chambers of xerics kc to realize you can right click the tree for pots and "pick lots". Have been picking single potion jars for days.
---
So then... don't go to multi? Haha I don't understand your logic. You want to go to multi and kill PvMers for money with a free pass to not be attacked by clans? What do you want, SJWscape? Where everyone has to give consent before a fight?

No problem :) happy scaping
---
The thing is, dead mini-games aren't much different to other dead content in the game except that you need at least one other person to make it work.
---
Lots of the game is non-optimal and therefore "dead". For example, Al-Kharid mine is basically useless, Rimmington is abandoned once you've done the couple of quests that are optimally completed by wandering about the village. This didn't use to be the case. On release in RSC Al-Kharid mine was a great place to mine top tier armour.
---
You can't continually keep every bit of content worth doing because new content at low levels will replace old stuff. For a member doing much sub 30 melee combat is non-optimal because Waterfall quest has an OP reward (but I don't expect this to be fixed even though it's kinda breaking).
---
Putting effort into making mini-games used means changing them so that they are on the optimal path. Given that mini-games are safe and isolated that makes the rest of the game feel even less busy, except for that mini-game.
---
I don't think OSRS is improved if there's BA prods like RSEOC had Pest Control prods, penguin prods and now SoF prods.
---
The fixes for the mini-games should be:
---
1) Isolate them all to a single world
---
2) Make it possible to be in a queue to start a game without waiting at the game (so for example, I can be bossing on W24 and in a queue for a game of BA on W205).
---
It should not involve making the rewards a significant meta / a direct XP gain method.
---
No, not a joke. It's a phishing attempt.

Pyramid Plunder is better XP as Ardy Knights, is not as click intensive, has a chance for an awesome reward and is actually quite fun. I never understood why people even do Ardy Knights when Pyramid Plunder exists. 
---
Ah I see, thanks

This community is a bunch of little pussy bitches. Make a joke  neg votes lol
---
Jesus this the guy I caught my ex with
---
We we be able to NPC contact the new slayer master right when the update goes live?
---
Thank you
---
Lol reeee
---
Yeah, I didnt,know that. I tried just installing the game from the website. For the linux version. Go to find out that doesnt actually work. Then migrated over to osrs and found there are clients. Chose the first one and had this issue . got it figured out though.
---
Y'all need to go the fuck outside this shits pathetic
---
Why do you even try serene?
---
Going for the bishop would be a bad move though as you will lose to the queen
---
Thieving doesn't need new training methods. Construction and Herblore need them. 
---
I have over 300 quest points in RS3 and no desire to do it all again in OSRS. I don't understand why other players get their titties in a twist about players not doing quests. I just don't like them, okay? I'd rather train a skill for 10 hours than do one 30-minute quest. 
---
That's actually a really good idea, thank you!!
---
Pain pills make grinding way better, where do you break it at? Sorry if you already answered that 
---
Ik a youtuber did it as a challenge an if u plant them at the right time as the bot does its thing it breaks the bot 
---
I didnt necessarily want it and got it from a willow tree on 48 farming \_O_/ thats the way it goes sometimes
---
How you dare touch god ash pics!
---
Little of both 
---
I think it's a model for when it's laying on the ground; there are tools to extract those from cache. AFAIK icons for the most part are just renders of the item's model.
---
so there's no way to avoid the magic debuff?
---
Go be a victim somewhere else 
---
I've Been playing PP also pretty nice! But this would Be nice addition 
---
Hunter becomes profitable before RC does (in terms of time spent)
---
Yeah and that's totally understandable. But if that's the case, simly stay out of wildy. Or at the very least, don't complain on reddit when a player kills you. 
---
Just from 96-99 cooking, it takes 30 hours. Also, I said Hosidius Kitchen, so obviously it's cooking. Go alch yourself.
---
I dont get it what's happening
---
some people are too trusting and greed hits them easily. Its obviously working for him considering how much cash he has. 
---
Raids 1, and first day of classes for the semester. 
---
85 raids dry, last drop was a 3 man thrownaxe. I‚Äôve missed 2 tbows in the past week in clan FFA‚Äôs. 
---
Are you fucking serious right now? You lucky cunt. 
---
Someone should make Grace Full‚Ä¶
---
Rude!
---
It's god awful.  The worst is half these accounts afking that are "mains" are absolute trash.  They often don't have firecape, aren't quested, and don't have any decent gear on.  Then they say you can't hold the spot because of your level when in reality minus their defence you are probably the same level.   
---
All you can do is have alts there for splashing when a dipshit shows up to crash.
---
If you look hard enough you can see the slight outline of fucks that just don't seem to be given
---
Wrong!
---
Those are rookie numbers, gotta pump those up
---
Can you change partner slayer so that the lower level initially gets the task instead? It would be nicer to use and less open to abuse. With how it is now, high level players have to burn tons of points on skips to slay with lower level friends. It's also possible for low levels to dodge a lot of unfavorable tasks by passing duradel tasks to them. Flip it around, and both of these problems are gone.
---
Can you reconsider throwing untrimmed cape holders a bone? You wouldn't have to add new functionality, just commenting out the code to trim already owned capes on pickup and on getting subsequent 99s is enough. Refraining from doing so isn't helping those who already had an accident with their capes, it's just making more people potentially go through the same thing.
---
IDK seems like he just wants a source for getting them
---
Yeah not vectors my bad
---
If I were you I'd try updating your graphics card
---
not sure if we use the same google, but the medieval lances look nothing like the current DHLance design lmao.
---
Can the mechanic where somebody going into the next theater of blood room prematurely without all teammates results in booting out players from the raid? Too many people in the ffa worlds are clumsy about this. 
---
The only way they can prove this is track the ip of the time he was mutes  to the time he recovered the account.
---
Seriously all the osrs food is gross. Have the devs ever even seen what goes on a potato?
---
Unplayable. 
---
Pppllleeasee jagex
---
Wait they‚Äôre 10m now? I got some as a drop last month and sold it for like 900k
---
???
---
Literally my only complaint with slayermusiq is he always recommends about 2x as many stamina pots as you'll actually use. Kthxbai.
---
time to break my neck i guess
---
Shut the fuck up
---
After graceful,should I hold onto my marks of grace? Besides recolors,they don't have any use besides crystals,right?
---
His question is ‚Äúis it more efficient to craft astrals or natures?‚Äù
---
You can make a profit with fletching by making longbows but most efficient players make darts at a loss instead, because the time saved can be used to make money faster. OP knows natures are more profitable and that astrals are faster, he‚Äôs asking for general ideas about the price difference that should warrant crafting natures or astrals.
---
Oh gotcha. I'm still in the 500 worlds which are actually only a bit better than the rest of the worlds usually
---
^ triggered not 
---
Keep replying, it's funny to see you get worked up 
---
Lmao you're obviously not training it properly, you can get like 1m xp an hour doing wines at max efficiency. 
---
We run a slightly modified version of MediaWiki, which is open source. What part of our framework do you want to use?
---
/r/ChoosingBeggars
---
take a look at yourself you mental fucker
---
Think about it this way: If you forgot to tip the waiter, would you go back?
---
Maybe they wouldnt if you werent such a dumb troll all the time
---
You should absolutely not keep 1 def for your hardcore lol. Keeping 1 def is a thing for player vs player accounts which you can't really make use of since 1) you're supposed to avoid death as a hardcore and 2) even if you kill someone you cant take their stuff since you're an ironman.
---
Unless you're making a special secondary account for pvp, get your defence up. 
---
Can we revisit Stealing Booty activity in Piscarillius area? Currently it's dead content and was only used after woox found a method to teleport to even make the experience viable. Currently the mechanics for this activity are incredibly bad as your character movements make it almost impossible to sneak past the guards to deliver the goods. Additionally, the xp is pretty bad as well as any profit. 
---
I do believe this method would help add some diversity to the skill especially if we added maybe "short-cuts" or hidden zones you can only access with a certain thieving level or agility when doing this activity. Also making the xp something more generous then it is, since this actually is more like thieving then pickpocketing a night whose is being splashed on for ages. 
---
To add on, there could be more added on when the player has 100% favor such as bribing the guards or being able to sneak more look for a better xp chain/maybe profit.
---
I know y‚Äôall responded about hiding poll results. Is that change still set for early 2019?
---
That's cool with me, I've anti'd
---
Welcome to mems. I'll be on later tonight if you want some help with some bits. I'll add you later
---
I wonder if you could fill a bot's inventory with something or another and make them lose all of their traps? Idk how you would do it, but it seems like it could be possible. 
---
Explorer's ring gives a pray bonus or two. There really aren't a lot of options for the ring slot. 
---
Can the scaling of Ice Demon and Theiving Chests in CoX be more lenient on solo players? Both rooms take a huge amount for one person and drastically drop in a duo. It causes these already long rooms to take even longer, to the point where people avoid them altogether simply to save time.
---
Ranged is already best dps in ftp. If anything, they should make low-level crossbows f2p. 
---
thanks man
---
thanks!
---
He‚Äôs trying to recover not kill him self.
---
Dick move on the hacker's part. If your friend talked to you a lot on RS, make sure you leave your friend status on public so he can send you a message without you having him on your list. Hopefully he'll reach out sooner or later.
---
Is it possible to increase the charges on crystal items similar to how the enchanted trident holds 20k charges.
---
Swing and a miss 
---
I lol‚Äôd
---
These little cunts don't know how easy they got it
---
mfw magma mutagen but no uniques or onyx still :(
---
petition to make every skill slayer
---
Thank you very much! So I should just make my stats higher and higher, right? What about some ppl who make 99-mage and 99-def only irons? Or it‚Äôs just a way to make the gameplay wore difficult?
---
I didnt know about this, thanks!
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Will you be releasing the task list and weightings of the new slayer master and the new drop table as well?
---
&gt; Same problem as the highscores in that almost all of those 300,000 are inactive
---
I would venture completely the opposite. People who additionally seek out a community and forum for talking about the game, beyond just playing the game, are much more likely to be active. I'd be surprised if less than 200k of this sub's members are active.
---
&gt; it's a good representation of a relatively small and focused minority of the community. 
---
That's fair. These are the most important people in the community from the game standpoint, but not necessarily from the money making standpoint. Still, the reason I put midgame in quotes way back in my other comment is because 75 is something like 1/10th the way to 99, so if you consider the length of time someone who maxes the skill would spend, 75 is still quite early on. It certainly still takes a while to get to, but it's not ToB or Inferno, that's for sure.
---
Yeah you can either save them for backup graceful, buy more recolors, or exchange them for amelayse for some cash. 
---
Depends on where you are financially ofc but personally I would way rather have backup graceful with more colors than a few mil. 
---
Well in my opinion greed is simply the cornerstone of rehabilitation. If you're willing to gain, you should be willing to lose as well.
---
honestly i'd swap your onyx for my mutagen i got it at 250kc and i still have no good drops i don't care about cosmetics
---
Shut up Serene
---
Are you retarded or something. It‚Äôs obviously a joke post like the million other ‚Äúabsolute unit‚Äù jokes on here. Ffs. you‚Äôre taking a joke post with literally humor in flair super serious. Fucking snowflake lol............ 
---
Don't the healers disappear then respawn repeatedly if you don't kill them? So it kind of is a big deal if Jad gets healed to full? Unless I misunderstood the guide, my interpretation was Jad gets healed to full, healers go away, Jad gets to 50% again, healers respawn, rinse and repeat until you can kill the healers. Every time I died at Jad was because I couldn't see/click the healers and missed a prayer flick while panicking to right click attack them. Jad is ridiculously easy if it weren't for them.
---
its actually not even a whole fish, the image just looks that way.

"With a knife, use a bowl or the knife on the cooked tuna to produce a bowl of chopped tuna."

I‚Äôve gotten around 15 marble superior gargoyles and at various times during the fight I‚Äôll tele to my POH, restore health, tele to slayer tower with the slayer ring, and get back to the fight within 8 seconds but every time I get back and the superior is gone. Likewise, I perform the same actions during a fight with the superior nech in the slayer tower which can be roughly the same distance away and the superior nech is always there. Why does the marble gargoyle disappear so quickly? 
---
Most people just turn them in for crystals. If you're hardcore into outfit collection, though, you can always save up for multiple sets so you can own all the recolors. It also takes 90 marks to recolor any single set, so you might want to keep that many for yourself.
---
It's been on public, but I don't know if my friend still plays :/ It's been like 5 months since this all went down.
---
Either both statements are true or both are false. Fire cape is +4 str bonus and infernal is +8, so they‚Äôre both +4 increments. Therefore they should both save you the same amount of time.
---
How do you get timestamps with your text? Runelite plugin?
---
Will the farming cape have a free teleports to farming guild?? 
---
True, those of us who started playing in 2004 have NO idea what 'real Runescape' is.
---
Wines are for the rich. I'm doing sharks.
---
They're exploring elf stuff as prif rewards
---
There is not an objective argument and there is no evidence of it being better. They both have there pros and cons and are much more similar than you're willing to admit.
---
Maybe do it like kraken, so irons that want to save supplies with the poh method can still do that, and mains can camp instances
---
Played a bit but im completely Lost. No idea what to do, how to get money, craft anything or where to buy any items
---
I might buy premium thing but for now I'm f2p

Ineed help in about every way possible.

HI! (Made the account; a friend sent me this link lmao im stoked, i wasted a bond because i had a name ban for a year and i tried to see if i could get around it :p but it was just a waste

Karma farming tip:

Reset your KC counter before every boss kill so it seems like you're incredibly lucky

I disagre, Serene is just parroting other top comments.

Stop parroting Serene.

Ah you mean that those people get money from various business to promote those companies products on their fanbase?
---
Now that the farrming guild is here, what guild do you think the game needs next?

We have yet to see:

Runecraft Guild.

Smithing Guild.

Hunter Guild.   
---
Fletching Guild.   
---
Herblore Guild.

(ha, I know that you get it)
---
Lol this shit is funny. Your retard ass comments have made this post actually enjoyable. Thank you. You need to go get laid my friend. R.i.p. 
---
Yes. It is actually.  
---
Deriding people for trying to make a living off a platform is shitty behavior, you should take a good long look at yourself because the way you treat other people's hard work and effort is sad. I'm sure that slayermusiq1 would be dissappointed in you as a fan. 
---
Yeah I feel the same way too.
---
I'm just thinking out loud here, no serious suggestion, but I think it'd be pretty neat if each NPC could be pickpocketed X amount of times before being "empty" for 5 minutes. This would force the player to switch between NPCs, with possibly better loot or XP to compensate for the added effort.
---
Why?
---
fake, woman cooking level ain't 99 soz 
---
Can a separate Nechryael room with less Nechryael's be added to the Catacombs of Kourend so those that want to melee there can do so without being crashed?
---
Can another Dust Devil room also be added to the Catacombs of Kourend to tackle the increasing overcrowding issue there? It just forces players to crash others, especially ironmen.
---
False. It's only part of a tuna, cut in the shape of a tuna. 
---
A tuna made out of tuna. 
---
I used to pk abyssal runners when I was bored, it‚Äôs actually a lot of fun trying to chase them down before they teleport. 
---
As for the reward, people usually just sell the glory and replenish supplies on the account, it‚Äôs not to make a significant profit. 
---
You forgot Warped Jelly and Dust Devil

Can we have a sleeveless option for the fighter torso?

Also, you realize a charity stream is usually straight through and 50k hours is like 2,112 days? So you want a almost 6 year stream??
---
ketchup and mustard robes and already-exists robes
---
I‚Äôd like to see ether drops increased it‚Äôs so pricey now 
---
To add to what the other user said the reason people keep certain combat stats like defense low is to keep their combat level lower while having high damage.  Complete guess on combat levels here but like a player with 40 attack and 40 str might have 50 combat and be able to use rune weapons and kill other level 50 players who have maybe 25 attack, defense and strength as in the wilderness you can only attack players within a certain level range of you.  It only provides an advantage in PvP which is likely not something you'd ever want to do on a hardcore IM.
---
&gt;when you're new and you want to fit in
---
Recording, editing, doing the commentary if not done live and putting it all together into a cohesive and entertaining video is content.  
---
Just finished the Fremennik Trials and swapped out the Obby helm with the Berserker helm. I might start churning through RFD next since I'm able to casually quest on mobile while at work.
---
You don't sound smart serene. 
---
I usually just chin the healers then run through jad praying melee when he‚Äôs doing his animation, then all the healers are stuck on the other side of Jad. Saves time because you don‚Äôt have to keep restarting :)
---
I don't agree with your opinion of creating content.
---
He's asking how to get them, not where you can find them.
---
Eat my ass you inbred mongoloid
---
Don‚Äôt forget about how they can smite a glory for another 15k!!! Come on boys! GET YOUR SMITES UP!
---
Better to not waste the runes. Just drop.
---
Yep, a buyable only trained on dxp. 
---
Alright thx everyone, I bought my BGS back :P
---
I agree, if it wasn't for him I would have never achieved that cape.
---
I prefer Edge 
---
you can get ash from vm passively, hardly needs a buff. have like 10k on my ironman.
---
yes, it is called "chat timestamps"
---
The first time I fought jad I lost because I was too nervous, kept double clicking prayers and got killed. So on my second attempt, I logged out before jad, then I spent about 10min calming myself down and did some breathing exercises. Then I got my fire cape.
---
I don't even get the women in the kitchen thing. Everyone I know the man cooks and the majority of top chefs are men. 
---
I don't agree with your opinion that it is creating content. I'm also not a fan of slayermusiq1 nor am I deriding anyone. I'm just stating my opinions towards his "ad policy".
---
oh man that would be so nice, a way to directly practice Jad without all the wait...
---
That's how Mafia works
---
Both 
---
So you are giving zero credit for the work people put into their videos.  What do you call the effort and end product if it is not content?
---
Everyone is just typing n1ga
---
The never ending cycle
---
Do Fremennik Isles next to get the Helm of Neiz. Also, I would rock DLegs and get a Fighter Torso (I need to take my own advice there and get one myself). That's like 2M you can recoup by selling the Obby gear. 
---
I‚Äôll have to experiment around a bit 
---
That's how advertising in entertainment works, yes.  No different than someone displaying advertisements in between singing/cooking/dancing/playing sports, whether on tv or online.  Not sure why this is such a difficult concept for you.
---
knock knock
---
Can 3rd age range (top and bottom) be given a +1 range accuracy bonus to its current stats? (putting top at 31 range accuracy and legs at 18 range bonus)
---
currently it has the same range bonus as black dhide and is outclassed in most situations by blessed god dhide.
---
It would be similar to what they did to 3rd age mage. In beginning of osrs it had exact same stats as infinity but was increased later on
---
3rd age range would still be worse than armadyl. Just better than black dhide
---
Are there any requirements to wear the black mask? I'm 70 def 55 slayer. I know they're dropped at 61 slayer from cave horrors but can I just buy 1 off GE?
---
Do fruit trees and **absolutely** do hardwood trees on fossil island. Just use Ultracompost for the hardwoods rather than paying for protection. Don‚Äôt bother with regular trees they‚Äôre terrible gp/xp. 
---
I died 4 times before I killed him. After I did it I realized how retarded I was for ever dying. It‚Äôs a great feeling.

Being able to 1 click the gates to Port Phasmatys and Al Karid if you've completed the quests to get through for free. Would like to skip the dialouge or not have to right-click.
---
I'm not sure if I had it set up to screenshot at the time, but I'll definitely go check it out. I just messed with a bunch of RuneLite settings yesterday and the screenshot thing was one that I just set up. Thank you for the information though!
---
They require 20 strength, 10 defense, and 40 combat to equip. You should be fine just buying one off the GE.
---
Quickest, slowest, most enjoyable and least enjoyable ones to get?
---
Aaand you ruined it. 
---
and yet you're the one responding to him for karma gibs
---
I did 35-70 smithing cannonballs at work. Only have to bank + click furnace every 3-4 min or so. NMZ, barb fishing, brutal black dragons are decent afk exp
---
Center spot Jad makes it extremely easy to get the healers stuck behind him, not complete waste of time.
---
On mobile I can?? Shit thanks man!
---
mine is the one where bart punches lisa in the face for throwing his model plane out the windiw and breaking it
---
But is there anything noteworthy in the console's output?
---
I watch videos while using peripheral vision to click the green squares runelite shows on my screen so it might as-well be afk for me lol.
---
I don't remember what my rsn was back when I maxed as I changed it almost every month lmao. The one I used for the longest was lchimaru_Gin, but I changed it then quit for couple months shortly after and never changed back cause I forgot to and someone sniped it while I was gone.
---
I was pretty lowkey and was never apart of any of the PvM or maxed clans and chilled in bleach clans my entire rs3 career until they all died.
---
Loved the maxed forums, was 99% troll and meme posts every day now it's dead as hell.
---
Once saw a post back then that summed it up pretty good.
---
You grind for months on end, finally getting maxed so you can access the maxed forums and receive Jagex responses to your posts and have sneak peaks to upcoming content. Except when you finally get their it's a bunch of troll's sitting under a bridge scratching their ass.
---
what a childish comment
---
I don't doubt what you're saying but that's not completely the context I was going at here.  I completely understand my weight is an issue at the moment.

Saying your actions out loud is great advice. 
---
The downs. 
---
the "buy from shop and hop" mechanic is absolute shit. adds nothing to the game. instanced/infinite stock shops should exist. ofc there'd need to be additional changes to combat shop-buying bots but that shouldnt be too difficult.
---
There's a crafting guild just southwest of Falador btw
---
RuneLite's GPU plugin can increase draw distance. Check it out
---
Grats man! I'm still working on my first 99. What do you mean by telegrabbing the cape to make sure it's untrimmed? Can you get multiple untrimmed skill capes?
---
This is what gets me. Y‚Äôall sit up on this high horse while simultaneously singling this man out *as a community* like I would expect from a bunch of kids on an mmo in *actual 2007*. 
---
To the people out there who think this justifies y‚Äôalls behavior, I say to grow the fuck up. 
---
I feel like Agility is Brimhaven, I don't see a need to expand it past that TBH.
---
Defence I just lump in with Warriors guild, even though I know it's not a requirement.

I'd say the only ones that sound cool in my head are RC/Slayer/Herblore.  That's just me though.

Best combat money maker doable on phone without needing full attention? Zulrah is exhausting and I can't do it while watching tv shows. If I had the semi afk phone alternative that makes 500k I wouldn't bother with Zulrah. 
---
dopeee, i was thinking earlier today about how i havent seen ur art in a while 
---
I think it's mostly the time investment and lack of preparedness for it.  I've been perfectly fine without beating him for some time now.  As you can read from most of these comments it's not an unusual feeling.
---
Are free-to-play worlds any different from the member ones?
---
Kill him for it in wildy over lv 20, you get 1m
---
Use Chins, and just autoretaliate
---
I second the idea of doing something with partner slayer.  Idk what to do, maybe make the kills from both players count? I honestly don't know.  It just feels weird at the moment to be honest.
---
Well, I spent that entire day finishing the f2p quests. I only have the dragon slayer left, which I don't know if I would do with a level 35 combat character.
---
Not to be negative but this post won't change a thing. Due to his attitude and how he comments and replies to peoples posts is the reason why people talk down to him. It's too far at this point and even after all the hate, the kid continuously trolls. I don't feel sorry at all. 
---
I never even noticed the yellow (eye?) on the tuna... I always thought the tuna part was just like shoved into the middle of the potato and the brown/grey color of the tuna was like just parts of the fish sticking out LOL
---
You're holy, shit right.
---
Thanks for being open minded :). 
---
Back in the day YouTube was a very different world than it is now. Before it was possible to upload almost anything and you would get some views, but now *300 hours* of video is uploaded to YouTube **every minute**.  
---
The point I'm trying to get across is that it's a LOT harder to be noticed today, and even if you do get noticed, unless you are creating *consistent and high quality* content, you likely won't be able to grow much at all (excluding situations where someone just "gets lucky").
---
Back in the day it was fine with little to no financial support, as there was no actual understanding of what should go on YouTube (that situation is going on even today - see the Ad-pocalypse).  
---
However think of it this way. As YouTube and the channels on it grew. How will everyone working normal everyday jobs, be able to afford that expensive camera for vlogs, or be able to record/stream high quality audio and video without expensive graphics cards and powerful computers? 
---
It's not just about having "financial" support. It's about being able to keep offering new and better content in order to keep their viewers in the first place. In order to "keep up with the times" they need money, and that money is reinvested back into their channel ("business"). Without this, I do believe that many YouTubers would die off/quit.
---
To answer your second question, I'm not familiar with a ton of RS YouTubers, but all screen capture software and video editing software has advanced drastically compared to 2006. So too has the power requirement. Video editing is very CPU intensive. If you go watch old videos and then new ones it's easy to see the difference between their quality and editing techniques. I'm not too familiar with all that though, so this is the extent of my knowledge on it. 
---
Hopefully I've answered your questions. I'd encourage you to check out some of the effects the ad-pocalypse had on a lot of YouTubers, as well as their dissatisfaction with the platform. 
---
To add on to this team thieving room should be fixed as well. AFAIK it's not worth doing since if you're team thieving level isn't well distributed  some people can't even do it. Would also help for small cm Cox teams. Also decreasing the time it takes for the scavenger and ice demon to deplete their blue health would be nice
---
You split even with alch
---
Mine was killing chickens at the farm north of Port Sarim and then selling the feathers to the fishing shop. 
---
No wonder I never made it past a ~10k bank
---
Lightweight? 
---
Zuhaar's too busy soliciting dick picks to Angelscapes
---
They way I read it was that instead of making it a permanent shazien slayer helm, we can  add and remove the shayzien helm whenever we please.
---
hodl
---
Gargoyles are a good option. I think I was making 350k-400k per hour doing straight up AFK with guthans and ROW. Just look down every once and awhile to pick up valuable drops, and the ROW picks up all the coins. As AFK as you can possibly get while still making money. 
---
I think a Hunter Guild around Lands End with the same contract system as the Farming Guild would be really neat
---
Thats exactly the type of answer I was looking for, thank you so much.  Im still about 9m away from prims so I'll stick to str for my tasks until I get a little closer.
---
Yep! free-to-play worlds do not allow you to use member only items or locations. Most of the map is off limits.
---
Agility. The LEAST afk skill lol
---
Oh yeah
---
Damn really? Was always one of my recommended games cause i remember always being able to throw it on a toaster and playing just fine.
---
Haven't touched it sense I was a bit younger and found the economy was lit, could buy games by just playing and knowing prices.
---
LPT: If you want a theoatrix video, but don't have it on the corresponding topic, just put the relevant wiki page on text to speech on the slowest setting. 
---
Can't tell a difference!
---
No way a dude is going to get banned for selling 1m kebabs... 
---
Well I guess I haven't used other apps in the past 2 years but when I did, Sync had the best navigation and the best feed customization
---
You can't. Runelite plugin.
---
Why would you want to remove it after adding it though? does it drastically change the look? 
---
That's an allusion to the regeneration power imbued into such a delicacy. If it reatores chopped tuna it can pretty much hold you together.
---
Who cares about semantics. The people running it left.
---
mining 1.8t granite 16 hrs a day
---
Thanks I'll change it now
---
Always go chill with the boys. The beauty of runescape is that it's always there whenever you want. The boys are people and have shit to do so you should hang when they're available. 
---

Most afkable i suppose is probably crafting bowstrings in lumby castle or smithing cannonballs in edgeville. Both have a 2min-ish window where you're just sitting there. They only average 100-125k / hr though.
---
If you're looking for easy money making and don't mind a few extra clicks, tanning green dragonhides can net 300-500k/hr if you have some money to invest and don't mind a few more clicks. Not exactly afkable but certainly easy.

Looks normal. Try to to check the logs next in C:\\Users\\caspe\\.runelite\\logs

Totem grind time is part of the perceived difficulty
---
I played both sc and sw and I liked sw much more, even though the rewards were better from sc.
---
i want to keep my firemaking cape untrimmed, because why not. So in order to do that I have to drop it before getting 99 then once im 99 mining i telegrab the firemaking cape, otherwise it will trim the firemaking cape
---
This was in my opinion the best mini game in all of RuneScape. Jagex could even nerf the xp boosting tools to make it less op. The xp boosting tools would have to be introduced to make stealing creations a viable mini game.
---
Yup there were a couple of things like baby dragons, red spiders. Would be a good alternative to pvming for 2nds
---
If you're going for normal spellbook, then you should be alright, although you might want to make fire surge a priority in the future.
---
99 mage and range will be a bigger upgrade than any gear!
---
I was making a MatK and Emilyispr0 joke lol
---
You know what to do now and you didn't then. I played for easily enough time to max before the year 2007 but just did stupid shit for so much of the time that I was probably 1200 total. 
---
This man will shepherd us into the light.

-Crafting cape
---
-giant pouch + large pouch only
---
-f keys
---
-don't misclick
---
-tick perfect banking / quick banking
---
-magic imbue while running
---
I can usually get 60-65k with ease without really good clicks or banking
---
You sound really offended 
---
Loot tracker plugin
---
Which game is this
---
Lol so desperate go away you fucking cheesemonger
---
Sometimes people bring stupid risk into the wilderness. I once thought I had 3 items when going to do a kbd task and forgot about my God dhide boots. Peace out 1m forgot I had em on and didn't bother to protect item. I also once lost a veracs set when I accidentally (not so accidentally) skulled on some pkers at callisto. 
---
I once killed some dude who was like level 40 in f2p and he had 1k laws on him. Why? Fuck if I know.
---
It's the wilderness, you knew the rules before coming in. Kill everyone you see, never know what they are carrying.
---
why do pvmers think you split pk loot lol
---
Can i have your gold plz

Don‚Äôt listen to him! I get the shakes coming back to jad after a long break, it‚Äôs just the long path getting there that sucks üò∞

What's the resolution of this? Ive been looking for a good 128x32 pixel art
---
Can there be an option in osrs mobile to reduce the duration of press needed for right clicking?
---
Thanks pal
---
Apollo is close and it‚Äôs super customizable to make it even more so. 
---
I did like 50 push ups before Jad so my adrenaline wouldn't spike, I also threw a dip in to calm my nerves. 
---
The best part is when your 20 quests deep and you're onto the next one as usual and he drops a curse word. "You could always run back, but fuck that.". Even though I curse like a sailor in real life, the first time I heard it, I was shocked like a child hearing a curse word. :O
---
As someone who grow up not speaking English the game really became much easier once I started to understand what was extually happening
---
Hey man I'm praying you get your boy that sweet Glacial Malphite skin :)
---
Noice, think you'd reach the cape without mlm?
---
You can catch dragon implings if you have a high enough hunter level
---
They are the second most sought after catch.
---
I don't have 90 or so hunter so i'm letting people that do know
---
Congrats all the same.
---
Props for the effort
---

Perhaps you could use burnt food to neck yourself
---
Fuck you DustKitten!!!
---
Most, if not all, dragons are weak to stab. So the damage from the lance is probably similar (or better) than the bow despite having a lower damage percentage. 
---
oh..*[ü§£godü§£](https://i.imgur.com/JWLRnTe.gif)*

He's talking about how you run to the red zone and open the world map if you click there, trying to only open the world map.
---
You can make ropes to make nooses
---
Divine coming to OSRS confirmed
---
Actually, many were done using RL/OSB's ability to remove the zoom restrictions, which we've done since 2016 or so.
---
Most of the high-res images that RL helped us get were either hard-to-obtain or have a Destroy option (which meant we can't drop it and get high-res images).
---
U can download all the jpeg items on rs web site
---
Is because there are bots who run with cash stacks and rune stacks, and normal players making bad decisions by having their stacks on them. Happens enough times to make it worth it. 
---
.... is he a true chaotic neutral?
---
Wait so you‚Äôd rather chase the knight around the bank? I think having a splasher makes this much easier. 
---
Grats my dude! I will try to be there :)
---
You've taken a warm, moist shit on the legacy of Kob. Great meme 10/10
---
If there was a wiki back then, it definitely wasn't well-known. It's saved my ass at least 80 times by now.
---
it would probably motivate me to learn to 3tick granite if motherlode mine was out, but i dont know i probably would of put it off
---
actually i made a mistake
---
that same guy came back, and the second time he had 100 mill risk
---
so he pked 130+m from one guy
---
not staged
---
Range is not just very strong atm, it's the highest dps in the game with stuff like Toxic blowie,  twisted bow, and dragonhunter crossbow. 
---
To be fair xp rates back then were god awful. It took Zezima like four years to max when the total level was only 1980. Bad xp rates combined with not knowing what you're doing means things are going to take a long time.
---
don't play with your food!
---
I would literally play classic TF2 right now and for probably the next month straight if they released it. I spent a lot of time pre-hats TF2 and really want it to go back to before all the weird wackadoo shit was added. Also classic maps and not all the new things they added just to say they added it.
---
Well fuck me that explains everything I guess
---
People like you are why minorities are so hesitant to support socialism.
---
You still here? Cakesniffer
---
Is Malphite a league reference lmao
---
A lot of players buys them for pretty high prices to make a million stock of burnt food
---
that bird F I T
---
Because a bug is avoidable is a reason to not want it fixed? Man I wish I played as perfectly as you
---
Corn
---
Are Anglers decent money? I've read that sharks are the way to go for best exp rates and money. Idk though. Either way, thank you and early congrats to you too! We can model our capes together once we have them lol
---
no. We already have +15 accuracy staves and at +20 theres already the masterwand.
---
Alchables shouldnt be a good alternative to the more expensive staves.
---
Merch Pink Skirts

Oh no... it‚Äôs spreading

I got achievement diary cape. I pushed WC for a couple of days, 81-&gt;85 with magic trees. Was aids but worth! :)
---
Nah, just a cookie shape on that tuna to make it a shape of a fish to mess with our minds.  
---
Think about it.
---
Anything that's close and doesn't require slayer? 
---
yup because a 10% increase in fishing yield, a 10% gp buff for blood runes, and a 5% buff to mining dense ess isnt good
---
"Nicotine addiction" and then "Vape with mango flavor" i think
---
Im going with a Damp Tinderbox. 
---
Yeah the *gp/hr* is suspect, but think of the *memes/hr*.
---
Made me miss my cat/10
---
yep!
---
hope to see ya!
---
Do you want a nicotine addiction?
---
No? wtf?
---
What if its mango flavored?
---
Lol that's sick sign me up.
---
That's pretty much how the original went
---
Didn't know that was a ingredient... seems weird but could work
---
Dude they're having fun get the fuck over it. Just because you don't understand how it can be fun doesn't mean it's fun for no one.
---
Disclaimer : I haven't pked in 8 years, I'm total ass garbage now and don't even try. I still remember the fun I had even losing money. This is runescape, not efficiencyscape
---
Because the pit ideas introduced were not that great and they failed. They are open for new ideas.
---
Those a general diary rewards. This is a though to make the blessing actually useful outside slayer and a few teleports where the bonus is negligible. 
---
Ouch yeah you‚Äôre gonna have to merch or flip, your stats can‚Äôt help you at all
---
Telegrab wines of zammy

Back in my hayday we ran a small prostitution ring where we'd sell girlfriends for an amount of time. Slowly our business expanded and before we knew it we were making more money than we could handle. We were paying off pmods and some of our customers were even jagex staff. We had to close the trade after the introduction of the trade limit but we still kept a lot of the money.
---
On release? Bill(s)? 
---
They are ok for money. They aren't as good as they used to be. I would fish them before I got the cooking guantlet and the highest the got for raw was like 1.6k. now raws are 1458 and cook go for 1521. it can vary though with the active trade price. I'm on runelite and have the plug in to show the active price which helps out.
---
Why did they choose to do it that way, I already fixed a new totem just for that :C
---
In the past these kind of tasks never used to auto complete. Before some QOL updates you had to start the achievement diaries to be able to complete any, if you already finished a task it did not complete retroactively.
---
It's about building a large collection of burnt food.  Burnt food is actually somewhat uncommon since as you progress from 1-99 cooking you burn food less and less.  It's just a weird thing for wealthy RS players to spend money on, occasionally they might get an offer for the collection that makes it worth selling.
---
Yeet?
---
PvE death currently has no penalty.
---
Ramp/jump tomato/tomato Percocet/oxycodon lol 
---
I just want to open the world map then run completely the other way bc of this
---
It is BiS anywhere you use a Blessing that isn't GWD. And it is no risk unlike current blessings, even if the low end are only like 10K. It will be great for Slayer, Wildy Bosses, Zulrah... A pretty large portion of the game.
---
According to OP in another reply, "this method bypasses Google altogether. When using this, you'll search directly on the new wiki."

Where did you buy an adamant scimitar? Scimitar shops only sell up to mithril.

You don't even need to drop the untrimmed onr before buying a trimmed one. You only need to bother with the whole dropping business right as you hit another level 99.

I remember almost quitting cause I kept dying to the guards trying to free prince Ali. I didn‚Äôt know about RuneHq at the time :/

2 am but it doesn't matter, i can't dump an invitation to such a splendid party!

Chu say?

Vapes were mainly built for weed.

Someone gave me a veracs flail when I was like 12 (2006ish) And I didn‚Äôt know what barrows was and I had just become a member. And the guy told me it was the rarest item in the entire game. And I was just floored. Beyond belief. Then later I got hacked and lost it and quit for 2 years.

It‚Äôs a carved fish fillet to look like a fish.

Why is it worth 13m if it only adds +1 with +4 prayer?
---
Unlucky, could have been a white bead.
---
There‚Äôs a new one??

Dude uh... getting 99 skills isn't a huge thing anymore, it hasn't been for over 10 years haha. 
---
Meanwhile I got mine 2 days ago at 86 farming while checking my calquat tree... I totally forgot about the pet lol
---
I couldn't breathe when I read this
---
1. Set up a duel
---
2. Get random people to bet on the duel
---
3. Other duelist has better stats/equipment, so people bet on them
---
4. Plot twist: the whole thing has been set up
---
5. Rot bets on the "underdog duelist"
---
6. The seemingly better duelist lets the other guy win
---
7. Rot gains the money from the people they managed to lure in their betting scheme.

I‚Äôm a returning F2P from when I was in middle school. First time being a member. Members is like a whole new game

Yes

&gt;assuming an avg number of specs
---
No. I put in one hitting for the calc. Good catch. I did it again with 0 dwh hitting:
---
-Scythe over dhl by a measly .05 dps, with barrows gloves 
---
-Scythe over dhl by .35 dps, with ferocious gloves.

# YOU WILL LOSE

I played for about 6 months and passed my old character stats that took 3 years before quitting in 10
---
lol?
---
I started vaping to cut back on my weed smoking. Worked pretty well, doubt I'll quit either any time soon. Seriously, fuck those guys that vape to blow the "sickest clouds". Vaping isn't cool, it's just a crutch. 
---
Just did it today, i cant imagine what pain it would be without slayermusiq
---
But we all know they'll ace it. They almost always do : \^ )
---
are you retarded? those rewards are fucking dogshit lmao
---
Both
---
Why show their names then? Just want to shame them? You‚Äôre the jackass in this post.
---
Best in slot new dungeon boots. You have to use new boots in new slayer dungeon and granite boots upgrades those boots.
---
Yeah, I was pretty impressed
---
Would you know on top of your head what all potions you have? 
---
Yea this post doesn't really make sense
---
The numbers still go up though; only Lynx is free from the shackles 
---
Honestly and maybe contrary to popular belief you can get an easy as fuck solo raid if you spend enough time scouting for the easiest bosses. 
---
No spade for you. 
---
me and my friend had a similar idea weeks ago but had no idea of how to go about doing it, so you guys really are my heroes :')
---
I hear you and I understand you. I just find it fun to push things when it comes to certain areas. That‚Äôs just my taste. I can go smaller and such but with what I do, people don‚Äôt come to see that from me. Usually 
---
Sometimes, most of the time im at rogues
---
Dunno how people fall for this shit still. Regardless its sad to see twitch has no control over that, they let these scam streams stay up and take little action
---
settle down man, its the internet. don't take it so serious.
---
Talking about when you open the map, not click the mini-map, you dummy 
---
Ok tell you this.. I‚Äôm in full bis and using elder maul+claws+bgs I get every kill over armadyl+bp rdarts+rigour 
---
Where would you say i'm raging? 
---
Ive called no-one names like you did in your first comment and only shared this because i thought his rant was funny.

i wonder how fast F2P chaos rcing would be

nowadays traditional gender roles are more of a religious thing.

Its because time is convoluted

I guess I really have to watch it sometime

Once you get the stamina pool at 62 + Boost, it gets even better 
---
Would love for you to elaborate on the location for me!
---
Your machines Graphics Processing Unit probably is obsolete. Hence the crashing. 
---
Tele grabbing makes your cape stay untrimmed? What do?
---
Not sure why Jagex hasn't changed that value yet, but I can say with 100% confidence that changing that value doesn't affect anything with account security. I use **-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true** instead though on Linux, and you can also use that on Windows too (I found it gave better performance than the ddraw flag).
---
It's possible (but **very** unlikely) it may make the client unstable and crash randomly if for some reason your GPU or Windows OS doesn't handle hardware-accelerated DirectDraw well.
---
Nah mate me and hundreds of people are updating it. Just because the previous management had massive egos and jumped ship doesn't mean it had to end. 
---
It makes your prayer drain at a slower pace which is good if you‚Äôre doing something where you are constantly praying yet can‚Äôt bring so many PPots. Bursting would be a good example where you are praying because the monsters you burst will have no mage bonus and Seers won‚Äôt increase your max hit.
---
I think an uncharged trident of the seas is actually the cheapest option for +15 mage without autocast at the moment, but I agree that an even cheaper option would probably be a little too strong.
---
Get off my dick u lawn chair
---
You can get as many as you want
---
Rank 1 clue, BH and all the other minigames
---
Fearless sicknt right here
---
Mounting a glory was the most satisfying experience... Just really want to get that mahogany eagle lectern so I can make house tabs in my own place and then that's all I really need. That'll probably be it for construction on this acct.
---
nah you can keep getting all the items so if youre a bit lucky u can keep getting the good drops lol
---
Black Graceful. When?
---
tf2 was shit on release and it's even worse in 2019
---
somewhere in the middle (read: pyromania until love and war) it was great
---
not seeing the similarity
---
This entire comment is just too accurate 
---
The level required to make even the basic jewelry box is absurd... Not even gonna try shooting for it. 
---
Chaos runes are used in bulk for bursting

Pretty sure I've seen that meme in here before, can't find the link though

True, they don't need to destroy fire capes, I don't think they get anything for it...but they do.
---
I just assumed the numbers were similar enough to Ranarr for it not make too much of a difference. I might be horribly wrong but we might never know if Jagex doesn't give us the numbers as you can't really do a massive data set tests with lower levels as you will obviously be leveling up if you try. The tweet by Mod Ash did state that at least close to max lvl the numbers are very similar.
---
Lmao best kob meme yet 
---
Did you talk to Oziach?
---
Stealing Creations, Great Orb Project and Soul Wars was so much fun, they weren't really efficient i believe, but it was a great break and still doing something useful

addy darts and black dhide vs inferno max str elder maul
---
yeah, clawing ofc youll get kills, claws are insanely strong. using an elder maul at bandos is legit trolling unless you are doing a mass. 
---
He is eating Lasagna and bread.
---
What mini game?
---
Gz!
---
Nah, you can get multiple of them. Hell, I'm pretty sure you can get 2 of the same item in the same chance if you get lucky enough
---
It's kind of trivial though when catacombs are the best place to train slayer in most cases.
---
Wouldn't you just prayer flick?
---
I trio with a ranger always use elder maul and always get the kills 
---
Probably not extremely. It would probably be fastest to actually physically run to and from Edgeville.

Ultimate AFK? Ditch the Guthans and replace it for Obby/B-neck/Xil and BIS whatever else. https://imgur.com/5ufUPMb
---
Normal rumble with easy melee bosses. Depending on your starting stats and how often you will repot - 5 minutes or 20 minutes AFK, start with 28 or 32 doses of overload with the rest absorption. 
---
https://imgur.com/lFm8MUT
---
Guthans is dogshit AFK exp and with absorptions you're easily safe for 20 minutes if you're 60/60/60ish or better. IF you're going to be AFK for 20 minutes at a time then consider super combat pots in place of Overloads but I don't bother since they cost a bit.
---
cool story bud
---
&gt;However at the end of the day, that's the name of the game. Wildy is a fucking free-for-all, and i know what I'm getting myself into once I enter the wilderness.
---
That's something I like about RS compared to a lot of other MMO-type games.
---
There's Wilderness and there's not-Wilderness. If you want to take a risk for a reward, go do some wilderness stuff. If you don't want the risk, stay out of the wilderness and there's not a damn thing anyone can do to touch you. 
---
Why do I play both of these games 
---
:Pepekms:
---
I'd agree with that some times, but read what he said right there, and tell me you wouldn't tell someone to shut the fuck up if you heard that exit someone's mouth.
---
i like this idea

He's Runescape's god, higher and mightier than Guthix himself

The piece of hardware that is responsible for your devices graphics processing.

Well you‚Äôre saying to use a dwh at bandos üòÇ bud just go grab a rope scarf please 
---
83 Construction is one of the most useful milestones you'll ever reach on your account. 83 Con is probably the most valuable GP investment in the entire game.

What he lacks in core strength he makes up for in grace
---
Well that‚Äôs your opinion.
---
Fucken classic X'D
---
Go to youtube and look up "3 tick fishing" , you'll love it my man
---
Trying to talk about RS (or any video game's) logic lmao. How do you eat a whole shark in a second? 
---
That diary overall is pretty bad and it's good that they added this.
---
I was looking at mod Kiernan‚Äôs post and it says your drop will be remembered when there is a roll on the table. That‚Äôs why I am confused? 
---
People are so salty lmao 
---
coal bag is the most useful one in my opinion
---
and if you happen to regret, you can sell it back for 80 nuggets
---
I died in wildy yesterday and it made me ~~sad~~ frown for a couple seconds. 
---
Went to complete a Wilderness diary, set foot in KBD's lair without dragonfire shield, got burninated. I dun goof'd. 
---
Nice name, good to know Jed didn‚Äôt give RoT all the 1 and 2-letter names 
---
No, not really. IDK what they're talking about.
---
well yeah, i showed you it was better. and again, your reply was "lol i do bandos"
---
runescapes a solved game. the devs have given us an accurate combat formula, we get accurate monster stats from stat spy. this isn't an opinion thing.
---
Thanks :D - yeah my post got taken down quick for rule 6 or something.
---
Your gpu is good enough. Maybe go intl nvidia control thing and change some permissions. Runelite might take your cpu integrated graphics instead of your dedicated gpu.
---
I would have thought it would still be compatible with my gpu though, it's a Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 so not that old I don't think
---
When this happens to my pure I bring my main and ice barrage the crabs. They either leave or laugh at me for wasting my time and gp on them :D
---
Josh here, I'm 25 next month, can I get in?
---
&gt;So I saw the post earlier today about us leaking to the wallstreetbets sub
---
oh no
---
&gt;Fast forward yet again and I have a job in Finance
---
thank god
---
if you're going to be prayer flicking, then yes it's not useful. if you don't feel like bothering, it saves you a fuckload of money on ppots
---
January 10th. 
---
Everything in this blog, which includes that quest, is coming out then: http://services.runescape.com/m=news/poll-blog-the-kebos-lowlands?oldschool=1

It's about how much your card can take. 1 gb ect  
---
Ok I'll try that now ty
---
If you run away/south when a team logs in its normally a sign that you have bank loot on you.
---
Im actually gonna go this looks lit 
---
Because math isn‚Äôt damn experience. Why can I say I get every damn kill then? Why do I get those kills? If blowpipe is so good why am I out dpsing? 
---
Too many! Now we need 240 upvotes!
---
Buying r2h!
---
Hii I‚Äôm 42! üôÉare you on EUW for league¬ø
---
It's not "dominated" by men, women are just less interested in tech jobs lmao
---
What else would it be ?
---
Base 40's, 50 firemaking, 27 runecrafting and 28 ranged. Also do all f2p quests.
---
Someone's leaving that on now
---
Or.. I continue doing what I‚Äôm doing and save my precious time to do important things on my main while keeping my cannonballs stocked up. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Not really, because you can skip a lot of early levels by completing the quests
---
Can you stop spamming 1000 questions. Other people have questions too.
---
What's your CC?
---
It likely is and that's why he made 3 pairs of pants, I don't think that was intentional
---
Ahhh yeah I bet. That was the price from a couple weeks ago on the last time I looked em up. I saw and was like damn lol. But hopefully you‚Äôll get lucky soon enough too! 
---
Why do you suggest 50 fm? I feel like fm is slightly useless, unless it is needed in a minigame or quest?
---
Wintertodt minigame
---
What do you think about ironman accounts paying protection clans to farm revs? The ironmen have to use another account to trade the protection money, and the benefit is massive, due to the supplies and cash dropped by revs. It seems against the spirit of the game mode.
---
Ahh gotcha thank you
---
You seem to think a cball alt is more valuable simply because you need cballs. It's still no more valuable than 200-300k per hour. You can easily get 2-3x that from a pvm alt. The only advantage to a cball alt is how easy it is to start up
---
It is against the rules. And the exchange rates are set up loosely based on the bond GE values, but you lose gp trading between either game, of course, which is where the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù sites make their money (because the RWT that ‚Äúprofit‚Äù for actual profit).
---
Ridiculous rng lol 
---
Brine sabre due to its speed.

I feel for you

Thanks! I was aiming for about 40+ in everything... only have Crafting, Smithing, and FMing to go.
---
ya done good kid, ya done good. \*slow clap\*
---
T. 1200 total shitkid
---
But a whole baked potato with butter, corn, and fish? That's a whole plate minimized to one thing 
---
More respectable than a bought skill (crafting/fletching/cooking/smithing) but I dont think most people care. Mining isnt an extremely useful cape either as its 5% chance on bonus ore up to adamantite. So maybe some people will but if you enjoy mining then make it your first 99 dont let how respectable it is stop you, unless you wanna make it cooking then it should stop you.
---
Bro... whips are 70 atk. Tentacles need 75, but abyss is the one ppl use for slyer training.
---
how? you literally can't afk at all while remaining effecient so youre just right click, left click, 2 , right click, left click, 6  repeat for hours .....i can't stand it personally.
---
Brutal black dragons have both of those items on their regular drop table. It's not very rare at all
---
Is that not fireworks? I thought you got fireworks every level
---
It didn't pass the poll.

tbf, the same can be said about smoking
---
Quiet! You're giving away my money  making secrets boii
---
Barb assault was very fun for me, but I understand your point. 
---
I know its a small change but find a way to calculate the farming cape perk into the numbers?
---
Someone‚Äôs been doing the western diaries. Literally did this yesterday and made blurberry specials
---
Needs more skin
---
Wow, a literal idiot. 
---
Considering if thats a whole fish, thatd be more than a whole plate anyways. The other way around, have you never heard of a ‚Äúloaded‚Äù baked potato?
---
Wow bud you're such a cool guy wow wow
---
Swan song
---
Goals
---
Which coincidentally, is the two numbers after 24 in the value of your chest.
---
Happy right, you‚Äôre holy cake day shit
---
I would say its respectable. But I think the most visually appealing untrimmed capes are untrimmed slayer and untrimmed hp
---
This should be Achievements too lol
---
Lol well it was good gp in f2p and it became my highest skill. And now im at 88 and figure might as well finish it out . 
---
Why does the cactus patch, when checking its health, plays some weird flute audio? What is the purpose of it? Why is it there? What does it mean?
