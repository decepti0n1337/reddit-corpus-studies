The people of the UK never agreed to join the EU, the people of the UK voted to leave the EU. Democracy is only honored when it goes the way of those in power.
---
Well you cant trade items off an account until they have 24 hour play time or 7qp. It could be a bot farmer setting his bots up with 24hr play time
---
Jeez you trumpster are pathetic. No one is crying besides your clown president on Twitter everyday.

---
It's OK you can be racist dude no one cares. You're not gonna accomplish anything in your life and no one cares about your miserable existence. So keep playing runescape and spending all day on reddit and let the rest of us fix the country your kind messed up k?

Wow nice.

Can you please tell me which bosses and mode you used? I really want to go for 99 attack and strength.
---
Also, what was your setup?
---
I do with it was that easy.
---
??????????????? Try again. It def. Has a use for them
---
You really don‚Äôt even need to start with ranarrs. They don‚Äôt shine until your farming skill is up a bit and you consistently see larger yields. Limpwurts, harralanders and yanillian hops if you‚Äôre all in are all profitable with a much smaller cash investment for lower level accounts.
---
It's not as simple as that, the UK after joining developed its economy as a service based rather then a manufacturing one which relies on the EU it would be a hard job to negotiate a correct deal and I have no faith in the 2 main partys
---
Didn't know there was one. thanks :)

Nice

Rune darts are almost never worth it.
---
ADDY DARTS VS RUNE DARTS Note: all prices are relevant to when this post was made. Future changes in dart and scale prices will impact the numbers below.
---
CPT = cost per tick DPS = damage per second TVC = time value correlation
---
CPT
---
CPT(rune) = (1079/5+169*2/3)/2 = 164.233gp
---
CPT(addy) = (140/5+169*2/3)/2 = 70.333gp
---
DPS
---
Sample: max setup against Zulrah's blue phase
---
DPS(rune) = 8.403801012
---
DPS(addy) = 8.052298008
---
Ratio of DPS(addy):DPS(rune) = 1:0.958
---
3600-0.958*3600 = 151.2 seconds
---
For every hour the addy dart user spends, the rune dart user saves 2 mins 31.2 secs.
---
TVC
---
3600/0.6 = 6000 ticks 3448.8/0.6 = 5748 ticks
---
CP6000T(addy) = 6000*70.333 = 421,998gp
---
CP5748T(rune) = 5748*164.233 = 944,011gp
---
The rune dart user is spending 522,013gp to save 151.2 seconds.
---
The rune dart user is spending 12,428,881gp to save 1 hour.
---
Unless your best moneymaker that you actually do makes over 12,428,881gp/hr, then rune darts are not cost efficient to use (this specific TVC value is unique to using rune vs addy darts at zulrah. Against lower def monsters this value will increase slightly. Against higher def monsters this value will decrease slightly.)

Yeah I didn't like ZMI cos it's slow as well. Eventually I started doing more than an hour every day at lavas, just to finish off the grind. It should only be like a 10-12 hour grind, which isn't the worst thing in the world. You can do it!
---
This is an old chart.
---
Don't feel that way, these bots will all be banned after the weekend.
---
Also you should just play for your own personal enjoyment it doesn't really matter what other people do in the game as long as you are having fun :)
---
lmao fortnite is like the seven billionth title released within the battle royale genre. Massive pepega
---
Does anyone have suggestions for any relatively obscure drops from monsters that are 100% drop chance? Items you wouldn't have in your bank normally (aside from quests)
---
All that comes to mind is Rock and Elemental Ore from Earth Elementals and Monkey Corpse from Karamjan monkeys.
---
Something that wouldn't fit what I'm looking for would be something like 'Vial of Water' from Water Elementals. While it is a relatively unique 100% drop, it's still fairly common to have.
---
Thanks for any input.

Can someone explain to me how the items on death system actually work? I know I protect 3 items, but for certain items like blowpipe, it says that I would drop it on death, but when I die it stays in my inv. I'm just confused and I would like some clarity

in most situations you want to prioritize dps over defense

The fact that people can trade bonds that are already in the game multiple times is completely wrong?

Alrighty.

Cool, ty.

Every 99 is worth celebrating! Congrats!

damn thats amazing

How do I add a flair? I'm seeing this subreddit has no flairs
---
Ah man, a post devolving into politics. Great. You know, youtubers like valefisk meme ben shapiro and no one ever goes on political rants in his comment sections. Politician in meme =\= political meme. Keep it in good fun guys, we can talk about politics elsewhere.
---
Don't be picky with supplies use them whenever you think you need them. Don't die with a full inventory of supplies you'll learn a lot more and a lot faster in the higher waves. Good luck!

I just picked up a truck full of bots outside the home depot. Got em picking flax for me right now.

Not gonna lie the moment I hit 77RC was one of the most satisfying moments I've had on OSRS, it was one of the most painful grinds by far. If zeah RC didn't come out I'd probably still be like 40 runecrafting because fuck doing RC the normal way all the way to 99

Hmm. I always do jad task. Haven't had a smoke devil task yet either. I've always just killed Abby's and ankou with melee and cannon dags.

None of those seem easily burstable to me but idk

Does anyone have the green screen of the bot dancing. Assuming OP doesn't since it's an old repost

Well, in the EU they have at least they‚Äôd have vote in what regulations and standards are made into law. Out of the EU they still have to follow those same laws if they wish to have access to the European market but now they‚Äôll have no vote.

Dissin' the brain trust by showing he can airband to Poison... I should rewatch scrubs for the 5th time...

Well I think generally we do you this quite well, it's just a vocal minority that sets us off course. A shame really
---
Konar is good for gp. Duradel is good for boss tasks. I‚Äôve personally never used Neive/Steve
---
Can you turn in noted bones? If so it would be pretty easy to snag the 5 minute record with that amount of bones + mahogany tables or whatever. iirc the 5 minute record is really just one 6 hour log-in session, no?
---
Because his tasks are aids, even if you get a good assignment it can be a shitty location.
---
But it depends on what you want, just doing it for money? He might be better than duradel
---
You can choose the most optimal location for doing tasks. Whether that be a denser spawn or doing a boss variant of the task.
---
Okay thank you
---
I would consider a game as old as the day it released, even if you couldn't play it in that state for a period of time

Rune fest will be packed with crab clothes I bet lol

Just download the apk

It's not a Jad task, he's barraging multiple of the tzhaar NPCs. Same with Abby demonsm
---
I‚Äôd the more correct course of events was h1z1 came after arma br, got a tiny amount popular, playerunknown created pubg, it blew the fuck up middle 2017, fortnite pulled a super fast 180 on their shitty single player game and made br mode (and made it f2p), then every other dev realized with the insane popularity of both games they would be dumb to not at least attempt to cash in. I have a love hate relationship with pubg with its ups and downs over the years... fortnite blows though. I really don‚Äôt care anyone says or claims it‚Äôs a meme or whatever, the game is objectively not good and punishes actually good FPS players... hence why it isn‚Äôt popular amongst actually good FPS players (notice shroud rarely plays it for example...)
---
So the top is the source image, bottom is my clue. I've solved it three different times now, it never gets recognized as solved, as logging out or hopping world's rescrambles it. Talking to the npc who gave it to me just have them say their normal dialogue, and using it on said npc does nothing.
---
Any ideas?

Damn these memes be getting old brah

Bot some essence mining
---
The cheapest phat was way more than 90m back in 07 already. At that point purples were i believe around 180m? I remember because I won big staking at some point in 2007 and did several p hat stakes. First win being a purple and next was my fav p hat (red) which was 225m i think. 
---
Tbh its been 6 years already and p hats are still so cheap. Its a shame that they keep releasing so many into the game. It was fun having rares like that be expensive and showing off. Rsc started in what 2001 so 6 years to 2007 and look how expensive rares were, and that's with the phat dupe back near when they first released and pink phat was a thing. I miss rsc lol. The 3 hit combat system was fun for PvP. Pvm wise the game wasnt that great. But it was great fun for PvP. Also the holiday drops were hype. I remember when crackers dropped, people randomly using them on you and id somehow end up with a p hat in my inven just standing in a bank. Halloween masks and santas were prob my fav events though as i remember them much better. Spent so many hours just running around waiting for the random masks/santas to be dropped. Seeing that blue text across the top saying something like "merry Christmas etc etc" lol (i think at least. I know a message broadcasted before santas spawned randomly). Ah man me and my brother were out hunting for hours. 
---
The games in a different state now so i understand it, but still they have brought way to many "rares" into the game making none of them rare. 6 years and blue p hat is 20k. Sad times.

damn, not even high alch :(

Depending on the build of android that your tablet uses, you may not be able to see it. You might have to update the OS version. The Google Play store is very similar to the iOS app store where different versions/hardware see different catalogs.
---
Its literally the exact same as every other BR game. All 30 of them.

Now maybe they can improve their customer support.

honestly with the right click chase option its faster and more afk to just kill normal rats when you want a specific spice imo you can kill 4 in the time you'd kill 1 behemoth at the least

Whelp, gg. I went full autismode. I guess there is a void offhand in RS3. I was googling about void and someone said that void offhand and barrows gloves was better, but I had wanted to get other options.
---
blurite has always been a bit of an outlier. it was introduced for the Knights Sword but for some reason they added it into the progression for crossbows and then did nothing else with it. Very strange. Not surprised it's coded differently/incorrectly given that it's not a traditional metal

Tagging along this comment thread to say that I'm experiencing it as well. Let us know if this problem has persisted in the 20 days since you've posted this thread or if you got some official response from jagex
---
Not sure if demi-bosses count but you could try your hand at 3-iteming Crazy Archaeologist or barraging Dust Devils in the catacombs. 
---
Alternatively you could make Arceuus teleport tabs. It's profitable mage XP, just do the highest level you can as long as the margins aren't shit.
---
With ultra the minimum should be 6, and minimum is 5 with super.  Anything less than that and you missed the compost.  I've never had that issue and I almost always check my chat box for the ultra compost message.

I want an iron Man mode were it's a normal account but you can't use the grand exchange and can only trade with other people that are the same as you. Kinda locking you into a pre grand exchange game.

As for vorkath, sure bgs is better, but if you're blowpiping, dwh is not terrible.

Are you using runelite? There is a death indicator plug in

If you can‚Äôt do vorkath or Zulrah or revs or like any other money maker

I was, bc of it being a dc it didn‚Äôt work though.

Guilty as charged, done this before. One of **the** worst feelings.

---
Way better than Zuhaar
---
People think Zulrah is more fun. You also get like half the kills per hour with bp vs dhcb at vorkath.
---
The main difference is that the entire Vorkath fight is random so you have to be alert the whole time, but it's also incredibly boring to grind for hours. Meanwhile Zulrah has a set of predetermined rotations it picks from, so once you know the rotations you're basically on auto pilot for that fight
---
its when you do repetitive tasks faster than theyre intended to be done. for instance, smithing normally takes 5 ticks (3 seconds) per object, but for some reason blurite takes 3 ticks (1.8 seconds) per object. the video is a parody though, as the whole point of tick manipulation is to increase xp rates, but blurite is such bad xp that this would never be worth it
---
I mean yea it's just runescape idk why people think its hard. But nice :)

Please make more! You're really talented!

Yeah I just started playing the newest assains creed today (funny enough it is also titled odyssey) and the micro transactions just feel out of place to attract whales and make more cash. You don't need to use them at all. You can just buy items to use in the game or buy skill points. Or you can just, you know, play the game.

Cause that and the snow biome wintertodt resides in is by far my favourite location on Zeah; it and the activities you do on it feel like they've always existed for some reason. Like some kind of "Lunar Island"-esque frontier
---
If u see my dude on the 750 total US world in the red Gucci with the dreads, just know that it's not a bot

You actually might be on to something there from a sociological standpoint. It's not like it's harsh to point out that us who played for years are in a certain social bracket.   
---
    
---
At my school there was a girl who didn't look amazing by most standards and was kinda picked on and shunned at the start of secondary school. She matured pretty quickly and became one of the better looking girls in the year and very quickly she was adored by almost everyone and became, by my judgement, a complete slut. People will usually overcompensate when they are presented something that they previously wanted but could not obtain.    
---
People also really don't like their behaviour being examined hence the downvotes.
---
(this subreddit in a nutshell)
---
Shit I‚Äôm iron man and am dreading the plank make with butler method, maybe this can be a good alternative depending where I buy/get the runes
---
Lol there are two rules of Ironman mode that I have learned:
---
1) Don't put 'Fe', 'Iron', or 'Solo' in your name.
---
2) Never talk.
---
In the mid/late-game your gear alone will not be a dead giveaway that you're an Ironman. The more you talk, the more you're openly inviting people to crash you. It sucks since I'm fairly social, but Slaying/PVMing in silence has made getting crashed a much less frequent occurrence for me these days.
---
He would have gotten the onion ring
---
Weird. It might have been a glitch or a bug because my full inventory disappeared.
---
I think their point is that since bursting is so popular, with other options existing for killing these things, one should just go to the more private areas if they opt for single combat on the most popular to burst task.
---
It was a social observation more than an insult. If you made you emotionally react then that's something to dwell on not something to be defended against.
---
It's a great song and just as good as many of the classics.  Often I find the songs of new areas kind of suck probably because they weren't made by Ian Taylor, but this track really stands up
---
8 hours for that one day is nothing for runescape.. people regularly play for far unhealthier times than that
---
Let's get some shoes
---
Oh no definitely, I agree. You don't "own" a single-way area like gargoyles. I hate entitled people like that. You're not getting crashed if you can only kill one at a time anyway.
---
Was speaking more about the people who whine in multi I guess. Just move on, crashers will always crash you.
---
Sea Shanty 2 is unlockable in F2P
---
Talk to people obviously, the WT chat is the best part of the game.
---
8 if you get 3.5-4m an hour, really not long by runescape standards
---
You don't *have* to do it in a day, just saying someone definitely could with average/no luck.
---
thats a fugly looking paint
---
You still profit...
---
Haha, DAE Jagex customer support sux?!1?

Not worth it, it's a waste of runes and butler is fast enough. It's also slower due to cast delay. Cash is plentiful in mid-game and late-game Ironman so 83 Construction should easily be achievable from grinding 87 Slayer.

Sometimes I lightly tap men on the shoulder and they explode. It's really nbd if I tie one up and toss him in the pot.

This is pretty cool tbh

This **is** my discussion. It's a two way conversation and I opened with the topic. Thank you for participating.

Thanks!! I will!
---
I think he should be the beginner clue pet
---
&gt;Tiers don't mean shit in osrs
---
this is just a word. The idea is that items that require higher level (are higher tier) should be more powerful than  items with lower requirements (lower tier).
---
Of course it make no sense in OSRS because like you said barrows(70) is worse than bandos(65). 
---
So in this case OP want to bandos to be bandos to have higher requirements or put barrows at lower requirements.
---
Again it make no sense because for specific it varies activities how  good bandos is over barrows items.
---
Asked this on the QA before and basically they said ‚ÄúIf it impacts player experiences negatively we can change it‚Äù, not sure why it hasn‚Äôt been removed yet with that in mind. it was supposed to be a temporary measure when people afk‚Äôd in the instance to purposely grief people but thats not an issue now

by making weapons useful for certain situations, not by shoveling power creep into it because "it is higher level so it should trash out old weapons"

At this point, all protection prayers should be combined into one to make the game more casual.

I will no longer engage with someone who thinks wikipedia is a reliable source. It's like arguing with an idiot (aka right winger), they just drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.

Just wait for that 3rd referendum, don't cry at the result though ;)
---
also be aware of if youre in a single or multi combat area. if youre in single try running into mobs. theyll attack the pker which prevents them from attacking you
---
if youre in multi you should probably not try to be in multi because a solo pker in multi almost always has a team and those arent easy to escape
---
That's how they reel you in

Shout outs to the pker who asked if I had the master clue book, then when I said no asked me if I was sure. I said  I was. He wished me good luck.

I really didnt have the book. I had a spade a stam pot and a home tele tab. I got the casket from that. You missed out on some purple sweets and a rune kite. PM me and ill give you the split lol.

Somehow I think a Gorgon would play a little differently than peaceful elementals

Do the quests, they give you favour boosts and increase the rate at which you gain. These days its way easier because you dont lose favour when you gain it elsewhere
---
What points per xp can I get at nmz? Want to imbue black mask at the least with minimum cost gain
---
You're going to struggle to get them down without 75s and trident/blowpipe
---
I totally see, where your coming from. Even though I'm not in a 100% agreement with you, but that won't be my point. It's okay for different people to have different opinions.
---
I think the 3rd party clients thing is a real issue. I mean, they are so "standard" that polls don't pass because the feature is already existing in a 3rd party client. This mentality is problematic.
---
The botting-thing is very interesting since they (technically) have the software-side of the solution kind of in their hands already. They did the bot nuke in rs3 and it totally fucked the economy. This makes it kind of problematic to introduce it quick in osrs. Also i don't know, if its fully compatible to osrs (i don't think so).
---
Also the efficiency &gt; fun is weird. I force myself to play the way how i want and it's awesome.
---
This is just my stance to some of your points. I don't disagree to all of your other points but to some of some extent, but that doesn't matter right now.
---
I'm pro group ironman and it's okay and totally valid for you to be against it.

Max efficiency slayer you only do smoke devils, dust devils, nechs, baby black dragons, dark beasts, and I think dagannoths. Everything else is blocked or skipped.

Suspicious level 99? Reddit comment never explain the real situation, it is always some anxious exaggerating victim role for worthless karma. For 2 years now I have an ironman with "iron" in my name but never experienced this.
---
RS3 and OSRS are a different game
---
Do you still get XP drops in those skills?
---
That's not drama it's just sad
---
I used the teaks you go through Mos le harmless dungeon to get to.

Yeah but my old account was played on/made back in 2005? How can we not access it if it was made back then??
---
They bots
---
Seems like you're experiencing one of the seven stages of grief; Denial.
---
Nerds downvote every other
---
OSRS started in 2013 so you never had an account in OSRS
---
The sleeping bags were implemented poorly in the games infantry. The words used to solve these were saved in text format in the client and bot makers skipped them until the pasted text worked. I think, the user-base did not freak out over the method, but the implementation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I do not see what proxy's have to do with this.
---
The person creating these tens of thousands of accounts would have to manually enter their captcha if this method worked.
---
From the captcha services I see, they boast a 90% accuracy.
---
To say that my suggestion would not effect the user is false, as the user would need to purchase one of these solvers. Increasing the price of the accounts they sold would make botting, even just the slightest, more expensive.
---
you can do solo rex really easily if you wanna cheese it
---
Get the first few levels through quests. For example fairy tale part I gives farming xp and you can do fairy rings by starting part II with none of the reqs
---
I knew exactly which one it would be before I even clicked it!
---
every acc start with skills at lvl 1. Even if you had maxed account in 2007.
---
grind for 12 hours and make the same progress i do in 1 hr but have 12x as fun, interesting trade off
---
half of the player count is bots thats "???"
---
OSRS is a relatively new game launched in 2013, but based on the game as it was in 2007. Everyone started from scratch in OSRS.  
---
RS3 is the original game, continuously developed over the last 18 years.
---
And pigs can fly. Try again.
---
Should the midgame be focused on raising combat skills and then come back to questing? I see a lot of quests that require you kill mobs that are over level 100. 
---
Is there any other way of gearing except for crafting and buying the items? Are there like farm spots where I could get full sets of runic or adamantite?
---

content is not broken. There are bad and good tasks so you have things that you can spend points on.

yeah yeah and everyone who triple eats your 80 tick spec is an AHKer we‚Äôve heard it before
---
That's hard to estimate because the points given depend on how many monsters you have enabled and what monsters. For instance when I'm dharoking I have 5 big monsters enabled and I'm in NMZ usually for 2h and 15m (28 doses of overload). I average 600k points per run, so that'd be around 280k ish per hour and my xp/h is 110k so if we say per 100k xp you get 250k points which in turn is about 1xp per 2.5 points or something like that. Points per xp would probably be significantly increased if you also used the power ups.
---
r/woosh
---
He's obviously making a joke about how jagex adds things like tbow or bp, which are clearly higher than 75th tier, but puts them there to "negate" powercreep
---
And Slayer? That's literally half, like he said
---
I play both
---
We used to do this. Go around my friends house and play runescape on my mates dads laptop while he did it on the family computer. They were good days of standing in the wild collecting adamant arrows for the whole day.
---
its not a description its a category. staff should be the category
---
But explaining this to your average OSRS player seems rather hopeless, seeing their obsession with any way of calculating a droprate that looks impressive and gives them a reason to complain about not getting x drop instead
---
In the future I plan on making a rune dragon alt to make money while I‚Äôm playing on my main passively. Maybe I‚Äôll make that account have 80 slayer. If I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm more so interested in the play style and xp rates you get with an alt and pushing slayer to the limit. I find it really interesting. I‚Äôm not fussed about getting post 99 slayer, just the mechanics etc.
---
The exp rate is so good you really can‚Äôt expect to be afk, you actually have to pay attention and play the game it‚Äôs shocking I know
---
?
---
Maybe throw in why you think that if you want a decent discussion next time.
---
You're so fucking braindead. If you don't understand your comment was never gonna be understood as talking about rs3 unless you mentioned it, you lack the mental capacities to have a conversation with a 5 year old kid. You're the one who needs to do some simple thinking to realize that you were the one who had to specify what you meant. 
---
AND EVEN IF YOU DID, 200m all in rs3 is so fucking far from 200m osrs, literally no one cares, and it's not relevant in this discussion WHATSOEVER. How does it feel to be so fucking dumb?
---
I did and it didn't answer my question

If you use super antifire and a ward you shouldn‚Äôt pray mage because your dfire protection is maxed
---
Looks like Wii remotes tho
---
Get mage up and do zulrah... Ideally want slayer up first for a trident.
---
If you have any amount of spare cash currently, it's extremely worthwhile to start on the alt right away. Be aware that NMZing up the melees to 99 is a huge majority of the time requirement for the alt; questing only takes a week or two if you have the gp to fund it on teleports and stams. In comparison NMZ takes 2-6 weeks, depending on how much you can do per day and how tryhard you do it.
---
If you have any questions on making a RDA, feel free to ask, I'm finishing mine in the next week so the memory of everything is fresh. In particular slayer is very unique as getting the 69 slayer req for MM2 (optional, but 10% gph increase for rds) can be very heavily optimized for a lot less money than if you do the guide mindlessly.
---
25_buttholes is a fucking legend, looking like him is a compliment.
---
You can do it without infernal cape ye.
---
It's not the same instance.  The idea is that since the Def drop makes such a huge difference when you're blowpiping, it's better to just restart and try again if you miss rather than have a much slower kill.
---
are you filling it to max then banking or banking every inventory?
---
Oh and my switch I use for bgs is fire cape, void melee helm, warrior ring (I). I personally use the warrior ring over the berserker ring here for the slash attack bonus. I‚Äôm 99 range and will continue the kill with less than ideal specs, but I hardly ever splash with the setup.
---
Don't use rune darts, use addy instead.
---
Bring a melee switch with a BGS to spec Vorkath's health down.

Use Eagle Eye, and eventually Rigour once you can afford it

slayer alt is an alt account that mostly specialises in efficient slaying and then typically stopping at significant milestones to farm the slayer monsters for a decent low effort gp/hr - wyverns, gargoyles &amp; abby demons are the main 1s. Slayer alts usually avoid doing quests that unlock poor xp/hr tasks, examples are Dragon Slayer, Lost City, Cabin Fever, Olaf's Quest.

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for more is an actual consequence to death to a non-Ironman account. Don‚Äôt want to restrict myself just want people to know I haven‚Äôt died on it. Weird flex I know.

I hop

Not at my levels sadly :/

Maybe instead of the account getting wiped, you just permanently lose all items not kept on death. So you wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to your death pile or collect from zulrah/vork
---
Woah calm down bro

Why even play the game? Just do vorkath? Farm runs are inefficient, do vorkath. Why play castle wars for fun if you could be doing vorkath? Why do vorkath when you could make all of that in 10 seconds at the duel arena? Vorkath super inefficient.

No it shouldnt, rofl. Woodcutting and firemaking are too very different skills. Woodworking? You mean construction? Or is that also woodworking now? And fletching? Also woodworking? All 4 of them are different skills. 
---
Hey can we remove attack, strength, defence, hitpoints, prayer, ranged magic and just call it Ze mega combat skill.

You are either joking or have really bad reading comprehension.

Pot up son !
---
I'm not sure, I have never swapped myself before. I always see people recommending this cc though, so I assume it's legit
---
u actually stupid lmao
---
You can do a fuckton with firemaking people just lack imagination. Thats not reason to introduce garbage like wintertodt. You could have an ice boss where you would have to make a bonfire in the middle of the room and the closer proximity you are to the fire the less environmental damage you take, the more damage you deal to the boss, less vulnerable you are to its hits etc. things like that, have a boss where you have to light torches around the room to be able to see the boss the better torches you light (better torches require higher firemaking) the longer they last and the brighter they shine.
---
Now if only we could pass the playerbase on PC.

Honestly, not really, in my opinion. They really removed a lot of the charm that the first one had. And some of the QoL updates just take away more of the charm. I haven't played that far in but I don't  think they have an option to listen to the original soundtrack which imo sounds better. The fighting is still great, and it's pretty much the same game, otherwise.

I got this immediately and while reading I hoped this guy would follow through with an osrs version all the way through the quite and this guy did not disappoint! Lol
---
But it was actually his 1st mage hit, but you're like "oh, i must have meant his 2nd or third MAGE hit" so you switch to range because his mage hits are probably over
---
Into what consideration? Into removing wintertodt?

Yeah I have that on page 11 in my Things That Will Never Happen 4 Starters

Are there any super stupid simple lvl1+ Slayer guides out there? I'm a new player returning from playing back when Slayer first came out, I haven't played in like 8+ years. There's a lot of stuff that gets thrown around that I don't quite understand yet and it makes it hard to find a good basis of where to begin, as I just remade an account and kinda just wanna roll through Slayer. Obviously I want the most efficient XP grind, and in general what equipment would be best and etc. Youtube videos, reddits, forums--- anything and as many as would do well for early through mid through high levels ranges. I literally have no idea what half these bosses are.

The Fisher King‚Äôs Realm is near the Freaky Forester random event, I believe.

1 comment apparently but i see nothing, is somebody here shadowbanned?

Take manta rays, a super combat cuz it'll bosst your bgs soec and give ya decent defence aswell
---
Wait, do you not?
---
I noticed that, too. I thought it was more like "The mourners aren't bad people because they were born into an environment in which this behavior is considered normal".
---
I got 99 slayer with 97 attack, 97 strength, and 94 defense. My magic is 96 and range is 99.
---
What have you done with your runelite client? For some reason it just looks better and smoother graphically than mine
---
The first half of your comment is the first thing I have read from this post have any sway on my opinion. Thank you for the insight.
---
I cannot however agree that "literally everything" I listed does not require engine work. I can, however, now see how a player ID system is important to the future of the game though.
---
Again, this has been the most insightful response. Thank you.
---
Clearly your knots are sub-sailor standard. I‚Äôm sure your fuses are as well.
---
It's around 1/1,000,000,000 i reckon
---
If you mean directly from level 1, here‚Äôs how you efficiently start it. Do shadow of the storm and put the 10k xp into range to skip from 1 to 27 or 28. At this point I would use a bone cbow until 30, and then do animal magnetism. With the attractor, buy a bunch of mith darts (super cheap and much better xp than other options you have) and sit at sand crabs until 70-75. Could also switch to msb(i) or rune knives part way through if you‚Äôd like. This is where there‚Äôs a lot of options depending on your overall goal. If you just want 99 range asap start mm2 and chin. If you want to be macro efficient and progress towards max use a cannon for slayer tasks and sometimes a blowpipe. Blowpipe in nmz is also very cheap and alright xp. If you like bossing you could get around 85-90 and then get the rest of xp from stuff like zulrah, which is what im doing on one of my accounts.
---
R u me

My best friend and I would chop yews behind varrock palace. We aimed to make 100k a day. Eventually we made enough, he bought rune g, I bought saradomin rune armor. Then we started flipping rune t and g sets and felt like big ballers.

Good times.

after a hiatus i always hop into wildy slayer for a bit to get a nice point boost and some emblems, which are going for around 180k now. slayer helm imbue is a must, you can get it in a few hours at nmz. firecape shouldn‚Äôt be a problem with a blowpipe and your range lvl, but ardy cloaks aren‚Äôt a bad alternative until then. other than that a cheap set of proselyte armour, rune gloves,  rune boots, /black dhide/snakes/bgloves, and a glory is perfect for all your wildy needs. get a black dragon task and you can do kbd to warm up with a low stress boss with decent drops. black slayer helm is also bis fashionscape. you can leave the rest of your money to work for you in the ge until you need to use.
---
99 firemaking doesn't make you any better at making fires than 1. A normal log is BIS lmao
---
Resources were added to drop tables to devalue bots. It‚Äôs much easier and reliable to make bots that skill instead of do high level pvm.
---
Safespotted tho
---
it's getting too invasive imo. one of these days I'm gonna be hanging out with some friends and acquaintances and realize one of the acquaintances is an ad.
---
"You've spent x days, hours, and minutes in the world since arriving y days ago" yes its tracked.
---
It used to be more profit for just the flax because people would buy it to train their crafting. This was before zulrah dumped all the flax any1 would ever use in the market. This was even pre GE I used to sell it to people in seers bank
---
Copy paste in paint then mirror the image
---
Resources were devalued by adding to drop tables on purpose to devalue bots. Otherwise bot farms would make a ton more money.
---
i have twitter by the same name
---
Painted this cos it was my all time favourite thing to do back in the day (on my account that is now RS3)
---
Why are there so many bots in this game? Having a hard time getting my mining up when there's a bunch of lvl 3s with rune pickaxes..
---
can I get some of that generosity of strangers
---
why isn‚Äôt everything in this game 6m/hr üò°
---
Are you eating when you can be DPSing? That‚Äôs a problem a lot of people have is they lose tics panic-eating instead of doing it during the special attack phases. Tbh don‚Äôt even need to BGS spec at your range level and you can fill those spots with food. Should be getting 2-3 kills per trip
---
Dooyyyy I‚Äôm brain dead. But why does he multiply the scale price by 2/3? Shouldn‚Äôt it be 1/3 cause that‚Äôs how many scales you use a shot?
---
At the current time of posting this, I did not have a strong enough opinion to make a fully fleshed out statement of my thoughts. Which is why I communicated with the commentators to further build on what I believe.
---
Furthermore, I do believe I had a decent discussion with most of the commentators of my post. They have helped to sway my opinion to be in favor of the engine work that would allow these sort of things to be possible.
---
While I still do not agree that group iron is a good idea, the reason being the very few who will commit, I do agree that the engine work for grouping players and further ID system improvements will help in the future development of the game.
---
I just fell into  that trap on my last (2nd) run, somehow made it to Jad anyways and then went bottom up after missing the switches fml
---
I see you've watched his most recent video, too.
---
One day, after inviting you to a concert your friend will break down and have to be sent back to ticketmaster for repair.
---
It made training the skill less of a pain but the skill itself is still 100% useless

God I remember fishing for 4.4k sharks just to afford a whip. Power leveled at Shiloh to get the stats for sharks then went on vacation with family then grinded sharks for a whip.

Yeah wtf is this tomfoolery

I thought we chose brown armour at the end of Goblin Diplomacy

Hi there.

The login servers do seem to be having a few issues today. Other people have had similar problems.
---
Jagex are aware.
---
umm??
---
Didn‚Äôt even know you could compost after planting
---
No probs bud, whats your ign? Mine is m8ofm8s, add me ;p
---
Pretty sure everyone knows about a +5 stew boost by now
---
You gotta walk.
---
Gz on using an Orange spicy stew.
---
Oh no not at all it‚Äôs just crazy that he manages to get 99 without chinning or cannoning and didn‚Äôt get Xp from killing bosses. Didn‚Äôt mean to sound like such an elitist
---
People like playing RS by not playing it. That's why people use bots. Doing the same thing over and over isn't fun for everybody but reaching level 80 and getting to use better armor is. 
---
There's absolutely no gameplay after you get into grind phase. Just numbers that grow when you spend time "playing it". Exactly like idle clicker games.
---
Didn't go down the last step. 
---
Literally unwatchable
---
I remember being a kid and my mom only letting my brother and I play for an hour , so we would walk to the library and play on the computers there. She always thought we went to pick up  books.
---
Not sure on the issue. At lvl just pray mage. Focus everyone else and leave the mager til last since you cant take damage from it. Once all the monsters are out, you should use them to strap one another and focus the rangers and bats first. I remember my first Cape was confusing as hell lol. I'd also try to be on task with slayer helm (i) if that's a possibility for you. Good luck with the Cape mate!
---
Making a physical robot should be ok, so this should be fine
---
For a normal account, this is worse efficiency than just buying them. Finding and using is exactly equivalent to buying in terms of money since you're giving up the opportunity to sell it. The only difference is your money maker is worse.
---
Monster examine is useless these days for most players as they have runelite
---
HAIL ZAMORAK

Have you actually tried sailing in the boat? I think only actual teleports will make it go away once you‚Äôre out of the pit
---
I was wrong to be more aggressive the guy above who you replied to ticked me off the wrong way to just shit on op as he was proud of his achievement
---
I have been doing what you‚Äôve said but since I‚Äôm praying mage I get destroyed by the rangers and eventually run out of brews so I give up
---
Id say torag legs. They‚Äôre like 100k
---
tried that, doesn't work
---
more xp
---
Just make profit of picking up the vauable seeds :)
---
It's a physical item you get from the varrock museum.
---
Right, but how would Runelite determine the monsters weakness if it uses the same moves and can still take damage from any type of attack?
---
Train slayer and punch some kurasks or gargs
---
It was added for mobile
---
The keyboard auto repeat will be doing regular key presses on the same spot, so will look like ad autotyper. I strongly recomend you don't do it as the account may pick up a ban.
---
You must complete quest "Horror from the deep"? Then you'll unlock empty books and you can add missing pages.
---
Cut trees then. I did after I got PST willow as it‚Äôs so expensive as you say
---
I really hate leveling Construction as well. I have had 90 Cons banked since December, but I never seem to want to start with it. Whenever I do Construction, I feel like I am not allowed to miss a single tick or I'm just wasting time and it stresses me out lol. I don't feel that with any other skill.
---
It can know where all the books are in the Arceuus library and more stuff, so... It will probaly have something against that

\- 50 or 60 base stats

So I'm doing desert treasure and am on the last diamond, the shadow one. I'm in the shadow cave but Damis won't spawn, I've tried world hopping, logging out and back in and have teled out of the cave and gone back in. Still won't spawn. I'm following the wiki guide, have the ring equipped, and am in the big room all the way at the end of the cave. I've walked all around the room at the end for a few minutes as well. Can anyone please point me in the right direction?
---
I literally only put the spec pool in my poh because of my weak bgs specs at vork
---
Golden rule: If it keeps happening then it works.
---
Cause a lot of them get banned before they can mule their stuff away. And they have to front the cost of training an account, buying membership, and paying for bots.
---
I got on again last night for the first time in 2 years or so, and after an hour of fire-making I was bored again.
---
Chill with the novel bro

FETCH THE PLAY SESSION STRETCHER

---
Yes. You can always reclaim a cannon from Nulodion no matter where you bought it.
---
but it would happen in the same tick so you would be shoving both at once in right? I demand an edit where there is one shark and a shark+ karam in the second one
---
imagine if you would have killed green dragons for 200m str and att, you'd be able to get clean at duel arena like a legend ffs.....
---
 imo its pretty accurate, especially for things like flinching/woox walk

christ runelite is a fucking abomination LOL

Mmm, nuts.

You might also need magic secs for 6 min. You know you need to have those equipped to take effect right?
---
Make sure you're logged into runelite with the same Google account that you were using before. You can check which email you're logged in with in the info panel.
---
Yeah fair enough haven‚Äôt played on pc in about 8 years but still kind of overkill no?
---
I have like 1.5k kraken kills and 1.4k of those are in private. The drops staying on floor forever is great. Also not having some dbag ragger coming in after 10-20kills is great.
---
They function like jad , flipping between range and mage attacks. I had them doing so in the animation but it made it way too cluttered so I opted to have them hits look menecijg

Medium defo most reward and then elite

Honestly the biggest downside of iron man for me is playing members twice. Also I'm used to the convenience of my character with the stats and unlocks he has.
---
Yes I‚Äôm doing that
---
tbh my fire making skill came in real handy during the regicide quest. The skill is useful, but osrs holds your hand too much. Your alway seconds away from a bank

Do the opposite of what it tells you to do and post on Reddit

I do it using a bucket

Went back through the cave and he spawned right away, no idea what was different this time. Must have gone through the cave 5-6 times,

Thanks for clarifying dude these people are autistic in a bad way they really thought I meant you profit off the one dead herb üòÇüòÇüòÇ I mean I guess you can just use the necromancy spell on it and get lucky. I make 1.2m a day farming 8 snap patches 6x a day with 1-3 deads using iasor

Good for you. Animal products are one of the biggest (or the biggest, depending on which study you cite) strain on our environment and the developing world. Sorry to have misunderstood your motivations, but as you anticipate, you probably won't find much love here.
---
I think consuming animal products is fine, ethically. I'm sheltered enough to detach myself from the process of obtaining them. We can responsibly consume animal products, but the first world's demand for them is insatiable. It's not the desolate rural Indians who are destroying the environment with their 4 cows per village. It's us.

I have all the skill and quest requirements to do monkey madness 2, as well as have completed the grand tree balloon thing, but I still cannot start the quest! I go talk to the king and he says "Everything is fine, as far as I can tell...I will let you know if there is any trouble." 
---
What gives? Am I missing something?
---
They should genuinely just release Nex, no need for Chaotics though, we already have half of them rebranded and nerfed. Ghrazi rapier is a nerfed Chaotic, same with Elder maul, Toxic staff, and Twisted buckler, all nerfed versions of Dungeoneering rewards.
---
Dont focus on sounds. Focus on the fet/leg movement. Sound is slightly lagged to the actual attack.
---
Happened to me today. Once i saw it i logged on mobile to make sure nothing untoward had happened (banned etc since I don't know what the banned message you receive is). Once i saw it was ok I closed runelite and tried again and it worked :)

Old enough to pee, old enough for me

---
Na no hate fam, am happy you're making some money brother.
---
Keep it up :)
---
Lol, Runelite gets the stats from wiki and wiki gets it from monster examine. What do you mean it's useless? C'mon think a little.
---
This is the correct method.
---
You know thieving seeds injects exactly zero GP into the game right?
---
I actually use it sometimes, look up the stats the 3a kite shield is the 3rd best Melee defense shield in the game behind dfs and ely.
---
I had broadband ADSL in the UK from 2001 onwards, and even then for our area we were late adopters.
---
It helps that we have every detail documented in the wiki. I don't even know how I managed to complete quests without guides at age 12.
---
Happend to me also
---
Yeah, unfortunately it's not really that fun unless you're pretty serious about it. I remember as a kid there was always plenty you could do to help out your team even as a low level, but the couple of times I've played recently it's just basically team PKing. Not really anyone's fault it's just the playerbase is a different kind of people from back in the day.
---
Git gud
---
So embarrassed by this twat, any normal people our there should know where not all moronic children. We recognise trump for the orange tit that he is and think he should have stayed on the golf course.
---
You can make a lot of money killing bone people at Chaos Altar.  A lot of people also go there to fight because it's a hotspot, and kill people training prayer when they see them because it takes a few minutes to find fights and the log out timer is a thing.
---
You sound a bit judgemental and salty if I'm going to be honest.
---
START THE DAMN JOUST BEFORE I PISS MESELF
---
Before looting. Let the noob get it.
---
For my 99 farming I just walked into the farming guild, said "you guys are invited to my 99 farming party", then I immediately got 99. Then I told everyone to act excited and they did. I made a stupid joke about no more tree runs, someone said lol(out of sympathy surely), and we all went about our farm runs. Honestly that was more fun for me than having a party.
---
Gz BTW. I turned off lizardmen shaman task immediately when I got mine.

Makes me reminisce of the times you could start a lvl 3 and go straight to wilderness and just make a big team of lvl 3s and fight other lvl 3s. Good times.
---
What tick manipulation do u do with pvp?
---
No no not salty at all. I meant the weird trash talking, sometimes to the point of saying racist crap cause they know over the internet they can get away with it.
---
Most people who manage to kill me are either completely silent or laugh a little or something.

Other people completely spaz out.

Can you buy bonds on your main and use them in your ironman? How does that work?

I'd search a guide for each skills which tells you what to cook, fletch... at what level. Little use to do things below your level, xp-wise. Sell the resources you don't need.
---
I've done that too. But just forgot the spade. 3 times? haha RIP
---
I think it was just the cheaper option for the longest time for a lot of people. But I see what you mean on the country thing now.
---
Having the rune cbow is extremely slow. Personally I‚Äôd be getting 75 for the blowpipe and trust me, fight caves are a cake walk with blowpipe
---
I probably knew the xp wasn't as fast, but hitting up those hill giants with the 26 damage slaps was so satisfying
---
Yeah try giant mole OP. It's pretty fun to get a few kills and you won't die ever in it.
---
Good, don't.
---
Lol there's no reasoning whatsoever with people here. If you say anything other than stupid memes they just call you a nerd or a virgin. No point. They don't even play runescape. I'm convinced the average player here is like 600 total at THE VERY BEST.

Green dragons netted me my first whip. Along with my first verac set for kq.
---
I think so -- you can get armor to maximize prayer bonus and pray melee plus overload potions. Still worth doing until you get the levels for better strategies like dharoks.
---
Grouping mobs to barrage, means you can just leave auto retaliate on on your main and basically leave it afk barraging and just group them up on the alt. 
---
Also the alt can pick up excess loot to high alch, extending trips and xp/h.
---
For things like boss slayer, Cerb springs to mind, you can run an alt to and from a bank to restock and collect loot.
---
You can also spec restore and go restore, which means you can indefinitely stay at bosses like Thermonuclear smoke devil without any trouble.
---
To put it into numbers for two common tasks, you can get 111k/h at Dust devils and 120k/h at Nechs with an alt, it‚Äôs very significant.
---
If you‚Äôre interested I highly recommend seeing the skilling discord, it‚Äôs got videos of slayer tasks with alts.
---
No wonder it used to take 2 hours to finish an easy quest. So much walking &amp; forgetting items.

&gt;Firemaking is one of the best skills

If you have a couple hundred k to waste on one session with prayer pots then I would say so yea. I nmz‚Äôd from 70-70-60 without any problems. Also dharoks for me at the time was worse xp an hr than just my Abby dagger, torso, fury, dboots.  Dharoks didn‚Äôt get better till I hit about 90hp
---
Thanks a ton, I'm at like 8 range right now and I've just been buying the best bow I can use and make a ton of arrows but none of them ever hit no matter what.
---
I think we went to school together lol
---
Nah, just Trump (and every other republican)
---
Nah they were around 400-500, never ever were they 600 ea but okay.  Their value is based on the alch value of yew longs.
---
That only applies if the iron did 50% or more of the damage. Same if a main did it.
---
So you say you will be using a spammer then talk shit about people using spammers? Can you please explain why you are exempt from the people you are bitching about using spammers?

Fuck maybe, you can tell I don't pk. It definitely wasn't always like that.

I've been able to complete 1 elite so far, I think I needed to do like 6 different quests to complete it. As long as ranger boots are on the med clue drop table I think they'll always be the most profitable.

I still think the best way to make money back then was buying and selling unid herbs.
---
You could arrange them to know exactly which were ranarrs and just buy every single one for 1k each world hopping by both Falador banks. I made SO much money - if you did this all day you could make up to 15mil in 8 hours if you knew where to buy them. The key is to target places near herb locations and most people had no issues selling unidentified herbs if they were guaranteed a payout.
---
Please tell me he's wearing an amulet of accuracy
---
What?
---
I know the idea gets thrown around a lot but I would love burning effigies/herbs/whatever to give stat bonuses.
---
It would be interesting to have the specific level buff be random when burning similar to spicy stew but correspond higher buffs to both the types of logs you use to make the fire as well as your own firemaking level to get the most out of it.
---
Another suggestion I think would be good is to give firemaking healing over time as compared to cooking/food being instantaneous. I'm talking 1 HP/5-10 seconds levels of healing at 99 firemaking with redwood logs. The reason why I suggest this is that there really is no healing over time niche, maybe it won't work in context but nevertheless I think it would be interesting to test it.
---
Yes because this means its a good thing doesnt it! oh wait its just as bad if not worse
---
Didn't something similar also happen for Halloween(?) where a big spooky face assaulted players
---
It's really a shame this is the only way around the issue. Guess I don't have a choice though.

I find this too. Was doing a slayer task on my 75cb alt earlier and met some nice guys. They seemed to have the same joie de vivre that I had as a lower player all those years ago!
---
Yeah the community is a lot different now. You could still join a CC and find plenty of people wanting to talk though if that‚Äôs your thing.

I really want this music track back in the woodcutting guild. The forlorn homestead track fits chilling out and afking in the woodcutting guild being surrounded by trees so much, and the shimmering sound effect of the magic trees only adds to it. It fells to natural. I really hate that they changed this and hope to see it changed back. The current track is such a worse mood for the area and doesn't fit.

Cc: Splashworlds. Beware theres a guy named alt arma that splashes and begs for donations on his skiller alt the entire time. I just hop when I see him, it's obnoxious.  Plenty of other wholesome splashers that splash for that CC though.

This isn't the subreddit for selfies
---
Its not bannable because its just remapping
---
It's just a fun post. Chill homeboy
---
Hmm, are you sure? I was going off of the metric given on the supply crate page of the wiki, although not saying its 100% accurate.
---
You would need to get their attention by making a post on this subreddit, get enough upvotes and hope a jmod looks at your case. People are inclined to upvote since they either get to see a "jmod smackdown" or see jiggleflox make a mistake. 
---
You can also get their attention on social media like twitter. However I don't use twitter so I don' know how reliable it is, but I do know people do resort to it.
---
All in all customer support is garbage.
---
Obligatory $11

Those hits were so lucky lmao
---
Where is his RS character located in this point in time KOWALSKI ANALYSIS!
---
Is it just me or did anybody else thought they saw the armor animation moving his character
---
Max melee in 168 hours roughly 75m xp no chance
---
My point is the game designers have already gated it. If you have means to surpass the gate that‚Äôs fine, not a broken mechanic.
---
Wht are you going to do? Afk guthans with autoclick?
---
Why don‚Äôt they care about these guys ruining the economy but they care about other bots?
---
I‚Äôm 99 range 91 def w/ ~1400 kc. I can average 4-6. There‚Äôs not even a point in staying for 8 kills. You can‚Äôt hold all of the loot.
---
Would people still make ironmen accounts if the g.e never was added to osrs?
---
13mx3 is not 75m
---
Make a fisherman next to every fishing spot who yells something when a fish hits the ground
---
PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT
---
Tent whip is good for bossing but usually not worth it.
---
Rapiers price is pretty fair imo. It‚Äôs a great non-degrading weapon.
---
Your gear is alright but could use upgrades. Fighter torso, bandos tassets, barrows gloves, fury or Torture, prims, and Berserker ring (imbued) will all give strength bonus so you‚Äôll hit higher.  You should also get your strength level up.
---
You can get like 1 mil points an hour
---
Was happening to me all morning.

Wtf is that paint
---
6 psilocybin &lt;-- rsn ill teach you the most important things such as how to summon zaff anywhere im vorrock,  and how to make your pet cat a fatty mcfatfat
---
on the plus side you get more membership subscriptions with people abusing alts, on the downside someone on reddit might get sweaty
---
it should be obvious what Jagex's stance is on this
---
We can do this, let's reserve them all to 126
---
I believe that the option is not available with the default IOS settings. Your best bet would be to see if a 3rd party app exists that allows you to do this.

They need to calm down and learn not to discriminate
---
Air plane method will solve your issue. There is a tile in line with two safespots that will pull most mobs into a safespot. You stand on that tile at the start of each wave praying mage and wait 10-15 seconds. If you are only getting hit by a mager, you continue praying mage and run to the door pulling the mager within range of your safespot. You can then kill each mob one at a time. I know this is a shit explanation but I can answer any specific questions you have but to get the general idea of the method, you should check out this video
---
https://youtu.be/0qM2_JAMVXA
---
Airplane method and explanation starts around 4:30. You only need this for any waves with ranger and mager so 38-45 and 53(?) -Until double melee-mager wave.
---
So many alt right osrs players..
---
Damn it took me 950 kills on my main and 1050 on my pure.
---
thats what the majority of them do
---
Auto win if more than x amount
---
Auto win if doesnt have enough to pay out
---
Auto win if lost more than x amount in a row
---
And in those 12 hours get 30k xp lmao
---
You can fuck off prick 
---
Don‚Äôt like the picture don‚Äôt fucking comment u fucking goon
---
Dude I just have to say this here for posterity, I used to train on hill giants with a gmaul back in the day bc I liked it and I didn't know what exp rates were lmao
---
13mil x3 = 39m  say 100k xp per hour (which you wouldn‚Äôt be getting for a long time anyway) is 390 hours at 6 hrs a day is 65 days but ofcourse it will be much longer due to much lower xp rates than 100k
---
It hits you pretty hard until you bring the hp down from 100% to \~6-10% but after that its really chill. I am soloing for the construction xp tbh.
---
you can do that on RS3 why not OSRS?
---
Safe spot Tzaar Kets and you will get a few Obby capes, going for 800k each.
---
Huge gz!
---
Orange man bad
---
Is it bad? I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a good cheap way to train mage
---
It would be 52m with max melee and hp being 309k/h every hour logged on
---
Nice thx
---
Tyty
---
This whole conversation is exactly why this game is still popular. No right or wrong way that play.
---
Those are some of my best memories of RS tbh. 10 range 13 maga pures lol. So much fun.
---
Repetition is the real game. Grinding and achieving goals is the entire charm of OSRS. I find bossing too high stress so I resort to easier activities I guess. 
---
As a low level character, make many *small* goals (super duper important that they're reasonable). Quests skip all early game leveling and jump you to mid-level quickly. Barrows gloves should be your priority as they are a staple for PvM content and training combat skills. If you can't stand any other skills though, then I don't take it that you have a goal of maxing or something. I'm at 1806 total right now with a goal of maxing, but my main motivator was quests, diaries, and clue scrolls.
---
wouldnt u do 28 an inv at that rate?
---
It was in a pull out drawer, type thing designated for keyboards.
---
And I can‚Äôt even get mine to go down 2 stairs ;-;
---
I forget the rewards from this
---
This game is only repetition
---
Lol at your life
---
Or store 1000 of them
---
You can just use ice gloves as your 28th slot instead of a stam. Then if you get screwed by the conveyor belt or the bars cool late, then you still have ice gloves as a backup. Costs you a click every time you stam compared to use a stam as your 28th slot though, still much better than ice gloves method.
---
Hell yeah!
---
One click house tele, one click pendant.
---
Oak dungeon doors when you can are better
---
When I got back into the game I did this for a few hours a day for a few days. Made quite the cash stack, got some barrows pieces, lots of rune.
---
Speculation/Spoilers below
---
&gt;!I think he got a good lucky whip drop. I checked his xp gains the other day, and he had a decent bit of strength xp, but also like 3k attack and defense, and the atk/def xp was exactly the same, as if he was using a whip on controlled/shared whatever it is!&lt;
---
Did u have auto retaliate on?
---
Nope, nothing you can do.
---
I literally just enchanted another 20. Is there another way?
---
You can also build one in your house at some high construction level
---
Not if you have house tabs/teles on you at all times
---
Petition to not do that +1
---
You evil genius.
---
Ouuuccchhhh
---
Watched it happen live, that shit was hilarious
---
Yes! Or that...
---
D7MPEP
---
Don't try this
---
I often pull up shitloads of snape grass. If you don't want so many, don't use ultravompost and don't use magic secs.
---
Honestly, the whole "nobody:" before a meme thing is pretty dumb. The meme doesnt make any more or less sense with or without it.
---
Don't take this as a personal attack I'm just an internet autist that gets mad at memes
---
It means nobody asked. Also easy way to denote a joke. #next #meme
---
Go look at the tea stall in Varrok it‚Äôs where theyre getting levels to go to master farmer..
---
I did but we were in the safe area, and he was also like 40 levels higher than me.
---
The firemaking is RS3 probably isn't click intensive enough, but everyone grouped up throwing logs in a fire was pretty cool.
---
No you don‚Äôt.
---
"i-it's not cheating if I call it QOL!"
---
I have bad news for you, incel...
---
How so? To bank you have to go to a specific location(which your usually going to ur house to tele for anyway) then you gotta run to the bank pull it out then use it
---
Vs being able to bring 1 tele and do all your runs at once without having to bank multiple times.
---
Seriously, only having to bring a rune pouch with house teles for herb, tree, birdhouses, daily diary's, etc is so nice.
---
It also frees up multiple spaces in the bank, which any mid-late game player usually struggles with, because there's really not a lot of bank spaces
---
Nobody:
---
Not one person:
---
Actually nobody, ever:
---
Literally not a single soul:
---
No one who has ever existed on this earth, period:
---
Not one living being in the universe, known or undiscovered:
---
Nary a single individual in this or any conceivable alternate dimension:
---
u/LieV2:  It means nobody asked. Also
---
Go do infernal eels then
---
Not that hard to press print screen button and ctrl+v lol
---
Hey man, that really sucks. Dont quit the game because of it though. You can always make more money, and the process is whats fun anyways. Money just buys items and so what, you are fine.
---
Came to say this. Also, get them herb runs going. Like ASAP man, get that gp flowing.
---
did that to me once, all i had to do was try again.
---
rip
---
I camed my pant
---
I actually just transitioned to a zerk because of my 2 def lol.
---
Gz my dude more to come
---
Biggest update since then has been farming guild/new slayer area with an area specific task master
---
Thank you. I had no idea shift drag existed for this.
---
Runecraft bad
---
The ones in the city drop capes and don‚Äôt need cape
---
ubuntu, nice
---
Engine team is working on porting the clan system from RS3 to OSRS, which is the first step for group ironman. It's not exactly shelved but it's going to be a bit.
---
Yes you do. The Lvl 221 ones are the only ones that drop obi items. Do your research mate.
---
Gz!!!
---
Dang, I did a task and got 2 so depends haha
---
Just safespot the saradomin wizard with protect from magic on.
---
Have you by chance heard of supply and demand?
---
Yes
---
Looks like 1474 Rune dragons tops to me.
---
I know that a few days ago
---
Yea I probably wont quit its just a huge setback though.  I am close to being able to do barrows so I may be able to make up the money relatively quickly.  Im at 50 att/54 str/ 40 def/ 45 range/ 35 mage
---
Osoz, didn't read that far. I feel bad for you, can I help you with anything?
---
Lmao ok bud

Pretty much, if the guy you're fighting has ahrims well that's an extra 4m you can get but generally you'll pk in mystics

*SCREEEEECH*

His sentence is correct he just needed a comma after God. Allah is still a different God compared to other religions, but someone speaking English wouldn't know which God you're talking about unless you said Allah.

One account per twitch prime account

Ok I like this
---
Forgot east green dragons, every world is full of bots with granite platebody, rune legs etc
---
Oof
---
Yep. I tweeted at them today about it. I can‚Äôt get to a yew tree without at least 5 bots at it. It‚Äôs absurd.
---
Is it really the same thing? Isn't that bannable?
---
Ironmen
---
Do Kamil next
---
Unless you don't have digsite pendant perfectly positioned in your bank and you need to scroll/search for it. In your house you always know where it will be.
---
While moving it checks prayer the tick before it stops
---
While spawning it checks 1 tick after it spawns I believe, it may check the tick it spawns
---
For being the pillar it checks 1tick into after you move out
---
They're "nuking" every day. It's just they don't make a show of it to let botters know specifically what part they got tripped up by.
---
Sometimes I feel like this sub wants some IRL staff monitoring in-game 24/7 and banning people who don't respond with dodgy stats/names (unreasonable and stupid).
---
If you don't want to play with a tainted economy, which has always been the case even back in 04 (you just didn't have the computing power to run 100's on the same machine at once) there are other game modes without one.
---
Woke up and beat my meat. Went the gym and sat in sauna, got haircut. Now eating canes chicken. Tonight I plan on finishing dragon slayer.
---
I mean...it's not like the Venezuelan/Chinese are just gold farming in RS. It's quite literally any game that can be botted..so yes. Axe them all. 
---
Downvote me all you want I don't care.
---
Pasty ass knees
---
And yet RS3 still makes more money than OSRS - surely that makes it the more successful game from a capitalist perspective?
---
why tho
---
Are there any good f2p uim text guides to look at? Can't seem to find any that are uim specific that are in a text format. I dont know if any of you might know of any that I can't seem to find. Thank you :)
---
The meta is chainmace at chaos druids. Its much quicker then nmz
---
Blast furnace smelts all the ore you can carry instantly while normal furnace takes one ore at a time.
---
autohotkey is allowed if and only if you set it as a 1 input to 1 output. as soon as you do one key does two keys or more, it becomes bannable.
---
It's like hearing spoilers for a TV show that where heavily hinted at. There's a chance that it won't actually happen, or happen in an unexpected way or whatever. It's annoying to know that it's definitely happening because it ruins the tension.
---
People like to go in with zero expectations. Makes the experience better
---
Are you playing on Nokia N-Gage?
---
Okay so buy bone Cross bow and bone bolts
---
Train some slayer and range
---
Earn money for lots of mind Runes
---
Still slaying but tasks that can be maged get 50 mage
---
Earn a bit more money slayer
---
Do underground pass and pay the mage 200k for Ivan staff (I)
---
Using your higher level range and slayer begin to take on barrows
---
Most off all make sure you have fun
---
My grand pappy used to tell me stories about Swampletics
---
You're right that you shouldn't wear full graceful, but your reason is wrong.  You shouldn't wear full graceful because you're wearing goldsmithing gauntlets, so you won't be getting the 30% boost from wearing the full outfit.
---
Dose
---
It was the 2nd one that got me I expected the first if you know what I mean
---
Try cutting your nuts off. Helps with seiZures.
---
Nah, I'm playing on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5".  
---
Are you having this problem too?
---
Thanks! Came out better than I thought
---
Sit kid
---
Is "finishing dragon slayer" just an euphemism for "beating meat"? XD
---
But ornate pool and box are 82 and 83 without boost so it's worth getting there anyway
---
I figured it was something like that. I don‚Äôt get it in this particular case, because I think he‚Äôs said what he‚Äôs grinding for the next episode so I didn‚Äôt think it was particularly spoilery. But I‚Äôm not gonna go around griefing people that do view that as a spoiler and try to avoid them
---
mr frost is that you?
---
Let me know if you do! I‚Äôve used converters before but for this I just looked at a picture, pretty simple
---
Thanks for the advice \^.\^  
---
I'll let you know how it goes
---
Yeah fair enough
---
Not necessarily short term gains at the expense of the consumer can lead to issues with longterm profitability.
---
No idea, never went to Canifis Agility Course :(
---
People who go in clueless probably don't see this subreddit. They are casuals who get told by an experienced player to go get a torso and here they are, in my game, not having a single clue and fucking everything up without saying that they don't know what they're doing and just continuing on like a big dumb oaf and then pissing off-GOD FUCKING DAMNIT HAPPYCOW13, WHY THE FUCK CANT YOU LEARN HOW TO SWITCH YOUR COMBAT STYLE! IT LITERALLY SAYS RIGHT FUCKING THERE, YOU PIECE OF SHIT, GARBAGE PLAYER!!!!
---
This changes everything.
---
I have like 30 from opening stone chests when i get tired of abusing the Ardougne knights for thieving.
---
You sound like you'd shit yourself for a smithing record
---
Best way to check for bots at red chins! 
---
1) say hi. If no response, test them with "bot?". No real player will stand by if their public is on and they're being called a bot. 
---
2) if no response, wait for them to pick up a trap and instantly replace the spot with yours. They'll either log out within seconds, leaving the traps. Or the bot will malfunction and start trying to set up in the next available told, thus moving the bot and trashing it.
---
I did regicide, roving elves and desert treasure for the first time ever a few weeks back and it was honestly the most fun I've ever had questing.
---
Also, he even said he won't be uploading until he has a whip... So like.. be thankful?
---
It's never too late to drop that extra weight :)
---
I thought AHK was banned; hence, all the AutmunElegy memes.
---
Also makes you wait for like 2 seconds every run. Just press spacebar as you equip the gauntlets lol, it's not that hard
---
0.6 seconds. Also auto weed. Also flair your reddit post as humour so I can continue filtering it out of my feed.
---
Had one for ages that I needed barrelchest anchor for. Finally did the quest and 2 steps later I need a BGS. My attack was 60 and my bank was worth less than the damn sword lol. Had that step for about a month or so now. I'll do it eventually...
---
Black salamanders used to be one of the best magic choices for narrows back in the day. Cheap weapon, cheap ammo, freeze melee brothers and safe spot from the corner. Typically dead in one freeze. Miss those 8+ hour days spent at barrows
---
? Just drink a full stamina when you're below 20 run lmao
---
I'd love someone to train me doing pvm. I started back in February and I've watched a couple videos but I still have no idea and havent tried anything besides wintertodt.
---
So nmz is fun? Lol goodnight
---
Any messages in the message center? I can't imagine the name would be put up for someone else to take without notice in just a month of inactivity. Probably would need to contact support. Was it just a random name, or something that would indicate bot/dicing stuff, like RNG-whatever or a bunch of numbers?
---
Please do one of only konar, she's always in the backgrounds of your pictures, she needs to be at the front of one
---
What is bronzeman
---
It‚Äôs pretty normal in a game with zero item sinks.
---
The more come in the game the more it will drop in price.
---
Also for the price it‚Äôs not that much better then a blowpipe at most things it‚Äôs good for.
---
So meh.
---
The game desperately needs item sinks like 2 years ago
---
This diffused yesterday.
---
Not down
---
because it was fixed years ago
---
Wait, you just stop attacking? Even if you click once every 10minutes or so?
---
yikes
---
Shit that sucks with this is he clearly clicked pray melee before the 2nd claw spec came in. Gotta love it
---
The afk method gives you like nothing compared to actually killing zulrah. Especially at lower levels.
---
Zulrah scales just change price from time to time. They've been lower before, they'll go back up eventually.
---
Lol don‚Äôt you know that runescape players are NPCs?
---
Wait until you get to do Dragon Slayer 2. Probably the most fun quest in the game in my opinion.
---
I‚Äôm a bit of a casual player can someone inform me as to what makes this update useful?
---
Pretty much just good money for f2p, the cockroaches dropped lots of rune pieces and the gloves were bis and matched ferocious boots
---
I mean you can keep a stamina in your inv regardless your just going to be doing 26 per trip
---
Check out ‚ÄúK exy‚Äù! It‚Äôs a good range of mid to high level players and we constantly have people doing boss trips and Skilling together!
---
This^ ask the average person how many "pushy vegans" they actually know and it's likely that that number is zero.
---
Why are there so many 2009-2011 posts recently, just give it up were in 2007 here people. 07 graphics, 07 classic map (not including new parts of the map or completing empty part of maps) 07, boss styles, 07 minigames. 
---
It‚Äôs how it is. Go kill cockroaches, play stealing creation, soul wars, dungeoneering, summoning and all that jazz on RS3 where it was made, and leave 07 in 07.
---
Check out some of torvestas latest vids. He has his build. I have a maxed pure but if i were to make a secondary account i would make this one for sure. Its very very strong
---
Mod Weath is the only person in charge of banning bots other than Tyran on RS3.
---
Mod Acorn is in community manager now, they could only afford having her in anti-cheat during mobile launch. 
---
10K players or 100K players, anti-cheating remains only 1 person
---
you two are adorable
---
Imagine putting mills into farming
---
this comment brought to you by the daily papaya/biweekly mahogany trees gang
---
Well it dropped a lot in price
---
it did the same thing to 2 of my accounts try retyping your password and relogging itll log you in but im not sure as to why the message is popping up seems like it has been happening to others as well
---
Another win for Olympus.
---
You think it‚Äôll go back up?
---
What are these boxes? Feels like the Mueller Report all over again.
---
I got Peter‚Äôs stick. Not for sale though‚Äîit‚Äôs my favorite toy
---
Why yikes? Is it that bad?
---
He literally said he wont make a video until he has a whip. You‚Äôre going into his next video knowing that. Also with the other spoiler he calculated when he‚Äôd have it in a previous video. It was inevitable and there were no possible surprises or reason for tension.
---
I guess you could say hes settled in to his surroundings
---
Yeah but it's been a long time and I completely forgot that he said that, therefore your point is invalid.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm an idiot but what call did you guys start fighting obor? I got my ass handed to me last week ( attack 60, strength 55, defense 60) what method did you use?
---
Rn I have a dagganoth task. So my goal is to get the fremmenik elite diary to make it more profitable. I base my goals in this manner. I find and end goal and reach the goals necessary before I an reach that!
---
Can you expand on this free name change thing...?
---
Can't wait
---
Lag
---
I barely play and mainly spend my time on rs pking, over the years
---
I'm just saying. Anyone with any basic understanding of efficiency would say the exact same thing.. Lol
---
If I were you I'd start bossing
---
