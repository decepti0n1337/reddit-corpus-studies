Yeah, its definitely gonna be a little off. I assume he's making at least 1.5-2% profit otherwise why would anyone do it. When I checked the OSB price earlier the 16m one was selling for 15.75~.

You left how long you were logged in visible. Gg account.

I can totally see Pegs now, even though I just like the extra range personally.

---
When you’re explaining Tekton I can see your point if you’re soloing, but the likelihood that you miss all specs as a group is fairly low and the offensive bonuses of the Torture are universal.
---
DHL v DWH is something I still just don’t get and I think this is very opinionated and impossible to reduce to pure mathematics. I haven’t run the DPS calcs, but even like a 20% DPS increase in Olm hand wouldn’t be worth it to me unless you’re either soloing or the obligate melee hand member.
---
Doesn't the bolt pouch destroy all your bolts on death? I'd love to use one if that was changed.
---
But the other people said yes and if more people think it's good who am I to question?

I used Dharok’s until 90 strength at NMZ and then went with Bludgeon until 99 doing slayer. It worked pretty good for me but I’m not honestly sure if it’s the most efficient.

I'm guessing fastest would be max str gear with scythe + piety + ovls.

But yeah, obby would be better in your case. Still with piety and ovls. 
---
Real question is why are you watching rs3 q+a...
---
Scythe is ~1/200 so he got it quite a bit under droprate, but not incredibly far under. No different than say a 170 kc prim or 100 kc zenyte

Tbh they need to get away from the whip concept and just introduce some damn variety back into the game. All you ever see are whips, blowpipes, etc.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That being said, updates don't always have to add end-game content because, believe it or not, the average player can't do end-game shit. ([Reference](https://i.redd.it/c2e89tgaqfc21.png)) That means the vast majority of players aren't at end-game, and would enjoy new content that they can participate in.
---
&gt; You could spec out someone boxing before they start boxing.
---
The boxing part is the issue, though... So that is irrelevant. 
---
&gt; And yes you are invincible because teams swap out after specs and have the person with BiS fighting. They hop off if getting wrecked and someone else takes over.
---
They technically aren't. You can get 1shot with a lucky ags/gmaul spec. 
---
&gt;By your logic people shouldn't be able to team with one person on ancients while another is on standard because the game never intended you to use both spell books at the same time. 
---
What? That is just a stupid sentence. 
---
Obviously the game intended to allow different players to be able to access different spell books. You can even have 1 player accessing multiple spell books via Spellbook Swap or the Mage Cape power. 
---
&gt; Or how about people shouldn't be teaming in singles areas because those were intended for 1v1s where as multi is meant for teams?
---
Where does it state the 1v1 area wasn't intended for teams too? It just means the area is intended so that only 1 person can attack you at a time. 
---
Not that teams can't move around it and hunt for people.

Using the OsBuddy exchange price for the seeds (assuming you convert them into saplings yourself, since it's a bit cheaper): Celastrus seeds cost 83,895 and give 14,130 xp for checking, so that's 5.937 gp/xp. Redwood seeds are 68,511 gp (side note, I had no idea the price of those had gone down that much) and give 22,450 xp for checking, so that's 3.05 gp/xp. Neither one of those seems too bad efficiency wise, even if redwoods take a while to actually get the xp drop.

Well I planned on Jad later so THANK YOU

You’d probably be fun at the parties you don’t get invited to

this works. thank you

Not everyone takes pictures of menial things like that.

But it means they are less viable

I'm 27 and I have two kids mate I don't want to get invited to parties.

Only if you make it reward something good then nerf the shit out of it later on

It was an amethyst alt. Wanna actually build it now. Currently at mlm but looking for more afk. Thinking of sharks.

going crazy before you even know the loot. I'm not buying ct facerolls on their keyboard everytime they pk someone in revs.
---
Is he buying them off the GE then going to the NPC and trading him for cash?
---
Nerf lower darts increase melee and leave it for a bit. People need to understand it’s the only viable option. Crossbows are too slow/inaccurate to be viable only way it’s close is if  you use expensive ammo. Bow wise msb is only affordable option but it’s not that great. Only 3 bows that fire dragon are dark bow which fuck that. 3rd age bow 300m cool. Twisted bow 1b without blow pipe range is ass/ not affordable for normal players. 
---
Also it’s the only viable option for things like grotesque guardians to be able to put dps before dawn heals. Nerf it and that boss is literally dead content. I’m sure there are other boss’ you could also argue, like vorkath. Blowpipe is fine. Everyone just likes to be on the band wagon that it’s not. But they’re somehow cool with twisted bow being bis literally everywhere.
---
Can you imagine? And then rune prices going up because more are leaving the game. 
---
Nice!

Are you me?

Ive got lured for 1.5b this way this Tuesday. The maxed iron man who messaged me was Kettle, and his alt was named Kettle alt.

Most bosses are done with a ranged and non melee setup.
---
Or they don't understand proper troubleshooting processes, which speaks to the vast majority of people. That assumption is like rule 1 of dealing with user tickets, and it is useless to assume otherwise. Realizing that 3rd party app's interfaces might break because of the black box environment requires at least some domain knowledge which users dont and shouldnt be expected to have.
---
wtf is a scythe only 1/200? so a tbow is like almost 3 times more rare? 
---
Just make the leprechaun's all banker's. Problem solved.
---
It gets automatically trimmed
---
I'm pretty sure majority of the games players are 22-26..
---
Gotchu fam.
---
Thanks! Normally I'd recommend just banging out RFD, but since you mentioned you don't wanna quest, I'd suggest going after the other equips you'll likely need. Fire cape, torso, d defender... Also you could slayer at konar to build a bit your bank and maybe invest in tassets or a torture.
---
As far as bosses go you're not very close to anything but barrows and mole, so I wouldn't worry about it for now. You can grind up a bit for gwd if you REALLY want to, but it probably won't be great money for a little while
---
Maybe zulrah is a good middle ground? I'd recommend at least 80 ranged and magic for it
---
This post is ridiculous and full of inaccuracies so I'll just pull one out
---
&gt;DFS for example has crazy defense and also gives great strength bonus, it has such good defense that I’d rather wear a DFS while ranging and tanking than the Dragonfire Ward which is actually quite balanced but terrible compared to DFS.
---
This is genuinely absurd. Not only does the DFS give -10 range bonus, but theres simply nowhere you should be taking so much damage that a DFS is necessary at all except MAYBE rune dragons (while meleeing) if you don't want to use super antis. Please never ever range in a DFS.
---
What's funny is that you claim melee is overpowered without even mentioning the one item that can actually keep up with range DPS, the scythe, and yet melee is still inferior to range at the majority of bosses and creatures. Instead you mention bread and butter mediocre upgrades like the nezzy (??????) and a regular whip which doesnt even crack the top 10 DPS weapons.
---
Overall it sounds like you need to spend some time with the [DPS calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit#gid=158500257). It will help you notice some of the absurd discrepancies between range and melee power. For example, blowpiping graardor with BRONZE DARTS is literally better dps than a max strength setup with an infernal cape and rapier. If you hit dwh specs on kalphite queen, it is better dps to blowpipe THROUGH ITS RANGE PRAYER on the first form than melee it with the best crush weapon even though its weakness is crush. This is not a contest.

I’m 80 attk,85str,77 def, 72 range,81 mage. 
---
I’d like to try, think I may be a little low levelled though. 
---
Each individual drop has a 1/3000 chance of appearing. Just because you kill 3000 doesn't mean you'll receive it. 
---
Unfortunately it's against Jagex's policy to return lost or stolen items, so I don't think you're gonna have any luck there. Sorry.
---
It's a good opportunity to try out an ironman if you're a returning player, though. Getting all the items on your account yourself is very rewarding. Just make sure to properly secure your account before committing a lot of time into it!
---
Not sure if you've ever touched a dps calc but Elite Void Mage &gt; Ahrim's w/o tormented brace lmfao.
---
It sounds counter intuitive, but because there is 6 combat stats (inc. hp) and only 1 slayer stat, it balances out. This combined with the fact that the tasks from the earlier masters are very slow for exp and give bad gp and often hard to get to, it's best to wait 
---
Nice
---
How is it more fitting? Should every boss drops loot crate keys instead of drops too?
---
And her penis.
---
Jagex doesn't restore items. It sucks but they won't change it.
---
It goes from the time you claim it IIRC
---
Tasks tell you where to kill stuff so way less slayer exp per hour
---
I’m pretty convinced it’s a troll account lol. 
---
What is this weeb shit doin in Osrs subreddit
---
We have nothing to lose but our chains. Keep up the good fight comrade.

Hmm yeah your right it was for a clue scroll, I needed it for some quest but I cant remember
---
I have a friend who didn't get one for 2 weeks after the update.
---
You were absurdly lucky.
---
I don't think their items ever appear to other players. Otherwise you could just like DDOS someone bossing and get their shit
---
Yeah sure add me. My name is "ironman btw"
---
Sad\* but yup lol
---
Come on dude, if you're gonna be an asshole at least be right. Dps of ahrims and barrows gloves with seers ring (i) is 7.117 and elite void mage without a ring is 7.106. 
---
When you are Aussie, you can only play on Aussie worlds. That's why they're always crowded. Every other world is 350-400 ping. 
---
So doing revs as an aussie sucks cause you can get teleblocked even if you react in time. 
---
Area locked tasks, such as abyssal demons in the abyssal area, so you can only kill the ones in the abyss or sire rather than catacombs or tower
---
which method?

Yeah I have pin and auth

In response to OP being a dick about being corrected, don't pretend that didn't happen

---
Really? This is just from an old picture I had on my phone from like four years ago, what a coincidence lol
---
Before all of that
---
&gt;Play Torvesta “ok I’m going in”
---
Yea what about it?
---
Say you get a task from her. It's blue dragons, easy right?
---
Well she wants you to kill them in the kourend dungeon.
---
That task just went from easy to can I skip it.
---
You sound like a cunt. Ofcourse he's probably mad, would you be if you lost tbow + 1b in other items? Might be hard to comprehend as a brainlet so I dont expect you to
---
That would be shame indeed! 
---
Was that the clan whose leader was one of the first people to get caught buying an infernal cape?
---
IM GONE
---
Its 1/200 per purple or 1/200 per raid?
---
Try pre workout. It's like legal speed.
---
Yes. Or maybe directly from clans, but yes. It's a great way for inflation to just keep getting worse and worse lol
---
You'd probably see more improvement drinking sara brews 
---
Eat 3 loafs of bread a day ull be maxed in no time
---
M E M E
---
But also yes
---
You are right, that being said my point stands that there are no places in the game today where you should be ranging in a dfs. even then it was a suboptimal way to kill them.
---
Also valid
---
More eggs -&gt; more points. Especially when people aren't super experienced and take a while, collector earns a ton of points for the team.

Have you tried thieving?

Vote for warding.

Wait how does that work? 
---
The only monster that you could ignore the combat triangle on was graardor, and they nerfed it there. Everything else you use it on is a mage based monster.

they don't ever appear to you, unless it's in wilderness
---
My bitch ass grind got 2 in 4kc

I perm blocked these haha
---
Im a skiller :/
---
I’m prescribed Adderall, to be completely honest with you the game becomes unplayable for about an hour after I take my meds - monitor gives me a headache, I found myself misclicking more often.
---
To each his own though I guess... I recommend not taking it though lol 
---
What about it? 
---
Range only. What are these lies.
---
Probably by attacking monsters on aggressive

You could drop gold when they die and make them buy them back with the same amount of gold after unlocking. Make the gold equivalent to whatever armor stats it mirrors.

natural history quiz is the basement section of the Varrock Museum miniquest. It consists of 14 creature displays in which the player must answer 3 questions correctly in order to earn 2 kudos each for a total of 28.
---
Each of the rooms has a Natural historian who will give a lecture about each creature for which the quiz is based on.
---
- from OSRS WIKI.  
---
Thanks! I’m usually bad at coming up with names, but I was thinking of a name that sounded similar to Bentnoze and Wartface, and Grubtoe is what I came up with. 
---
Apparently there’s a goblin named Grubfoot in the game but I had no idea until after I came up with Grubtoe!
---
Thanks man I'll add you. Capt Falcon
---
fuck you :( 1200kc no pet
---
So around the same you'd say?
---
It was either a simple pin or a keylogger/rat. Otherwise, I think it's highly unlikely any hijacker can just guess your pin in the first few tries. Because the thing is, a bank pin is probably the #1 defence this game has from hackers.
---
im confused on what u mean. may you elaborate
---
So [this](https://pastebin.com/u5engCfu) is a guide for efficient ironman, however I would say the beginning up to/past wintertodt section is a solid guide for a new account in getting the ardougne cloak. Afterwards you can just start questing away towards rfd.

I played with you &gt;two weeks ago so I'm confused how you 'came back to the game' one day ago. 
---
Ahaha..hahahahahaha...oh dear god. Oh that's classic. Hi, i work InfoSec for a ginormous conglomerate that actually transitioned to using codes instead of a direct URL for our users! :D Now, this is especially gold, not only because you have no idea what you're talking about, but also because we had a really hard time combating phishing for our distributors until this change brought about a 67% DROP in reported phishing attempts! That data, i hand collected! Oh isn't that delicious? 
---
Yes, you complete and utter ass, this technique is great at stopping phishing. Maybe not altogether, but, Jagex and Runescape? Some of the worst offenders for phishing attempts that i know of at the moment. 
---
Please...get your shit together.
---
either:
---
- you didnt have one and are lying
---
- it was easily guessable (your birthday etc)
---
- your computer has a RAT or serious breach
---
- it was removed normally in 3 days but you didnt notice the removal notice
---
However, the main security flaw here was not having 2fa on your email. Without it, someone in your emails has complete control over ALL ACCOUNTS linked to that email.
---
This is how hacking works in 2019, someone tries to either get into your email, or any email listed as a recovery email for other logins. Not just for osrs, everything. I've got people trying to log into my old insecure email constantly, which is why I made a brand new unique one for my osrs recovery email and logins.
---
2fa on your emails, brand new recovery email, secure unique passwords, and you will not get hacked.
---
i'm very sorry you lost your iron's bank though, that fkn sucks dude.

I would not enjoy that.

Cerberus has very high slash (100) defense, moderate stab (50) defense, and low crush (25) defense. Whips only have slash, while the LBA has 72 accuracy on slash and crush.
---
But he had nothing tho /s
---
It's very mediocre in ToB. Blowpipe or melee (with tent) outclass it in literally every single room. Additionally, scythe beats it at cerberus quite handily. Tbow isn't any more op than the scythe currently.

Do you understand how averages work? Let’s take wilderness bosses into consideration. They average 150k a kill. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Sometimes they’ll drop a 3m dragon pickaxe. Yes it could raise your average up temporarily. But OVER LONG PERIODS of time it all averages out. You could literally add up the drop table, multiply by rarity and divide by kills and get an average per hour. It’s an average. Sure there is RNG and you could get 10 expensive drops in an hour, but you could also go 5000 kills dry. 
---
oh forgot vorkath is undead....hold on
---
Yeah just let me take up extra inventory slot/slots for the runes and also sit doing nothing for 1 minute, definitely devalues stams.
---
Beeg thank me later

Why not just add a new prayer rather than replacing one that nobody complains about
---
Dfs is shit in most pvm situation, tho.
---
old piety would replace chivarly and new piety would require 75 prayer, and chiveraly require 70 prayer

Not only that, but I’d imagine Jagex wouldn’t be accepting towards it. Runelite already faced issues in the past with getting taken down

cracking it till it's cold with the boiz\*
---
You should probably add that in your post. Also yes, it's way to OP. 
---
Not to mention, making a new monster-specific prayer would be out of place. And it would be ridiculously OP when you already have undead specific boosts such as salve amulet, etc..
---
And you'd be completely removing a prayer also, that just wouldn't happen. 
---
Not trying to be a dick but this clearly wasn't a well thought out suggestion, seeing as how none of what you said would ever pass due to it being out of place, well overpowered, etc. 
---
When you get called out on being full of shit and suggesting an autopsy proves whether hands are up so you double down and try to say the other guy is the uninformed one
---
No, he doesn't understand how averages work. I've tried telling him to add up the drop table and compare to TTK to arrive at GP/HR, he seems to think that's a cross between mystic voodoo and a research project. The fact that he can kill something for more or less than the "established" gp/hr confuses him and he thinks he can uncover their "real" gp/hr or something, I'm not even sure how to tell him what he wants isn't a real thing, but what he needs to do is uncover a book on the utter basics of statistics. 
---
Please let iconicly placed become meta 
---
Yeah, but I dont have 60 attack. 
---
Decided to do a steel dragon task for the first time in an age the other day because why not, can’t be that bad, right? After about two minutes some dude turns up and starts monologuing a fictional story about a guy committing suicide and then starts typing ‘ahhhhhhhhhh!’ In the chat over and over. Never going back to steel drags again; it’s a strange, strange place.
---
It's just how it is unfortunately
---
Throw in a lil twitch tv “1 watching right now” and ya got me
---
Most of my skills are on the 50's, so I have barely discovered the game so far and can't talk about mid-high level content.
---
But to this point, I have been using RuneLite because it **is** better than the official one. I can check my ping and connect to a World that offers the best ping/number of players, as an example.
---
There are a lot of little things like that which add up and bring osrs to the next level without breaking it. Yeah, scimitar is better but that didn't stop me from using axes whenever I felt like, much like the XP stats don't force me to.
---
Runelite can be used to check up your performance and help you maximize your gains, but it in no way forces you to do so.
---
I think an tl;Dr for what I'm trying to say is: even if you disable every single plugin that helps you improve your gameplay, the plugins left still make RuneLite a huge upgrade over the official client.
---
Sucks but that's why you invest your time in actual skills and achievements rather than this stupid fucking game. 
---
It’s still exactly where it used to be
---
same honestly
---
5M? People paid 50-100M

Puppies are XP waste wtf u doin
---
Why are you being so snarky that I asked a question.  Why does everyone insist every question that gets asked should have been answered on its own and that you're either lazy or an idiot if you didn't want to do a data analysis project to find the spread of runescape monsters and bosses to their profits when you can use the internet and have the gall to consult a forum.  
---
&gt;Yes it could raise your average up temporarily. But OVER LONG PERIODS of time it all averages out. You could literally add up the drop table, multiply by rarity and divide by kills and get an average per hour. It’s an average. Sure there is RNG and you could get 10 expensive drops in an hour, but you could also go 5000 kills dry.
---
I'm really not sure what your point is here.  The problem is that people don't take long enough sample sizes when giving estimations on youtube -- sometimes the point isn't even to consider \*every\* drop on its drop table, only the significant ones.  Some monsters have a laundry list of items that are 1/512-1/5000 and I think even rarer.  I doubt most of the videos on youtube or guides on the internet did a sample of like 10,000 to figure out the true rate when you get each rare, and then averaged the rate against other durations it took them to get all the rares in other several thousand kill samples.  And rather than figure out my average kill/hr on a boss (which would require learning the boss first which is largely the point in figuring out which boss I want to do), then factor in how many drops I'll get for every boss, I boldly consulted r/2007scape.

HOW ABOUT PASSIVE PRAYER RECOVERY!?!? That'd be a sweet set bonus IMO - nothing fast though. Possibly tie it to prayer level and at 99 it's about the same rate as that place up in wilderness?

Makes sense, I think the song most nostalgic to me out of all of them is probably Harmony
---
Don't worry, its back to square one. I been hacked too. Jagex mods did not care about what you lose at all. All you can do now is rebuild. 
---
I believe you been hacked due to keylogger. Avoid visiting GETracking website or other likewise website. Also setup authentication and bank pin. I lost 2 accounts' bank worth, my main and alt. Both had Tbows and 600m+ worth of bank. Hacker will steal every rings imbued and runes. Annoying but now i am at 100m. 
---
You can check out my account profile if you dont believe that I have been hacked. Another thing is they dont drop your pet, so I am all good now.
---
Nice reword, if you said "I came here to say this" you'd get raped on downvotes.

Regardless of whether it's hidden or not those people still wouldn't vote. The average redditor is a smooth brained retard with very little game knowledge and will vote for whatever the shitty memes tell them to.
---
&gt; a lot of people see something is passing and just don't bother trying to vote against it as a result
---
Surely the fact that the poll for hiding poll results, hell any poll, failed is enough to explain why you're wrong right? Quite a few polls failed managed to make it into the passing threshold then failed right afterward like the spell icon sizes.

I had a dude come up to me and said I need your food and spec me multiple times with a dds, I ate all the food while he was killing me to spite him and then he left me to die, poisoned with no food

it is silly though. it also really heavily limits range gear progression 
---
One look at that tongue going "blelelelele", and I'm all over it.

---
Thanks for the encouragement, they did actually leave my pets and some untradeables, I just want to make sure if I do rebuild that this won’t occur again in the future, it’s not an item plea (although it sucks).  The main thing is to have control of my recovery email so I can change it and proceed with a brand new email that is not keylogged or hacked
---
But wouldn't it have to first pass a poll before it can be hidden.

It is good to be proactive

Idk if this still works but it did back in the day, you can also start walking to the spot where you want to stand, and as soon as your guy steps on to that spot follow or trade another player, or just click on any NPC and click back on the spot really quick and your guy will turn towards the direction of whatever you clicked without moving towards it.

There was some massive database of hacked info from various sites that got uploaded to the dark web recently. 
---
Yah, I started to realize that much later when I noted it fucking up DMM and Inferno in a reply above. 
---
Two ways to fix that, I think, would be to either prevent the spell from being cast in those areas, or make it so that it can JUST note items, not the other way around. 
---
Also, alching would be better for saving inventory space: all turns to coins. And you'd alch rune items anyways... Usually have a higher alch value than GE price
---

Are you free to play or members?
---
If you are f2p, I suggest spending money for the first month or until you can earn 3 million gold every 2 weeks for a bond. Content is limited in free to play though. 
---
If you already have a membership, start by questing. Go to os.rs.wiki and there should be an optimal quest guide there. Quests open up new areas and activities, so the more you can do them the better. 
---
Don't carry all your stuff with you all the time. Store them in a bank so you don't lose 90% of your things when you die. Knowledge is your best friend. The wiki given above is an up to date source of information. Search up areas you are heading to for the first time to find your way there and not die halfway. Bring cooked food that can heal you if you plan to explore potentially dangerous areas.

What I'm going to say is exactly what Jagex will say with different words: I'm honestly sorry for your loss, but I don't think anything can be done.

This recovery system is faulty since it was created, and since I got into RuneScape, two millennia ago, it wasn't absurd at all recover accounts that weren't yours. 100% Jagex fault there.

Can someone ELI5 please... like how is this game the only game where people are almost CONSTANTLY complains about getting hacked and whatnot. I don’t get why other games don’t have this problem on THIS scale. Everyday multiple new posts come up about being hacked. I get “not being stupid” and not clicking any shady links but at what point is this going to fall back on Jagex? I haven’t seen this big of a hacking problem in any other game I’ve ever played. As a casual player with about 500 or so hours in, if I ever lost everything I worked hard for in that amount of time, let alone 1000+!!!!!, I would never play this game again. I just want to understand what’s going on exactly and how this problem has not been attacked heavily. Anyone....please?? 
---
Happened to me with some dragon arrowtips while killing Wyrms on my phone, despite checking all my drops. Was only 120k or so but I sure felt stupid for missing it when I opened the chat and saw the loot message.
---
Found out later that Konar drops are placed on a different tile from Wyrms because reasons
---
Realistically the only "ranged only" account would be 99 ranged 10hp and all cannoned, but you can get Defence, Ranged and Hitpoints through ranged so that's a more normalized "ranged only" in either of those Prayer xp wouldn't be there, I was more asking how he got Prayer XP from ranged than ragging on him for doing so, I may have come across wrong.

If you're looking to get into bossing/raids you can join my clans CC "lootchasing" we would be more than happy to teach you some stuff and get you up to speed, everyone is fairly active and we like to chill and talk.

You can join my CC: "lootchasing" and we would be down to teach you, we are a pvm and social based clan that does raids and other bossing. You can add me ign: sk0tos and message me when I'm on and I'll get you into the discord!

Super often. Unless you're really, really slow, you'll always turn a good profit. I'd say when pkers showed up I'd have a 10% - 20% chance of getting pked. Stay south, have your tele ready, and pay attention and you'll be fine.
---
Don't get down because you get pked a few times. If it keeps happening (maybe 3 times within 3-5 trips), take a break, it's a hot spot at that point.
---
If it's anything like WG every time you bank you show big kills to a designated person and he writes down the kill and ticks who was there for it on an Excel spreadsheet
---
Aaaaaannd it's unnoted.

good luck my dude

Music player should be shoved under settings TBH ... It's a waste of space as a top menu. The spot it leaves can be used to instead automatically play Sea Shanty 2 
---
I really like this idea, Would make a worthwhile reward for a rangers guild update. Maybe the way to keep it balanced is you can still only carry 100 bolts per slot. 
---
It's totally possible I'm misremembering but I'm almost sure it was multiple. Yes with web

No protect item tho 😥

There is nothing wrong with gatekeeping when the situation calls for it, really.

I'm not saying it necessarily does here, since I don't care, but if you think it's an instance of bad gatekeeping you should explain why.

It makes sense you'd be able to get scales this way, but isn't the lack of sources part of some sort of difficulty/availability tuning? Even then, guess you could preserve the balance or whatever by having the number of scales obtained depend on some level like crafting or herblore.

Sure ur friend bob could do it. But for every bob out there, there is probably 5 other little jimmys that have no clue. Its about filtering the amount of unknowledgable voters. Also 1500 is hypothetical total lvl. I think around 1250ish would be more balanced.

That sucks. Time to finally give up on this game. Jagex doesn't give two shits or a fuck, and they've repeatedly made that abundantly clear. Not even gonna wait for my membership to expire, I'm gonna see about getting a refund for my remaining time. I suggest you jump ship too. They're not gonna help you, like they never helped me or anyone else. They don't care about their player base anymore. Fuck this stupid shit...

Need mage levels to make tabs, he’s an Ironman

Get a bank pin you coconuy

it does, but they often get in the way sadly

Shiiiiit you right tho

He should drop a spike that you put on your fancy boots to make them fancy fighting boots

this bait post looking for people who wanna be heros and give people money to look cool on reddit lamayoooooooooo

No, don't jump!

Fuck m8 as a chinese this sound so mandarin translated

You want to stay out of your opponents stack range.  If you just sit there ranging two tiles away they can 1 tick ags you and stack it with a big arrow hit.  If you’re moving, it makes it harder for your opponent to hit you, and also lets you get into 1 tick range

Not everyone is an English native speaker.

Is this from jagex? Lol

tldr: this is a troll post

You have the technology or the skills required to pull off that kind of procedure.

Games of change used to be against the rules too.

You can really make it look like you’re cranking it by alching while sitting in a chair in a POH

I don't actually follow runelite anywhere but a quick googling solved it fast enough

70 prayer makes everything a ton easier later but yeah, it’s slow and boring. I like herb runs but they aren’t for everyone :)
---
I was kinda with you but accusing Mod Ash of selling gold? Runescape is his life as far as anyone in this subreddit can tell. 
---
Don't go creating boogeymen in the shadows here mate. Speculation with your only evidence being that it's "hard to imagine them not doing it" is a personal thing and not something you should be repeating on Reddit. It's like going on Twitter on stirring up controversy over how some CS:GO player gambles on the side even though you have literally no evidence. 
---
Talk about things you know about, not speculation on the White Knight of OSRS being a cheater.
---
Hong Kong is the closest region that level3 communications operates in to Australia. I'm sure Jagex would struggle to find a worthwhile provider in Australia. Though the latency is still too high, even traveling that far. 
---
Dumb people have no say in anything.
---
Authenticator is only for logging into the client not the website so they compromise your account log in to the website and just take the authenticator off.
---
I agree. Way too many harmful polls pass.
---
Why did you leave channel as soon as you logged back in.. ?
---
But I eat food a few times every day to replenish my health.

You can do little to nothing with a given person's network information.

Pretty much website you use will at some point have a data breach. Shit we're posting on one now.
---
Go ahead and show full screenshots of your email inbox, not this minimized (probably inspect element edited) garbage. We should be able to see email, password and authenticator removal confirmation. 
---
So far what you've provided proves nothing more than the fact that you're lying.

Nude version next please

Seems legit. 
---
I managed to get Jad pet at 2kc but I was on slayer task so it wasn't that amazing
---
And that's why we love it.
---
At least for me anyway 
---
Dude, why would anyone believe this? They got everything from your bank but the PIN wasn't changed? You clearly either have a keylogger/viewer on your PC or you're a liar. Since your original post had a lie about when you came back, I'd guess it's all a lie.
---
I absolutely love the idea of getting reduced points for banning rooms. If you are unwilling to learn everything (after things have been balanced) you should be punished for it.
---
Some minor things I'd like to add to your post:
---
Crabs: let their colour go back to neutral white more quickly, requiring more precise timing but also less grief. Also let them give bonus points if every crystal was immediately hit with the right colour of orb
---
Rope: should stay as it is imo. It's the only puzzle that taxes your supplies. So it should be more rewarding than the others
---
Ice: nothing to add
---
Thieve: nothing to add
---
Mystics: nothing to add
---
Shamans: nothing to add
---
Vasa: absolutely love your suggestion btw. Similarly to olm crystals I'd like to see the hitbox on its rocks be better visually represented. As it stands, u get hit before the rock arrives.
---
Tekton: give it more hp, and more defense against stab and slash. But significantly less against crush. Elder maul should be best there, it's a friggin part of his body.
---
Vespula: in larger team sizes where not everyone has a twisted bow, even the redemp method doesn't squash this room. The grubs hatch so easily and the portal instant reset is extremely harsh. I've had it happen where in a team of 6, even 3 people dedicated to grub healing didn't prevent hatchlings. 
---
Vanguards: nerf the melee's mage def. It is way too hard to hit him in even max mage
---
Guardians: nothing to add
---
i hated doing that then i found out i can set my loot notification to like 1k  in chat and so anything over that i can see in my chat, sucks using having chat on mobile but is worth it.
---
Obviously you are special and have never pled in you’re life. But if I was them I would kill you for the potential of getting emblems as loot off you. 
---
#Not with that gear he didn't lmao 
---
That’s what I remember them for
---
Damn girl, those are some clean looking stats!  You scape with that account?
---
obsly, ppl just dont get hacked like this. there is no way.
---
isn't she suffering enough in that cage
---
What your personal email 2FA?
---
Literally...
---
My plugin toolbars keep having a super crazy graphical glitch. Is this a know issue? If not where would be the best place to report it?   
---
Sounds like a bug then. Maybe the maintenance was them working on releasing  Chinese servers, and put the wrong connections in 
---
Seriously 😢
---
Jingleflax
---
So can you explain why you just blatantly lied in your OP?
---
Or you know dont admit to doing raids with a guy 2 weeks prior... Nothing like selling yourself out. He even gave OP an out with hey maybe I'm wrong, nah you ain't wrong that was me.
---
Pm me a photo so I can verify the sexiness. Or you can just post one here.
---
Do you have to do this every time you get another 99 or just the first time you get the second 99?
---
Official game client has to work, every time, without failure. No matter what feature you use or where you are it has to work. Making sure everything works perfectly takes alot of time especially when you have to go through it weekly for updates. Runelite can handle minor bugs because it is not the official client and does not have to work perfectly
---
Lol, i always wonder who fall for this 😂😂😂😂
---
Lmfao wtf are you on

Oops that’s my bad there

It's on wheels, she still has freedom!
---
Congrats. 
---
Not your fault though, the game does a pretty shit job at forcing people to interact with each other. 
---
Well then let me just reiterate if you're new; virtually all of these posts, no, let me put it this way.. I have **NEVER** seen one of these scenarios actually successfully play out. I cannot recall from memory when someone had every single level of account security bypassed and it wasn't the fault of the account owner.
---
Ever since Jagex started restoring items/wealth for people who have been screwed by the game itself (whether this be DDoS attacks or whatever), people have been emboldened so much to the point as to create these fake ass "wahh I got hacked and it's not my fault" with the hope that Jagex will restore their wealth that they've RWT'd (most likely).
---
The truth of the matter is Jagex has great account security- no one should feel as though authenticator on your email/account and a bank pin is somehow not enough, when it is virtually 100% impossible to penetrate through without compromising your own personal info.
---
Maybe a few less than 5-10, thats pretty op. 
---
My spin on this idea would be crafting the hides into a new item that’s stackable, think like turning logs into arrow shafts. Then you either do something to them yourself to turn them into scales or take them to a specific npc who will take your scale shards and a form of payment to give you scales back. Thinking this way to allow a full inventory without needing to bank every 3 seconds. 
---
The shard amount per hide can scale with either your crafting or herblore level depending on balance. I wouldn’t even mind it if you averaged less than 1 scale per hide, I just don’t want to have to pick up scales off the floor. 
---
She doesn’t deserve this, please Jagex, do something!
---
Poll results shouldn't be hidden.
---
Hahaha that ain't bitching I'm just saying they've heard this a few times before. As for what they said I'll leave you in suspense
---
Or it gets the hose again
---
nice man i also have no friends on runescape lol i feel your struggles 
---
Lmao silence of the nans
---
Changed to 24
---
This is good news. Thanks again man for taking the time to clear it up for me and maybe some other peoples as well.

Yall are really acting like every meme here isn’t tired out

Cmon jagex you cant just let his grandma stay in there #freegrandma

ok turns out im a dummy. I grabbed the set from my POH. They look the same. Thanks for the help.

you forgot Narnia

You need the mage level to build the portals

Everyone hates crabs tho.

It really do be like that

Stop right there criminal scum! You have violated the law!
---
Forfeit your lucky loot and serve your sentence!
---
Seriously though, gratz on that superb lucky achievement diary task drop! :)
---
Its an extra drop, tf u whining about
---
I had a guy like that at Kurasks once before the Konar update though. He was killing then but leaving literally every single drop on the ground, including the rune longswords. I would just run up and grab/alch his drops one after the other while we both were doing the task. I think I made like an extra 750k just because he couldn't be arsed to pick anything up lol.
---
Whola lotta gang shit
---
That child then grew up to be the Kalphite Queen.
---
The name did it for me. Support.
---
Look at the Jmods latest reply. OP is sketchy af. I believe if you take all precautions to keep your account safe and secure, you don't have anything to worry about.
---
Alternatively: 
---
“I am not a bot, I’m seriously”
---
*Thank you*.
---
What a thicc ass 👌
---
Panties&amp;Pantyshots &gt; Feet. It's just truth. And those are some *amazing* panties.
---
its a slayer nerf
---
I didn't know that either until like 60 farming lmao
---
Dhcb and no anguish. Huge waste. 
---
Downgrade, it’s not worth waiting.
---
Keep the growb redwood around for when you do get the contract.
---
Good. Being required to interact with other players shouldnt be a thing 
---
My little cousin tells the exact same story haha
---
Twice more today
---
Why do people want them to be hidden?
---
This is why you don't try to be smart.
---
I'll upload it later when I'm at my PC
---
Mods still not enforcing rules, trash tier mods
---
Speak for yourself. I don't care either, but I have personally seen plenty of closed minded OSRS players who are vehemently against anything that sounds remotely similar to anything from RS3, regardless of if it would make a good update or not. Yet they'll turn around and be in favor of things they never knew existed in RS3.
---
Found the looter 
---
So is HP
---
You end on the W. It's like a dart throw
---
Don't listen to him, he lies when he types....
---
Yes, because it interrupts combat... Are you stupid?
---
Not sure if you're being serious but you can only have one of any pet
---
rip w/e you just lost kek salt 
---
That's what I did? Drinking options and eating food interrupt combat. They always have.
---
Why are you being stupid on purpose?
---
Dont smoke the supply tho
---
Is there not 2FA for web log ins? Honestly, the fact so many occurred and you guys did nothing to warn him makes me scared about putting any more effort into OSRS.
---
Same here. Bank management is my biggest downfall, the amount of times I've pulled barrows and void gloves is crazy. They just look like plain black leather gloves, I wish they had some white or a more unique pattern to match the helms and elite body and legs. 
---
Buy like 2 bonds lmao
---
Jampacks
---
You had bad security.
---
So people will vote for what they actually want, rather than be influenced by the popular vote? 
---
By doing rfd? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? I only claimed you do not need rfd for FEROCIOUS GLOVES. There is no link whatsoever between ferocious gloves and barrows gloves. Barrow gloves are NOT required.
---
Being able to bank 'all' or 'x' of an item in my inventory in one click has been a blessing for such a small adaptation. I really enjoy it for skilling tasks such as Flecthing, Cooking ect. Currently i can access the bank, bank all of my tiaras, refill my inventory with silver and access the furnace all without needing to left click. However once i access the furnace i have to left click 'all' to craft all of my silver bars. Would be nice if quantity options were added to the silver casting menu so that i could just 1 click the tiaras to craft all. Feedback is welcome, perhaps if this gains enough traction we can see it in a up an coming update. Cheers 
---
D 
---
They are profiting a lot due to a handful of whales spending exorbitant amounts of money on microtransactions, not due to many players or overall engagement. The game is still dying in terms of player base. Worlds are mostly empty, most items can't even be purchased on the Grand Exchange without waiting hours, etc.
---
omg i got a rare drop and didnt make bank?!?!?!
---
am i the first one ever in the world?!?!?!?! 
---
shut up retard 
---
No, it doesn't. Scythe is only better on extremely select few monsters. Range is king in dps in general. 
---
Obviously some things are better as melee, but that doesn't change the FACT that range is the highest dps for the majority of things.
---
Pick Flax

mod ash is one of my favorite developers on the team, He is a hero.

Explorer ring for cabbage tele?
---
Oh okay, so you're just dumb. Not sure how you being the original poster is a defense, just makes you worse.
---
Tbh I added someone in game ln I was just double checking to see if he still had me added, was seeing if he was the hijacker
---
Yes, Its all on a case by case basis Runelite submits approval for all their plugins. Jagex has stated that zulrah plugins are agaisnt the rules. 
---
*Realistically you have a pretty low chance of being banned if you did use your own depending on the implementation but I just wanted to make it clear that yes you are violating the rules doing that*
---
It's still 2 rares in 2 kc, just take the wins when they pop up, man
---
I was wearing a fury(not even a fucking anguish) instead of a salve for a good 100 kills when I first started farming him. Next 100 went by much faster 
---
You're new to the game. Keep playing. You will encounters many lucky situations in your journey
---
2100-2199 master race
---
Yeah.. why do you say that 😰 even if there’s solid proof that HE botted and not me ?
---
IDK man, seems like she's enjoying being in there
---
Nothing is stopping you from doing slayer after 99, i'm at like 16m xp now and it's still fun. Plus after 99 slayer odds are you have the skills/gp to raid, and that's easily 500+ hrs of gameplay there. 
---
It's 13m and it's about 13m in Oak planks 
---
I don't have a problem with wintertodt my problem is that you really don't use it for anything else when you can just use the endless fire at rogue's den and having weapons that would require having a certain level requirement for Firemaking would give it a lot of value.   
---
When you have a skill lacking overall the other skills lack and then woodcutting becomes less valued which is my main reason for bring it up as a discussion.
---
yea that's word for word exactly what he said
---
Exactly zero countries use the comma for **BOTH** the decimal place and the way to group large numbers. It’s either 1.000,00 or 1,000.00. Never 1,000,00.
---
This is why we’ve put a man on the moon and whatever the fuck country you’re from hasn’t. 
---
It's essentially a 20m gp pile for non-irons such as OP
---
It’s never worth it to plant magic trees for farming xp, and if you plant them for farming contract, you make profit
---
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? Why would this guy use a VPN from 9 different countries from WEB ACCESS only? Not CLIENT.
---
Nice, Gratz! Such a long grind
---
Also, screenshot are your friend ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It's how they keep you members. Remember they have no incentive to keep you f2p as that generates no revenue.
---
 The OSRS team is fantastic but at the the end of the day you have to remember that they are a business. The whole model is that F2P is a large demo not meant to be a long term way to play the game. 
---
Don't expect any changes to this. Its been suggested for 10 years now from back in RS2 days to present. They are happy with the current model. 
---
This is very funny but at the same time Jagex does need to add mid game content, it seems you grind just to get to end game content like raids and bossing but there's no actual content other than quests on the way up the levels. 
---
I'm very disappointed that the achievement cape does not match the armour 
---
This is one case in thousands, though. Most of the time people *need* to post here to even get a proper response.
---
Woah how'd you get that kinda money with those stats 
---
No
---
It's not really about the grind its more about it's utility as a skill almost every other skill you push to get a specific item you want to use but that feels dead in Firemaking.
---
And that’s incredibly stupid compared to how powerful rigour and piety are which is beneficial in both PVP &amp; PVM settings. A small damg buff to augury is nothing compared to how powerful the others are.
---
Magic is based around utility, not just damage. You can freeze and poison enemies, lower their stats and heal off them as well as hitting multiple enemies at once. 
---
Of course it’ll be worse at traditional bosses, but it isn’t useless or underpowered. 
---
well just read the mod reply youll understand 
---
Which are registered as npcs. Similar to the objects at Skotizos lair, where the altars are actually npcs but made out to look like an actual object.
---
True it doesn't make a whole lot of sense but they made the best of it. Wintertodt created a niche use atleast for FM (Mainly ironmen).
---
Honestly with the current state of skills I think we have alot of other skills right now that take priority for needing updates. 
---
Pretty much. You took the risk logging on to his computer and then he gained access and broke TOS. They warn you about logging on to a shared pc
---
I’d cut your losses and hit up that friend for some money since he’s the one that screwed you
---
I think it has just as much a direct effect if their on your team too. It's just that you're rewarded for it if they're on your team lol
---
It's called pures
---
Dhcb is the single most worth item in game and you should absolutely spend your whole bank on it 
---
It's my birthday too :D
---
Someone hasn’t done dragon slayer 
---
Too poor
---
Cackles maniacally over his stack of a thousand scrolls.
---
you need to ditch this "friend"
---
Are you sure?
---
I love the ''we put a man on the moon'' argument. Did you personally contribute to that? What did you do to make that possible? Is that the only special achievement you can brag about?
---
Make a new account,that ban isn’t going anywhere,you took the risk of logging onto a share pc,no offense but it is what it is
---
Yes, your ip address.
---
I've sure seen someone run from Varrock to Aroudgne
---
Got told I buy gold yesterday because I was using 3a mage on my zerk :(
---
RIP. Your account is probably a green dragon bot now. Should have had an authenticator.
---
If not we'll have to farcast her and telegrab the loot
---
Unfortunately I’m behind on my questing! I’ll get to it eventually :) but yeah def right, mythical cape is probably a BiS cape for chainmace setups
---
g
---
It's called an authenticator, but you can't just lock the account no matter what without a backup method to recover it. This is why you also need an email with 2FA.
---
That poor account didn’t deserve slavery 
---
Username checks out.
---
is there a sub for these?
---
For my school at least all I had to do was open the client at home and go to school with it still open and from there I could just log in at school.
---
what do you mean salve amulet doing work in mm1 tunnels and why is it not worth it compared to the one in mm2. end of the day i will get 99 range in couple hours why does it matter that just longs out the process even more even though it's more efficient.
---
Because unlike other skills prayer isn't trained by killing monsters, but burying bones
---
Justicar’s effect doesn’t work in pvp and magic defence is more important. 
---
However the guy was just camping pray magic while he had to switch to melee/range and perhaps a tank leg switch would have been good.
---
The thing i hate most is when people dress up rich and ask for cash and then there comes a noob and gives him that cash, and the dude just logs to a different world, just to do it again and again.
---
I hate these kinds of people and i'd like to let them know too lmao.
---
It won't connect to the servers if i do that.
---
Blood runes, water runes, death runes
---
or
---
death runes, astral runes, earth runes
---
Play with a pestle and morter lmao
---
This is taken from a top post on r/kanye. And no, it’s not a crosspost, because credit was not given in the title. This is a REPOST.
---
Ooh good catch my bad — I used a ring of wealth for tele but seedpod is definitely preferred. 
---
Sometimes if I wanted to extend trips I’d just take the ether out of my bracelet, it definitely builds over time! 
---
100k points an hour is not good, that's 8 hours for 800k points.
---
Runescape uses a certain port when you play the game, if this port or any uncommon port is blocked on your school you won’t be able to play.
---
Easyscape.  Level your agility, level your magic for teleports, use stamina potions, use energy potions if you're poor, use jewelry teleports, or bank your gear before you run from Lumbridge to Varrock.
---
Low level players won't see this as a "bonus" for using roads, but rather a penalty for going anywhere else, discouraging them from exploring other places.
---
Since when you couldn't train defence with ranged
---
I'm really confused he was at gargoyles why was he in level 20 wilderness?? Did they add gargs to the rev caves?
---
Hey man appreciate the help, I’ve been trying to juggle work along with trying to make sure all my other accounts are safe not linked with Osrs.  I just hope this issue gets resolved so emails are linked with 43 rs accounts are banned and can’t be recovery emails like the one Mod Stevew talked about.  (I still don’t know how to change my recovery email)
---
Why do I need a higher prayer level to be able to bury/sacrifice a different type of bone? It doesn't take a high prayer level to dig a bigger hole. 
---
If this were actually 07, Mod West would have been temp muted.
---
Thank Bandos for 2019
---
The same thing but without the cash stack and one less charge on the ring.
---
Then you sometimes see it go from 1 to 2 and get excited for a second, but then it goes back down to 1 again.
---
dude, seriously its crazy! I just started going to my local community college again. I would often have to go to the library to print something, and I shit you not, literally 6/8 times I went to go log into my e-mail, someone simply did not log out of theirs prior to me.
---
I had access to pay-pal information, all sorts of social media accounts, basically anything I wanted. Youd think this day and age the younger generation would be more hip to cyber security, but it honestly couldn't be the opposite. I even mentioned something to the librarian, for them to post a memo or something, and she just couldn't have gave a shit less. 
---
Nice, pretty cool info
---
But really, yellow text on white background?
---
ok let's not get too far
---
So you’d need level 40 to use d bones?
---
Imagine the uproar of pures
---
Yes.  The max damage of most spells also scales with your magic level.
---
Wait, not everyone does this already?
---
To be honest I didn't know about authenticator until now. Is there anyway to recover it? Also why wouldn't I be receiving emails from jagex? 
---
Dude, who the fuck are you to decide if a drop is "deserved" or not. Go suck your own cock and alch yourself retard. 
---
I protected salve, defender, mace, and helm if I used protect item (unless I get a drop worth more than the helm, like d legs). Forgot to include ring of wealth in my setup, my bad! Lv30 tele is essential
---
The experience has changed because of black chins though. They're higher xp and higher gp. Why is it so unreasonable to balance the triangle (high xp, high gp, safe). Currently red chins are safe, reasonable xp, reasonable gp, while black chins are unsafe, high xp, high gp. Is adding a high gp, safe, low xp method, and a safe, high xp, low gp method, really so unreasonable?
---
w330 my boy
---
He superior one especially.. dear god
---
You’re getting 10-12k points per kill. 
---
Killing one inadequacy this way gives 6/7X that. So it’s a lot faster.
---
I switched to this method for the same reason you posted and got the imbuement in about 2-3 hours.
---
Lmao right
---
I hope they don't change anything about how run energy works. It doesn't need changing. 
---
Not if he’s a btw
---
Gl on pet!!! Pog champion !!! Let’s go boys!!! 
---
 what do you mean by 'Killing one inadequacy this way gives 6/7X that.' what method? what monsters did you kill with melee prayer on?
---
Minigame tele to rat pits gets you to port sarim
---
No my ptsd is triggered 
---
Read please, the jmod already said that the "hacker" knew "OP's" email 2FA. If you can have your own email 2FA bypassed, then youre fucked everywhere, not just runescape. They need access to your email to get rid of ingame 2fa or change anything about your account
---
That might explain why it has been attacked since the account creation.  I made the switch to RL when it came out.
---
what are your combat stats? I have the requirements to start this quest but not too sure if my combats too low
---
Although it's sat on 0, this is the correct answer. 
---
Isn't this the grandma from the csgo dude?
---

Lol grow up it’s a comment, anyone upset by this is as bad as the rest of the Internet snowflakes.

I think I am the only player with a skull secrpute. Use it for my fashion scape

You're saying that as if Falador's guards are innocent creatures that just want to live in peace.

and to be honest it is not clear that you mean person = email. Just being pedantic but they still can make a new email and change ip.

They need to have no 2FA for web logins so you can reset your password if you lose your phone without having to do a full recovery request. 
---
It's the world we live in, dude. You may not hear about it, but people do get hacked in other games very frequently.  What I'd like to know is: can someone remove an authenticator without having access to the account's email address or recovery email? Because if yes, that's fucked. 
---
What on earth is that runespan criticism supposed to mean? The new content makes it a part of the skill. 
---
Don’t tell me to grow up when I’m just trying to clear up your confusion, asshole. Jesus. Who’s the real snowflake here.
---
You said it, man.
---
Yeah, tried it all

Calling someone a gigantic pussy for having basic security concerns is pretty overly dramatic mate

i found this on Google.    steps for windows 10 how to   
---
1. Select the desired folder.
---
2. Right-click on it.
---
3. Click on Restore Previous Version option.
---
4. Next, Windows will enlist Previous Versions Permanently Deleted Files Or Folders with Time and Date.
---
5. Select the Latest.
---
6. Click Restore.
---
so yea if my bitch ass can do it,  then the FBI  can restore that thing after you drop it in lava. they could probably plug into your eyeballs and recover your memory's  
---
Thanks

2k+ total for skilling questions.
---
Infernal cape for pvm questions.
---
Certain BH ratio or dmm experience for pvp questions.
---
The game would be better.
---
And there is no way to change this?
---
I’m almost certain making the weekly update videos is not his full time job. He probably has another job somewhere and uses his editing skills to make some more money off jagex
---
it assumes 4+1
---
no the chart means usefulness in raids, period not just for 1 hand
---
"Denied" 
---
Because the risk of bad updates passing would be smaller.
---
Yeah, it's the best upgrade for dps, but I think what they're saying is that there is coif boots shield and the blessed dhide upgrades for like 1-2% cost of the dhcb.  Realistically the dhcb increases damage while the others only accuracy and prayer as you mentioned
---
Concrete walls, Mobile connection just doesnt cut it.
---
agreed f2p energy is just abysmal energy potions dont even compare to staminas maybe make super energy f2p and enable this.

Something is fucking wrong with you.

Sorry bout that. It's not much better here in Australia if that makes you feel better.

scythe justifies it bc tob is like 8M+ hr and you can’t get that anywhere else

I'll never forget doing this on my main osrs account. Some guy did loads of damage to elvarg and died and then I swooped in...

You know people have though.

To be fair rc IS pretty slow and the tunes generally are not worth that much (for efficient xp methods)

Can you confirm if he had a Bank PIN?

salve for vorkath, which is the main reason people get it

Would actually be pretty dope, I would invest heavily if I could

What is Jagex reviews?

You should be using a crossbow with broad bolts my dude.

and can you use  friend's fairy ring?
---
Did you ever find what came in the mail today?
---
Pain. And misery. Just need to pray that whoever buys Jagex is better than the current Ching Chon Ping Pong company. 
---
It seems like he was the problem as a quick look through his profile he leaves racist comments like [this one](http://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ai5oyz/i_know_this_isnt_07_but_can_something_be_done/eelpj35) so I'm not surprised at him harassing the wdr staff. Thanks for taking the time to keep wdr running well by the way! 
---
Why do people sound so happy in the comments? This isn’t necessarily a good thing, since a company with less interests for the game could buy it and ruin it, Right?
---
Do the rumble in Hard mode, it's what I do and I can get up to 400k points an hour, I'm up to 10m points after a couple days (and I already used a couple mill imbuing all my gear). Leave it AFK for a few hours while you study or watch a movie, and at the end of like 5-6 hours you should have enough to imbue.
---
Had no idea, came back to osrs 2 weeks ago after a break. Now i feel like one of those "report instantly" dicks. Thanks for the Info!
---
yes
---
&gt; Remembered the month and year they created their account
---
Bruh that was like 15 years ago I can't remember that shit.
---
No i enjoy them
---
Never knew in my 13 years of off and on rs playing, now i feel like a dick.
---
You know exactly what it means for us.
---
Never thought it was a good spot. Im a dick and im probably done reporting people in weird spots.
---
That looks like the guy that scammed my dhcb. What was his username?
---
D:
---
Better off at sand casino 
---
I think this is literally the average xp in each skill 
---
They should introduce a consumable item that temporarily buffs your weapon so that that npcs killed drop cooked meat instead of raw, or maybe allow you to create a fire with your bare hands by interacting with a tree. 
---
must’ve came from rs3

just hit 98 slayer. nothing from superiors.

It really does not at all...VPNs? Possible holiday locations? The information the reply provides does not go against GDPR laws, it is too vague to be able prosecute against. Also no countries were actually named in the post, so that kinda blows your argument right out of the window.
---
I'm not that close since I need either tbow or acb+sgs. And I hate doing saradomin gwd so I'm very good at procrastinating infernal cape : \^ ) Also I still don't have the CoX prayers.
---
I would definetly not grind out an ely before doing inferno, that's for sure. Unless I get it early and before an arcane.
---
Maybe will watch a guide, maybe not.I have a friend who has done inferno a few times so he might coach me on it.

If this is real then what in the actual fuck
---
There are more nods weak against ranged than their are slash, first of all. So you chose an npc with a really low defence. Nit to mention range is a safer alternative to melee with like 90% of npcs including some bosses. You are trading safety for extra dps. 
---
Most npcs can be infinately safe spotted with range without any healing supplies.
---
Range is the strongest form of combat in the game. Where melee is weak, ranged is strong. Where melee is strong, ranged is still strong.
---
Unplayable 
---
I like to use max house hosts for this purpose, but the issue is w330 is laggy as hell, but recently a guy has been hosting on 520 and its great
---
Email auth. They cant get your account if they cant accsess your email. 
---
Its only +5 ranged accuracy over RCB, if that is worth it to you then yes buy one.
---
Id personally get an Anguish, Archer’s Ring, and maybe Twisted Buckler if you arent fussed about Prayer Bonus, since they offer more ranged bonus but are more cost effective
---
oh you need to be on the same world? :(
---
Passwords aren’t even case sensitive lol
---
You’ve definitely got an important point. 
---
Everyone wants to to avoid recreating turmoil, myself included. 
---
A true glass cannon prayer would only subtract defense from the person using the prayer, not add additional defense (in other words reduce the opponent’s DPS), nor would there be any stat drain of the opponent (that’s a no no.) There would need to be a visual cue too so the opponent could see the prayer activate, whip out the 1t AGS for  essentially a guaranteed hit, and have a viable counterplay. 
---
Glass cannon prayers would also have to either drain prayer point on activation or avoid 1t flicking. 
---
For PvM, the glass cannon prayers would need to take the place of overheads and/or reduce the effectiveness of overheads from 100% to the 40% dmg reduction in they have in PvP. 
---
I don’t want to get too personal on this page but I have been to several different countries since 2015, NEVER Europe (my email security told me it was there) however.  The email with 43 linked users that my account has been changed to was definitely not me, the  since 2015 have been me which is why the passwords were inputted correctly and the recovery email was  not been changed until the “hijacker’s” recent request.  Thank you.
---
Yeah I thought that too, it's basically slayer but for X skill. The reason it's appealing is because rs is a sandbox mmo, and these sort of things encourage you to go out and about and do a variety of things in this sandbox, giving you a reason to go to otherwise completely unused areas.
---
Artisan was a skill a few people seemed in favour of, I liked the idea, but I didn't like it as a skill because it would be the only skill in the game where there isn't one single thing your character is improving at, would sort of feel like dungeoneering did back in the day.
---
I think overall this 'Task' based content could be a good fit for guilds, as long as it stays in guilds only, and isn't used to disguise itself as content for other things.
---
I think the first time is only $1k, second offence is 1k + 3 points and 3 or 7 day suspension and third is 1k + 6 points and 30day
---
Yeah thats exactly my point, over the course of 200m fishing its even more.  But 90-99 would take u around 260 hours fishing karambwans, spending 260 hours for only 6k extra karambwans really isnt that much dude. It would ultimately only save u less than 6 hours in the 260 hour grind of collecting that much karambwans.

Are you looking to get your ass beat?

Slayer Masters are the highest level of HAM, the big bosses. Not like those d-bags in the purple robes. 
---
Wow, you know this could be a massive RS conspiracy? involving the slayer masters and a plot to massacre monsters on a large scale to the point where it became an actual skill in Runescape.
---
Interesting, now we just need the quest.
---
Excuse me if I sound or am retarded but does the separation of rolls not make it less rare? Like how you hit the table then it rolls for the item?

No, why?

If anyone has a better special effect let me know =)
---
Why does black dhide need to be nerfed in order to make these viable? They would be a straight improvement with your proposed changes
---
Secondly, when you say '10% more ammunition', do you mean that the chance of ammunition not breaking would be increased from 80 to 90%? Or that the chance it breaks gets decreased from 20% to 18%?
---
100% agree.
---
Say if this were part of a new prayer book, then a player using said prayer book would not, by design, be able to 1t flick.
---
Loop half of key?! Grats!!!
---
I see a golden age gentlemen.
---
Rune ore wildy

I think it should have the same stats as black d’hide (or even blessed), with the poison/venom immunity but no other special.
---
Feelsgoodman
---
they’re getting banned for rwt not botting 
---
I didn't know DFS protected against wyvern breath. Buckler because you don't stay in wyvern range so it's not needed, but changing both gives the same result.
---
Had no idea it was that profitable, will give it a go now, thanks mate. 
---
Very hard to be hacked while 'protected', between 2FA and bank-pin alone. Common way people are hacked is with a RAT (remote administration tool) or through phishing (usually an email with a fake link). If you stay away from clicking things, visiting those 'giveaways' people spam in GE, etc you should be OK.
---
Even if your system is compromised, your phone is not. 2FA is impossible to go around (unless you use authy and log into it via your desktop, then you are opening a security hole). 
---
ODDD PARENTS FAIRLY ODD PARENTS
---
You know they get the emblems too if you die right? That’s like 260k right there
---
No. It’s POTENTIALLY 8m/Hr. You could go 200 raids dry and make nowhere near that.
---
Joe dirt hehe
---
It falls in the same category as Craws/DHCB IMO. If all you do is ToB then its 100% worth investing your entire bank into, but it's not that great elsewhere because of the huge maintenance cost, so despite being a huge boost to the best moneymaker, it's still not really worth it if you don't do it that much.
---
That depends on the methods they can use to try to crack it. If they're manually cracking it then it will take around 100 hours according to Google and jagex should be cutting them off pretty quick after a few failed attempts. 
---
But if you are generalizing and saying any 4 digit pin as a password anywhere takes a long time to crack, an encrypted file on your computer that can be cloned and brute forced for example would take milliseconds to crack. But anything that's web based shouldn't allow you to obtain these files to crack locally. 
---
And were also assuming theres no way to remove a pin a different way. I dont know enough about account security on rs to say if it's true or  not. I'd like to assume it's not true for my own sanity but I see way too many posts saying that whoever got into their account got through their pin. (Probably all these posts are rwt and hoping they get lucky enough to get restored which I think jagex has only done maybe once or twice for their own glitches)
---
In a 7 man FFA chambers, assuming that everyone averages close to 20k points, the chance of *anyone* receiving a bow would be 1/214
---
If you're not doing 7 man FFA then then it's more like 1/1500 with 20,000 points solo.
---
I believe I did the calculations correctly but if anyone thinks it's wrong feel free to correct me.
---
Every thread with an account that has been hijacked like this has the same comments about "There are ways to bypass a pin" and every thread when people ask how nobody knows. Pretty sure everyone is just quoting past threads and there is 0 evidence this exists. 
---
How are the other two not cheats?
---
A different example to show how stupid your last two are: I could spend 16 hours a day working on improving my aim in a FPS (impractically), or I can just pay $5/month for some cheats.
---
People press yes to anything without reading the text anyways even if it's with hidden answers sadly
---
No, It’s ON AVERAGE 8m/Hr. You could go 200 raids and get a scythe every single time and make way more than that.
---
I feel like a lot of people vote on things they don’t know about just because a lot of others do. I agree with you.
---
there's a rumour going that black d hide will be nerfed because its almost as good as karils but costs 40k. -and increased from 80 to 90% =) do you have any better ideas for it? 
---
I do realise that you're a fucking nerd hahahahahahahahaha go complain about more runescape shit dude!!!!
---
Aah just searched it, I was wrong.
---
First offence: 3 days suspension and $1,000 fine
---
Second offence: 7 days suspension and $2,000 fine
---
Three or more offences: 30 days suspension, $3,000 fine and six demerit points
---
Took effect Jan 1st 2019
---
Mm2 all the way, while the req’s are quite a bit it’s worth it. Full void with a fury/anguish &gt; salve because salve ei only effects the monkey your targeting while the other Ammy’s go for all in the splash. 
---
You sound like my friend. Motherfucker was nice enough to loan me an anguish for us at GwD. I’ve only ever been burned by trusting people on this game and it’s so weird to see someone trust me with this wealth. Definitely restores some of my faith in people. 
---
Yikes, even worse lol. Not worth to even have your phone out 
---
We riot?
---
If you have an account already registered with your current email then yes, you'll need to create another email account
---
I think there is already a plug-in which tells you how much spec damage you’ve done 
---
lol
---
They should something implement something that filters out those who haven't tried the content that is being polled. For example, something to do with raids will only allow votes from people who have completed at least one raid or something to do with pking only allows those who have killed st least one person or something. Would something like that work out?
---
This I didn’t even know this was a thing until I posted something similar and someone suggested the same thing.
---
I feel good about my account
---
I also deposited everything into the bank before I log just for that extra go F yourself if something was to happen
---
Right. What good is that when you need to rebuild bank NOW?
---
Most of those trips were during the holidays I can list most of them.
---
Yeah my buddy had tons of trouble with galvek to finish DS2, so I told him "here borrow my dhcb and see how it works out" messages me that night and tells me he got it first attempt with the dhcb" now he's able to farm vorkath to make some extra cash on the side.
---
Charles guide isn't really a guide more of a here is how to deal with different situations and various safespot tricks and ways to prayer flick certain monster stacks. It won't walk you through the waves nothing really can, you just have to learn through getting faster at reading the spawns. 
---
I know this is an old post, but thanks for the tip. Appreciate it. 
---
Nope. Especially if you drive to work every day, not having a car would be terrible
---
Go complain about more reddit shit while begging for attention
---
i’m confused... Even if you don’t get a unique, the regular loots are still like 600k - 1M. So even if you go 200 dry, which is super rare, you’re still making 1.2M-2M/hr if you’re getting consistent completions 
---
Limbo was a short but amazing game. Absolutely loved it.
---
Nice life 
---
I'm on a throwaway porn account, I like rule34 and I appreciate this guys work. No shame from me 😉

If enjoying pics like this means something is wrong with me, then you're right!

Is BP vital for sara? Dia/ruby bolts E not work? I want to do Sara but not zulah. 
---
Definitely could be the case. Only time will tell... 
---
Grind more zulrah then do slayer when you have bp
---
it's bad for osrs because any change would be bad at this point because it's been going so well, but maybe rs3 can hold out some hope
---
Lucky I carpool with 4 others so I get to hop on mobile on the hour drive to work and hour drive back. Only drive 4 times a month 
---
Banshees are great for early slayer levels, drops seem to be a lot better than other stuff at the same level. 
---
That's not what xlogging is though...
---
He just normally logged out on you.
---
Xlogging is literally just closing your client while you are still logged in. This will forcefully log you out after 60 seconds even if you are in combat so that you can log back in again.
---
Now ofcourse if you close the client you cant do anything so anyone attacking you has 60 seconds to kill you.
---
old photo i dont use osbuddy pro anymore :)
---
Or like me, you could have a dragonfruit tree ready to check and get a palm tree contract instead, that you downgrade to a pineapple contract that then gets downgraded to a curry tree contract. FML.

Who's going to be the one to tell him...?

Didn't want anyone getting upset at me throwing a dick in their face, ya know.

seeing /r/2007scape on /r/all brings me great joy

This is pretty vague information you are providing, and I don't know what Google Translate has to do with anything. If you want someone to help you, you need to specify all the details you can.
---
* Are trying to use your phone or a computer? 
---
* If you are using a computer, is it your personal computer or the school computer?  
---
* If you are using a computer, is the internet connection established wired or wireless?
---
With the limited details you provided no one can provide you a solution because we don't know if this is a block on the firewall level or on the application level. 
---
For an idea on how strong/weak this is, consider 2 inventory slots:
---
\- 2 pots of white berries jam restores 44 Health points and restores 40 prayer points
---
\-1 shark and 1 prayer potions restore 20 Health points and restore 4\*(20/24/31) = (80/96/124) prayer points (at 52/70/99 prayer respectively)
---
Seems pretty balanced considering that there's quite a few steps in making the jam.
---
I like the idea! (numbers can always be balanced further, the concept is very cool!)
---
For them to consider selling ownership of Jagex means they've fulfilled full cash cow milking of the main game and must somewhat believe it's at the end of it's life cycle.
---
However this must also mean that they see just how strongly averse osrs is to the same premise, to consider selling up without either first testing the potential for additional revenue from osrs or believing ownership value would be that heavily decreased by risking such a move before selling off.
---
Says a lot for the game and potentially the relations of the osrs team and those in power. 
---
Cant we just not nerf black dhide?
---
Just got my first bond!
---
As someone that played a lot of runescape from 2003-2010 but no EOC and no OSRS until recently it's obvious that there's been a ton of power creep. It's not good for the game long term if the updates that add new power aren't balanced out against previous content.
---
Well thought out and nice concepts but I think the idea of the Jams being the equivalent of potions but made through cooking instead of herblore to give some slight healing isn't really necessary. 
---
While small, they would benefit lower level players and be slightly cheaper than potions (at a logical standpoint) but by the time you're farming Papaya, lets say if you're an Ironman, you've probably got the level for the required potions regardless with herblore which would make the method redundant. Also with the brews with honey, no one really wants to farm flowers and you skip most of the low level ones with the quests.
---
The barbarian mixes are shit because they only recover 3x2 and 6x2, and require both a potion and roe/caviar
---
If it used just farming produce and no herbs, it'd be much more accessible
---
That said, I think the original concept still need some number tweaking
---
Something something tbow
---
If you're 100 combat, yes. 
---
lasagna new bis food
---
I do have a Magic Bow which i could pair with some Adamant arrows? Do you have any suggestion for what to use or would that be fine
---
Convincing yourself of something doesn’t make it a fact. Learn that sooner rather than later.
---
Exactly. It's like when drug dealers give small sample for free and then customers are addicted for rest of the life. 
---
Main thing is to enjoy it!  
---
I would buy teleport rings / necklaces / amulets for getting around.
---
No. You need legends/hero's quest done,  which gives defence xp. 
---
Should have added some music!
---
Sadly only 1 Ranarr for me, though the Easy Clue did give 98k + the Mystic gloves are nice, didn't really have magic gloves before
---
Add another comma just for good measure.
---
What's it like at 99?  X4 or x3?
---
Unless you’re really good at flicking, it’s arguably more effective to duo/trio bosses like bandos and zammy due to the faster kills and longer trips.
---
its like 2k chins an hour, do the math yourself, if we can do it, you can
---
x3, but x4 with graceful
---
Can I ask what you did (or where) for hobgoblins, imps, skeletons, and zombies?
---
really love this idea
---
Damn I remember this, this era was the games prime for me 
---
Godwars can be done as a team.
---
Birdhouses at early levels then salamanders 
---
Eh what's full guided like 5-10m? Dude coulda posted up spinning flax for a week and made that.

Lmfao 
---
Gg bro! Hope it goes well for you! Add me if you need any tips, my rsn is Chaseus
---
Damn it man I was with you up until now
---
&gt;He just normally logged out on you.
---
But how though. He was still in combat.  I was still attacking him.  That's what I don't understand.  In all my years of pking I've never had someone be able to log out while I am attacking them.
---
Like someone else said, he’d need quests that give defense exp, he’d also have to be maxed including attack with like 90 prayer to be 100 combat 
---
This is how you get Olly
---
They did a great job of making these looks like veiny testicles. 
---
&gt; I have no source I just believe I've heard this.
---
horrid
---
I dont believe 100 combat is possible on a 1 def pure, and he needs legends quest either way so it's a no.
---
Find a method of inebriation like weed or alcohol,hunter is the worst skill ingame
---
was this in a recent update? I got 99 fm when todt first came out and don't remember this feature
---
Blessed dhide is same stats as black dhide except blessed gives an extra 1 prayer stat
---
Nah runecrafting is
---
Thats an insult to autism, he's autism 2

Maybe the fact that the weakest kalphites are capable of killing a camel allby itself, so Kalphite queen could be a great threat to Gienlor
---
I get that and all but we’re talking about an item now that’s been in since release date, of course it’s just a rumor but I find it hilarious, was never such random crazy talk a few years back
---
ur getting ur ass beat
---
the innocence is cute
---
Gz big man, enjoy him
---
No you just dont have 77 rc yet
---
Awesome thanks! 
---
I don't think anything bad is going to happen. This version of the game came about because they meddled too much. Although it could be a "All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again" type scenario.
---
Delet this
---
Because it is actually trash?
---
No, apparently they'll just send you an email telling you it's been removed. Pretty useless imo. That's why people were asking for authenticator delays
---
The words of someone who's most valuable possession in game is their dchain...
---
I didn't, the email the hijacker used and changed my recovery to is linked to 43 accounts that have been hacked.  They should do a quick email screen
---
Gz dad 
---
Where are you at? I want to specifically use this spot and this spot only when meleeing there from now on.
---
Not special, but the ones that grinded f2p will remember this moment as very special. Gz big man, good luck in the real game!
---
Hunting isn’t bad until you get to red chins and do western prov hard diaries I think, to get access to hunting grounds and do 3 tick chins

Weird flex but ok.

Thank god you blocked the report button hackers  might have got you bro

Congrats, just did it first time ever too this month. Playing since 06, now I have 5 cape.. funny how that works
---
Luck worth’s both ways eh? I’m sure other opportunities will come your way brother.
---
True but id love to fill the collection log, atm my graardors coll log looks like im about to open a shoe shop lmao

It just sits there so patiently and obediently!

Ranarrs die way too often to do those as a reliable consistent farming run herb unless you do disease free only

Or they just think they can sell it for more than it's worth
---
Yes, thats true, but this discussion isnt about you - its about people in general. How much you care about your account isnt relevant at all. If some idiot are uncareful with their mail-password or gets a cirus on their PC etc. they can still lose their RS-account even though they have not mentioned their RS-password anywhere. 
---
Thank you^.^

plot twist: we already do receive a message when that happens. but it never happens

BRING BACK QUICK CHAT!
---
The difference is scythe dropeate is static, its 1/200 independant of party size. (I don't think we know how deaths in theatre may affect this)
---
Tbow goes based on how many points are in a raid, in a 7 man I think its around 1/200-1/250
---
The thing is there are still only 255k tob completions so still only about 1,275 scythes in game
---
30m if he was also rocking the scimitar
---
Go to the GE and just look up the prices of all the herbs you can plant and compare them to the seed price. Try to find one with a good ratio and just farm the shit outta it man.
---
Also plant some watermelon and use them to make more super compost to help you get higher yield and lower disease rates. Eventually once you got some spare cash, invest in some volcanic ash or ultra compost to use on your herbs.
---
Dragon Warhammer is dropped from Lizardman Shamans. The drop is independent of the Diary, OP was just being funny by saying “do your diaries” because he completed the diary (by killing the shaman) and got the very lucky drop. 
---
As long as you dont go to -65 which is splashing zone, your mage accuracy wont matter
---
Not being able to equip a cape isn't that big of a trade-off for the ones you could just keep in your inventory. Along with that, this would indirectly affect normal players as you are removing potential resources from them. You currently have a smaller pool of high level characters fighting over resources and you would introduce more players to that pool, thus making it harder for regular players to get their share. 
---
The real answers are from this guy.
---
Well yeah downloading viruses is bad, this discussion stems from OP who had multiple people from 9 countries logging on the account with all the account information. This hack, like the grand majority, wasn't random. They werent targeted by a hacker, their friend got greedy
---
Literally nothing he mentioned was illegal. If you're talking about torrenting, it's often blocked by ISPs, but is not illegal in most places. You're probably conflating torrenting and piracy which are two entirely different, unrelated concepts, that just happen to work well together.
---
Not enough purple !
---
type !hw in our discord and follow the instructions
---
instead of having it restore hp/stats in one go maybe make it a heal overtime/regeneration just to add variety
---
You can I see that, fuck you!
---
Pvpers have been asking for a black dhide nerf for a while now. Splashing on welfare thats just as good as more expensive alternatives is super frustrating
---
You obviously have no idea what a VPN actually protects you from.
---
Lmao hope your shoe business goes well 😂
---
B/c karils doesnt need a buff, black dhide needs a nerf
---
Was very confused yesterday, saw a guy with rune platebody so he did DS but he was doing a blue dragon task with melee and a rune kite, was he a cute noob or is rune kite + antifire new meta.
---
Absolutely worth it. That item prints money..
---
Working on wrapping up my quest cape, I have DS2, MM2, Devious Minds, Contact!, Cold War, Grim Tales, A Taste of Hope, and Making Friends with My Arm left to complete. So I need to grind 72 mining (62 now), 72 WC (62 now), 60 Thieving (56), and a few more crafting/smithing/slayer levels. But...it's close!
---
How much gp/hr is Konar these days?
---
No? Theres a difference between -50 and +50 its just quite small
---
Sounds ridiculously strong. IF they do nerf black dhide, these should just adopt black dhide's stats. That's all.
---
I think it should have 75 ranged requirement and give stats similar to royal d'hide from Pre-EoC. The poison/venom immunity is nice but no to the ammo saving, idk how it would even do that.
---
&gt; Sounds like OP was hijacked by a known hijacker that is overly familiar with jagex security protocols which seems more like a problem for you guys than a suspicion on OP.
---
If you ask me the jmod is referring to "owner" here as OP, as he is clearly making a distinction between "owner" and "hijacker" in his summary. I could be wrong here but I don't know why he would refer to the hacker as the owner of the account. Also, why would the "hacker" do a recovery request if he has access to the account already anyway?
---
So if OP is the one submitting the recovery request with the email that's attached to 43 other accounts that kinda changes the story doesn't it?
---
Community that enjoys repetitive menial tasks finally finds something not to like
---
Grats my guy.
---
Slayer*
---
You unironically think losing many hours of progress due to no fault of your own is a healthy game mechanic? Lol
---
People sound the same.
---
Recipe for disaster is a good long term goal, and for best in slot ranged cape you’ll need to do Dragon slayer 2 someday. Focus on those as very long term goals and you’ll have plenty to do.
---
Yeah, that sounds about right too.
---
I was trying that cancer for a month in an acb and couldn't beat it. Then made irl friends with some nigga with an 11b bank who gave me his spare bow and Ely and I had it within 2 days. If you can beat it without BIS gear, you're a PvM god. Btw I tanked 5 Zuk hits and got the cape lmao RNJesus blessed me.
---
They don't actually have "0 magic defence", they just have very low magic defence. 
---
&gt; But is there ANY or is there NONE at all?
---
There is a difference, but it is small. 
---
&gt; Will I hit as often with -50 magic attack bonus as with +50 magic attack bonus to 0 magic def barrows brothers?
---
No, you will hit less often with -50 magic attack bonus compared to +50. But again, the difference isn't huge and -50 is still viable. 
---
All I've got is $11
---
Ranarrs die just as often as every other herb. Last time I checked the prices (last week) ranarrs were the best average gp per run assuming you used ultra compost. 
---
It's a very dangerous line of thinking to assume the law is the standard by which we should craft moral guidelines.
---
I shudder to think of the world we would have created, if we'd always thought that way.
---
Looting in wildy is better gp than mininglol
---
Ana + spectre = ti winners
---
There is a slight difference. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oh7HgIA.png) I compared -20 magic attack to 50 magic attack with lvl 75 magic and iban's blast on dharok. With -20 magic attack you have around 93% accuracy and with +50 you have around 97% accuracy. If you want to calculate your own stuff here's the link to the spreadsheet 
---
Woah language 
---
/u/Mod_Stevew
---
I think it really comes down to the numbers in dps change vs tank  
---
like faster you kill shit = less damage  
---
its always been like that on rs which is one of the reasons str is better that tank stats i mean which do you think is gunna take less hits  
---
the 30 second bandos solo or the 1:30  regarldess of tank gear
---
I didn't know walking/running was the worst thing ever. Also we have a myriad of transportation methods.
---
Nope, I really don’t see the issue with untradables especially during PVM content, someone brought up a great point about untradables items in PVP but since I’m not a Pker I’d be happy with things staying the same, adding a minor fix fee doesn’t really change anything, especially if you scale it to people’s retrospective levels, any high tier or maxed accounts will get a cheaper fix fee and lower level accounts will suffer because there con or magic level for example is low so they’d have to pay more. Seems unbalanced. 
---
A jail random event lol, tell her she has to unlock three different locks.
---
Only if you’re too lazy to run back OR you had a lot of degradable gear and it saves you money on the recharges. Even still the kind of gear you need to reach 4m in death cost means 4m was nothing to you anyways.
---
false
---
Abyssal whip is the same stats as an iron scimitar except gives +72 slash and +73 strength
---
no wonder you have depression
---
Implying nothing passing is a bad thing
---
Exactly. It is unfortunate that Jagex doesn't lift the mute of things you did 8 years ago. I was a child at the time and now I am mature. I've never been muted on a account since then.
---
Right now we are just using github issues and milestones.
---
If youre complaining about the blowpipe eating into profits too much you wont like Dragon bolts...
---
You could also just try to cast a spell you don’t have tunes for on someone in the direction you want to face. 
---
:o
---
Same set up you described, average kills come out to be 2 minutes - fasted was 54 seconds. 
---
Overall a decent method 
---
Mod Jed, this is your tape
---
I don't see why it should save ammunition at all tho.
---
This is how low lvl f2p Ironmen get 40 crafting. So no
---
The only people who want to get to mid/late game faster are people who are too lazy to get there.

Won't someone please think of the PKers??? How will they get their precious spades if they splash on people wearing black dhide.

Cool reply dickhead.

I'd take it even if it's just the cosmetic change and no stat difference. Looks dope.

the name Fukmy Vagina is available too

Please post id look for a pdf but im sure id get phished
---
Seems like this could devalue diary rewards like buckets of sand and getting flax etc as these are a huge part of the diaries especially for Iron men, while obviously the bucket of sand collection in these instances would be locked behind a higher level of warding it would need to not make doing the diaries completely useless IMO.
---
bruh u don't invest in cashflow producing assets with 100% your own money, you get loans.
---
brb splashing grandma
---
it means the peek times would be about 500-1000 players and everyone would move to private servers dodging copyright claims.
---
Go reread my comments or just use common sense dude.
---
Let me break it down Barney style for you since you’re too stupid to figure it out yourself.
---
Ranarr seeds are around 48586 actively traded right now, while the herbs are around 7783 each
---
Toadflax seeds are 914 each and the herbs are around 1600 each.
---
For your Ranarr to profit you, you gotta get more than 6 herbs a patch. Not undoable, and yes the profits are high if you get a lucky yield.
---
But IF that patch dies, you’re ending up recooping that cost from the rest of your patches. Toadflax seeds, even if all but one patch die, can pay for themselves as long as one patch survives. You just get more money for your investment.
---
Seriously dude you really don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Fuck
---
What about a skills necklace tele to mining guild that puts you in East falador? 
---
Probably because it will just be more work for their support team, which seems to have too much work already. Because instead of helping people who lost their account, they would get spammed with "pls help, i can't access my account because of the delay!".
---
i have 60b in my bank account willing to invest it all in shares
---
If someone is trying to trade outside of the GE they are most likely scamming.
---
And just move your poh to rimmington
---
Sauske: Nee-san yamero!
---
No, it just won’t auto renew
---
for real tho i dont get it
---
You will have it until the next payment date. So if you just want one month, you can cancel it now and still finish the month out.
---
Actually, it's more like they have to disclose to their home market or face trades violations since they themselves are subject to China's version of the SEC. They have to acknowledge that the idea is in the air to even start talks of actually negotiating any sales. 
---
Yes
---
Why is it a hot topic? Like it's been that way for decades.
---
I remember this setup and the struggle to get bolts
---
Grats!
---
good, thanks\^\^
---
Oops, wc
---
They literally have an in game statue
---
I figured this would be the case.
---
In my first week of membership I very nearly fell for this tactic but balked exclusively because I'd obtained some dragon axes at a fallador drop party and realised they were way over priced, he had "500k" worth, and it occured to me that the whole thing was likely a scam. The player had been offering an apparent "5m" of items for 2m, if it seems "Too good to be true" it is.
---
The other scam I see a lot, and is far more obvious (Though easy for a new player to fall for) is the trades like; "Show me more than 5m of items and I'll give you 2m", if you show the items, they put up 2m and hit accept. Hoping you'll be too excited and agree before realising your 5m+ of items are still on the table. Sadly, my sister fell for that one.
---
Mm I can see it being at least doubled with proper investing since then.
---
He’s only asking for help no need to be a douche. 
---
if they would sell it for everyone to be able to purchase shares it would be really easy for us to buy the company really
---
The thing about OSRS is that even if you spend the whole day on it, there are just going to be days where it doesn't seem like anything got done.
---
You think piracy is morally OK?
---
Imagine being this delusional. Gotta say this is the most pathetic thing I've seen on this sub in years and that's saying something. Grats on getting 30 combat levels overnight then, retard. 
---
Or in rare occasions, at their trade limit.
---
I made a 400k profit assisting somebody with a handful of trades they'd capped themselves on; runes and feathers mainly.
---
Nah. It's posted to the Chinese Stock Exchange because you have to post information of material interest to your stock price to the exchange that lists your company.
---
If Alphabet owned Jagex it would go to the NASDAQ stock exchange.

Defense potions instantly become the most expensive potion in osrs.

MatK? Lol. I bet the he can't code anything. No disrespect to the man, but he has nothing to do with game development. He is a manager of some sort.

This is a really great suggestion! Obviously, as most suggestions go, the actual numbers and specifics will need more work, but that's jamflex's job.

if you never heard of stud, you're probably some lvl 100 who camps bandos all day. Stud and oblivion been the top pvm clans since osrs release
---
All I wanted was some clarification that VPN was okay. 
---
&gt;You could be well travelled, or have a habit of using various VPN's on web access only - but I have to say it looks suspicious.
---
Nah man. It looks suspicious to him either way.  People do travel and do use VPN's. What specifically is suspicious. 
---
If you download a RAT you deserve to lose your items, cry more lil bitch.

&gt;"Stop being lazy."

Aren't video games specifically designed for lazy people? Active people get out of the house and do shit. Lazy people play video games. Just as a general rule of thumb.
---
The issue with agility is that it is massively useful, potentially to the point of being required to play the game painlessly, but it is stuck behind such mind-numbingly boring run-in-circle grinds that take hours and hours.
---
Honestly I think that is a great implementation (again). I think shorter timers would be good on an overall scale. Currently you could die, do something else, and still have time to pick your shit up. With 2 minutes you gotta rush your ass to where you died, but it makes dieing even in PVM have a bit of a riskier feel 
---
It's almost like not being overly greedy provides you with better outcomes.  Dunno though, maybe there are dumb companies that would try to alienate their fanbase.  Look at Diablo 3.
---
I can’t wait until EA buys Jagex
---
Or better yet, just require the diaries AND a warding level to be able to do some of these things. Instead of **"Bert gives you free buckets of sand everyday"**, it could be **"Bert allows you to use your strange sentient robes on his sand pit to collect sand."** Or it could just be both combining the free daily buckets and the access to the sandpit.
---
Same goes for the flax fields. It just seems more intuitive to gather these items with a skill rather than relying on dailies or shops to get a crafting level on an ironman. Thanks for the feedback!

i like the concept but the jam jar benefits basically copy the effect of barbarian potions.
---
This pretends that there aren't numerous cases of giant companies buying devs out and then shutting down games/whole studios. It isn't safe to assume that the new company's shareholders (assuming it isn't wholly bought by some chinese billionaire) actually care about the current product.
---
I'm at work, so I can just afk in my house if you do everything and tip some when you're done lol
---
Actually not a bad idea but do we need all these safety nets? I feel like if I die at all, I messed up and shold lose something, not be given every chance to gain it for free. Death's in any game should mean something bad. 
---
Reduces inventory space. Mining, runecrafting, killing Greater Demons, etc. All of it is a pain in the ass.
---
Black dhide had stronger melee defense bonuses, karils had stronger mage defense bonuses.  I don't see the problem here.  
---
Yes once again, what about material inflation?
---
 If you don't like the task skip/block it but your reason is it's not afk I'm gonna vote to make it afk to play on two accounts... That is quite literally a direct omission the task is fine the gp/hr is fine clicking 1-3 times a minute is fine.  You just have a problem with it because WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I can't play on two accounts cause content is engaging. 
---
Hello Darkness my old friend.
---
In 2008 what was when d claws came out so I'm going to guess money demons?
---
oh
---
so this wasn't a high level account?
---
Same. I've been wondering why now, after 15+ years, black dhide is all of a sudden OP and magic in the wildy is horrendously underpowered and needs a buff.
---
Seriously?
---
Just go to world 330 man. Tons of people hosting gilded altars.
---
How long will it take? I can hop on for a bit 
---
Because black dhide is worth 40k and craftable and karils is from high level pvm and is 3m? Why should they be comparable at all? One is very much easier to get than the other.
---
And unnecessary, honestly. It doesnt even make sense why they would do it in the first place. Those areas were used by mid/low level players. This update was the soul reason those areas are completely dead content now. 
---
What is blast mining?
---
how about when someone at jagex leaked the info how do i protect against that 
---
Imagine not being maxed in the current year
---
Took me a while but I get it, I do this too sometimes lol
---
I bet yours is proud to have a child that unironically uses xD, you’re the one that got personal first and can’t take it back, not even a good keyboard warrior how embarrassing
---
Lots of people have been suggesting this since the reddit events started. Makes me happy to see people want to do fight pits 
---
I doubt him saying “hey don’t be racist” makes him feel like an individual. It’s pretty bog standard.
---
Would really really suck to not be able to buy supplies once you hit buy limit.
---
I think the best thing to do is have a more in depth tutorial island. Which gives you supplies and such, but you have to hit a certain level on tutorial island before you can leave.
---
Would have to make tut island bigger with better resources. But make it so early game its by far the best training spot for new players and during that time they can catch bots easier 
---
How does anyone *deserve* to be hacked lol

What went wrong in your life that led you to make this dumb ass comment 
---
this was literally the perfect response you couldn't have said it any better and your suggestions are great.. i will try to give her little mini goals at first thank you!
---
But what I'm saying is maybe do a 1500 filter for certain endgame Skilling activities poll, then a raids tag filter for raids, like run a poll only for players who have over 50 kc on theater of blood for changes in that content. It shouldn't be a bunch of requirements players have to tick off before voting in any poll, just whatever is relevant to the poll

Gratz on reaching the maximum possible level for this type of restricted account!

popular pvp streamer and youtuber amenity posts a video detailing the issue.

likely jagex were prodded enough by a vocal minority to change core game mechanics that have been in place since 2003
---
But we play 2007scape, are you trying to devalue my 2007moneymakingonlyultimsteironman?
---
Out of curiosity, what supplies are you going to use an entire buy limit of in 4 hours? Surely you aren't going to eat 2k sharks an hour, unless there's something I'm missing.
---
? 
---
You realize the pet drop rate is 1/65 right
---
Yeah this is a real concern for people who travel frequently.
---
I log in from a different IP almost everytime I play it would be nice to know if that's considered suspicious behavior.
---
This sub overreacts sometimes it's a simple question. 
---
You mean royal d'hide?
---
Same tho
---
Use amethyst broad bolts
---
Should really give some muggers crossbows
---
As long as it's not bought out by Americans or another Chinese company this can only be a good thing.
---
Not that crazy tbh. 1/65 chance is so common relative to most drops that getting it on 19 kc is probably more likely than getting a rare item in GWD at like 50 kills.
---
/r/woooosh

Or they see a better opportunity for returns by using an instant lump sum to invest elsewhere. Runescape is doing well for them, but they might see something better.

seen this posted here a couple months ago, i still dont get it :/
---
2 defense 
---
If you’re a high level main you can just crash a group of noobs, the real issue with it being so full is as an iron
---
Well, the post does say same stats as Black D'hide. But yah, there isn't a ton of room above Black D'hide and between Karil's or Armadyl to try to fit a new D'hide. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the venom immunity and ammo saving effect suggested; it feels a bit weird on D'hide.
---
Though one option it could go with is lower accuracy than Black D'hide, maybe like Blue D'hide, but it gains a bit of Ranged Strength... We do already have Ranged Strength armor in Void but Ranged Strength not tied to a set effect could be too good with the Slayer Helm where the 15% can make up for the lower accuracy. Still, Hydra Leather would be fairly high cost and it would make a pretty high-level armor; I suppose it would actually be Level 80 Armor since the Gloves are Level 80... It might replace Armadyl on some tasks, but both could still have a place if the stats are balanced right.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I forgot this was your account. There's a longranged option while Ranging, maybe you should use it and see what XP is dropped. :)
---
This isn't what happened at all, did you even read the post.

Yikes

You can view poll results currently, which means people who don't know what to vote for, check the results and just vote for whatever's currently passing instead of using their initiative.

It's not, the guy didn't even read the post.

Lol and you aren't?

maybe make it 70 def req
---
Gone in 60 seconds
---
Lol

Let's poll "Should poll results be hidden?"
---
7k cannonballs can EASILY be used in 4 hours. (unf) darts and bolts. those instantly come to mind for me
---
wouldn't call it thousands of hours! 
---
and what about the shield left half and skotos in 1 drop?
---
Meh I'm not a fan of crashing and don't like being crashed on my other accounts so that isn't something I would do unless provoked. 
---
Oh i get what u mean. Yea totally. I agree. Specific filter to that activity. But sometimes thats tough. Bec i mean lets say you are very experienced but you have never raided. And they are making huge changes to raids, lets say that they are introducing a new broken tbow for rewards. Then i feel like a lot of people are going to be agaisnt that but locked out of voting.
---
yeah that would have a massive impact on the economy if all the mid/high pvmers started using half the ammo the used to.
---
Fuck no. If they make a dumb ass boss like this instead of an ice giant boss I'm quitting
---
Big streamers don't get hacked because:
---
1. It raises too much attention
---
2. It's harder to do as jagex will care and fix the issue instantly.
---
3. big streamers likely can't be recovered through the system and they can just contact jagex directly if they have account issues. (Zezima had this too)
---
Moltress... no way

That’s definitely a problem, thanks for the info!
---
Magnets aren't real, look it up. 
---
Good one. Imagine Jagex having case-sensitive codes with special characters.
---
I only ever use karils when I'm melee'ing a boss with high mage...
---
Exactly how I feel. On the other hand, if the entity that picks up the shares has any interest in osrs beyond just a potential cashflow, then we could be in for some great things.
---
Overall, i'd say i'm about 7/10 on the ಠ\_ಠ scale.
---
Just quest and train up your skills. Don’t worry about grinding for cash until much later in the game.
---
yeah lets nerf this thing thats op and replace it with something even more op that doesnt have any greater barrier of entry than the original thing we wanted to nerf.
---
How much money is that

Selling Jagex with OSRS as a successful product &gt; selling Jagex after attempting to introduce MTX to OSRS.  
---
They might make a quick buck by introducing MTX to OSRS but then they are stuck with a company that is worth far less since a good chunk of the playerbase is gone.  
---
Them wanting to sell of their stake in Jagex is a bad sign for the company. It means Jagex is worth less, is not striving as they hoped it to be. This also means they will reduce the employee count or cut wages.  
---
When Jagex is controlled by yet another company it can be good or bad but usually it is bad. At least it isn't as bad as the company being totally liquefied meaning Jagex's assets will be sold employees will be let go and they will be dissolved. And the chance of this happening is real. Plenty of gaming companies have shut down. Be it privately owned companies or publicly traded companies.
---
Which kind of company would be interested in purchasing Jagex? Some companies acquire game studios in order to gain key employees. Key employees that have significant experience with cutting edge engines. But if you look at Jagex employees they are stuck with an outdated engine that was customly made and is outdated for the current era. Some of those employees were also tasked to do social media presence which would be unthinkable in other gaming studios. There their CTO might have a social media presence when they are giving a talk but not to entertain a gaming audience.    
---
So what other reason is there to acquire Jagex? To improve the RuneScape IP? If they wanted they could make their own MMORPG in a cutting edge engine.     
---
To milk RuneScape since it is a game with an established player base? Yes.....  
---
Jagex is a British based company where game studios don't flourish. If Jagex was based in America they would have a far better chance to be acquired by an American based company. And the reason why EU game studios aren't as successful as their American game studios counterparts is because they can't operate as efficiently. America is all about /r/LateStageCapitalism. While that subreddit complain a lot about it since it is anti-consumer it is incredibly pro-company. EU (and soon non-EU GB) have consumer protection and high taxes to pay. A big deterrent for buying out companies that are only barely successful. This is the main reason why in the EU you don't have these mega corporations that own huge market shares. Because the moment that happens they will be forced to split and work independently because there are laws against companies having a monopoly (I heavily recommend everyone to read into this). It's good for us consumers but it's also the reason why America and China have more big companies than the EU. Point being: A EU company won't buy Jagex since it is not worth it due to the bureaucracy, taxes and what not. An American company is only interested in EU companies when they are successful. This leads to....
---
... the next company being another Chinese company. And it is a known cycle that companies that are acquired by Chinese companies are MTX'ed to death. They aren't interested in having an ever-lasting game. If Jagex was privately owned and was run by passion people this desire would manifest. But sadly Jagex has investors to listen to. I'm sure Jagex employees have this desire but they aren't in the position of power to make it reality.
---
If they sell the company it will be probably yet another Chinese investor who would want to milk to product.  
---
If they fail to sell there is a high chance that they will milk to product and in the final stage shut the company down since their invested capital prints more money somewhere else.  
---
**How to prevent introducing MTX into OSRS?**
---
(This has happened before in another tech company. For privacy sake I don't want to reveal the name. Also this does happen from time to time and usually it doesn't reach the public since they don't want to destroy the company's image since they are a part of their success.)   
---
OSRS employees signing together an open letter that if the day comes OSRS receives a MTX model (or the OSRS team being tasked to implement MTX) that would cause a significant amount of players to quit they will leave the company as well. This is them putting their own job on the line (and frankly speaking there are better tech companies to work under).   
---
This is also a huge deterrent for introducing MTX. Because if they tried they wouldn't have anyone to implement it. They will have to allocate RS3 developers who are no familiar with OSRS since the engine have changes drastically) to implement MTX. Furthermore they are losing OSRS employees who have experience in creating OSRS content.  
---
The moment they start implementing MTX into OSRS it's a sign that they are planning to shutdown Jagex in the next 1-3 years. It won't have the player base to justify the invested capital.  
---
If there is a threat of the core OSRS team leaving the company immediately it would accelerate the death. Then they have to think thrice about forcing MTX down our throats. They will have to think about a more long-term strategy.
---
This could also backfire that they'll put an immediate end to Jagex and RuneScape but at least this way we aren't being repeatedly disappointed and hung on the good, old past. And I think it is in the OSRS community interest that MTX is never introduced to OSRS. If MTX is introduced the majority of the community wouldn't mind OSRS dying since they wouldn't be playing it either way. Better let it die quickly than watch it slowly die a miserable death where you have quitted but come back only to quit again.
---
The Gower brothers had integrity. And they made RuneScape a success. Now the employees are mindless sheeps in a failing company without any integrity. In RS3 they've been demoted to PR people who are in constant damage control making promises about MTX only to be disappointed months later. It isn't surprising how far RS3 has shrunken and if you compare the actual games (without all the MTX and maybe EoC) RS3 is a good product. And what's left of the playerbase are people who have nowadays accepted Jagex is not perfect. They are people who are willing to spend money on the game.  
---
Jagex isn't anymore the company where employees had actual control. The board of directors is full of Chinese people who don't even live in Cambridge.  
---
Seriously. Create a union, write an open letter. Show some integrity. Show the OSRS community that you love RuneScape. Jagex employees merely stating MTX won't come to OSRS holds no weight. Put your job on the line.
---
And I dear hope that former Jagex employees haven't signed a non-disparagement agreement (can't talk bad about your former employer) so they too can weigh in and talk about the company (which is abysmal if you look on Glassdoor, mainly due to upper management not listening to feedback). The only reason they aren't listening to you guys is because you aren't part of the board of directors and you have no leverage. With this you would have leverage and finally be able to actually prevent the Chinese overlords from running the company into the ground. HR hate unions. But when God Ash is leading the union with the whole OSRS team what can they do? Fire the team and watch OSRS crumble?

I rambled a bit off. Kudos to anyone who read this mess. Maybe someone else can structure this mess and get the point across better.

Wow this is a new take on pointlessly blaming rs3 players. Usually “they are the ones voting in all the op shit, surely not our community who has voted yes for everything for years”

So you're interested in nhing right? Maxed main deep pking will be your best bet if you're looking to get good for a deadman season. You could make a pure too but mechanically it's a lot different than what you'd experience in deadman, besides using normals.

They can’t.

Just look at the JMod comments on the RS3 sub when Jagex originally got bought out by Chinese investors. They promised there wouldn’t be any change or increase in MTX and then went on to have more MTX than ever before. 
---
Nothing any JMod says can be guaranteed. They’re entirely at the whim of whoever ends up buying them.

Hmm idk about that, sounds like a bit of a .... Reach.
---
But you said .01% of player base has that so you’re catering to them by having a gold sink that really only affects them as most players do not put in the time to become that wealthy. You’re trying to balance the game for the “pros”. They do this in other games and it really messes with the General player base.  But that’s just my opinion. Could be right could be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️

I've farmed Snapdragon, Ranarrs, and Toadflax over the past few weeks. With Toadflax on 7 patches you make a guaranteed 90-100k profit after a cost of ~10k on the seeds. While Ranarrs / Snaps have the potential to give you way more if you're lucky, over time the guaranteed 100k off Toadflax is better. That's not to mention that ranarr seeds have gone from 42k -&gt; 53k since the Farming Guild so now you need 7.5 herbs to break even. I'm not going anywhere near Ranarrs or snaps until the seed prices calm down. Tl;dr: Ranarrs/snaps have low floor but high ceiling, Toadflax/avantoe have high floor but low ceiling.

Content doesn't have to be rewarding to be engaging, by the way the content is rewarding it just isn't shitting out 1m gp/hr so you sit here crying. Your argument boils down to reeeeeeee drakes don't shit out 3m/hr, reeeeeee drakes don't shit out 100k xp/hr, and reeeeeee I have to click to kill a monster. 
---
The task isn't hard doesn't take that long and you quite literally directly admit you want the content more afk so you can play on another account.

Like I said before you have sat her personally attacking me because you have no argument.  You just want content to be easier and afk for the sake of it being easier and more afk **(SO YOU CAN PLAY ON TWO ACCOUNTS AT ONCE)**  Like I said before enjoy being a fucking walmart greeter you whole life, you obviously don't have critical thinking skills, you've ignored everything I had to say and only respond with wow drakes aren't overly rewarding and not afk so it's dead content.

Started farming in December and currently 85 farming. I've done fruit trees (not doing anything better than papaya), hardwood on Fossil Island every 3.5 days, and Calquat (from 62 farming) trees. When I have a bit of extra time I've started doing Snape Grass alongside my herb runs, and I do Toadflax for the herb run. Every now and then when I build up money from herb runs (100k per run roughly) I do a run of magic trees (or now dragonfruit) to do a get a big boost in xp. Farming isn't something you grind (barring tithe farm) so just get in the habit of your tree runs and it'll go up gradually over time.

50 ranged for safespotting blue dragons is fine, for green dragons 40-60 on all melee combat stats is enough

Yes, and I found I was more accurate at hitting jad instead of going rapidly. This allows you to kite healers to prevent them from hitting you all simultaneously.

In terms of wealth yes i could never replace my account valuables easily like other things mobile phone, comp or anything else that you would have insurance on. I spend money on the game so I do expect to be upset if everything I worked for vanishes.

I didn’t think about the slow pour of a jam into our mouths haha.

I don't think its fair to consider a method that requires trading other players, as if other players are unwilling the method becomes impossible.  Not only that, but that method is many times more expensive than any other skill.  Than all other 99s combined.

I'd agree with that. I have 61 cooking, and got there by making blurberry specials, which was my main source of income until I hit like 60cb. Now if I'm going to lvl cooking seriously I think I'll just buy a million trout and see how far it gets me. Lol

yes officer this is the one

Any alternative form of run regen will devalue staminas to some extent. However, I believe a spell that requires runes that are inconvenient to carry will devalue staminas far less than rs3 rest, which is the same thing with no cost.
---
The reason I suggested such a low magic requirement is because on the livestream they mentioned not liking that new players' first experience with the game is always being out of run energy and having to walk everywhere. If they introduced rest I'd guess they'd want brand new players to be able to use it.
---
Ok I see your point. I think it probably would only slightly increase security though. The reason being ( and I'm sorry if this describes andyone reading this) that people who get phished do so because they are idiots. All phishing emails show clear indications of being a phishing email. But I do have to agree with most people, jagex just sucks at this kind of thing and resists progress.

I would prioritize the top floor over anything.. even over prospector.. the increase from prospective is good but the top floor makes mining much easier and quicker, then you can get prospector. Prospector only ends up giving like 300ishK extra on the way to 99. 
---
OSRS could make do with some MTX. Would generate more revenue and maybe then they can afford a customer support team

I'd be totally down for some cool cosmetic MTX and free XP

Okay there princess, let's not blow things out of the water, this game is more than playable even with 1 agility. You can use stamina and energy pots in this game and not ever need agility.

And jesus fuck, 60ish agility does not take that long to get. You do know you are playing OSRS right? This game is grindy and there is a BENEFIT to raising a certain skill
---
Didn't see that till after! I mean I guess you could blame mother nature or the internet provider, but nonetheless the fault for one's own (virtual) death is their own. I won't lie my ISP hasn't been the greatest, but the problems I have either are quick and are ready in less than 15 minutes, or take a while, long past 60 minutes. ISP isn't to blame, it's just a provider, which you accept when you literally pay them.

Don’t let the JAGEX mods find out.

oo i see. i did not know that.

It's really not that funny..

You have a huge problem with any sort of change, don’t you?

Wouldn't voting no make CoX even worse since Jagex removing scouting as an integrity update? Or would a completely RNG dungeon be better than warding scrolls?

Lol sorry, only reason I said that is cuz I feel like some people gotta just chill on the efficiency part of the game just a little bit. I play efficient as much as I can across my accounts but I'm not out to set records or anything. It burns me out so sometimes I even have to be that smart ass to myself to remind myself to just chill and play the game like it's a game. The achievements will come.

I find 100% damaged reduction from protection prayers to be even worse balancing mess than if they gave 50% damage reduction like in RS3 but also give soul split.

Ancient curses were also a good bone sink and made pvming both supply and demand their own resources so skilling was not devalued.

That's the system that every scientifically literate system uses.

Would bias the results since that information would spread to other people even if it locked them out of voting themselves
---
Mobile? Maybe? idk.

Two range potions, 6 sara's, and the rest restores. I'd bring more saras if I had to do it again, i got down to 1 dose on Jad but still had a few restores to spare. Bring about 3k-4k bolts to be safe. It took me about 114 minutes to complete it playing pretty cautiously.
---
Make sure to look at where the orange 360 spawns in the last wave, that's where Jad spawns.

Good luck!

I beg to differ, GWD gear is very good, if the price were to dip, the demand would go up, it wouldn't crash as much as you think it would.
---
&gt; most boss monsters in Raids 2. 
---
Lol 
---
People always say this but I don't understand what qualifies as mid level in that case. I went from barrows to zulrah, and isn't zulrah considered high level pvm excluding straight up raids? Did I just skip a whole mid level experience?
---
My information got leaked from what?.. they breached Jagex?!?!
---
Except imbued heart is actually good, magic potion is garbage 
---
Unreal
---
What legend can chug half a jar of jam in one my man
---
Dawg, the dude in that vid wasn’t farming the emblems you’re thinking of. Those came from Revs and are rare drops. The ones that people bot/farm come from bounty hunter and are black with a splash of red. They also are worth a lot less. 
---
So basically your whole post is completely invalid. 
---
U no ur gangsta when u stop seein red player lvls
---
Yes! To be honest I died like 4 times against Robert. Galvek died at the first attempt.
---
yeah that makes no sense
---
Really hope this works out for the fellow, but I don't see it happening. Thanks for the response
---
Hate it so much, really is low life shit
---
There doesn't need to be. However, if there is no data for either, then there is no reason that Jagex need to change the polling system as an integrity change, just because your feels.
---
I think mainly to stop the herd mentality. So that people who don’t really know much about the polls don’t just look at what’s winning and what’s losing and voting towards that side. Makes people actually think about what the polls are about and if THEY want it   
---
Yea it’s completely broken imo. As much as I’d like to bring a shitton if whiteberry jams to literally every combat situation, we shouldn’t add prayer restore food
---
Sounds like a barrage show to me
---
He said using half, not losing half 
---
Uhm okay thats messed up.
---
Do you need a hug? Or maybe a xanax?
---
Demand of gear increases price, because more people want the gear. If the gear becomes cheaper, more people will want it because it is more affordable. Can your 50 IQ brain understand that?
---
Cloud Badass just completed 2 TOB kc on lvl 75 hcim on stream

Mhh.. not sure. Contact J mods on twitter, but it should work with the ingame name change...

---
I'm not saying I hate the idea of this, just needs tweaking.
---
You have to change it on the website 
---
How are you obligated to do it? Outside of reqs for quests or shortcuts you want you can get by with super energies and staminas easily. Shortcuts ARE incentives too. I was hyped as fuck when I finally got fremmy hard and 73 agil for troll stronghold shortcut. 
---
that shouldnt matter if he has 2FA
---
The skill censoring had me rolling
---
Just did an elite had to go to fountain of rune in 47 wildy and got a rune plate body and bandos page fade me fam
---
Nothing, it's just a big achievement
---
Lmao and you have 172m agility xp and live on welfare. I feel bad for you.
---
Someone should had saved it by any chance 
---
I like the idea of it I just think it’s broken. It’d fuck up the economy too. Needs tweaking for sure, then I’d support it 
---
Yeah, I hope he still has the episodes and reuploades them on his own channel at some point. This is a piece of history gone...
---
cmonBruh
---
He means crowd source the money and purchase it privately, would be no point of crowdsourcing if it was public...
---
Lol’d at MAX SECURITY ACCOUNT HACKED HERES HOW THEY DID IT
---
Imagine him showing a video about how he clicked a phishing link on his gold buying website of choice and put in his log in information. Funny how all these people getting “hacked” always do nothing wrong! 
---
Record on phon put on YouTube link  video 
---
If you tried changing it within the game that might be the issue, you're technically able to change your name to the same thing changing the case of letters (i.e. cars to CaRs) but it can only be done through the account management portion of the runescape website. 
---
Try changing your name on the website and see if that works.
---
Or he could sell it and make 3 000 GOLDEN COINS. That's like 60 salaries of the sand worker man

thats a mining hack my boi *doot* *doot*
---
sounds like real life
---
none of us know that , but thanks for the ez tbow
---
I'd bring full inventory of Jam and I can heal or restore prayer it hits both situations!
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Probably because it gets super laggy if there's too many people in the room. 
---
Yes and no, because your switches are going to be based on your opponents skill somewhat, you'll start to assume people will have the same noob habits in real pvp
---
Thank you, that makes sense.
---
because if they can use the recovery system can be used an infinite amount of times if it's accomplished once. Also when they actually log into your account they get your creation date, old billing information, and play time which just helps them abuse the recovery system even more.
---
This is unrealistic. 
---
Lmao ok whatever, you win buddy.
---
make it 60 defence
---
I love prayer bonus stacking, give this method a shot! Get the highest prayer bonus you can while using any Godsword, about 16 prayer potions and AFK farm Aberrant Specters. I make quite a good amount of money every day at work while doing this. :)
---
In no situation is Magic meta, lol.
---
This worked! Will edit the post now to reflect changes.
---
spankbang &gt; all
---
no debates
---
Jagex should quickly make a copy of osrs to save so we can be saved if it all goes to shit 
---
Based 
---
The point is to not pack OP buffs into a replacement for black d’hide and crash multiple items for the sake of one suggested item. 
---
Unless you want to make insane money killing the Alchemical Hydra.
---
risky as hell tho, the unfortunate part was the guy really did everything right. Max def equipment, it was 5am on a low populated server. I would've just quit that acct and made an iron man after that. Fuck the public, soloscape.
---
Well, most of your money. 
---
Only it does matter cause when they remove auth everything is disabled
---
i'd rather we do not speak of him/her since he is a very dangerous person ready to manipulate and funnel all possible information which to use in doxing and threatening. he has been a very toxic influence on certain finnish forums for the past year and has shown time after time that they aren't afraid to tell already suicidal people to kill themselves
---
i don't want any unsuspecting innocent person to get lured into his full manipulation capability
---
He's freaking the fuck out lmao
---
You do realise that people with old accounts have compromised information because of a bunch of breaches in other websites. 
---
3Head
---
Ruined the account the moment he made it and it hit 10hp.
---
Oh cool haha. :p
---
I remember that account name from back in the day, around 30-04 was a high level account.
---
I’m an Ironman and I’d crash you for that comment

Genuinely funny as shit

shut up you n1gger stick a fat fucking n1gger stick up your ass

Oh God I remember how cheese that was! Sit afk in a pvp world with 76k for hours for ur dp to go up and then have a bud die to u with 76k. Fun times actually!

do intros/series like these exist or is it just a strawman?

Yea I just got 82 runecrafting and was like wtf is this. 
---
kill yourself with a teasing stick, wrap it around ur neck
---
Wait I thought they already had Imbued Heart because they said they have BiS other than the ones I listed?
---
You upgrade Ranged gear first because of how the Magic Damage actually scales, you need +2 pieces of Ancestral for 1 max hit. Assuming you have the Hat first, that's like 140m you have to spend for a noticeable damage increase but Arma is 70m for about the same or higher DPS increase, I forgot the exact numbers (although for a shorter duration because you don't fight Mage phase as much as Red + Green)
---
Eh. Know is a slower, cheeper, alternative to blowpipe 
---
*shocked gasp*

How adorable

Did he give an update about what he does atm?

id take ubi off that list, they have really turned themselves around the last 3-5 years

&gt; Impossible to pk at earth warriors now too because of how many pkers

Sounds like it's doing just fine then...? Pk with actual pkers!

What’s the story with Machinima? They’ve been around forever.

I think the opposite. You would join in too.
---
Needs way more than 1 hide per piece with those special effects.
---
Thanks for the genuine reply. I've been trying to make that point, the lower price wouldn't be bad at all. I don't believe your average player can even afford full Bandos gear, even after it were to theoretically "crash". So would it really be a bad thing? 
---
If it's unsustainable then why not add private instances for ironmen only? I don't believe that hurts anyone at all.
---
Just upvote and leave then
---
that makes sense, thanks! 
---
also I assumed they didnt have it since some people might not consider it "gear" but they might have it
---
H'hide
---
So u can farm ur lvl 3 alt all day to get the pet, naw

Indeed !

I'm going to pk how and where I please in the WILDERNESS and if I'm looking for free loot off you brainlets I'm going to get it.

Sadly yes

Uhhhh yea that was totally me

But the bolts are easy to get.
---
Thing I've always wondered from this is how come people never get promoted/demoted from this? I don't think I've ever seen someone just log in one day up or down a rank as a result of this. Also would this make it possible to get carried by a cheater for 10 ranks then lose one game and get demoted 10, ranks? 
---
Leave it how it is. They’re going to change it fuck it up more than ever and everyone’s just going to continue to bitch. 
---
How long ago was that? I feel like I saw it and posted fight pits as well, but I can't remember if that was on a previous even suggestion thread. Not like it matters lol.
---
😔
---
I always wonder why quest rewards give an arbitrary amount of xp in the reward, like 18,650.  Why that number instead of say 19k or 20k?
---
theyll discuss highly upvoted suggestions on the Q and A pretty regularly yeah. if it gets good support there it might wind up on a poll.
---
Don't forget tourist trap bar bending scene
---

---
Needs some balancing but farming is my favorite skill and this would make it better!
---
If you want to be old school do it fill black dhide and crystal bow.
---
I mean, you shouldn't really be putting that kind of stuff on multiple websites. That's part of good personal security.
---
My god is this satire or do people actually go to shows like that
---
How many polls did you kill to make that?
---
Sorry not clicking your shotty link mate. Definitely not entering personal information there either, that sounds like a great way to get my information compromised! Lol 
---
Many spam bots have varying messages and random numbers at the end.

Why would they? Isn't the best part about agility seeing all the other people suffering with you?

&gt; I'm going to pk how and where I please in the WILDERNESS
---
Except for earth warriors apparently xD
---
Suggestion 
---
This is one of the best suggestions for this game I've ever seen. Making jam feels so... medieval.
---
If you get them sure :) I think it's the same droprate as the rest of the set 1/150
---
Yes, pretty sure the hydra themed slayer helmet being polled right now was a reddit suggestion a couple of weeks ago along with the poh mounted hydra head
---
And I don't think it was specifically from reddit but every rooftop agility course was a suggestion from a player called bigredjapan
---
Such an asshole when the only option to actually get a world is to crash people
---
It’s okay maybe next time you post can google the definition of difficult words like “majority”. And I accept your apology 
---
Thanks for your comment! What is the recommended method of getting in touch with anyone from the office regarding accounts when you have issues with the account recovery form?
---
NOO
---
If it’s the only way to get a world there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it
---
Any benefit to soloing it?
---
Jagex has specifically stated this addition would be pointless and offers no better level of security than what is already offered; it's only an inconvenience for the overwhelming majority of people who are removing auth for legitimate reasons. 
---
As they've already commented before, if someone is hijacking your email account (bypassing the authenticator you SHOULD already have on that) or gaining access to your account via recovery which will offer you NO notification, and all levels of protection are removed by account recovery upon successful recover. To this point, tell me again what good authenticator delay does other than prove to be a nuisance? It doesn't seem like you've ever actually recovered an account, and neither does anyone else that thinks having an auth delay is a meaningful addition.
---
Oh I will there too. It's just a more known spot now and other pkers often push the loot away as compared to them actually getting it because they don't know what they are doing. 
---
I bet he's just salty you have a cool 1 letter name with which to impress the ladies while he's stuck with something like "bigdoom65473" or other.
---
That's where you are wrong. 
---
Same as any other acc, and purple sweets if you're bad
---
Whenever user interface changes have come up they usually say engine work, and im sure it will require engine work to hide it for specific people.
---
ya report it as a bug
---
Can I get a slayer task for these?
---
Balancing aside, I absolutely love this idea, and I usually hate most suggestions to add things to this game.
---
One thing, and I dunno if this is even a notable mention, but this would make it a lot easier for UIMs to get noted food. Most UIMs already do white berry runs for defense potions so they have a large noted stack of berries, allow those berries to be food and now they can ignore minnows.
---
Except I’m not wrong kid
---
Email, twitter, and here are really the only ways. 
---
You go to fight caves and do it, succeeding is another thing though :^^)
---
They said it's bc of the way the blowpipe would handle transmogs since you can load it with different darts. IDK the exact technical reason but their summary was that it generates too many models.
---
Expected a rick roll, im not disappointed 
---
Alright asshole. 
---
The drop op got was from a superior monster, didn't have to be a kurask specifically
---
yeah none
---
Yh, maybe next time you can literally go hang yourself. Have a nice day.
---
Cry more
---
It's not true the hijackers generally have too much information that jagex is forced to use it otherwise it would lock the real user out.
---
This is bait.
---
By watching a guide on how to do it...?
---
I like Hydehide. "I had to hide my Hydehide from my wifewife."
---
They use to use serp helm before nerf
---
Seriously? They've probably implemented hundreds of suggestions that started out here. 
---
I keep 3 cabbages to remind me my bank should be 750m higher.
---
You can get white berries pretty quick at Lletya if you're determined, or you can just do bush runs and get like 50 each run.
---
Poisoning and recoils but with it prayer you’ll need someone smarter than me on the subject lol

you should watch willmissit's account security video

Have you tried the runelite gpu plugin? It almost totally fixed lag in crowded areas for me. If you don't like all the other crap you can just turn off all the plugins except the gpu one.

but we do know that, because he told us, before he said it even.  autist.

Sad that this makes you so upset you come and cry to Reddit about it lol

Feelsbad, extra sucks as graardors basically my main moneymaker as i dont have patience for vork without dhcb and zulrah just requires insane amount of effort and without uniques graardors like 150k a hour or something horrible like that

I was about to make a meme that said every time you Thbbbbt the stray dog the push hiding the poll results back 1 day...

You really need to get a life god all sjws should be shot and thats the end of it
---
Awesome write-up! Really appreciate it, thank you!
---
No questions right now, but if something comes up I'll reply again :D
---
chief called, he said this is it 
---
I'm a zerk (mostly because i enjoy being a low combat level) xD and i enjoy it. Can easily do bosses but the trips are small. &amp; it's pretty nice to have slayer cape at 99 combat =)
---
I honestly can't believe how long these memes of not hiding the polls have been going on, like does Jagex think we are all just joking about this? How have they not address this issue whatsoever lol
---
Strength potion would be also good for the extra boost
---
1/8
---
Weird how every time someone asks to report rule breakers, people like you come and defend them. Fuck off, we want to keep the game clean and there is nothing wrong with reporting them. 
---
And you're only being downvoted because you are an asshole?
---
r/assholedesign
---
Strength potion, antifire shield and lobsters should be fine. Max hit from melee is 8, max from the fire is 13. Also being either a rune longsword or scimmy instead of short 
---
Support, this is every hcim's dream
---
they shouldnt if anything games and other platforms should be more separated or else you get dumbasses like OP
---
He’s saying hide the votes until the poll is done entirely ya ding dong
---
Antifire potions p2p sadly but with 40-50 melees it should be fairly easy
---
Except I’m not, I’m just not shit at the game and people can’t take the truth when they hear they are
---
&gt; I don't think its fair to consider a method that requires trading other players
---
That's what a buyable skill is...
---
There's a reason why it's considered EHP now. If you're macro-efficient, it's the fastest method to get 200m all. And if you really hate RC pre-77, then it's a really effective method if you're willing to pay a bit to skip that stage.
---
That said, even if you don't consider that method, the fastest method is not a level 28 method. It requires 75 RC for the giant pouch and the fastest rates.
---
I haven't said anything about politics, this is about someone going out of their way to harass someone and do extensive harm to them and then threatening groups of people, but because they have already been proven to be this unstable, it's really questionable what they can or cannot do and I don't want unsuspecting people to get lured in and manipulated and hurt by them. 
---
Oh fuck off. Don't try to get all nit-picky and argue a single word. Want/need--you know what I'm saying. And actually no, if someone is scamming/cheating (also two different words that you are using interchangeably), usually the person getting fucked over is not the guy who just scammed a bunch of gold; it's the guy who got scammed, which 9 out of 10 times is usually the fault of the victim falling for the scam. I still believe the only people who want a feature like this are salty, vindictive scum bags.
---
Did u buy it?
---
its none of your business is what im saying
---
For sure. The system has flaws, like all games security do. It’s a game. People have flaws too. You can personally guarantee me that they didn’t click anything or put account info somewhere silly for all reddit posts? Interesting. Agree to disagree. 
---
Imagine thinking this has something to do with being shit at the game because I choose not crash. I mean you are actually a fucking idiot. 
---
Can you do Enlightened Journey? Dueling ring to Castle Wars; Balloon to Crafting Guild is my go-to for Rimmington.
---
I’m not saying you’re shit at the game. I’m saying the people upvoting you are, because they are which is why shit like getting a fire cape gets upvoted.
---
On? Lol 
---
I want my role playing worlds, so I can marry someone and talk in dinosaur 
---
yes farming ranarr still gets you loads of money as long as you use ultracompost, having magic secateurs equipped also helps
---
From 8 ranarr patches I'm normally left with 150-250k profit after buying 8 more seeds for the next run
---
Back on rs2, did u have like 99 range and 98 mage or something? I remember being younger and looking up original names on the highscores to see if people had those names and found yours! 
---
Improve your gear and kill times.
---
people with alot of money will just buy emblems and boost is so basicly making it a buyable pet. so nty.
---
Triggered enough to bring politics into a business discussion. You're not cut out for this, sorry to break it to you.
---
It's still a retarded meme, especially when idiots are like ''HURR DURR IT TAKES L;ITERAL YEARS TO GET 20 RC HURRRRR''
---
Yeah, no, it's not that slow at all. I got 82 to 90 in a week and a half while working full time. It's just a dumb meme.
---
I assume the information from those leaks would be the passwords for those specific sites. So as long as I'm using different passwords it should be okay or is there more information leaked and if so what precautions should I be taking? 
---
imagine thinking that the whip compares to anything as highest dps in the game. also barrows gloves fills the roles of all forms of combat. try melee against torags armor then try trident, try melee on ahrims then try a blowpipe.  Melee is not overpowered whatsoever. ranged is broke af and mage needs some balancing to even be meta.  If its defense is low enough for melee to be viable, the blowpipe will always outperform it. In what situation would you rather use a DFS when ranging? most monsters you range against that breathe dragonfire will never hit you back.  Its also arguable that the crystal shield is better in situations where you need defense while ranging.
---
EA to buy and destroy jagex from the inside to free up its playerbase, because rs players buy less $60 games when wasting all their time on runescape.

This is just the state of the game now. Unless you are both part of a clan and an active talker in that clan, or unless you are one of the rare extroverts that play this game, no one cares what you do or accomplish. Everyone is too busy being invested in themselves and gaining exp to care about the accomplishment of another. The basic state of the community makes it nearly impossible to make friends, as well. I think the last time I added someone to my friend’s list was actually years ago. Most of the time, people either ignore discussion and teleport away/log out, or simply provide very blunt 1-word answers which kills any hope of conversation. People just aren’t as talkative and friendly as they used to be, which I guess is in accordance to the general demographic of the community changing. It’s pretty sad. Every 99 I have gotten on this game, I have gotten alone, apart from one; and that was only because someone in my clan happened to be in the same area. 
---
No support. Just report the scammers and dont give your shit away.

Now judging by current repost levels

Fuck off twat. No one cares.

Why on some slayer tasks do I get a message in the chat box every 10 kills but then others I get nothing?

Add 2fa to both rs and email.

Make sure both passwords are different for each and have never been used before by you.

Youre telling me that if you have to risk karils to do revs decently then it wont put people off?
---
got mine at 34 farming
---
emails and passwords have been leaked, so always keep different unique passwords on everything. If you find your account has been breached it might be worth it to just change passwords on all accounts you value that uses that email.

Another potential use for jam could be to spread it on existing foods to give those foods a special bonus. Certain jams could give a food item a 5 run restore when eaten or prayer points as suggested. Basically these bonuses but added to current foods.

Justiciar is slower kills, you’ll hit a decent amount of 0s but you can do more kills per trip. Pretty afk.

Bandos is fast kills, less kills per trip though. Take more damage, have to pay attention.

That would be dope!! That would almost be better then the grim reaper 
---
It was definitely too late, no bug.
---
You're a good friend
---
This isnt in common actually, my noob friend said he wanted the blowpipe pet 
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
i mean shitty ones that last for 2 episodes and sound like they stole it from settled
---
Nah bud you were borderline late. A bit of server lag definitely made you late.
---
Let me guess, their "Ultimate Money Making Move" was to wait for a server reset and buy out Avery's rune store before the bots could.
---
Hahahahaha! Cute noob! Hahahahahaha quality content 
---
What’s dota?
---
Sounds like me 
---
Prayer works on Elvy too I imagine, right?
---
Yea I've gotten tons of magic seeds and torstol seeds due to having 3 ea of gloves and torches. Had I traded them in id most likely get kwuarms or some dynamite or something 
---
I'm not really a part of it. I'm not a member. But I was involved with them at one point.
---
Desperately? all I told you was to get involved with something either first hand, or have irrefutable evidence to support your claim before boasting about how trash something is.
---
I mean if you really want to just dont use the GE. No special need for a gamemode
---
how did that guy not know this lmfao
---
And not weird at all that this person openly admitted he is only reporting them because he lost gambling to them.
---
Good thing this is a video game. If you wanna use logic then tell me why I can only fit 28 Unnoted Ranarr weeds but can carry a whole dwarf cannon, godsword, 3 different sets of armor, and 17k cannonballs? 
---
Yes, this isn’t creating a new email. The only time you actually type it in different is on RS. You would still go to FirstLastname@yahoo to like secure your accounts and stuff but then when you login you type it different for whichever account you want to log into. 
---
Shit was late af yo
---
You're correct in theory but wrong in practice.
---
It's much easier to maintain 800k with mahog planks than it is to maintain 450k with oak doors.
---
Enjoy wiping the floor buddy. 
---
Everytime a jmod splashes in the wilderness they must get mad at that OP range gear. Then they suggest there biased ideas.

Please let dorothy go

I've seen it mentioned before, along with many people failing to use it correctly so I figured it give a little insight. You must download the app, allow permissions (there are instructions within the app), and then SET THE ORIENTATION BEFORE YOU OPEN THE GAME. If you fail to set the orientation before your game will look horrible.

Jagex knows if they banned 3rd party clients they'd lose some of their most loyal fans. 
---
RL devs seem respectful of RS as far as I can tell, I'm sure they'd respect any poll related requests. 
---
Blowpipet up 🔥🔥👌🏼👌🏼💯💯🙌🏻🙌🏻😩😩
---
Seriously: Because there is no data supporting that having it not hidden impacts how people votes, and therefore they can't do it as an integrity change.
---
This ain't it nephew 
---
Rare, but not as rare as you'd think.
---
this is appropriation of my culture
---
Wow thank you for this insider information. I would have never guessed that trading people my entire cash stack could have negative results! You truly are a hero.
---
I figured he meant max cape ava's?  Did he just mean assembler?  
---

You need to activate it quickly, not move your mouse slowly from the middle of the screen. when that happens. 
---
Where is his waves tho
---
Yeah no thanks then lets just keep what we have now
---
Its FREE. You’re not paying for it. What they have is plenty for the hefty price tag of $0.
