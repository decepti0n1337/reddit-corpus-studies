Actually the bot just announces what people bet and what the roll was. I just had to read chat.

The amount of times I’ve done this when going for ez low prayer is so relatable

Fish, craft, woodcutting

Q
---
I once heard zezima was made with a base total of 350 skills
---
Got a warrior ring at 140 ish kc.. was so pissed. Killed rex one more time because I hated him. Dropped a fucking berserker ring I laughed until I cried
---
I did appreciate how the RS3 redesigns made bronze through rune look distinct, rather than simple recolors. I just hate how the characters' elbows are parallel with their waists like some kind of monkey, so even the best armor designs tend to look "off."
---
I've been involved with this game longer than most active Jagex employees have worked there. I'd imagine.
---
How interesting would it be if you could adjust the skill total requirement to join your cc?
---
Me too! Should add me. I want to get the longest and gridiest ones out the way first so the endgame is a breeze!
---
It makes the game balanced ie better
---
Plant death rate is confirmed by Jagex to be 1/10 with Ultracompost. Doesn't change too much about the video but telling people to expect 1/20 (5/100) is not accurate.
---
Please
---
If you want, you can use super combats instead of overloads so that you only have to check every 15-20 minutes. You get slightly less xp per hour, but it's literally afk. You can also use a remote desktop app to click on potions, so you don't need to be at the computer at all.
---
Everybody uses the ignore list, because there's a constant flow of spammers on every world. Otherwise the chat would be unreadable. If Jagex really cared about community integrity and representing their game and practice, they would implement an auto-mute system to prevent spammers, gamblers, and phishers.
---
Tears of Guthix or quest rewards can get you some immediate farming. Natural history exam too. Besides those I'd probably fish until you can fly fish and do that for a while
---
Congratulations!

---
Can do a few relatively quick quests to boost Farming up to 30ish, then start doing daily tree runs.
---

---
Sea Slug quest will bring you up to around 30 Fishing, fly-fishing trout/salmon is pretty quick up until barb fishing and then if you want to keep fishing, barb fishing will get you strength/agility exp as well (although not much, 99 fishing gets you to like 75 str/agility from 1)
---
Crafting and Herblore and Smithing and Construction are all fast, just depends on how much money you have to waste.
---
Thieving is pretty quick as well.
---
Get the mining level for MLM and afk there if you need to afk, or woodcutting
---
It's acually super afk with a dual screen setup. Spent most of my time watching movies and TV shows.
---
That's why I skipped Pollnivneach because I really didn't like it and also found I had to pay attention far too much.
---
The cancer is love, the cancer is life.
---
So it takes 10 minutes to load up the cache for walking or an Easter Carrot Whack? Wow. Doesn't RuneScape have vector-based animations anyways? Why would there be a delay in loading a basic walking animation on LOW graphics? Faulty game engine I suppose. Shouldn't the cache be loaded based upon local map chunk and player item resources? Guess not. The cache is probably downloading fucking priffidinas character models and such while sat at the GE in f2p LUL.
---
And people thought the fally massacre was bad.. Lmfao

Funny looking crab you got there
---
Forgot to add *Remove DMM*
---
Sorry playin flatout bro
---
It has nothing to do with reddit drama or play time. It's common sense. Or so I thought.
---
I don't need me here either. I've wasted 13 years on this game. LUL.
---
It's fine
---
Any chance at all of adding the vine-sweeper minigame or something similar? 
---
Are there any plans to finish the Elemental Workshop quest line?
---
With mobile release its been great. I play while watching tv and wouldnt be a member if not for mobile
---
It could easily be changed to require certain skills for polls that will effect said skill. Ex. A change to redwoods can only be polled for those with 92 wc, a change to the mining guild requires 60 mining, etc. Would it be the best idea? Maybe not. We could see, however. Unfortunately for that to take effect it would probably be polled first.
---
It doesn't change
---
Ni**a wat?
---
Can you go in depth as to why you cant and wont add God Wars instances?
---
 if it is an issue with items coming into the game, make the instances only able to hold 1 person, and if possible, even make the items account bound? as I'm sure iron men don't want to drop their Bandos items after going to the effort of getting them. 
---
This would literally solve the problems of being able to even do God Wars not in a team on a low ping world       (aussie btw), I shouldn't be locked out of content because there aren't physically enough worlds for me to do said content on. AND when I am lucky to find a world, 9/10 time I get crashed and its never worth the supplies to try and fight back as its a lose lose for everyone.
---
Please for the love of god jagex I’ve been asking since day 1 of hydra release, my ex girlfriend doesn’t even ignore me this much.
---
Anyways,
---
With hydra currently only way for it to be damaged by chemicals if it’s standing right on it before it comes, is there a chance to change it so it can be damaged if it’s walking into it as well?
---
Also, possible to sync up in game kill count and what it says on the slay helm? I’ve died at a few bosses and they died from last hit or poison or whatever but the numbers don’t add up and it’s driving me CRAZY
---
What about people with alt accounts trying to stack votes?
---
This idea often gets rejected because there are players who actively keep their untrimmed skillcapes and feel their cape would be devalued if every future player gets to keep their untrimmed skillcape. There are also players who didn’t know they could keep their untrimmed skillcape by telegrabbing and don’t want newer players to be able to keep their untrimmed skillcape (I can’t have it, so they can’t have it).
---
There’s got to be a compromise. My idea should help keep the rarity of untrimmed skillcapes as newer players may not care for the untrimmed version, may prefer the trimmed version or may not be able to afford the cost, and should that player decide to pay the cost, hey, it’s a gold sink and may get that player to grind out the cost ($$$ membership for jagex).
---
By other accidents, you could die and forget to telegrab the cape from your item stack, or you could accidentally drop the cape and pick it back up again for whatever reason.

Feb-2015, 5th grade
---
I spent many heart wrenching after school evenings collecting runes in the dark knights castle.  Many times I would have collected a shit ton of runes, only to die to a pker. Finally I had enough for the coveted mithril 2h!
---
I wanted to show my new weapon off to my best bud at the time, who happened to be window shopping at the scimitar shop in alkharid.
---
I got side tracked traveling south from varrock when some guy luring noobs to the dark wizards at stone henge asked to purchase my 2h. I scoffed and told him that i wouldnt let it go cheaply and that he looked poor. He showed me his adamant platelegs and i shat my pants. 
---
He then put in 10000 in the trade window and in one game tick changed it to 1004, no idea how i fell for it but i did. I then phoned my bud and told him that i had to cancel our plans, i was headed back to the dark knights castle.
---
Ardy agility course is like 6 clicks a minute, very minimal effort

Do you post random bs on reddit just because you need the fake internet points to feel good about yourself?
---
I think it was like 06 and I’d been saving up because I thought gmauls looked awesome. I finally had the 750k to afford one, and tried to buy one from some guy, who was doing the old noted gmaul/rock hammer switch. Sad day
---
Spam collect when it's red. Collect some green and shoot. Only shoot when it's blue.
---
That’s sick
---
Years of training
---
Yeah the ring is like a dark totem, you get the pieces in sequential order every time.
---
With their development team, Q&amp;A  team, support team and just flat out lack of anything remotely professional i'm kinda scared of them adding something that game changing. If it were to be added and for me to vote yes it would have to be completely developed to 100% completion, tested for months, RELEASED on a test server after initial testing by employee's, tested by 1000+ PLAYERS, feedback from those 1000 players, tested AGAIN, polled and then released if it passes a poll. A skill will literally be involved with EVERYTHING in game in the future and must undergo drastic development and testing to even be considered.
---
Maxed player btw. If the skill were implemented I would probably race for rank which I've never even considered doing in a skill before despite having stupid hours as well as enjoying redundant skills that not many enjoy meaning I could gain a decent rank easily though not quickly.
---
TL;DR: Jagex are incompetent, any game changing update they implement is scary and needs insane amounts of testing. Opinion of a maxed player that participates in every aspect of the game and has multiple accounts (Besides mini games).
---
Wat, I've been playing for 3 years, play an hour or two a day with 1700 total level and have almost 1b bank. I'm a below average player lol
---
I don’t think there should be a restriction for all types of polls. Each piece of content relating to PvP for example should have PvPers only voting for x amount of time so Jagex can see their view and then let everyone else vote. I think the 75% rule isn’t good anymore and Jagex needs to step up and be more involved in the smaller communities.
---
Unless it's the first three waves, you should always just use 1 food on each healer that spawns and then use it again when the poison drops down to 2 damage.
---
I use that shortcut when implings try juking me by going in and out the mine.
---
I wish I could do agility or runecrafting while I'm at work but they aren't quite afk enough, or the methods I know aren't at least. I recently got mining knocked out of the way and I'm working on fishing now though!
---
Depends on your money situation. Swamp is the more powerful of the two, but it costs about 1.5x as much per cast. So if that change in cost is something that you can afford, I'd go with the trident of the swamp, otherwise just stick with trident of the seas.
---
exile is that u

I couldn't tell it was edited till i saw an extra ear

You had me until gamble was mentioned. The duel arena is already eboight of a gambling problem.

Are you factoring in selling the finished potions back after you are done. Also amulet of chemistry can make you some small cash gains doing herblore. Gratz on the gains it’s always nice having money :D.

Or just spend &lt;1 minute reading the [defender section of the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barbarian_Assault/Strategies#Defender_(blue\)).  
---
* Run to dispenser as quick as possible, run east around the cannon and call for Healer.
---
* Run one square north of the trap, drop 3 correct foods. Run north-west and drop 1 food west of the first big spike, and proceed to drop 5 correct foods west of the second big spike.
---
* Grab 2 logs and the hammer (from the north spawn), and make your way back to the trap.
---
* Call for Healer, and drop 9 more correct foods one square north of the trap.
---
* Standing on the food pile by the trap will prevent runners from getting it. You can use this to get multiple runners (up to 5) to be killed at once.
---
* Learn the Spawns of Penance runners.
---
* For any loose runners, use wrong foods to bring them back north.

Having at least an adept total level is going to be the most reliable gauge of a players proficiency for the game. Of course there are going to be outliers, but there are currently far more bots and unaware people making these decisions. 
---
It’s not that total level defines an understanding of the game, it just implies it.
---
You really have to nerf black d'hide at this point. Just from looking at the stats of all d'hide, it was clear that they were determined with no balancing or calculations in mind.
---
Even if black d'hide didn't exist, RED D'HIDE would be a comparable alternative to Karils and Armadyl. In fact, Red d'hide exceeds or ties Karil in all Melee defences and is only slightly worse in ranged attack bonus (+30 vs +25). This shouldn't really be the case at all, since red d'hide is supposed garbage intermediate gear on the level of adamant.
---
I have a concept for nerfing the magic and melee defences of red and black dragonhide slightly while buffing the same bonuses slightly of Karil's, and then introducing a new level of d'hide "dragon rawhide" which would be a very rare drop from all leather dragons which will match the stats of today's black dragonhide.

Only if they alao allow us to morph zul pets into the og snake

200m is the limit because xp is stored as a signed 32 bit int, with the last digit truncated so they can keep track of a decimal place. So 200m xp is actually stored in the engine as 2 billion. The theoretical maximum for xp is 214,748,364, but I assume they capped it at 200m because it looks nicer.

Thats why you don't marry and break up.

If there is something that motivates people to play something, are numbers that increase your bragging rights.
---
It's dangerous too, becouse it's addictive, and can cause a lot of stress, to those with high ego and low ELO.
---
It have its downsides, but could definetly work. Plus Solo PvP makes it easier, being your skill the only factor, with no teammates to blame, problem that creates a lot of toxicity in games with team arenas.
---
I like how I received many downvotes and no feedback except this one shows how the PVM community is truly against the PKing community. Wuped I like your idea of having a safe elo arena sort of like how last man standing is; this could be complemented with a buy-in be given certain gear. Maybe higher elo higher gear? (Excluding ancestrals n elys) This, however presents a new problem of elo droppers who purposely drop elo in an attempt to farm gold. With more debate we may get a solution looking forward to a response than just downvotes with no feedback.
---
I know the feeling man. I suicided to poison to drop the runes I would need for the boost on lumby elite at the water altar. My wily hellcat was following me at the time so it was gone. The 8 full spices never gave me a +5 boost. Then the new kitten grew into the cat and died in the same way yours did. And then I finally got it more spices after growing my third cat into another wily hellcat, and got it on the first try. Still better than actually runecrafting.

Nah. I just recently started doing Barrows runs. This was my 6th run through so I’d have been surprised if I got one so early.
---
I will get every single other skill to 99 before I ever get my agility past 70.
---
For me, I got about the same times but it felt more consistent and I could get more kills per trip.
---
Additionally you can use a Chrome Plugin like "Switcheroo" which is a basic redirect tool. If I click a link on google search to the old wiki I just instantly load the new one. As the URL's are the same except "oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com" is "oldschool.runescape.wiki"

Let players use houses when the original owner is not there, the main account could have a 'whitelist' which allows certain players to have access to your poh. This would benefit alts etc by having a poh layout which suits them instead of using w330.

rank 2,000,000 is 424 total level. This means there are over 2 million accounts with 300+ total, which basically shows that 300 total to vote is ridiculous.

My advice is to try to invest in a Spectral Spirit Shield, it will make your runs 100% easier.  And the way to deal with his special attacks is that, when he is under 200 HP and he casts the ghosts, he will ALWAYS casts the 3 lava things.

This is how you kill the wilderness faster than anything Jagex could do, keep dividing the community.

Get some switches going and you should be able to kill players because they can only protect from one style of attack, if you can't then it's on you.

Maybe there are days he makes 200m in 3 days, then the other 10 days he doesn't. However, must be profitable for him if he's still doing it. Probs RWT's it.

For the Lava pool ghost combo, when cerb is below 200hp and does ’aroooo’, **be ready to run away when the ghosts cross the skull**. This helped me get used to it, anticipating to run away is very important.

Basement of west varrock bank, a level 75 with a d scim and d legs told me he’ll sell me his account for 60K (The most GP I ever had as a kid while I was f2p) He said he’ll give me the first half of the password for 30k then the second half of it for the other 30k.
---
About 0$

Yeah would be nice if they toned it down and kept  npc/ gear designs simple. For example the scythe of vitur looks a bit "extra"

Err. Its going to be shit. Maybe 100-300k profit average per hour? 
---
I've of the opinion that you're better off doing Wilderness slayer until you unlock the level of Dust Devils and Nechs.
---
And you'll start going for $ from slayer when you unlock and can handle high content like Gargs, Wyverns, DKs, Demonic Gorillas, Sire, Cerb, Hydra and so on.

I’m so glad you let us know you will delete your post once the question is answered. Thank you.

You were comparing level 1 armor to level 70 armor when it's level 70 armor to level 70 armor.
---
What.......I really don’t think runescape is the right game for you if you can’t grasp this concept.
---
My issue with the Wilderness is putting PvM things out there, sure I don't have to do it but some of the PvM out there is only out there so PKers have someone to kill.
---
I don't mind PKers, if they have fun then go ahead, but IMO it should only be a PvP area so people that want a fight can get a fight.

I did try. I returned with a bronze hatchet and a rake but the swamp monster from the bubbly tar made pretty quick work of me so I gave up on it. At this stage in the account the rebuild is more of an inconvenience than anything. I lost about 100k which I can make back in a couple of hours so it’s really not a big deal.
---
Definitely, but no one is arguing that players who max suddenly understand how to balance drop tables. But more experienced players are more likely to know what’s balanced and a good game direction than new players. When you have people who are insanely low, they aren’t likely to know what it feels like to do Zulrah or do Underground Pass, so why should they vote on that stuff?
---
definitely a bot lol.

It shouldn't matter if he might know where he live - death threats are taken very seriously by both Jagex and the police. I say report it immediately to both.

Get Kandarin hard diaries. I don’t remember the exact values but it saves something like over 15 hours to 80. Someone correct me if I’m wrong. Plus it makes the course beyond afk, you won’t ever use a single energy pot for as long as you stay. Grinded 7 hours while working, stayed at 100% energy the entire time.

Cool idea, but dynamic examine info unfortunately falls under the "engine work" meme and can't be done.  There also wouldn't be a way to bank them while differentiating between multiple players' bones.

I think part of the reason its hopelessly dead currently is the lack of useful rewards. Castlewars is still relevant largely due to having BiS pure armor, from what I've noticed.

Story of how I hacked: 
---
This was probably back in around 2006-2007, me and my friend would go to the local public library to play RS (Like everybody else did). We noticed two other kids sharing a computer and they were playing on an account that was lvl 112 with whip and barrows gear (pretty high content, for me at least as I was a regular f2p player). Well we complimented on how nice the account was and moved on to playing our own. We jokingly asked him for his password, to which his buddy replied “his password is so ballin you will never guess it”, and weirdly he repeated the phrase multiple times while chuckling. Later that night we went back to my buddies house to play some xbox. And while playing I kept on thinking about the phrase that the account owners buddy kept repeating, I instantly dropped the controller and ran to my friends computer with him following me. 
---
FUCKERS PASSWORD WAS “soballin”
---
If I had gold. This would be a post I'd give it too.
---
gotcha. is it worth killing them without fremmy elites? I want to start doing some low level bossing with my friends that are pretty new but i’m not sure if I should grind out that RC level
---
Summer 2001. Neighbor got me and a friend into the game. We all 3 shared passwords, we were dumb kids, the idea of an mmo, or account security meant nothing to us yet. One day my friend and I log in and all our stuff is gone. We immediately blame the neighbor who showed us the game and we change his password to "shaunsmomsuckscocks" or something to that effect, and we take all his stuff. 
---
Fast forward to the next day, we're playing basketball and the scanner neighbor's mom comes out and is angry at us. He told his fucking mom we stole his account after he stole our shit... We explain the situation and she demands we come inside their house and log in and give him his account back. 
---
Just typing the password wasn't enough for her... She demanded we tell her the password. It was the most awkward thing I had experienced in my life up until that point, and still ranks very high.
---
Think there’s another account like this already, just a heads up. Good luck though!
---
No.
---
jesus are u fucking braindead OP

Will let you know when he comes, ive only been playing since 07-08 anyways, still too fresh, and walking around with Private off and public off doesn’t help ahah.

Not sure what a level 124 accomplishes by killing a level 89 carrying nothing

I got on a diary kick recently. Did all diaries up to hard save wildy, desert, and kourend. There really are a lot of useful things to unlock.

I prefer the sense of gratification knowing I made my account good by myself.

Lmao just block him you pansy
---
Damn. I dont play ironman, but this hurts me.

Maybe. Like I agree with the first part, but I don't think I ever manually capitalized it. I type like a child and never capitalize anything. Idk maybe I did once but I doubt it.

Then it turns blue and hits two 40’s back to back on you while the snakelings hit 5’s and 10’s all while you didn’t expect it so you die

I remember actually purchasing a legitimate copy of Windows XP Home; pretty sure off Newegg for near $200. I believe I still have the sleeve and original disc too somewhere.
---
&gt; I still use Windows XP on my weaker laptop to this day thanks to a registry mod that let me have the Embedded updates, but now thats its over I need to replace the os.
---
I'd highly recommend Linux; something like Lubuntu or Xubuntu works wonderful on lower-spec computers, and OSRS runs fine on Linux.
---
People downvoting you but probably dont realise the guy that made the "angles" meme died

No :/ when I try to recover password it says invalid email even though on my phone I'm logged in through Google on my phone. I was also paying frequently on my computer but when I went to log back in it's saying the email is invalid
---
Why spend 3k to be straight when you can spend 6k and be *double gay*
---
Would be pretty neat, but I can't imagine this would be easy to implement nor be made any sort of priority. But I'd definitely like to see it eventually and can't see any reason against it.
---
Due to the slow attack speed of godswords they are almost never used as a main DPS weapon, but if you buy a SGS you can use it as a spec weapon on pretty much every task as a really good spec weapon
---
Not after you’re 20 levels above course requirements, at that point it gives significantly less marks to the point you should never bother stepping foot on the course. Kandarin is definitely best till 80 for marks with diaries. 15% boost in marks
---
Same problem, is there a fix yet?
---
Id also like to know. I think ima try and max on w345 cause regular rs is boring me to death
---
BRUH lmaooo same shit happened to me when I hit 83. My cat got combo’d and it took me like 3 days to grow another one and get the boost bc I afk too hard and had two kittens run away. If you do ratcatchers and get a wily cat they are much stronger.

Did you fully read what I said?
---
Currently high level players doing wintertodt use no food at all.
---
People suggest adding some sort of warmth meter where you consume something to raise it, making hp not matter, this is good for mid level players, but this would make high level players have to consume whatever warmth food they add instead of not eating anything like they currently do.

But the cape roasts you while you're wearing it anyway. It's made out of lava and you put it directly on your back.

OH LAWD HE COMIN
---
It's true, but what you gonna do? I mean World of Warcraft had the same problem before they updated character models.
---
Imagine on the login screen, OSRS had a server/world list, and in each game mode (regular, DMM, ironman, etc.) you had up to 5 characters that all use the same bank. For Dofus it's different because there are different classes, but it'd be the same with pures, zerkers, etc.
---
New characters get XP multipliers until they reach the level of the highest level character.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Ye I already like xfce its really slick. Only issue I have with it is some lag/tear issue on my main pc. Bit considering its a laptop with a 60hz it will probably work well on it :) Ill install it soon
---
missed "later virgins" joke smh
---
Nice
---
I imagine once RS3 mobile releases, player count will climb like it did with OSRS.
---
Whatever you do, it won't be a problem unless you really ignore one of the skills.
---
For max efficiency, you'd want a very specific leveling path hunting very specific locations. And at the end the benefits wouldn't even be that much better than doing the leveling in whatever order. The early levels come fairly quick so you can level as you deem appropriate.
---
To simplify:  
---
Level attack when you want to improve how often you hit.  
---
Level strength when you want to improve how much you hit.  
---
Level defence when you want to upgrade your set.
---
Which isn't relevant since OP isn't a Youtuber.

Yes, the amount depends on your mining lvl. As you unlock new ores you start getting those from the mine as well. I'm not sure about the exact gp/h though. If you look it up on YouTube pretty much every guide gives you an idea of an average gp/h and XP/h.

Im 28 and have recently started while at uni  :)

Yeah it's the database leaks is the most likely culprit for this. Even so, OSRS is the only game I have ever seen with problems with security.

---
It tells you as soon as you log in noob, every time you log in...
---
Yeah, thanks for the reply. This is just my personal view on the whole situation and direction game seems to be going in regards to visual feel. There are also newer things that I do like the design of because they still feel like they fit in, like Zulrah, CoX and certain weaponry like tbow, kodai wand and rapier.
---
It's just the constant progression of it all that worries me. Newer generations joining the team with "fresh, new ideas" that just feel out of place in an old school reboot that was originally meant to recapture that which we all call "the old school feel".
---
Though I do appreciate it being hard to please everyone and that the game now has a hugely diverse playerbase, and it can be hard to separate genuine good feedback from memes and rants, and I think you guys are doing an overall good job.
---
(all this is strictly about the model/area design, my views on stats, drops and exp-rates are even harsher, but thats for another time)
---
You have mental issues if you care so much about what other people do. Seek help.
---
You're really good at adding dimension and volume.  I dig it
---
I believe 30-99 is roughly 40m not including gems bought from gem bags using nuggets
---
U mine paydirt, then you “wash” it to obtain ores you normally use. 
---
The type of ore obtain depends on mining level, and ores above coal gives bonus xp. 
---
There are two levels in the mine, the bottom floor is ffa but veins is not timer based, while the top floor requires a payment of 100 nuggets and the vein is timer based. You will get more xp and more afkness from top floor than bottom floor.
---
Avg i think is about 20-30k mining at bottom floor, whilst top floor should get you 35-45k xp. 
---
Gold earn is not amazing... i got like 4m from 73 to 80 mining.
---
There were 300 Spartans but more than 300 Greeks because they had support from other states. I think about 2000 - 4000 in total. The Spartans were the main game changer.

The authenticator is great security feature, how come runescape website doesn't require authenticator to log in like Steam does?

Currently its possible to ignore the authenticator code and just disable authenticator with e-mail.
---
I used dhcb and blowpipe only. No bgs or dwh specs
---
When will there be more discussion brought up about crystal armor balancing?
---
It's even more pathetic than that. Jagex is profiting too much off their memberships to not look the other way. And of course this subreddit's community is so stupid that I'm going to get replies like "umm acktchually they use bonds sweetie". Perhaps the biggest consequence is the mass inflation that they've contributed to. With the duel arena tax taking out 20b/day and the 2016 rate of gp entering the game being 16.5b/day there will almost certainly be a day in the future where the economy deflates because venezuelans account for a huge portion of the increase from 16.5b/day to whatever it is now, and you better believe they're going to all leave once their economy improves. Then you'll get to listen to this idiot subreddit cry about how jagex needs to make the prices of items go back up, which of course will only be able to be done by releasing more op versions of revs.

I would highly recommend changing your registered email. Chances are they're just phishing emails and do not actually access to your RuneScape account. Still, changing your RuneScape password is a good thing. 
---
At the very least check the recent login activity of your registered email. Doing so will let you see any suspicious login attempts.

Nice strawman.

It's like a failed 13 def pure. And it can be useful for multi. But then I would advice 13 def (def XP is due to nature spirit).

Well I guess that would work but only with things that already have an old model, I don't think there's that many though.
---
I believe a developer showed interest in finishing the slug quest line at some point.
---
Wasn't that the point that it was some strange mystical lands that had just been discovered, personally i like the direction of adding something that we haven't already seen.
---
The player models, armor, weapons, etc look bad but the environments are actually gorgeous. Shame they're all wasted in RS3.
---
To anyone receiving these phishing mails, I would highly recommend changing your registered email. If that's your main email, I would suggest to consider changing that as well or at the very least to add all those phrases to a filter.
---
What ever happened here?

I’ll be widowmaker

Yeah i love new content I'm actually excited they've hinted at the "eastern lands" where the katana came from. I think they said they might explore adding that in the future on a Q&amp;a

I always equip them to be safe, but I'm almost certain now that, let's say you got the next defender, walked out, and walked in w/o talking to her, that there's a chat screen with here discussing that she will now drop the next tier up.

IMO gambling should just be banned altogether.

Alcohol being the "go to" for addiction didn't just come out of the blue. Its because the reasons are valid and are of great concern to many people. Also, to me the argument of "drink responsibly" is laughable. Because you can also argue that everybody is a responsible drinker until they are not. I drink 2 shots and still feel okay, I am a responsible drinker. I feel that i can take a 3rd shot, but turns out my 3rd shot stuns me and my actions fall into the category of "involuntary"

Brightness and fix it usually. Default mobile runs at 60 fps. You can turn it down to 45/30/15 in settings. I usually play on 15 or 30 to not bake my hands.

Played before bank pins. iirc it had to do with the viruses at the time. You have to click the PIN to prevent keyloggers, so people would give you a virus that would take a screenshot whenever you click. Been a loooong time since I've actually logged in (why am I here, idk...) so can't remember for sure but I think it blanks ALL the numbers when you click?
---
Well you could create a new account with members, use the 4m from your 6m cash stack to buy a bond on the hacked account, and then transfer the stuff over to the new account.
---
I guess I don’t see improving events as a big change, and you don’t need new mobs, you take existing ones and tweak them for the theme of the holiday a bit 
---
I don’t do the events, I’ve not done them since maybe 2008 when I recognised they were stupid. Everyone thinks the events are trash, go ask your clan, nobody thinks they’re good - you don’t even think they’re good - but Reddit likes to argue against everything.
---
What is his method?
---
I thought you couldn’t trade p2p items on a f2p acc?

I would convert it personally, when I started osrs I wanted to be a skilled but quickly found out the game is really hard when you don’t have a main. I suggest either putting your account on rest and grinding out a main, or just converting your account and move forward with your ex-Ironman account.

Personally I’m pretty financially stable and I rarely use prayers outside of protection. The pots are pricy to replenish prayer and I’ve just found the overall speed of the cannon and the raw damage of 30-35 (depending on your cannon ball) to be much more helpful than the extra 3-7 max hits I can get with piety. Although on tasks I can’t use my cannon I will sometimes flick piety.
---
For real haha.
---
Really hope i get this luck, 140kc with the hammer and 2 gloves so far... Would love the pet ;)

Gl on your next goal famalam

It’s actually just 50/50, you either get it or you don’t.
---
My problem is the acc is f2p so I can’t transfer items without buying members which I don’t wanna do at all for an acc I won’t use
---
as an rs3 player can you give me some examples of the graphical inconsistencies going on?
---
Ahhh I see, ok lol I will do that when I can which is like in 3 weeks cuz I’m broke lol
---
Archer ring is essentially useless against 1 def. You're already hitting basically every hit
---
Hasta is crucial, you can't use defender with spear
---
I don't really care if graphics are more detailed or more plain -- I much more care that they should be consistent across the board. IMO it would have been better if they remade rest of gielinor look like zeah, or if they designed zeah to look more in line with the rest of gielinor

From what I remember during one of the DMMT finales people were holding up in Lumbridge waiting for the final announcement to get to the final square, but in typical DMM fashion something happened. I think they didn't announce the barrier moving and so everyone who was camping in lumby was scrambling to get to the final safe zone and died either on the way due to the gate being spammed by fifty other people or just before reaching it.
---
I did ask Jagex myself to reset my password. Email is sent from the same adress. It's in the same 'conversation'. So it's not a phish. I checked that for 5 times now.

Think like early 2007, fell for the reverse password scam lol. Lost like a good 200k or so.

I did change my email and password on RuneScape. Just to be sure I guess.
---
&gt; Fuck gathering feathers
---
&gt;I enjoy the challenge

Yea, no you don't. You literally just complained about it, implying you don't have fun gathering feathers, and then you brush off the only way you should ever spend your time getting them because you're an idiot? Y I K E S.

That’s badass bro don’t listen to any efficiency dickheads if they try to dissuade you

Almost surprising you stopped answering. Oh wait, no, that was 100% expected.
---
The 'from' address on an email is easy to fake, so never rely on that to judge the authenticity of an email.
---
You have to examine the contents, and in particular make sure the links and buttons take you to [runescape.com](https://runescape.com), and not some other domain.
---
There's more advice here:

You can put ore on as long as there are fewer than 28 bars available. This is actually the fastest way to do gold ore, instead of using ice gloves.

Yeah even though Private servers already have group ironman systems, can't be that hard if a couple of people in their mums basement can do it, why can't a whole team of dedicated people do it whos actual job it is and get paid for what they do...

Blood/Soul Runes, Konar, Catacombs, Arclight, Farming Guild, WT, Arial Fishing, 7 quests?, Shamans, Blast Mining, Soulbearer and Ensouled Heads, Chambers of Xeric, Combat Training locations, Thieving training locations, Extra farming spots.  But yea nothing worth doing there /s.

Interestingly enough he didn't need the help if he just did an account recovery instead of spamming change password and then giving up thinking it was Jagex's fault.

Then don't go there?

Try going without dwh it's not really needed if you have a dhcb.whats ur gear setup? Recommended to use full void,salve ei, super antifire and venom+. Try not to eat to much during the attack phase and eat during frozen or acid you should be able to do 4-8 kills easy
---
tell that to the finnish playerbase.
---
I don’t think it’ll be too bad. Crashers aren’t usually as bad at a 2 spot compared to a three spot as well. 
---
My personal recommendation is work towards completing Bone Voyage to unlock fossil island. Ammonite crabs are less crowded and have more hp. Probably look to go there around 60+ strength with maul and fury. Plus completing the basement exhibits for xp lamps is the fastest way for an obby mauler to train slayer to 55 without gaining many range/magic levels

It's not directly begging but the idea is that  eventually, someone will feel bad for you and pay you a lot more than the value and then says keep the 13 trouts. So if you keep doing this then you're taking advantage of peoples sympathy?

I know, and I'm saying anyone in the top ~100 most likely didn't die because they fucked up. Although there have definitely been cases (like Fuse)
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks
---
If they are genuine Jagex emails, then there's usually guidance on what to do at the bottom of the email.
---
For example, to request a password reset, someone would only need to know the account's login name. It should be safe to ignore those, though I'd change my password anyway, just in case.
---
To request Authenticator is removed, or that the registered email is changed requires both login name **and** password, so if you get one of those, then you need to change your password immediately.
---
The other thing to bear in mind is that if someone is requesting these emails, it may indicate that they have access to your email account and are trying to change things to lock you out. If you get any unsolicited emails from Jagex, you should make sure that you email account is secure.
---
I think the main reason they are not hidden is that jagex is scared that 3rd party clients coud read out the results(What their players vote) and then not make them public. Then use that data to invest correctly. 
---
The poll result data would be so valuable if it was hidden and one had all the votes of all players of a certain client.

Can't believe shit like that gets upvoted.
---
So OP is a moron. Got it. God it even says give your password to no one, even jagex right at the login screen xD.
---
Thhbbbbt!
---
Just to put this out there:
---
The only reason one would make an add like that is because their ghost mouse program had a little troyan inside that steals your Acc data.
---
But if you want to cheat its only fair that you get hacked I guess.
---
But then I don't want those cunts to get gp.
---
It won't happen. They're the top players so they get listened to more
---
Kill a boss slowly or lose the only life you have on your account? Hmmm..
---
Jagex never resets accounts to turt island.
---
You are logging into the wrong account or a dmm world.
---
That hurts bruh, I didn’t think your dragon spear drop from sire was mildly interesting either but I didn’t say nuffin :(
---
It makes more sense for them to use new techniques to build something new before tackling redoing something old. As well as any time they change ANYTHING that’s old content people freak out on reddit.
---
If you haven't seen the 13 trout video yet you probably should
---
"is it gay to play a female character?"
---
Oh he got noticed alright. Turns out OP thought he was talking to Jagex in january so the moron gave the hacker his password change and the hacker just waited till now to rinse him xD
---
I think the idea is that the "reward" you get is lower value than what they ask you to show, so when you do show it, they show the reward and hit accept, hoping that you won't be paying attention or will be so excited to get the reward that you just quickly hit accept, not realizing that you're giving them the items you were asked to show.
---
Its a scam.They try to get you to show an item around double the value of  what they would give you,you put the item in the trade screen,he puts the money and pressess accept.If you are not paying attention you might quickly press accept so he won't change his mind and forget that you left an item alot more valuable in the trade window.
---
I LIKE ROCKS 😝
---
It requires an informed population, not an educated population. Lucky for you.
---
The Mage Arena 2 models, possibly? Everyone complained about the laziness of reusing models but models are reused everywhere else in the game.
---
Ok, so there are a few variations, one is that the person shows their cash stack in the trade and the person who scams starts to chat while the trade window is open. Most common one is that they say that their friend is willing to give them the promised items but first they need to take this teleport tab to, for example, Falador 
---
Then they trade the Falador tab on the trade screen while the other person still has their cash stack showing and they just hope that he will get distracted and forget about his part of the trade. I know it might sound stupid but believe it or not there are people who have fallen for this scam so beware.

You have to actually comment A to get the announcement flair buddy.

Obviously he didn't think he would die. He would not be rank 10 if he took the slow way round doing everything, that's what someone like Mudkip does and it takes him way longer to do anything.

Pretty sure very few people actually pay money for the game. It takes like literally \~30 minutes to make a bond at vork.

I get them pretty frequently, sometimes even get them back to back thanks to the Slayer cape. I had 4500 points saved up prior the release of Konar, those lasted me for 2700 kills or so. I've also updated my block list to drakes, wyrms, bloodvelds, fire giants and hellhounds.

Can a make-all option be added to draconic visages, skeletal visages, and sigils when smithing them on an anvil?

I agree, I like the shard / loot share ideas.

I realise a lot of the arguments are it causes issues with the economy, but ffa's are no different from lootshare, only people have a more balanced/fair chance of receiving items than just being maxed and pounding out the damage

The average yield using ultra compost is 7.7 herbs per seed or 61 herbs per 8 seed run. If you look at his 60 herbs/trip column snapdragon does make a better case but aventoe/toadflax/cadantine are still better.

How petty of you. Just because you had to suffer through something, doesn’t mean that it should never be touched. If that was the case, there’d never be an update to the game, ever. Heaven forbid Jagex identify a problem and develop content that seeks to remedy that problem.

It’s not hard at all to find a world without a cannon unless you’re at ogres. I don’t see how this is a problem. It would be way more crowded at one spot if it was just one world where you couldn’t cannon.

Ever heard of ironman mode?
---
Thanks bro
---
Such worlds already exist. They're called f2p worlds.

yeah but it's still possible to do that without compromising the art style of the game. don't get me wrong, zeah looks *better* than the rest of the game, but that's not what most people (including me) want.

Jagex: "it sucks to suck"
---
Honestly, just keep moving it to where you need it to be. Rimmington is good if you need to access a max house. Pollyivnich is good because some desert spots suck to get to and require carpet rides. Relleka is good if you don’t have the diaries done (the diaries give you better teles there).
---
I’ve never used the other spots. You will have to move your house for a couple achievement diaries too.
---
Wherever it suits you. Mines currently in Kourend cause I have teles everywhere else (no xerics talisman). Before I put a waterbirth tele in my house I had it in Frem cause I had no tele there
---
Go on than
---
Is that the big black dragon in wildy?

Well I’m still pretty low level like 1230*ish total not having done any construction or hunter. But I just keep everything now, and force myself to use it rather than sell. Currently running a lot of barrows to sets. Exceptions are ever changing mostly things I feeI probably won’t get around to in time enough to be worth my while like not just buying a whip. Idk I don’t stream so I don’t have to uphold a standard but like the idea of forcing myself to be more self sufficient. Not quite an iron man but it’s my way of fighting that urge of starting an iron man that I don’t have time for.

ADDITIONALLY, gradual changes in a tone is fine as long as it uses that (god ugly but iconic) linear gradient. I use blender a bit and noticed that old RS models tend to look like they have that 3d mesh "smooth" option enabled, creating these gradients that hide the sharp vertexes.

My question is why did it drop to 170? And am I going to have to check GE every morning before work to make sure I don’t lose money
---
its such a waste of time to tele out IMO
---
Then how doesn’t OP know that nieve follows you in the quest??
---
I’m in a slightly similar situation where I have a 1700 normal and 1500 Ironman (32m xp difference) and I started my Ironman because I got a bit lost on my main. 
---
I only have the ability to play for 1-2 hours a day max and it’s on my phone on my commute to work so I can’t exactly go hard. I’ve found my Ironman way more rewarding and i don’t intend on going back to my main for quite some time (I still buy and sell my battlestaffs and do kingdom just in case though...).
---
HAHA
---
Zeah is far from hd. It might not only have a poly count of 4 but its not hd. 
---
To say that every area should be exactly the same is like complaining that asia and western cultures are vastly different. It makes no sense. Zeah is a completely foreign culture and as such should probably look vastly different than the rest of the game.
---
Sit kid
---
Ideal location would be anywhere and having 99 construction so you can cape to any portal.
---
Yah, just wait till it gets close to the max amount you can hold and open it. I don’t think you have another option.

Diary’s are a great way to get Runecrafting up to 50.
---
I think part of the reason why it’s demand isn’t so high is because we have the DH lance. The rapier has a stab option, but the lance will out DPS it on all dragons which is quite a bit.
---
What fish causes the one on the left?
---
Would it be a better use of money in buying the lance for drag tasks as there’s plenty of them,
---
And using tent?

I’ve never seen that outfit before! Can someone please tell me what it’s called?

If you're worried about rapier crashing, you're probably good to just stick with a whip. Like I said, it's a pretty small improvement, and if you're just doing slayer, you probably won't see hardly any difference between the two.

Looks like dirt to me.

Not to brag but I've also died to Hydra.

Oh ok thank you that makes sense
---
Its not the wrong account i have loads of evidence!
---
im pretty sure the op meant labeling a world with a dutch flag (or finnish) not nessecarily adding new servers, as runescape's networking demands are insanely low when compared to modern games. If you arent goin overseas you are pretty much fine.

oh sorry i thought you meant you doubted the legitimacy of the article lmao
---
some of the weed you get in the uk is laced with various other chemicals because dealers here need a way to compete with each other; the potency of their weed is what usually keeps people coming back, so our cop stabber here may well have had a spliff that was laced with something more violent than just weed

You think you can safespot my schtoyle?

He reportedly shouted "Sit kid". Motives are unclear.
---
What people don't realise, is that when you get a new phone, you must remove the authenticator from your account and re-enable it on your new phone. 
---
With an authenticator delay, it would mean we would have to wait X days after getting a new phone before we could log back into runescape again. This is a limitation inherent to the Google authenticator, not by Jagex' way of implementing it. 
---
To solve this, either Google needs to allow us to transfer authenticators from 3rd party apps to a new device, or Jagex needs to create their own authenticator, which is quite a complex task. 
---
Just wanted to point that out.
---
Even doing ToB on UK servers is bad for me compared to German worlds, Finnish servers would probably be even better.
---
&gt; you get jewed out

nah

I think it would only give you things relevant to your level.
---
The DPS calculator I use (Bitterkoekje) doesn't have the PC mobs, but assuming they don't have massive defense bonuses then similar mobs are showing void is better... Granted it may vary based on ranged level (didn't check different levels,  but 99-112 was showing void in the lead) but yeah.

I'll explain.

\&gt;that stuff looks completely trash and doesn't fit the game at all
---
That's your opinion. Many disagree.
---
Why on earth you are killing skotizo while already having hard clue?
---
Its the same old rule that applies in this scenario as well.
---
Everyone who has played more than you (or is better than you) is a loser with no life.

And everyone who has played less than you (or is worse than you) is a noob
---
Old school = 2007/2008, not 2004.
---
Seems like a really weird thing to do. What they'll hack people but only if they don't play? Nice hackers?
---
i like all of this until i saw the rewards boiled down to xp tomes and lizard shaman gear. i do like the pet though. i think the double xp tools would be better than tomes and im not a fan of the armor at all. still a cool idea though and i'd love to see SC implemented some how.

Ice gloves don't cool them. They let you pick up bars sooner. Otherwise you get a message saying you should wait for them to cool down. If you are wearing ice gloves you just pick up the bars straight up there's no step in between where you cool the bars down.
---
The bars don't get smelted until the ores actually go down into the furnace. You'll see the bar dispenser flash and that's when it's smelted and the bars have been made.  
---
If you're getting 2 XP drops it is probably because the dispenser is partially full and there is still ore in the furnace that cannot be smelted until you retrieve enough bars from the dispenser.  
---
e.g. if you left in 27 bars in before, then it can only smelt one bar because the bar dispenser can only hold 28. That is why you only get 1 XP drop worth 56 XP. When you retrieve the bars, there is now room for the rest of the gold ore that is currently unsmelted to now be smelted into bars, hence the second XP drop which happens after picking up bars, you're not picking up the current bars, you're picking up the bars from the last batch.
---

Tbh nothing really. Maybe I’m a bit salty cos I cba to learn how to do it and people make a lot of money from it. But it doesn’t really bother me.

---
Honestly we really don't need range and mage shay armor, blowpipe already shreds shamans. You would literally never miss on them wearing black d hide equivalent. At least right now you can not wear shay armor and dodge their attacks like in CoX, or wear the armor. Just my 2 cents. Otherwise I would kill to have stealing creation come back, I spent countless hours playing that minigame even after I was maxed just because it was a blast to go barrage the other team and annoy people with T5 gear 30 seconds after game started.
---
A lot of people are using max account with high level mage tank gear, or taking advantage of the 1250,1500,1750,2000 total level worlds
---
I love you

If it werent for the uneducated voting, we wouldnt have had a welfare state, or a lot of civil rights. Well educated upper middle class people only wanted rights for themselves at that time. The idea that bettetr education=better politics is straight wrong

Wait what? Was anyone asking for polls results to be hidden until the poll is finished? What I heard players complaining about is that every time you went to vote you were smacked in the face with the results before you even got to form your own opions
---
This aged well
---
They could easily make the delay an optional thing when setting up the authenticator.
---
imagine killing vorkath instead of demonic gorillas on task, oof
---
Now we have to rely on Jagex to not intentionally fudge the results of the polls instead of being able to see in real time what's going to pass or not. For all we know they might poll something and everyone votes no but oh look at that when they show the polls? 80% voted yes somehow. #ShowPollResults

Moneymaking. A higher farming level decreases the chance of your herbs dying and increase your yield (right?). Either way at a lower farming level the expensive seeds aren't really worth it and herbs like avantoe will always profit even if they dye or get shitty yield since the seeds are so cheap.
---
Thanks for not taking yourselves too seriously. Truly think hiding the polls will lead to better and more varied game content

hydra is about 130k/kill+claw price/1,000. multiply that by 28 kills hr (with diary) and that should be the gp/hr. subtract costs of scales though, not sure how many u use/hr there

I won't forget. I'm looking at twitch for more accounts to follow and I'll make a new post with all the updated accounts. With that it will be possible for more people to see the post and thus find a content creator they like. After all, it would suck for someone to spend hours into an account and almost no one following if people want to follow (if it is entertaining of course, but people can decide for themselves).

This looks like something out of a private server that drops rares lol
---
Could they change the "country" on the server to "US West" and "US East" instead of "US"? I mean that's oversimplifying it probably, but doesn't seem like a terribly difficult problem to solve in one way or another.
---
I can’t wait for people to comment on the rewards and not the game itself. I swear it’s baffling how much of this community thinks only of rewards instead of content; it just exemplifies how much of Runescape’s content is not fun to play.
---
Yeah true, but we can always try to keep the list up-to-date as much as possible.
---
ive done that more times than i can count lol
---
I was thinking that it would be voluntarily set. Mandatory for that reason sounds like it should be ingame already because it would put you at a big disadvantage.

If you have a surplus of gold to blow go for the rigour account.  You could probably just chill at 42 def for awhile while if you want.

I can't speak for everyone, but I'm sure many people outright do not want a new skill. Those who do, but still aren't into warding probably want a skill that is 1) useful and engaging, 2) designed from the bottom up as opposed to the top down.

Rename him to jail jed

Should be able to change log-in email, security questions/answers, and of course, authenticator delay.

As far as I'm aware that just makes it so the whole Zuk fight is as if it was post healers (he shoots 5 times per rotation instead of 4). The corner safespots are still always the same, however, which is why this is weird.

It's discouraging to say the least.

Although I think this is great and should be celebrated, we shouldn’t forget that it took months if not years to get this implemented. It should have been done a long time ago especially considering the entire community has made it a important issue for ages, and that the results not being hidden may have hindered game development. All that said, this is a good step forward. 1 less crab

Hijacking top comment.

Auth removal delay is a good solution. Its attractive because it would be easy to implement. The worst case situation is that u have to wait 7 days to play if a hacker set one up, but if they set up a bank pin, its the same thing already. Its hard to play without access to ur bank. It should be implemented 100% because this would have prevented most of the mod jed hackings as u cant just instantly clean an acc after recovery. 
---
But another solution, one that doesnt have as big as a negative impact is simply another 2fa. Auth sucks right now because its not 2fa. Access to email address gives you the acc password and access to auth. Thats a design flaw.
---
So add SMS/text. Make it so you need email and sms to remove authenicator. And since this apparently isnt obvious, make it so you need email and auth to change sms, and sms and auth to change email. 
---
If you lose auth, sms, email, then ur not locked out for 7 days. This works for email compromises which anyone who browses reddit knows this is not uncommon. But we still need to have auth delay to prevent people losing items from recovery.

you could summarize their argument as "if we hide poll results, the polls we want to succeed might fail". This is why they need to be hidden.

Yeah. Let's see how the second half of the week goes before we go *too* overboard with praise

Yeah, seeing the poll results made it literally impossible for people to vote. /s

you lack CRITICAL information if you think blizzard gives a flying fuck about its playerbase lmfao.

Do we really want to add useful rewards to unenjoyable minigames? I’d rather an attempt to revamp how the dead monogamies play, rather than slap on new rewards as a bandaid. Maybe the games culture nowadays will never enjoy minigames just for the fun of it though idk

---
Would be very interesting to see though.
---
I don't think the problem with adding stealing creation is that they don't have a good lore reason to add it. The problem is fundamental to minigames, which is that if it doesn't have a bis reward it won't ever get played and is therefore a waste of dev time. Bis rewards won't pass a poll, and non-bis rewards aren't worth getting so nobody will play it. This problem needs to be solved for minigames on a fundamental level before any minigame is actually worth playing.
---
Muscle memory for pkers I assume. High level pkers can click straight to the special attack box without looking as they know where it should be.
---
Again, I think I have told you about your non-expertise. If you honestly, 100% think that these are the only ways to gather information then you should not talk about the subject.
---
I went and looked at a few other of your posts, and not shockingly, you just say the same dumb shit over and over again without actually thinking about the content. I want to be totally honest here: You know next to nothing about the subject. Stop talking about it as if you do. 
---
Getting phished requires putting information into a system yourself, I don't use any of the information(name or pw) on any other account, for anything. However I got hacked, phishing is the laziest(and thus first, and only option for the uninformed) explanation with the least amount of supporting evidence.
---
It would be significantly slower.
---
🦀 Guys I'm scared that they're going to fix everything because then the crab rave memes will stop and I'm not sure I'm emotionally ready for that 🦀
---
That's because we have very clear evidence that minigames without bis rewards don't get played. See castle wars 2007 vs 2019 lol.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀 Authenticator delay is the real update we need don’t be distracted🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
I know you said you're being sarcastic but the main complaint about seeing polling results was that people would see something was either passing or not passing by a large margin and feeling like their vote wouldn't make a difference at that point. With results hidden that excuse is now gone and people that are going to vote will do so without feeling insignificant or unneeded.
---
🦀🦀WHERE ARE YOUR CRABS?🦀🦀

Chill bro thats how frames going to eat this week..plus hes license renewal you know he cant ok without it

Petition to put out a poll asking whether or not to hide poll results and hide the results.

If they disabled your bank pin, then you entered it in a fake Runescape website or have a rat on your PC.  Bank pin has a removal delay, unless the hacker knows your pin.

Unenjoyable is subject. I find a lot of them fun to play, but that doesn't last long because there is no incentive to play them for rewards.

Jagex listened to Reddit and their fucking crabs.   But did not consult what the actual player base wanted (actually they did and it failed a poll). I think the Reddit scientists failed to realize what jagex said in their newspost when they were spamming their fucking crabs.

Pretty much that.

But you can also watch a 1-99 guide by seerz or theoatrics. They go thigh different methods in detail and talk about good quests or activities to do for stating levels. Just check that they don’t reward defense xp, obviously.

that's not possible...

I created a 500x500 pixel canvas and used the grid tool, made the grid 500x500px with 50x50px boxes, then made it live paint, which allows me to paint bucket the individual squares. Then when I’m done I ungroup the paint from the grid and “expand” the live paint which allows me to delete the grid and move the final piece around and resize it etc.

I think part of the problem is people confuse "looking 2007" and "looking 2004". I know a lot of people love the old Dragons and demons models, but by 2007 we already had the new ones. 2007 was a weird transition state where things were getting updated, but not everything had yet.

You're making too many mistakes and getting hit by things you shouldn't be getting hit by. If you have plenty of prayer potions left, it might be good for you to just kill the safespotted meleers before the magers so you don't take damage on accident.
---
How dare you! It is not a waste. It is *lottery ticket* for something entirely useless but slightly expensive. Dark totems in bank are also easy stack for clues if you are some day doing pet hunt.

The Reddit community is obviously split on it, but if all the newer players start voting, it could totally pass. Hard to say, especially with all the polling changes.

Oh I know. I've done that, the only things I cant remember are passwords, or they may not even have records back then or they've been changed so many times by the hijacker.

Well rip everyone’s pures again when this update goes live
---
If you take a stats class that discusses polls and surveys hiding the results until the end is like one of the first rules they discuss in minimizing bias. With results hidden until the end it feels like every vote is more important and the community won’t be swayed by checking the results on the Reddit beforehand
---
Nice logical fallacy there bud

As far as multi zones. Would you want no multi whatsoever or no pvp multi, and still allow pve multi for cannon or bursting? 
---
And what about wildy? Would getting rid of multi zones not disrupt balance? Making it much easier to escape from rev cave for example?
---
Did you immediately go back to try and open another chest before going off and doing other things?
---
B2b does mean back to back, and its common to squeeze one more trip in after getting an item in hopes for a b2b drop. If you left to go do other things before opening chest 2, then you did not go for b2b. Your comment above makes me think you did though.

thank you jagex feelsgood
---
Hmmm....
---
It would seem you don’t even understand splashing *is* missing an attack, the same as range and melee missing an attack. You roll for your chance to hit 0 - max hit, or you “miss” the attack. For magic, missing *is* splashing, and then you can still hit 0 - max on a “hit” roll. 
---
Magic doesn’t have 3 possibilities where you can splash, Miss, and hit 0 - max as separate events.
---
You’re taking about range weapons that then further evolve with different ammo types. Use your example but with bronze bolts, and suddenly the RCB has *far lower DPS than the D Longsword. 
---
Of course it outperforms the D Long with the highest damaging bolts for ammo, in the game lol. 
---
Have you ever tried to range someone wearing barrows armour? Guaranteed you’ll change your tune the first time you do. Because you’ll be teleporting out of the fight within about a minute, and your opponent will still have a nearly full inventory. 
---
Most melee weapons don’t degrade, whereas range ammo is *exclusively consumable*, with the best ammo costing as much as a few thousand gold PER BOLT. It’s not cost effective in any sense in comparison, what are you on???
---
Melee Spec weapons can hit 60+ to as much as high 70s... not sure what point you’re trying to make there.
---
You’re not ever permanently frozen. If you aren’t even going to bother entertaining using melee, when plenty of better pkers than you can tribrid nh, why are you so frustrated that you using two combat styles is too predictable or lame?? I guess I just don’t understand what your problem is, or what you want done about it???
---
With all due respect, you’re being very narrow-minded while not being very good at communicating your point, and further, it seems *you don’t even understand basic RuneScape combat mechanics...*
---
Yet somehow I’m out of my depth? That’s rich lol.

If your appeal is insta denied you have for sure no way of getting it back. The threshold to make it through the automated review process is insanely low.

I’ve seen multiple in game. One time by accident I hid all public chat and thought I was muted because when I said something no one responded and it didn’t show up in chat. The only person I could talk to was a mod in game and could see their response in chat and appear above them. Boy did I feel foolish when I realized why this was happening.

That'd be the point of adding requirements, it doesn't have to be exclusive. For example, if you have 500 KC in PvP and 500 KC in ToB, you'd be eligible to vote in both PvP and PvM polls. This would also deter people that spam poll booths on alts, so that way you couldn't have 3 low level alts attempting to change poll content that they're nowhere close to doing on that account.
---
They could also turn it into a monthly activity thing, so if you haven't been doing PvP lately you couldn't vote in PvP polls (and vice versa) to help combat the spite voting that's currently happening (rather than just walking up to a poll booth and voting no, they'd have to spend a decent amount of time PvPing before voting no to a PvP poll). Granted this wouldn't be the easiest thing to track, but it would be possible.

---
"Look out guys, we know you've been wanting this for years but we don't know what the result will be, you might actually get content in game that people want."
---
what is the crab meme 🦀🦀
---
What would the visual indicator look like on the cades in question #2?
---
Dungeoneering but balanced.
---
I've done it 3 separate times on 3 seperate characters all with 55 agility and I've never failed the underground area. I don't get across the 12x12 tiles everytime because that's random, but 55 agility is more then enough to do Underground pass without failing.
---
I've done it THREE TIMES NOW.
---
&gt; When you have a piece of content that is so bad a large number that players would rather pay multiple hours worth of gp so they dont have to play that content its simply bad content.
---
I think that is relying too much on assumption. In general, the Minigame is not bad content; it is the team that makes it good or bad. So it is the fault of the players more than the minigame's design itself. And players don't always pay because they think it is bad; in fact, the majority of players don't boost it.
---
Players will boost anything whether it is good or bad content; whether it is to make it easier on themselves (e.g. restricted account), because they can afford to and are lazy, or other factors. For example, you can get boosts in Raids if you wanted and if they had untradeable rewards, you bet it would be more popular than BA. But just because not everyone is a fan of BA, or team content in general, is not a reason to kill it.
---
Congratulations! :)
---
For BA it is, because the only reason to wear one would be a +1 max hit, in a minigame where you already deal tons of damage with msbi+void setup
---
We need a bow staff
---
It's certainly a fair point, and I agree, its massively complex and hard to create a user centric system. Fun fact, I'm actually a game dev, haha.  
---
In terms of onboarding players, I agree and that having a choice like this early on is rather off-putting by not being able to understand its context. I also agree that anything which hinders engagement to the poll system, which they are trying to promote is a big no-no. I also agree in that questions will sit in the grey-area void.  
---
My concerns just lie in how Jagex will attempt to put players into specific player groups, and wanted to start a conversation about it. :)

Yeah I understand your take, but I just know there will be salty bois who get PK’d at revs, and don’t understand how the wilderness works, so they identify at pvp just to sabotage the polls. I’m sure there are tons of petty people who would do that :/. 
---
I personally don’t pvp so I usually ignore pvp questions or just pick whatever I think a pvp player would want. 
---
At the end of the day, it’s a democracy. You’ll never have 100% of people happy, but something does need to be done to make it more balanced.

Would you be able to get the unlimited lyre for free with Fremennik elite diary then? I know it's probably an obvious answer but I just want to be sure. All of this looks good to me except allowing saplings in the seed bank. It's already pretty convenient to be able to store ALL of your seeds so conveniently and allowing any sapling to be stored just feels overkill. It's a seed bank, not a sapling bank.

Are you some kind of elitist or something?

P.s there are technically no 10 year vets of OSRS.

Quest requirements, maybe other skill requirements, maybe like the Ents where you use woodcutting, but make it a high req and the only way to get loot. Could do similar with other things like mining, untradable herblore potions, etc.

if you enjoy the game enough and money isn't an issue, why not. worth is subjective.

Did you download runelite from anywhere other than the official runelite web site, those have infected computers before, also are you running wine to open your client, or from the .appimage?

Why are you comparing the two when a toxic sotd requires a magic fang for its upgrade where as a staff of light uses a sara light which is very inexpensive. Staff of light is fine where it is. It allows you to auto cast sara strike and it counts as a sara/zammy item for godwars. Its perfectly fine where it is.

So if i hate pvp i can make my acc pvp and just vote no. All skilling and pvm updates pass already. 
---
I think pvp updates all fall under game balance and shouldnt be polled. Just discussed to make sure they dont break shit. Like if u polled to make 1 def people hit half as much, it would be close to passing. Rune pures were already the most dominate style and people voted to make heavy ballista 33 def or above only, further tipping the scales. Same with augury and rigour. It wouldnt break any game balance if 1 def or 40 def could use, and now we just made 70 def builds stronger. Its dumb af polling this stuff.

You have no way of knowing this, and even if it's true it doesn't matter. The goal of hiding the poll results is so that people that do vote aren't influenced by the current standings, not to get more people to vote
---
What's this honky all aboot
---
It’s actually level 86.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
Why is this good?
---
Probably because it's the slowest skill to train. I'm annoyed by it because of that, and because it has one of the highest elite diary reqs. I'd have the diary cape if it weren't for that unboostable 93 slayer &gt;\_&gt;

There are plenty of cases where collector should be shooting eggs, at all levels of play. Anything from "other roles aren't shooting my eggs so I will" to speed runs where coll will shoot cannon on 6-8/10 waves

No you can't, but if someone runs up saying "hey my spot" I don't argue cause I know they most likely just left for a second. I respect other players in this game and will just give a spot back.

Plus people suck at crashing spots, I think I've won every timentime someone tried to spot crash me at crabs or gem mines

Multiple of the same brother killed does not impact unique chances. Game checks ”brother killed? Yes/no” and rolls loot accordingly

why does no one play? No one wants to spend all the game prayer flicking, it is anti fun.  So if u want anyone to actually play this game mode, worry more about "FUN" then skill.

Smart move, it will last forever.

Fishing trawler also isn’t the only way to acquire them; you can get mantas and turtles from drift net fishing and purchasing bowls of fish in fossil island. Maybe that’ll get some more attention as a result which is nice I think :)

The hardest thing here then would be that there would be WAY too many unique entities if each individual set of bones had a unique ID like this. One of the issues with our current system is the limited number of unique entities the system can handle, based on an old mod post.

Fair enough didn’t think about that. Thank you for edumacating me
---
I would say so, was totally unaware of this. I knew drift net fishing was a thing but didn’t know the fish you got. What are the bowls of fish? Is that with the mermaid tears?
---
Should significantly buff the points given so players can suffer for a less period of time.
---
Yep, purchased with the tears from the agility/thieving activity
---
The ending + quest areas
---
I was there for a short slay task. Most of the task was aggro
---
I’m opposite of you, put off my quest grind for more slayer once I saw the hydra pet + helm recolor. Got my helm recolor ~160 kill in. Now just need to stockpile more points for skips to get the glorious hydra again. Also the chance at DHL sounds suuuuper juicy haha.

Bad bot
---
My take on this is that there should? be so much more to Runescape then just combat, both versions of RS suffer from this with RS3 currently having the additional combat focused related skills.
---
In comparison there are overall more skills have considerably less depth compared to combat related skills.
---
In a way I feel that Runescape in general has a bit of a identity crisis of what it wants to be (when we see many players with skiller accounts vs standard all rounders).
---
Anything combat related probably relates to the players the most since its what most games offer these days - some kind of combat in a form with end game features to keep players interested.
---
If we split all the skills into subsets we have 7? combat related fields and then 16 non combat fields yet combat has the most content by far.
---
Obviously content focus goes where the majority wants it to go which is why we see it that way, but I totally understand why the more non combat orientated have a certain "distaste" towards combat focused players.

From the wiki: Players will always get one dense essence block every nine ticks, regardless of the used pickaxe. Having a high Mining level is advantageous when mining the essence; The higher their level, the slower it depletes.
---
If I had to guess though, I would imagine that the run energy saved maybe be more valuable than a +3 mining boost every 5 minutes.
---
No because your authentication would be paired with that app, if they don't have your phone they couldn't access your account. Right now they don't need your phone because they can just remove authentication from the website.

If you are learning to pk try f2p. Get 30 range 20 attk and like 25 str and try out that short bow to 2h switch. Get rlly good at it. Then do 40 att 40 str and max ur range lvl for your cb using a combat calc. After that do mems with 50 attk and str with a magic short bow. Just keep slowly leaving up as you progress pking. Eventually getting 44 pray for prot prayers. Also when you go mem you can try using all 3 combat styles.

I wana be optimistic but all I see is changes for everything other than pvp, once again it seems like Jagex just wana sit around taking about it &gt;.&lt;

Jagex will be monitoring statistics as always and will make own conclusions out of this on the long run.

FYI your username is in your Runelite bar.

I am also confused with this question. Will players need 800 of each type or just one?

I had the idea of attaching it to the zamorakian hasta to give it more of a crush bonus and potentially a +1, (equalling?) the bludgeon.

Or attaching it the bludgeon for a +1. "Hydraulic Bludgeon" kinda has a nice name to it.

most recent pet drop stats show its 2nd or 3rd most common pvm pet for number per day

If you get lured because you spam clicked through the popups that said warning you are about to be pked then idk what to tell you. The ditch is an eyesore has been since it was added, something new osrs players clearly dont understand.
---
Even though it's speculation, I'm quite convinced your explanation is  at least part of the reason indeed. I just think it's a bit weird that it seems to happen so much more in OSRS guides compared to other games' guides, but I guess that's just how it it. 
---
Guess I'll stick to the wiki instead of Youtube guides then.
---
Fair enough. My bad. Hard to tell when people here are joking because it's a pretty common occurance for someone to actually have that mindset. Sorry friend.
---
well I mean they chose to play as an ironman, they should be fine with that...
---
&gt;IMO it should be reworked in general.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Being able to sit at 1 prayer point for 15 mins by manipulating ticks is an obvious exploit.  Not that I think it's that important to remove, because I've made use of it, but it absolutely doesn't make sense as a "mechanic"

Nothing to stop you chucking smite on for your first hit or two on people to stop them sitting on one prayer point
---
Awww, the pikachu mousepad and the pokemon stickers
---
Ah you could hammer those out in no time! And so far DS2 is my all time favorite. Thanks and good luck to you as well!
---
The area is over-crowded regardless of the nerf and the fact that Konar was nerfed shouldn't stop the developers from making an area of their game more playable for everyone- especially when the proposed change doesn't have any potential to harm the game.  As an ironman though, it is quite frustrating losing 20% of my kills to players who barely damage my demon because of the poor drop mechanic where ironmen won't get the loot if another player "helps" at all.
---
Ik hoop dat OP die muismat nog steeds heeft.
---
I would honestly rather have 2FA on the website login. Then you'd only be able to log in and remove the authenticator if you had access to it in the first place. IMO a much better solution than simple removal delay.
---
If your main goal is to make the gold for a bond within 7 days, I would rush the requirements to [collect Mort Myre Fungus](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Collecting_mort_myre_fungi). It shouldn't take very long, and you'll be able to make &gt;600k gp/hr. You don't need any of the skill requirements for fairy tale part 2, so don't stress about that.
---
Getting money with this won't help you train any skills and it's pretty boring. BUT you'll now always have a way to quickly make money for a bond.
---
Good luck and have fun enjoying being a member!
---
It's a basic rule of bias. Someone that sees a poll (anywhere, not just in osrs) that has a large majority one way or the other is generally influenced to vote with that majority. This is especially true if the voter was not sure of their vote beforehand/does not feel strongly about the question.
---
Your oof is to get gold, dont lie
---
So don't do wildy tasks? Are you 75 combat? Konar is decent and makes you some alright money with the brimstone keys.
---
😛
---
Where??? It's not in the poll booths?? Also seems shitty to lower the 75% margin to get the result you want but I understand that 75 is high.

Yeah he runs all while this guy is 1 hit from death. Also he acknowledges that hes not praying and in the panic doesn't put up prayer
---
Ok cool I’ll give that a try too, although I don’t understand what you mean, what does the b neck so which prevents getting pkd??
---
Remember that you can also do tithe farm at level 76 iirc farming which gives 90k xp/h. Click intensive as hell though and barely costs anything.
---
But those cost money which a new player doesn't have?
---
Early in the game you are going to have to walk a lot of places. But as you progress you will unlock various means of travel.
---
Their bullshit reasoning has been dismantled in the comments
---
wildy course.... just do it no1 pks there really and if they do they're rangers. bring a dds with you and everyone will leave you alone

Most games allow you to have more than one character under the same membership

TLDR: Context for each poll should be supplied. If it’s a major community change like this it should be visible.
---
If it’s an in game change hiding poll results until AFTER is okay BUT poll results must always be displayed at the end of the poll.

Lmao. Never did any of that

viggoras chainmace is a wilderness weapon. it gives a 50% damage and accuracy boost in the wilderness when charged with 1000 rev ether(which is ALWAYS lost on death, even if the mace is protected). it's not that obby prevents risk, it's that you can use it outside the wilderness so you don't have to risk your ether
---
Upon opening a bank, if you click the looting bag (Which should be highlighted yellow), you can view it and then store the items. Iirc, there's a quick-deposit feature.
---
Literally my thoughts.. It'd probably be even easier to add Auth to login to website than to add the delay, too.
---
What's up with the first two lines? Legit clueless
---
&gt;who?
---
The people the parent comment was referring to don’t act dumb.
---
&gt;Not true, your votes have to go through the (3rd party) client first
---
Holy shit that doesnt have anything to do with what I said. The point is Jagex literally codes the poll system, chooses the polls, codes the poll interface. If they wanted they could make it show a natural growth to a outcome they state ahead of time. Yes this would be debunked by any 3rd party client recording votes. Yes it would also be debunked even with it hidden. Hidden poll results don’t help jjagex in manipulating polls because 3rd party clients can record votes regardless. If everyone votes no on something and Jagex says “it said yes!” How does hidden poll results help that. Third party clients can still go “uh, literally no one voted yes on that”.
---
What makes this even more retarded to me is you say lastly that third party clients can count them regardless. That’s the fucking point. The same way you could catch Jagex “cheating” the polls with them visible, you can catch them cheating the polls if they are hidden.
---
Dutch meme
---
Next time with 1 pray
---
is it though?
---
no other 2fa service has a delay, that point was very accurate.
---
The ONLY reason we need auth delay is because the recovery system is exploitable and because there's no protection for phished accounts.
---
It's just easier to ask for bandaid fix (auth delay) than to ask jagex to fix their recovery system, or add protections for accounts when they're accessed illegitimately
---
That’s what they all say friend. Did you have an Authenticator?
---
As others have said, I have a mouse that works in my phone but OSRS doesn't support it.

You don't need a whole lot of money to get some basic teleports. It's about 50k for all the dragonstone jewelry, 1k for a games necklace and ring of dueling. ~300-500 per teleport tab. You can easily make that from chaos druids, mining, smithing, slayer, fletching, fishing, or farming early on.

I hear people in the thread taking about Warding, didn't that already get voted on? I wasn't playing much back when the idea was introduced. Has it not been voted on, or are they putting it to a vote again? Also, what *seems* to be the general consensus on it? I like the idea, but I'm undecided on the whole new skill thing in general
---
The problem is a lot of ppl dont give a shit about voting and/or arent honest, i dont vote on questions about content i cant/wont be able to do for a long time.
---
Nope, yep, you're right. Runescape is infallible, their deadman tournament was all the players fault, and there has never been any registered events of banks disappearing or entire characters being reset.
---
I was just fuckin around.
---
I wasn't aware that being able to see an interface clearly was considered easy and low skill. Shame on me for not realizing I could misclick my seed before a farm run and get pked in level 50 wilderness all within the farming guild and thereby deincrease my xp rate to a new meta and turn the whole game into rs3 in the process. Crazy how that works

The game is not "oldschool" anymore, and it hasn't been since 2013. It's RS2 that conserves the nostalgia of 2007 but also builds upon the game.

That's because nobody actually enjoys minigames, in rs3 or 07. People think they do, but then they play 2 games of castle wars and never come back. The only reason people afk spotlighted minigames is for the thaler (minigames currency), and not because they enjoy the minigames.

They acknowledge the growing community in the blog, stating despite the community growing substantially, LESS people are voting now, becuase they see all yes and say eh well its gunna pass anyway.
---
 And one question that gets blasted with no's and everyone scrolling through the list of questions sees theres no chance of recovery for that question once again just skips the poll entirely.
---
Hiding the results will have no negative effects besides potentially one or 2 updates not coming in the game that would have passed due to half the community not voting at all.

Ah damn, i never did any tick manipulation prior  but seemed to get it (not perfect but pretty close.).

Keeping it alive? I had a cat that died over 10 years ago and I have a picture of it
---
Tbh in a perfect world all warding content would just be an extension to runecraft.
---
I mean objectively runecraft is a terribly broken skill and lore wise would work perfectly as magic’s fletching / smithing.
---
But that will never happen because of masochist players + nostalgia.
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Bruno, Wolf, Tide, Sween, Gambit.
---
2.  Announcements.
---
  *  New Clue steps and rewards coming this week, easter coming soon, Deadman re-run coming and being looked at! Check respective blogs/announcements.
---
3.  Thank you for voting and supporting us winning the BAFTA EE mobile game of the year!
---
  *  Cheers!
---
4. Hiding poll results?
---
  *  Yeah, done. See the update newspost. Polls will be closed temporarily tomorrow (webpage will also be invisible until after poll closes). Aiming for Friday for the first poll with hidden results. The issues that players bringing up are being addressed! Player support are looking to release a blog toward the end of the month, we're looking at Toxicity, DMM is being paused until we're happy with it, we're having players in the office discussing PVP and issues there. 
---
5. The range and melee ghosts at Cerberus look similar, could you update then to be a bit more different?
---
  *  Yeah we can do that, we did something for that in the past but would hope to make it so that people can tell the difference.
---
6. Could we get a Peace Treaty as a reward for completing Song of the Elves? You could show it to your slayer master to get them to stop assigning elves as a slayer task. It doesn't make much sense to be a friend of the elves yet still slaughter them by the hundreds. Or just make it an unlockable perk with slayer points upon completion of the quest.
---
  *  Maybe? Would rather make it so that there's like a duel or something where you don't end up slaughtering the elves but you still have to engage in combat. Perhaps there could be a different tier of Elves. Not keen to simply remove from the task list.
---
7. Will the mimic fight's mechanics be looked at to better represent the concept of a mimic thematically? As it was previewed, it is opt in and has the player choose to enter the fight. Traditionally, mimics catch greedy adventurers off guard, but are easily distinguished from regular cheats if you're attentive enough. Perhaps it could have an examine text or slightly different icon than regular caskets. Master clues have dangerous ambushes anyways and with a way to tell them apart, it falls on the player to not get caught by one. This fits the fantasy of a movie perfectly.
---
  *  We did investigate this but felt that forcing this upon players that might not be higher level could be a bit unfair or seem unfair - and nerfing the clues/boss wouldn't be fair to the nature of Elite/Master clues. The second (and bigger) reason is that we weren't comfortable adding a teleport of this nature into the game - teleporting from anywhere and then to reappear somewhere else and this is tied in with instances and the mimic's mechanics of losing a reward if you teleport or leave the fight. This could just add a lot of complexity for no real gain. 
---
8. In the Hosidius rework, the bank seems to have moved away quite a bit from the catacombs exit, making it a considerable nerf to gp/hr of the dust devils down there. Could you maybe add a deposit box by the entrance so we can at least bank our loot?
---
  *  No we're going to change it, Dust Devils are already quite good slayer/magic AND gp which isn't completely intended. We're going to change it and if a few 100k drop/hour then that's how it'll be.
---
9. Back in 2008 or so, a feature was added to RS that after a level up would let you click the skill guide of a skill to see what you unlocked with the new level. This was very useful when training combat or doing other activities where you'd miss the lvl up message in the chat box. Could we get this in osrs?
---
  *  Don't mind it yeah, that would be nice. Would require a full rewrite of our level up system, ED started working on it but essentially it would be a big job for little payoff. Perhaps a good update for new mobile players. Maybe could have a message in chat box? It's being held off for now.
---
10. Since the moss giant boss is one of two f2p bosses it seems strange that it does not drop any f2p items. It logically doesn't make sense for a f2p boss to not drop a unique item in f2p. Are there any plans to make an update to it's drop table to fulfill the consistent boss theme that bosses drop uniques?
---
  *  It was polled but not entirely sure why it failed. If anyone has any suggestions then we're happy to investigate! West: As both bosses are weak to mage maybe it could drop something that ties into warding to make some unique armour? 
---
11. Any expansions or update to Zogres in the future?
---
  *  Maybe? We're always happy to look at questlines and content but a lot of players want other things. We're currently finishing Elves but would like to ask players down the line to see what people want quest we want to look into. West: Would love to add a few new undead bosses that could tie into Warding too! Zogre undead? Things to use crumble undead on too!? 
---
12. Can cutting fish from Barbarian fishing be automated like it is from Aerial fishing?
---
  *  It could be but players don't get a lot from it anyway? Not sure if this is one of the things that we're looking to automate. 
---
13. There was a post a month or two ago about a middle ground item between the anti-dragon shield and the dragonfire shield. Are you still interested in implementing this item?
---
  *  Maybe? Just not sure where it would fit in... F2P can't kill dragons and it doesn't seem to have an exact use? Open to hearing why and how this would be used.
---
14. Can you please allow skillcapes on Entrana, would be nice to use the Farming perk.
---
  *  Don't really want to sorry. 
---
15. Can we get a little icon that indicates when a friend or clan chat user is on mobile?
---
  *  It requires work from people that aren't on the content team. Don't know if it would allow people to get exploited in some way? Could be a bit better to improve the chat function if it's not working for players.
---
16. Can the shades in the last level of the stronghold of security, give normal EXP rates?
---
  *  We could make it have regular EXP, this is because they used to be random events. Easily possible if the players want it. West: Could also buff Gadderhammer to make it better DPS than some other things against shades.
---
17. Could the dragon hasta be buffed for use against dragons? Currently the leaf-bladed sword is a better choice if you don't have a Zamorakian Spear or Abyssal Dagger.
---
  *  Does it need to be better? Not everything is made to be useful. It may be that leaf-bladed sword is strong for it's level rather than the hasta being weak? 
---
18. Will you add a toggle to rotate the screen on mobile?
---
  *  We wanted to make one interface that works well and is designed properly. Players seem to use their own software to rotate things like that so should we? It would also require a lot of redesign in interfaces etc, probably a lot of work for a minority gain. 
---
19. Will OSRS mobile be made compatible with a normal computer mouse?
---
  *  Probably not, we can't do that content-side. Aside from this perhaps another device like a laptop or tablet could work better?
---
20. Can you give demonic gorillas a PJ timer of sorts? It seems like every time one goes off me for a second when it goes to melee and gets stuck behind something another one attacks me and I lose my kill.
---
  *  Perhaps more so the pathing rather than PJ timer. Sween positions his character so that it can melee if that happens. Wolf: Think it has some sort of mechanic like that built in anyway, will look into that one.
---
[Continued below!]

Disclaimer: This will literally auto-ignore any message that contains the word "doubling", starts with the word "Player" or even contains "&lt;number&gt; usd" (I think this one has the wrong regex), and some others. So you might not see a message from a mate or something. Use with care.
---
21. When can we expect a Bounty Hunter rework as promised back in late 2018? So far, BH received some QoL changes but seems to have been placed far back in the backlog.
---
  *  We are keen to get the design ready and shown off and get it in game. We are currently revisiting the way that PVP content gets introduced and how/when things should be changed. Until we know HOW we can change the way things are introduced we aren't able to offer the BH changes as they'll probably not make it into game.
---
22. Spiritual Creature slayer assignments are unlocked after completing Death Plateau which doesn't make sense since you can't get into the GWD after Death Plateau. Can this be changed to partial completion of Troll Stronghold? Maybe after defeating Dad, Since that's what you need to do to get into the GWD.
---
  *  Wolf: Sure you can actually access it after Death Plateau. It's not as easy as after Troll Stronghold but definitely possible. Not looking to change this sorry. We'll look into that after the stream!
---
23. What are the chances of having moss giants given an extension for slayer tasks. And also having other slayer masters assign them? I understand they are not technically slayer monsters but I enjoyed getting them as tasks so I could get mossy keys and even at a high slayer level I wish I could do them as a task.
---
 * Bruno: You might enjoy them but most others probably won't so wouldn't be keen to add them to the task list. --- Sween: What about as a general Giant extension? That could be a nice middle-ground.
---
24. Is Mod West intending to slowly rework the general layout of all the Zeah houses after the Hosidius rework is released? I think Shayzien and Piscarilius needs some attention in terms of layout and identity.
---
  *  Definitely with Shayzien. The tents are huge, lots of graves etc and there's a table upstairs? Maybe if we were going to look into that area we could look at other mechanics like the thieving thing that was a bug earlier. West: Have a plan already for Lovakin and Arceuus - would like to look at the others too! Please send through any suggestions to West on twitter :) 
---
25. If we move a room downstairs in our POH, can the rooms between be filled in inbetween? 
---
  *  Don't know, it's not hugely easy. Bit of a question for Ash sorry.
---
26. On the collection log for the clues can you make gilded and 3rd age into a separate category as it's essentially impossible to complete hard, elite, master section because of this. 
---
  *  It could be done but not really looking to change that no. We did mention at the start that the collection log was never designed as a completionist log. Though if it's a small change that would improve the game for a niche group of players then why not? Would be nice to ask Mod Lenny to see his thoughts.
---
27. When you do the Hosidius house rework, will you also take a look at the Mess hall? As it is right now there's lots of room for improvement. You can only take out 1, 5, 10 or 50 items, or take X. You have to manually change X to 14 if you're making stews. Why not have the game either remember what value you had X be, like banks do?
---
  *  That's NOT currently in the Hosidius rework. But it's a small enough change that we could look at offering this as a generic change separately. 
---
28. Stats to Champions cape?
---
  *  No it was only added as a cosmetic cape, not looking to give it stats or make a Max version. 
---
29. Use for extra spirit tree seeds? Useless after 99 farming, potentially to skip contracts in the farming guild? 
---
  *  It feels bad to have an item that becomes useless at a certain point. Could consider it after we rework farming contracts anyway.
---
30. Can you allow Duradel to assign Hydra tasks?
---
  *  Not keen, Kieren previously mentioned something on this. Seems to be a Konar specific thing, not really looking to take away from Konar in that way.
---
31. Fix Thammarons Sceptre?
---
  *  You say fix it but doing so could make it pretty Overpowered.
---
32. Mythic Max cape an option?
---
  *  There's a case for it, would like to see it.
---
33. Theatre of Blood Metamorphosis?
---
  *  Would have to look at how many people have the pet before doing it, to see if it's justified spending time making.
---
34. Hydra tail?
---
  *  We left that one, were looking at an alternative reward like Bone Whip but didn't go ahead. Open to making the bonecrusher necklace better in some way. 
---
35. Jar drop rate at Skotizo?
---
  *  Up to the players but open to changing it.
---
36. Group Ironmen?
---
  *  No updates at this stage sorry. Needs more work, engine, content focus etc.
---
37. The best in slot necklace, Torture comes from Demonic Gorillas which is easier to obtain rather than Bonecrusher so why shouldn't it be changed or updated?
---
  *  Wolf: Not a fan of changing it. Like the dragon Hasta, not everything needs to be Best in Slot. It has a niche and is fine to not be the best and have it's own spot.
---
38. Firelighters on Phoenix pet?
---
  *  Like the idea (no real discussion further).
---
Sadly people might unironically say this next year
---
Hopefully Zammy will protect them from their 29% interest.
---
I'm cancer and I play grey helmet man mode, what is wrong with me...?
---
If you dont want to be useful than why stay around?
---
What other god is there to follow other then the one and only.
---
Just bought T7 from a ranked, 10/10 Tyvm
---
I fought amenity sometime last year. He completely outclassed me. If I were to fight him again though with all the practice and techniques that I've gained throughout this time, id still get whooped.
---
I'm dying from this comment section. You guys are great.

Boomhauer I can't understand a word you're saying. It must be the echo of the cave.

But it's just the price I pay ($11)
---
You should tweet at Mod Ash about it.
---
Apologies it's quite long this week, I try to avoid walls of text and to summarise questions but some questions just can't be cut down without losing a lot of context (same with answers). 
---
Plus we got through a good number of questions this week with lots of discussion 38 questions/answers!.
---
No. They try to complete the trade and hope you don't realize you didn't take out your items. So they offer stuff worth less than 60m (here's your prize, a fury!), or tell you their friend in falador has the items and put up a fally teletab
---
If you're in a hurry you might just accept and give them the 60m.
---
Mobile power 📱🤙
---
Lol they could fabricate either way
---
Giving us capes in Barb Assault would be cool.
---
But there's other things that would be better:
---
- Let us 4man barbarian assault. This would help combat leavers without penalizing people whose internet disconnects. For some, this could also be a fun challenge.
---
- Give the healer a right click or left click heal option on teammates. It's such a crucial role to be able to do well, especially in latter waves. Level 1 healing at late waves is really messy when you have to use the vial on teammates constantly. Shouldn't be something hindered by interface clicking. Would help facilitate 4man runs.
---
- Make "multi-killing" runners as defender consistent... as far as I know, whether or not the saw can actually multi-kill runners is RNG or based on some weird tick mechanic that nobody knows.
---
- More importantly, it'd be nice if runners felt more responsive to dropped food. It often feels like they pause for way too long before noticing food, or run away from food and seem like they didn't notice it, before turning around for it again after you thought it had gone way out of range, and sometimes it just notices the right food immediately. Runners should favor most recently dropped food.
---
Still no authenticator delay.
---
No other device?
---
This is factually false. Google uses a 3-5 day delay (try this for yourself if you do not believe me) when accessing a Google account without the authenticator. An email gets sent to the backup email with a link to click if the person had not tried to access the account.
---
Please update yourself on this one.
---
In a similar fashion to the plank make question, could super heat ore also work like that?
---
Wtih?
---
Probably an RS3 player. Chevy Camaros are P2W.
---
So it's like a circlejerk thing?
---
It’s more about a meme about increasing the price while decreasing the quality of service. 
---
Plus alts are basically necessary to play and enjoy the game.
---
Although I agree 11$ is more than worth it to play rs, still Jagex is making record profits and still pays their staff shit, doesn’t have adequate QA or customer support, and manages to break the game once a month. Therefore a price increase seems unfair.
---
We already have numbers.  Accounts that are hacked aren’t by brute forcing a password.
---
My argument remains. Case sensitive passwords will not enhance security.
---
Ooooo that’s a great idea :)
---
A first impression is powerful
---
Haven't played Runescape in over 10 years and I see a landscape full of crabs. EXPLAIN YOURSELVES

Up to the front page!

ooo thats a great idea!   I will join!

What was the update? :o

I was looking for this. I watched the videos on YouTube and couldn’t find them again and forgot the name. Thx

He looks like most OSRS players tbh
---
nice!
---
I use his guides a lot :)

I remember using this same model also, a Pacard Bell
