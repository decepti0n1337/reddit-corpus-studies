Lol, I guess you completely missed all thw comments with guy going "I'm maxed pvm god with an infernal and 5b bank!"
---

---
The fact is that he said Skilling resources shouldn't come from pvm, but he has no problem farming raids which give Skilling resources. Why are you on my ass?
---
---
---
Because you can't stockpile 4k birdhouses. Also I never said that what he did wasn't okay but I do think there's a difference between stockpiling supplies and trying to instantly get massive piles of each of the new seeds. 
---
At least tele to Varrock not Lumbridge. 
---
Not sure that's a good way to look at things. I'm pretty sure that mentality- not criticizing Jagex even where the criticism is admittedly valid in favor of "looking on the bright side"- played a big part in bringing MTX to their current level in RS3.
---
Besides, even when it's just about QA or design or something, it's always worth pointing out the room for improvement. No doubt some people are going way the hell beyond that and posting rage quit threads or ignoring all the good the OSRS team's done, but those people just need to calm down, not shut up, and I don't think think calling them out like this is going to work.

I think she might actually assign Lizardmen in Molch, which is the temple, those might allow Shamans.

Still crying I see?

It says "Players may not sell, share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else"

I like the idea behind things like  brimhaven agility, werewolf course and gnomeball, where it should be more effort for more xp.

In practice it's still just shit rates and you don't get millions from marks of grace

Sure. But someone put it all on a spreadsheet with ge tracker prices and it came to a 51% nerf overall last I looked at it.  
---
But that's not what matters. What matters is that there's no longer the chance of that big drop from doing her tasks. Which kind of ruins the fun, and people play games for fun. The fact that its only a 0.96% chance is more of a reason to not nerf it. Especially since it's only a small portion of the community that will be doing her tasks in a week.

Imagine playing osrs in 2019 for enjoyment. Disgusting 
---
Not really, because already thousands of people aren't doing it from when I last checked. You'd get the 100-200 herbs naturally from slayer anyway in that same time frame, especially ranarrs which have retained their price despite so many slayers. Also hundreds if not thousands do Vorkath and Zulrah efficiently, yet the profit from those bosses dont tend to dramatically dip... 
---
Because RS combat is flawed and wasn’t designed with exciting pvp in mind. So people make up implicit rules to make it more exciting (no safing, etc.)
---

---
Oh I've bumped into him in the wild before
---
They are already planning on doing something in the same vein as this. Not sure how I feel about the pre-pay thing; seems a bit weird. But otherwise, it sounds like a decent system. Personally, I think their proposed system with the fee waived if you get there in 2 minutes and an NPC to collect your items for 4x the cost or such would work fine too. I'm also fine with keeping current double death mechanics; the 4x NPC would be the safe reclaim option if you were afraid of a double death (or just too lazy to run back).
---
Understandable, even if I don't especially agree.
---
I'm thinking something like... you get exp based on the tier of artisan task you take, and then you go do that thing, get rewarded based on the skill, and turning in the artisan task gives artisan exp.
---
So for example, farming contracts. You'd just get it from the artisan dude, and when you turn it in you get artisan exp+seed box. 
---
Or a Hunter box would be like, hunt 100 red chins, then you turn it in and get a random impling+artisan exp.
---
That's just the sort of thing I'm picturing Artisan as now/what I'd want it to be.
---
Good. Bolts have been stupidly expensive for forever. There's a reason everybody just uses broad bolts, it's cause time bolts are way too much for regular Slayer use. 
---
This is the home teleport spell, not the lumbridge one ☺️
---
One death automatically makes you inferior, change my view.
---
hope this isnt another 12k dry pet for you :P 
---
Just don’t suck!
---
People selling gear to buy new items. Alot of people playing bringing in more item drops, which doesn't directly correlate to gold coming into the market.
---
The whole diary except the celastrus tree can be done in an hour or two.
---
I don't really actually play - when you kill someone like this, can't someone just come up to you and murder you while you're picking their shit up?
---
It takes a while to kill them with max melee. *If* it is at all doable with your stats, it will be horrendously slow. The loot isn’t great either. You would probably be better off skipping them. 
---
It’s possible to recover it without access to the email address? And if I do recover it it’ll remove the Authenticator?

So it has to do with the seed box, that makes sense with my experience with it. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aei10v/the_kebos_lowlands/edpeyiq/
---
I posted this like an hour after release. I'm constantly buying mole parts normally for spirit seeds, since I don't do zulrah. Decided to hold them for a bit over a week prior to release to see if new seeds would be in them. Assumed they would since they said they'd be in nests, but also thought they could overlook these. 
---
Seems to be a bug/oversight, since the game doesn't determine the  nest contents until its opened, its not based on when you get the mole parts. So they should've been generating new nests, but it seems seed boxes still generate old nests, not new. 
---
Or they intentionally did it and plan on changing it on next update. 
---
can i order a 30% nerf please
---
Is there anything as scary as having Dharok down in the tunnels and knowing he could surprise you and 1 hit kill you at any moment?
---
Hell ye I'd fuck her

Whats 157?
---
The lack of proper context is making every guy in here feel this one in their gut.
---
tbh i would like to see changes to the drop table for new slayer master oh wait.....
---
record is 160k
---
Can confirm. 14 year old me felt like a total bad ass getting into the cook's guild back in 2001.
---
when they announced ironman idk why but i assumed they'd all be jovial community-minded players but they're like all alt-right virgins. seriously just hang out at wintertodt for 5 minutes and you'll figure out where all the "we pay no gay" degenerates went to
---
And I’m over here with just the pet at 150kc.
---
The problem with gmaul is it only gives you 1 chance of a KO per fight, which makes it really boring and RNG-heavy. With dds you get 4-5 specs per fight. The more KO chances you get, the less RNG plays a role. Even worse, many gmaulers tab soon after they gmaul spec, since they realize they have little KO potential after their spec, so if you’re using dds you can’t even get in the 4-5 specs before your opponent tabs.
---
Basically gmaul makes pking extremely boring and RNG-heavy. Removing it is necessary to make pking not so stale and 1-dimensional
---
drop chance had been removed in a previous update

r u in the dungeon under the statue in the middle of kourend? if you are youre just unlucky cuz i think its 1/200 off everything except ghosts for some reason 
---
Hm are Bots?
---
Thank you Maz for the quick response!
---
Yes back in rs2 I walked everywhere and just attacked anything on sight. I just used entangle + tb at edge, if either of those failed I consider the pk "failed" and moved on to next target.
---
I'm getting around 50% now too since the new seeds are going to normal prices. But my sheet and most others fail to factor in uniques and only use the standard table. Uniques are where the big drops should come from, not a 1% of 2M in Herbs. The current uniques aren't doing the best job at this, but they plan to revisit drop table last this week and seem interested in polling new uniques.
---
That said, her drop table was never meant to have big drops, to begin with. It was meant as a slight profit increase with some food to help you with the task. If it never had 2M herb drops, I doubt anyone would be saying it needs big drops since that was never what was mentioned or polled. I think it is fine if it is just smaller drop and no big 1M+ drops; the point is a bit more profit and more points and it does that fine.
---
Aye mate been doing as many tasks there as I can, I use a house teleport to zeah and go under the statue, am I for real just this cursed?
---
Whatever you say, you're so smart. 
---
that still does not explain where the line is, is it when you share the account? if so a lot of youtubers would be outta jobs :)
---
That rug really ties the room together.
---
F
---
They weren't really "lame," just a product of their time. The cooking guild was from a time of no grand exchange and where it was actually challenging to scrounge together 10k from selling times to general stores.
---
Defenders are fine. How much content do you really need from a guild?
---
Claw seems to be 1/1000 from other peoples’ data, leather also seems to be 1/700 so not bad rng but not the best
---
The fake country accent was a bit off putting.
---
That's pretty much perfectly how they look ingame
---
Me too. A nice rug can really tie the room together.
---
But what possible could I have said to go from no offfences dealing with language/scamming to perm?
---
Maybe its just me then. 
---
Personally I would love to see a tournament minigame in the same way that DMM ends, but with maybe 16 people? Winner wins like 2m or something. It wouldn't be an overpowered money maker. 
---
On the contrary, decreasing max HP to 80 (in pvp) and removing gmaul would make pking a lot more fun. People only camp full hp in fights because of gmaul anyway.
---
I’ll be sad for you buddy. Hounds blow 
---
I have 26M Slayer XP so I’m not bothered about efficient XP per hour at this point. Having completed 1600 tasks at Nieve and Duradel, I found Konar to be a refreshing change of scenery and seeing loot from her drop table. I wish they would change it and add some rare and useful uniques though. 
---
Usually I upvote your comments just to be the odd one out, but not sure I can with this one... Unnecessary

He gon learn to day

clueless about slayer? haha, okay mate. We're also talking about drakes here but toot your horn more pls

yeah dude youre cursed lmao, have you gotten and dark totem parts? those are same drop chance
---
Ignorants, yea.
---
I bought it a while back and haven't used it at all
---
Totem pieces are a guaranteed drop from superiors, you haven't gotten a single superior?
---
I just used 10b as an example. I have no clue how much wealth is out there. I’m sure there is a string of Mules out there who could be running bot farms and have way more than 10b.

Does anyone know what the most wealth owned by one person is?

Can someone watch the video and summarize for me please? Preferably in easily readable bite-sized paragraphs.
---
I am doing the hard farming contracts. I was asked to plant and grow a poison ivy bush, so I did that. Once grown, I then went and collected the berries and brought them back to the contract NPC. He told me I need to check the health of the bush. I went back, and the only option I had was to dig it up, so I did. The contract NPC again said I had to check the health of the bush.
---
????? What do I do
---
So like dungeoneering in Rs3?
---
Minus the combat aspect?
---
So you didn't look at a single other comment I made? Lying retard. 
---
Suprised I haven’t seen this yet. Quests are amazing med level content, not too challenging but still somewhat challenging, they can be fun too. By the time you’re done with nose you unlock amazing rewards for all levels too and you’re stats get huge exp boosts from some putting you at the end of med level.
---
That would be like trying to drink a regular strength pot and a super expecting both boosts

I would lose 20 pounds in a week if they did this.
---
He's entitled to get combat exp from the birds
---
Imagine being enough of an elitist that someone claiming they started as a regular ironman is a red flag that 'they must be a scrub'.
---
I have, indeed, died. I also started a a regular ironman.
---
To me, the purpose of a hardcore is to see how far you can get without dying. Once you die, the account has no purpose anymore and you just start over. Hence, I do not want to start as a hardcore.
---
Funnily enough, nooblet started as a regular iron as well for the same reasoning. He also did it on video, so there's proof he did it and didn't just 'start hc and died'. 
---
I stand at Lumbride and shit talk Goblins. LOL you didn’t even drop a champions scroll, noob!

I feel like I just witness a murder

---
He probably still plays but doesn't wanna get banned for rwt
---
Some kid rwt'd a bunch and then got phished, went on the news and talked about how he was hacked while his grandma talked about how much money he spent on getting gold.
---
Its called questing. You have more than enough to keep you busy, and itll help you skip half of what is considered "mid-level content"
---
Extremely vague post
---
it's kinda fun but the xp and rewards are worthless. An equitable rod doesn't do much at all, the pearls are slower than gold nuggets at mlm, and the fish sack is only cosmetic 
---
r/Unexpectednazi
---
Agreed. There doesn't feel like any point in growing fruit trees in the guild right now, given they're one of the longest things you can grow (and this pales in comparison to if they ask you to grow a fucking redwood.)
---

Public chat on? Gf account

he left after about 20 minutes of sharing 2 teak teak trees with me. He was definitely looking to crash someone. The only words spoken was "reported" by me when he killed both my birds after he logged in, and then he responded with "good".

It is suited around 1/1024.

You tell us.
---
Only reasonable way to do agility is to farm at the same time.
---
It’s a collection of drops from tons of different people with hundreds of kills
---
This is crazy
---
Keep grinding, that's what everyone else did.  There is plenty of mid level content in this game, you didn't need an over powered drop table to do slayer. 
---
i am pretty sure you can't =S
---
Mining, agility, slayer, and runecrafting are the only slow skills in this game.
---
OMG I had no idea that was a thing until I typed it! reddit never fails to surprise me. lol

What about that guy on this subreddit who offers to carry for free?

Go to downstairs in falador party room to have a closer look

...I don't see your point. You have Drakes and Wyrms for med level players who can use the Brimstone boots. You have elite diary allowing maxed chads to not wear them. Seems ok to me.

I usually start my runs around GE / edge so it’s not a far fairy ring. The patch is literally a minimap click away.

It actually is a server-wide rotation of several layouts at a set interval and it will be the same for everyone in that world if they all enter at the same time.
---
why tf you replying to month old posts?
---
This would only benefit the players who are already more than ready to become members and this update will give them a reason not to do so which would make a jsgex lose money. And the update wouldnt Even attract new players... 
---
it would be really cool if they updated all the quilds, I was just thinking about how much better the farming guild than all the other guilds.

What's the optimal way to train combats? My "main" is a 3 combat skiller but I'm not too sure if I should only train on Slayer tasks, or seek xp elsewhere first. 
---
Yeah it’s like ten years old so
---
Is there a local cc?

He could be an organoid belonging to a boy named Van.
---
I'm getting such a raging clue right now
---
With a skip function that concept is alot less relevant, though. The current system basically means you either block or skip every single Drake task. "Bad" tasks aren't typically done, only tasks with some kind of pull \[GP / XP / AFK\] tend to be done. 
---
Why?
---
Shouldn't that mean that we would have too many carrots?
---
I know many Darkscape players went to OSRS after DS got closed because they didn't like EOC and MTX (DS had neither).
---
Keep your 1 claw away from my 4 skin
---
That’s a slayer shirt nice
---
If you want to train strength then yes of course... then just sell it when your done.

True, sorry, it's an 80% chance to pickup and a 20% to break. Still means they shouldn't drop.

So many thirsty fuckboys on this. OP dont think for a second that their opinions, or even them existing, matters. They are meaningless lol
---
Why herblore?
---
Like I said, 127/128 nothing drops. And if people get bored they can go skill and get guaranteed profit from every iteration. (Obviously, that's not realistic at this point though)
---
I started on Nov 20th and play after work/on mobile during breaks. Im 1176 total already and only played RS2/3 up until then. Even getting back into the osrs groove wasnt that hard, i already have 11m and a dragon chain, fury and some other decent gear. The game isnt hard to level "quick" if you have an idea of what to do and dont fuck the dog while doing it.. [stats](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/track.php?player=Davokhiin)
---
Ok now this is epic
---
Just tell him to steal mums card
---
Surely unicorns, as fellow equines, share a horse’s enthusiasm for carrots?
---
Agreed 
---
Generally it’s best to keep strength 5-10 levels ahead of attack and for training purposes defence is only relevant for the gear it allows you to equip. 
---
Train your skills one at a time and avoid defence training unless you want to be able to equip new gear. The reason you don’t want to train defence too much or use controlled is that every level in strength or attack will increase your dps, allowing you to gain xp faster, while a level in defence has almost no impact on dps (lower defence does mean you’ll have to bank for food more often, but with how close training spots are to teleports and banks this doesn’t really matter).
---
If I was in your shoes, first I’d get 65 strength then 65 attack. This allows you to enter the warrior’s guild and start working toward the dragon defender. Then I’d get 70 strength, then 60 defence to allow you to equip the dragon defender. Then I’d just alternate between attack and strength every level all the way to 99, maybe training defence to 70 at some point for barrows equipment.
---
99 Slayer named Chad here. You should all buy a cannon, it maximises your efficiency whilst skilling and bantering.

I've been using that world a ton since it's the lowest ping 1500 world for me. Surpised I haven't heard many more jokes about it.

That building in the ranging guild looks like a dick with one nut.

Why even bother posting this? You know why you got permanently muted. Do you want the public spectacle of a J-Mod smackdown? What's the point. 
---
I make money at 64 slayer. That being said I don't cannon and do a lot of wildly tasks. 
---
Nice. I need to start paying attention to updates....
---
You can't fail that though so it's fine
---
You have to sign into runelite and the settings will stick and you can just login to your other OSRS acc. I hope that helps if I’m understanding the question :)

I don't know why, you seen the evidence that I've seen. Why wouldn't I post this - I put 100s of hours into my account, and woke up to it perm muted with no evidence.

Also would like to know best way to get 75 without dropping bank
---
I think it was just that the social aspects of it have been largely degraded. Banks as trade hubs, clueless noobs were the majority and people doing optimal skilling were a minority. Players now are largely funneled into a few specific areas and socialisation is often hosted externally. That's my experience anyway

Are they time based skills or can you sit and grind them out?

If you're tired of skilling, I think osrs isn't the game for you. Osrs may have been a fun game to go kill cows for 30 minutes for you as a kid, but that's why you never went farther than lvl 40 combat. I have been playing for 3 months now, usually anywhere from 4-10 hours a day, sometimes taking a day break. I'm still only combat 87 and total level of around 1400. Not saying you shouldn't have fun- But if the thought of skilling for a long time isn't fun for you, don't play it.

Jagex made a revamp of slayer y'all raged, ooow it's OP NeRf It NeEeEerF it second it's a fucking classical overlay that last for years which means it can't be changed. You know classic?

90% of optimal play when being a normal account is Slayer / money making method -&gt; buy Skilling supplies -&gt; get skills to desired amount for quest, Slayer Ring, etc and repeat, well knowing that you'll probably never amount to anything compared to three guys merching and getting billions in a couple minutes.

As a meme I feel like every thing I do actually matters, I'm almost to the point where I can make Glories and that feels awesome to me.

---
But we weren't really talking about maxing here, just getting everything to 60s/70s (quest reqs basically). There's a ton of content unlocked for doing so, and the time it takes is a drop in the bucket compared to maxing.
---
Lol what’s the glitch?

that will be patched soon to add a lvl check

Check your message center and post the evidence of the perm mute. Just because they perm muted without warning doesn't mean a warning was needed if what you said was bad enough.

I find wiki guides way better per quest. Much better to read a line of text than search a video for what you need.
---
As for the order... doesn't really matter that much. I looked up the xp rewards and done what I wanted a quick boost in + important stuff like rfd.
---
1.5 ticking is where it's at, tbh

but nah afk teaks aren't too bad xp-wise, definitely wouldn't put it with the other slow skills.

Getting 70 in pretty much any skill without a huge bank is still going to take like 10-20 hours for the average player.
---
I understand in RS terms that is a small investment, but in real life adult terms, finding 10-20 hours to just throw into a game that you don’t enjoy til you’ve spent those 10-20 hours on like (realistically ) 10-15 skills, with another 20ish hours on quests to unlock the stuff you actually want to do is not a “small” amount of time.
---
What slayer master should I use? I just came back about a month ago. I have 70 in all melee stats and at least 60 in range and mage. I've only just started slayer so it is level 38, and have been using Konar.
---
The issue is that he’s using long words but without correct sentence structure. The words he uses suggest at least a firm grasp of the language, yet this is completely undermined by incorrect sentence structure. His comments read like he’s not a native speaker.

Got into an argument with a guy on the subs and his defense for Konar nerf was that mid level should be harder and the game is centered around high level players.

Do swordfish till the mid to late 70s and then move to monkfsh till 82-83.  I know the wiki tells you the level they stop burning at but honestly even without the level you burn like 5 out of 1000 in zeah.

I didn’t use her before the patch so idk, but I’ve gotten 300k off 2/3 of a bloodveld challenge, so she might still be worth it

It's also the most boring. Not much is fun about 126s greenbarring with torags and overheads hitting 10s on each other for 6 minutes straight.
---
In general these updates seem to take quite a bit of time and with rogues den and hosidius’s kitchen the cooking guild would be dead content or it would make hosidius’s kitchen dead content. 
---
I’m not opposed to jagex ovehauling certain things as the post suggests but things seem to move slower than glaciers for jagex. I feel like their dev time would be spent doing better things than changing cooking.

The hydra is normally a greenish yellow, and only turns blue for one phase, and when he does it isn't the color scheme used in the gloves. So no.

It's called shadow of the storm.  Note how they gave it a cool name instead of just adding a 2.
---
any good recommendations on general gear upgrades, primarily for slayer/pvm?  I'm starting to get enough GP in my bank that I'm thinking about what I should be upgrading...
---
I have anguish, blowpipe, archers ring, verac skirt, karil top, beserker....and pretty much all the basics.   I tried a million times and failed on getting a fire cape so taking a break for that now...
---
I'm mostly training  with slayer and will probably make a push to 94 magic soon...  Just looking for general gear suggestions...that will add most bang for my buck. Something that I would actually use
---
I was thinking:
---
* dragon crossbow (brutals, wyvren, and drakes).  I use blowpipe everywhere else.
---
* dragon chain body or torags plate?   I think I just melee gargs and abby demons once I get 50k more slayer xp to get to 85?   
---
* Ring of suffering?   Would this be better than berserker or archer ring vs demonic gorillas?  I guess this might be helpful at some other places where I'm constantly praying as well or zulrah in future (never done it)
---
Thoughts?
---
I'm 107 combat with almost 90 magic, 94 range, 89 str, 77 def, 84 attack.
---
Ape Atoll or Tai Bo Wannai(sp?) Village are good, 2 ticking is done at ape atoll so most people use village to afk.
---
Zaff, Baba Yaga, and the Mage guild all sell em. Not as cheap as Zaffs discount but it does the job.
---
Upvote, smackdown, etc.
---
Just got a task to kill general graardor but I've never done it before and need a team to go with. Any one know a good place to find someone to do it with?
---
so then if the points were left the way they were for people like you why do you care? you have earned the right to get 18 points per task because youve grinded your way up. 
---
the points reduction is for people who are using konar for the drop table. since their main objective isnt points or xp but money. 
---
You can teleport with the cape when it isn't equipped though right? Most other teleports take an inventory slot so I don't see the problem besides some slight runecrafting efficiency.
---
This is real I'm in his clan chat

Who the fuck is talking about level 126s NHing? Pure/Zerk NHing is so fast paced, how can you call that boring? lol.

That would be a cool and interesting way to buff it

Sounds to me like you’re not very mid level...

regular animations make the game feel 2-3 ticks slower.

Make it actually require multiple skills? As in you need to sometimes mine, sometimes wc a part etc.

The timer is there to prevent excessive server stress from people hopping repeatedly.  A "check all the worlds" button would need to make a connection to each world and probably put a lot of load on the servers.

So it's basically down to "drawing lotteries"? Instead of having the right account build you have the same account fight the same other account (there needs to be an agreement of what can be done).
---
Did the chance to hit the konar drop table change? I just did an entire task of 159 Drakes (cbl 195) and I read that her drop table was supposed to be a 1/100 chance at cbl 100 scaling to 1/50 at cbl 350. The entire drake task I didn't get any Konar drops, also didn't get any at a Gargs task, Mt. Trolls task, and once in a full black demons task. Seems like the rates changed 
---
By far the best xp for combat in the game, very afk as well. With nmz points you buy necessary imbues to your beserker ring, archers ring, Slayer helm and salve amulet. Most players do nmz just for the imbues if they hate doing nmz.
---
You also get about 100-200k a day in herb boxs for a small amount of points.
---
Stainless *Steel*?

You can't trick me Amazon
---
I personally think they are in a fine position right now, but normally I think as games update and progress and expand they should add in better content. Usually this means something more profitable or better rewards, and more difficulty. Why add in some new creature or slayer master if they dont compare to anything thats already been out for so long. I think most people find just clicking the same thing over and over again for 20+ hours isnt very "fun" for them without some kind of end goal or reward in store for there efforts. I do think drakes are not the worst thing ever but I can understand peoples view points and I do think konar needs a little buff on her rewards, maybe not as good as release but as it stands now its just not rewarding enough compared to other things.
---
definitely worth it to protect them, they take too long to grow and don't cost that much to protect
---
Have him appeal it then, they shouldn't have banned him.

Yes! Meaning is determined by actual usage, not historical origin. Serene is committing the [etymological fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy).

Ah, that seems a tad silly then to block off all Fruit Trees until 85...
---
Yeah, this shit is way too over the top. My girlfriend doesn’t doubt me or suspect my faith at all, but even this would set off an alarm for her. I wouldn’t be comfortable if she did this with some dude either, even taking this at face value and assuming nothing happened I would not be comfortable with it with all of these things considered.

Can we make lvl 20 slayer 5m gp/h?

There were like 400 pure ess bots per world lol
---
I think a minigame that gives just a "double xp gear" that runs out would be best. It wouldn't give xp of itself, however the time to get the gear should be slightly longer than the time it takes to run out of charges - and some extra rewards can then also be given like asorted runes, or maybe even a "full combo rune"? (combo rune that is every elemental rune combined).
---
Dunked on

I always punch other players rats when I can. Its great watching them log out.

I don't think that any extra seed storage is necessary at all. If bank space is an issue, stop keeping piles of random junk.

In edge pking or pvp worlds, you can tele if you disagree with the terms of the fight. You can't enforce rules in deep wildy.

It matches the electric water that surrounds wyrms, which looks great imo. Lance also has some of that electric blue color in it as well. I personally like it, but get why some people wouldn't. Just make the gloves into actual gloves jamflex.

Does anything help protect against drakes' fire breath, like insulated boots at rune dragons? These seem like they could be in an okay spot if not for the high attention required. I imagine it would be public knowledge already if something like antifire protection worked against it, so that's probably not worth using.

Even if that was necessary, which it isn't since the fish give more than enough fish chunks + the fact that it's basically as fast if not faster than dropping fish, it's still only something that's usable for aerial fishing.

If you don't enjoy the grind to 70, then RS probably isn't the game for you honestly.. there are hundreds of games out there intended for quick play without a large time investment. The beauty of this game is that it is a meritocracy and you get rewarded proportionally to the effort you put in. Additionally, there is plenty of content at nearly all levels that you can do.

I too, would really like to find this. Sounds very useful for players who are just getting back into the game like me. Players who are mid to high level but still are using the world map, or wiki guides to find npc’s and finding our way around. It helps me to have a view of the area and characters to be able to remember them in the game world.

TLDR: yes, this sounds useful

If price isn’t an issue, there’s only a few negligible downsides with upgrading it. IMO the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Also, I believe you keep the crush bonuses. 
---
1. You lose all defensive bonuses provided by the Hasta
---
2. You lose the +2 prayer bonus
---
3. You lose +5 strength bonus
---
4. No special attack

5. Dragon Hunter Lance doesn’t count as a Zammy item at GWD (not 100% on this one yet)

You might wanna try switching up the monsters then. Questing unlocks some better options. If you can keep your coffers full in your kingdom and get herbs you can keep your prayer pots full, at least that’s what I did on my main. Farm runs help a ton too. I think it’s 33 to farm ranarrs

Where is tureal

Yes but romeo and juliet is also one of the first f2p quests released from back in the day when there weren't many quest points

I'm a btw. So I dont see it much. I'll have to look.

Took me 4 kills. The grind is tough man.

I got a head around 80 kc, did desert elite and not my slayer helm, rip.
---
My question was if RFD was the last quest he didn't do. Because if not, then doing the rest is fun and useful goal.

Former Pornstar here (male btw). It's almost impossible to strictly be friends with the opposite sex. Deep down, the thirst calls for every man.

lol. Zerkers are the ones that risk. the pures is the ones that sit in 30k gear.

I would suggest a barrier of some sort. Either a light barrier or roots of some sort would be cool.

Thank you!! I agree ☺️

zerker pure is short for berserker helmet (45 defence) pure.

I feel like every other person i run into at teak trees by Castle Wars. Ill be like sup, they say sup, i say something else, five mins later i get a "sup" again, i question if its a bot, five mins later "sup", ok youre a bot, couple mins later it logs/switches worlds as im assuming the person running the acc notices im calling it out. Happened several times that same way lol

No it's to be prepared for different scenarios. Notice the d scim for slashing away prot prayers?
---
Moral of the story: don’t do easy contracts until 85 farming. 
---
No, it's low level lmao. Runescape scales exponentially, not linearly, 1400 total ain't shit. That's less than 5% to max, in what game is 5% of "completing the game" (maxing isn't even everything btw) mid level? Base 40s takes 2-3 days if you don't completely fuck around. I realize the game isn't efficiency scape and not everyone is efficient, and that's fine. But that doesn't mean they're "mid level" players because they play suboptimally for a long period of time.
---
Op, please nerf

Yeah, if you play rumble you can customize which monsters spawn.

Max combat on RS3 with a couple other skilling 99's, 2200 something total. Each time I log on I get kindof excited to play but slowly realize how badly it was ruined with mtx and also how much I dislike the graphics. At the end of the day it doesn't have the charm that OSRS carries with it, or the playerbase for that matter.
---
I have the tattered head for the diary at 256KC, but yet to get the one I want lol. 
---
those are dm fights.... no1 wants to dm especially if its a highrisk fight. 
---
FYI if you use Quest cape (fastest way to get to the fairy ring) and have Morytania ring preset (you went there last time so you can go there via right click), it takes exactly same amount of time to get to Morytania herb patch as if you used Ectophial.
---
If you don't use QPC or don't have that ring as your last visited, it will be slower than Ectophial.
---
It’s fine and fun
---
Why would it be a red flag? People are allowed to have friends, and not everyone has an unhealthy relationship where they assume the worst of their partner :/
---
Serene has been doing this intentionally for a long time now 
---
You'd be amazed how long people wait to unlock fairy rings maybe they don't realize you don't have to finish fairy tale part 2. If you're porting to fally or draynor and taking the boat it's a hike. I do feel Zeah as a whole is a bit more spread out than it needs to be. All that said OP should go start fairy tale pt.2. 
---
Go vote for democrats more you shill
---
That crossbow perspective tho.
---
They can but then people don't fight you because it isn't fun.
---
I hope you’re ready to leave this pit in a body bag...
---
Used to be a no lifer, don't really have time for games anymore so I just browse reddit and watch the occasional stream. But he's right lol, this game is pretty shit if you can't borderline no life it at least. You're not getting anything done playing 2-3 hours a day, like at all. Fuck you might not even get a single level in a lot of skills in that amount of play time. There's way better stuff to play if you're casual, runescape really isn't one of them. It's one of the grindiest games in the world, literally.

Ya, I cringed when they said they are hiring a bunch of new j mods for osrs development. Every update is a chance at killing the game. 
---
I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion, but when you ask people why they quit RuneScape it's almost always due to one particular update whether it was the removal of the wild, summoning, dungeoneering, eoc, or the squeal of fortune.
---
With the new mobile crowd and polls being passed unanimously the down fall is coming within the next few years. We are in the golden days of osrs so enjoy it with your friends while you can.
---
There’s a 1/130,000 chance of getting the pet and he had only been playing for about 15 minutes with only 5 thieving.

AGS is 15M? LOL
---
Idiot jmods trying so hard to revive pking with their MA2 and rev caves and bullshit, and AGS (which any pker actually interested in fair 1v1 pvp will have) is still dropping like a rock. Just shows how wildy updates might bring in shit pkers, but not enough actual good pvpers.
---
I got it before
---
6.3m total xp isn't "not even bothering to play the game." If you think it is, you lack perspective
---
At one point I would of wanted this, but I kinda accepted this is a different osrs nowdays. Kinda lazy and don't want it as much now. I'm a bitch and if I die it's just an ordeal. Ezscape weakened my want to work again.
---
I did a lot of magic levels there stun alching o  the Zombies below, I believe it's one of the best places to do that due to the large number of zombies there
---
which one would you like to see
---
Buy rigour. Use blowpipe+BGS until you get a little more money then buy a DHCB. 
---
Runelite plugin
---
if it weren't for all the hype 2006scape youtube mock-ups, Jamflex probably wouldn't have even considered releasing osrs
---
and I heard they were only able to release osrs because they lucked out and found a single backup of rs2 from 2007

That’s jagex-quality QA for you.

the message obviously. that hasnt been linked yet
---
I will never understand this mindset ever.
---
Ive never gotten a hespori from a contract after around 15 or so. However i got one from a tree and one from an herb. Do runs everyday too :/
---
Aw, nice to hear, thank you 
---
used to be the only immersive game that could run on the cheapest of computer hardware
---
these days it's all moved to moba's like league, pubg, and now fortnite
---
I use prayer to kill ahrim and Kharil... sometimes dharock too depending on rng.
---
Then I safe spot the other brothers. If you do it right you don’t need prayer pots and use one or two food for  a single run. Teleport out to clan wars to recharge prayer and run. Mort legs 3 or barrows tab to go back quickly.
---
If you get ahrim, kharil, or dharock you will probably have to prayer dose in the catacombs.
---
This covers the safe spot :

I think something like yews are occupying west bank would have been better (maybe lots of yew logs on the ground etc)
---
What the other guy said but get void (elite ideally) and salve ei too. They are by far the most optimal
---
There is like 1 or 2 skills in osrs that are faster than their rs3 counter part. There is nowhere near ''a lot of'' faster methods on osrs.

All chaps are assless otherwise they would be pants

I expect to die to autisms risking 1m+ bank for 50k loot. I would WISH that special pkers didnt jerk themselves off to 50k loot while im just trying to get quick slayer points.
---
It's certainly not med game or end game. It's more or less a waste to develop content for such a short stage of the game where such a high amount of content already exists, wouldn't you agree?
---
Dude i honestly just had to keep trying over and over since the bis i could get was granite hammer (not enough money for dwh).  Rng blessed me one time though. Along with the monkeys, it was just sit and pray that neive would keep aggroing the next one
---
Thanks, I was afraid I had to go back through the underground pass! 
---
LOL same here, how embarrassing
---
Go farm abby demons in slayer tower a bit. There are people running bot farms with accounts that have 100m+ combat stats. Easy to spot, they usually wear guthans.
---
Honestly you could do karambwans at hosidius of you've done the quest. They were the most profitable and I did them from 30-99 in a week
---
You might have got an emblem drop, or maybe you accidentally brought your whole stack of arrows or tele tabs. Pkers are always going to kill you
---
I also did this for my first 99. It’s a grind but definitely a great one to have done! If you get bored at mother load, give blast mining a try. Doesn’t take too long to unlock. Good luck!
---
Sir, we need you to be more specific.
---
You can 100% melee him if you don’t want to buy rigor or invent in DHCB(its price is fluctuating lately). He’s easy to melee, just watch a guide. 
---
92 cmb got a bottomless bucket :), whipped it to death.
---
This map bug been around since beta.... pisssssssses me off.
---
That's a terrible idea, if I have 99 range and 1 attack, and strength my drops will be trash.
---
This is really really good, keep up the great work! 
---
Tbh, RS3 as an ironman with legacy combat, sounds amazing to me. Ive always wamted to start a char

Can we just watch the news story. I don’t need this taints shitty commentary every 3 seconds. 
---
but matching tattoos...?

I'd get a dragon hunter lance if it would actually buy in GE

A cooking mini game in the style of overcooked would be pretty cool for the cooks guild

But then you have to wait 30 minutes between uses.

Never crossed my mind i dont like cannons, i dont use them i dont think of them, shit i dont even like looking at them

So you're saying he isn't friendzoned?
---
Yeah, I do not know when the community got so cancerous. I mean I played since 2006, and I feel that it is worse than it was back then. The sad part is, everyone should be more grown up seeing that the average OSRS age is probably around 23-24ish, I would guess.
---
What's special about Zeah kitchen?
---
Dust +law = home tele with 2 runes
---

---
I only wield runite arrows smithed by one of the most renowed blacksmiths of Gielinor, using the finest runite hand mined from the icy peaks of the Wilderness and smelted directly from the dragonfire of Vorkath. The arrowshafts are fletched out of redwood imported directly from the healthiest redwood tree in all of Zeah and the arrows are weighted specifically from the feathers of self hunted Chompies.

I refused to see it and trained there anyway

Mole, KBD, and some wildy bosses are are pretty mid level. I was duoing DKs today with a mid level player and we had no issues.

Hi GraeboSqueezy!
---
I too dont want skillers to have good content available.
---
What's your Slayer level?
---
Which are they? Fm ??
---
This isn’t for a convention, this is specifically doing it just to do it. There was no special occasion. That’s sketchy.
---
dont worry about it :P
---
One thing nice about releases like Kebos is that we do see a wider range of content. In general, they've been getting better at having their big updates cover more than just the one big thing. Like how Raids 1 was pretty much just Raids 1 and some new Shaman spots but Raids 2 came with a mid-level quest, swamp crabs, and some other little things.
---
That said, Kebos brought a lot more mid-level content than most updates with the Farming Guild, new Slayer Creatures, new Slayer Master, Diary, 2 Quests, and Aerial Fishing that would all at least partially fall in the Mid-Level Range. I wouldn't expect Song of the Elves to come with much mid-level content, but hopefully, we continue to see it sprinkled in future updates.
---
and here i am 1550 chests without an ahrims top
---
ee I don't think you're doing it right.
---
Look at it from outside a numbers-only perspective. Instead of grinding out one thing for hours, a player can play an (hopefully fun) activity for a while and make up the lower xp/hr with an 'increased xp' reward.
---
Even if the xp/hr is about the same, the player likely had more fun doing 2 different activities instead of just repeating one task.
---
Oh I agree, I think that there's a ton of underlying engine work and infrastructure work that would be necessary to hire for in order to keep up with the growing player base. I dont want more than 3 or 4 big updates a year but would absolutely support them hiring engineers to make their engine more configurable and their infrastructure more reliable 
---
Sometimes, but that's why I included the second picture to show the email was that was used after clicking said title. 
---
I mean if you got your switches down good enough, you could melee him with the crossbow bolts so pitter patter
---
Don't remember exactly. Not long iirc. Maybe 45 minutes?
---
I would definitely recommend just going straight for 100%. It doesn't take long at all.
---
Although if we die we lose more than just status
---
WoW classic is being built backwards, I wonder how that'll turn out
---
To be fair, I play this game paying little to no attention to chat, often even having the chat off or minimized, you can’t just call people bots cause they take time to answer.. 
---
There are plenty of tasks in this gave which doesn’t require full focus at all. 
---
While I agree bots are a problem, I think it’s pretty ignorant to assume people are bots, just because they don’t answer you. People can be on mobile, have chat off or just be anti social..
---
zerker refers to having 45 def so u can where berzerker helm..

Few things I've seen new mobile players confused about:
---
Yes, your account is reset. OSRS is technically a new game. All your stats and items and stuff is in RS3.
---
Mobile and desktop are completely the same game. It uses the same servers and worlds and everything. 
---
Yes on the herb runs but not quite sure what you mean by "are farm runs the best xp"
---
Just get 99. Ez pz. 
---
Pick it up! Never know if you're gonna DC or make a mistake and die
---
Yeah thats nice, my point is its annoying to attack an already damaged monster, second. No, if i have 160 kills left till level and hit odd health monsters it changes the original number i started on. So if i switch styles and i need to kill 160 hell hounds and i even it out with 160 kills to my next def lev then i should finish task and lev the same time. In this case my numbers will be off and i wont get the satifaction of completing task with a def lev. So imnot complaining about nothing this is a valid point.

Guides were also way worse back then, and sites like runehq and sals took fucking forever to load.
---
Yes. It's the only way to get to 5% favor. After that you can start making and turning in fertilizer. 
---
You can't really complain about a lack of mid-level content if you reject all the mid-level content they add. Farming Guild starts at 45; that is fairly low level. If you can't access it now then make it goal to work towards. The lower tier Diaries are a bit lacking in rewards, but a free blessing and bonus fish is still something. There is more Slayer Creatures than just the Hydra with the lowest being 44 and a big improvement over your other Lizard task option. Novice quests may not be amazing, but they do give new teleports (Diary does too) which would help with that whole Zeah being a bitch to get to complaint. And the Slayer Master does have other incentives besides the Dragon Hasta; it offers more variety, higher points, and added profit. And there is also Aerial Fishing...
---
Your best bet in my opinion is to raid, either CoX or ToB. If you’re looking at high level bossing like Vork or Zulrah, even if they’re 5m gp/hr, that’s still &gt;220 hours of grinding.
---
With raids, you have the chance of getting lucky with a tbow or a scythe. Even if you don’t, having consistent unique will put you ahead of bossing. Personally I’d recommend ToB because you can do it with just a blowpipe, trident, and tent whip. Either way you’ll need to bring your stats up
---
Congrats on the graceful outfit

Some people stay 2-5 def some go 10, 13, 20, 25, 40, 42 or 45 def. 20 and 25 mostly for pure clanning. There are builds woth 30-39 def but as most pure clans have 25 def cap its rare to see the other buillds.
---
Dumb fuck holy shit
---
That is what i mean, I didnt make the post saying "I'm 100% innocent, unmute me now or riot" I'm just asking for someone to tell me what I did. I honestly believe it is when I tried to sell rune pouches at the GE, and I know I got reports for scamming because people are unaware that you can buy a rune pouch from another player.

Hope you didnt turn in those gloves, you cant get more then 3 at a time. If you roll another glove/torch it turns into a magic/yew seed instead

2008scape was when I played most. Old account was created summer '06 but I was stuck on a whitelisted browser with parents smart enough to not write down the password so couldn't get much time in. Finally managed to talk them into whitelisting RS and getting membership right before HD came out.

I'd like to be able to target the hespori seed because so far I've gotten 1 and I've already killed it without getting another.

Yeah, I mean they told me to appeal on twitter. I do not know what I even did to appeal lol.

Farming contracts are ready.

Yes. That it is.

Had to do some math, I was 11-13 in my prime of fun on runescape, I’m 22 now, so I’d say my prime was around then as well! I didn’t even skill much a lot of the time and was always f2p back then, I swear I did clan wars more than anything
---
Don't they run ads on F2P? I haven't been f2p since 2004, I remember there being ads. 
---
Construction isnt super broken for these. You always see people "abusing" the events for level 90+ on a fresh account, but it is considerably slower than training normally so these people have just wasted hours doing something not fun.

When you buy it does it come filled?

Do you think the grease just magically disappears? What do you think all that shit on the tray is? You think if you ran your finger down it, it would be nice and clean?

Get rune cbow, black d hide (or void if you have that) and just go camp kurasks with broad bolts for a few hours.  Pretty much no cost. You'll get maybe 1-2m. That will give you something to work with.

No, the purpose of PKing is to kill the other player. Creating a chance for another player to kill you is a made up rule everyone in BH abides by but in a real fight, like in deep Wildy, PKing isn't chance, it's skill and soon enough eating won't matter because someone usually runs out of food.

His name is Ghostmane, he does some heavy metal and some rap music.

Feel free to judge me
---
He said "enjoy" because it was a quote from the guys post. 
---
I agree with what you said though. I was at houses at least half the time I was logged in back in the day.
---
I got 99 hunter getting 2m exp/hr on rs3, on osrs I don’t even get 1/4 of that.
---
He meant the target had a lot of hp, so they could take a larger number of damage. However, that isn’t how it works in pvp. You can hit someone for a number over their remaining hit points, whereas in pvm you cannot
---
Does this also include Banana Trees?
---
And as the herb patch is unlocked at 65, also Guam, Tarromin and Toadflax? Oh and acorns? 
---
Amazed this has only just been noticed. 
---
If you pray range you don’t need the extra defense

Fun fact:

A few varieties of wild bananas include bubblegum pink bananas with fuzzy skins, green-and-white striped bananas with pulp the color of orange sherbet, and bananas that taste like strawberries when they're cooked.

2 magic shorts and 2 magic longs was my worst, couldn't even be mad because it looked so clean xd

On a positive note, in that old darkscape, people did get t90 gear in legacy combat only. You could totally tackle MOST of the endgame on legacy. Endgame being QBD, BM, ROTS, Vorago, Arrax, ect. Idk about the new content like solak, telos, and elite dungeons tho.

They seem pretty rare. I got like 25 from like 70ish slayer when i started doing anything i could in kourend up until 87 slayer.

Nobody thought like this when they were selling cow hides in al kharid bank back in 05 and that was probably the most anyone enjoyed the game.

Nice

Any fruit tree contract is locked behind 85 farm. Regular trees and herbs are locked behind 65. Without 85 farm you're basically gambling your ability to continue doing contracts every time you take one.

Can I have a go with your bird?

You won't receive points until after you fifth task, also forgot to mention that Mysterious Emblems are like 130k, you might be able to get 1 or 2 per task.

Very constructive. Have you tried walking from one interesting thing to another in Zeah? Despite all the content, Zeah still feels mostly empty, especially in Arceuus and Hosidius. Long straight wide roads don't help either.
---
It really shouldn't take as long to get from the Arceuus teleport to a bank as walking from Lumbridge to the bank in Al Kharid. 
---
If you think it's a good thing that it's so spread out, please explain because I currently feel that it isn't.
---
It *would* devalue it, as dhcb’s price is set this high cause of being bis at vorkath the cashcow. If you make lance bis here, dhcb loses its use in the game.

Contracts in the Cooking guild would be a great fit. Bake X-amount of pies, pizzas, ect and turn them in.

Could cook for varrock, with higher level contracts making banquets for the castle.

Been doing barrows for the past two weeks nonstop to get the money to gear for zulrah, my stats are 77hp 71 atk 76 str 71 def 77 mage 74 range and 70 pray. I only use a pray dose when I have dharok ahrim or Karil in the tunnels, I do about 3-5 minute runs. The way I do my runs are dharok first which you pray melee, then Karil pray ranged, then ahrim pray mage, then I go verac, Torag and guthan I tank the last 3 brothers only need to bring like 7 food and I only usually use 1-4 max. Upgrade your Ibans get an occult necklace Seers ring and book of darkness with this you will rarely splash and kill them way faster and barely ever use a pray pot.
---
You fell for a phishing stream in 2019?

It's not unusual at all to kill someone in deep wild by simply outlasting them. Hybrid/tribridding in edge is lame as fuck imo

Thanks for rubbing your cool new pet in my face :(

Totally the same...I keep trying but it’s just missing something to keep me playing. The mining and smithing was fun to do the other day though 
---
230 kill task 3 whips
---
Rough... check the slayer masters give you tasks based on your combat level. 
---
Definitely skip it. Either use points or you can use Turael in Burthorpe to give you an easier task but it will reset your slayer assignment streak
---
Or bury
---
I was just thinking about you, we havent forgotten you. :) 
---
No mtx on ironman
---
Oh no your shitty pure account
---
Also, in RS3, you can't use MTX such as Treasure Hunter while playing Ironman mode. They won't even give you keys or tempt you with it unless it is on accident.
---
Ahh the web browser days. They don't run adds on a downloaded client these days

Dragon throwing axes are priced at like 5k each on the loot tracker but they only sell for 1.2k ea so that throws it off a bit as that's like 30% of the profit
---
Agility isn’t horrible because you can easily focus on something else since you’re literally just clicking. 
---
Runecrafting is horrid since it’s pretty click intensive (currently running lavas) and you have to focus nearly all of your attention on it. 
---
Yea okay mate if you're talking about PVP world NH where everyone just combo eats everytime they're hit off pray and teles the second they get worked below 60 HP, of course no one dies. But remove the ability to tele so getting hits off pray is worth something beyond setting up a 85+ damage spec combo, and people will die within 1 or 2 freezes if they can't get their prays right or freeze the enemy. 
---
Absolutely not. I can’t stand playing the game without a bunch of money.
---
I never said it was, but this is the first time I've seen them try to do this. 
---
vorkaths dragonfire hits through anti-fire shield so you need the super anti-fire potion to negate it 100%  
---
Bastion adds a little protection from his mage attacks also
---
I remember we were exicted about 40k........
---
If you look on the wiki for the specific monster it’ll show konar’s table and chance for that specific monster.
---
For example 
---
Wyrm (Lvl 99) has a 1/100.2 chance
---
Bloodveld (Lvl 76) has a 1/215.2 chance
---
Kalphite worker (Lvl 28) has a 1 /1136.8 chance
---
Man. Id like to try a RS3 server where everyone starts fresh and all MTX except bonds is removed. I honestly still believe that underneath all the bullshit MTX and the community that think they are some superior beings because they are maxed, a good experience exists. Dosent even need to remove the ezscape, just the MTX and make everyone start level. However thats probably the absolutely most unviable version of Runescape they could make economically.
---
Got the right name for it

what hand motion and who is ice

Lucky you

I’d love a later version of pre EoC solely for the graphical update. I hope and pray for OSRS with modern graphics. 
---
Rain makes corn
---
Deep...but I totally agree. The sense of accomplishment feels so much lower and worthless. Like I’m so close to a few 99s on there but I just don’t have that urge and excitement, everyone and their mother is maxed and it turns me off 
---
Right by the bankers too, smh 
---
Seriously the only reason I play OSRS is for DMM. If Jagex ever put DS back I'd play it in a heartbeat. Maybe one day a game like it will come out, until then it's DMM for me...
---
Okay but that is not necessarily "normal ass behavior". Matching tattoos aren't all that common, especially outside of a relationship.
---
I'm a very jealous person, so I feel that op is bullshitting us. But I'm also trying to work on not being jealous, so I can see how some people could do something along these lines and not have it be sexually motivated.
---
With that being said, the fact that it is such a grandeous gesture altogether is what really begs the question if it belongs. No? If it works for them without adultery, good on em', I wish I was not a jealous hoe so that wouldn't bug me x)
---
You can make 3.4M in like 4 hours? You either play very inefficient or not much.
---
Not right next to eachother, but not twice as spaced out as the rest of the game.
---
But you seem to agree that it's empty. The fact that it was supposed to be filled in doesn't change the fact that it currently isn't.
---

It's only listed as a medical condition so it can be covered under insurance due to laws already in place surrounding insurance.

---
Slayer died with Hanneman and Lombardo. They haven't made a good album in over 32 years. 
---
And theres no reason a slayer tshirt at a concert should cost $50
---
Took about 6k to get from bronze to dragon 
---
This isn't entirely true - you can still purchase things like legendary pets from Solomon's General Store (mtx) which have significant in game benefits
---
None of the shops sell cosmics though, and it took me awhile to get into the magic guild. When I eventually did, I realized laws/nats there are fkin expensive lol.
---
Not exactly sure what you mean, but if you’re talking about being self sufficient for membership, it may be a lot of work at first, but it’s definitely doable.
---
It is very weird. Also, you can make them tradeable again by dying to someone in the wild. I just tried it. [https://i.imgur.com/vggeHOa.png](https://i.imgur.com/vggeHOa.png)
---
So they either forgot about Erdan or they forgot about the pvp part.
---
You’re not forced, just don’t do them.
---
I'd like to say grind out the varrock medium, while it can be annoying being able to tele quickly to GE with a stackable teleport is such a nice thing, and theres the free money from staffs.
---
buy gold
---
They 100% do give an advantage though. I haven't played in a while but I'm pretty sure there were paid pets that would bank shit for you or alch for you and on top of that the xp or bonus xp mtx were also slimy. If the game didn't give any paid advantages I'm sure I could get over the combat and actually enjoy the game but unfortunately that is not the case.
---
Not spending $1000 to get good gear back

Can take the account and sell it though

Traveling is a bit far, matching tattoos can be argued imo though, idk. They're tattoos about the game. 
---
Ah , RoT the clan that started out nad spent most of its time as a bunch of troll kids 1 iteming in the wildly. That pay to use someone else botnet to DDOS people in DMM. 
---
Respect
---
depression
---
I agree completely. The drops don't necessarily need to be buffed, but some draw/incentive would be nice, be it xp or ease or superiors to switch it up. Not sure why the new slayer monsters didn't get a superior, though I shudder to think how hard they'd be to kill.
---
true, but that is only for one of the 4 gods. Op is right imo that it devalues blessings when used for something other than GWD.
---
Yeah, but most of those are mining rune as f2p because it's the best moneymaker they have right now. And it's also semi-afk, so not much talking.
---
Idk, I met someone on Xbox, and traveled over 2k miles to meet them and we've actually met up about 4-5 times and our families are pretty tight. No matching tattoos though lol. 
---
My Old cat Dex, who passed away last year, looked exactly like your boy zeke, brings back memories of him :/
---
Yeah no. Your dhc  is gonna crash. The buff is coming either you like it or not. Enough rangescape.
---
It is very weird. Also, you can make them tradeable, just have a friend kill you in pvp. I just tried it on my friend and I can confirm that it does work.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/vggeHOa.png](https://i.imgur.com/vggeHOa.png)
---
So either Jagex forgot about Erdan, or they forgot about the way it works in pvp. I'm inclinded to believe that they forgot about Erdan since that's what the poll said.
---
Will do on next task, thanks :)
---
Ok, but he gonna get chunky real quick.
---
I just returned playing again having a blast! I started playing during the 3rd month of runescape classic and stopped playing once I started getting into wow. But now that I’m back. Wow.... this game has evolved into something else. I love it!
---
It doesn't need a buff, being the BIS weapon at the best AFK money making methods in the game is pretty huge. Jagex would be crazy to buff it.
---
Isn't blessed d'hide better than void range gear for zulrah these days? d'hide / ahrim switch or void / ahrim switch these days guys? Thanks!
---
Ofc the only people with pets have low kc, for everyone that has a pet already there are 10 others without one but usually you dont hear about them
---
Okay, I'm going to assume you're doing it all wrong and just start from scratch. The brothers have 0 mage def so your best bet is to wear Pros or Guthans (that's what I use) with whatever BIS pray boosting gear you have, with your Ibans (upgrade it to 2500 charges, trust me). At your mage level, your prayer longevity is mostly based on the rng of your hits, but at around 75 mage if you're quick enough you should be able to kill all 6 without any pots at all. 
---
Example: I wear Guthans, Trident, Ardy Cloak, D Boots, Barrows Gloves, Torture, Blessing, and Ring of Dueling with a 4 slot Range switch for Ahrim (Karils T/B, Blowpipe and Avas). I kill the brothers based on my need to pray against them, which should always be (Dharok&gt;Guthan&gt;Karil&gt;Ahrim&gt;Torag&gt;Verac). I usually kill Dharok, Guthan and Karil by the time my pray is drained, and then by that point the remaining 3 I don't really need to pray against based on how quickly I can kill them. Guthans is a huge help in the tunnels cause you don't need to bring food or a melee switch in your inv since you're wearing it the whole time.
---
Barrows is more about your DPS than your pray, the faster you can kill them, the less reliant on pray you'll be. Get 75 mage and upgrade to a Trident, your max hit won't be as high but the DPS is much better. Hope any of this helped. Best of luck.
---
Im just goin off what I [know](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/afne4f/comment/ee0j5bo?st=JQVPRHWQ&amp;sh=14354a15) 
---
These are absolutely contradictory statements. The issue is that the tier limitation is 85, but the level limit is 45. If the contract is based on level, then we have the problem. 
---
random number generation, having good rng would be like getting pet at 1 killcount bad rng is a pet at 3k
---
No you only get the initial exp for checking health. 
---
bank slots, premier membership items/services, auras (loyalty points can be bought with premier), and legendary pets off the top of my head. im sure theyll add more soon.
---
or you bring a compost pot with ashes
---
Haha much harder to get when you can't even use the GE
---
Yeah I found that out when I my 2nd KC took almost twice as long haha. Need to get me a bgs
---
What's contradictory about it? Someone who is &gt;85 farming can choose to do an easy contract. If they choose to do that, they can roll an apple tree contract as they have access to the patch. If someone with 45 farming got an easy contract, they won't roll an apple tree contract since they can't access the patch. 
---
Mods? ban please.
---
Just cause we don’t conform to your mental illness and act like it’s normal we’re the weird ones?
---
Why the fuck do people watch that guy. 10 seconds in and he seems like a major cunt
---
absolute chad
---
The in-your-face mtx isn't on ironman in rs3 so it's not as noticeable, but additional bank space, action bars and presets are all locked behind a paywall &amp; legendary pet is pretty powerful (but again not really in your face).
---
Yeah don't do that.
---
Blue dragons has low requirements and can make 400k-600k p/hour
---
Hi, i think you might have misunderstood the problem - The actual patch to grow the apple tree is locked behind 85 farming - so whilst he can plant an apple tree, he can't get to the patch to do it at level 45 farming.
---
Hope this helps clear it up :)
---
What are the benefits?
---
Mod Audi

Just throw your d scim at them

1000,000,000% a cash doubler lol. Don't want the ban, don't do the scam.

1.7k dry on my btw boosted with wild pies from 80. Used about 8m in runes. It was horrible.

Just 50 pies? I bursted them and used around 200pies for 1.7k kills. Boosted from level 80.

Print screen is also op

There's a fucking Tanner there??? First 99 was crafting and I had no idea LOL
---
Eh, I've still quite enjoyed playing regular RS3. Much better for casual play and I can actually flip

How did you manage to get a rat on your pc?

Hi you misunderstood his comment. You can only get fruit tree contracts if you’re 85 farming

Nice kraken 
---
Settled does a UIM Morytania only ironman, around 4-5 episodes in at the moment and really interesting.
---
Well they would drop too frequently, or too rarely for the content to be any fun.
---
Just kick a man and get some def xp then do it if you really want to 
---
( assuming you have other untouched 99's ) 
---
I've only watched 1.5 episodes of Karamja so far so I guess I'm not a real fan but I'm just in awe lol. My normal account on this game has 900 total
---
theres new mystic?
---
No
---
thanks!
---
I'm glad it's bugged it's disgusting how many people are trying to stockpile them when they have just been released.
---
So you ask on reddit before you Google it? 
---
I just realized you can check the wiki and under every monster Konar can assign you will see DRASTICALLY different drop chances. For Wyrms the gloves are 1/110,000. Wow.
---
I only mage/range, im 81 mage 85 range (ibans and Rune crossbow).
---
Its horribly inefficient to do most of the events. If the event gives 100k summ xp/h, you could get so much more out if just doing slayer.
---
I've done a lot of raids and i also have 99 hunter so i can barehand catch them
---
I only cook em if we happen to have an axe and tinderbox due to a prior ice demon fight. Even then it's just 1-3 to heal up and get some quick points and by no means a replacement for brew making.
---
So largely useless but nice for a few bonus points if you can make some without slowing down too much
---
there are a few ways you can do that, though some of them take practice
---
* a 100bpm metronome (you won't need this after a while) and adjust by visual cues for animations you recognise
---
* runelite's prayer plugin explicitly marks where they begin and end on the quickpray icon with a scrolling line
---
* if you turn on sound effects you'll learn to recognise it from the activation sounds -- this is how i do it so that i don't have to pay attention visually, but most people find the noise too spammy. if you put protect item in your quickprays that's got a very distinctive sound that'll be the same across whatever other combinations of prays you use
---
but can you like reharvest the fruit tree?
---
Devalues my no quest, no achievements, 1 attack ironman (I wish I was kidding)
---
he's not tho
---
For exp, yes a new tree each time. If you just want the fruit it’s prob better to let it regrow, but idk why you’d just want fruit
---
sketchy
---
Negligible benefits at best.
---
Sounds like you got lucky! 3 in 125k slayer xp today. 
---
good luck with that clue scroll. i have similar stats and i’m in the middle of my first one. on my fourth step and i’ve had to spend about 15 hours skilling for requirements so far, with another 8 or so to do my current step ;-; clue scrolls are really the best motivators to skill up. 64-70 mage and range, 12-45 hunter, 50-60 mining, 46-61 crafting, and a few more all for the clue scroll so far, and i’m expecting much worse like 60 agility or 59 runecrafting for the final steps.

My favorite free way
---
Go to edgeville pull wildy lever
---
Pull ardy lever
---
Walk north-west
---
okay guess i'll replant every time
---
This comment chain is so wild i forgot what subreddit i was in.
---
Fuck.
---
I can't find that in osrs either = (
---
I got 18 rolls in 200,000 XP the day before too. The combat level of the monsters you're killing plays into the drop rate too doesn't it?
---
The ranging guild is still relatively good xp for what it is.
---
10 tasks. Easily 1.5k+
---
Boooooy this makes me feel old, finished high school 7 years ago now....
---
Any 04-05 scapers here?
---
Yeah, monsters have a different chance of hitting the kdt depending on combat level. The 1/110,000 is the chance of hitting the table AND getting the gloves. The chance of gloves on the table remains the same across all monsters.
---
I bought mine a 1.5 days ago and steadily increased the price until it bought.
---
It cost me 10m... 
---
You enter Relekka Slayer Cave from the west but then the exit is on the East and the cave is on the West. :thinking:
---
We got 2 big content updates last year. So i don't think you have to worry about that any time soon.
---
This should be an ad for mobile
---
:brainlet:
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
For the life of me I couldn't tell what it was. Thank you for this.
---
After watching it for like 10 minutes I finally gave up and figured it had something to do with the new boss.
---
Guy in my cc got 0:38
---
Immersive!
---
yeah past 70 agility I’m basically out. 
---
Yo fuck timmy and his grandma
---
Fairy Ring DKS and go into the cave to the west
---
1000,000,0,,,,,,,,0% Troll
---
Exactly its been weeks
---
agree'd, its the pinnacle of rs challenge
---
This is why you never train rc
---
I spent multiple hours getting mining and smithing up, decided to do the clues I got and apparently things like a fucking ruby amulet just aren't even sold...
---
And he'll be censored for it. As usual on this website.
---
So does Chad 
---
There's a little bit of lore too if you search the bed. Who is LO?
---
Pretty sure you're thinking of razor blades 
---
I was half joking, but how about we should start shutting the fuck up if you dont have anything useful to say.
---
Well done!
---
Even making the task a bit more chill. 
---
If I get Hellhounds, I'm not happy about it but I'll do it because its decent combat XP
---
I got no friends nor cc :(
---
But stop everytime he comes back and what he's doing on mobile should change everytime.
---
Based on what? It seems a lot more likely that several worlds are hosted on a single physical server given that groups within the same region get taken down at a time for maintainance and groups (also within the same region) would be taken down during ddos attacks. 
---
Maybe 1 physical server = 1 world in 2005 but they're bound to be using something more efficient now. 
---
A third this. I'm in BC playing on Aus servers (lowest pop) and have zero lag. Probably your connection m8
---
the game is actually good, most of you people hate it because you didn't even give it a chance
---
it juat got a mining and smithing rework and its fucking awesome
---
But then why is there a guthix one then?
---
I think it's more that people like the afk
---
Provoking and derailing with the use of this irrelevant topic indicates obsession and a narrow worldview.
---
&gt;&gt; Contracts aren't **only** based on tier, they're **also** based on the farming requirement of a plant.
---
I think that's what he meant to say
---
I don't know if it was a good idea posting this on here. All the reddit drama queens will cry for nerfs on every piece of equipment that is worn here because of a clip that produces a completely unrealistic scenario.
---
Gender &amp; sex are not the same thing. You cannot change your sex, you can change your gender. 
---
I have more of an issue with the GE than the bank, to manually change a value I have to press it, wait for it to bug out and reset and then press it again to be able to enter a value.
---
Oh these were the days 
---
did anyone ask you white boy? how about you sit down in the corner cracker jack
---
Travel to a right-leaning state.
---
Maybe an npc the has a right-click option to pass? Wouldn't be as out-of-place as a barrier and would still allow everyone through at the same time.
---
It's BIS for the new boss
---
Very well said! Happy for both of them.
---
 Cry some more idiot

awesome, thx. no slayer req for the song?

Just got my Skotos last night at 2 KC! Gratz
---
Lol I really don't get this, bis gear doesn't even break lvl 80 reqs for the most part, there's a ton of room before we need to go beyond 99. I just wish alchemical hydras actually required diverse gear and a bit of skill, this shit is so straight forward its honestly super disappointing
---
!remindme 36 hours
---
Does an album containing “all” of these exist?
---
I save spotted Venenatis at 63 combat, made enough for Chainmace then trained melee on Elder Chaos Druids and got robe pieces.
---
That's funny you mention MIA I was listening to I'm so paid and all the songs from high school for me whilst mining rune essance and got hit right in the feels cause it was like I was a kid again except I didnt have to mine it sneakily at 4 am this time lol
---
Nobody cares that you are 1. Poor 2. Dumb cry about it to someone you pay (:
---
If you rack up enough friend-zone frequent flier miles, do they let you be the pilot? Asking for a friend...I mean asking your friend, for me.
---
Grinding is like that. Slow and boring. When you kill the monsters really fast, you just move onto another monster with higher hp. There's no "exciting" way.
---
Yeah I get it that it’s up to me, but I feel like I have to do it to get the most of my time? But it eats into my enjoyment...it’s the xp addiction 
---
Can you do something about the thammaron's sceptre? You haven't talked about it on stream in over a month and the price is tanking because no one knows if it will get buffed or not
---
What was the revamp?
---
no u
---
konar was perhaps overnerfed. can we unlock bosses for konar and also unlock "truly random" konar drops?
---
Zenytes are pretty much the best bang for your buck out of all upgrades in the game
---
Arma crossbow with red dhide? Nice drawing tho 
---
You can every 3 hours or so, fruit grows back once/30 minutes. You do get picking experience for it, but it's a tiny amount compared to replanting for an extra health check.
---
No idea. I just planted my first run this morning.
---
It drops untradable seeds that you can plant and gives bonuses for 3.5 days until they die. One increases crop yield, one increases growth speed, and I think the other lowers disease chance. He's teh only way to get them.
---
He also drops the bottomless compost bucket which can hold 1000 compost 
---
Negative 50 agility xp
---
nothing is fun in runescape, EpicKekistan420
---
When do you plan on revealing Hydra Drop rates and can we get a weighting sheet for Konar :D?
---
Yes it's possible to be self sufficient, I'm not 100% sure if its doable on a iron man but if it is you just need a f2p middle account to make it self sufficient, but as a midlevel mostly f2p iron man I dont think bonds are going to be that easy to get.
---
That's pretty cool!
---
Doing a service which is considered trust-trading and a grey area, I can't imagine you responding "It's not scamming, but thank you for your concern", whenever someone calls you out.....  
---
Jagex don't benefit at all for perm muting you. But this reminds me of a recent post where someone had their user name perm changed and claimed it was done without reason, though said person had 50+ temp mutes.
---
have no idea what to do with the account
---
Follow your own advice, fam 
---
It's an elite reward, it has elite perks. 
---
Also fuck zammy. Red lil bitch boy.

already posted my bro
---
Why are they worth so much? Aren't they just a teleport?
---
Literally empty post
---
is there any plan to make torags hammers a more viable tier 70 weapon or the set viable since it was discussed and maybe even polled before
---
I've been considering extending my my collection of tattoos, mind if i nab this one? Its a pretty solid idea haha
---
I did slayer at that levels, then when a clue dropped did required quests for the clue. Leveled that way to 126. Those were more fun times than the content grind at maxed level.

You’re in the wrong house 9/10. Look up an actual guide.
---
So glad I could help out my friend, keep an eye out as this won’t be the last comment like this I make on this sub. 
---
That they don't care and will not ban you does not mean its not against the rules. In addition to this it seems likely that if anyone is going to do jad for you over the internet you paid for it. Which also makes it rwt. But hey to each their own, just seemed like this guy has no clue that its a bannable offence.
---
Does every Ironman have multiple accounts? My only account is ironman
---
Incorrect, account sharing is officially against the rules. The fact that Jagex doesn't actively enforce it doesn't mean it is allowed.
---
How the heck do you expect him to make that money per hour at blue dragons... For one, his range level is prob low, so slow kills. For two, he does not have 70 agility needed for the shortcut to blue dragons.
---
Without good money making stats, your best bet would be looting bounty hunter and pvp worlds. Or maybe even looting garbage drops from greater nechyrals that people leave behind.
---
Slayer helm pure
---
It literally picks up your drops for you and acts as a pack yak if you use a pouch on it
---
thanks, money isn't an issue just trying to get barrage asap
---
I sold the one I got last night for 6.7m
---
Yeah but they nerfed it because a few people were complaining so they introduced permits, seasons, limits by amount and size.
---
Mutually exclusive.
---
Obvious 
---
Lmao look at the dumb ironman whining again 
---
What I did was get my farming up and just do herb runs. You make passive money whilst not investing a lot of time into making money just for bonds
---
At first it was nostalgia, now it's just that it's so easily accessible. It's a game you can play and progress if you have very little time or a game you can play for 10 hours and still have loads of stuff to do. I too was a wow player from BC to WoD so I can handle the grinds lol
---
I should be studying for my pharmacology exam
---
Oops
---
This is a really stupid take on the game's future. So you want no more updates? Just a stale game? Every update is also a chance to improve the game as well.
---
see people always thought these numbers were insane, but I remember one day the servers went down back in like 2008 or so and everyone I knew shit a brick and I refreshed the homepage and for a little bit 0 players were online. I screenshotted that shit and printed that picture out showing it to my neighbor in shit like it was some unbelievable artifact of time. Like how could RUNESCAPE, THE BEST MOST POPULAR GAME IN THEWORLD EVER HAVE 0 PLAYERS ONLINE??!? Excuse me while I reminisce... 
---
I agree. 30 seems a bit much but 25% is a good middle ground. They can easily just poll 3 questions, 1 keep it at 20%. give it 25% or give it 30% and the poll with the largest % of votes wins.
---
R
---
the problem is people are hoarding them waiting for an update
---
I said 3.4M "in like" 4 hours. Which is 850k/hr.
---
Whatcha mean, people sell pouches all the time. When people would call me a scammer, I would explain to them how it works, and if they do not believe me I would say " go on youtube and watch theoatrix emblem guide for a better understanding"
---
single items and also in more quantity would be great - no need to drop anything :D
---
Could we please get a name purge sometime in the next 6 months? I know its alot of work but there are so many unused names, and finding a decent name is getting tough.
---
Doubt anyone relies on thia area to train Farming anyway, no rush.
---
it was a dumpster fire on release, and runescape was doing pretty fucking well in 2011. Huge bugs, huge balance issues. Thrust into the community at the wrong time.
---
funny thing is, most of the perks they wanted to offer through artisan have already been rehashed into other content e.g. redwood.
---
Back in the day when I was f2p and making money selling big bones, I remember someone got a level 108 (or so) shade event and tried safespotting it but he ran out of addy arrows. The shade didn't despawn too quickly so I'd repeatedly pick up his arrows, trade them to him in his safespot and he'd use them up and we did this until the shade died. It dropped near to no loot but we had a blast lol. This'd be great to see again.
---
Lol 6 months
---
And when you add the chances up, you get a roll on the table every 100-150 kills? Stop crying
---
I’m doing 73 to 80 right now at Seers, it’s the most boring shit I’ve ever done, it’s definitely going to be my last 99. At least doing Lava runes is 75k xp/hr and is more interactive.
---
"Colour me confused" i see your blatant but suttle attempt at racism you fuckin pig nosed white dog bitch
---
No, just 1 hour.
---
Lvl 1 Poser vs Lvl 100 Pro
---
wrong
---
It does not act as a pack yak? Besides most of the uses mentioned before are disabled for irons
---
Agility guild confirmed next
---
Its a little different but I watch this guy who does clues only. So basically he only does quests and trains skills when its necessary for a clue. Quite fun to see him collect all the uniques on an ironman. I think his name is Only Trails.
---
Could you make it possible to see how old accounts are on the webside ? My first account i made is banned and i cant go to Bob
---
You’re missing out on herbs and other materials but do you
---
The new aerial fishing which gives 80K hunter aswell as fishing and cooking. Now I wish there was an agility version.
---
Yeah it does, you can even use multiple pouches on it to make it up to a 2 hour long pack yak 
---
Wow. That's insane. Takes me a few days just to make 1 mil cutting down yews! 
---
That is something thought up by some feminists in the 1940's. Feminists... I don't need to say more than that. There are no facts that this is the case, it's a concept thought up by feminists. The idea that you can choose your gender is that gender is supposed to be cultural and sex biological. So just because a man feels/acts/dresses or whatever, as a woman, it does not make them a woman. Culturally he might be a "woman" but not biologically. Which one is based in science and facts? Culture or biology? Culture is a man-made concept, biology is science. So a man is still a man even if he acts like a woman. I don't care however anyone chooses to dress or act, just don't try to change science. If a man likes to wear makeup and dresses, fucking do it, I don't care, just don't try to tell me that you are a woman.
---
I care
---
I know people say jagex doesnt make mistakes on this shit, but I still remember getting perma'd for saying "spam my name" at clan wars. Trying to get people to join my cc for a big clan war. Was 1 year before they finally unbanned the account, but by then I had moved on to a new one :/
---
Could you, as another rising thread on this subreddit suggested, look into adding random events like the evil chicken and shade once again, but as an optional fight that wouldn't automatically aggro you?
---
No compulsion to kill them, little-to-no reward for doing so if you choose to, but just some fun if you want to do so.
---
no i didnt search it lol. idk who lo is ;(
---
Yeah he must have afked on sand crabs and cannoned that entire week to get those stats!
---
I am here trying to maximize my farming contract turn out and then realized that I need to eradicate 20 more bank slots on my Ironman
---
Fine by me.
---
Not a chance. Will only play if a friend gives me a tbow or something.

&gt; @FugGhostArt The poly count is less than those currently in use.
---
Do you understand the concept of plausible deniability? Basically they cover their backs by saying there is a rule, but don't actually have to do anything unless you make them.
---
Don't make them. 
---
Didnt know printscreen is illegal at 3am
---
If you actually have pack yaks unlocked, yes... you'll be surprised how few uses this actually has in practice though
---
Yeah I have, cuz it took me a long fucking time to get a talisman. It's honestly not that bad
---
I’m lronNoBank and I quite enjoy the way ultimate Ironman is currently.  
---
*laughs in lowercase L*
---
Icarebot apparently cares so stop dressing as woman huehuehue.
---
And after reading the comments..... I quit RuneScape 
---
I think it’s the  only 1 click teleport that works up to level 30 wilderness
---
Trade with : Drake
---
Rather dev time be spent elsewhere personally.
---
Lol, Incel. When was the last time you got laid, mr Chad?
---
Crafting guild is actually really solid for ironmen. Has all the crafting moulds, a hide tanner next to a bank. Not much more you can do with crafting.
---
As for cooking, idek why that skill has a guild but it’s about as useless as it should be
---
that could work, but im at no cb gain at this point
---
Yea there are quite a few but almost all of them become available at the latest stages of the game.
---
What I propose gives lower-level players a chance to obtain pets.
---
Just wondering, do you have the elite morytania diary complete? Maybe it only works with the fully unlocked bonecrusher..
---
Looks like gangnam style
---
Also, I think u guys won like twice? The al kharid shit show obviously doesn't count to anyone. You got dqed in one for ddossing everyone and running a bot farm (so True Fox got the W for that). Then, Rhynia aka Korean Girl ddossed their way to the final and still lost (lmao) and now it's been Fools or the clans I've run with who have been winning ever since then. Rot won't ever win another DMM tourney, I guarantee that
---
You seem to revel in this.  
---
Makes ya feel a good and righteous layin' down your madeup law eh?
---
I mean, the guy went ahead and specified what he meant without the contraction. I figured he honestly didn't know better, so I explained. I tried not sounding like a dick, but it's hard not to sound condescending when you're explaining this by text
---
Didn't mean to, though
---
ill do ur jad for you if you want for free lol
---
I found the number of calquat seeds to be extremely high considering there is only 1 patch. I have gotten 29 calquat seeds since the update. Thats a whole month of daily calquat 
---
I saw you in bounty hunter a lot and would be sad to see this being the reason for a permanent mute.. not to mention how much the bh community relies on being able to sell need a rune pouch? join "bh and chill" cc for quick and safe purchases pouches...
---
perfect thanks man
---
Did you get his spade?
---
That’s way less painful though.
---
Nope, we all had our mutes lowered to 1 hour years ago and they have stayed that way since then. I have, however, never checked if it was *exactly* 60 minutes or if it's a few more minutes; if this is the case, that would perhaps explain why it seems to be more than 1 hour.
---
Officially, though, they're set at 1 hour for everyone.
---
He's not wrong though, even slower methods like mining only took me a day for 37-60 at motherlode mine. Crafting 35-50 took me 20 mins, even smithing iron plates to 50 took me 90 mins and then sped up drastically when I went to blast furnace. Fishing 18-50 (anchovies then shilo fly fishing took me a minute amount of time). The lower levels are very quick if you don't purposely slow yourself down.
---
Tail really shouldn't be as rare as it is but oh well.
---
RS has always advertised itself as THE F2P MMO. Plus F2P has seen lots of updates which generally help lower level members, like the post OP is suggesting
---
Oh bug off you elitist, you'd just eliminatr like 60% of the players. I'm not going to buy member ship to my old acc just because you have a nail in your ass
---
Yeah, not to mention my task took me over 2 hours and you can’t even slightly afk, the second you look away you get specced, every. last. time.
---
They’re probably my least favourite task jn game right now
---
Time for some questing 
---
Risk it for a biscuit
---
I do not have the elites done, however I don’t think that would matter. Thanks I didn’t think about that.
---
I made my with only hard complete.
---
I did reanimate from 44 to 70 with Bloodveld heads, was cheap and good XP.
---
Personally I woulda just got a home teletab but you do you, looks good!
---
Pretty sure it has to be full bonecrusher, I just tried and it worked
---
Then go somewhere else? How narcicistic do you have to be to assume that everyone has to conform to _YOUR_ myopic view? Who the fuck are you to come in here and shit up on people having a good time? Because someone, somewhere out there, might be hurt by what's being said? Fuck off.
---
We don't need people like you falling over themselves telling people how fucking weak and frail we are. You don't speak for us, speak for yourself. There is no amorphous entity that unilatterally fills the role of a "Transwoman" but you're too busy dehumanizing us in a serious fashion to recognize that. Thanks cunt.
---
Going back two years I remember when it was just under 70k players. Then going back even more way back in 2009 it was about the same now my childhood favourite game that I still play to this day is booming at over 140,000 players. This is amazing.
---
Actually it stresses me the fuck out, because OSRS is supposed to be my escape from this rinse and repeat cycle of dealing with asshat in life everyday. You seem to really get off on ignoring biology and medicine after junior high so good for you. Like most medical groups worth a shit back trans people and the science does as well. The SPA, the WHO, the society of endocrinologist, a few small in scope studies have found trans peoples brain sizes match up with the gender they know they are. So again, sorry you just assumed you knew everything after your freshman year in high school but you're making a n ass of yourself. 
---
The version of the game OSRS is based on was from a manual backup. Later in the year, Jagex switched to an automatic backup system and didn't keep ancient builds of the game hanging around. Jagex got extraordinarily lucky.
---
fuck you serene
---
I run another clan chat if you get Unmuted you can try selling there. "bh and chill" cc t7s 1m t10s 2m no mm fees. Always looking for new sellers 
---
You trust in jagex? That's ridiculous. 
---
Will you gain cb from following hp levels?
---
 So to put it simply (all mobile based);
---
* I have 2 Apple ID's (1 has family sharing and 1 does not).
---
* I used the week free trial on my Apple ID **without** the family sharing.
---
* I got an ingame notification about a weeks free trial on my Apple ID **with** family sharing.
---
* I checked the in-game membership and I am being offer another weeks trial on my other Apple ID **with** family sharing.
---
Is this allowed? I know you can get a week per OSRS account, but it seems as if it is a week for each Apple ID account you have.
---
Worth noting that I have not claimed the 2nd free week of membership, I am questioning if this is correct in the first instance.
---
I'm already jelly
---
I wonder if the type of crop you have to grow affects the rewards.
---
I have only had 1 tree medium contract so far and got 2 palm 1 yew from the box. Slightly above other boxes i have gotten so far. But curious what actual large sample look like
---
More unnecessary grinding for completionists? Yes please.
---
Way better than the “NEVER XP WASTE IN A SHIT STUDENT CLUB” ones.
---
&gt; Yeah it's just dumb Ironmen whining again!!
---
You literally chose the hard mode. You fucking knew exactly what you signed up for. You don't get to complain about it being too "hard". You're an IRON man. Not some wimpy fucking normal boi. Grow a pair.
---
1 def is overrated, just train it to 3 and call it good. 
---
mole, chaos ele, dags x3, kraken, kbd, jad, all the skilling pets, penance queen, pheonix...how many do you want obtainable at medium levels? I think thats more than enough
---
Dead acc start over.

Can you make it so the plant cure potion acts like a potion upon use and add it to the barbarian vial smashing ability?

Gemstone dragons, creatures of the lost grove and airuts have insane xp rates if you do them as efficiently as you can, IIRC 4TAA on maniacal with BIS gear I was pushing 1m slayer xp an hour at gemstones, up to 1m combat xp/hour aswell doing airuts at mazcab, getting 120 slayer is a fucking cakewalk compared to osrs slayer
---
Making them valuable again and drakes wont be dead content
---
Who said everyone has to conform to your pedantic, tired edgy views of humor? And just because you're okay with offensive, lazy humor doesn't mean you speak for all trans people. If it doesn't bug you whatever but don't fucking act all high and mighty because I care to call out lazy af "humor". Been part of the OSRS community for years, I ain't going anywhere. 
---
XP climbs exponentially per level, but that doesn’t mean content is also exponential. Someone who is 5% to max has complete access to mid level content (untradeables like void, f cape, barrows gloves is mid level imo). Reminder that the current end game content is level 75. Gp is the deciding factor for end game, not XP right now 
---
Do tree contracts have better rewards than short contracts?
---
Then why didn't he?
---
Tonto jump on it jump on it
---
heyyyyyy sexy skirt wearers
---
The contradictory part is saying it can't happen when the dude is here telling us it did. Jamflex is literally telling him his reality isn't real. They said
---
&gt;Contracts aren't based on tier, they're based on the farming requirement of a plant.
---
Which is literally saying. The TIER DOES NOT CARE. THE LEVEL DOES. Which means low level farmers who do contracts WILL GET ACCESS TO THE WRONG TIER BECAUSE THE PATCH IS LEVEL GATED. 
---
THE PATCH BEING LEVEL GATED IS THE ISSUE. Since the low level farmer can still grow an apple tree, what they cannot do, is access the level 45 patch!
---
Cc in my 0:39 got a guy

looks sick but whats his wrist doing? xD

I had this happen too. Hopping worlds fixed it for me. It occurred when I combined the pieces together (successfully), then disassembled it, and then was unable to combine it a second time.

---
The % doesn't influence unique item chance, just brother kills do
---
50% potential doesn't mean 50% loot. There's just certain percentages you unlock certain runes/key halves you can get. That's why people stop at 88 then you can get max runes and all that's left out of your loot is rare key halves and bolt racks. These are lacking in value for the time spent to get your % high enough and thus better to leave out. 
---
No.. OBS is a way to record highlights on the screen, very simple and efficient. It's like recording RS footage with one's ancient Hypercam 2.
---
That's some complex humor my man
---
Constantly? If you don't want to participate you click one red x on login and ignore one chat line. Hardly overbearing. 
---
Lol legendary pets can't do any of their abilities on ironman. why spread misinformation?
---
Fuck I wish RuneLite was a thing when I was doing Arceuus favor. 
---
Just disable the store banners and extras? RS3 easily has the most customizeable default client out of any game to ever exist. If other peoples cosmetics are what bothers you then just... WELL TOO FU** ING BAD BOO HOO 😂 but srsly, everyone's free to dress how they want plus keepsake keys let you fashionscape any item in the game. Pretty cool stuff.
---
Learn to spell tbh
---
Don't die
---
Except even the default zerker outfit  (400-500k risk last i played) would still hit ~140 with that combo 
---
People will always hoardar hoping items get buffed. And someone will profit from the buff no matter what
---

---
Keep fighting the good fight, sir.
---
Rip. Now you have to start all over again
---
You know you can just not buy MTX, right? 
---
Yep, it was amazing at the start. No grand exchange, no rooftop agility, no corporeal beast, no Zeah, no Zulrah, no one did blast furnace. Simple and wholesome. 
---
What is funny is that if I could go back to anytime in rs history it would be the beginning of oldschool runescape, not actual 07.
---
Make Gloves Gloves Again
---
Ahhh.. the 2 def build.. 
---
Pussy wont updute this
---
When i log into my account everything is reset to the normal norms. So i have to do everything over. 
---
Over half of them
---
I'll probably log in and play it one day just to do the quests 
---
I’m also level 99 “stand at the rock jump at Vork because you’re not ready to pay attention yet”
---
subreddit controls the game = new players make the choices :)
---
You've clearly been going to different drakes than I have.
---
When you report somebody it already auto adds them to your ignore list. 
---
You might have pked their alt account or something
---
Yeah! It's a little more effort, since you have to go up and down the stairs, but it's much faster 😄
---
Thank you very much.
---
= more variety
---
Spent an hour cleaning my bank tonight, went from 816 to 590 and can’t bring myself to get much past that. I’m a hoarder. 
---
My suggestion would be do what you can to make the ~215k per day. 
---
Do dorics quest and the knights sword for 30 smithing. 
---
Do the quests to unlock blast furnace. 
---
You can smith bars there for 300k/hr at iron. 
---
Although you‘ll run out of stamina quite quickly without any levels in Agility. 
---
&gt;I'm not sure why people want to skip the whole leveling part when it's such a core component to the gameplay.
---
because low level content isnt as rewarding and engaging as high level content. 
---
&gt;So many people ask for more mid/low level content and have no idea how that would work aside from asking for stealing creation for the ten thousandth time.
---
why are you trying to make it more complicated than what it is? the addition of granite swords/hammer is a good example of a nice low/mid level content addition. then theres content like zmi or wintertodt that you can do regardless(almost) of your lvl.
---
GZ 5 Fires 1 Nature 
---
If only they added HD graphics as a toggle option 
---
and its the least afk fishing method other than 3 ticking lmao
---
What’s MTX?
---
It's actually over 2 ticks, not 1 tick. 2 gmaul hits 1 tick, elder maul hit 2nd tick
---
Neat.
---
Burning crusade private server would be better 
---
Yes, most people do. Being outspoken about its usage as a man would leave behind questionable connotations and reactions in a public sphere.
---
15 def for fairy rings and varrock medium diary would be my go to
---
Wilderness bosses, Barrows, Giant Mole.
---
This comment really triggers people for some reason.
---
Thank you for the invite, I always see you in the bank advertising your CC :D. I am not 100% sure the selling of the rune pouches got me the perm, but I am pretty sure that is the reason due to no evidence, and I know for sure people reported me while I was there because they were not aware you could buy a rune pouch, so they figured I was scamming. 
---
I appreciate the response &lt;3 
---
Can you please male Xerican Fabric stackable?
---
Right now there is no point in looting it from shamans because your inventory would fill up so fast, and you would be banking every 5 minutes.
---
Maybe make the fabric stackable, then unstackable after its been "treated"?
---
What is this referencing? I know it's WoW
---
Yeah it doesn’t even add a combat level when you get 99 hp. 
---
Congratz
---
Which is fair
---
It has evolved but I also think that so many of the modern mmos have devolved to the point where osrs is a breath of fresh air. 
---
I mean, stealing is still against the law. Seeing how the pure reacted, it's pretty clear they're most likely friends IRL. Once again: Calm down. Not everything has to be sad and serious.
---
I had flashbacks to this while doing the Kourend diary recently...
---
And add a thing to extend the task for people who like the current numbers
---
It's fine dude. I'm sure there's some really obnoxious people in the community who will crack shitty jokes when they notice it but your account is great and 1 def level is sad but doesn't have to mean the end of your account as it is
---

Melee range DHCB there is your buffed lanced
---
ive got around 150 kc and it's a long old grind to do a whole task at the boss. do you think its worth doing for the gp/hr?
---
Oh ok that makes sense. I made the mistake of assuming thats how it worked lol
---
I'm trying for it currently. Man is it a rough slog through the canifis course.
---
If there was a comprehensive guide on how to get back into RS3 after not playing since launch of EoC, I would try it. But when I log in, it's a completely new game to me now. I figured out the legacy interfaces, but so much has changed that I dont even know how the basics of combat, gear, transportation, "pets", skilling, etc. work.
---
Serene’s fighting back now LOL
---
Someone always drawing the btw-card, smh. It's infiltrated the main playstyles and the discourse way too much!
---
NightmareRH is that you?
---
whip don't have a str option boss.
---
I fucking hate this bot so much. 
---
I'm not hating or anything, but I don't think getting any sort of Runescape related tattoo will ever become "mainstream" 
---
This was once the model for a Yt-MejKot, it seen like a waste to let this stay in the trash forgotten [also here is a blue version](https://2007rshelp.com/img/news/mdb.gif)
---
No. You should acknowledge my informative and useful contribution here. If you had common sense. Oh wait.. (burned!)
---
I like how you leave the colour pretty simple, but where you put it is perfect 
---
I really hope they look at this. I know their focus seems to be on the Konar table and other things from the update but I hope this doesn’t get forgotten. 
---
I really think it’s a fun activity too, but the XP rates honestly need a substantial buff for how intense it is. 
---
You could get higher rates training fishing/hunter separately while also training them in a less intense way AND getting a proper resource out of it. Not to mention there’s drift net fishing too which is comparable (?) xp rates but also actually gives resources. 
---
On the contrary based on how Reddit works and the fact that the general response to warding on here was very positive when it was announced, I’d guess most of the (Reddit-using) player base are in favour or not strongly opposed to warding 
---
Hmm, interesting. 
---
I wonder why they're taking this stance now. Did something happen recently or is this an old article?
---
Damn Crit1kal, always taking our monkey nuts
---
Genuinely wondered that for a long time. My friend and I tried to make a shoddy estimate based on a linear approach. We took the number of people subscribed to the os subreddit and divided that to the peak number of concurrent players online in osrs, then taking that number and dividing it by the number of people subscribed in the WoW subreddit to give you their concurrent player count for “peak time,” but again this is a rough way of doing things. We got around 400k concurrent players online, but this was a few months ago, so if sure if you did it now, you may get a different figure. I want to say it’s a good ballpark estimate, but I have no way of proving it. 
---
Cringe, said the 13 year old pre pubescent girl
---
only greedy cunts get scammed
---
Ah I remember when my reddit user was my name and year of birth, last decade was a simpler time
---
gz
---
To give you an idea, went to Vindicta (GW2 boss) as legacy mage with blood blitz and soul split. It was maybe a couple of seconds slower than Revolution but MUCH less strain on the HP bar.
---
Why players paint over these pictures? I don't get it.
---
Gratz on 2 DEF 
---
I always thought that incorporating agility and runecrafting in a minigame kind of like how we have the Aerial Fishing and Barbarian fishing. I'm not sure why we needed another thing to combine with fishing when we have two other notoriously boring skills like agility and rc? It could be 50% as efficient exp as doing it the legit way and I'd probably play it over the skill because they're just not engaging at all.
---
indeed
---
Lmao relax dude I'm 92 combat and not even p2p right now. Some of us play this game for fun.
---
Is that what they call it these days? Man back in my day it was netflix and chill XD.
---

Attack **or** strength
---
Not neccesarily both
---
Post and username relation on point
---
Seers village course with Kandarin hard done is hyper simple and you can watch a movie while doing it. Otherwise yeah it's pretty slow.
---
You probably just saved me a bunch. I was thinking of pushing straight past 70 to 74 prayer too. Now I guess I'll stop at 70.
---
It'll take you a couple of hours on your first solo, just make a tonne of potions for olm and then brute force it. If you're on runelite you can scout the bosses leading up to olm. Make sure to scout guardians, mystics, shamans and muttadiles with any combination of puzzle rooms. Puzzle rooms are thieving, ice demon, tightrope and crabs. 
---
Most raids have 4 demi bosses and 2 puzzle rooms. When scouting the combination of bosses I prescribed in the paragraph above, you may see a room called 'unknown', this only means runelite cannot see the other puzzle room. An example of a raid I recommend you trying would be: guardians, crabs, mystics, shamans, unknown, muttadiles. You can see the 4 demi bosses I recommended and one of the puzzle rooms, so you'd be good to go.
---
You'll need a pickaxe on smash for guardians, some sort of anti poison for shamans, salve (ei) if you have it for mystics and an axe for the muttadile meat tree. Other than than, bring your best mage, melee and range gear. Blowpipe and trident are necessary.
---
Alternatively, you can pay someone to solo a duo scaled raid for you. I would imagine the going rate is a few mill. 
---
Looking at your favour bars.... does favour not deplete anymore when you gain favour for another house?
---
true, what is the best upgarade for a dscim when i only want to train str?
---
Nah mate scammers are toxic 
---
No, always go for short contracts. Keep a high level tree planted in case you get a contract for it and collect immediately, and move on.
---
what is your spaghetti policy?
---
You seem to be one of the few people around here who understand this sort of risk.
---
There's also no guarantee whatever you download off of RuneLite's website is the same code that's in Git; same with updates. As far as I know, they don't do reproducible builds either.
---
We pay we say
---
Realistically, they ruined slayer with the shitty drop table. It's not worth using the new master now
---
GET ON THE GROUND THIS IS THE GAY POLICE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUCK MY DICK

I guess I just need to get my farming up. It's only 76 right now.

---
You are sick, very sick.
---
what's better dscim with ddef or sara sword?
---
That and I don't like all the dailies that I feel like I have to do even if I don't. 
---
When I log onto OSRS I just feel like the games so alive and I love exploring the world. I really love RS3's graphics and I was one of the people actually okay with EOC, it didn't bother me at all. 
---
Just replace the id of the nests obtained in the box. Surely this cannot fail, I have no clue about programming what so ever.
---
Yeah jahex NEVER send emails they only contqct you through the message centwe on the websitw..you just got phished sorry pal
---
I would rather shit on my hand and throw it at your post like a small monkey i am.
---
It's worth finishing. I thought Glough was the hardest part. Find a video guide for the puzzle and bang it out. 
---
yea
---
God dammit lol.
---
Just wait until you realize you need 85 prayer for a diary.
---
That is EXACTLY what is mainly stopping me from playing. I hate the feeling of thinking I should be doing certain events / dailies / minigames whenever I log on. 
---
When I log onto OSRS I feel freedom.
---
Can we please have the pet rate for all the new farming patches/plants?
---
Membership will make a lot of things in the early game easier. 
---
btw how do i add a flair to this post?
---
So in other words, you hate mtx. 
---
Haha figured, still it's an impressive disparity, since prayer is so annoying to level imo.
---
That show is everything BUT realistic
---
Interesting. Osrs has a super active sub for the size of the playerbase doe since playing the game + browsing sub is normal thing. Also jmods very active here and memes make many ppl visit the sub.
---
Maybe wow players don't like visiting their sub as much making the wow playercount higher.
---
Maybe one could try to include twitch and yt views to get esitmates. 
---
Believe it or not other people can have varying opinions. If you think Runescape is a dead game you've never seen a dead game before. 
---
Bump 
---
I really appreciate you taking the time to respond with such detail. It sounds like you know what you're talking about. I'll definitely add you. Thanks again!!

Do never click any emails from "Jagex" in your mail. They are all phishing attempts. Jagex always contact you with the ingame message box, never email. 
---
I skimmed it as I'm at work. They're aren't obliged to do it, no, but the way the internet and the free works, someone out there will do it if they don't. 
---
I'm aware of what ip rights are 👌🏻 
---
Sick blunt to fakie. Are you rocking 159 trucks with a 8.8 or 9”?
---
right, i'm aware. but that one guy asked "what's 157?" and the other fella responded with "64+47+45", but that's not 157.
---
It is possible to hit 4x row ruby bolts spec and after that you will have  to hit 2x with diamond bolts... And after that you switch to bp and finish the vorkath on poison spew stage. It's possible to finish really quickly.
---
The reasons for these reactions consist of your frequent post history of spamming retarded comments, which we found out doesnt just happen in r/2007scape
---
"Corporations are people too!" Is the jist of the PR crap.
---
It only gives shared or def lol why were you using it without checking? 
---
you can safespot Wyrm
---
the record is 151, i said 160.. big deal
---
That was a good one, make sure you report this douche for scamming.
---
It's not that deep
---
I don't remember saying everyone should.
---
I simply said if they don't , they're a cunt in my books.
---
Yeh I used ensouled heads and got quite a few mage and combat lvls at the same time so enjoyed it. Also got to learn more about kourend by doing Arceuus favour. 
---
It’s not absurd. If you could just make yourself an ironman what’s stopping someone from buying all their gear then going IM mode? And also ironmen have their own separate leaderboard so you have to start from the beginning for that. Again, not absurd.
---
This didn’t occur to me until about five minutes after and I will always wonder. 
---
You could but they can still escape if they eat and make it out on time. If they only have to run 5 or 10 tiles south then it's not that hard to run between barrages/entangles. Plus, by the time you teleblock someone they'll probably notice it and start running before you can even do either of those.
---
Nah fuck beggars.
---
Hes better in exodus
---
People have written bots to follow this guy around and tell him to stfu 
---
Lol I was wondering if anyone would say anything. 
---
Do Akrisae next
---
I do like the fact that there are more casual players now. It really is nice to play the game with random people of all levels
---
That email is a phishing link. Did it start with “dear player?” You just gave them your deets if that’s the case, mate. Always check your main message centre either from the website or after you login.
---
Is there some other, better yet reasonably priced magic armor I should be using at 70 mage and 60 def?
---
You could have just said no instead of blasting him like that. Acting like a douche for no reason
---
so far i got 3 hespori seeds, 2 redwoods, white lily, the new bstaff seed, like 50 snape grass seeds, tons of low level herb seeds, 2 torstol seeds, tons of hops seeds, 3 magics and 2 yews.
---
all from hard contract exept one box was from medium since i got to plant redwood didint want to wait so long.
---
that dedication tho
---
Recolor blue and make some electricity it would’ve made a cool wyrm or drake actually lol.
---
Stranger danger.
---
Except Tencent games owns a large portion of blizzard so I’d imagine a lot of that gets paid to Tencent as royalties or something. I believe they also own most if not all of League of Legends too.
---
Zeah was nice until they felt the need to add pointless lakes to make everything inconvenient

15 minutes part, pretty easy
---
I wonder if timmy surfs the reddit. Hmmmm
---
Well that not true they send (or sent) yearly progress reports and stuff like notifications of big updates. 
---
Your temper seems to be quite steamy, Mister Boiled Eggs.
---
Lmao people downvoting cause i was mean to a scammer 
---
i had it twice grows super fast and i got the seeds for 120k each, had to wait 30-60 mins to buy.
---
I’m not gonna berate you for doing it. We’ve all done stupid shit. Just be on high alert for shit like that rather than panic. It’s exactly what they’re trying to do to you and it worked.
---
Ah I remember just staring at the login screen at all the different shapes that would appear when I was little...

I should have said**regarding your account status** is that better for you?

Nah
---
fruit trees are blocked untill 85 farming, OP have 85+ farming so he got asigned fruit contract.
---
I would like to invest in this copypasta. How much?
---
In bird culture, that’s considered a dick move.
---
People will use an item, but not to the degree where it's value is worth it's theoretical inventory spot. A regular ironman does not have the same false value and as a result can have a greater appreciation for items with niche but still occasionally valuable uses. It's not a particularly difficult concept. You derive value and enjoyment from depriving yourself of content, whereas a more traditional account does not.
---
I get what you're saying but you're phrasing it badly. It sounds like you're saying every weapon has voth options to train attack fully or strength fully. What you mean to say is that some weapons have attack-only training and some have strength-only training.
---
Really, bludgeon is the only weapon I know of that can only train strength. Every other weapon either has an attack option (whip, every sword ever, maul) or is shared (spears, lance)

I've seen some funny tweets come out of it, so I don't mind. It's just another way of marketing.
---
Don't know about that, mobile players don't really play more complicated games and I doubt old players will try it because of EoC or other changes
---
Is the Uri emote not being able to be performed once inside the COX intentional or is it a bug?
---
I’m so fucking ready for classic wow. I really hope they don’t fuck it up. 
---
11 hp ironman
---
no you dont, you cant get asigned fruit trees if you are not 85 farming, when you are 85 farming and do an easy ones you can get a fruit tree contract.
---
Remember when it dipped to under 20k?
---
Crossbow? I thought it was a chicken
---
Whats happening to WoW right now is exactly what happened with EoC. Blizzard/Activision is killing the game. They're making it ridiculously easy, adding more MTX, and completely disregarding player opinion. It may not be dead now, but they're not doing themselves any favours. If they keep down this path, I do see RuneScape outliving Wow.
---
No it's actually so bad that you may as well just alch yourself
---
If the girl is not as attractive as her wife, then there is nothing to be afraid off... But if she is hotter than his wife, men only think with their dicks after few drinks.

I had this idea a while back but where the pet that’s following you gives you resources from that boss/skill. So KBD pet and walking a mile gives 3-5 black d hide etc
---
Sorry, civilized individual

That's such a cool piece of trivia! Is that a holdover from the original Rs classic? I was never around for that. I joined around 04.

The title of this post gave me a good belly laugh.

Wow y'all, like yikes, oof.

Pretty cool video. I think "Sea Slug in a nutshell" would be better title tho. Wouldn't mind seeing some more, maybe a little faster pace would be nice if you do any of the longer quests.

you can just say 'umad'

God damn I fucking hate koalas now

i dont think it does, yes im a small sample size(been doing contracts since release)
---
some of my best loot like redwood/magic/yew seeds were from fast growing plants like herbs, i basicaly dont skip any of them only did it once when i got to grow redwood, but i did a contract to grow a yew and a magic and the loot was pretty trash. so i duobt it

no, just a fan, and glad to see others using it

That sounds awful

respect, thanks michael.
---
Why do you think he's smithing?
---
Well it was really unclear in your original comment (which also explains why people were downvoting). You made it sound like whip had the ability to train both attack and strength instead of just one.
---
It literally says ultra compost in the photo
---
Received 9seeds from just farming so far. None from contracts.

He was only at the after party at the hotel.

I was quite drunk and walked up to him and said something along the lines of wow you look like jed.

Then I realized its jed so I thought I better get some distance before my gp is gone.
---
Scale to level thing is so dumb
---
I worked in social media for a bit. A lot of the times its not that deep. I mean yeah they want to get someone who is in or really understands the target demographic, but after that its just basically up to that guy or gal to yanno, tweet stuff they find funny and all. 
---
So I mean Yeah its a little "artificial" but its not like there's some old man in a dark suit on the other end analyzing the perfect "tweet for milenials aged 17-27" with a reference guide.
---
Oof...

I edited it to be less confusing, thanks for the feedback

Recently asked for some thoughts on Konar, and didn't have anyone offer any thoughts on the matter:
---
&gt;I've been really looking forward to the Kebos Lowlands as i've been enthralled with the idea of a slayer master that assigns tasks in particular locations. However, i've heard that a lot of people have been complaining that Konar is dead on release. While she doesn't have a few key tasks (No Jad/Sire, and i'm hunting pet for both) that Dura does, is she really that bad? 20 points/task and a relatively small amount in a task seems like a good alternative to Wildy Slayer.
---
Ha! 420 gp
---
I usually open 7 play 7 accs then leave them open even if I only play 1 acc or go to sleep.

A tzharr boss would be cool with the addition of new tzharr armour and weaponry, and adding the additional weapons and armour we already have and putting gems and an uncut onxy as a rare drop and some onyx bolt tips with maybe a unique too?

I don't plant normal trees at all, usually just do 1 calquat+5 papaya trees each morning.  Costs less than 1 gp/xp and with the rate I'm going at, will have 99 farming before I even come close to maxing.  Also since I'm currently 88 farming, there's nothing I can't boost to plant, so really no rush.
---
Only broke 1 of em, that's xp waste

I'm out of the loop why is he getting worried for linking a jmod response and what are your getting upvoted for telling him not to
---
Can we get a small buff to the lance? Right now it's much weaker than the Dragon Hunter Crossbow in every way due to how bolts work. The gap would only have to close the gap a bit between these two weapons.
---
I wish I was this cool, being able to smith adamant.. wow

R6S, GTA, Warframe, etc have many players no console as well. So osrs would be some few spots down, but not that many.

Yeah it's like elder scrolls progression vs fallout progression. 
---
If you do nothing but shoot people with bows and arrows in elder scrolls, you get better at shooting bows and arrows (runescape style)
---
In fallout you can shoot people with guns but spend all your skill points when you level up to improve your explosives skill (World of Warcraft). 
---
In one game you do the thing you want to get better at, and the gameplay sort of aligns to make that happen. In the other you just do stuff and become better at what you want. 
---
this is how merchanting clans work. They tell their followers to buy or sell in order to maximize the leader's profits with artificial inflation. Too bad you don't have one of those
---
Hmmmm sounds a lot like Runescape minus the last part. Is Runescape outdated too? Or maybe youre just not open minded and think anything that doesn't look and feel like the Witcher 3 is outdated.

The problem with f2p is that everyone can always escape. I only actually liked pking in high deep wildy. I never cared that I lost massive amount of golds, just the time to resupply &amp; find fights put me off from pking.

In the 1940s? Boy you might be shocked to learn every single Native American tribe had between 3 and 5 genders depending on the tribe before the Europeans settled in America and tried to do away with that "satanic" behavior. You only think of gender being considered separate from sex as a recent phenomenon because of the massive amounts of erasure trans people have been subjected to. For instance the Nazis tried to destroy every book related to transgender people as well as to gay people too. Before that Berlin had a surprisingly vibrant LGBT community. 
---
And if you don't think culture is a fact of life you're being silly. Pretending the term "woman" is scientific when we already have the word "female" for that is also stubborn.

I think her reaction was more or less this, without the forgiving side, it was more "ok off you go" whilst watching the red water flowing down her top.

It is efficient if he wouldnt be smithing otherwise. Its all about xp per action. Smh. 27 sets of darts is more xp than 5 (25 bars) platebodies. Platebodies only beat darts if ur reseting a lot. At a skatepark, youre going 1min minimum on the course. 
---
What’s the story on this?

How the fuck do you even have such a boring life you have to complain about someone not being efficient in a game? Jeeez..

They will fuck it up, this is not old Blizz, this is new Blizzard. WoW classic, bow on mobile smh

You shouldn't have to look at a 3rd party wiki or trawl through year old dev blogs, it should say when you click on the prayer. There's no mention of how to unlock it if you don't have 74 prayer, it just says "You need 74 Prayer to use Rigour".

Well those things give a 0.6 second timer. (I know from myself I can follow a rythm given a metronome, I however can't do it without the audio feedback, even after doing it for months on an end).
---
However they have the problem that they can also be "wrong" after minor world lag etc, where instead of the beat being the start of the tick, it might be mid, or end of the tick.
---
What.
---
Should I bother arguing that... I feel like I should. But it obvious bait.. And not even good bait. Like weak basic bitch bait.
---
Im not taking it. Not this time. You know why you're wrong.
---
I would either stay 2 def, or do nature spirit for fairy rings and slay helm, and stay 13 def
---
Collection log drops aren't specific to a boss.
---
If you get an  item drop from any monster, then it will show up as completed for every boss or monster that drops it. 
---
That is why your whip is shown as completed in the sire log. 
---
Your abyssal dagger is not because you got it before the drop log came out, and it does not count previous drops. 
---
I've done this quest on 2 accounts and 4 times for people in my clan. I enjoyed the whole quest. This is easy, you're just rushing

Ah OK that sounds like a cheat but it's not so I'll definitely try it out

Was there a glitch or what happened with the ring at Corp?

Takes a while to get the Arceuus house favour but it's not too bad. If you use runelite they have a feature now to help find the books which I wish I knew about before I did it 😅 then you can pay 80k to use the fairy ring right next to the altar for quick bank trips for heads. 
---
Pretty much any other boss in the game:
---
- DKS
---
- Raids
---
- GWD
---
- Barrows
---
Could maybe try out pking if that's your style.
---
Duel arena is another opportunity if you want to gamble your money.
---
Slayer is probably your best bet to get consistent but less money, than bossing, and it allows you to upgrade your gear to be able to do the harder bosses.
---
I would honestly suggest doing DS2 as vorkath is pretty good money as well as unlocking the Avas assembler. 
---
Netflix &amp; Scape
---
That must have been an exciting moment
---
Well played, thought this was gonna be the view from the shitter. 
---
Yeah but OSRS graphics are beautiful when taking into account the small team working on it, and how well they've managed to handle what limitation they have.
---
My fucking god if I see another one of your comments 
---
how/when should i start farming as a new player?
---
Yea their nails go deep. Mine once scratched my nose, and it was extremely painful, not to mention the amounts of blood coming from it. 
---
Half of what you said applies to OSRS also
---
There is no real problem in slowly getting faster methods: that allows newcomers to "catch up" with senior players and keeps the game actually more healthy. (Lowering the barrier, instead of thinking that end game content is a moving target that moves away faster than you can reach).
---
So even if it is slightly better, but provide an xp bonus (say overall you get 5% increased xp), by having an xp bonus you still need to actually USE it. You can't just do this hypothetical method and then call it a day, you need to say do this for 2 hours, and then skill normally (lavas, whatever) for 1 hour and 50 minutes.
---
Then you would end up with "4 ehp", "winning" 10 minutes. Thus making it a better method, but you still NEED to do old content.
---
This was a buff, not a nerf. Nobody wanted the highest weighted Konar drop to be 5k fire runes.
---
Unlimited data is often not necessary because there's Wi-Fi everywhere nowadays..... Xfinity also offers the Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots almost everywhere. it's designed to save you money and not have to rely on unlimited data which is extremely expensive. 
---
 
---
## Reminder: Thammaron's Sceptre is still USELESS and a troll drop from Revenants
---
Cons: More expensive and risky to use in Wilderness than a trident while being worse in most scenarios, Severely outclassed by the other two Revenant Weapons, Absolute garbage weapon with no upsides to it whatsoever. If you get it as an Ironman just swallow the disappointment.
---
Pros: Looks pretty cool tbh.
---
disclaimer: Unfortunately every discussion or attempt to bring this weapon to relevance (not even make it OP or absurd and untimely buffs) is stifled because of fears of price gouging. There is no question or argument that this weapon is currently **AWFUL** in every regard, but SOME people are strongly against changing it for the better balance and healthier version of the game due to fears that others will profit.
---
**To Jmods: Will you ever change this weapon so that it has a use and not a waste of bank space?**

If they are on other creatures than rats you can use teleother, if your lucky they forgot to turn accept aid off

Good choice.

yeah but it doesnt feel pure haha

I’m low 400s in kc with my first drop being the leather at 184, I’ve gotten 2 ring pieces since then. You seem especially dry but I’d say we’re both dry on ring pieces given what I’ve seen. The two big drops im thinking are 1/512 
---
Get 13 for those addy gloves bro 
---
You can, but by the time you catch a freeze on them so they can't run away, they will already be in edge bank.
---
tysm haha 
---
How does Jagex earn anything in this scenario? The gold farmer gets the money paid for the gold, and Jagex gets to take \~6m out of the economy, but doesn't get any cash. It would be in their benefit to reduce RWT.
---
I didn't see anything about Jagex nerfing the Hydra's drop table, just Konar's rare drop table.
---
Botting however is replaced with multi-logging though. A game that has 1 player using 1000s of accounts isn't "healthy". So if comparing to other games we shouldn't take the accounts, but rather the amount of people actually playing.
---
haha restart the game you mean 
---
Imagine thinking this is botting.
---
Bots don't have to run together, they're all run by individual processes.
---
The same person legitimately playing 8 accounts, however. They would stack them up and preform the same task at the same time, while naming them the same.

RIP if i had 99 slayer lol

Wait so the higher tier contracts do not give better loot? If so that would be silly.

It's copypasta, I think people think I was serious considering it got downvoted to shit lol

Where is the $112 / month number from? I play on mobile data a lot, and the most it ever used was 50mb in one month. Other months were closer to 20mb. Been playing mobile since July or so last year. It really isn't a lot

I agree they're way over-designed, but think of it this way. all the zeah crests are for houses vying for power of the continent. wouldn't they all be trying to over design and over prestige each other?

&gt; We've just hotfixed some changes to Kebos:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 1. All Runes, Yew logs and Crystal keys have been removed from Konar's drop table.
---
&gt; 2. Pure essence has been reduced from a weighting of 5 to 1 on Konar's drop table.
---
&gt; 3. The Alchemical Hydra now accesses Konar's drop table.
---
&gt; 1/5
---
Fuck
---
Serene, the only way you could stay on topic would be if they renamed Reddit to 'Topic'... shut up plz
---
i know 75 attack was such a huge risk! basically you're hoping you wont fuck up 
---
That's unfortunate, I feel your pain though for sure. 
---
Grats on the leather nonetheless though!
---
Later, Later. 
---
Sounds like you’re just salty you can’t get into a game that millions of people enjoy.
---
The only time they did anything resembling ‘restarted the storyline’ was in Warlords of Draenor which is generally regarded as the worst expansion, but that was years ago.
---
You can’t really make a complaint about graphics since everyone here plays OSRS... some people enjoy the cartoon art style.
---
Quests can be boring and repetitive, but they pretty much follow the MMO standard. Runescape is the outlier with its complex and memorable quest narratives that I consider to be the best of any MMO. WoW makes up for it in unrivaled end game content.
---
It you think dungeoning is thoughtless, you probably haven’t played the game in a few years.
---
I think gear becoming obsolete with each new raid is one of the strengths of the game, allowing so many people to come back to the game when a new raid or expansion is released without having to worry about being hopelessly eclipsed by people who have been playing the game longer.
---
Runescape is a game about the journey. WoW has become more about the destination (i.e. end game content). Neither game is ‘obsolete’  and many people on this sub play both.
---
What is it about? Never heard of it
---
I feel the same way. I maxed early in 2013 and any 120s I got didn't feel very rewarding. Even trim didn't, it was more like wow I just finished wasting a lot of time. One the main things that puts me off is that the game just becomes a chore. I think some of the content they put in the game is good but most of it is disappointing or boring and ends up becoming a daily or dead content after the rewards. That and the entire player base feels extremely entitled to everything. I remember when invention was released people complained the skill was too slow/expensive. It was 1m/h and cost next to nothing if you did gwd/glacors lol, I got 120 in like 2 weeks.
---
The fuck ?
---
Could the doors that seperate the different tiers in the farming guild be replaced by passable barriers? Bit stressful during peak hours when a door is more challenging than an end-game boss.
---
Dude calm down this game uses hardly any data, using reddit takes like 200x more data lol i have not had any issues with it going between wifi and 4g
---
LOL
---
I have no clue, maybe I’ll leave my house and experience “outside”.
---
Still unsure. I have gotten some mediums worth more than my high contracts for sure. But I do not know the averages. 
---
Either way skipping a yew tree hard contract to get a quick medium is more gp/hr and then you can go back to hard hoping for a herb or snape grass or something quick with no loss
---
Granted you get the seeds that buff all of your plants for a few days as well
---
Oh no :( at least I was mining the new rocks 
---
1000kc in and I’ve got none of these
---
Could de kourend elite diary get a noted hydra bone perk
---
i did this on day of release no guide and i shit you not it took me over 2 hours for this part alone 
---
That and they probably leaked their PIN on stream. 
---
And you are in a heavy stage of denial. 
---
Feelsbad
---
If you die with them you get leather anyways
---
I feel like you have misunderstood the joke somewhat if you feel the need to photoshop to outdo people
---
How do I delete someone else’s post 
---
Could there be another karambwan fishing spot not locked behind fairy rings?
---
And no risk edge pking with the only chance of winning/losing us a lucky stack is so much more fun (no skill lol)
---
The changes to Konar's Table increased the average value per drop by like 7K~. So it was actually a small buff.
---
It's filmed in South Wales in an old university building but they seemed to decorate it in such an American high school way and I have no idea why. 
---
Spec still needs nerfed. Stacking multiple specs in a single game tick was never even dreamed of back in the day, even if technically possible, with its utilization being largely discovered and popularized in OSRS. The weapon is iconic but the brokenness of its spec is not, and is long due for a fix.
---
lmao usually not even that much 
---
Looks like they deleted it in order to make a thread! [Here is the new link](https://twitter.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1084834960543043585) as I can't edit the OP.
---
Okay so whats the point?
---
Worst part about this picture is that your using OSBuddy...
---
i thought it was actually pretty accurate. 
---
Might be more an issue of you disliking slayer and not playing the game rather than 69 slayer takes so damn long, it takes like a few weeks of a few hours a day to get 69
---
Oh ye I forgot about that shit. I was just thinking he was always part of wildy development, like the original mage arena 2 which was trash. So I assumed Rev Caves was him
---
The poll said you could revert them, so it is a more of a bug fix than a change.
---
Okay but this game is not the only reason you own a cell phone. what if you want to watch a video? What if you want to download an update for one of your apps or check your bank statements? you're acting like this game is the only reason you would ever need to worry about your data and that's just not true. I can't believe this is even an issue
---
I'd rather pay 80m than deal with the bullshit that is Pest Control, yep.
---
Vorki isn't close to the best money in the game. Its tied with Cerberus, Dagannoth Kings, and Demonic Gorillas, but loses to Zulrah slightly, and by 1-2m/hr to Kree Arra, Revs, and Hydra, and by like 2-10m/hr to both Raids.
---
Is this a fire lizalfos? 
---
' you gronk '
---
Good call! I'll have to unlock it up I could totally just abyss to blood altar and take the shortcut
---
And saradomin sword, and Armadyl crossbow (dropped by Sara, excuse me?),  Staff of the Dead, and Bandos... poor War Boi has nothing unique.
---
Everyone with experience knows Reddit you fucking mong. I don’t care about total or xp or money or anything else other than FUCKING PLAY TIME. I’m not here to make some convoluted claim about shitters on Reddit. I am here to tell you,that if you go to goblins on a F2P world where the NEW PLAYERS are and ask them about 2007scape or Reddit they’ll have no fucking idea what you’re talking about.
---
Sit kid you got murdered 
---
I'm a little far from lumby elites since I don't intend to waste time on quest cape before I max.
---
Ironmen were ok with it because trident charges. saves time buying fires from shops, not a big deal though.
---
Not really unfair at all. It’s one of the perks of using such a dated engine. 
---
Probably not. Ton of F2P people are still hoping for Teleblock to be added fo F2P.
---
There is actually a big chance that there's currently close to 5m active subs of runescape. According to (this)[https://i.imgur.com/T9GCIbF.png] at the end of 2017 there were 2.35m subs with average users of about 60k. Now we're averaging over 120k so I'd say 5m is reasonable.
---
Also this would be more inline with similar creatures like metal dragons and dark beasts
---
Very nice!!
---
D scim til you hit 99 str then switch to range.
---
I'd blowpipe/cannon everything til 99 slayer, melee is usually lower dps than ranged on pures and unless you know how to to 1-tick overheads it will also cost a ton in pray pots. 
---
Even with cost of scales/darts/cannonballs you will STILL profit with chaeldar if you can't use nieve. I made over 200M going to 99 slay cannon/bp with Chaeldar (at the time Scales were in the \~250gp range) so you should make even more now scales are cheaper.

So... You don't see player killers, unless they're in the place where they kill... players?
---
Honestly, I have barely done any of Zeah with the exception of Wintertodt and Catacombs. I'm still catching up to a lot of the updates released in the past year
---
you just call it a football. it's not a football ball.
---
Yes, the new meta is never checking health on Celastrus and Redwood until you get it as a contract. Unless you need the XP badly. But honestly, I don't see that happening. It's Farming, after all.
---
You do realize it wasn't much better before the changes, right? The Konar Table was polled as a slight increase to profit; an added 900gp per kill with a chance of rare uniques does that just fine. Konar was never meant to make bank; it was just another way to train Slayer that offered extra points and some more profit. Also, [Konar is better than Nieve](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/afb7wt/konar_is_better_than_nieve_the_math_proves_it/) or at least a close rival... So it is far from a bad Slayer Master and it is what we voted for.
---
wouldnt wanna be you either 
---
It used to be $5, and now that RS's has changed I refuse to pay the $11 just like I refuse to pay for WoW. You also don't need to pay for it, because bonds exist.
---
Donate $1, you now potentially have their email address for their account. Search databases / ask questions for recovery info
---
That isn't what I mean, I mean for stuff like resource drops, those should be tied to your skill levels
---
Yeah I don't understand this. Like bro how you gonna take hands off vehicle, stare into your camera to get a pic while moving at 60+ mph in a 2500+ lbs heap of metal on a stretch of road with other drivers also traveling at the same speeds.
---
You're bitching about him going speed limit and here you are endangering the lives of everyone around you and yourself.

Go purchase a mirror m8, your hypocrisy is baffling.
---
It's the best combat upgrade you can get for an account
---
Oh toughen yourself up a bit it’s called having a laugh.
---
I haven’t been able to find anyone with those xp rates, highest I’ve seen claimed is 70k fishing and 90k hunter which is slightly under the rates from aerial fishing at 99. This may have been before Jagex updated it but even after the update I can’t find anyone saying 80k fishing and 100k hunter
---
Eternal bracelets would be nice, and fit well too.
---
You can get modt BiS gear in OSRS bybother means besides RNG.
---
Raiding and hoping for that 1 special item is WoWs way.
---
Woah where are you getting all those seeds? I got none so far.
---
Maybe some lower tier stuff like Bowstring, noted bars (Steel/mithril) 
---
..that doesn’t counter his argument though
---
they’re charging more for more content
---
the size of the team that produces said content is irrelevant 
---
Make a level 70-90 cmb level account and then go hangout in the Wildy trying to boss and see what happens
---
Barrows is fine but it's very old and pretty lame to do all the time
---
Nope, it's horrible. Eternal bracelets are a great way to destroy the bracelet/gem market
---
On average, the RDT is worth 750 gp per kill, or 75k per roll. I think the value is perfectly balanced and the drops themselves could just use a little tweaking. I think that unique drops will maintain her value as people outlevel her, and that maybe she could add a little more incentive up front rather than more/different drops. She already gives fantastic amounts of points, so maybe just buff her a bit by letting a few more tedious tasks be blocked?
---
Eternal bracelets would be disgusting, make them chargeable by putting bracelets into them
---

I really like this idea.

pretty weird that fighters torso is minigame locked but bcp is locked behind a ge purchase unless youre an iron man.
---
I agree, noted resources really are uncreative, bland, and a waste of what could be
---
Hey how do you get that HP and Prayer bar in your inventory? It looks amazing
---
realistically, the options are stay 2 def, get 3 def, or go 42/45, I would stay 2 def.
---
I have 2 def on my main pure, it tanks, tbh.
---
I highly doubt that unless you're doing really, REALLY low level tasks.. 
---
You can kill Tav blues at like level 20
---
66 range is hardly ideal, plus rune boots offer negative accuracy. You'll start noticing better landed hits post 70! Til then I suggest you swap to knives to do damage, as crossbow could take you a while, also get an ava's device from the quest animal magnetism. Saves your ammo
---
Bad idea

Yeah don't listen to the people that have an investment in this game doing well, no, listen to the casuals making stupid suggestions.
---
Dagon'hai robes
---
Do DS2 needs like 70 ranged and you got free spot what are you even talking about
---
You no lucky
---
That's weird, maybe they're only affected by melee? Otherwise, I have no idea what you're doing wrong.
---
I love this idea, really adds to the flavour and makes the drops more noticeable for mobile players (like me).
---
I wouldnt call expansions updates.
---
I tested it for about an hour at 82 fishing and 74 hunter on my alt and got 47k fishing xp and 60k hunter xp. This still works out to being 1.09 EHP using [CML EHP rates](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/suppliescalc.php)
---
No comment on what items, exactly, should be dropped, however I quite liked the idea of the amount dropped being affected by the related skill level of the player. 
---
The formula could follow a similar curve to the experience curve, giving a warranted advantage to more progressed players and giving incentive to less progressed players to train their accounts. 
---
Warriors guild...Melee only
---
Take Pure Essence off the table. I don't see why it's on there. The current table is decent, but the Pure Essence drop is just the "oops bad luck" drop that nobody ever wants to see. A reward should never feel bad to get.
---
Oh you meant VoiceOverPete, love that guy.
---
Fuck. Wellp. I thought we were in /r/gaming. Much appreciated.
---
This
---
its more rare than 3rdage lol
---
Not sure if advertising it as "game is so afk that you can just click a button and then do irl things" is a good idea lol 
---
What .... am i even looking at? 
---
Wouldn't mind a message, but I can usually tell
---
Is it.. Emily 
---
"Have them drop literal lootboxes so it's not a private server"
---
wat
---
We btw we gay
---
I'm not sure if this is still the plan but will redwood logs ever receive a better use? (had read some 2 y/o reddit posts saying there may have been plans at one point.
---
Yeah you only have to book galvek 3 months in advance. I've been on a waiting list for 2 weeks to kill him. It's getting ridiculous..
---
Fair - I can get behind this is other people agree. 
---
Because it's only a few years old and updated regularly? 
---
She is a slayer master who lives on top of a volcano so I think this one should absolutely be included just for thematic purposes alone. 
---
What about Sulphur Lizards? They are a cool alternative to desert lizards and a great way to get ores and bars!
---
Use zulraguide.com it makes you click on the spawn you get so you know where to go each time 
---
I agree with others grinding a bond f2p is not fun, and will take way longer than working  to pay for membership.
---
As a f2p I would recommend setting a few goals before you got for membership if you are not sure about paying for the game yet. I'd aim to do drangon Slayer personally.
---
Didn’t they say that wow classic is gonna follow the same update cycle as vanilla?
---
Lol that’s not extended and that was one example. All slayer tasks are the same fuckin thing lmao. The funny thing is brain dead people can play runescape because it’s so afk. I’m glad you don’t play wow tho since you seem like someone that can’t follow boss mechanics. 
---
Wyrms arent too bad and have decent xp rates with decent loot.
---
Not if they're rare enough
---
Glad I could help!
---
Noted bones, and Hides are just changing the type of notes resource. 
---
Uniques would be fine, if the community would allow them to be passed. But anything that could remotely improve slayer efficiency wouldn’t ever pass a poll. 
---
Incredible. "I know you are but what am I". You're really a connoisseur of the written word dude lol. 
---
&gt;9. To make up for the reduced drops from the drop table, Konar’s breast size has been increased by 20%.
---
I really think this is a step in the right direction. Konar provides great content for mid level players who could use more. 
---
Like Wintertodt crates, herb boxes and the boxes rewarded from farming contracts?
---
I remember being so excited to enter the ranging guild when I was a kid, but when I finally got there it was just some junk and a practice target.
---
They're melee only.
---
Took me 4 hours before. Lol
---
If you got the craft level I know if you have med done and make them into air battlestaffs and alch you get between 60-65k a day
---
Over prep since you haven't got a lot of experience down; would recommend you learn 1:0 method first with an elder maul or slow hitting weapon and then 4:1 with tent/ 4 tick weapon when you're more experienced. Brimstone ring will probably be BiS for overall accuracy but not dps 
---
I would recommend Synq's guide; gives an indepth tutorial on every boss and olm, markers are in the video description.
---
Another question. I'm sitting on around 17-18m cash stack. My bank is worth north of 45-50M, with my gear being the following...
---
Melee: Whip, DDefender, DLegs, DChain, DBoots, Helm of Noitsnot, Fire Cape
---
Range: Full God DHide, Blowpipe/RCB, Book of Law, Accumulator
---
Mage: Full Mystic, Iban's/Elemental/Ancient Staves, Book of Darkness, GE-purchased God Cape (not the good one from the Mage Arena)
---
Jewelry: Occult Necklace, Amulet of Fury, Archers Ring, Berserker Ring, Seers Ring
---
I would like to maintain a 10M base cash stack. What should I do with the 7-8M difference - upgrade gear or skill? If it's skill, which skill(s) would y'all do (IGN: ProAmerica76 for hiscores lookup)?
---
Lol get a load of this guy
---
That's not really saying a lot though. Imo, anything post-BC started the steady decline of the game and anything post-WOTLK just started the steep slope down. 
---
I don’t think the pearls scale. My guess is it’s simply the number of fish you catch that will influence the pearls/hr. [Here](https://youtu.be/v9pZ3RLGsyE) is a guide by Thurco on how he was able to achieve those rates.
---
Hyrda needed to be left alone. Such bs
---
I actually agree with you. Anyone able to repeatedly kill Elvarg without trouble is most likely far progressed in F2P land. I really do think it’s a great idea, but if I was Jagex(aiming to make money), this would actively discourage players going from F2P to members simply because they now have more “end-game content” as free players. 
---
Maybe allow members to continue killing Elvarg to encourage more early/mid-level content, which seems to be something people continuously complain about right now. 
---
Maybe he could have like a 1/16 Rune Plate drop and serve as a low level entry to PvM.
---
“Spend all of high school playing RuneScape”
---
Yea totally, we were all in high school playing 
---
If there's gonna be eternal bracelets, they need to be rare as fuck. Like on par with eternal glory. And eternal glory is helped in part by the fact that almost no one wants to go out and recharge glories. So yeah, hella rare or no go
---
I have about 200 chaos fanatic kills on my lvl 90 and 50 on my lvl 65 pure. KBD is easy for mid levels as well and you can buy your own instance and its not really in wildy.
---
Also depending on what you consider "mid level", i do vorkath on my lvl 90 and have zulrah unlocked on it, so i think theres plenty that mid levels can do.
---
Dagon'hai top and bottom with the same drop rate of mystic's from other slayer tasks.
---
Boss mechanics, like doing a raid with 25 people over and over again for the same shit tier drops? You clearly don't like runescape, so just fuck all the way off. 
---
We know you guys want them, but we're still looking for somewhere that they'll fit better - they don't seem to belong on this particular table. 
---
Excuse me sir, do you know the time?
---
My watch's brokened.
---
Increase herb seed amount from 1-4 to 5-12 (so you can do atleast a farmrun with the drop and is still a nerf from what the herb drop used to be)
---
A message that u hit the table would be fun. 
---
Increased clue rate on task 10/20%
---
Make not only fish scale to level but ores aswell, add logs which scale to lv aswell.
---
Remove coin drop and in turn increase rune drops. to 1-3 or even 1-4.
---
(Maybe add charged orbs and battlestaves) 
---
Killing abyssal demons in the abyssal area is aids. I understand it, but its aids.
---
That is all.
---
Because hes talking about pvming on a pure while you're clearly still talking about pvping
---
I don’t understand though, I’ve tried taking this off to no avail....
---
Did you really.
---
are you the impling?
---
I envisioned them being as rare as the 2,500 Saradomin Brews drop on the original table.
---
im calling bullshit on this one, but that's probably to hide my sadness that i hit 140 with no uniques so who knows 
---
That did well with Reddit on the herb drop. 
---
Maybe something to grind like a sulphur lizard pet. The model is pretty great.
---
Please add a unique Crystal Bow attachment. The bow looks so cool, but it is so useless in the game 😔
---
It's only retroactive for untradables (void, pets etc.) I believe everything since it's been added is tracked regardless of if you have the book or not. Pretty sure my friend went and got it after getting a drop and it was there.
---
 I've been trying to come up with something that is useful, doesn't devalue skilling and makes doing Konar slayer tasks worthwhile. We don't need more supply drops that devalue current skilling methods, we need something new. 
---
**Metrical Slayer Gear**
---
Metrical Slayer gear is slayer gear usable for magic, melee and ranged. The Metrical Slayer items would have a right click option to change between ranged, mage and melee, so that only the bonuses of one of the styles is active at any one time. This cannot be done in combat.
---
The items would require level 60 defence and have stats slightly better than rune\\mystic\\black d hide, with an added bonus set effect of having a 2% chance per piece equipped to roll one additional time on the regular drop table of the monster being killed while on a slayer assignment, as an additional drop.
---
In addition, every piece also has a 2% increase in damage and accuracy while on a regular slayer assignment, up to a total of +6 %. When doing a Konar slayer task this is doubled to 4% damage and accuracy increase per piece, up to a total of 12% to make up for some of the extra time spent slaying in less efficient locations.
---
To make Konar worthwhile even after obtaining all items, the items should have a reasonably large high alchemy value. I think this could be around 2m-2,5m, but I’’m not entirely sure.
---
This is what the drop table could look like:
---
***Suggested reworked Drop Table***
---
**Very Rare drops (average one drop every 25-30 tasks)**
---
*Metrical Slayer Gear (untradeable) consisting of:*
---
Metrical Slayer Tunic (tribrid)
---
Metrical Slayer Legs/Skirt (tribrid)
---
Metrical Slayer Boots (tribrid) (The boots would include the burn-effect counter similar to stone boots)
---
**Rare drops**
---
Snapdragon seed x3-4
---
Ranarr seed x4-x6
---
Sanfew serum (4) x2
---
Blood rune 150-250
---
Death rune 200-300
---
Law rune 150-250
---
Chaos rune 250-500
---
Attas seed x2
---
Iasor seed x2
---
Kronos seed x2
---
Hespori seed x2
---
**Uncommon drops**
---
Teleport to Mount Karuulm x3 (tradeable)
---
Rune platebody x1-x3
---
Rune platelegs x1-x3
---
Rune full helm x2-x4
---
New colour Mystic top
---

---
New colour Mystic boots
---
New colour Mystic gloves
---
New colour Mystic hat
---
**Common drops**

---
Super Combat potion (4)
---
Ranging Potion (4) x2
---
Prayer potion (4) x2
---
4 Monkfish
---
Snapegrass seed x6
---
Potato Cactus seed x6
---
Verkeerde taal, jodenhater.
---
Range is busted. It does not need a ferocious glove analogue. 
---
I also watch That 70s Show
---
I think it needs a pet, like just a literal table. this is truly what needs to be added.
---
Ohh my gosh bracelet of eternal slaughter and eternal expeditious! Top 2 things i didnt know i wanted until now!
---
It's is without a single doubt that the community doesn't want RS3 graphics. It's a completely said and done conversation. 
---
The real debate is if we want an HD update of our current graphics retaining the current art style which is more of 50/50 debate. 
---
What legs are you wearing?
---
A lantern held in the offhand slot that emits the blue karuulm glow. When demons are killed it will absorb their power (ashes). When it’s full you can empty it for prayer xp and possibly a small prayer point restore. It recognizes different demons and will give additional xp for a stronger demon.
---
Since the community is obsessed with it is either "dead content or too op so devalues X" and "we need mid tier content", why not add a t55 armour that has offensive stats?
---
I was thinking a version of Konar's armor as a unique. It would give +1 str and +2 accuracy to all offensive melee stats for the legs. +2 str and +3/4 accuracy to all the offensive melee stats for the body. 
---
This wouldn't devalue bandos but could still potentially add a max hit to your attacks while adding some accuracy to it too. Also you could get into Konar's pants so that's a pro too.
---
nerf blowpipe first
---
I mean, not a fan of the hilt/cross guard but otherwise yes exactly!
---
Simple but good looking. Otherwise the game starts looking orcish and WOWlike. The whole beauty of RuneScape was the gentle and believable graphics. 
---
I’d love a higher end bow that didn’t look fucking ridiculous. 
---
your problem is that you're using rune darts 1.2k each, when you can easily be using addy darts 140 each.
---
Questing requires patience and a bit of common sense. Clearly this sort of content isn't for you, so why don't you go back to your slayer tasks, I'm sure they are more up your alley :)
---
I did MM2 yesterday, and i freaked the fk out when i was about to use the last sachel on the upper floor. I stood on the tile right next to the last objective and accidentally used the sachel on the pillar next to the one you are supposed to. My dude freaking bolts it and get caught. FML.
---
Or, if you weren't too bothered about posting to reddit as soon as you seen it you'd know its fake
---
Here's the [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4) of him dying.
---
Melee only enemies in the warriors guild.
---
Just make it so you can hit the drop table at least once when you kill 100+mobs and that the average konar loot is 100k...
---
No need to make it super profitable, its suppose to be a mid tier slayer master. Not the best one, its already giving the best points outside of wildy.
---
I dont like the rng chance of getting 500k+ when you're already training combat stats and getting slayer xp + the most points.
---
If anything getting 100k + guaranteed from konar droptable + whatever the task gives + the slayer points + training cmb + training slayer should be a reward good enough.
---
lvl 75 slayer master shouldnt be the best option, it should be good for mid tier players.
---
How is everyone sure this is bait again? Saw it on the other thread too
---
How about eternal slaughter/expeditious bracelets (as suggested above), but they are charged with normal slaughter/expeditious bracelets? 
---
[Yt-MejKot](https://runescape.wiki/w/Graphical_updates/Monsters/TzHaar#Y)
---
Warding!
---
Revert the fish scaling with level back to sharks, or a smaller amount of better fish like sea turtles or manta rays. It doesn't make much sense that its the only scaling drop on the table, and a big complaint with the original nerf is that mid level players use this slayer master for a bit of cash for lower xp rates. Mid level players don't generally have high enough fishing levels to make this drop worthwhile.
---
&gt; perhaps add an ornament kit to turn blue mystic into the dusk variant.
---
d
---
i feel like 2-10 seems good so there are some jackpot drops on the table.
---
you could inventory tag it with RL for now. should make it easier to see
---
I like what you did with the fish scaling. More along the lines of that would be good. I personally don't feel that supply drops are that big of a problem, but make them some of the rarer drops.
---
Alternatively, she could have a scheduled rotating drop table that changes every week from alchables and weapons to supplies and resources, and you could go a bit crazier with the drops that way since they're not always available.
---
Off the top of my head, that's what I think I'd be happiest with. I liked the monetary value of her initial table, but I felt bad about selling them because it was tanking the prices of resources. I think she really needs 100k+ drops or she's not going to be used over Duradel at all, especially since she doesn't offer Boss Slayer.
---
An uncommon supply drop of a 2 dose range and super combat pot, 2 prayer potions, and 2-4 monkfish. This is what the table was supposed to be for anyway, sustaining you on your slayer task.
---
1 def pures rock it for fashionscape which makes it popular.
---
but it's also a clue reward so it does have value. 
---
Item sinks are a permanent fix, is the thing. So long as they work at an appropriate rate.

Dude my friends told me about your story, this is the cutest thing I've ever heard and I'd like to donate a DeX scroll to you in game. Add me - 'Chany'
---
I'm online most of the time dude so get on and send me a PM! 
---
Zammy wines would be awesome 
---
Cannonballs would be a real fun drop. Wholeheartedly hope to see that some day
---
The GP value of ultrarare drops (like 2.5K brews) was fine, the issue was that resources acquired through skilling were entering the game en masse through PVM activities. Seed drops are fine (since their true value is only realized through farming), but cutting out the middleman and dumping huge amounts of torstol and other herbs is a problem. Noted resource drops should not be a thing.
---
nah man i already know your kind dont bother to respond
---
I hate this idea, just drop the shit instead of wasting my time  to open a crate..
---
What if it were made to not work with two-handed weapons?
---
Ironmen that are pre-zulrah disagree.
---
You mean with blowpipe, or other stuff too?
---
Tbh I don’t think that would keep the price of the item itself from dropping. It would just increase the cost to use it. I personally think the best way to keep an items price from dropping is from 1 of two concepts.
---
1.) Make the item or list of items useful for other skills. For example in RS3, lower tier items like Barrows shot up in price when invention was released because it was an easy way to gain xp and get components. 
---
2.) Introduce a higher tier item that needs a lower tiered item in order to use. An example for this in osrs is the best in slot boots that you get from cerb. You you can’t just get the crystal (I think that’s what it is) and call it good. You have to also have dragon boots, ranger boots, etc in order to upgrade to best in slot boots. 
---
The problem with option two is you can’t just keep doing this or else you’ll eventually need 5 previous items before you can get a higher tier item. 
---
In the end item prices lowering is going to happen. That’s just how it works. More items come into the game so demand for it goes down. It’s a hard thing to balance in an MMO. But there will definitely come a day when higher tiered weapons are added to osrs and items like whips will only be a few hundred k if that and godwars armor is only a few mill just like in RS3. Not because the items are bad, but because they become mid tier items.
---
I agree with you and op lol. I love questing and I'm happy with any continuation of a quest series, or starting new ones. Seeing how we just got TOB and a quest, probably won't get one in that series for a bit. 
---
I did four hours of it at 82 fishing and 74 hunter and was able to get 47k fishing and 60k hunter xp/hr. Using the [CML](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/suppliescalc.php) EHP rates for the skills at those levels this equates 1.19 EHP/hr (even better EHP than at 99)
---
Could the Bologa’s Blessing be revisited? I love the idea of farming your own Wines of Zamorak but the high tithe farm point cost makes it basically dead content 
---
Cataclysm when they completely revamped the skill tree is when the game for me, and probably a good half the of playerbase, started to decline.
---
Blizzard wanted to tone down the complexity of wow so that it would be less intimidating, but that's part of what a lot of people liked. The ability to fine tune your spec was really appealing to a lot of people.
---
hes live on twitch and alive lmao
---
I'm not sure if you realize this, but ranged is fucking broken rn
---
Any thoughts on adding a prayer renewal potion? Can add a new high tier herb and would really only devalue prayer flicking to save prayer points.
---
Or some sentient plant and it damages you if you don't have the level
---
Think it would be better the other way. Same chance, but consumes regular slaughters. Will keep the value of slaughters decently high, and eternal lower than it would be without it.
---
Make drakes drop them and make drakes drop like 5-10 Ash when killed like it comes from their outer hides 
---
What lol
---
50/50
---
The way I understood it, classic Runescape was supposed to have have been a relic of the past. It would have been remembered fondly like the pile of games on addicting games had it not been for the ability to save your progress and consistent updates. It was those two little advantages that gave the Gowers a chance.
---
Is this an accurate retelling?
---
WE PAY
---
I think it needs to be beefed up about 15%  
---
I like the content of zeah I'm not the biggest fan of the layout or the faction which are things that felt more like a large waste of time then anything. 
---
What turns me off about vanilla wow is that I can't see blizzard adding unique updates to it like Jagex has for scape.  It seems like the only content blizzard knows how to create is a full expansion with new territory and a big new bad guy who will die at the end, even though it would build a better story if they didn't just set big bad boy up to die in a year or two.  
---
Hespori is less than a week old. 
---
Yeah, I'd drop those chaps and wrap my mouth on that cock in a heartbeat too!

so encourage people to buff their dragon knives even more 
---
The real morning wood.
---
Name comes up on HCIM leaderboards.
---
It was 2012. The world was going to end anyway. 
---
Not just blowpipe
---
Don't have nothing against it, however it seems like netflix just includes it to be more appealing to masses = more cash grab.
---
I'd like it to get buffed up a bit more. Not sure how but that's not my department 
---
Honestly idc what is on the drop table as long as the value is returned to what it originally was. 
---
Money cape would have a right click teleport.
---
Emblem that can be used to skip a task without points.
---
Emblem to extend current task by 50% of original assigned number.
---
Metal plating that can be added to cannon furnace to increase cannonball capacity to 60 but makes the furnace degrade after a number of hours. 
---
Scroll ribbons, used to tie up clue scrolls you have on task to you can carry more than one. A clue cannot be opened if you have one already open ofc.
---
Same tale with Vorkath
---
Please for the love of God 
---
I love [This guy's ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/af1l00/konar_quo_maten_drop_table_suggestions/).
---
I would also like to see SAND somewhere other than sand pits. Doesn't need to be a TON of it....But not having to collect ALL 100k  for 99 crafting would be wonderful.
---
Upping the herb seed drops would be great. If we had the option for 100-200 herbs, maybe up the total to where it would be possible to get 100-200 herbs from the seeds. 
---
100-200 noted charged orbs of any type would be nice. Running down to charge them in the wilderness is pretty terrible.
---
A lot of people have suggested the chatbox message. I agree with that.
---
Without this, OsRs would have never existed.
---
Why? Why do we need to add an item the is exclusive to skilling to PVM?
---
Why do you need to regularly plant either of those? You can re-harvest bushes.
---
I mean sure, but thats literally everything in life, you gotta do things you dont want to do to get to things you want to do, especially in a progression-based game.
---
Like its impossible to cater to everybody, slayer is most peoples favorite skill too
---
A unique item that can be used in the (insert slot here) to increase how long mobs stay aggroed on the player. Go back to herbs but decrease amount to around 50 which is less than a normal herb run yeild. Make a notification for when you hit the rare drop table considering we are killing mobs in new areas we don't have to know all the drop tables. Increase the amount of alchables. Add a unique currency that you can trade in by slayer master area for various things maybe slayer xp, slayer points, general xp. 
---
r/technicallytrue
---
The millennial version of broke is not being able to afford a family or house.  
---
Probably because mining doesn’t have anything as rapid as barb fishing. Just my best guess though. 
---
I love the idea of cannonballs and gems other than sapphires emeralds rubies and diamonds
---
Dont see why that change is necessary.
---
I’d like to open a discussion and see what you guys think about warding taking place at new monoliths. I propose that it should take place at the runecrafting altars.
---
this is probably the most ignorant comment in this thread
---
ge stand
---
People's problem with the herb drops wasn't the value of the drops, but the fact that it dropped herbs. I suggest increasing the seed drops to reflect the value that was originally in the table (5-10 for everything except for magic seeds, which should probably be closer to 3-6). 
---
Having high value drops makes it much more exciting when you get them. If you have to make them more rare to balance this, that's fine, but as it is, all drops are currently in the "Oh, another 50k drop, whatever" range. Keep the average value per kill the same, but make the drop table more exciting by having occasional high value drops.
---
That being said, the Konar drop table is an excellent idea that has revitalized my drive to grind slayer. I'll definitely be getting 99 this semester thanks to this update. 
---
Congrats lmao. I met my friend on RS who works besides me right now. We didn't have to ruin our bodies to have everyone know we're flaming homos tho.
---
No man I'm curious on "my kind" now please go on lmao
---
im fine with most secondaries except zammy wines, they should stay semi hard to get
---
Why can't you go into the abyss?
---
Waar, maar wie gebruikt er nou "neuk" om te schelden in het nederlands
---
Its fake bait...
---
Can you make it so duradel can assign hydras? He is the highest level slayer master so surely he should assign the highest level monster.
---
This may be considered a bit iron memey, But perhaps some Air/Fire orbs?, There is an increasing amount of battlestaves coming into the game and not enough orbs to support it. It is a heavily botted area that could perhaps be less profitable by adding them to this drop table.
---
Yeah he’s backwards lol
---
After today's hotfix it's around the same average value as the original table. 
---
22.4k
---
perhaps not this portal but another method that fits the farming guild. Try other worlds - it's not totally rammed with people.
---
It's not that much more exp than mahoganies but you also unlock an instanced redwood tree, which is useful. 
---
Herb lore seconds is a top tier idea, some are just so tedious to collect right now
---
Yea, but I dare you to go look outside at a McDonalds right now, I'll bet you there's a line wrapping around the building as we speak.
---
The point is brand awareness.  If you tried opening a restaurant offering fast burgers, you're dead.  But the fact that it's McDonald's, that's 90% of your income right there.
---
The same thing, a bit off topic, but if you tried to create a game with the mechanics of Runescape, you're game is not going to survive.  But since it's Runescape, that's all you need baby.
---
This may not be the best place it could be implemented, but what about adding Blue Dragon Scales to the table as a resource drop? With the introduction of the farming guild, Blue Dragon Scales are now the only herblore secondary in the game which come exclusively from NMZ shop - shouldn't there be *some* alternative way to get them?
---
Bots don't even pick them up off the ground anymore, it's exclusively ironmen who have no logical way of obtaining them.
---
At times, it’s the best item you can buy from the reward shop. There’s no need to kill another skilling exclusive item 
---
Is this a fucking joke?
---
POGGERSSSS :0000 EKX DEEE

Fake

My Arm's Big Adventure
---
That's fair. Do you have an idea of what you think the average value of the drops should be and how much the most valuable ones should be? 
---
Lots of people checking his stream now if he's dead or not, 200 IQ tactic.
---
But he is lying in the sense that he is claiming there is a problem there when there is not. 
---
&gt;and see what happens
---
Death. Death is what happens. 
---
Lookin fresh, my dude.
---
Stake my bank 
---
trolling fuckers
---
It's not that I can't, but with only having 30hp, my odds of surviving long enough to pass a trap to get to the dark mage aren't very high
---
Nice dude, got my farm pet earlier this morning! Mine was incredibly undeserved at level 72.... Please don't kill me reddit
---
Yeah if Warding fails I think Konar would be a nice place to put them. Though I wouldn't mind them maybe moving the Slayer and Black Masks imbues over. Feels more fair for those things specifically to come from slayer content.
---
Also 60k/h is assuming you dont cut the fish and just drop them.
---
troll ya fucker
---
Have a super rare drop that unlocks black graceful. Untradeable of course. 
---
No, eternal versions of anything are retarded imo. they should at least be charged by the item its replacing.
---
Drop rope and crude chair for everyone
---
I don't either, I was just quoting from the OP
---
!!!! XDDDD exks de
---
More or less to understand why are they so eager to get more money than they need.
---
Can we please change the model for the ferocious gloves(currently bracelets) to actual GLOVES [something like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/afo5r8/please_fix_the_ferocious_gloves_suggestion/?st=JQWLFWWN&amp;sh=8608c8f7) (example not made by me) 
---
You have no clue how data usage works lol
---
Support.
---
I think that might be the solution. I'm now realising that RS3 graphics would probably just take away the 'oldschool' feel of OSRS.
---
Its 2019, max your favour you impressively hyper observant peasant 
---
Id rather have the 2008 hd graphics.
---
I'd say climbing boots/rock climbing boots?
---
Are you jebrim or something, you’re equally as retarded
---
What about unique equipment as drops that improve your time on Konar tasks?
---
**Vial of Lava**: Can be used on the Brimstone ring to give it 10% chance to penetrate ranged and melee defenses as well, making it a true hybrid ring.
---
**Volcanic Crystal**: Attachment to boots of Stone which allows you to deal 5% more damage to creatures in the Karuulm Volcano. 
---
**Bracelet of Magma**: 10% chance when casting a spell to deal 10 damage over time, hitting 2 damage every second for 5 seconds on Monsters Only. Ideally, this bracelet could help bring magic up to par with melee and range on slayer tasks. 
---
**Ring of Balance**: 1/8 chance of causing your next hit to heal you for half of the damage you've dealt, with the effect only being able to be proc'd against creatures Konar has currently assigned you to kill. ( this gives a bit more incentive to use Konar without increasing xp/h. Konar is meant to make/save you gp. This saves you a bit of food using Konar tasks only)
---
god forbid you have to spend an extra 3 MINUTES after a task to climb down a ladder to open a crate. I honestly think it'd be a lot more entertaining as you can collect several keys after 5+ tasks and take them all down and see what you get. Efficiencyscape will be the death of this game imho
---
I've done about 4 tasks and have been decently unlucky with getting one of the new drops so I feel like if I get a drop anywhere between 200k-2 mill would make it a lot more exciting. 
---
Are you an ironman btw
---
“Hm I don’t remember Brine Rats dropping 138 Torstols... but who knows”
---
High risk worlds mean that in the wildy, doing regular pking, you cannot pray item. This is not the same as a pvp world where you can attack people anywhere. 
---
B0ATY DEAD HE CAN’T BELIEVE IT OSRS HCIM JAGEX
---
We're down for adding Konar's shield and an item that converts a Dragon hasta to match hers. What kind of stats would you see them having? 
---
How about the cape has an ornate jewelry box equipped to it, and it has a right click option to teleport quickly to the last place you chose.
---
https://imgur.com/a/3npgwJV Cloud had a really good idea on vamping the drop table. I’d suggest giving it a look. 
---
Boy have I been doin slayer wrong then
---
Farming contracts.
---
They should get rid of the doors completely.
---
orbs, zammy wines, and volcanic ash would have my vote 100%
---
Theres a deposit box in lumby
---
Yeah but I was just rambling trying to get it all out I wasn't very concerned about punctuation. Plus I was in a doctor's office waiting room lol
---
Because it makes sense to add that to her droptable, based on the location of the Slayer master, and because the fastest way to get Volcanic Ash is by mining it yourself and thereby being forced to compete with bots, or doing Volcanic Mine. It's a very limited item, and it doesn't have to be like that. If this was the case for all skilling related items, we wouldn't even get any herbs from Slayer or PVM because seeds gives herbs so why should Slayer? Same goes for ore drops. You can mine ores so why should we be able to get them from Slayer? It's literally the same argument. 
---
Eckz reeee!
---
I like the idea and agree the Crystal bow could do with some love - but I see this as more fitting for the upcoming Song of the Elves and Priffdinas release. 
---
I can switch between data/wifi fine. I always afk nmz on my house on wifi then I can take my phone throw it in my truck and still stay in nmz while it switches over to LTE (there is like a 1second lag spike when it switches over)
---
Also this game barely uses any data!! You will use less than 100mb in a month of heavy use.
---
got mine for 2.7m few days ago
---
I agree. But there is level requirements for the areas
---
Pog
---
I have this problem too.
---
I wish I would’ve known this, now I just feel like a dirty whore.
---
Yeah... it's not quite Cookie Clicker level of AFK.
---
Congrats!! I recently just finished an Abby demons task that I left incomplete for a long time. About 5 kills in I got a superior and when I killed it it dropped a whip :D.
---
Selling the other 15 trout
---
These are the responses I was hoping to receive by posting this :D
---
This. If you are slaying efficiently, you shouldnt be using any other gloves besides the slayer bracelets.
---
1 No herb drops 
---
2 noted bone/ use for bones 
---
3 less supply drops 
---
4 less supply drops
---
5 less supply drops
---
Why is Netflix criticizing its own original show...?
---
Completely agree. 
---
Drakes dropping infernal ashes would be such a great idea. 
---
Ah I hear you, good point.
---
Tekton is a massive asshole. Really high defence means with him dwh pretty much is mandatory. You also have to be pretty much perfect otherwise he goes back to the anvil and not only heals, but resets his defense and enrages, so he does more damage and has even more defense. For starting out I'd avoid him. Scouting raids can be the worst part imo. 
---
You know those monsters with level 180 on the TzHaar Fight Cave? They are called Yt-MejKot.
---
go to runelites github and suggest favours a feature for the diaries
---
When I'm on mobile, doing someone a favor by taking time out of my day to explain the plot of a story the last fucking thing I care about is punctuation. It was a rambling sentence, trying to get out the entirety of the plot, in a TL;DR type of way.
---
it is pay to win
---
Daaaaaaaamn... That blows.
---
It’s nonexistent for mobs under 75. Hit it MAYBE once in 200kills 
---
Second this, please make it happen Jagex.
---
Well it eliminates the predatory 3rd party markets which tend to hack accounts or rely on Sand Casino to funnel them gold.
---
Additionally, as someone who came back to the game after getting my first OSRS acct hacked, spending $40 on some Bonds made the game FAR more enjoyable in the beginning.
---
Now I have my Mortyania Hard Diaries done and can make a cool 1m/hr doing Barrows runs.
---
While I don't agree with dropping $200 on Bonds if you want to subsidize the early game slowness with a little income boost then by all means fuck it.
---
Maybe next to the items that some requested an addition (will take time) For example, if you have a blue dragon task you have a chance to have an item from the base drop table or the blue dragon konar thing, which would include something like noted blue dhide, dbones or scales. Make it partially monster specific?
---
Can we add a new f2p boss in the wilderness at the bandit camp by the pool something like a frog boss idea which drops various rings with low stats like +1 range +1strength +1magic or defensive and attack stat rings. Currently f2p does only have rings without any stats.
---
It also will increas wilderness activity in F2p.
---
Add them to warding. Also, any chance of old guilds updated/new guilds introduced? Sucks only a small amount of skills have guilds ingame
---
dont they have to click accept?
---
Id get 2 def
---
Volcanic Ash is incredibly good money for the skill requirement. I'm not sure I want a decent low-level skilling money making method to be completely ruined like that, considering how sparse those are as is.
---
Herb secondaries, particularly Unicorn Horns, Red Spiders Eggs and Blue Scales  I'm fine with as they kinda come from PvM related activities anyway.
---
Between 8500 and 10000 he loses count and starts over.
---
Why are leftists places like Netflix so obsessed with sex 
---
It was realistic to me, I had a good time in high school. That comment was relevant because you seem to be hinting that everyone had a bad high school experience. 
---
No it’s not the same argument. The community is complaining about devaluing skilling, yet you want to add a skilling exclusive item to a PVM drop table.
---
I've only done like 10 farming contracts and have 5 hespori seeds. Unless I'm getting really lucky, it seems like the drop rate is pretty generous. At this rate, Ill just be able to plant a new hespori every time I kill the last.
---
That area needs no rejuvenation though. There's people getting fire capes and doing Jad tasks constantly, not to mention Inferno runs, or bursting TzHaar tasks, or leveling thieving. And call me old fashioned, but I thought a boss was supposed to be something that required skill :thinking: 
---
An untradable unique add on to Slayer helm that gives some sort of extra accuracy or damage increase. 
---
!remindme in 1 day
---
I'd like to see some uniques 
---
Removal of common skilling items i.e iron ore
---
Added new untradable farming guild seeds
---
Increase in minimum items received for seeds
---
&gt; JohnSina420
---
Thanks! my IGN is HarmlessTwig
---
all monsters w/ a rare seed table (shamans, gorillas, vorkath, hydra) should have it.
---
the wiki lists redwood and dragonfruits but not celastrus.
---
6 months? I would've just bought 3 bonds and not wasted as much time
---
Well if we're talking a TzHaar Scimitar it would likely be mid-level so you wouldn't compare to Whips. Also, you're making a lot of assumptions just to say it wouldn't work...
---
If it is an Obby Scim, it wouldn't be as strong as the D Scim since Obby are nowhere close to Dragon in stats. It would just be an upgrade to the Obby Sword and keep the same balance with the D Scim.
---
If it isn't an Obby weapon, we wouldn't have to worry about the Armor and Amulet. It could even just be a "trimmed D Scim". Or even a Level 50 or 65 Scimitar instead of Level 60 since I never said new scimitar had to be Obsidian... Anyway, there is room for new weapons; the question is what we'd want it to do.
---
Hello,
---
I put this suggestion out a few days after the update and got quite a lot of support. It focuses on making the Konar Drop Table feel more organic, mainly in terms of how you receive the loot.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aepy82/the_tasakaal_cache_key/
---
As opposed to the exorbitant amount of skilling supplies provided by monsters assigned by Kona why not use this opportunity to introduce the skilling catalysts suggested on this subreddit previously? Not only will this provide Konar assigned monsters with an entirely unique reward and thus an incentive to have her as your slayer master, but it will also incentivise players to skill and utilise their skilling catalysts.
---
I have used the level boosts/done dungeons to Max level and done end game pvp, just fails to interest me.
---
To tell us he thinks the new pearl drop rate is ok despite others complaints because other stuff will help it retain its value. I don't really know what he's talking about but I disagree.
---
He’s referring to a pre-eoc potion that would slow the drain rate of your prayer/ slowly tick it up. 
---
Gz my dude, you should get your rc level up, over a mil an hour doing astrals at 82 and even more with other runes at higher levels, it’s a great consistent money maker.
---
And so another God has fallen
---
But the question is. does jagex takes the time to read this and unban my account? that would be AWESOME!
---
I'm amazed this is still going strong. Love it.

What is a mid-level account? I consider myself to be mid and I find myself with a plethora of things to do.

"eliminates"

lmao

Hey look. Finally somebody on here with stats like mine. I play so casually it hurts sometimes.

i've never understood people that want to enforce grammar norms on internet comments, LEL, as if the world really even cares

Somebody get woox to verify this isnt photo shopped
---
I buy out jagex because in 2054 i'm a billionaire due to knowing how to play the lottery like a pro 
---
There is a massive, massive, massive evolution every player goes through while killing Zulrah.   First kill will take anywhere from 20-50 tries, then you get your next 5 kc while growing your confidence, then every kill after that you wonder what took you so long.
---
you're fine dude.   be fully prepared to die a lot before your first kill, and then once it happens, everything clicks.   it happens to everyone 
---
Is it though? When high slayer unlocks the ability to do a lot of content that makes money (hydra, cerb). Gives mid level players a chance for a nice monetary boost while on the grind to higher levels. Feels like you cant accumulate any wealth until you have max stats 
---
I’ve had 82 slayer at like 1600 total then got kraken with a +5 boost. I mean there’s tons of other slayer content too before 87, that was just the first boss that popped into my head cause I rushed slayer when I was building my main lol
---
Y Fletch?
---
1) Seeds are an incredibly rare drop
---
2) Master farmers give seeds not on the Konar table
---
3) You get seeds at a WAY faster rate at master farmers, provided you have 94 Thieveing + Ardy 3 or 99 with Rogues
---
You're always going to need to do master farmers if you want the best seed rates.
---
He has a bit of a point, why add it to slayer? You can already get just about everything from slayer, maybe miningtodt if that ever comes out?
---
Cant u buy them like eclectics?
---
I think it only annoys those who are easily annoyed
---
What nerf?
---
Personally, I think it's fine at the moment. 
---
In my opinion the community is way overreacting by stating she's dead content. 
---
Lets be honest here, Konar was never meant to be "the best" slayer master. She is the third best slayer master with a requirement of only 75 combat. 
---
When I read the [The Kebos Lowlands blog](https://services.runescape.com/m=news/poll-blog-the-kebos-lowlands?oldschool=1), I never expected the droptable to be so excessive. After all, she has a relatively low requirement to use, so you wouldn't expect high-end tier drops from her, now would you?
---
The blog itself describes it as "Generic loot meant as a slight increase to your profits, including food to sustain you on your task.", plus "A rare chance of getting a new unique drop of the tradeable 1-handed Dragon hasta".
---
Maybe I've misunderstood the words "Generic loot", but how did some of the things on the original droptable fall under generic loot, especially in those large quantities? It also implied to be an uncommon drop to give that "slight increase", where the only big value item would be the broken Dragon Hasta.
---
I don't think she's dead content at all, she fills an interesting niche by offering more task variety. In return you'll get more slayer points and a chance for this bonus drop table. For end-game players she's interesting because of the task-only hydra boss, who will most likely skip most of the tasks anyway to get that hydra task.
---
For now, I would suggest to leave her be and check back in February to see how she does. 
---
Yes, skill not massive skill! But besides tokkul in my opinon is kind of useless to farm so it would be a cool idea for people to kill them for that specific reasons to fight this new boss! 
---
Yeah I’ve done like 9 tasks maybe since the nerf which isn’t much but only got one drop from the new table. Idk tho if his shit was dropping like crazy or the subreddit just made it seem that way. 
---
Lava dragons and revs lol
---
Shut up Ser-... oh
---
so add on, i think there should be drop unique untradeable drop that creates something in the cape slot to be an upgrade between avas accumulator and assembler, maybe some sick looking quiver for arrows or something of the sort.
---
It says leave UP TO 10m, that doesnt mean prepaying would cost you 10m on a single death, your death items will be payed for up front and you will be subtracted by the amount of the g.e. wealth after death.
---
This makes no sense.
---
I believe you can say it both ways. It's weird because you don't say: "They play tennis with a tennis." but you can say "I played football with a football."
---
Not sure of this though. 
---
Did they nerf Konar’s slayer points? Or just the drop table?
---
It’s going to depend on why you’re doing the tasks. If you’re going for xp, stick with Nieve for sure. If you’re trying to rack up points to get Slayer upgrades/blocks, I’d say just use Konar until you can afford whatever it is you’re trying to get. If it’s about gp, I’d say also stick with Nieve until you can use Duradel.
---
Let us know how this turned out
---
I mean she never was worth using. But go ahead and try if you want to use her.
---
I'm glad to see that they are being looked at to being added, those were my favorite for the longest time!
---
The point of Konar is not to boost your income, it is to give you variety in your slayer tasks. 
---
Exactly. Secondaries would be amazing for ironmen, but over time not so much for regular players. That's why the uniques and/or alchables are good for regulars bcs they will have a more stable value. 
---
As an ironmen getting some secondaries is just so tedious and doesn't grant you any (direct) experience. Think about red spider eggs, shrooms, zammy wines, blue scales,.. all that kinda jazz. Imo it wouldn't be bad to focus this droptable to mid-level players and iron men (in a way ironmen are happy with the same things as mid level players).
---
I agree with that, but 2 seems a little low 5 minimum imho up to 15? Assuming 10 herbs per seed that's still below the original amount given...
---
Yeah, sure... Look at herb prices on GE-Tracker after the update, my friend
---
its only 5-7m an hr at revs if u pay for protection
---
invest in law runes
---
It will be interesting to see if they take the runescape route or the Everquest route. With RuneScape the route I mean, release classic, and progress the game from there in a totally different direction than retail. They could do what Everquest is doing with the TLP servers where they are basically rereleasing the game on the players schedule.
---
I don’t think classic is going to be a huge success tbh. I feel like the only people that are going to tough it out and end up even clearing basic content like MC or ZG are going to be such a small minority that it won’t last long unless they tune the game for 10/20 man stuff. People forget how horrendously hard it was to not only reach max level, but to then get geared, and to follow that up with getting forty people that could log on and know the fights every week was such a huge pain in the ass.
---
I just really don't like people screaming their heads off when they are clearly uninformed. I like it even less when they vote that way. If you say you think about the questions and read stuff then I guess I believe you, but you do seem rather ill-informed on this issue, especially if you think the drop table was fine as it was. My guess is you haven't been playing long enough to understand the repercussions of it, which is fine, but I'd advise actually looking at threads detailing what the problem really was. Contrary to popular belief, it's not high level players trying to keep mid level players down. 
---
preferably something more akin to a ring of suffering with recoils than an eternal expeditious/slaughter.
---
Well Vorkath is like 150k/kill including Visages at 30 kills/hr
---
Zulrah is slightly over 150k/kill including uniques at 30-32 kills/hr
---
Demonics is about 70k/kill at 60 kills/hr (100 if alting but no one does that tbf)
---
DKS is 33 kills/hr for each king so Bones + Rings is about 3m/hr, slightly less than Vorkath bc BRings dropped compared to what I thought they were worth.
---
Kree'Arra is 260k/kill ish from uniques not counting the arguably neglible drops from minions and that's about 24ish kills/hr, but you spend like 1-2m on black chins
---
Cerberus Crystals are 62k/kill at 60 kills/hr
---
Hydra is about 5.5m/hr atm according to woox
---
Rev Clans say it's up to 7m/hr
---
Right click 
---
Then on the broadcast you see "April fool's!"
---
idk why you were downvoted lol
---
Damn, no void at all? I'm just most worried about running out of supplies without the extra inv space, but I suppose the better defence from the better gear would help alleviate that a bit. Looks like I'm going with brimstone, seeing as the only thing I lack for max str is avernic+infernal.
---
Someone else said to learn 1:0 with elder maul before moving to 4:1 with the Lance, so I'll swoop up one and try to figure out running the head ASAP because that's my biggest weakness.
---
I'll take any resources you can give me to learn as much as I can. I'll send you a friend request on Discord when I can, it'll be the same name as this. 
---
Who cares how new or old the content is? My point is, there's plenty of mid level PvM, contrary to the circle jerk. 
---
herbi and aerial fishing are both bad for ironmen
---
What is it like 1/1m ?
---
The order is important
---
Like everyone else here already said - the original droptable value was fine, but the drops themselves were just skilling resources.
---
Noted rune equipment drops and unnoted dragon ones should be added. Also, Obsidian equipment IMO kind of make sense to be in the droptable, especially with the proposed suggestion of u/Xytherior. 
---
I also read someone suggest making superiors have a slight increased spawn chance whilst on a Konar Task, also a nice suggestion.
---
Then dont speak unless you have a counter arguement I guess? Pretty simple stuff.
---
I got a hasta on a fire giant prior to the nerf. Drops were real. 
---
Very big yes as to a Clue Scroll increase. Maybe even high tier drops possible (elite/masters at slim and very slim chances).
---
Remember when eso released and everyone shit on it weird how its at the top now
---
I really dislike the idea of using 3rd party client, so I don't scout. Too bad Jagex won't fix it completely though.
---
any investment is a risk, you just have to figure out what you think will go up, have some logic behind it, and hope that you are right.
---
Fishy fishy
---
I never thought of it that way. It did become apparent that YouTube was run by advertisers these past years though. 
---
Lmfao true! I figjred I missed some, that was just off the top of my head. 
---
I also wanna know the effect over other drops, my impression is that i got fewer javelin shafts this time comparing to pre-Kebos
---
Slayer for money. So nieve it is. 
---
I didn't know what Lucky imps gave until I looked it up. Apparently they give one roll on the drop table of any clue scroll, easy to master, and there's an equal chance to roll into each tier's clue scroll table
---
One of my favorite thing to do is to dislike videos from small youtubers that don't have a lot of views. Thanks for the link! Awesome video btw =)
---
I would confidently call it a more "modern" freaks and geeks. It explores the relationships of 16-18 year olds, focusing primarily on sexual/romantic relationships but touches on platonic friendships as well.
---
Just like freaks and geeks it presents this from the point of view of a few different characters with different upbringings and life situations.
---
Bad pkers make up more of the playerbase than good pkers 
---
How? It's the same boring tasks just making you do it in a shitty location. 
---
Link someone killing zulrah under 100 combat with no gear and no food then, if you can literally do it naked 
---
Do it yourself
---
I'm not very good at understanding spoken english but I could try. What's your clan chat if you don't mind me guesting?

Can we get updated task weightings for Duradel that includes Drakes &amp; Wyrms?

You stole this idea from someone else who posted about Hespori yesterday.

Don’t worry I am too. Takes even more attention than Vork lmao.

Weird question but which dark mode is this?
---
thanks a bunch, friend!
---
The amount dropped at its current rarity would probably have been no more than a 2gp loss in price assuming not as many people do Konar slayer in the future.
---
Yeah Soup used it the other day. It looks like after the "is it real" discussion from the 2.5k brews and Curtis making a fake ely screenshot that was slowly improved over time, B0aty decided to get in on the action.
---
Then someone saw his bait tweet and ran with it. Because free karma.

societal rot like this does not spell a bright future for western civilization. I want to go live in a country more in line with my thinking but I feel trapped in America

I can see the pixels 
---
Could the amount of Grape Seeds you get from the Tithe Farm be increased? 2 points for 1 Seed is extremely unreasonable, and because of this the availability of the seeds is extremely poor, which causes the vinery to be dead content.
---
Alternatively, they could be given by farming contracts or Hespori.
---
That’s so sweet! Some of the best people I’ve met are on RS.

Drake is pretty well known for this. At least on reddit anyways.

Though I don't really think it should come from slayer. A tool belt would be cool.

insane.

I cackled 
---
This part made me so mad that I alched my cat
---
There's no reason it can't be balanced for both. For normal accounts the gp value of the drop is pretty much all that matters so there is a lot of leeway to what can fill that gap.
---
Well, it's basically just a waste of time I'm thinking. Loot is rarely above 100k, and in that time you spent planting and preparing and talking, you could generally kill a profitable boss for over 100k anyway. I've got my palms and magic trees growing in guild

I really like how easy to see the fishing spots are at Aerial Fishing. Could the same graphic be used for all other spots too? Particularly on mobile the sparkly water fishing spots are quite hard to see.
---
Gotta get my spunk tasting good somehow. 
---
I'm pretty comfortable with a BP at shamans, just from 3k kc on em normally lol. Mystics might slap me around when luring though, so I'll keep that in mind. Quick question, is it worth it to use a serp helm for shamans and olm when learning/in general, to save the inventory space, or just use a sanfew? 
---
Its relevant because it supports my initial point that you should always be using bracelets, no matter the task. 
---
There are no efficient melee tasks you do that you don't also cannon, so having a glove switch is unnecessarily difficult and not worth using. 
---
😂😂😂
---
Just gotta do it bud. In 13 years of gaming I HATED questing. I dreaded it, till I found slayermusiq and I now have my quest cape. He’s made questing so easy, fun, and enjoyable for me. Quests that I thought were INSANELY difficult are so easy with him as a guide. They’re a lot of fun and I wish there was more. I made a zerker just so I can do them again lol
---
If they creator has their own youtube channel, I believe, if they wanted to, they could copywrite claim that video. I am under the impression that anyone who is featured in these clips is okay with it.
---
I also think these channels do a good thing for lesser known content creators, as they do not only feature big names. If you are pulling 10 viewers a night and have a highlight worthy moment, you will be seen by 30k+ people. I think the lesser known creators would be hurt if these channels got taken down. Lets keep the underdogs in mind too who benefit from these channels, as the pro's the little guys get I think greatly outweigh the 'cons' that the top dogs experience. 
---
And ores respawn faster in the guild, that made 2 tick iron ore a thing.
---
Just how young are Netflix staff?
---
Just JUAAAN more kill!
---
Or skeletal wyverns. a 100 skeletal wyverns task is outlandish. All of your ideas were good, I just can't get behind extending tasks *even more*. 
---
Just stop embarrassing yourself
---
Nah man you're fine that's exactly the same wall that everyone hits.   Personally, before I started doing serious attempts, I got my agility up to 76 because doing the summer pie thing every trip is just a complete pain in the ass, and it gave me an excuse to watch some TV I meant to catch up on.
---
The one tip that helped me a lot was: ***stick to the priority***.    Change your prayer first,   change your position second, and worry about changing your gear last.    As long as you have the correct prayer and standing in the correct spot, THEN you can worry about your damage output.  
---
After recent events, it is clear that the only people at jagex truely hear/listen to is Reddit and Streamers.  Though the loudest, they are not strictly the voice of the community. My suggestion, turn the second log in screen with the big red button into a community tab. Use this reach out to the actual silent majority of players. Give a way for players to give feedback and suggestions. Most players dont use reddit/twitch/twitter. 
---
The Blue Dragon cutoff is 65 cb. The task is just "Blue Dragons" not Brutal Blue Dragons specifically, but catacombs doesn't have regular blue drags
---
Scale to slayer would be better. I think one or two high value drops would be better than raising the average drop.
---
What about a Xerics Talismen teleport to the kebos lowlands somewhere with the unlock being dropped via her table?
---
Can we please get the farming guild doors fixed? Its possible for one player to prevent others from using the doors by spam clicking it.
---
Hi,
---
Thank you for putting this out there to receive community feedback. 
---
I feel that the values on the drop table were a little too high. When seeing the posts here it felt like “holy crap I need to get in on this immediately!” I was working and had a strong feeling it would get nerfed. That tells me it was maybe too valuable.
---
That said, I feel like the nerf was a bit of a panic nerf and it was nerfed very hard. The new mystic? Looks cool but it won’t replace my better mage gear.  Which means at best, it’s for fashion scape.
---
I’d like to see the new table strike a balance between a drop that’s got some decent value. Say, 5 ranarr seeds. Nobody is going to be upset receiving that drop. It’s a lovely drop for ironmen and regular accounts can cash them in at the G.e for some coin or use them for farming. That, however, I don’t think will sustain the new slayer master long term. I’d love to see UNTRADABLE uniques added with quite high rarity. Give players a reason to keep grinding that slayer master to receive the uniques. Making them untradable means player x can’t just go farm Zulrah for a bit and then buy the new items. I think that could be good for the long term health of the slayer master.
---
I do believe that the loot table should have items that are beneficial to a mid level account and nice to have on a high level account. We got the hydra and all of its lovely drops for high end accounts. With the players who came in on mobile, it would be nice if aside from loot they will sell, there was an item that makes them go “oh man I gotta get my hands on that!”
---
Bro
---
Clip?
---
Yeah and a drop table shouldnt be based arround if bots are doing it or not. There is bots for everything in this game so content shouldnt be focused arround that
---
Well tbf, there's the meme of 92 being half of 99; meaning getting a 90 in a skill is really not *that* difficult^*, and like half of that for 85. This game shouldn't be trying to pump out gear/content that players will only use for a very short period of time.
---
When was the last time you killed a Jelly? And how long do you remember using a dragon scimmy for, before upgrading to a whip? I don't understand things like the dragon hasta - the zammy hasta is just a few weeks away (obv not for btws).
---
^* RC/Mining/Agility excluded as exp/hr isn't very great
---
its in line with the rest of th crash because of the new kebos update. its a good time to buy some gear and weapons in general
---
I feel happy to be a noob forever for that exact reason. I have 1900 total and still ask stupid questions and die at Jad and am having such fun in this game. Preach.
---
Any chance we can make an easier way to switch between oily/non oily fishing rods? I have the pearl fishing rod but would need to grind another if I'd want to switch between infernal and sacred eels.
---
I mean you don't even need the 64 to kill someone with that combo lmao
---
only real players know exactly whats on the tile 205 west and 36 south of the center of varrock fountain lmfao

44 rc then craft Nats, fish lobsters.. I think fetching and stringing longbow is still profitable.. 70-99 fletching should net you about 15m.

There is already a teleport to it on the blessing from the Kourend Diary. 3 per day with hard diary and unlimited with elite diary. Fairy Ring CIR is also very close, followed by the farming guild teleport on the skills necklace and farming skillcape
---
The cursor is over melee prayer but top left says magic pray, 0 hp is kinda scuffed, hitsplats and hp bar are quite obvious and the activate windows bottom left
---
&gt;Pure essence has been reduced from a weighting of 5 to 1 on Konar's table, meaning it'll drop less often.
---
RIP fellow iron men.
---
I still feel it’s just a pain to access. Only one tele the on the normal spellbook and you have to unlock it. No tabs to different areas. Everything else is jewellery or xerics or from quests and makes it feel weird compared to everywhere else. I can’t work out when I’m meant to telly somewhere or run there, I think I’m struggling to understand the scale of it in comparison to like Varrock to Falador
---
Oh I see why it’s an issue now 
---
It has a lot of content, but at least in bfa it feels like there is so little content that you actually want to do/that is "worth it" to do.
---
so, smite DOES work on olm, interesting..
---
Cool I won’t get stacks of 5k air/fire runes anymore! Thanks jagex! :D
---
The pure essence change is a nerf to iron men
---
I've got a post asking about solo raids up right now but, how viable is a tassets switch? Normally I wear neitz and bring ancestral top and bottom, Arma top and bottom, BCP, then all the capes, neck slots, pegs+prims, a mage shield and ddef, zerker i, and if course weapons +dwh. Is the tassets/glove swap worth the extra spot?
---
My trio group all wears this, so I was just wondering if we can do something better. 
---
Yo I haven't downvoted you, but I'm just letting you know that he hasn't has been upvoted because he was making a joke and yours was not.
---
It's not a 50/50 because we don't live in a binary world, it's 1/5000 objectively. It's easy to say that it either happens or it doesn't, but there's more to statistics than that.
---
Veracs at kc, totally insane
---
Just make sure you got an extra ecumenical key banked 
---
The player base doesn’t want unique updates added to the classic wow servers. 
---
People also feel like they can't PvM if they don't have max gear, like it is going to suddenly make them good at the game. 
---
Go to the DPS calculator and compare Arma to blessed dhide, fighter torso and only legs to Bandos, ahrims to ancestral. 
---
Is the max gear better? Yes. Is it enough to make a boss significantly easier?  In most cases the differences are negligible. 
---
Get (elite) void and fighter torso, earn enough for zenytes, bp, trident, BGS, whip, ahrims, and blessed dhide then you can start pretty much all PvM so long as you have decent stats. 
---
Based on data available on the wiki:
---
Barrows piece - 6/102
---
Elite clue - 1/34
---
Crystal key - 1/17
---
D med - 1/100
---
Likelihood - 6/5,895,600 = 1/982,600
---
Almost one in a million :)
---
Original table was a good start, but here are the changes I would make:
---
\-Resources/skilling items (ores, logs, fish, etc.) should be scaled based off your level in that skill. This gives an incentive to still go out and skill and level up, while being able to acquire these resources through PvM. The higher your skill level, the higher the quantity you get from these drops.
---
\-The herbs and quantity definitely needed to be lowered, I love the seed drops currently on the table, but should be raised to 3-6 or so, remaining rare. It's still nice to occasionally get those big drops from Konar.
---
\-Secondary items for herblore, buckets of sand, cannonballs, and volcanic ash would be awesome.
---
\-Elemental Orbs.
---
\-Possibly 1 dragon med helm, legs/skirt instead of the 1-2 Rune items on the current table.
---
\-Current things like uncut rubies/diamonds, unfinished bolts, ores, and dragon arrowheads are all great.
---
Quantities and rarities of these items can be changed so the gp/hr is at a reasonable level. A similar gp/hr as the original table would be ideal, just with a few different drops (mainly the herbs).
---
In terms of bank value, i haven’t seen anyone higher, although there probably are a handful of ironmen out there with multiple tbows and scythes that can challenge this
---
Oo true. Computer incompetent people like me would believe it it you put like 5kc :p
---
you can find dagganoths in catacombs of kourend.  if they make this instanced theyd have to take away the appeal of using a dwarf cannon down there...
---
Just got my first at 407. Hydra eye :)))
---
Pretty sure those are shared yeah? So other people can deplete them from underneath you. I'm not 100% on that though, correct me if I'm wrong 
---
This was a nice interaction.
---
The people who care about small hotfixes will user twitter and reddit anyway. 
---
I record every lucky imp I open, folder full of LuckyImp48_13Trout.mp4 etc 
---
Woox. Enough said mate
---
Please be gentle.. s-..senpai
---
Why? Slayer staff e is a good upgrade to the existing slayer staff. 
---
There have been a few suggestions for expeditious and slaughter bracelet upgrades - I have a twist to go alongside that.. I would love to be able to have barrow gloves (S) that being a drop that can augment my b gloves (or any gloves) to act as a slaughter bracelet but maintain b gloves stats. This means I don't waste an inventory space bringing a bracelet and I don't have to worry about swapping gear for the killing blow. This should be able to be dismantled as well in case you don't want slaughter on any given task! Thoughts? 
---
I posted this earlier, but I will reiterate...
---
People also feel like they can't PvM if they don't have max gear, like it is going to suddenly make them good at the game.
---
Go to the DPS calculator and compare Arma to blessed dhide, fighter torso and obby legs to Bandos, ahrims to ancestral.
---
Is the max gear better? Yes. Is it enough to make a boss significantly easier? In most cases the differences are negligible.
---
Get (elite) void and fighter torso, earn enough for zenytes, bp, trident, BGS, whip, ahrims, and blessed dhide then you can start pretty much all PvM so long as you have decent stats.
---
Probably still demi-gods though hey
---
Cheers for the insight
---
Got think to back to when this quest was released , items back them where worth so much more ! 
---
I’m confused about the mining.
---
Uhhh..... No wonder I'm not getting any claws or hides... :(
---
The loot table now is a joke. No one wants mystic recolour. who even Think that was a good idea to bring? Even as a ironman mystic is SUPER easy to get. no one cares about a recolour.
---
 It was good on release - the brews.
---
i dont understand why you guys change supply drop for alchibles, Just to bring more cash into the game. Is the Point not that cash should go out of the game?
---
I can’t test it right now, but unless they changed something since last night those rates are attainable. Are you fishing west side while someone else fishes east side? Are you running to stand closer to the pools while the bird is in the air? There are a lot of factors that I see a lot of people not doing  to improve xp rates. Cutting the fish is also limited to one per tick so if you’re trying to cut instead of drop it’ll make it a lot more difficult
---
Aerial fishing may not be better than barb fishing overall but that doesn’t mean the xp should be buffed. It already offers new rewards while giving really good xp if you’re willing to put in the effort. Even still, what you said also doesn’t change the fact you were comparing incorrect rates
---
I just got the eye at 200ish kc also and then got the hydra leather 10 kills later
---
Average for herb seeds should be around 10. This is monetarily a less amount than the original table, and produces less herbs than the original(especially with chance of disease) but still provides a nice drop. 
---
Yeah but redwoods aren't really that popular and the wc boost is overpowered
---
Gratz 
---
Eternal Expeditious and Eternal Slaughter would be super good unique items to add to this drop table, they would be valuable and useful.
---
Hi I haven't done Konar yet but I just want to say you guys have been doing a fantastic job. It may not be the same game as it was growing up, but the end-game seems to have infinitely higher replay value! My one concern is that every update that introduces something makes another part of the game obsolete/inefficient. It would be great to hear your opinion on this! 
---
Can Monkey Hunting have a pet? 
---
Anteeksi, mitä vittua!
---
i got a suggestion i wanted to mention. volcanic shard. this shard is dropped by a select few creatures (you can decide). it can be combined with the wizard boots for make "magma boots". these boots offer a 1.5% damage boost plus the stats of wizard boots, making it a nice item to equip without defense stats. it can also be used with eternal boots, to create "volcanic boots". this adds a 2.5% damage boost, but adds a -2 prayer bonus and a few negative stats that you may decide. these both work as boots of stone and offer protection in the Karuulm dungeon. u/JagexGambit
---
I know you can, I got assigned them by Konar in the lighthouse and every single world has someone with a cannon.
---
Yeah that's true. I'm talking about spending around 1b on gear to see if itll rise. 
---
okay fair enough, i tried- let's wrap this up; its over
---
For DPS/cost yeah, but I'm pretty sure tryhard slayer is using slaughter on 3-4 tasks, expeditious on 4-5 tasks and skipping the rest  where possible. If money is a limitation you're probably better off putting money towards an anguish or tormented etc for bossing
---
🤣
---
 I think basket of strawberries is the most underrated item in the game.
---
Yes, but only cuz they have to. It's annoying searching through all the different mods for a "small" fix. What is the disadvantage of posting everything on the offical website?
---
I definitely didn't get the leather 10 kills later lol. Now just over 500 kc with only the eye
---
**WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK**
---
99 hp and 99 prayer. Nice try.
---
It would be nice to have the table interact with superiors in some way. Perhaps 3 rolls to hit the table on the kill (If it doesn’t work this way already).
---
You mean like a Palm Tree Seed?
---
Yeah I mean I have pretty much all that just getting the max gear I’m saying haha sorry it’s a fair point and I’m not complaining it’s just a new threshold that seems far off
---
A friend made an Ironman with fremenik places only , should be fun to watch
---
thank you 🙏
---
the lance should have a strength option, give this weapon a use for pures / zerkers and ultimately more worth as a weapon. thank you
---
BEFORE/AFTER, NOT AFTER/BEFORE 
---
Yeasaaaaa
---
I see alot of comments about scaling rewards with slayer level. I would be wary of this as players with high level slayer already unlock more profitable tasks. The great thing about konar for me was making mid level slayer feel so much more useful and less boring.
---
I’ve read a lot of people say it’s more efficient to max in NMZ then start slayer rather than do slayer from day 1 but, unless you’re at work and want to afk for 20 minutes at a time, then yeah stick to slayer imo. 
---
Is this Beans from Even Stevens?
---
*Nik Nak*
---
I'm moreso just having fun to be honest. I don't play RS NEARLY as much as I used to, so idrc if I spend a ton of money to just have fun 🤷
---
I mean 100 points is easy to earn back :)
---
have you ever seen redwoods in the wc guild? you have to walk up stairs to cut them lol
---
am iron, keep maple to redwood, Curry to Dragonfruit, Spirit tree, Calquat,
---
Teak, Mahogany and Celastrus 
---
thats 14. not really a problem though as i have the seed and Protection payment next to it so i can tell them apart
---
The only effective cure is transition or suicide, huh? Yeah I don’t buy it. How about if they received medication and therapy for their mental health. A lot of advocates claim trans people have a lot of the mental health issues—depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation—due to the fact of how they are treated by society, but I’d argue that their minds were probably already fucked up to begin with, and gender dysphoria is merely a result of those already present mental health issues. 
---
I prefaced it with “I’m not transphobic” because I do not fear theses people, nor do I have a hatred for them; I hate what our society and culture has done by indulging these people’s warped view of reality when in fact they need to get proper medical help. 
---
Aren’t you still forgetting to factor in the berserker necklace and obsidian armor set effect that makes the obby sword so good?
---
No changes to aerial fishing? There's a notable weighting towards bluegill and they give absolutely atrocious xp. Spam clicking for 11 fishing xp/cast with delay is extremely disheartening and the content is effectively unusable until 91 fishing/87 hunter because the xp rates are so bad while also giving 0 gp/hour.
---
I mean well thats worth more but coconuts when up in price from  like 231 go ea to 1275 due to dragonfruit tree payment is coconuts
---
Spamming buying gf once last time 
---
My friend logged into his osrs account a couple of months ago which he hadn't used in years only to find out someone botted his fishing level to 96 and nothing else lol. 
---
I mean, I always considered that to be a joke sub so idk why it was taken seriously. Even throwing a /s at the end of comments leaves people baffled that you're joking.
---
I wasn't accusing you of down voting me, just pointing out where it stood.
---
Also, it's fake internet points, who gives a shit, but it's a metric for understanding how the public views your comments and sometimes it fuckin baffles me the way people vote. Whatevs dude
---
Hard to say it really fills a gap. Dscimmy at 60, leaf-bladed battleaxe at 65, whip at 70
---
It isn't locked behind rings. Those are just the best teleport method. Unlock the rings if you want access to their benefits. 
---
Not sure of rates for other plants but they seem the best method for getting hespori seeds which have a chance of dropping seeds that can increase herb yield. 
---
It's a worthwhile investment. 2-3 years and you can start pumping out humanoid bots to do agility / rc. They're unbanable and all you have to do is feed them cereal, soda, and tendies. 
---
I really doubt the seers would approve 
---
Sorry to hear man. This is why I made a unique gmail just for runescape.
---
Where do you think herbs came from before farming was released?
---
nope, just dynamic IP provided by ISP
---
Remove those stupid mystic robes you added, and replace with useful uniques.
---
A rare untradable artifact from the KDT that allows you to stick a ring of suffering into the brimstone ring that would increase its defensive stats to +10, consuming the artifact and the ring of suffering. Future artifact drops can be traded in at Konar for x amount of slayer points.
---
Oww why the sudden increase?
---
no only like 22.3k xp 
---
260 1 eye drop so fuck you :-D
---
Upvote because you're right.
---
And neither will I. Unless you follow the two rules!
---
me too
---
what do you mean, it's 50/50 drop rate
---
Supply crates would feel more like a private server than drops as usual. 
---
Yeah that's the trade off, but the nerf is a bit much imo.
---
I have a stupid amount of playtime and I’ve only ever seen two of them. Granted I wasn’t looking for them but they’re very rare.
---
Alch yourself
---
tWEEZErs
---
...No? I am saying that Obby Weapons don't have the same sort of stats as Dragon weapons. The Obby Sword is fine with the buffs from the gear, so if we did get an Obby Scim, it wouldn't be op; it would be slightly better than Obby Sword. Savage is acting like an Obby Scim would be the stats of a D Scim with the bonuses from Armor and Necklace but that is not how obby weapons work.
---
I wonder how much would it actually cost the pkers themselves to pk someone with nothing but a spade?
---
I have 2 solutions. Before the nerf it was very op. I wouldn't mind the first drop table without it happening so often. I was getting 5-6 big drops within an hour. A little too much. I had 87 Slayer and made 9.1 mill in a day. 
---
After the nerf I don't think its too bad. I like it. Its a smaller amount but still very often. I don't think it should be nerfed again. I do like it on my ironman. 
---
Regen brace is addy gloves. 
---
Make a few new mega rare unique items only available from Konar's table similiar to how superiors have imbued heart and eternal gem etc
---
Put a chest behind Konar and for drops we get "Konar's Key" which we use on the chest behind her and then get a drop from the drop table.
---
/u/JagexGambit
---
Because if you're in melee range, they are also going to melee you in addition to their magic attack.
---
That's beast as fuck actually congrats. 
---
Melee only already doesn't allow for many mistakes and you were using a fucking d long not even high level gear. 
---
Whoa. It’s like 1/32000, right?
---
This would be wayyyyy more heavily upvoted if it were real. That should’ve tipped me off. I ate the bait
---
Do the easy achievement diaries. They give an intro to a lot of content. 
---
Great, thanks. Does this have any other impacts on the game?
---
Skills necklace to woodcutting guild is how I usually get there
---
Well good thing it was only one arm or else this would have been a different story 
---
Make it have a chance for 3rd age, do it
---
I'd still put DS2 at the upper end of mid-level. It's not that hard to do just the entire quest is a huge food tax and you need to actually pay attention during the fight.
---
That’s awesome to know about buying it on regular runescape!! Going to do that for sure, thank you so much!!!
---
3m, not 2m, sorry.
---
Late game you can get drops worth 20m-360m, so a couple of those and you'll be f2p members for life.
---
Ahh, didn’t realize that so thank you
---
True brit 
---
what the fuck delete that account 
---
you forgot to block out your status bars gg
---
Is there a serious plan to address bank space? Especially with farming contracts now, players want to hold many seeds/saplings in their bank. Especially for high level ironmen this is extremely difficult.
---
I do both so I figure I am the air inbetween lol.
---
Pest Control minigame teleport, take boat to get to Sarim right next to old man that takes you to Zeah. Takes like 90 seconds total.
---
Like you! 
---
Same. I got muted for doing it.
---
The problem with being tradeable is that it opens up the ability to nearly infinitely grind certain slayer only bosses and monsters, like cerb, hydra, etc. These bosses have drops that are valued around how ungrindeable they are with needing a slayer task of their creature. With the ability for maxed mains to dump their cash stack into basically buy able slayer pts for skips, they can always be on task to grind whatever boss they want, which in the long run bring a TON of unique into the game over time. Anyone want dirt cheap primordial boots? 
---
I would do blackjacking
---
32,768 according to the wiki! 
---
If anyone is curious.. I posted this because unlike twitch phish streams, these links look more legit. 
---
D Long instead of Whip?
---
It’s updated again as of today. 
---
Yeah pyramid plunder is great for some fast xp. If you are paying attention it is a good 3-5k xp at low lvls per 5 minutes depending on how many chests and urns you open. I highly suggest it as well.
---
legit didn't know these existed and had to look them up to ensure it was real 
---
Yeah, these were great.
---
Adding a second comment, I'm one of those people who are slightly against adding tons of uniques to the table to bring up the value of it. I'd much rather have more consistent item drops of 100-250k than a slim chance to get an item for 3m. Adding expensive rare drops do not benefit the average loot from the table all that much. I don't like grinding for a small chance at an expensive drop. That's just not my thing and unless I have a semi-consistent drop to keep me going and hold my interest, I will not continue to slay 1000 mobs just for a chance at a high price drop. That is of very little interest and I do not find that fun in the slightest and I think a lot of other people are in the same boat. I'd prefer if the focus would be on average drops instead of the big ticket items like bosses have. As stated, that is not enough to keep me interested.
---
And on a gayfire

No, just fixes the weird UI thing.

I’ve personally had issues with the actual game freezing if I use GPU rendering but I don’t think they’re related.

had someone lure me out into deep wildy(early osrs account), talked to me the whole time, asked me how i was, apparently he was gonna kill me for my stuff but didn't when i told him all I had left in my bank was my rune scimmy that i was wearing at the time after i was hacked and cleaned(have a pin and 2fa now)
---
Meh, it's pretty obvious that you got a drop from her and I don't think the chat box spam is worth it.

Why is League of Legends not here its would be no1
---
Warding is another skill in a lineup of lackluster skills, Rending is an overarching system that changes how skills interact with each other, pragmatically, you're learning how to make and breakdown items in game, allowing your to breakdown the skills themselves and combine them in new ways. 
---
Imagine this, naturally occurring ore rocks that are highly concentrated like hematite, your contemporary knowledge of mining would be rather useless in harvesting this material, only because of Rending would you know how to combine smithing and mining to break it down and harvest it. 
---
Rending combining the fundamental knowledge of several skills into one skill, in order to break it down on how it actually works. In the same vein, you can be the strongest most accurate man in the world on runescape and still not be able to kill a crawling hand without the right slayer knowledge. 
---
To be fair, I haven't played it so I can't comment on it
---
It's definitely stressful being so close to that sweet cape, and knowing that if you fail you'll have wasted an hour of your life.
---
That being said, the real trick to Jad is to just take it slow. Don't rush to change your prayer immediately, that's how you miss. You have more than enough time to click, just go nice and easy. Watch the feet, have sound on if it helps you (it definitely helps me), and limit yourself to one action between prayer switches. 
---
I know it gets a little crazy when healers come out to play, and you're trying to manage your health and prayer, but as long as you aren't too low of a level you should have more than enough supplies left to drag out the fight as needed. Keep it steady, one action per switch, you'll get it in no time
---
Typically isn’t it always atk/str &gt;&gt;&gt; Def?
---
i understand the comparison, but the obby legs is probably better than torags legs here no?
---
It's true, and my brother with schizophrenia actually *is* having the TV talk to him.
---
Spend it all on chins and camp vorkath ;)
---
No, breaking both arms would have meant no arms for the computer. 
---
There are definitely people, including me, that didn't want to randomly reward people with 2m of value if they get lucky. I'd rather it be 200k or so spread out 10x more frequently, like it is now.
---
Most people don't look at public chat much, find a good clan or discord channel 
---
Damn, i love these ideas a lot. Hope to see these emblems
---
I loved reading the comments. Everyone thinks they're a lawyer these days...
---
Sick
---
I would prefer the drop table was more like a supply crate like wintertodt. So after a slayer assignment you get a supply crate from Konar on every assignment. However that crate would scale just like the drop table but at the same time also have a small chance per amount of creatures slain to contain something worth while.
---
They're mentally ill, man. You can't expect very much.
---
sweet thanks! other dudes answer confused me lol
---
Aye, that be me
---
The drops should be balanced in a way that doesn't devalue skilling as a way to gather resources.  The stance that Jagex recently took with changing bird nest drops from bosses was that the majority of skilling resources should come from the actual gathering skills rather than PvM.  My initial reaction to the original drop table was that the number and quantity of skilling resource drops looked like it directly contradicted the previously stated philosophy from Jagex.  
---
I obviously don't have access to the data that Jagex does to see the number of resources entering the game via skilling as opposed to PvM drops, but I would just like Jagex to maintain skilling as the primary way to gather these resources (e.g. fish, ores, herbs, etc).  
---
As far as the actual value and rarity of the drops, it should be a fair trade-off to get access to better drops from Konar to compensate for the slower exp rates of having to sometimes do tasks in sub-optimal locations.  I won't claim to know what the exact gp/hr rate should be.  Adding unique drops or a new magic robe set is fine too.
---
F in the chat for cream n cheesy
---
I would love it if they covered the hands. I always think the player models look worse with bare hands when doing combat related things.
---
IM SORRY 
---
I agree with this. Personally I never usr geomancy, but I'd still pay the runes needed for such a noticeboard because it's much more convenient than switching to lunars.

I had a gf in runescape once. She played more than me and left me for a higher level player. Bitch stole my rune halberd as well. 
---
Lol I'm finally back into osrs after well over a decade myself. Good times.  
---
Yeah I’m all for this but no outfits, I already need to drink a stamina pot every 2-3 invents and that’s with full Graceful and 74 agility
---
I'm not saying you wouldn't benefit from higher but desert elite is mostly replaceable by pool. The point being that 74 prayer isn't what is holding anyone back and you don't need to drop 200m on 99 pray to be able to do high level pvm. 
---
Ahh true
---
Something needs to be added so it doesn't feel out of place. Like a text message or something else.
---
Do you have evidence 
---
Sounds like you never did raiding..
---
most mmo's the leveling is an obstacle towards the actual content but in rs leveling is the point of the game
---
S
---
I have all the tier 3 rewards and this is just killing me right now. There's no reason for one item to be another colour. Please make them white with the blue accent.
---
I grew up on runescape music videos lol, those were the shit.
---
A large percentage of the ones not using Reddit are casual players who are not grinding slayer assignments so they probably don't care either way.
---
As Killz4Rune pointed out, this issue can be quickly dealt with by making it so that only items worth more than a certain amount (e.g. 1K) are highlighted
---
GUUUUTHIXXXXXX
---
It's okay to be grey 
---
Ah, that makes sense! Just was curious what the reason was lol. Congrats though on the fire cape! 😊😁
---
Does this only work in multi zones or pvm hotspots? Would it work at black chins, dark crabs, or the resource area?
---
How often do pvp clans set up traps for other pvp clans with a pker pretending to be a pvmer and call their clans once another clan attacks them?
---
It takes like a year to go for only that much exp
---
I do the chartering rn as well actually cause I can't even use the fairy ring teleport cause of my deaths. It's not even that bad lmao. Tho since I do have the agi level basically I'd probably just use the fairy ring once I can actually kill him regularly.
---
Also it's fine if that was your kill time after you really got it down. I don't mind doing a bunch of inefficient runs where my kills times are like 5 minutes as long as I can improve it to 3.5
---
Wtf
---
Projecting this much
---
205 tiles is quite a bit, I’d wager it’s on or near Entrana.
---
these aren't the kinds of eternal items the game needs, but honestly, a unique suggestion is better than 99% of the content on this sub so for that you have my respect. 
---
1) Can you buff Aerial Fishing (xp + pearl droprate) and is the sack just a cosmetic?  
---
2) Can you add Withdraw Noted to Tool Leprechaun?  
---
3) Can you increase rooftop agility courses hitboxes so that it's easier on Mobile to click on them?  
---
Is there anything else that can be done to improve shaman killing? I think all ironmen can agree on the fact that dwh is one of the worst grinds on ironman and the most tedious and least fun. 
---
Honestly just do Nature Spirit, get 13 and get addy gloves. Then act like that was the plan all along ;)
---
So you can just write them off? Most people do slayer. Reddit opinion should never be held as the will of the players. 
---
God** 
---
jesus...dontcha no its a proper noun?
---
Congrats, dude. :)
---
Rib n Saucy master race
---
Thats a dumb argument. Experience does not matter. The max level is 99. Just cause the amount of exp it takes to get there doesnt mean stats in the 70s aren't mid level and technically its above the "middle" for that matter. 49.5 would be directly in the middle of 99. However people usually consider 60-70s mid level due to content and what you can do. Doesnt matter if it took 5k exp to go from level 1-98 and 13m to 99, it wouldnt change the fact that 50 would be in the middle. Take combat for example..every 3 or 4 str levels or whatever it is that adds an extra max hit will not change just because you need 1m exp to level up vs 10k. Its still ONE level. 
---
You just want the double exp for yourself! /s
---
Clearly him and a lot of others, I could ask “who fucking cares” to some useless trash you like and it’s be about the same thing.
---
It's amazing that RL with all its additions is more stable than default..
---
Konar doesn't need that much buffs honestly it's still balance: more points+extra profit per hour/lower exp rate  
---
making her better would make the other slayer master less relevant.. Right now I seem to be get an extra 200k-300k per hour on my tasks as opposed to before it was like 400-600k and even that sometimes you'd get mills lol  
---
The gp per hour now is a lot more constant than it was
---
Devalues my level 1 farming ironman
---
It does take into account every item in every table so a spacific item for one roll is very rare 
---
Source on the gloves?
---
You're also paying &gt;6k for 8 prayer points. That's 81gp/ppoint compared to super restore at 99 which has is 86gp/ppoint. The bank really isn't far enough away and it's not like someone will steal your spot.
---
All these people suggesting things to make their ironman lives easier... don't add drops that cater specifically to ironman please... If a drop gets added, it will most definitely drop in value and will later on be a bad value drop. Only ironmen will benefit from these later on.
---
Best are alchables or items you know won't drop in price significantly.. volcanic ash will drop like crazy if it were to be added.
---
You’re the invisible guy they’re both pointing at
---
It's picked up a bit, hitting about 40k peak on days as shown on the chart. I'm content with it, love Runescape and OSRS as a whole getting a lot of new players, looks good for the company to get us all more content.
---
Jesus** god... dontcha no its a proper noun?
---
This needs to be PINNED.
---
Correct. If you are doing slayer with anything but the silver bracelets it is XP waste.
---
You don't get the daily players count by dividing unique players a month by 30.  
---
Don't invent your own metrics. Stick to the source.  
---
What plants are in your north and south plots?
---
Yeah, that’s probably it. If you need hosidus favor for that (not sure if you do) there’s a way that only takes 20 minutes and costs like 45k for 100% favor as well. You mix salt petre and sulfuric ashes I’m pretty sure, i haven’t done it in awhile but it’s something like that and extremely quick. 
---
can the prayer bonus from devout boots be increased (or looked at in general)?  
---
atm they give +5  
---
Prims give +2 and a bunch of dmg which means you can generally take prims over devout boots for generally faster tasks which results in less p pots used  
---
Also even if theyre not using Prims, Guardian boots also offer some dmg bonuses and also offer +3 prayer  
---
Can anyone explain Warding to me? I quit long before this skill came out
---
&gt;because our home internet IP isn't static (but it's a common thing so shouldn't be such an issue)
---
I really doubt it would be that, in the UK your IP is dynamic by default and static IPs cost extra with many ISPs. Jagex is a British company so id be staggered if they overlooked this.
---
Would this be super OP?
---
r/whyweretheyfilming
---
Pretty unique suggestion 100% thumbs up on creativity but the reality is that this is overpower AF
---
Snape grass
---
It's so fucking childish but I've been sat here giggling solidly for the last minute reading your title over and over.
---
It's 91 million unique players in a month. It's not unreasonable to assume those players are roughly evenly distributed throughout the month. 
---
Just tweak it so anyone with 100% in everything Doesn’t have a chance to roll for it, increasing odds to get a better drop. 
---
Rewards people with 100% with better RNG 
---
Rewards people without 100% to bypass time sink tedium 
---
Not necessarily, I have a pure with 1750 total. It doesn’t have to be a 2k world
---
Willace? Someone get this lad help.
---
Why would you have to start another account?

That doesn't actually fix that the plugin is worse though, which it is. You do the same thing on osbuddy lol. For the items that remain, osbuddy is still better.

&gt;The Lizardman Shaman Caves for Konar Slayer tasks have been replaced with a Molch area. The caves are now covered by the Lizardmen Settlement area.
---
Aw man, I know it doesn't really make a difference and the task itself was misleading ("kill lizardmen in lizardmen cave" where the only monsters are lizardmen shamans), but that one really put me outside of my comfort zone and got me killing lizardmen shamans for the first time so I'll kind of miss it.
---
Not really
---

---
Buckets of sand please
---
No, which is the saddest thing, we scuffed the last two hands and ran out of food
---
Isn't the normal obby cape already the same stats as a skillcape?
---
Birdhouses already broke brews for ironman mode 
---
Have no idea what they’re talking about. Seems like a joke. 
---
I suggested this and it was well received but the general consensus was that the bracelets should be charged with their respective jewels or they would be overpowered. 
---
Can't just play normal mode and just not spend a single cent on MTX?
---
I see what you mean, but I'm just not sure if these items actually do anything.
---
If you make them super rare and tradable - They're going to be way to expensive to realistically be worth it. 
---
If you make then super rare and untradable - they're more or less worth like 10 Slayer points ( or however many it cost to cancel a task). 
---
And if they're not rare and tradeable - what you mentioned will happen.
---
And if they're not rare and untradable... Maybe worth it? Idk still don't think it's worth adding 
---
hello send bobs
---
Oh snap, someone got a super rare drop for once. Time to nerf it by 50% IMMEDIATELY
---
That does seem a bit unfortunate but it wasn't around for long. It seems Skotizo and Rune Dragons can drop noted Dragonstones so while not as easy to get it is still possible to do that sort of thing.
---
Need the NSFW tag (not safe for wood)

I've gotten 8 so far.

I think 5 were from contracts, 2 from herb patches, and one from redwood.

It has yet to be polled, but the short version is it meant to be Magic's Armor Skill like how Crafting is the Ranged's Armor Skill. You get energies through various means that you use with fabrics to make armors and other stuff. Not too much more known beyond that at the moment.

What setting is this under in RuneLite?

Could you post this somewhere on the home page or atleast mention it ingame somehow, not everyone uses twitter/reddit

I’m sure he means the gloves lol

Netflix is capable of great things though. To be fair I actually quite enjoyed the little bit of Sex Education I did see. I'm used to US TV shows so the Americanised high school doesn't bother me too much in the long run if the show is good

Change it

Change the spelling of adamant bolts(unf) to adamant bolts (unf) - matching all other unfinished bolts (this adds a space between bolts and (unf)). (this is not a character issue mithril bolts (unf) is one character longer)
---
Make it so the banker at ouranian alter does not take your runes until after you've successfully entered your bank pin.
---
Add a make all option when creating barbarian potions
---
Make it so that collapsing box traps (not sure how other hunting items work) do not kick you out of the bank
---
Make it so that running out of prayer points does not kick you out of the bank
---
Make it so that when you report a player on mobile by long clicking (right clicking their name) it doesn't pull up the keyboard. It prefills the name so it is just a bit annoying to close out of the keyboard.
---
Make it so that you can withdrawal noted compost from the tool leprechaun
---
Make the Pharaoh's Scepter a one handed weapon like other magic staves. It doesn't make sense for it to be 2 handed when you hold it entirely with one hand.
---
Allow players to click through the total exp orb on mobile. You can click through it on desktop, but on mobile if you click it, it loads a less translucent version of itself. There is no benefit for the current interface.
---
Debatable
---
Make it so home teleport isn't interrupted by poison (you can home tele between poison hits it's just a bit annoying when it gets interrupted)
---
Allow barbarian potions to heal above max hp (as saradomin brews and guthix rests already do), + 3 for potions that use roe, and +6 for potions that use caviar. (equal to what it normally heals). In many situations it does not make sense to bring a 2 dose potion (especially in PVP) compared to a 4 dose potion and this could create additional use of these potions in pvp and pvm. The over healing from these potions would not stack with other types of overhealing food/potions.
---
Make it so Ice giants do not drop big bones. Ice warriors and earth warriors do not drop bones, be consistent. (I understand removing big bone drops doesn't help anyone, I just feel it should be consistent if you want to keep them then add bone drops to ice warriors)
---
They're barely getting updates as is. Jagex keeps shelving them or just flat out giving up on the updates.

Hmm never tried a soft man. Thanks!!!!
---
Slightly increase value of all drops on Konars table again,

Remove the stupid high quantity high value drops 1-2m+
---
Give us a message when we get a drop specifically from the table.
---
That's it.
---
time to make a zerk

I have 600 kc all with blowpipe and it’s rare a kill takes me over 2 minutes, I get maybe 1/2 kills an hour less than I would using a tbow, that’s not significantly worse. 
---
TIL, I always thought it was just one ring that was given twice. This makes sense though.
---
I think the guild is good as it is. We really don't need all types of patches there as well. That just further devalues the whole skill in my opinion.
---
Gz mate, I hope to get one aswell ! :)
---
Yeah. Took me 7 tries for the first.

Then later I did 2 drunken Jad tasks while watching star trek. Weird how it be like that.

Dragon dart tips should be added back. It doesn't make sense you can get arrowheads but not dart tips.

Safe to say most people use Facebook but alright.

Many people are unaware but dps depends both on your gear and the defensive stats of the monster/player you are fighting
---
Wow 11 whole things! And most of those are dry as fuck regardless.
---
What are the farming pet rates from the new plants, and especially from the hespori? 
---
My point is that the game already has plenty of examples of more money = way faster xp ( buyables, rc, cannoning, etc. ), I just don't see what's so terrible about making slayer faster. 
---
Sell it unless you are doing hydra vork or raids 1 
---
Does getting abby demons in the Abyssal Area mean you can do Sire?
---
Guess what you don't need to do basically everything else in the game?? 95 slayer. Never doing Hydra, ever. Never ever never ever ever 
---
OP is 15 probs
---
If you don't think everyone who plays the game, many of whom pay money to do so, deserves the same voice in the content of said game then I can't help you. That's utterly stupid. 
---
I like the change from herbs to seeds, the huge quantities were a bit awkward but I don't argue with what I'm seeing on equalizing the average value between the tables,  I like what seems to be many people had issue with what was dropped (massive amounts of herbs causing them to crash) rather than the value of drops
---
OP probably uses Facebook
---
use the desert themed house
---
Level 43 wildy, south east of the denomic ruins
---
Which 3 skills? I’m going to guess fletching, cooking and range?
---
Or a possibility to ban certain dungeons from the list, greater demons in the brimhaven dungeon. Just ban the area and receive greater demons elsewhere.
---
Someone posted a spreadsheet confirming Konar is best if any task that couldn't be done quicker somewhere else is skipped.
---
I think ash should be one of the things you can chip off the rock while doing volcanic mine similar to calcite, numulite etc. You won't get a significant amount, but it's enough on top of the points that I could see it being worth while. 
---
You'll be mind blown if you go mem. F2P is very limiting. If you're trying to do Castle Wars, nobody plays anymore on F2P.

Plus vast majority of players use 3rd party it’s like ur clutching at straws night mate, keep using the osrs database to buy your rune items leave the high tier items for the un retarded

It's too bad you don't have prayer level for Smite. Smiting him on the killing blows yields pet. 
---
Nope just you
---
Your only argument is that since I haven't experienced all the end game content I can't judge how good the game is. A good game doesn't only consist of endgame content and players should not get bored af before getting there. 
---
Sick 2 def tank man. I have a similar build.
---
I can understand a 12 hour sesh here and there, but doing it for 6 days in a row is mad. Just a 3 hour sesh of osrs gets me sick of the game if I’m not pking but to each their own

Yeah if you're a shmuck and fall for that shit

Bring back the black pure.

Most likely RATed. Clean your PC or you're going to keep having issues. Google can tell you how to verify you're infected and how to clean it.

Use that extra 500 point block m8

But then I'll lose all my points saved, I've got in bank lol
---
Do  you mind sharing the chance of getting  any drop from her table?
---
The news post only mentioned the chance of accessing the unique table.
---
Yea, just hover ur mouse over it
---
My vote goes to Cannonballs, (dragon) bones and other end products that just leave the game again immediately
---
as far as uniques go: maybe an (add-on) item that increases the dragon hunter lances dmg/acc to make it as powerful as the dhcb, but the lance becomes untradeable while upgraded. the upgrade can be removed, but you only get the lance back. That should keep the demand pretty high
---
That's the meme reeeee

I see. I wooshed it and through you were thinking an RS element.

Skills necklace teleport to farming guild shouldn't have been changed, just the farming cape teleport.

Don’t have 30 points to skip?

Can you give the leaf bladed sword +4 str bonus? It would still be weaker than the granite hammer, but not as dramatically. They have the same attack requirement and attack speed, but the leaf bladed sword has a 55 slayer requirement and the granite hammer does not.

Go 13 brother get slay helm , fairy ring and addys

It was worth a shot :(

$38 what a waste of time.

There was one clan that would do it but I think they died.

I used almost all of my points on the boss option because i’m a dumbass. 
---
Off the top of my head I don’t know and I don’t have a slayer ring either. 
---
Not the table, but an increased spawn rate for superiors would be awesome. 
---
Hopefully some of the new mobs get superiors in the future, but a 10%-25% boost, even as a seperate points unlock would be great. It would sort of fit the design space she's in of "Sacrificing the most efficient methods for a bit of a lotto ticket"

Onions, cabbages, and marigolds. And they go in the same order in port phasmatys patch, adry patch, and falador patch.

Wine of Zamorak, Ogress Warriors, flipping,

Bottom right made me lose it 😂😂😂👌👌💯💯

What do you camp for clues?

Later Virgins

With your stats and I’d assume rather low slayer level, it might just be best to reset your streak.

EasyScape

I think it could give some when mining the rock similar to calcite, numulite etc. Since that will be 4 possibilities from the 5 xp drops, you won't get enough to do a lot of damage to ash rates. Did VM from 87-99 and that little bit of extra ash would have been cool for herb runs. 
---
You need to hire some handymen from Roller Coaster Tycoon and that shit will be lookin' fresh 24/7.
---
Wait, I just grinded to 77 slayer to kill brutal black dragons, are you saying there's an exp multiplier bracelet?
---
Out of the 7 i caught 4 of them were coifs. Nice. 
---
The first 110 or so I did Puro-Puro because I was an ironman. After I deironed a few weeks back I just bought eclectic jars and have been doing them since. Medium clues are 1/25 rate or so from them.
---
I’d say the same, but they do scale with HP, after 84(i think) they heal 30 gp per inv spot 
---
This post is literally just an ad.

Sub 1 minute would be almost 20 dps. I'm not saying it's impossible but that is absurdly high lol. 
---
Well, worst case scenario is you go to turael and get a new task from him, losing your streak. 
---
If you don’t have 30 points to skip, you’ll either have to try to do the task with your current stats, cancel the task and lose your streak, keep the task and train your stats, or if you have a friend that wouldn’t mind doing some KQ with you, you might be able to complete the task that way. Last option is probably your best.

Just casually walking around with 500k runes lol
---
I don’t think you understand I don’t pick up the bones anyways because my inventory is always full with loot. 
---
There is no grass growing in the portal room, only in the garden
---
Yea, that's my point. Even using Fire Surge with Infinity, Brimstone Ring, Tome/Staff of Light/Occult, I was getting only 23k xp/h. With same set-up, but trident, I was getting 22k xp/h at Drakes. So Idk how he's saying Wyrms and Drakes are decent XP tasks, especially for anyone without access to absolute max gear.
---
Really? 
---
Could hydra bones be a noted drop?
---
It fills up the inventory rather quickly, so I 'have' to end the trip when I still have supplies for a couple more kills.
---
I think it would be fair if the kebos/kourend elite diary would be a requirement for this.
---
Well, the reason it works that way in the Wildy is likely due to how it was polled. If they intended for it to be non-revertable, it would have been the wildy behavior that was changed instead.
---
Stat wise, D boots are very close to prims.  No mid-tier item needed.  Dboots are the mid tier item.
---
If it's already planted but you haven't checked the health and she gives you a contract for it you can just check the health and it'll complete the contract.
---
I believe the harvesting stuff is to completely harvest the plant.
---
You're selectively reading my statement so read again for comprehension and get back to me.
---
Treat others how you wanna be treat yourself homie x
---
Needs more tentacles
---
How did you get yours?
---
I think it’s a terrible idea honestly. It takes the only downside and removes it. If you don’t like the area it’s assigned cancel it.
---
Might have gotten ripped off haha. I was just giving a price point of reference before mm. Which reminds me, I massively overpaid for a dscim around the release of mm. Wanted one before I completed and paid around a mill. Imagine my face when I completed the quest and saw the store price 😂 
---
Only fruit trees so far, I suspect the drop rate may be tied to XP drop of the harvest
---
He’s talking about other players. Every current account wouldn’t magically get an untrimmed cape because they don’t have records of what was achieved first. 
---
Jagex isn’t going to change it to a system where untrimmed capes don’t trim after 99 for a select group of people. 
---
It will work, yes. I've chain-planted things (cadantine for the initial contract, planted watermelon/snape/cactus/poison ivy/limpwurt, second contract was for snape grass and third was for poison ivy) so it absolutely works and works well if you know common contracts.
---
Solid advice, now I just need to learn how to stop people from calling me a fucking noob.
