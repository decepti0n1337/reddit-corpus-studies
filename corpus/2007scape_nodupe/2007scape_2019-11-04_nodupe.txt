Freaking def noobs man

---
Which armors do you mean? For the Waterbirth Armors, I think they are fine just being lower level gear, but I would like to seem them more useful for their level; for example, they could get a set effect against the Waterbirth Creatures or something like that.
---

---
For the Battle Helms, I'd love to see the Warrior, Archer, and Farseer get upgrades like the Berserker got with the Neitiznot Helm. But I think they are better saved for new Quests than just added into existing Quests. There is still one quest left in the series and there could also be side quests too...
---
For the Seercull, it seems doomed to obscurity. I'd like to see it upgraded to be a good level 50 bow; nothing more. Like even if you just make it a Shortbow with the MSB(i) stats, that would be something...
---
I know. I prefer the way justiciar looks now as compared to this design as well.
---
pures have low hp so they can keep cb level low and easily kill mains around their level, while still hitting hard
---
but if you only have 1 def then theres a chance the dude doing a clue in wildy will roll high on dds spec and kill you instead
---
Can always make it where each piece of the sets a % buff so it can be used during slayer
---
Can start out with a bp if you go that way, ive seen plenty of people using bp at bbds
---
obviously you can enter chambers as a lvl 3 in the nude so these arent "real" requirements, but in most learner groups there are a few things wrong with your reqs i figured id point out  
---
void is typically allowed but you take a ton of extra damage, void switches will be the same amount as real switches usually anyway, just take the better gear unless you dont have it
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
trident of the seas is not acceptable usually, bring toxic trident
---
regular whip is not acceptable usually, bring tent whip
---
its not dragon boots or god dhide boots, bring both
---
the spec weapon for lowering defense is one of the most important items to bring. chally is not an acceptable replacement. you will have a very hard time finding someone to go with without at least a bgs
---
rune pickaxe will do just fine and a crush weapon for tek isnt neccessary since we all bring our spec weapons like i said above ;)
---
It’s good for the economy
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
here is a (fairly accurate) list, obviously for all combat methods they are assuming max efficiency so if you are not doing that method do not expect to reach that gp per hour
---
but to answer, no max efficiency melee vorkath is best money in the game.
---
L0l you call like 10m an hour each.. shit profit? If they taking 500k off you and it only took 2 secs, imagine a few hours worth. Whats wrong with making dank money, chilling with the bois on discord, and looking for a big team v team scrap. 
---
Legit bet you dont make anywhere near 10m an hour and you taking the piss out of these kids. Lol smh dude.
---
Imagine being the one stuck with the attack cape.
---
I wonder if he regrets, it seems 1-2 times a year he makes a video promising to make more, sometimes deletes it, doubt the pay is that amazing for his position, the only reasons hes employed is for pr damage control it seems, doesnt seem as active in the community as was before. 
---
I miss the old archie. Hope whatever he is doing now makes him happy.
---
That guy must have never figured out that you have to go to the dungeon for the dragon defender.
---
Right, anyone who says gf is a clown. Dont worry op, we will say the n word next time as to avoid being called clowns.
---
I know alot of people who bot, then come back to read chat...this proves nothing....reported
---
only risk would be that it would end up being slightly OP in slayer, as you wouldn't need to pay the price of ppots and most tasks don't need overheads
---
I got b2p + infin boots, and dipped.
---
Accomplishing 99 str is way more than many normies have ever done with their lives.
---
So on pvp and bh worldw there is a hard pj timer after getting a kill. Its 2019 though anyone that is looting knows how to triple eat and tele when it looks like they getting rushed.
---
How long did it take?
---
Of the two, a rake would better, but your point is well taken!
---
Never had to clear ground elder, mostly used a gardening spike for dandelions when younger or hand weeding a planter
---
Oh sorry, I thought you meant long term.
---
Every time I've had a clue scroll on my 'kill x tasks' that I've uploaded to reddit, I've always finished it, and it's included in my loot screen.
---
I do them as soon as I get them, incase another drops in the task
---
Haha well I’m gonna work on a low hp/def range build early game to kill the imp and goblin rev for early late game drops. I’m just working on 99 fm so I can get cape for best in slot def
---
They voted no to early access to in game items/features from a promotion. This twitch membership thing has already happened before.
---
Around 320 hours
---
Try doing hop runs (Yanillian) to sustain a bond, then using the extra cash to get gears. I am using this method to work my alt towards brutal black dragon.
---
Yep
---
Accomplished nothing. HA, good one, I'm an ultimate ironman, dumb normie
---
I want to die
---
What's your IGN? I'm Ark haha
---
This deserves an award! I would give it one but I’m poor just like Rachel in friends Kappa
---
you do know they used to be untradable, right? they were a cool trophy before jagex fucked it for no reason
---
Cheers, kid's crying
---
no need to be mean its just Nancy Pelosi :(
---
You need 90s ranged and magic at the very least
---
Bruh stop looking at him then
---
Yeah, you’ll be back.
---
How many times you gonna post this?
---
maybe it would be worse than slay helm+piety, but better than piety on its own?
---
I 99% remember them being untradable for the first few, starting with the jar and people on reddit trying to figure out what it did
---
Lol thanks, glad you liked the post
---
Account recovery on yourself with billing information code is the only way, also might I add the billing code has to be atleast a year old
---
That’s what I did to 99 as well. I actually just posted a video today on sacred eels
---
I’m guessing this is on the island thing “pirates cove”
---
I enjoyed how afk it was
---
God I cant wait to be done, 96 right now ;~;
---
Oh nice you have a YouTube channel ?
---
Public Service Announcement. Please don't drink and smith.  Drinking and smithing has been shown in the state of California to lead to, and not including.

---
Yes I with my max cape am very jealous of people with 99s
---
k, thats enough everyone
---
Tanglefoot skins are sickkkk
---
7 weight, same as a few shitty tasks and higher than a lot of others. Not really anything else I'd prioritise blocking since I like doing abby demons and kraken, but those are definitely two more candidates I forgot to mention yeah.
---
If it’s 14 hours a day I’m assuming they don’t have a job. Or osrs *is* their job. And for people who do work, of osrs is their only hobby, they can easily play like 5 hours a day lol
---
How many times do we need to teach you this lesson old man
---
F2P skilling. There's a rise in "begging" at the GE as of late
---
Yeah I meant to post the link but there was an error and you’re only allowed to post a specific link once per day. If you’re interested just type in Lawliet osrs on YouTube and it should pop up.
---
I've never paid for membership with money. Only used bonds ever since I created my account.
---
brutal. i dont have any trouble killing it but i am using a dragon hunter crossbow with void and salve ei. i get 1-2 kills per trip and could prob extend that to 1-3 fairly easily by freeing up some inventory spots and praying defence (cba). im 60 def 95 range
---
Price reduction is only when paying GP to have a weapon seed enchanted. Not when using shards or when buying a fresh bow. Just thought I'd clear that up. It's another good reason to save the shards for potions, imo.
---
Not for nothing but if you used the logic of never bringing in new BIS that makes old content easier, we'd never get new items
---
Thanks a bunch
---
It is the easiest build to get into pking, if you join a multi clan.
---
wow, thanks.
---
Barbarian assault. People leaving early makes it even worse.
---
Thank you
---
I did this on my Hc at around 50 fishing and finished half way to lv 54. I honesty would just fill the bar up and go afk. Half the time I was at the gym working out cause you could easily do it between sets
---
Give this man a Golden Gnome!
---
Nice, congrats! Yeah I want to try again at some point, but not yet lol
---
dude shut up
---
yeah but if you need full bandos etc, then 30m difference is a moot point?
---
Lunar isle
---
Not too many 70 year olds are all that attractive
---
Worth it to grind? Thinking about doing this at work. It sounds super easy and AFK. I am about to hit 90 on my main and I could use this kind of grind while I play my iron.
---
Did Gem rocks from 70-99 and made like 250m cos Red Topaz was 5.5k. Was about 45k xp/hr and really chill.

Haha so true, more addicting then my smoking habit and I thought that was bad lol

Monster :p

With all of the MTX in RS3, you can literally buy your levels. There’s some guy that maxed by doing it and it cost him like $7,000 USD. Look it up, it’s hilarious.
---
[deleted]
---
I dont know I guess to give people with maxed accounts something else to do maybe who knows?
---
Fair enough i guess. I was just saying that eventually some type of gear that comes in will eventually have to make inferno easier, just because thats how shit goes lol
---
Awfully rude for no reason?
---
Stop it or I’ll tell my mom!
---
Thank you I really appreciate it, I’m horribly anxious about going to zulrah lol. What does camp mean in this context though?
---
Sounds like a good drinking game:
---
Take a shot every time they hit a 0 with their hill giant club.
---
Take a shot every time the mole digs.
---
Down a pint when they run out of energy.
---
Take a bonus shot everytime they say "where the fuck is it?!"
---
Shit I'll be drunk quicker than I could kill it in max str, dh, and a cannon.. 😂
---
Easily PVP.
---
Pointing out the lipstick on the turd doesn't mask, you know, the turd
---
Yeah my only other thing is weed.
---
Yea it has been like that for quite literally years. I've had two friends lose accounts to that....
---
That’s spongebob
---
Is it bannable to assign my scroll wheel to left click with AHK and just scroll wheel away thieving?
---
Personally I use
---
Portal nexus | pool and fairy ring | workshop
---
-|-|-
---
**jewel box** | **entry portal** | **spirit tree**
---
Other things you can include are combat dummy, costume room, myth cape room for future con training (stairs down to dungeon), menagerie
---
Stick with, i.e. don't change those slots when you're switching gear
---
Don't be afraid to die a lot (unless hcim lol) since there's no fee to reclaim your items. Especially good if you have poh fairy ring and 76^? agil for the shortcut
---
“That’s hot”
---
Molten glass
---
Rune gloves? Regen bracelet? Blessed vambraces?
---
[this](https://imgur.com/a/vVbSnt7) is my gear
---
I guess I'll start with fire cape, maybe torso after.
---
word, thanks for the advice. I'll shoot for 80's as I wanna solo, it looks fun.
---
Dude i just got three beavers in 2 hours lmao. I would post but idk how to edit pictures together. What is our rng
---
Ah that makes sense. I appreciate your help, thank you!
---
/r/MoleJokes
---
I don't spend money, I do vorkath (used to do barrows for a dhcb) and merch, an essential part of merching is knowing the price of gp and services in rwt markets, this is true in any game with an economy.
---
My friend recently got permabanned for rebinding clicks. His appeals are also not working. I don’t recommend doing this. ( even if it is fine according to rules)
---
Veteran capes are a bad idea, since many long-time players are on a new account because they don't remember/can't access their old accounts or those accounts are insecure. 
---
They don't track time since people first logged in to OSRS and it would still be weird to use RS3 account creation date.
---
Tbh I really enjoyed having the combat bracelet updating me every 10 kills on my slayer tasks from back in the day
---
Looks really cool tbh. It's very mighty python-ish

I'm hoping that civil war comes a bit sooner, say 2022

---
This might be the most under rated comment I’ll read on the sub this year...
---
war
---
Really? I remember it being crowded for getting even two to yourself, and you kinda need 3 with bp
---
Maybe something like Zealots where it becomes more costly to pray, but provides benefit to the non BiS prayers? Like for example, have the hat give -3 prayer bonus, legs -5, and body -8.   
---
Give it something like the Amulet of Zealots effect from rs3, that is enabled for 10% with 2 pieces of it worn, and 15% if all 3 are worn.
---
For reference: Amulet of zealots,    
---
'To single-stat boosting prayers, the amulet increases the accuracy and defence gained from them by 10%, and raises their damage boost by a flat 10%... ...Using the amulet also sacrifices the necklace slot and carries a high penalty to prayer drain.'  
---
That is why I'd suggest giving it such a strong effect, you have to sacrifice 3 gear slots that could be used for range/str bonus, and/or the slayer helm for the 15%, and 2 for the 10% ontop of using more prayer potions. (For reference, that'd make Eagle eye 2% better than rigour's % damage for the 2x set effect, and 7% better for the 3x set effect.)  
---
I don't know if that'd be op/good/Dead content though.
---
Depends on which kind of runecrafting ;)
---
What’s with the uptick of these memes? I thought this happened like 2 months ago?
---
MCR reunion ready I see
---
I agree lmao, its a painful grind
---
How dare someone have a different opinion than you D:
---
I almost started a new account after the first time I took a boat to karamja and didnt realize I had to click the gangplank to get out, but I didnt want to lose my 27k 😂
---
How many games was it? Took me 39 runs lol
---
If it takes like 50 cballs to kill one on a good day and you will realistically need to kill about 7500 tortured gorillas, you're gonna need like 375k cballs.  Good luck man
---
Also why do you even want to do this? Are you trying to be a 10 hp pure for pking? Because you have to get the 20k defence and 20k hp xp from Daero after completing Monkey Madness One to continue to do MM2
---
Just like real life
---
Shintel bad. AyyMD good
---
I could never do the 3 tick granite stuff, but I don’t think I could afk for 320 hours either lol
---
Pm me ur name and lets go bandos sometime. Im a pro bandos slayer so you dont even gotta worry about what you think are your own shortcomings, ill make it work and make you victorious
---
Would love to see more things that require str instead of traditional attack/defense.
---
Maybe it gives more attack bonuses as a set, but also gives negative defensive bonuses.
---
making a 42 hp void ranger account. I already am on the journey of 90 slayer with cannon balls only (dark bow), but when that's done I want another big goal to look forward to
---
Got my cape just now 😁
---
Then by God, I’ve been fooled again!
---
I'll be doing mostly Pest Control to finish off strength!
---
I was just stating my opinion. Who said you couldnt have your own?
---
Why thank you :)
---
Yoo.. gratz!! That's awesome.
---
just a side note i looked up the levels on a few of the accounts and all of them are very similar in all levels
---
Name a more iconic duo than the combat bracelet and obby cape
---
SOUL!
---
Its Super AFK did it on my main to farm bonds for my ironman. 
---
its like 20k fsh xp/h and like 23k cooking xp/h.
---
I made like 20mil from 98-99. 
---
Scales were up there though at the time.
---
I plan on doing some cosmetic goals I think, so gold cwars armor, skilling pets, pvm pets, and maybe some 50ms/200ms in skills that I enjoy.
---
I'm about to get married tho. Everything else is true
---
Noticed? Noticed him as he walks out the first building of tutorial island? You told him to play bud
---
I don't blame Jagex for trying New stuff out but it feels like a lotta new content is stillborn, such as volcanic mining, underwater fishing or fishing with the bird on Zeah.
---
Why wouldn't you use piety? The prayer pot cost is worth the huge dps increase
---
It must not be very many of people just keep buying
---
I would love it just to have a low armor/high dps for the armour. Although, Skeletal kind of ruins this due to it being high defence and low dps. I agree with a lot of what you say. Having it deal extra dmg to Daggonoths would help it find it's niche but not fix it outright.
---
I like your ideas on seercull as well. The bow just needs something to succeed.
---
It's almost like you had an unfair advantage over people who couldnt or didnt reorder prayer via a 3rd party client. Also pray reorder failed a past poll.
---
Wouldn't killing 3 skeletons give you &gt;88.0% potential, meaning a slot of runes can potentially go to bolt racks, meaning it's not optimal runes? Optimal runes would be 88.0%. I use 2 Skeleton &gt; Bloodworm for 86.4%.
---
No. He has seen me play on mobile mining or wcing before. I dont play this game much as i used to. Only casual f2p
---
He was on tutorial island catching shrimp when I saw him today
---
There can be only one.
---
Im pretty sure most people would say overheads are pretty important, even for non-10hp accounts. Theyre good to have period. Maybe you try some runs and you can get by without them but work toward them still, theyre great to have (:
---
Odds are 50/50
---
Start questing right away in members you get a ton of low level xp just from quests
---
If I get everything else to 90 I might smash out 90 Mining
---
Best time is straight off tutorial island. Anything you do in f2p can be done better in members.
---
I heard b0aty is quitting too. Click the link below the stream entered all my info but still dont know why hes quitting !
---
Wow. Someone needs to buy you a PC for that type of achievement. 1.2k+ barrows kc on an iPhone 5s.
---
I think it's literally the smallest screen you can play osrs on
---
If it’s slayer only why do you have a mage cape
---
God I wish I had a K Bow
---
minigame tele to port sarim is kind of convenient sometimes
---
How high are your kc's and skilling levels?
---
Obviously.
---
It doesn't make sense because bringing a better weapon as one of the three safe items is a much bigger upgrade than a piece of Bandos.
---
Got mine on 5kc today. gz bro first pet for me
---
1def iron armor that Increases damage done by 20% but increases damage taken by 30% whilst disabling the prayer book from use (no protect pray or smite etc)

Same. I was originally only going to go for Bones to Peaches because I could buy everything else. But now I find out there's a collection log with defined requirements (unlike drops or pets where people can go dry) and I NEED to fill it.
---
A lot of simulators are viruses.
---
One of my friends got hacked because of one (confirmed since the creator was caught by the police and they contacted my friend for evidence lmao).
---
OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
---

---
I don't mind the Zamorak symbol but they should change the color to either be darker or faded to match the other reds on the platebody

Town Crier found dead by two dragon bolts to the back of the head
---
The barrows gloves should be on his hands
---
Oh, that makes perfect sense. I was thinking of the suicided items as regular drops haha. 
---
Thanks for the quick answer!
---
This is to answer some additional questions that have been asked and will be asked. I achieved the pet at 1337 total level with a combat level of 91. The total loot is price-checked at 272m. The account has 45 days of playtime in the past 150 days. Yes, I got two curved bones. I will not reveal my method in-full, as it is unique and may be valuable if I decide to go for the first Vet'ion pet. I will say, however, that I had no help from anyone else; I had no clan or team helping during any point of the 3599kc grind. Also, the wilderness is not dead; pkers passed through nearly every hour at all times of day, but none were able to kill me before I claimed the pet.
---
I checked before posting, I haven’t seen any others
---
272m with 118m being dragon pickaxes
---
I used to do it lol. It’s very afk and decent gp for lower levels. Especially with the prices of air orbs now
---
$25 in an alleyway behind a Denny's.
---
Has anyone?
---
It's free trials all the way down
---
45 days of playtime during 150 days of account creation.
---
Holy shit dude you are my hero
---
Also put in low offers and let them sit overnight. Bots frequently dump their entire haul and undercut to instant sell.
---
Normally I just ask my wife.
---
noted. I'd prob welfare PK cause I have like a 30m bank, with a rather low portion of that in actual gold, but so far its lookin like i wont be PKing anytime soon from most suggestions so far
---
true, id love to be able to dolo bandos. make things way easier
---
Uh no its a really good job lol
---
see you in slot #1
---
Fire cape and b gloves lol
---
3599 on a HCIM.
---
Damn well earned - grats.
---
Using OSBuddy and getting a 3B Ironman account perma-banned for “bottling”
---
Damn insane amount of kills grats
---
Just means I can finally afford a bond now
---
Hey at least she can train your runecrafting for you
---
Did you already have a pet out
---
If it's not in some way bis people will just complain about it being dead content and vote against it.
---
What’s your btw?
---
Technically 201 but I killed 1 more to finish the slayer task.
---
Thnking u can anti scam maple shortbow with addy arrows
---
I'm not going to lie, I still think Bandos armor looks cool as fuck, but I agree that it would be refreshing to see something else once in awhile.
---
I remember my friend saying my name was yellow and him printing a picture to show me at school haha.

---
how much was dmed worth at the time
---
Was just there. They're all really busy daily. I even got 70 agility for the shortcut.
---
Thank you!
---
Doesn't it go into your bank if this happens?
---
Not sure if you are serious but, \`btw\` is a meme for ironman. Started as something like \`ironman btw\`. So a btw is an ironman.
---
I got around 1.1m~? str xp from 99 fishing at barb fishing and yeah pc is a lot better than bf pump and barb fishing
---
Nope, you don't get it :(
---
You’re obviously skilling wrong then lol
---
My bad. I forgot about that. Yeah I was srs
---
haha fire cape haha... serp helm nerfs :( 
---
Thanks! Hopefully it isn't too long before I max.
---
Just takes a day or 2 to get used to. It's not that big of a deal, you'll get used to it.
---
God damnit jimmy johnflex
---
Gave my whole cash stack (8m) to a scammer. Fairly elaborate low value drop party segued into him fake doubling a whole bunch of his alts while pretending to be a YouTube personality. First and last time I’ve been scammed so far
---
Such a shame, he killed himself and then wrote a suicide note.

The bottom should be platelegs imo
---
Not a good one either
---
If you think the cosmetics from a while ago being pushed that failed the polls were not DIRECTLY pushed by China, you are out of it, friend. They are just trying to slowly mind-fuck OSRS to the point that they can sink their claws in. You can be 100% sure of that.
---
How much did u pay for protection?
---
3008 was my first and last pet from hydra I don’t plan on going back unless I ever need to rebuild wealth and hopefully I never need to
---
Well, yeah. They had to replace most of their organs with robotic ones after Xi stole them.

Literally last week i was shift dropping the fossil cleaning gear and accidentally dropped 9m in the varrock museum, and immediately world hopped away. I'm hoping some newbie got a good payday
---
Save them for emote clues
---
Youtube scam took 20m. It was a give away of 10 mil for the first person to search a youtube vid and follow the link. Definitely didnt check the URL till it was too late. 
---
As the common saying goes..... *pumps shotgun and fires into face*
---
u/JagexAcorn would you mind updating the HCIM firsts list please?
---
Did he like it? What were his thoughts?
---
Tell me aaall!
---
Not for the master clue step unless it was a hidden qol update recently.. maybe? The Crystal pickaxe works in place for a dragon, though it has to be made from a dragon in the first place, so a possible update if you've done it recently.
---
Must be a couple months back that I even got that master step to be fair.
---
/u/torvesta NEW VIDEO IDEA
---
Seriously, that is full time work (40 hrs/week) for 8 full weeks.
---
Yeah it's pretty dangerous for sure. But I still think not dying even once at Venenatis (through boss mechanics or PKers) with ~3600 KC is crazy...
---
Well, I AM a hcim btw
---
Meat pizza or nans
---
Thank you, this is exactly what I need to start!
---
Probably recent update i did it not long ago.
---
People like this are why my nan is scared of the internet.
---
Totally basing this off of r/2007scape so not representative of the whole playerbase, but I've seen plenty of people say that they only kept playing after they downloaded RL. When all of the 3rd party client drama was going on, a lot of people said they'd quit if RL was banned. Whether they actuallynwoul or not, who knows, but I see that as business and money that Jagex has gotten because of RL that was *hopefully* reinvested into the game to give us new content and devs.

---
really? You do earnest the chicken on members?
---
After getting my first bond, I rushed all the quests that give farming xp and started growing ranarr weed. I've held continuous membership for over 9 months now and i have paid for all of it buying bonds with gp earned growing ranarr weed.
---
It's costly to run my bot farm since bonds went up 250%, going to make ank for the kids this x-mas.
---
Got scammed by the infamous “basement lure” after being told to watch a video on how to anti scam. Literally dropped 10M stack and full ankou. What’s worse is I’ve played since 05’ and this happened about a month ago. -.- lol
---
I havent in forever but why would you NEED to do it as f2p? If anything doing it in f2p would hinder you in slayer once you become p2p because it unlocks shitty killerwatts iirc.
---
It would be nice if fishing trawler actually gave more than just token xp

did you just assume his species?

The one next to falador when you get to dwarves area
---
Have you seen alien plz?
---
I just feel like its not a huge advantage like people think. Its all muscle memory in the end and trying to get used to a new thing that you never have used before is so hard. It never should have been pulled like the other person said, just added as a plugin.

edit- Quite funny when you look up this guys wikipedia too. Has an edit 2 days ago that has added https://i.imgur.com/SJs3HVV.png. Edit shows up on the side bar when you google his name as well.

Brought full void mage and the mace into rouges castle to do the Guthix boss of mage arena 2.
---
Died to a squad of pures.
---
Didn’t know void wasn’t protected at the time, i expected the gloves would be a write off but nah.

Best answer if I do say so myself jk lol Ik people kinda dislike him now but I still watch A Friends old HCIM series when I play its 87 episodes I believe?
---
It's your RuneScape account email the same as your Apple/ Google play account?
---
No the idea is that this Essence source would be replaced with a new form of Essence while the essence we currently have would still be dropped by stuff. So Rune Essence and Pure Essence would still exist but this 3rd new kind would be gotten from the mine, maybe in a new area of it.
---
not really at all, but go off
---
Yes same as my google play account. Don't have an apple thingo
---
*Lynx Titan would like to know your location.*
---
Check account status, any reports of botting etc? When you logged in, how many days did it say since you last logged in?
---
Nice
---
Kk send proof
---
Oh okay thanks for the clear up
---
44k every 30 seconds is comparable to zulrah gp/hr. Not to mention, fun is a big part of the hunt. Its the thrill of the chase, not just the kill.
---
I completely agree with this.
---
And I think if they were to just say they allow certain things then it would solve a large part of the problem, from what I see there are only three types of people that don't use clients: 
---
1 too scared to use (would be fixed by knowing it's okay and what is okay to use) 
---
2 don't know about clients (these are mostly noobs and will come across them eventually or even better if there is a recommended client) 
---
3 sweaty nerds that don't want it to be easier than what they have already done (and if you don't want something to get better because you have already completed it when it was shit, that is a terrible way to run a game and will just end in the game dying cause it's either too difficult or not work the grind to play)
---
A lot of the client features don't even really give an advantage they just make it more bearable/enjoyable.
---
Just my opinion on the topic.
---
Plus the shift to walk under (or pick up item) feature that some of the smaller clients had is a feature that really should be part of the vanilla client rather than banned it is something that once you start using it integrates into the game so we'll and is just such a nice feature.

Nieve if you want to cannon and/or burst, Konar otherwise
---
This happened a few weeks ago so I'm not sure how many days it said. Was definately not longer than 3 months. I haven't gone back since due to not wanting to repeat it all over again. There were no reports of botting or unauthorised activity
---
Or the Icelandic rock formations where inspired by the rocks near the lighthouse?
---
most skills have some unique members only aspect to them by level 10, so really, it's any time you feel like.
---
of course, if you intend to make your membership self sustaining, the higher your initial skills, the better, but otherwise go for it.
---
Yikes get over it you big baby.
---
Same exact boat here. Started playing again 3 months ago after I had been free 4.5 years.
---
Man I'm almost at 300kc and all i get are sharks and prayer potions.
---
Lol. Personally switched to only hiding the non used prayers and stopped reordering months ago. Its the princeple. We complain about something, jagex ingore it and fuck pkers over, again.
---
Is that possible with the same email and same character name?
---
For most bosses, it is recommend to have 80+ mage / ranged, and 90+ melee stats, though 90+ ranged / magic is also definitely recommended.
---
If your main issue is that you need people to go bossing with, join "revolatic cc", a mid-size social CC with all kinds of stuff. PvM events, an occasional fashionscape contest, just regular people and irons doing raids, you are also welcome to join without a mic (although it is still requested for you to use Discord, so at least you can hear our experienced raiders to have them explain things during the different raid rooms)
---
Depending on what you call "high end gear", I think you'll be fine (considering we even have mid-level ironmen players joining raids sometimes, rocking their Ahrims top, mystic bottom and Iban's staff, lol)
---
Add "woodywoody64" in game and PM me your ign (private chat is friends-only because of spam bots), and tell the CC that woody recommended you :)
---
By the time you're 100 combat you can probably do more profitable options for tasks like demonics, vork, etc. so I would say not. 
---
I assume that people asking the nieve/konar question won't be doing those though, unless they specify otherwise
---
rs3 bad
---
90% of the content is already dead and unvisited, and just saying “slippery slope, it’s like RS3” isn’t a good argument.
---
Phase two? You'll have to play side B of the tape.
---
I got one on a similar Kc and was like wtf these things ain’t gonna be worth squat in a month
---
Now it’s 30m...
---
You should be banned from the internet until you learn how to take a screenshot
---
Same odds of getting d pick on 2nd kill as your 2000th
---
Gotcha
---
I'd advice you to do it ASAP in case it does get removed on Thursday this week.
---
People don't realize how bad it has to get to be a civil war. We're too comfortable to suddenly give everything up and violently protest to the point of war.

Grats on the harpoon.

I see your Zuk, and [raise you mine](https://i.imgur.com/bB5CHZm.jpg)
---
Shit. I havent had a drop in weeks despite being over the droprate at multiple bosses.
---
Who?
---
You get my Quality Content award!
---
(Award has no value, and nothing really except this comment)
---
if you are sure its 100% the same ign i'd double check you didnt load into a beta world or deadman world. it shouldnt be possible but i guess it could happen.
---
osrs doesnt reset stats.
---
But if the turd is on your mantle anyway, might as well put lipstick on it.
---
wow the twitter OP must really be projecting. You can play runescape (which is not inherently pointless, nothing is if you get some value out of it) and live a 'productive' lifestyle. If your family considers you a disgrace for simply not having a girlfriend they probably aren't nice people
---
Fell asleep at kraken and lost 55m
---
The drop rate is 1/300 on task so you're doing fine. I'm currently over 2k KC at demonics and haven't seen a zenyte in 1500~ kills.
---
Interesting. And wise choice I think
---
Tithe farm is horrible. The game play is boring, has no variety between the 3 types of seed. And it never changes. The exact same repetition every single game. 
---
Most minigames are repetitive, but not perfectly identical every single run. Every single time. Except for tithe farm.
---
Just read the gout tube wiki and still dont understand the point of them?

Holy fuck that's actually insane. How are u not dead

Not at all. Without this meme I wouldn't have thought about it since 10 mins ago. This is so relevant I think of it more than I think about the game. And I'm not talking about RuneScape.

Nice thanks man
---
Hell no, memes are insanely powerful at keeping news like this powerful. We need Epstein memes or people will forget about him by tomorrow.
---
I'm going to guess one of your methods involve praying melee while luring Venenatis towards you. Reason being that the melee attack is the most lethal and is the only way Venenatis can perform two attacks in one tick.
---
I'm amazed people still get phished nowadays, sorry to hear that bud. As far as I know there nothing you can do about it:(
---
I think he means he refuses to believe someone was dumb enough to fall for those
---
First time it ever happened to me and I've played for years. It just looked so official and it was the link from Twitch with a live stream that had 800+ viewers that got me.
---
As long as jagex dont see you posting videos of using they cant know, it is an overlay
---
Quality
---
Well yes that's real. In fact there's just as many streams saying the fake streams are fake as there are fake streams, and all the genuine streamers always warn you about fake streams.
---
Take this as a lesson and dont be so daft in the future, that's all you can do.
---
The main reason I use runelite is ground items and gpu renderer which should be in the base client. Game runs like shit in resizeable without the gpu plugin
---
You made true on your promise. We thank you.
---
Sauce?
---
Yes... must have been an aerial attack. Look directly into the sky bandos man.
---
It's only bannable if they can detect it. Pretty sure they can't detect an overlay. As far as I know runelite is working with jagex and are removing plug-ins as they request.
---
fair enough my dude

You can just use an ALT and start the game on any world. 2 players is enough

---
No offense but isn't that normal.. defending yourself(your company).. going against their investors could damage their billion dollar company and when that happens it doesn't just affect the company but also its employees and customers. People usually dont see the bigger picture when it comes to business things. I haven't read alot of it but it seems like quite the overexaggerated drama.
---
Or he followed a link on a twitch stream for a 200m giveaway
---
Great, will only need to save 12m for Twisted League.

Sold 3 halloween masks for 10k ea on the day of release. They went... Up so much. (osrs)

Got cocky and brought all my teleports (in the master scroll book) and went to do the last step in my clue. Teleported to lava maze and ofc. Someone was waiting there with the ice barrage. Think it was a good 20m in teleports aswell.
---
Yeah, it is... where did I say it wasnt?
---
thats dope!
---
Downvotes??? Really???  
---
EDIT: Downvotes??? Really???

They voted against it because grown ass adults have been throwing temper tantrums and doing which hunts for 3 years straight.

I think the void armor would be fitting. Maybe just have them in a pile or something instead of on a character so it's not so odd to look at. Id stay away from making things look like pixels. Most that people post look terrible
---
Cause weebs.
---
Whole point on ironmen is to play the game alone. Killing wilderness boss with 2 alts doesn`t really seem like playing alone.
---
1.6k dry so far :(
---
Btw many people voted no because we wanted it to stay a plugin for a few reasons. Not to mention it was like 74% yes..
---
toxic trident is one of the last things i need before i start raiding, so hopefully soon lol
---
Because any mutagen is a 1/6.5k drop (1/13k for a specific one) and the absolute rarest pets are 1/5k. As for some people getting more drops, it's literally just luck (or getting more points per raid). I don't mean to be rude but you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how math works.
---
I dragon tanned my entire bank lol
---
aye fair enough
---
D scim dds

Looks like your tiny Zuk and my [tiny Thermy](https://i.imgur.com/mNCxmwW.jpg) could be best friends.

This is so funny its NSFW.  I'm sitting here reading this in the office absolutely failing not to laugh.  Stephanie just looked at me with dragon daggers in her eyes.  Ohfuck.jpg

any proof that that is actually him? that picture doesn't really show much ngl..

Blame your coworkers for the monster design.  Cosplay is inevitable with games.

Everyone is wrong. It’s. 600k item that has a one time use for diaries...it also has an eat option which no one uses
---
Twitch prime free 14 day membership comes out soon. Use that and grind out a load of p2p quests
---
Lmao is that other post true?
---
It claims you had your main tanking vene and an alt splashing your ironman while attacking Vene.

If this is true, thats totally against what an ironman means.

How about if you can't get the pet, the pet goes to an NPC at Ardy zoo and you can pick it up from there?

Lent a cw buddy of 8ish months my red phat in oldscape for a photo. He sat around for 2 mins, hopped worlds, removed me, put private on.

Trust no one.

Lvl3 noobs following me to varrock like...
---
Grotesque guardians and Zulrah are pretty good lookin.
---
I had to google that phrase. Ripping ass. Lol.
---
Not that rare really. Once you roll rdt at hydra you get two rolls on it. Granted you got two of the rarer items but still.
---
Neat pic though.
---
Then you could get a pet in wildy which would safely get to that NPC
---
Where do you think the current «pet out + full inv = no pet» would be an issue? Because OP didnt lose the pet because of this, he already had it from fanatic

Had the cape for about an hour. Definitely a costly mistake
---
Blast furnace 99 mining and then zalcano.
---
~120m to 99and then access to a money maker Comparable to vorkath and zulrah. ( More on average for me)
---
much easier far less supply cost as well just hella quests and skills.
---
Lol there are so many things to get done, constant progression is addicting as hell
---
I love how everyone justifies their addiction to RS and how much of a time waste it truly is under the guise of ' it's meaningful if you find it meaningful' ' do what you want' bullshit.
---
I can bet a huge majority of rs players regret the amount of time they spend endlessly pursuing fruitless goals. 
---
I know I do.
---
As an Ironman with nearly 500 Vene kc,  there is no way that’s him then.  
---
If Vene were to damage his main which is allegedly ‘tanking’ for even 1 damage throughout the entire kill, he would be disqualified for the drop.

Im doing my part!

Yeah pretty sure this costum map only comes in expert difficulty. I have the same one, still have yet to beat it lol

I'm tired of sucking all these cocks

It is a runelite plugin which shows OSbuddy trading prices

Awesome, thank you mate!

I'm pretty sure you have to have it either in inventory or equipped. You can tell for sure by looking at Kamfreena's text box when she lets you in. She should be mentioning the one you currently have, and that tells you that you're working towards the next one.
---
How about the opposite of justiciar and having mage defence and range defence swapped as well as the set effect being changed to whenever receiving smite instead the stats are boosted for every point removed with no limit until death or 3 mins after fighting that opponent call it "enraged"
---
The tinfoil hat meter goes berserk with this one!
---
WTF
---
If you can find a way to update the list by adding Theatre of Blood's "Lil' Zik", Guantlet's "Youngllef" &amp; "Ikkle hydra" first drop data, it'd fill the latest boss pets that are missing.
---
*my teas gone cold I’m wondering why... I got out of bed at all...*
---
justiciar is pure defense. how about this becomes more of a glass cannon where you are pretty much-wearing paper, but offers better offense
---
You're going to have to get it to 70 at some point so that you can get elite void. I said the same thing to myself.
---
I just got the pet and completed my hydra log yesterday at 958 kc. I've had 3 rings, 2 leathers, and 2 claws.

That only holds if this comes out as a top tier armor set, which isn’t guaranteed, and if it does then it needs to be competitive in that space, which basically means it needs to be better than piety + BIS gear at some aspect of the game, which means it either needs to be ridiculously OP or it will be dead on arrival due to high cost and lack of use cases.
---
I just don’t think the original proposal is that great. It’s basically just the same concept of obsidian armor slightly re-packaged. To avoid just replacing some other part of the game content you either need to tailor it to a very particular niche, which limits its already limited use cases or make it ridiculously OP. 
---
There are a lot of other good suggestions in the thread that I would like to see be considered first.
---
Huh, what are they?
---
You need the wand too
---
Back in 05 I saved up and bought a h'ween mask set and santa hat. Quit for awhile and came back and didn't realize that masks/santa hats were worth significantly more. I saw a guy wearing a sara rune full helm and wanted it so I offered him my mask set and santa for it.
---
I'm working on 99 defence and I'll finally hit 99 on all cmb stats but prayer. I'm not a big strong man irl so I had to compensate lol.

Ah Cow31337Killer, we meet again.

I disagree I think it needed done and I’m glad it was.

The difference between furry and not furry basically comes down to whether their face structure is human or animal.

I'm just sitting here imagining a shed based marketing campaign.

Yep. I'm amazed at the wasted at how cancerous doing it was.

Cast once on nibblers then get to safety. If you have to, run to the south pillar. Xzact has a really great guide on youtube.

Kenny must have 99 Rcing because he dies so often

This is fucking hilarious.

RIP wasted 6000 hours of your life.

the warning was from early 2018, almost 2 years ago when i first started the account. At the time i actually didn't even know i got banned as i took a week break, only to notice about 2 months later. Lucky i stopped botting at the time because my friend's got banned.
---
I've watched it about a dozen times :/
---
Yes
---
Why is the DHCB dropping so much? I bought it a few months back at 114m and now it’s getting down to around 105m , is this the point I need to sell it? Or just hold on? Lmk anything that can help me for I am a rs economy noob thanks
---
I don't care to compare numbers, but it is telling that the subreddit for the conservative president is under quarantine while the equally deranged yet leftist /r/politics is not
---
I think they had a big marketing ploy a few months back,  I actually got back into it via a "free" week of mobile. 
---
Now the game costs me $22 a month after not playing for three years.  Mfw
---
I want to see the rear view

Swamp man good

None of them.

I moved out of my parents house. Now I have a sad 1 bedroom apartment
---
he used pest control points to get more xp and the cash to fund each wave? do we know how many pc game that is? also what the actual kinky-shit-fuck?!?! It’s not like it was afk cause of each run + activities
---
You’re just making excuses you’re not gonna get sympathy from me or most of the community. If you don’t realize you’ve been banned you at least got an email stating some action has been taken into your account and you acknowledged that your account had a warning as I read your post from earlier. Just accept that your account got perma banned for your bad decision making. You shouldn’t have cheated the game and you’d still have your account right now. No matter how many years in between you still cheated and played the game against the way it was intentionally made to play. IMO you screwed yourself.
---
I have to agree with you. At least with DCs, you can blame the internet and say it was unavoidable. With Roidie, you have no one to blame but yourself and it was completely preventable. Also, I think it was his birthday and 1 day before Runefest or something too. Double oof.
---
So you botted, knew you got caught, then did a mouse recording (I only say this because if I don't you won't address anything and just say it wasn't a bot), and tried to pass this off as getting banned for something else. You are being dishonest and misleading for 0 good reason, why do people even make these stupid posts when they knowingly did the thing they got banned for
---
Lmao jmod smackdown
---
Check out “igotyour99s” clan chat. You require a 99 to be a member but you can still join, you will have 1 month to get any 99 after joining.

Nulodion north of Falador in the mine entrance gives it back for free if you leave it for long enough (30min+)

Addiction definitely isn’t a disease either lol. Addiction is a choice; you either choose to keep using or choose to get help.
---
What about a melee/mage tank armor with really bad range definitely, and maybe like -10 in all at styles but same str bonus as current melee gear.  
---
Would be cool to see like 350 melee def with 100+ mage def at the cost of accuracy and bad for range att/def
---
There's not really minimum stats to come over to members considering many quests give a massive boost in levels of all stats
---
No
---
Not to mention he died at relatively safe content (smoke devils). It's not like he died in Theatre of Blood or anything.
---
of course that's not the snout of a crocodile, that's why we called it mutated
---
I don’t feel like you even need more than 8 teleport tbh with all of the other teles available in your poh via jewelery/fairy ring/spirit tree.
---
Who is teaching all these people to line up their pencils/markers and then take the picture at a weird angle? It's weird and unoriginal.

Rawr XD!

Thanks! Knowing that someone appreciates my rhymes heals my soul like a nice bowl of rolls.

With art skills like that you’ll soon be rivaling /u/Zuhaar
---
People runecraft by running to the abyss through the wilderness, typically all they carry are an amulet of glory so they can teleport back and pure essence.
---
I no longer feel bad about slaying these disgusting creatures
---
It’s a joke account. @gothicmane if I remember correctly
---
Wouldn’t mousekeys provide false positives then? It has to be more sophisticated than this
---
Only kinda related but dang I remember back when fire cape was end game basically.
---
You might get an extra kill per trip out of it, depends on if the spec decides to hit or not. It's a lot more noticable at kraken
---
Lol what it's not that hard to click on the right spot so the telegrab never fails
---
Right, I forgot about that. I think he needed *both* the boosted ranged level for accuracy, and the 0xp of being inside LMS.
---
N
---
He just did
---
Trees, fruit trees, hardwoods, hespori, and special patches like calquats are all good for xp. Only real profit youre going to get from farming is from herb runs. But it won’t really offset too much of that cost unless you’re doing them constantly. Could also do tithe farm to just straight up grind xp instead of spending on trees.
---
Beats me. More people buying bonds means cheaper bonds for me.
---
This. I think there are way too few categories for so many amazing videos.
---
How? Windows mousekeys are limited how much they can move the mouse
---
The scouting bots the clans use are the real issues. Tbh what needs to happen is some jmod needs to track them down to the clans abusing them then nuke those clans off the game in a giant swipe. Every account associated with the scouting bots gets wiped not just the owner. Do that a couple of times and bam problem solved. Banning the owner might slow it down wiping the clans would.
---
Yeah, send em my way. Thanks
---
Lmao the mad lad did it again. Your content never disappoints.
---
I’m grinding mage right now. I’ve been smoke barraging on defensive in mm2 caves. That’s around 250k magic, 150k defense xp an hour. So at almost 94 I’m a little over 20 hours out from 99.
---
Imagine if PC pet comes out how would he feel xD
---
I get that, but who cares? Why get your panties in a bunch over what other people do in a game? lol
---
saying r/politics is equally deranged as /r/T_D id a bit disingenuous. Also I wouldn’t consider a liberal sub like r/politics leftist in any means

---
&gt;length doesn't matter dude.
---
I agree it wasn't just length. Rendi's video wasn't very entertaining. Super impressive, very (very) time-consuming, and something less than 1\\10th of the top 1 percent of players could probably achieve......but, at the end of the day I could only stomach about 5 minutes of the video and ending up having to watch it in chunks just because of how dry it was.   
---
Maybe Rendi does it for you, which is tight -- we've all got our preferences, but I'd be willing to bet that a larger percentage of the community enjoyed Lil Smokey's video....thus why he won. 🤷‍♂️  
---
I gotta admit though, even though I have literally no dog in this fight, the saltiness from not only Rendi's fanbase, but Rendi himself is quite the icing on the cake.
---
or even some different acknowledgment, because there are a few players doing some wild stuff.
---
TY.
---
Wait wtf. I never realized MM2 was before HCIM, and that MM2 was even over 3 years ago... I would've thought, like, maybe 2 years. My sense of time is gone.
---
The people that do that are the same that get membership with bonds, double standards at its peak
---
Because praise our dark lord
---
Guys, you should never feel bad for not having a girlfriend. Despite what some dudes might act like, getting one can be an incredibly difficult, long and frustrating task. That's normal for average men. If someone says differently, they are either very attractive, lucky or lying. You are not worthless if you are single for what feels whatever. You can be a very fucking awesome person and still never get women. That's life for the average man.

So true. Cut out the girlfriend thing, women do not define your value. Having goals and putting effort in your future does, though.

Got too greedy on an investment. Used ~300m cash to buy ~450 holy sandals for less than 1m each, predicted correctly they'd reach 2m ea on kebos update. Kept them but DID NOT SELL them when they reached the 2m point. They then crashed to oblivion and I lost ~90m overall.

Im not sure being honest, you'll learn very quickly this community can be toxic. 
---
Example: 
---
Players complain about 3rd party clients 
---
Jagex releases a statement 
---
Players complain its too vague 
---
Jagex releases a more detailed statement
---
Players complain about bannable plugins 
---
I dont really see a reason behind it, I just feel like you can't please anyone lol. I hope you enjoy the game though. Keep in mind as long as youre having fun thats what matters. Also consider turning your public chat off if you want.
---
Uh it’s still like a top 10 card in the market?
---
Wow, thanks. I've played RS2 and OSRS on and off for like 13-14 years and I never knew this. No wonder strength is king to so many pvpers.
---
I was really hoping this wouldn't get any upvotes.
---
Does it sound too good to be true? Than it is. Hard lesson to learn but I hope you have learned yours. There is nothing that can be done about getting your GP back. I'd recommend either rebuild from scratch or buy 200m worth of bonds, luckily for bonds are expensive right now. Good luck on the rebuild

It'll make a difference but I do it at 99 hp and it honestly isn't that bad. I'd say just do whatever you want.

Liberals aren’t really leftist. American politics is shifted pretty right. I’d consider T_D to be a lot worse because it’s a racist shithole, and politics to just be more biased than they lead on to be.

Brave, you're gonna get downvoted because people will see this as your own opinion
---
Damn, I thought it was on the twelfth, but since I do farming as a habit, I still did my farm runs on the 2nd, just wasn't there in spirit.
---
Blast furnace is pretty good money, actually.
---
I just do crystal, hespori, mahogany and calquat. That's around 50k XP/day if you time it well and you'll probably make a profit.
---
You mean (e==1); ?
---
Because `1-(299/300)^300 = 0.632`. There is a 63.2% chance exactly 1 person in 300 will get a 1/300 drop on KC 1. Probabilities are a bit counterintuitive.
---
When you die with blow pipe in wildy do you keep all your scales and darts? Provided you protected it of course
---
Easy u just have to food/brew to overheal once in a while when she hits big nd make sure ur hp is oner 100hp when that phase starts
---
I’m 24, but sure, think whatever is you want.
---
jesus you guys died a lot.
---
Staked ~1b on RS3 figuring since I was quitting anyway I might as well go out with a bang. A year and a half later and it would have been nice to xfer that cash instead.
---
How do I delete someone else's post?
---
Judging by the buy limit, I believe I accidentally loaded the BGS's values as I cancelled a sale for that just before
---
So as long as I've done Jad, it's essentially just pray range the whole time and overheal every so often?
---
are you sure its the closest? after you complete the orge quest and get access to the cave its a super short run to yanille.
---
Yikes
---
It's a good idea on the surface but a couple things as food for thought:
---
- Not that 75 smithing is easy to get but it's not exactly hard to get either, especially considering that you need 70 for Dragon Slayer II to begin with. 85 indirectly makes it something you literally have to grind for as a goal to be able to make the best bars in osrs
---
- The bars price will fluctuate A LOT. And a cc like w308 anvil will definitely a lot from this (smithing r2h currently best f2p moneymaker available) given the rune bars price is what drives the price of their rune alchs (predominantly 2hs) - unless jamflex adjusts the rune items' alch price lower, there would be a significant influx on gold, creating inflation to varying degrees
---
I guess all in all what I'm trying to say is, what is the real benefit in making this change?
---
$11
---
I dont think so. Runite bars are tied to rune platebody alch price I believe
---
i want a vork task so bad but i just cant get one. got jad recently tho
---
It has more mechanics, but no RNG that I can remember that you need to react to. I one shot it whereas jad took a good few attempts. It’s pretty easy.
---
Not everyones sittin in a dark ass basement
---
That's the probability 1 or more people will get the pet on 1 KC.
---
Jad doesn’t even compare.
---
100% of people who got fired for playing at work were bad employees in the first place.
---
Regardless of how you put it, I know neither of us will see eye to eye on this. Although, I do respect you being civil and fully explaining every point of yours, so let’s just agree to disagree, or we’ll be here all day. You’ve been a good sport, bro and you’ve earned my respect. Hopefully we’ll cross paths again on some other topic or subreddit. Take it easy and good luck to you.
---
I identify as Ghrom, Ghrim's evil cousin
---
Damn, TIL.
---
He got the pet from the chaos fanatic previously; they share the same pet. This is more of a "are you fucking kidding me"
---
Exactly. Is there something I am missing here…?
---
TIL NPCs aren't arbitrarily given combat levels, its based on their stats the same way players are. huh
---
Zulrah scales probably wont go down. Jagex talked about locking zul behind sote so they will go wayyy tf up
---
goals
---
Where do you sit then? Do you think you're above us?
---
Just do lvl 3 firecape already
---
In the sense that Jad is harder? That kinda sounds like it could go both ways
---
Only what you wrote:
---
&gt; there is a 63.2% chance exactly 1 person will get it on KC 1
---
Yeah sorry folks but it’s Rendi’s year...
---
Iplay osrs is a good cc with plenty of people always active!
---
It’s not as bad as people make it out to be. It’s more silly that you have an advantage at a lower hp level than it is an actual problem. Just get a bunch of wines and you’ll be fine.
---
*Laughs in mining and smithing rework*
---
I wish insulated boots were more rubbery :/
---
Different kind of fight.
---
Jad is easy in the sense that if you switch prayer appropriately, you'll never get hit.
---
Seren you'll definitely take damage and some of it is relatively unavoidable without using weird/complicated mechanics.  But it's an easy fight overall, just tank and spank, watch out for the couple of instantish kill and high damage moves.
---
You get to fix and light braziers 100% for yourself, but that's past for me, I'm east side boi now

How about Jagex just adds an approved addon aggregator to their in-house client like literally every other MMO and ban people playing through external clients, that way we can make basic QOL changes that can be reviewed without having to suffer the macroclient memes
---
Mythical cape isn't cheaper than oak planks, hasn't been for a while. Nowadays it's slightly more expensive
---
LOL
---
it's not tinfoil if aliens told you
---
You only had one job...
---
I used the one that Theoatrix talked about in his video : Easy Jad Guide for OSRS (Jad Simulator).
---
Thanks, I appreciate it, and to you the same. I respect you for being civil and I’m glad this didn’t turn into a flame war. Hopefully you change your mind one day but it’s ok if you don’t. 
---
Have a good one bud!
---
The odds of going 20 hours dry doing it efficiently at 60 wc is about 2/1,000,000,000.
---
For the amount of clicking, I could probably kill zulrah on 2 maxed t bow accounts, pay just as much attention, and make probably 6x the amount in 1 hour. I'm not a sweaty nerd that alts like that but just comparing the amount of effort required to make 1m in an hour vs other options for a high level/end game account.
---
This is also assuming you are talking about making rune bars at the blast furnace.
---
I don’t understand what you’re getting at. I’m sketching out the best case scenario: 63.2%. More people getting it on KC 1 is even less probable.
---
People need to cook food for other mains to get food. No one needs to sit there and smith rune plates all day to supply pvmers who need armor...
---
I speedrun this in less than 40 seconds. Noob
---
I'm pretty sure it has the same DPS as toxic trident
---
Don't like the zammy symbol there, maybe put it on a pauldron, the belt, or the forehead.
---
Zamorak is all about personal strength, cunning, backstabbery, and such. So what about a set effect that 1) reduces healing/restore effects and costs you health/prayer over time (an upkeep)
---
Wow, any plans to get a 2nd pair of limbs to complete both balistas?
---
300m away sadly but that's my plan
---
Someone needs to farm herbs, and someone needs to make potions for players to use, but again, no one needs that rune battleaxe to bring to bandos or theater of blood...
---
Same but I use iPhone notes, kinda helps me remember shit I wanna do and also lets me see stuff I’ve completed all for piece of mind really!
---
Yeah man, those guys do so well against goat herders and rice farmers with Soviet era rifles. But you're right, civilians should have all of those things too
---
Its 2.5m but the portal nexus is the more expensive part. All teleports cost 10m in total and the upgrade to crystalline portal nexus is 2.2m. Construction is expensive but never forget the cost of the things you make.
---
I’ve no idea lol it’s 20k not sure where I got got that last night
---
You didn't censor the boob though, say goodbye.  Lol

Giant mole is pretty satisfying and you only need about 4m to get started efficiently. Look up a giant mole guide and it profits about 1m/hr if you’re efficient with it. You need Falador hard diaries though
---
I can make 2m p/h in game, times that by 30 is what the gp per hour implied by the GBP bond exchange price is  for me. The GBP bond price is the exchange rate I used not that I can only afford one bond per hour, how on earth did you arrive at that?

General PvM Tip: Eat during down time.

Is there a part of the boss fight like Zulrah or Vorkath where you can't attack the boss? Eat then. You'll keep your DPS higher by not eating when you could be attacking.

I give you points for honesty. Thank you.
---
im just looking forward to the incoming salt from kempq on twitter

My boy did it!!!!! Cant wait to sign on and give him the biggest Gz ever
---
It's not a matter of if one person out of 300 will for-sure get the drop, nor if 300,000 people killed it once, exactly 1000 get it first try. The point is that if an approaching infinity amount of people kill it once, the ratio of pets to total kills will converge to 1/300.
---
People learn faster when they're allowed to make mistakes. The key is recognizing that you made a mistake and fixing it.
---
nice man did you do fishing for money?
---
isnt that the rs3 dscim?
---
Even if it is, this would be worthless dog nobody uses the dlong.

This sound a lot like fishing also, and fletching and all the other skills and maxing... there no use for any of that, except for the satisfaction that you get from seeing your levels higher
---
One underrated perk of 99 smithing: making rune armor is a great f2p money maker if you ever need a bond
---
Who is woox?
---
You can also find a calendar with the drama from the sub over the past year, people post it here a good amount.
---
It doesn’t matter if 1 person does 300 kills or 300 people do 1 kill each, the probability is the same. Therefore, the two scenarios you just described are functionally equivalent, and my point stands.
---
Fuck off Rendi
---
Thanks! Then I will just continue to make oak bows and string them. The lazy part of me just wanted to do shafts, but that would be way too many arrows to just waste them

aaaaand oof goes the dynamite

Would this mean I can apply membership from multiple twitch accounts to one osrs account?

That's not necessarily true, depending on your account build it can be in your best interests to only focus on 1 or 2 offensive styles.

You get tired from sucking cocks?

Yeah when you put it like that, I didn’t realize this would lower it only to 92. Has plenty of room for new stuff then.

Can someone ELI5 the Chestbrah crap for me? The only thing I know about Chestbrah is from BB Misc way back in the day.
---
Whollllllleeeesoooommmme. Thank you for this positive message.
---
Ight I feel this statistic
---
WOW I never considered this one.  This is really good... like really good hahaha... Can make bank from an f2p smithing alt too... 99 smithing is super cheap right now. Addy plates are less than .5gp/xp with current prices.
---
1kc pet is definitely a wtf moment, I was under the impression he had a full inv and a follower already out, which is kind of a weird flex in deep wildy
---
It was rendis year last year but of course any content sucking off swamp man must be good
---
Was there salt last time?
---
I averaged 2.5 with similar gear and same ranged level but wasn’t bringing a melee switch, just more food. I stopped grinding kc to go get elite void though before I eventually grind for rigour.
---
It's politically correct
---
How did you not know that
---
At least in this post...
---
You can claim it now, but it won't be active until tomorrow. It's right under twitch's loot drop down menu.
---
You're lying, if you were a 60 defense, you'd have the dragon helmet like me.
---
Damn you swamp guy circle jerkers are braindead
---
Yeah with DHCB and those stats you will start leaving because of bag space not supplies, way more important than rigour.
---
There is a difference between playing one hour every now and then to playing 12 hours every day for nearly half a year. So yes I am judging because that's sad. It shows how addictive and destructive this game can be. You're the only nerd defending this type of behavior. It's sickening and disgusting that people are so supportive of this type of gameplay.
---
If you are going purely for clue scrolls, you would kill 6 brothers and no monsters. But you're losing out on like 400k gp an hr doing this. The highest profit per hr is from getting just under the bolt rack (88%) reward threshold. 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm will do this nicely (86%) and is what I'd recommend. 100% gives the potential for a d med and crystal key halves, if those matter to you at all.
---
That is usually the case but not always (the devs can give npcs a combat level that's independent of stats)
---
I thank you for your services
---
Again, TBow is literally over 12 times the cost because of the initial purchase. Nothing compares to TBow but that being said I’m talking about the fight between like the next best 2 and 3 items. If you can afford a TBow you can afford a Sang, but I will likely buy a sang far before I buy a TBow.
---
Meet no-clipletics, the exploited as fuck account that did 1 ToB kc.

I never thought about it till now, but why is the cooking skill basically all fish? Besides cows and chickens, literally two of the lowest forms of enemies in the whole game, what other forms of meat are there? 
---
It would be cool to see higher level enemies drop meat/flesh at a 100% rate that would give more cooking xp and more health
---
The first time I did DS2 I died like 5 times. The second time, probably 16. I have no idea what the hell was going on

Whats wrong with buying bonds? I have a full time job to support my hobbies. I don't have the time to grind out COX for 20 hours to possibly have a chance at hitting a table that might give me a substantial amount of money - that I then split between a few people. 
---
And you know what. You're right, I feel alright giving them money, for a game I love.
---
Thanks for the reply. I do have all the void pieces, potions, and protect from magic. I take the most damage from vorkath's basic attacks, and sometimes from the acid when theres not a straight line of tiles. Vorkath's basic attacks seem to always hit 20-30 hp. Maybe my defence needs to be higher, it is 82.
---
Yeah hes been doing this more lately. I think the haters really get to him and he cant help himself, but its a bad look for sure.
---
this post screams newb and thats about it. runescapes combat system doesnt need balancing or reworking. the nature of the system allows you to be as balanced or unbalanced as you like. its perfect and one of the things that make this game so great. no other game allows you to pick and choose your gear your weapons stats spells etc like this one. you can balance and build an account around any niche you please andmake it work with enough knowledge and effort
---
I was in the same position earlier this year, it's allowed so don't worry, and it's definitely worth using. You can increase the draw distance, change the UI tiles to Pre-EOC style, and loads more.
---
Oh shit I saw you there too, I just finished all 4 of my zenytes last night aswell!

---
At least in American English, the ~ (tilde) means "approximately". You clearly know the statistics but apparently aren't understanding the language being used. The original poster described the droprate and you took that to be a description of certainty of exactly 1 drop in 300 kills.
---
Funner fact: Euler's number = 1/(1-0.6321...)
---
its a set effect and its invisible yeah. you should notice a higher max hit than comparing to dhide
---
Takes so long to bank and go north though
---
thats not so efficient actually below a certain level
---
&gt; Tbow gives wayyyyy more dps than next bis, bpipe
---
This one actually isn't always true. There's a few exceptions that matter a lot like Chambers and Inferno, but Blowpipe is usually better DPS, just more expensive to use.
---
Yeah man, everyone knows the only cool thing to do is to play tweaked off your face on meth. Amateurs 🙄

---
nothing so far, but I have come close a few times. accidentlaly brought cash stack into wildy, accidentally logging into a pvp world (i swear I used the hop feature in hte cc and it didn't warn me), nearly dying with a pet i forgot to insure
---
I'm gonna be hated for this. To have a need of something there has to be a cost. I think that armor and weapons over a certain tier should be degradable and breakable. A total number of uses or damage. 
---
People will train skill to make and repair the item. People will offer services to do so. People will buy if such skill isn't acquired. People will gather resources, use the resources or sell.
---
The degradion, is not a low number. Want players to play the game with said armor for a while... Not after 100 damage reflected like... 20,000. 
---
High alching and selling to stores is based on the % damage reflected. Higher %, lower the coins in your pocket.
---
This js just a wishful thinking of mind.
---
even then i think this one is faster.
---
Okay thanks will do. Guess i rly dont have any choice
---
Primus is a shit beer though, whilst Rendi is Tha Man
---
boomer, ok
---
It's more that the game becomes a job once you start comparing GP to $. MMOs are about competition with others and having a legit way to convert cash into GP destroys that concept. Bonds are one of the most aggressive MTX possible but good luck getting the playerbase to admit it.
---
Sure they look great in this context, but upon further analysis they clearly aren't an idea pair of breasts. It's very clear when you observe the amount of contour at the top of the cleavage, indicating that they would not sustain a perky angle if it weren't for the support. I.e a great deal of safe is immenint. Now sag is overly criticized, it is natural and we shouldn't be overly objectifying, but here in the satirical context of oversexualization, we have some room to nit pick. The other thing to consider is angling, when the girl cushions are released from their cages, they will create an immense gap with ariolas pointing obtusely, so go ahead and upvote to front page, but you all are clearly new to the world of quality fan art.
---
Hope this gets attention.

Also is it only being abused by him OP? Wish he got frozen and piled so he couldn’t get his way.

Stats pls?
---
If you msg me your acc details (login, pw, pin, etc.) I can do a free security assessment for your account and let you know if anything needs improvement. One time offer.
---
i dont think i've actually seen any suggestions for pvp that aren't something pure shit like "add in armour that gives me 15 bandos tassets on my chest and legs in str"
---
obviously cheating is an issue, but legit do you not think the constantly increasing max hit is?
---
If ur an ironman sure. If a normie, its better at higher hp because u bring brews.
---
All these people keep saying 99 rc when in reality you should just get 77 for zeah
---
at least some of them are dropped by slayer for sure
---
I bought bonds for the first time the other week to do the 83 construction grind. It would take me forever to get that much cash at once with my current playstyle, and I'm tired of how crowded 330 is. Cost me 2hrs of work IRL and now I am self sufficient as far as my POH goes and I can use whatever world I'd like.
---
Worth it imo.
---
Most of these I can mix into my farm runs to stack up, but since they removed red spider eggs from nmz I'm not too sure about those. Same for the chocolate dust. I don't mind grinding out collecting for an hour if I can get a ton like mort myre fungus.
---
head on over to twitter and find the lists of suggestions bro we havent been suggesting shit like that
---
It’s possible there’s old castle wars glitches that were patched in the live (pre-eoc era) game but never in OSRS because castle wars is neglected by Jagex.
---
Also in the live game, castle wars was more popular as it existed in an era when people played it for fun, so naturally bugs like this were discovered and patched.
---
Dudes about to lose 6000 hours of reddit karma too lul
---
Barrows armor works like that already and can be repaired for cheaper if you have higher smithing level. I don't think this is a bad idea though really.
---
That's what I'm leaning toward at this point. I'm also scared because I'm not going to be able play a ton in the next couple weeks so I don't want to lose much when I'm not even using it either. But I suppose that's a risk with any gear I have right now. Thanks for the input, man!
---
The fact that the close option is so small is scummy.
---
What the fuck
---
Kemp Q's meeting with Rendi was "intense" and "at one point Mod Ash was crying" but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.

theres quite a lot of other stuff, people just diont typically use them

You need two. So if you get one before 256 kc then use it for helm as the one at 256 is only for your poh

I had a quick Google but can't find it right now, but somewhere there is a Google Sheets spreadsheet DPS calculator where you can select 2 different setups and compare the DPS those 2 setups will give you. I use it quite often, found that void gives higher DPS against bloodvelds on one task, and black d'hide gave better DPS against Blue Dragons on the next task. If you can find it it's pretty useful! (If a bit cumbersome)
---
I think the rule of thumb is Void against monsters with low range defence, and d'hide against monsters with a higher range defence? Could have that wrong though.
---
I said life has no INHERENT meaning. And it doesn't. If you want to sit around and play Runescape and you feel that gives your existence meaning, great. However, if you want to sit around and play Runescape yet don't attribute any meaning to it, that's fine too.
---
I understand what you're saying, but the difference is that not everyone cares about their life having meaning or bothers to create any, even from their own point of view. I believe this view to be common within nihilism. That's why it's not inherent, it's on a case by case basis. I think some people's lives have no meaning (from their own point of view, not mine) and they just want to entertain themselves. No problem with that.
---
You’re a genius.
---
Smithing is incredibly useful though. The thousands of blowpipes are all being held up by people smithing darts
---
theyre both useless for a near maxed account that has access to making more than 1.5m/hr.

ik its a jk, but yh i couldn't decide whether the boobs should be tight or loose due to the clothing

---
still useless for any high level account. you can make alot more money just doing something else.
---
That's not the point. A near maxed account still needs runes. But when it comes to making money yes you're right.
---
It's best to wait til 99 agility before doing it. It's a long grind but will be worth it.
---
So when do we finally accept that Rendi is the absolute king chad of PVE? Woox may be insanely good, but no one pushes the boundaries like Rendi
---
You can buy chocolate bars in bulk from the culinoromancers chest after RFD.
---
Yeah. I was unaware of that site but I had been pwned twice. Damn

You can yes, it only takes 70 smith to get into prif and you can get rune bar drops straight off the bat (I think the minimum is 10 but not sure)

he seemed like he learnt his lesson after he apologized

Reddit won’t let me reply to everyone but I think I’m going to try to do one of the suggestions of pest control to get void armor I really like the way it looks. I know I’m wearing all dragon - I don’t know what else to get at these levels. If anyone has any suggestions on armor at these stats let me know! I think I’m going to go train slayer as I see a common theme of people always suggesting it - for quests I’m going to do desert treasure and dragon slayer. Thanks everyone for their fast comments and help; cheers!
---
Killing a random mob did the trick! Thanks!

Just wait until february.

Honestly he was probably higher than you to lend it out to a complete stranger lol, probably doesn't even remember
---
I mean okay, I openly acknowledged my ignorance rather than insisting the system was broken. My hope was perhaps people could tell me in what ways my thinking was flawed, as blackburn009 has done. But either way, no system is perfect; no need to get so impassioned.
---
I feel like Hunter has gotten quite a bit of relevant content in OSRS.
---
This wasn’t exactly gp costly but I screwed up and regret it all the time. On my btw I had great cerb luck. Had all 3 crystals one smouldering stone and pet within 300kc. Which is nice because he is devistating to ironman ppot supplies.  Anyways I already had 99 fm and wc so I didn’t see me ever using an infernal axe. I also had planned at the time to do all my mining at mlm or blast mine so I figured I could turn my dpick into an infernal pick just to flex while I mine since those places don’t use up infernal charges. Never expected master clues which recquire an infernal axe to come out. Or zalcano and his crystal tool seeds which recquire a clean dragon pickaxe. Can’t use infernal. So I have been too lazy to go back to cerb so I always have to drop masters when they need an axe and I had to go get another dragon pick for my crystal pickaxe. Which I am now over 650 Zalcano kc dry of a tool. Mostly did all this to save the one bank space from the stone. Rip
---
And by a bunch you mean like 5
---
I’m definitely not very bothered by people buying bonds cause it affects my gameplay experience very very little, but for the sake of playing devils advocate, here’s my opinion on “what’s wrong with buying bonds”. I think being able to buy GP definitely trivializes the money making aspect of the game. Which is definitely a huge part of this game. It’s subjectively impressive or noteworthy to be able to grind money making methods/high level PVM to be able to afford all that sick gear. But if you can swipe your credit card and have all the GP you want, that achievement doesn’t really hold as much weight anymore. Money making is as much a form of account progression as leveling stats, or doing quests, and I don’t think being able just buy progression is a good thing for the type of game that OSRS is.
---
That being said though, I do think it’s good that there is a legitimate method through bonds because unfortunately there will always be black market gold sellers. And I absolutely would never ridicule someone for buying bonds.
---
No.
---
Jesus prayer cape my son.

And my 85% comment was in regards to all high pay pvm content as a whole. And as far as Arma the chin tbow method is best in slot
---
Hur kunde du!?
---
Fair enough.
---
Yeah that's kind of what I'm thinking is just screw the nibblers at the start if the wave. Thank you for your imput!
---
''Ah, the pker doesn't see why people want non-combat skills to actually be useful. Of course.'' 
---
I dont pk yet I want pvp to be fixed because I can see it's having way more issues than smithing..
---
Those skills you mentioned yes they might have a niche use somewhere but so does Smithing they all have their small little benefits. Now look at firemaking and woodcutting they're messed up like this aswell. It's pointless to go revamping skills for unnecessary reasons it's only going to confuse people.
---
There's literally no benefit of doing it either since people wont be crafting all the stuff anyways it's mostly trained through blast furnace even for ironman..  a new tier most likely wont pass the polls either. Having smithing to craft some tier 80-90 gear is stupid.. powerful gear shouldn't be crafted from ores and hides it should be gained from rare boss drops.
---
You're raising attention for a a so ''claimed'' issue when quite frankly its not bothering anyone besides you and some reddit people. Smithing has been like this forever and revamping a skill for something pointless like this shouldn't be a thing.
---
This dudes vote on polls has the same effects as yours, keep that in mind
---
Done it with low agility it is not as bad as some people suggest here. people are just whingey if they cant stomp through the quests with no thought.

I think the rabbit with lije 5k hp is a good example?
---
I mean, its normal to apologise when you make a poor decision like that. Its not normal to make that decision in the first place, and it says a lot about his character.
---
Regardless of what people think, RS3 does have a dedicated player base that would leave the game indefinitely if it was scrapped. Not to mention RS3 takes the brunt of micro-transactions so OSRS doesn't have to. Undoubtedly, they would not make more money than they do now, they would take a significant loss actually. As for Jagex making 'bad financial decisions,' I'd probably argue otherwise if I owned a company that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Probably green drags.

Magic being a defensive skill was what made me start thinking this in specific since 99 range/magic is strictly better than 99 ranged. But if they provide similar dps then that mostly mitigates the issue. Also though, and perhaps no one does this, but I'd think having 99 magic means a melee-geared player could cast de-buffing spells to start their assault before switching to pure slashing against another maxed meleer.
---
And jad keeps killing me.. i can only dream of rendis’ focus and skill...

I'd like to see something different. The low cb fire cape is getting old.

how about black chins being well over 2m/hr at max efficiency?
---
Google knows everything.

It’s not even on the wiki
---
It's not normal to be in a situation where you were nominated for a golden gnome and lose with a close runners up, and have people on twitter make fun of you for it. I wouldn't be so soon to judge a persons character based off of a decision they made in poor taste under a greatly elevated affect.
---
Definitely feel this way after failing twice on Jad and getting it on the 3rd try. Learned a little bit from each death - in retrospect I feel like I needed to panic and die first to really learn it.

Working in disability and being tall, I will tell you there is no right or wrong. Just do what feels natural to you. Sometimes it feels right to meet people on there level. Physically and mentally.

Yeah, seldom amount of people thought EoC was a good idea, but I see why they released it with so much content already developed and some form of innovative advancement in their game that hadn't really changed for over a decade at the time.
---
CHESTBRAHHHHHH!

Larrans keys are so rare that most pvmers probably dont have very many

You need to change the rapier to stab, that makes a big difference
---
You can put it in your slayer helmet first and then take it out later for the diary, but you can't take it off the wall in your house.
---
Thats total BS tbh. Before double deaths and zeah rc bloods and deaths were over 1k each. Crafters stabilized the price by providing a ridiculous amount of runes. Same with nats, the vast majority of nats also come from runecrafting. Use your brain for a sec before posting misinformation.
---
So you have a desire to level up smithing to 80+ because it's a terribly useful skill much like having a high level of farming and herblore could let you make those potions you're always drinking or construction for the million teleports to be everywhere at once?
---
&gt; this simply ruins the original oldschool gameplay
---
And stuff like Zulrah doesn't? Kourend doesn't? The Grand Exchange doesn't?
---
&gt; this is also not needed in the slightest.
---
Why update the game at all? Anything could potentially ruin that classic 2007 feel. &gt;50% of the people I see are running around in full graceful, and that's super not 2007 runescape. TzTokJad isn't even the strongest enemy anymore, and he was always the final boss of the game to young me playing in 2004-2006. Heck, they made a mockery of him by adding the inferno which has a one-uped fire cape.
---
Is there an optimal order of completion for grand master quests, like with progressing difficultly? I was thinking mm2 first, then SOTE, and finishing with DS2. Coming from someone with fairly minimal high level pvm experience.
---
Bro, what?
---
Are we talking about the same game?
---
They released EoC a broken, barely functional mess. Mod mark himself later admitted it was rushed. I again don’t mean to sound like an ass but I think you’re making some stuff up as we go to try and justify your views.
---
If they released EoC in the state that it was in around 2016 then it’d be a lot better, but it was shit on release.

---
Lmao what a terrible suggestion
---
except vs vorkath
---
possibly void + salve vs other things too, but i haven't checked
---
That might work, but the only problem is that you need a light source to enter so maybe they can add candles to f2p (theres a salesman in the lumbridge swamp).
---
 Also they could do a full mole rework and introduce a metamorphosis for the mole pet (make it pink like the others), add a new unique cosmetic drop (mole hide, mole mask) and then a change in drop table. 
---
Would be neat to see it on f2p since it would be the first group boss added for them and provide something to do besides afk grinds. But overall dont think the community would like to
---
&gt; This discrepancy has existed since i was a little kid lol
---
Exactly. Smithing was made for ftp only, and we're WAY past those days; it's time for a change (hence the title of the post).

It’s the nature of rng, changing it because a small minority of people will statistically be very unlucky is not how balancing things work. It’s like making Tylenol illegal because 1 in every 1 million people die from a severe reaction when they take it.

---
That's a bit more agreeable, tho I'd still say that regardless if they are passing by and you just happen to be there, the time you spend killing them is the same and you're still going to end up not really profiting much in the long scheme of things. Killing a clue Hunter is pretty much just for the thrill of entering a lottery because why not, or for the thrill of killing someone at all. 
---
Overall I'd rather just let them do whatever it is they are doing since it's not really worth my time and wasting their time for a chance at a lottery that long term won't be that profitable just doesn't feel worth.
---
But we can obviously all agree at least that anyone going out specifically for clue hunters is definitely delusional if they think it's for the gp
---
I'm not actually trying to oppose what you're saying with every comment. I just said I see why they released it; many people felt their combat system was dated and they had a bunch of content already developed for the game? I didn't say it wasn't bugged or a functioning mess? I never played RS3.

This is the perfect representation of the shit show that is jagex support

YEET that kitty into the abyss

I'd be more impressed seeing someone with lvl 130 combat tbh.

"Ironman style" 1 hour video. 10 minutes in uses GE. You disgust me.
---
It’s all about how you train. If you do seaweed runs twelve times a day, you could be expected to get it before 99. If you do max XP training, your mileage will vary.
---
Yes. That’s targeted harassment and ragging. This boi deserves a ban, report and gather evidence, if you present evidence he will get got, espeically if you post it on reddit/twitter.

Except most of the skills that are lacking obvious endgame options had that stuff remedied BEFORE Runescape 3. And that stuff definitely isn't "dead content"; overloads + turmoil made it so things like Nex could be done, gano introduced a really good obtainable set to rival GWD gear for mages, etc. 
---
And as more and more players reach higher levels, where is any new content going to be targeted? Mid level? Eventually, you're going to have to release content for higher leveled players, and the only place for them to go is going to be in the 80-99 gap that most skills have. The biggest problem with Smithing in particular is that there is no "gap"; it's filled foolishly with Rune, which is at best a low-mid tiered set. In order for armor to eventually be varied, they're either going to have to introduce some of it through Smithing, or solely release new gear through slayer and PvM in general while Smithing continues to be absolutely useless, because Smithing is already useless in its entirety, not just "past a certain level".

Do seaweed, its honestly the best way to get it

why are noobs trying to change this game???

I sold my gear once to barely buy a tbow, doing raids with void and no d warhammer or anything was way harder than with the max gear without tbow
---
That is if you do raids in solos/duos, it's up to you but if you are like me and all you do is raid all day then you could get a few hundred mil in no time and buy anything you need

Getting 20 extra QP for 175 was harder than temple of ikov

And here I am failing fight caves at 85...

Invention was very good, just the augmentation things are way too strong. If they were tweaked or reworked it could be good in osrs
---
Knowing almost nothing about ToB, I’m assuming the interesting stat is the 1073 mage strength? Or is it something else?
---
How do you get Justiciar via slayer?
---
Wtf is your acc? Slayer alt? Gz on the hammer, I’m 3k kc in and no drop yet, I hope I don’t get to your kc before I get one 😬😬
---
I only need 9 :D and i hadnt done romeo and juliet or sheep sheerer. I finished mine this weekend. I know the pain. But my old account has it too. Gz bro!
---
Slay only uim lmao

This is an online video game, not a court of law.
---
SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED
---
Regardless of what you did in 2006, why ban you now? Hope you get it reversed.
---
Buy one at a range shop or do beginner clues
---
My account was perm banned now I have my account back,I hope this doesn’t happen to me. Upvoted for visibility
---
Nice cerberus plugin

---
That’s jagex for you, what else did you expect?
---
I used to make a pretty solid profit from smithing, is it no longer that good? I made an iron man account recently so I'm forced to do it anyway but I figured smithing would be a good money maker.
---
Which range shop? I went to the one closest in Rimmington and they don't have the base shortbow.
---
Big igloo time

I tried and you login in the shed!

Are you an Ironman ?

It is literally labeled as a permanent ban. The Jmod mistakenly put a value of only a few years, and after it was realized that a permanent ban was revoked the mistake was fixed and it went back to being permanent. It doesn't matter what the Jmod input for the number, because it doesn't change the fact that it was fully meant to be a permanent ban originally.
---
There’s a ranged shop in Varrok that sells bows. If you don’t have the money then you can get 50gp from killing goblins along the way.

That's... Honestly impressive and I respect the hustle, but how in the name of the Empty Lord is he doing that?
---
But then why do I only get half exp for fletching them to unstrung!!?
---
Varrock should have it
---
Couldn't you talk to the ranged tutor in Lumbridge?
---
I think if they were to add personalised weapons via smithing at high levels it'd bring some life back to it.
---
Every one said that to me, literally every guide was like "nothing less than60 agi" I said fuck it and did it with like 50 agi and it wasn't hard at all and I saved my self hours of mindless agility training
---
I’m not denying that I’m shady nor a doofus, I just want to know why I was banned and then unbanned and then banned again
---
They magically pop out as drops from mobs.
---
In osrs, everything can be obtained somehow by killing mobs
---
In rs2 skilling was profitable because if you really wanted ore, mining was actually the best way to obtain it, instead of killing zalcano
---
I absolutely agree that this isn't a court, etc etc. In addition, I agree that all accounts are Jagex's property, and of course it's within their rights to act as they wish. 
---
That doesn't change the fact that I dislike the idea of sentences not being literal.
---
Highly unlikely that's the case - Castle wars died not long after the current save is from, and I don't remember such bug existing at that time, and I played a LOT of cw at that time. If memory serves, gwd made cw go out of fashion, and it picked up a bit after free trade removal, but didn't last long as most players started leaving and it never recovered.
---
Welcome to Jagex support your call is very important to us. Please hold ... ♫Sea Shanty 2♫
---
You can be truthful, what was it that got your account banned in the first place? It was 13 years ago which is longer then alot of felony charges, even if it was for something as bad as botting you have had a bunch of time to grow up and reform. If it was no reason then sorry to ya but if it was for a good reason and your lying then we will prolly see a jmod smackdown. Always better to be truthful
---
what do you need enlightened journy for?
---
Fully agreed. The accounts are Jagex's property, and they can act as they wish.
---
As a consumer, it's my preference they behave as I mentioned above.
---
So on task will always favor like BIS Arma and shit?
---
To me it sounds like he leaked someone's personal details/attempted to dox someone in game? That would be my best guess
---
Dam that sucks upvoted
---
Bro ure almost halfway to a proper sentence
---
They could also add more use to rune bars. Similar to how steel bars are used to make cannon balls.
---
ooo havent been a good smack down in a while
---
Jokes on you, I failed no nut november at around 5:30pm on November 1st.
---
Now the jmod is going to wait years before addressing the issue, and say you owe him 1 economy please.

Suicide is badass!

Account build? I don’t know why LMS hasn’t been suggested as a viable option since it teaches you main bridding
---
Everyone intimately familiar with CW and the CW community already knows who this is. It's an absolute wonder of the game that Jagex hasn't taken this guy out yet.
---
on task the slayer helmet/black mask with imbue on its own provides around the same strength bonus as the void set as a whole. so yeah.
---
unless you are at vorkath or something- as  void range + salve stack, whereas slayer helmet+salve do not
---
Goodbye

Low man good

if the name is on a banned account it cant be taken
---
&gt;perm banned again
---
That doesn't even make sense, a perm ban is permanent.
---
😡 Well designed boss 😡

Dad (hard) 😔😰

You can make a new account for OSRS. The guy isn’t recommending making an RS3 account...

Didn’t learn your lesson the first time, huh? 
---
(Don’t risk wasting another 5+years)
---
I also had to start a second main for false ban(hcim too, both banned same time). It’s really sad that this is a thing that happens. Especially considering how much time and effort this game can eat up. I don’t play anymore because of the risk. And I want to play, I just have to be okay with the chance of randomly losing my account.
---
Try to contact a jmod on twitter. They might respond and be able to help

Wtf is twisted leauge?
