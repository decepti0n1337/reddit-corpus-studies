&gt;Except something like that would get shot down because it wouldn't fit OSRS.
---

---
Exact same thing could be said for 90% of the stuff that's passed polls. The vast majority of people got over the "muh oldschool!!" thing long ago when it started to actually kill the game.
---
&gt;I'd say adding some actual proper gear scaling to Magic and filling the mage armor crafting gap is a step to making the game better.
---
Re-read the whole paragraph. The proposed rewards can easily fit into other skills and content, we don't need the skill itself to fix those issues. The actual skill itself doesn't really improve the game in any way, it's just a crafting reskin that 90% of the playerbase won't touch after the initial hype dies down.
---
---
---
Jagex will never give the same attention to community-driven content as they will to developer-driven content. 
---
Sounds backwards but their logic is something like ‚Äúwhat do a bunch of potheads and weeaboos know about running a game company?‚Äù
---
Location based Artisan from the start would be a dream.
---
Kinda like forced BTW or UIM mode for a skill.
---
Would give life to so many unused areas of the game that never get touched.
---
Also it really didnt help how they were fairly quiet about the skill for some months, giving people the impression that it was polled before and is being forced again. I've seen a number of people who had that impression
---
Whats 2k hours when you‚Äôre not employed and live with your parents am i right üòé

Well I would point you to my first comment in this chain then. Further showing your poor reading comprehension.
---
Yeah it's def going to inflate the price day 1, and they only said it's be slightly better than travely
---
However I don't think it'll make the old chest dead content. Sote is a huge requirement and most people running keys are really low levels that don't have reqs for anything else.
---
uhhh i have no clue what silver does tbh never got one but i guess ill say the barrelchest anchor? No clue tbh i was gonna say dragon sword too but w/e. Why tho?

1876 hcim. Don‚Äôt ever PvP or care for it. I have an old normal account but only voted once. I simply didn‚Äôt want warding.
---
Guess that makes me a neckbeard?
---
I vote based off of question merit and my personal opinions. I‚Äôve voted yes to PvP polls even though I barely go in there do to not wanting to lose my status.
---
Instead of skipping it like pretty much everyone claims to, I just don't even vote on any poll.
---
I miss y'all too, when I can afford Xbox live, runescape and WH40K/AOS it will be quite the day
---
That happened
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think any new skill would bring me back.
---
The only argument i have towards why people train herb (besides quests/diaries) is for raids 1, 78 herb for standard ovl or 90 herb for ovl+, although it's all tradeable inside it and some bosses drop them so it's not even 100% needed, just useful
---
so u want a dead new minigame? lol YIKES pls dont vote anymore ty
---
How's it feel knowing your skill doesn't have enough community support to be added?

Rofl not like you're giving a proper example, ur contradicting urself, get a grip m8
---
it's fun to watch the neckbeards cry and clench their max capes like pearls
---
What a terrible reasoning. Us "losers" didn't cause your content not to pass. Poorly designed content did that. LMS and DMM is testament to good PvP updates passing.
---
What's wrong with that?

I'm hoping the theme makes its way in, in whatever form.  We need more magical mysticism.

---
Yea, this is never going to happen. What devs will be willing on aiding a whole other separate OSRS? We need to be a little logical here.
---
The game doesn‚Äôt need new content because 33% of players said no? What about the other 66%? Do they not matter at all?
---
In approximately 11 hours.

Elf camp teleports dropped like 2.5k in a few hours today.

I doubt it.

I think most votes have been decent, not on this though
---
Ok, thanks. That's pretty stupid
---
Sorry it's not canon
---
I liked the idea of warding. Having a basic material, secondary skill, was great. But looking at what it offered was way too much, in a way too basic form. It‚Äôs just crafting over again. But now, instead of 4 types of armour (referring to green, blue, red and black d‚Äôhide, that‚Äôs linear scalable) you can suddenly make 12 different robe outfits with different form of tank-gear, mixed and clean mage included. With rings, imbue, dissolving etc. 
---
It felt like a skill that wouldn‚Äôt improve the quality of the game, but smash out a lot of needless items to make us feel happy, even though it contributed nothing to the game. It wouldn‚Äôt make it more fun or interesting. But make it so instead of wearing ahrim‚Äôs we would wear something else. 
---
That‚Äôs not really a skill I‚Äôd like. At least not over something like Sailing. Or a new skill that implemented a whole new form of training instead of simply bankstanding.
---
Fucking lame
---
Alternatively, there are a lot of people who DONT want a new skill at all. Combine them with people who think sailing is a meme skill that would be better as a minigame and combine them with spite voters. Then the alts.
---
If that number is 26% of the playerbase, which I strongly believe it will be, then Sailing will never pass.
---
Plus the more details we get, the more things for people to not like.
---
Someone doesn't want what I want, ergo they must not care about the games integrity.
---
What‚Äôs the mathematical basis for it being 75% for you to qualify it as a ‚Äúunanimous everyone agrees‚Äù? Why not 95%, 70%, or 66.4%?
---
You really think reddit has that much power? 1/10th of the users playing the game are on the sub right now and I guarantee many of those here haven't played in months
---
Yes
---
but then those wouldn't be disguised as plot. hmm? oh yeah we lost this blue crystal. i think those ogromogres drops that, after you have received that go to jangoharro to speak to ungohurro. Maybe you can even help father who has sick kid who looks like she's naked. I am not making this last part up. Relara Whitemoon, child who's sick looks like shes naked from certain angle, mostly because Blizzard had artist that desided to give her shirt that is EXACTLY same color as her skin. brav freaking o. only hinted nudity (there is no nudity because as i said, shes wearing shirt that is same color as her skin you can see shirt buttons near the pants) https://i.imgur.com/26nnTRc.png

Gonna reset my Defence and head to NMZ. Nice.

Most slayer tasks are pretty fucking afkable with a cannon or aggressive monsters.
---
I think Jagex made a mistake by exclusively polling for new content. They should just add some fucking content once in awhile without explaining it in painful detail &amp; polling it first lol. New surprise content was the #1 thing I enjoyed about the game back in the day...
---
I would like to see a poll with just the question: 'would you like a new skill ever to be added to oldschool runescape', to see if they would want a new skill, or they didn't like any of the skills proposed
---
This is an underrated comment, and it‚Äôs pretty deep...outside of OSRS as well.
---
Warding was poorly designed content, hence the no votes? 
---
And yes, people vote no just to fuck with pkers, what do skillers/pvmers care about how to gmaul works? Or magic spells on the normal spellbook vs other players?
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted this heavily for asking a question. And these nerds wonder why people voted no to spite them for attacking dissenters.
---
Seems good with a bit of tweaking :)
---
If this skill can't pass, no skill will ever pass. It's not a radical change, fits oldschool style, fills a niche. Anything else would be even more contentious. I do not understand how sailing had a higher percentage though, that is crazy to me

Well we aren't shareholders, we're the pats community. The only rules to vote are 300 total and membership so if I invest the time and capital to meet that requirement multiple times I should get multiple votes. It's similar to if a shareholder owns a large enough portion of a company he should have more influence than someone who only owns a small portion. 
---
Reddit's also acting like only anti-warding players used alts to vote no. Plenty of pro-warding players used alts too.
---
Yeah, it is. I think it‚Äôs a reaction to how people use this game as an escape to feel like a kid again and even though I enjoy rs3 and osrs neither really feel like the game I played as a kid. There‚Äôs too much new stuff and too much theory. 
---
That said I like most of the new stuff when it feels like the logical direction for osrs. 
---
My reasons for not liking warding were thematic as in RS magic is kind of arcane and beyond humans in a sense according to the experienced world (idk anything about the lore.)
---
I would seriously love to know how many people made hundreds of accounts to vote yes
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again. Urine is not sterile. Whoever still honestly tells this does not know what "sterile" means. It's also not healthy to consume (also a myth often told) - it's not necessarily harmful, mind you, but that does not mean "sterile".
---
Also, as much as I enjoy sinkpissing, the mental gymnastics sinkpissers on the subreddit go through to "justify" something that's just fun is baffling. You don't "save water" in any meaningful way (and actually hurt your sewage system by reducing the flushing that goes through it) especially since most keep the water running. Unless you are a germophobe all the "microdroplets" of toilet water spraying "everywhere" are complete humbug (and is also true for .your sink by the way). And the "romantic" postings of people remembering a particular sink or their "first time" are just trolling or satire.
---
Wouldnt the dissolving have fixed a big portion of that loss though?
---
The comp cape was pretty near best in slot, nobody with one didn't wear it
---
I'm suggesting that we as individuals or as a community should strive to be better than the people we understand are being shitty. Sorry if that was for some reason difficult to understand.
---
The stranger has just recently stopped following someone who‚Äôs in the middle of the Desert Treasure. I‚Äôm pretty sure if that player logs out or teleports, the stranger will then start following anyone in that area, which happens to be you.
---
That locking a BIS behind thousands of hours of content is poor game design?
---
Well first off we've already established that the variants of the max cape are a cosmetic override for the particular best in slot items so therefore it is not a best in slot item itself. And second we've established that the base variant is not best in slot for anything and has the stats of any other skillcape. So no part of the max cape is best in slot. So your argument is dead on arrival.
---
I've been playing rs3 ironman mode and I'm loving it
---
And less overall votes, almost half
---
It's truely hard to explain for newly joined players. People blame it all on alt polling, but it's really not as big of a factor as people make it seem. The veterans who have been playing for 10 years have seen how every type of addition effect the game. Until the veterans retire and the new generation who didn't experience the downfalls take over, new skills will almost garaunteed fail.
---
To prove alt polling isn't as big of a deal, go to the veteran community forums old generation clanning forums, etc who privately poll the same ingame polls. Keep in mind these communities don't alt poll like you would ingame and they still fail. We've seen how new skills especially such a skill that brings in new set robe effects and the likes effect the game. It's a dungeoneering 2.0 in the aspect of new content. The skill may be completely different but the balance of the rewards are similar.
---
This pool was flawed from the beginning. So many stupid people used alts to vote no because 'my max cape'. God, this community sucks so much sometimes.
---
Tell me about it ha
---
It would bottleneck supplies more than it already is. 
---
Warding at least had new stuff required to obtain to make things,
---
Artisan would have a 99 within the day of release.
---
Whiny? They won. Have you seen the losers in the sub here? It's 2016 all over again
---
Good

what?

I don't care if im missed lmao I'm just happy I'm gonna have free time now

My negative mood about Warding failing already passed. I no longer give a damn about that skill.

No I just thought it was funny that reddit calls no voters the vocal minority but they weren't that much of a minority. Blacks are minorities and they make up 13% of the population so yeah get reported for racism.

I wish I didn't have to hop to collect battle staves.
---
I would‚Äôve voted yes. I always forget to vote.
---
yea i know about the release function cos i caught them for a bit but it just dodnt register
---
That'd give the miniquest a req of 95 Slayer tho, no way they'd suddenly jump 20 levels from the current highest quest req for a boss rush grind
---
It‚Äôs extremely important to understand that while the poll failed, the majority of people wanted this skill in the game. Everyone is entitled to their opinions on Warding, and all points for and against were valid!
---
We should take the time to be more civil in discussing this game that we all enjoy and spend way too much time on. It all comes down to respect. Let‚Äôs respect each other more going forward.

I love this community and it deserves to thrive.

bro no u r drunk bro this is the very sub bro u r 1384838

Apparently it is because slayer is all we ever fucking get. Jesus even the farming guilds most valuable part is a fucking boss since they've nerfed seed packs

It's a end-game quest. It should have decent requirements.

Come on Jagex, you miss 50% of all shots you don't take.

Hey it was a 50/50 it either passed or it didn't
---
I'm at stage 4 and I didnt get the result I wanted
---
... would be a better skill than warding/sailing !
---
Spend more money!
---
The direction they were pushing the skill is that of filling a niche of items that aren‚Äôt generally available through means metal/hide armours are, they weren‚Äôt designing a skill to be balanced around if its fun to do or you.
---
I enjoyed the dozens of posts that were just a screenshot of yours, I'd say this was well worth it.
---
Smithing smiths up to rune armor (level 40) but also is needed to assemble the dragonfire shield and is used when calculating barrows repair costs. 
---
Crafting makes ranged armor up to level 70 range with black dragonhide. 
---
But for robes/magic armor? Well, that's just left to drop tables and shops for some reason... 
---
Nobody is saying "magic is not used because it's missing robes" you're just inventing an argument to put words in my mouth. I'm saying it's a missing production skill that, by every measure, *should* be in the game. Creating regular clothes too, but I assumed that would be an added benefit of injecting fabrics into the game through warding.
---
Either way I don‚Äôt know their methods, I highly doubt their bot algorithm by now can‚Äôt differentiate which account is yours and which one is your college roommates.
---
And we all know thats a fucking lie. There would be diaries and quests. Good thing it failed üòÑ

if you make more on the ge in a day than I ever have, then you'll know why it was necessary lmao

nobody cares mate

Yup but I doubt anyone would have gone to the effort. Can't go back and change it now.

Please don't tell me you're going to harvest all that snape grass with like 5 inventory slots free.

Thank you sir for understanding

I play osrs. How did you not get it? Should I have put more emojis for you to understand
---
There's nothing forcing you to use any of the new content. Everything that existed before 2007 still exists and you can choose not to play any post 2007 stuff. I'm sure most people like constant updates so I don't see them stopping any time soon.
---
The controls are bad by design, there is indeed a difficulty to learning them. I‚Äôm saying that this part of Pking should not be difficult for the sake thereof, this is what I mean by arbitrary difficulty.

By making the controls easier experienced pkers are still going to beat inexperienced players.

that's wassup

Bruh the art style literally looks like something from the N64 era, it's objectively shitty. She and the other Prifddinas artists actually made a good art direction for Prifddinas while fitting the simplistic style of OSRS
---
No one with a brain stood around V-west to sell an entire tab. Scammers still exist and now in even bigger numbers, trading wasn't that much of a scam because you have two trade screens. If you think using third party sites is bad 95% of the osrs uses 3rd party client with your argument you would be against them too.
---
Not to mention how most of these guys have enough gp to buy a bunch of bonds just to vote with new accounts while the poll was out
---
Mrah
---
how do you simultaneously believe that these people have no life and play this game all day while also thinking that 30 hours and a few hundred mil would be enough of an obstacle for them to not want this skill
---
Wilderness slayer! It's the best money from slayer until 75+.
---
IT TOOK FORFUCKINGEVER
---
Ahrims is T70 gear, mystic is T40, Ancestral is T65, one costs maybe 150-300k, one costs 4-4.5m, one costs 130m. Three useful armors, wildly varying prices, large skill req gaps, not very good variety.

How the fuck do you translate yes votes into "game is gonna go stale withput warding"? Lmao get some fucking common sense.

What you're doing here is creating a false dilemma, getting a new skill is not the only way for the game to grow in player-base.
---
this is part of the reason why nobody will take RS seriously.
---
I remember finding a dead/at risk MMO list, both runescapes are on it lmao.

the community will kill both games if it means getting what they want.

I was like "oh nice reddit neckbeards downvoting someone and repeating the same arguments" and then I saw you wanted another gay pride event and then realized you are loony

I don't understand. Why don't people want warding?
---
This takes me back
---
Also platelegs. Add skulls to both kneecaps
---
You keep telling me to check my reading comprehension for some reason but you can't understand that youre wrong, and being a dick about it too. In any case it doesn't matter. The fact of the matter is that the max cape is as it is. If you want the benefits you have to work for them. Everyone else understands that. I thought maybe I could alleviate your concerns and help you understand that it's not a problem item but a cool reward for people who put in the effort, but you're impossible to reason with. Go ahead and keep hating on the max cape all you want. I'll be wearing mine in a few months and I can't wait to use all those benefits you're crying about not being able to use yourself.
---
Cooking/fletching aren't supposed to reward you with money and won't if you are getting good xp rates.  Alching has always been profitable in osrs minus the first 4-6 months.
---
Why should we care about runescape esports being a thing
---
Look I‚Äôm not asking for a perfect system, but I‚Äôm sure they can at least look at the people who farm accounts just to vote. That‚Äôs not going to take lots of money for them to do do....

Get farming, homie
---
In case this isn't bait, you claim the staves from the barrel in 1 go, not from his shop
---
You‚Äôll be fine with those stats. Just check out a quick YouTube video on each general and go in with general knowledge of their attack mechanics.
---
I'd rather poll a Sailing V2, like dg but above ground and can be trained in multiple areas.
---
Because recently (over the past few years) the OSRS team has started to create content they THINK we want, instead of directly asking for suggestions for content like they did in the early days of OSRS. A lot of the early OSRS content were designed by players, agility rooftops are a great example of this.
---
Are you on something
---
Perfectly understandable. I think warding has some good ideas that could still be integrated into other skills, but as a new addition entirely I wasn‚Äôt entirely sold
---
this depresses me because it reminds me of the time I decided my katowice capsules on CS:GO weren't worth holding onto, and I opened all (hundred+) and only kept one. They went from 25 cents each to over $400 each now.
---
Do you think they will stop polling for new skills? Or is it more likely that they will poll this every few years to see how the playerbase's mind changes?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I was actually looking forward to some more viable mage armors.
---
12 billion lost? I'd be depressed too. That's like $12k isn't it?
---
..what?
---
I can see you're new to osrs, i've played since day one.  Fan sites used to trade were perfectly fine, had a sidebar and a search function.  No scrolling through trades just adding the person and trading. If that's not easy I don't understand your definition.
---
I leaned towards 'no' so voted that way too. 
---
Disclaimer; I didn't vote on my alts as they aren't members at the moment and I wouldn't anyway. I read the blogs and documents and considered both for and against reasons. 
---
One thing that I noticed, a LOT of people messaged me or commented to say that THEY had voted on their alts or that I'd convinced them to vote yes to spite me somehow.
---
invention is no where near the same as warding... you also have a 0% chance of getting any mats back for skilling when you dissemble... you get comps, but if I dissemble a rune plate, no chance at getting rune bars back.
---
Turns out being fun *is* something people care about. I saw so much discussion about how it didn't matter that warding looked completely unenjoyable to train, but even with all this development and hype it doesn't beat a skill whose appeal was almost entirely that it looked fun to train. That's for them to think about for next time.

Just stop feeding
---
I know warding failed, but I still want to buy a warding sweater or t-shirt or something to remember it by.
---
I'm not too concerned over warding failing as it was too be expected but I also disagree with 75% on principle, 2/3 is better imo for nearly any sort of vote that needs a yes or no decision.
---
[I'm dating myself with that w00t](https://i.imgur.com/lgqe9Sb.png)
---
because it's satire?
---
i'm still surprised that you need a whole 75% of people to vote yes to get something to pass.  i don't think it's crazy to just ask for a super majority. if it's good enough for USA to pass something without getting the president's approval i don't see why it wouldn't be good enough for a game company to put in content and make changes that a clear majority want to see.
---
&gt; New items != new skill; 
---
this is a completely useless statement in more ways than one
---
Yup. Though Mod West did say they probably should have done more surveying before announcing a new skill for RuneFest. I believe the last survey was like 2017 or something so not too recent. Either way, expect more surveys in the coming months since that seems to be what they will be doing.
---
Anyone got a link for the story so far winner video?
---
Those of you who voted no are arseholes.
---
I wanted warding tbh. But the big thing this game is missing is something that promotes team work. There should be a skill where you could do it alone but somehow is better exp to do in groups
---
Why are you in this sub, then? I've given up hope of a skill with the polling system, but that doesn't mean new content isn't coming to the game.
---
No it's just circle jerk drivel to help you subhuman scum feel better
---
I'm pretty satisfied with the result, but I'm moreso trying to make a point about how the community should interact with itself if it actually wants content to pass.
---
Nothing at all indicated sarcasm. More emojis wouldn't have helped. You could try learning to communicate more effectively?
---
Exploeering
---
What was his rant about?
---
If consider the majority more important.
---
I voted no because I didn't think it was a good addition to the game, if you're talking about me.
---
If you're talking in general then yeah, I'm not saying reactionary voters are the smartest or most logical people. My point is that they definitely exist, in osrs polls and in real life, and its important to acknowledge that they exist if you actually want people to vote the way you want.
---
Majority + half. 
---
Majority is 50% +1
---
Leaving virtually 50% on the no side. I guess while anything over 10% more than the minority is a significant gap, it‚Äôs still more practical and safe to have the half of the remainder need to win majority as well.
---
Yesss
---
Lol salty warding kid so mad. I voted no on 30 accounts.
---
It's a shame they couldn't get the skill up to the bar set by previous well received content.
---
They have no choice but to continually attempt to add a skill that will never pass.
---
I have OSB so it lights up green with the number of essence in the pouch.
---
I'm not "crying" at all. There's a lot more going on in my life than this game. 
---
I'm just disappointed that OSRS won't ever get any new skills like the original 2007 Runescape did.
---
Yew bows are better cash. But takes longer.
---
Fuck this was close. I'll bet it'll pass next time for sure.
---
is this a serious question

Anti warding voted no = against black people conclusion and warding is racist.
---
Even then when you reset your router you‚Äôre assigned a new IP / or you can just call your ISP and ask for a new IP
---
Imagine thinking dungeoneering was underrated lmfao
---
They payed for membership longer and have more invested in the long term health of the game than someone with 1000 total level. Not that I agree with this line of thought but there are merits to it
---
That's not the crux, player interaction is.  Now if you don't ever want to interact with another player you don't have to.  Most people didin't scam when trading, you either stood in varrock far too long which is a mistake since trading was literally easy af before ge or you didn't trade. The GE is not "better dude", allowing people to sit there and do no work to merch is boring, to sit there and +/-5% until something buys is uninteresting, the GE as a whole is uninteresting if it was more like WoW's auction house it would be neat but auto filling trades isn't.
---
I mean clearly the community doesnt want warding lol
---
Vorki is pretty lit but I feel you that dragonbone is basically worthless. Mini zilyana is probably what I'm aiming for if I go dry enough on hydra that I can get my brow. About 300m to go
---
Could be the crystal tree patch they mentioned
---
Do you?
---
Then why ask you sus ass motherfucker
---
I literally have no need for gold and haven't for over 2.5 years, merching on the GE is literally braindead and anyone can do it.
---
Hillary won. Drumpf is not my president. Get over it, sweetie.
---
They are, and they do. This is no secret
---
Include item sink and i vote yes
---
That isnt runescape
---
"MAJOR CONTENT" aka a 40 hour bankstanding buyable that no one will touch unless they have to.
---
k
---
A huge portion of maxed players were against warding.
---
What? How is "toxic" to enjoy paying the game for the content? Why else are you playing the game then bro? Can't get a real sense of accomplishment in the real world so maxing in osrs is the only way the to achieve meaning in ur life
---
You listed two changes that are the definition of an integrity update. Gmaul is completely broken as has caused massive stagnation regarding weapon choice in pvp.
---
Rushing max then complaining there‚Äôs nothing to do. while thinking others that can‚Äôt sink 10 hours a day are not integral to the game. Warding was not a good new skill, deal with it.
---
So I‚Äôve played since this game came out. Having an active sub ever since( I‚Äôm talking 15+ years) and I‚Äôm not maxed. 
---
Vs someone who is time free and has many an hour into the game and maxed in 6 months. 
---
Your total level doesn‚Äôt show time invested.
---
Do you know what subreddit we are in?
---
Nah dude, it‚Äôs a game called alora, it‚Äôs a mmorpg! Tho, If you like RuneScape, you may also be a fan of alora, the all new old school mmorpg!
---
Yup I am up to 13 lamps now
---
There are about 7000 maxed osrs accounts. Where‚Äôd the other 35k votes come from?
---
Okay? If anything max players hinder the growth of the game (seen with warding). They don‚Äôt want to lose their capes so they vote no on new skills and yes to high tier pvm content. The game will die if this continues.
---
Yes voters still in denial
---
Usually it's about 11AM BST, so 9 hours from now. That would be 3AM EST I guess.
---
I blame rigondeuax the little bitch
---
Bye nerd.
---
How do you have the old bridge texture?
---
Just did that task with similar stats, was way easier than expected.  Wasn't on task, just walked in and focused completely on the boss and ignored minions.  You have a whole inv of food to do just 255 damage to one boss, and you can bail out once the boss is dead.
---
Good. Fuck warding.
---
Tbh im fine with the system as is id prefer no change. I dont disagree with you
---
&gt;Crafting, however, I'd disagree on. It's a long grind, but there's a huge variety of unique ways to train that.
---
Yeah idk what game you're talking about bud.
---
Agree. I liked Sailing and Artisan.
---
I wanted it to pass too. The thing that gets me is I‚Äôve seen multiple people say they were voting no to warding because they don‚Äôt want RS to change. Then those same people go and say they would vote test to a sailing skill. Seriously? Big brain shit right there
---
Cuz I'm sad D:
---
Can you release the results? /u/Umdlye
---
It‚Äôs been pretty clear both on here and twitter that there is immense interest in a new skill, and that a sizable chunk of people who voted no to Warding would vote for another skill, I don‚Äôt see why Jagex wouldn‚Äôt revisit other skills.  Whatever incentives they had to take this crack at it (i.e. people broadly still want a new skill) still remain in place for them to take another crack at it.  I‚Äôd be *very* surprised if we never see another skill poll in the history of OSRS.
---
All u did was slap trap drums over the original song. I'd hardly call it a remix.
---
Fuck these kids acting like because we need an item sink we should let warding pass? Or because if we don't let warding pass they won't bother making a new skill?
---
This is coming from someone who voted YES for sailing
---
From people that don't want the skill, obviously. I was replying to his "the high level community is bored" comment.
---
I haven't played this game in years, I'm just here for the memes.
---
Looked it up, it‚Äôs a private server thing with the osrs build
---
Lol they'll come back next week
---
I voted **No** twice....  
---
incoming down votes.
---
Afk nmz for a fortnight or a month. Maxed 99 melees at minimal cost and you have a ton of points you can throw at multiple imbues or just daily herb boxes afterwards. 
---
An obby set and zerker neck won't set you back more than 6-7m. Maxed melees are actually useful unlike 99 cooking or fletching.
---
I think there's a bit of cognitive dissonance between what the community as a whole is, how the community is portrayed by this sub, and the sub itself. I do not believe the community at large to be toxic, but this sub is a different matter.
---
Ghostspeak amulet
---
Haven‚Äôt seen that many people in one place outside the ge in a long time, definitely isn‚Äôt runescape.
---
Oh right, I'm dumb. Thank you lmao
---
it's FAR less efficient, but I don't know if you saw that this is an ironman.
---
Herblore req for ironmen is nasty
---
Still not a skill though.
---
The wiki says it untrims and is unusable.  Can't confirm since I just got my diary cape yesterday.
---
Then you're not spite voting you're just doing random crap
---
Do you have statistics to back up your implied claim that maxed players  Overwhelmingly voted no to preserve their Max Cape? Also how would warding prevent the death of the game if it is just another boring grind. The content based around it can be brought in other ways.
---
Same goes for Kalphite Soldiers in the slayer dungeon and Suqahs with mage pray
---
The polls were set to 75% for a reason. It's easy to get excited for new content even if it is harmful for the game in the long term. It'll only take a few shitty updates to kill this game, like they did before.
---
the example given 
---
&gt; Shit like calling no voters "sweaty neckbeards" or calling yes voters "salty fuckheads" does literally nothing but make every one of us look bad. 
---
what's the contradiction?
---
It's the only one I need, because it's a valid argument. Why should vote Yes on something that I don't want?
---
I personally think that having a 75% pass rate  is a bit steep. I think a 60-65% pass rate would be more reasonable when it comes to implementing things into the game. 
---
I also think that the really wealthy players/maxed players would be more unlikely to vote no on things that would cause drastic changes to OSRS. 
---
For example, someone with a set of ancestral would be less likely to vote yes on something that would lower the value of it. 
---
Or max players wouldn‚Äôt want to train a new skill to get the max cape back
---
"Osrs content has become stale and boring. We need something new soon or the game might die."
---
*votes no to warding*
---
ugh, another bankstanding skill? just roll it into herblore and farming. 
---
pestle and mortar + grown avocado - level 99 requirement in both skills
---
What it polled at might at best represent whether or not voters think it fits, not whether or not it actually does. I doubt most no voters had that as their chief complaint so the poll percentage doesn't really mean shit against his point.
---
Im for warding but this is really damn interesting. If only I knew it was an experiment
---
welp, we tried i suppose
---
Old age correlates with refusal to change. That‚Äôs all. I much rather play with older players than younger players that‚Äôs for damn sure!
---
This would work in theory, if no voters  didnt vote no just because the didnt want another skill or didnt read the blog, make content suggestions, etc...
---
I've seen plenty of people in game who voted no,  who literally had no idea what warding was at the time of the vote, and thought it was a combat update
---
What percentage of Reddit users on this sub make up the player count?
---
G
---
Saw her post earlier lol. Gz :)
---
Not against a new skill but this is just another buyable and I'm against that. I feel like the only push for it would be to shake up the highscores so people can try to dump their money the fastest to get 200m. Just add it to another skill and I feel it would do a lot better. I prefered sailing to this fucking pirate ship pvp fights
---
Go shoot more and get the pet. Unless you can't. I'm too lazy to look up if pures can
---
No, I didn't vote
---
How funny. This comment got -11 votes. In another thread a comment with basically the same main idea got +60 votes. Dunno why... what people see in it is probably not what I meant at all...
---
Oh god you're a brainlet
---
I read the entire design document, there was nothing proposed in there that would be mechanically suitable for tick manipulation.  I'm not going to vote yes on a hope they add it when they listen to this sub and the redditard casuals in here are opposed to methods that don't let them focus on Netflix
---
&gt;I‚Äôd definitely like to see more of that sort of thing added.
---
They did this recently with the most recent(?) Slayer expansion. Hydra and the Karuulm dungeon. Sure, there is a diary perk to remove that gear requirement, but it's an elite diary which most players won't have.
---
Doesn't mean we need more of the same.
---
Honestly I wonder if anything here can be usable for the future. Can you imagine how problematic it could become if the votes were swayed by even 1-2% because of these ads? Or worse, if someone got the idea to spam reddit with ads to either promote their opinion or break down the opposition by spamming things for them?
---
In either case, thank you for shit posting but screw you for making me think. This is Reddit, not some scholarly site damnit.
---
Very true, but it's 2019 and hardware is good enough in even the pre-built PCs that it shouldn't be an issue anymore. Many people will play the game properly for the first time, myself included because our gateway pc in 2004 was awful and ran it at a silky smooth 10-15 fps.
---
All questions were dependant on question 1 passing, so they could be repolled with wording specifically for the individual content
---
Perhaps you don't know how fucked the US elections are?
---
&gt;Switzerland will remember that.
---
Exactly why I stopped playing, in a nutshell.
---
Well, someone stole it from me then (which is ok because my memes are free) because slapped this together and immediately tossed it on reddit.
---
What? 1 in 3 as a percentage is 33%, or 66% opposed?
---
They usually update it around 11 gmt
---
I can't, can't do any Western Provinces diaries past 2, and I need all 4 done, as much as I want the pet :(
---
That was a different wife, actually! Apparently popular thing to do the day before quest capes get ripped in half.
---
Countdown begins at 5 am, update goes live at 5:30 am
---
I'm actually like low-key jealous.
---
I'm in Oklahoma and we also had Webelo's Woods so that's kind of neat. We recited everything each meeting but I just mumbled my way through it. Usually went "A Scout is Trustworthy...... Clean, and Reverent". Had everything else down, but those 12 points always got me
---
Would love if there was some way to get stats on if it actually effected anything, and break down the $/vote. Obviously not possible though
---
Probably late 04 or around 05.
---
Damn neckbeards
---
Yeah he doesn't but our other neighbor does, I've heard them argue over it multiple times
---
What are you so mad about? I was just stating fact, I don‚Äôt know how fucking old you are and I don‚Äôt care.
---
I specifically said the skills
---
More fun to believe in conspiracies
---
You saying they have no way to solve some bot problems ?  Cuz they definitely  have measures they can take to help solve issues
---
Not really a fan of plagarism or stealing OC but thats not usually a topic that comes up at parties
---
Seriously, it was a question because I was curious since I'm out of the loop. I didn't realize so many people were just butthurt.
---
Ok thanks (:
---
No not you lol I replied to wrong comment the other guy
---
&gt;That said I do think alt voting needs to be stopped
---
There's no way to stop that.
---
why are you so mad lmao
---
Add a PvP element to the open waters
---
We'll see if any pass in that case, but I wouldn't hold my breath on the mods being allowed to improve the game.
---
Right now? 
---
Everything will be expensive, you started too late boi
---
People hopping on reddit to shitfling for a day or two before they all move on isn't toxic, and honestly that word is beat to death at this point by people wanting to apply it to shit it doesn't apply to.
---
well the first sentence is wrong... no one asked for warding
---
Uhh... New items yes.
---
Warding no
---
Xoxo
---
I dont think it being unfun is a good argument because you can argue most skills in RS are "unfun" lol
---
I, like many players, are not ready for a whole new skill.
---
Back then runescape was also a cheaper subscription, starting at 5 bucks then going up to 7.50 i think? Afaik, WoW has stayed 15 dollars. I tried WoW but personally couldnt get into it. Its a shame that runescape is 11 dollars now when most people pay that just to play osrs when theyre basically playing for two games. I find it hard to justify the price of runescape membership nowadays...
---
Can I have your stuff
---
Meta
---
Only if the game gets brickies laptops
---
Meanwhile the girl scouts have almost always accepted boys and nothing bad ever happened from it. People are so paranoid over nothing lol
---
Thoughts on dungeoneering or any skill from rs2/RS3 game?
---
&gt;At level 75, you have all the Slayer gear unlocked, and that's only 10% of the way to 99.
---
Sure, if you use the g/e to buy Slayer drops.
---
At level 1 Herblore you have all potion usage unlocked and that's 0% of the way to 99.
---
If you play Ironman it'll be 95 Slayer for Hydra drops in order to access all gear.
---
Didn't that poll also need 75% to pass? In which case the same flaw would cause it to fail.
---
&gt;To unlock what we already have plenty of mage armours in the game that got established a long time after 2002/2003 if they was gonna add a skill related to it should of been added then because they covered the need for it already.
---
So smithing shouldn't be a thing because we can buy rune chainbodies after completing Dragon Slayer and unlocking the shop? What..? On the contrary, giving more choice is generally a positive.
---
&gt;Who is trying to preserve 2002/2003 that would of been RSC which if I recall is dead so no people are trying to retain a later date than that and it just wouldn‚Äôt fit in that time line.
---
I'm not talking about 02'/'03 specifically, I'm appealing to what the core game is based on. Which is exactly what osrs is based on and the reason it even exists.
---
&gt;You seen very immature whatever your age is I‚Äôm not against A new skill I just think it needs to be better. You‚Äôre the one generalising all no voters as the same friend
---
I don't care to engage in ad homs so here is my take on the criticism. None of the no voters gave a valid and sound argument to support their conclusion of voting no. I am telling you they don't have a thought process based on logic and reason.
---
This so cute, i wish my girlfriend played with me lmao
---
All the pvm nerds are gonna panic even harder when we pull up in the rev caves
---
You lost fair and square suck it the fuck up
---
Wasn't being buyable a major criticism of Warding?
---
Give me a skill based around something like the Kingdom management. Call it Royalty or something, idk. You actually own and run a kingdom and go around it and do shit to generate better passive benefits determined by the skill.
---
He b,
---
I think I can help solve this one. I even added extended commentary in brackets so that Chad and Brad can get the gist of what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
Read with half-witted sarcasm.
---
People who live with their parents typically aren‚Äôt equipped with the capabilities to handle undesirable outcomes. They tend to fear change (and women) and fuel their brain and what‚Äôs left of their body with fruity pebbles (not hating) or any other sugar laced substance. This is a RFD (recipe for disaster). When confronted with an undesirable situation (crusts left on sandwich or equivalent) what comes next is what we refer to as ‚Äútemper tantrums‚Äù. You can see plenty of examples of these tantrums all over anything related to OSRS, from Reddit to YouTube. This is normal. These people are clinging desperately to OSRS because they have nothing else to grasp onto since their sister moved out years ago (to be fair, she was hot) and their mothers gave away their stuffed animals to the cousins new baby. 
---
Fortunately, the devs are people who have decided to go somewhere in life and have achieved some level of success. They make their own money and have their very own ‚Äújob‚Äù (voluntary paid employment). They have jumped the necessary hurdles in life and are generally much better at handling undesirable outcomes. This allows them to competently handle the tantrums displayed by the aforementioned group of what are AKA ‚Äúneck beard incels‚Äù. 
---
So don‚Äôt worry about our friends at Jagex. They have had to endure much worse and they have still come out top notch people doing good work. That‚Äôs what being a responsible adult is all about!
---
Is this he?
---
Almost all of the twitter nerds going for 200m all have been asking for this. Youd have most of their votes if thats what youre referring to
---
Same
---
Just go with costly and fast then make your money back PvM'ing. It's a better use of your time overall
---
I'm not gonna lie, I try to continually remind myself to remember how lucky I am with her. We go PVMing for date nights... Totally worth the 15k for the gf.
---
Not at all, you can already dissolve items with alchemy, the reason why you lose money smithing stuff like adamant platebodies is because you're paying for the experience points. Adamant dart tips are profit, but they are slower than platebodies so you're 'paying' by spending extra time training smithing.
---
But a skill will never pass in order for it to get to that point. And They can't really afford to spend the kinda dev time needed to offer us something like that, that will almost certainly fail.
---
Iirc it used to be the UIM smithing meta and then they nerfed it
---
nah bro i want my zulrah v 10 and vorki v20 first
---
Fuck
---
Don't forget, Dissolving was going to help our economy alot but now... who knows.
---
Come on sailing!
---
Whats fun about buying crafting materials off the ge for 13 mil xp worth. Warding was going to be exactly as much fun as fletching, and i dont like fletching.
---
I think its bad. 
---
Its an opinion, its not wrong. I dont want what the rs3 community wanted. Thats the whole point of voting mate, people slam their opinion into the poll and then everyone should accept the results like mature adults.

---
Two of these posts are literally titled propaganda lol
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there were people paying others to vote yes, but no one on this sub would make and upvote a post about it because most of the sub was circlejerking about how they wanted warding to pass. It's like visiting a news site with X political affiliation; when bad news about X comes out, they wont report it or will downplay it.
---
keep that mindset whenever you tell a joke to someone
---
If you just want a 99 fletching and cooking are both quick easy and moderately profitable. That being said my favorite 99 to get was wc because redwoods are so relaxing. Coolest 99 capes are Hunter, Slayer and crafting but that's just my opinion. I'd say do cooking to experience what getting a 99 is like and go from there
---
BAHAHAHAHHAHAAH
---
75% definitely shows up as an extremely rough number to get to when all things are considered like when it's an update like warding that have a bunch of people completely against the very principle of it (being a new skill) which even if the skill would fit the game very well, bringing new things to do without disrupting the economy/balance of the game, it'll have such a large volume of people who'll almost blindly vote no (not saying warding specifically would or wouldn't be the ideal skill that wouldn't break things since we dont know 100% how it'd work, just mean as an example of best case scenario).
---
on the other hand, i think in a bunch of cases it's better to run with a vote to pass that's over the 51/49 threshold needed usually for majority, to try and avoid things that are too controversial passing, with the idea that it's better to stick with what you know works than it is to implement something that barely broke the 51/49 threshold, and either breaks a heap of the game or makes a lot of people despise the new addition like a higher tier of gear than makes all prior work void. of course people will be upset that something that got say a 52% yes didn't pass (given most did vote for it) but it's to much lesser of an extent than the other way around, potentially at least.
---
a problem arises where, at what point though do you put the vote % needed? 75% has shown to be fine for most updates and whatnot, but for some it's not fine like for warding, but maybe 66.6% is better to run with? or maybe 60%? it seems a bit hard to put a value to the vote pass (and are all a bit arbitrary)
---
 that makes the most sense when you look at it being a bit harder than just looking at a majority vote. 
---
also the problem arises again (this is a bit of a tangent) with people owning multiple accounts. in this regard accounts become a sort of share of the company in the sense the more member accounts you have, the bigger the vote you have, but just because someone has 3 accounts doesnt mean there opinion should be worth more than someone with just 1 main account (unless they compare to simply how much money theyre making off of people which doesnt seem completely fair). but then how would they manage that so people with alts didnt just have more power, like is there a min threshold of stats you need/exp? vote power based on hours logged in? none really work, not to mention would be abuse able regardless... so many problems with the system, and while it's been relatively fine normally, after such a large and controversial vote, it's all come to the light.
---
I‚Äôve been laying bricks playing RuneScape since mobile came out.
---
Imagine being able to tick manipulate them as well so they are almost infinite and don't need recharging
---
that's great. have fun with your break and here's hoping you don't go  begging for group finder in classic wow.
---
bit like how agility courses use to be before Roof tops....
---
Still argue roof tops were a terrible addition since they didn't add content they removed content, and arbitrarily added better training methods with rewards that you would be crazy not to do.
---
Amongst all the whining about pass or fail, this is a brilliant and harmless idea. Love it. Hope they do it.
---
Jamflex should just add a limited time world showcasing the skill
---
nah you are exactly 1 month early bud
---
I was going to say I love doing it cus it's actually not bad xp
---
Boring, go post in the warding threads instead of making yet another warding opinion post.
---
I guess warding still wouldn't have passed with 2/3rds anyway but 75% is still a huge hurdle for any of interesting changes to happen. Guess we gotta wait for Slayer 2, but honestly Jagex should just revamp all the current skills first.
---
needs 75%
---
I didn‚Äôt vote but I‚Äôm just curious. Why not?
---
what has this game done to you.
---
There's also significantly more people playing today. What are you trying to say?
---
nobody really plays runescape anymore.
---
its only playerbase is old players who are so tired of grinding.
---
all the new players that grind don't put that much effort in either since they dont like it either.
---
Damn
---
Litterally everyone knew EoC and the Previous wilderness, and trade changes were bad idea's.  If they were polled, they would have had a poll rate of like 30% yes votes, probably even lower.
---
So why do people act like 75% is a reasonable standard to gate content.
---
It's actually fucking hilarious to think that the minority of the community can equate warding to previous dev fuck ups.
---
You‚Äôre exactly right. 
---
This is the inherit issue of being a player driven development game. Anything you do will piss off at least some faction of the players
---
They should make 07'scape separate from OSRS. That way the "07'scape or bust" people who voted no can go play the game exactly as it was in 2007, while the rest of us can enjoy a constantly evolving OSRS that just avoids the EOC, microtransactions, exp boosters, and graphic overhauls that became RS3. I feel like that could push out at LEAST half of those no-votes so we could finally get a 75% yes-vote on a new skill.
---
And hey maybe it would even get rid of a good group of Real World Traders and botters as well since a good portion of those players are the ones who take this game too seriously and dont let the rest of us enjoy a fun time wasting break from life.
---
someone is salty warding didnt pass.
---
don't care recout anyway for memes.
---
It's probably like Chambers of Xeric where they have no actual requirements but there's challenges in there that make it so that you need certain stats to do it. Ask again in a few days or a week when the meta for the gauntlet starts to form.
---
Haha wholesome 100 my good sir, cause that's what heroes do
---
Venting to people who want polls removed but then argue about things the polls have saved? Logic
---
&gt;But hey, according to no voters the skill wasn't exciting or drastic enough to stand on its own, while at the same time changing too much about OSRS and being EoC, but also it's a boring bank standing skill to much like the other skills in the game, but it was also too much like RS3. Or something like that.
---
Lol its kinda sad how true this is
---
What the fuck is wrong with you guys
---
lmfao, not a single thing in this comment is true. Get fucked.
---
Summoning was extreeeeeemely controversial, that's why they backed up 2007 instead of 2008. It would never ever pass.
---
Isn't playing it an investment?
---
 Perhaps my account was hacked?
---
Ducking dumb

Here in the US it is 2/3rds. I wasn't aware it was a term that had multiple definitions. Thanks.
---
We would certainly have sailing in game currently if devs gave it 1/10th of the effort they gave to warding. I love how jagex put all their eggs in one basket and now its ‚Äúwell u guys said no to warding so prolly never get a skill now‚Äù
---
All subsequent votes after the first from the same IP address will count as 3/5th of a full vote
---
No because they'd pass, and for some reason they want a new skill.
---
But I do agree with you, and I know they'd pass.
---
I‚Äôm not op lol
---
&gt;recount 
---
FTFY
---
I don't even see the point of a skill that gets solved before its even out.
---
I should note that I have not played runescape since before June.
---
Guac man good
---
Every bar smelts for a loss unless done at the Blast Furnace where coal use is halved.

Ya sorry OP but they said if warding didn‚Äôt pass nothing tied with it was coming to the game your out of luck. grind them MOBS boy
---
he aint wrong
---
Different strokes for different folks.  I got extremely bored of just grinding whatever I could only to make money, so ironman mode was a good change for me.  Everything I do makes progress towards something I need rather than just grinding gp.
---
I'm not sure the voting mobs demonstrate the integrity if the polling system very well. Hiding poll results hasn't done much to keep people from mass no voting things that would actually improve the game.
---
Well that's just it, there could be mis-information and offers of give-aways for certain votes. I would hope and think that most game updates wouldn't justify something like that but who knows with the more divisive or uncertain ones.
---
I used to make good money picking up people's bolts at castle wars lol
---
They'd just leave bolts that were like 1.5k each on the ground.
---
It doesn't really matter what something brings. About a third of the players just don't want a new skill despite claiming they do. Once something gets fleshed out enough they will find something to dislike and vote no.
---
Imagine all the "I've been hacked" posts
---
Why doesn't Jagex ban  Runelite+ and the other OP plugins?
---
It would've completely destroyed runecrafting and it still managed to get that high yes%
---
oh thats sick! i just started using runelite a week ago so hopefully that setting is on by default cause i havent tweaked them much yet
---
They failed so they won‚Äôt be added into the game.
---
It absolutely does matter what it brings.  Im just gonna repost what i said on a different thread so i dont have to retype it out.
---
&gt; Players are gonna vote yes for new content. We say that with DS2 and MM2 and now SotE. Relocating content is not the same as creating new content. Which is why Sailing seems like it would be the most likely addition if were to see a new skill.
---
Vote no to all polls NO CONTENT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
---
I'de love to hear someone explain how warding would have changed the game more than something like the blowpipe, which is a sole item btw.  It'd be pretty funny to watch them struggle.
---
Thank you, and I understand that it's basically a moneysink but I was just trying to see if there's a method where you don't lose too much cash. A good median method between efficient and cost effective
---
Or, you know, do the puzzle?
---
Too little too late
---
Besides the fact that you can‚Äôt properly have a discussion besides just saying I‚Äôm stupid, who‚Äôs the dense one?
---
Where in his post does he say that? One can acknowledge being an idiot and also be one.
---
What about a Speechcraft skill where you run a player owned kingdom and the entirety of the skill is based around raising your subjects to become better at things through playing minigames with them? The reward would be getting NPC subjects that you can gear up and play Trouble Brewing or other minigames with because no one plays that game and you need to make up your own friends to get a good game going.
---
Heck, make your player owned kingdom attackable by other players in a new minigame that trains Speechcraft. Call that minigame Castle Wars 2. It's just like those Clash mobile games but on the runescapes.
---
You know not everyone thinks the same as the handful of people who said one thing to you about the topic? The % of max players thinking like that would be so insignificant it's not funny.
---
Even that poll has it win
---
Fuckin lol
---
I don't get it. Osrs has plenty of new content.
---
It's absolutely wonderful to see such passion for an in game poll. I hope all votes are heavily debated as this.
---
??? he said 2/3 of the player base wanted it. . . and your counter point is that 1/3 of the player base said no? I'm not arguing the outcome.
---
I got 70 base combat
---
PUT ME IN COACH I CAN DO IT JUST GIVE ME A SHOT
---
Ezpz
---
Don't think he fully understands shorting lol
---
[deleted]
---
New hamfisted continent to make skilling easier GOOD, new skill BAD
---
Rip sorry bud still a nice hat
---
My point is zeah got voted in so a new skill could too.
---
They put zero effort into fleshing out sailing and it got more yes votes than warding did. Just saying
---
GJ same! logged on 6 accounts just to vote no
---
Right? All the way past mid game you can insta-get anything you need. Just hit 40 def? Go farm some random item for less than an hour, sell it in bulk on the GE, and buy full Rune. Done and done.
---
Back in the day even getting a full set of mithril felt like an insane badass accomplishment.
---
Don't waste your money paying for their shitty protection. Just find an unoccupied normal world.
---
You realise a sample of "like 10 people said it to me" is garbage data. They could be joking, and even if they aren't, they don't exactly represent **7 thousand people**
---
Warding was basically crafting 2.0 excuse to make a new 99 with mostly recycled content. 
---
I‚Äôd honestly like to see some of the armors enter the game without warding. They could enter through crafting for all I care or any other new boss or monster that just needs a drop table.
---
Need to remove the bottom right one after today‚Äôs disappointment.
---
Lol must be new
---
Because 1/3rd is still a huge portion that doesn‚Äôt want it
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right I made a mistake with doing quick math in my head 
---
But also I genuinely laughed at your last bit. While I was wrong, I made zero assumptions about what was happening and was just making a general statement. You can make a point without being an ass
---
Name some, please.
---
Because the OP plugins included are all client-side, so they can't be detected.
---
  
---
Similarly, Jagex also can't know what client you are using, only that you are using a 3rd party client (That's why using a botting client doesn't instantly get you banned, its the act of actually using the bots that is detectable)
---
Reeeeeeeee!!!! Pass warding pleeeeeaaasssseeeee!!!
---
Looks cool and can‚Äôt wait but as someone closing in on 99 agility I‚Äôm not really trying to Pay more attention when doing agility lol
---
you need 75% to win
---
Right understand what you mean about the community of a certain style dwindling away eg pkers or skillers, I think your idea about a grace period for content would be very beneficial, to cut down on wasted dev time they could use stock assets and even use beta servers to minimize the effect on the actual game for certain things (like an entire skill).
---
The people.voting no for silly reasons in your mind are balanced out by people voting yes because "eh idc". I have friends who when I went through the skill with them didn't want it, and yet voted yes because it's new shit. People are uneducated on both sides, and it's not just some elitist small faction of players.
---
Didn't get to vote, but my reason for no is that all suggested abilities for this skill could be allocated in to already existing skills.
---
 In fact I saw a suggestion to apply the designs to runecrafting as it is the binding of "Magic" into an object via a medium, runes being a binding agent. Runes at times being considered markings or certain patterns (doesn't have to be locked to what we have it as).
---
I think the one big pvp poll may have been worse. This one just had more people involved but the pvpers vs pvmers during that poll were really bad
---
lolol where are you possibly getting $10000 for membership. That's \~1000 accounts, which is a ludicrous amount. That's be about 4bil gp for bonds, which honestly I wouldn't put it past someone who was super invested either way. At the same time I highly doubt that's what's going on here.
---
There were already plenty of spite voters against warding.
---
Having more yes voters is a merit of the idea itself. The fact that no votes are worth 3 times more is an inherent advantage provided by the poll system
---
There absolutely is an advantage for the No side. If you need triple the population on one side for it to "balance out," that's not a balance, it's explicitly an advantage.
---
Huh? What are you talking about? What integrity..?
---
I don't think it fits RS at all. I think it should be in a different game, or maybe a minigame, or even just a major part of a quest at best. I thought it was a (funny) joke up until last week. No part of sailing as a theme to me says "RuneScape".
---
A case of "I'm too lazy to level a new skill" syndrome. But hey it's fine the people voted, democracy is democracy.
---
They could do a WT type thing which gives lower xp/hr than best abyss running for your level (maybe like 25-33% less). This way it takes longer to level up, but it‚Äôs less monotonous or something. ü§î
---
Nah. People say that the entirety of the internet is the same, but it isnt. Every place has some toxicity baseline, but it varies. As an example, Rainbow 6 Siege is infinitely more toxic than something like CSGO, Final Fantasy 14 is WAY less toxic than WoW or OSRS
---
Dont big ccs just use discord for anything important any anymore? Like they used to use forums previous. That way they know everyone in the clan gets the same info? I dont really see how this could actually be helpful
---
Actually woodcutting+construction might make sense.
---
ur a bitch lmaooo. Fkn neckbeard
---
I honestly think most people on either side were unwilling to budge on their stance. Every argument ended with each person thinking the other‚Äôs statements were nonsense
---
Mobile? Idk.
---
It would have been interesting to see the reaction if you had had this idea for the subscriptions poll and done a pro/against ad for that poll.
---
I mean yeah, but theres still the obstacle of navigating the boat on the seas. Boat building doesnt even HAVE to be part of sailing. Rather you could do buying boats with gold/finds then upgrading the same way.
---
Hot take; implement warding anyway.
---
LOL weve been saying why. Read the first post of this thread for gods sake.
---
The new akill was unique on its own. But like Sailling, people memed the shit out of it a d refused to read the blog.
---
For the first few years of Dungeoneering, Hexhunter Bow was so ungodly rare that many people hit 200M xp without even seeing a single drop. It was super strong and awesome, but definitely not make or break Dungeoneering like Shadowsilk Hood was.
---
I think sailing is it Chief.
---
Wait a minute.... is that Dungeoneering in the Gauntlet?!
---
The map was knows months ago through the dev blog and it was noticed 3 or 4 days ago already
---
I could really envision it both ways. I think sailing was an interesting concept and would just like to see it looked at again
---
Dude, I'm 2200+ and I voted yes, all my friends that were 1500-1800 voted no
---
Please try to bring back summoning! Look back at what it was when it first released and improve upon it. Each summon gives exp and maybe some of the better Simmons require items as a way to take items out of the game.
---
an example could be the cc [07 altar]. we help advertise who is hosting, etc on w330. it happens that it gets full, and we have to kick people that are off world and not on 330 to make space. another example, can be in pking. sometimes big clans mass up and when there is more than 100 people but only 100 spaces in cc, not everybody can join. thats another example. i can name more, but that is just an example.
---
Well done
---
I didn't even understand Dungeoneering when it came out. It felt like a minigame.
---
Fuck everyone who voted no y‚Äôall straight bitch made
---
Yeah... no, after about 6 months it was a necessity to get on fast clear teams for the best exp/h. Certainly within the circle of people I knew it was a requirement unless you were paying them. I lost a ton of friends because of DG elitism and I definitely think it helped contribute to the current toxicity of the HLC.
---
Here's the ones I often talked about:
---
* Skill is short and boring. I don't get excited by it like I have for suggested skills like sailing. It doesn't provide new experiences and thus won't achieve a new drawing in of previous and returning or new players
---
* It's content can fit into other skills. This is a legitimate point. Warding feels like an offbranch of crafting, and is not necessary to introduce the content.
---
* Item sinking can be achieved with their method (which I'll touch on in a second) by implementing it with existing production skills. This offers an actual benefit to training these skills up that otherwise would be lumped into warding *because* (essentially new skill needed to have an actual use / impact ... But they knew invention esque would fail.)
---
* Dissolving felt entirely out of place in the skill. Jagex even realised this and instead suggested it as warding/smithing/crafting. They can and should still push and poll this concept with production skills. Alternatives to alchemy that sink items without generating raw gold is a good idea 
---
* The skill was buyable and fast, while not being interesting or engaging. This is not appealing to newer players as it's expensive to look at doing, or extremely slow and dull. Is construction appealing to players without 100m+ to drop into it? It's repetitive, expensive, and super useful. Warding doesn't offer the 3rd, but does the first two, which is a sign of poor design imo.
---
* It didn't truly introduce much new content. The methods involved crafting robes, which is bankstanding, splashing at altars to gather resources (this STILL baffles me as a concept. Splashing is not fun or engaging, and if they want to fix the problem of it.. fix it.. don't use it as a skill). Its output was simply robes, and flat buffs to existing content that again felt slightly out of place in the skill (imbues from a different source.. feel like they belong more in magic, rune pouch upgrade felt like a tease and unnecessary power creep that didn't fit the skill, runecrafting pouch repairing and upgrading in robe crafting skill?). It didn't actually offer anything new besides new mid tier mage robes that can come into the game without a skill. It just reshuffles content and offers buffs.
---
So to say no legitimate reasons existed means you didn't discuss much, as I alone have talked at lengths on these topics. Meanwhile the main responses I get pro warding are "it's new, let there be new stuff.. do you want the game to die?" - "it's fitting to osrs (which I agree with, but that alone doesn't mean it's deserving to be added)" - "we need a smithing/crafting for mage robes and it can't be crafting as it is because "bloated" - "it's an item sink that will help the economy overall (which I think lots of people overlooked what made inventions sink successful. It sunk items.. to augment others.. to either siphon that into just XP, or sink that other item as well for more XP. Warding sunk an item to generate resources to make another item. It also didn't have a fleshed out system to target treasure trail items as heavily. As people would just pick cheap shit, and get it a bit off the ground until other cheap shit is the target)
---
Hey we've all done something like that. I came off hella snarky myself there upon revisiting this.
---
just add invention. Best thing rs3 ever did
---
Theres no reason to be in 07 altar outside of getting a host. most big clans have a shot caller on discord and everyone else mutes and listens for calls.
---
You literally said 3rd party sites your digging yourself a hole.... it's obvious you weren't around pre ge because this is how trading was done.
---
not wanting to train rc motivates me to do other things
---
all of the subtext
---
I thought this little thread was p funny. I‚Äôm on team u/PM_ME_UR_STATS
---
I'm confused, as I don't play Runescape. This says 2/3 yes. Why are you saying no new skill? Why is the title that the poll failed?
---
I‚Äôd like to see more of this in the future. Pretty funny
---
Is there an easy way of telling if I got all 5 of the finds that you clean out in the museum?   [This](https://imgur.com/a/qwJ5xvL) is what the 5 displays look like now.  I'm 10 kudos short of where I should be according to the wiki and I suspect that I don't have one of the finds since everything else is much easier to confirm.
---
You can use the crafting skill to weave baskets. Nobody does, but you can.
---
Yeah for sure, this one is just up there on the list next to it
---
I support both fleshing out wc for sailing and fleshing out fm for warding.
---
ur mad aren't you
---
You only play 2 minutes a day?  Because that interaction literally takes 30 seconds at most and yes it was important to the game because now there is ZERO interaction.
---
The scene, if anyone is wondering:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MocapWGtwkQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MocapWGtwkQ)

It‚Äôs funny cause the 1 nay outweighs the 2 yays

\&gt; We need wards

\&gt; We need wards

\&gt; We need wards

\&gt; *Crystal Maiden has left the game and has been assessed with an abandon.*
---
\&gt; Good Game!
---
We should call it Woodburning instead.
---
I think that's a bias based on a miniscule sample and nothing but assumptions from your behalf. I know maxed players that voted yes, and I know sub 1500 total people who voted no.
---
It's called opinions, everyone has different ones, and no group think controls the poll results.
---
It didnt even get 2/3rds approval, so what threshold do you suggest?? 51%?
---
We are literally getting a new grandmaster quest and city tomorrow so im not sure how thats a lack of significant content. Fuck redditors are actually braindead
---
Slayer helm is useful for only a couple tasks, since black mask is just as good. It looks cool, but you should probably work on other things if you haven't already and are low on points
---
There is a large group of people who ‚Äúwant a new skill‚Äù but won‚Äôt be satisfied by anything. Also considering the ‚Äúno new content‚Äù voters and abundance of different visions for a skill, it‚Äôs going to be pretty damn impossible to reach 75%.
---
I lost my quest cape and want to die
---
Also 50000 less people voted, if it would be polled today it wouldnt be as high.
---
yeah man, I'm gonna have to write down everything at work tomorrow to try and get as much detail as I can. Maybe, (huge) maybe, they'll be able to reconnect me with my account. I think I would literally cry I  think, haha.
---
Ok, so by that reasoning 2/3 of people agreeing on something should be regarded as it being well recieved?
---
How do you go grab your items without the boss killing you before you can pick everything up?
---
Never done GWD but I have the stats for it, my clan chat goes periodically and I'm really scared to join them haha
---
True, look at hosidius. I don't think anyone has recovered from the EOC update though, lol
---
Awesome dude :) congrats!
---
The entire front page of this sub for a week was "vote yes or you are a neckbeard". I would say more people were influenced to vote yes than to vote no.
---
Elite void
---
ive seen wackier shit than you,    i have an inflatable tube man in my back yard
---
I've been through the ringer don't worry about that. Does a friend for whom the loss of $8000 would lead to suicide also have the time to devote his life to a game deeply enough to earn $8000 in it? It takes a special type of person with a disgusting amount of free time and at least some degree of expendable income to make that happen.
---
ah sorry you're right let me rephrase: sacrificing 3000 real life hours for 3000 hours of clicking on a pixel game from 2007. the only bigger waste of time I can think of is whiteknighting sweaties on reddit LOL
---
Do you start the kill with a bgs spec?
---
Yiiiiikes...Alrighty then...Anyway...AWKWARD!
---
Chill immediately. Do what he says
---
Those are claims based on your own opinion that you are trying to pass off as facts.  Piss off with the strawman arguments.
---
People can still read the blog, formulate their own opinion on the blog, and still in the end vote no.
---
You guys are pathetic. "REEEE JAMFLEX DON'T DEVALUE MY OVERLY SPECIFIC ACCOUNT BY ADDING SOMETHING NEW AND INTRESTING." Come on dudes, those rose tinted glasses have to be killing yall.
---
There was a poll to change it and guess what happened
---
He‚Äôd build a wall around the Al‚Äôkharid. That fence ain‚Äôt enough.
---
Lol you know fuck all.
---
How do I do wintertodt with more than just me? I'm on the wintertodt world and every time I enter it's just me and I can't really solo it quite yet. Is there a way to queue up for it? 
---
Also would I be better off getting a full clue Hunter set before going in? I went in no gear because I was afraid of losing it all if I died and wooo the damage I took. Ate through all of my food real fast.
---
How much are they now
---
To drastically reduce the amount of bots, any proposed measures would surely affect the amount of actual new players joining the game. It's easy to make accounts to bot on, but it's also easy to make an account for a brand new player to play. Tricky business.
---
Yes but that is tick manipulation, I am talking just doing what you‚Äòre supposed to do and get like 150-200k. Why are there skills that give up to freaking 800k and then there are skills that are like ‚Äû30. Take it or leave it.‚Äú
---
was going to be a member if it passed, nvm now
---
oh good you already know! well this post wasn't for you then mate. but now you were still reminded!
---
well yea, when you leave out the 100% drop from zulrah, the drops will tend to look like that
---
Probably just EHP ragging. There's usually a faster way to do most things that people do, unless they already know the best EHP methods for everything, they're probably do almost everything "slow".
---
I track my EHP, but I don't put any effort into being actually efficient. I just like to track my progress.
---
Yo, I'm legit sad about these results :(
---
At 800k xp for 70 iirc and construction being one of the more expensive skills at 6.6gp/xp with oak iirc then thats only 6m with herb and farming im gonna guess total cost 12m max which, what are you doing with a grandmaster quest if you dont have that?
---
maybe when we were 10 in pre 2007 scape but achieving mithril hasnt been an "insane accomplishment" since i was a little kid
---
Go on then.
---
Supermajority
---
Damn dude, chill. Wash your face with some cold water and let your heart do the smiley emoji.
---
Just dont die and youll keep it when you go mems
---
Am not. Voted no, quit the game, came back for DMM and Ironman :). Enjoy your GE though, I like that I have content without it.
---
&gt;The item sink can and should belong to more than a gathering portion of a new crafting skill. It doesn't fit warding thematically and it could bolster a lot of existing skills instead of being the dominant purpose of one
---
I see a lot of people say things like this about warding. "It doesnt fit and could be better implemented in other ways". But no one ever actually describes how they would like to see it better implemented. 
---
&gt;Crafting is not oversaturated. I'm tired of hearing this argument with no actual thought behind it. Crafting is working with natural goods and smithing is working with refined metals. They cover a broad range of skills each in what they serve. Crafting works with fabrics/hides, glass/sand, wood a few other niche things. Smithing works with metal. Both serve multiple combat trees and other skills. 
---
I'll just counterpoint here. If crafting is working with natural goods such as wood, why are construction and fletching skills? I craft a birdhouse out of wood..but construct a chair? And what about bows? Fletching very specifically has to do with attaching feathers to arrows, it has nothing to do with *crafting* the body of a bow in real life. Do you consider those to be worthless skills because they could have been added to crafting? And I really think you're splitting hairs on smithing. Metal is a natural good. At the end of the day, every production skill could fit into crafting because every production skill "works with natural goods"
---
You could *very* easily reduce runescape to only a handful of skills and still have it "make sense". You could group hunter and fishing, herblore and farming, attack and strength, thieving and agility, crafting fletching and construction, runecrafting and magic, etc etc etc. 
---
I think that having skills with very defined niches instead of broad strokes makes content more accessible to new and old players alike, and gives more variety in a game which, at its core, is about skilling.
---
It doesn't look fun. Sailing was much less fleshed out and much less hyped and it polled better. People say "this is rs, skills don't need to be fun," but do you really think that a skill that looks boring is going to be popular? Osrs already has enough boring skills, it doesn't need more. Failing to understand and account for this was a huge part of the decisive failure of warding. Not some nebulous portion of the population that will always vote no on every skill.
---
Fuck I have that same keyboard still
---
Yup. That's what I just said.
---
Go on then what?
---
I mean yeah. Anything more than a simple majority is arbitrary.
---
Just give me sailing
---
All I have to say as an RS3 player who enjoys watching OSRS content creators a lot is that I don't believe you will ever get a new skill in the game, if polls require a 75% yes-vote requirement to pass. There's just too many people with too much time on their hands to make alts and keep voting no because they're afraid of potentially meaningful change.
---
That and I think it's stupid that a two-thirds majority voting for a new update isn't enough to push it through.
---
Explain.
---
Those reasons are just as valid as yours.
---
i'm curious what community response would be if a lot of the ideas were implemented as a RC update
---
I love you man
---
I would give my left nut for group Ironman.
---
Edit: That's my favourite nut BTW.
---
Thanks for making my point brother
---
The problem is that skilling takes no skill, ironically enough. Do you really want to reward people more for doing something mindless and repetitive, rather than something that requires knowledge of mechanics and quick decision making? At the end of the day Runescape is a video game, one of the most fundamental rules of video game design is that players should be challenged, and then rewarded based on their ability.
---
So dumb
---
Bgs spec. Rune darts.
---
I have only been semi actively playing old school for about a year and a half maybe 2 now. So i'm not too familiar with all previous polls for new things like i was saying. So to hear people put down ideas for faster rates or new rewards or mini games is really disheartening. People stuck on the "07 must be pure 07" are up their own ass as we have so much new content not in the original 07 that to say adding things takes away from that is just ludicrous. They have to know what the are saying is bullshit. But i agree on the other BS reasons for not wanting a new skill ie. Having to max again
---
Yes but that would require doing the mage traing arena...
---
Good riddance now back to R3 with the lot of you!
---
Its like we're all making partnerships
---
Ok I  quit In 2007 when I heard they was launching osrs I tried to log into my account what ?? It doesn‚Äôt exist wtf! 
---
So now I get on to jagex and give them as much detail as possible I 2012 before osrs launched 5 years after I‚Äôve quit and what ya know I‚Äôm on that account right now ?
---
You're by no means the only one, but now a lot of no voters have to pretend they were always on board with it to try to deflect the suggestion that they'll reject any new skill
---
Well played. And warding didnt pass as a bonus.
---
Kind of
---
Jealous, how many times?
---
üòÇ
---
Repoll Artisan! Jeb fucked with those results. Plus Artisan sounds like the best new skill possibly for osrs
---
Here for my free silver
---
Go to a total level world. No bots there.
---
Haha, perfect world that we could dream of, but it would come with its own problems or just not be used enough anyway.
---
Excuse my poor grammar from writing in breaks at work on a phone. I don't believe it's that ridiculous that it's "not English" as well. I think I just poorly placed some commas etc.
---
Nice work
---
What does a gay horse eat?
---
Good question haha... Probably going to finish up some of the newer quests and just grind some bosses to fund my pure!
---
herblore is super easy if you keep up with farming contracts now. you used to have to grind for seeds but now they just. show up. it‚Äôs great.
---
Dude like 3/4th of skills wouldn't have passed on a vote. Mining would not have passed, absolutely no way farming would have passed, Hunter would not pass, we probably would have Slayer, strength, attack and Slayer pt.2 if all skills would have been put to a vote. 
---
Imagine a vote for agility, "you run around this course for like ten hours and then maybe get a shortcut that you won't use after you do the diary".  No one would think it was fun and something they wanted in the game. Or don't forget all the awesome content that Theiving brought us
---
Pretty upset it failed tbh
---
Thanks :)

If nobody bought Bonds off the GE then nobody would buy bonds with their credit card in the first place... It's simple supply and demand. The only reason people buy bonds with their credit cards is because they are expecting to be able to sell that bond on the GE for a price they deem reasonable. One is just as significant as the other. The person buying bonds off the GE is funding Jagex just as much as the person buying them with their credit card.

And about your first reply, you literally proved my point. You said yourself you have a life and aren't able to play as much as the neets who spend all day playing. That's exactly what the point of my comment was. You are not as invested into the game as they are, so their vote should hold more weight. I get that you may be a veteran player, but fact of the matter is that you're not as invested. Don't know what you're trying to prove.
---
And as for your last refute about statistics, what I was saying is that with a large enough sample (120,000 is a huge sample), the amount of people buying bonds on their alts to vote yes/no is insignificant. There is no reason as to why yes or no voters would have more incentive over one another to actually buy bonds on their alts because they are both equally passionate about their stance. The poll failed at a 2:1 ratio of yes to no, so say 6 'yes' voters and 3 'no' voters each bought one bond on their alt to vote on. The new ratio is now 12:6 votes for yes to no, which simplifies again to 2:1. In other words, a yes voter who bought 9 bonds is now worth 10 votes, and a no voter who does the same is now worth 10 votes. Their votes cancel out and the poll results are unaffected.
---
I did them all (except of saradomin one) with blowpipe. You just need 1 kill so it should be really easy.
---
This
---
Hard disagree. Just follow a guide and know what you're getting into, until you feel like you can do whatever the hell you want and set your own goals and such.
---
it seems alot of people who play OSRS are from 2008-2010 instead of from when I quit in 2008 because of Summoning compounding onto free trade/wilderness removal (since that ruined the combat triangle).
---
That's what a lot of people are starting to realize now that the circlejerk is thinning out. Sailing was much less fleshed out and had virtually zero graphics budget, but still got a better share of the vote - people will vote for content they like, and, in all honesty, warding didn't look all that fun.
---
idk was trying out all the new dragon bolts.. but i hate the ruby draining health effect
---
Yes they would have. It would have opened up a myriad of good low-medium level money makers
---
Idk what's up with the projection. "Acne-ridden blob" etc, just because someone voted no. It's just pathetic by this point.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, I don‚Äôt play runescape anymore but I saw this thread, but the vote passed but people are saying they are never gonna get a new skill? Does it need like 80% or something?
---
How do you kill green dragons for a slayer task w/o getting PKed constantly? Are there any clan chats were people can get together to camp a spot and back each other up if they're attacked?
---
I'm combat level 62 w/ 29 slayer and just can't seem to get this task done.
---
Ah, I completely missed your point until you stated it outright tbh. Yeah, I can agree with that. The way the person you replied to certainly could have worded their take better (though, I feel they were effective considering the content of the person they replied to). The main point being made (my take away) is that we're all in agreement here. There's a plethora of content, and you certainly don't need to grind to max to access it (I never have, never run out of things to do).
---
I'm a returning player. So I have a low total level. I've been grinding and I'm 425 total. Can't wait until 500 total world.
---
Get membership sooner rather than later. Most guides have you starting with quests/agility/thieving/wintertodt, all of which are members content. F2P content is also much faster when you're a member.
---
Also, welcome to the club. :)
---
High Level Community
---
So If both me and my brother both vote, one of our votes is worth less? 
---
You really didn't think this through.
---
Right? They're all bad, even the ones that have a Slayer helm shouldn't be wearing those there.
---
dumbass
---
Ya'll got anymore of them silvers?
---
Slayer 2
---
Also I'm fairly sure the varrock mine is a bit better for iron. Chances are, that one's also packed with bots.
---
They both reference Majora's Mask time famous system.
---
I don‚Äôt know them off the top of my head but you should be able to look up which find goes to which case on the wiki
---
Have you tried going to different spots?
---
Can we poll summoning and make it not effect combat. :)   
---
Also can we ninja get overloads into osrs with 99 herblore :)
---
That'd make sense. I've been around since 2k1. I quit at some point in EoC (literally went to the GE for months and never left).
---
Yeah it's always got minimum 4 bots. Fally mine is a bit better because the scorpions help kill the bots.
---
as if theres any shortage of low-medium money makers. also low lvl warding would only be profitable for a week or two max
---
As far as I know that isn‚Äôt an option
---
Playtime is very important part of designing a content but it is not the only measurement of how good is update but it is important.
---
From business perspective - spending 1000 hours of development time on update that will add 30 minutes of playtime is wasteful.  You can make updates like this to make game feel alive and fresh but occasional, it can't be all updates. To keep player in game, to attract new player, to get old players back (and coming players back is very important for RS3 and OSRS) you need big updates that generate long playtime. 
---
 
---
About updates that reduce grind:
---
Updates have to keep players in game, player have to use new content, new content must feel interesting and be efficient from player perspective. If you would keep adding methods that are slower it would be dead content. At first it would not reduce playtime but would make game feel dead and not worth playing resulting in players droping the game. 
---
&gt;I don't think hours is a good metric for the health of the game.
---
Again: It is very important aspect of   game design. You have to know how much time content will take to not make it to short so players will feel satisfied or grind to long so players will not get bored.  When you make big update you have to know it will be XX hours playtime so you will not advertise big update and end with minigame interesting for 30 minutes.
---
Thank you!

LMAO like any of the ~700 skips would have made a difference.
---
I‚Äôd pick that up
---
So I haven't played in awhile. What is with people not wanting new skills?
---
It was a literal joke
---
How about add the skill without the broken rewards?
---
I thought sailing was just a joke skill.
---
I'd hop on once in a blue moon to see what happened but I stopped doing that after EOC.
---
-_-
---
Ah yes, it‚Äôs so stupid they stopped clans running blast furnace and crashing other blast furnace clans to get a monopoly.
---
We need more elements with shady clans in the background extorting players
---
Understandable. Keep in mind the world of members is much bigger. The best items are either expensive rare boss drops (20m -1.5b price) or untradeable rewards from quests or pvm challenges. While "just buy it" still exists for the boss gear the cost barrier is much higher. 
---
Also you mention getting decent skill levels - understand that high level non members and members are very different animals. You don't even really start getting into bossing until 70+ stats and ironmen start even later.  Ironmen don't get to start making serious combat progression until 87+ slayer for trident
---
we dont want a reason to skill
---
Do silvers actually do anything?
---
nEW sKilL bAD ME mAd &gt;:(
---
i was expecting some interview with the real ceo not ur shitty high risk pking :((
---
Yeah don't bother responding you'll only continue to look stupid
---
Devalues my shades of morton temple building pure.
---
A game dies when it stops bringing in new blood and appealing to people who haven't played it.
---
None of this listed content means anything to a new player or does anything to entice people to play the game. It's all unreachable and unmarketable to anyone except veterans.
---
It is what it is, we should be sorry for wasting OSRS dev teams time. Let's wait for them to propose another idea which community will discard as useless and not fitting again.
---
You're asking them to make new islands, with enough content to make each of them unique and not stale.
---
You're just asking them to update clue scrolls and make new locations, why does it have to be a skill? What would leveling it up do?
---
Buddy you do realize that‚Äôs still two thirds of people right. You have such a high opinion of yourself you think that you are smarter than 66 percent of people that play the game
---
That‚Äôs one of issues with sailing if it was seriously considered again. I see lots of suggestions like ‚Äúyeah and you go explore different islands and collect loot‚Äù. To me this sounds like yet another thing which rewards you with skilling resources without actually skilling. Idk maybe think it‚Äôs more justifiable coming from something like this than a boss or slayer. I just know it‚Äôs been an issue for a long long time
---
Hi
---
So? A skill being bloated isn't a bad thing, I'd say we should blaot smithing too
---
lol your idea is literally just doing clue scrolls, but as a skill 
---
i think there are maybe a couple hundred unique clues in the game? 
---
What you're proposing is doing the same shit thousands of times with thousands of different random locations
---
We don‚Äôt want a skill we want fist of guthix
---
Yea I keep seeing people say things like "this skill feels oldschool, why would you vote no?" when in reality I (and a lot of others) don't want any new skill. It's not about how the skill feels.
---
Or... every skill suggestion thus far has been shit.
---
Because bank standing with a useless skill is so appealing right
---
They were. Sailing actually got a higher yes% than warding
---
Who hurt you?
---
thats why i stated it would be polled again when jagex thinks its at a point it could be added and if it does change direction they wanted vote no
---
Yoooo one of the 788, represent!
---
Read again bro :)
---
hell no it wasn't, dungoneering and "level 120"  were the worst things between wildy/trade removal and EoC.
---
that's like a few hundred votes, at the most
---
I don't have alt acc. Most players don't

Rigour &gt; all zenites &gt; lance &gt; dhcb &gt; ancestral pieces &gt; avernic &gt; sang?
---
Just my opinion and i could be wrong
---
This is the first Anti-warding post I've seen that makes a very fair point. I was in favor of wardinng for the purpose of encouraging dev's to introduce a skill as I think they are going to be discouraged for quite some time. That being said, that doesnt mean warding was the best fit to add to the game as the next skill either
---
p
---
yeah people just forget how crazy fast fire lines are lol. Wintertodt is literally 200k/hr less than redwood lines
---
What's the point of summoning if you can't take a steel titan or a pack yak? Both of those did terrible things to the game.
---
giggity
---
runecrafting is more fun than woodcutting.
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄALT ACCOUNT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO VOTEü¶Äü¶Ä
---
This so damn hard
---
If we consider BoBs as affecting combat(which I think is easily justified) there's very little content left in the summoning skill. Sure it could be reworked, but I doubt you'd get the skill you're asking for.
---
I recall RS3 devs saying they regretted creating overloads since it trivialized so much of the game. I can't find a source for this though.
---
Rev caves was quite a good addition. Good for those who do wilderness slayer, good because it's a PK hotspot and is a bit of a gamble if you wabt to make some money there.
---
If you think 400-600m is a lot in osrs I‚Äôm sorry but you are play the game wrong. Shoot I pull in over 10m an hour on my alts alone while I am skilling and if I do tob/Cox I can almost average 15m a hour with a drop.
---
It is a bad thing when it doesn't make any sense. The same skills that go into making a helmet could theoretically go into making a sword, but the skills required to make a leather shirt are 100% distinct from the skills needed to forge fine jewelry. Crafting is bloated in a bad way
---
You're saying that only 10% of the playerbase knows what's best, and the devs know better than the players usually, but the reason for polls is to get the opinion from a players perspective
---
dont bother with research, it was already voted no
---
I thought that you were asking why maxed played were at the crafting guild my bad had a rough day
---
yeah new islands behind a level gate. with new monsters and new maybe trees, mining nods, hunter stuff. doing things on the island gives you exploration exp as well as other exp. 
---
and doing clues or other treasure trails things on the island gives you exp.
---
having boats that are like POH with construction stuff in them and maybe the ability to boat to places with no docks or rare fishing spots that spawn while boating. 
---
these are just ideas
---
You just got 73ed
---
sadly its true that people dont want to read blog but that needs to be changed otherwise nothing will ever be added skill or not
---
Reminds me of something that happened in 2016
---
Don't think they do as spines regrow
---
Yes I did. Why are you copy pasting what I said?
---
explain why a higher goal to shoot for is bad
---
The warding grind would interrupt the circle jerking and mass pking the people who voted no probably love to do
---
Because you said "Read again bro" and I did.
---
You want them to stop listening to us because they know what's best for the players
---
Are you maging for slayer?
---
fire mod gee these look awful
---
Diary rewards are not tied to random stats and tasks they are tied to the area. You want to increase gp/hr at dks, you need to master the area and part of that is double astrals. 82 rc isn‚Äôt even that high or that long of a skill to get to, what 2 weeks max of rc from lvl 20...
---
Sailing would have polled WORSE than it was if it was worked out because everyone that likes sailing thinks it's something other than it is
---
Wouldn't osrs' Lord Iorwerth be the old one? Seeing as he dies in Plagues End and the one pictured is his successor
---
What I meant is: Read past the first paragraph.
---
i mean not really true. i added more to it in the post above
---
Thats cool
---
Casual 99 farming in 6 months seems chill
---
Nothing is actually locked behind a diary.

Jagex sure knows how to do thumbnails lol

This is the biggest brain conspiracy yet

Regen brace or Combat brace probably
---
okay you need to contact a medium right away seriously
---
Blast furnace is fine. It gives a payoff for those who want to divert more attention to the game. If you want to level smithing with downtime you can just smith darts/platebodies etc. If you want to make a bit of profit on the side for a lower xp rate there's always cannonballs. I'd say smithing is relatively balanced.
---
and not all of them voted smh
---
F for rock homie
---
Dead skill offered nothing to the game if you own bis gear. Would be nothing but a 40hr waste of my time.
---
Shouldnt Dwh be a little higher?
---
If it's a vannaka task you can kill baby green dragons in brimhaven dungeon
---
Maybe it isn't as boring as I think it is. However, I spent years playing the game as a low/mid level back around 2007. I want to experience what it is like to do high level content and have a max combat level, something i was never even close to honestly. I can get to that point faster as a normal account. Not trying to take away from your iron man experience, I can see how it would be gratifying.
---
Yeah, you literally said that the polls shouldnt stop them from adding/removing stuff
---
So if a poll passes 90% or fails with 30% you're saying that the devs should be able to make the final decision on what's best for the players
---
Just don't be poor.
---
you telling me the people who get 60ehp a week aren't sweaty neckbeards?
---
Fr my guy :(
---
Artisan
---
I liked warding and i think that's a great compromise. How do we get the devs to consider it?
---
How about we poll all of the current skills and remove anything that doesn't get more than 75% yes votes to stay in the game?
---
Yes I did.
---
You still see bank sales around, they just happen to have 5000 of an obscure clue scroll reward for no reason at all.
---
Guess you will have to go to barrows like everyone else.
---
And a lot of people who voted yes didnt either. Ex: me.
---
It made me laugh, gj
---
The flaw is one person having alts to vote count as separate votes.
---
I voted yes, but still I think the 75% requirement is a great thing.  We know the game is pretty damn good *right now*, so we should have a strong bias towards not changing it unless large majorities vote in favor. Really any % is going to be somewhat arbitrary, but 75%, aka 3-to-1 in favor gives me a lot of confidence that this game won't have any crap added to it just because the pre-poll marketing is good.
---
T H I C C rock monster
---
SUGGESTION: dont do this
---
you're not even offering an alternative to the current polling system. I'm sorry that you didn't get the garbage skill you wanted into the game.
---
How exactly do we make a skill about dissolving items *not* bankstanding?  The most efficient way to break a bunch of items down is by standing by a bank, that will never change.
---
Unless you want us to run back and forth to something like a furnace, which is just bankstanding with extra steps.  Which got replaced with magic, so... it's bankstanding.
---
When Osrs was released it was the rebirth of a game that had long since become something entirely different. Runescape was still *Runescape* but the game a lot of us knew growing up was long dead. And even in saying that were you playing when Osrs was dying and becoming stagnant because the devs didn't know how to approach updates yet? Runescape definetely can die and has come close to doing so many times, and Jagex has had to save it from doing so every time. Saying Runescape is some eternal game when it has seen so many player drops repeatedly over the years is even more immature.
---
Seriously look at the history of Runescape. I've never played an mmo that has come cloae to dying as much as Runescape.
---
I still think the Devs in general know much better what's good for the game.
---
Let's give an extreme hypothetical example: Osrs isn't making any money and they need to add mtx. They will even say we need to add this or we'll be forced to close the game. It still wouldn't pass and the game would be closed. Just because some people don't want something added.
---
Smelting bars is money lol
---
n64 != osrs.
---
I agree. Giving the player options would make it way less tedious than it is. Sometimes I want to watch tv and play so the slow afk method would be perfect, and other times I give the game my full undivided attention and it would be nice to have the option to get faster xp for the attention I‚Äôm giving the game. Very good idea in my opinion.
---
Tbh I prefer this. Because now I get to watch a shit show of memes hoard this subreddit. It's a win for me.
---
*No, this is Patrick*
---
I did by saying the Devs should decide themselves. But thanks for your input. I didn't want warding btw.
---
50m of bonds buys 10 votes, 100 players spending 50m each gives you 1000 votes. This is 5B gp.
---
OP is a bigger twit than you are.
---
People with firecapes are neck beards
---
But that's to say people will pay for the MTX, how much will people have to spend for it to stay open? 
---
Imean, imagine the money they made on bonds from this poll alone
---
Here's how I went about my first kc:
---
Sara - kite zilyana around the room with a blowpipe, praying mage. Bring a stamina
---
Arma- stand in a corner and just use your best cbow. There's a method involving chins that's really effective which you could look into but for just one kill a rune cbow with rubies/diamonds is enough. You can bring a blowpipe for the kc and the spec as well, although it's recommended to use ecumenical keys cos arma kc takes ages 
---
Bandos and Zammy you can just tank it and focus on the boss. Use arclight for zammy. And bring a BGS/DWH if you have them, makes the kill smoother. You'll be completely fine with your stats to get one kc
---
Because judging a community hundreds of thousands strong based on a miniscule selection of extreme internet comments made on a controversial topic is not toxic.
---
The irony here is painfully laughable OP, take it and fuck off please.
---
Well the post is on reddit, OP also didn‚Äôt say anything about directing it anywhere else, so youre making an assumption off of an assumption off of a lack of directed information.
---
Point being there‚Äôs a lot of assuming going around in an attempt to tell someone they‚Äôre wrong when in reality, you just chose to add in the ‚ÄúReddit‚Äôs the only place people talk about it‚Äù even though that‚Äôs not what the reply was implying.
---
Reddit is an echo chamber, and that‚Äôs all the reply said.
---
Bye :)
---
One of the best things about rs is that you can do everything and everything you do helps you with other parts of the game.
---
Please stop trying to ruin the game by making it casualscape.
---
but why? it teleports to the entrance next to of the priff doesn't it?
---
There's around 7 thousand maxed players and over 100 thousand votes in the warding poll. Plenty of people voted no, hence the poll not passing; doesn't matter if you agree with their reasons or put words in their mouth.
---
I feel you, I have friends who play the same way - I just didn't understand why you called it "boring af". You're not really saying anything wrong really, I'm just being defensive. not everyone can enjoy ironman and vice-versa.
---
I think this is the reason. People look at their bank and say I literally can't fit more items in. They look at so many aspects of the game that need tweaking or improvement they feel dev time is better devoted to them. I voted yes but I can see this perspective because in all honesty I feel kinda the same way.
---
The devs are paid to do what's beneficial to the company. The last poll for adding in partnerships would have been added into the game.
---
Replying for some üÜì silver üí∞üôè
---
Where did he go? Wasn't he kind of new there already?
---
Yes but it's just an example. People will just vote no to things they don't like even if it's necessary. I don't trust random people who vote out of spite over serious content creators who want this game to succeed. I still want the polling system so they can get feedback. I just don't want it to be the deciding factor.
---
That might be. But, I take solace in the fact that I know the difference between your and you're.
---
[Long way to go like always it aint happening or wont be announced this year dont get your hopes up come @ me at runefest.](https://i.redd.it/exkm8q8nnac31.jpg)
---
OSRS will never evolve with a community so afraid of new content. Everyone is simply too afraid of the game becoming RS3 when that simply wont happen.
---
Why does everyone get silver in this thread?
---
All are just combat related update. Y‚Äôall just want slayer 2. I honestly feel like a new crafting skill would be a fun way to allow for crafting magic items. Why does every update have to be combat related.
---
Maybe my ignorance got the best of me. I‚Äôm recently just back into osrs so I don‚Äôt know what LMS is (or at least don‚Äôt recognize the acronym). But I do feel like since I‚Äôve been back, most of the polls passed are in favor of 90+ combat level players. I‚Äôm above 90 combat, but I still wish some of my newb friends had content geared towards them specifically. I hate seeing them join and get burnt out and quit. I wish they‚Äôd push past the beginning grind, but they all think it‚Äôs too boring.
---
Congratulations! You‚Äôve won gold for your outstanding performance in *mental gymnastics*!
---
Ah yes, some good ol' Pascal Wager type arguments.
---
I can respect that.
---
For the login screen B won according to the poll booth but if you didn‚Äôt check that then you‚Äôll find out tomorrow
---
They literally assumed "based off reddit", they're complaining about assuming while doing it. The reply is very directly saying that OP is ONLY basing it off reddit, they didn't say "reddit is an echo chamber" they said "You're assuming toxicity based off reddit". I don't know how to make it any more straightforward.
---
No he said the opposite of that lol
---
Cant be mad, as there is no new skill to be mad about ;)
---
Depressing when you think that one alt voting no overrides 3 legitimate people voting yes
---
I've held the opinion that the bar for voting should be higher for a long time, and it makes me sad that pro-warding redditors are only just now supporting the idea because they lost and want to take a jab at the section of the community they've been shit-talking for weeks.
---
I care a lot more about noobs and bots voting than I do about experienced players having extra votes. In fact, these "alt accounts" that y'all are so afraid of are, in reality, far higher total level than you think. Do you think the average end-game player's ironman is less than 1000 total? It isn't.
---
Yeah I totally agree with what you said. They do have trouble retaining players because early/mid game grind is ROUGH and boring. I have quit 3 separate times because I was like 45 combat level. Finally just pushed though during summer break from university, and now I enjoy it. But I see why people quit. That early game experience sucks tbh.
---
Yeah but polling originally was designed to keep the trust from the community because they didnt want people to fear osrs would become rs3 based on decisions solely by devs
---
What I want to know is how is it more overpowered compared to other menu swapping plugins. Runelite's entry menu swapper plugin made 2 tick fishing viable long term by reducing the amount of actions needed by more than half and I don't see anyone saying that's overpowered. Yet Runelite+'s black jack plugin which does the same thing but for thieving is in most players eyes.
---
isnt warding just bank standing and buyable? Wouldnt call it the best possible content
---
This changes everything
---
Grand Exchange finally being added is literally the only reason I picked up this game.
---
Not slightly easier, the quest usualy takes an hour and the skip would make it a 10 mins spacebar spam
---
Lmao just be thankful it was ‚Äújust‚Äù runescape and not your real life.... right?
---
Free silver i guess lol
---
People play the game very differently and very few are a true Jack of all trades. If there were not such great rewards for leveling every skill to unlock quests and diaries most people would never touch half of the skills. 
---
So polling trying to get 75% of the player base to want to add a skill they will feel forced to level for the side rewards sucks.
---
That is all, of course a lit of good content has been and will continue to be added.
---
Let's have a skill that you level up by reporting scammers at GE.
---
45 mins longer
---
Why do they even bother polling? Just add it... The people who are against it won't quit, they're already addicted.
---
OSRS needs at least 75% of the vote to be on yes to pass and jagex has no plans to change that. the idea of this is to only add content the majority like rather than a slight majority.
---
it‚Äôs honestly a great system and i don‚Äôt want it to change, even though i voted for warding and am disappointed it didn‚Äôt pass.
---
Why you gotta do my boy, John Oliver dirty like that?
---
" can start this quest after the next update by talking to Edmond at his home, north of the Flying Horse Inn in East Ardougne."
---
from in game quest guide
---
Yeah and I say keep the polls. Let's use warding for example. The Devs want to add it and 66% of the player base wants it aswell. Should they not add it because 30% is against it? Would the community really riot because Devs and 2/3rd of the community want something in the game?
---
Youre a fucking saint. Even if it didnt influence the outcome that much
---
PSA could also be a public reminder. It isn‚Äôt solely for things that aren‚Äôt publicly known yet lol 
---
Also it‚Äôs ‚Äúphishing‚Äù not ‚Äúfishing‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a way of life
---
&gt;Yes, you're stating that you don't like what makes this game different and prefer the features that are found in every commercial video game.
---
What makes thia game different is that there is no wrong way to play it. You can play it however you want. Both of you need to just let each other enjoy what the other enjoys.
---
commenting for silver, fam
---
Even without any plugins its better than vanilla,opens at correct size and looks nice. 
---
Atleast it works without plugins nowadays.
---
Daily reminder that the Brexit situation happened because a tiny majority won over those that chose to remain. Obviously this is an extreme example, but Jagex's democracy is better than the UKs Government.
---
What happend to pvp updates? (No lms aint one).
---
Same people who voted no on warding will vote no to adding it to RC because it would improve the skill and they already grinded it out when it was bad so everyone must do the same.

I voted yes to warding and was really salty when I saw it failed, but tbh you have a lot of good points and I agree with 90% of your post. But I also anticipate that I'll be voting no if they try to massively overhaul existing skills that I've already put a lot of work into. Like, part of what makes runecrafting such an achievement is that it's such a bitch.
---
I am wondering how many used to vote yes for the meme. Because that is how sailing started out wasn't it?
---
\&gt;the game wouldn't be worse with a new skill added
---
i've been holding off making a new f2p uim because i fully expected warding to change the game entirely
---
btw jagex if you want a real suggestion nobody would vote no on, have a mage armor shop in port sarim or something. this isn't hard.
---
blast mine?
---
Fucking golden üòÇ
---
Raids 2 &gt; Raids 1 &gt; Vorkath/Zulrah &gt; other bosses
---
Investing/flipping can be better than that but tbh thata just educated guessing that can result in huge wins or losses.(Made me like 30b doe)
---
Yikes. That would be completely disconnected from rcing as a portion of the skill, and not play well at all. Rcing needs xp rate fixes across the fucking board, without polls plagued by elitist fucks with rune running clans who profit and have reason to manipulate the results as much as possible, but that would still be easier than trying to fit warding into rcing.
---
&gt;- crafting? bloated
---
That's why silver jewellery failed as well, right?
---
&gt;- fletching? - bloated
---
That's why we didn't get wooden shields and battlestaff carving, right?
---
&gt;- magic? skill is already easy enough
---
That's why they updated the Plank Make spell to make it more afk, right?
---
It is. Everything before EoC is RS2, and Oldschool is supposed to be RS2, but the "I left due to wildy/freetrade" bastards get stuck on 2007 which was one of the weakest goddamn years of Runescape if you ask me(I started in 2006). 2008-2011 are the gold standard in my book. I wish Oldschool was that, but with freetrade/wildy intact.
---
If you really wanted to do a majority rules vote here it should've been 50% to pass. 75% is asking too much considering 33% of the playerbase just decided we shouldn't have a new skill. Seems pretty dumb to me knowing that the majority of the playerbase want a new skill and yet we still haven't recieved one after all these years, and Warding was legitimately really well designed by the end and would've made a great addition to the game while providing economic stability through item syncs. Too bad.
---
Well if you buy t shirt, it is like 20 bucks and 15 minutes of your life. 99s are much bigger investment. I don't have any 99s because those take so fucking long, If I would dedicate my time for getting skill cape, I would be mad too if they make it substantially easier
---
Gonna be a new trend to buy ads for trolling polls lol
---
Pics of chat box message or if didn‚Äôt happen. Could be someone standing under you.
---
It shouldnt.
---
Stop with this.
---
I agree
---
thats the one yes
---
I think that's the biggest argument against adding Warding as a skill, honestly.
---
If the only way to make people interested in the content is to attach an entirely new skill to it, then it's probably a bad idea.
---
Extra downvote for you, cause you downvoted a blatantly obvious, reasonable answer to your question
---
Well you know that he meant making gear
---
If you think this is childish and pathetic you must have missed the week long in game pride event lol. The first time I was legitimately embarrassed to call myself a RuneScape subscriber.
---
I was more thinking why the dude can afford both a BP and a necklace of anguish but cant get himself barrows gloves.
---
What quest is that? Mourning end?
---
Block list for Nieve?
---
whatever they decide on. i mean you cant just have plp idling around in their offices
---
Because it's a joke. Why do people comment this on every fucking post that's funny like it's tumblr?
---
'Some people' being one guy most likely.
---
That picture was a joke. It was from another poll in the past.
---
&gt; It's fine money for the level
---
Yes that's what I said. 300k+ for a stat in the 60's is great.
---
No wonder it‚Äôs a dying genre. Tbh mmos need more skill trumping time investment but time investment having some progression on your character and consequently how you play the game since time investment = more practice = more skill.
---
Voting should require 1250 total at the very least imo, 300 is an absolute joke
---
Fuck.
---
Is that what google translate gave you?
---
No, it's called bunyip!
---
That's just silly. It sounds to me like you were just supporting Warding for the sake of having a new skill, not because you were particularly interested in the content.
---
If the content is good(and, realistically, a lot of it was), then it should be welcomed into the game in whatever form makes sense. If the content was bad, it shouldn't be brought into the game in any way. It makes no sense to support a new delivery method for content you don't seem to want.
---
Why the Cata icon, that still hurts, man
---
[he](#gnomechild)
---
Rcing needs fixes, but it already does more than enough. Fix the xp rates and blanket ban rcing running clan owners, and we'll see exactly how quick the shit xp rates they polled from way back get repealed so that the kill is viable. 
---
I shouldn't have to max-focus for hours on end to barely scrape out 50k xp an hour, doin lava runes no less, just to get something you could even consider to be a viable xp rate.
---
you fool, not even a lot of IQ. go awei no buly pls
---
*rune*
---
*Craft*
---
Neither of those speaks "imbuing magic robes" to me
---
That works the same for voting yes.
---
The 75% is to make sure the majority of players want it. I understand your point, but it is wrong.
---
Can 100% say r6 and ffxiv is way less toxic, can count on 1 hand how many bad encounters I‚Äôve had on those games, I‚Äôve had several in the last 2 weeks just on osrs. people don‚Äôt think it be like it is, but it do.
---
I voted yes btw. Not going to go read the post again, so everyone saying its buyable bank standing skill are wrong?
---
Why would you say something like this if you don't have a clue? 
---
Polls existed before you started playing chief.
---
Are you using google translate or something? Doesnt seem to be working.
---
I'm surprised that this isn't how it was originally pitched, seeing how the skill is basically just the armour section of crafting but for mage gear. It would make sense to add new runecrafting content. It's by far the biggest drag of a skill in the game, not just because it lacks variety in activity, but also because it's so slow. It can be improved without increasing exp rates, and can easily incorporate a lot of the elements of warding. I wouldn't mind a runecrafting guild where you go to farm the warding mats and create the armour.
---
i have phd in england (a lot of ezperienxe) ezperienxce mean that u have lot of knowledg in thing) )usually one)
---
yu r no smartr thn me argh
---
the content is great but don't want it without a new skill... however put it in RC and make it OP xp without nerfing and everybodys onboard lel
---
Are you drunk?
---
what? A no vote has more power than a yes vote. That's a fact. 
---
Using alt accounts to vote no gives a player substantially more power than using alts to vote yes.
---
I don‚Äôt personally have one, but check the skilling discord‚Äôs for the most up to date.
---
what will you do with that data ?
---
You will die on that hill
---
Shitflinging is the definition of toxic wtf you on
---
Na, just heaps of these possums
---
Firemaking is already in the game, and therefore you have to like it.
---
Warding is better than firemaking, which you are obligated to like, so that means voting no is hypocritical.
---
No voters: Destroyed üòé
---
How do you know this? You don't. Jagex claimed they go off based on the best idea presented internally. Specifically I'm referring to the trip they took last year to plan for content.
---
Great rational explanation and hopefully something they can look at when implementing a skill in the future.
---
people saying they spent hundreds of mils just to buy bonds to spite vote no seems childish
---
I don‚Äôt have discord. My block list is: Black Demons, Hellhounds, Spiritual Creatures, and Iron Dragons.
---
That's literally what he's saying, and that's the point. You can make only few magic items via skills (trident is one that I can now remember). I'm voted no to warding, but it's true that we don't have equivalent of smithing and crafting for magic
---
Let poll "Runescafting"
---
I mean you're implying that Jagex's management of the game is civilized.
---
Btw the whole Chinese buyout thing was like 2015-2016 at the earliest. Before that (and again soon) it's been all American/UK.
---
And yet Brexit was 50/50, jesus christ
---
XIV is probably the single most toxic MMO I've ever played. The problem is that the dev team is so heavy-handed in bans it all comes in the form of passive aggression and things that rarely involve chat. The community itself is a fuck cespool.
---
Anybody wanna buy my bark collection? 10% ge value
---
That doesn't solve people abusing alts to muddy results.
---
That south east bush
---
Do you need proof that people can be that petty?
---
You mean what the poll should have always been? All the questions relying on the first to pass was dumb and their way to force warding in
---
I enjoyed it
---
It has it uses where you are lazy to switch, defence and prayer bonuses. But it is pretty niche, up to how you play and if you need the gp.
---
It was my turn to repost this man. :(
---
I'm one of you
---
75% also keeps the integrity of the game
---
Hi, you seem to be lost. Please go here.  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/)
---
I think a lot of people want it as a minigame and not a skill. I'm not sure it'd pass a poll as a skill, but I'm positive it would as a minigame.
---
RIP
---
Those days are gone, and RC is not that lucrative anymore compared to money making methods with lower reqs. It's just so time consuming that people spend crazy hours on it and then say "wow look how much I made from only 95-99 RC!".
---
The only one I feel looks out of place is Iorwerth, the rest seem to match the style that OSRS has taken, even if not true to the 2007 style
---
Yeah true, luckily the type of job I have there is no beef with using Reddit when ever.
---
Jesus I'd give the man a fury after that display and if he had the 75 prayer a torture
---
Sailing is quite literally the dumbest suggestion I have ever seen as a skill in this game. It blows my mind that people would actually want it.
---
I've seen this before in the comment some where, so it's not "my" Bad guide.
---
Give credit where credit is due.
---
they polled NMZ as a "cool new minigame like dominion tower"
---
they didnt mention the part it nerfs literally every combat skill into a free AFK skill and is all around garbage.
---
its like polling wintertodt in as a "skilling boss" when all it is is just brainlessly afking 2 things until the boss dies. misleading poll questions that make the thing actually sound cool when its not.
---
Or because he needed that 99 rc asap  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I'm there already.... waiting for game update.
---
Something as fleshed out as Warding didn't pass and a skill that most people considered a minigame would pass, then I got bad news for you.
---
I think blocking hellhounds is a mistake if your goal is xp
---
&gt;just supporting Warding for the sake of having a new skill, not because you were particularly interested in the content.
---
That's a completely valid reason since skills are runescape. None of RS content is interesting in the traditional sense. It's mindlessly doing the same most effecient thing endlessly to fill a bar up. If you alreayd have all these things to do in other skills you don't give a shit about new things added to it.
---
A new skill is a new bar to fill and a new objective to achieve. The delivery method IS the content people want.
---
Oh no... my animation smoothing.... headache incoming..
---
Nowdays PVM in osrs is really fucked up. Bosses should drop only uniques and not resources and if, for sure not in noted form, this is just gross. You should actually lose money killing bosses and get rich once you hit unique drop. Now you get money from each kill and uniques are just a nice addition. Long long time ago KQ had a really really shitty drop table, but you got rich once you hit d chain. I remember when me and bunch of friends were killing one single KQ on 3-4 trips, hoping for a loot. D long, rune legs, rune plate and warrior helm, full inv and lobsters, what a crazy but amazing times.
---
How come? They are slow imo.
---
WoUlD yOu LiKe A wHiP WiTh xMaS lIgHtS?
---
Ah, I getcha how it happens with my idea now. But I still don't understand how generating gold in such a way is a bad idea. But then again, I'm pretty sure you're right in that it is a bad idea as the duel arena tax exists.
---
Jagex: We don't want to fix bots, DCs or our customer support
---
Be a lot cooler if you did
---
Do you mind explaining? I‚Äôm a little slow lol
---
Lol good one tho
---
So overload a skill for no reason other then... cant think of one actually.
---
Know what, fuck it. 
---
Lets overload this skill as much as possible. 
---
Cause the idea of just making a whole new skill, flushing it out fully, and letting players do something new that isnt end game content, flipping at the GE, or sand casinoing, well... thats just stupid!
---
Aside from a quick fist-pump when I saw the results, the sub succeeded entirely in spoiling the mood.
---
Ffs, it still takes 90+ smithing to make rune equipment. Why don‚Äôt we take a look at that one for a bit?
---
It'll be epic dood I promise
---
Ahh, yes you're correct; that's my bad.
---
I was just referring to people who pay for an account that they wont take advantage of the membership anyway :) your case makes perfect sense
---
people who vote no to this are morons, and Jagex u should be fucking ashamed of yourselves. because once again the minority win and the majority lose   
---
iv decided since every single time there is an update that would actually be a good update for people and they vote no from now on until the 75% required is changed ill vote no to every single update offered and I ask others to do the same because as long as its 75% the minority rule this game and the majority have to see all the things they want pass them by
---
It seems like the justification here for keeping a poor decision of game design in the video game is the fact that "this is the way its always been." My Runescape experience isn't shaped by having to go through the Underground Pass three times or one time.
---
I can't wait to log back on, do my regular herb/bird houses and wait a week til I a good guide is out and I care enough...
---
‚ÄúBuild the wall! Keep those filthy no-voters out.‚Äù
---
Gratz! For me the views on the game changed a lot when I maxed. It felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders and I could see many things in game in a positive way. For example way back I thought I'd just be camping raids and PvM after maxing but I'm actually doing less of it now than I used to because I'm enjoying other stuff.
---
I actually thought voting no was kind of a meme... Guess people really didn't want it.
---
olvs were game destroying. So was summoning, it nuked PvM in many ways. All it did for skilling was move the goal-post forward. For example if you wanted to rc reasonably you were basically required to level summoning first. That doesn't improve the skill at all, it just increases the barrier to reasonable entry and devalues runes.
---
I don't get it. I thought Black Graceful woulda been the perfect opportunity for the new agility course. What is the point of doing the course at all when you don't get marks and everyone does Ardy at 86 anyways?
---
Awesome work! :)
---
This galaxy brain just put his own words in ALL the no voters mouths. When the dude you're replying to implied "a lot". 
---
Nice.
---
Wait why not both?
---
Even longer Underground Pass 2 - Electric Boogaloo.
---
99 rc requirement.
---
This guys vote is worth three of mine üôå
---
I'm super ashamed of the community.  It wasn't skills that killed RS3, it was the MTX and the final nail in the coffin was EOC.  We could've had more to this game, but the 33% are so fucking toxic it's un real.
---
Um no. You want to keep all players playing as much as possible and never taking extended breaks. Thats how you keep a game alive when its mostly subscription based revenue. Even if the burnt out salty ones make it a little worse for the rest.
---
I thought that research was about dark text on a white background was just easier to read and not about eye strain?
---
Also perhaps it is just different for everyone but for me light mode strains my eyes a lot more. 
---
The thing is, light mode never used to strain my eyes when I was younger but perhaps over-exposure to it caused my eyes to become more sensitive or something? I dunno.
---
This. The game isn't stagnating because a skill you like isn't passing. Did I vote for warding? Yes. Am I disappointed that it failed? Yes. Am I going to run out of stuff to do? No. I need to max, learn raids, get myself a wilderness boss pet and re-earn my quest cape when the new quest comes out. Coincidentally, three of my four goals only exist because of the polls.
---
is it? when double the people voted yes than no i don't think you know how polls work, its because of jagex stupid 75% rule that allows the minority to dictate what gets added and what DOSENT
---
you kids have it easy. Back in RSC the hardest part of the quest was talking to the starting NPC.
---
please let us pet the stray dog jagex (or let us give it food)
---
See the difference between real questers aka Graceful boys and the showoffs with spectral etc ;)
---
You can, but you won't
---
They expect a completely new game from just 1 skill.
---
then delete every update for the past 5 years
---
Sourscape
---
Jagex should remove voting polls. So terrible ideas can be implemented. Eventually ruining the game to the point where I can finally lose the one thing that's keeping me from ending it all.
---
So all we need to do is ban 1 guy and there's warding? HELL YEA ITS THE BANBAN4U
---
I wonder how many yes votes were alts. They could have used them much more considering 1 no is worth 3 yes. I wonder how many people would be complaining about alt votes if this passed (much much less complaining I imagine).
---
Inb4 rollback because of quest bug
---
Reeeeee can't play
---
Same here
---
lol
---
I'm not. I was speaking entirely theoretically and simply discussing the ramifications of said anonymity.
---
Good luck ladies and gentlemen lmao
---
to much effort required
---
bruh runelite is outdated now and i dont even have normal rs installed
---
you mean what they have been doing over the last 5 years and every time a skill fails a poll?
---
same
---
Pretty good still if you plan on doing demonic gorillas.
---
Literally coming to make this topic, I also cannot load the client.
---
Don't you dare... lol
---
interferes with my ezscape
---
Only 2500 people online, so I'd say yes.
---
Yepppp
---
It's always like this with an update lol?
---
Yep just spamming the client rn
---
STOP BEING SAD 4HEAD
---
That's my breakpoint too I think - if I can sit back, draw maps, and properly consider without draining a mill's worth of prayer pots, I'll probably really enjoy the puzzle
---
Alot of ppl doing it rn, mightaswell follow the train
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the I shopped version of this photo has hitler riding the sled.
---
Yup me too, both runelite and regular client
---
Bless jagex.
---
Get a message about it possibly being blocking by firewall, i added an exclusion for the file and even ran it as admin. Nothing.
---
How did you get this? The game isnt loading for me lol
---
Pretty normal Jagex move it seems.
---
Why are none of my clients working :'(
---
But what if it's a randomly generated puzzle.
---
Eh, a month of membership is $11 which is about an hour of work close to minimum wage, but that can depend on where you live. 2 bonds can cost 8-10 mil for a months membership. That can still take several hours to grind with the best methods. Not everyone has the time to invest that amount in the game
---
It‚Äôs just had a system update, so is probably still down for that.
---
Same - Up vote guys.. lets get this seen
---
Press 'F' in chat.
---
The update might take a few minutes
---
I'm fairly sure that's correct - It's as in the posessive, talking about the state of the rapier.
---
How is not effecting pking bad?
---
Same here mate
---
Those damn elves broke RuneScape
---
Really representing no voters properly here üëç
---
I wish they had done this with Brexit...
---
Never experienced this one i gotta say...
---
Not fucking really fella, it's hardly smart to be able to count two thirds
---
This is a really good point... its 2019. Give us multiple accounts. Literally every other MMORPG out there, allows multiple characters. World of warcraft has the same monthly cost as Runescape.
---
https://www.runescape.com/oldschool/world-map
---
REMINDER: Firemaking is a SKILL and it STILL EXISTS.
---
The skill in question?
---
You put logs on the ground and you use a Tinderbox on them. Or you play Wintertodt.
---
That's the entire skill outside of minigames. Two clicks.
---
All of us can't login. Help!
---
Until you lag for a few seconds (thanks steam) and eat a mage + range hit at seemingly the same time for that beautiful 80 splat and die.
---
It's such a sad story.
---
Hmm, though both lead to engagement with skilling content; this would be less about the resources themselves and more about the act of creating and exploiting the magical energy that comes from succeeding in doing something.
---
We even have a humor flair on this sub and people are still taking it seriously smh
---
Uhhhh
---
The runescape.com/oldschool/world-map
---
You probably have like 6 alts and play constantly, that makes you an outlier not the general playerbase. So go fuck yourself and get back to slaying and hunting pets.
---
We're investigating the issue now. Apologies.
---
Well it isn‚Äôt, but this is a big update so figured
---
Normal OSRS client isn't working either.
---
Same here. The servers are down.
---
Woox got in
---
I'd vote no on it in a heartbeat. Slayer's only 'good' because of updates that could've happened without it. Base skill itself is trash, apart from one thing back in the day: It got casual players exploring, and guided them to moneymakers. Both are things that skills like Thieving, Agility, and Hunter all could feasibly do with the right updates as well. Hell even Runecrafting could. Arguably Farming already does.
---
I'd only vote on a skill like that if it was like Artisan, because it brought that content to Banking and Gathering Skills that desperately need that kind of content for players that do not like those skills.
---
Think about it. Region Locked UIMs revitalized RS Youtube in the last year. Why? Suboptimal skill grinding, that nevertheless proved to be possible in areas casual players would never even think to look. Artisan and Slayer both let you dip your toes in that.
---
I did want Warding, but I'll admit it was for balance reasons and generating new UIM content. Sailing looks like utter trash to me.
---
I do not want more combat-related skills unless it's specifically a PvP-related skill that also lets players who hate PKing deal with the worst aspects of it.
---
You can use bones on it, I'm pretty sure you do that for the diary
---
Completely right apart from the fact it was intentional.
---
Well done!
---
I don't think there's a single skill that isn't boring and repetitive after a while
---
The reason why the creator of the staff added multiple limitations is because they feared that the staff could degrade the edicts of Guthix enough to make a hole that would essentially let Zamorak in &amp; perhaps that is what Iban was precisely trying to do but feared it might kill him
---
The entire osrs community
---
Runes for plank make don't cost much at all and cutting logs is afk and doesn't take long to reach 70.
---
Or just buy them, getting the around 2m doesn't take long at all.
---
I didn't say anything in this conversation about *why* people voted no so I don't know why you're replying to me either
---
Happy for you!
---
No we said we didn‚Äôt want warding
---
Imagine if you won a huge stake or got a drop from tob/cox.
---
Well I agree on that, I don't think that playing osrs everyday over few hours is healthy. It doesn't remove the fact that people can be mad because they have dedicated so much time for something that was supposed to stay same and now new players wanna change that. 
---
Also if we improve xp rates our economy will crash
---
Sure u can blame bots for this, but overall bossing is more fun that grinding resources.
---
Thanks Kanye very cool.
---
Not at all.
---
A.) Keep Kingdom Running
---
B.) No Investment
---
Choose one.
---
500+ hours clicking the same thing over and over. That sounds more like addiction than fun to me
---
Those are kind of cute, not gonna lie.
---
Take that fat L like your boy Trump does everyday in life. The noobs on this sub couldn‚Äôt predict what they‚Äôre having for breakfast. Warding memers gfys.
---
imagine gatekeeping questing big OOF
---
boy you dumb as hell.
---
Despite recognizing the dangers of creating or perhaps "recreating" such long forgotten Magic, the creator must have done it for some reason, to protect something or someone, they wouldn't have created it if they didn't need it for some purpose especially when knowing the effects
---
When it's something you want, 75% is too high.
---
When it's something you don't want, 75% is a fair super-majority and it's all good and proper.
---
You can speak with her without wearing a camulet, literally unplayable
---
Because all that those sites are is a less convenient GE. It still takes you out of the game.
---
Let these losers keep their Max capes. They obviously don‚Äôt get many wins in life
---
People logged on to alt accounts just to vote no. That‚Äôs the problem.
---
Because thanks to the polling system they cant spend time on something until the 25% addiction fueled neckbeards who wield all the power is satisfied.
---
There's no way summoning would pass
---
Get firemaking 99 and use a ballista to shoot a tinderbox across
---
literally double the people wanted it. Minority wins because the polling system is ass
---
i love you
---
Still can't use Runelite, just get an error.
---
They give you assholes 30 minutes to quit doing important stuff, quit killing shit and doing stuff that matters and go bank stand like everyone else. They roll back so every hcim and player in the game doesn‚Äôt go complaining how a dc made em lose their hc status or how they missed a t bow drop
---
That would never pass a poll. Runecrafting as much as it's memed is a very iconic skill to runescape. You can add content but changing the name of the entire skill would never pass thankfully
---
Same issue here.
---
Yes that's super old school, change all the skills.
---
Fucking what?
---
Ye, its not a problem we knew this would happend
---
I haven't downvoted any of your comments.
---
This wasn't the log-in screen I wanted. The iconic stairs are gone :(
---
I've been grinding out barrows on an account similar to yours (I have ~70-75 base combat stats; albeit have 70 prayer) I haven't gotten around to doing the reqs for Mory hard yet (actually havent done any of mory diary), but it's still been profitable for me over time.
---
I generally use iban staff/trident of the seas, 1-3 sips of a prayer pot and a few monkfish per run depending on RNG, and even if i get the crappy rewards, I still make okay money (okay on my standards though) - getting the diary done would definitely help.
---
Exactly. I wanted Warding to pass, but I'm not upset that it didn't simply because it's what others wanted. I'd rather have no Warding and keep the system that just made sure "partnerships" didn't come into the game and pave the way for MTX.
---
Imagine only 35% of your country's eligible voters showing up to what is probably the biggest vote that will ever take place in the history of the country.
---
I dont think addiction should be misunderstood for dedication, nor should being a sane person who doesnt want to spend 50 hours of nothing to get a tiny advantage be misunderstood for laziness, Its called valueing your limited time on earth
---
Bunch of losers
---
Already fixed in RS3, which means its never getting fixed in OSRS.
---
Read the release notes in the web site and it tells you all about what has happened and why. 
---
There is a reason.
---
Same.
---
i dont know, the username Lagor is on a dummy account either level 3 or no membership and its annoying. People shouldnt be able to hold names on shit mule accounts
---
Yeah, the new dungeon in prif has more dark beasts. Removed for lore reasons.
---
Zulcano not a training method for mining and only giving token experience is kinda crushing news, can‚Äôt lie.
---
Fuck yourself good sir.
---
Ok sorry. 0.01% of normal playes bank per day
---
Oh, I completely missed that reading the patch notes. Thanks!
---
And like you said, players dont want jagex to waste time on things they do not like.
---
in this poll no skill would pass 75% and then when jagex will start on working on one skill that won, people that did voted on other skills will vote NO in final vote for that one skill so Jagex would not waste time on skill they have not voted in first poll.
---
Extremely dank
---
No lol. If there‚Äôs a rollback they would say that.
---
Otherwise close the game down early lmao.
---
Also the chatbox on first login says what happened to them...
---
Yes a skill released almost 15 years ago is bad, there's is absolutely no reason the add another bad skill because of that though.
---
What are you smoking?
---
Literally 2/3 of the community wants warding, and there's more than want a new skill and just didn't like warding
---
its fucking stupid, i had 8 imbued bows and now all of them are fucking gone
---
Thank you for this answer. I feel like this is the only serious answer I've gotten and I agree with what you've said.
---
1IQ maxed acc can't even spell "everyone" rip.
---
We already got new quests, continents, spellbooks, prayers and dungeons, we don't need more of that. What we haven't got is a new skill, so I say that's where the dev time needs to go to. A new skill is a bigger change than all of the above, which is why so many people are so rightfully fussy about it, but at some point you have to give Jagex some room to work, warding was only going to be released to the main game after being perfected in a beta. Every skill is boring in some way so in no way is that a valid argument, OSRS is and has always been about repetitive actions so I don't see why a new skill should be any different. Also, a chunk of the no votes came from maxed / high total level players who just can't be arsed to level up another skill, which is unfortunate for the lower leveled majority of the players who do want to train the skill.
---
why cant i wear god dhide chaps as a pure?
---
Sailing also got about 10% of the effort the Devs have put into Warding so far.
---
What do you expect? Every post on the front page of r/2007scape the last two weeks has been a meme saying people that vote no are sub human. 
---
In this case, the losers deserve to be reminded why they‚Äôre losers. Its because they‚Äôre brainlets for life. Remember that.
---
Or maybe because many people's view was: *'Oh it's not the skill I wanted, I wanted Artisan/Sailing/Other idea, so I vote no so they don't waste resources on this and will make my idea... eventually.... right?'*
---
I saw COUNTLESS such people in-game, on reddit and twitter during all three proposed skils. Its mind boggling.
---
It's not about warding being boring. It's about it being a new skill. Players are mostly just stuck-up cunts. OSRS will never get a new skill. None of the current skills woud pass. Is warding insanely exciting and such? Not really, but it has potential and fills in a nice lore gap giving good foundation for future content.
---
Sailing: Dungeoneering retextured. Good shit, now you can do boat stuff. Not that we don't have X million quests alread which make you use a waterborne wehicle. Literally the same deal as dungeoneering was: An XXL minigame with a progression system which happens to be a skill. They could add all the content it offers without making it a new skill and it would work just as well.
---
Artisan: Slayer for skilling. *"Wee woo now that's the bomb, am I right?"*
---
**Still, even then these are better than many skills we actually have:**
---
Firemaking: Making fires. That's it. THAT'S LITERALLY IT! Click on tinderbox, click on log. Oh and a "boss" which is essentially minigame where you do the same thing over and over again. Except now you get XP while gaining money, and not burning it away.
---
*"Just add this fletching or whatever to crafting/woodcutting/smithing, it fits there doesn't need a new skill"* I can 99% guarantee this would happen if Flething was a new skill.
---
Runecrafting is the staple soulsucking skill ("don't devalue my autism"), and slayer if you think about it only gatekeeps you from killing X monsters, while also making people not just 24/7 PvM at bosses and the most efficient training locations (NMZ, NMZ and NMZ in our case).
---
Fuck it, if they would poll Health to be added, I guarantee we would be playing a game without HP. How would combat work? The community wouldn't care, just would expect Jagex to figure it out, and cry if they aren't satisfied with the result.
---
Many current skills are shit, people are against fixing those, because "oh muh achievements being devalued, if I had to suffer through brainless slog so I can jerk myself off to my ego at night, then everyone else also has to". If a new skill is interesting, then "Oh that's so not OSRS/Ree it's RS3", if it's OSRS-like, then "Oh that's so boring, look just pull it apart and add it to X Y and Z". Well fuck, 80% of the game is clicking on pixels repeatedly without much happening. Outside some PVM, the game is boring, hate to break the news.
---
**A new skill won't ever pass. Period.** Not because they are "boring and convoluted", but because the community. No skill, current or proposed can gain enough traction to be polled in-game. And that is due to the community.
---
The problem with the polling system a LOT of bigger community members warned about YEARS ago. Here finally coming true.
---
So dear Jagex:
---
1: Make an **IN-GAME** poll about whether the community actually wants a new skill.
---
2: Fix the alts issue. Require 3/6 months of continous membership and X total level in order to vote. (or not, the bond money is sure good)
---
3: If it doesn't work, just let it go. Apparently the community wants a new skill, but also doesn't. It won't ever vote it through a poll, and if you put something in anyways from goodwill, then doomsayers would emerge saying that you violated the poll system, and *"it's the coming of the end times -&gt; MTX -&gt; RS3 -&gt; REEE (?)"*
---
So fresh and so clean, clean
---
I know they have a limit by couldn't they make is so that you can't vote on polls unless your over 70 combat and over 60 in atleast 7 skills and 6 months of age of account creation? I'd see that as a fair actual poll accuracy.
---
The 30 minute timer is there so people dont get disconnected mid raid or pvm trip, but not because ur not supposed to play for 30 minutes
---
Elena from East Ardy. The scientist from the mourner quest series who you help. Her new model looks like a damn alien
---
We can make it even safer by requiring 95% approval, that way there's next to no possibility of bad updates getting into the game!
---
I normally hold over 50 because if a war starts and i need to return 20+ times, i don't want to run out.
---
shut up you probably dont even have a 99
---
Seconded, no idea whats happened
---
Is that all you can say? Fuck you sad cunt lmao.
---
tldr noone cares
---
i am lvl 53 and when i crack it im like lvl 51/52
---
Doesn't matter, this isn't afk-scape. Why are people always trying to take away the prestige of getting a hard 99 like rc?
---
Oh, my bad then. I was under the impression that it was the contraction of "it has", in the same was as "Jagex's" is a weird contraction to do with the possesive.
---
Uim btw
---
And u need 50 dungeonering to explore rev cave to remove scouts
---
I will, blasphemy
---
Tbh those felt a bit out of place in rc but that is imo. Can't really think of anything better either.
---
Wtf. Why they sell for 30k hah
---
Pretty much. When people are *laser focused* on the game and playing for hours every day, maybe it starts to feel *to them* like it's stagnating, but it's important to consider the long term health of the game too.
---
Just for an example, I maxed my main in May 2016 and barely played for a while until I started a new ironman this year.
---
And holy shit, it's like the entire landscape of the game has changed in that time. People are aiming for different things, training methods for skills are completely different in some cases, there's quite a lot of content that makes me think "man, I'm not sure this would have passed if it had been voted in a few years ago...".
---
The game already has *plenty* of updates that have changed the game significantly since launch, it's not even close to stagnating. Quite the opposite actually, I found it pretty confronting how much has actually changed in the last couple years.
---
right? lol
---
Really shitty that it failed. The boys put in a lot of work but rs3 apologists refuse to let any new skills get added to the game. Could have been a really cool way to spice up the game right as people are coming to the finish line. Lynx Titan just maxed out on xp recently and the second place isn't far behind. Warding would have added another 200mill thus breathing life into the high scores. People are way too afraid of change, so long as it doesn't devalue previous achievements I don't think change is bad. Just look at the amount of weapons and extra content that has come out and completely revitalized the game. Osrs already is nowhere near 2007, it is a streamlined version with about half the content being new additions. At this rate a new skill will never pass because of people not wanting to lose their max capes, such a stupid petty reasoning. Every music cape and quest cape owner has to do new content to get their cape, stop being jaded.
---
Wait until he 6hr logs?
---
I really, really doubt that they manually release each name. That makes zero sense.
---
the Crystaline Hunllif is so cool! Can we make the armour look more like that / current crystal gear
---
i'm right though aren't i üòÇ
---
Crystal bow attacks too slow to be very useful, blowpipe is used for everything.
---
The shield will be really useful though.
---
90+ range, addy darts bp, Rigour, and slayer helm/task also absolutely destroys him. I‚Äôve killed him without even switching prayer multiple times lol.
---
No, it means you have 12,5% chance per lap to get one piece of the outfit.
---
Nice asking for spoilers
---
It's not for a loss if you mine the material yourself. Don't be lazy.
---
Diabolos!
---
The memes are so high quality this community can redeem itself from just about any drama. These memes could probably redeem hitler at this point
---
Looks like when they updated all the face models in RS3.
---
I love it, where do I vote yes
---
Old lady in Varrock? Or the lady be the lake at taverly
---
We will one day, most certainly. 
---
I think it would be bad design to suddenly jump the top skill requirements that much in one go, better to get there in smaller increments.
---
You are right. Although this poll brought EXTRA votes over the usual average. Since about 60.000 votes are cast per each poll, that's the base voters and since Warding poll got 123.000 votes, it means 63.000 more accounts voted than usual average. If even 20% these extra voters were bonded alts, that's 12.600 extra sold bonds. Obviously not all casts votes on their alts during non-game changing polls, but I believe many did get bonds for submitting votes.
---
And also, 1 vote is worth about $7 each because most people gets their membership via bonds. $11 is if one buys membership via monthly subscription.
---
By the way, you can express yourself more kindly. I'd recommend you to think what you say before acting like a bitch - you just embarrass yourself.
---
Guess u need one for the new quest
---
Whos saying this? Can you post some threads/comments?
---
People keep complaining about people saying theres no new content, but I never see anyone *actually* saying that theres no new content.
---
You guys are delusional. Sailing has no part in this tick based point and click game. Also will not have enough content and will be the most repetitive activity ever.
---
For its range distance and ammo free, it can be useful for wildy afk slayer and kraken though. Haha
---
Might be the elf in the underground pass from the new quest, never seen this step before.
---
Looks like rs3
---
Wearing a max cape combined with an assembler isn't functionally any different than just wearing an assembler. All the max cape Lewis are lost when you combine it with something else. 
---
If we're talking about the max cape as a utility item, then we are talking about the vanilla max cape. You are indeed misinformed.
---
Not my slayer... I think
---
I mean it's fair to debate if the 75-25 ratio is a good balance for determining the bad update passing vs good update failing thing but the premise itself isn't stupid and you aren't arguing against it well by making it extreme and showing it to be dumb
---
Change content to skill.
---
Here's whats cool. You don't. Woox said on stream 'black dagger'
---
And that's all it took. turns out the item needed is...
---
Well. It's not that. I'll leave out spoilers.
---
Regardless, what does it matter if someone has a 99 or not?
---
r/dankchristianmemes
---
thanks
---
As an rs3 player i do appreciate the ability of jmods to just do shit without a majority agreement from the playerbase. Yes, absolutely we have had some bad things as a result of this (NOT eoc, most rs3 players love eoc. But mtx is a prime example). But for the most part we get content that can be a surprise, and jmods can introduce content without needing a huge majority to agree. And we still have a big input into content, through reddit, polls, and surveys. I feel like osrs's system, while good for the most part, especially for things like mtx, Misses out on some of these aspects.
---
Same.  Manually releasing names from millions of accounts would quite literally take you decades.
---
Just sent you a DM. Thx
---
It's basically just a time saver.
---
your trolling right? I actually have to use over 50 bank slots to use this shield for pking now.... like why even change it... or make it like barrows.... anything other than this.
---
Arianwyn looks messed up too. Looks like an old witch...
---
why so salty? im new to osrs i dont even know what that was... no need to get your panties twisted
---
You guys have ur own subreddit.... BAHAHAHAH
---
I think I only failed the safe once or twice before getting the set, might have been lucky? Good luck on getting the set!
---
this was known since it was announced
---
Reading to a partner is an incredibly intimate thing.
---
You've missed out.
---
Warding would've been doing the same thing to 99 as well, just seeing different pixels on the screen than you'd get from crafting
---
Hoes mad
---
12/10 with rice
---
I mean, I don't think the G.E should have passed either. It's not me or you who decides what makes it into the game, it's the community as a whole. Sometimes that means updates I want in (artisan) don't make it, sometimes updates I don't want do. It's been like this since 2013.
---
Hahahahahaha. Damn. Smart to jump on it and make some money.
---
&gt;	Personally, i am in favor of a new, low impact skill to be introduced into the game. Warding, would not be a low impact skill. 
---
If warding isn‚Äôt low impact to you then you might as well give up. Hell a lot of people‚Äôs complaints about warding was that it was boring or pointless lol.
---
thanks for help
---
Ye
---
Wait 'til you see the new Elves, absolutely disgusting.
---
Didn‚Äôt spot it in the blog, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not disappointed to learn
---
So judging this is based on the RS3 Dragonstone armour, this is a new hybrid armour set? 
---
Basically what crystal armour was originally going to be
---
Does that mean that if you had traded the other way, you would have duplicated items?
---
They don't say skill, all the posts I've seen straight up say content
---
Just set a bank pin :)
---
You get kourend 4
---
&gt;Though it would actually take three times as many alts voting yes as no to eliminate the impact.
---
Yeah and if there's 3x as many people voting yes, it'd be safe to assume there's 3x as many alts voting yes. Doesn't end up changing the vote, just gives Jagex more bond money.
---
Warding would've eventually been made a quest requirement or be part of a raid or something and would've been made effectively required to level.  If your response to this is "just don't participate in those quests loooool" then you're just being obtuse, at some point it would have been made impossible to ignore the skill and play normally.
---
ü¶Ä ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
At the end of the day it was all a waste, very unfortunate.
---
Set a bank pin my dude
---
Did i get scammed? I paid 750k for a crystal shield (for dks, because ranged def is good there) and now it turned into 25k seed. Damnit jagex!
---
Must be the same guy that made the Varrock guards.
---
In rs3 it can be obtained from crystal keys
---
You know why
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄFirst to complete the quest gets access to the Scythe spawnü¶Äü¶Ä
---
You should just be able to seize it by force.  It is a kingdom after all.
---
The entire point of the dissolving mechanic was to have an impact on the economy. People wanted a sink for low level items that are currently propped up by alch price, and this is what Jagex came up with. If anything, I would have wanted it to have *more* of an impact on the economy; currently, there are no big incentives to train the skill aside from leveling it up.
---
And old school should not be kept "old school". Firstly, people are going to have different ideas about what old school is supposed to be; a lot of people have said that they voted yes partially because they felt the skill fit in with the rest of the game. Secondly, the game needs new content to maintain its playerbase. And we have *gotten a lot of new content*. If all you wanted was a carbon copy of the old game, you should have left a long time ago.
---
I used to think that "keep oldschool old school" was a straw man argument used by the pro-warding side, and that nobody was dumb enough to unironically say that. Guess I was wrong.
---
Don't really care. If that's how someone wants to vote then that's the right given to them. I mean, I think it's stupid, but it didn't bother me
---
If that‚Äôs the case why do bonds not sell for more?
---
Wat. Notable change.
---
I have an i7 with a GTX 1060 and run at smooth frames without the GPU plugin though.
---
*sigh* again hurling insults on those you disagree with...
---
You lost bro, grow the fuck up and deal with üòé
---
Are you lvl 99 thieving or something?
---
Mod Jed my friend, JED
---
I‚Äôd vote no trying to circumvent warding poll to add them items. I voted for warding and the items together. I wouldn‚Äôt vote for the items to be rolled into other skills.
---
Guess that's what happens when you don't just log out from what you're doing when the game is about to update
---
awful
---
I mean yeah you can fully enjoy the game while maxing, but the focus is definitely on end game, post max content. Fwiw I'm nearly trimmed.
---
All hail Mod Ash!
---
If you want to train warding then train crafting. You‚Äôre practically doing the same thing, so just use a little imagination. For bonus points, find a cool symbol you like on the ground somewhere and do crafting on top of it
---
Because it's nearly impossible to fix without ruining several monster and boss drops as well as the mining skill. Everyone always says this without proposing a real solution. No craft able armours exist above rune that would be realistic to grind for Smithing training. And if you move rune down the Smithing scale it would just be a flat out xp buff. The only reason the rework worked in RS3 is because they have a lot more content post rune. And it's OP as hell.
---
Ah yes, remember because changes have occured we have all collectively lost the right to call bad changes bad.  Next update, we're adding a photo of my shriveled cock and balls to the grand exchange.  Sorry, you don't get to complain about it because runelite exists.
---
I bought one for 30k lol
---
Deadass. We'd have MTX in the game before we could blink if Trump was running things lmao.
---
all bought out as well. I just tried the falador shop and there was one available so the restock time has to be less than an hour
---
Have you considered that every model in this game is ugly?
---
Trying too hard
---
dude weed
---
Not right now, no.  Remind me which warcraft game we found a rainbow scarf in?
---
holy shit how bad can a post be...
---
Auguste has had his chat head for 12 years though
---
I don't think I've laughed out loud at a post from this subreddit as much as I did with this
---
Dude yea Auguste looks creepy af
---
Well I'm already over the 77 threshold, so afk bloods for me. Zmi was pretty afk to 77.
---
Even though warding hasnt passed could I get that sweet monks robe hood please?
---
I do. I couldn't find it again, but Mod Ash himself told that Warding presentation to the community required mostly typing and not any coding.
---
Warding was NEVER been coded for the game. Of course IF it made through the poll, then its coding project would began, but it didn't pass.
---
You still play this game? XD
---
I'm finally ready to try out the fight caves. Saved up for a BP and gear and supplies. The only thing I don't know is how to "eat" during the caves and specifically jad. When do I eat a restore and brew??
---
I think it mainly has to do with the community's expectations for what a new skill should be in OSRS. Personally, I think those expectations are far far faaaar too high. The only way we get a new skill that meets those expectations is if somehow the skill initially passes the poll by some fluke and actual development time is able to be put into integrating it throughout the entire game, as almost all current skills are integrated.
---
Also, there's absolutely no chance of a new skill if people don't realize it can be iterated on and improved and added to in the future.
---
Yeh, just get good. It‚Äôs not like they go two ways
---
Oh i know i will for sure
---
This is what people mean when they say the game is shifting away from the old school feel. Was there literally any need for this? Looks so out of place...
---
&gt;Not guys that just got less content and possibly prevented new skills and other substantial updates from ever being added to a game they love are totally not the brainlets
---
Don't even play anymore this is just my interpretation of what's happening
---
I‚Äôm sure it did.
---
This is what stopped me playing back in the day everything became too smooth and over detailed
---
Just get membership
---
I was just looking forward to having new stuff to do. I don't care if it's Warding or Sailing or whatever the hell, I just want new stuff. At the rate we're going they're just going to keep making the existing content easier and easier and that's all that's ever going to happen.

This was amazing thank you

at least he has warrior helm :)

Agreed. I didn't ike how the new elves look.

It takes 3 alts voting yes to counter 1 alt voting no
---
welp i just got an email from jagex saying they won't lift the ban even though I haven't played this account in years.

This is why I don't play Ruenscape because they literally have no customer support.

Thank you, did not know.
---
adamant chain, red flower, black knife/dagger,  cabbage,  wine of zamorak, nature rune.
---
Fair enough, but their own client wasn't working for a while which was irregular.
---
I doubt a tedious support skill like thieving or agility will pass because it would be a hassle to grind. As for a new gathering skill? Wouldn't make sense if there wasn't a new buyable skill to go with it. Warding already had the elements of both a gathering and artisan skill as well as making use of items from existing gathering skills that aren't profitable anymore because of pvming.  I don't think there will ever be a new combat skill ever because that break the existing combat triangle, even summoning had far reaching effects into pvming making GWD campable forever.
---
Thankfully modern Dungeoneering has fixed that somewhat. New locations like Shifting Tombs and Dragonkin Laboratory mean it feels like it's own thing rather than just daemonheim
---
Lmfao, to the top.
---
Yea and people expressed their disdain towards his appearance and they still add the Zeah old chat heads. Then people hated those so they changed them to regular chat heads. Then they add this. ??
---
buy tbow first i think
---
We saw pro-warding memes for fucking weeks
---
Trying to get back after about a year. Got a new phone and use the authenticator. How do I get this thing set up?! I‚Äôve submitted an appeal and Jagex denied it even though I had all my security answers. The account is old and uses an email I don‚Äôt have access to anymore so I can‚Äôt disable it. If I can‚Äôt use this account I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get back into playing :(
---
rip black dagger prices
---
You also need a hammer.
---
I have a tbow just wondering what to buy first what gear I should get first.
---

---
Archaeology and Sailing make much more sense to OSRS as a skill than Malding or Artisan.
---
Yes, it was boring and too convoluted compared to Smithing or Crafting.
---
And yeah I think time is better spent doing other things, even though I didn't vote. Nothing against Sailing or Archaeology or even Summoning or Dungeoneering if it's done right - in multiple dungeons across RuneScape instead of just one location.
---
Lookin like she smoked that elder cadantine.
---
it was a reference to "showing your colours" and event rainbow scarf comes from
---
Skipper here I wanted my say on other questions but felt this were too much for me to be responsible for if it were to pass or not. I realise skip means I change so it‚Äôs a no too.
---
nvm, it was a reference to "showing your colours" and event rainbow scarf comes from
---
Looks like the guy is doing some fresh moves
---
Useless? How? I‚Äôd rather have a fleshed out world with towns and cities than only have strictly what is considered ‚Äúuseful‚Äù by this sub.
---
Technically she looks better, but theres a big gap between "better than OSRS" and "actually good". This is just ugly and wrong.

Though this has changed alot over the years in real life aswell, everyone is hyper sensitive and cannot handle other people having different opinions. If someone doesnt agree with you, you shouldnt respect their opinion, thats silly, they're just bigoted assholes.

Ah my bad.  Wasn't around for that, heard there were memes and not good ones.

I think they hotfixed the restock time cause I just went there and managed to buy 3 in a row
---
WoW didnt invent night elves...... they certainly dont have a patent on elves with dark skin. Have you ever played ANY Elder Scroll game? Any warhammer game? Have you played any other game with elves? 
---
 I dont know if this is a joke post or are you being serious.
---
ye that one monk from that one quest has a mistake for a face, this gives us carte blanche to replace any asset we want with a modern version
---
Lmao. Who said that and did it get upvoted? You should reconsider your mindset if a game shouldn't be fun.
---
Gold sellers use the he to hide transactions I've done this with bronze darts before and sniped 20m from them.
---
Why does he have 268 QP‚Äôs?
---
And a runite bar.
---
&gt;so they're legit forced to watch streamers
---
Nobody's forcing anything, what are you on about?
---
Honestly every time sailing comes up, I think it would fit so much better as a minigame than a skill. It is out of place in my opinion.
---
Game was balanced for ironmen. I have an 11m cash stack on my iron without even trying. Idk the games too easy now
---
Why does she have an upvote on her forehead...
---
Divination very much serves a purpose in the game world ever since Guthix died. It was a nice way to integrate a lore theme into skilling and the quest implications when you do it are super juicy.
---
Yikes someone was touched in the little boys choir
---
Smh they ruined the natural landscape by building a city :(
---
They must have devoted the editor's resources to months &amp; months of Warding editing instead.
---
You're honestly everything wrong with the game nowadays.  NMZ was a mistake
---
And how to I justify a DEV aboud deciding to make elves purple/blue instead of a different color? What kind of question is that? The dev is allowed to have a favorite color or a choice in a very limited color palette.... I dont need to justify the existence of either of those things
---
Oh please no

Hell yea!!! Screw warding
---
its not cheating when the developers accept that people use 3rd party plugins to do the work for them
---
Not, even remotely, slightly, or jokingly that deep.
---
Chernarus? Can hear the BRDMs rolling on their side at the first hill already
---
Half of the responses to this are, "I don't want a new skill, I want this skill to be easier to train. Oh, and I want to make more money from it."
---
What a fucking joke this community has become.
---
maxed players are 1% of the poll, relax douchebag
---
&gt;A dangerous death in PvP causes Crystal tools to revert to their dragon equivalents which are then be dropped for the killer. Any Crystal shards will be lost.¬†
---
Oh he post write good.
---
lmao I was saying the same thing
---
is duriel working at jagex??? o fuck
---
enough whining
---
Also. 66.4% is not 2/3, it still would have failed.
---
ngl id rather they added warding without a poll and polled this fucking atrocity of a head
---
Why would you share this and make us suffer?!
---
Nice bank setup though.
---
whatever coping mechanism you need
---
Southern table dissapears at low viewing angle!

One Super Restore dose counteracts 3 Brew doses, but if you're only drinking 1-2 Brew doses for whatever reason, you still need to drink a Restore

---
Omg grats!!!!
---
It looks better, but that doesn't mean it should be in the game. It looks way too put of place at the moment. Update all chatheads or don't at all.
---
solution needed.
---
I don't think this was added for my account necessarily. I mean yes I asked many months ago but the rest of the underground pass has received many QoL updates and back in original rs I believe there was an anvil in this location that was removed when the new game was released. Regardless of that, I do get what you're saying and can't say I disagree and had figured a way around this obstacle for my account. But considering I asked and it was placed here I guess we'll never know if I say I feel otherwise it makes me a bit of a hypocrite
---
The only skill to require skill tbh. Click tinderbox and a log isn't a skill.
---
How much QP do you get from this quest? 
---
On a serious note: I expected a comment (not this detailed) on my reaction. Come across these problems aswell as I am a developer for a living.
---
Jad man bad
---
Justice for Battlemage Potion (4) !

Infusing is exactly what warding should be, Jagex drop le ball
---
This comment needs 788 up votes.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? I just did MEP2 last night
---
I think in plague city you can tell Elena that you love her and she says that she feels the same way but now is not the time for romance
---
It wasn't really a valid complaint tbh. Something like "a man and his dog keep killing me and everytime I die I loose all my stuff" just straight up wrong.
---
But yeah the response is strange and unprofessional.
---
If the xp is better the traditional way than it is to buy it, then yes
---
Rip my quest cape!
---
If you can't then I think we're agreed that it wasn't a necessary change.  Look at the old model for lord Iorweth.  Try to convince me that's the same person.
---
Yeah, no.  It's like if Eluned was white now.
---
Theyre needed for the new quest. 
---
OR use black knives that are infinitely cheaper
---
On average, people are of average intelligence
---
You know, frankly I'd be okay with that.  In fact I highly suspect the reason it wasn't that way back in 07 is because they wanted more members only content.
---
All it says is: "You dont need to do anything with that."
---
No option to rotate
---
Let me train prayer by bringing back a demon version of a monster and kill it using combat
---
Just use black throwing knives, save yourself a boatload boys
---
What a garbage tier comment, yikes.
---
I would never click any adverts about RS. Ever. Its just such a widely known phishing scam that I dont even do it.  If I ever see big news like this I manually go to their official website and look around there. 9/10 its usually a phish
---
MVP
---
On the other hand, it can easily be argued that the 3 skills presented were trash or largely useless.
---
Yeesh no one can just enjoy the game can they

Why did Elena need a failed plastic surgery? Can someone answer this?

---
You can get to the library and do the first puzzle right now using it
---
I'm not arguing, I know I'm wrong in this sense. I'm explaining why I made that mistake.
---
When talking about an item owned by someone, such as "Jademalo's sword", the original contraction would be of the phrase "Jademalo has sword"
---
It's grammatically garbage in modern english, but that's where it originates from. 
---
In this sense, I assumed that since the sword was the subject and it posessed the state of brokenness, it should have the apostrophe to follow the rules as described above.
---
I'm obviously wrong, but thats why I made the mistake.
---
They explain it on the last q and a cant remember 100% what it was.
---
How long did it take you? Gratz man! I'm gonna be up all night doing MEP2 and SOTE. Luckily I have all the reqs done!
---
So the 66% who voted yes can't be pissed? Wouldn't it make more sense to have the 33% pissed rather than the 66%?
---
Hmmm i have them but never heard of the gemü§î i must be one of those filthy casuals
---
Someone posted a negative review of OSRS mobile, and somebody from Jagex just replied "He"
---
damn man grats. did it take you 3 hours?
---
It really is though
---
Because killing clue hunters is so challenging you need to get rewarded for it
---
If they reverted it we couldn't meme it
---
You need to touch the seal of the forgotten just north from the middle
---
I found it funny, the hashtags ruined it a bit tho
---
This is a very uneducated approach. Comparing a skill, something that takes you back to beginning content with updates that are end game content.
---
Artisan would do worse. Now that we have seen warding and know what an actual old-school skill looks like. It was a 'skill' for the sake of a skill. But at it's core, it's awful.
---
Sailing is a toss up. It isn't a skill at all but at least it's interesting like dungeoneering was.
---
Same I didn't play when it released as without the GE it's not playable for me
---
Heh. "Better".
---
Yeah, that porridge armor sure looks amazing.
---
Why wouldn't you just show the quest completion screen? Would be instantly believable instead of thinking you red-&gt;green in photoshop
---
It was from their Instagram
---
Imagine saying yikes unironically.

The guy said "wat" because your sentence starts with

What's your in game name? :)
---
Tweet zulu for 50mil prize.
---
The puzzle won‚Äôt be so bad with a guide. There will be a rough guide out in the next few hours on the wiki I‚Äôm sure
---
At least for me, the frustrating parts were the shadows forcing you to bring prayer pots, and the handholds. So far neither of those are present in the new puzzle.
---
There is something very screwy going on with reddit on my pc, lol. Can't see messages and all comments error out
---
Nice comeback bud.
---
No.
---
Ikr, I always get scolded for thinking

There's no need to use clue boxes. Just use a BP and diary equipment and you'll prot the clue on death.

She's literally rejected suggestions from people who try to get her to copy RS3.

https://twitter.com/JagexGee/status/1133281148065517568
---
What if you aren't?
---
Yea the people spoke and a 2/3 majority said yes. A small minority of selfish people kept it from happening while most of the player base want it.
---
Why did they fucking change it how hard would it have been to leave it
---
Stop pressuring players to make them feel bad about not wanting specific content. Ergo, it's hard enough being a Ney sayer without you guys pressuring your fucking will against us. "Ugh, why can't they just say yes to everything, it is beneficial, we should make them give their reasons, and if we don't like it, then they should have to give better reasons, they don't even have to play it..."
---
Because it looks like ads and why the fuck did they do it. What if they start doing it to all the other chatheads?
---
Ok my question is that if your gear in the picture is fashion scape or if you were using it for some purpose?
---
Was there a roll back?
---
Probably didn't do X Marks the Spot
---
It really doesn‚Äôt even look bad.
---
Mod Lenny's development of the randomly generated rooms system actually paves the way for more similar content. Before that, we wouldn't have been able to pull anything like it off.
---
Only get xp when logged out
---
Could the Prif spirit tree be moved to C rather than 6 in the spirit tree teleport menu? Right now it messes up the pre-existing order of teleports.

"warding bad, stupid content!! Now let me stop ranting and make longbows for 8 hours in the same spot while looking at another screen"
---
What is love?
---
She said she wouldn't copy Eluned's old model because of its horrendous quality.  Her exact words were "I'm never going to shorten the arms, borf the face and screw up the boobs for ya. I can't bring myself to do it, it looks objectively bad and I would sooner quit"
---
Not everyone likes her art and I get that.  But don't go putting words in her mouth and acting like she actively hates old schools art.
---
None of the requirements are boostable.
---
Spoilers.
---
Yeah this is worse at least the Monk and other HD face models phit the game
---
Seren crystal meth. Not even once.
---
the reddit way is to reduce ad absurdum and then dismiss
---
Maybe try to read chat dialogues and actually follow given instructions, its all very well explained. Or if you dont want to figure puzzles for grandmaster quest urself wait 24h and look from guide.
---
Ahhh ok. I don't play anymore.
---
Considering every other quest uses he/she this one sticks out like a sore thumb, especially when it's used 3-4 times in a paragraph, the only people that actually talk like this are people who feel the need to put their pronouns in their twitter bio.
---
BUT MUH NOSTALGIA
---
Everyone needs to know that the most important thing for new players and player retention is a complete overhaul of tutorial Island
---
They look like more generic fantasy elves. The trend over time has been to make everything as generic as possible, because fuck uniqueness. And nevermind that the higher-poly models look terrible in this graphics engine. The low-poly models looked more natural to the game.
---
WACKY WAVING INFLATABLE ARM-FLAILING TUBE MAN! WACKY WAVING INFLATABLE ARM-FLAILING TUBE MAN!
---
I don't understand how people think this idea will get more support than warding did. Anything that would change the meta of runecrafting would be voted down hard.
---
I‚Äôm out of the loop can someone please explain the He meme
---
Wrong.
---
RS HD was a texture update, not a model update.
---
It's like they poached an artist from rs3 because all theirs were busy, aww
---
If the iron pick spawn made sense from a world building standpoint, sure, much like an anvil makes sense for dwarves to have...
---
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarding
---
Imagine complaining about 11 dollars but playing a game for hundreds of hours.
---
I voted yes because i'm having trouble finding the negative impact the skill would have on the game as a whole. Notice I say as a whole and not just the impact on people crying about not being able to wear their max capes anymore. At the same time, if nothing changes I still love osrs and won't stop playing lol
---
It comes from the crystal triskelion, not the key.
---
Sue btw
---
Looks like Jimmy Neutron's mom lmao https://i.imgur.com/PRZeg34.png
---
Same. Also I understand the opinion that a new skill would fundamentally alter the game from being old-school. I never liked summoning or dungeoneering and I'm happy they aren't a part of osrs.
---
People now crying about the 75% vote threshold crack me up lol.
---
They should keep the rare equitable drops from high lvl slayer monsters and bosses while nerfing the drops of runes, food, etc
---
that is not what happened here, the Revision update actually happened last week to prepare for this content update.
---
She got some DSLs
---
woox didnt do it, i knew there was solid reasoning i still havent.
---
yeah, it's like 100x worse than arceus and fossil island combined. The client straight up just drops to 0FPS every 5 minutes before chugging along then drops again, it's a horrible experience
---
Perfect gamer genes
---
Good dog
---
I would 100% be for adding summoning to the game. It is not just a bankstanding skill and the rewards for the skill were incredible.
---
One order of Pac Yak, please.
---
Inferno cape, the inferno, max capes, song of elves, anguish, new quests, scythe...
---
I posted for months about how mod G's graphics were going to look terrible, and for months I got bashed by white knights for no reason.  Samples have been on the table for your viewing for a long time.
---
Fucking loled thanks
---
Does anyone know where the crystal bow with the set effect will land in terms of dps? Even close to the BP?
---
That‚Äôs some bad photoshop.
---
Oh shit, an exception. You win forever.
---
Have you seen this sub?
---
Yeah I have 0 splitbark sets in my bank, wasnt expecting a pass. By all means ignore it and assume I have 2147m bark in my bank anyway. More fun for you to choose to believe that and circle jerk about people attempting to merch.
---
It's safe if it's from a jagex certified post. If you have any doubt go to the website because if the giveaway is legit it'll be on there
---
Shoving this shit into runecrafting is worse than making it its own skill imo, just put it in crafting and use maybe a new spellbook to enchant or add it to the regular spellbook
---
Yeah I was alright for a bit until the meeting part where they referred to me as they about 5 times within two dialogue boxes. It was clearly forced in. In no other elven quest do they refer to you like this.
---
Photoshop
---
If I say the name of the actual responsible party (Mod G) will I get downvoted by white knights as usual?
---
What's up with your UI? It looks so familiar.
---
Nothing like it.
---
They look great now imo.
---
*complains about people complaining *
---
willing to bet money that 25% of the people voting no didn't look at the skill.
---
If jagex wants to breathe life into the game with a new skill, it's going to have to be unpolled since the minority blocks change all the time.
---
If HD, then all the game must be HD immediately, not plop a single "HD" model inside a game that is not HD, it will look out of place, because it is out of place. 
---
Noone asked jagex to put an hd model inside an SD game.
---
100% Aside from Eleneeeer
---
Trio Elysian would like to have a word regarding pets.
---
The problem I see with GE is it has given Varrock an unbalanced utility over all other cities.  They need to scatter little GEs across the map
---
All look good to me
---
You don't have proof for that. There has never been a general poll asking if a new skill should even be added.
---
So you reading 5 comments on reddit saying they didnt read the blog and said no lets you make sweeping claims on how everybody who voted no didnt read the blog.  Fuck off
---
b
---
I literally didn't notice
---
Yeah I out DPS'd the healers at 99 range with BP (Addy Darts) and Eagle Eye (on task).
---
:O
---
Yeah pretty much what you said, bandos/Arma it's super easy to get your stuff back. Just watch your health and camp high up. I just brew over full hp Everytime they hit me lol.
---
You would have lost bank
---
Yeah of course you can, runescape recycling üëç
---
Although, a vial is worth about 3gp and you can buy them in packs or glass blow for exp. so most people just don‚Äôt care about the poor vials enough to keep them.
---
Shes a burn victim, you bastard
---
And the werewolf chat heads during one of the Morytania quest line, which is straight out of the chat-head refresh era.
---
My bad, my brains hurting from the other puzzles haha. Couldn't remember.
---
how exactly does it save time on a game where not a single quest has ever done this before?
---
I actually went onto the normal client thinking it was only optimised for the jagex client. Oh god the music just started to die
---
Youre stupid. So very very stupid.
---
Read the dev blog. Its obvoous you didnt. Then come back.
---
Fletching and yew bows should really be f2p. I honestly don't understand why p2p players hate giving crumbs to f2p players.
---
How come it's a wrong thread? It says "Have a question about the game?" and my comment is in the form of a question and my question concerns the game.
---
So 66.4% of the playerbase isn't represented. This sucks.
---
Its like 50k exp/hr.
---
Are you kidding me? Lots of people are saying were not getting new content + crying how everyone that voted no is somehow a neckbeard.
---
I thought the point of osrs was no updated graphics, eoc or mtx.
---
Did this neck beard really just call someone a simpleton lmfaoo
---
Bank will charge more for Bonds so king Lathas can‚Äôt afford membership anymore and is sent back to lumbridge
---
The new models are disgusting lmao looks like aliens with botoxfaces
---
Do u know what game ur playing this entire game looks like garbage. That's it's charm, the whole world is cohesive because it looks like the same garbage. Making higher poly models in OSRS makes it still look like garbage AND now it's out of place.
---
Why would anyone ever want dungeoneering if you have raids?
---
Taking a break from that 99 RC grind?
---
Really does look like jimmy neutron‚Äôs dad
---
To be fair despite whY people say there is a support system in place to get in contact with jagex rather than using Twitter. If he didn't try that then idk what they're supposed to do for him.
---
Yep, thank you, got that all 4 times lol
---
for example, I would rather have sailing, than warding.
---
Recharge your prayer and then you'll see the light
---
Actual brainlet man
---
U should try out rs3 if you prefer the new models
---
Was browsing ge tracker and a huge margin poped up.
---
Oh shit
---
Good Jimmy Neutron reference.
---
don't talk shit about my boy auguste. he's just different
---
99.9(repeating of course)% of people are in keldagrim for blast furnace lol. Never even seen the rest of the city
---
That neckbeard thing, it kinda ruins your whole argument and that of others. How is someone supposed to agree with you on warding when you're just going to resort to crappy insults. People that voted no for warding are among the same people that voted yes for warding, just regular people with their respective opinions.
---
It will happen. Y‚Äôall cry and cry about not having new content, players are literally leaving the game because everything has stagnated and yet maxed mains don‚Äôt want to lose their status because max cape is OP and they‚Äôre autistic about losing it. The game will die cause mouthbreathers are terrified of losing pixels.
---
I totally understand why you hold your opinion. I didn't particularly like warding, so idc that it didn't pass all that much. 
---
However, it is incredibly entitled and selfish to think that your opinion is worth more than everyone else who plays the game. Under the rules, you're totally allowed to vote how you did. I just think it's hella lame.
---
I felt warding had promise for your first category, with all the new mage armors and items, but to each their own I guess. I really like playing mages in games, but didn't feel like they were fully fleshed out enough in OSRS.
---
Crafting already has so much content. Ranged armor, jewelry, bowstring, pottery, and battlestaves all under one skill. RC has two things: making runes and infusing the Cerberus boots. 
---
If crafting magic armor ever came into the game it should be heavily tied to Runecrafting IMO. Crafting is oversaturated and is a buyable skill. Battlestaves are the only thing magic related in the skill and you just combine a stick from a charged orb which comes from glassblowing and a magic enchantment. This is fine how it is.
---
Runecrafting, although really profitable, is not very enjoyable to train and lacks the depth of content that crafting has. Regardless of your opinion on Warding I think we can agree that this game doesn't need another buyable skill, but magic gear deserves to come from somewhere other than stores and PvM drops. There were some great suggestions for magic gear that would put it in line with melee and range, price and stat-wise. 
---
I'm just spit-balling here, but I believe this game can benefit from some of the content in the Warding poll without having to deeply split the community over the addition of a new skill.

Apparently stating the facts of what they were doing is being upset. Btw your try hard trolling is pretty weak. Try again &lt;3
---
I trained dungeneering solo all the time
---
read the update blog
---
One of the pre required quests gives def xp. It's not actually required to have 5 def to complete, but in order to be able to to the quest you are given unavoidable def xp
---
Yea sorry I didn‚Äôt mean it as the definitive reason but I remember players being hyped over the 2006 private server and that was a big influence on Jagex to bring back the retro graphics. If the only save point was on 07 then I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt 08 or 09
---
Dungeoneering was more than just killing NPCs.
---
Idk why they don't just let maxed players keep their maxed capes and add a new max max cape for maxed Warders
---
No, fuck keeping things the same for the sake of keeping things the same. By your logic, they should just never update the game, and really, never should have updated the game at all. The game would be long dead if you were making the decisions.
---
&gt; dungeoneering 
---
available for everyone can be done solo without issue
---
&gt;raids
---
only for people with endgame stats and gear and with team
---
wow you wasted a lot of time on this!
---
I just turned off Runelite GPU and it works just fine. With the GPU it was super choppy
---
Disagreed 100% the game is evolving whether you like it or not. Character models will change and evolve. And the technology used to model back in 07 is outdated and a mess. I‚Äôm okay with these characters models bc old school is creating a new feel. I don‚Äôt need nostalgia to carry me I didn‚Äôt come back to this game to feel nostalgic but instead bc it is a good game. Which is why the game is finally taking off into the 100k at a time amount of players I feel like many people are forgetting that in 2014 after a year of old school the nostalgia started wearing off. If the game does not evolve it‚Äôll die off I promise you that.
---
Yes if you are ones of those people with 0 Thermy or Grotesque guardians kc because it's not efficient moneymaker like Vork
---
Unlocks more content for the restricted account, so therefore they can keep playing that restricted mode and making videos therefore more advertising for the game. I‚Äôd love to see turtle tales restricted Ironman series taken further with an anvil.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind DG, feels like it would have the best chance to be voted yes on. The community already knows what to expect from the skill and we can vote on changes to fix the weak points(chaotics, solo xp rates etc)
---
Imagine judging content before doing it. After watching streamers the puzzle looks enjoyable
---
It's 50/50, you either complete it or you don't.
---
Am I the only one who likes it? I think it looks way better.
---
Isn't he P2P and you're F2P?
---
Ah yes, people are always so happy after every election. It makes perfect sense for a game, when players can literally just move to another game if they're no longer satisfied. Especially in a game like RuneScape, where they're more than familiar with a large sum of the player base taking off.
---
wow.. so almost like zeah runecrafting?
---
The left one is way better
---
I didn‚Äôt see anyone on 2k worlds saying vote yes. These people have more resources to buy bonds and fuck up the polling. Id argue there were far more alts saying no then alts saying yes.
---
i think its mostly because of the lighting, a more realistic model looks terrible with the lighting because it doesnt show forms at all, also the eyes are all kinds of fucking weird. no idea why they would rework something like this.
---
Youre on a f2p world bro
---
All they'd have to do to make it work from the complaints I've seen is make it lean more towards being a skilling support and nerf the shit out of combat support, making it so that it doesn't even affect your combat level. I think there's a happy medium that can be achieved, but people get stuck on how it is in RS3. Meanwhile RS3 actually has some of the best damn updates as of late. Player Owned Farms, Invention, Dungeoneering, and Menophos have all been fucking top notch imo(I haven't messed around with Land Out of Time yet tbh).
---
Ngl I feel like no one said anything before because the mod who made this is a grill. Her style doesn‚Äôt suit the game atm, she needs to tone it down slightly but that takes more skill
---
Are you serious? He's member's only  now?
---
kinda sad that with all the content they just brought out, people wanna zero in on this altered face. You guys not want a day off?
---
Another thread, another reminder that the new characters look worse than shit.
---
the sniper guy?
---
That's why I voted yes. What's more Oldschool than a boring and convoluted skill? I did vote no to most of the additional questions, though.
---
Raids and DG are totally different experiences
---
tru for all content, so who gives a fuck if anything in the game is good, idiet.
---
...Far, far more people wanted new content. 
---
There were not "many" players who did not want new content, maybe maxbabies and nostalgia hipsters
---
Song of Elves passed with over 92% IIRC.
---
Did anyone complete it yet? Or close at least haha. At work and can‚Äôt watch anyone.
---
Redeem him for what?
---
It would be more afk, which could get people to do it
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Such a beautiful update, I hope they start updating other models too. :)
---
sucks tbh

Somebody left a rewu about the game on the app store (you know the avrege game is confusing players just kill you or something) and custemer support just said he

Prims will give you an offensive bonus, and suffering will give you some defense and the recoil effect is invaluable when solo bossing. 
---
Guardian boots are basically worthless.
---
I had a plan. making the first new high level robes that would sell for bank and going to mta for points to be able to buy a bunch of infinity silk right away and i have 140m stack and i flip so its growing faster and faster so i think i could get the first untrimmed. Not many people would be going for it and anyone without a 99 probably doesnt have the money to spend
---
ok maybe it was an over statement. you know what i mean. i like to get 100 avs, capes, shields every couple of months. i really dont want to only stock 5 shields and go back every couple days or stock a whole bank tab worth.
---
I think the problem here is all that time spent not gaining xp. Tasks like eating, while sadly required, can be completed while you gain more xp. :\^)
---
Although I will say I AM enjoying the quest so far. :)
---
He said he didn't try the puzzle since he didn't want to spoil himself
---
Its a mixture of maps from both games. I have the desk mat of this. Its quite nice
---
Really?  Gee had changed the art style from the original due to feedback and seemed extremely receptive.  Sounds like you either didn't try, or you weren't able to come up with anything better in the time frame.
---
I believe achievement diaries were never F2P.
---
Yeah, I never understood that. You're playing a 20 year old game, which has "OLD SCHOOL" in the fucking title.  But for some reason it's necessary to make all new content look "new", change the style randomly and make it an inconsistent mess of different styles.
---
Fuck HD.
---
Where did an f2p find an agressive dog?
---
That‚Äôs what happens when your game still runs on 1 cpu core.
---
If she used an rs3 style the chathead would look something like [this](https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Elena_chathead.png) 
---
Please god give us that instead of this failed plastic surgery.
---
Mod GeeGee
---
Yep, only difference between these two games is the graphics.
---
Cry more
---
Didn't quite see this one till now cause it didn't appear in my notifications but I'd just like to say this is the only argument I understand. While I dont quite agree, I can see the value of keeping it feeling distant for the quest.
---
I gave you the official concencis of Jagex, that THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the 3/4ths player base would have to agree for something to pass... It would be very dodgy for them to start making less and less players relevant in the say of things.
---
In the words of Mod Ash: "Them's the rules"
---
The ‚Äúpeople we forgot to ask‚Äù is Jesus there. The %33. Point being he‚Äôs someone with a strong opinion on a situation with no material interest in it.
---
So cute.
---
It looks ridiculous honestly. I don't see why it needed a change
---
stop using jokes you see on comments.
---
imagine if you read the update..
---
Absolutely agree. This is an abomination at best. Not only does it not fit the oldschool feel, it also doesn't even look good on a standalone basis. They keep messing with the graphics instead of keeping it oldschool and it's pissing me off. OSRS chatheads are iconic and shouldn't be messed with.
---
4 years playing on and off!
---
Keep us posted op
---
TirannwnOnly hype is my favorite hype
---
Feel free to ask me any questions. Been doin this for a bit.
---
:D
---
Yessir
---
Pretty sure you can only use black knife
---
Did you even read the news post before assuming you've been scammed by an update regarding the way crystal items work?
---
That‚Äôs not good lmao. That‚Äôs hideous, stop being a white knight
---
I think it looks good apart from the eyebrows and the eyes, theyre kinda creepy. Then again Im not sure how keeping the original style of character models eyes could be done whilst also being upped in quality without looking kind of creepy
---
Great point bro!
---
Meanwhile, runecrafting
---
Maths lesson, 99.9(recurring)% is actually equal to 100%.
---
Read the update notes.
---
&gt; Upon logging in, existing crystal items will be converted to a new system. This means that any crystal bows, shields and halberds in your bank will be converted to crystal weapon seeds, which can then be traded to Ilfeen for the relevant item back with its charges. Any nightmare zone points lost in the process will be refunded. All crystal items outside of the bank should convert naturally.
---
Lmao are you seriously gatekeeping this game to me right now? I played this since around 2006 my dude. I have put in my time. I want to sit back and relax and get max combat to boss, which I am currently doing while at work right now.
---
If they wanted to remove it, they could have. But things like NMZ are keeping people playing this game because they can realistically reach their goals in a more reasonable amount of time. That my friend is the opposite of killing this game.
---
nice and cool painting
---
The lore is satisfying so far, the idea of smacking down Ardy by force and beheading the king is neat. I just finished the light puzzles myself but am having a good time so far. It's certainly more of an actual quest you go on than many of Runescape's current quests so It's at the very least, a literal quest.
---
You might not like the chatheads, and somehow that's breaking literally the entire game for you but the models themselves are quite nice. Questing is one of Runescape's unique features, calling it shit doesn't do anybody any favors.
---
They've been saying that they're going to look into this issue for over a year now and I'm yet to see any real changes other than the occasional token gesture.
---
yeah i got this too, and the staff is traded like 3 times a day, kinda a shitty step. Also requires new quest
---
this he ish is already annoying af
---
&lt;3
---
When you log in, there is a message explaining it. Crystal items are reverted to a seed due to the update to them. You can talk to Ilfeen to have her reenchant it for free to the state it was in.
---
I mean changing those models was fucking stupid. But they never claimed this was integrity changes, as it's more than obviously not. The fact you're upvoted this much is pathetic. Atleast try to make sense if you're gonna meme.
---
Agreed. Arianwyn looks like Pamela fuckin' Anderson. Sry mod G but this shit mad wack
---
Did this neckbeard really just call someone else a neck beard lmfaoo
---
Nice, I admire the determination people have for this game, I don't think I'll ever reach a 99 lol
---
They are literally paid to do this shit. Do you always require a "Good boy, here's a head rub" at your place of work, just for doing your job?
---
Ah sorry boys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Go back and read the full message, not just the first half
---
Scraped everything to do with it.
---
It is crap, but in the context of a different game it might look good. I gotta go with Ozzy here. It's not bad, it just doesn't fit, the change is unnecessary and jarring and it is a distracting difference.
---
The lore is good I admit. But the new characters are a disaster. 2 weeks tops before they have to revert it.
---
Completely ruined the quest for me.
---
I‚Äôll give you credit this is well thought out, and much better put. I can meet you in the middle on most of this, but to answer your question imo it should be nothing. Continue creating content as they have, but leave the skills alone.
---
Your point is not clear enough for me to address.
---
Do you mean targets with only 1 item? In this case it wouldn't matter as items stolen would only come from the targets invetory.
---
If you meant thieves with only 1 item, I had already suggested a special skull preventing the  abuse of protect item prayer.
---
Not sure what other case you could be referring to that would make your point relevant.
---
thank you!!!!!
---
I doubt you joined the game after SOTE poll as a new player and got to crystal bow already.
---
So why ask the question everyone clearly knows the answer to?
---
More 1 hit mechanics xD
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
No it doesn‚Äôt cost anything to get your bow back. It‚Äôll be free for the same amount of weapons you. So if you had 1,  you get 1 free enchant. 10 for 10 and so on
---
thats not how inflation works. If you remove items, and the price rises. the gold hasnt increased in amount so the items are worth more. If the items stay the same but the gold surplus in the game increases then the items will increase due to a surplus of gold which is unhealthy. but it rising due to limited amount of items is a healthy increase and not ruining the integrity of the value of gold.
---
I genuinely think that you attribute people strawman arguments to make yourself outraged. Have a snickers.
---
Honestly that's a really good compromise, and I also wouldn't mind them polling the extra mage sets as drops or something. Warding has a lot of good content that doesn't necessarily have to be a brand new skill.
---
Hey what % does the poll need to pass?
---
M'lady
---
Give it a fucking rest already. Fucking echo chamber.
---
Well then I hope you're still a kid if it doesn't bother you. As that is something that could potentially have a major effect on your life.
---
Waiting for that sweet "hai, an welcome to my guide."
---
Thanks for the instant downvote, I see your opinion is all that matters...
---
wait until you see the walls of priff
---
M'laddy
---
no. Runcrafting is good as it is and should not be changed to devalue those who already leveled it.
---
Not to mention runcrafting ROBES makes no sense. about as dumb as an idea as combining mining and woodcutting into a single skill called "gathering"
---
I was up for more than 8 hours straight doing wilderness slayer on my alt and I was going to do like 2 more tasks and my second to last was black demons which is great in wildly. So, I got my inventory stacked and went to revenant caves. I didn't realize the whole way there that I brought my alt's full cash stack with me. I had a little over 5 mil in inventory. i get to black demons and setup cannon. I was good to afk (still didn't notice cash stack...). I look up after 1 to 2 minutes to restock cannonballs and I see Mr. Teleblock and Mr. Freeze. They strike me and I'm a sitting duck (still didnt notice cash stack). I quickly turn off my auto retaliete and guess what haooens next... I misclick. I fucking misclick Mr. Teleport who istrying to skull trick me and he is successful. I lose my slayer helm and whip (main valuables I had on). Get back to bank and go "ahh well atleast I can just buy everything back real quick". Open up bank and wowee I have 0 gold. Okeeee. That's when I literally said "OH COME ON". Fucking dirty pkers lol.
---
Dungeoneering was a minigame with delusions of grandeur. Leave it in the EoC era where it belongs.
---
They can't add it to RC because then regular RC training will be devalued.
---
&gt;Mate your argument is because new things exist in osrs no content can ever be criticized. 
---
Don't put words in my mouth.  
---
&gt;That's not an argument, that's nothing lol, and you've realized that and are trying to act as retarded as possible to compensate.  
---
This, coming from a guy whose argument consists of putting his shrunken dick pic on the G.E. Your 'points' don't even make sense, they're inconsistent and address separate things entirely everytime you open your mouth.  
---
&gt;I'm not gonna waste any more time I could be using to solve these puzzles on you. You sound like a bitter human being who looks to strawman people day and night, and the best course of action is to ignore you. 
---
Now comes my favorite part, the part where the ramblings of a defeated loser turn into petty attacks on one's character because he realises he's out of bullshit to spew.  
---
Let's be real, you're waiting for a guide because you're incapable of utilising that single braincell of yours to solve anything more complex than left-click Chop down Tree. Maybe if you spent less time projecting your insecurities you could actually get something done, yeah?
---
More like Pamela Anderson off the crack
---
Wtf, 2010 was 9 years ago?!
---
I always thought it would be cool for PVMers to need Skillers and vise versa.
---
Like instead of Bandos dropping a BCP, it drops like broken bandos armor and you need to take it to a smith to fix it but the Smith also needs the blueprints to make it so like the pvmer can sell the blue prints and the raw material to the smith and the smith can make it useful to everyone else. 
---
If you wanted to get really in depth too you could need the smith to add different types of bars to fix it and the higher the smithing level the less chance that they waste a bar to fix it or something
---
I get called a Nazi because of who I vote for.  You think I give a shit why someone votes?
---
I always love me some extremist statements in the graphics battles
---
What strawman argument am I making? I was responding to someone who said to rename Runecrafting...do you even know what a strawman argument is? Go ask your English teacher after recess, sport.
---
Do it yourself damn you lazy
---
People must still enjoy afk grinding, as an activity that requires less attention, lets you multi-task, and still progresses your character
---
It would easily bring back returning players. I stopped playing, but Warding would have made me come back (But so much for that). I stopped playing RS3 but came back when the mining and smithing rework came out. You'd be surprised how easy it is to secure returning players, especially when the content is easily accessible and not super late game (Like most new content)
---
Personally I would love that.
---
Needs pictures. I aint doing this shit without a video.
---
The fact that this post has 14 upvotes and no comments shows its a really good idea
---
Comments like this have me convinced that the majority of osrs players have aspergers
---
Wearing steel armour at the very beginning of the quest.. at least they didn't spring this surprise after the light puzzle
---
TIL the Jimmy Neutron theme was performed by Bowling for Soup.
---
Im a male and I find that offensive. It is fine as it is.
---
That's not a bad idea at all. Hopefully they address it at some point though. I'm sure they are more upset than anyone about the outcome of this poll.
---
In my case, it's because I care about the game and would like to see it continue to grow. And I acknowledge that this isn't my battle to fight. It's why I'm asking for input from those who do use alts. 
---
Hell, I'd have an iron Man on the side if I didn't have to have a burner email for it essentially. 
---
I just want to start the discussion. Because this feels like an important step to consider.
---
wHO Is eleVatOR pItch

Nope
---
I don‚Äôt know if ur fucking with me but yes
---
How to unlock 100% legit double XP for OSRS (no jebait): play twice as much.
---
nope.
---
The information on it is spread so thin amd varied, on top of it having banned plugins, I would stay away to be safe.
---
I support this. But unironically.
---
And you have to kill them before they tunnel away 3 times or the whole thing resets
---
I'm willing to bet I've been playing osrs/rs2 as long or longer than you have, and havent logged into rs3 besides to gawk at an update since eoc debuted.
---
I have an opinion and a vote on everything that happens on osrs, and nothing you will ever be able to do will change that. 
---
Basically, fuck yourself.
---
Np :) I'm aware that I paint a picture of me being a dick but it is kinda fun
---
Do you use RuneLite as a client? Do you play it in BootCamp (Windows)?
---
I can tell that your special attack is at 100, sorry bud but you're hacked.
---
92%? How is that half of the player base? Half would be 50%. Do you even math kid?
---
looking at the quest guide it looks like it'll be up in a few hours. 
---
Once thats there for the puzzle it should be pretty speedy.
---
Im with this guy tbh. Id rather this game die sooner so I can move on then to have hope for an evolving mmo that get shit on by ~%30 of the community that are trihards who care to much about their pixels rather than playing to enjoy the game.
---
They‚Äôve already said they aren‚Äôt doing rs HD.
---
I was poking fun of the fact that your comment was posted 6 times lol
---
blood rune crafting is chill af
---
RuneLite in macOS High Sierra.
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but new content = more options. More bosses to kill = more money makers, more places to train, combat and skilling. All that good stuff. It‚Äôs all optional and not a requirement.
---
But a skill is completely different. More time to max, more time to waste, more supplies gone down to the xp counter. It‚Äôs going to be a requirement for quests, and best in slot gear.
---
So to say people didn‚Äôt like it because it was boring is IMO false, the people who voted no, voted no because they don‚Äôt like change. 
---
(I voted yes btw)
---
What an ugly face. Don't Camelot the game. Ugh.
---
What's wrong with the face:
---
1. Inconsistent with all other faces.
---
2. Proportions are off.
---
3. Similar to Rs2/3 faces with less textures.
---
4. Made by grill who refuses to downgrade graphics because she thinks her art style is the only way forward.
---
Literally every elf in the entire game.
---
I saved the E for this comment
---
I thought u suggested it just for xp at first, so I wanted to makr sure u weren‚Äôt fucking around lmao.
---
It reaks of EoC
---
Big oof
---
Granted
---
can't tell if wooshed or not
---
Fuck yeah bro. Tell those scrubs to get 25 pray or QQ harder.
---
I wish
---
If they *really, really* want to update the game's graphics, it should be done all at once (as they did in 2008) or not at all. Updating the game by piecemeal makes it look horribly inconsistent and ruins the games aesthetic identity. 
---
If half the models look 2007, and the other half look 2019, the game as a whole comes off looking worse than it would if the entire thing looked 2007.
---
I don't personally think the game's graphics need to be "fixed". But if a OSHD update is something Jagex forsees in the long-term future of the game, it needs to be done all at once.
---
If your daily commute gets five minutes shorter but you still drive the same beater to work, sure you'll get there faster but you'll still want to neck yourself.
---
99/2=92. Do you even math kid?
---
They all had the same result
---
That is not how rng works
---
Old elves are fukken horrible, new models are better.
---
I think she looks fine, I don't get what all the fuss is about.
---
As often as people get hacked for some reason it's probably a bad idea to have all your characters on 1 account.
---
Who the hell cares? I mean, after quests you literally never talk to them again. Smh this community I swear
---
The zeah chat heads were honestly a lot worse than this
---
Probably because dwarves in oldschool just fucking suck. They're nonfunctioning alcoholics obsessed with low-level gear and their quests are too long and Jamflexy
---

Wtf happened to Iorwerth

He stated its a fact that thats how he imagines everyone who voted no... he dictates whether that statement is a fact, and hes telling you it is. YOU need to learn what facts are lol

Tbh the faces are the most important thing that needed work
---
technically yes it is
---
Keldagrim is also where you can brew kegs of beer which take time like farming but give a pretty nice profit!
---
It's perfectly safe to use, ignore all the sheep who think Runelite is the only 3rd party client allowed. You won't get hacked. And it's up to you to decide if you wanna use the "unethical" plugins. There are A LOT of qol plugins that rl+ has that rl doesn't, that don't question ethics. ie: supplies used tracker, filling rune ess pouches from bank with left click and many others

They've always had free speech, and to pretend otherwise is moronic. They just didn't have the mob power they have now to ruin any dissidents lives with Twitter doxing and "cancelling". Jokes don't ruin lives, but leftists do and will.
---
How people like you convince themselves that people being afraid to JOKE is a good thing is far beyond me. You people are so delusional and hysterical, you should be in an asylum.
---
They still have to get their max cape, and without it they wont feel superior to other players so they will still need to grind out the new skill. Trihard elitests is literally why we didnt get a new skill.
---
Why is it a mini game?
---
As an rs3 player I was pleasantly surprised with all the similarities.
---
It‚Äôs cool they kept it mostly consistent as far as clan leaders/specialities go so I won‚Äôt be ultra confused once my osrs Ironman gets there
---
I find that knowing where the teleporters is was most of the struggle, it's *fairly* straight forward once you know that and just work backwards from the seals.
---
Not true, "idc if you guys dislike it, I like it." and "I'd sooner quit than make it look worse" is not being extremely receptive.
---
The Double XP Weekend is only on Runescape, not Oldschool Runescape. Oldschool Runescape have no plans to do those events, don't trust anything which says otherwise!
---
So it would make the game more fun?
---
Remember that a lot of people didn't actually actively play Runescape back in the day, they play OSRS in order to experience what they missed out on experiencing when they were younger. They pretend to be veterans of classic Runescape but were actually in elementary/middle school when the game was in its prime and probably didn't ever even level a skill beyond 60 or 70.
---
There is a huge level of nostalgia for the game, but it isn't nostalgia for what they actually experience, it is just for what they *think* it was like based off how they idealized actual active and high level players. They didn't actually experience things like new skills or other content being added and playing them right when they came out, they just saw what was in the game at the time and did whatever they felt like. A completely valid way to play a game, especially at that age, but now a lot of them are trying to hold back the game from ever getting big updates like that because they don't understand that Runescape was good because of the quality and old school content coming into the game at the time, they just know that the updates that led to RS3 were bad because that is what they heard on reddit or twitter and use that to generalize all major updates like new skills as bad. 
---
The reality is that they *wish* they would have experienced Runescape when they were younger, and are using OSRS to relive those days as young children when they didn't have anything to worry about, and do what they wish they would have been able to do back then (ie play a ton of runescape) and then use it to hide from the fact that they are now adults with awful stressful lives they want to run/escape (hmmm...) from, and any change to the main structure of the game (such as a new skill) reminds them of the fact that the game is and always has been changing, just like their lives.
---
Not to say that everyone who votes no is like this, but if you read this and get irrationally angry about it, its probably because you don't want to admit you are one of them.

That's also not how droprate works

If you take a drop rate of 1/500 then each kill has a 1/500 chance to drop but you aren't guaranteed to get it at or within 500 kills lmao.

I'm on Mojave, that might be it, I guess.

Finally a use for the skill
---
All content must be watered down as hell to appeal to the 75% required majority. It's not that there will be no new content, it's that there will be no new interesting content to release outside of PvM
---
I'm guessing different durability left in each item
---
Make it untradeable since it's a cosmetic and people will flex that shit like it's castle wars armor.
---
There was something cool about other humanoid NPCs being essentially creatable player characters with slight model alterations and unobtainable gear, but I feel like the new redesign sort of misses that point.
---
I pay $11 a month only to speak to gnome child once a month to catch up.
---
I don't think you understood me right. They wouldn't be dead content in Warding, because there's a good reason to use it and make them. In runecrafting they would be dead because there would literally be no point in making them. Less xp and less gp per hour =&gt; no-one does them. If we went purely with the way you are thinking then all skills other than combats are dead content because pvming gives the most gold per hour, but they aren't. Why? Because people like to level other skills too, so basically "something to train". And all skills other than melees exist for the sake of there being skills.
---
neither does the crystal armor it looks like horse shit from a different game
---
ok ta
---
I don't try and play off that I know much, but if they moved rune down in levels couldn't they also reduce the xp it gives?
---
Anyone got an in-game model I can see? Someone please buy and upload for one upvote.
---
uh no it wasn't, there's a good reason oldschool was considered and  released shortly after eoc. People just can't stand many people if not the majority prefers pre-eoc.

He prioritises fun over efficiency. I'm sorry you can't understand a point this simple.

Go to Settings &gt; Energy Saver and turn off ‚Äòautomatic graphics switching.‚Äô This forces GPU use and got my FPS up from 15-25 to 30-50 on a 2015 MBP with a R370X
---
it's a devation from a 'lowkey, subtle' medieval fantasy vibe to a more 'grandiose, vibrant' fantasy medieval one. my words
---
I'd be fine with this honestly. It still looks crappy graphics, just crappy graphics done with actual artistic talent instead of what they had before. But a lot of the people that play this game are very fucking particular so good luck with that.
---
Probably a new cosmetic,
---
From priff
---
it was polled at 2007 because that was the earliest snapshot they had, if the earliest they had was from 08 or 09 then that would have been polled instead and that would be the game we would have today, it has nothing to do with players "liking" the older graphics style

What deal neckbeard it‚Äôs not your game

As in the unaltered version of this meme: it‚Äôs patently ridiculous but there are apparently people out there who think that‚Äôs how these things should work.
---
Big ups to you for staying positive throughout all of this. I can imagine you poured your heart and soul into Warding and to have a small chunk of the community be so toxic about everything to do with it would be hard for most to deal with. 
---
We're lucky to have you working on our game, keep up the good work dude.
---
Yes maybe even 1/4 rates. 65k/hr for rc is op imo.
---
Take my upvote made me chuckle
---
These replies got wooshed. Stay WüëÅke
---
I think that just looking at a mirror would do the trick
---
IM HERE TO TALK ABOUT TAXES
---
why cant you just make fun quests? do something interesting, why is it always tedious boring busy work? quests is boring and long btw.
---
Nice to see such a post get some positive attention, it's basically exactly what I've been saying also. 
---
Warding was 100% a Jagex-pushed initiative and they had no reason to expect it would do well, and every reason (given multiple feedback periods) to believe it was unlikely to pass. Such a shame so much dev time was lost (from Mod West too no less, whose content is consistently well received) to a project no one asked for.
---
Thanks for the reply. Ill deff use it 53+
---
Better than Goya, Picaso, Vel√°zquez or Dal√≠.
---
So you ostracize other people, because you dont like the direction of the game? I dont disagree on your point at all, but your methodology is both not going to work, and self centered, bud.
---
11 minutes thats it  haha
---
We pay we say üò§
---
A new skill failed to pass the poll.
---
I experience some lag spikes too, but not too bad.
---
I sort of agree, a lot of people are falling for a slippery slope argument but I am not against quality control and people voicing opinions. It's ok to not like something.
---
The wiki has done a pretty good job updating the quest and new information is available. Easy to follow in my opinion! I do love some Slayermusiq1 tho
---
Because I want warding to pass?
---
Love the fact they added more random elf items.
---
Idk, I like it
---
uhh thanks for the advice
---
My screen completley freeze for about 2 minutes each time i load a new area, its pretty bad.
---
That's not true. If they made new smithing methods that were better than blast furnace, I'd be legitimately sad.
---
Is Leffen actually the source of that? Never thought obscure Melee Hell memes would make their way to the actual game...
---
Vod is 8 hours long the quest didn't take him that long.
---
Who cares?
---
&gt;75 percent is a good number
---
75% is a funky number because it effectively means a little more than 1/4th of the community can shoot down content.
---
The problem with the 75% threshold when it comes to polling new skills is that the "No to new skills" group is sizable enough to act as a solid anchor to any No vote for a new skill, couple that with the "Not the skill I wanted, I vote No" people that easily makes up 25% of the community needed to shoot down any new skill.
---
Threshold for a new skill should realistically be around 67%, meaning at least 2/3rds of the community is needed for a skill to pass, but a low enough threshold that the "No to new skills"/"Not the skill I wanted" people don't have disproportionately more power.
---
I was wondering why I got through the pass during regicide with literally no issues. 40kg~
---
Edgeville, population: that guy
---
I skipped because I don't care what other people want to do. But theres no reason for me to vote yes.
---
Also they'd be a quest requirement sooner or later.
---
People wanted 2007 man. At the time that's what they wanted. Shortly after the release they realized that game was dry on content. After a few months people wanted a game closer to EOC which is when the updates started flooding in. The playerbase dropped to below 20k and shit got scary for a few months til some major updates started getting pumped out.
---
im stuck at "The Seal of Hefin" i restarted it like 10 times already cus the guide changes, i dont mind waiting, i just hate that they dont tell that the part is unfinished.
---
Id rather fuck the new one
---
Literally hasn't even been 12 hours since release... i cant tell if you're trolling or not.
---
I could see this sub being a thing..
---
**Ascent of Arceuus**. Look closely at the dead body... that's a rib cage.
---
SHE'S FUCKING STACKED BRO
---
NO WE NEED NEW MODELS AND DESIGNERS AND CONTENT. NO GOING BACK TO OLD CONTENT, THAT SHIT IS DEPRECATED AND BORING. 
---
THIS IS THE NEW HOTNESS.
---
in all seriousness, it's fucked jagex doesn't go back and fix the shitty content they released and rather just spend time on their latest one or work on new shit.
---
At least they actually actively fix the new shit before moving on. Fossil Island was nice. Kebos lowlands was nice. Trouble brewing? Fuck that shit. Splitbark? YOU VOTED NO TO WARDING SO THAT MEANS WE AINT DOING SHIT WITH THAT AND ITS UR FAULT. Tai Bwo Wannai? Lmao that's just for bots and quests. Fight pit? Oh you mean the not-fire cape content. Dorgesh what? What the fuck is that. Goblins? Lmao, who the fuck gives a shit about that garbage.
---
My suggestion would be to look at Artisan again since it is Slayer for skilling
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get what to put for ‚Äúthe next one you‚Äôll find is grown from the seed of a tomb‚Äù
---
Safer because you won't lose 46-48k on ranarr seeds if it dies and the profit is pretty much the same unless you manage to get lucky and pick over 8 ranarrs per patch. Plus toadflax is better xp (even tho its only a little bit).
---
lore was fun, quest was an absolute slog, tedious and boring. not fun enough to actually rush and do, id wait for a guide if your on the fence.
---
Fucking true. Scythe is well over a bill but it sure beats my spade when it comes to digging up treasure. I mean its vastly more expensive and theyre both tools amirite?
---
&gt; Just look at any dragon item (Longsword, halberd, scim) that is sold from shops. Most items trade for less than they're bought from shops.
---
They are all quite common on droptables
---
Jagex missed a huge opportunity. 
---
Ardy knight: ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù
---
Your character : ‚Äúhe‚Äù
---
I have no idea. Same reason I don't know why he would want to laugh at my slayer level. I'm also just playing this game to have fun.
---
I had eagle eye on the whole time, just fell the tiniest bit short in the DPS race at the finish. 
---
I definitely thought I had it when I saw my last do drop.
---
I DONT GET IT?
---
That makes you the worst type of person. I bet you get loud in a discussion too.
---
Bring back old demons then too!
---
Honestly it's the same graphics just being implemented by people with more artistic talent than we had before. I think it's totally fine honestly.
---
You mean the reason that 2006runescape had a huge hype, with like a few houndred thousands wanting to play and hype it up? Yeah.
---
No wonder people vote no to warding. You idiots would still play runescape aftet 2007 etc. amazing.
---
Combine a cosmetic shop with limited time only sales, and we could have both a huge gold sink and rares that appreciate in value.
---
Good, you fell for the ¬´get rich quick¬ª scheme
---
Truth!
---
Could you provide some context? They is perfectly acceptable in a lot of contexts all gender-talk aside.
---
Sugar Booger
---
Buy 3
---
While that helps increase the supply of the item to make it drop faster, it doesn't take away from the fact that the shop is not a floor on the item's price.
---
Omg
---
Well op kinda asks for it when he blocks out unnecessary stuff.
---
Oof, I felt that one. Cheers m8
---
HOW DARE THEY NOT HAVE IT COMPLETE CORRECTLY 100% WITHIN HOURS OF RELEASE! What am I supposed to think for myself?
---
I did it fine with the wiki guide. Try being smarter maybe. Or just wait till tomorrow.
---
You got it, boss.
---
As you age you don't have the time to dedicate to games that you once did so you have to pick and choose. After a big patch/update is the perfect time to get back into things and check out the new content, maybe subscribe for a month or two. I did that exact thing with WoW a few months ago and I probably would have with OSRS too if Warding passed.
---
QP
---
Literally came to comment the same thing
---
Less items = more value for said items
---
More items = less value for said items
---
Warding made less items = more value
---
What if congress did that one day
---
‚ÄúHey guys I know we need a majority of 2/3rds but honestly if 55% of us think this is a good act to pass, that‚Äôs already a majority anyways lol‚Äù
---
For polls on new skills, 75% is most likely never to happen.
---
Between the "No to new skill"/"Not the skill I wanted" crowd, that's a sizable chunk of the No vote right there.
---
Agreed
---
Did you read the blog? Warding wasn't going to be make level 40 mage armor at level 99.
---
Google search results are personalised, so is there something you want to tell us? :P
---
Actually I get more or less the same results, except it goes "bot", "clients", "gloves", "gold site".
---
Well it's immoral... Why send me an email saying buy 3 months membership for the price of 2.. so when i order 3 months I expect to pay 2 months price... 
---
Yeh sure maybe I should have got my calculator out and worked it out but I shouldn't have to.
---
This was during the Falador Massacre, which happened as a result of the first construction 99 house party. It was a big event
---
yah dude. I could play efficiently to get 10% more XP. Or I can AFK multiple accounts and get 200 to 300% more XP. Level an Ironman and a main AND make afk GP on an alt.
---
To me it‚Äôs the hairstyles. My character is limited to so many hairstyles, therefore all the NPCs are too. As far as I can remember that‚Äôs how it always was. They didn‚Äôt look ‚Äòelvish‚Äô but they looked old school runescape elvish. Now they look out of place.
---
Fair enough. I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre not a fan of justiciar as I thought that was one of my more toned down designs and it of course had the most community input. As for the lance, that was never going to please everyone and I was surprised when the twisted design won the straw poll, but it would hardly be fair to go back on it afterwards.
---
Art is always going to be subjective, but in the future I may try and keep my designs more medieval than high-fantasy but there is a limited amount of dull coloured items I can make before players complain. Either way, thanks for the feedback :)
---
What use is there in jagex sending out messages if you dont fucking read it.
---
There's guides out there on how to set healers up for jad so you don't take any damage from them. If you don't have a blowpipe I'd recommend that instead.
---
Oh yeah I know where it's from, just amazed that everyone in chat had pmod status
---
the real OG move is writing the guide as you do the quest. way more fun.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Getting 99 RC wasn't really "fun" but it sure as hell was rewarding. Also lmao at these babies who go "lol youre only better than me cause youre a loser who just plays all day!!1!"
---
Neckbeards unite! Harambe has blessed our cause! The only salt left for the casuals is the salt of their own tears! We did not sink to their level nor capitulate to their verbal abuse!
---
You realize that we polled lowering it to 70%, and it failed at 54%, right?
---
I see you Nicker
---
&gt; No GE clerks either, which I'm kinda sad about
---
I don't think you should be allowed opinions
---
This bothers me so much. There was nothing wrong with them before and to just change because it fits the new content they're making is NOT COOL MAN!  I honestly want to sit down with the dev that made these and have a long chat.
---
Its funny cause its true
---
Why wouldn't it pass poll? I think more craftable melee gear and new ores to fill out the higher smithing levels would have a good chance of passing if the gear was interesting and not OP (good power for level/effort, doesn't add power creep).
---
Jad really isn't that difficult lmao. There isn't anything inherently difficult to do like in inferno, most if not all deaths come from nerves. You miss 1 pray and it's over. Other than that you have quite a lot of time to react.
---
Too close for comfort?
---
That's more because the items you listed aren't shop exclusive items
---
Is there any objective benefit to changing the ART STYLE of an EXISTING CHARACTER? Also the fact that it doesn‚Äôt match any of the other chat heads in game at all? Every time they do this to chat heads for whatever reason people complain. In the zeah architects for example they literally went back and designed 5 new heads in the old style because they looked so out of place  to a ridiculous proportion. It screams change for changes sake. Would people rather  any time an extension for content is added the new content has a stark contrast in art style to the currently existing assets?
---
Hot take: this game could not possibly appeal less to the typical mobile audience, and they've almost entirely left the game. This is why Jagex are exploring how to streamline and improve the early game - mobile retention was abysmal.
---
From Oct 2018 (pre-mobile) to this month, the avg player count has 24% from 58k to 72k this month. It's up over 30% from this time 12 months ago. Game is fine.
---
Jagex literally said that any content added to the game would be polled, not sure what you‚Äôre going on about?
---
Lara Croft?!?!
---
My bad, I forgot unpopular opinion = lashing out
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
Whatever works man :D just sharing my opinion
---
Will a level 100 combat player be able to defeat the new quest boss?
---
let us know how much it sells for in ge
---
wait fuck
---
If you think osrs priff is literally rs3 priff you've got some serious mental issues
---
Dude probably had public chat set to ‚Äúhide‚Äù. AFAIK, player moderator/jagex moderator messages still show up in the chatbox regardless of your public chat settings.
---
Add a Kid to the mix...... 8 hours of work, 5 hours of chores, errands and getting to and from work, 5 hrs taking care of Kid, 6 hours of sleep and 0 hours of free time"
---
I‚Äôm not annoyed with the post, just annoyed with the title ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
yea, takes a long time for it to load and finally become playable for me
---
While it accelerates the effect, the underlying principle is the same. Supply is steadily increasing as people buy it from shops, demand decreases over time as the "new" factor wears off and other cosmetics are released. Prices drop when supply increases and demand decreases.
---
They do but the ya know, vocal minority
---
Thanks for your thoughtful reply, I do appreciate it, I'm looking forward to what's to come.
---
Make it 2 upvotes even
---
I love it. I now have an additional long term goal for the ironmeme.
---
I used that anvil for the quest
---
Ugh what the fuck are you doing Jagex
---
&gt; I mean, lower thresholds were voted on and failed..
---
Except the poll for that was ridiculous. In my book it practically never happened. That one really should have been a simple majority vote.    
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Jagex arbitrarily decided on OSRS's release to have a 75% threshold for **game updates** to pass, because they thought that was a good amount to get only the right content into the game.  
---
That doesn't explain why a poll to change the threshold itself should have to meet the same arbitrarily high threshold. It makes no fucking sense.   
---
**Imaginary scenario:**  
---
1. Jagex releases OSRS and decides that Polls will required a 95% threshold to pass to protect game integrity.  
---
2. 2 years pass and not a single actual update has ever passed a poll.  
---
3. Jagex realizes 95% is an absurd threshold and polls different options of lowering it.  
---
4. Jagex requires the same absurd threshold for their poll about lowering the threshold to pass, even though it itself is not actually a game-play update at all.  
---
5. 94% of people agree that the current threshold is absurd.  
---
6. Sorry, it didn't get 95% of the vote I guess we can't change it.
---
Bond with me Jimmy
---
Now that one is bad, I didn't see anything wrong with Elena.
---
You cant see the forest through the trees. Once you hit 77 rc you do all that stuff if you zeah runecraft and zeah rc is very much meta.
---
Unpopular opinion, this is fine.
---
I understand that I‚Äôm saying using the argument ‚Äúyou can make melee armour with smithing‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid argument since the armour you make with smithing is completely worthless. The gear from warding would have been stronger then ahrims so at best it‚Äôs disingenuous to say you can make armour with smithing and at worst it‚Äôs straight up bullshit reasoning.
---
Any update takes time away from other updates. This is not a real argument at all lmao.
---
Those are also drops though
---
Part of the job at the end of the day! I was once a 2007scape Redditor that was unimpressed by things being made for the game from time to time. even though I was a lurker and never posted I was definitely exposed to the criticism my work would one day be subject to :P
---
Thanks for the positive words :)
---
I'm gonna assume it went like this: "Yeah, this looks great." Then you look at it the next morning like, "Oh shit that's bad! Well, too late now."
---
You're not allowed to like things around these parts, you must receive blue arrows for this crime against the community.
---
Lodestone.
---
This sounds awesome. Would give variety to skilling and eliminate some of the grinding and staying in one location. You think it'd pass if it were polled today?
---
 **AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
She also lost her glass cutters
---
But the poll he's referring to, lowering the threshold to 70%, failed with only 54% yes. The community is nowhere close to agreed on lowering thresholds to 70% which wouldn't even have affected any of the 3 failed skills.
---
It‚Äôs worth it for account progression and for fun. For the money you‚Äôre better of pvming anyways.
---
What the actual fuck have they done. Fire this artist.
---
oh its a 3.1ghz bulldozer. isnt that worse than thr 8320? even a r5 2600 would perform much better in gaming.
---
250gp? Use commas bro.
---
I feel like some of the graphics team hasn't yet realized that less is more when it comes to RS2 styled graphics, and that they could be doing even less than they are now, especially when it comes to animations. I just want new monsters and NPCs that are graphically on-par with the Black Knight Titan again.
---
She actually looks better now though
---
Stay in school.
---
Youngllef. Damn these SoundCloud rapper names are getting out of hand.
---
As things all should be
---
I'd be quite pleased with that turnout
---
Rip all Elves... Gone but not forgotten ='(
---
Yeah it was just a joke worry not. Game probably peaked player count wise from mobile, not at all surprising. I have no idea if we'll ever see an active player count like that again, doubt we will. Game brings in a ton of money though so that's whatever.
---
Big eyes are cartoonish 
---
The detailed cheek bones are realistic. 
---
It looks bad but nowhere near as bad as new Elena
---
No but that is a near goal for me. Will I have issues with color?
---
The game is going to lose its ‚Äúold school‚Äù charm and just start to look like a cheap private sever if they continue with this trend..
---
its so mind numblingly boring, if it didnt have prif locked behind it this quest would be a hard pass. such shitty design. started off good, then gets tedious as shit 5 mins after
---
Both of these look better than before
---
I got a downvote to cancel at least one of you out and make you look like a filthy liar
---
Aggro all the healers, have them pile on you, run through Jad praying melee/as needed.
---
I like everything she made, especially Konar, and she is doing a great job. Hopefully in time you can understand not everyone hates 20 triangles instead of 10.
---
Even then you can't really compare the threshold percentage at 75% for game content to the electoral college.
---
Even with an electoral college win and a popular vote lose, most of the time it is damn near a 50-50 split, not 66-33 where a clear majority is shown.
---
If they put a GE in a high level area, I'd never go back to the varrock one. Imagine, a place where you need base 70s to get into. A place free of bots and spam.
---
unplayable
---
The fuck does that even mean
---
Reeeee
---
The best thing to do is all the quests. Look up the optimal quest order on the wiki and follow it. By the time you're done then the whole game will  be unlocked for you pretty much.
---
I think the people who need to watch a video where the creator forgets items like 50% of the time, rather than just read something are genuinely mentally challenged
---
is this actually in game right now?
---
if you're arguing based on the pedantic definition of "democracy vs republic" or whatever then sure thing dude but the EC is absolutely a democratic process. It's a severely outdated one that should be replaced but it's still ultimately decided by public vote. How those votes are counted is pretty stupid though
---
Noob question: What‚Äôs the point of the Helm of Neitiznot? Looking as BIS tables, it‚Äôs a mid-tier helm with stats below and/or matching that of a dragon med helm... Yet, I see it everywhere. What am I missing?
---
Pot calling the kettle black
---
It would be nice to have a GE without a constant "ADD OASDUHDFI FOR BETS GUARANTEED 100K EASY MONEY WINS" or whatever tf garbage they say in the GE, but I fear that people who have Prif unlocked could still be hacked and then have their account used for botting/spamming.
---
Imagine
---
Wtf
---
A max cash stack can buy you 8 of them.
---
Why would I use a quest guide, isn‚Äôt the point to have to play through them, and what do you mean unlock everything?
---
Is it caching? Did it ever become playable for you? I've tried walking everywhere in the library to let the cache download but it eats my memory, which is weird since I have 8 GB of RAM. Do you know if there is a memory leak perhaps?
---
Annoying whiny people is very satisfying.
---
I just hate how fucking big it all is...
---
The models in the new quest
---
I will try this thanks.
---

---
jesus christ is that Iorwerth? what the fuck lmfao
---
Why would you do that on purpose?
---
Gzzz :D Do you have the dialogues for the wiki?
---
Nah. She‚Äôs not my type personally
---
North of the hunter area is a small cave with a level 2 rabbit with an insane amount of HP. It hits over 37 through prayer and it's single combat
---
She looks higher than me
---
get lost you useless cow
---
Ah dios mios....... La goblina de Priffindas
---
I will forever defend sailing as a skill.
---
Based on what I've read so far, you seem like the kind of guy that wants to play ironman.
---
Tbh, if they want new players to take the game seriously, some graphics are going to need to change. The graphics are bad even by 2007 standards. The only reason not to is "BuT mY nOsTaLgIa"
---
RS3 genuinely looks amazing, I just cant understand how someone could argue against a graphical development, it's not even about the feel of the game because the game is totally different to what it used to be. I get that it could currently look out of place but the changes need to start somewhere.
---
This is why you dont hire homosexual furries and celebrate pride month
---
I would argue the same thing, but comparing adding a new skill to new areas/bosses/quests is comparing apples to oranges.
---
We private server now
---
You still don‚Äôt have the right to complain unless you are going to directly donate to these people to help them out. So fuck off.
---
What‚Äôs involved in Ironman?
---
I mean it kind of does, and this community embraces it. Constantly we say we'd have our low res 2007 graphics over rs3 shit
---
I mean I've stated multiple times that I don't have actual data to support my point, that my position is just based on my personal experience and a bit of logic, so if you really have to ask and still don't get what I'm saying I'm not sure what else I can respond
---
I don't remember voting for that haha
---
Where did I say thousand? Theres def thousands of people with over 1 bill tho...
---
Defeats the purpose, no?
---
bUy fIftY
---
It's the most old school skill polled yet because its crafting/fletching except for magic robes
---
I've also played that RSPS
---
bruv you're the most upset and enraged person here.
---
Ewwww who the fuck actually like this, I invite you to comment.
---
What is the world
---
Sparc finally lost it all?
---
Add it to the drama calendar
---
Lmao it's not even that bad
---
Hot damn, someone arrest this man for defamation
---
Bro he said void is always better.
---
And youre pretending there arent any problems with the updates we have had. Delusional and probably not someone who cares about the game.
---
Let me remind in case u dont know:
---
1. Death has no consequences on this game.
---
2. Theres no such thing as "resources" resources are meaningless in this game and are merely passives from doing whatever PvM boss you like more. Theres no resource gathering and theres no skilling for resources.
---
3. High private server feel (everything slapped into your house you might need, a pool that restores everything, every teleport in the world) 
---
4. Theres nothing more this game can do for weapons. The boundaries have been pushed. Oh, you gonna go a tier above BP, Scythe and Tbow? Its already more Dps than chaotics in RS2 lmfao.
---
5. Updates that make ironman easier every week
---
But yeah, game is perfect and its only getting more perfect! And these are just some of the problems, I could touch on much more.
---
Nice find
---
Quests unlock different areas, teleports, minigames, items, and spells.
---
These guys love their Monty Python references
---
Obviously, or he wouldn't be president. But then it's stupid to compare it to OSRS polling, which IS popular vote. It's just literally a different voting system.
---
Oh boy! Nothing more oldschool than some close minded bigotry!
---
How the fuck
---
This is the screenshot that started the "he" meme. You're a few days late to the show my friend.
---
Also, is the yield set after the first herb is picked? As in, if I have a staff equipped and start picking the herbs, go ‚ÄúOH FUCK‚Äù and then equip my secateurs to continue picking the rest of the herbs, do I still get a 10% herb yield increase for the remaining herbs?
---
Nightmare fuel
---
By the time I get off work Runelite will be working and there will be multiple quest guides up.
---
Cons: I miss out on all the potential game breaking glitches

Pros: I miss out on all the potential game breaking glitches

Strength bonus. Also prayer bonus but the strength bonus is the big thing.

Well I do pay runners 3m a hour, so I guess you could say I do play a part in spreading wealth.... you must be a liberal if you think giving lazy fucks free shit is a solution to get them to get their own shit themselves.

Ok thank you.

Please go find me the 50% of the time that Slayermusiq forgets an item. I can‚Äôt recall a single mistake that he made which caused me to go back for an item.
---
Is there some lore reason for Iorwerth being purple? Or is it just because he is "evil"?
---
I think there are multiple phases of "old-school" graphics. There's the release of rs2 (think Yanille or old Varrock), then there's the subtle upgrade to this (Falador), then you start feeling with higher fidelity (new Varrock, new demons, scorpions, etc. ), and then you get into the 2009 era, which is what you describe, plus the addition of HD graphics in 2010. 
---
Then comes along rs3 with high-detail, cartoony designs with airbrushed/painted textures. 
---
It seems to me that the OSRS developers are aiming for the 2009 aesthetic.
---
If you look which way the bottoms of his feet are pointing when he lifts up you can tell what to pray a lot sooner.
---
Did you just reply to your own comment
---
Agreed. All her art is over the top. It would be fine for other games, but for OSRS there is a specific art style.
---
Didst thou count to threeee??
---
Blood runes are super chill and give good money what is not to like about that?
---
The Helm, Body, and Legs are also all F2P items, so it is 100% cosmetic Rune armor
---
These days there's a thing called the "grand exchange," which is basically like an auction house from other MMOs. You can buy and sell any item to other players instantly by using it. Back in the day if you wanted a bucket of milk, it was faster to get it yourself than to hope somebody in Varrock or whatever just happened to be selling it. These days you just go to the GE and have it in 5 seconds.
---
Ironman prevents you from using the GE or trading with other players at all.
---
Right, because I said the game is perfect. Don't call someone delusional and then try to argue on a point they never made, lol.
---
Can still see your name at looting! Gz though and rip account.
---
&gt; This makes no sense because total level worlds are a thing
---
Fair enough- I feel like they should address that too somehow
---
Makes a difference in low resource areas or spammy areas like GE but I feel it doesn't really help much outside of that
---
Perhaps it's to make players feel closer to being the biggest fish in their pond without just having like 10 people in max inferno capes walking around in front of you when you just got your barrows gloves after many months?
---
[Except the other way around](https://imgur.com/8ghSXpM)
---
100 billion... You‚Äôre joking right?
---
When did they say that? If theres a plan to overhaul the graphics I'll probably quit tbh.
---
I remember the grand exchange, I liked it a lot, I could sell the stuff I made using crafting at the crafting guild there.

Other client is my main fishing some onyxes.

&gt;My only criticism is her eyes aren't white enough
---
all of the new chatheads have grey eyewhites for some reason, when the rest of the game's white colours are nearly always purewhite
---
I assume, taking the context of the post into account, that it was probably from donations. Either way, loved witnessing your unprovoked salt.
---
Because 30k is nothing and if u need it for a quest and have to pay 100k rather than go find out how to get it
---
Don't let yourself ever forget these abominations are HAND-CRAFTED AND CONSIDERED A SUCCESS by the current art-team. These PASSED someone's desk and that person is MAKING MONEY
---
Not max mains, but "No for new skill"/"Not the skill I wanted" probably make up a pretty sizable chunk of those that voted no.
---
OSHD was a texture overhaul.
---
New models =/= new textures
---
Neither does Mobile.  Theres too many assets in there and the game CONSTANTLY freezes and lags
---
It took that long for someone to complete it without a guide. Give it a few days for people to edit in optimal ways to complete the quest.
---
At this point we already knew the mourners were elves. This is just world building to keep the character in the entire quest line rather than throw him in just for the latest quest.
---
You people really have nothing else to do but complain about an elf in an online MMO?
---
Casual players usually don‚Äôt care either way. They probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice it, or either just say ¬´wow she looks different¬ª and then move on. Reddit is a minority, but I don‚Äôt think catering to, or at least listening to the opinion of your most dedicated players is a bad idea.
---
you'd be better off wandering around a parking lot looking for change then trying to grind out f2p for a bond.
---
Imagine if people used this argument for Minecraft. People don't only care about graphics (and osrs IS popular)
---
Mod REEEE

They've increase the compression lately. They've also had lots of ad hijacking as they've expanded their advertising over the years. They've taken in millions in venture capitalism that investors expect a return on. We've come along way from the site started by a redditor to host memes. It's probably only matter of time till it gets worse...

Well if the threshold was lowered to 2/3, then the warding poll would have probably been repolled in the future (as opposed to now where the idea is pretty much scrapped).

Would you rather fight 1 Jad sized goblin or 100 goblin sized Jads?

Who the fuck just casually has 250m cash stack in inventory.  I never even had over a 100m cash stack let alone 250.   If you can buy the crown you're probably too rich to where the price doesn't even matter

You have quite few typos in there. I found at least 3 versions of Divine-something as a name of the skill.

Sorry I called out your nostalgia trying to say that OSRS chat heads are somehow realistic and immersive.

Yes, put the magic gear in RC. Throw the channeling lamp and ward stuff in firemaking while we're at it. We don't need another buyable skill, but I want there to be some lore behind how magic gear is created

what were the seeds? i can see that theyre expensive so ranarr, snaps, or torstol but i dont know the current price so I hdont know...

1  jad sized goblin

They don‚Äôt have too.

Compared to the average of sub-55 turnout on even the most important elections in most democratic countries I think we'll never see some amount of people vote no matter what.

Is there any evidence that no voters used alts at a higher rate than yes voters?

Ranarr, and thats Yew seeds at the bottom.

You basically go BP all the way until you unlock Tbow. ACB only benfits on some places like sara gwd. there you use bp to spec/heal on minions after the boss is dead.

ur fault

And that was my point all along ?
---
Can someone Photoshop her ponytail and put it on top of her head to look like Jimmy's hair
---
No, I use all three of those and wouldn't play the game without them. I love RuneLite, and I love seeing updated graphics in OSRS. 
---
But people are complaining about changes to the 2007 version of how the game looks. Those three things were not in the 2007 version of the game.
---
Do they give any shards?
---
Its rune Crossbow and magic shortbow, then a dragon crossbow. The blowpipe is the best general use ranged weapon, the armadyle crossbow is not better than it except for specific locations. Then theres the twisted bow after everything else (though you would still use a blowpipe alongside it)

There are pkers of all levels tbh, so there is always some risk.  Under 20 or over 120 typically seem to be the most popular, but under 20 you risk getting dbow'd, especially without clans or groups protecting you

What about the cannon? That‚Äôs not consumable and it stays around 750k at all times.

Blowpipe for everything except dragons.

Should allow it to be put on top of a podium in your house

Seeing more 3rd age items come into the game makes me sick lol

Yes, but he's acting like no F-keys is amazing for Jad. I'm not saying it's easy if you're a beginner, just that jad without f-keys isn't some impressive pvm accomplishment, just a little more inconvenient.

Gz! What was your inventory/gear setup? I couldn‚Äôt get the boss lower than half before I ran out of food. Ironman so no brews but blood barrage and sharks weren‚Äôt enough. Did you use knives only for the clones and healers?

Yep. Crazy how many people dont know this and think it was meant to just be a pre-eoc server. 2006scape had over 200k members signed up for it before it was taken down. This showed jagex there was demand for an oldschool server, which they polled as a 2007 version of the game with no major updates. Thus why this subreddit is called 2007scape.  At the time we joked, "if they add the ge to the game next will come dclaws and a new skill." If only we had known how right we were. The server was created for people who wanted a 2007 version of the game, but was ultimately ruined by rs3 players who just wanted rs3 without eoc. Even tho they had already been given a legacy mode which is exactly that.  Now they try to rewrite history like this server was never meant to be a 2007 only server. Originally, we were hesitent to add pest control, godwars, and the ge because they were past the "cutoff date"- the date in 2007 that the backup was from. But ultimately we decided to add them because they were still in the year 2007. If only we had known the chain reaction that this would start. I kind of wish warding had passed so that we could accelerate the process of people quitting and us getting a new oldschool server. But I imagine history would just repeat itself again anyway.
---
You will probably have more difficulty at first, but it is still doable. When the "prayer orbs" come out, they are red green or blue, and are labled in the chatbox as dexterity, arcane, and aggression, as long as you can glance at the chatbox and pick out the important word, you'll be fine. But most people just look at the color of the text in the chat box. Also, if u want help learning raids, feel free to add me RSN Taiga239, and I highly recommend joining the "we do raids" discord server!
---
I like it as well. We'll get downvoted together, friend.

Downvote me

Sure if you're offering

Dear god

Hats off to the devs, just finished the quest, lore was fantastic, the final boss fight wasn't as hard as Galvek but had really interesting mechanics.

Prif is absolutely stunning.

Plz no dad

Toggle would be fantastic. I think I‚Äôd stick with OS graphics but having the option would be great.

One more thing, on the items kept on death interface when you click an item it shows gp given on death. Could you share what it says?

Considerably more awkward as someone who‚Äôs colourblind. That, combined with the way it doesn‚Äôt keep your inventory order the same for if you put it in order, makes it much more infuriating.
---
A better question though: is it enjoyable?
---
Was asking the sweaty neckbeard who brought up Barbies, but that's good to hear.
---
I think prayer off comes along with one of his mage/range attacks. It's not a separate thing. The whirlwind hitting you doesn't count - the *summoning* of the whirlwinds is what counts. 
---
Looks like you can use any style - halberd has good range for attack, so you can still hit. Its stab attack seems really strong/accurate. Tier 3 weapons all require the upgrade from their respective combat style demi-boss (bear/dark beast/dragon). Tier three armor just requires more crystals/materials for upgrade
---
Fucking niiiiiice.
---
NPCs that die are still in their original locations, like they weren't part of the quest at all.
---
I don't use an Android mobile so they don't have my location, but I do use GMail. I recently reviewed what data they had collected on me and it's kinda scary how they've been quietly scanning my inbox for years building a history of my receipts and bookings. I promptly cleared all of that and switched to another email provider.
---
Yea lemme just drop 37m on a stack of 5000 torstols that'll get me less profit than an hour at zulrah, or vork, or gorillas, or like anything past 75 slayer.
---
Forgot to sensor your tab'd serp. Doxed
---
Could you please elaborate on that?
---
There is no unknown transactions in the GE history. However, the rollbacked items are not in the GE history anymore.
---
From what I can see all valueable items are still there. Only the cashstack have been affected apart from the rollbacked items.
---
I very much doubt it would be a scam since not all the GP was affected, only the approx 17 mil.
---
Rs3
---
Why would they lower the threshold before they polled lowering it...?
---
The puzzles are fine, finding the locations of the seals to figure them out though.... That's not fine. They're so badly done, it's actually unreal. Has taken me longer to find some seals than to do the damn puzzle.

Used to do this with gf in ffxiv. Good times.

You're boned, there was a slight rollback for some accounts. Ash confirmed on Twitter
---
So he would be in the underground pass?
---
Every fruit tree has an inherent gold value, so you are wrong.
---
He was probably just buying all new items from the shops.
---
Thanks bro diary gonna be a breeze now
---
F
---
Someone said it's 150m
---
Alright then here's something real basic.  
---
Divide 1 by 3, you get 0.333...  
---
Multiply back by 3, you get 0.999...  
---
BUT for any x and y, (x/y)y = x*1 = x.  So 0.999.... = 1.
---
Necklace of passage to outpost is the next closest

the secret money make method... they knows now...
---
Bro what in the fuck
---
Lord Iowarth looks like fucking Genghis Khan. Revert back for goodness sake
---
looks like shit for 250m imo
---
Fuckin tell em fam.
---
Atleast this makes sense and was in RSC
---
And even back then there were always methods that were better than gathering rates. I've been playing for almost 15 years my dude. Gathering was just easy and semi decent gold. But it was never even close to the meta, even though tons of people did it. 
---
Who the fuck gathers maple logs? Log chopping is bad. Fishing sharks is bad. Go mess around with infernals or sacred eels, or fish anglers. Times change, and there is no reason to force maple logs, or even magic, into viability.

Did undergrund pass yesterday. 67 agility and failed once. Had full graceful
---
Perhaps, but everyone hates Runecrafting too, should that be put into magic?
---
And maybe put the Agility skill in Thieving too?
---
Or maybe we should get over the fact that every skill shouldn't include at least 3 other activities that feel like they could be their own thing.
---
If looking back at magic, that could really be split into combat, utility and enchanting skills to keep new additions to any magic branch from feeling like it's just bloating any skill. Then it would make perfect sense to put nmz imbues to the enchanting magic skill and dissolving to the utility magic skill.
---
Warding could then easily become Tailoring instead to give us a way to make magic armors.
---
This would hopefully finally help in killing off the sentiment that x proposed new skill could just go to the already existing y skill since y handles so much that x could fit right in.
---
More skill diversity shouldn't be something we fear, streamlining skills should.
---
Yes.
---
Technically you were. You get reduced xp rates for not full clearing the floor.
---
So at higher level dungeoneering, youd have to reset more often and sludge through the first floor.
---
Which gave painfully low xp.
---
So unless you were rocking base 95s or had a few freinds that had the skills you didnt have, the skill was a massive chore and barely worth doing.
---
I have, I have quest cape, and Glough is still in the Gnome Stronghold.
---
What you need to do is kill feral vampyres or use a Rod of Ivandis THEN a guthix balance potion on them. Having done both I would just go with feral vampires, because there is a 1/3 chance that method 2 turns them into a feral vampyre at full health, and the drops are worse.
---
Life of Brian is good. The others I didn‚Äôt enjoy so much. Each to their own.
---
you can do nmz as soon as you get the required monsters, your xp rates probably wont be the best but it‚Äôll still be more efficient than crabs i believe.

Nah its a nickname he got on his basketball team in high school, they started shortening his name to "Big D" and eventually expanded that to "Big Diesel" so it didn't sound like they were talking about his dick
---
I agree that we probably won‚Äôt ever get a new skill because the idea is just too dividing in the community but the fact people don‚Äôt align on every issue doesn‚Äôt make much of a point to me. I don‚Äôt think someone who says it is too game changing would agree that the skill is not making enough of an impact to warrant it as an addition. There were plenty of people who actually do want a new skill but they want it to be more engaging then an artisan buyable and there are others who will vote no to any new skill full stop, it doesn‚Äôt mean the first voters reasoning isn‚Äôt sound or that there are just no actual reasons to vote no in my opinion. 
---
Also thank you for acknowledging people have the right to vote whichever way they want to for whatever reason, I‚Äôve seen both sides make very toxic posts disavowing anyone‚Äôs reasoning for voting either way simply because they deemed the reasoning unjust.
---
Do you guys really think they look that bad?
---
I think they're alright honestly.
---
Reason why you cannot imbue crystal equipment because they no longer loses their stats as their degrades. So to be said, crystal bow, shield and halberd are always imbued.
---
There are white symbols on the walls of some of the buildings in lletya. After you touch enough symbols you will build a statue with 8 limestone bricks and spawn her.
---
It's within Lletya. Look out for her symbol. I won't spoil more.

not worth complaining about
---
One of my favorite things about reddit/the internet is stupid people with strong opinions about things they would struggle to know less about.
---
It alchs for half that.
---
Nah, it returns to its former glory after said fight scene. Atleast my palm tree did lol
---
item values are all in the cache, so no need to actually check in-game
---
By discontinueds, I meant that they would eventually be discontinued.
---
Why does this look so damn dopeee
---
Well that's just a dumb idea.
---
What's wrong with it?
---
i do not read the blog
---
Good point, but theres very few items that are tradeable, only sold by shops and not dropped, and not conusmable (ie cannon) I cant think of any others tbh.
---
Brilliant glitch! xD
---
It would be a lot less of them though, as is evident if you sit at the GE and hop up total level world's. 
---
Then hit a f2p world and see how bad it really is.
---
Would be better to remove NMZ all together instead, it's far too EasyScape with all that afk:ing.
---
50/50
---
Thanks! I had to scratch my head a lot to come up with these and I'm glad to see people like the final result.
---
You can polish the armour and wear it at 1 Def...
---
don't incourage them
---
Just with ranarrs you should be able to easily pay for a bond, assuming you do them a few times a day. I would recommend doing farming contracts too. If you don't do contracts, definitely add the farming guild patch. I'd also recommend to do limpwurts with your ranarrs. Its usually like an extra 30-40k per run, and takes basically no extra time.
---
You could work toward doing the troll quests to unlock the other two patches as well.
---
You could add Giant Seaweed to the end of your birdhouse runs, although they do take a decent bit of time.
---
You can also do hops runs, they're insanely profitable.
---
You probably already are doing this, but make sure you're using ultracompost for everything and wielding your magic secateurs. Plant anima seeds if you've got them.
---
Getting away from farming...
---
No a short-term thing, but getting your slayer up is always really smart if you want long term money potential. Once you start getting around 70 slayer, you start unlocking monsters that are great money. Kurasks (70), Wyverns (72), Gargoyles (75), Nechreayls (80), all of ridiculously good drop tables and are easy to kill.
---
I wonder if anyone has, I could totally see it happening
---
quide
---
Prologue: this is long and gets off topic but I had a bunch of thoughts i wanted to share. TLDR the game needs work.
---
My thoughts are more towards Jagex doesn't want to upset any of the current players by reworking the skills. I mean we see how much friction was caused in the player base by the warding skill, if Jagex tried a poll where they said   
---
"hey smithing is broke, how about we push full rune down to around 50, add in dragon armor, and maybe one or two new sets that are more on par with the best in slot armors which could also improve the mining skill?"   
---
I guarantee the community would be divided again. Some people would think it's awesome and a good way to fix the skill and bring back value to them. Others wouldn't want it because they had to grind for rune so why should new players get it that easy. Other players would hate it for lowering the value of drops like dragon armor and weapons. Not to mention the slew of other arguments to be made And then if it even made it to poll it would more than likely not clear the 75% mountain required for passing.
---
I don't blame the player base for not agreeing and I don't blame Jagex for the game's current state. I believe it's a combination of many things, osrs wasn't really designed for the future so it has struggled to balance updates and new content with the already underlying system. Even though it was with good intentions allowing the player base to vote in a poll system at 75% severely limited any future growth for the game.
---
At this point I think the only way for the game to fix the giant flaws in its design is to either **A** revoke the polling system entirely and gauge the players interest through surveys but still give developers creative control over the game's direction or **B** change the polling pass/fail condition to strictly number of votes.
---
I made a post here regarding a pretty big bug with the final boss.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/chtki9/song_of_the_elves_final_boss_fight_targeting_bug/?
---
All crystal items went to seeds because of changes.
---
Because it's 250m
---
Probably somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6 of the item value, as is usually the case with shops. If I had to guess I'd say this shop has a buyback of 0.6
---
Hacked maybe?
---
This is what happens when you vote no
---
This is the dumbest retort. Why did people leave RS3? MTX, EOC, lots of bad updates.
---
So why the fuck would good graphics be the reason to go over there?
---
We already know why.
---
People refused to read the Dev Blog, and relied on Memes to get their information.
---
And the statement "Game will die in a year" is disingenuous.
---
The fact of that is, No voters stated that the games integrity was at stake, Yes voters stated the game has already far changed from what OSRS used to be, and the continued development of the game is required for the game to survive.
---
Yeah you have to complete the new quest to do the Gauntlet. The good news is 55-70 herblore is only a few hours, although it'll be pretty expensive. Haven't done any of the content yet so can't speak to that.
---
Lol profit
---
I wish they did this for the "rare" holiday items instead of what they ended up doing.
---
I was wondering who was updating the steps as I spammed refresh for corrections, big upz
---
yeah this is just shitpicking at this point.  Gotta get those 100 points.
---
It is art style. It is deliberate
---
That‚Äôs kinda bullshit wtf. I lost like 2m.
---
Yeah this is true. I am just hoping he will have time to redo them at some point.
---
The size of zeah was never changed. Only the pathing.
---
He said shops don‚Äôt provide a floor and the points you‚Äôve provided here support his statement. They sell for less than the shop price.
---
Yeah, initially, I was with you on all of that.  When I started playing osrs, the thought of getting 99 in anything was a pipe dream.
---
Then achievement diaries came out, and I saw reqs like 91 rc and just assumed I'd never get it.  But I started chipping away at some of the easier ones and those higher goals started seeming more achievable.
---
So essentially, just set small, obtainable, and useful goals that you can slowly chip away at over time.
---
For 99's specifically, the skillcape perks were big for me.  Like farming is great for herb runs, crafting is a super useful bank tele, stuff like that.
---
And then once you have several 99s, they don't seem so scary anymore, and getting the max cape is just so damn useful so grinding the meaningless one's seems worth it.
---
What a man
---
Should we poll which brand of toilet paper Joofblex uses to wipe?
---
What is the examine message?
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs is a muscle relaxant liquid that gays uses to looses there ass ‚Äúnot joking‚Äù
---
75%, but then there a bunch of assholes with 10+ accounts who all vote no, which is ballot stuffing, which doesnt adequately show real poll results when Person A has 10 votes and person B has 1.  Its not a very fair system, and jagex needs to do SOMETHING about it. i dont know what, but SOMETHING.
---
Facial recognition software is becoming problematic
---
Huge gold sink. Hope it's not tradeable.
---
Love it
---
I don't mind them on task if you've got a dragonbane weapon. They're nothing crazy, but they're solid and AFK.
---
Bitch look like Lana Rhodes POST-operation
---
If you've done Roving Elves then there is an Elf who can convert the seeds in Lletya
---
I was helping edit some small stuff as I followed along and added some other small details after the puzzles too. I just wanna say that most of the people writing stuff for the wiki are good people. However, there was some assclown (maybe two of them) who edited the puzzle section with something along the lines of ‚Äúyou got some of the directions wrong like East and west. Check that you‚Äôre correct before rushing to have the first guide.‚Äù If that asshole reads this comment by chance, know that 1) the directions given were not incorrect, you‚Äôre probably just incapable of following simple instructions and 2) people create these guides free of charge because they enjoy helping the community. Being an asshole to people making hard content easy seems like a very poor choice. Luckily the wiki admins deleted that asshole comment pretty quickly and I hope they banned that person from editing.
---
Do you have a link to the chathead part?
---
Let her do what she wants you fucking incels. She obviously has the right idea in mind for the game 
---
/S
---
Thanks tor the suggestion but this post was about lore
---
Oi m8, sorta unrelated question, I found these colourblind filters on my phone, and do they actually work :p
---
True. But I am excited to train slayer as fast as possible with max combat!
---
if the lot of us that started in elementary school way back when could figure it out, some special snowflake mobile player can as well.
---
I only used the artisan classification on a skill that is used to create items rather than what is referred to as a gathering skill such as woodcutting and fishing. I understand your point as you need mining to obtain ores to make rune platebodies or whatever else but I‚Äôd also like to point out there is almost no other use for mining to exist other then to give resources for smithing, they were clearly designed in unison of each other, the same can simply not be said for hunter and warding because hunter has a myriad of uses that exist such as providing the best ranging ammunition for training, providing new unique weapons in the form of salamanders ( I know they are mostly ignored but it wasn‚Äôt always that way). I‚Äôm just trying to say people make the point that hunter has no point when it clearly does, and the fact that those items come from npc drops which arbitrarily use smithing to create them when they have proven they could easily make any other arbitrary way of coming into the game (look at bludgeon and brimstone ring, they work similar to godswords but require no extra skills or requirements to put together). There are other reasons to kill monsters besides items to use for smithing, the same really can‚Äôt be said about mining.
---
Cause it has 2019 graphics seeing it is the modern iteration of RS, not what we're playing
---
Where was this in the stream or blog?
---
scp has breched containment!
---
There's nothing to fix they changed how crystal items work and all crystal items degraded.
---
Maybe one day they will get good :(
---
Not if u live in a 3rd world country tho
---
That's what I did after the 4th seal, God damn i salute those who mapped this thing out for us.
---
new pr and gr I believe
---
It was in the update notes fam, for SOTE.
---
What do I do with the crystal weapon seeds that appeared in my bank. I've just done SotE
---
incredible how something new being released suddenly destroys your ability to do anything else you were doing prior to it.
---
At least for me, its not that they look bad, it's just that it doesn't fit the OSRS art style at all.
---
&gt; One of the main reasons a huge portion of players starting ditching RS3 in the first place was the graphical updates.
---
This is one of those narratives this subreddit outright made up. I can't name a single friend who played back in the day who quit because of graphical updates. Those were a drop in the pond compared to all the other bullshit.
---
The graphics are not why people play OSRS, people play in spite of the shit graphics
---
Oh well they said this would happen.
---
holy shit, have you tried any more chests? what else u get?
---
How far up does your jaw go?
---
&gt;Literally 10 seconds to implement
---
You clearly don't understand software development testing lol.
---
Even if they used pre-made assets, there would still be many many hours of work, and many more of testing.
---
People rather write a rant, instead of reading the blog that came with the release unfortunately.
---
Anal?
---
Aren't they like 2 feet shorter and lacking the glowing eyes?
---
Okay you try those out and let me know how they go
---
is that why everyone looked so bad i didnt realize they changed it
---
I think Shaq also used that as a nickname for himself lol
---
You're not solving the problem with smithing though. Sure we can fill up 40-99 with putting together the pieces of current PvM drops already in the game but that isn't actually adding smithing content. Nobody considers DFS, Dsq, D kite, D plate, etc. as the body of smithing and you can't train with it either. Nobody is smithing DFSs to 99 smithing or for money just like nobody is going to be smithing high level pvp drops together for exp or money if they change it.
---
Blessing spirit shields isn't actual prayer content, making cerb boots isn't RC content, and smithing bandos chestplates wouldn't be smithing content. You need bars/tiers that people can train with all the way to 99 smithing or else there is like zero actual content to the skill and OSRS is nowhere near needing sets of smithable armour above rune.
---
Nope, just British
---
Its not charged
---
Absolutely. For what its worth.. the content and design teams in my opinion are worth their weight in gold.
---
How come? isnt the goal just to be at 1 hp?
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm a silly American
---
Riding skill when?
---
Nobody's trying to force a new skill, I don't know why people keep using that term. If there was any forcing going on they wouldn't bother with the poll now would they???
---
My point was that the minority has much more power than the majority based on the 75% minimum, even more so because of alts. One may sayer with a couple alts has the same power as several yay sayers with alts
---
I'm currently on a hydra task and have a total kc of 624 and my loot (uniques) so far are:
---
1 Brim ring (finally got the last piece for the ring at kc 603), 0 claws, 3 tails, 0 leather (a lil salty that I have 3 tails and no leather when they are the same drop rate but the tail is trash money), 0 knives, 0 axes, and pet at 424 kc
---
You can't trade them on the GE so it's hard to get a lot of them.
---
It depends what monsters you have in the dream
---
Why white knight?
---
I prefer the original but will GLADLY take the middle-ground model over this Area 51 escapee.
---
I don't get why they even change the chatheads of existing characters, especially when those characters just use the base human model so they really should just use the regular human chathead for consistency
---
I wonder if he knows how well known he is even though the last time anyone heard of him was 2010 lmao
---
lol bro chill out, there is sufficient evidence to think this is a GoT reference. They sneak a ton of pop culture references in this game.
---
Looks like we're in RS3
---
Why lvl1 wildy!?
---
so true, there's probably like 3 guys for every girl on tinder willing to fuck, why you gotta meet girls irl
---
Well then lucky me.
---
Why spend all this time changing the models? I'd prefer a new skill.
---
Cant wear the construction thing so people have less incentive to get it.
---
It's really not sufficient but okay.
---
God Ash's balls are mine.
---
Oh shit I know that guy
---
You essentially explained tungsten rings at jewelry shops.
---
Lmao so because I like playing the game differently than you is toxic and the reason warding failed. ok.
---
&gt; So youre saying people who didnt want the skill that voted no didnt want the skill sonthey voted no?
---
I mean it's not hard to look around on this sub and spot people that didn't want another skill to train for various reasons. Same with people saying they would have voted yes to another skill but no to Warding.
---
&gt;Im going to assume you mean people who voted for arbitrary reasons or reasons you dont think are valid.
---
Never said they were invalid opinions, everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if I don't necessarily agree with it.
---
&gt;There is no tangible way to see who voted what and for what reason people troll people lie and most of all reddit is a very small sample size see the 14k poll we had vs the 140k in game
---
Even so, it is not hard to kind of gauge at least what some of the major talking points for a no vote were. While different, they do have some commonalities.
---
&gt;they are voting no for reasons you deem dumb dosent mean it really happened its the internet take it with a grain of salt.
---
Again, never deemed it dumb.
---
Song of the Elves: Part II
---
Where we bring the a real plague and fix the chatheads.
---
The dice game bots rarely let people win..
---
same thing happened to me, I only go to the elf area to do farm runs and something just felt gross right when I teleported. I didnt think much of it until I paid the fruit tree patch lmao. People are downvoting my post though, so it appears this is a wanted change.
---
Recomend some good fantasy books for a fellow 3 hr commuter?
---
People miss this because they panic, that's going to happen. Just gotta remember: you've beaten harder bosses in other games, just have patience and pay attention! Focus on prayer, and surviving over damage. You will eventually kill him.
---
I mean you're putting words in thousands of people's mouths so ok
---
How in the actual fuck do any of you think that the left side looks better?
---
That close would have warranted a repoll though
---
Needs to be charged for stats to appear
---
Yea but you still fixed her bad bangs so they couldn‚Äôt even get that right.

Its crystal grail. New item from easter egg boss.

Isn't that wild? This worked as well as it did and knives are better.

Upvoting to act like i did the quest and remember that part

---
You made my day today. Got frustrated by the third seal and took a nap to wake up to the entire guide being completed by you.
---
PS. I love Jagex and their easter eggs
---
You mean max combat 60 slayer simulator?
---
Take mammoths for example lol
---
I never thought id see the day that we got new, big enough content to need spoilers
---
So are you one of those trolls I have to pay to cross the bridge, or can I just pull a Midwestern and just sneak past ya here?
---
Its a rabbit so it'll make you hop
---
It needed more shadows stabbing you and closing the interface.
---
That's not what Mod Ash said.
---
Hell yeah. Heck, even a rune pickaxe would be dope.
---
Ice barrage
---
Not tried corrupted but unless the mechanics are different you can count the attacks to know when to switch. It's 4 attacks then it changes styles, at least in normal mode.
---
i know just pointing out the error in nmz store
---
It‚Äôs an art style. Do you think cuphead artists have no talent because they employed a 1930s cartoon aesthetic? Or all the indie 8 bit games that have come out?
---
Tridents have a built in spell that is charged with runes.  They attack faster than normal spells so have pretty good dps
---
Tfw no big gritty hoof gf
---
I just talked to Mawrth in Lletya and it worked fine.
---
I think it's funny that so many people are freaking out over it, but then they'll change it back and 90% of the community will go back to holding down space bar to rush through chats and barely paying attention to the chat heads ever as they fly through quests.
---
So what, slayer drops and alchables? 11m a week still seems like a lot if you're playing part time and afking that.
---
Is it tradeable?
---
These new models look like guitar hero 2 characters
---
3Head dunnit m8
---
What happens to someone‚Äôs cash stack when they drop it and no one picks it up ?
---
It really doesn't make sense though.  If you enjoy the game enough to max, why would you not want something that's useful?
---
And how is it even overpowered in it's current state? It basically saves you 22 bank spaces or acts as a cosmetic upgrade to the current bis capes.
---
Took me a minute to get it then I died
---
Item not gold, big difference
---
What part of ‚Äúit takes away from the feeling‚Äù do you not understand? I literally just mean that it decreases the feeling of needing to wear specific gear when there is a piece of versatile, all-around, gear available. Obviously your slayer level itself has meaning.
---
I don't understand she looks much better now?
---
Right after sailing
---
You spelt journey wrong
---
Well whyd you buy it
---
I like the void part. Anybody get back into osrs after a break when you have a shitty breakup? or does anybody feel like wasting xp after a shitty breakup? I'm going with the latter at the moment.
---
There are more mechanically skilled players tbf, but woox is the most innovative and usually paves the way for others.
---
What a novel opinion that nobody on this sub has articulated yet.
---
cant buy one for 100m
---
they really tried to give him green eyes lmao they're all so bad..
---
Xp rates are minimal, it is not intended to be a training method
---
&gt;weds on de top yuw dumb cunt uwu

 tag me to uwuize comments uwu

Maybe it's common knowledge because you have problems but I'm doing fine, thanks for the concern lol
---
how do people obtain it?
---
I could of sworn we polled no more of that discontinued item stuff like the party hats in Rs2

What do you do when someone logs in at your spot and drops cannon
---
Woh those pecs
---
Groups are fun. Massive groups are just overkill.
---
Started off doing the boss with 2 other people and having fairly quick runs.
---
Later on there was about 20 people in there and it basically a race to get 4 rocks before throwing them and getting the kill.
---
Needs some better hp scaling I reckon
---
Youll probs get like 30 ranged xp probs
---
How did it go?
---
yes
---
That's the worst part about it haha
---
Rabbit in a cave north of prif. It currently looks like there is one rabbit per world per day. That hasn't been confirmed, but currently no rabbits have respawned that I'm aware of.
---
But but but it's called RUNEcrafting
---
So I've already attempted the fight, so now you can't go downstairs
---
Absolutely, because I enjoy streaming and making videos
---
The only paper bag you'll need is the one to carry your tattered clothes home after she rips them off after the two of you get after it!

I mean, you didn't ask. I'm not picking a side though, Ima ask him for some links.

A fool and his money are soon parted

best scenario is revert to original
---
the crystal grail alches for 18k.
---
Easy as long as you pay attention.
---
Mistepping or failing to pay attention will get you slapped for your full life bar in a matter of seconds.
---
which quest is this? i know fremmy isles has a line like this but im pretty sure thats not this one
---
Read the game update
---
Links? If you're right, I'm genuinely curious.
---
General Graardor ain't too bad
---
I think you got appropriate "credit" and can make new ones for free. (As many as you had)
---
Slayermusiq quest guides on youtube

by this point in the quest line you know they're elves though, this isnt a spoiler

god bless you :*

They expanded farming eitb the farming guild

There's also redwoods u can plant and a battle staff tree

Try turning GPU off if you use that setting in runelite, Turn low detail mode on in runelite if you use it, Turn off all sounds(this is the one that let me do the puzzle w/o lagging)

Stop spreading false bs when you have no way to know this
---
Ok
---
I know a guy who wants the mail if you dye it orange.
---
Glad we helped :)
---
Tbh I've only failed 1 time on these obstacles in the 5 times I've done the quest
---
Definitely an unpopular opinion and please don‚Äôt hurt me for saying... as it‚Äôs old school for a reason but I rather like the upgraded head models. All of them.

idk about that. its on the collection log. dont think they would put something on there that you can never get again

that was fast from 30m :/

Thank you

It's very likely to be either a daily thing or a weekly thing when the servers reset.

Wait that was real? I saw it after the meme had already started and it was so ridiculous I just assumed it had to have been shopped.

100% agree. Not a fan of the unique model.

---
LOL you guys always have something to complain about. Please shut the fuck up and play the damn game. This doesn't affect how you play the game
---
Okay, so it's not just me who thought she had huge tits.
---
Yeah but he is still the head and should be wearing a bit of uniform there. Just to stay undercover or something for if he leaves the mourner base.
---
Damn so the models really gonna look like mashed potatoes from now on?
---
Okay awesome. Was just kinda panicking
---
but... he doesnt leave the base. he's probably in charge of driving the slaves in the tunnels or something
---
Pretty sure we voted for this change? Or was it just a Twitter poll?
---
Thanks for letting me snipe a few for under 10m guys
---
Thanks. Just had a moment of slight panic
---
Im 99 all combat stats i just really hate questing in runescape and skills that require you to stand at a bank :D haha
---
This is being posted every 10 minutes. Literally. 
---
Would be grand if people either A) proofread a few posts down before they post or B) read the actual patch notes. Least you aren't getting butthurt and defensive over it
---
Asking the real questions.
---
[hmmm](https://i.imgur.com/VTcgqLa.jpg)
---
yes they are
---
Hahah that's too kind! 
---
I'll barely have time to even hit it tonight I've just gotten home from work and have to be up in 7 hours to do it all again...
---
I would feel like a jerk having people come together just to leave!
---
Yes definitely. https://i.imgur.com/9db7evc.png
---
I wish mods would just add whatever reddit gets a boner for so I don't have to be full of despair everytime a new skill fails.
---
DEaD gAMe BtW
---
The wiki should be basically done by now and good enough, did it a few hours ago and there was very little information missing.
---
It's like original slayer but this time the task counts are ***quadrupled!!!*** And not only are monsters assigned but so is your weapon...***UNARMED COMBAT ONLY!!*** Become the renowned martial arts master you've always dreamed of! After every 1000 completed task you'll be assigned to kill the slayer 2 boss ***SUMMA MAXUMUS THE PRIMORDIAL TITAN GIANT OF WARRRR!!*** Which has a 1 in 1,000,000,000 chance of dropping the Primordial Titan Claymore of Maximum Greutaledge which insta kills everything and increases every non-combat stat by one level per damage dealt. Also every slayer 2 task monster deposits 1k of each of the gather skill items in your bank on death. That way you'll never have to play any other part of the game ever again!
---
I'm really excited!
---
The majority of players never agreed to the introduction of discontinued items. I hope this is not legit.
---
We all know it's mod ree
---
likely because you don't hear them repeatedly for a good portion of your existence, or because you don't see the double standard that commonly occurs when they're flipped around, or simply because you're not affected by the ones that are commonly posted.
---
Fair enough, I thought you were just nit-picking which really undermines the hard work everyone has put into this wonderful update.
---
You're just making yourself look worse dude. I'd stop check out the downvotes on your comments
---
Good question, the way I see it they're either too stupid to realize or they're too proud and disrespectful to care.
---
Wow these new HD character models look great
---
Ditterbitter made a good tribrid guide, checkout his youtube channel. Then get your ass kicked for many hours and you'll improve over time.
---
The level of woosh this guy just experienced is very satisfying. I find a lot of people who try to woosh people, get wooshed lol.
---
Models is the term, in this case chathead models.
---
Definitely look like night elves. I think it‚Äôs pretty neat!
---
def tanks r the best bet, but they take forever to train
---
What comments lol? If I cared about downvotes I‚Äôd be out here farming for karma like you.
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
Ohhh so when you take a teleport it puts you on the ceiling not the "top floor?" Very cool
---
Even if it doesn't respawn regularly, it's almost a given that it'd reset/respawn on a server reboot. Unless they manually remove the NPC from the game next week.
---
Finally someone made this into a meme! 
---
That dwarf has given me so many mini heart attacks and broken my eardrums couple of times. I use Sound Effects to signal when my invy is full and when a pker attacks me. I fish crabs, nothing else

rare doesn't mean discontinued
---
What does the grail do?
---
Not sure but I'm pretty sure I saw pics somewhere of her streaming on twitch? Like a design stream? Maybe it was Q&amp;A, idk. But yeh if you care that much, definitely give your feedback
---
That was an actual thing pre eoc on RS3, they changed the high alch values for nats p quickly.
---
I think they look good tbh. Only Elena is fucked
---
no one knows it was added today
---
Thats just idiots panicing thinking its rare item. And merchers are happy.
---
why should someone have less say over the direction of their government just because they live in a city?
---
I can‚Äôt see anything past that horrible graceful coloring

learn what a gp sink is

Very strongly against. They polled making various things easier, and were met with an emphatic "no".

it was added today, if you wiki dragonstone armour the set comes up but nothing else.

learn to read the update notes

Hail slaanesh

Sometimes we forget to put in the /s don‚Äôt worry about it chip

I didn't know I was colour blind until those colour blind memes came around a while back and I unironically couldn't read one of the real colour blindness 'tests'. So thanks internet... I guess.
---
Yea, wasting XP. Befor BU I played a little, but now I can‚Äôt as I feel that I need to get my shit together instead of grinding xp. Although I would love if osrs was fun to me now.
---
it didnt cross my mind to check that. thank you for being so kind and helpful though.

Doric's I believe! Spotted another one in MEP1 today as well with the bear fur and silk.

80 Hunter or 90 for bare-handed.

It hides that youre online! Doesn't work for seeing somebody in-world, though.

They should make it sparkle like magic logs. That'd be sick, and seems appropriate for a 250m item

Got my first 99 ever a few weeks ago (ranged) after starting the game way back in 2006 and picking old school up around 2017. I was in the exact boat as you, I always wanted a 99 as a kid but never came close. As I got this 99 it was literally a childhood dream coming true, it was amazing! Congrats on yours as well my friend!

Apparently they migrated after some undead queen decided to burn their tree down.

No one cares about anyone elses username. I've always just hit random in mmos and other video games.

What exactly?, if you mean the weapon and shield being reverted into seeds the blog told us that already, just go to Iilfeen to get back your weapon/shield at the charge it had.
---
Can u get me some bonds so I can start playing again ?
---
oh i didnt know, tyvm
---
Excellent work Jagex, I loved the quest and the final boss was really well done especially with the atmosphere. Now I can wear my quest cape again. The new areas are really detailed and feel like the belong in our universe.
---
like the electoral college did that three years ago?
---
Is the rabbit actually gone?
---
Congratulations!
---
i like the new models except Iorworth's pale purple skin. The faces tho...need lots of work
---
Is it like a playtesters list or something? I don't understand the significance.
---
it's like the 6th time this has popped up
---
This better not be true wtf

I feel like the memes actually are the way the community expresses their appreciation for everything Ash does.
