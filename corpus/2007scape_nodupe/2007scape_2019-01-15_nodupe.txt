Which 3 skills? I‚Äôm going to guess fletching, cooking and range?
---
Or a possibility to ban certain dungeons from the list, greater demons in the brimhaven dungeon. Just ban the area and receive greater demons elsewhere.
---
Someone posted a spreadsheet confirming Konar is best if any task that couldn't be done quicker somewhere else is skipped.
---
I think ash should be one of the things you can chip off the rock while doing volcanic mine similar to calcite, numulite etc. You won't get a significant amount, but it's enough on top of the points that I could see it being worth while. 
---
You'll be mind blown if you go mem. F2P is very limiting. If you're trying to do Castle Wars, nobody plays anymore on F2P.
---
Plus vast majority of players use 3rd party it‚Äôs like ur clutching at straws night mate, keep using the osrs database to buy your rune items leave the high tier items for the un retarded 
---
The craziest thing about that was it was 6/6/06 I believe and a school near me had a huge police presence because of threats, it being the devils day and all.
---

---
2/4 I got mine, it‚Äôs truly 50/50
---
What is that ugly little nightmare fuel and how can i get it?
---
Lmao tell to Varrock and buy food. Then go back to Wintertodt with a games necklaces. 
---
It's too bad you don't have prayer level for Smite. Smiting him on the killing blows yields pet. 
---
Nope just you
---
[removed]
---
Your only argument is that since I haven't experienced all the end game content I can't judge how good the game is. A good game doesn't only consist of endgame content and players should not get bored af before getting there. 
---
Sick 2 def tank man. I have a similar build.
---
I can understand a 12 hour sesh here and there, but doing it for 6 days in a row is mad. Just a 3 hour sesh of osrs gets me sick of the game if I‚Äôm not pking but to each their own 
---
Yeah if you're a shmuck and fall for that shit 
---
Bring back the black pure. 
---
Most likely RATed. Clean your PC or you're going to keep having issues. Google can tell you how to verify you're infected and how to clean it.
---
Use that extra 500 point block m8
---
f2p?
---
But then I'll lose all my points saved, I've got in bank lol
---
Do  you mind sharing the chance of getting  any drop from her table?
---
The news post only mentioned the chance of accessing the unique table.
---
Yea, just hover ur mouse over it
---
My vote goes to Cannonballs, (dragon) bones and other end products that just leave the game again immediately
---
as far as uniques go: maybe an (add-on) item that increases the dragon hunter lances dmg/acc to make it as powerful as the dhcb, but the lance becomes untradeable while upgraded. the upgrade can be removed, but you only get the lance back. That should keep the demand pretty high
---
That's the meme reeeee
---
Reported again

I see. I wooshed it and through you were thinking an RS element. 
---
Skills necklace teleport to farming guild shouldn't have been changed, just the farming cape teleport. 
---
Drakes shouldn't be assigned by Duradel.
---
Rest seems fine.
---
Don‚Äôt have 30 points to skip?
---
Who the feck cares 
---
I'll admit it. One of the first things I did when I came back and made a new account.
---
Poor thing 
---
Wrong usage.
---
Do people even play castle wars in p2p?
---
Think they are on fossil island. 
---
Can you give the leaf bladed sword +4 str bonus? It would still be weaker than the granite hammer, but not as dramatically. They have the same attack requirement and attack speed, but the leaf bladed sword has a 55 slayer requirement and the granite hammer does not.
---
Go 13 brother get slay helm , fairy ring and addys 
---
It was worth a shot :(
---
$38 what a waste of time.
---
That‚Äôs the most conservative possible estimate, which is nice given the context.  Don‚Äôt be a dick.
---
Yes
---
i havent done this quest in 3 years, what do they ask you to plant again?
---
He ain't hard either
---
&gt; un retarded       
---
Yeah that about sums up this conversation
---
There was one clan that would do it but I think they died.
---
This is two good
---
I used almost all of my points on the boss option because i‚Äôm a dumbass. 
---
Off the top of my head I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt have a slayer ring either. 
---
Not the table, but an increased spawn rate for superiors would be awesome. 
---
Hopefully some of the new mobs get superiors in the future, but a 10%-25% boost, even as a seperate points unlock would be great. It would sort of fit the design space she's in of "Sacrificing the most efficient methods for a bit of a lotto ticket"
---
its a chili potato... which is one of my favorite drops at bandos
---
amazing
---
There is going to be no ‚Äúgood‚Äù money while super afk.

Magic logs/sharks/monkfish/cannonballs are probably your best bet.

---
With your stats and I‚Äôd assume rather low slayer level, it might just be best to reset your streak. 
---
EasyScape
---
I think it could give some when mining the rock similar to calcite, numulite etc. Since that will be 4 possibilities from the 5 xp drops, you won't get enough to do a lot of damage to ash rates. Did VM from 87-99 and that little bit of extra ash would have been cool for herb runs. 
---
You need to hire some handymen from Roller Coaster Tycoon and that shit will be lookin' fresh 24/7.
---
Wait, I just grinded to 77 slayer to kill brutal black dragons, are you saying there's an exp multiplier bracelet?
---
Out of the 7 i caught 4 of them were coifs. Nice. 
---
The first 110 or so I did Puro-Puro because I was an ironman. After I deironed a few weeks back I just bought eclectic jars and have been doing them since. Medium clues are 1/25 rate or so from them.
---
I‚Äôd say the same, but they do scale with HP, after 84(i think) they heal 30 gp per inv spot 
---
This post is literally just an ad.
---
Sub 1 minute would be almost 20 dps. I'm not saying it's impossible but that is absurdly high lol. 
---
Well, worst case scenario is you go to turael and get a new task from him, losing your streak. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have 30 points to skip, you‚Äôll either have to try to do the task with your current stats, cancel the task and lose your streak, keep the task and train your stats, or if you have a friend that wouldn‚Äôt mind doing some KQ with you, you might be able to complete the task that way. Last option is probably your best. 
---
Just casually walking around with 500k runes lol
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand I don‚Äôt pick up the bones anyways because my inventory is always full with loot.

---
Yea, that's my point. Even using Fire Surge with Infinity, Brimstone Ring, Tome/Staff of Light/Occult, I was getting only 23k xp/h. With same set-up, but trident, I was getting 22k xp/h at Drakes. So Idk how he's saying Wyrms and Drakes are decent XP tasks, especially for anyone without access to absolute max gear.
---
Really? 
---
Could hydra bones be a noted drop?
---
It fills up the inventory rather quickly, so I 'have' to end the trip when I still have supplies for a couple more kills.
---
I think it would be fair if the kebos/kourend elite diary would be a requirement for this.
---
Well, the reason it works that way in the Wildy is likely due to how it was polled. If they intended for it to be non-revertable, it would have been the wildy behavior that was changed instead.
---
Stat wise, D boots are very close to prims.  No mid-tier item needed.  Dboots are the mid tier item.
---
If it's already planted but you haven't checked the health and she gives you a contract for it you can just check the health and it'll complete the contract.
---
I believe the harvesting stuff is to completely harvest the plant.

You're selectively reading my statement so read again for comprehension and get back to me.

How did you get yours?

I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea honestly. It takes the only downside and removes it. If you don‚Äôt like the area it‚Äôs assigned cancel it.
---
Might have gotten ripped off haha. I was just giving a price point of reference before mm. Which reminds me, I massively overpaid for a dscim around the release of mm. Wanted one before I completed and paid around a mill. Imagine my face when I completed the quest and saw the store price üòÇ 
---
Only fruit trees so far, I suspect the drop rate may be tied to XP drop of the harvest
---
He‚Äôs talking about other players. Every current account wouldn‚Äôt magically get an untrimmed cape because they don‚Äôt have records of what was achieved first. 
---
Jagex isn‚Äôt going to change it to a system where untrimmed capes don‚Äôt trim after 99 for a select group of people. 
---
It will work, yes. I've chain-planted things (cadantine for the initial contract, planted watermelon/snape/cactus/poison ivy/limpwurt, second contract was for snape grass and third was for poison ivy) so it absolutely works and works well if you know common contracts.
---
Solid advice, now I just need to learn how to stop people from calling me a fucking noob.

I‚Äôll add her keep private msg on public 
---
Please also fill me in, I left RS3 after the... 2016? MTX apology where they said they'd slow down and then just didn't. 
---
He said dragon crossbow, not dragon hunter crossbow, smh\~ the reason for the 2m price drop is because the new lance is BiS at rune drags, so everyone is doing them right now too test the lance.

---
i personally really dislike the rs3 aesthetic. i'm not saying that current osrs aesthetics are the best ever, but rshd was a step down imo. too much visual clutter/effects, the new shading obfuscated the actual world grid, textures are really high res but the models are still fairly blocky which is a big mismatch. luckily there was a low detail mode, which felt better personally but i couldn't get used to it over the older graphics.
---
No. Currently there are 4 phases planned. Each phase with respective patches.
---
It should be atleast be 6 or 8 phases (knowing how many patches there are).
---
Also in their current Phase 1. Dire Maul will be available at release. This is major no no, for me. Not only does DM provide with better loot than you'd get from MC. It'll also have a serious impact on the economy, if available on release. Not to mention the 2-hour buffs.
---
There are some other things that don't corrolate with the original vanilla update cycle, aswell.
---
There has been some outcry in the community over this. So I truly hope Blizz gets their heads out of their arses and listen to the community (for once).
---
Thank you! I'm buying it for my zerk for raids (ruby bolts for olm.) I think I'll just take my chance and buy it now, I doubt it will go down much more.

I believe you need to unlock Tigard tasks and the master will ask if you‚Äôd like to slay jad instead. In order to get jad you‚Äôll need to complete killing him once first. 
---
Yes officer, this post right here. 
---
This went from "its all my fault i got ratted" to "FUCK U JAGEX NO DELAY ON AUTHENTICATOR" real quick.
---
While I understand your frustration you have to notice one thing here.
---
Blizzard has their own authenticator app, jagex uses google hence why they are not allowed to make any changes to the authenticator, just like blizzard, steam and many more corperations there is no delay upon removal of the authenticator because of the sole purpose of not wanting to lock people out of their account once they lose their phone.
---
Surely jagex security can increase a ton but we all know that isnt on the priority list.
---
Also little off topic your post got auto removed because way to many "fuck" in it.
---
That's what I'm saying. Self sufficient, figure out how to see
---
Mostly because while skating you want to feel like Aladdin on a magic carpet, so the pants should be as baggy as possible for the best roleplay
---
if Konar drop table is nerfed because of these maxed accounts complaining I want Alchemical Hydra drop table to be nerfed aswell.  
---
I have 95 slayer but I use blowpipe, but if you go near boss entrance its always maxed accounts with Twisted bow farming the new boss for drops. people are making 200-300m  in 200-400 kill count.  
---
Twisted bow  damage skips some of the mechanics, so its fast  kcs.  
---
Im ranting because i dont have twisted bow :
---
Zammy hasta has halved damage at corp, just like the dragon hasta does now. The zammy spear gets full damage at Corp, as does every other spear.

I'd literally pay 2m (upgrade from 200k from previous quest) just to skip this shit
---
1-4 ranarr seeds instead of a 104-199 ranarr drop? thats.. a huge difference.. that was the only reason I was grinding slayer until I found out that was changed just now. if you're going to nerf it, at least nerf it proportionally. that is not a 30% decrease. that's abysmal. considering there was a massive farming update with this, at least make it like 4-20 seeds with 20 being slightly more rare. same with all the other herb drops, and honestly the rune drops were harmless. why get rid of them?
---
Yeah it's doable if you want 5 minute vorkath kills. 
---
youre just repeating what he said
---
What are your stats?
---
dont worry guys i dont think theyll nerf hydra drop table
---
Eh I don‚Äôt want a game that I can just ignore and get max level. Sometimes I appreciate the fact that I can be involved in. Rs‚Äô combat system is exactly that in the PVM spectrum, while the PVP spectrum is something so few people ever master. I like that Rs gives me a variety like that.
---
This ignores chinese players which is WoW's biggest playerbase
---
There's bots with 70+ attack/str?
---
What about adding minus-defense-xp lamps to the Konar drop table?
---
Replace some of the skilling items with supplies that can be used on tasks. At the moment, many of her tasks reward little, and the supply costs can be sizable (without simply suffering through them), so a little kickback like the blog described would be great.
---
Restore the value of her drops. I really miss her big ticket drops too, as it finally made Slayer feel *fun and lucrative* for me, and for the first time I was happy to go get a task at mid-level.
---
At the moment, her uniques aren't much enticing at all considering they're just recolors (albeit cool ones). I suggest upgraded versions of Slayer equipment such as the witchwood icon and the mirror shield. Those would be rather nice incentives that help you directly with the skill.
---
Its a birb eat birb world.

it's about as useful as the granite ring so yeah it's pretty bad

---
Well my main argument here to begin with was to revert a reward that was not part of the poll that we voted on. Making a change 2 days before release without a poll makes no sense and many people are confused why and also don't think it was a good change. I was just saying reverting this would help make drake claw a bit more since it will be BIS for Hydra. Also don't think anyone banks any of the new bones other than looters. Noting them would at least make the bones used and worth picking up. As of right now, it's just not worth picking up any bones anywhere there.
---
Oh gotcha. It's coming up on 9pm here so she will probably be getting off soon, what's your rsn so I can have her add you
---
You could raid with those stats as long as you understand the mechanics of the bosses and Olm. Those take some time to learn. You may not be able to get on an experienced team with those stats without a significant KC though. Ideally, you want to be maxed, but it‚Äôs definitely possible with those stats. I was raiding with a 1 def pure the other day. Did like 6 raids I think and he didn‚Äôt die once.
---
Nice try I give you a 6/10
---
I would but I‚Äôm doing cheap trips with lobs so I‚Äôm banking every 10-15 kills anyway. All and all made 1.3 mil off that task. Most of it being from the stackable drops that I picked up while I was there.
---
‚ÄúWhat a fucking tard‚Äù is what other people would reply if this was my post. But I‚Äôm sorry man, I hope you get it soon.

I play RS3 primarily and lurk osrs for memes. The last 6-9 months~ or so has been a significant increase in quality and quantity of content compared to the previous year to year and and half. Where the decline of content starts will vary player to player but to me the significant start was when they decided to do expansions instead of the historic update timeline (weekly updates) similar to what osrs has and what RS3 currently has. As well MTX seems to have plateaued it is still very prevalent but no longer seems to be increasing or at least as significantly. The mining and smithing update seems very well received and considering how long it took to develop and the scale of it seems to have created a new positively in the community when it comes to future content.
---
It‚Äôs funny seeing all these interpretations of characters when no one takes into consideration when and where osrs takes place and that these women are probably raggedy

I have a similar problem, except I played EoC for a long while before my main got banned - but I was already near maxed before EoC dropped. I have no earthly idea how to train efficiently at lower levels. I found it easier to get back into OS because it's closer to the way the game was when I first started playing.

---
I love the animation of whacking someone with a 2h, I lol every time 
---
I actually liked that you could potentially get a rare valuable drop, with the average value being lowered by the more common drops. The inconsistency of the value of the drop made it really exciting to get something good. 
---
Is not Bis for olm hand scythe does..
---
Farm run during release day gave me 3 from fruit trees, then one more from a bush.

Yeah no thanks. Don't want some worthless drop occupying what is supposed to be a reward table just because they're annoying for iron men to get. Yuckers.

alright. any chance you know how to get at the Xeric's Talisman you're supposed to get on completion of architectural alliance?

Well duradel is a lvl100+ slayer master and the best slayer master for high lvl players, so these bad mid lvl tasks shouldnt have a place on there.
---
not surprising in the slightest 
---
You can try to bring it up on a q&amp;a if you want...but its probably too late to change something like this. People were paying 5-10mil for seeds on day one so they could access the diaries, might be a bit unfair to them if it was nerfed. They would have to remove it and then repoll it which i find unlikely. Or they poll removing it...which i find unlikely passing. 
---
I don't think it was ever pinned, to begin with. We can only set two posts as Announcements and both are already being used. The first is being used for the Q&amp;A Question post and if we removed it players won't be able to submit questions. The second is the Kebos Update since that is still recent and its sticked comment links to relevant information like this Hotfix post.
---
Announcement posts are easier to miss than front page so we try to only add them once important posts start to fall off the front page. The Feedback post is still recent and currently #7 on the front page, so it didn't need to be an announcement yet. But I did forget to add it to the Kebos post earlier since it was posted after I added the link to the Hotfix post so I'll fix that now.
---
Anyone know how I can get a water talisman on my low level iron? Tried the abyss but I get smacked every time. Thanks!

---
What's sad is that over time the votes of players like you will drown out mine and you'll be able to go from a fresh account to high tier bossing in a few weeks. Sad, honestly. It's called lategame for a reason, it is supposed to take a while to get there.
---
You could flip those arrows in the GE
---
Oh man u had ti figure that iut but yea, reply to main post with just a q because its a question
---
They didn't until the recent Mining and Smithing rework, would hang around 23k - 27k prior to that. The update is honestly amazing, RS3 devs really outdid themselves this time.
---
I can only hope they continue this trend into 2019, given the 2018 updates were mainly a string of fuck ups and MTX with the long-awaited bank rework being shelved to end the year.
---
Whoosh

We need more posts like this.   This was a good laugh and was a truly funny post.

They can be exchaged to the bounty hunter shop for 5m points, or they can be sold to other players looking for rune pounches for roughly 2m gp each. Im gonna hold onto them until I reach 100 though.
---
Can we add a depost box for fossils?
---
Currently the unidentified version is stackable in your bank. But once you identify them, they become a pain to store them in your bank if you don't have the required pieces to put in the glass container. 
---
1 stack turns into 15 or so stacks (in your bank).
---
When you look at a pet, you shouldn't see the animation. You should see the grind and untreated autism behind it.
---
I got my first unique at 54 kc and it wasn't until 564 kc that I got my second unique. Luckily both were Hydra Claws
---
Right on thanks for the info. Good luck!
---
Actually they are cheap and reliable. I don't own one but I think as a younger person it's smart to have one. Nice try though.
---
Nice
---
Idk it's not that far ahead of Amazing Cultivation Simulator
---
Because based on the possible locations, they end up being slower tasks which in turn grants less points over time and ALSO less xp over time. It's as simple as that. The drop table is a great incentive to use her.
---
Increased chance of superiors please. Especially with the new slayer monsters not having superior versions.
---
I'd recommend Torags Top and Bottom and food until you can afford Guthans. Safespotting is too slow and pray pots are going to hinder your gp/hr by a lot. But Guthans is truly a lifesaver there, you can stay there forever with it.
---
What other use would you like?
---
There is a classic rsps with mobile. Idr name though.
---
Fair enough
---
That‚Äôs tragic 
---
Waaaat
---
OpenRSC is the one
---
Big if true
---
eyes of sauron ahaha
---
It depends. Each time you eat you lose 3 ticks before you can attack. So with very low defense it's possible to have less overall DPS, even if your attack and strength bonus is higher. 
---
There's another one I think. Might not be. I know I found it when they announced the removal of rsc.
---
Zuk on my balls
---
HAAAAA GOTTEM
---
All 3 of those come exclusively from bots though. Nobody is skilling for any of those but ironmen, yall are doing whatever your best gp/hr is then buying those.
---
Tru
---
Awww man I thought that one was really good too, it's got the whole villain succeeds Thanos type story lol
---
Laughed way too hard at this. Thanks!
---
I just completed my first one with high 80s melee, 85 range and 81 mage. It was a rough go but I didn't die lol. I think you'd be good if you have a good team and someone with 90 herb.
---
LOL @ PURES.
---
Cheers!
---
Nightmare zone
---
Well that was misleading
---
If you use any ice spell, e.g. barrage, does it not freeze and become a safespot?
---
If you run in a good group it should only be a few hundred hours to get it.
---
For real. Puring is so stupid. Cuts out so much content in a way that was clearly not designed.
---
I mean you have birdhouses (marginal) but theres herbibore, which is a nice way to switch it up. more so than you can say for other skills. 
---
It looks better and the way it swings is just like bh crater days
---
We pay we say
---
Yes and yes
---
If someone at the alley i work at did this shit, i would through them out. Fucking dumb ass trying to kill the pinsetter.

Find the professor!!

i support this idea as well 100%
---
2-10 magic seeds, imagine lmao, that is insane, definitely 1-3 for most of the high end tree seeds.

i think 4-8 or higher is good for herb seeds tho

What are your stats currently, planning on buying membership in the near future?

nEw
---
&gt; I have a high level runescape account

&gt; i'm at 99 cb

fuckn lol
---
And the hundreds of hours for 99 rc, agil, slayer, and countless other stuff doesn‚Äôt? 
---
Don't spam. This post us irrelevant to the topic.
---
And make her feminine dick more pronounced.  
---
Is part of being a successful osrs streamer commenting on Boaty's tweets the fastest?
---
An account with those stats could be made in about 2-3 days if you have roughly 3m~ gp to spend and a bit of time.
---
you didn't get the aerial fishing memo? hunter content
---
But you can‚Äôt tell to growing trees :(
---
Can you explain why though? I kinda want that shiny dragon scim haha, and it seems like taking the quickest route to it would be the fastest way to train strength in the long run.
---
5?
---
Ah, I see. Rangers themselves are 1/1000 per slot and mediums are 3-5 (average 4) rolls per clue, which got 1/250 effective rate stuck in my head. But lucky implings are a single roll, making it the straight 1/1k once you hit the medium table, which is 1/5.
---
Thanks for explaining to my dumb ass
---
Lmao skilling content getting fixed? Consider yourself lucky they added fishing content at all.
---
I‚Äôm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC and you‚Äôre watching, ‚ÄúHow to Catch a Predator‚Äù
---
H3ckhound more like big idiot 
---
thank you, net
---
Waaaaaaay yo op!!!
---
Probably because they don‚Äôt want to put on their own site, which is permanent, that they implemented so many things wrong. 
---
Barrows man. You're pretty far off ds2 anyway lol and the gloves are only BiS for melee, and you have to make them yourself which requires very high stats. B gloves are still the route to go and should always be your first goal IMO. 
---
To get the account to the stats I had when I began pking I spent maybe around 5m on cannoning and potions/food for training. I'd recommend starting out with a basic granite maul pure, they are low-risk/high-reward and dont take alot of practice to get decent at.
---
not my proudest fap
---
IMO zulrah is a lot of fun and the click intensity/focus required is not a hassle at all. I definitely recommend getting 85 mage and range and you‚Äôll be set. It‚Äôs also nice to have fairy ring in your house so you don‚Äôt spend a fortune on scrolls.
---
I liked having that extra thing to look forward too. Now it's just very underwhelming 
---
You're really going at him in these comments but I'm still impressed as fuck
---
Yeah but he's praying mage
---
fuck you
---
To max
---
Might make drop parties more fun, in my experience telegrab is slower than someone running to it
---
The only time the 15k matters is when your questing barrows gloves and want limited defence exp.
---
Other than that, do what you want.
---
Dude level 53 is very much low level. You can get level 40 attack str def and hp from 2 quests. You are at the very beginning of the game and 53 average takes about 2 weeks to get if you know what you're doing.
---
[Follow up.](https://clips.twitch.tv/CoyCloudyFinchKippa) Already reported him so I didn't see what he was saying. It's honestly a little  sad on his part.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve missed quite a couple tee times. Joined the local country club over in Kourend, they‚Äôve got some nice spots, but they‚Äôll charge ya a chunk for missing your time. 
---
Idk how big of a deal it is to change a drop table but I‚Äôve always liked the idea of a rotational drop table, idk what it would be on it, but changing it month to month would be cool .. imo 
---
You take that phone with you when you take a dump? 
---
The Karamja easy-hard diaries existed long before the rest of them, they just never changed the models.
---
Do whichever you want man. Go with attack since you want 60 to use the scim. There isnt a big difference at all in 15k exp so theres no wrong choice unless you're a pure of some sort (which you aren't) so just go with whatever one you want right now. 
---
Seems you want attack, so go for that. No wrong answer. 
---
thanks &lt;3
---
honestly the core issue with pest control is that you either:
---
1. need exactly 25 people to play, no more no less, or
---
2. have to play in the regular world and get games *at random* making it impossible to really play with friends
---
Dont u need b gloves to make f gloves nyways
---
Damn, you must give amazing blowjobs. The devs  must have loved that 
---
Well you still need 84 qp to be able to do ds2 and rfd is a pretty easy (imo) 10 quest points you'd be missing if you dont do it. So its your call.
---
I wouldn't mind a tool belt item as long as it was an actual item you had to have in your inventory to access it. That way it's more for saving bank space than inventory space.
---
When I was your level I usually leveled strength and attack side by side. 50 atk/str, 55 atk/str etc. You do you though. Have fun :)
---
No you don't
---
My bad. If you have decent stats and gear you will have a lot easier time with most content. That doesn't necessarily mean you will be able to do all content regardless of your skill level. There are players that can't complete the inferno with max gear and max stats and there are players that can completely it with garbage gear and on a pure account. It all just depends on the specific content and the skill level of the player. 
---
As for going from RS3 to OSRS I am really not sure. I was just trying to answer what I thought was a relatively straight forward question.
---
This makes so much sense.
---
99.9% of the time that's not the case
---
That's a fair point 
---
That's a yikes from me
---
LMAOO I forgot ŸÅŸÉ meant jaw. OOPSIE DOOPSIE.
---
I'm pretty new, so I'm very low leveled. My attack and strength are both about 6. My Mining is around 18, my smithing around 7. Nearly everything else is at base level.
---
As for membership - I was definitely planning to EVENTUALLY get membership. I had the goal in mind to do all the F2P quests first, then get membership. However, based on some of the other comments in here it seems like getting membership now may make things much more convenient.
---
Casual players need not reply.

No definitely not worth

Worse than a Rune Halberd for me. Me and a friend pineing over the same girl, pooled together money to buy her a dfs, I remember heading to falador to find someone selling it and all. Vivid memories from those days

Can you bring back bonfires, even at 1/2 the xp rate of doing fire lines, every skill has some afk way to train it except fm, which u either fire line actively, or wintertodt 24/7 on   
---
Yew logs are down past redwood logs now, need more people training firemaking burning actual logs
---
200 iq
---
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying about the herblore secondaries. It def makes Ironman easier but there is value in those secondaries, white berries around 400 gp each mort myre fungi 600 each, unicorn horn dust 350 each, it would def supply a way for people to collect those supplies without mindless gathering for little to no xp 
---
Then do the str. Honestly the 15k difference is not big at all, so it really just depends what stats you want to level right now. Only thing that will effect your char is if you dont want the defense exp. Like i said theres no wrong choice man. Lol dont stress about it :P literally just pick whichever one you want right now. 15k experience is like 10 minutes of training. 
---
What would you do to have her changed to make her better?
---
Sweet now I can just suck blue genie dick to 99 rc 
---
You better talk to the Wise Old Man and have him clear all the evidence from your bank.

Ive been enjoying it so far definitely a good break from duradel 
---
Any chance farnung contracts could reward you with a small amount of tithe farm points? Rewards from tithe farm are really useful but the minigame is considered boring and stale by many.
---
Looking back on past reddit posts...your items can‚Äôt be recovered. But you can complete the quest without the head, just go talk to Oziach
---
He‚Äôs 45 (level woodcutting) his girlfriend is 15 (level woodcutting). Wooosh
---
Yeah, skating is a lot quick and rapid movements so anything that gets in the way of that can be annoying
---
I think so as well. But I just feel like maybe she needs to have a slight slayer requirement. But I would say it's probably because I'm use to duradel having that. 
---
Would need more than 2 locations at each task then, otherwise you're just going to roll every dusties task to get catacombs. (Or you would need to make rerolling more expensive than 20 points).
---
Better burn that I originally thought 
---
If you go to the varrock museum basement you can do an easy quiz that'll get you 1k Slayer and Hunter XP which will get you level 9 Hunter then you only need 90 more levels. Good luck!

Ironmen and the wilderness:
---
Could there be some sort of verification for being able to pk?
---
The wilderness is a big part of the game, but ironmen can‚Äôt participate in the pvp. What if there was some sort of system to let them - ironmen can only attack other ironmen - pk?
---
so basically...
---
thanks I hate it?
---
Brimstone ring: offers all stat bonuses of every Frem and Wildy ring (cannot be imbued)
---
Yes, but I'm pretty sure u need at least 1 house portal
---
Not by a lot if they do end up going up
---
I normally would say yes but this was suppose to be a "Mid level" content master. I will say I am enjoying the extra gp. 
---
Do you think I can telegrab them? They seem pretty [close to the door](https://i.imgur.com/MEQUFeO.jpg). I wouldn't really care that much, but I was kinda a dumbass and brought about 5k death runes with me.
---
I honestly never did this.
---
In rs2 days I didn't have logical reasoning it was just I'm not collecting/tanning cow hides  fuck that boring shit.
---
Oh man did I not know what was to come.

Give us the clue rewards or your life

I like how it tells you to edit the comment when everyone can already see the correct link in its comment.

I meant not worth adding a slayer level

This was rather recent

The extra GP is nice. But I donno must just he only me then.

Not long really I have full prospector + coal bag + upstairs area at lvl 77.

U don‚Äôt need any stats just go do it

It wasn't nearly this bad for legion. I mean the start of legion was dog shit, but there were tools in place to fix it. BFA doesn't stand a chance with PVE warfronts and island expeditions being two of the biggest features.

This is exactly how RS3 turned into visual clusterfuck it is today. No thanks.

Finally achieve 99 runecrafting 
---
Would be neat if they implemented seasons where certain types of plants either had less chance of dying or yielded more
---
Finally achieve 57 runecrafting 
---
That's not really how it works. If it's shit gp/xp and you're not in a huge rush to get to 99 then it's not worth doing.
---
They just stood there for minutes on end, weren't in any rush to get anywhere.
---
yes they do.
---
Pretty hit or miss
---
Ceberus works if you get taverly hellhounds so yeah should work
---
How's that? You know there is a minigame where you can get like 100k xp/hr already, right?

Rex on 21 so I guess so ?

Nah just poor af lol

Could the Deranged archaeologist drop a mushroom sack to hold mushrooms during sulliuscep woodcutting? It's frustrating having to drop so many mushrooms when they're worth quite a bit, can be a nice alternative to collecting mort myre fungus.

Balance wise maybe it shouldn't be used outside of fossil island, or is untradeable, or requires Bone Voyage to use.

You became katamari damacy.
---
I'm also awful at zulrah and gave up trying tbh. From what i've heard using void to learn is really beneficial until you get the rotations down. Minimizing your switches would probably help you out a lot. Why would you say you're dying? Missing rotations? Running out of food?
---
If you're really arguing against a tree you can not grow anything else in its place that costs 100k per 5 days saying its not worth it, you lack the common sense necessary to have this discussion. Go kill vork ONCE and get that extra 20k xp/5 days. 
---
Just how can you be so cheap?
---
Didnt drop the untradeables, what a nice guy!
---
It‚Äôs in yannille. You can use the mini game tp to get there quickly

gratz! 250k from 99 there is still some hope for me ;-;

Im very obviously talking about growing normal stuff. All the added patches, new trees, not mentioning fruit tree runs are literally twice the xp for top trees as before.

Good idea but streamers and max mains with 4b bank will be against it because it means mid levels could hit a few mill drop
---
I think the mods said they would poll whether the lance be buffed or not
---
And OSRS isn't? Godswords, blowpipes, Zeah, etc.
---
Oof. That's sad you're muted but yeah, usually people come from the bank at certain camping spots and freak out and if you ignore them, they usually go away in like 10 minutes. Dope your account is nameless though 
---
Thanks for reaching out, but I'd feel too bad taking any money lol. I basically have all the FTP best in slot items and enough gp for a bond.
---
I think you underestimate how many others have a similar bank. Apart from his tbow which looks a bit RNG carried on top of being a safe PvE, he doesn't have a ton. I'd rank HCIM with some TOB items on top of most GW items as having better items.

Idk do quest

Oh no.... :(

Nope, it is clearly his autobiography pls sit nerd.

Upvote. Best of luck!
---
Kinda seems like your experience is that of an Ironman grind. I dunno I think you're giving new players too little credit however. 
---
This person has 60's in combat stats, and could definitely kill green dragons. Thing is, they don't have to just kill green dragons. With only a mil or so loss with a cannon, one can get 70 Slayer and kill kurasks for 700k per hour reliably. The methods that I'm talking about are just better. 
---
Overall I understand the place your coming from i think. Just cause a method is best doesn't mean it is all you should do. But to my earlier point it feels  important to give people looking for info the best you can provide.
---
&gt; Construction isnt super broken for these.
---
I got 1-99 Construction in this summer's beach event, without owning a house. It wasn't an iron though. From what I understand, irons had more limits on these events.
---
I bank it when I have to go to the wilderness :p
---
I don't have experience with this and this will probably be a dumb comment, but who knows.
---
On mobile there's an pointing fingers icon on the left side, it's smaller than the other ones. On it you have the option to select the input you're using and iirc keyboard and mouse are an option. Wouldn't that solve it for you?
---
Not max and not that nooby...
---
or smackdown
---
I don't understand why herb seeds are an option tbh. It really devalues farming as a money maker because with more seeds, more herbs come into the game. I am all for potion secondaries though. I don't think adding raw monkfish is a good idea because a lot of people like to fish monks on their downtime (like me) and it's profitable. Adding planks would be a good idea. 
---
I'm just not a fan of adding items that devalue gathering skills (fishing, woodcutting, runecrafting, farming)
---
Ironman? With how easy it is to tab to and from barrows, and restore stats with or without rejuv pool, you shouldn't be using food at barrows at all, and only p pots if you get a bad brother in the caves.
---
In fact, if you're using food to do multiple runs a trip, you're making far less than the cost of tabs accounts for. 
---
I hate when people go all out about efficiency in this game, but barrows is fun opening chests, so I feel it's somewhat okay here. 
---
what about streamers borrowing accounts for bounty hunter and pvp?
---
Actually enjoy not being able to talk - does wonders for productivity. I'll be able to chat away again once I choose a new name but for now #Player*randomnumbers* is nice :3
---
The cape should not have defence stats on par with infernal. Personally think the cape should remain untouched because it effects a vast amount of pures and what not (potentially negatively)
---
I do that so I always have enough money and also so I can teleport to the ge and buy stuff I may need without having to bank. 
---
Try to figure it out at your own pace, because it's just as good as OSRS if not better. There's tons of content. The world seems more alive so it's nice to play solo, graphics are magnitudes better, including performance.
---
Ssd 
---
x16 (max) and I can absolutely see a difference even from x2. 
---
Just upgrade them.
---
At this point I think he‚Äôs just trolling you 
---
It's a bit of a hit and miss from me.. Some worlds are fine but I haven't put any conscious effort to finding some solid alternatives to Aus worlds :P
---
What rank is your hcim? Curious because I'm making a 27 hour documentary about them.
---
"I dont care about the money".. 5 bill gone and he just wants to play. Amazing. Upvoted
---
It doesn't need it and shouldn't get one.
---
Yeah they said that it was launched at 30% increase however it was promised to be 20% and they changed it instantly however they will most likely buff it
---
I‚Äôd say no. 
---
I had one summer where I posted 15k+ times on a forum, played Runescape, and then trained over summer for Football.  My entire life for a whole summer was those three.  Then for a semester I just did Runescape, School, Football and then it turned into Runescape and School.
---
I don't remember much of any of it except I got 99 thieving, firemaking over the summer (this was back in 2011).
---
Rapid heal is pretty eh for slayer. I personally don't but haven't needed to with 90 defense and high level gear.
---
Now I never run out :D
---
Oh man this hurts. Don't let it stop you though! 2 Def is not the end of the world.
---
It doesn't matter if you have authentication, secure username, password, etc. I'm friends with recoverers and 90% of the time they get your account information from Zybez. Even if its old account information, they can submit an appeal with all the information they have (including your IP, where you live, previous passwords), and they usually get the account. Also it doesn't matter if your account was banned, they can get it unbanned with a 100% success rate lmfao. 
---
Until the recovery system is fixed, people can recover your account from 3rd party leaks such as zybez even though all the information they have is false. Best advice I can give is if you signed up to any of these 3rd party websites is to change your password, username, and then bank all your items when you log out. 
---
I believe it has something to do with twitch, because I have been streaming a lot lately. But I didn‚Äôt click any links or show any info on stream. My paypal email is also different from RS so I have no clue how. But, I‚Äôve heard of a lot of lower streamers getting hacked related to twitch. But, I still don‚Äôt have an explanation as to how. 
---
Not everyone worries about maximizing xp per hour lol 
---
Irons had half xp once the thermometer filled, so I can understand it seeming less powerful to me (I've only played iron for about a year).
---
I'm interested how long you spent at the beach though. Cause 99 construction for me was probably 20mins effort managing Miscellania, 2 hours of div to run plank makers and maybe 20 hours using planks.
---
Getting to maybe 75 could be broken, but all the way to 99 seems like a huge waste to me.
---
Just did it three days ago to buy my first set of mithril armor and more.
---
LITERALLY farming (legal poaching) for gold.
---
If you want acces to real money makers you should try and get a bond :p
---
You mean the MTX cosmetics that you buy with real life money as opposed to earning via in-game methods like, say, completing 100 master clues? Not what I'm advocating for. Some low-key wings would maybe be okay as a reward for killing Zilyana 1,000 times.
---
And pets are already a thing, and they're also pretty low-key (for the most part). Particles? Maybe as an effect on some high-level mage gear from the next raid (if they do add another raid), but otherwise I agree that they're excessive.
---
Charged with other bracelets and no stats pls.
---
Aware. Reps till I‚Äôm out 
---
Tbf, and this is just speculation, they could've created a Yuotube.com url (note the spelling) which quickly grabs info and then redirects you to the correct url. Making it seem like yt is just a bit laggy, but you end up on the correct site so you don't think twice about it. 
---
I‚Äôd make it so the real blood runecrafting altar is back in the game. Unlocked by whatever quest in OSRS is the equivalent to ‚ÄúLegacy of Seergaze‚Äù. I forgot what it‚Äôs called. They‚Äôve acknowledged that the Zeah altar is a proxy altar.
---
This would let me grind out blood runes faster than at Zeah although with more attention but I‚Äôm cool with that. 
---
It upset me to have been grinding runecrafting and with each lap I pass the blood rift and look forward to using it and then the Zeah implementation makes it irrelevant except for a fast travel to the area to begin using the Zeah method. The Mortania quest line is so epic and awesome that it makes me miss that the blood altar isn‚Äôt accessible there anymore. 
---
There should also be an epic storyline for the real soul runecrafting altar. Maybe inside the elf city Priffdinas and unlocked with the quest that‚Äôs coming out as the conclusion to that quest line. 
---
Overall all else I want the actual altars for blood and soul to be revealed and for their respective rifts to be included in the Abyss. 
---
I know no one else will care about any of this but I really really do. 
---
Nothing is going to happen until morning. Your best chance is keep recovering it - you can manually recover it even if there's an email set. Assuming you're the real owner you will be able to recover it manually even if they have an email set.
---
well lets be real that's what every RWT-er would say, so lets not go off of that alone. But I do hope homie gets his account back if he's legit, which im pretty damn confident rank 451 would be. 
---
Bad bot
---
Why?
---
I have no idea what you're trying to say. Morytania/Zanaris still fit Runescape's art direction, they look nothing like private server nonsense. Zeah, on the other hand, doesn't fit the 2007 style very well, but I'm not actually all that bothered by it. Godswords look like stupid private server bullshit but they're rare enough that I don't care.
---
I'm not saying Jagex should add whatever stupid shit pops into their head like private server MTX, I'm saying it wouldn't hurt the game to add stuff like a casket hat for completing a shitload of master clue scrolls. I trust them to not overload the game with crap like RS3.
---
WRYYYYYYYYYYY
---
Would allow you to stock up on them to use for kraken tasks or Abby demons to get the signature drop.
---
There would still be a delay to change it. He said they changed it, and he so.ehow changed it back.
---
Good luck man. I am a casual player that has spent a lot of time building up his account (albeit inefficiently) and this is my worst nightmare. It would 100% kill runescape for me if I had to start over.
---
I hope you get your account back
---
Dude best of luck to you that‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt imagine all of the work you out into your account. I hope the devs can pull through for you ‚ù§Ô∏è. 
---
I enjoy this haha
---
You sadly can't, I've tried. You'll get a message: "The sire takes no interest in you."
---
Guarantees a hit and increases damage by 15%, maybe?
---
Incredibly impressive account. Props to your buddy for boarding like a madman on hcim.

I also like more xp but that would likely be broken/easy scape.

though maybe long bone/Curved bone would be nice to see.

Is this sarcasm?

Daily reminder: Passwords are case-insensitive
---
No dipstick, you have raw numbers, data. You can't call it science if your dumb ass can't read the numbers. 
---
It‚Äôs possible yeah. I may have slipped up &amp; clicked a weird youtube link, but for the most part I tried to only click on the ones from my known friends. Either way, the act is done &amp; the money is gone, I just want my account returned safely &amp; that anyone with a similar issue knows they aren‚Äôt alone. Hopefully this post saves other people, if anything. 
---
Do you use a unique password/email for runescape? If you use the same credentials, even with minor variations on multiple sites, it‚Äôs very likely someone just checked a dump from a hack and used that info to social engineer their way into your account. 
---
PSA: Use a password program, or at the very least, completely unique passwords for everything you care to secure. If you really don‚Äôt want to do either, you can occasionally search around and pay the hackers to search their dump for yourself. Easier to just use a password keychain and make you‚Äôre masterpass incredibly difficult and require a specific file as part of the password
---
Which they announced in 2014 iirc?
---
So took them 5 years.
---
I‚Äôm rather new to osrs, and I‚Äôm currently in the process of trying to gear up and prepare for bossing. Is this seriously a thing? Where the hell do you even book a time, and why is that considered an okay method?
---
Hey, I was hoping for a comment along these lines. okay, didn't know about this guy. Looks like a lot of questing but it needs to be done.
---
Thanks!
---
Do you get a lot of stuff as a female character hanging out at the GE?
---
It's a jab at people getting mad at kebos lowlands for being beneficial for low level players. This is even more ironic, because it is old ass content that is from the dawn of time.

RS is $11 per character (now. back then it was $5), and WoW is $15 for like 30 characters or something, not sure the exact number, it might be more.

More like if there weren‚Äôt any illegal immigrants being paid far below minimum wages then agriculture would collapse 
---
Upvoted for visibility. Hope you can get this issue resolved! Best of luck my friend.
---
It responds instantly. 
---
If you edit a comment within a minute or 2 after posting it wont get the edited text.
---
Going to get downvotes to hell for this but 99% of the time when this happens I believe it‚Äôs due to people who do RWT, whether it‚Äôs buying gold or account originally so you had a head start, or paying people to do content for you. It‚Äôs odd me and my 30+ friends that have played this have never lost an account, that we have started ourselves but ones that they have bought have been lost due to this. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe any of you when you say ‚ÄúJagex took my account‚Äù or ‚ÄúRandomly my account got recovered and I have Authenticator and everything! Never done RWT!‚Äù
---
Either way, my sympathies for your 5+ thousand dollars worth of gold / work and any hours you had into the account. But I don‚Äôt buy the story that it‚Äôs just randomly hacked. 
---
Real question: Can Jagex somehow put AI to combat bots?
---
Yeah there‚Äôs no reason for the guy to edit his comment, the link to the proper location was done for him
---
I'm insanely lucky and I know it makes nerds rage.
---
why does everyone believe OP, but every other thread like this everyone calls BS on? it's just because OP is well known? I for one think OP is full of sh*t.
---
Accounts being recovered is nothing new
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/Plagued/status/1059710914251948035 this guy used to do it. He recovered the accounts of mod ash wife and mod matk personal account ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Really nothing you can do against it. The recovery system is flawed.

More sources for Volcanic Ash please!
---
Probably terrible 
---
He is kind of right, I would take str bonus from obby legs over dragon personally. Plus BCP is such a minor upgrade from fighter torso there is a lot to prioritise over getting a BCP.
---
Just means it takes 5 minutes longer to make a bot account.
---
Burnt Pages, I'd like to see more sources for these as currently they are not even remotely viable to obtain, as you only get around 200 casts per hour of Wintertodt!
---
Yeah this has been covered one comment down.
---
you can also sell the shield, use it for ring when you got enough and just use dhide shield which is much cheaper than arma book
---
I got hacked recently too brother - same as you, through 2fa on account and email, a unique password, and I have never clicked a dodgy link. Luckily they didn‚Äôt get through my bank pin - let‚Äôs hope the same is true for you. Good luck 
---
You're just scared that it can happen to you as well. I don't see how buying gold would risk an account. All you do is meet someone in game and trade.
---
It really sounds like someone at Jagex might be doing this... It happened before.
---
Lore: Shamans drop DWH because Shamans have DWH. I'm so immersed. 
---
Did the exact same thing to all the patches as well. They looked too good to not do it.
---
They're used all the time, bracelets have been one of the biggest buff Slayer in OSRS ever have gotten. Being able to extend good tasks and shorten bad tasks is a huge deal, and you can do all this for a few k gp.
---
Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I feel a lot of these suggestions cater mainly for Ironmen? Dropping items they‚Äôre a pain to collect which don‚Äôt hold much value? I‚Äôm a main and I love slayer, I also love the rare random chance of a valuable drop. I think a good compromise would be adding these drops like volcanic ash and secondaries as a random 100k boost to task, but to also add the rare and very rare chance at 1-2m and 2m+, respectively? 
---
Kinda liking the idea of having a minimum 24 hour delay on password resets and recovery attempts.  Atleast send an email or a text to the user and lock the account during that time.  Sure it'll inconvenience legitimate recoveries but its only 24 hours of not being able to play the game and it might be able to stop tons of account hijackings. 
---
Because account security is as strong as you make it. Don't use third party sites with the same email. That's how they get you modt of the time.
---
I think a lot fewer people recharge glories in deep wild than people would access the Konar drop table though
---
Hadn't shown up before I commented, no to be passive aggressive bud, just trying to help ;) 
---
Yeah because 5k air runes is such a good drop
---
You must have leaked the info somehow. Hacking isn't something magical that can bypass the measures that are in place.
---
I think we can all agree that, whether you are for or against something, there's gotta be a better way to present your side of the argument.
---
Y would you even bother with that at 17 qp anyway 
---
Like what 
---
Zammy wines aren't worthless, and im sure they would keep the average drop price the same.
---
Bump. All good ideas.
---
1. Sell your seeds to someone who will plant them. 
---
2. Buy herbs from someone who plants seeds.

---
3. ?????

4. Everyone happy
---
Can we add noted Alchemical Hydra bones to the elite Kourend diary (only from the boss)?
---
Currently it is possible to get many kills in one trip at the alchemical hydra and with 3-10 drops per kill, inventory fills up extremely fast
---
I bet hes Malkin bank at revs.
---
Wow, that is epic B)
---
Thanks
---
Is there a construction level I should get before starting WT? Or just get a house?
---
From other comments it sounds like they social-engineered his PIN or he managed to accidentally show it on stream.
---
What would Jagex‚Äôs motivation be to get rid of high tier players, and in this case a streamer? Who is promoting their game, and does high level content and has 1000‚Äôs of hours in the game. Just curious. There is only negative outcomes to that. 
---
It's not intended to sound passive agressive but I can see how it comes off that way, my bad.
---
There‚Äôs also a documentary/making of on YouTube iirc 
---
I got hacked once and they were in and out of my account in 15 mins. Somehow got my pin...no clue how. Crazy...
---
Also when buying gold you give away a lot of personal information. Card number, name etc 
---
Hey Nels. Your brother told me the bad news. I hope you get this all figured out. Maybe worst case you could start an iron man like him. But with jagex's shit security that might be for naught too. Best of luck
---
Rcb and diamond bolts for jad ez
---
265m
---
all of the good damage spells pretty much are either locked off as wrath spells, the use for other elemental spells besides fire is kinda pointless as well, tho what I asked for doesn't relate to that.
---
I would like to see a buff to at least making monsters have a elemental weakness component to make using say earth or water spells at least as good as the fire spell.
---
Say for instance if Aviansies had earth weakness and a With Fire Waves max hit of 16, Earth Wave could hit up to 20, likewise fire wave against a fire weak monster like say moss giant could hit up to 20
---
Sorry you had to find out this way lad, but you got juked big time. 
---
Lol yeah I was fishing and it slipped üòÇ
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even think of releasing all your pets, I‚Äôll get right on that.
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
trough
---
For someone finding good advice rude you sure don't know how to watch your tone, junior.
---
"ez"
---
meanwhile 2 hr run later
---
Woox's guide didnt't really help me except he told me the math on the gp/rates, He really puts effort into his work.
---
Haha cringe
---
but generally you just move 1/3 of the map, you only need to know general positioning for melee and not standing in clouds which is somewhat self explanatory. 
---
&gt; we can sell our pets. Useless fucks take up bank space and look stupid.
---
See this
---
&gt; You care about pixel pets more than you healthily should
---
I'm not being retarded right now.  Plus nice stealth edit from your brash comment.  Your trolling is remarkably terrible.
---
When this happened to me I got hurr durr don‚Äôt click on links hurr durr 2 step, jagex doesn‚Äôt have a good system, I wish you all the best getting your account back. 
---
if your goal is ''i want 3 billion bank'' then yes. you burnout. if you set realistic goals and way to get to them you can love the game.
---
I wante d a tbow so i reached 1.1b bank. but by the time i got there i had so many side goals not dont i couldnt sell my shit for the bow. i still play to this day 1 yr later
---
Id prefer it be unlimited with no charging unless they give us more bank space tbh. Last update gave us 30+ more items. Getting hard to keep what you need
---
seconding this, bp + rigour with only addy darts I usually avg around 2min kills
---
Nah the original bracelets are the OP part
---
If Warding doesn't pass a poll, what will you guys do instead?
---
Achievement flair lol
---
you will be seeing alot of these in the future
---
They are not needed at all. If they disappeared overnight, prices would adjust accordingly and certain skilling methods would become way more profitable than they are now and people would do them. Easy supply and demand
---
Absolutely not
---
Nah man, he don't want the loan.
---
But since you're in the spirit of giving, in case he changes his mind, I'll hold onto it for him. &lt;3 
---
No :(
---
I see you at seers bank all the time dude v sad :(
---
Anyone have that video of B0aty reacting to his display?
---
I heard that Jagex doesnt allow normal recovery on accounts of popular players. 
---
Tried closed battlenet about a year ago, and within 5 minutes I was spammed, whispered, joined by tens of advertising bots. Uninstalled after ignoring didn't do shit because there were way too many bots 
---
What spell
---
Because they have access to jagex mods with a flick of the wrist. If you got their account they would have it locked in minutes meaning at best u got what was in there inventories. Alternatively they could just release their password on stream the second it happened and the mass log In attempts would lock it instantly I believe.
---
Efficient hunter at high lvl is 0t black chins 
---

Buying a house with your GF at 19? Enjoy the nightmare that ensues when you inevitably break up

Probably get less than 10% for that imo

How did they know your pin? That should be the one thing that is in your head, and nobody could possibly know unless they were a jmod?

Just wait til you say some people don't make money from slayer

Hmmm I wonder what the barley blurred item is in the thumbnail. ah its rune plateskirt g in the thumbnail very obvious. no need to watch the vid now. Take this as a tip, this is what most people think.

Of course DNA is complex, as is the brain. But we can not change a person's sex. There is male, female, and genetic mistake. If there is a genetic mistake, we can do our best to remedy that, but mutilating and ruining the body isn't the way to do it.

This also says nothing of the transtrenders who follow their peers or are pressured into transitioning without need only to end up hating themselves and neck roping.

Yeah and if there wasn't any radiation in space the sky wouldn't be blue. Asking people not to put a real world value on something that takes real world time to attain is useless, I really feel we need some other form of attack, though I've no idea what that is.

I think Jiggleflux was on the right track with bonds, trying to bring the money home, but if you're already sold on buying GP you probably are going to go for black market options because they're cheaper.

I wish they'd just stick to destroying our economy through botting and not destroying our morale by having our accounts permanently locked.

You think that they would continue to allow that after that kind of a breach? Logically I would think they would make it so it could never happen like that again. It seriously damaged their reputation, so I would assume adjustments were made. I don‚Äôt have evidence of that either but I can seem to believe they would just get rid of him and put someone in his place and say ‚Äúokay now don‚Äôt do that‚Äù without adding extra precautions
---
Doesn't look like 8.8 perhaps 8.5 at best
---
Quests give you a good chunk of starter XP. For example, completing Waterfall Quest will take you from 1-30 in both Attack and Strength and completing The Knight's Sword will take you from 1-29 Smithing. That would take hours if you were to grind the usual low level training methods like killing cows and making bronze armour.
---
If you're not worried about efficiency then wear whatever you want, efficiency is irrelevant when you're bored playing the game. But if you want to be efficient then you shouldn't be worried about def bonus beyond lvl 70 defense, dps is all you need to worry about. Sure you may be less likely to take damage per hit during say a slayer task with higher def bonus, but it'll take longer to complete the task and you'll probably end up taking more damage in the extra time it takes to do it anyway. More dps = tasks done faster = better xp rates = faster progress. The only time def bonus is relevant in slayer/pvm is against opponents who use magic based attacks like bloodvelds or aberrant spectres because they'll rip you a new pooper without decent def bonus. 
---
As a HCIM, that a dream clue, Id love to have full Amra blessed d‚Äôhide.
---
That's a good idea. Much more viable than an *area* locked IM. There's lots of variety in F2P areas, and utilising it as a member sounds fun. I'd watch that if it were a youtube series.

Wouldnt frem rings still be better because theyd give higher stat when imbued tho?
---
Dank.
---
what do you mean "better"? that's entirely subjective. for example, if youre going for mining efficiency then blast mining, although significantly more expensive, is much better than gem rock mining. the only reason you'd go to gem rocks is if you had the karamja hard diaries done which is the only way to get the rates you've mentioned. with requirements like 100cb I doubt a low-mid level player can do this. 
---
in terms of cannoning, its gunna cost way more than 1m to get 70 slayer. thats barely more than 5k cannonballs which will last maybe 5-7 tasks. your numbers and methods are just unrealistic for someone with the presented stats. 
---
Best of luck Nelsi! Hope everything turns out well for you
---
Ive been doing this since like 10KC on release day, immediately noticed it was DEFINITELY faster (on average) than just darts or just DHCB w/ diamond switch. Sometimes would use D darts for last 30% since cost would be minimal with how few darts you actually lose per kill. Also is obviously more profit than using strictly BP, havent done the math though. Was doing only BP with rune darts today and while the fastest kill was roughly similar, I get far more 2 min-2:15 kill times which isnt too far off what people average with T-bow.
---
If you would have done an hour of a mid-level money maker such as Blast Furnace for an hour or two a day for the week you could have easily made more than enough GP to start funding membership through bonds. 
---
Took me 3k tokens for just bronze. 1k tokens for iron then the rest came fast as hell. My dragon d was the third drop so that made up for it.

The amount of money these botters make is well, well above average salary. Especially the Zulrah botters.

Saving up millions for a bond isn't really a viable option for low-level players. I did it for months and it seemed like I only played enough to afford the next bond, and was too burnt out from that to actually play the game.

I do agree that it's a pain in the ass compared to much of the rest of the game, but at least you don't have to take a boat there every time like I used to think.

All accounts are beautiful
---
Here's the problem, average user wouldn't even remember half of this stuff for older accounts and so many of the details can be gleamed from outside if there is any compromised Ip addresses etc.
---
Its good to know that you guys dealt with the Main account in this scenario, as I've been hijacked in the past on my old account in Rs3 and the main account involved with it was clear I even was able to provide the information, but Jagex at the time refused to do anything about it despite me being persistent at very least wanting to see this person punished.  (Was java driveby'd got bank pin etc like 8-9 years ago)
---
That's addressing a symptom of the problem. Authenticator shouldn't be able to be removed through email. Thats a security flaw
---
So basically you had a stalker... stalking you for maybe years collecting pieces of information little by little until they could break into your account... Any idea who that may have been?
---
Yeah I read it wrong, my bad

Are you able to explain how these people seem to be able to get through pins this quickly?
---
Over and over and over people are being hacked and the hackers get right through the pin. Surely it can't be a rat / virus taking screenshots of the pin being inputted every time? Did this person have their birthdate as a pin or something silly?
---
Does recovering or changing email reset a pin?

I've always felt like the pin should be the absolute strongest part of security, so I don't simply understand this at all.

The fact that there is in-game 'adverts' on a members account, that im already paying for, notifying me or hinting to me that i could progress faster if I spend 'X' amount of money on some BS, annoys the hell out of me. 
---
I get that these buisnesses want to make more money, but i believe they would make more money if they focused on the actual game experience, than monetization. Annoying the majority of people that dont like the MTX marketing BS just seems so backwards to me.
---
I would rather companies implement it in a more subtle way. It would show they care more about the game and the image of the game than the corporate greed i feel when i see menus plastered with shit. I would be lying if i say ive never spent money on MTX, Im happy to spend my money if I feel its worth it to me. Also when I do fancy spending my money I would rather browse the store than click on some BS advert link.
---
It just baffles me why companies think this is a good decision for the game. When there is so much controversy on the subject.

I mean if you have 100+ cb, 90 herb and high farming than you can be a prepper for raiding groups that are looking for alts. Odds are you won't get very many points though, around 10k or so, raids 1 content is like 95% combat.

You‚Äôre probably around or under droprate. It‚Äôs a 1/1000 chance to get ranger boots. So, depending on how many items you get (3-5) it will be 1/333, 1/250, or 1/200.

While that is true, it is semantics for what my meaning was. Jagex regularly calls people the 'owner' of accounts.

You do realise by him saying "Now, we are not without blame here" he is saying that it is his partially his fault? His post fully recognizes that part of the blame is on Jagex. Both the quotes you chose both say that Jagex is part of the blame.
---
Wrong calculations. Rangers have a 1/1034 chance per slot. On average you get 4 rolls/med clue. Rangers have an average chance of 1/258.5 upon opening a medium clue. None of that 333/250/200 bullshit.

All the games on this list are steam games (which is a unique gaming platform) and then he just added both rs07 and rs3 to the list to compare the amounts of players in these games. WoW is on battle.net and League is on its own launcher made by riot games which means they aren't showing on this steam game list.

I started an iroman recently and I just do skills whenever I need them for a quest. I did most of the combat xp quests early because I just want to do slayer and barrows. Got to around 50 attack then just did chaos druids for 60 att banking the herbs for herblore. When I get 30 herb I'm gonna do all easy diaries and use xp on herb after that it's slayer and kingdom for herb. For early con levels I picked up planks near Barb assault, I'd suggest doing that untill u can make teak stuff (get teak logs from kingdom). Pro tip for hcim: do lost tribe for ring of life. If you have the patience for it, doing agil untill full graceful and then pyramid to 70 gives u decent amount of cash. And graceful is very nice for quests and stuff.

You realize that no account is unhackable to some extent.

They even gave a detailed reply to what happened which is something no company goes out of their way for. And why are you more angry than OP lol

There are lots of good ways to make money for bonds without having to play too much. Herb runs, battlestaffs and kingdom is a great help, but yeah I defo think it‚Äôs worth buying at least that first bond as f2p moneymakers are pretty awful

Konar doesn't need more seed or herb drops. It needs more uniques! Maybe it's time to introduce a new tier of Clue Scrolls: **Grandmaster**. And what's a better opportunity than seizing **Konar's** drop table!? Make Konar's tasks drop GM Clues, at a common rate, off her special table. It could be interesting to see which kind of tasks these make people perform and which kind of brand new rewards they could give, e.g. *Spirit Shields' ornament kits*. Designing new clues &amp; rewards could be the bigger job... but perhaps it'd really enhance the already great start of 2019.
---
&gt; With 5b, how many months of Bonds could he buy??? More than 1 month, thats for sure
---
That's not really the point. They didn't really have to give him anything else. OP never asked for any sort of goodwill gesture, he even said in a below comment he appreciates it. This is something nice that they've given him, stop being picky and stick to lurking.

Eclectics. Not very efficient at all since I bought them from GE. I had seen people catch the imps or whatever for the jars and thats how they did medium clues so I was gonna do the same on this account at some point but I made a little cash early on from low level wildy slayer and bought some jars on my alt. Thankfully I lucked out big time. Was not viable at all the way i was doing clues either lol I didnt have much transportation cause I didn't really train anything at all on the acc. I had plans to do so in the future but I didnt expect to get rangers so fast. That was in my first week or so or playing too.
---
But then you post about it on Reddit 
---
i have seen that title in porn before
---
My RS3 account got hacked and nothing ever happened.
---
Can drakes be buffed somehow, they are painfully long to kill with mediocre drops and unique which are not too useful, i know they can be cannon'd but perhaps lower their defense to make them easier to kill but have the slayer only area not cannon able? for a 84 slayer lvl monster they are very underwhelming
---
I think that OS needs to meet in the middle of toolbelts in rs3 and having to carry things in OS. Personally it does not bother me much as the only tools I use often is the spade, rake, magic secuteurs (equitable) and seed dibber, also all of which can easily be stored in the tool leprechauns.  
---
I think Jagexs current idea is making tools equipable, seen in the recent kebos fishing update but you have to work for them. A few more items would be great to have in the future, like a equippable small net.  
---
The ultimate Chad.
---
tbh if they do buff justiciar i hope they either increase defensive stats or buff damage soak instead of trying to make it dps AND tank armor. its already the best tank armor in the game there just isnt that many places where tanking is useful.
---
Congrats dude!
---
I mean i agree the way he communicated it was a bit shitty but generally people give out advice to help other people because they generally appreciate the knowledge, and he's basically right anyway
---
Unless you just have the extra cash to burn on both tassets and bcp it's a waste of money to have a bcp, since you could use the money for so many other things and have basically the same bonus from fighter torso (whilst defence is helpful, strength bonus matters much more than defence bonus. It's why berserker ring costs 3.5m and the granite ring only costs like 60k)
---
Also side note if you're buying gold like you seem to be admitting in some other comments, if it's not through bonds I'd stop and probably go as far as to drop any items you bought with bought gold gold/gold itself you bought from 3rd party sites because if it's not through bonds it'll get you banned permanently
---
He brought it up
---
Just grab a dragon longsword, and attached it to the broom extension front he Frankenstrain quest. Bada Bing Bada Boom.
---
I'm guessing they put all of their accomplishments in the same tab. Most HCIM do that when they die but they usually throw it in their inventory. Since he had a lot of rare and impressive HCIM items they would not have fit and so a bank tab is the best way to show.
---
Lol I honestly don‚Äôt know how people try and defend these 1k total accounts with full bandos, obby cape and 30 quest points. If that‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs main account he **100%** bought gold lmao 
---
They don‚Äôt do this, runescape although is probably leading in bot detection. I know this isn‚Äôt quite relevant but if your account is hacked and all the wealth is removed as well as the fact the account isn‚Äôt recovered the account will inevitably be botted on to produce more gold.
---
Now, speaking from someone who doesn‚Äôt bot because I love this community, but I do work as a programmer and I have seen the source code for a lot bots and these are novice level scripts they have sometimes somewhat (although poorly written) advanced scripts that make it harder for the bot detection system to detect. 
---
Jagex‚Äôs system is not flawed I would say as how the bots play the game is very similar as to how a normal person would play the game, by that I mean click in a random spot within the click circumference of the object the bot is trying to click. The only way to truly deny bots is if you were to watch them in real time.
---
To go back to your original question although jagex‚Äôs system is not perfect by any means but there a lot of systems in place to prevent account hijacking for example, the account recovery system only fails when someone‚Äôs question is easy to guess or retrieve an answer too for example.  That‚Äôs why the question is just as important as the password to your account.
---
Holy shit you unironcally want wings in posts.
---
Guess I'm going to have to explain this simply for you, if everyone is trying the new content, there is more of what ever that content gives in the game and less doing what they would normally do to take them out... So the market goes down. But will come back up. Compound that with market sentiment, where everyone think they will now get cheaper herbs as they think the new vol of herbs will bring the price down the number of buyers drops , untill a dip is seen.

Konar's table doesn't need more seeds. It needs more uniques! Maybe it's time to introduce a new tier of Clue Scrolls: **Grandmaster**. And what's a better opportunity than seizing **Konar's** drop table!? Make Konar's tasks drop GM Clues, at a common rate, off her special table. It could be interesting to see which kind of tasks these make people perform and which kind of brand new rewards they could give, e.g. *Spirit Shields' ornament kits*. Designing new clues &amp; rewards could be the bigger job... but perhaps it'd really enhance the already great start of 2019.

You say no pay, but I swear he occasionally siphons out a spade for himself. And then when I turn up wanting it back, he says I never put it in to begin with.

People can do whatever they fuck they want you fucking nob-goblin.

Appreciate the feedback

What is wrong? You received 10 times the amount you asked for, I'd say that is a great deal.

Just chirpin' you m8, you're alright.

I hate it when that happens.

Why the fuck don‚Äôt you just put a delay on removing the Authenticator? All this would be solved. Jesus.
---
maybe I misread but d2 still is run by bots, everyone bots. bnet is just a botfest.
---
You said it, man.
---
Both are bad options but justiciar is ofc better
---
I like exploring different areas in the game (shock horror, filthy casual that doesn't worry about xp rates and doesn't even have a 99 in 2019) and I enjoy the anticipation of getting a very valuable drop even if it's incredibly rare, I just think that adding a ridiculous amount of herbs/brews isn't the right way to go about it. Then again, not even 90 slayer let alone 95 so my opinion doesn't particularly matter

Ok sorry. Netflix make Runescape joke. Netflix good.
---
i find it funny people are talking shit about this dude buying bonds like idk why people care he is not hurting anyone
---
Why would the goblin champion challenge someone who wasn't even a champion of humans
---
Yes you can change a hard/medium task by asking for an easier one. Also you can leave things grown but unchecked and instantly complete a new contract if you have that plant in guild so if u actually wanna complete farming contracts quickly theres no reason to wait 4 days
---
We have storage in our houses. Why would you make that obsolete just because of laziness 
---
Just wish I had the same kind of RNG at bandos an hour ago...
---
It's all through bonds.  Thanks for the concern. 
---
If you had my farts, you‚Äôd be a rich man.
---
The argument that it would buff gp/hr doesn‚Äôt make sense when comparing it to normal methods that youre able to do at any time, rather than a singular slayer task from a single slayer master. You can‚Äôt just grind out 30 hours of hydra like you can vorkath
---
My point is about the drops, a boss shouldn‚Äôt be effectively locked to 6 kill trips just because it drops 10 individual items at once for some reason
---
You can actually jump onto Zuk, but the shortcut requires 110 agility and virtual levels don't count
---
And then what happened?
---
Never seen a more accurate logical sequence
---
Carry on then ;)
---
Ohhh you
---
The way he went about it is wrong, but he‚Äôs right. And stop buying gold with real $, unless bonds.

I'm just average with prayer flicking, so I figured I'd give myself some more defence. I'll maybe try with ancestral first 
---
This got me. Fuck thats hilarious
---
This so much. I like having sounds on but even with it all the way down,its still to loud to hear any videos or music playing.
---
yeah just lacks the heal spec and some dps but its viable. I barely did my fc with 99 ranged and a bp and 45 defence, so I'm worried about doing it on my 75 ranged pure with a karils crossbow ahah. Wish blowpipe was either expensive as fuck (cost equal to its value) or dirt cheap. It's such an annoying price range for how amazing it is, puts you in a conundrum. 
---
speaking of, why the fuck is it so much dps for such a cheap weapon?
---
Status Bars :)
---
holy shit i feel relevant
---
Im pretty sure this post was a hypothetical not to be taken literally. To answer the question, I‚Äôd put much more of an effort to max a little more efficiently than do what I currently do (not max). And also do Ironman before main

"just get blowpipe lol"

I don't even need a shower this morning, this post was that refreshing.

Do you not insure your valuables other than cars? If I had thousands of dollars in gold, and it got stolen, it would absolutely be covered under my homeowner's policy. 
---
My pmod status was only removed because I quitted before EoC due to inactivity. Emphasis on I was, because that means I've been in touch with all the security guides from the Pmod forums and in touch with a lot of the playerbase issues.
---
I may sound as an asshole but I've done million times more than you to support and help the community, even in osrs without the pmod status, because I know how it works due to expirience.

I love BA, wish I got xp for playing it so it didn't feel like a waste of time though

Those quests sound like a decent starting point :)

I've been AFKing dwarf cannon at caged ogres in combat area - I can't risk getting killed at all so this seems to be getting me there. Can probably melee them too :) Would you suggest getting attack &amp; strength both higher? Just 1?

Yeah there are definitely better ways to try to help people. There are some good post on about what gear to prioritise.

&gt;We have also identified the main account of the hijacker, and that has been perm banned as well.

&gt;We can see that the owner has a pending appeal to recover their

Lmao
---
The iron is shining through you. Keep it consistent, charge with bracelets like everything else (suffering etc)
---
No shit. 
---
Seeing as you shot down their ways of dealing with issues on a case by case basis, that means you have a brand new perfect system to replace it with?
---
this is a meme
---
rip my misc brother :(
---
I keep all top pvm items i might need, i have pvp items, i have skilling items, clue items, quest items that i may potentially need, drops from slayer, drops from boss, im sitting around 800/808 items
---
\&gt; The gold removed from the hijacked account was immediately sold to black markets, our ICU team are currently tracking that wealth and have already perm banned 5 accounts linked to the RWT activity. We have also identified the main account of the hijacker, and that has been perm banned as well.   
---
Sounds like straight out of a crime series. Haha.  
---
Good work Jagex, it's good to always be reminded of the work you are doing for us. I hope you will be able to resolve and prevent such issues more often and efficiently. Keep it up!
---
God forbid you play this game for fun.
---
I would like to give a suggestion for the removal of some trees south-west of the cooking guild.  
---
This used to be a great spot for Small teams (Especially F2P Low lvl groups to PK in pvp worlds)  
---
This is a multi-combat zone. In the year 2008/2009 some trees here where removed.  
---
Is it possible to remove these trees again. As this would boost the F2P community low req pking  
---
Attached screenshot of where some trees should be gone to take advantage of the height point with your clan.  
---
This whole hill surrounded in Red is a multi-combat zone with good small clan possibilities.

Hopefully the solution is for you to alt f4 and never come back

Entirely wrong. I pay for membership so I don't have to buy bonds for my membership. I use irl money for this game, just not for the currency in-game. Not only does it feel like cheating, it also ruins the gameplay of natural progression. 
---
Just a heads up: If you can "barely afford" a blowpipe, then you can't afford a blowpipe. The weapon has a very high upkeep with darts and scales being expensive.
---
I agree completely. I don‚Äôt want it to be better than bandos for do‚Äôs I just want it better at what it does. I mean it‚Äôs kind of pointless without an ely at bandos for instance.

Yep, my homeowner's policy is fake because you say so.... /s

Digital goods are goods. If they have a fair market value, they have value.

---
Well, the post could have been serious 
---
I mean, we do - the top comment is literally the guy whose job it is to review appeals saying that the hacker didnt get in through bad account security, but due to a mistake in judgement from them. That is literally an admission of fault.
---
Still easier than climbing over the hole in the floor in Mourning's Ends Part II.
---
&gt;By that logic no account is safe. As long as more people want access to our accounts, they can get it.
---
Well.. Yes, no system is perfect. Not a single system in the world.
---
Everything is hackable or recoverable with enough information and/or knowledge of the system/account.
---
You‚Äôre right, you do sound like an asshole
---
I hear the kindle fire is pretty good. however, you can improve the battery life on your current device by lowering the FPS in the display settings in-game. lowering mine from max to 15 made a huge difference in power usage
---
this deserves gold
---
I believe the idea is a way of balancing and forcing some players out of BiS for other benefits. Lorewise, I would assume it's because duradel might not understand/know hydras since they are only in one specific location (just my guess).
---
Personally I don't mind it, and they're in the process of properly balancing Konar's rewards.
---
we should be having ID verification and approval on sign in not this terrible fucking 2step and recovery system that don't protect u in the slightest

Drift net fishing is not that bad

This response is already infinitely more involved than everything I experienced the first decade I played this game.

Please keep this up. This is precisely the level of support your playerbase needs and expects.

How do you get the tab on the side?

When you missclick the seed and accidentally plant yourself

There was a knife spawn in the house? I left and went to a bank because I forgot to bring one when I went. Damn you RuneLite for doing exactly what I told you to and not showing the names of items below a certain value

No joke, it probably has the best pet chance in the game. This or Hespori maybe.
---
My point being it takes away from their bottom line as a business
---
I believe Zulrah is what really killed Glory prices. They had already gone well below 100k, but Zulrah‚Äôs original drop table had 2 crystal keys as an ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù drop.

Yeah I figured

you do know theres 2x the amount of people subbed to this subreddit vs peak active players right? I assume a vast majority of people who play also browse this subreddit

I wasn't taking any chances bro, only bought 200 for the last 10 waves though. I read those were tough compared to the rest for which i used Addy darts ;)

i mean she is 3rd highest of 8 with the 2nd from bottom tasks ...

Keep going in and out until the 45 spawns above italy rock like here

When healers come, you can hug the italy wall, throw chins at them, run back down towards the entrance where the guy in the picture is.. kill the aggro'd healers and go back up to finish jad
---
that would be almost as dumb as you
---
How is a toolbelt really lazy though, I mean this is not taking over the entire game, really they should make a quest for it a high end quest like when they make Priff.
---
They should also make the coin pouch as well, this isn't game breaking stuff FFS, you're not going to magically get 99 everything by having these, it's just a small thing.

Wyrms are designed beautifully but need their accuracy tuned down a bit and their attack speed slowed a few ticks.

Drakes should be treated like wyverns and only given in small batches.

1 ban = perma ban but nah nice

That's a problem why? Every sceptre will be in someone's bank somewhere
---
Unlikely that you‚Äôll do it with 81 range, with 99 and addy darts I got him to about 30 health before they started healing him too much for me to kill, had to kill 1 or 2 of them. Maybe with rune or dragon darts, but you‚Äôre probably better off just tagging them
---
I wish I could see this live in game

The jump isn't that large. We had over 100k people online every week before mobile release.

You can immediately resell gold to a gold seller, far quicker than you can sell a car. 
---
You dont hear about people getting money back from insurance for stolen gold because almost no one has enough gold to be of any importance. Thats why I started my posts with if i had thousands of dollars of....
---
People steal shit all the time. If someone walks off with my garden hose while im at work, its covered by my homeowner's policy. Its not worth enough to actually file a claim over, because its a headache, could make my rates go up, and wouldnt be over the deductible amount. Its the same thing with gold. If someone hacked my ironman and stole my ... like 20m in gold... its not worth it the same as if someone stole my garden hose. Its like 20 bucks. W/e. 
---
If i had a ten thousand dollar garden hose for god knows why... and it got stolen... things are different. 
---
yeah they insist on tip-toeing around that point you keep making
---
I actually love this, i was more talk about the value and when things drop but for what drops , yer things skillers don't make, and things that devalue what bots do. Hurts low level money makers but there is always a new low level money maker out there.
---
Void takes 6 hours for all the sets if you use the elite boat or whatever it‚Äôs called. 5 points a game and normally you never lose games, I might be off though.

Yeah back in the day the official jagex policy for your account being digitally strong armed from you was "tough shit buddy better go pick some flax"

Glad to see after all these years something finally clicked and they decided to actually do something and drop some banhammers.

&gt; It's a ridiculous expectation that people aren't going to lose a code for a video game they received one time.
---
It's guaratned they will lose it if they don't trully understand the consequences of doing so.
---
Let them know the consequences before proceeding and their behaviour will drastically change just as handling one hundred 100$ bills. People don't act stupid with 10k in their hands, do they?
---
There could be a guide for dummies like you as of ideas about how to store that key: irl paper copies at home, even at a bank in a storage, and as less secure options connected to the internet: in your phone, in a file in your pc, in a file on the internet...
---
and engine team needs more engine workers that requires some more engine work
---
q
---
Makes sense
---
so did the player get his gold back for what you admit is partially your companies error?
---
just send a bug report containing the items and prices to make jmods aware
---
Apples to oranges. The slayer bracelets degrade to dust when they reach 0 charges. Glories don't, they can be recharged for free.
---
Shut up and take my money. This would be amazing
---
They will never restore gold. The only time that will happen is if there is some kind of gamebreaking bug that is their fault and they roll the whole game back. 
---
Other than that, its on you to make your gold bad. Thankfully you still have your stats, which make that process infinitely easier. 
---
i didn't know there were people out there that actually disagreed with the idea of a auth removal delay lol
---
The marker wouldn't show if you didnt use runelite/OSbuddy

After a few more attempts you can get a BP and it‚Äôs so much easier.

Overwhelming likelihood is that you fucked up in protecting your own account.

Stick to whip and Sara sword at your level. I‚Äôd also invest in a fury and berserker ring when you can

Why no authenticator?

It will run it smoothly. I used to play on it before switching to a new phone.

Fair enough, still don't get why people must be toxic.

Because you didn't do some arbitrary amount of runs you didn't earn it even tho you did the content that drops it? Lmfao.

Him losing access to his own email and giving out enough personal info to have his account recovered IS bad account security. They are just saying they could have also done a little more themselves. This is not 100% on jagex, but they did the right thing regardless.
---
it's quite common drop and i see it as a item what nobody buys. maybe for pvp but well as being ironman i dont care about pvp

The hacker had:

- password
---
- creation date
---
- creation isp
---
- creation location
---
- post code
---
- historic passwords
---
None of that is Jagex's fault. That's the OP's fault for being so careless. Even then, look at it from the other side - if your account had been hacked and you submitted a recovery request to Jagex with all that historical information on it, wouldn't you expect the recovery to be successful?

"The rampant elitism on wikis is actually just one mistake. One small mistake that's it's what every wiki is known for including the actual wikipedia. Just a mistake. Did I mention this was a mistake yet? It's a mistake. Don't think we're actually going to change anything to the wiki though. That's a mistake."
---
I'm sure that everyone now feels more inclined to edit the wiki.
---
The content changes over the years was to prevent the game being dead content. I played when it launched, got 75 slayer and got bored very fast because there was nothing to look forward too. Whoop de do abby demons where i won't get a fuckin whip anyways (stoopid rng) 
---
Make your own rsps if you're so intent on the "Oldschool" features. You truly can be a btw and play by yourself.

Wow, it wasn't a smackdown. I regret to say im kinda dissapointed

The funny thing is that this kind of response is incredibly rare from jagex, but they knocked it out of the park this time.

nope

That was murder

You dont have to pray against drakes. I did an entire task without banking, using bandos and sgs.

the exp jump is quite significant and you harvest large enough quantities to at least get a nice junk of money back. Still much better cost/exp than trees

&gt;I have never seen anyone with something other than a dick or a pussy.
---
Because there are only 2 biological sexes, obviously. I'm sure you've seen people who do not conform to the traditional man/woman gender roles though.
---
&gt;Do you seriously think it would be fair for a man or as you would say, a "woman" to compete in any women sports?
---
No, because males (even if they have a non-traditional gender identity) have different biology than females such that they are on average stronger. But once again, we are talking about gender and not sex differences.
---
&gt;It's a fact that men are smarter than women
---
Tell that to your girlfriend lmao
---
&gt;Yes there are more feminine men or more masculine women but that's because of a condition like not producing enough testosterone.
---
Exactly, there is a spectrum of femininity/masculinity and that is part of how there can be more than 2 genders. You are just wrong about it being a condition 100% due to hormones but that certainly plays a role biologically during development
---
You seriously think it is impossible for somebody born biologically male with normal testosterone levels to have differing brain chemistry or experiences during development such that they identify as a female? Imagine this: a male is born into a family with 10 female children and raised as a girl alongside them. Up until the point of puberty/body-realization that kid has thought they were a girl 100% and developed as such. Even after realizing they are biologically different from the girls they identify with, the kid (who acts like a girl, looks like a girl, etc) will probably still identify as a girl.
---
Pretty confident saying that making konar's tasks uncannonable would make this completely dead content for almost anyone over 90 combat. Cannon and slayer go hand and hand, pretty much anyone who "hates cannon" has not actually tried doing it because they don't want to spend the initial investment on cannon + balls.
---
If anything, we need more cannonable tasks in general. Making every single task only cannonable in single combat dramatically slows down slayer. It doesn't have to be easy to unlock, but stuff like cannonable myreditch mutated velds, polli dungeon abberants, etc in their respective dungeons made slayer more varied and interesting in rs2/rs3. Obviously balance needs to be taken into account, but there's already way too many uncannonable tasks even on duradel and nieve.
---
What's the difference in an hour to aquire something irl and an hour to aquire something in game?
---
Both have value to the individual. Jagex is able to restore these things. But chooses not to.
---
Other games and companies have competent customer support and yet jagex gets a pass from people like you

I don't agree here. I understand why you'd want this but then it turns the gemstones into an either or. Having bracelets keep consistency; allow for good economy flow considering there's no 'oh do i keep this gem or turn it into a bracelet'; it wont invalid all the bracelets that currently exist cause mains will just be selling them off; gives people who craft the bracelets more incentive to do so (bigger gp/h margins). 
---
5B is literay worth thousands of dollars...
---
If your info is compromised like OPs, you're screwed. The only thing that can help is being able to change your recovery information. That is what we really need to be able to do.
---
If you secure your account and email, you shouldn't have any info. 
---
And?
---
So the majority of honest victims should be thrown out?
---
I'll repeat, other games handle this issue much better
---
Why are you giving jagex a pass?
---
&gt; show us how JAGEX gave that info away?
---
literally not a single point is answering this.
---
It's still the OP fucking up for giving so much info to a guy he met online and barely knows.
---
Auth delay wouldn't matter because he could just change the email if he wanted to, with enough info to get access to such an account he can easily recover his email too
---
Yeah it's totally Jagex's mistake that the hacker had

I don't care how the person got the info
---
If you think he just told people his password you are pretty dim
---
And an auth delay would prevent such change and would allow him to contact support and take measures to protect his account
---
Again why do you keep giving jagex a pass?
---
Rip. My internet was setup a week before i moved in and got the router on a priority delivery. My ISP know whats up!
---
You seem surprised.
---
can you make metamorphosis on cerberus so it can have 3 heads instead of 1 that would make pet look a lot cooler in my opinion
---
Oh lol ty for actually explaining it, wasnt expecting anyone to be nice enough to help me out.
---
His whole Twitter feed is cringe. Good for him for being an entrepreneur though, at what I‚Äôd assume is a very young age. 
---
Do we even really need doors tbh? Just make the patches in each area unusable without the reqs
---
thank god your authenticator avoided the account getting hijacked from a different machine... oh wait...
---
seriously, how can a company implement 2-step auth. so poorly as to make it non-necessary for login? It should be required that a user have an Auth pin in order to turn off 2-step auth. thousands of companies do this the right way
---
done like 20+ games without any piece. wont go back there before they will change game duration to less what it is atm
---
so rip rng
---
Slayer ring is already powerful enough with its teles. Let the diary reward for kebos be of some use.
---
Is that actually a real comment by surprisedropbears&gt;? You can't be serious...
---
Also known as Dragon Halberd (e)
---
The E stands for Extended 
---
Where do you book times..?
---
 Shut up and give me your money. This would be awful.
---
When did they say that? It was in one of the Q&amp;A's that they said it was a potential update. Collecting sand is 2-3k buckets an hour, not really fast.
---
Yep, also with how cheap diamond (e) bolts are I would recommend you to try with rune c bow. It is somewhat slower then blowpipe but really, not by that much and you could make an argument that it is easier to do Jad+Healer with the cbow
---
While I'm sure you are right, i personally have trouble wrapping my head around somebody buying loads of useless junk just to have.
---
I agree about all this and I do think Jagex's recovery system is way too lenient in letting people grab accounts.
---
But it's also true that pretty much all of these vulnerabilities could be prevented if OP was more careful with his account security.
---
I've never had a RS account hacked and there's a reason for that.
---
yeah, im F2P right now, lost my account a few years back and had to start from scratch in Dec. so I'm flipping scrub stuff
---
lol not on a Bondy it aint
---
My friend literally fell for this yesterday and I cant stop laughing. 
---
Art of the deal
---
Thank you, this restored a lot of my trust in this process, just seeing you take ownership and very deliberate steps. 
---
U 12?
---
Bwilli?
---
We can have additional poll to add a pixel to make it authentic.
---
The hour on the game is supposed to be fun. My hour at work isn‚Äôt bad, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a teenager half assing my job at a gas station. The gold I get from raids is merely a byproduct of having fun with friends, I‚Äôd raid even if it was a shitty moneymaker but still sustainable.
---
WoW has a good customer support because they can afford it. WoW has a new $60 expansion every year, plus $15 a month. So it‚Äôs about $240 a year to play WoW, rs is about $132. So then we consider that WoW has a much larger player base as well as its company (blizzard) makes jagex look tiny as fuck. I haven‚Äôt played WoW in years, but I‚Äôm pretty sure their wow and other games share their CS team.
---
I don‚Äôt like that RS has a shit CS team, but I also understand that I‚Äôm a part of a game that simply doesn‚Äôt have the funds that WoW has and demanding the same support makes me about as intelligent as an antivaxxar.  
---
I don't vote.
---
I‚Äôve never been hacked thanks.
---
I actually think this is a really good idea. Charge it like the ring of suffering as not to devalue other pieces of content.
---
Great idea!
---
&gt; If the account is being played from the same IP address for years and randomly an IP that looks SIMILAR
---
you're just putting random info out there now.
---
OP didn't say anything about where he played, it could easily be that he plays on his laptop, at work, at home, or at school.
---
These will all show as a new IP address to the login system, if we go by the "Don't ever accept requests unless it is from this certain IP address" then you wouldn't be able to recover accounts while you are at work, on the road, or any other place than this specific pc, which would be the dumbest thing to do from a security perspective
---
I do have members. I am just wanting f2p pvp to be more balanced. 
---
7-10 were so much fun
---
I don't frequent this sub anymore, but this post was toward the top on my front page so I checked it out. 
---
I think this is the first JMod post on one of these "hlep I get hacked" posts that actually admits there was a breach and it's being fixed. 
---
I never necessarily doubted that all the snarky "ya cheated and got banned" JMod replies were legit, but seeing this one puts those ones in a way better light. 
---
Hence why I don't go on much, that and competing with bots.
---
I have thought similar to that to, but i couldnt imagine that would be profitable enough to waste time on
---
If you have an Android you can just open it in game launcher and press the screen touch lock to get a black overlay
---
holy heck it might be!
---
Thank you for actually explaining it! There are two other comments genuinely asking if it is real and the responses are still from trolls. Cant believe how far I had to scroll to get some honesty. Ty
---
Reeeeee post
---
Jagex heavily relies on previous passwords to determine account ownership.
---
According to Jagex if you fail the automatic check you do not provide enough evidence to make even the slightest chance of getting accepted.
---
&gt; It would be a non issue if jagex delayed auth removal and contacted the account owner.
---
Here is the issue though, even if there was a delay and you would get a mail notification about it.
---
If they have so much info on your account that they can recover it, don't you think that they would just simply change the email before removing the authenticator?
---
You literally wouldn't know at that point, it would be silly to assume that if he knew previous passwords and all this info that he couldn't recover his way into the email address and do this while the original owner has no clue
---
This isn't the Wise Old Man you fuck
---
top kek
---
This is best answer. dhcb then ward afterwards (wouldn't recommend tbh unless you do nothing but vork)
---
You need to combine the shards with a d chain
---
You just admitted they aren't totally responsible and in all of your comments you're condemning Jagex when there was definite evidence the OP could have exercised more vigilance. However please realize calling other people stupid doesn't validate your arguments.. it's extremely immature.
---
Prolly gonna get downvoted, but I can‚Äôt sit by and allow this many people to actually play along when a genuine question was asked. The game is very popular as such popular places are hard to find free worlds most hours of the day. Some are considered to be even impossible at peak times. Thus the booking a time meme was created. To answer your question. No you don‚Äôt actually have to book a time to pvm that would be absolutely ridiculous.
---
I believe minimum is up to $12/hr in Massachusetts 
---
I've played it on an older Kindle Fire 7 and it ran fine with no issues. You can pick them up for $50 if you wait for a sale. 
---
I imagine he‚Äôs referring to the shutdown
---
Currently replaying FFX and really enjoying the combat system. Characters feel pretty distinct and the ability to swap characters mid-battle makes the combat feel fast paced and adds a nice tactical element.
---
Who approved the recovery despite red flags? The OP or jagex?
---
They made the decision and should offer restorative action.
---
Wow honestly, hearing this from you guys really help to change the perspective on how you treat account support.
---
No doubt there's lots more to be done (authenticator delay is a meme but please, please please have it), but this is a good step forward!
---
How can you pk with stats like that lol?? 
---
Should be that mimic helmet from the dark souls games, tongue and all.
---
What‚Äôs your RSN? I can let you borrow mine if you‚Äôd like to try. 
---
Meant zeah not ardy
---
His suggestion was more along the lines of "Hey buddy, why are you wearing two left shoes when one left shoe and one right shoe is much more comfortable and efficient". I'm sure his approach could have been better but try to see through his shitty comments and take the advice.
---
So again, because it hasn't happened to you it's not as important
---
D
---
Like the sang staff? A whole new max in melee seems a bit much - I think the staff had it to bring mage back up into the game a little, where it was behind vs range dps and melee dps. 
---
Most cases you won't get a max hit with the gloves but they +4 str vs b gloves and the attack stats are nice. A better upgrade than primordials would be to d boots at a third of the price if i'm honest.  
---
Irrelevant, talking about skill cape perks. 
---
That's usually what "free" implies. Just grab the offer and then unsub. Simple as that.
---
Once warding comes out you‚Äôll be able to deconstruct items and get their raw materials. 
---
I make like 500k each wyrm task. I even got a D harpoon drop. Free 1.7m.
---
Pretty sure its a week free when you are paying for the full month or more.
---
It does give it a +1, and a +5 on d claw spec. Source as to why you don‚Äôt think it does? 
---
Can somebody answer this guy for the love of god!! He need answers!
---
okay? Are you going to knock on every door and ask if they are LordDango? lmao
---
and I also use a VPN(which is also part of being safe BTW). 
---
It was this guy OP
---
A quest/clue where you have to get the random event to do it is a special kind of evil
---
I regret doing it at like 37. Fell 20+ times in the big area took so long. 
---
Still ez tho 
---
You don't need bank pin to see GE Trade History.
---
I'm not sure exactly, but so far (for me) her Slayer tasks have cost me more than they've awarded. I've finished ~15 tasks and I've had two 100k+ drops. Wildy Slayer was more profitable.
---
Actually, it should be possible to melee Zuk with the dinh's bulwark spec from attacking jad's healers. The radius it hits in is 11x11. Doubt you can finish the kill tho as healers also implies jad is alive and the mager/ranger timer is running.
---
I believe it's immediate if you switch under the account section on the site, but it can take days to weeks in game.
---
This same exact thing happened to me a few weeks ago I had my account hijacked and recovered it and my gold and items were all gone haven‚Äôt played since
---
I know like 10+ people who‚Äôve played as long as me and have never been hacked. They never give out info and the little they do is to people like me who they‚Äôve known for a while and trust.
---
He literally told me to "gtfo" of the world because It's "not for noobs" lmao
---
I would definitely prefer seeing it in the Wildy, but it wouldn't change the fact that it's empty. The community is why it's empty, not the location. Too much focus on efficiency-scape. This goes for all minigames that don't give rewards.
---
Short answer yes also better than gear as you dont risk losing it
---
Still not melee ONLY
---
I'd say Slayer is a bigger reason for max combat accounts.
---
In NYC for businesses with more than 10 people minimum wage is $15 now. They raised it on New Years.
---
I did some heavy botting back in the day, we had epic reflection bots. I botted my 99 Slayer while getting 99 attached, str, and def, I botted everything to lvl 99, never got caught.
---
I've never been hacked or scammed. I also have an associates in applied science in IT which includes courses in cybersecurity and have 2 certications including my Sec + and would like to think such education has helped me keep my account secure.
---
But the fact of the matter is jagex admits they we're partially responsible and needs to restore this account and they need to improve account security and customer support
---
Well I already explained how it is one of the more op skill cape perks already and how your proposed effect is redundant.
---
It is most likely ranged, due to it being fight cave 2.0, and 98% of people who does fight cave uses ranged.
---
Geordie, definitely Geordie.
---
I have 2 dpick buy orders in for the past few months. One for 1gp and 1 for 100gp. Still waiting.
---
Herb secondaries &gt; herbs, keep seeds, add cballs and volcanic ash. Alchables are boring, that‚Äôs what other tasks are for. This should feel fresh and rewarding. Not much you can kill for consistent herb secondaries outside Wildy Bosses
---
Is it? Woox said it wasn't as good.
---
If you have a magical way of obtaining enough gp for a BCP faster than it would take to get a torso, please share with the rest of us.
---
Go to the sand casino and double it
---
&gt;Looking at how many people are in the Wilderness for pking every day. Also, I have asked a couple of people who also shared my views. That's also why I am asking reddit, to see people's reactions.
---
&gt;I feel like a lot of players are bored (asking for money, botting) and need something new. 
---
If pkers wanted to be in clan wars, they would. But they don't because you don't get the same satisfaction of killing someone in a safe minigame. Also, if all those botters and beggars wanted to use clanwars, they would. Simply moving it somewhere else wouldn't solve the problem of clanwars being dead.
---
&gt;You're right on the last point, it would be very strange. But maybe worth the try..
---
My point isn't that it would be strange. It's physically impossible for the game engine
---
Being a retard like the OP and making your email and password public knowledge, I'm guessing
---
Definitely a cheaper alternative to training too.  Get pretty good xp/hr at crabs with it. 
---
Knob head
---
Best get the ol' blowing pipe out.
---
People collect them in the tens of millions.
---
Tbh  the number of names that are actually worth something that are being hoarded as you describe is pretty small.
---
If you're completely new, give the money back, as it'll only spoil you for the first bit of the game then crush your dreams when you realize you have no idea how to make money. If you're coming back to the game and want to skip some early levels, keep reading. 
---
First off, do Waterfall Quest to boost your attack and strength, then use the money to buy gear/weapons as you level up. I'd suggest buying a single inventory of dragon bones to bury at a gilded alter to get your prayer up. This should keep you in your best gear through Rune. 
---
i am thankful, so should you be. with your "**only** 2 items in not even 300kc"
---
This. Together with streamers and influencers.
---
Umm, I am looking at various farming related supplies, herbs n tree seeds mostly. Willow seeds, pineapple seeds, toadflax herbs, they are dropping in price. Why is that ? Is there something going on I am not aware of ? I actually dont know anything about the new Farming guild ? Does it have something to do with that ?
---
Getting over 60 smith 
---
Once it used. It's used. I found that out the hard way when j tried to swap names too. Even if done in the same account, if you changed your name from 'account1' to 'account2' you wouldnt be able to change back to 'account1' even on the same account.
---
So everyone should be forced to use a VPN to play runescape?
---
And yes some people do get randomly hacked, sometimes database leaks are used to gain access to accounts etc
---
It's not nearly as simple as you think 
---
Saw the original, crazy how well they overlap (with proper editing). 
---
Nothing you do will be able secure your account from a fraudulent account recovery. You can either start fresh now, or when it gets hijacked again at a later date and you have even more time in the account. 
---
Not one 
---
You are eligible to cry the second you hit 300kc with no zenyte
---
Yeh im tryna find out myself, but I swapped over to Toadflax for now =/
---
And? Why does your anectdotal evidence mean anything
---
I don't have editing software but someone should do pewdiepie reacting to an osrs clip I think it would be funny. 
---
That's a whole different argument than I was addressing. Restorative action isn't something they've done in the past, it'd be damning to start doing it now after so many other accounts were compromised.
---
Before guild: average of 70 over 7 patches.
---
after guild w/attas: average of 72 over 8 patches.
---
I feel like we got Jagex'd on this update.
---
In Alberta it‚Äôs a flat 15
---
yes OP is a knobhead for wasting everyone's time with his inability to not tell everyone he meets his life story
---
At what price point does zulrah become more profitable than vork or does it ever?
---
Mate I fucking did it! tagged all the healers in one switch and only had to prayer switch like 4 times the whole fight!
---
Barely outclasses it at the cost of scales and darts, it‚Äôs fine, if anything we need to fix tbow being broken at nearly every boss 
---
Get used to it
---
i dont see this guy as hater TBh. he was actually giving you good advice lol and imo not being rude either.
---
OwO
---
Id like it go down the rs3 route and be a requirement to wear one of the desert amulets to get the dps boost, just for variety
---
reminder that if you arent a maxed main with almost a bill bank you are shit at a childrens java game from 1945
---
(p.s. i play for fun how dare you judge me!! isnt an argument)
---
Try not getting hacked 
---
Entitled and inexperienced/uneducated players.
---
Blowpipe too OP in just about every way, that's all it is. And it's too late to Nerf it because people will reeee too hard
---
Nice name
---
no
---
Not everything is deliberate, but a lot more is than IRL I'll give you that. But yeah this seems more like a "reused asset" than deliberate placement.
---
Imagine all the high level content without using range.
---
people need to stop being idiots with their information
---
no amount of security on jagex's end will save morons from themselves
---
OoWoO
---
Tried it once back in the old days and died to jad, been too nervous to do it now on osrs.
---
Seeing these posts gives me hope though - yall reckon I can do it with 60 prayer/76 range (with blowpipe)/74 hp?
---
No one is forcing anyone to do anything. If you don't feel like protecting yourself, then that's on YOU, not Jagex.
---
If that's true, why hasn't Lynx Titan or Woox have gotten hacked yet? It's been several years since they've played. Based on your probability of "randomly hacked", shouldn't they have gotten hacked by now?
---
I fucking did it! brewed up and tanked them dirty healers!
---
Set up 2FA and email and account.
---
Don‚Äôt click on fake streams or double xp ads.
---
Most people only go to clan wars when it is time for clans/snipe teams to mini/prep? I don't think putting it in the wildy will help.  
---
Doubt [x] 
---
Lvl 63 shamans drops Dragon warhammer or what the fuck? What drugs u use, give info fast
---
No combat stats, but still have a weight
---
also says i have an active membership? which i clearly dont

I didn‚Äôt get my tanz fang until about 2100 kc which was like two days ago lol. Still grinding for the pet. At least I have the tanz mutagen.

How should I gear for KBD?
---
Who put you on the planet
---
that makes no sense. DHCB also has 30 percent damage bonus, not just accuracy. it hits 74s and 100s with ruby dragon bolts and 80s with diamond bolt e's. 
---
so if youre hitting every time with the bp youll be hitting every time with the DHCB no? 
---
It could also prevent the dropping of valuables 
---
Mfw op doesnt realize void has good magic defense. and maybe dudes low on hp. you dont know.
---
Sounds about right.
---
No.
---
Lets say for the sake of RuneCrafting in the abyss that I get pked in low-level wilderness. This means I keep my RC pouches (even if skulled)? You'd be amazed, I've been PKed carrying no items except a glory with 2 charges and some ess.
---
Could we please see an instance similar to all of the other bosses for thermy? Finding an empty world, or being constantly crashed is a problem...
---
I loved the OG Pernix, Torva and Virtus the designs looked amazing 
---
Oh, tbh, I don't care the reason, we need more people in clan wars. 
---
But are you a recent player?
---
You say that it wouldn't work in the wildy, but it was the best attraction in rs in 2008-2009, and people did wars to train themselves for pking too
---
You need to learb the definition of the word only. All melee but zuk is not melee only.
---
reported the guy, lead me to pornsite and got me virus
---
That's the mysterious old man. Why must you turn this subreddit into a house of lies?
---
Never seen this before
---
pre RS3. 
---
I definitely don't have that feature. Using a Motorola but running 8.0. guess I'll stick with battery go. 
---
This is what I wanted to know, thanks! And good luck with Groot :) 
---
Wow. You literally looked at two numbers, ignored the rest of the comment, and came up with a completely false assumption. Its so blatantly incorrect that I have no idea how you typed that out without realizing how fucking stupid you are. 
---
Can we get mystic robe sets?
---
A range next to a bank already exist in the myths guild. I think adding one in the cooking guild behind such a low requirement compared to dragonslayer2 would devalue the myths guild. 
---
 Botting and RWT is a funny thing.
---
NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE

HAH! u missed one log, Ty for account. 
---
A third of the playerbase is more people than this subreddit's sub count... theres over a million active players.
---
Follow [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) guide, questing will unlock so much content for you and gives great exp early on.
---
&gt;contacting jagex accomplish
---
It stops the hacker. If needed, Jagex could put the account into an un-recoverable status. There are quite a few high profile accounts (streamers, etc) that are un-recoverable due to their value. It puts more effort on the player to make sure they don't lose their password and 2fa, but it ensures that the account can't be given away by Jagex to a hacker who managed to gather information.
---
So I can just go on RS, see some sweet account and go and try and recover it and there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll just give it to me? 
---
I think that's what makes the game fun. To remain at minimum level the whole game and get good magics to really break the game you have to play in a pretty strange way, anyway (carding enemies, playing cards to refine into magic, petrifying everything, etc) which feels like it rewards knowledge, which is fun.
---
None of the final fantasy games are difficult, especially not if you go out of your way to make your characters strong... Whether that means grinding or avoiding combat.
---
it was a sensible chuckle the first time i saw the door denial, but when i tried to watch anyone doing quests it quickly becomes pathetic and annoying.
---
TBow is 1.1b... while blowpipe is like 6m and slightly worse than TBow.
---
I don't think Jagex wants to open themselves up to potential lawsuits, and I'm pretty sure law enforcement would not care as they have a lot more important things to focus on.
---
Woox will find a way
---
That sounds a lot better. Minimum wage hasn't kept up with the cost of living and I'm happy something's being done about it 
---
Chillax man, no one is calling you out. You're being hyper-sensitive over a tiny little thing. Not everyone knows the magic tree xp off the top of their head. 
---
In public? 
---
Fixed, thanks! 
---
Yes i've been pking/clanning on/off since I honestly can't tell you wen. You don't get what I'm saying.  If people wanted to go to clan wars they would.  Putting it in the wildy won't bring more people as the people that want to go go in clans or snipe teams already. there isn't much point for it besides that.  
---
No I mean it's impossible to have  a structure in a particular place on one world, and not have it there in another 
---
Are you still doing this, I missed the first day but I‚Äôm clueless at the raids lol tried soloing and it didn‚Äôt work out
---
Fuuuck I had completely forgotten about those bastards 
---
I was on a low level Ironman and I decided I was going to do mining and smithing. I spent a long time mining a bunch of ore and then smithing it and making armor to sell and make money. I guess I could see why this would seem bottish but I didn‚Äôt realize that just skilling  like this get syou banned
---
Fuck rip mike
---
It was an example. The LoL sub has around 1% but it's still relevant enough that riot staff regularly visit/post there
---
It's OP! *twilight zone theme*
---
Again, tbow costs nothing to use 
---
This is completely false
---
Put a :) after every in game message. 
---
tob? olm hands?
---
That's not true on day of release of ToB they did help return items to players who lost valuable items due to a glitch, one was even an iron man.
---
Magic barriers in a farming guild wouldn't make the guild unplayable in my opinion. I don't think thats a strong enough reason why not to add something like this that fixes the bottlenecking traffic issue.
---
i appreciate it, i don't have a twitter
---
Millennials and their phones 
---
I can picture you stroking your neckbeard chuckling at this as you typed it 
---
Mulkku
---
Its possible, especially if you know a little about the holder. This leaves a huge vulnerabliity to clan mates, for example. Information like location, what ISP you use, when you started playing, etc. which are not private can be used to recover accounts, bypassing private info like passwords and email credentials, as well as bypassing the entirety of the 2FA system. 
---
Ever talk with a clan member about runescape on discord? They can probably recover your account with that info. 
---
If we count out the fact that they're the most trivial step of Elites with a solver...sure.
---
Original meme lmao;!!!  
---
The thing is, even with an authentificator on your Runescape account, if they can access your E-Mail, they can instantly disable it, an authentificator on your E-mail will stop them from accessing that, so you should be totally fine, yes.
---
Then they just die repeatedly. So then you need to add wilderness entry checks at every point. They went through the same issues with death mechanics in rs3 before resulting in the current system.  
---
Because where do you think the seeds come from?
---
Can't wait for the meme from this.
---
Account recovery will remove 2FA without access to your email account. 
---
:D
---
I've got 533 hydra kc, 2 eyes,1 fang, 1 heart, 1 tail. BTW  
---
Thats not true. Several bosses require melee or mage. Tob is almost no range, cox is heavily ranged based, but also requires a heavy amount of melee and some magic. Cerberus is best with melee. Zulrah relies heavily on magic. Slayer is done almost exclusively with melee/magic. 2/4 gwd bosses are generally meleed or have at least 1 meleer in the team, and even duo sara is often meleed using the southwall method
---
But in general melee is tanky and has the best spec weapons and is cheap to use.
---
Mage is utility such as multi target attacks, healing, freezing, venging, etc
---
Range is high dps but takes more damage than melee and is expensive to use
---
Overall every skill becomes necessary for high-end pvm. I also think one of the reasons range is favored by Jagex for high level bosses is it allows them to be more creative with mechanics since they can force you to posistion yourself in a way that feels smoother than similair mechanics using melee. Most bosses that rely on melee (bandos/corp) end up being a just smack it till it dies and eat food when you need to kind of fight.
---
Same. It's so weird that they see all of these posts and don't make a PSA or something. It makes me think that they are secretly working on updating the recovery system. Idk why it would have to be a secret but I refuse to believe that they are simply ignoring the community.
---
Yeah I was thinking maybe Joe trying Jad or something, but I'm not sure if I can find good clips for it.
---
They did? I wasn't around when that happened I guess. AFAIK they have always taken the stance to fuck everyone when being hacked / glitch
---
You added a unique mystic coloring to drop table, how about a unique rune armor variant and ranged variant?
---
Or Long Long Man.
---
Everything hits 100 with ruby bolt spec if the enemy has enough hp left, the spec hit is based on remaining enemy hp and caps at 100. You still hit 100 with a rune cbow firing ruby tipped addy bolts
---
Also unless im wrong the diamond bolt spec ignores their ranged defence so it would do practically nothing different to a normal bolt if they had low ranged defence to begin with
---
Even though a non Ironman literally runs to the ge and sells the drop making whatever it is completely useless except for ironmen 
---
I just love how apeshit Joe goes over those russians, so I had to put the clip to good use.
---
Now that I think about it you might be right, it'd be probably the best thing for everyone if they were quiet about it. Thus not giving hackers and whatnot a headstart. I guess we all have to hope they're really doing something about it.
---
Right? They need to take a page from that farmersonly website. Think they allow simple gardeners? No. If they did that place would become a pigsty real fast. 
---
2 factor authentication. Set up on email and RuneScape account. Also bank pin, recovery questions and a difficult password. Maybe even change your email associated with the account
---
Not sure how well you'll be able to PK on anything that's not a laptop/desktop... Best advice anyone can give is probably practice and figure out what works best for you
---
I've went from losing 500k-1m per session to making over 2m per session after a month or two of learning.  My account doesn't have barrage or maxed stats for the level, so you can learn along the way to reaching a good PK build.  All you got to do is keep PKing and you'll learn from your mistakes because they can get preeettyy expensive 
---
yeah my first task is 134 wyrms at lvl 95, very slow task that i am not enjoying at all.
---
I wonder what would happen if a DFS spec was used. 
---
that wouldnt solve the problem. you can still trade items to yourself or tell the client you are trading items at prices which you aren't actually trading them at.
---
The bug didn't add any extra items to the game. IIRC ToB has this staff you need in order to beat the final boss. If you died with the staff in your inventory it would drop to the ground. There was a bug however that instead of the staff dropping a random item of yours would drop on the ground instead of being in your death chest at the end. and Ironman lost a ACB i believe and it was returned to him.
---
Try selling those Wyrm bones then
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if he didn‚Äôt have awful game knowledge and then think he‚Äôs right when people are giving him legitimate advice. 
---
It was okay
---
Imagine telling someone how they're suppose to play an online videogame in 2019.
---
What are your combat, range and prayer stats?
---
What was your load out?
---
I did this way back when OSRS came out and it looks like that blowpipe thing makes this a lot simpler.
---
I'm actively keeping track of all herbs I get since the update.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/afv7jp/netflix_knows_how_we_roll/
---
Here we go again..
---
I'm I the only one sick of xp boosting gear and shit like graceful because everyone always looks the same?
---
Been this way for a while I think
---
Fair enough, helps that its free :). They do "leagues" every 3-4 months that introduce large new pieces of content. Each new league requires that you start over with a new character (and characters from past seasons roll into a 'standard' league with last leagues patches). 
---
To best experience the game/community i'd recommend starting at the beginning of a league. Since betrayal started early December it Looks like that will be March-April.
---
How many scales do you think you'll need for fight caves if you have just the bare minimum range of 75?
---
basically same thing im using except glory ammy, and im getting wailed on by wyrms
---
Lmao I just watched this while afking slayer
---
They're not going to put an average players account in a non-recoverable status. Don't fool yourself. Content creators make money for Jagex so they will take care of them. Zezima or lynx titan will never get recovered because of their status as well to the game.
---
Jagex doesn't care about "slayerman247" enough to do that. That's because they will stop playing forget their login info and email/make a reddit post to them saying I'm the real slayerman247 I just forgot my login. 
---
First things first, we need to be able to change our recovery questions, that would lock out anyone who only knows the previous answers. 
---
You should try farming contracts, they're a nice little break from whatever you're doing and can make you a bit of money
---
Not sure if you're attempting to make a joke.
---
Yeah... they managed to catch me. Twice. I tried botting on RS3 a few years ago, got caught and issued a 1-month ban and a warning that next time would be permanent. Started playing OSRS when mobile came out but still played RS3 every now and then. Started botting a little in OSRS, finally got to Invention in RS3 (requiring 80s in Crafting, Smithing, and Divination). Got caught botting in OSRS. RIP me.
---
Support, Mr. Mordaut is best daddy.
---
keepass has an autotype feature that works for OSRS beautifully.
---
If its easy to guess then thats on the user then. Why would you make a pin thats easy to guess? 
---
Yeah all of your scenarios arent realistic at all and maybe will apply for .000001% of the player base. 
---
Im not saying you arent making any sense. What im saying is you are bullshitting if you think these scenarios are very common.
---
Yeah it can, I haven't done hydra but if I did, I would switch after the boss died and bury stuff manually. There's this 8 second cool down thing. Granted, you might want to wear it through the whole kill because of the massive prayer bonus but I'm not sure. 
---
You get roughly 8 prayer points a kill (4 points per bone)
---
I tried to appeal and received an automated email back saying I can in no way appeal for this type of ban and that I should feel free to create a new account. Honestly I‚Äôve tried it multiple times but I can‚Äôt even seem to explain the situation.
---
Genuine hatred seeps from my soul
---
Not so much afk since activity bar change. It does require much less attention than BA though. But I personally would rather have the option of playing more focused, but getting more points.
---
Make some clue stashes
---
Gotcha thanks for the reply
---
You have a lot of the suggestions from above that I enjoyed the most.
---
Cannonballs, planks, orbs.
---
Lol u playing lights hope?
---
You shouldnt have to keep chugging staminas like that. Make sure you drink the first dose at around 80% run and it should sustain you at well over 50% for the duration of the trip. 
---
Anything over a couple k you should probably just alch if you can't sell it for a good price.
---
I'm only 25 farming, and never trained it before outside of quests/exp lamps. I have no idea how to even go about doing  it honestly :P
---
I can't speak for tob, so I won't.  CoX requires all three styles so its not an applicable argument.  Cerb can be done with range without a drastic difference with melee, Zulrah is farmed with strictly ranged for several streamers I've noticed, but again no melee.  GWD bosses require a tank, sure, but that isn't the argument unless you're talking strictly about soloing.
---
Its not about having every skill required, the argument is that range is significantly superior to melee, and the fact that you cannot use melee on this fight is a poorly designed (and lazy) fight.  At least with jad you could melee, higher risk but still doable, but now with blowpipe/TB/Arma Cbow its not even worth it.
---
im 3k slayer points dry of my first hydra task :/
---
It's also super noticeable when their name isn't anything relatively thought out at all, it's just fuckin ZQ1937al278 or some shit
---
Oh that's lame
---
That is the meta. 
---
Use a Karil‚Äôs crossbow
---
This sounds like a great intro to a short story.
---
Oh really? Holy crap that's awesome, will try that out soon!
---
Thanks!!
---
That being said, pasting in the password field would be nice regardless, in case a password manager doesn't support auto-typing. 
---
Rebuilds tend to be easy if you got high combat levels especially in range. I see so many ppl get hacked and just give up. Well done op
---
No blowpipe is the most retardedly OP item but KCB is still good.
---
i booked kree arra for 2 hours today 2 weeks ago and i paid the guy 1m but he scammed me, he sold the spot to another guy for more, fortunately the guy let me in for a few kills
---
only book at the offcial booking office
---
you want to wear double dhide, you want to only use diamond bolts.
---
You should be able to get 1 stam kills at 99 range+rigour on avg. below this 2. if you are running out of run energy you are drinking your stam too late or wasting run energy post-zily kill. drink stam at start of kill once runs below 80.
---
It depends so much on the player. But the general rule of thumb is to just block tasks that you don't do that are most common(high weighting). So on duradel you aren't supposed to block waterfiends even though they are probably the worst task. They are so uncommon that it is better to skip them
---
Pray flicked up to wave 31, flinched 360s and would lure most monsters behind the 360s while they died and then finish the wave similar to a non 360 wave. For jad I stayed md but nothing else too fancy.
---
Also a lot of hp restoring for several hours (I even did another fire cape run on my alt at one point to practice melee jad as It's something I've never done before).
---
56 agility won't take you long at all and graceful is insanely useful. I'd say the higher the agility the better before doing Underground Pass anyways
---
why are suicide jokes so common nowadays? I always found them sad
---
I mean at that point just lock the account. You can keep trying to jump through bigger hoops, but at the end of the day EVEN with all these suggestions in this thread someone will get their shit stolen and complain about it on social media. 
---
Adding all kinds of weird artificial limitations to a just recovered account is over complicating the issue. Even in this scenario of yours they could just delete the items out of spite, same result on your end. 
---
Thanks for the info man. Really appreciate it
---
Paging Faux in aisle 6. 
---
Pay attention to your world, or pick a homeworld. Its just about impossible to lose stuff from a PVM death in osrs. 
---
Hi Mod Stevew,
---
I also had a similar incident a few months ago. I had a bank pin, recovery questions, auth, etc. Someone somehow also got into my account and stole 1.5B. I had recently maxed all skills 99, and took a break. I logged in one day and got an account recovery question thing. I recovered it, logged into my bank and the money was all gone. 
---
I tried seeking help on twitter as soon as it happened but it was the biggest waste of time. I received no help. The only thing I was told is that it was accessed by a third party and they did nothing. 
---
I was disappointed in the mod who didn‚Äôt care one bit. I gave up and haven‚Äôt played since. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre on the old school team and clearly care more than those who are a part of RS3. 
---
If you would want to look at it or forward it to another mod, the account name is Lucky Wan. This was on RS3. 
---
Go back to bed for another 3 to 4 days. Maybe you will catch back up.
---
yeah you're probably right about that
---
i'm not a dev, i believe runelite pretty extensively documents plugins that are WIP or things they absolutely won't do and why, id highly recommend joining their discord if you want 100% accurate answers.
---
I hope they reply and I‚Äôm willing to provide any information/proof they want.
---
I enjoyed text more than the picture
---
What did the comment say? 
---
Pillow trees. Fascinating. That must be where the elves sleep. 
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre being sarcastic or not but even 2 hours of zulrah/vorkath a day will get you close to 150 in a month. op played for 16-18 hours
---
&gt;‚ÄúYou see my cape on my back, ye big lad?‚Äù
---
&gt;
---
&gt;‚ÄúYeah the infernal cape.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúYeah that means ~~I‚Äôm not bullshitting you~~ I paid someone else to get it for me.‚Äù
---
&gt; What im saying is you are bullshitting if you think these scenarios are very common.
---
So you're fighting an argument that was never presented. Gotcha.
---
More like random dude asking a question. 
---
No. I killed like 180 or some shit and I didnt use prayer at all. Guthans works well there also.
---
Playing that TBC private server, I believe Nerherwing?
---
In light of the hacking on the front page the to me most important thing that needs to be addressed is why can you *recover* an *actively played* account?? That should be the biggest red flag ever when reviewing an account recover request
---
In that case, I recommend watching a guide on youtube and seeing if the skill is for you. When I had less money / total levels, I did plenty of herb runs and they helped a lot. Worth considering
---
Sounds like some level 22 lava drag bot type shit that logs out upon a white dot logging in. 
---
Which is why you knock out a ton of barb fishing early (before you begin any slayer) so you can start with ~60-70 strength. Saves an enormous amount of time.
---
not if you don't actually raise or lower the ground, or don't change the ground decoration 
---
Well, pearls are made from calcite and aragonite, both of which melt at lower temperatures than rock
---
*Waits patiently for you to complete clue then kills you for the reward*
---
how did you pull up that interface?
---
Teemo is a way of life.
---
And you would have to lock the PK worlds as well
---
Linking an ID like a driver's license or passport to the account would be nice. Then jagex could request email images of said ID or certain info from it. But that would require a customer service team. :/
---
these items are amazing please add some of them in :)
---
Do Tithe farming if you want some ridiculously fast early levels
---
You didnt include the word animation. They already have unique teleports
---
I also had a similar incident a few months ago. I had a bank pin, recovery questions, auth, etc. Someone somehow also got into my account and stole 540B. I had recently gotten all skills to 200,000,000 all, and took a break. I logged in one day and got an account recovery question thing. I recovered it, logged into my bank and the money was all gone and some had eaten my bread and lasagna.
---

If you would want to look at it or forward it to another mod, the account name is Lynx Titan. This was on  RSCRevolution.
---
I shouldn't have asked. 
---
Its 15 in CA Los Angeles
---
Castle wars gear is some of the BIS for pures
---
Is that really the only evidence you've got?
---
How does "age" mean anything
---
What these things are aand why wiki don't show any information?
---
Pernix gets me wet just looking at it üí¶üí¶
---
Just because they don't respond directly to security concerns everytime they are brought up doesn't mean they don't care about it. I guarantee every complaint has been addressed at one point or another, there just isn't a solution implemented yet for one reason or another.
---
It will still exist, it won't require a tail to make.
---
most people play multiple accounts at once
---
I don't mind the concept of a new gem, but I am not a fan of those effects. Also, it would make more sense if this was Silver Jewelry for Lv5 Enchant than a second Gold Jewelry for Lv5 Enchant.
---
Congratulations on winning your argument against a figment of your imagination! Well done.
---
:v Yeah mainly i use mobile and most classrooms don‚Äôt really enable a good connection via data.
---
A VPN works tho, just haven‚Äôt really tried it on osrs yet
---
Probably because the bones are worse than what you can get much easier and without a slayer requirement from dragons....
---
I haven't done seaweed, but if that's the case it doesn't make much sense. Basically gives 12 extra seaweed patches then in the form of allotments which is a TON of extra xp.
---
I'm out of the loop why don't you want to complete the elite diary?
---
Just like I said before, they have not made improvements to security since OSRS launched. Why are you claiming that they do care about security? 
---
I'm at 94/99 myself, going for untrimmed so getting something back from the endless cannonball sink has been pretty nice haha. Never had anything from superiors so I guess that balances out!
---
Then go to fishing trawler for the set. You don‚Äôt have to get it here
---
Ahh ok.
---
Or if it does hit, would hit a 7.
---
You're aware the East Ardy general store sells noted packs of 100 vials of water for 261 each right? That makes them 2.6gp each. Can't get a lot cheaper than that.
---
thanks for being civil in your discussion.  You have brought up a lot of good points.
---
I think you mentioned you are pretty new to the game so please feel free to PM me whenever. I have more game knowledge than I probably should (though not near as much as some). Also if you want to add me in game send me a PM and i'll send you my RSN, I'm always looking for mature people to play/chat with.
---
As far as the Zuk fight goes I see what your saying, but I still disagree personally as far as it being a problem. Also, if it's any consolation melee does play a ^(tiny) role in inferno in the form of SGS specs, although a lot of experienced inferno runners don't bring it as its more of a crutch and slows overall times down.
---
I guess there are people who love RS lore out there but to be honest watching someone spend 5 hours doing MM1 really doesn't sound that interesting if that is your only selling point
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this account is banned in the next month lol
---
How about some unique weapons/ armour pieces in the drop table that give slayer bonuses (such as increased xp or damage) but only in specific areas?
---
They could introduce it as a reward after the first 100% obtained. Before that you would lose points doing work for other houses but after you lock in your first 100% house and Architectural Alliance is basically started then things would change and you could work for every house as the reason behind it would be to make an alliance after the houses not getting along for so long. Tadaaa
---
DK bones are also way more expensive, this is only like noted dragon bones pricewise. Not that much of a buff. Plus DKs takes forever to get to. Especially with a shortcut, banking at hydra will be no time at all, so longer trips are just barely more efficient. 
---
Doing gods work
---
&gt; We understand that with big releases come lots of new items which results in more pressure to manage bank space. While we're unable to offer increased bank space at this time, we are exploring other options. One of the suggestions we've seen includes a Seed Vault being added to the Farming Guild. If this passes, we could consider other similar storage options for certain item categories in the future. 
---
I don't see the actual poll question for this. someone forget to add it?
---
I play as a female character and youd be shocked what ppl give u just because... also the horrifying stuff ppl say to me in attempt to fucc ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Interesting suggestion Ed boy!
---
&gt; set a bad precedent.
---
Didn't think about that. Totally agree
---
B0aty already does this. 
---
I've been there before, such an amazing feeling. My main was banned for goldfarming 6 years ago, and after 3 months of going back and forth with customer support, they quashed it after finding out my account was hacked and botted with.
---
Really feels like a punch in the gut to log into one of your oldest accounts, just to find out it has been permanently banned for something that was completely out of your control.
---
Why not use a unique email only for RS? 
---
The herbs were a low weight to begin with, so it‚Äôs not a big deal to me.  The number was obv high, but 50 herbs at the same weight is a nice bonus for using the master.   Who cares if it changes things for irons, we shouldn‚Äôt cater to account types.  
---
It‚Äôs only ‚Äúperfect‚Äù as long as the chase item maintains value.  If Vorkath‚Äôe chase item was the dbone necklace and it had an abby drop table, no one would do it outside of pet hunters.  You need to have useful items there or no one is going to do it.  It‚Äôs not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù.  
---
This is essentially what i'm getting at. It's not a question of whether you have it or not. It's a question of whether you did the "normal" grind, or a shorter or longer grind.
---
When someone says you "earned" a drop that means you did more than a short grind for it, whether you got it on drop rate or longer. It says nothing about whether or not you "should" have it now that you've gotten it.
---
They got rid of them in rs3 with a bigger anti-cheat team. I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt do the same in OSRS
---
tried freezing me at entrance, then battled a bit to caves and clan came to the rescue. :)
---
Nah that was someone else. I'd have a heart attack if my account was stolen with 5b on it.
---
You think he gave them the numbers for the new table? No one minds the 2m drop, just that bulk potions should never be dropped. Luckily they are working on a solution to make everyone happy
---
Would the new Hydra shortcut take the same amount of time to make the run back as it would normally take?
---
Edit code to send manipulated information to Central database. 
---
Build client
---
Profit????
---
Ok so because no one else is saying it here are some reasons to vote no to some of these questions.    
---
The respawn feature can already be done by exiting the room and leaving, and having the feature force implemented for everyone could prevent fast runs where the Hydra spawns and drags onto the red vent immediately.    
---
Noted bones are a huge buff to an already very profitable boss. We don't have this for Vorkath so why here? Especially problematic if the bones xp is increased.    
---
The agility shortcut is exactly the opposite of the stated design intent of making the boss not accessible by a quick teleport. Keep it the way it is to encourage long trips.    
---
The dragonbone necklace does not need any more buffs. Trading off passive prayer restoration versus offensive bonuses is balanced: free prayer restoration in the ammo slot is not. The ammo slot just got a +2 blessing which is already a huge boost for melee and magic, no reason to increase this further.  
---
There is no need for a random xp lamp reward for Architectural Alliance. I have no idea why this is being polled with no reasoning or justification whatsoever. 
---
Thanks for the tip I went a checked out the thread provided! Hopefully that makes it feel a little better
---
Yeah It‚Äôs retarded. You can do everything in your power to secure your account yet jagex still hands it over to them.
---
Double roll of pet chance? Lots of pets pooping out 
---
"As adjectives the difference betweenhorizontal¬†and¬†lateral: is that¬†horizontal¬†is perpendicular to the¬†vertical; parallel to the plane of the horizon; level, flat while¬†lateral¬†is to the side; of¬†or¬†pertaining to the side."
---
Hmm. I learned something new today!
---
Here's my idea:
---
Introduce an actual, real, customer support.
---
RATs, which took a huge hit after Bryson died. Rest in shit too that maggot 
---
Hard no on noted hydra bones. No need to boost hydra gp/hr by another 300k/hr for no reason. Even with the elite diary reqs, the majority of requirements on elite diary are peanuts compared to 95 slayer.  
---
Prayer xp/boost on hydras is whatever. Probably good to encourage people to loot and bank bones vs the bonecrusher/prayer setup everyone is using already.
---
Don't buff molch pearls it's really fine for what the rewards are, and don't put the anglar's outfit in the molch shop because we dont need all the depressed trawler people to show up and whine to make pearls faster. I honestly find the method really fun.
---
  fishing instances, a little tacky but whatever lol
---
  rework favour already, and no I don't mean buff it. you put that shit with quests and diaries but it's a joke to finish now
---
lumnatee cunfurmd
---
You‚Äôll get it my dude!
---
there are 0 places you use bonecrusher where inv space is a concern.
---
You make a very good point... there should be more to it.
---

like in fixed  mode
---
maybe any have team helper or soemthing to help me ?
---
tryed alt and other keys not helping just cliking like normally
---
checked settings didnt find any good 
---
Oh! Thanks I had no idea :D
---
This makes me glad that I only play the game with people I know in real life.
---
Had someone griefing there yesterday just hogging the door back and forth. Definitely needs to be changed
---
how would it devalue wildy diary?
---
Noted bones on top of already an extremely profitable task is ridiculous
---
Are a basic or medic? In boston most ems companies hire at $14 and $16 for basics and medics respectively. I did 2.5 years of emt work and never got a pay raise.
---
I now make caramel for a small candy company and making more in my first year working than I did those 2.5 years. Haha~
---
I made my $11 taking a poop and typing this.  
---
Take a color from a different phase. Already have a black slay helm, hydra has lots of other colors to choose from than black. Use more of that electric blue color that is used for the eyes. 
---
I don‚Äôt see why with all the color changing that hydra does that the new slay helm has to be black when we already have a black slay helm. 
---
When did I say they cared about security? I'm just claiming they aren't looking at account security and thinking 'pfft fuck that.' While not as much of a priority as it should be, I'll agree, it's obviously not something they don't care about completely. For some reason, they've just thought it was as secure as it needed to be, but unfortunately that isn't the case if someone REALLY wants to get in someone's account.
---
Just curious how do you think its stupid design? I think it's good- it encourages proficiency in several different skills/techniques in the game to unlock the best gear 
---
Haha thanks. Just failed again unfortunately. Bought enough brews and restores to last a long time now!
---
I love it when I bump into other RS players on other games. My go-to names for WoW are usually Neitiznot and Jatizso, since they're subtle RS references and catch the eyes of fellow scapers.
---
How is Netherwing? I saw sodapoppin and nick advert it around.
---
Bit late if your account already exists
---
That and without the special attack they are just a clip winged, lame black dragon ^^^*LOW* ^^^*ENERGY* 
---
I don't have rigour and maybe I should get rid of the v skirt then and bring blessed d'hide? I've been using prot magic/eagle eye to help. I can try not using ruby bolts and just sticking to diamond, less to worry about while i'm learning too then.
---
Nice. Ty. 
---
They also polled a buff to the bones which puts the hydra bones at less than 15xp extra. If that is the case then why is it needed? Run back and take the bones back if they're that important. Oh wait you wont because you don't need food for Hydra and you can make 2m hour with alchables. This boss should have been way more like Cerberus. Look up Jase's thoughts on it.
---
Lots of people killing hydra
---
How does it go against lore?
---
[Life has many doors Ed boy](https://m.imgur.com/t/awesome/AtwYLd0)
---
Stop, you're kiln him.
---
You basically said that here: 
---
&gt;Just because they don't respond directly to security concerns everytime they are brought up doesn't mean they don't care about it.
---
Or am I misunderstand what you wrote?
---
All osrs players will be fit as hell üòÇ
---
Would be nice if they nerfed TB effectiveness on the boss.
---
My older brother‚Äôs dad works at Jagex
---
Does it really matter that much if I pick up a drop? Even the first kill I had that issue too, maybe I should swap my v skirt for blessed d'hide legs, I assume that would help weight some.
---
The amount of people that insist they're completely flawless when it comes to flow of their personal information is baffling, I feel bad for Jagex every time I see a thread flooded with those stupid comments.
---
Does this change price of dragon sword? I'm clueless boys 
---
He means using it towards buying a bond... Which are over 3 mil so that makes no sense. Bonds give you 2 weeks of membership, so you can pay for your membership with in-game gp.
---
 You are better off to use this 1m to advance your account and train. I wouldn't worry about funding your membership with bonds until later on when you make fast gp.
---
So far kind of underwhelming. Lots of crashes.
---
unlikely. everyone who has gotten a pet is going to flex it because it's new, but that doesn't mean it's any more common than other pets.
---
Your last paragraph definitely rings true, it was such a gutting feeling to see an account disabled for something I hadn‚Äôt done. Luckily we back üëå
---
And hey the asshole even got me 91 range botting blue dragons. Jamflex left me like 400 bones/hides and like 5k mith bolts lol
---
That makes sense, I guess it wouldn't be too hard for someone to create a function that causes the bot to run from dmg.
---
doesnt matter if its 1 or 2 rolls, the effective pet/kill rate is /3k.
---
It's the English phonetic spelling.
---
Honestly speaking having notes hydra bones would devalue the fuck out of Dragon bones and nobody would have incentive to kill green dragons in the wilderness and make high prayer levels way easier to achieve. There‚Äôs no reason that the alchemical hydra needs noted bones they‚Äôre already so profitable L.
---
I'm not against any of those suggestions since I'm pretty confident I'd never be in a situation where I'd have to recover my own account.
---
But ideally, I'd really like an option to just outright disable recovery on my account. My password is randomly-generated, saved to a password database, that I back-up to several locations. I'm at little-to-no risk of losing my password.
---
I'm confused, do you mean the OG accounts that don't use email to login? Otherwise you should be able to add/change the email, right?
---
Why must the Angler outfit change pass for the Molch pearl rate to be changed? Pearls are already bad enough as is.
---
Lol right. Speaking of, did they low key at some point go out of their way to add the lumby diary req to the draynor/sarim shortcut? Or did the diary update come before that shortcut? 
---
You‚Äôre just part of the conspiracy that doesn‚Äôt want us to believe it‚Äôs really a globe.
---
But that‚Äôs just a theory... a game theory

Always bring a g maul so you can at least give these miscreants a big old smack
---
I remember the forums back in 2010 where people complained that melee was over powered, magic was underwhelming, and range was a joke. Funny how it's jumbled around.
---
Figures, I guess I didn't think about someone making damage functions on bots that cause them to run and just wait until they disappear
---
A lot of travelling from what I‚Äôve seen, spoken to him here and there but after the rs incident he cut all ties basically 
---
Doesn't it mean that you'd get the insane prayer bonus + bonecrusher effect from the ammo slut without having the currently existing tradeoff of having to forgo your amulet combat bonuses? If that's the case it would be buuuusted
---
And you have to use the obsidian key pieces with crystal key pieces. Don't forget that part.

yeah lmao how are you not living off the grid in 2019. 
---
Yeah im from az where min wage is steadily increasing because cost of living just keeps steadily increasing when min wage goes up. Yeah i make about a dollar more pre tax an hour now but most things have gone up to where its about the same. A "five dollar hot and ready pizza" is not almost 7 bucks

I feel.  I think range isn't necessarily too OP, but it would be nice if it wasnt BIS for nearly every new piece of content we get.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I‚Äôm asking you as you‚Äôve made this argument. 
---
Very good guide for new players. Contains pretty much everything related to PC for brand new players. You missed only a few points. I don't think you mentioned about closing the gates or that if you destroy a portal the void knight heals 50 hitpoints. There are also patterns on which portal portals opens up next. Red is never first, for example.

Yeah I feel, but it was the way he approached him.  He just talked down at him the whole time which would make me want to tell him to go suck a sack if I was in OP's shoes lmao
---
yikes. lets make easy content even easier 
---
Let's say that I have a very, very persistent hacker who has likely spent hundreds of hours on my account while I'm inactive on it.
---
They also know me in real life, have a good sense of how old the account is, and know many former passwords (set by them). They don't know the answer to most or all of my recovery questions. I do have 2fa active and am using an email address they don't know about.
---
How the hell do I keep my account secure? I recovered my own account last month after submitting what I thought was a pretty weak request. Like, in retrospect, I know some of these security answers were incorrect. They could likely answer them almost as well as me. Is there anything I can do besides bank pin and 2fa? Because it seems like both of those things go down the pan as soon as they have the password and can simply deactivate those. 
---
Dragon full helm story with brutal blacks. it's a 1/32k drop. "HaVe YoU EvEr GoT OnE?" nope. Did it lose over 10m in week 1? Yup.

---
No! Think of all the frogs that will catch the gay. :(
---
Huge change to UIM though. Don't play it myself but I would like to hear what UIM players think
---
If anything they'd remove rs3, why do you think it includes both rs3 and osrs player count, while osrs keeps it's own player count 
---
Make it so you have a chance for an eternal when you are mining gem rocks.  Just has to state you found the perfect gem and are forced to chisel it (with the chance for it to turn to gem dust).  Make it a 1 in 32k chance to acquire.

Ah, General Reposti.

Hellhound I can understand blocking, but abby demons are 55k xp/hr and have great drops. Noy sure why you wouldn't burst abby demons.

I literally said 20 seeds is a stupid idea. I like the nerfed table. People are bitching about not having 3m worth of seeds.
---
Please read carefully
---
That's a sentence taken from a paragraph.
---
&gt; I do feel that for the average player their melee gear/stats are generally more important as most people slay using a whip, and even when using a cannon, it will roll its accuracy based on your melee bonuses
---
I think you can see that I meant when you are using  a whip the cannon will roll on melee. Although, I will admit I probably could have phrased it more clearly.
---
Buff the drop table or nerf their HP.
---
What really frustrates me about this, and I don't see people talking about, is that Jagex *doesn't tell people* that their password isn't case sensitive. How many times do we see a redditor comment "Wait, really? Edit: Oh my god, I just tried it and it totally works!" when password case-insensitivity comes up? We, because it comes up a lot on reddit, know that we can make 20 character password to offset the loss of randomness, but the vast majority of players probably have no idea their password is being changed to lower case before submission.
---
There are a few reasons why this is a problem. Say random noob Billy uses the password "PasSWoRd73" made out of the 72 character [a-z A-Z 1-9 1-)] set. Obviously that's not all the possible special characters but that strengthens the point. At 8 characters, there are 72\^10=3.7e18 passwords of this length. That's comparable to the password "nicepassword" made from the [a-z 1-9] set (4.7e18 at 12 characters). 
---
If Billy thinks this ~1e18 passwords is secure enough, then he could be happy making his password "PasSWoRd73". But since behind the scenes, there is no case-sensitivity, his password is actually "password73", only ~1e15 length, 1000x less. If Billy knew that Jagex lower-cased his password before submission, he would have made it longer to get more security.
---
Another reason that keepping it hidden is an issue is for people that use well-intentioned, but lazy password updating or uniqueness. Maybe Billy has a unique capitalization of "YeahMyPasswordIsLong" for RuneScape and Twitter. Somehow, he is social engineered to give away his twitter password. He thinks "Oh, I know I should change my twitter password, but my runescape password is totally different due to the capitalization. A hacker might know the base, but there are 2^20 = ~1 million different permutations for them to try, so I should be safe until I get home!
---
But no, they can get it in one, because "YeahMyPasswordIsLong" is the same as "YeAHMYPAsSwoRDiSLoNg". This also applies for people that make capitalization changes, with slight differences in passwords "password73" vs. "password$11". If only Billy had known his passwords weren't case-sensitive.
---
Drop tables is too OP plz nerf jamflex.

Idk if it's there now, but theres one southeast of the konar fairy ring. It wasnt there when I did it a day or two ago. I can dm a picture if it isn't!

Is it possible to turn the Pearl fishing rod into an oily one for Infernal Eel fishing?

Only if you have to build an upstairs and can see it from there as well

---
So Gelt_RS is the singular entity in charge of drop rates/economy/and gp/hr?
---
If you believe this to be true then sure I will answer your question. 
---
If there only was some kind of weapons, that was good against dragons that could be BIS.
---
Reldo believes everything is a computer game, so he would probably also believe the world is flat while everyone else believes the world is round and not a game.
---
How!? I get like 15 per crop
---
That‚Äôs fair enough, we‚Äôll see how the poll goes. We added this particular one because we‚Äôd been hearing a lot of players say they wanted them to be less effort to fight.
---
You can start but you won't be able to get to eluned without 56 agility (51 with summer pie) cause you need to go through dense forest.

I am against the elite diary giving noted bones on the alchemical hydra. The hydra gives too much loot as it is. Jagex always wants the uniques to be worth something and normal loot to just cover expenses (they really like gwd because of this) and then they add pretty cool uniques with a 3m/h regular loot table. No shit that the lance is going to be worth almost nothing. It will camped, and not only by pet hunters. It should be more like Cerb, maybe 1m/h regular loot. Add the noted bones to the normal monsters who are too crap to kill. Drakes/wyrms/hydras should have the noted bones. Maybe noted bones for drakes/wyrms from hard diary, because it is med level content. 
---
Sure
---
Why he so mad? You bursting all the dust devils?
---
Thanks for sharing..? Lol
---
Kinda ironic how they include such a drop and just a few months before nerf birdhouses to increase their value 
---
Lazy Inferno on twitter suggested making the new mystic robes into the Dagon Hai set we used to have. These looked sweet. No extra bonuses just a cosmetic set of mystic robes. 
---
Bra you forgot about us Canadians 
---
Removing the one thing that makes drakes unique is not the way to go, from what i've heard most people like the drakes fireball mechanic. The problem with drake is that you lose money doing them and the task takes forever. I don't think buffing the drake bones will be a solution either as the main issue is how long it takes, banking the bones will only make this worse.
---
What drakes need is an actual incentive to kill them, their mechanics are fine. Maybe lower their hp a little to speed kills up and give their droptable another look, lowering their defense just makes blowpipe even better compared to other methods than it already is.
---
I suggested adding volcanic ash to their table as a standard drop in a similar way to dragonhides, this is a stackable item that most people don't enjoy collecting, it fits their thematic and stacks which means it doesn't force more trips to the bank. Not sure about quantity if this is added.
---
250k? That's more than 99% of the pkers who kill those people risk rofl
---
Better than losing 5m
---
Which part? The Silver Jewelry one because it makes more sense to add it where there is a gap than to double up in Gold Jewelry.
---
The not liking the effects because they seem unneeded. An amulet that reduces damage from Shamans seems a bit much and I don't think they need to be made easier. The bracelet isn't terrible, but does catacombs really need a buff? Also, "increased chance" is a bit vague; last time we voted for a rare chance with Slayer Bracelets it turned out to be 1 in 4... Increased Clues from specific activities in Zeah feels a bit arbitrary; usually buffs like this focus on skills or such rather than doing things in an area. And the Ring feels like another RoW but it creates a bit of a loop (you use ring to get more keys to make rings...). Also, not sure if the lines are the teles or not, but I'm not sure if we need 5 new teles about Zea with how many we have now.
---
This suggestion is cool, but your effects suck.
---
You‚Äôre just asking for higher chance at hitting KDT, higher chance of clue drops, and higher chance of shards/totem drops.
---
Like no.
---
While there are plenty of bots in F2P, there are also tons of players who just don't talk. Typing on mobile is a royal pain and a massive xp waste, and many people are afk fishing/woodcutting. If you're mining iron, you don't have time to type or your rocks get stolen generally. I'm just saying that your bias may be making you perceive quiet players as bots and that the issue isn't nearly as prevalent as the community seems to think it is. Less than 10% of the active player count are bots at any given time and that's more than can be said for most MMOs.
---
Do you want people to do their clues themselves, without help from the internet? What is this 2006?
---
Not instanced.  Just a separate area. 
---
Why not both? We haven‚Äôt tended to poll the jars POH decorations so I can see this happening.
---
You're assuming my assumptions aren't correct. Ironic. Like I said, until I see numbers, I'm gonna assume, once you take away bot numbers, that a vast majority of players (especially members) browse the subreddit. Lurkers and subs included. None of this takes away from the point that Jagex support could be better, but it reaffirms that doing some costumer support through this outlet is not a bad thing, which was the whole point of my first reply really.
---
That PvM is already locked behind 95 slayer. That's the nuttiest requirement in any of the diaries by a mile. Heaven forbid that skilling actually mean anything or give any actual rewards. 
---
You barely spend any time banking at hydra anyway, a shortcut wouldn't meaningfully increase kills per hour.
---
I don't think so. They don't mention a prayer bonus. 
---
The reason the bonecrusher necklace has a prayer bonus is because it is an upgraded dragonbone necklace. 
---
The new item will not have a dragonbone necklace, so it would not have that prayer bonus. 
---
The only thin specifically said about it is: "an item with the Bonecrusher effect that can be equipped in the ammo slot".
---
A while back you had worlds for bots only, if you suspected that an account was botting you would transfer the account to a new world.
---
Call this a crazy idea but can we do this for accounts that are suspected of being hacked? If your account has been recovered, you can only login to these worlds. This would also let an automated system flag accounts that have had wealth transferred and instantly ban the hackers. This would have to be an opt in feature of course. 
---
(Hackers would recover an alt account , wait till the last day and then transfer the wealth, to counter this you need to make the number of days random for each account and not tell the user)
---
It is boostable. You only need to kill a regular hydra, not the boss and there are off task hydras. I have the diary completed and I am only 93 slayer
---
Agreed, people always meme adding a high agility req to things, but there is basically no content in the whole game you can't boost to from 85. 
---
Or just make the content in the areas unusable workout the proper requirements and delete the doors
---
I wouldn't say plummet. It's REALLY good for raids and decent for other things. But I would definitely wait for it to stabilize
---
Lmao I'm lvl 100 and have only tried once. I'm on mobile though with ko pc available though. I think I might try it tonight after work. Good job dude! 
---
Same thing happened to me...
---
Spent the week switching blocks as well, so Hellhounds are now blocked.
---
I'm going for untrimmed slayer so Abby demons are alright, it's another thing I can burst since I can't do Nechs (too much extra hp exp) and I've not done Lumbridge elite so they were the best choice to keep unblocked.
---
We‚Äôre considering this to make the lance and other melee weapons more viable

Hey Jagex I know you guys won't acknowledge this good post OP has made but I know at least with my friends and I we want to like this game but won't touch it for another minute until shit like this starts being implemented.  Account security in this game is a fucking joke especially for a game that asks for thousands of hours of your time.
---
It just didnt grow yet, after that you can. It doesn't take that long
---
I wonder what the community's opinion on the devs spending time on engine work to increase bank space in lieu of some new content it. Personally I think it would be worth it.
---
I‚Äôve used runelite for awhile and I know it‚Äôs the .net one and jagex itself emailed me cuz I did it all from the main website that‚Äôs how I originally recovered it. But now they are going for my account and changed the email and all. I didn‚Äôt click any phish links or anything.
---
Occult, The prayer zammy robes (I forgot what they are called) Imbued god cape and Book of Darkness.
---
Cost like 2m but that's your best bet, everything else really doesnt matter
---
I thought pid changed way more often now
---
true but it is fast.
---
also if you needed to change your spellbook for this, when you go to change spellbook to lunars, you can bring pure essence and craft 2 inventories of astrals, one when you swap to lunars and again when you swap back.
---
gives you ~80 astrals which you can use to fill 2k+ vials at pretty much no cost.
---
Wild pie?

Ha! I just did MM and got arrested 11 fucking times... Fml

Soft clay or jug of water.  Not vials.
---
Destruction 100

RS3 brings in waaaayyy more money due to MTX.
---
Don't even get me started on losing 8m
---
I agree completely. There should be options available that are like REALLY REALLY extreme and you don‚Äôt have to use them all. But those of us who have been hacked for like 3-7B will understand that full-fledged security can help you sleep at night when you‚Äôre worth 5B+. Just in everything and anything that leads to more security. Yes there are downsides, but you can toggle these, and shouldn‚Äôt have an issue turning them on and off if you are the real account owner. I‚Äôm talking extreme measures too.

No credit to 25 Buttholes? Scummy.

Sounds like ezscape 
---
r/wallstreetbets wants to know your location
---
I really don't see why hydra needs any more buffs to it.
---
It's already too much gp/hr especially from the regular drops alone. I really don't want hydra to be another zulrah/vorkath situation where people kill it for the regular drops and the uniques just become an extra, driving down the price of them unneccessarily.
---
I've gotten the seeds by gathering and checking patches. Farming contracts also give them too, yeah.
---
That‚Äôs gonna be a fuck no from me on the angler outfit and golden tench. 
---
For sure. Do you do birdhouse runs at all as well? I‚Äôve found this to be a pretty good source @ high Hunter even after the nerf. 
---
The contracts are crazy, lots of plam seeds, maples etc which makes for good xp.
---
Ah ok, good luck on the untrimmed cape :)
---
Sounds actually difficult and fun. Weird.
---
Member this quest taking me an entire night before school in middle school. Only because we did have stamina pots back in the day and I kept falling over ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Getting Tithe points from contracts or just being able to access the same shop by completing contracts would be nice but would make tithe almost completely not worth doing. Also I find myself struggling the payments more so than actual seeds. Maybe a Giant Cornucopia item that could hold multiple fruits would be cool but there are already baskets and sacks
---
r/wholesomememes
---
It fucking sucks coming from a 95 slayer task only boss
---
k
---
So far I have received 1 seed from checking mahogany tree, 1 from checking papyrus tree, 1 from a herb patch, and 1 from a farming contract. 
---
Not really. Wildy Slayer frequently drops emblems which pay for a huge part of the cost. I made money on one account. That was lucky. 
---
The only thing I don't love is the noted hydra bones, I think the boss is already rewarding enough, and I especially think the elite diary is already rewarding enough with the unlimited teles to brimstone, bis blessing, and removed heat effect in the dungeon.
---
The angler coming from aerial fishing kind of feels like a band-aid to fixing trawler, but I also don't hate it.
---
Always seen the cover art for it, but never watched it. Thanks friend I got a movie to watch tonight now.

Upvote to compensate

Blowpipe is faster at vorkath as well though

Downvote because you didn't credit lord 25 buttholes
---
It isn‚Äôt end game content, Zerkers, pures, level 50s do Inferno. Shitty mid level accounts can do it with ACB or rune crossbow.
---
Do the boat quest South of Lumby, it's my favorite starter quest. And try it without a guide.
---
You know you can actually enter the room at any slayer level?
---
Your friend goes to the gym, he has more of an outside-of-work life than I do probably. :P
---
You just figured out the problem with end game content. Melee is pretty shit even with prayer flicking which is not a feature, but a bug abuse that they just rolled with.
---
#MakeMeleeGreatAgain
---
Yeah, there is a deposit box literally like 3 squares away from the tree 
---
Just because its a tier higher doesn't mean it needs to be better in every single way, granite legs have a higher range defense than dragon platelegs. It's a niche item that fills a specified role. It's balanced properly.

They're double-hit spots for the cannon. Aligning mobs' SW square to the red spots lets the cannon hit it twice per rotation,which increases the dps.

Infant you had more balls than you now, that should be enough motivation in itself
---
You admitted that you cheated. Just make a new acc. Don't cheat if you're not willing to face the consequences.
---
Obviously, but it isn't as bad as abberant spectres, bloodvelds, dragons, trolls, demons, gargs or anoku. 
---
Not sure why people hate abyssal demons so much. The less time you spend switching tasks, the better xp/hr you can maintain. That goes without mentioning the whip drop every other task.
---
I was in the same boat as you.  I would suggest adding tree runs into your daily routine, it's a crapload if xp.  First, do tree gnome village.  Grab 5 tree saplings and their payments (for you that's oak, but eventually willow).  When you hit 27, grab 4 fruit tree saplings and their payments (apple tree at 27).  Grab spade dibber rake and about 8k. (Less but idk the number).  
---
Tele to varrock, do that tree patch.  Use the tree in GE to go to gnome stronghold, do that fruit tree and tree patch there.  Use the tree to go to gnome village, do that fruit tree right outside.  Tele lumby, do the tree behind the castle.  Tele fall, do the tree in the park and then run to taverly and do that tree.  Tele to Cammy and run down to cathurbury fruit tree.  Finally charter a ship from there to brimhaven and do that fruit tree.  Once you've started the run, the next time you go just right click pay each of the farmers to look after your tree.
---
Obviously wait for lvl 27 before you do fruit trees, but I think you can just use a botanical pie if you want to hit the ground running.
---
It would visually improve the quality of my life, so it ain‚Äôt no lie
---
The problem with your idea #1 is that people would forget their passwords and Jagex support would have to deal with those. 
---
We definitely don't need peaches to extend trips, food is barely used to begin with.

? Trolls are like 10 minutes so you do them, the rest are blocks/skips

Definitely voting no to instanced fishing area. No other skill has this ability, and it also goes against the idea of competing for resources (this is an MMO, after all, not a single player game).
---
bro have u ever been to a science class? it obviously evaporates after 1 minute or 2 on the ground
---
Best cooking spot available in game either requires dragon slayer 2 or sacrificing a fire cape so that you are can bank and cook on the same square.
---
Dragon pickaxe for mining
---
Werewolf course is the best agility xp in the game and requires killing a level 50 and a level 30 monster 
---
Ice gloves require killing the ice queen and gold smith gauntlets require killing chrozon. Both are required for the fastest xp in game.
---
Herblore relied entirely on combat prior to farming and the herb sack through slayer can help quite a bit collecting herbs.
---
Fishing requires low strength levels for barbarian fishing
---
Thieving requires completion of the feud for the fastest xp in game which requires killing a few level 70s.
---
Lunar diplomacy is needed for the spin flax spell which gives roughly 75k magic and 75k crafting xp an hour for small profit or small loss depending on the time of year and can be stacked with magic imbue and plank make for 240k magic xp per hour and 50-60k crafting xp.
---
A lot of people doig crafting also rely on hides from monster drops as dragons or cows.
---
Shades of Morton for firemaking
---
Dragon limbs for fletching
---
Dragon axe for wc as well as fossil island being the best non tick manipulation xp per hour in a swamp with aggressive monsters that would body a combat level 3 character.
---
Fastest rc xp is making boots from Cerberus drops, pouches are only obtained from abyss creatures, zmi isn't much of an option without pouches, teleports, or using the long safe path, unless you pay runners 4-5 mil an hour
---
Slayer is combat
---
Farming has new farming demibosses and have fun doing farming without teleports and losing out on multiple patches unlocked from quests requiring combat.
---
Making mounted myth capes for construction adds an additional 100 xp to the three teak logs you use and returns the cape to your inventory when taking it down. Making it an extremely cost effective way of training construction. Requires dragon slayer 2.
---
For hunter best xp and cash is black chins. With maxed def and maxed mage with high level ranged top and bottom with a bulwark you stand the best chance of getting away from pkers. 10 hp in 30+ wildy just doesn't last long.
---
That mini quest is longer than most regular quests in the game. Still, it has nothing to do with runecrafting so I'm not sure why it would specifically give a Runecrafting lamp. Why not just a normal 10k lamp that works on any skill above a certain level?

Patrick's scream is as identifiable as the widely used Wilhelm scream. You take one look at this picture and can audibly hear what Konar Drop Table sounds like as it gets yoinked.

stop.

I haven‚Äôt gotten around to birdhouses yet, probably should get on that

a lot of the drops are alchable. wear d hide and a malediction ward and pray nothing. the runes add up, the red chap to alch add up. made over 1m on a 150 task

Personally I disagree with the account recovery from another country due to the fact people move country. What would be better is locking to a country but the user may choose the country but limit the setting of a country in the same way Authenticator delay would work. so if someone permanently moves from one country to another they don‚Äôt have to fly back to recover their osrs account. 
---
Wow that sucks so much. I logged on cause I have membership and there is literally not 1 person here in any world... that‚Äôs such a shame this has such high potential 
---
What's the reasoning behind question #16 on this poll?:  If the above question passes, should we add an extra 10k xp lamp reward to the Architectural Alliance miniquest?
---
Also, if it passes and we finished the miniquest long ago, can we still get that xp lamp?
---
I watched an entire one once (it was like 20 minutes). It blew my mind how biased it was and how many things it outright lied about. Pretty interesting experience

Lmao imagine paying 11 dollars a month for a game where they're scared to store more item ID integer values on a database XD

calling bait than taking blame :D nice
---
Significant part of the community is already against pointless recolours, so implementing this without polling seems wrong. 
---
The sad thing is this is actually happening, look at splashers, people aren't just born like that.

Mr. Mordaut as in "more dots!!"?
---
This happened to me when a nigerian prince said i won 250 wheels of fortune spins on the famous mmo rpg runescape. Sadly my account was stolen and my bank cleaned
---
counter 48-48 darkbow parks with a set of  full granite? you unit you.
---
I like the idea but i think the teleports should be removed as Xeric's talisman already teleports to these places and you have to get 100% favor unlock them.
---
I would disagree,  although that may have been the intended purpose granite legs are almost never used.
---
this makes a lot more sense than specifically a runecrafting lamp. jagex should be aware that "rc is slow" is a meme and shouldnt cater specifically to it especially if there's no lore-based reason for it.
---

Alright, that makes it more clear. Yes, as a policy, enforcing complexity other than simple things such as "don't make your password 'password'" has very diminished returns, as opposed to enforcing a longer length. I tried to acknowledge that by bringing up the X^n.
---
I thought you were implying something else by saying that complexity in general was "outdated", as if it wasn't a point of consideration in cryptography/security.
---
Kindly go fuck yourself.

IIRC is tithe requires like 32 farming. Maybe 36

I'd join their discord (link on their website) and ask if others have reported it, etc.

I already posted here but something I forgot to say was that I'd like it if you could sell your item back to Alry for a decent amount of molch pearls back

The exp is from planting the seed, this has been a thing ever since farming was initially released because people were storing up tons of seeds, planting, removing, planting, etc... for quick exp

More likely nerfs to vork and hydras stab stats than direct lance buffs

Its already scythe tier at cox

I feel that the locations themself are punishment enough, like banking if u get a clue is alot easier at Nieve. These are just things that I dont think the developers of the areas even thought about.
---
It seems like you and rest over community see people who macored as some dirty seedy underground group of gold farming dirt bags , when in fact some of you commenting probably have or no people that have cheated or are cheating ... just my two cents 
---
lol dumb as the average normie. Being able to store clue items in another way has been highly requested for a long time. Nobody asked for a seed vault. &amp; I guarantee my Ironman &gt; your normie in every stat, gear, and bank value. Kys 
---
Well you tried it and saw what happened. Your issues do not excuse your actions. No excuses are going to get your account back. Just suck it up and make a new one if you want to play again or move on.

Sounds to me like someone didn't talk to Oziach...
---
Yeah farming guild definitely doesn't benefit skillers whatsoever.
---
when it ranges five times*
---
how do i get every NPCs name on the list

Sure, come to San Francisco and make $15-$16 an hour. You're probably gonna be sharing a house with 2-3 people and live in a shitty neighborhood with heroin needles around the sidewalk corners.

You‚Äôre the one that was dumb enough to get phished lmao. Don‚Äôt post phishing links ffs.
---
If the money has been tracked and the accounts have been banned, couldn't OP have the money added back to his account? I know you don't typically do this, but I feel this is a special case, especially as you guys are partly to blame for this.
---
Yer every day for three years I ponder about that account .. it‚Äôs not even that good stat wise lol

you just made me cum lol, very nice feet

And it absolutely is a perfectly fine weapon for the mid level average Joe.
---
You act as if every one and their mothers can afford to buy a rapier or skilled enough to do raids 2.... It's not an easy task , that's why the rapier is an end game content drop and for the 1%....
---
Dragon Hunter Lance is a perfectly fine weapon for the average player that isn't even remotely close to obtaining something as powerful as the rapier....
---
You might surprise yourself if its something you decide you really want.

72 agility is way too low for a boss that requires 95 slayer. Why would a high level boss shortcut require mid level stats?

And brother, Jagex can't cure hacking. That's not how hacking works. All they can do is put security measures in place to make your account as safe as possible, which they have. 
---
If you want double xp that badly, you're gonna lose your account. If you use the same password for your account as your email, you're going to lose your account. If you don't regularly change your password, you're going to lose your account.

Nope, watermelons for sure. Pineapples are about 10x as much.

all I wanted to hear. It's a helpless feeling, bad rng.
---
I love it, Thank you.
---
So it's worse against Corp? Why would that increase the price?
---
Yeah makes sense, inventory seems op , but equipment switches shouldn't be much more xp per hour if any, just me being lazy wanting it I guess 
---
You got me, I laughed. 
---
bro look up 2 comments u crack head i already corrected that
---
That's the spirit man, after reading all these comments it turns a smile on my face you're going to try as well. Best of luck and you got it!! 
---
More like, new content: exists
---
Vocal minority and streamers that don't even participate in the content: op nerf this
---
Jagex: ok we'll nerf it one day after release with hardly any data gathered
---
Everyone else: wtf
---
So pray, run around the corner, tap a healer long range bp, then go back to point A? Rinse and repeat? 
---
Or make the seed vault have incremental access due to farming level or something. 
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Thats your cheat client : )

Bury gives a warning because bury is basically never the intended option

Is not hard. If you get handed a 100 piece puzzle where you have the numbers go across 1-200 with 15 numbers on each row, it'll take a while, but it doesn't mean it's hard to do. Just annoying
---
I still don't understand the point of the randomized position/orientation of the numbers for bank pins, am I retarded?
---
Your missing the point I‚Äôm not justifying what I did with my ‚Äú excuses‚Äù I‚Äôm just saying I think the system is  slightly unbalanced banning wise and I just think people who are honest enough to change deveseve a chance to be part of the game we all love

I think I prefer Scottish

I left out lletya because it (seems?) complicated to someone who isn't experienced.  That being said, I personally am not super experienced.  I've completed up to regicide, but do I need roving elves for that?
---
Seconded on fossil island, the 3 tree patches take days to grow but they are huge experience OP!  and I'll add calquat trees to my rotation, thanks for the tip!
---
It wouldn't devalue it anyway, I'm pretty sure you can kill 8x the number of green dragons per hour as you can hydras and they're afk as fuck.
---
Happy birthday when i get off work I‚Äôll take a bong hoot just for your honour

thank god everyone is clouded that 'omg its best olm no buff wtf!' 95% of people don't do olm, some of us kill other dragons and it compared to the DHCB or rapier its garbage. I mean it even has worse stats compared to a zamarokian hasta which is required to make it lol.

Separate area with a diary requirement, not instanced.

I suggested in another comment that if the two accounts are linked you would only be able to play membership on one at a time. That would at least be one option for how this could work

it makes zero sense that authenticator not required for website login

Most popular and best pvm content, majority do. Raids should be the top balance priority, best pvm content jagex has made by a long shot
---
Or just make it like the brimstone ring/bludgeon/dark totem where you get a piece and you can't get the same piece again until you complete the set.
---
Since when can we use special characters..?
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs so if people watch you type your pin they don‚Äôt actually know the numbers..? Just guessing though

You could try this but they clearly state: "These penalties are reserved for the worst offenders and we will not debate these types of bans on our forums, social media or any other method of communication. " Anout rwt so I'd give it little hope.

True, hell. It's probably a person that knows the guy irl, or ever met him somewhere online. Let's not forget how social engineering is actually one of the most concerning problems when it comes to hacking in general. 
---
panic buy lances poggers
---
You cant realy blame them, we got a lot of new mobile friends and its a mid level content so the people complaining dont care too much about the longetivity of the game but jagex does and they quickly cold fixed it to look for other options, first day of release is always sketchy its hard to find the balance between op and dead content
---
No, Brassican mage uses typless damage. No defense bonus or protection prayer works against him. The only things that reduce his dps against you are prayers that boost your effective defense level (steel skin/Piety types), potions that boost your defense level, and things that reduce damage taken by a percentage (Elysian, justicar, etc.)
---
The dragon hasta will now be, making Z spear the best for it again. The main value in spears is their damage at corp
---
Ya I said from being hacked though. Mod Jed was a special case because he quite literally was just stealing from accounts and it was 100% Jagexs fault
---
&gt;I teleported back to the bank and got my inv ready lol.

Even if the notes bones don‚Äôt pass it‚Äôs so easy and fast to get back to hydra with these changes, might be worth banking all bones after 5 or so kills for the extra gp/hr.
---
Not including harmony patch you have 12 patches so 15 is still decent at 180. Just gotta get lucky I guess. It's still new so I need to do about 100 patches to get a rough estimate.
---
Same with pyromancer... I haven't gotten the farming set, but something tells me that isn't either.
---
I could talk about stuff like adjustments in the overall market, how things like players coming into or leaving the game, or certain periods of time reflecting merchanting activity, but at the end of the day; it would all be a hand wavey look at the hidden values of supply and demand that control price point fluctuation daily on the grand exchange. 
---
It‚Äôs interesting to talk about and it‚Äôs fun to apply it to our own items, wealth, and overall availability of certain items over time. But nothing about its exact science. With that said, when you understand typical business and market cycles, that understanding applies almost 1:1 here and that‚Äôs where analyzing the effects of merchanting clans and Jagex announcements is just as paramount to understanding what comes next when it comes to investing a lot of money into a lot of items.
---
Maybe if enough people are interested in reading something like this, I‚Äôd be willing to do it!

cox?

but you're missing the point its a weapon for killing dragons, which it should be BIS for killing dragons nothing else.

Its definitely not legit, the grammar should be a dead giveaway

Nice.

are there multiple tree patches? what if you get a different tree contract?
---
They can't hack you with just your rsn then tho?
---
Yea man, damn, he looks good sorry not everyone has time to make it to the gym 5 times a week.
---
Getting e-mails or text messages for failed log in attempts and/or failed recovery attempts would also be nice. I can only imagine high profile accounts have hundreds of attempted hijacks every day. It would certainly be nice for situations where you are taking an extended break from the game and may have no idea your account has been hijacked until weeks or months later.
---
Indeed. The source of the jumbling! 
---
If you watch pan1c 07 it's pretty good in pvp

It's a buff to the casual playstyle where people just relax and AFK Slayer. It does nothing for efficient players.

Fix the wording for the drake special attack question. Add the word potion to it to make it more clear.

I don‚Äôt time it, I‚Äôm not the one skipping them but I can see the logic in skipping the events.
---
No one even picks up the bones atm you brainlet. I bet you don‚Äôt even have the requirements to kill hydra based off your comments.
---
I have tried that, it basically saves one single prayer potion and adds a lot of work, you can‚Äôt pick up bones anyways to bury them if your inventory is literally full.
---
I really don‚Äôt think saving the 30 seconds of banking and running back to the boss every 16 kills instead of 8 kills will ‚Äúcrash prayer‚Äù especially when prayer should already be crashing from the bones more powerful than dragon coming from enemies faster to kill than blue dragons, with a teleport directly to them. Not the boss that gives you 1 bone per every minute and a half.
---
I can‚Äôt image why an extra 20 bones per 30-60 minute trip at hydra worries you but the obviously broken prayer training from the non-boss hydra doesnt
---
Ugly
---
Blowpipe does more dps and you'll get faster kill times on average. DHCB is subjectively better and used more commonly because you'll take less damage and you'll be able to round out more kills per hour. I don't have to do math to calculate the dps. There's a calculator that even the stupidest person can use to figure out dps calcs for almost any scenario. 
---
Naw bud 15k is shit on 8.6m no matter what
---
30% damage bonus still isn't enough to out dps blowpipe, since the blowpipe is so insanely accurate against this boss. 
---
It‚Äôs just a higher chance to roll nothing tbh
---
It‚Äôs all numbers to me idc what it looks like. Time is another factor. If it saves time in the long run then that‚Äôs the gear I‚Äôd go with. 
---
My plan to get a tbow for 1 gp is working i see
---
Yeah I tried to do some math to see how large it could end up being, even if you stored it semi-unefficiently. Without compression or indexing or anything, 2 bytes per item (I think that would be enough for item IDs, idk) \* 816 items in a bank \* 200,000,000 accounts created = 326.4 Gigabytes.
---
But this is 100% armchair shit and I have no idea how big an item ID is or what compression algorithms could/couldn't be used by a database or anything, not to mention I can only have nightmares about what kind of hardware this information is on and how this old-ass game engine is supposed to interface with that database.
---
DNA tests would require engine work so we'll have to go with taste tests for now. 
---
If I could make a suggestion that I think would benefit players while keeping the drakes as they are, move their fireball that you have to move out of to an area sound rather than a sound effect, similar to how hydra's attacks are area sounds rather than a sound effect. 
---
Forgot all about drift net fishing,is that even done by folks nowandays or is it dead?

Dear Player,

This is fake af
---
You're right association doesn't imply exclusively. I wasn't trying to put words into your mouth, sorry if it came across that way.
---
"why would people waste their time botting on things worth way less. Doesnt seem very logical."
---
You're absolutely right with that line of thought.
---
I believe it's because skilling bots are easier to create (they require less time and effort to start gathering resources which makes them less risky compared to pvming bots which need more quests/stats etc..)
---
Due to pvming bot accounts requiring more time relative to skilling bots to setup, it becomes easier to detect/ban pvming bots. 
---
Even so they still exist rampantly at instanced bosses like zulrah/corp.
---
It all comes down to bot risk/bot reward.
---
400 bonds = 1 twisted bow = 2799,6 dollar

Fake. Jagex does not send emails for offences. Delete this.

I'm going to give an upvote to op and a downvote to you.

You want to know why? Because I haven't seen this before and I didn't know this was a repost. Oh this has been posted before? You saw this post previously? Congratulations! You're so good at... Looking at pictures on the internet. What an enviable skill you have there... Looking at pictures on the internet. It's almost as if I have a life outside of the internet to have not seen this before.
---
Now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to my real life.
---
Melee will never be viable on Hydra unless they buff it to some absurd number, its mechanics favor Range/Mage too much.
---
I don‚Äôt have numbers on it but it feels very negligible. IMO the one to decrease disease is probably the best for herb runs. 
---
Why do you KEEP IGNORING the fact that there is no delay on removing an authenticator! How simple can it be to add one?
---
You know you have to switch laptops and you have your auth and all passwords saved on it? Really smart.

YIKES hahahahah

Its actually a tattoo from a hardcore artist logo,.. well thats what he says :P

You must not have posted this wanting discussion, cause people gave you good reasons for it's use and yet you just deny anything anyone says.

Based on its description, it would probably level out around ~50k. Not sure how rare the key drop is though.

Nice

they could just nerf dragon hunter crossbow to 20% like lance and no one would have an issue then.

We can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with the tree you covered it up with that blue shape

Yeah, it's a bit lonelier, but I'll take silence over random unsolicited advice.

Need the fury ornament kit

I was thinking the same. Would love more clarification on it
---
We need more content like this
---
Smort
---
Also consider decreasing the hydra's leash range if the player is using a melee weapon as well! I'd say the defenses are a smaller time loss for melee compared to losing time doing damage because of having to run around for vents.
---
This comment is gold

scythe is only 1.2b because its rare, not because its useful.

In some cases yes. In other cases you bring 3 people with d Spears.

Have you ever watched any Wildy pking video? It‚Äôs used to great affect. It was even used to kill one of the Fools guys in the DMM final hour

Oh okay, thanks

Bcp is one of the last items you should buy.  You should basically have all other max gear before you get it.  Just admit you like it because its spiky and cool looking but don't try to justify it with logic.

I upload my loot from slayer daily so stay tuned!
---
I had a similar situation when I tried 5 times to get my email changed on my account because it was a fake email that i made up when I was 12, i got an auto response of no every time but then 2 months later my email was removed from my account. Maybe something similar will happen to you idk
---
Definitely. I have that one planted currently and out of around 150 individual herb patch runs, only 3 have died with ultra compost, which i've all brought back to life with the arceuus spellbook. Also had 1 dead seaweed patch too in around 30 runs.
---
Well now it feels worse knowing that I have 2x Thrownaxe drops and no uniques lol. 
---
Lol a discussion is a conversation and all of these comments have a single reply. So what's up
---
It's a fairly common drop. It will keep dropping in the long run despite any buffs. It's already bis at most dragons. 
---
Bought a ghrazi rapier at 330M. I've been crying each day since the update
---
&gt;  they can continue playing their account once it's safe.
---
Ok, so never? 
---
Your account remains compromised until Jagex cleans it, contacting them about this issue is currently not reliable at all.
---
&gt; How will a hijacker gain access to the message centre if you change the email/password before they have time to file a manually recovery and get the information changed to theirs
---
What are you saying... I don't even... what?
---
Here, let me explain how it works:
---
1. The hijacker gains full access to the account after a successful appeal. 
---
2. You can recover it back and set new details, find this imaginary place to contact Jagex.
---
3. The hijacker sends another recovery appeal using the same details and possibly add new information they've found. 
---
4. The hijacker then checks your message centre, sees your ticket, saves the information and deletes it.
---
5. You then recover it...
---
6. rinse and repeat. 
---
It doesn't matter what your current registered email or password is. In the manual recovery form Jagex primarily looks at the previous details. The older the details the higher chance they belong to the account creator.  Details which somehow got compromised over the years and you are unable to change. 
---
Ok you do have a point.
---
Why do you think I posted this then you think I just want to argue with people?
---
Followed xoxox
---
Thanks for the nice comment! Hopefully things work out.
---
Thats exactly what i thought is that bots to do pvm would be way more complicated but im not familiar with botting enough to know specifics. Less risk and effort with skilling. Which is why i figured skilling would be more abused hence less rewarding. 
---
 I always figured it was pvm was bad, if there can be profit people will find a way to abuse it lol  just a lot harder so less would do it. 
---
Feel like we think the same thing lol
---
Great idea! Support! Skotizo pet hunt revived.
---
This is the kind of response I'm looking for
---
Good point
---
Why 3 buffs to the boss that's already 3m+ an hour?
---
seed box exists. holds 6 types of seeds, ya can carry it with you. Your suggestion would hold all seeds and stay at guild.
---
Yeah honestly hydra shits out supplies 
---
Doesnt Konar give 18 points per task and not 15?
---
Okay, so here we go, my thoughts. Hang in there.
---
**Aerial Fishing:** I'm generally speaking not against instances and, though I have not thoroughly tested the Aerial Fishing myself I am fine with an instance being created. However, the social aspect is inherently lost, you can no longer meet new people if only those on your friend list can join. Furthermore, whilst I don't mind multiple ways of gathering an item I do fear for the Fishing Trawler mini game if Alry was to sell the outfit whilst you would gain half decent experience. The community talks a lot about reviving mini games, but thinking about changes as above might be a good start. Not saying it can't happen, just that it has potential downsides.
---
**The Alchemical Hydra:** I love the uniques that were introduced to the game by means of the Alchemical Hydra the balance on them is just right and it is overall a terrific job. The mechanics of the boss are new and fun, and feel right for a slayer (Boss) monster. The "side" drops however... Whilst I understand drop tables are difficult. This monster's drops feel, even when taking into account that it can only be slain on task, overpowered. And I am genuinely concerned about inflation. I don't mind noted bones when the Elite Diary is required. The shortcut seems a bit of a nuisance, there is no real danger and even if there was one could prepare for that. I'm not a fan of changing the respawn, you can kill enough each hour as we speak and it limits further escalation of alchs entering the game. Secondly, for those new it adds a challenge as there is only so much time to clean up your inventory, one could consider the respawn timer a mechanic.

**Wyrms, Drakes and regular Hydras:** I can't speak on this topic since I have not yet been able to try out the content.
---
**Kourend Favour:** The fact that gaining favor for one party no longer decreases the favor one has at another party is rather nice, and I feel should have been implemented from the start. The 10k experience lamb... I mean, sure, why not. Though I don't see any reason whatsoever why you see any reason to make that change right now.
---
inb4 1/5k claw drops
---
Why even buff the Hydra? It's already insanely good hp/hr. Reducing the respawn time increases kills/hr making the boss wayyy too profitable for how easy and accessible it is.
---
That would explain why they are not buying anymore lol
---
Youtube
---
I would prefer if instead if the lazula gem had to be added to dragonstone similar to how zenyte is to onyx.  The new jewelry should have charges and consume the dragon stones providing a sink for them
---
Hydra only rolls the unique table on the first drop, not the second
---
Yes, we have ‚Äòraid cc‚Äô. We have a few requirements, but as long as you meet those you can get on and see if any learner raids going on. Teachers are great and very knowledgeable. Some reqs are arclight(dwh and Bgs being obviously better), trident, and either elite void or tormented bracelet. You also need a decent range level. 
---
I go to YouTube but theres nothing really where I'm at
---
Hespori's growth time should be lowered, maybe on par with fruit tree timers, or just a bit more, like 20.
---
Waiting 32 hours for two seed drops is way too long.
---
With such a long wait, yet such availability of the seeds, pretty soon I'm going to have over 100 hespori seeds stocked up, and have only grown it maybe 20 times.
---
Well, that‚Äôs what voting should involve. In politics(for example), people do research to form their opinions and engage with other perspectives before finalizing their decision on a matter, and they don‚Äôt know what everyone else plans to vote for the day of the poll. For OSRS, people can have discussions about polled changes on forums and later vote in a blind poll(the standard for most voting circumstances).
---
I got muted for staff impersonation when I was 9 for telling someone I own Jagex. 
---
I love seeing my old mute evidence
---
Are you an Ironman? 
---
Basically, the main thing we want and that would dramatically increase account security is a delay for removing the Authenticator. Jagex has repeatedly given the idiotic excuse that it's somehow not worth implementing because brainlets who forget their password would somehow quit the game forever if they're forced to wait 1 week to recover their accounts.
---
The community even requested optional Authenticator delays and they won't do that either. They're prioritizing people who don't care about their accounts enough to remember a password or wait a week for recovery over their most dedicated players who lose billions.
---
they already decided on jar of brimstone

Just bought 5 more. They're def all around 85m atm.

Fingers crossed, mines planted. No pet on way to 99 and just a bit over now from herb + seaweed

This is the cutest osrs post i've seen in a while :)
---
Hi it sounds like your guild could use some more epic players to increase those numbers. I'm willing to join and already smashed the skulls of many slayer tasks with my Torag's Hammers.
---
You can find me meditating on top of White Wolf Mountain on world 358 if you wish to talk.
---
Iron ore. Mine in dwarf mine. That's how I made my bond. I also fished lobsters. Not too bad with the bank deposit box on port sarim. Switch to swordfish when you can. 
---
no matter what, it's bound to drop as it's a easy 25+ kill/h slayer boss drop. Compared to the DHCB which is like 1/750 raids which take like 25-30min each.
---
Justiciar is pretty useless. Elite void and bandos are what's used in 95% of endgame pvm. You can work on zenyte jewelery, but you should focus on getting the gear requirements for whatever pvm content you want to do. 
---
Ive ran for hey_jase for a bit, and its always been a private world, regardless if he is live or not
---
thanks fella, appreciate it!
---
Nvm... fletching lol.  Slayer in the long run is great money. Spin flax into bowstrings for quick starter cash. And questing is your friend 
---
It's so obvious you have never even attempted inferno in your life.
---
Also a fighter torso has the same offensive stats as a BCP, its just the defensive stats that are lacking.
---
Your fault for being so reckless with your money :\
---
You already could do ensouled dragon heads to save pretty much that, around 50m to 99 prayer, and they're 300k+ per hour. The wilderness altar is the sameish kind of money saving, but there's the aditional risk of carrying a lot of bones, or banking extremely often.
---
The altar is not a problem if ensouled heads aren't. They aren't.
---
/u/JagexGambit, this is better for the Kourend favor. Once you complete the respective house quest, the favor stops decreasing when helping other houses. 
---
You know what indicates a price the most? The fucking rarity of it. DHL is not a rare item and its from a easy to kill 25+kills/h boss. Honestly the DHL will never stay over 100M because then hydra would be 10m+/h lmao
---
I‚Äôm so happy there is still sense in this sub. 
---
What so many people want is an extremely afk boss with no respawn finer (lmaoooooo), noted bone drops and alchs, and an instance. You might as well go play on a private server!!!!
---
Pretty much what will happen yeah. Security is especially important in games like RS where you have fuckwads who literally pay their rent hacking accounts.
---
Mad niggas hatin, ima upvote your brOtha

I appreciate the pure rng on pets. RS3 has a threshold system and it's nice but nobody goes like 20k dry on a pet. Posts about being super dry on a pet is one of the reasons I love osrs.
---
they aren't hard to spot, when something idiotic is posted here that tries to normalise mtx, bonus xp, or some broken new method, there's a solid chance the poster also posts in the rs3 sub. OP here doesn't, so fuck knows what his story is.
---
no-one who gives a shit about osrs would be so against konar being gutted, or send faux death threats for having the gall to care about the game's future. these aren't things that people who care about the state of the game do, they are the actions of selfish cunts who don't give a fuck about anyone except themselves, who only want their own gratification above all else, regardless of how deleterious it might be for the game as a whole - people that sit idly by allowing jagex to destroy their game because they're too blinded by an extra 20k xp an hour to see the bigger picture, the same way people sat back and allowed jagex to skullfuck us at the end of rs2.
---
those people still to this day fund our servers with spins and whatever other bollocks they've allowed jagex to sell to them, tacitly approving of what jagex has done and continues to do to rs3, and now they've decided to start sabotaging our game via the polls their game lacks so they have something to move to now that they've finally accepted their game is dying.

The screenshot
---
Could we have random world events? For example a goblin invasion at varrock?
---
For example how it would work is that certain areas of varrock would have different tasks ranging from low to high level players. Like protect the blue moon inn from waves of low level goblins which lower level players can go to.
---
Or have higher level players protect the king.
---
Skilling players can go around varrock fixing things or putting out fires.
---
A boss can also appear during the end of the event which every player can fight, but recommened for higher level players. While lower level players can help from the sidelines. Then a chest appears at the end of the event, maybe some sort of contribution to recieve rewards. 
---
Listen moron you are obviously just spouting off dumb ass Ben Shapiro wordvomit and thinking you are making sense but you still can‚Äôt even grasp the difference between the words woman and female so just shut the fuck up. I‚Äôve had better conversations with a goddamn dog
---
You take a hit to xp/h if you only do 1 inventory at a time. I did 200-300 bones at a time up to 99 prayer and only died like 2 or 3 times when a really big clan would show up with dragon spear and ballistas, bringing tank gear while risking more bones was easily worth it, anyone doing 1 inventory at a time is basically sacrificing xp/h to avoid some risk. Although I was in a 2k world in a less busy time, without a 2k world in a less busy time, the pkers would really cut into xp/h, not so much from killing you as you typically tank them in tank gear, but just from making you have to leave and bank constantly. I think it's pretty balanced how it is, if it becomes less rewarding then people won't be bothered with the risk vs reward and will stick to PoH.

What does lumby elite do
---
trading the crafter on the zmi world is not hard. what is he paying?

I didn't say it wasn't possible. I said it wasn't as easy as the other person was making it out to be.
---
I‚Äôd swap out for a dragon platebody and legs, red phat and dragon hunter lance 
---
Lol I hate when people leave, come back and expect me to leave after I‚Äôve already set up. 
---
I really hate jewlery that you gain the full effect from by just equiping at the end of the kill.
---
When I had the lance I used it there on task. Honestly it wasn't like a *wow* weapon for the couple trips I made. Whip felt about the same afterwards, if you have it or would feel comfortable buying one right now while the market is unstable I'd say go for it.
---
I wouldnt go breaking my bank just for one; but it would be useful for loads of other slayer tasks.
---
This is exactly what the -100IQ people want. They really think an hour long drake trip super afk noted bones and alchs is old school. Fuck I‚Äôve never been against a (proposed) update since EoC
---
Thing is, you're not entirely correct.
---
Hypothetically, I could have been at a friends house and crated the account myself.  Jagex aren't to know that.  How would they know who literally typed the details in?  How do they know who stays where?  How do they know I haven't moved?  How do they know who's device was used?  
---
They don't.  I literally told them and that's the reason I didn't get it back.  Had I been dishonest though, and told a lie, there's every possibility I could have got my account back.
---
Oh, and OP crated his account and got it recovered, go figure.
---
Can the numbers on the bank pin be in fixed positions on the button rather than in a random position on the button? 
---
What skilling content is there in arceuus that gives clue scrolls? There's an arrow pointing to it but zeah RC doesn't give clues. All I can think of is gangs.

I have all the gear and 92 range is that enough?

The runelite tracker can continue tracking as long as you are signed in with a Google account. It could be possible that they got the drop prior to the nerf

Google ‚Äúosrs quest guide‚Äù first link ü§ò
---
Hi
---
is it really 50? Playing using runelite, and this does not feel like 50fps, but a lot lower. 
---
Remember more take is better.
---
I can‚Äôt say I disagree
---
Don‚Äôt you mean drarkes? 
---
Definitely not. Even though this seems to be a pretty unique case and special set of circumstances, I doubt jagged will do it because it will open up a can of worms. Where will they draw the line in the future? Or was this truly a one-time thing? A lot of people would get and will get salty in the future about it. So to avoid navigating the complexity of that issue you just don‚Äôt do it at all
---
I just want this to become a thing so I can throw on the gas mask and head out to the desert to cook up some good stuff.

Dear god.... I thought the OP said dragon spear. FML

Please could you add a feature so we can chevk our slayer task streak at Wildy Slayer whilst on a Non-Wildy task, and vice versa?
---
Currently gathering points for Herb Sack and I'm reluctant to pick up a Krystilia task if it ends up being like 11th and something I don't want...
---
It‚Äôs freaking amazing how I need to answer this same type of question with a similar graphic for work but with barrels of oil
---
That is the opposite of dope.
---
It would be cool to implement contract systems in some of the old skilling guilds. With that being said, I think it can easily become OP to do the contracts - farming is already borderline.
---
Ooooh thats a tough one. I LOVE my SGS and it saves me stupid amounts of supplies, but the torture is a pretty dank upgrade. 
---
Torture &amp; Prims
---
SGS is overrated, meta now is just use DDS spec
---
Well, the fact that they‚Äôre looking elsewhere for the best point to vote on, whether or not it‚Äôs a point pushed by an influential minority, is, in my opinion, a better alternative than giving up on a vote because you see the vote as too positive or too negative to incur any change due to your personal vote. This happens far too much: you‚Äôll see 90% and not vote because it‚Äôll ‚Äúdefinitely pass‚Äù, or you‚Äôll see 60% and not vote yes even if you believed it should pass because you think it‚Äôs too far gone.
---
People looking elsewhere for confirmation on what to vote for is exactly what I want. That‚Äôs called looking into a topic before voting(informed voting).
---
Does Nieve give out boss tasks? Or konar? I unlocked them with points a little while ago, but haven't gotten a single boss task yet. Do I have to do something else to unlock them?
---
OR they could use jugs (3gp) and turn them into jugs of water (19) in the same amount of time with the same amount of effort with objectively higher profit margins. There is absolutely no reason to do vials instead of jugs.
---
Bandos should be the last thing you buy. Focus on a solid weapon, torture, fighter torso, barrows legs, fire cape, and an imbued zerker ring. 
---
I'd keep it myself tbh. Rare drop and all that.
---
Yeah that tag is a little different. I got it changed though, hopefully the strength bonus on this bad boy didn't get anyone in trouble
---
Love the osrs devs. Haters gonna hate, but I appreciate the team 100%
---
you can don't have to move around, you can just stand in one spot...
---
so apparently you like to be unfair and snotty to those who just want to relax and play the new content since release date.  At least the people who did runecraft before zeah potentially got better xp rates or profit. this poll is asking about a straight-up increase to drop rate
---
it doesn't give me the option to link my email
---
Back then, they were 1m but the economy wasn't nearly as inflated as it is today. That's why I said that by today's standards, the yh should be 10m. New content should be supplementing the existing content. If the even made a slight effort such as adding substantial enough sinks to keep these bosses alive, then I'd be content with it. The infernal axe and pickaxe were excellent updates imo. However, my point still stands earlier as to why I think that the slayer "instance" (isn't exactly as instance but close enough) should be removed. Yes, the wilderness bosses are far more cancerous than DKS but the bosses themselves aren't. They're safespottable but only hard due to their location in a PvP-enabled area.
---
That video was skewed to a large extent. I bought spins back in 2013 (which turned me into a hardcore conservative when it comes to updates and not wanting anything devalued). It takes time to spam redeem every xp lamp. However, they still devalued xp just as drop tables devalued skilling.
---
Before we go further, I will commend you greatly. No one I have disagreed to on the extent that we do has EVER managed to hold a civil conversation. As a matter of fact, it always turns into flame wars whereas this time, I actually learned something and still think that compromises are possible despite our differing ideologies and views on the game. I doubt it matters anyways since it's not like we're JMods arguing over how we should update the game but regardless, I've enjoyed having this intelligent discussion and have learned a couple of things from you.
---
If you look at the Inferno on a core level, it's not any harder than Jad. It's just a bunch of monsters that don't really have any special abilities (except for mages reviving shit and meleers digging). Corp at least has the dark core. Before pools, you needed to know how to tick eat and abuse other game mechanics just as you do in the inferno due to the massive amount of damage that you'd have taken otherwise in both of this content. The fact that it's become as easy as it has to kill this boss and is viable to solo on a much larger scale proves my point.
---
Who has the most wealth on an ironman then? Pretty sure Jagex admitted it somewhere but my knowledge over famous ironmen isn't high at all.
---
Is it in your POH menagerie? 
---
That‚Äôs most likely the reason my friend was banned, playing on the open hotel wifi. Honestly the only possible explanation as his account is not compromised. But idk it was just weird.
---
Alright, so it's like a pizza delivery?

Pay for the pizza, tip for the delivery?

Never was "instanced skilling" a thing (to my knowledge) in old runescape.

essentially. i have no idea what the cc is called though. sorry.

Literally this lmfao

Nope

"DeliverItems" CC

Piggybacking to say the ability also doesn't apply to antipoisons when used on broodoo victims at Tai Bwo Wannai.
---
Shit, I'm only 1m off 99 range. Maybe I'll just sell it and throw darts for the last level üòÇ 
---
DPS calc doesn't take into account missed hits of course but you can lure the hydra while only losing 1t each attack if done correctly, only time you lose a lot of dps is flame special on 3rd phase if you aren't able to cancel it, assuming the person ranging is attacking while dodging it.   
---
Tl:dr You miss hits but extremely few if doing correctly and cancelling 3rd phase special
---
Can we do the same for the Mythical Cape?    
---
One of the most prestigious quests of the game yet it has the default teleport animation. 
---
Rekt kiddo
---
Should I ask there?
---
Auth delay Please, region Lock list, Email to inform me that someone is trying to access my account or changed my email/password would be great.  Trade lockdown should restrict you for 3-7 days your preference after recovered account.  I can't think of anymore...

I'm talking about the concept of security, not a diss on your post.

Be honest, were you using a bot? A lot of free script have key loggers imbedded into them.

Lmaooo what are you on about. You literally click every fishing spot after every catch and run to a new part of the island when the side you‚Äôre on despawns since there aren‚Äôt enough fishing spots in one location to fill your inventory. 
---
Sure, you could stay in 1 spot the entire time for very reduced xp rates but the method isn‚Äôt setup with that in mind. 
---
Vote no, it‚Äôs your voice. I‚Äôd rather not grind 100 hours for a cosmetic fish sack. But if that‚Äôs up your alley be my guest, majority of people would rather not though since it is a cosmetic. 
---
I take both. I switch to salve when killing skeletons
---
Only discussed with one ironman doing the same thing with lance but it's true that claw is rare and very likely to get as last unique not including pet

im sorry bug we cant trust jagex, hiding the polls puts way to much power in their hands.

And make pking even more profitable?
