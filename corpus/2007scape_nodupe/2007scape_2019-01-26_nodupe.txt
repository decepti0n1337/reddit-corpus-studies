How is this a complaint?
---
---
---
How is the Runescape community STILL having massive account security issues? It's been so, so long, bros. Seriously. 
---

---
Unique password for the account. Considering how often RS is targeted, unique email for account. 2FA on both the email and the account. Ezpz.
---
Yeah like did he not notice Mod Ash sneaking in to his house, make note of his penis length/girth the night he signed up so Jagex can order players by cock size? What a pleb.
---
I kind of miss those days where friends lists would fill up so quickly that people would actually complain about the size of the friends list being way too small. I don‚Äôt think that ever happens anymore unless you‚Äôre a streamer or something. People just added each other for the hell of it back then, and didn‚Äôt feel the need to talk to each other without at least 7 layers of irony protecting them. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just cuz of the way things are now, but genuine interaction is so hard to find anymore - and not just in this game. Kind of blows. 
---
Until you get recovered with your old leaked information.
---
I thought about giant mole but can't afford dh right now
---
I've check barrows out some too, is the best setup for just to use ibans on all of them except ahrim?
---
Hes too honest to lie
---
if polls are hidden then jamflex can manipulate them without our knowledge
---
I defiently don't have the elite dairy done, should i just skip dks for now?
---
&gt;no deception
---
Deliberately abusing another players ignorance by exploiting a misleading system is, in fact, extremely deceptive.
---
Not actively lying doesn't mean you're not decieving somebody 
---
JamScape (*„Äç&gt;–¥&lt;)„Äç‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
---
Haha, I get it. It's because of the recent poll controversy right? Very funny meme! 
---
Dota is a videogame under the category of a MOBA. If you're not asian you're not allowed to be good at it.
---
instead of jam it could be preserved fruits or chutney
---
It's very hard to bot for a long stretch of time and not be banned nowadays even if you run it like a normal human would play.. And botting agility is a death sentance for your account 
---
&gt;You are severely overestimating how much agility levels and graceful truly help outside of activities that have a good amount idle time built in.
---
No i'm pretty sure you're massively understating the amount of running involved in many activities. Teles only get you so far. 
---
did you make a cheeky 5m off the bone whip hype tho? 
---
I once saw a stranger max at rogues den and nobody was there to celebrate with him except those of us that happened to also be cooking there. FFS people join a CC or something. 
---
it ain't much but
---
Lucky...gave it a go last night but I ran out of supplies and had a crap Jad spawn...trying again soon!!
---
The subject was the US not UK, why did he mention the UK?
---
I tried buying all the Cheese and Potatoes from my general store down the street to make Cheesy Potatoes to resell for profit but they wouldn‚Äôt buy back. 
---
0/10 would listen to this advice. 
---
I use to bot back in 2007 and 8. I got away with it for awhile until I got lazy with it and left it on 24/7. I was curious of bots when I first came back, but every site seems so sketch and every script wasnt even being updated anymore. Plus the game is way more fun when played legit. And agility is a death sentence? What got me banned awhile back was thieving lol
---
maybe blowpipe could stay the way it is, the upkeep cost is pretty high and they give darts value. Nerf blowpipe and both scales/darts possibly crash.
---
It's more that conventional weapons are so bad that it makes it appear the pipe op.
---
OSRS Advice is a great clan.
---
What am I looking at
---
It's best not to play in actual full screen when doing jad. Just use the resizeable/stretched thing or whatever. You're using RL so you can still keep the draw distance at a high number so you can see the entire cave. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not sure why you're bothering trapping the healers though. My first time doing cape I had bad stats, low hp and pray and range. I just aggro'd the healers onto me. The 2 jad kills I had I think I was tanking like 3 of them lol, but it's a lot easier to line them up and just be tanking 1 vs getting them trapped behind italy rock and what not. That just takes to much time man, and you're bound to make mistakes. 
---
By the way - you were indeed to late on the prayer switch. Rewatch it. You activate your mage prayer literally a fraction of a second before the fire ball comes out, and you need to activate it a little before that to compensate for any server lag or delays. My suggestion to you is that you're doing to much with running over there with the healers. 
---
absolutely incredible
---
Then they should switch to melee. That's how the triangle works
---
&gt;Edit: unfortunately, we are unable to comment further.
---
  
---
Did they tell you to keep your Fukong mouths shut?
---
*makes fun of other persons gear*
---
*gets mad when people are trolling him about their own gear*?
---
Exactly
---
Yes, that happens when you're inactive for a long time.
---
Your displayname gets released so others can use it if you're not around anymore.
---
Not activating windows will do that to ya
---
Anyone else not get it?
---
Not how rng works. Starting a new account doesn't change anything.
---
Its in the settings then beside the speaker option there will be a man with a ? And in that menu you can click on the lightbulb and that will allow you to set the values of loot that pops up and allows you to change the high alc warning amount. 
---
I was thinking this the other day aha too true good bud. Too true
---
The shit this sub has to offer keeps getting better and better.
---
I never made fun of his gear. I'm calling him a beast, which is positive
---
Haha, I get it! It's because your character is black. Very funny meme! 
---
I agree, Verf and Settled are really entertaining to watch.  
---
I found Caveman Only pretty interesting too, not a UIM but still really cool seeing what he has achieved (99 thieving and 99 ranged with a bone chow)
---
Time to save a hundred caskets up and wait for an update where they add new clue scroll reward items. I feel like that's why they aren't stackable to begin with.
---
50/50?
---
Guys I just had an idea hit me, I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt think of this before....
---
.

let‚Äôs contact Jagex through their customer support and ask them to hide the poll results!

Lmao Killin it bruh

I have over 10K white berries on my Ironman just from picking them whilst running through Ardougne. I have 60 Herb, but I‚Äôve never used a single prayer potion on slayer (only bossing so far) but if it required white berries, I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat. For every task. This is wayyyy too op.

Hangs out with Alfie &gt; gets banned for rwt

Coincidence? I think not. You could literally see the happiness fade away from Alfie's eyes on stream when they pked the claws and knew they couldn't loot them.
---
You're 49 kc and you're complaining that you're dry?
---
Imagine having an alt. I struggle with motivation to get shit done on my main like questing. Then having to do it again? üòë 
---
Sad to realize a nice YouTuber got his main account banned, and that for good. Kudos for honesty though.
---
Most likely he sold the gold.
---
Wasn't this already polled?
---
Why are we begging for features that are already settled? Do y'all see me begging for marks at all agility courses? 
---
I got a perm forum mute from the classic erra, with no evidence or reasoning on ban. It's as if it never happened or was done manually by a mod.
---
This one is at least 14+ years. 
---
Not that I ever use the forums, I'd just like my first account to have a cleaner record.
---
At the end of the day my point is I‚Äôm sick of seeing your ‚Äúmy account of 5bil is hacked and gone‚Äù posts. That‚Äôs all I was saying in this whole thing. I understand it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion. Calling people retard is where I stop the conversation, not cool. Agree to disagree mate. 
---
Classic or rs2 or osrs?
---
It's a good idea but you have to look at it as jagex being a business.  They want f2p to suck and all the good content to be members so that way you pay for membership.  
---
I guess this is a joke, but I'll still bite: "ook" is a dutch word, and afrikaans is a language developed from dutch

Doing slayer instead of profit dragon

He probably sold  stuff. That guy does not need any help in the game.

Might've gotten an infernal cape for someone maybe.. but anything is speculation for now

Here ya go boomer https://youtu.be/Kp5A_1UAJog?t=2948
---
So beastly he saw this reddit post and had the imgur link deleted
---
technically, osrs is NEW and RS3 is old. so...
---
But... it was never promised. Its just something they‚Äôd like to do that is a byproduct of adding an official clan system 
---
Thanks man, that sounds amazing. I'll try that asap.
---
Weird flax but ok
---
Didn't knew Brazil was actually on Gielinor.
---
So a guy that used to own a tbow couldn't manage to Google if graceful gloves work. Or maybe you are just full of shit.
---
F2P GETS NOTHING. YOU LOSE. GOOD DAY, SIR.
---
If you have no skills then the name gets cleaned up by jagex randomly.  If you actually have skills on the account then it won't.
---
If you have xp the time for name removal goes up.  It's basically years if you've actually used your account.
---
I fully agree! However I think its important they find a balance, if it sucks too much then people may be pushed away, if its too fun people wont become a member.
---
Perhaps somebody getting super lucky and rolling on a real valuable drop could give them that boost of inspiration that leads to getting membership, or perhaps help buy their first bond :P
---
Why is the RS3 arm black?
---
Did settle start the snowflake im on YouTube(ik they been on this sub forever now) or did he just popularize it?
---
Perm ban all accounts pl0x
---
Support would allow PKer loot to have another use.
---
He's a man of many talents. He could also be the lead musician, quest writer, accountant, and lead of customer support.
---
Not just over exaggeration, he's made music before, plays violin, on his free time does accounting work for free with non-profits, made and was apart of many quests, worked in customer support long before all this, and has a HUGE lead on responses to twitter, with many people directly asking ash before customer support team.
---
He in large could be CEO imo, though yes we would see a lot less dev work from him, if any at all.
---
Yeah. It's annoying to see the GE full of spam and many of them are absolute scum. They will insult you if you give them "too little". I made the mistake of trying to help out a "noob" with 5k gold because I was naive. He declined the trade, told me to fuck myself and said I was insulting him. At the time my bank was worth 30k
---
Lol this made me laugh harder than it should
---
Biggest downside of this IMO is that jagex will probably cut any potential ties to him as a content creator, props for honesty though
---
Imagine making a rant post and not even knowing what you are ranting about
---
this
---
No
---
people that buy gold very rarely get banned, let alone perm lol
---
Reminds me of the linebacker from the replacements 
---
D
---
I know its become a meme to hate on f2p, but I think its important that as the playerbase grows and the game changes over time that f2p see atleast a tiny bit of love outside of a novice quest every 2 to 3 years and the occasional single player bossfight.
---
They should've, not sure why they only banned one of his accounts.
---
my guess is someone put in a buy offer for like 1m and no one else was selling an opal machete at all except this guy so his sold to him for the 750k that he put it in for

Jesus dude get a life smh

I don't mean in real life, I just mean in the game. The Ape Atoll residents all have African names and their architecture is reminiscent of Aksumite origin. I didn't even realize they were monkeys until half way through the quest
---
it would be runescape 2.5 if anything
---
iirc selling gold usually gets all your accounts banned
---
When they made new seeds with the Kebos update they didn't retroactively update the old nests, I assume it'd be possible to do with clue scrolls too.
---
OSRS is based on a backup of RS2 from 2007. But it has since received countless updates and changes that it's not really RS2 anymore.
---
To call it that wouldn't really be an accurate description.

Ok thanks for the help

Took me a few tries at 70 range 65 def with rcb to get my first kill ever. I can't remember exactly what I used but I managed to finish without having to pray flick. I had blessed d hide, snake boots, glory, ring of wealth, black dhide shield, netz helm. All pretty welfare. It's possible but took me just over two hours for first kill

80% chance, 0.8

Your 4545 number would be accurate if Ava's was a 78% chance, not 80%. No need to simulate it either, as the math is relatively simple.

It's a game, guys. He didn't break any real life laws. He didn't kill anyone. He broke the terms of agreement...to a game, and he faced the consequences.

Damn. I'm really disappointed in him. He at least seemed remorseful in this video, but I think it's going to take a very long time for people to trust him again and for good reason.

Imagine being so brain dead you come to a Reddit page about a video game to "protest" about your child-like hatred for a president. "Wahh wahh orange man bad pffff boo hoo". I must admit I do like seeing you guys shit yourselves over a decent president.

Either way, you should be thanking him for protecting the people with closed borders and deporting murderers and criminals.

Why would he suddenly need money as YouTube won't be enough?

Bingo. If barbarian potions kept dosage the same PLUS gave a small health boost, they'd be the default option for potions.

I'm happy people can make a living selling runescape gold. Good for him, hopefully he can make more money to sell.
---
Hey OP, can you try being even more confusing?
---
Fell off? He's been growing. 
---
So why would someone on reddit sell to you for less when they could clearly sell it for more than you were paying?  Use your brain.  If there's a lack of supply, of course it's going to sell for more than you want to pay.

It could be a sign that Jagex is performing very well. The company may be worth significantly more than what Fukong bought it for, so they want to sell it for a premium.

He should get the same punishment as everyone else. A perm ban is well deserved, this is as bad as promoting gambling.

Lol this is why I hesitate to post my ideas, the numbers would get torn to shreds......

I think its the fact that he has 3 enchantments which are much less likely than emblems.

Getting 3 of those in that 49kc is impressive tbh.
---
What is so bad about rwt other than jagex not liking it?

Yeah the routing is completely different. Enterprise routers route at layer 8 and home routers do it at layer 3 right?

Yeah you're actually the account recover lol. I was added on the account "N" I appeared as a smiley face in the Cc. This name has been inactive for ~3-4 years not gaining a single xp in either versions of the game, so I found it oddly suspicious when I saw the name change on my friends list as it happened. (When 'N' wasn't online.) The name changed on Wednesday to "00dkk3". 2 days later (today) it changed back to "N" the same exact way it did before. (assuming it was done on the website both times,) before it finally logged in and appeared online to me. I trailed the name when it appeared online on my alt to World 70 on RuneScape 3 and saw the account trade another account before appearing online again back on Old School RuneScape. It logged out again and I noticed in the Cc I was removed as a friend. Please make sure this was legitimately recovered and not some hijackers testing the waters of their newly recover one character. (or if a trade for the name went bad or something.) /u/Mod_Stevew /u/shaunyowns

Part of the reason low level produce isn't worth anything is because it can be bought from shops for 1-2 gp each. While adding a worthwhile use for them is good, it likely won't increase the value of them significantly when they can be bought for so cheap.
---
Also seems way too strong as is. Doing a straight comparison towards like barbarian mix, they seem stronger and more accessible compared to already unused content.
---
Why should i pay like 5 bucks for a bond when i can buy 5m for the same 5 dollars? Because for one jagex is making money and for the other some random dude...

You heard the man, slam some dildos on his hat and call it a day!

Buying the gp from some dude is way cheaper that's why

It's a fucking flair he isn't rubbing it in people's faces. Also it's an achievement held in high regard here, considering it's the fucking subreddit dedicated to osrs ffs. Let people enjoy and spend time doing what they want without bullying them.
---
I like V's vampire ironman concept since it's not that limited, but still affects the way he does things. While he can technically do everything in the game, he has to plan the way he does things differently since he can't, say, do agility for 2 weeks straight.
---
Ok can you explain to me where I'm wrong? Are you saying that no ISPs give home routers private IPs as their external IP address? Or is it that ISPs dont have redundant routes to their customers? Or are you saying that a traceroute will show the external IP address of a users router without being directed to it?

Agreed, it shouldn't be nerfed.
---
i'm not really here to disrespect or critique castlebobs content, I think the idea of the original post was to kind of poke fun of a bunch of random ironman content being made and then abandoned almost immediately after.  With no context I thought this was a possible example.  I agree with his logic of abandoning the series, and I think that still fits with the original post because who wants 10 different ironman accounts with different crazy restrictions.

Yes. Look up an nmz guide on YouTube, soup has a good one (not a joke) specifically about points/h

IT was unusual. What a friend did was such a blatently obvious bad idea he ahd to have been trying to get banned on purpose. Its thing I dont think jagex has really had to ever ban anyone for because anyone who has a large enough playerbase to yknow successfully use rs to promote gambling sites isnt going to do that.
---
Dunno a single other case of that ban reason. 
---
I c bajs forsen1
---
very substantial. if you want points enable all of them. ignore bad or annoying bosses and use the power up orbs to clear them
---
Im brand new to pking do I decided to make a f2p range/2h pure (1def) to learn the roped but is there a certain order I should train melee, attk or range?
---
Thanks! It worked perfectly :)

---
Add another house patty world
---
why
---
i look forward to every swampletics and karamja only episodes 
---
I was in there at the time we also had some guys asking for such a massive amount of items that we couldnt tell if he was trolling or not. That somehow progressed into this which was great.
---
Like I said above, one way is to make defensive stats of bosses matter. One major problem with OSRS at the moment is that boss defensive stats just don't matter most of the time. Bosses like Corp and Vetion are great designs from a defensive standpoint. On corp you can only use spears, and on vetion you have to use a crush weapon. It creates more opportunity for niche upgrades, while also nerfing general BiS dps items without actually lowering their offensive capabilities.
---
If more bosses had stats that mattered like that, things like BP would be way more balanced. 
---
A mixture of everything. You need some specific bosses like dream mentor and having more bosses increases the point gain. You're also a low level. Check YouTube for a guide on farming points.
---
Then you have too much hate in your heart
---
I literally mentioned the importance of it in PvP you bonobo. Literally every time I commented. 
---
You act like the healing is exclusive to magic, forget that range also has AoE damage. Stuns exist on multiple weapons, not exclusive to magic. 
---
Not saying it‚Äôs not useful, you assumed my claim. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs underpowered. There are aspects of each spellbook that need to be updated to be relevant in the game today. You mentioned playing RS2, then you should know how different the game is right now and how irrelevant half of the spells are. 
---
Kbow is more old school, that‚Äôs what I remember using before the rune cbow came out. 
---
Cats&gt;Dogs.
---
It's very strange and was in my opinion a much too harsh punishment, but I guess jagex didn't want him playing thier games at all.
---

---
Maybe just maybe there's a direct correlation on twitch scam streams rising in popularity?? This is not Jagex fault imo despite it not being popular....
---
Think these guys will ever get banned? I've added them to friend's list after reporting them so interested to see what happens over the next few weeks...
---
The price isn‚Äôt set by rarity alone, also by the usefulness of the item, unless it‚Äôs a super rare like 3a (even then they have their uses). People determine prices based on how much they are willing to pay. If people aren‚Äôt willing to pay 20m more for peg boots than prim boots, then that‚Äôs the end of that.
---
Like if there was an update for a third item that was EVEN rarer than ranger boots, and you need all three items now (pegasian crystal, ranger boots, new item) to make the pegasian boots, if people aren‚Äôt willing to pay more than 35m for pegasian boots, then the pegasian crystal, ranger boots, and new item will all have to be lower in price, and can‚Äôt add up to more than 35m.
---
The levels needed are so low it doesn't even matter. However ranged then melee is better for the ranged armor and having str 10-20 levels above atk is a good idea.
---
YEP. Its just a dungeon with a boss fight in one of the rooms
---
Trying to get banned on purpose lmao, are you trolling? He was shitting his pants afterwards immediately, begging Jagex to let him make YT videos on a new character. He did it because he got offered close to $50k and thought he found a loophole as he wasn't trading gold himself.
---
You don't know any other cases because no one with a large audience was retarded enough to do what A Friend did. 
---
Why?
---
You sound like a runecraft pker lol
---
When you're in the pool
---
He calls that ‚Äúpking‚ÄùüòÇ
---
chaos elemental and kbd are the most common along with kraken; you could try those
---
I wonder why a friend got chain banned and kemp got only his main. Like is it case by case or because kemp‚Äôs Ironman is rare and brings a lot of attraction to the game. 
---
This is the first time I clicked a comment to reply and have literally been at a complete loss of words goodbye
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Thanks my tiny thumbs mobile only Ironman was feeling a bit under powered with the regular sized icons. 
---
If they nerf pipe therell be a pretty big shitshow. They might make it more expensive or something but its the core range weapon, too much content is balanced around it now. If anything it would make more sense to buff kbow, cbow, crossbows, buff non trident magic etc.
---
Both raids, inferno, stuff like hydra is balanced around the current state of bp. Nerfing it would be a big job because all that content would require a rebalance as well.
---
I'd trade 10k for the grandma.
---
use dharok at 90+ hp only. For now, stick to full obby + obby necklace + obby sword (xil-ak)
---
What is gp/h at Ardy Knights with rogue outfit and 99 thieving? Is there a method that yields more GP/H for an iron? 99rc with bloods is a single payout, and I need more
---
How high many you ares? 
---
karamja only, caveman only, v the vampire, zeah citizen, soooo many more
---
settled is the most popular recently, but he already had a larger following than everyone else before he started.
---
Support, but livestock first please
---
Yeah II think your right, I did all my testing with range and rigour, so perhaps melee is better to just stack strength
---
I mean we still have some items that seem to remain static when doing some animations like that. If they didnt want to put much effort into it, the quiver and scroll would remain static, like a necklace does for example, when you teleport it remains a static form on your neck. 
---
hmmmmMM Mmmm.mm
---
Karamja and caveman make vids? Ik they post updates here

Pick one.
---
Why what :s 
---
Or just tick eat. 
---
That is freaking hilarious. 
---
There's good farming bots in every game ever though. I agree it deserves a perm ban but it's not a huge deal
---
Thats expected points for a non point focused setup
---
Honestly don't care to chase people around with limited amount of money/items on them, unless it's other PKers. But I still fail to see how people are griefing for playing the game and using Wilderness for what it was intended for.
---
More popular, probably.
---
I have more respect for scammers than I do for beggars. Not by much, but still. I wish there was a rule against begging so I could report them both.
---
PLEASE !
---
yes
---
I disagree with you tho so you r wrong
---
Also it wouldnt represent your actual ammo count, 1 arrow would display a full quiver. 
---
Yep, some of them might be ok but because so many beggars are so scummy begging makes all of them look scummy by default
---
I saw 2 beggars earlier just openly talking to each other about how much money they make doing it, one of them apparently making up to 1m an hour just begging for arrows whilst wearing a cape instead of avas because people just throw thousands of arrows at them
---
I genuinely don't understand why people donate to beggars on osrs, either ignore them or give them advice like for example "hey go get avas its useful". If they genuinely needed ammo then you still helped them, if it's a fake beggar then they can fuck off since all they got is information they probably already knew
---
I wish I had your confidence
---
Less than the odds that you don't understand how probability or RNG in games works.
---
Awwww I just bought a new pitchfork though
---
Yeah, ornate pool is fucking huge.
---
It entirely depends on skill and level of the account. Some low level accounts are more impressive with a fire cape than a skill cape. 
---
In my opinion for a general rule of thumb:
---
Fire cape &gt; cooking, fletching, and fm 
---
All other skill capes &gt; fire cape
---
He was using his runescape platform and audience to promote a shady gambling website in order to make quick cash. Jagex doesnt want their game associated with a shitty 3rd party gambling platform. If all of their content creators started accepting partnerships like that, it would make their game look fucking awful.
---
Well I cant see anything wrong with having a lot different kind of pets for all kinds of people.

My inferno pet wont lose its prestige or meaning if someone has a construction pet for eg.

You're under arrest, grandma!

I have it set so all Jagex email are priority to show up but for some reason this one was in spam.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much hate on my post, glad someone likes it on mobile like I do :(

---
Didn't they specifically say it was because he was rwting by getting in game gold for the promotion
---
Knights are 250k gp at 99 with outfit, the other question I'm not sure tbh
---
good vido
---
Wtf I did 7 tasks and didn‚Äôt get a single drop and gave up 
---
Melee loses to magic because of binds, and negative magic resist on armor, not because mage armor has high melee resists. In fact, if you fighting a mage or range you should use slash, crush is meant to be for melee vs melee.
---
(I know this is obvious just wanted to write it down)
---
You don't see people pking runecrafters as griefers? That's what the wildy is for?
---
Lol
---
He blowpiped his way to the pet. Blowpipe pet living up to its name
---
Which is ironic because Crumbs got chainbanned despite only botting on a single level 3 account....
---
Interesting is this depicting how thick the spinning dinner plate surrounded by an ice wall we call earth is?
---
Plssss
---
Setup a box spread. Its literally risk free money.
---
so instead of giving one of their biggest content creators a warning, they create a new rule on the fly and insta ban every single account, including ironmen accounts? LOL ok
---
ironymanbtw
---
Yes it is, there's no official documentation, but it's been said multiple times.  If you do it for a friend, fine, but doing it for people you don't know and advertising it isn't.
---
I believe that also
---
Caveman only has a youtube channel and he streams full time on twitch !
---
Except if he‚Äôs 80 combat I highly doubt he has the slayer lvl for kraken
---
Yes I am fuck you
---
That‚Äôs the way I look at it. Some skill capes are very impressive. 99 slayer takes absolutely forever to get so I would be way more impressed when I see one rather a fire cape. But walking by a 99 fm just gives me a good giggle.
---
What about the other ones? 
---
Who gives a fuck?  It's not hello kitty dress up online
---
Right? That would be like $40 at most RWT. I don‚Äôt see what that has to do with anything lmfao 
---
Plzzzzz
---
where'd you hear that at?
---
If you read the Reddit post that jmod made about the ban, they state that it was mainly for the promotion of gambling, not rwt.
---
Except spells are 5 tick so it's still likely better dps to melee with a whip on most tasks
---
Hard to believe people actually alch to 99, auto click or not. Ever heard of bursting?
---
These are amazing designs, holy hell
---
That's fucking mod mat k's dog

right? he made a mistake and paid the consequence.

Actually I work now full time in CS, first as web developer and have just recently been asked to switch to AI development to help create 3d image data from a 2d image. (Using techniques such a line detection and shadow/light angles together with "a learning set" to make it "always" correct just like us humans can guess the 3d shape).
---
I've not ever found a task I did have to say: "sorry this is not possible", or even "sorry but I can't do this".

Yes, it is against the rules.

Wont somebody think of the children?
---
are you intentionally being dense or what? all he said what afriend did was really dumb and not common.
---
Wow that‚Äôs kinda lucky 
---
Some dude in youtube comments looked up rates and also assumed he sold anywhere from 3--8B I believe.
---
Yeah take it with a grain of salt. But if he's selling gold, a few billion seems rather reasonable imo. Especially since he got banned for it.
---
yikes
---
I thought doing it for a friend wasn't ok, especially if you are a streamer... that's why we need an official rule posted about this, to clear up any confusion/misunderstandings
---
The idea was that you could only stack reward caskets. You would still have to "finish" the clue to obtain another clue scroll, just that you would be able to stack caskets and have a big ol' opening

Just upvote and leave then

If you don't be all vocal about it and stream it, nothing is going to happen
---
You‚Äôd be surprised set that bad boy up and come back from an 8 hour shift at work to 400k+ xp 
---
I think I made it pretty clear, that I don't consider them griefers. Wilderness is for killing people, with/without items, while skilling, while fighting or not fighting back. If you go there, expect to meet people wanting to kill other players. Wilderness was made for people to attack other people, which is what they're doing by killing them at Earth Warriors, while Runecrafting or while standing in level 1-6 in Edge looking for BH targets.
---
Why do you think they placed Runecrafting or other skilling/PvM things in there in the first place? Probably to get people out there and to give some PKers something to do, like killing people doing these things? - Do you think they put these things out there, if they considered killing people doing them for 'griefing'?

---
More gp added to the game is just what we need
---
Which is why I was comparing it to level 110-119 and not players with maxed atk and str.
---
At Max stats range has the highest dps, followed by melee. But fire surge definitely pulls it's weight in the mid-high level area.
---
I never said it was the best anyways, just that I personally found it satisfying to use, and noticed my kills going much faster than meleers at my level.
---
Skotizo helm needs some obnoxious ass demon horns to make up for the fact that purple goes with nothing but bursting gear.

Thank you for this. I usually get a feeling that runescape players only play LoL and it makes me sad.

I remember around 3 months back I was killing him over and over again on the PvP worlds. He started to get mad and started talking about what he was risking and how I needed it. He told me he had around 12b in platinum tokens on his main account. Idk if that‚Äôs true but that means he could have potentially sold around 9k usd irl.
---
It's hardly something a new player is just going to think of doing, it's like explaining stupid local laws to new people in town, there's absolutely no need because it's not something someone does.
---
Nice one OP. I bought mine for 800k. Yeah it sucked to lose that money but you know what? I never need to worry about it again and now my account is higher leveled i can make 800k back in half an hour. If you ever need to make a similar choice again, dont stress. As long as you‚Äôre progressing your account, money comes easier and easier. Gz
---
Sure if you're a really low level, but for any mid-high level players she's really quite garbage.
---
Yeah I can def agree with you there on dinhs. Dumbest item in the game lol
---
Is anyone growing Celastrus outside of farming contracts or ironmen? Its definitely not profitable. I cant Imagine its had much of an effect besides a speculation bubble.
---
Why does it need that? Why can't achievements be an intrinsic reward?

Honestly, I don't know how to answer that.

&gt;It is also against the rules to bet on the outcome of another player's activities within the game, for example: how long it will take to kill a monster, or the outcome of a duel (commonly referred to as "commission staking").
---
It's explicitly in the rules
---
It all depends on your style and preference, my main has similar stats (higher strength though) and I found I struggled with pking. 
---
I made a pure and got it to decent stats (75 magic, 60 ranged and 65 att and are.) and did desert treasure in two weeks time (I work a lot so I‚Äôm sure you can do it in less) and I find that to be WAAAAY better and more fun.

Rushing and luring aren't against the rules lmao

---
I've got multiple 99s, I don't feel a need to show them off though, why do you give a fuck about other players opinions, do you want an ego boost for your pixels in a game?  Who cares what your character looks like.  Wear what's good for the situation you are in.  If you are walking around doing nothing, nobody cares what your man looks like

Technically, he is selling property that isn‚Äôt his for real life gain, sure the account is his, but not really. In a way it‚Äôs stealing how they see it. However I don‚Äôt like he did it, his apology is much much better then A friends and we should already respect that

What's the change for red slayer helm?
---
you forgot a friend
---
F2p player getting back into the game with a new account, recommendations on wether to pure mage, warrior or archer.
---
Also what money making skill to focus?
---
Will take any other tips as well!
---
Mod ashes of his burned victims 
---
Got claw at 1kc lol don't even have any slayer points 
---
If we all boycott the game and end our memberships and only play F2P content, would that lower Jagex's value down to the ground so they can buy the company back?
---
Yes, but melee can slap on hides which have barely any negative melee bonuses, and then negate their entire weakness vs magic. 
---
My point if we're going to look at "fixing" the combat triangle so to speak, there are a lot more important fixes than lowering ranges ability to hit on melee armor.
---
The other accounts couldn‚Äôt loot them because they hopped worlds. If you log in after something is dropped, it won‚Äôt appear to you. But someone eventually came and picked them up.

Literally the opposite happened here. What?

&gt;Or more likely, create a dependence on handouts. Giving noobs free money doesn't teach them how to make money, it just shows them that other people might be willing to give them free money.
---
I mean, if you have zero faith in people whatsoever, and assume the worst. And besides, not the point. That money isn't supposed to teach anything. It is a means to an end in a system that requires it.
---
&gt;You do more good by showing them some skills than you do just giving them money.
---
Except you won't show them skills either, you'd just get on your high horse about already being in a position to do these things.  It's a false dichotomy either way to suggest that you either aid people financially or through other less immediately impactful ways. You can do both. Neither precludes the other. 
---
thnx
---
What's wrong with having more pets? It's literally just more content.
---
You just have to pay for the item in gp or loot, the delivery itself is free.
---
I lost it at ‚Äúonly talk to squirrels‚Äù
---
Can you link to a video of that? It sounds interesting 
---
I've heard someone having this issue with RuneLite before, but never heard if or hoe they fixed it. I suggest posting this same thing on r/runelite or joining their Discord server and asking there.
---
Has Jagex given any indication about a timeframe for hiding the poll results yet? 
---
Or improving account security for that matter.

Ranged is the best, but depends on your playstyle.

Money making skill, work on mining and Runecrafting. On f2p worlds mining is crap because of bots and goldfarmers.

&gt;You're the guy talking about running from town to town and you wanna talk about common sense lol the fuck you think this is, the dark age of runescape?
---
... just because I used running between towns as an example. I mean do you actually think you can teleport at your leisure between every single fucking settlement in this entire game whenever you need to or what? How does a new player get to Witchhaven without running between towns? How do you get to the Grand Tree, or the Gnome Village, or Yanille?
---
The abyssal sire had some jaw fangs that I tried to add to the helm. They are attached at the side of the helm. I also focused on adding more black compared to the greenish black they have currently. It was difficult to come up with a solid design for the red helm.

Ohh there it is! Tyvm :D

Just try a few and see if you get lucky, you could go like 10k dry on something and get somethi g else on 1 kc
---
More than glad to let the mods check previous IPs, email, etc to confirm that it's me but i genuinely appreciate the prudence. Can also log in to the youtube account where I posted a vid &gt;10 years ago of me walking around (though i'd prefer not to since it's kinda cringey)

never done TOB but all I want is a pet Sotetseg

Luring is considered scamming, but I don‚Äôt know that it always was, or if it was when Ronan lured.

Depending on how often you are performing these shitty jobs, in America, it would be illegal for her not to!

Skotizo horns and kalphite jaws need to be dialed back a little, but other than that...these are amazing
---
Found it, thanks! 
---
If I would say one thing: Watching Settled's videos is much easier. They're *both* good, but the Karamja guy's videos don't pull you in waiting for the next video like Settled does. 
---
That said, Verf's videos at 1.5x or 1.75x speed is quite enjoyable. On ep 2 currently.
---
Yes I know I'm answering the guys question why we can't have more than 1 clue
---
Dude that quest takes forever, it‚Äôs a huge accomplishment 
---
What is this a picture of? 
---
It wasn't a feature on release, but it was added pretty soon after. It is entirely possible they got 99fm before it was added back when the drop table was broken af. 
---
Emily only got temporarily banned
---
Well I guess you've got me there
---
Because it destroys the whole idea of a "virtual world where everyone starts a new and works to "win" - whever you decide is winning".
---
You know the whole part of a game that make people play games.
---
This is my thing. This fucking subreddit is loaded with people that for some reason are against more security. How could anyone actually be against more security, whether you think you need it or not, unless you're part of the groups hacking people.

Crazy delusional Rot members

which runelite setting shows how long you're frozen by ice barrage for?
---
Ok I guess that's fair. Buuuut shaaame for shaaame
---
Then why do people do it if its free? 
---
I'm still struggling heavily with using entitled as a bad word :S Honestly we're all really entitled in many ways which is a positive thing and we should be grateful for it and honestly I'm still not sure if that's being used as straight up negative word or sarcastically 
---
well keep memeing and baiting if thats your thing, or try to focus and decide yourself on the poll questions if youre worried about being influenced. The videos might help. Gl.

Go to 1750+ skill worlds and you‚Äôll be good

Wish I could help you man but i'm just as clueless as you
---
You won't find that many fights while wearing full rune because of how often opponents will hit zeros. Most will just run away because of how tanky you are.

Kinda surprised they didnt ban all his accounts considering he was selling(?). Thinking his ironman is safe is pretty arrogant.
---
I saw the opportunity and I took it
---
hey if i am doing a greater demon task nearby and i see you miss a rune full helm drop and then let it despawn i sure am grabbing the next one that i can see
---
It‚Äôs a choice, not a mistake
---
Thanks. I finished all the f2p quests so pking is all I have left I guess. Can't really afford members but I'm having fun pking!
---
Waste of dev time

This is underrated

Mod SavAsh?
---
The only cape im really impressed with at this point is infernal and max. They both carry the same prestige the fire cape and skill capes carried back in the day respectively
---
Originally back in the day at his height of popularity he was. There was a couple Runescape content creators that got signed to Machinima. If I remember correctly NightmareRH was one of them besides TehNoobShow.
---
if you can barely kill jad i would not ever in a billion to the power of 50 tune in to your stream

They got baught out by another network. I heard it was Fullscreen that bought them.

Not sure why this would get downvoted lol. Am i missing something here? Its a great app for mobile players that literally acts like a client for mobile. To my knowledge there isnt one out right? Is this against the rules or something?

Once you reach a certain point you never run back to your gravestone anymore because all your gear is augmented/degradable.

I didn't realize how amazing waifu pet's dialogue is
---
Adamant is teir 30 black dhide is tier 70. The reason it's cheap is black dragons are farmed through brutals. It's not a problem with the armour. It's a problem with how easily materials are obtained.
---
I suppose. But it would be kinda weird to use the same thing to make Melee and Ranged Gear. I'm sure there are some cases where this happens already, but Melee Gloves into Ranged Hide Armor is a bit strange. And also kinda unneeded since the Leather is plenty useful as is so why let it make armor when that could be a future reward?
---
No, I‚Äôve got great rewards from lower stuff and shit from higher seeds.
---
When I‚Äôm doing a slayer task that‚Äôs cannonable, I set my cannon down to make anyone not crash me, but I actually don‚Äôt put any ammo in it.

Very wise indeed my friend.

Lol oldschool subreddit has the best rs memes
---
who is we? and did you want polls hidden before being told that you do? hmmmmm
---
Isnt this what armadyl is for???
---
Cabbage cape obviously 
---
Is kingdom of misc still worth doing daily? Most days I don‚Äôt profit or break even unless I get good seeds from nests
---
I'll second that lol got a 300k seed pack from a 20 minute contract before
---
I need some more info about this matter. But lets say that you got the drops b2b and each one has a chance of landing on rare drop table. With some numbers here and there which i currently don‚Äôt have. I can only assume that it would be around 50/50.
---
eh When I played it was only worth using death if you had like full T90+ equipped
---
He hit 10K sub points. He's not anywhere near 10K subs on Twitch. He usually stays around 5K or so subs?
---
What are you reading? Did I say that because I clearly didn't. I said that I essentially didn't have any use for the game and I didn't understand how the game worked or just anything worked back then(to some degree).
---
Plus even if we go down that route of argument you still have 20+ year olds gambling and doing shady shit without having the actual repercussions handed to them yet.
---
Fuck that man. It took me 18k to get to dragon defender 
---
They make money to do these things, yknow.
---
Awesome
---
one for left hand one for right hand and one for the mouth.
---
Doesnt even have to be cold out and my rock lobster looks like that :( 
---
I actually thought the kq one looked the best 
---
I didn't say it was a mistake.
---
Oh damn I didn't even notice those. 
---
Verf and Settled are also two of the only guys to put in the 90 hrs/week needed to scrape 20 minutes of interesting content.  These UIM snowflake series popping up everywhere will very quickly run out of content. 
---
The drops were B2B, the drop log on the right side is in order from latest to oldest.

---
I always thought the idea was that they would put up items with a high GE value but actually trade for much less. I never engaged with them. Except for the one time I put up 60gp in the trade and hoped it was a bot that would accept it.
---
Defender was the last drop I got real lucky on. Unless you count 2 light frame drops in my first 70kc at gorillas...but that was more a slap in the goddamn face
---
I feel like security has gotten to the point where if I ever get rich I'll be sure to make an alt account to just hold onto my money that I only log into via mobile.
---
People are nervous due to a surge in accounts being compromised.

But what about me, a retarded person. I pay for membership and play for three days a month. I make progress slowly... I don't have time to keep up with BiS spec options. I say to myself, "if it's what's the community wants, sure" but how am I to know what the community wants without the poll booth? Am I to try to read the minds of this cesspool, Reddit? I think not, keep the polls open, so that I may see what the community truly wants. Thank you.
---
Oh thats pretty sweet! So if I brought a ring of dueling to use to to reset health and prayer would it overwrite the boosts to my stats? 
---
Disable trading in the market place, solely designed for trading. Absolutely genious. 
---
Their stance for years has basically been "don't get lured or you're dumb"
---
Can‚Äôt have shrinkage if you don‚Äôt have droppage 
---
I think it‚Äôs usually used in a negative way, but I definitely think as paying members of this game we are entitled to give feedback and have it be heard and considered by the devs, but Ash is kinda right as well.
---
Being grateful kinda is the opposite of being entitled, at least as far as when people use entitled in a negative context.
---
I mean him promoting gambling to his audience members who are 21+ is not a problem at all..
---
Ah. That's true. I didnt make this app of course - just have seen it recommended on the play store for a while and never actually checked it out. Has great reviews though and is safe from all ive seen! Just wanted to share a cool helpful app i found!

---
A friend‚Äôs was a bit unique because he abused his viewership to promote gambling. There has never been another content creator with as large of a following who has done such a thing. So I feel his ban was to set a precedent more so than anything else. to discourage others with such a massive following to do similar things.
---
That is true
---
A rock lobster
---
That's fair
---
Its happened üò¢
---
It would make a huge difference. For two reasons;
---
1. The bandwagon bias. You see everyone voting *yes* for every question, so it makes you more likely to vote *yes* on questions as well. 
---
2. The simple *‚ÄùMy vote won‚Äôt matter‚Äù* effect. If you hop into the poll booth a couple days after, and see that *yes* is passing on a question but you would have voted *no*, you are more likely to not even bother wasting your time to vote. 
---
#2 is the primary reason. There could be thousands of people thinking their indifferent vote won‚Äôt matter, and they don‚Äôt vote because of it since their opposition is winning the question. When in reality, not being able to see results clears out the biases involved in voting. 
---
Ok nobody ever do this i got 4 guams! And my friend got 30 rune ess 
---
I bet he failed

Jibcomplex
---
This is on a bond alt I made just for fun. Don't feel like doing Jad with 60 range. :)
---
There's quite literally thousands of hours of content already in the game. Nobody would care if they spent a week on working on what we already have. Cosmetics linked to bossing will never be irrelevant. Think boss pets. 
---
Your complaint is invalid and senile, with no realistic logic behind it.
---

Makes sense now. Thanks. I keep on forgetting that OSRS needs to accommodate the mobile users now.
---
Fire cape. Most people get triggered by the Obby cape, but this account is only like a week old. Don't feel like going for it yet.
---
does his gf really lol
---
Dovydas's ban is strange, period.
---
What they did to him will never sit right with me
---
Lol I had someone doing this to me earlier, I felt bad and ended up just leaving the drops minus chaos/death runes for him, made the dudes night 
---

PLEASE

That's ridiculous. 1/50 sure doesn't seem like a lot, but it almost seems worse than other grinds with higher rates.
---
Fucking nut good job dude
---
I would recommend to do kandaria hard diary if youre doing seers village course, you can teleport infront of the bank and it speed up laps pretty nicely,  i can get roughly ~100 laps per hour, i just got 85 agility and 630 laps till next level
---
New hydra helm should have multiple heads change my mind
---
Serious question why? Its not even the most xp teleport?
---
Shame if the iron man gets permed :(
---
Osrs has a much bigger playerbase than 125k, we get more concurrent than that
---
Thats what snare/entanglement is for
---
Shit nice now you just need 1k points lol 
---
OSRS has had 550,000 active accounts as of RuneFest 2018. With mobile, that number is much higher.
---
It is definitely more than your 125k estimate. That‚Äôs how many different players are on at one peak point in the day, but not every person who plays OSRS is on at the same time.

Jesus Christ, you‚Äôre fucking retarded. We don‚Äôt prey on clue scroll people but if we see someone in the wilderness we have the option to choose if we want to attack them or not. We don‚Äôt know what they have on them. Many people bring all kinds of shit into the wilderness not expecting to get PKed.
---
Side note: Dragon Defender was like 3 kills in at the basement. The "I can't reach that!" was from me trying to click the basement ladder with the door closed.
---
Regardless on the seed, it gives the same "pool" of stuff. Only the contract level matters.
---
vaccines causes virtual autism
---
Imagine a pvmer with 4k+ targ kills, "oh you like to pk man?" "What nah duck that I was just pet hunting".. It'd be very strange
---
haha xd
---
no
---
there is thing called feeling good ,you should try it out :)
---
Typical. Nothing about this video seems sincere. The classic 'only sorry because you got caught'. Just an attempt to appease and keep his fanbase. It's seemed to work, you gullible fools.
---
I fucking pat Mod Mat dog.
---
Not sure why you are being flamed. It's actually a good point. A lot of large content creators have been offered donations almost daily. Shroud and critical received TONS of donation (monkey nuts btw). Alkan received some hween mask donations. It's not that outlandish to wonder if kemp has taken some

Tbh, on the very rare occasion that someone can't get their items after an hour, just let them disappear like it is now. Item sinks are great
---
I take it you forgot to show one of your defenders?
---
You literally download an app on your phone and then enter a code. Maybe ask if your handler can help you out?
---
Yeah he used to be addicted to xanax but now he's addicted to adderall
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand
---
nah u do this to trap the torcher/defilers behind the door with it open they will move in direct line with the gates instead off to the side
---
no you don't understand, the bosses would have to be made much more difficult and slower to kill
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Never spent so much time on a post, haha. 
---
Okay your argument because he stealing somthing of no value it‚Äôs okay? It‚Äôs okay to make a profit on somthing a company makes? The games code/ the game as a whole is a product we have no right too, if we sell anything for a profit from this game  it‚Äôs stealing. Trading in game gp is a intended  feature due to the nature of mmopgs it‚Äôs what they want, we are benefiting from time spent in a game we like.  And he made a profit off of it, therefore it‚Äôs stealing.   
---
Iirc he said he was gonna take a break from rs to try other games 
---
Thanks! Looks like a neat series.
---
Can't we just just remove OP from this subreddit? No one likes him anyways.
---
! Remind me
---
! Messageme
---
same. they should replace perm mutes with 1 year mutes imo
---
i don‚Äôt care 
---
but do you want all ur irl friends to know you still play rs in your 20s?
---
I'm thinking it's for drugs with Alfie. I'm pretty sold on this idea
---
As a man named Ash, this brings me great enjoyment. 
---
a cock lobster
---
This would make me want to actually spend the points on colored Slayer helms
---
Nice job! It looks great! 
---
Same
---
This is literally on the wikipedia. A google search takes less time than posting on reddit.
---
It might not hurt to change recovery questions as well if possible, but if you changed your email, pass, and added an Authenticator you should be good. I would suggest looking into your computer to make sure it wasn‚Äôt for infected with anything. Even with changes, a key logger would still do some damage.
---
Damn üò§
---
Someone shat in your Cheerios huh?
---
Even better! This thread full support has now been shitted(shifted) towards this goal 
---
Ah yes. I wasn‚Äôt aware that the internet had that type of information. It‚Äôs almost like I wanted to maybe have a conversation with some people and get some specific viewpoints and preferences on the subject. Excuse me while I retreat to the wiki. 
---
No it's literally just an instance. If you drop an item there and then port out and back in it's gone. Other people can enter other instances too, think Corporeal Beast and Raids.
---
Yes it would require a bit of \*ahem\* engine work probably, but neither of us know how big of a change it would be. This is just a suggestion, if it would take up too much time to change then let Jagex make that decision since they're the ones that are actually aware of how long it'd take.
---
It‚Äôs a good idea yes and the easiest to get is the clue hunter set. YouTube has guides to getting it. 
---
Make them even more heinously ugly?  Questionable strategy

if you plan to do solo raids absolutely. for everything else its not a huge upgrade.

Well he would PK people with his iron then loot stuff on his main. I mean I wonder how much he made pking on Solus Adamas
---
Just recently started playing again. Didnt they replace them with yews?
---
Oh those disgusting gold selling websites. There's so many of them though. Which one? Which one does she own?

We know that's just an Abby demon helm LOL 
---
I got inv like this all the time. Diary gives you higher chance for better ores if I'm not mistaken.
---
Make sure that warding skill be fun to grind. Thats all i want i vote yes we need new updates to this game its not 2006 anymore
---
Hey I would love to get in on this,  i miss the days of old where everyone role-played. My name is Sri Radha
---
Please add me!
---
Rethink that
---
You're lucky that he could only change it through the website once, if you didn't have an authenticator he could of changed it twice through ingame and take the name on another account. His only shot I guess was changing it once by buying membership and then waiting a few weeks to get another name change through the site hoping you were inactive and wouldn't notice the first name change.
---
Ooof that runecrafting must have hurt 
---
? This is like 100k worth of shit. 
---
Selling gold doesn't happen in a vacuum. He's facilitating cheaters by letting people buy gold that they didn't earn.
---
IMO buying bonds for in-game gp is also cheating, but at least that supports the game.
---
Nick has alot to learn
---
your friend is on suicide watch, make sure hes okay. 
---
If you‚Äôre serious about playing, get membership ASAP. You won‚Äôt make any huge progress in f2p that you can‚Äôt get with 1/10th the time in p2p. You can spend a couple hours leveling up your attack and strength to 30 or do a twenty minute quest for the same result. The only reason to play f2p is if you‚Äôre unsure about the game and you want to try a demo, or if you simply enjoy f2p.
---
Basically, don‚Äôt play f2p if you‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúget ready‚Äù for members
---
Why would they make an exception? They don't do this for other people caught RWTing.
---
All tradeables. You make a request like "I'm out here killing this boss and I need more food" and they come to you. It's free, but good practice dictates that you pay the person for their time and the item cost
---
Big talk ghostoo6. Quite the man you are, we are all quivering in fear because how insightful and powerful thy comment was.
---
Nice clear photo of the screenshot button
---
I feel you
---
haahaha damn you got super lucky! I remember it took me an hour and a half for the first defender and i thought i was doing it wrong lol. The rest went by fast and I got my dragon defender in the first 30 kills. I still have the 300 tokens left over in my bank ;)
---
I got my first mute here. Good times.
---
Rapists in America get more jail time than in progressive, feminist countries like Sweden, Norway, etc. Because those countries believe in rehabilitation instead of just punishment. 
---
To be fair, they protect white rapists too, but only the rich ones. 
---
Reeee
---
I spam close the door. Because people leave it open. Then I had someone get mad that I kept closing it so he stood there and would just open it as I closed it. 
---
Or e had thousands of dollars of a virtual currency that he doesn‚Äôt need, and figured he would rather have real money.
---
I would probably sell too, just all of it at once.
---
&gt; His ban was completely normal and justified lol... Promoting RWT/gambling to such a large audience is far worse than solo RWTing in silence like Kemp.
---
Imagine boaty is banned for promoting watches
---
That's what happened to a friend lol
---
vork and kbd helm &gt;&gt;&gt; sire helm don‚Äôt @ me

He thinks reddit users need red MSpaint arrows to show that their are 3 dmed players ate ge?  
---
We should hang this cult in public, the one that hated on the dmed users
---
God yes
---
Reminds me of the fat ugly girl in HS that wants you but you only talk to her because you want to eat out her BFF

You will do so little damage it's barely worth it. Just max melee

Will there be a continuation of the penguin story line in the future? I'd love for that quest line to be finished and the iceberg get some much needed love
---
Better than g.e. beggars imo. Highlight drops you want at nechs. 
---
Don't do this 
---
Pretty sure I raided with you post-CoX release.  
---
Think for yourself. Do all hard diaries if you haven't then work on all Elite diaries. Then do the lame skills first. Mining RC Hunter Smith etc.  I hate these types of posts because it's so damn obvious. Look at what you haven't accomplished yet and go for it. 
---
Correct, but he said to get to Drag. I could be reading it wrong, though. 
---
/u/prezleek
---
Yeah, I was assuming he meant 18k total and not just dragon defender. 
---
I find it funny that irl a lot of us probably don't give a shit about fashion, but in game we all know best fashionscape
---
Significant downgrade? 
---
There isn‚Äôt any expensive significant upgrades.

Blowpipe, whip, fury, b ring is legit all you need

reported to mod mat k
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs talking about back then. You can have magic trees to yourself anywhere now
---
No. Most crime stopping is a bandaid. Legally speaking though jagex has to defend that their gp has no real world value. Idk how bonds ignore the loophole but other games use bonds as well and are fine. So clearly bonds don't equal real GP value by the eyes of the law. But yeah game companies get into trouble if they can be found in a court of law to have their own currency that has real world value.
---
Congrats bro! 
---
I mean, the difference is all of 50k per hour or something, so its not a huge deal, and I'd say the exp is worth it for most. Deaths tanked with the kebos release. Maybe because people are doing konar tasks more, thus getting less burstable tasks? I dont think anything from kebos is dumping deaths into the game off the top anyway

Yikes 
---
I am entitled because I coincidently was not born in a shit hole? Or because I am white? How is that not negative?
---
Ah, I do remember back then magic trees being an excellent money making method too. I miss those days :(
---
Sigh lol. Just saying its a cool app people. Worth using if youre mobile. 
---
(This guys trolling..btw)
---
&gt; Wait wtf its free?
---
The delivery is free, the items are not.
---
Try appealing, if they reject it there isn‚Äôt much you can do but hope a mod sees this 
---
i used to not accept noted items because i thought they were pictures
---
The word cult can be traced to 17th century France. It often describes an ancient or primitive form of worship. Do you think a batch of gold farmers resemble a cult? Perhaps?!
---
Yeah luckily I got to double astrals when they were still worth lots and right before the giant astral price jump from the POH update.. made big bank
---
its nice to have a left click non moving bank.
---
They didn't specify January, but the beginning of 2019.
---
You are a kind guy :)
---
I appealed about an hour after getting muted. It got denied, sadly.
---
I probably said something stupid, I can't remember. 
---
Chuck some Negative prayer bonus on it as well then maybe? 
---
Fuck me this looks cool sure, but I‚Äôd at least max construction and crafting first. Crafting Cape makes PVM and skilling more efficient.
---
Fucking lmao at making flasks jam jars, they should totally make flasks a item in game troll you by making it's purpose completely different.

Lil trap 
---
Check again, mine seems to be stable around 60ms now.
---
Selling teeth.
---
Nicely done! Mobile too? Your gear is OP at though so mobile prob wasnt to awful with it! Though I imagine kiting and body blocking would be a bit of a pain on mobile. 
---
I'll be down for giving a go I've never done a raids before so all new to me, currently can't get in discord chat but willing to do in game chat ? I've got the levels just not the experience lol - GMT time

FROM F2P TO MEMBERS BOND GANG
---
FUCK this, ima stick to Lavas.
---
Like the other guy said, it's just an invisible +7 boost to your level. The mining and fishing guilds also offer an invis +7 boost to their respective skill.
---
Appeal again now, you never know. Just so you know I have a banned acc with 75m sitting on it for macro use (autotyper) and a muted acc and neither have been given second chances
---
They are still decent AFK money
---
Cook, firemake, and woodcut should be fairly easy stats. Then maybe do some power mining or Hunter?
---
Good marketing for reddit karma my friend
---
Ah okay I misread his comment. I was like ‚Äúwhy on earth would people not use this all the time!?‚Äù 
---
RuneScape was released January 4th 2001, that's over 18 years. 
---
And yeah he is probably trolling.
---
Sure, now shut the fuck up and move on child.
---
Cunt boy
---
I dont remember seeing skinny asian trannies around there... huh
---
Gloves are cheap because you have to do ds2 to get them
---
If you could just upgrade barrows gloves they'd double in price
---
The demand for them would double.
---
Why are you so upset that you‚Äôre bad at the game?
---
Weaponry isnt armor.
---
Can it be done without dwh?
---
Why are you such a cunt?
---
well done puss.
---
When I pop a adderall for the sick fire making xp.
---
If it needs you to log in I obviously wouldn‚Äôt trust it but if not then I don‚Äôt see why not 
---
Stayed up till 5:30am for this. last kill of the night. Worth. 
---
Imagine getting so upset about crashing cry baby
---
Agility was the one that hurt 
---
Just melee them while they're running 4head
---
If you are good at it, yes, it is one of the best training methods until 71+ (where pyramid plunder becomes better).
---
Imagine responding to my bait
---
Dumb cunt
---
Oh it‚Äôs bait now that you‚Äôre crying, you‚Äôre dumb as fuck kiddo
---
I've not actually downloaded yet, I saw it on app store seems sort of like a Runelite for mobile just wanted to see if anyone else uses it to see if safe
---
You can wear armor but you have to kill it wielding the magic secateurs. 
---
Born in 04 from your Reddit tag...
---
means you got Rank 1 / level 30 slayer when you were 1 years old.
---
NICE.
---
#Jagex OSRS, Youtuber Gets Banned, HCIM Completes Account, New Jagex Update
---
I've used it since release, bang on imo
---
Worth paying for the extras also, it works as a drop down like Facebook messenger does so doesn't stop you playing whilst checking high scores, using calcs, notepad is abit dodgy on it but could be due to my phone, has grand exchange prices on their, treasure trails fairy rings links to the wiki the lot
---
Here's my argument against it... These people are going to exist no matter what. Please keep them all in one place at the GE rather than at my nice clean varrock west bank or anywhere else. 
---
How cute, cunt boy can‚Äôt think of a better insult than calling someone dumb 
---
I was f2p when slayer was added. Never even thought of the overcrowding like this happening lol. Another thing to also think about was hopping to find an open world took like 30 seconds every single time hog hopped!
---
Wow they grow up so fast , cant belive hes already six hundred and twelve.
---
imagine thinking him making irl bank by rwting is him being braindead. rwting isn't as bad as you idiots make it seem and him getting banned will only affect him by very little
---
I had the same thing, said "FFS" and he just picked up his cannon and hopped worlds. Some people are good...
---
Yeah I was looking at it looks handy to have but wasn't sure if safe or not since seeing alot of posts about people being hacked so like to play it safe
---
Respect brother 
---
What did you smoke?
---
There is, it's a KC. Do the KC function for "barrows" in runelite. It tells you how many chests you've looted after every run, but you may need to enable it in options. 
---
Pretty sure it's !kc barrows 
---
Someone correct me if wrong 
---
Let us eat it.
---
Nice meme. Wiki quick guides are much better.
---
It works, but for other players is there a database?
---
why do people think rwting is a terrible, huge sin? what the heck
---
is avas assembler better than avas accumulator if you pick up darts on the ground with acumulator
---
+1
---
Not sure, try googling ü§∑ 
---
I rate this
---
Thanks mate!
---
&gt;Bionicles
---
Yessssss
---
Oh yes pls
---
Yeah you would just need more arc light specs. You could do 43 arc light specs first and then do 160 bgs to put him at all zeros but you could also just smack 310 bgs into and tank the hits which would require much more food. Just with a bgs you would need to hit 1300 total. I would suggest doing the 43 arc lights first if you can‚Äôt get a dwh.
---
MLM at 36 mining recommended? If not, where?
---
Yes if its a VPN that has just been used by a botfarm youre screwed
---
Now that's something I haven't thought of in a long while
---
doesn't he loot his ironman pks for gp tho
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happened I jumped to the next world boom by myself 
---
Love the kalphite pinsirs
---
11 $
---
You failed the 99 one at a time
---
You can easily do vorkath at your levels, no need to train up till 90 tbh, i even do it with blessed dhide since i dont have elite void and 90+ range and i do fine
---
Yes you can. 43 arc light specs to 160 bgs would zero him out. You could also rank him and just do 310 bgs spec but you would need lots of food for duo. Lastly I wouldn‚Äôt suggest this but you can also just do 1300 bgs total and zero him out.
---
Yeah gamebreaking OP for the entire 200 people that achieved all clue rewards
---
That‚Äôs what he gets for doing a shitty method of magic training
---

---
Omg you‚Äôve just brought on the biggest nostalgia. I used to sit there for hours building them all, making up stories for each bionicle, I‚Äôm sure there ended up being a bionicials game for the Xbox 360, was sick.
---
I love that this is a feature, people dont know that you can splash on literally anything else and it wont be an issue yet they choose rats and complain when this happens
---
You got 12.6m exp by yourself and need help with last 400k? Jfc
---
lol, u realize astrals also crashed by approx the same percent., and the type of person who knows/can burst tasks wouldn't touch konar with a 6ft pole.
---
They already did say that having two versions of each slayer helm recolor is something they would not do, and changing the look of items people are already used to does not usually go over well. 
---
What did you kill jad with?
---
Thank you for pointing this out. I was not born in 04, i am sure.
---
hey guys look i have a max cape cx
---
Honestly who wouldn't have?
---
Gold is like 50 cents a mill or something ridiculous right now.
---
If I mills and mills just laying around I'd sell it too I used to sell bills on rs3 
---
well it's a lot easier to have 90+ range or Mage and be low combat level than to have the same in Atk and Str.
---
Fire Wave isn't even that much weaker, with a max hit of 46
---
Everyone crowded around the Red Birds south of Castle Wars. The trick was to dash to the desert hunting grounds immediately! 
---
I think Larupians caught a bunch of people off guard, bad exp but was thought to be a ‚Äòmilestone‚Äô in the skill at the time.
---
It would be like 1/2 the price though like 0.5 of the original cost!
---
To be fair, he's now permanently #1 on the hiscores.
---
when you say on holidays do you mean in another country? did you just log in on a new setup in a different country and it got locked?
---
dibs on his shirt
---
The dream was short lived. Here i sit at 75 Slayer on my current account. The account that got migrated to RS3 only had 77.
---
Took the fairy ring from my house to the island and he joined me
---
Makes sense
---
Im the kind of guy that would turn my gpu to 1000 and camp ur drop after you say that 
---
This is amazing. After the unique design of the Hydra helm, we've got to have unique designs for all of the Slayer helms now 
---
Yea, this is totally fake. /u/Zexillium you're a fraud.
---

Love that idea 
---
I‚Äôll give ya tree-fiddy
---
imagine craving karma so much that you fake a screenshot omegalul
---
Good to know, grinding for a blowpipe right now. I'm a nooby boi 
---
I swear that aint real
---
Tell that to the people who got hacked for thousands of hours worth of progress aka thousands of hours of their life because some gold selling scumbag wanted their gp.
---
Kempq, although only a drop in the bucket, still contributed to keeping RWTing and that kind of practice alive.
---
im up to rune gloves getting there myself, congrats man!
---
You know they'd end up goofy-looking
---
nah there is no tracking of some1 elses barrows count only thing u can look up is peoples own posts on this mainly
---
At the time I had 73 slayer and was combat 80. Is that too low?  It never mentions anywhere a level req. it does say the slayer monster level affects it however. I had gotten worms, bronze dragons twice and mutated bloodvelds in CK, and I can‚Äôt remember now. Anyways it was just bad rng, many rolls on that table now 
---
Then there will be level 10 looters my dude
---
Lol‚Äôd at the name
---
lol gf account
---
u can personally use the loot tracker on runelite and save it on the go
---
Easier to kill
---
Don't worry, you'll get past it
---
Ah might not get it then tbh
---
&gt;200 bronze dragons
---
lmao 
---
But if I wait til it crashes I could save 40m lol
---
Are hydras task only? As in, do I need to get 95 slayer to get assigned them to complete the elite diary task, or can I boost from 90 and kill one off task?
---
If you use runelite, it adds basically all teleport locations on the map so that helps a ton for getting around to new places. I feel like not much has changed until you get a bit higher. Some things right off the bat, like wintertodt, some zeah skilling methods, new slayer caves/areas/monsters, wild prayer alter, regeneration pools. Gl hf
---
I mean I'm pretty sure he isn't really sorry for RWTing. He's only sorry for getting caught.
---
Varrok teleport when its set to Grand Exhamge, and use the north west agility hole
---
Think of the children!
---
What the fuck is wrong with you. No one cared about your video the first 5 million times you posted it. No one cares now. Stop.
---
Oh dear. 
---
Not sure about sparc.
---
Faux tends to make comments on new features without stopping to think about it, which often leads to his fans going on reddit and twitter and complaining at jagex mods to immediately change it.
---
stupid as it sounds yes. mainly play on mobile and i fish and mine. i assumed loads were just bots
---
It is not just that, but also the vertices will weld together if they are too close, so making small details is not really possible. Like that skotizo helm would not be possible because of that i'm pretty sure.
---
and wintertodt, very easy to tell when you're the one taking damage
---
I seriously hope english isn't your first language.
---
He‚Äôs the original owner of the account and he‚Äôs been providing all the info they‚Äôre asking of him.What other info can he provide that‚Äôll help him best?
---
Polls shouldnt be designed to pass though, they should be designed to gauge what the community wants and get our input on it.
---
How can you base "best" or  "number one" off of playerbase sub ratios. What if I create a game with a player base of 10 and they are all subbed to me. Am I now the best streamer?
---
WHY HIDE POLL RESULTS? what did they do agains????
---
you grabbed that from r/Kanye right?
---
Either give us this or hide poll results, the ball is in your court /u/mod_stevew 
---
Requires too much engine work. Players would sit on other players causes glitches such as pk them w/o getting skulled, create max cash stacks, and cause 37 tiles scattered across the game to be unable to be walked on.
---
I thing the Edgeville one is a tad bit faster.
---
It actually seems like a nice mobile activity now that you can one click withdraw all your ores and no longer have to go through a menu to dump them into the furnace
---
Oh yeah right
---
i would also love to be able to re-arrange the order of the tabs on each side, being right handed i would much rather have every combat based thing on the right for easy tab changing, qol tho
---
Lol you fortnite nerds. 
---
You probably wont though.
---
It's just bad design if you hide teleports unnecessarily behind some menu. I now have to aim 2 clicks : pressing teleport menu, and then pressing the key necessary for the right teleport, while the mounted glory solution only needs 1. 
---
Also cocaine penis
---
I like the woox one where it says last stream but has been up for like a week now 
---
Yeah but he contributed to keeping RWTing alive, a practice that hurts something we all enjoy. I think that's more than enough reason to be genuinely mad at the guy for.
---
Oh for sure brother, wasn't trying to imply anything, lol. 
---
What were your stats and what was your setup? Planning on doing mm2 soon so i can unblock black demons
---
Warding passed?
---
lvl 10 looters take more time for botters to replace and require more interaction with the botting client before they can loot which should make it easier for jagex to detect patterns and prevent looting bots
---
Oof
---
Bring back Classic
---
i could see them dropping the spikes in the center to get the poly count down and still being awesome appearance wise
---
SUCCED
---
not polled yet. tbh I would be surprised if it passes but jagex chose the 'right' time to poll it with all the new players.
---
You're happy people can make a living by hurting the game you're playing? How are there so many people in this thread cheering for the guy? What the fuck has happened to the community where RWTing has become an acceptable practice. Fuck off lol
---
Believe they said in a Q and A that they'll never add gorillas cuz there's only one place to do em. And konar is good for other reasons. So one of the best monsters to kill shouldn't be offered there. 
---
Dovy realistically got banned because he made a video that was telling people to stop staking on RS and to go to the gambling website. Which ultimately would make jagex lose revenue because people leave the game. He abused his power to advertise for jagex. But it's much easier to ban him for RWT when there is video eveidence of it than explain marketing to Reddit.  
---
Sorry, \*closest without teles would be Tithe.
---
That's so crazy. Did bronze dragons release way before steels? I felt like I remembered the release of steel dragons in the laramja dungeon but I dont remember the release of slayer. I cant remember exactly when I started playing either.
---
Jagex has admitted they can‚Äôt stop a lot of them before they make enough gp for a bond. Level 10 would take the botters no time at all to adjust too and do essentially nothing for bot detection.
---
You should be at least praying piety on every task. Prayer pots aren‚Äôt that expensive and you‚Äôll easily make up the costs of them on most tasks. 
---
Jagex wants everyone to hate on RWTing because it quite literally hurts the game and its players you brainlet lol
---
Says the person who came back two weeks later 
---
It's like early 2013 all over again, but a decade beforehand. The appreciation for some achievements never change, especially when nostalgia is involved
---
A perfect 5/7
---
mate i watched his stream for 20 mins and am now addicted to adderall and xanax
---
Nah this is stupid. Pkers want more power. You shouldnt need expensive gear to go in the wild just so you dont get frozen every single time. And clans would just be op.
---
Should just ban ye outright mate and not let you stream anymore to tbh.
---
Did you forget you switched accounts?
---
Lmao you woulda only spent half if you bought gp not bonds retard
---
It's the last message you see*  
---
I've had plenty of people start abusing the person kicking them.
---
Hey guys I found an account I should recover cuz they were in a luring video from 2015 I saw the other day. Need help.
---
I mean cmon 
---
I think they should ban him from streaming/playing the game for any monetary gain whatsoever. If you break the rules you deserve consequences. 
---
This man right here officer.
---
you just have to be rich and you can basically wear whatever you want
---
Imagine having touched a girl.
---
It took me 2k to go from bronze to rune, and 2k to go from rune to dragon.
---
4k total, I was upset
---
God this happened to me tonight. Dude sat there for 20 minutes blocking my barrage spot then said "give me free stuff brother" in Spanish. Sorry, no.
---
It's the name sake of the fucking channel 
---
I mean, I'm disappointed that people such as yourself exist, but I'm more upset that I'm still 1.5m xp away from 84 con. 
---
Yet they've added gargoyles, rune dragons addy dragons, kraken, smoke devils... all of which are only in one spot
---
But those Snowflake Youtubers on Minecraft thinking they'll take on the workd by doing those Single player (adventure) series from scratch are worst and sadly in higher quantity, pest control that instead.
---
That's unbelievably awesome. 
---
gay
---
There*
---
So what you're saying is you're scum. Got it.
---
Not if they add a new skill
---
People selling gold makes it possible. 
---
It‚Äôs like saying coke dealers are not to blame, but the addicted fucks should be put in jail for using it.
---
To add to that, he once paid ¬£10k of prize money out of his own pockets to a player, because he felt guilty for being responsible of an oversight which caused a situation where practically two players won a tournament.
---
760ish kills, addy darts, most kills are 2:00 or slightly under.
---
1:42 PB and I think that was with rune darts and two BGS specs (was just seeing if it was viable the first week).
---
Fook that dog 
---
Bitch please, there are some 100 cb punks out there who only survive in the p2p relying off mom's credit card with their banso, obby cape and combat bracelet because they can't be arsed to do that quest. Gj
---
Sorry doesnt heal wounds, sorry always come to late. I hope u live in shame for what you have done
---
So the petty guy who is just looking for an excuse to be an asshole?
---
100% agree, but I've seen this sub complaining in the past about certain questions and suggestions not passing. So implementing hidden poll results will likely result in this sub fighting against their own interests lol
---
Oh you bgs spec? That's smart.
---
that's sad if true. 
---
but it's also partly jagex their fault.
---
I can register 10 accounts daily if I wanted without any temporary block.
---
Im begging for forgiveness
---
God fucking damnit dude. This is exactly why this feels like such a betrayal. Loved your content man and thought it was criminal you weren't recognized as best new content creator, looked fo ward to your videos most from the community. Now finding out you just casually contribute to what's killing the game we all love so much. Yeah, it's a bummer. Can't really keep supporting someone false like this, which sucks because you really stood out.
---
I don't really wanna be that guy but just in case you didn't knows its 'supposed'.

---
Sorry. Said fan fiction, meant to say bad writers
---
Why *shouldn't* RWTing be bannable? 
---
* People have their gp stolen by gold selling hackers because of the demand there is for gp - hundreds of hours of progress gone for that player because of the RWT market
---
* People bot and gold farm to collect items and resources for gp to sell on the gold market - hurts the value of said items and hurts the opportunities players have to make money.
---
* Why play OSRS, a game that revolves largely around making money, the proper way if you can just buy cheap gold legally anyways? - Devalues the achievements of standard players if it's legal to buy cheap gold.
---
Okay thank you!
---
Look at it this way:
---
1. Information that requires further compromisation, such as proof of earliest transactions.
---
2. Location of request.
---
3. Passwords / original ISP / billing address
---
4. Everything else.
---
So everytime the hacker and you provide the same information, go down one notch on the list. If they had all of the transaction information but they didn't send the request from the location of the accounts creation, and you did, you'll get account back. Let's say you moved and hacker is still on even ground with you, we go down to passwords / original ISP / billing address. If he has all of that to...link a scan of ur birth certificate in the request LMAO?
---
Yeah I disagreed with his opinion on the drop tables but it doesn't mean he's not allowed to have an opinion just because some of his viewers start reeing. Jagex shouldn't react as fast is all. Faux is a good guy.
---
Another day, another suggestion for Slayer helms

Mod ash: Of course. Might even exist already on some creature I don't know about. Enjoy checking.
---
Not HCIM, just an idiot with an Obby Mauler.
---
Jase said he will get 200m all by summer so unless warding gets released before then which is doubtful I think he's a good candidate
---
71 to 72 is 84k experience. 7 hours for that is 12k xp an hour. Rc is slow but it's not that slow. There's 0 chance it took that long, or he wasn't playing all the time.
---
Give him my rsn. I'm a 6ft, 13 stone hairy middle aged man but a thousand bucks is a thousand bucks.

True nobody cares if they waste dev time on shit nobody wants. How could I be so senile

I like my green helm the way it is thanks! I feel like I‚Äôd spend a lot more time dying due to struggling to stuff food and brews down my throat with those horrible claws in front of my mouth

I mean, doing anything in oldschool is just easier. It's over 10 years since people had max stats and shit.

You're basically saying that the poll results influence your voting, which is why the poll results need to be hidden... 
---
Only on tuesdays...
---
So what you're saying, is that you don't.

Yes it was a D&amp;D. Was trying to make a joke. Never played the content though.

---
Yeah man thats what I mean like... You cant just design the same helmet with less polys and have the same detail
---
Kind of. I don't think that the mindset of voters is to automatically vote whatever other people have voted for, but to think why it's been voted like it is. 
---
Have fun don't care 
---
I wouldn't bother flinching at all just make sure you don't tank more minions than you have to, I think with your stats you should be able to kill her 1-3 runs. Actually, use leaf bladed battleaxe instead of whip, it's one of the best crushing weapons in the game and it's pretty cheap as well. Fun fact: you can do both phases with blowpipe and depending on your stats and gear it might be even better dps than melee.
---
Castle wars is definitely easiest bank tp you can use, and for getting back you can use slayer ring (if unlocked) to relekka dungeon or necklace of passage to wizards tower (both places have fairy rings). The best option would be quest cape but I assume you don't have that. Glory to Edgeville is fine too, it doesn't really matter since you only need to do it couple times.
---
I'm going to do a few trips with adamant and see how different my times are.
---
Your phone doesn't support multiple touches at the same time? You must be apple peasant
---
Brainlet.
---
The Alchemical Hydra is 95 slayer, which cannot be boosted because it's a task-only boss.
---
With the regular ones, I'm pretty sure you can boost it.
---
For real, just go find a chicken. Bonus points if you go hide your shame by splash on the zombie chickens near the Ectofuntus. Sure some farmers might see you, but who cares fuck those hippies.
---
That's what the post is about. Have you even checked the screenshot?
---
Normal hydra's are **not** task only, so you can boost from 90 slayer. 
---

2 attack levels don't matter unless you lack a backbone.

You didn't cover the head of the level 2 man staring directly at you through the wall. Thanks for the account kid.
---
I like the ones who ask. I've had some that have said "leave something for me damn" and they can fuck right off. But a lot ask if it's okay if they loot and in that case I tend to leave a lot more drops on the floor. 
---
Theiving host cc definitely will

Black dragonhide has been in the game for over 15 years... Fuck pkers complaining about literally nothing.

Nobody cares about your inability to victimize other players who are probably just doing wilderness slayer anyway.

Nice.

HCtaylor followed that link and got hacked, dont be like HCtaylor

Did you use the link I posted on your older post? What became of the appeal through that link? if you were able to do it, that is..
---
Nice unimbued ring.
---
You might as well. It's not difficult to get paydirt with that lvl mining, and by the time you get 70 mining you should have enough nuggets to get upper.
---
Kind of like rooftops for agility 
---
[Maybe for you but definitely not for everyone](https://i.imgur.com/wjai4Ts.png), always 30ms pre the server maintenence, hasn't dropped below 230 since
---
Knives are shit  use darts, way cheaper and same or better dps
---
No they were garbage money, 100k-150k/hr didn't cut it for good money. People did it because no one was really thinking about efficiency back then besides a few top players.
---
&gt; strongest boss was KQ with bad drops.
---
So you're just going to completely ignore the 1/128 of getting a 50m drop? If you're talking about 2004, thats how much D-chain was worth back then.
---
Also rune ore was good money back then and relatively still is, it's just no one leveled mining since it wasn't afk like fishing/WC.
---
Don't we all have this exact posture anyway?

We all know the little thing where you buy limit then sell it to yourself lol

Varrock or Ardougne I think
---
Well no shit. Pking is purely optional content. The fact that the developers keep trying to force updates to make pking a thing again only shows their bias. I have played since 2004 and never found pking fun or interesting. The only reason I ever go into wilderness anymore is to kill revs occasionally (only because they're stupidly good money), or to kill 3 bosses for wilderness slayer tasks.
---
rate is like 1/65 that's why skoto isn't even near impressive not even 2 rolls in 10kc
---
just stop afking and pick up the prayer pots, it's got to be easy as fuck now with collapsible menus
---
At an average xp rate of about 30k/h crafting those runes it should have only taken around 3 hours. It's not really that slow, OP must've been doing like 10k xp/h for whatever reason. 
---
Doing this while playing my iron, super afk and decent exp rates.
---
are you replying my comment or talking with yourself huh?
---
Tips.
---
10% chance to steal your car stereo 
---
Yeah I think you're right. Maybe he could take the original spikes off the top of the slayer hell and just have the bosses horns/antennae whatever. Thatd be pretty cool
---
I don't have that knowledge. There are elections that have gone almost one-to-one with gallups, and there are elections that have been quite awkward to any gallups, take the 2016 US election as an example. However the majority of polls are closer to the first scenario, giving frames to what to expect, and usually they're accurate. Accurate enough or not, that's up to someone else to determine.

That's the boat to the f2p Halloween quest, can't remember the name

Acting the way you are put you at a "higher level of bad person" than this dude selling his rs gold.

Better suggestion: Put Lynx Titan as an NPC (with just 'examine' like BigRedJapan) on the max cape island who waves at players that come off of the boat
---
Well, jagex adds gpu rendering and ability to use more than 1 core and then the poly count shouldn't be as much of a hurdle.
---
I'm at 67 attack, Going for 70 for a whip.  I should have enough gold saved up from slayer when I hit 70 to buy it I think.

Karil's top, best in slot melee bottom that you own. And then blowpipe, accumalator, best range boots and then switch to melee: arclight, d defender, fire cape, and best in slot melee boots. 
---
you can flinch the monster. find a safespot, turn run on. hit the monster one time and run away, when its health bar goes away, repeat the process. should never attack you back
---
Weren't these only with the HD update? I don't think they would look right in the current game. 
---
RWT sites don't make money from buying gold, they make it from selling it you fucking idiot. The demand isn't particularly going to change and having more to sell isn't going to magically increase demand, unless they drop prices. They only bot to meet demand, if they need less for it they'll bot less.

This would make for a very good and important quality of life update IMHO.

Are you joking? Hurt the game? Without bots you‚Äôd never be able to train half of the skills you do without grinding like fuck.

&gt; Shouldn‚Äôt they be public so we know what actually got voted for?

There's no way to legitimately verify this even currently with the votes public; I don't know how others are voting, so what's stopping Jagex from slightly shifting votes towards a specific result?

There were 3 magic trees all in a grouping just outside lletya I used to wc instead. Far less competition for logs

Wouldn‚Äôt Karils/blessed d hide borrow be better than a Melee bottom simply for range DPS? Ideally you don‚Äôt take damage at gorillas

It‚Äôs much better when it‚Äôs legit.

Honestly learning a boss is just how much money you want to sink into supplies while you learn. While higher stats make it easier there's people that do bossing at much lower levels than what you have. Give what ever boss you want a shot but don't give up early. Learning what you need to do takes time
---
This would eliminate the dumb gimmicks of UIM
---
That‚Äôs a small margin, most RWTers are just regular players looking to get more out of the game by either selling their gold or buying to make the game less redundant.
---
He was getting like 12k an hour, not efficient at all

Did the increased pearl rate from aerial fishing pass? When would that be implemented if it did?
---
I mean it can be really op if you've ever been out the wildy. The idea os, in practice, 50% of anything happening, especially the rate of a pker reloading spec, is high, and imagining a scenario, even moreso today, where you have a chance of a guaranteed 50 ish today, is nuts,
---
Yeah, I know the first though it AGS or claws, but counter is those were only release.as the game grew in ags, playes, and features and mechanics. What makes those more balanced are increased armors, prayers, and the big fact that they have an accuracy based in skills and numbera, not literally a flip of a coin.
---
The spec would be cool now that the game has aged, but I wouldn't doubt in application it would still be crazy OP. but that's just a basic boi no knowledge guess, I love this game and just speak my mind rarely :)
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have come to the wildy for that clue step
---
Wooow. You're still mad you didn't get your spade eh?
---
I do actually.  That's why I think if what he did is bad enough to warrant a permanent ban, why aren't his other accounts being banned as well? No consistency.
---
Must have a small one to report over that
---
I cri evertim
---
 The easiest tip i can offer you to help is to use rings of dueling and barrows teleport tabs.
---
Say you use a barrows tele tab to get to barrows and when you run out of prayer you use the clan wars tele on a ring of dueling to refill hp pray and run energy at the white portal, and then barrows tele back, you will most likely save gp on your supplies cost, making overall profit higher ( duel ring teleports are 113 gp each, 58 gp if you alch them when they have one use left, barrows teles are 3k,) it takes about 2.5-3 refills through this method to cost as much as a single prayer potion, those refill should be enough to get you through a run.
---
as far as gear goes, you dont need a very high magic accuracy bonus to hit on the melee brothers, they have very very very low magic level, which is where the majority of your magic defense would come from.
---
a budget set of gear that might provide you more utility while still having less overall switches might be to wear
---
helm of neitznot ( prayer bonus and no negative bonuses)  
---
Blessed d'hide body ( ranged accuracy bonus and prayer bonus)  
---
proselyte cuisse/legs ( melee defense{for tunnels} and prayer bonus)
---
dragon boots ( melee defense and str bonus {for tunnels})  
---
salve amulet ( for killing skeletons in the tunnels)  
---
mage arena 2 cape&gt;ava's accumulator (mage arena cape for magical dmg, avas for to return ammo)
---
rune arrows  
---
ring of dueling
---
with weapons being ibans blast, magic shortbow, and a melee switch for tunnels if youd like.
---
with your normal rotation being DH&gt;GUTH&gt;KARIL&gt;TORAG&gt;VERAC/AHRIM&gt;AHRIMS/VERAC ( this rotation lets you have most of your prayer points for the most important brothers to pray against, and will end with you being adjacent to your tunnel so less walking time after killing brothers )
---
i would say if you have to, then use a single prayer pot dose maximum while killing the brothers, and another prayer pot dose while in tunnels if you have to to survive the tunnel brother.
---
use ibans blast on every brother but ahrims, who you should use the magic shortbow on.
---
when in the tunnels, you have a choice to make, maximum loot chance ( bolt racks, blood runes, key halves, and dragon med helms) kill like 4 skeletons or whatever gets you to 100%. OR maximum profit ( maximizes the amount of death runes you get per chest for higher gp/hr) kill 3 skeletons to do it how we did back in the day, or kill 2 skeletons and a bloodworm, which i believe is the meta the kids are doing these days.
---
my typical inventory usually consists of a spade, barrows teleports, whatever switches im bringing, fire runes and death runes for ibans blast, an emergency prayer potion, a shark and a karambwan for combo eating just in case something happens and i get hit for a 70 by dh in the tunnels, and 4-6 lobsters for healing if i need it.
---
i also tend to bring one of each chaos rune, blood rune, mind rune, bolt rack, and coin, just so that they will stack up nicely in my inventory. really feels impactful to know how many of each of those ive gotten during my search for an item.
---
17 ballista pieces 3 zenytes in 2k kills, 900/4 tasks dry ama

What are you talking about and how is it even relevant to the topic at hand? If you're saying a friend encouraged others to break runescape rules by gambling real life money on a gambling site I don't follow which rule that is.

If I need 71 agility for something specific; that'd be my goal.
---
I wanted 70 agility just for the Blue Dragon shortcut in Taverly Dungeon. That was my only reason, and my motivation was that it'd be useful for dragon bones later on. Agility sucks though and I have no known reason or want to go past 70.
---
Konar is far better for gp.
---
Why is a skilling pet available via pvm...?? 
---
Well if you say it in game you get muted (or atleast used to, don't try it) and well I guess he thought that it would be a fun meme to do so but wasn't too bright and obviously said it himself too
---
I kind of hope sparc mac sells 100B or however much he has, and just gets banned on his main and moves on to make a new account.  If that's the only punishment for RWTing as a content creator it seems pretty worth IMO
---
I'm going to go about my day and forget about you, while you spend the rest of the day thinking about how you were called out for pimping out your family for upvotes.

Lemme know if you need those fires/nats for the alch.

he's a legend tbh
---
I made sure I had full graceful and the Kandarin Hard diary completed so I could do the Seers course with the most exp per hour I could get, to make it go by faster. I also had the Runelite plugin that highlights where the click zones are, and had the eagle view camera. I also did this while catching up on some shows so it went by pretty quickly
---
Gotta remember that this game is almost primarily unsnipped eu boyz, they‚Äôre very self conscious about it 
---
Probably. There's some instances where you don't know if you're going to get ranged or maged so I just hope to tank with a melee bottom; the ranged attack of course. 
---
You guys are cry babies, I don't give a shit if someone loots the shit I don't take, it literally does nothing to affect me.
---
It's a waste of effort and risk for literally zero gain.
---
Damn, I can't imagine. I hit mine at about 1/500 and that started to feel bad
---
&gt; The other ones you can go and earn the resources yourself, say on an ironman, and then replicate the exp rates just fine. 
---
But then you're not getting those xp rates. That's like saying wines are faster than 1t karambwans because you get a huge stack for an inflated xp rate. Or that agility arena basically has an infinitely high xp rate because you can cash in the tickets for a 160m xp drop.
---
You need to factor in the time it takes to collect the resources if you decide to do that. Otherwise, the xp rate is inflated and useless.
---
&gt; No other method in the game is like this one.
---
That's true. It's not buyable, it's buy-only. But my point stands, it's still the same principle of using other players to increase your xp rates.
---
&gt; Lava runes also doesn't break even, you lose a decent amount of money doing them.
---
You lose very little. Sure, it adds up, but 200m costs what, like 100-200m? It's an irrelevant cost when you're at that stage. Even if you're not, consider this. It's less than 100k/hr. You're technically right though. I should've said basically break-even instead.
---
I don't follow your analogies at the end. You do get more xp for higher-leveled runes. It just so happens that Jagex decided to increase the xp you get from making combination runes because it requires you to spend a talisman every time you do it. At the time, they had no idea that they would add a spell a year later that removed that requirement.

How is giving card information to some underground chinese goldfarming company safe? You also pay before you receive the gold, therefore it's a trust trade at the end of the day. There is also no third party that can enforce anything if they scam, because you're breaking JaGeX ToS.

How is it afk? You still have to click from the spell to the rat. I'm just trying to figure out how that is any more afk than alching where you don't move the mouse - unless you can autocast what you are splashing with, of course
---
They're just messing with you -- it's a common meme around these parts. Sorry to hear about your dry streak. I thought that my 1827 KC for a black mask was bad, but it looks like yours is a lot worse.
---
RNG will eventually balance out though -- when I went back to that cave for a task later on, I got my second black mask at 1921 KC and my third at 1996 KC. For a drop rate of 1/512, I am nearing the rate for my fourth black mask. But compared to where I was initially (1827 KC), things are a lot more balanced now.
---
Good luck and hope luck swings back in your favor in the long-run!

Don't really want to watch 5 vorkath videos, but do any of these take supplies into account at all?

You're a fool. RWTing as a nonamer is one thing, they risk nothing beyond the account. But RWTing as a community figure / content creator?

Agreed if you‚Äôre not a fan of rs3 simply don‚Äôt watch rs3 videos.

All praise konar and the sweet sweet cash stacks
---
Same thing happened to me bro. I figured out that it must have been because I did the kebos diaries up to the mediums after doing the new lova quest and using my certificate to get up to 30% lovakengj. Was my last quest to do to regain my cape. Some of the tasks have you heal the shayzien warriors or do the gang activity which will count as you earning favor in said house even if you have 100% and locked em in. I‚Äôm guessing you may have done that like me? I was so confused too and am still dreading re doing all of that sulphur miningüòÖ

Thanks for the info! That sounds promising :)

Herb runs are pretty good, and the Konar drop table really makes slayer profitable in mid levels. 
---
He still dropped a sponsored Ironsides link in this video's description. Pretty poor taste, imo.
---
‚ÄúRequires too much engine work‚Äù.. For a game that has such a large player base I wouldn‚Äôt say there is any engine work that is too much
---
Wasn't bait. I went on mobile and alched them to be sure I wasn't just being a dick over the internet. He is right. You can alch defenders.
---
120 blue dragons in tavelry dungeon..trying to make some money too.  Thinking just fally teletabs and running back per inventory.  Is there a faster banking option?

He's implying you know nothing about the game. You can splash damage spells by having -65 magic bonus for up to 20 minutes at a time. 
---
That's hilarious lmao

if you wear a turtleneck in public you should kill yourself

Kurasks are OK at 70 slayer, they are like 400k to 500k an hour depending on your stats.

Generally in cases like this it means your account was compromised and used by someone else to bot with. Always always make sure to use two-factor authentication to make sure things like this don't happen.

Your wanting to slay a big black dick? It's normally the otherway around.

I prefer renaming it ‚ÄúRangedit‚Äù as coined by Slayermusiq1 :)

i remember sir jhmw
---
The slayer helmet combines all the head slot protective gear you could need into one helmet. Additionally, it incorporates a black mask, which gives a 15% accuracy and damage boost to melee while working on slayer tasks. If imbued in the nightmare zone, this bonus extends to ranged and magic as well. 
---
That makes sense. Just checked, got 28 extra kills so you were really close.
---
Why burst on defensive though? Is it just bursting or you should mostly be using magic on defensive? I know it's more total xp but I'm kind of looking to get my magic up quicker.
---
stopped at 80 and just did tick fletching and got to 85 from there
---
From what I remember playing back in 2005-2007 they were pretty much just big perverts who enjoyed stupidly boring grinds, much like us.
---
This is funny, but God forbid someone kill the bird while your favorite autist is 2 tick WCing on stream. That's disruptive behavior and deserves an instant ban, obviously. 
---
That's not a steel defender is it though
---
I like honey being a replacement for "The Stuff", it'll be good for when we get a Beer Overhaul eventually.

Which is bad, with the Jams they are their own things instead of being just modified potions.

It sounds like you know from experience?

Damn dude they're just a pvp clan that hadsbhad shady members. I doubt that every person in there is shitty or has done shitty things.

Ds2 is easier or at least less effort than a fire cape in imo since you can practise the boss fights in ds2 as much as your funds allow unlike Jad where you have to complete the rest of the fight caves to even practise Jad.
---
Same, did 2 runs last night, first I died on wave 35 cause for whatever fuckinf reason I turned off protect from magic and got one shot. Second attempt I made it to jad, had 9 sara brews and restores left, started freaking out and died. Sucks man, going for 3rd today.

Don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs our fault for missing the sarcasm, if anything it‚Äôs your fault for not being clear enough. Just laugh and move on.

Daamn, two Rune full in 120 kills, you made bank on this!

&gt;Do you even F2P pk?
---
I joined in 2008 and *never* saw the appeal to that. Plus, it's rather pointless to f2p PK because the best loot you can acquire from each other is either rune armour or green dhide - neither of which are valuable.
---
What's the xp/h?
---
If you're really good at flicking bandos and tick eating you can actually manage dozens of kills pretty easily (plenty of youtube vids to back that up). That requires insane timing though and things like sweets to maintain really long trips. Realistically for most people a 10kc trip would be a really good on with maybe 3-5 being standard depending on stats/gear/supply drops.
---
more like $3k, but yeah the loss in potential profit is higher than that
---
The fastest 99 fletching guy used remapped mouse keys which is allowed. Teleporting your cursor to a specific coordinate isn‚Äôt allowed.
---
brutal blues are basically the same stats as brutal blacks but with considerably worse drops.
---
they require a pretty big chunk of pray pots/scales to use which eat into the profit substantially.
---
Can we get a quest where we have to pet the goodest bois of RuneScape and give them treats and shit? Reward can be a puppy that you can grow into a dog with love and meat.  Like Gertrude‚Äôs cat but gooder.
---
This actually makes me sad. Back in [actual] 2007, I would spend everyday here for months and months. Always on World 89, chopping magics. The same people would always be there too, there were like 10 of us, and we all became really good friends. Chopping magics, high alching magic longbows between the two torches, follow-dancing just because, waiting for each other to finish a full inventory of magics so we didn't have to run to the bank alone, etc. All of them have quit the game now and become [#234237489]'s on my friend's list; but I'll still come here every now and then just for nostalgia.
---
Did you do the new quests that came out with kourend? They reward with a 10% favour scroll. Reading those even with locked 100% favour in it's house would make you lose favour in lovakengj.
---
It can only be that or you never had the favour at all. There's no other possible reason.
---
Not with those non combat skills 
---
Yeah, I'm not surprised. I do a lot with my POH, and since there's a slot in the magic wardrobe for it, I've been trying to get it.
---
You need to be on lunars either way to teleport back after crafting. Ourania teleport.
---
Instead of kalphites I'd rather see konars dungeon. It has more variety in there to kill, while kalphite cave is only kalphites and queen. They both also have real close fairy rings 
---
laughs superior windows vista at that time
---
1 in 9 4 me
---
Mining guild invisible +7 boost so
---
I can‚Äôt.
---
You also unlock Tairns Lair teleport and Dark Beasts on the ring already, kalphite tele would be too for kq, fairy ring is enough really 
---
Correct me if I'm wayyy off but wouldn't that require engine work or a brand new engine that can handle high poly count?
---
Get that up 
---
"I got magic seeds"
---
Just delete the game. 
---
It gets better as you go on, but 75 slayer for Gargoyles is when i would say it starts to get very profitable. From those you can make about 1m per task
---
I just do 20 laps a day honestly and alch. I do that for most skills I hate, I‚Äôm also doing a construction level a day so. Makes it way less tedious and instead of doing the same thing for hours I do it for 20 minutes, definitely drags it out but it keeps me from burning out.
---
Haha they'd have to add it as a drop from monsters or something, I feel like it isn't needed and if was to be introduced they would of done it years ago
---
Maple and addy arrows hit very well for f2p tbh
---
Oh yeah, it'd be a massive engine work, but it's the direction OldSchool needs to head toward soon.
---
It will give him a lot of content, The Gauntlet will give him new crystal armour and new skilling boss will give him skilling stuff
---
Solos take about an hour each and it's around 13k points I believe.
---
No but nice try 
---
Ahahaha filth rune pic peasant 
---
13500 points a game solo
---
Carrying multiple potions just to get around in a quest takes *soooo* much skill dude
---
Yeah I‚Äôd prefer something like 100k and another 100k if you die
---
Fair enough, you have your answer for a non fucking insane person though
---
Ah who am I kidding, no sane person attempts this
---
I did not know crates could have that much stuff in them... wtf.

I'll vote yes if the only spots to rest at are outside of banks or little benches at the end of agility courses with a man selling brightly coloured sports drinks.

That's not true.  Take a 6 letter password (letters only). Non case sensitive is 2\^28 options, case sensitive is 2\^34 possible options. Those are massively different numbers and it only goes up for someone using say a 18-20 character password.

Pick all your drops up though. If it stacks, pick it up, if it's over 1k, grab that shit.

Every bit helps

Why on earth would you assume I'm advocating it? I've literally never staked in my life. I'm against people petitioning against things because of their own personal experiences were negative. Anyone who's played this game for a while knows what the DA is about. Also I take no responsibility for parents letting their kids gamble. Stupid people gamble, smart stupid people know that 50/50 odds is as good as gambling gets.

&gt; Non case sensitive is 2^28 options, case sensitive is 2^34 possible options.
---
I don't understand how you're getting this. Could you explain?
---
a-z is 26 characters, 0-9 is 10 characters. 36 characters. So shouldn't non-case-sensitive for a 6-letter password be 36^6 possibilities and case-sensitive 62^6 possibilities?

Gotcha. I'd try the steam lava law combo in your runepouch. Teles about everywhere, including the house in one inv slot. 
---
Then you could bring the holy wrench and save more on prayer doses.
---
Exactly.  I'm not advocating for a friend, I could give two shits about his accounts, I think his content has actually improved since the bans (though not much), I just think they were really lenient given the circumstance, in which normal players may not have the same luxury (and content creators, as said by jagex, should be held to a higher standard).
---
Teleport to house in taverly, and use a glory or dueling ring to bank.

I love lending stuff out also. Haven‚Äôt been scammed yet although it‚Äôs inevitable. I don‚Äôt have much though so maybe people take pity on me üòÇ

Zmi with runelite gpu mode
---
Rag and bone man 2 can go alch itself
---
Eh that's true, but Mole isn't worth hunting unless you have Falador Hard diary anyway, so saying it's low-level content is a little misleading. 
---
And while Dharrocks is the most expensive of the Barrows, it is
---
A) well worth it for NMZ, PC, and several other minigame and training methods. 
---
B) still only what 8m tops? Minus any pieces you can pick up from Barrows, I would still solidly put that at Mid-level content. 
---
Pretty sure he can still come back to OSRS on new main and not get banned so long as he doesn't continue to break rules
---
Sounds good!
---
Defensive stats help. Lol. One argument as to why they shouldn't be removed, they are a form of outsmarting your opponent. PVP in a general sense is about outsmarting your opponent and killing him no? The same people complaining about getting skull tricked are the guys who camp wildly looking for guys on tasks or pvmers on regular world's. The emote is not usable in the wildy only usable in town. Suggestion you can take your fights outta town and not get ragged.
---
KempQ is probably a top ten osrs player. If you're good at something dont do it for free. Theres really no point in having over a few bil anyway. This guy is in college a few $1000 goes a long way
---
So, let‚Äôs say you do this. Ask every person who you get as a target to sell. Let‚Äôs assume they have to risk 75k to give you a pet chance. Let‚Äôs also assume that most people sell kills for 100-150k. You may get 2-5 people to sell to you an hour if you‚Äôre lucky considering most people will be out there wanting to kill their target to get a chance at pet as well. With the drop rate at 1/4K it would take anywhere from 800-2000 hours and cost 400-600m. I understand that we play RuneScape and some players are willing to go through these extreme lengths to get a pet, but it is highly unlikely the percentage of players doing this outweighs amount of players legitimately participating in bounty hunter in attempts to get the pet. It would take much longer to achieve the pet by boosting than by achieving it through actually killing people if you are decent at PvP. 
---
I agree, well said
---
Reported using total xp and level. Enjoy your ban mate.
---
hushh, let them think they cheated the system 
---
Actually not as bad as I thought! Great man, such a good cape to have early on!
---
Could've brought seasoning? 
---
Cannon that shit
---
You don't. You use stony basalt, I think, with fremmy hard diaries and 73 agility. 
---
Since you spend no time waiting on games it's more xp hr overall. Also, you always repair the brasier, so it's more con xp hr since you are always the one repairing it.

much more efficient for loot but less efficient for xp in fm but you get the con xp as a boost

I don't know why i laughed so much at this.
---
I like this a lot, i'd allways go for a constant buff that doens't temporarily decrease that's also hard to make. Sure, it devalues potions but any new content introduced in the game is going to do that no matter what.

You misread. I said you may get 2-5 people to sell to you an hour. It really wouldn‚Äôt be considered a ‚Äòbuyable‚Äô pet because I assume most people that have it will be people who legitimately play bounty hunter. Technically, all pets are farmable or buyable. You can go into zulrah as many times as you want and kill it for a pet. Just because some people are going to boost it doesn‚Äôt mean that it shouldn‚Äôt be in the game. That‚Äôs like saying Jagex shouldn‚Äôt of released infernal cape because some people would buy/sell the service to obtain it. 
---
Dang this really shows powercreep huh

That is RWT, it's not an assumption. You don't understand that Jagex can ban you for whatever the fuck they want and you couldn't say a thing about it. They OWN your account. They found that he breached TOS on multiple levels and banned him yet people (read RWT apologists) still defend him.

Not really an argument is it. Doesn't in any way address any of OP's concerns at all.
---
&gt;One argument as to why they shouldn't be removed, they are a form of outsmarting your opponent
---
But it's not outsmarting them in any way? It's not smart to do the trick, and it's not a failure to fall for it, if the spec looks identical and the punishment for not reacting to a dclaw rush would be potentially instant death.

There's no time limit if either the lock is bypassed or the hash is leaked.

And you understand how dictionary attacks work right? Because I'm fairly certain runescapers are a demographic particularly susceptible to them. Case sensitivity basically makes dictionary attacks either O(n\^2) or O(n!) harder to perform. I forget the classification off the top of my head but im sure you can look it on a big-o chart if you care to.

Do an hour or 2 every day and it will be done in a week or 2 and do whatever else in the meantime. Break it up by doing farm runs for extra gold too.

My guess is each ammo type produces a different item id on the blowpipe, so adding recolors means producing darts*colors amounts of "new" items. So even one recolor would produce 7+ new items

Why is having a small number of big companies controlling the market detrimental to the consumers but good for economic growth?
---
Because they weren't involved in the offense; hence they are not part of the chain. If he just made level 3 mules he'd still get his main banned as a part of the chain.
---
There's also a pretty high likelihood that he was banned via automated systems so of course his other accounts weren't touched.

can I just say that when i came back to this game in 2017 I was making my own way and decided to kill a skeleton in edgeville at 20cb and found a weird skeleton scroll that I kept and still have to this day. I didn't search about what it was until months later while reading on wiki. It was my 3rd or 4th skeleton kill.

Jagex actually does give hints about what type of information is incorrect. However, they'll only do if if you pass their automatic check. This automatic check basically determines whether or not your appeal has even the slightest chance of getting accepted. They do this by checking the bare minimum, for example you need to have at least one (previous) password correct. If you don't pass, you get a near instant denied reply back.
---
If you do manage to pass their automatic check. A Jagex employee will manually investigate the appeal. If it still fails you'll get feedback on where to improve. Keep in mind that this feedback is intentionally vague, as otherwise they might help hijackers too much. This is also the reason why there is no Live Chat or phone support. 
---
Oh, one more thing. The "additional information" section is irrelevant if you don't pass the automatic check. Its not even a high priority. All Jagex needs and wants to know is in the fields above it. 
---
Go get arclight, you already have 75 attack, it‚Äôs easy to get, and your stats are relatively low. You will struggle without it. 
---
The extra security you're talking about, in reality, does nothing. People often talk about being able to call in for verification to recover accounts, Blizzard did this, and hysterically, even some of the most high profile players were able to have their accounts hijacked because the person calling in knew a previous email, and it was game over. 
---
[This is the video i'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_3PZoWVd58)
---
Does this happen in RS? No. Simply knowing someone's email is not going to result in Jagex looking at the recovery appeals and saying "yep, this guy is totally the original account owner." As we've seen from countless smackdowns, Jagex does put in a great deal of effort to assess whether or not the appeal is coming from a legitimate source or has legitimate info. If the information is legitimate, *how much* information does this person have? The steps they take are 100% known, we have known how they conduct themselves for a long time now.
---
The reality is this: your account is never, EVER, going to get hijacked without knowing an enormous amount of account information. Even if every database in the world were to be breached, unless they can link that information to YOUR account, it's worthless. Even then, say they do, "oh look, found Joe Bob's email and I know it's to his RS account!" what is he going to do with it? If Jagex can see the account owner has been successfully playing on their account for months/years and out of the blue comes a recovery appeal, and all it contains is... an email, and for whatever reason you Joe Bob decided to recycle the same passwords, do you think that appeal is going to hold up against recovery scrutiny? It won't. 
---
This is becoming lengthy, so i'll tl;dr this for you to make it simple, because I think you got lost in the J. Mods response and as to why the OP was full of shit
---
J. Mod stated that the email used had been used across 40+ accounts. That is insane, and the only reason that would happen is if the email was used to essentially serve as a "mule" for account sales. The same email and other credentials being used to log into this account points to this being the absolute only scenario.
---
Stevew might used the word "hijacked," but the reality is they accounts are being sold and recovered left, right and center.
---
Your account will *never* be compromised as long as you conduct your due-diligence. This is why maybe every year or two I create a completely new email and password and change it. Set up authentication on your email so that the only possible way to access it is through YOUR PHONE and yours alone; if they offer one-time-use codes in the event you don't have access to your phone, write them down and keep them safe; don't recycle the same password and use uppercase and symbols; lastly, of course, use a bank pin... sure, some people think you can "bruteforce" 10,000 potential combinations, but the reality is it's a painstaking task due to limited tries slowing it down. 
---
tl;dr tl;dr- as long as you follow the steps of 
---
* new email
---
* new password
---
* email authentication
---
* RS account authentication
---
* bank pin
---
And *NEVER SHARING THIS INFORMATION* you will never get hijacked. I'm in the same boat as you, my account is 15 years old, yet I don't lose a wink of sleep over it getting hijacked because I know everything is locked down securely on my end.

Meeh but meh f2p PK meta errrrrr I can't even!!! Bunch of cowardly millenials.
---
??? Whats stopping you from checking the rewards on the wiki
---
It's insanely easy and pretty quick to kill. The reason for killing it is the pet chance, not the loot. 
---
Cant recall exactly. I know they mentioned it in a Q&amp;A. Theres some things in the engine that are shitty. Same thing with NPC's in cutscenes being you as a character so they can do more stuff with movement. No idea how this works.
---
Don't do it til you have Arclight. I tried it the other night with basically those stats, and no Arclight. Long and short of it is most guides/players massively undersell the potential to die. If you get unlucky with 0s, the eyes take too long to go down, or if the boss simply decides that melee is for chumps and hits you with loads of mage, there's every chance you run out of food before you can kill him.

I don't really use my pc for anything outside of rs and youtube/Netflix but I guess it's possible.  I think they were able to use the account recovery from an old email that I took off the account because that's where the initial recovery email was directing to.  I had 2fa on my current email and account but guess it didn't really do anything

No, you really don't pk. And if you do, you must be a terrible pker. You wonder why pkers freeze constantly? Because it's BiS. It stops the people moving for 20 seconds. It's the best in game. It stops people from running from 30 wilderness and teleing. I'd like to see you pk and get a few kills without freezes. Gl.

Wilderness is about risk/reward. Typically things in the wildy are more rewarding because you're at risk of being PK'd. The people killing you aren't doing it for your 30k, they're doing it for the exact reason you made this post. You're frustrated. Not because you lost 30k, but because someone else spent (or perhaps as you see it, "wasted") their time trying to ruin your gameplay experience. They didn't win because of your 30k, they won because someone was trying to do something more rewarding in the wildy, and they stopped them, and now you're here bitching about it on the official reddit. Way more rewarding to a griefer than a fair fight with decent loot.

actually it is pretty much all one click actions so it is  probably the most efficient in terms of click intensity vs reward

Thanks :)

I'm not *being* one. I suggest a harmless, logical idea and everyone shits on it. Everyone I meet ingame is great, but everyone on this subreddit's rather rude and elitist.

Just got Dark Claws from 1kc Skotizo so I'm in for a visual buff for the purple helm.

Both are ranged thrown weapons that have the same thrown speed and that are primarily used for PVP, One is significantly better than the other. I compared them to rune knives for that purpose so /u/LothricsLegs knows their main purpose and has something to compare them to and understand what they are.

Maybe you can say they're bad for the game, but I dont think the tryhard side of the community is any better.
---
In fact, I'd say its more common to see someone look down on another player for not having some kind of gear or playing in an inefficient manner. The hyper efficient crowd that tick mines until they break a sweat is usually the crowd I see actually acting rude to others.

best part is it is all f2p... I would like to have a fury on him or some real accuracy/str gear but it isn't worth the bonds. Especially if I start actually killing monks as a result.

I didn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs pretty cool

Probably because you can play OSRS for thousands of hours, so it is blocked. But you get on RS3 after 15 minutes so they don‚Äôt even bother.

Thanks will add for future

Just put a damn lynx on the max cape island guys its that easy

The perk allows you to repeat the task if you want but I want to repeat the exact same task at the exact same place.

Apparently everyone clicks the phishing links on twitch and Facebook nowadays. So make sure you avoid those.

sounds like summoning with extra steps

Thanks. I need to learn Kree‚Äôarra but I am a quick learner and have watched guides. 95 range with decent gear. Added hope you‚Äôll still run with me. Have like 300 vork kills so I‚Äôm familiar with range bossing mechanics.

Get a stylus for accurate clicks. Make sure your connection is good.
---
I‚Äôve been pking since 05. I would argue that this is well written bullshit. Good job on an eloquent paragraph. the loot literally makes the experience as well as engaging fights 
---
I get excited over a 30k pk

Currently getting stats for MM2 and DS2

Yeah for sure. Kree is super simple not much to it
