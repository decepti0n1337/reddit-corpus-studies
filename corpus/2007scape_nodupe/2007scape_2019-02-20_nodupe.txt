&gt;hard lumby diary for a mediocre shield

---
Why does every fucking suggestion on this sub need to add a diary requirement for low-medium content?
---
I can't see it at all
---
Oh no wonder, drives me nuts because there’s no damn O in definitely.
---
im level 1 construction
---
No, its sudoku

Is there an ETA of when this nerf will arrive?
---
Now we have two holidays a week. I am ok with this

I was gonna say its $11 USD but then I saw you mentioned buying via a VPN looping through Mexico. How does this work? Asking for a friend

That is what he does

Can dark totem pieces continue to be received if we already have 3 in the bank? Preventing additional totem piece drops makes no sense as you can already stack full totems.

Do you use runelite or OSbuddy

Thats because youre negative in the second? The difference between +1 positive mage accuracy bonus vs +150 does not matter against a 0 defense enemy. You can still be positive with wearing proselyte top/bottom. 
---
Again there is a detailed explanation about how accuracy works vs 0 mage def pvm npcs on the wiki and videos about it that explain it better than i am. 
---
Are you sure they aren't just alts?
---
Wyvern alts were super popular for awhile
---
Lumbridge hard diary for a less than addy kite? No thank you. 
---
So with that being said, how strongly do you feel about having to have this as a skill? If it were instead labeled as a new activity, either widespread or centralized to a certain area, would this demerit the idea in anyway? 
---
In fact, wouldn't it make more sense, keeping in mind the simplicity of existing skills? If this combines the use of multiple skills as described, then it wouldn't need to be it's own skill, rather a diverse activity that gives more uses to bland skills such as FM, ect.
---
Construction could be a key component as well for building ships
---
I  saved up for a ring on wealth to help my drop rates here.
---
Cause 90 smithing fucking sucks btw
---
Gz alch yourself :) 
---
Make it the attempting to reconnect bar and I’ll support this 
---
Nex or curses would do it. We've already past the point of no return.
---
Polls are actually detrimental to the game how they're currently handled as they give the players, majority of which have no knowledge of game design, too much power and I can only imagine how limiting it is as a developer. 
---
Jesus fucking christ will you all stop with your devalued ironmen?!?! You are all devaluating my devalue ironman and it's been really rough lately

wow you caught me on

Huh interesting, might have to try it out. I've got some spare imp boxes from zeah library in the bank.
---
Are you really going through with this...
---
I’ve seen Jagex being spelt some weird ways over the years, but haggled made me laugh uncontrollably.
---
Also you bought your money, be it 1b or 10m on you unless you have 95+ slayer
---
There was no botting involved with what I’m saying. It’s literally marking tiles, not playing the game for you.  You can do the same thing in runelite
---
thatsmyfetish.gif

They'll have to poll it, program it and then release it, I'd say maybe 2-3 weeks?

That one dude makes up like 75% of the words in that thread lol. He's insufferable but unfortunately right.

It’s not a bug it’s a feature

Maybe less skewed, but yes.

I mean it's not a scam. I'm just now sure how else too liquidate these items. 
---
the second setup has positive magic accuracy.
---
weird
---
Looked at your account and no way I am going to,argue with a weed smoking leafs fan that collects jersies, Lol it is like arguing with myself
---
I’m just sick of how much people are bitching lately
---
Uh... Wintertodt
---
If you have the Lumbridge hard done, I'm assuming 8m is not an impossibly large sum of money for you to acquire. I never said you should always buy a DFS.
---
You’ve commented on the wrong post that’s why people are downvoting
---
Should the goal be to buy dhcb and rigour?
---
Think you’re investing in stats / to investing in gear ratio might be a bit off at that point then. Great that you want those levels but that’s on you for not having 8m to spend on gear imo
---

Just grind for a bond rather than trying to scam one on reddit?

Well then time to rise and grind!
---
as the holder of over 15,000,000 slayer experience i can confirm that this is true 
---
I think they could release Nex if they offered alternative rewards than T80s and bonus HP gear, but I don't know what would be appropriate. I'd rather we got a new boss anyway.
---
Curses would be a hard red line, for certain.
---
Legit a full arm set and a pet in 10kc -_-
---
So a question that provoked a discussion on a Q and A post is the wrong question? 
---
Could be. It would have to be a bare min alt. That would make sense though 
---
Usable only by HCIM
---
Why does it matter how easy it is to acquire 8m if you shouldn't use that 8m to buy the shield anyways? 
---
That is not most of the rs3 playerbase. That was just one random person kinda like how this sub gets random stupid posts
---
If you are looking for specific pieces send me a pm

Ouu. Very nice. How long does he/she measure?

You are far enough on the spectrum to get my upvotes.

We don’t dislike the PK’ers. We dislike the predatory system they’re forced to use. 
---
Tbh to wanna get into PK stuff but the game is poorly designed in terms of combat levels reflecting strength, gear determining proficiency, and meaningful rewards for splitting inventory.
---
Aside from that they don’t encourage PvP. They encourage killing players who aren’t looking to fight back which is boring. 
---
Why is every suggestion made behind an achievement diary barrier? There should be a way to obtain new early game items without having to slug through a hard diary requirement.

I want to train my farming to 40 to get to do Cave Horrors. I'm currently 25 mostly quests and don't really know how-to start training it. What's the best way to go about This? Any good guides out there? Thanks
---
Buff Swampletics
---
I know that. Do you only have (4) potions banked right now? Not going to decant my potions everytime I used them. most people with a sorted bank have a tab with all the 1, 2, 3 and 4 doses of their potions there
---
Fletching comment? Check.
---
Racism? Check.
---
Stupid ironman? Check.
---
Can I train FM by burning you at the stake?
---
Me thinking I had 500iq thought buying hammers in shanty pass for 1gp and selling them for 25gp in the ge would be amazing profit. Safe to say after a few days doing this I was still poor 
---
I never understood why people keep so many different doses people of potions. There's an NPC in the ge who can decant them all in 1 click.
---
Setup video?
---
you mean thikksd
---
If not a new skill this could be a great mini game
---
Can we ban these? I was doing this on my alt but the price has been plummeting.
---
Search for potion in your bank and I bet you do not only have (4) potions in there
---
What is this organization you speak of?
---
Check the wiki for training. It will give you seed prices so you can figure out the best method for your level. Generally the idea is herbs are for slow levels but money. Tree are for fast levels but are expensive. At your level nothing will be super expensive though so you can basically start with whatever the best seeds are. Look up the best patches for your type of run and make sure you have the correct tele’s for those patches. 
---
The glory amulet of bravery.
---
This idea is cool as fuck, I like it!
---
I never knew it did that, just because it's dead content tbh. Like the idea though, but also worry about what it could do to the BGS. Though I suppose mostly ironman would use this.

It's literally his job to play. Seems a bit rude to call someone a manchild for earning money.
---
V
---
Yea lol
---
Would be so nice.
---
It's a pain to have to remember to decant stuff after a slayer trip or pvm trip.
---
My rebuttal is that some people don't have enough time to have a job and play osrs, like for me I have 4 hours to play on school days, it either get a job and not play osrs or play osrs and not have a job 
---
Whenever I come across a gold doubler I always trade with them and offer 1gp. 99 percent of the time they tell me to fuck off and stop wasting their time, but every once in a while they lol and give me 2gp back. I highly recommend it.
---
omfg
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku harakiri, yeah. literally "belly cut"
---
I just bank all of them and when I run out of (4) potions I decant all my 1, 2 and 3's. However it does take up so much space indeed..
---
Gg I remember this scam in the general shop in lumby. Bastards must have made away with hundreds of gp from innocent noobs. 
---
Some will say it's fake
---
I don't bother keeping a tab with all of the different doses since it takes up so much space. I let them float to the general tab until I either use it or toss it, and then don't worry about the wasted space for no reason other than "order" for things I'll never use. Might just be me, though?
---
Yeah it's just a space monster. 
---
Ignoring avernic defender as its 10x the cost, the dragon defender is only better if you need the dps. Lots of people need the extra defense. "Super antifires" are definetly a good option but at 12k+ a piece, if you're a lower level or just have longer kill times that adds up fast. Dropping 100-150k on potions or more per dragon task adds up really fast. This shield is litterally ment for those lower levels, it provides a fantastic defensive bonus. Also, its "BiS" offhand for defense. The defender is "BiS" for offense, both can be true at the same time lol.
---
hows it feel knowing ur party is now controlled by a socialist

Though it's a pity you're accused a scammer instantly I get where it's comming from, happen to me too, the scam.

I know it's nitpicking, but as a high legend HS player who started playing in tournaments the last couple months, I disagree. The stakes are high and it's just like any other competitive game. When ranks or money are on the line, things can get the blood flowing, whether it's a card game or MMO.

---
I don't feel extremely strongly that this needs to be a new skill and not an activity.  I do, however, think it fits the criteria of a major skill, especially with the possibility of expansion into others skills such as construction like you mentioned.  
---
My main goal with this post is to see if this activity as a whole sounds fun and interesting to players.  There is certainly room for expansion, incorporating other skills, and allowing the activity to create new possibilities for playing the game like other skills.
---
While I would agree that the proposal as a whole, as it stands now, is rather self contained like a minigame, it certainly has room to influence the game at large.  Similar to why sailing would make sense as a skill, it would allow for new content, new areas, new unlocks, etc.  Part of why I wanted to post this, is to have the exact discussion of where we can take the idea. And I'm certainly open to incorporating ideas and editing until we have a more refined concept.
---
I do, however, wonder about my first point: That us Runescape players have defined what a skill should be to the point where they are nearly impossible to create.  I have changed my opinion on the matter throughout the years, going from someone who had a 2 hour debate on youtube about not introducing GWD to Old School, to someone who feels we need to allow for more experimentation and iteration.  
---
Mukdip Btw HCIM
---
Yeah we'll also depends on my hits but kind of the point of the post is that something that is mid-tier should require maxed gear to be remotely efficient. It's barely worth doing for the amount of granite dust you get.
---
These are all better ideas than jagex would ever implement
---
Pvp is fun when it's not you getting one-sidedly dumpstered or you dumpstering someone else. Actual fights are rare outside of structured pvp because everyone has different amounts of gear they're willing to risk, different stats, and maybe even a team behind them. 
---
Running around with a clan killing 4-iteming pvmers is not fun. Getting killed by a clan while 4-item pvming is not fun. Killing clue scrollers is not fun. Getting your group wiped by a substantially bigger clan is not fun. Spending the vast majority of the time that you want to pvp just looking for people to fight (read: not people that will just run away) is not fun. Structured pvp is not fun.
---
There's just so many ways to go wrong. Maybe I'll eventually try brid nhing when I get the money. Every time I've tried pking has ended up in a disappointing hour or two wandering around looking for someone to fight and running into the scenarios listed above. I just don't think one-sided fights are that fun.

Use a warrior ring instead of b ring
---
The skill tab is certainly nostalgic and integral to OSRS, but I still vividly remember hunter and farming being released.  Even though the tabs changed size and location slightly, it never really felt out of place.
---
There are two central problems I see with only refining, updating, and expanding new skills:
---
 1)  For players who already have high skill totals in these skills, a vast majority of new content becomes immediately irrelevant to them.  Part of what makes a skill enjoyable, in my eyes, is the sense of progression with each milestone.  Once you release shipbuilding in construction, for instance, you would need to add a lot of incentive for 99 construction accounts to care about anything besides the highest tier
---
2) At a certain point, arguably already, there will be no room for anything new to the production chain.  For instance, we only have 3 combat styles.  Once there is a skill to craft each one, there is never a reason to implement an equipment-producing skill ever again.  In a system such as ours, it may require an entirely new way of playing the game to warrant implementing new skills. If Piracy became a thing, for instance, it opens the doors to several new skill concepts (sailing, swimming/diving, Shipbuilding, etc) which would make no sense in our currently limited context.
---
We all play this game because we enjoy it, and the biggest fear we all share is that something will come along and make us not enjoy it anymore.  I do feel, however, that if we stick to the 3 skill-design principles  I stated previously, we have a much greater chance to foster enhanced enjoyment from the game rather than turning people away.
---
How do you do this ?

When you drink absorptions then realize you forgot your rockcake

This is a perfect suggestion for this thread. Im lucky i still have a screenshot of myself doing this

Medium &amp; locked behind DS2 start.
---
This way mid-level accounts don't readily have access to it, you can actually slap a small STR bonus on it to be rewarding loot, and you can keep it out of Green dragon bots.

A normal player can get the medium diary done quite easily while bots cannot. 
---
FYI you can't cancel the jump attacks on the walls in the temple

Thank you for your support sir

I don't think tick manipulation is a bad thing, I think more click intensive methods deserve more exp an hour. I do agree that balancing exp rates around tick manipulation is not necessarily a good thing though.. but I'm not entirely sure what activity/skill has been balanced around tick manipulation that you're seeing.
---
that makes sense

Plenty of players do cannonballs when they arent down in the dumps price wise. I do them at work lol

they were going to based exp rates around sandstone mining around tick manipulation.  To achieve exp rates equal to mlm you would have to manipulate ticks, balancing exp around that is IDIOTIC.

I actually did a shit-load or Vorkath (700 or some) with Karils/Rangers Hat and Blowpipe because I didn’t have void upon release. Worked just fine tbh

Except completing all content in a chunk is a very vague term. For example, shouldn’t he have to get 99 WC, fletching, FM, thieve, combats, prayer and herb all in the first tile because he can technically train it there? That’s why I didn’t like the series, the rules are just too iffy and his videos take forever to show any progress.

---
Would the tradeoff of ranged bonus really be worth considering veracs for more defense? I feel like DPS is already a struggle with 80 ranged. The pray bonus is negligible as I only use 2 pray pots max with my current setup. 
---
The Sara brews seem to mean I can't really maintain max range either. Hopefully someone can enlighten me on the magic of Sara brews, they heal 56 hp at my lvl - 1/3l4rd for the super restores for a total of 42 but at a cost of 14 range levels and having to wait until I am down to 39 hp to eat in 4 ticks (3 doses to max hp+super restore) which seems like quite the tradeoff VS 22, being able to heal at a high hp in 1 tick and the extra ranged lvls.
---
Most of the video guides I've seen they are using angler fish but there are a few that use Sara brews. I feel like the issue is my dps especially where I've gotten so close, but hey that's why I'm here asking questions! 
---
Yes exactly. I did my first cape with ancestral top and no bottoms til around wave 48+ where magers and rangers both appeared. Then I wore ancestral top + justiciar legs for the rest of the waves.

I played this game called pixel piracy in the past. You sort of customize your own ship and crew and go around raiding items and saving people and such. You should look up the game as it could be a good inspiration for the new skill.

Considering you switch to protect from ranged after the first phase, why veracs?

It is if you get the right items and that varies daily. Check alchmate for a current list of items that profit.

most of the guides are doing it with stats that dont need brews. if you look up anyone doing galvek at 75 ish range theyll bring brews.

I did an 220 Abysal demon task earlier and got 6, way over drop rate but it's all rng.

They are gone. Should’ve set further steps to prevent something like this from happening.

That's what you get for downloading the inferno bot 3000.

Does this count as r/beetlejuicing ?

oh that was some random saying that

Lots and lots of research. Many studies have shown that subconsciously we attempt to relate to other people. We are more likely to change our stance on something if does not conform to the normative behavior of the majority.

Lol, okay. Nah I was downloading apex the other night and think I got a bunk version of origin. Thanks for your input though

That’s total he’s ever done, items are stuff he’s gotten since it’s been implemented.

So that’s probably wrong
---
Ignore the veracs idea. That idea is bad. Get all the range bonus you can. That anguish is going to make it easy. I promise. If you are wasting ticks eating, try a few karamwan for those emergency gotta eat moments. Brews would be easier, but you do as you like. I think the anguish is gonna be the bump you need to make it easy.

The saying goes "strike while the iron is hot". I actually had these done last November but got swamped with exams and didn't remember to continue work on them until I saw GentleTractor's post a few days ago. While I love GentleTractor's suggestions, what I think his version lacks is the identification and amendment of the UI elements that make the interfaces clunky in the first place.

How and where do you buy t10? I really want a rune pouch.

I feel like the more people I talk to the more I hear this and it drives me nuts.

A kid in my chat was complaining about not enjoying slayer and I asked him why and he literally said this sort of statement. He only efficiencyscapes tasks and if he wants to boss he will only due zulrah/vorkath if he's off task because it's 'not worth it without the bonuses.'
---
Man it's sad this mindset has taken over, I'm nearly maxed but I do not agree, nor partake in this effiencyscape mindset at all. It's way more fun to do whatever the fuck I want to make money instead of thinking, "If i'm not doing Vorkath I'm wasting time." Like the other guy said, if you're thinking that might as well just get a job and pay for bonds.
---
I would love if you could choose your next chunk, but the next potential chunks you can go to are limited. The available next chunks are determined by how far away from "home base" (in the starting case, "home base" is lumby), the next chunk is. Then your "home base" expands as your available chunks expand. I see a world where the RNG does not go your way several times, and will lead to a very poor set of chunks that you have access to.
---
I think this will provide better content (You have to be strategic about the next chunk you take), and will not be so grindy for both you and the viewers.
---
but if you have base 70s you could easily make money to spare on a dfs instead of spending money on skilling, since it's relatively "cheap" compared to most other expensive upgrades at that level that people strive towards e.g. bandos armour, primordials or torture it's probably the best way to spend your gold on an upgrade.

As much as I agree with your second point the fact you get kicked off it being used as a teleport wasn’t meant to be intended in the first place. It just happens to be a good way to get to Vorkath easily. I don’t think they will add a teleport with the diary.
---
Hope you did morty hard diary
---
If it's a near useless shield, why are you giving a shit about it? Let's just give away free content, which is frankly stupid. If you don't like requirements then how the fuck are you still playing a game that's filled with requirements ?
---
And a lot of updates and requirements have changed due to bots. But you must be way smarter than Jagex who has all the data and spreadsheets while you have some stupid narrow view against those actions.

That’s why I’m asking for feedback. Do you prefer it to be longer? Etc?

Your sentence is a fragment and it's missing punctuation. Behind thot

Fare enough lol. I just think splashing has been around long enough now that taking it away would be unfair to those that got to do it
---
If it were a small match of the same ratio, the osrs players could spec the Rs3 players out before there's time to build adrenaline. But due to the huge scale of the fight, team Treasure Hunter would have ultimate damage boosters, massively OP aoe abilites such as corruption blast, potent defensive abilities to nullify getting focused, and soulsplit for general sustain.

Why would it have no negative range bonus if it’s using combat metal? 
---
no such thing
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/HrNTwqZ.png) is my gear and inventory setup. 
---
It's not a matter of preventing ranged damage - it's a matter of killing Zulrah extremely quickly with gear that heals (sanguinesti staff and the occassional blowpipe spec). Darkbow specs on the last hit of mage form when available speeds things up too. For reference, I have not hit a jad-phase in the last 200+ kills. But really the MVP here is the Sanguinesti staff - I usually don't heal above 70hp as the staff will often take care of that. Bastion potions + high def gear (arma), and rigour/augury also helps with tanking.
---
&gt;Its so much cheaper just to tele home reheal and tele back.
---
Cheaper is a misleading term here - you lose less of your own supplies but miss out on more kills. I just timed it, and a tick-perfect tab -&gt; pool -&gt; BJS fairy rings -&gt; run back to Zulrah is 35 seconds. My average kill time is 1 minute and 15 seconds, and each kill is ~110k. Assuming identical kill speeds, that means I'm getting another 1 kill for every 2.1 kills you get. On top of that I'm able to use 1 dose of antivenom for 2 kills you would get using the home teleport method. 
---
as much as i din't like the G.E update personally, it was definitely the beginning of all the great updates we have now

The other ones are easy but yes telekinetic alone is cancer. It's very easy as I didn't need any guide but it's just time consuming. They could have sped up the maze guardian instead of having us watch it take all day to move from one point to the other.

I've been doing some mid to high tier content lately and even for something like wintertodt brews are so nice. Brews are also cheap right now and with manta rays, dark crabs, and anglers at an affordable price sharks are just kinda meh right now. I never feel like I get value of of an inventory of sharks when I do something like vorkath or Zulrah. There are just better options. 
---
It would be far less of an issue if we didn't have an area of the game where content is shunted in there to drag PVMers, clue scrollers, skillers and so on in as sport for PKers. 
---
PVP is hard and the skill level required to survive is extremely high. This adds on to the fact that PVM gear is very much suboptimal versus the set up Pkers are running around in.

im not wrong

5th symphony?
---
230k or so
---
well what if spectral or arcane was absolute shit tier and no one used it for anything but it would still be 300 mil in the ge just because of it's alch price. That would be pretty dumb and useless huh? same thing with these bolts. Also, the cash dropping, that's a problem too. So onyx bolts only inflate coins and don't do anything useful? 
---
The reason why i don't think this way about other items like rune platebodies, is because I don't mind it. I think the cost and the value of what you are getting matches the ge price tag and the high alch value. You want a low level tank item? no problem 40-50k. The value is reasonable. The ge price doesn't match what onyx bolts do because they don't do enough for 9k thats why no one uses them. you can just use dragon bolts for more damage, or sharks for healing. why pay 9k to do something that you can do with other means for 10 times less. 
---
Where would you use it? anywhere you need healing. Armadyl. Pvp. Raids. venenatis osrs. fight caves, inferno. Dag kings. dmm. ect ect ect. Basically any place where you can't use pray to block 100% of the damage, you would want them. 
---
Id be genuinely curious to see a rs3 legacy vs osrs pvp fight (with the same gear on each side)

Not bad for so afk.

The Hydra tail rework. The item is currently useless and is at 300k active trade price, all the while being a 1/512 drop 
---
Sorry about that. What I mean is that I usually die very quickly after rapid bursts of damage from Zulrah without really getting to heal. After praying I take constant 20-30s, which I would then eat food (karambwans and mantas) but the food isn't really enough to save me and I die. I die very quickly, I usually have most of my food left when I go back to collect my items. I don't really think it's due to my stats (I have 75 def and 79 hp).

It is possible he doesnt have max gear on his main. Whereas you can have any gear you want on the unrestricted worlds
---
Eh, Dwarven rock cake can be 5 mins AFK or 20 mins AFK.
---
If you use the rock cake to get to 1 HP, then wait 5 minutes for the Overload to run out, your HP will be 6. If you fully used Absorbtion potions you would still have about 600 points of Absorption left which could give you a 30 seconds - 1 min grace period to re-Overload, asborp up, and rock cake down to 1 HP again. I can do all those actions with 14 clicks in a 5 second period. 
---
Getting to 1 HP, then using Super combat potions (so your HP doesn’t raise from Overloads) along with a full Absorption shield will allow you about a 20 minute AFK period. This requires over 25 clicks that can be done in around 15 seconds.
---
Note, however, that both my methods as well as the Prayer potion method offer different ways of achieving AFKscape at different levels of cost, attention, and XP gains.

The self control you have to not use them after ever task is amazing.

What you just said is dumb as shit.
---
A slightly simplified version of how the game works:
---
* Jmods write game scripts in their own language and make the engine run them. 
---
* The osrs game engine is where most of the game is. It waits for clients to connect so it can tell them what to display.
---
* The client is a user interface so people can interact with the game (duh). It takes data (from the server or cached) and displays it. It also takes input and sends it to the server. 
---
Graphical changes don't have anything to do with compatibility. The current client could send "clicked tree at this and this time" and the 2008 client probably sent exactly the same thing. 
---
Quick question was that like instantly when you started the fight? like did he pj you then you instantly 1 banged him

Warrior ring is more efficient than berserker ring for Vork. I can go into the maths if you want but i'm on mobile at the moment and it would be a pain to type out.

---
Wait until OP meets the Barrys.
---
Wintertodt
---
Prayer blocks 100% of damage from Zulrah itself so either you're praying incorrectly or it's simply ranging you in the mage phase, which can happen but since it maxes 40 you should be able to outeat it with manta+karambwan. Eat between phases to keep your HP high and watch out for ranged projectile during mage phase. 
---
holy fuck you're one miserable and sad person. Keep fighting the world, little man, nobody gives a shit about you, my PC baby

---
Don't know if this counts as QoL but I would love to see a slayer partner system rework. Currently unable to partner with a friend as his slayer level is lower than mine meaning it doesn't always give us tasks we can both do. 
---
I understand the reasoning behind the current system, but there must be a way to stop it being abused such as not giving full slayer points for completion of a task depending on your slayer level or something like this.
---
You get daxe too?
---
Ewwwh animation smoothing yuck
---
You shouldn't ever be stuck in a Venom Cloud, even with the shorter range of Blowpipe.  Eventually Zulrah will click for you where each spot is self explanatory, but focus on just running to the safe zones of each phase then adapting where you can attack her from the safe zones, making the learning more intuitive versus a guide.  One of the more jarring cycles is when Zulrah mid way in her total rotation swaps from Mage phase on the far right end back into Range phase that starts throwing out Venom Clouds from the middle.
---
I honestly suggest spending the time tanking Zulrah for a few runs, ignoring all guide help and not attacking her at all.  Focus purely on staying alive by eating up, praying correctly, and observing the flow of each phase and the setup/position you have to be in.  Everybody always fumbles and processes trying to kill her and while that may succeed for a bit, I feel it best to streamline learning everything by taking a step back, not attempting to kill her, and focus on only positioning.

I remember hanging out in seers bank when people first started saying "lmao" and i kept thinking people were calling each other "lame-o's". Took me a bit to figure that one out.

yeah same for me, in time to time i just go back to do a few kills for pet chance, i already gave up on mutagen drops after 3k kills fuck that
---
Woow
---
If you've done mm1 you maybe close to being able to do desert treasure. Bursting can be good methods to training.
---
You could also go to the method of Camelot teleport spamming or alching. Some people like to alch while training agility. 
---
I'd rather not even suggest it but there is also the very slow hut very afk method of splashing.
---
Try to look up a guide. I'm sure there's plenty of other methods than what I'm suggesting.

It's against TOS to buy or sell accounts. Doubt they'll do anything for you, might even ban the account you use to report it happened.

hes a scumbag who recovered and account where you knew the consequences of buying an account which is also against the rules? cool.

yes
---
Oh I'm sorry. I meant 400k+
---
Yeah. NOWHERE NEAR
---
yanno, i don't think its too much to ask.
---
how would your gear change if you had tbow? I've been doing zulrah with tbow only and kill speeds aren't as great as 1:15 average. Would you just switch the blowpipe for tbow? (while keeping blowpipe in inv for healing ofc)
---
Bro we’re talking about pking go home
---
Doubt anything will happen. You can attempt to report the person, howeverbyou fucked up because you bought the account. That's on you. 
---
The acc selling service can put add acc to blacklist but it’s karma on u for pullin that shit it’s against rules for a reason
---
If everything becomes easy to achieve then there wouldn't be anything respectable or worth working for in the game. You dont have to play efficiently if you dont want to, and I'm not arguing if the shield req was balanced or not. 
---
All I'm saying is you're not entitled to have everything unlocked if you dont work towards it. If inferno was made easier it would make the cape less prestigeous to have. Mmos thrive from having hard to obtain gear that lower level players get to work towards
---
Never got a pet or even a valuable drop over a million but I have recieved two big swordfishes. I have 67 fishing.

Is threes any way to practice against just 1 had on the tourney worlds besides going through the whole caves? The big rock looking fucker keeps 1-hitting me after I misclick my prayers

No

It was originally going to be 1m bait, but I really just can't be bothered to not be using the money at this point.

Go to the in game settings, find the icon that looks like a mouse then click it. That should turn on 1 click functionality.
---
Is there anyone who can carry me through a raid for the elite diary?

Moron. Can you at least try and read the question? I know i broke the rules. So did he. So i want his account banned.
---
Again That wouldn’t have happened if you looked lol
---
I believe pickpocketing HAM members it the best strat for easies
---
Probably. Depends on brand/model. Google how to do it for your laptop. Sometimes you do it through the BIOS/UEFI. Sometimes it's just a key-combo to turn it on/off. Sometimes you can use the manufacturer's pre-installed software.
---
Speed run tut island get on pvp world 1 hit?
---
Honestly, you might as well wait until you finish dragon slayer and get rune plate from the store. Getting a rune scim might be hard so the rune sword (level 40, the sword shop in varrock”) is the best until you get dragon scimitar (level 60, after Monkey Madness). Before then, Magic is usually better than melee, if you can afford the runes. The early armies aren’t really worth it.
---
How exactly do drops work specifically at vorkath? I have 1200 kills and haven’t gotten a drop. so my question would be can you add drops together. for example it’s like a .02 chance each kill for a visage, but do the odds stack?  what are the odds i get any one of the 5 rare drops from vork per kill instead of individual odds?
---
Why wouldn't they ban the account?
---
Since you can toggle off the warning when crossing the ditch I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to toggle off the obelisk teleport either.
---
Good job to that guy! :)

Well it's honestly a completely different game with completely different trends and mechanics.

Why is the hard er version of the n word not censored? Racism isn’t cool. But I can’t talk about what video I spanked it to on pornhub because that gets censored. In all seriousness I say this because when you say pornhub, no matter if you do or do not have filter on,  it will automatically censor it. Can we make the “n” word be the same? Just amazes me because as a kid playing I couldn’t say @$$ without getting a mute. 
---
Oh nah my prayer grind was a while ago :)
---
At least they did sometime when you reached out lol
---
sure thing dude
---
Get this shit onto Runelite asap
---
Consider yourself lucky... Otherwise you'd have been ice barraged for an extended period of time before (and if) we were finally able to kill you.
---
Found you, fucker. You're still wrong.
---
Please. This would be the coolest update ever!
---
ShareX is becoming less useful as more apps allow for direct image pasting. I know the for Facebook and Discord you can win+shift+s, crop a selection and directly paste that into FB/Discord to upload it there
---
welp, I'm just gonna grind all my f2p quests for the time being
---
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I'll have to keep practicing to figure out what to do.
---
It's definitely hard to do with only 83 ranged and 84 mage, but I'm slowly getting there. A death here and there sucks but I'm slowly making money. I'll have to grind out elite void and 71 agility here soon.
---
Thanks again!
---
Alrighty welp, I'm going to grind my f2p quests (i havn't completed one lmao)
---
Why wouldn’t he do barb, at least to like 90? Shits been out since actual 2007.
---
Always have to pray what its sptting at you. If its mage phase tank the range hits worst case scenario you get b2b2b 40's like I did. Depending on rotation you should always stay ahead of zulrah prayer wise. Example would be in the beggining of the fight you pray nothing but would pray range or mage and nothing for melee since you can dodge it. 
---
I lurk on this sub for the memes lmao.
---
Venezuelan goldfarmer here.
---
didnt get axe tome or pet from 50-99 personally. 
---
What else would you use? A ward or the shield with negative ranged bonus?
---
I have a weird one. I remember a guy saying he'd give his account away. So I was like nice,  free stuff. Maybe his stats are better than mine. So I asked for his password, since he was giving his account. 
---
Came back to a ban the next day. Thank God for chat logs showing he was just baiting people to report them. 
---
That's a good goal. You'll need most of them later if you're going to go p2p anyways and they give good rewards.
---
You win some, and you lose some. Mostly just lose.
---
Of course there's RS in the afterlife. Something something 72 virgins.
---
This. Glad you’re being upvoted because it’s true as hell and people are so salty about it.
---
Now? It's max 20min afk with guthans vs a few years ago 6h afk so yeah, still a bit afk but they have nerfed it quite much.
---

---
I am currently preparing to complete dragon slayer 2 tomorrow (today) on my birthday.
---
In other words.., yes. I have, and it feels great!
---
I was a little burned doing farm runs, so I was playing RS3 a little last week. The only people I saw in the wild were training divination or killing players there. As a skiller: If you die you just lodestone back and you lose nothing. As a pker: you say ez and jerk off your nub that you killed an afk earning nothing.
---
It was weird and I'll never go back, it was mind numbing.
---
Devalues my crooked inventory icon only Ironman.
---
Quality 
---
I like having my pot tab like this. When I PK I use a single antifire and antidote to negate those effects. Or if i need a quick run I’ll sip a stamina instead of using my house pool. Things like that. We have 800 spaces maybe just clean your bank in other spots. 
---
Why would he do the same thing again? And in the same place? Seems pretty pointless unless I'm missing something
---
Also, tbf, literally all of their points are valid...  i dont know much about osrs wildy PVP, but in rs3, it isnt at all PVP, but just griefers preying on people.  I havent seen an actual PVP fight in years in rs3 and I've gone to the wildy for skilling for 2 99s and training some other skills
---
There are no safe locations in the wilderness? Okay so a monster attacks you, and you're 126, its going to hit you 100 zeros, but the first time it hits something, its going to be a 1. There's virtually ZERO risk right there. The wilderness will NOT be safer, its an intended buff towards pkers. PvMer puts this necklace on, runs through agro mobs, PKer equips amulet to not get hit off by mobs, and now has the ability to kill said PvMer.
---
In what way will this affect the economy? Your argument is stupid and not very realistic. 
---
whats the joke?
---
All of these are amazing ideas
---
Yeah see again, making an artificial 500 pt block is not the answer. They should NOT be on slayer tables to start with. They should be an optional 50pt unlock. 
---
Thank you, I appreciate the positive feedback!
---
Just wanna add this is with blowpipe. With dhcb it's not worth to spec.
---
this sentence is almost as long as theirs lol
---
I'd be down for that
---
!remindme 7 days
---
Used the deep-fry wand 
---
No problem :)
---
Very cute! I like her style
---
So now that you killed 500k infernal eels on that account, what’s next?
---
The only way you can get banned is if you are constantly trading kills with yourself or another player.  It would have to be a manual report and ban so don't worry about it unless you are actually trading kills.
---
waste of inventory.
---
reddit primarely consists out of people that can't get a regular firecape in general.
---
the chat censor only applies to websites. profanity filter is there if you want it
---
It's almost certainly just going to be more infernal eels. I might eventually do other skills, but probably not for a while. I'd like to finish my bossing goal first I think.
---
90 rc AND murder mystery. That'll show em
---
Sounds logical
---
Got my beaver at level 13 lolol
---
Yes. See their website. 
---
We can do more... Rat catchers!
---
Noob question,
---
What is the name of the armor
---
I see it sometimes but I don’t know anything about it
---
OoOoOoOOHhOHhhhHhh the precious inventory slot
---
Seriously. WTF is up with the rotation images? Sometimes a phase wll come out of nowhere or be completely different, or some weird behavior will happen that I wasn't expecting.
---
I've given up on Zulrah for now. Unrestricted worlds help, but when I'm consistently killing *Vorkath* faster and with fewer difficulties than Zulrah, something is wrong.
---
This is the one. I hate that huge chat bar. 
---
Kurasks are a great place to camp forever. Solid, stackable loots with alchs and the xp is not bad. 70 slayer required. 
---
Link? 
---
Oh the humanity! Next you'll slap on 21 cooking and a brown apron. Might as well max first at that rate
---
i expect to see a "loot from 100 hours of killing giant bats in wildy" post from you soon, don't let me down
---
Why? I'm sorry, but it's my understanding that it's our responsibility to protect the minors under our care. Why in the world does anyone expect the woman dumb enough to think ISIS was a good idea to withstand the kind of systematic brainwashing and terror tactics that commonly break soldiers.
---
Nobody's saying she's a gem but I prefer a government to protect all of its citizens equally. Even the dumb ones.
---
Ah a fellow monster hunter I see. 
---
Something something "bring profit to wildy to lure in players", except nobody is going to do skilling with full PK gear and inventory.
---
It only made it that even naked skillers have more wealth on them than the average PK dude. Honestly who would one rathee kill? The effortless kill on a skiller for X loot, or a potentially risky engagement for fraction of that?
---
The logic behind the idea how wildy was planned to be revitalized is brainlet-tier.
---
big maths ;)
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---

lolololol fake post

no runescape player has a girlfriend.

I had to go through 3 treatments of chemotherapy a few years back &amp; I put my heart and soul into OSRS for 30 hours that week every day that I had treatment. I played so much to disappear from the crap that for a few weeks after I was done with my cancer Runescape made me nauseous. Thankfully that’s all in the past now.
---
Marrying a terrorist and popping out his kids isn't against the Geneva convention. Crime against common sense. But this idiot doesn't deserve to die for it.
---
Ahhh, a fellow lactose intolerant!
---
Did you atleast get your double xp?
---
This has been suggested many times. Don't think they were a fan of it
---
You’ll get pkd for your bank eventually multiple times, not eager to watch that happen tbh
---
Fuck me, what age are you? 3?
---
Gz to you as well :)
---
I feel like people don’t understand that “moderate buffs” aren’t moderate if they’re increasing it by 20-25%. 
---

---
Underrated
---
Dont think these are unpopular but:
---
there shouldn't be any fightcaves helper just like inferno, you shouldn't be able to buy fire cape with any gold, ingame or not. 
---
Wilderness shouldn't be rejuvenated by bringing pvmers in to kill rather by creating a good incentive to pk (money or mebe a pet)
---
Some updates like not halfing entagles on pray mage should be implemented without a poll
---
Streamer and YouTubers shouldn't be able to ask people to vote for what they want, by all means talk about it but not do what sparc mac did with divine.
---
I don't think I like the diary req.
---
Having oziach assist you in making the anti-dragon kiteshield post DS1 sounds very cute and thematic to me, putting it more akin to dragon hasta's fixing.
---
Ironmen have a reputation of being elitist. When you say something that can be interpreted as elitist it will, even if you didnt mean it like that. "peak autism" has pretty much become the default reaction to any ironman elitism so yeah, thats why I guess. 
---
ironman btw &gt; peak autism lul is kind of a default skit at this point
---
Pride and accomplishment?
---
rs3 would win sadly assuming same skill, because they've been secretly buffing legacy damage/accuracy every now and then so it can keep up with Eoc,  also special attack accuracy for RS3 scales up to attack/magic/range level  
---
but not sure how the stats /accuracy would translate to each other since defense/accuracy for Rs3 is at a flat rate for the most part
---
i once went into fat nooblet's stream and said he looked like a bean that had the sauce washed away and i feel bad to this day
---
I mean, I play with others on my ironman too, I just don't trade with them.
---
Please no, it buffs my neck-trauma-only ironan too much
---
Just go camp kurasks/nechs/gargoyles for a few hours and you will easily get it back.  Also might want to change pass, use a bank pin and authenticator. 
---
I see racism, I upvote 
---
It really isn't that simple I've tried this before and they just surge as well and for some reason they have something that drains you energy to nothing so you won't be getting away. 
---
Cool idea, but I dont think a flat increase to skill success isnt the best idea, since it lacks activity in my opinion. Instead, maybe have it so having the prayer active has a chance to spawn in "boosted" resource zones which give you resources faster, kinda like the "rockortunities" in the mining rework in rs3. These zones can jump around, so you can get increased xp as long as you pay attention. Prayer flicking should definitely not be a thing for these prayers. I like the idea of an upfront prayer cost like someone else mentioned, for example drain 3 prayer points when clicked but you gain the effects for 30 seconds.
---
D:
---
What do you thinks the best?
---
Oh damn I guess I might have missed my week but here goes.
---
Lunar tan leather doesn't work on snake hide. Maybe simple code glitch?

What a stupid post
---
Aw, I’m glad that she supports you and drew this for you :)
---
Sounds like you’re a little butt hurt that you lost probably $100+. Lmao they aren’t gonna help you bud 
---
It’s like amethyst mining, super slow xp and bad mediocre gp/hr (19k xp/h and 288k go/h at 99 mining), but really afk and perfect for an alt. Although Rune Dragon alts have ruined skilling alts potential, since those are 2m/h with the Lance.
---
F
---
its runescape 3 
---
I think your photoshop caught aids 
---
Swampday idiot
---
probably because rs3 pvp is dog shit    
---
   
---
rs3 isnt even a bad game but the pvp is so bad
---
good idea
---
Outfit gives exp boost so might as well do it now, pick a tv show you don’t have to look at to enjoy because you gotta be staring at your screen, do 20 at a time with the wiki method, bring humidify and stam pots if you want
---
Pking is such a big part of the game to alot of veterans and so many people would quit if it was removed. Its the idea of a super dangerous arena with great reward. If jagex didn't want to make pvp changes it wouldn't have pvp as a part of its game.
---
yeah 50-99 netted about 900k cash and 4.6m in mats on a fresh account. 
---
The last one 100%. The amount of time i wasted gearinging up and getting my inventory all set up to realize i forgot something like a prayer scroll and i have to rebank to deposit one item to take out the item to equip it to bank again to fill in the one spot. Would be very helpful
---
gives pvpers a reason to do herbs from time to time, has my vote
---
&gt; Nobody is buying bulks of logs **right now** to firemake
---
Sigh.. I'm pretty sure I was clear enough, especially in my other comments. I am not talking about the skill **right now** I am talking about when it was released. 
---
&gt; You can't say "is a necessity" and then say how "back in the day" it was useful. Literally don't need levels 2 to 99 fm to burn a log.
---
You do realize that I am talking about a completely different period, right? A period where Jagex's mindset was completely different than it is today. Jagex admitted that they never even expected anyone to reach high levels when the game (with Firemaking included) was released.
---
Maybe, in retrospect, it was a mistake from Jagex to release Firemaking as its own skill. Given the lack of options you can do with Firemaking as a concept. At the end of the day it is just about making a fire. You don't create something new to use or sell.
---
&gt; that's like a 500k risk by default.
---
500k rs3 gold? isn't that like 50k os? not much of a risk
---
Because they're bots. 
---
I believe that's the joke.
---
Speaking of which, can not find that last crab rave video to save my life, anybody know what happened to it? 
---
For pros you forgot that it means you wouldn’t even need to open a browser tab to beat one out. 
---
This is the way, doing one at a time felt like a waste and I said fuck it I'll do it live.
---
Had 70kc by the end of the day.
---
Basically the biggest advice is that you don't have to be on an exact tile UNLESS it's melee phase, just be in the right area. Also, it usually has you running back and forth from one wide to the other with some small differences depending on phase. Oh and west side jad starts ranged, east starts mage.
---
Yea I know the efficient ways cause I watch too many youtube vids and twitch streams but I play for fun non efficient myself. :P
---
This design doesn't seem practical to me. I thought that the Anti-Dragon Shield was designed to cover the entire front of your body to protect you from dragonfire. With this design the shield seems a lot shorter, especially at the bottom. 
---
Or make mining certain ores have a small chance to give you a antidragonore piece, combine 10 pieces with dragon shield on smithing anvil for sweet smithing xp. This way, mining has a nice little money added
---
You can now yeah

welp, you just confirmed it. rc is literally ruining my mental health.

C Engineer

HCIM but PVP worlds only - "PVP but HCIM" - also has a self-imposed bounty that raises over time if you kill him(at 250M right now)
---
He also pulled a big brained bait and switch by renaming his pure to "PVP but HICM" or some such and counter PK'd people going after him. Funny stuff
---
I don’t -_-
---
I didn’t think OSRS was associated with Facebook? 
---
Def quests for b gloves (in case you ever decide to get a pair), heavy ballista, veng and ancients. Those are the necessities . After that you can decide I'd you want to get other stuff like avas assembler, God books etc
---
He’s absolutely double whooshing you 
---
Your a brainwashed Leftist. It was a calculated decision on her part. Not a dumb mistake. She knew what she was doing. She names her child after a jihad warlord. This is only recently. You think she has good intentions? She helped murder a lot of people. She has caused so much suffering.
---
But somewhere in your messed up mind you think that it's a dumb mistake? Shoplifting is a dumb mistake. Joining a terrorist organisation is fucking beyond a dumb mistake. 
---
Our government doesn't treat our citizens equally. Your brainwashed if you believe so. Everyone with a Brain knows that Muslims get special treatment. Even discussing letting her back in proves so. Along with the thousands of different examples.

Your brainwashed.

Not having the GE was sick the first month or 2. I was all for never adding the GE. eventually the nostalgia went away and you then realize NOT having the GE is objectively bad. So much scamming, getting random items needed for quests sucked. spending multiple hours trying to just get items or sell item eventually was just super boring.
---
Oh no. I think I meant 83. For max house

Yeah... that is definitely... icing... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

You can use an abillity in rs3 wich makes prayers 100% for 10 sec and it ads 5 secs after a succesfull kill up to 25 secs i believe :p

hopefully if they do try and give her citizenship or any other actual terrorists, that theres a riot. im never usually one for putting someone in a position where theyre probably going to be murdered, but she chose to join a terrorist organization. quite frankly she should be executed for treason. i agree it was fucking disgusting there was even  a  debate, you can get worse punishments for stealing a loaf of bread.
---
No it won't. It is the one keeping it alive. If we didn't have those people then RC would already be afk and 100k xp/h. Also the casual players will quit way before the hardcore efficiency people will, so that group definitely keeps the game alive.
---
Well.. im mostly an rs3 player myself. But i play a good bit of 07 to and i must say that my first tribrid fight went better than al my fights between 06 and 12 lol. So idk if its me but because i have so much keybinds for rs3 i find 07 overhead tribridding not that hard to handle :p
---
You're obviously too pea-brained to realize this but OSRS is a sinking ship and we're all on it. It's not gonna last forever but by keeping things challenging it might last a bit longer before tards like you turn it into RS3.
---
Or people don't actually give two fucks about Reddit and leave it, because who looks at the number of comments and really feels the need to say something?
---
That’s ok 
---
Drop your trousers, Lower your underwear (don't drop it to your legs) and pee standing up.

There is a mini game called warbands. Its every 7 hours. There are pking clans there and there are some solo pkers aswell. It has had its best years but its still kinda fun. 3 years ago we had huge wars every 7 hours but now it mostly edge 1v1's. Its realy engaging and punishing because if you get stunned at the wrong time you get 1 ticked pretty eazy :p if you want you can watch it on youtube some ppl upload rs3 pk vids.
---
Having a debate is far from disgusting.  All factors need to be considered.
---
Stripping someone of their citizenship for whatever reason sets a very dangerous precedent.  That said, I don't feel she should get away with what she did.  
---
It's a tough one.

---
i understand and i would probably come to the same conclusion based on those few comments. i just wasnt interested in what was going on in his video, i thought that it was way too slow, and i dont like his voice. settled's videos are very compact and fast-paced and imo show exactly what people want to see without wasting anyone's time. obviously his videos are extremely popular and it's because they're well made and engaging

I already have 50k monkfish banked and I need a new super AFK activity.

Not everything is for every one. There's a reason Settled has 100k+ and this guy has 5k subs. I was just sharing a smaller creator I liked that I had assumed a large number of people hadn't seen yet  All good if it's not for you :)

Sheep herder ;_;

Why the 50 agility then

Barrow gloves can help with non void pking too since he will have 42 def it will allow him to tribrid with rune/d hide/ mystics as well for example if he wants to go deep wildy pking.

Go on, puss, kill that rat!

Nice! I got my phoenix on my first kc. Whats the chance on that?
---
hey no harm in that and for the record i dont actually watch swampletics because i dont find it very entertaining
---
Revs are a fun place to pk with no real skill! Get a couple spec weps and just go have fun. If anything it’s fun watching everyone have to run around and then reset. 
---
About time... 
---
Derp swamplectics derp.
---
It depends which way you're approaching it.
---
Herb runs are mainly used for profit and the XP is meh. Since they're also a low grow time, it means you spend most of the "in-game time" running to each patch to do them. However, if you do them alongside allotments (obviously same areas as Herbs), then allotments end up being crazy high XP.
---
If you're approaching it from a purely "in-game time", then trees and fruit trees are your best bet (albeit a money loss), as the runs are quick, high XP and infrequent.
---
TL;DR: Want to save money? - incorporate herb runs. Got better things to do and just want XP? - Do just tree and fruit tree.
---
it's a reference to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/asel65/suggestion_could_the_legguards_be_rotated_a_bit/) making fun of how pixelated and poorly edited it was
---
Fruit trees man. Start doing 4 fruit trees a day and you'll have 40 farming in no time. Minimal effort. Use a few oak trees to get to level 27 so you can do apple trees.
---
This is my run:
---
Items: 4 saplings, axe, law runes, air runes/air staff/smoke staff, Ardougne cloak 1+ and 30 gp. (If you haven't yet, bring some compost buckets, rake and a spade to store at tool gnome.) Also bring fire runes if you wanna go back to GE after.
---
Start at Grand Exchange, use the spirit tree (North East of GE) to Gnome Stronghold and go east a bit a bit. Rake the grass, plant the sapling and use compost on the patch.
---
Go back to spirit tree and go to tree gnome village. Leave tree gnome village and follow the gnome at the other side of the fence to the end of the maze (right click, follow Elkoy).
---
Then go South West a bit and use that patch. 
---
Then teleport to Camelot and walk to east Catherby to use the patch there. Use the map if you need to locate it.
---
Then use the Ardougne cloak to monastery teleport and north east to the docks and pay the guy to fare to Brimhaven. Then go south west for the last patch.

I think theres a bit of a difference between a dumb citizen and someone maliciously choosing to leave the country and support a direct enemy of the state
---
but thats just my opinion 
---
Wtf? 
---
&gt; Does it have *any* influence?
---
Yes it does, but it's hard to say how significant it is. 
---
Perhaps you could do the maths yourself (chapter 5 at http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?317,318,712,65587452) and tell the results?
---
Gz. Only 2 lvls till 99 myself but i decided to do bloods to 99 cause the rune to the altar is way more afk than souls.
---
I remember hearing this weird rumor from a friend that fletching was coming to f2p skill. So i quickly panicked and started chopping all trees, stacking like 200 normal logs, around 500 oak logs and about 400 willow logs to  be prepared for it. It never came. :(

If you go to rimmington you will see a deck there and the cabin boy is on it!

Dont have to think something that's been proven through studies..

You don't.

You need to get your strenght up if you want to pk in f2p

Yes i just need an jmod to help me do you know a jmod who helps ppl with this kind of problems

How does that even work - you need a ton of stats to even access Elf.

Yeah thats true haha its more laziness than ignorance though.

Why is getting two zenytes in a slayer tadk reddit post worthy lol

Update the mobile app for the new ipads. Currently there is black bars around the edge. 
---
I miss it just finished 99 At high hp. I went in max pray like dragonbone necklace devout boot if no pyro set etc. Regen bracelet with rapid restore prayer. 5-10 wines I get maybe 3-4 crates bank and get another 5-10 with runes for house tp when those wines are out. Pray runs out around then and this was way more chill for me
---
That's more of a personal problem though. People wont risk their pets deliberately to pay to get them back because it's money down the drain, the initial cost to insure them ensures that if they lose them, it costs to get it back. 
---
Sure, it'd be great to walk around with a pet in an area where you have the possibility to lose it and to not pay to get it back but then that would also imply that things like rune pouches, serp helm recolours, void would all have no time-risk (the time it takes to get the item) to get get back, devaluing the item/ pet in the first place. 
---
You risk the item because you want to and you pay the price, with the aforementioned of gold-sinks for gold stability. 
---
Excuse the noob question, but what kind of things are high def?

Good bot, then

Reddit isn't the go-to place to get your account back; you need to go through the support site which you can find on the homepage.

To compare it to American politics is a bit of an extreme, but I do agree that it's human nature to follow the masses.

---
Yeah I used to play with negative efficiency back in the day. Spending days on Pest Control and Castle Wars, only training skills I found to be fun like construction and smithing even when they were expensive and kinda useless. 
---
Now I'm finally trying to get a high level account for once and even unlocking things I wasn't able to get before like some easy 99s, d def, slayer helmet, fighter torso etc and like some higher req quests is whats giving me the most fun now. Its different for everyone.

Pking in armour in f2p results in both of you just hitting 0, and without a high strength you'll never KO anyone anyway

Herbiboar is fun too, getting 100k - 150k per hour depending on level

It's borrowed from the werewolf agility course, where you're supposed to use your teeth to hold on in order to blend in with the werewolves.

Between this and the "pole vault" from the canifis rooftop, I agree some changes should be made.

Literally noone anywhere hides poll results. In most countries the goverment!/president is elected by people raising their hands and then they just count. 
---
Varrock personally. 
---
Acts as a prospector body and the daily discounted battlestaffs. (If you’re an iron helps a bit) if not its a free 100~k a day. 
---
Varrock elite gives you a daily ~120k in battlestaffs, so that's normally a good priority; and the money you spend on herblore for the requirement slowly pays itself off; and you dont have to get the prospector's top from MLM
---
Desert elite is also very helpful if you decide you want to mitigate the cost of construction by substituting the pool for the statue you pray at, at the expense of a few seconds running to it.
---
Lumbridge elite is the best for getting around in terms of a Fairy ring w/o using the dramen staff if you don't have a POH fairy ring.

All down to your preference and what you find more useful.

Does the streak continue btw?

I hear you but don’t expect jagex to spend their time on chat filter since most of us who play are adults. Not sure how to feel... most people who’d say it are I think being obnoxious on purpose to get a laugh or reaction. From a professional standpoint though lol hard to defend this if I were jagex

Fremmink, kourend, and western province are pretty important

Heavily depends on the gear and levels. I get 2.2m on my main but only 1.5 on my 90 base CMB stats alt, both with Lance. Lance makes the difference

He’s an Ironman that locks himself to mortania. His goal is to do theatre of blood. He spends insane amounts of time trying to do all this stuff that would take a normal person 5-10 minutes lol. It’s really cool. He does a really good job editing the videos too. Definitely worth watching
---
You need to be patient. If you have proof of ownership for the account then you should get it back.
---
I’m tasked with 100+ lesser demons at 79 combat... not worth it.

Jagex should see that i allways played at my own ip adress and my email untill it got changed

You can already buy most of things as iron. Anything you can't buy you shouldn't consider basic gear.

I think a miniquest would be cool too

If they let her raise the child it will grow up as a Jihad. And that child will cause a lot of suffering someday. She has no remorse for what she did. She believe's killing innocent people in Syria is a good thing. She named her child after a Jihad Warlord from the 1300s if my history is correct. Named after a Murder, Rapist, Pedo, Torturer. It's like a German calling their kid Hitler. 
---
That is the issue. The child is destined to be a Jihad if they let that woman raise it.

I have base 70s in melee stats and I’ve found it to be a much easier and faster task to just whip them (can’t afford zammy spear). Maybe give it a try next time. Also gz on the drop! I’ve had quite a few metal dragon tasks and no luck yet.

:D

Zam did win The God Wars...

Oh you're just a troll I see. :)

I don't understand why people get mad at others being happy with their achievements. I was happy when I got 99 cooking, sorry for not spending 3000 hours doing RC.

Now this is a loot post i care about
---
Does dfs require diaries? No
---
Ags? No
---
Claws? No
---
Bandos chest? No
---
Climber boots? No.
---
Stop typing so goddamn much. 
---
Diaries feel so underwhelming it's kinda sick. Level 90 Herblore, 63 Magic, 95 Cooking, 89 Smithing, etc, etc. ALL FOR 60 BATTLE STAVES? 100K A DAY? You make that in 10 minutes anywhere else, 3 minutes at zulrah. Acts as a prospector top? Yeah who the fuck cares, it's an elite diary, presumably you'll have the fucking prospector top already from the MEDIUM FALADOR DIARY.
---
What the hell
---
Instead of doing herbs for money I just wouldn’t do trees to balance that out. Calquat mahogany/teak redwood celastrius and palms are cheap as hell right now
---
I use it there too, but the DPS is very slightly less than a fire cape. 
---
That's fair. I think the fun part for me is seeing how far I can take it before that happens, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. 
---
Auto retaliate 
---
They shape the game in ways that is undesirable and discourages new players from staying. 
---
He was added with fossil island, still a long time though
---
I'll add mine: birdhouses kind of ruined the hunter skill. What was made as a way of making the early levels of hunter less annoying is now a way of getting 99 hunter without ever actually doing it. 
---
The UK is on the verge of going on Riots as it is. If we get a Deal in Brexit then the Country will be in chaos. Just like France. The unrest is massive in Holland, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Sweden as well. We are on the verge of a European wide civil war but the Media is doing a great job censoring it. Heck there is many people that don't even believe the Riots in France are happening? Rioting against the french Government and the European Union
---
But even debating letting this Jihad back has fueled the fire. In just over a month Britain will turn to riots if we get a Deal in Brexit.
---
Too specific to be made up. 
---
If it's not such a big deal then that means there's shouldn't be a reason not to.
---
The stats tho..
---
Ags require diaries? No.
---
Climber boots? No
---
Addy kite? No
---
Dragonfire shield? No
---
Some random level 30 addy kite anti dragon shield should require diaries why???? What the fuck???
---
I’m pretty sure it’s tomorrow..
---
Not only does it have icing on it, but it also has the jam inside it.
---
Medium clues dont go in wildy
---
As an ironman, i approve. As a main, I would not even post here, becouse they can buy a dfs, and they should not ruin this for ironmen. Sorry, if I insulted the majority here, but seriously, why would you want this as a main? Cosmetics? 
---
Impressive man
---
owo
---
You‘re an idiot, have you read what other people said? It‘s to prevent bots from farming dragons. It‘s just a fucken diary what kind of loser are you that you wouldn‘t be able to do it
---
Hand trained :')
---
oh ok, makes sense then
---
Why would you use addy kiteshield when you could use rune kiteshield?
---
att and str potions are like 5gp each at warriors guild. Use them every task on my IM

I poop squatting on the toilet.
---
Its so much easier and how we're supposed to poop anyway.
---
Yes i put my feet on the bowl. Wish we had those japanese floor toilets 
---
I think doing tree/fruit trees is going to be my approach and accept it as a sunk cost and i'll make it for it over time with RC leveling and bossing/slayer
---
I always thought it was funny dismissing events and doing this animation at MLM.
---
So lets make literally everything require a diary when 0 old content requires diaries no fuck that. 
---
Yeah there is a offical fb page its verified so dont fall for any frauds
---
Fucken retard pepega

If it removes hardcore status then sure
---
Looking forward to your next post. Good luck!
---
Only took 34 kills but I finally got it :D
---
So don’t do them?
---
This might actually be a good move. Why? Because the Edgeville furnice is completely overrun by 'suicide' bots. As of this time, there are probably around 1000 active bots smithing cannonballs 24/7. This results in over 2M smithed cannonballs every single hour (400M gp). Buffing the speed making them and locking it behind the proper diary would kill these bots completely.

I  fell for it because OSRS is celebrating 6 years and I thought that was because of that!
---
I can't argue with that. I guess that the reason I'm even bringing this up is because I don't see the point in pets, other than prestige... and I'm not a prestigious type of person/player, even though I do like the look of some pets. So because I don't want to have to pay to retrieve my pet if I die, I'll just stick all of my pets in my POH and forget they even exist... which kinda brings me back to the original question of "What's the point." This could go on and on, but never mind.

I never click any RuneScape related links on any websites other then the official RuneScape website and 2007scape Reddit.. this subreddit has lots of restrictions that prevent the posting of malicious links for the most part, because it is specifically moderated in such a way. sites like Instagram and Facebook don't give a rat's ass about account security when it comes to RuneScape. Those websites will be flooded out the ass with fishing links

Self catheter, empty catheter bag once a day. Never use a bathroom for pissing again. 
---
For real though, I did this once on a road trip to Montana where I was extremely pressed for time and basically had to drive straight through, no stops but for gas. I figured the amount of energy drinks I'd be pounding down for this 24 hour drive would not line up with the amount of gas stations I'd be able to hit. So I cath'd myself and it was pretty fucking weird. Just be driving along and all of a sudden get a weird sensation and hear it trickling into the bag and then sweet relief. 
---
Putting the cath in doesn't hurt, but I totally underestimated the pain from pulling it out. 5/7 would do again. 
---
For those wondering, yeah cathing people is part of my job so I am trained in doing so. Perfectly safe.

It's Swampletics, my morytania region locked ultimate iron man my dudes
---
I think he's trolling everyone. He has got a drop but not showing it. I want him to show his barrows collection log
---
That makes sense, yeah.
---
Lets be entirely fair, lots of the diaries have great rewards. You've picked one that specifically is quite underwhelming when compared to stuff like Kourend (infinite konar teleports, wear non-brimstone boots in dungeon, better RC exp and slayer points), western (infinite pisc teleports, zulrah revive, more slayer points from Nieve allowing for different tasks without sacrifising points), or Lumbridge (extra block spot, no more dramen staff). 
---
They're QOL unlocks.

Rune Essence dropped hard. I got my money back and stopped investing.
---
So I switched to Mithril Arrows recently. Bought at 32gp, and it dropped quick to 25gp. I predict it will keep going down.
---
I got some money back on the arrows, but not much.
---
I will let it sit at 32gp sell until it goes back up. I have 200k banked I can live with.

what? lumbridge hard is easy, elite is the hard one. hard doesnt even have high requirements

also ironmen probably wont have a dfs

Yeah. Im quite fucked now. Will not click on them ever again
---
What a weird setup

Of course! Your site taught me zulrah, least I could do. 65kc bp and 165 kc serp btw btw lol. Unfortunately also 3 crystal seeds, 4 dhallies, and an onyx too..

Against the European Union. Influx of illegal migrants. The rape and murder from those migrants. The usual. But the media censors it.

&gt;remove Theatre of Blood from the Mini games teleport list

RIP swampletics
---
Just gonna pitch my piece in as well as say Lumbridge. Given that you'll get the quest cape along the way (meaning you can teleport to the Legends' Guild), you'll have easy access to a fairy ring at any time, which you won't need a staff to use.
---
I also like the Morytania one for the full exp bonecrusher, extra herb patch and extra slayer exp in the slayer tower.
---
Personally, after getting Lumbridge done, look at the skill reqs/rewards for each diary, then set your sights on which one you wanna do next, then focus on that.
---
Varrock is nice to have for the 120 battlestaves, but requires things like 89-95 cooking as well as 85-90 herblore (boosted+non-boosted levels), so it can have a somewaht high barrier to entry.
---
Hide his question from sick nerd
---
Be careful that poop doesn’t miss the urinal. Stick dick between legs and point it towards your ass so you can poop and pee while standing at the same time. When ur done pull ur big boy pants up and flush, try to finesse poop down drain by smooshing with hand if having hard time
---
Can we just click the plants in tithe farm to water them rather than clicking the watering can and then the plant?  I recently got the outfit on my main and just got the seed box on my uim and was thinking about grabbing the outfit as well after I finish construction but that place ass.

Your argument insinuating that everyone in the wilderness is a 126 is also stupid and unrealistic. 
---
NMZ made all other combat training except slayer worthless.
---
should the game be balanced around casual players who only want to afk? People who pay less attention, should gain less experience. This concept is not something that should be hard to understand. A person doing afk methods does not deserve the same benefits as someone using tick manipulation methods.

Bots using twitch prime.
---
Sounds like satire tbh
---
if there wasn't so many bots then the price would rise, and then normal players would do them again

the only reason "without bots the economy would fail" is a thing is because we are dependant on them, but give it a month without them and it will slowly balance itself

No, I’m saying that just because you think you’re in the majority, doesn’t mean you are. And that whether you are in the majority or not, it isn’t a valid point to argue from. Ad populum my friend.

We don’t want a price increase of coal. It would lead to more botting of coal which would then lower it and thus lower the price of gold. Even then so the is literally no one who wants this is game. All it does is change prices and mess up the economy because OP is too lazy to do shit.

Well regarding my first point click precision in short periods of time requires skill. Hence why making larger spellbook sizes a lower skill ceiling.

---
I'm most certainly not "losing the argument", you're simply choosing to ignore what i said. My points stand:
---
The difference of click precision between a small icon and a still-small-but-slightly-larger icon has no real variation in skill, and click precision is a low skill ceiling to begin with. Your example doesn't change that.
---
Having resizable/filterable spellbooks nowhere in the game is worse game design than having it everywhere but PvP.
---
When you have a legitimate argument to that, let me know. Until then, you're still an asshole with your fingers in your ears pretending not to hear the truth.
---
yes because it's a proven fact.
---
Not bots xD just afks
---
Youre actually incorrect on that. Slayer helm + glory/fury/torture is more dps than neit + salve. You lose a huge amount of str bonus using a salve, so its only worth using on vork tasks.

Why not just have a Font Of Rune effect at CW where you can cast any spell but not get up for it?
---
You lose a fair bit of points (which are essentially gp in the long-long-term) for being under 115 CB, so that is technically the minimum.

Didn’t they make like one official post in the past about how there would never be double xp for osrs and then they just left it at that?

rune dragons make around 1.5m an hour when the account is finished. You can also use it for more things like doloing gwd bosses. While you are making the account you can always utilise it for making money with other ways like green dragons.

Exactly. You could make it part of cooking, which is already a fast skill. Maybe not give any cooking xp when lighting a fire but bonus xp for cooking on one you made. Jigger teir log gives higher bonus. 
---
I didn't say it wasn't skillful at all. I said it was a low skill ceiling, and that a small increase in icon size to fill the spellbook and make it look a little nicer aesthetically doesn't affect the level of skill required to click on said icon (which by the way you still have no rebuttal to). After a few hours, most people can pick it up. I say this as one of those people who it didn't take long at all to pick this game up. This is a direct result of the tick-based combat: once you have the tick rhythm down, it's not difficult to perform multiple actions within a tick.
---
RuneScape as a whole is a fairly low skill ceiling game. That doesn't mean it's not fun, but clicking a couple of icons definitely isn't hard, especially compared to other PvP type games out there. It's probably safe to assume you're one of those veterans who have played since RuneScape first released? I hate to break it to you, but games have come a long, LONG way since then, even in just the last 5 years. If you want to experience a high skill ceiling game, you should take a break from OSRS. Try out Albion Online, it's a similar concept to RuneScape but with a much higher skill ceiling. Not only are you clicking to control your character and activate things, you have to coordinate your mouse movement with skillshots and use your other hand to activate abilities. Lots of multitasking, few auto-cast spells, combat is in real-time rather than tick based... All in all, it's one of the highest skill ceiling games in this style that i have ever played. OSRS requires almost no skill in comparison.

A game engine is simply the core components, e.g. physics, sound, various simulations, and yes **graphics**.  
---
I'm not sure where you got the idea that engines were purely server side but that's just not the case.  
---
Here's an excerpt from the "Game Engine" Wikipedia article  
---
&gt; The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics

They have a fairly low task weight from any slayer master. Between 70-85 I only got them about 3 or 4 times. Just keep slaying and you’ll get them.

No, actually orange man good. People say to me "orange man, how are you so good?" and I say "Brain. I have a very big brain. Okay? Tremendous, believe me". Now if I were a liberal - like if I ran as a liberal they would say I'm the smartest, it's true! But as a conservative we are a bit disadvantaged, that's why I always give my credentials, did this, did that, wharton school of finance, very big brain, very smart. Good genes, very good genes. And very big hands, trust me! The fake news media say I'm not known as a humble man, but I am actually humble, I think I'm much more humble than you could understand.

Alternative - have a brain
---
AH I thought you meant that brews were tanking because of twitch prime 
---
I realized that when I was getting all the way through a rotation without killing it I just needed to go grind mage/range for a while and come back. I have 81mag 79range now still just going to keep grinding for a bit and maybe save up for a ring of suffering before I go back. So many fucked up runs because I herped and I derped and I let my recoil die.

And here I sit, broken hearted, came to shit, but only farted

You should have deleted this ASAP.

Despite why you may have posted it this will definitely draw T_D here, and they will relentlessly bridgage this subreddit.

This is why so may subreddit have a clear no politics rule.

I’m so excited

Personally. 
---
I block metallic drags, blue drags, and black deamons.
---
And I skip anything that isnt bus table or cannonable. 
---
Here is a chart to help make your block list.

https://mobile.twitter.com/jagexkieren/status/643368017531928576?lang=en

Block the highest weight ones you dont want to do, skip the lower weighted ones you dont want to do.
---
The new slayer master is at least half the xp/hr, but the extra cash is nice if you are looking to try something different.

I think it is duridel, but the new slayer masters drop table can make you more if you're lucky.

---
Super attacks are pretty cheap, and if you work on getting dragon battle axe, just dbaxe spec every 5 minutes and sip your s atk pot and you're solid for your task.  You can double sip the first one or bring a dose of restore potion for the very first spec
---
ah man that sucks since they would be so great
---
Depends on how much time you want to put into the alt and how often you plan on using it. If you're playing often and plan on maxing or doing high level pvm, rune dragon alt would be better and is more versatile. It requires a ton of money and time (90+ combat stats, 200 quest points, justiciar/lance/zenytes or similar gear) but will pay off much more in the long run. It could also be used for solo raids, gwd, splashing, etc. If you're just looking for something to afk for a little extra cash, go with something easier like a cannonball alt and maybe do herb runs and battlestaves on it.
---
Why wouldn't I type to elaborate my stance on the matter? You're right, not all gear should require anything but the skill levels needed to equip. However, there are items like capes and gloves (except mage) that require effort on other fronts than money and the necessary stats, which is imo fine and makes the game more exciting rather than just being able to buy bis melee gloves or bis range cape slot
---
I think wildy slayer is in a fine state, konar really hasn't had an impact to it.
---
For point hoarding wildy slayer is still best, for fastest exp duradel is best, pre barrage tasks wildy slayer is probably best. Konar is best only for hunting hydra tasks.
---
Konar is also noob bait, the task weightings are terrible for exp and the keys arent even worth much. An extra ~1k per monster kill on task is nothing compared to the extra time you need to spend slaying because of the slower xp/h.
---
The next update the wildy gets should be a full rework of the wildy bosses, these are broken by design and are all only killed with glitchy safespots.
---
It's like if bgs needed to be buffed
---
not at lvl 67 combat lol, dont even think about BH. 
---
Sometimes u can find an equally shit acc to fight on pvp tho.
---
However, it's pretty fun as a main. 
---
An upgrade kit for the Armadyl Crossbow
---
can justi legs be made normal? X)
---
Firemaking should be buffed by allowing you to make fires without a tinderbox, it's useless but it's a start.
---
If you want to find the chance of you can can work out the percentage off the task weights in the wiki. But tbh. It’s no use hunting tasks. I went a week where every other task was black dragons. And then then 2 weeks of none. It’s all the rng. Just gotta roll the dice. 
---

im so hyped i just checked the channel
---
I don’t want to rain on your parade too hard, but that weapon would be dogshit for pvm. It’s barely better than the leaf bladed battleaxe which is practically useless for anything other that turoth/kurask.
---
A 5 tick melee weapon would need stats well into the 100s to be viable for pvm (unless it has some special effect,) however that would make it broken in pvp.
---
Instructions unclear; dick stuck in dust devil.

it's just for the +1 prayer over the black def lol

75 and haven’t got them. 😑

On one hand, the weekly format works really well because it let's him undertake insane grinds and cut them down to a few short clips while still having plenty of content.  Daily would challenge him to find content when he has to spend all day running back and forth getting limestone.

Get a grown cat in runescape and chase the rats.

But weight reduction doesn't help restore your run and a couple pieces can get into negatives where it doesn't help drain rate either.

How is his question loaded?
---
It seems like he's just ignorant about the studies.
---
It's not really a loaded question if you can just outright say "yup" and answer it, right? You don't have to entertain some false assumption to answer his questions.
---
The dps would be significantly lower than even rcb diamonds, I guess being able to wear full tank is worth something though.
---
That's why you make a quest requirement???
---
Do slayer and try to collect all the drops from every slayer monster in game.  
---
Gz. I also got two zenyte drops in my last task plus a 3rd that some retard/bot left on the ground. it was beautiful. 
---
You have a good point but I think it's easier if you have already have a main that's maxed or decent stats and spare cash 
---
I really should've bought all my money in seeds when it was down low, I thought the price would stabilize.

Should I hold my weeds until it goes up then?

I hope so, it was yesterday.

So, basically PoE stash tabs?

Lol that takes 2 seconds

you get elite void from hards which is only 300? i think. The elite rewards for western diary are pretty shit actually but that wasn't even my point. I noted it because of the person I replied to said " The diary rewards should be seen as a bonus. You'll get the levels anyway if you play the game. You shouldn't grind out 1-90 in a skill just for the diary and then expecting a huge reward from it. No, you should consider the high level you've achieved as the real reward." There are a few of fairly annoying/long diary reqs majority of people would never do if it wasn't a diary req. 
---
&gt;But weight reduction doesn't help restore your run
---
It does in that it reduces the rate at which it depletes. 
---
&gt;a couple pieces can get into negatives where it doesn't help drain rate either.
---
Which just allows you to carry more shit.
---
The set is already powerful enough and takes relatively little time to acquire. It has no needs to a buff.
---
Cons: Devalues my bandos gwd only ironman
---
It would need double the accuracy bonus to compete with the whip at places like skeletal and ancient wyverns, and even at those places you're looking at no difference to a 1.5% increase in DPS. 
---
With its current stats the dscim and whip outrank it everywhere.
---
I have a pure which is fully quested, it has 60 attack, 60 str, 50 ranged, and 64 magic. I don't pk on that because I thought it would get killed over and over by pures with better stats. 
---
I feel ya hahah 
---
Its a upgrade. To the other package.  The bronze one.  If you didn’t buy the bronze one already you did now.  Your confusion is your own not theirs.

I mean I’ve got hards done more so for chally but imo I’ll never have the patience for the choppy birds. Just like I look at rc levels on some of the diaries and say ok I’ll probably never achieve that. Imo diary’s aren’t a requirement. But I do agree there’s a lot of stuff that people would never do. I don’t think I’d ever go do temple trekking if it wasn’t required for mortania diary. But it’s a way of getting people to test some stuff out and get out of their comfort zone. 
---
It's good for dragons on an iron man if you dont have d sword or zammy hasta
---
I regularly bring 800-1.2k balls depending on the task. That’s usually all you need. It’s very possible to do wildy slayer during peak hours and something I’ve done regularly. If you pay attention, bring proper gear + food/sups then you can get away the majority of the time. Just paying attention is the majority of the battle to get that tele/run before TB’s fly. 
---
The only non cannon tasks are spiritual creatures, ents, lava drags, aviansies, revs and black drags. That’s 6 tasks out of 26 possible tasks, 27 if you have boss tasks unlocked. 
---
Wildy slayer has never been about the money. It’s always been for fast points. The emblems are a boost to help with supply costs. 
---
I used to have a kid who would piss all over the walls on purpose, janitor ended up leaving a note calling him sick in the head. We were 8.

She's well over 15 now. She says she's unhappy with the oppression of muslims, she was fine with non-muslims being killed, but the muslims should have been treated well.
---
She says she doesn't have "high hopes" for the caliphate being successful anymore, and isn't even sure she wants it to be due to the opression of muslims. I.e. she is saying if they treated muslims fine and killed everyone else, she'd be happy.
---
Why does this person deserve forgiveness when they're not even remorseful? This person doesn't reflect the values of our country and left to help terrorists. She'd still be happy with the majority of people in the UK being killed.
---
The only reason she wants to come back is because she's concerned about her unborn child. I feel bad for the child, but why should this child be given priority over others who want to come here?

yeah you're 100% correct. Your play style will play a large part in which diary is most valuable to yourself.
---
You won't find casual main pkers unless you train your stats higher. You messed up by not staying 40 def and attk and leveling str and range to be a range 2h tank.

It's a stupid ass shield to begin with so I don't know why you're being full bitch about it when you haven't suggested any other possible req for it ya fuck.

---
black defender is ass anyway, bandos book is better

Dont look at the range/mage anti dragon shields omegalul

If you don't have a ton of money then, no. It's an expensive piece to minimize the many portal rooms we used to have. Maybe just build the first level of the nexus and hang your xerics talisman and digsite necklace because those are pretty useful.

IMO, "willingness to practice" is something we have very little control over, but I can see most people disagreeing with that.

The drop rate of a whip is something liken1/512 at abby demons, I went about 7k dry of a whip. That's 14x the drop rate I went try.

Chef's hat with the pizza cape? I dig it.

So before I got dhcb and I got around 500 KC just using blowpipe, I found that if I didn't use any deff lowering spec and using addy darts I got 2-3kills per trip in comparison to the 1 possibly 2 from using a deff lowering spec so IMO you don't really need a deff lowering spec at all. that's my 2 cents

it definitely helps when your using blowpipe, if ur using dhcb, then you dont need specs
---
Never hopefully

It comes still attached to Kril's arm and you hold his severed arm for greater reach.

Where does it say to leave?  It says a 64+ BGS damage is better than a single DWH hit
---
Nice b8

Tfw got 99 fishing before pet was released )':

That is incredibly op - bind is strong enough as is. Im saying almost none of these spells would be healthy for PVP but a spell-shield would be useful, and not broken IMO. Would be useful on PVMers as well as deep wild PKers as they could protect themselves from TB too. 
---
I'm so sick of people messaging me this everywhere I ask for it. Using the boots is one less inventory slot every trip. Sure, it's only one inventory slot but why do people who have not completed the most difficult part of the diary at an advantage over those who haven't? I have purposely not done this diary just to keep my one extra inventory at Vorkath. It's annoying.
---
Rev caves with a magic short bow and salve Ammy ei. Then once you get enough money get 80 magic and head to zulra with a blowpipe, toxic trident and void
---
You contacted nvidea?  Lol...
---
I believe you, I just probably screwed up somehow.
---
No youre not getting it, you need to complete dark souls 2 to wear the shield
---
Irl staged prank videos
---
&gt;The only circumstance where I'd agree with it is if someone's developed an addiction to the game and doing something like this relieves them of that.
---
The worst way to help addiction is to feed it. Its like letting a junkie shoot up "just a little" to help them. There a real response. As to why I "chose to dispense my verbal diarrhea here" on your post is because your comment read like one of Serene's.
---
What's your range and defense level? I got my first fire cape at 75 defense/80 ranged using blowpipe, and I just used a bastion pot on the healers and killed them one by one and then killed Jad. 
---
You’ll get it next time, also pray range for when he spawns because I believe he usually uses that attack first
---
Should be about 4 to 4.5 hrs longer based on the last videos publish time
---
I'm pretty.
---
Also turn off player models.  
---
My first 10 attempts I couldnt figure out how to run mage hand without getting hit, turns out I was using longrange like I was in team raid. Use accurate and its a cakewalk
---
I’m a simple man. I see The Office I upvote
---
More like played 4-5 months took off 2-3 months. Was in college the past 4 years and did most of the long grinds during school breaks. And it is not like I haven’t done grinds. Got 75 crafting for glories, did 200+ meds for rangers, currently 78 slayer, grinder full guthans at 400kc at barrows with ice burst. The assumption of me asking for a linear gameplay is you thinking I just want it easier because I hate the grind

What GodHand says is mostly correct except for 1 thing. He states that 90 is the recommended level . If you're asking that question then I guess you have never raided before. In that case 90 is a very high entry barrier and very costly. 78 is the recommended and required level to start raiding and generally being accepted into parties. Sincw with 78 you can make the best versions of enhances, brews and restores. The only thing you cant make are ovls +. But most raids either have Tekton or Muttadiles anyways so you wont need to make ovls. And if the raid does not have them, normal ovls aren't bad either. 
---
90 is the optimal level but not realistic for beginners. Keep 78 in mind which is cheap and quick to get. You will make the money for 90 eventually.
---
Oh my gooodness same here... I am enjoying this quality content while I grind away for some rc levels.

“They can only be attacked if players have them as a slayer assignment. To be assigned cave krakens, players require level 87 Slayer and 50 Magic.”
---
Your point is what I want. But the quote above is the reality to it. 
---
swamp lettuce
---
Defense increases the chance that the giant will miss, hitting a 0.  Also wear a chainbody against giants, it has slightly different defense stats than a platebody.
---
Possibly to make a strength amulet? I'm not sure.
---
Attack determines whether or not you hit, strength determines how much it hits for.  Strength levels are more important but you do need attack levels.
---
I would train magic and ranged up a bit, magic will be useful for a number of spells.  I would look into how you are going to kill obor, if you need magic/prayer/ranged levels for that.
---
Sorry bruh, chrome is faster. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
The prayer icon at bottom lol?
---
Had a quick Google and someone crunched the numbers and 64 is the average def reduction for DWH. So if you don't hit 64 with BGS you're not reducing it's def to 150 so it's inferior or something, efficiencyscape dictates you tele out and try again. I think it's arbitrary for 99% of players.
---
as long as a single click gives a 4 dose

I don’t like Trump either, but what the fuck is this 
---
Farming guild destroys my FPS too. No clue why! 
---
I have some clarification questions. Again, we can refine this idea. 
---
1. How will players acquire the amulet? Monster drop, clue scroll, BH shop?
---
2. What do you think REASONABLE requirements for this amulet will be? Is this going to be for high level players or available to any and all? Requires a quest?
---
3. Will this amulet work in all wilderness areas including revenant caves? Will it function differently in multi combat areas vs single combat?
---
4. Will the effect change in any way the farther into the wilderness you go? At what point in the wilderness will the amulet effect start?
---

Some people pay for having alts.. I'm about to put membership on two other accounts (to make 3) in a couple weeks. In EVE Online I had 4 at once. One guy in EVE is pretty famous for having, I think, a 100 paid accounts to cloak (go invisible) in enemy space.
---
Is there anything wrong with paying for multiple?
---
Oh I spotted it.  I really don't know why he even replied to me the first time and ofc now that my comment has been linked I get downvote brigaded on a true statement. 
---
I'm not assuming anything, but kraken is how it was polled to avoid people farming drops from it. It isn't an extremely rare task and the fact you're not even 87 slayer yet you really can't even complain about it.
---
Add “Skulled Revs” and ask to be added, he should have his private on

but...why?
---
Not a single thing in your comment addresses anything that I said.  
---
You were claiming that the engine is server side. I'm telling you that you don't understand what a game engine is.  
---
Yes, OSRS is server-authoritative like 99.99999% of multiplayer games out there. Nobody is disputing that.  
---
You might want to re-read what I said.
---
Nice one! Total value 9,8m
---
How.
---
what about his left man?
---
Ah yes, a valid point.
---
If you look at my later response you will see that I mentioned I was attempting to bring light to an ad populum point. As though saying that he would bring his pet somehow changed anything, which it didn’t. Thus, I said the same, because it changed nothing about the practical discussion.
---
You are entirely correct to point out that someone just saying they would do something means nothing.
---
I just tried the trawler for the first time today. I also had a horrible experience. Don't think I plan on coming back anytime soon. Couldn't do anything because it was so insanely overpopulated. First timer removed from game for inactivity despite best efforts to get something done. Several people there were saying it was 3rd attempt just to get on. I seriously hope Jagex comes through and reworks some of this minigame. At least on the dedicated world because nothing can be done right now. They need more games running simultaneously and to stop overpopulating them. I'd also suggest like OP here that the activity bar be adjusted. It simply isn't worth the hassle.

Doesn't mean he can't request to live wtf lmao. I swear pkers on this sub right now are ready to bite the jugular out of anyone who doesn't beg people to kill them in the wildy.

This happened to me on my second try. I stood by where I killed the orange mager, but Jad spawned a ways away. Find where the orange mager actually spawned if he had to walk to find you by looking at the possible jad spawn locations.
---
Some scams are not based on greed but rather the kindness of the other person

The reason you can't is to prevent basic keyloggers from knowing your pin, if it's random coordinate clicks they can't as easily.
---
haha it is pretty true, isn't it?
---
Nice 
---
I.e noob
---
Must be why the audience ain’t happy, they had to go through that fucking maze
---
Nice, finally some good fuckin' dopamine
---
The whole reason it moves around is to stop keyloggers and stuff like that from tracking your pin 
---
Automatic right click on the extra button but have it disabled for the run between Edge and Altar (if you're using pouches and stuff). Enable at altar and enable at bank so you can 1 click fill/empty pouches.
---
It's pretty dangerous if you don't quickly get past the outer ring inside the Abyss. Refer to some guides on YouTube for best inventory setup
---
I'd say it's the fact that adventurers can't attack each other except past a small trench that marks off an unsafe space in the map, yet the citizens of Gielinor can attack people freely. (bandits, thugs, highwaymen, etc.)
---
I was just trying to explain why pkers wear them in f2p but not p2p :(

One time I pooped in a urinal in highschool, and I mean it was a massive fucking emoji looking turd. They shut down the bathroom for like an hour, and it was that day that I learned why criminals return to the scene of the crime. I had to see the chaos and Carnage during period changes when everyone went into the bathroom and looked on my turd in both fear and disgust. They even blocked off the bathroom with yellow crime scene tape. I did feel bad for the urinal, though.
---
"you aren't supposed to cut it in half" says who? Are there international laws on cake baking?
---
It's okay... my time is soon... right?
---
Hey my man I care about a strangers loot so your statement is wrong
---
He've started to upload the videos really late :c
---
I suspect solo games? Could be wrong though, either way... Nice
---
So your logic is “it passed a poll before it was ever released so since the poll pasted back then with no knowledge of power level/pricing/usage then that’s how the game should stay”
---
You should be able to do both and honestly if you have a keylogger your least pressing concern is probably your pin.
---
I support this only if white defender is better than black defender 
---
Just make sure you're dling it from [runelite.net](https://runelite.net) and your computer will be fine.
---
So I'm combat 83, 86 range, 73 magic, 60 defence, 50 attack and 43 strength. I have been saving up and I have about 13 mil right now. What weapons should I invest in for the future? I only have a blowpipe as of now and Ibans staff. Any suggestion would be great!
---
Read my response to the other comment

Okay good tips. I will give that a shot. But one thing that rattled me is when I follow a zulrah rotation guide and zulrah is in mage and I pray mage, I’ve still been slapped for 40.

I wish you were my friend
---
I'd take this down, it's blurry but I'm guessing your pin is 7332?

Yes, I guess you could think of it that way. I tend to think of it more as a way to play with friends without outside help gathering supplies and items. Making more teamwork out of the group.

I like your comment but it does kinda hug the line of the "No condoning botting" rule. I'm cool with controversial discussion but I'm unsure it's worth a ban.
---
As a response though - assuming there isn't any harm to the community for a bot to get 99 magic (say he ice barraged his way there), it's still a gateway to botting other activities. Hell, it'd probably turn you into an even bigger efficiency whore.

---
When you get 75 attack an Abyssal Whip is essential. At 75 magic you can use a Trident of the Seas/Swamp but may not be worth using over Ibans until 80 magic as the damage scales with your level.
---
In terms of armour, an Amulet of Fury is a decent upgrade on the glory for Ranged and Melee while the Occult Necklace is a massive upgrade for magic.

Shower thought, what if by setting up nmz he meant his bot was set up incorrectly and he's just angry that he was caught flicking outside nmz :(

or at least could we swap the hand that we hold bows in because currently it suggests we are ambidextrous as we hold swords/axes/etc in our right hand but also bows in our right hand which would suggest we are left hand dominant for range only..which is weird...apart from cross bows and darts/knives/throwing axes....this game makes no sense

Thank you so much! And I’ll definitely research this on YouTube. Your tips are still very helpful!

It's difficult to listen to what you have to say with any amount of respect when you speak like that. You're only serving to divide the community more than to reach mutual understandings.

This so much. Blowpipe should be T80. SoTD should be tier 85 and Kodai wand is even more broken. Kodai should prpbably be T88 or T90.

I wasn't actually trying to stay alive, I didn't want to spend out the ass on antivenoms until I felt confident I could actually get through a full zulrah run without getting hit by poison pools. I used like 20 tuna and just tried to stay alive as long as possible with just recoils and avoiding his attacks in regular zulrah gear like ahrims. 
---
When I actually started seriously trying I kept getting him to like 20% or less hp and messing up on jad phase or the one or 2 phases after. Also I used monkfish instead of sharks/anglerfish and karambwans because I was already paying out the ass for antivenom+.

Ty everyone who responded. Tbh in the guides I watched they labeled these optional and etc. I assumed they had them off when they went for points, I was wrong. Which is why I was confused by why I seemed to get way less than them. So yeah I reset up the nmz and included nearly all of them besides corrupted lizard who hits through absorption and witch experiments and elvarg, the hard to kill omes I just used the nuke powerup on them. I also used The Inadequacy for reference again, I got around 73k-74k from killing it compared to 8500 i was getting before lol. I didn't realize how much of a difference it made making it now 9x as much even though before I had the majority checked on anyways.

If you use RuneLite, turn on GPU plugin and "Stretched Mode" plugins. In the settings for "Stretched Mode", tick all 3 boxes and set it to 100%. If you are on Fixed Mode, the GPU plugin fixes the pixel mess it becomes when using Stretched Mode.

Not even remotely close. 
---
IMO the best way to improve the GWD experience is just to add hard mode versions of each boss with unique drops.
---
Neither of those statements are true though. I’d argue that since most of your xp should come from bursting slayer, you’ll profit on 99.  Shit, even things like spin flax or tanning hides are faster and cheaper than alching. 
---
Just scout easy rooms like mystics, guardians, shamans, crabs and tightrope. Vespula is actually super simple to solo imo but I wouldn't start scouting that until you're a bit more comfortable. 
---
Don't be afraid to scout thieving or ice demon. Yes, they are painfully slow and should be avoided in the future but when you are learning they are easy room completions.
---
Start adding in other bosses in your scout rotation as you get more comfortable overall.

I hate the RS3/WOW art style so much. Extremely hard no  just on looks alone. I will actually quit this game if the devs start ripping off RS3 cosmetics for old school drops. On top of that God wars dungeon doesn't need any more drops, and not being able to attack aviansies with melee is a classic mechanic that I'd rather not mess with.

Tbh people act like this game is real life on this subreddit.  If someone is able to bot their account to 99s without getting banned, that's an achievement in and of itself. Wily Bankloot botted to a max range tank and he deserves it imo for being able to pull off a bot for that long and avoid jagex's detection protocols.

Oman I remember doing this shit killing tzharr back in the day lmfao I made so much money off my tune hasta then I would see dudes in void kill them in less then half the time with a bone crossbow and I was so jealous those where the days (I’m talking pre eoc times like 08 or 09 lol)

Other guy gave the context. In normal circumstances like simply wanting to not pledge allegiance, it's your right. A Supreme Court case in 1942 decided that.
---
Normally yes, but deadman pulls in many more viewers than any ironman content.  I don't know what you're talking about lol.  You could make the argument that it's inconsistent, but the fact is it does pull in more views and gain more attention as it puts osrs on top of the twitch views.
---
He's 11. And political speech is still protected even if it's retarded. Shit, it's *especially* protected in that case, that's kind of the entire point. Reprimand him for being disruptive and all, but arresting him is just way too far.
---
How much rune ess on average do you reckon people use to get to 99 runecrafting?
---
I’m not sure but I know when you die on runelite it tells you what world you died on 
---
All day every day!!!! 
---
You need 75 attack but dont tell anyone you leveled that up

This isn't about helping Ironmen. This is about helping non-Ironmen.

This is why I always play on my “home” world since this happened to me once lol
---
I think agility is fine other than maybe between levels lvl 70-90. I think adding 2 new courses/activities between those levels would put the skill in a great place.
---
Other guy gave context. I'd like to add it's literally a Supreme Court case. You're just trying to find ways to be mad. Literally anyone can sit out the pledge and if a teacher forces them to do it then they can be taken to court and they will lose.
---
Had a guy begging saying he couldn't be bothered to grind out go he just wanted to play the game
---
How do you explain the 40k+ views on DMM then? Every ironman streamer who does DMM gets many more viewers while on DMM.  Streamers who normally get no views, also blow up.  Youtube vids as well blow up.  This may be your opinion, but at the end of the day it's all it is.
---
No, it was no more than 2 weeks in and out for hasta to nearly double in price and drop back down to what it originally cost. I was about to buy one when I noticed a spike in price from something like 11m to 12m a week before kebos release. I waited 1 week after kebos and it had dropped from nearly 22m or so back down to 12m, so I could buy one again. Had I'd known it would happen so quickly I could have made bank.
---
Either way, my point wasnt the time it takes for the price to change. My point was that having to poll an update and allowing the playerbase to know an item is going to receive a buff is a big no no because the ones crying for these buffs are the ones holding on to the item in mass quantities waiting to make money crashing the market.

Yeah same but sometimes i need to hop because of full slayer cave/map ...
---
Then couldn't Ironmen doing that be disabled?
---
No my logic is, it's not a rare task it's fine how it is right now.
---
Wat
---
Well for Zulrah you need an open inventory space to swap to blowpipe, so a 1 dose ranging or magic potion will open up that space, and you only really need a 1 dose per kill anyways.
---
I have no idea why you’re so angry about the 10 seconds I wasted by decanting a few potions to 1 dose.

You can collect you cannon free of charge go to the  dwarf mine entrance west of the monastery.

Didn't he get rid of the flail in the last episode?

absolutely not the whole prestige from untrims comes from the restraint of not getting any other 99s. In short: devalues my untrim only snowflake

It was +7 when I logged out for the day. Came back to negative and found out you decided to make into your own post for karma.

Isn't it interesting how the internet creates echo chambers? You'd think unlimited access to all information and all types of people would foster only one viewpoint but communities get fragmented/isolated and you get the cancer that this community can be (gay pride event for example). 
---
What a surprise it looks like the beta from those chad memes
---
because it is seasonal.  
---
Pentoshi... Cock.. Merchant
---
It's probably not the paying attention part that makes people not like it, it's just that it's very repetitive and boring. Maybe a longer agility course with a lot more variation would be better.
---
Hey I just want to say it's impressive how much you do for Runelite and I appreciate it
---
Killing black knights gives you reputation with the white knights. They don't drop anything lucrative.
---
Maybe later down the line, but currently it's still a relatively new piece of content so it's more under a spotlight. I think they wouldn't want to have the same problem they had with the Zulrah plugin. 
---
Just my two cents obviously but I don't see it being released.

Barrows gloves? Yes. Optimal questing? Nah, just have fun while getting the reqs

---
It’s clearly negative in my screenshot... 
---
They don't currently keep track of what everyones first 99 was so an update like this wouldn't apply to anyone who currently has a 99
---
Damn, sorry man. I could very well go 1000+ before I get my next one. I never would have thought I'd get one so quick. Hope you get one soon!
---
I feel ya, but overall he’s the best. I truly believe there should be a statue of him in the game. 
---
congrats. I just got 98 today, i'll have 99 before the end of the month
---
Verac skirt would be nice for him I suppose 
---
She thicc tho
---
*examine statue*
---
“Hiya and welcome to my guide”
---
LMAO the first part of your screenshot of my text says "3 points 7 hours ago".The fuck are you on? Can I have some?
---
They could do it, but it would only work for the players that get it after the update. They have no way of tracking it in the current game. So it would never pass a poll since most people still have to do the drop trick.
---
KOTS was not really "big".. There was barely any user activity and the viewcount as much, much lower than DMM.  Which is probably why they never did it again.
---
Oh fuck, really? That's pretty shitty, i had no idea. That said, I don't quite think that is a reason to not implement something like this -- but yeah, yikes, that's shitty
---
Did I touch a soft spot?
---
Looks like an Ironman 
---
Nice troll attempt.
---
Bruh this sub needs to chill
---
THE COMMUNITY WANTS IT.
---
One example: Today's Q&amp;A.  They don't currently keep track of each player's first 99.  The only solution would be to allow any cape to be untrimmed, which would never pass a poll.
---
Take your shallange was pretty good I agree
---
Yeah, it looks that way. You think people would downvote it just for the lols?
---
Osrs doesn't need any cosmetic Skilling pets that's garbage

I'm not arguing with him..? Holy shit are you retarded?

No because it makes pvm too easy and boring. 
---
There was a Q&amp;A today?
---
I was born and raised in an Eastern European country, no one did it here, it wasn't even around during the commie brainwashing years (although mandatory morning exercise was a thing in some schools oddly enough). I've spoken to many people from all over Europe, none of them have mentioned it or brought it up. That's why I thought it was just some meme about "shit Americans do". 
---
I couldn't be assed to Google it, and just asked, only to get politics brought into this. 
---
When did jagex put me in the game? I'm honored
---
*Has hybriding gone too far?? You may think twice after seeing these pics!!*
---
There are already skilling pets in game? I’m confused 
---
Turn on auto retaliate and just kill the healers so you can keep focus on switching your prayer. Auto retaliate is so you go back to hitting jad without clicking on him. This made ir 1000% easier for me personally
---
There are currently skilling pets in the game 
---
Don't feed the troll. 
---
I made an account three times and none is leting me in
---
Slayer isn't profitable
---
I’m referring to when clans infiltrate the cc with team capes and kill Spark immediately and then finish off anyone else left. Makes for a horrible viewing (since he’s regearing 90% of the time) and pking experience if you’re riding solo with the squad. 
---
It isn’t his fault. Side effect of a terrible clan system that Jagex continuously sets to the wayside. 
---
Hey why post this fuck off
---
I think you are retarded
---
But did you die tho?
---
Now that's some old-school shit right there.
---
That inventory setup tho

Not for the lols, people have a legit reason to dislike it. Think from their perspective. Why would they want something that doesn’t benefit them and also devalues what they’ve done to this point?
---
Ahhh... I'm in PST on west coast america and I wake up about 10pm every day (night?) so my sense of time is really, really fucked up.

The recovery email for your MAIN email.

Abit dramatic, i play both games thankyou :) rs3 for the better bossing/cosmetics and OSRS for alittle more grind/nostalgia lol.
---
my point stands regardless.
---
No, realistic 
---
I’m a 13 def pure and did it in like 2 trips with 70ish range. Broad bolts/overload/absorbs

Just use the higher point bosses on hard mode and it should be pretty quick 
---
i don't have a secondary account to play, i don't have any interest in making a normie :/// i can't pay for the bonds anyway

Macroefficiency. It just so happens that barraging on defensive is also one of the most efficient ways to train defense.
---
Why not both ?
---
No it doesn't.
---

You make money while barraging, so no

Your xp is faster literally everywhere else, so no

Oh and my boss plays on his phone when he has time, so that part is ok

No that is fucking rank

Can we get the rs2 normal spellbook teleport animation rather than the current one?
---
I mean if it's something as simple as quite literally wanting to know what other countries it doesn't seem worth it to ask on a forum when you can have it answered instantly if you actually care to know. The question sounded more rhetorical than anything like "other countries? What other countries!" 
---
That's how it looked to me at least because once again if it was a serious question it's answered quicker googling for two seconds. Ya this is a forum but a forum is for discussing things not doing a q and a on basic misunderstandings. 
---
Shout out to mining, the actual worst skill in the game.

I haven't played in roughly 8 months I keep seeing this guys name on my reddit feed.
---
Are his vids really that good? I need some inspiration to play again since I "quit".
---
It is takes a split second of your attention every 6-7 seconds. Which makes it insanely easy to watch a show while doing. With all other skilling, you have to fully redirect your attention to runescape for 3+ seconds.
---
What exactly am I looking at that’s so rare? Don’t really know clues rewards at all
---
Papa bless 
---
Ah I use my main to pay for bonds. A few hours of zulrah a month and I'm covered. I also like to play restricted ironmen although I normally burn out pretty early. I haven't found good rules for mr yet.

I use lamps on agility. Call Mod Ash, I don't give a fuck.

I can't do zulruh because my memory is super shitty :^) I spent 5 hours on it a while back and got nowhere, i'll probably try again once I get my trident here in a day or two with mage only
---
Believe me I think agility is one of the easiest skills to train, the challenge was alching the entire time which practically doubles the amount of clicks needed for a lap. Just doesn’t feel right training JUST agility when fletching and alching is available. 
---
&gt;	But really, that is a perfectly honest answer
---
That answer had nothing to do with what I said. You keep explaining random shit which I’m not even talking about. I don’t care about your intentions. I was just trying to get you to see that generally most novelties are rare. Clearly you can’t so I give up.
---
Could be a fun thing to do with your friends while hanging out in a discord call. Laugh at your mate who failed the dart dodge. Lol
---
I'm pretty sure if Summoning was added, we would see a huge decline in active players. IMO, Summoning has no place in OSRS, and I'm almost certain like 99% of this sub sees from that POV as well. Summoning would change the combat levels, combat mechanics (PvP and PvM alike), and just generally seems way out of place in a game like OSRS. 
---
I don't oppose it as bad as some others do. I'm content with the game the way it is. I get the want for new content, but honestly I just can't see that being Summoning.
---
I was skeptical too, but yes, they are very well done. 
---
Thats cool and all but you are the exception not the rule.
---
I still don't really understand how the lander algorithm works
---
My dad usually doesn’t stop when I ask :(

Sorry you sounded just like the two other fuck faces so I mixed up the messages.

You should have said I just felt you bro. Then he will relate this experience for years in random comment sections.

you ain’t wrong

Where is the video ?

It's worth doing them if you are hunting the pets, otherwise it's not really efficient to do them.
---
Unpopular opinion: neither are really that bad since mobile was released. You can just grind them while watching a movie.
---
Its okay, we are all autistic in one way or another. Some of us are more so than others.
---
Bro you just get a notification. It's 2019.
---
I have but I find it too stressful. It is indeed more interactive but I just dislike having to constantly stay active. You can't really take a breather or pause for a minute since you get punished for it, which feels pretty bad.
---
I just got back into osrs and oh my goodness! Settled's swampletics is like the best thing ever! Can't wait to see the new one after binging the series!
---
Exactly what happened for me. Got lucky at duel arena and made it into 25B after that I only logged in to do some drop parties for my mates. Eventually, I decided to rwt it all and make a fresh start with Ironman. Could not have been happier with my decision as doing things now have some kind of purpose. 
---
Generalities don't matter to me, I only care about the reasons I do things, not why someone else might do them. Hence, what you said, for me, is irrelevant.
---
And then &gt;!Armadyl beats Bandos up with his own mace!&lt;

Discouraging PKers is not a good thing though. Its important to have a healthy PKing community just like it is to have a healthy Ironman community.

Can you post any more info? Why not? Wrong password?

2 weeks ago I went to see what the hype was about. I binged watched everything in 1 day. Yeah they're good.
---
Can't hate on God Ash though 
---
He rolled 2 trimmed obby capes, and an ale of the gods. Also 2 magic seeds as a bonus. Just pretty unlikely to roll that many good drops, especially 2 of the same one. 
---
Then make 107m bows. Then alch 107m bows. Lazy? Shame.
---
Okay? I left the game to! I dont like rs3 either, but you just got to be an open minded person and disagree with a nice demeanor!! Im not for alot of things but I dont be a dick about it! 
---
I haven’t heard of this but if it was true that would be so nice.

As of now, the mark is calculated as a chance per obstacle. Only specific obstacles in each rooftop course get a chance, and time isn’t a factor anymore

Bursting dusties in catacombs is profit I think

I'm being a jackass about it because I didn't think he was serious it's different. When I can't hear his tone of voice or his expression I can't tell if a question like "what other countries" is rhetorical and supposed to be a jab at America or if it's genuine. And honestly I still don't believe he thought the pledge was a meme, so of course I'm still going to act like a jackass. Like you're right all of Europe doesn't do the pledge so the pledge might seem weird. But comon, we have shit like that all over American culture. We sing the national anthem at all our sport games with our hands over our hearts. I can see him not knowing we pledge allegiance but hearing about us pledging allegiance and thinking it's a meme? Once again, without seeing him in person saying something like that either sounds very stupid or like they are being sarcastic to jab at Americans.
---
From my experience, I've gotten the most keys from tasks where the mobs are just below 100cb, same thing for my friends, so Wyrms, Greater Demons, etc. have been pretty good about key drops, but as for kalphites I've only gotten keys from the soldiers, never the workers.
---
Once again this is just my own experience, I know higher lvls have the better drop chance, but for me that hasn't worked out. I get 3+ keys on wyrms, dagannoths, greaters, etc. but then when I get drakes, gargoyles, etc. (the higher lvl tasks) I'm lucky if I get 1 key. And this has been the same for my friends too. One of my friends got 7 keys from 128 greaters last night.
---
Either way I definitely feel like the overall drop rate for the KDT was nerfed when they added keys, because I was regularly getting 6+ drops per task.
---
I'm glad to see this is an actual thing. I basically do a lap of whatever rooftop I'm near and seem to be getting marks at a reasonable rate without actually grinding.

Except for C Engineer. He's not allowed to upload until he brings back the damned God's armor to the motherland.
---
Of course, if he was being an utter asshole first thats fine I believe you treat people the way you wanna be treated!! 
---
Can you make it auto submit coins in alchemy room or keep track of it on log out or disconnect? Currently you lose all coins and get no points. Mod ash likes the idea 
---
There's white armor in the game with stats equal to black, that's about it. You only need to kill black knights of you're an ironman and are buying the gear from the vendor.

Baby shark
---
I have over 5000 kc at gargs, and everything you said in the part about breaking down my numbers is right. You must have terribly shit RNG all the time my dude. 
---
I mean with 60 attack it’s definitely a little different. You’ll want to raise your range for your current combat level. So like 81-83 without raising a combat level.  Then your range would be maxed for your level and then use DDD or GMaul for spec.
---
It's not OCD, it's called garbage bloatware that has no place in this world.

What's the problem with having the blowpipe in the game? Kinda of new to the game so I don't get it, would you guys rather have just shitty weapons ?

Get more rustled. Pick up all your jimmies off the floor.

Step 1: get points for your imbues.

Step 2: never touch nmz again

Should take a break from Reddit you seem a bit mad bro.

Barrows with Ibans or trident. I think Ibans gives more xp but it’s a bit more effort to use

What'll it be today, boys, suicides or laps?

i was also 14 at one point dudeski so i can relate to u!

Because everytime a tree fell down they ran to the middle immediatly then went to another tree instantly when it showed up.

Mobile only and not doing farm runs lol

Agility is fine as well, super chill to watch shows while doing it. Zeah rc is just mad afk.

I'm not stupid.

Glad that you got the kill dude. That's about the setup/stats I had too when I first started, but I kind of took a different approach and started trying for a kill from the get go. Sort of mentality to learning to drive in a manual rather than an auto. Managed to down him after 7 attempts iirc.
---
Tithe farm is not an cp loss if your training farming, just click intensive
---
It's still his best gp/hr method other than zulrah.
---
Being literally the best method is t really overrated imo.
---
I can confirm that this still works 
---
A little over 100k per key avg is pretty good.  
---
What was Konar's most annoying task in terms of monster/location in your opinion?
---
Konar mainly but had some lucky clue drops.
---
Starting off a sentence with "you have to understand that ____" basically says that you think the other person is wrong and they need to understand what you have to say. 
---
AKA, you're arguing with them.
---
&gt; What impresses me is people who manage to bot without being detected, that shit is awesome.
---
That's just because it's an actual challenge where you have to build something and make a plan. Those are the actual interesting parts of the game too, but they're often trivialized whenever there's a clear path that just requires allot of grinding.
---
I have 400 solo kills and counting. There is no problem with this boss. Kills are faster than Bandos, KC takes very little time, and you can easily pass 10 kills a trip.
---
the solo melee record is really high, i wouldnt say hes aids to fight. its like bandos, you learn to flick when soloing or you dont melee (bow / acb zammy, mage bandos)
---
Gino is that you
---
It's funny, I'm the complete opposite. Agility is probably my fav skill and I absolutely despise runecrafting 
---
It's ok, numbers aren't hard
---
Yes please, you should be able to withdraw potions by doses. Or at least have a barrel in your house like other people suggested.
---
Runelite is doing a direct upscale though. I wouldn't know how Jagex would make official upscaling without making a vector version of everything. In that case, it wouldn't have that old school feel anymore. I think direct upscaling would look fine without aliased edges (what this runelite method is doing). Official resizing might be better as I would make it a little smaller for my case but pixels need to retain their aspect ratio to look nice. With a 1080p monitor, the upscaling has a 2x upscale where each pixel is 2x2 instead of 1x1 (a ratio of 4:1 basically)
---
Aww but you seem the most butthurt about it :)
---
Cool
---
Hellhound tasks sucked for me, didnt seem to get lucky at all, Locations like Witchaven sucked. Also Blue Dragons at the Ogre enclave was awful as well.
---
I was born a fremennik :) 
---
Maybe they noticed the tree fall by either sound or sight, ran to somewhere they could see many tree spots, and went to one that appeared or the first/closest one they saw, and repeat. Doesn't really mean botting.
---
a guy who STILL HASN'T RELEASED THE NEXT EPISODE

Eyy love me some PoE leakage.
---
Elite void, all hard diaries, qpc, imbue all your rings, slayer helm, and salve amulet, and 75 slayer.
---
After doing the elf line through Regicide, I learned it is imperative to read the comments of his videos.
---
Get void and rigour, then try again. You can get much better profit/hr at your stats. I started killing vorkath at 90 range and was making 2m+/hr. I don't even use a bgs or dwh.
---
void does improve it drastically and serp helm is definitely not reasonable, literally no helm would be better than serp
---
*breakdown intensifies*
---
Ok so ur giving advice to about .001% of the player base
---
You can log out/bank between each kill. 
---
I can always appreciate someone who can laugh at themselves.

Good on you for having a sense of humor.
---
\-.-
---
Anyone have any idea of what happened to make the value of iron ore tank?  Used to be my humble way of making gp so I’m just curious. 
---
ok
---
Kril is actually the most difficult to solo imo in terms of kills per trip anyways (unless you're pray flicking each attack) due to being able to die in 1 tick from 70+ hp.
---
Imo solo difficulty from easy to hard would be - Sara -&gt; Arma -&gt; Bandos -&gt; Zammy. Sara and Arma are quite easy to get a decent number of kills in when using chins.
---
Lmao exactly this. See a scammer, just report and move on with your day. No reason to engage them. 
---
Your other items are not retrievable though 
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
I'm not saying it should be different or that I'm surprised. The point is that people regularly claim Vorkath as being overpowered gp/h with little-no regard of stats or gear.
---
I don’t mind it.
---
I didnt know hellcats were homosexuals. How progressive!! 
---
Surprised you only got that many gems. I'm on like 400 ruby's and 300 diamonds 70-78 slayer.
---
What does that even have to do with the argument? The statement was that DMM was less interesting than ironman content.  That Ironmen channels get more views than PvP channels.  Which is just not true.  
---
How do ironmen channels rival against PvP channels as far as numbers go? Sparc Mac is the most subbed RS youtube channel.  He has 400k+ subs and doesn't do ironman at all, he does exclusively PvP oriented things.  So do Torvesta, Framed, and many other channels that were built around PvP/DMM.  To say ironman content beats out PvP content is just ignorant.
---
Maybe you should read my comment again. In your seeing red rage of hatred against everyone and everything you must have misread it. I was merely presenting you with a way in which someone could have seen you as being “fucked in the head”. I was not calling you “fucked in the head” directly, but if you truly think the way that I described then you are seriously fucked in the head. 
---
82 construction is definitely a reasonable level for the average account. Get an ornate pool.
---
Personally, I don't like waiting for the game to restart and find soloing more engaging. 
---
I think overall xp is a little slower but more drops per hour and imo, quicker construction xp.
---
How is it supposed to work? I've always just assumed it was meant to be like that.
---
But..but, he's ruining my fun TODAAAAAAAAY......
---
Good to know thanks very much! 
---
It is already very easy to kill though, arclight + slayer helm and you'll smack him down in no time, wouldn't want to make it any easier
---
No, actually it would increase the value of that account
---
Half true, I was doing construction while watching Netflix the other day
---
Now I'm doing prayer, though, and I can't look away if I wanna keep the bones offerings going
---
You will get about 30 cents for that. I can do you a deal now for 10 cents let me know
---
If they instanced the rooms but halved the drop rate it might work. 
---
As someone who has been very casually playing since 2004, I've never learned what this actually does...
---
Statistically Challenged has a [wilderness only iron man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEt__qfvglY&amp;list=PL5CD-M_1gnfdN1gNBnWJaf0TZpF1U6z0B), Wildernaut. 
---
The point is that people regularly claim Vorkath as being overpowered gp/h with little-no regard of stats or gear. It's overrated because this sentiment only applies to quite advanced accounts.
---
C-Engineer has a hcim that's restricted to pvp worlds only. It's very entertaining to watch. 
---
By buying a fishing net and doing that thieving at the beginning kinda cheated loads of the content you could potentially have done, small things like that really affect series like this, that’s my two cents
---
Yes you simply have to achieve 1 kill on each one. What time and world were you planning on doing this? Bring your best gear BTW lol
---
Completely missing the point
---
But kodai saves runes and gives crazy accuracy and does not consume charges like ahrims and sotd. I agree blowpipe is broken but atleast it has only moderate accuracy compared to a crossbow.
---
Settled suggested one chunk man to me and he's great. Super dry sense of humour and 90min videos 
---
imbue lol
---
No it wouldn't, it's a Zammy item and if my account is only allowed in Bandos GWD..
---
For her that’s possibly too tame. Allow her to be unprotected by the law. 
---
This guy
---
We will all just have to smoke meth instead. 
---
Imagine choosing a flag over xp gain
---
Barend?
---
Ahtletics
---
Seems to only happen with the vampire DT boss, and with its RFD variant 
---
Good to see osrs community coming back together like the good ole days..lol
---
I totally agree with you i think utility specs would be super cool for both pvp and pve (that arent just random stat boosts)
---
You may have clicked the one mouse button feature that makes both left and right click act as a right click
---
He let me live, and I never said this instance was particularly toxic; also I've pked and been pked a lot I know what unwholesome pure toxicity is tyvm
---
omg who did this 🤣🤣🤣👌👌👌🤣😜😆🤔👌👌🤣😂
---
When you mash together my two favorite things:
---
1. Swampletics
---
2. Texas
---
Was 75 at the time and was actually alching to get magic imbue for lavas! Now I’m 85 and can use magic imbue if I decide to go back :)
---
Imagine wasting even more time on this comment... Lol watch out we got a cool kid over here 
---
*insert “that’s bait” gif*
---
It's an unpopular opinion because it's an uninformed opinion coming from inexperienced people. Agility is extremely afk when you've gotten used a high lvl course, way more sustainable and simpler than rc.
---
Probably getting furniture &amp; insurance. Meet the neighbours as well.
---
Mid 50s (not sure exactly what level) will unlock portals and a glory mount. Super useful so you can just buy home tele tabs. Altar to recharge prayer. 
---
AYYYY lmao
---
r/notfunny
---
And that's a fact.
---
No, he never said anything about my own items. I'm more worried about him somehow accessing my account information via an IP logger or something. If that's not really a valid concern and I'm misunderstanding how it works, I'd probably try it out to see if his account has anything on it. I don't really have any great gear for him to steal. I have bank pin and 2 factor 
---
Yesterday, I imagine. 
---
You're not supposed to stare at the screen when doing agil. Get used to the course and pull up a movie or game.
---
no
---
It's only popular if you're ill-informed honestly, agil is way easier to maintain doing.
---
But you are training multiple skills.
---
Snowstorm power outage is delaying the upload.
---
The fact that you're commenting about videos of a video game on the subreddit of that video game is pretty ironic. Also, the series and region locked accounts, in general, are really the only new type of content people are making for OSRS that I've seen. These series are more exciting to watch than your typical loot from X kills/ X hours of Y monster. I would think that the hype generated by this series can only do good for the game in general, and since you're seemingly so passionate about the game, I would think it'd benefit you to at least let people get hyped rather than shame then for it.
---
Just because of the no trading part? While I was playing nobody even acknowledged my existence so it felt pretty single player to me
---
Nah for most skills you don't even reach the standard droprate by the time you hit 99. Maybe if it would gradually scale up droprate at higher xp it would be better, however I think it's unlikely that any change of that sort would ever happen.
---
$50 + shipping?
---
When it was released, it was nearly 50% more dps than anything else in game. That's extremely overpowered.
---
Dude im so fucking worried rn what happened :(
---
I have used pretty much the same mindset in my fabrication shop, it works but I know plenty of people who play runescape super efficient and are just garbage adults with no motivation but to get a twitch deal or hit it off as streamers. 
---
Hmm u right, I think i meant to reply to someone else
---
Why did Jagex NOT give him a goatee is the real question!
---
What happened with the praise for Woox and B0aty?
---
Runecrafting bad
---
This is what I see daily as soon as I log in
---
What weapon do you use?
---
I'm sure the BBA helped a little. 
---
“Meet Snowletics, my snowstorm locked Ironman.” Got me gud.
---
dman dude dont tilt me like that
---
Thanks me too
---
Ironmen are still capable of walking from burgh de rott. Are you also wanting to add infinite home teleports to all major cities without cooldown like rs3.
---
That’s fucking beautiful
---
and that’s runescape
---
Still over 20'000 hours lol 
---
Free exposure 
---
Red cape &gt; Blue cape
---
can confirm I have lived next to one for almost a year now -- I've seen no wrecks tho
---
Haha that's awesome, I worked in a steel fab shop for a couple years (not as a welder) but a laborer before going to school. 
---
I’m pretty sure you’re a masochist if you stare at your screen and do agility. I’m more than used to the course and would be able to do it with incredible ease if I was not a l c h i n g the entire time. 
---
I'll probably use an rcb and some of my giant stash of runite bolts.
---
By your logic no YouTuber should have ever made any videos. You think all the ones we know today just started popular? They uploaded, continuously, to their “15 monthly viewers” until it paid off. 
---
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhh
---
from 1 word alone i can tell u are a quite dumpy, slightly overweight guy probably from the east coast, probably with very few friends a bad haircut and no chance at a woman ever. its actually scary how accurate i am with these predictions so dont even try and deny it
---
Yeah cos you actually have to work towards stuff than go out and buy it, example like rune scim, as ironman you cant make the 20k or so and buy it. Have to kill fire giants and get the combat to get it, and then feel rewarded when I get the drop.
---
Honestly i dont even know why im telling you this 😂😂, but maybe you should try it out. Wouldn’t reccomend it f2p though. And dont even look up guides (apart from quests) just go out and play
---
It does 
---
Haha I was the OP this post was based off of. I can totally explain why the second picture is blurred, but I like the mysterious vibe it gives. So I'm just gonna keep that to myself hehe
---
Imagine all these replies and no link 
---
Pretty much any unpopular opinion that gets seen is not unpopular, because otherwise they just don't get unvoted.
---
It did a bit, but there wasn't very many courses pertaining to the production side of business. 
---
hahahahahahahahahaha!
---
I'm trying to work my way into not welding anymore. But i didnt merch enough on world 2 to have the skillset to be a salesman hahaha
---
Awesome art!! You should paint the Willows in Draynor next! 
---
Didnt see anything about instances in your post
---
And 3000% better than anything you post on here 
---
inb4 "jokes on you i was only pretending to be a retard" 😎

Amazing. But missed chance of adding the old cape somewhere 
---
Fuck sake. I got settled in bed with my cuppa there.

Has to be a big damage increase to be able to dethrone the blowpipe at demonics

Snowstorm bad 
---
What??? 
---
Not great news for those us on GMT and have work in the morning! :'(
---
lmao pledge of allegiance
---
Is the quest version of vorkath easier than the regular one, I am planning to try and kill him for Ds2.
---
Thanks 
---
With nmz still un-nerfed I value combat exp at zero, but I suppose that's a fair enough argument
---
Don’t waste time talking to these non moonwalkers. 
---
Just to let you know, I quit barrows after 6 chests. Total loot from 6 chest.....130k. 
---
I am so with you on this. It's been the most frustrating week since I started playing, took over 2k tokens to go from bronze to iron. Finally have my drag now though
---
You should get a fiber optic internet and a backup power supply so you won't die on RS for disconnect or power outage.
---
With 83 rune crafting I get about 42k/hr at ouriana, which is constant clicking. I can put in way less effort on zeah and do bloods for about 36k/hr. Also, I make more money. 
---
Zeah runecrafting is excellent. 
---
What's that supposed to mean?

The scam is you putting items on there to do raids with, then him recovering.
---
Otherwise theres no scam if hes just giving you the login info.

Didn't know that. Thank you!

“Okay, boss. We can save a LOT of time if we use bots, but I’m worried someone might report us”
---
“What?” 
---
Took me 700 tokens from bronze to rune and 700 from rune to dragon #getowned 
---
PURELY sexual. 
---
Honestly, the death changes create this type of environment. Without risk of losing your items in PVM, you could die to anything and not care. Back then, you were afraid of losing the items you worked hard for because you weren't focused 100% of the time, or because something was slightly harder content than you were used to. It was a harder game when you lost your shit for dying.
---
It’s Lake, it literally says it in the title.
---
I gotcha. I might try it out, time will tell. For now I'm enjoying just watching Settled's videos 😁
---
I'm you, from the future. 
---
1 nature rune + 3 fire runes
---
Legit
---
You can afk for 10 minutes at a time in plenty of catacomb tasks with prayer and bonecrusher.
---
Tbh... sick item sink
---
dont worry mrmole i like your content... most of the time
---
Depending on how much you have in your bank and how organized you keep it, I could definitely see this being a friendship breaker. 
---
Yeah he thought he had it under control and then other people logged in and he couldn’t get to his stuff. I’m trying to find the scam on YouTube 
---
Brimhaven isn't interactive enough I'm, almost done doing 80-90 there, and about a third of that time was spent doing nothing, just interactive enough that I had trouble afking but not interactive enough to be actually engaging
---
I'm doing this quest for the first time in years right now. It's so infuriating that it's hilarious. 
---
Shadow of the Storm can be used for early range exp
---
I did 74-99 agility in ~2 very casual weeks following 99 RC. I did 77-99 RC in 30 days, where I’d do 12-15 very consistent hours a day, bloods only. Even though it was AFK, RC taxed my soul, but Agility felt like a joke.
---
Once you get into Agility’s flow, your brain turns off. RC’s the same, but Seers/Ardougne are literally twice the xp/hr. Idk if I’d agree
---
Doing alching makes it a bit ok in my eyes. You're busy the whole time. Just doing agility is afk but not afk enough to not watch your screen so it makes it extra boring.
---
Old games tend to run like crap. WoW runs like shit *for what graphics you actually get*. Sure, you get to turn the graphics to max, but even with good hardware it can chug hard when there's a bunch of players in the same place.
---
99% of all AAA games that came after wow look a thousand times more graphically impressive yet run far better.
---
It's just a limitation of old tech. WoW has had the money to keep the engine pretty well updated, but even then it's far from ideal. I don't know how jagex does financially but they also had an older (and probably less well made) product to work with.
---
All this said, I have a 1060 and a 7700...k...? I think, and the game has not once dropped below 50fps, which i assume is the cap because it never once went above it either.
---
don't be mean
---
It doesn't become competitive with non-slayer moneymakers like Zulrah, Vorkath, and Raids until Cerberus and Hydra (90 and 95 slayer respectively) or if you do solo Kree Arra on Aviansie tasks, and is never competitive with Theater of Blood.
---
If you do slayer in the most efficient way for xp, it's actually a loss to train it because of the cost of barrage runes and cannonballs. 
---
The only reason people tout slayer as a moneymaker is because they do extremely slow tasks for a very long time and this results in very low effort but slow profit (e.g. afking gargoyles, kraken). In terms of gp/hr it can't compete with dedicated moneymakers outside of a small handful of bosses.
---
The only bad part about agility is getting 1-70 Imo. Lol I skipped that with 99 fishing at Barb though.
---
Range is the easiest way to get Fire cape. You’ll want high prayer for the points if you can’t flick, too. On top of that, Ava’s accumulator will make life a ton easier and it’s quest isn’t bad at all. That’ll at least get you close enough to trying, but then it’s up to you practicing.
---
How much more exp is that? Just through normally getting the tickets I got 5k per hour from the traps
---
why is that? quite close, I play dota. could've memed with the $11 while you were at it.
---
I cant wait to do double astrals, double nats, then wrath runes
---
Nothing early is really worth it. I did chairs and Oak Larders to 50 then built my portals. 
---
Add a toggle for moving the camera controls to swiping the minimap on mobile. This would allow for a new input mode, where touching the screen instantly brings up the menu. The catch is that whatever option you release on, selects that option. So if you want to collect GE items from a banker you could simply swipe down on a banker and release. In one smooth action instead of pressing, holding, and tapping twice as you have to do currently. 
---
Y was implimented unpolled and you know it. It should've never been introduced into this game. 
---
In the bottom left where it shows information about a player or team it shows‘runescape player killer’ the player it zooms in on is Rpk - it then says he has 98 attack and plans on getting his skillcape in lumbridge for those wondering
---
How many problems you got?
---
Me sad
---
Damn commies not understanding TRUE PATIORTISM
---
have you tried looking away from your screen? it might help with your anger problem.
---
Sorry, there's no QOL solution for being retarded.
---
You'll need prayer pots, so get your herb up to at least 38.
---
Man what else am I supposed to do waiting for my lectures to start
---
It goes off calendar days, February has 28 days. At the end of the year you still get 365 days. 
---
I’m curious as well... I’ve been grinding it out in the meantime to hopefully dodge any changes that may come
---
You brought up a memory I have of when I lost my sara kite to a scammer. Such a profound moment of emotion haha nobody around can understand. 
---
imagine using an auto-clicker when you can just hit a rat for 2000 hours
---
A lot, and it's really taking a toll on my life and I'm very sad. 
---
Agreed, I'm one of those guys that sold his marks of grace because I knew I'd never get full graceful. There's just some things I know I, as a human, cannot do. 
---
This made me laugh
---
Lmao 
---
hey how is kob doing
---
Oh piss off. Not even gz. Just piss riiiight off.
---
Maybe thats the reason why Y is so good. It never gave a chance to the "muh X players" to vote against it. 
---
So what if it allows you to do [CONTENT]? Y is the PINNACLE of [CONTENT]
---
Q
---
Great quest needs a sequel
---
You can safespot baby green dragons in Brimhaven Dungeon
---
Can someone do an RS series where the must altenate training RC and agility one level at a time
---
Panicing so hard rn
---
Runescape taught me that if it seems too good to be true, it definitely is haha
---
what other gear besides ava’s?
---
Go back to wow
---
Make it so you charge it with crystal seeds &amp; ancient shards so those fuckers actually have a use.
---
FACTS LOL
---
Imo, Pre-EoC had the best concepts but poorly executed. In case any nubnub reading this hasn't noticed, we rip ALL of their concepts and rebalance it l0l and in some cases such as Corp and GWD we bluntly copy it altogether. I really just think overloads, turm, etc made PvM far too easy. As for ironmen, they ruin the economy by crying for resource-infested drop tables and instances. They also tend to be the most butthurt when they see my infernal cape and scream "waaah bought cape" when the majority of them are failed mains and want excuses to be failures.
---
Now, let's end that mindless rant since any further text on that topic will just be flaming and wouldn't be any useful or constructive feedback. I'm sure that a compromise could be reached such as how the Gauntlet will likely  be closer to dungeoneering since a lot of people didn't like how CoX was a ripoff of WoW's raids. I don't think this is necessary like at all if we can make everyone content by appropriately updating the current game.
---
However, I personally will always want it. There were so many quest lines and content I couldn't ever finish in Pre-EoC as unlikely as it is. It'd just be a colossal waste of resources like HD. Could they do it? Yes. Do they think it's worth it? No.
---
Really? So depending on what month it is, I get different value for my money?
---
I mean you SHOULD be mad. The problem here is at who. As an intellectual of course, I think it's mistaken to be mad at the pledge practice itself or the government. Idealistically and legally you aren't forced and won't be arrested. You SHOULD be mad at the stupid ass teacher who caused it, potentially the school that hired them, and potentially the officer who carried it out.
---
PRIF IS COMING FOR A REASON AND THAT REASON IS AFK AGILITY

And get like 20k slayer exp per hour

I would 300% buy this, frame it and display it in my living room. And then when anyone asks why I have it in my living room I'll explain to them that it's swamplicated.

He was attacking the dks????????????? Tryin to take my kills???????

Clover is quite an upgrade if you use windows explorer a lot (provides chrome like tabs and favorites)
---
Doesn’t Obor’s club have a special attack?

Yes, let's say you got 30 days every time, that would come out to be 360 days and not 365 days. 
---
That's amazing!
---
Sorry bro I was busy doing Darkness of Hallowvale, what did you need?
---
I’m sorry man. You can chat me if you need. Also, how many people done doubted you?

as soon as i saw unholy book and salve ei, my first thought was raids bank lol

Can also train at the ardy course with summer pies 85 to 99
---
It doesn't fill the void :(

Hey now, this is /r/2007scape not some sub where people act reasonably... I want to see some blood in this here comment chain!

I don't know the exact rates honestly. Autumn elegy has a really detailed guide on the course though
---
In an analogy, if someone got murdered would you be mad at the government saying "how DARE you let murder exist in your nation". Regardless of how much enforcement, people will do stupid shit. That doesn't mean we blame the government every time
---
zzz
---
&gt;Do people think others are influenced by knowing how close the vote is or something?
---
There is a false assumptuon that people are not influenced by seeing results here.  His question is just a sarcastic way to call people stupid for thinking otherwise.
---
Cool, thanks. I'm thinking of doing something besides souls once I get into the 90s since souls are such bad gp/hr. I was getting a little over 1m/hr with double astrals and around 31k/hr so maybe that's better than laws right now, but I'm not sure since I've never tried entrana laws with the giant pouch. Also considering just doing double nats from 91-99 even though it'll be slow af.
---
Why is your YouTube so slow, wtf

I wish real life had QOL solutions for assholes. No need being so rude for no reason

The group tele actually puts you closer to the bank on lunar isle than the regular tele, also gives more magic xp, and doesn't cost any extra runes assuming you have a staff for the earths, so you should always use the group one.

You can pay 30 points to a slayer master to skip a task, or 100 points to block it permanently.
---
I use my crystal bow out of principle because back in the day I spent over a year training to finally finish roving elves, so when I started OSRS I knew my first goal was to get CBow. It looks fresh as hell and its a classic.
---
Also mathematicallly if you paid for last month and this month then pay for next month you're still getting 90 days. 
---
At 10 hours a day that’s 2,000 days, or 5 and a half YEARS
---
Current bow string prices = 92 gp each, margin of 89 gp assuming the flax was bought at 3 each; you’d end with 9.5 Bill— averaging 1.73 bill profit a year.

Is time travel possible? All I need to do is go forward one week forever...
---
Lol nah I got what he was saying. I’m kidding. 
---
What, do you use Runelite lol?
---
oof
---
Of course it is. Jagex will most likely try to either revamp this piece or content or they will just outright start banning people that utilize the RuneLite developer tools for their own benefit.
---
As Settled said, it falls into a grey area, much like the puzzle box / clue scroll solvers.
---
I'm personally fine with it as I think it's unnecessarily laborious to complete the bogs otherwise.
---
Toggle click to drop when you click your Rune pouches and they will automatically empty, then just turn it off to fill them. Save me a lot of time on mobile.

To share my tiny bit of bad luck of yesterday, I went to demonics since i got a black demon task (finally) and the first demonic I attack was at like half health, so I finish it off so he gets out of my way. This guy about 20 squares away got a zenyte from it.
---
Cheat client strikes again
---
You should be doing (1/140)^3 then multiplying that by 6. And then that’s just the odds of getting those 3 specific items in one clue scroll, there would be many more combinations of value that would bring you similar gp

Is there a new video.

Ooh do you have a store up yet? If so post the link. I'd buy some

Lol alright I guess. If I was working I wasn't playing at all, and if I had schoolwork to do I judged whether I could manage to do both that and look at my screen every few minutes to fish at the same time.

Thank u for the math

There’s your semantically important term there. “Inspired by their design” 
---
It's like seeing the numbers in the matrix.
---
It's the bridge near the Nature Grotto in Morytania.
---
I did 70 to 77 RC in less than a week on mobile at zmi in between working it's really not that hard.
---
The tab buttons are bigger. Not quite lateral.
---
how many people you shot?
---
Fam its not about the idea but how you package it. Basic marketing
---
But combat can be so afk that you could just train it while working on another account. 
---
To forge my own journey from scratch
---
Thank you for your advice.
---
This changes everything 
---
Not yet. Currently working on establishing an LLC. Hopefully in the next month the store will go live. I’ll certainly post about it here :) 
---
Only one who gets karma is settled. Hopefully everyone els gets mass downvotes 
---
That makes sense. Is there any bosses you would recommend?
---
China is classed as a developing country by the WTO and most economists. Guess those uneducated idiots need to listen to the smart-ass Redditors like yourself.

Its disruptive to the minigame for anybody without access to trading. I'm perfectly happy with using TT items of lower tiers for higher tiers such as seen in elite clues and the flared trouser clue. It seems like a logical progression in the minigame. Prior to the expansion of clues all levels of clues could be done with reasonable requirements and item collecting. For example: Halberds being a more difficult item/emote requirement to meet. 
---
A lot of people in the iron community can't complete relatively easy clues because they need a reward from the clue tier that they're trying to complete. See the Hard Khazari Jungle clue: *Beckon on the east coast of the Kharazi Jungle. Beware of double agents! Equip any vestment stole and a heraldic rune shield*. **Or** *Cheer at the top of the agility pyramid. Beware of double agents! Equip a blue mystic robe top, and any rune heraldic shield.*
---
Okay great. I need two rewards from hard tier clues to complete this hard tier clue. Its also a common clue to get. Its the "must have experience for the entry level position" fallacy. You can use Armadyl, Ancient and Bandos stoles which are rewarded from medium clues. That is reasonable. But needing a Rune Helm or Shield that relies purely on luck is a poorly balanced - granted  I understand that the clues were implemented before Iron Man mode was developed. Being able to use the construction version should be acceptable as the requirements to get the item rely on stats more that a lucky drop. 
---
The hard clue emote table is PLAGUED by this problem. There are 4 out of 16 hard emote clues that require tt items from hard clues. That's a 25% chance of a bad clue. If you don't have access to trading then it makes the clues impossible to complete. This is a trait that is shared by no other clue tiers. 
---
Imagine getting to step 5-6 and this happens to you. Its a waste of time for players. 
---
Implying I watch any OSRS YouTube content that isn't Swampletics
---
Next up: Jagex bans use of RL dev mode &amp; patches randoms.
---
After recently mixing my ultimate color palette, I’ve decide to up the spectrum
---
Downvote everyone els posting his video on here
---
Yeah I agree the community is too split on this for any meaningful updates to go through right now. Excluding pvp is just dividing the votes even further and with the recent pvp polls being voted down I see this just as more spite than anything. People are afraid of change when I think it would be refreshing and interest more people
---
I say use the Runelite feature for the bog, please don't be a masochist and do the bog regularly 
---
But the aesthetic mannnnn
---
no rewards will pass a poll that will make the activity actually played.
---
Oh god, I am ready. Take me now my sweet prince.
---
awesome thanks
---
Needs small 2xp drops above the bridge
---
Yea, but I don't have the quest reqs, I'm finishing up 99 runecraft before finishing up quests.
---
cmon mate give us a ring
---
You were wrong
---
3 months ago with those stats? I call either botting or severe autism
---
Is there any proof from the devs about this?
---
S 
---
Who has made that outro pic? Its so fucking awesome..
---
No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania
---
Implying I know anyone who isn't Swampletics
---
Meanwhile there is a couple dozen posts asking who Swampletics is... 
---
The average KC for a drop is 17.4 according to the wiki if you kill all brothers.  42 is pretty unlucky, but not outrageous.
---
Hard.
---
Too bad real world trading is against the rules. I’d sell these for GP! 
---
That is the perfect opportunity for him to take your items. Do not do this.
---
Great Easter egg on the wiki browser with "dopamine" on the other tab! 
---
Why is hunter the bottleneck for ToB?
---
Oh my god look at all those dopamine colors.
---
Keep it in mind bud, and keep up the work You managed to sum it all up perfectly haha. 
---
No banking, no trading, but this time, I can't leave Morytania.
---
Just bad luck, keep at it. 
---

---
The general consensus is rc over 77 &gt; agility &gt; rc under 77.
---
Yeah but they’re not in Morytania
---
Rellekka course is like 52k/hour instead of 55k/hour tryharding at seers, way comfier you probably click half the amount 
---
He's doing a moritanya locked ultimate iron man, and the videos are informative, exciting, and just entertaining as heck.
---
Please daddy yes
---
Definitely autism. Between my full job and not having responsibilities, it's definitely a mental deficiency.
---
Is it possible anyone of you can link me the wallpaper at the end?
---
Just in time for the third cape of the series, but this time from a different account. Incoming: SETTLED 2
---
All leading up to eventually taking on one of RuneScape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.
---
How exactly would Jagex know unless you recorded it like he did here? Also is there any proof this is bannable, just for argument sake?
---
yes mate lets do it on the down low, my rsn is swampletics pm me lol
---
MEET SWAMPLETICS 
---
Welp, never mind then lol.
---
Carrying an anchor an being able to run
---
Would you be making figures at some point? Like figures of Dharok/Verac/etc?
---
Yeah I just don't want to. Not a fan of ZMI, and it feels kind of wasteful on my ironman. Particularly since I don't have a huge stockpile of pure ess right now. For now I've been basically making cosmics, natures, and laws as I need them, and that's about it. If I stockpile enough ess for 77 (from Gargoyles etc.), I'll probably just grind it out though.
---
If he dumped 107m flax into the market all at once surely it would drop.
