Obby cape is objectively better but if you want an inferior cape, gratz I guess

On the recovery attempts... If you're no longer in the geographical area where the account was created/played most, it becomes nigh impossible. If you have indeed moved, I'd recommend looking into visiting home, sending it in via Teamviewer on a computer which is there, or using a very private VPN.

A guy in my cc got a claw drop on his 2nd raid with 20k total points a couple days ago as well. I definitely thought this post was by him until I saw the date in game, gz.

And gg your new account

This sub is cool most of the time and probably has the best memes out of any gaming sub, but we are disproportionately hivemind-y compared to other subs, imo.

To tack on this, doing quests without guides also helps

Thanks! I'd believe that and will work with those figures.

I've got a torso or two in my time but would ideally be looking to create a group of individuals that all want to achieve the same thing and would be willing to set a time and grind it out (like on the weekend or two sessions of a few hours each). Might just hit up some rounds with randoms at some point to get my head back in the game.

Geez, hostile much?

You need level 50 fishing to atleast wear bronze and use a fishing net though.

I'd like to see a GoT inspired quest where you could inherit a throne.  Maybe a reward could be having villagers collect items for you in exchange by putting money in the kingdoms coffers.

God speed.

I tried; stilll dont work

Is this because OSRS has worse security, or because there is more to gain from hacking an OSRS account than other popular games?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Like if you hack a league of legends or fortnite account, there's nothing you can do besides fuck with their mmr. WoW is probably the only "popular" game where hacking someone actually matters, and I haven't played it long enough to know how common it is.

Abyssal bludgeon or dagger if cost is an issue.

Duo is just as easy as trio once you learn how special attack cycles work. There's 0 reason to do 4:0 in duos.

If you're not moving your cursor at all, unless you're guessing, then you had to have looked at every other button for all 4 numbers, which is basically the longest time you could spend doing pin.

The screeching of the armadyl crossbow is the best noise this game has to offer as far as special attacks go

Never once said it didn't require skill you brainlet. And I have yet to have someone give me an example of a super skill intensive part in the inferno. The majority of the inferno is learning mechanics and learning the layouts of waves, which it turn becomes muscle memory (an example would be Zulrah). If you would actually read anything I have said you would have realized the point I am making...
---
STILL a problem :(
---
What cb are you? Your stats seem a bit low, overall most pkers get 85 mage for tb and then often 94 magic for barrage as well.
---
Stats depend on what combat bracket ofcourse you want, some people like baby pures some like maxed, some like somewhere in the middle in the 70-80cb
---
You're obviously not very bright, there is very little value in arguing with you.

You said my thoughts on BP vs Scythe were subjective, no it is not. BP is indisputably broken, no matter what you compare it to. Perhaps I should have worded it even more simply for you, I apologize.

&gt;Your argument was that balance was suggestive.
---
Maybe I needed to say your argument based on my opinion on BP balance was suggestive. Sorry you already forgot we were specifically talking about the BP, I did not realize your memory is extremely short term...

I have, and it was fixed to an extent. It went from logging me out and every time I hopped worlds then making me put in authenticator to making me put in authenticator every 1-2 days. It’s better, it’s not fixed though.

GoT is one of the worst shows I've seen. Tried 3 times and couldn't get pass 25 minutes of the first episode. It was just awful.

I use blessed dhide, anguish, assember, i use gaurdian boots, archers ring i. Never attempted skipping but i knew it was possible.

I might try rune darts my next task. Do you think crystal haberd during the last phase would be better then just using whip. (Dont have money for d claws)

Cool! I'd be down to join and help you guys out and teach all the tricks whenever you guys  are up to it :)

Get some scrotums of your own and take out the opposing scrotums. Or just cry about it on reddit instead of having fun in game, that works too.
---
Nice dude, I've been playing for 5538 days and I still don't have 3 cowhides.
---
I'm not trying to belittle maxed players, in fact that's a very big accomplishment. I was just thinking why don't the max capes go with the best in slot items? I have no idea what his real intentions were, even though he got his infernal cape 2 days after he posted that suggestion. He even mentioned at one point that he doesn't have a Max cape, so it wouldn't have even effected him anyway. I thought it was a solid suggestion, and apparently so did others because his post isn't at 0 (it has like 300 or so last I checked). I also think it's funny how many people are so invested in it, considering not even 10% even have maxed capes anyway.
---
He's already apologized multiple times and has tried to stay transparent about it all and most of the community is attacking him still. Poor guy was just making an innocent suggestion (like everybody else on this subreddit) and everyone jumps 10ft down his throat.
---
lol pls

I don’t know tbh the Reddit one sucks afaik but imgur doesn’t zoom in on mobile so it’s all just blurry for me.

If you plan on just grinding out the set you don't even need to reduce your weight. With no armor you can get full graceful around 57 Agility at Canifis, you don't lose run energy.

Came here for the punchline. Am very disappointed.

Even when we dont play runescape we browse the 07 reddit constantly

yeah i got magic to 43
---
So this is slightly unrelated, but every time I go to the ge and report the spam bots.  Mostly its so my public chat actually is readable, but also for game integrity.  However this process feels fruitless as next time they are just replaced.  For me I feel there should be some system that follows up with you on your reports so it feels like you contributed.  Something just like "hey the report you made last week resulted in a mute" would be nice.
---
It's the Corsair SPEC-06, haha was looking at that one too though
---
... why is your tower on your mouse side???  do you play with 16000 dpi or something

I just got a clue where I had to go to the elf camp but did not have the quests to get there, so I stop doing slayer and proceed to do biohazard, underground pass, and start Regicide just to get access to there. 
---
Also I would like to say that this is a 5 step clue so far and when u get there I have to complete a puzzle making it my third one for this clue. I finish it and my reward is a rune battleaxe and some purple sweets. I probably invested 5 hours to this clue.

Awwwww

I actually enjoy the series quite a bit. Maybe it's because I'm tired of all the Ironman, UIM, region locked IM,... videos which are really oversatured right now, but Kemp keeps his videos somewhat appealing. I think a lot of people would watch his videos no matter the content.

Over 100 bucks an hour. That's pretty good.

Fishing can be similarly afk

Huh? You should of already paid your taxes

Just curious, What client are you using?

I mean how did you get the cash without high level bossing? I made probably 100m from vorkath and it all went to skills and gear, very short for rigour though
---
Oh my god stop using stab attacks with your scimitar please

He might be alluding to that but you can buy bonds with actual $$. Then sell the bonds at the GE for actual GP.

Please do not be too concerned. You appear to be unable to pick up on what could be deemed as the most blatant sarcasm out there. I would recommend not being too alarmed and to contact a doctor or physician as soon as can be done.

Why do we accept this? Everyone bitches about it but we just take it and some even gargle jigglyflexes balls as if theyre a good company

I don't see what's shitty about not eating any food in almost all cases compared to eating cake every couple games?

Jad is the excuse, I've failed at a higher combat level before osrs even came out back on the normal RuneScape. Tried him about 7 times but failed each time but then again I was also a kid back then.
---
Why didn't you move the tome to the bottom of your inventory then? All your gear would have come out at the top of your inventory.
---
Stats?
---
How was it addressed? I’m genuinely confused why players would rather get something else than what they voted for.
---
He's been leeching barb assault for cash at 8-11m an hour. No need to rwt.

I don't understand why F2P has to be treated like idiots to the point where we'd assume they can't be expected to understand this just the same as members do.

Pets are a thing

But what did it cost?

when i was a noob i used to think you had to wear the camulet for this clue step, lol.

I was joking because he got banned for rwt on one of his accounts

As if you don't hold space bar anyways stfu

I think he’s talking about 100%ing it, not the story

What would be the smartest way to get myself to 83 con from 50 for max POH? I don't want the most expensive method, the most common one for a balance of XP and gp spending would be best. 
---
I've heard the max house is amazing for end game usage
---
what exactly was your thoughts as you were posting this?
---
is this really needed tho? we have 2fa and you still hav e a bank bin for your bank as last resort
---
Hm, I dunno if they changed up the PvP zones since you played but It's split into yellow's which are pretty much safe, no gear loss. 
---
Red's which you have to flag up in, but you can see on an entire map how many people are flagged so it gives you an idea of whether it's safe or not.
---
And black zones which are free to gank.
---
I haven't gotten high enough to even need to get to the later zones and I've been playing for a little under a week. I don't think red or black zones are really that dangerous. 
---
If people dismount they have like a 10 second cool down on ANY ability they have, so if you're out there already dismounted and gathering there's almost no way to get caught. Especially if you're gathering with gear intended on being able to get away, which is what you should do.

---
Should the Elemental Talisman be allowed to be made into a tiara, allowing access to all four elemental altars?
---
Should it be able to function as the talisman consumed for combination runecrafting?
---
They would understand it if it was explained to them, or if they sought out that information. But I think it's fair to assume that many people would do the one they get from x marks the spot, get 10 shrimp, say that was a massive waste of time and never do it again.
---
Its in the game, why aren't you using it is the real question
---
Did you try joining a guild? 'Cause I solo played and enjoyed it at first, then it started getting really tedious. I happened to join a good guild that does fame farm runs and basically power leveled me as a healer. You make a ton of money and level your gear really quick.
---
After my first couple runs I had enough money to buy an island which is another great thing that I probably wouldn't have had a chance to do as a solo player.
---
The issue was brought to the attention of the team, and that's how design staff decided it was best. Nevertheless, even though it's not literally what they asked for, given how it was, at the time, it's still true to what people voted for, in intent.

Join a clan.

What servers and time zone you play on?

Tupac cares if don't nobody else care

How do I know if I can take on high level NPCs? I am level 56 and can get through a fight with a level 100-120 quest boss with some food, how do I know when I am able to take on the big raid bosses or the big quests? this general haze of knowledge is the only thing i cant wrap my damn head around
---
If you wanted to make that a direct comparison, one of the foods would have to be not consumed.
---
I use it all the time. For everything.
---
GP/exp is the same across everything you build of a certain plank. The most common way is Oak Larders until Oak Dungeon Doors then those until 83/84. The only exception is Myth Cape racks which I havent looked into myself
---
US servers. Have a lot of free time this week so I'm open most of the time.
---
From what I understand the cheapest / most efficient way is oak ladders until you can do oak dungeon doors. I am currently working on the same thing as you lol

Yes

I believe in you.

That's what I thought but I went back and talked to the NPCs multiple times.. this quest is driving me crazy right now...

That shit made me chuckle

My only problem is the small prayer icons and how it's much slower to switch tabs as there's no hot keys (like pray switching while eating is really hard)

Dude you're retarded. This is definitely new. They wouldn't have reason to do this until the recent update.

As a Lyft driver, talking to passengers is a really good way to get a tip. Most people don't. But if you act like a normal fucking human to most people they really appreciate it. Obviously I've learned how to read what kind of ride a passenger wants in the first 10 seconds of the ride. If they don't talk then I won't. Plus it makes my night better

Just bring dragon ruby bolts

Gotcha, just hope for the uniques then

Just get to 60 for obsidian with dragon scimitar. Gotta start slaying

What?

i generally just do skilling when i have a good show on netflix or something to watch
---
Yeah, I figured looking at the drop table. Thanks
---
Using rune with a dragon long right now, haven’t done mm1 yet. Would that be more beneficial to go ahead and knock out for the scim or just use the long?
---
It was in a postbag from the hedge article and also in their pronunciation guide.

**YES**

Honest question - just started playing again for the first time in a couple of years and am back at it pking. I used to Tele to the duel arena to charge spec, but clearly that's not the situation anymore.
---
I don't have 65 construction, but it seems that the special portal in POHs is the standard now - is there a house that's always open in world 18 for this?
---
real chads alch them so they dont even have to look at them

Yo slaq, saw you earlier at GE asking what to wear to the funeral and I suggested a banner/black flowers. Hope you’re all good man, bad things happen to good people. Keep playing in his memory and have fun.

A bunch of people do 80-90 at Rellekka. I personally boosted for Ardy with preserve and full prayer gear and that went pretty well.
---
You have to farm and have 10 workers on herbs at your kingdom. It takes weeks or months of the above and any herb drops to get 69 because you will start slow. Make sure you do farming guild contracts for herb seeds.
---
Wintertodt is the strangest of them all. When all the iron men with sociopathic tendencies gather in one place, a cesspool forms.

I've played for 6 years so , it adds up.
---
Technically I suck at making cash cause most of my friends are 5b+ in the same length of time. I just don't  grind that hard
---
I've always wondered if wearing tights is even comfortable, all that cloth right in your asscrack
---
boosting at 86+ is decent
---
Woah thank you good sir. Do you know what iOS version I need to downgrade to to jailbreak these days?
---
Well then more legit lower levels would actually skill. They would still love higher but that's a price to pay for the integrity of the game
---
Wow, no wonder no one likes you. I don't even need to know you to know that.
---
Mixed in with classics such as "Will someone tell Joel to get on Skype?" and "East side is best side."
---
it's not something i'd grind for anymore till you plan to corp or tob.
---
you can/should melee vork generally, its about the same as ranging (minus bolt cost), it's nice to have void range for raids for really min-maxed setups. but not particularly good.
---
Big if true
---
To be able to design quests like these, do you think you need to be smarter than the ones doing them?
---
im pretty sure it's also a server stability thing. like with how worlds with lots of people in them lag more. if you got a large number of people spam hopping it'd put a lot of stress on the servers.
---
yes, yes it's aids af as an iron. do your 15/5 and then alch or fletch or something.

Don't even know half of these terms,  just started back up a couple months ago.

This is bs, I thought _I_ had dibs on reposting this one next
---
Irit just shouldn't be the most common/ abundant because its ge value was the lowest. It Was pretty silly for them to balance the drop table around ge price. (Also silly to give more than 1 herb seed per roll)
---
By no one i meant &lt;1%. But yeh you got me

Hope you two have a great time man!

You’re basically there

I havent even bothered trying. Ik I wont get anything more than aggravation and lost fire capes.

It looks so unpleasant

The other side

Thank me later....

I hop until I find a free world, fuck that
---
Your loot depends on your other skill levels, but in your case it’s just rng it comes and goes
---
I think the reward is based on your other levels. So higher farming gives access to higher seeds. Ect ect. Read the wiki page on the rewards.
---
Haha you've never kicked on to 4:30am at a mates house?
---
I don't do bossing a lot but I've managed to lazy flip my way to a tbow just a few days back.
---
I'm sure you can too with slayer/single bossing but ofcourse it'd take longer, i suggest you keep a notepad file of your bank value and update it everyday to keep track of your daily progress. It makes saving up to that 1b mark easier.
---
It's called RSN. IGN is a news site.
---
Yeah, that part I understand. I guess I'm just annoyed at going from great shit to nothing but shit. I can see how it comes and goes, though. I'll keep grinding at it and hoping for the best. At least I'm getting good xp in the process.
---
I just take one step away and drop them in between attacks while I'm fighting the kraken. Gotta be #efficient.
---
As soon as u do this, the pking spot dies. I know ur frustrated because people escape, but without that eacape, people wouldn't even go there. As soon as the best pker always wins, it becomes like dmm, where the little fishes stop showing up.
---
Apple user here (yes I do regret it, next phone won’t be iPhone) and the fact there’s no background app refreshing for OSRS sucks. If I go off the app for more than 20ish seconds I get logged out, so afk tasks like fletching, mining and so on all suck because I have to sit there and watch. I’d definitely grind mobile a fuck ton if they got the background app refreshing to be a thing, but it’s jagex and apple, so I doubt it.
---
It is, thanks. I used top quality black mushroom ink.
---
Hope I didn’t ruim my whole bank by buying that damn thing :p
---
You'd want to test it and see for sure. I would have thought that just running them all in parallel normally, allowing the cpu to manage them all together would be better performance than isolating cores, plus your cpu sounds like you could handle it.
---
I’ve seen the halberd hit really high. It’s just a slow weapon, which makes it debateable for better dps. Try it out. Save the spec for final phase though.
---
I’m wondering why you’re not using a boot switch and if you’re using a ring switch. I’d suggest camping either brimstone or b ring (I) and adding dragon boots/dhide boots.
---
Try out some quests, if you don't use a guide it can be pretty fun figuring out what you have to do. Probably a good idea to make sure you carry the required items from a guide with you though, saves a few trips and frustration.
---
Honestly with all the issues my 2014 ASUS ROG is having right now it still manages to run each game perfectly fine so I really shouldn’t worry. I’ll clean the computer soon and do a clean install of windows 8.1, but other than the driver issues it’s having and all else it does run each client perfectly fine, as it should.
---
or when u get a birds nest drop and it rarely makes the ACB spec sound, catches me off guard big time
---
:(
---
Lmao that’s what I thought was gonna happen
---
Really I hate MS. But Win10 sorts a lot of driver issues from the box, if you could upgrade it'll make your life a bit easier. Also there probably is a bunch of crapware on there too just eating cpu? I think there might be some runelite settings to turn the detail down or something to improve whatever performance issues your experiencing.
---
Same exact way that the ranged accuracy and strength arent multiplied by how many arrows you have equipped.
---
Want to talk to people... wintertodt is loaded with some interesting people, Barb fishing is a hot spot but since it's not really a dedicated world thing everyone is spread out. Once you get to higher level people chat in raids as well. I dont have that issue alot but it happens every now and then.
---
I wish bro, this was a few weeks ago. I’ve tried looking for it but have had no luck.
---
Well most people eat at least one thing so have space by the end. Even in barrows you mentioned you've completed all your loot drops to the floor on full inv
---
Dragon's are weak to stab, except wyverns which are weak to slash, check the wiki before each slayer assignment!
---
You don't need to wait that long to do dragon slayer. On my ironman, I was able to beat it in full iron (chain) with a rune sword and an inventory of salmon in f2p. My stats were around mid 40s for melee, around mid 30 magic, and low 30 pray (no overheads). I walked under elvarg to eat (to not get hit while eating) and I also attempted to pray flick (I gave up after a while).

Herblore is something you level up passively with herbs from farming, your kingdom and monster drops. I think it would take days if you just farm chaos druids.
---
it would effect nothing
---
Awesome, thanks, are you an ironman? I am curious on how to get the 77k essence I need for 77 RC.
---
There’s a difference between “illegal” and against the game rules.

I did 21k at Earth Warriors alone 😭😭
---
Give Stealing Creation plzD:

I’d rather 99 RC

fossil island is less crowded
---
Yeah I'm really happy Android doesn't have that, I can minimize the tab for several minutes and come back still logged in. If it logged me out that fast it would be pretty annoying.

I did my first elite for 150k before patch and the second elite for 3rd age ring. IM happy to do any elite.

They arent legal

nice this was really helpful! I have found the file and the lines. It does have some of my notes but appears it is not the most up-to-date one. I've recovered 90% of the things i wanted and 100% of the things i needed which is amazing. is there another place a newer file might be? or just cut my losses?
---
thank you very much! found it :))
---
Bruh I literally made this
---
Graceful with dust staff, prayer bonus gear,  and shield. Lunars for ourania teleport, 1 dose staminas in bank, rune pouch with laws, astrals, payment rune. Keep rapid heal up with regen bracer if you have it. Then it's the same as runecrafting through the abyss. Teleport to ourania after every run, every two runs sip a stamina, npc contact to repair pouches. It's pretty chill if you follow train or use runelite to two click to the altar. Exp rates are 30-35kish an hour, higher after 75 but I haven't made it that far yet.

Hi so I found about the 6 hour log recently. My question is: If I'm in combat and I get 6 hour logged out, will my character still be in combat after i get disconnected (similar to x-log) or will it totally disconnect/log out my account.
---
Stop a while at 70 def for a while and try NH brid'ing. My account was zerker until I realized edge and PvP world pking is not fun (and mostly a game of chance.)  The augury and rigour prayers are essential for doing so though.
---
Which of the two?
---
that was beyond dumb
---
That all helps a ton. Dunno if I can do the same grind you did in five days but I'd like to get this out of the way soon for sure. Thanks.
---
obviously things do, but it seems the 3a ring isn't that rare. If it was as rare as let's say a druidic top, it would've kept value.
---
I don't know why but the first time I ever walked from Lumbridge to Draynor as a kid has burned into my memory, and I still remember it to this day.
---
I'm too scared to even try that. Also I do not own a twisted bow x)
---
barrage 400k+ xp/h, burst 300k
---
I haven't reached the dharok point yet, but I'm currently 89 STR and 86 Hp and now reach 94k exp/hr using obsidian (with barrows gloves though). I did notice a lot of improvement from 85 to 89 strength, not sure why. But this should give you some insight in what to expect.
---
It was probably done in classic days tbh
---
Smart to keep banked staminas at one dose. Thanks for the help!
---
Is it just me, or was Drogon just chillin totally in range of the ballista?
---
Evil Bob screeching is up there as well.

i too played sly cooper on ps2

I haven't seen it so its new to me

I wanted to upvote, ut want to keep it at 420 :c

it's a great item at a few places, but it's not necessary anywhere.

Just do muds lol ZMI is aids.

Ouch!
---
The GE tele from Varrocks is an absolute game changer tho
---
I mean, bossing is the best way to make money, so that's where most people earn their money.
---
I have ~140m bank and the large majority is from herb runs, which are like 1m+ "effective" GP/hr.
---
Telling people in lumby I was giving them a “free 1 mil” then taking them to the wheat mill near the sheep farm, saying “heres 1 mill for you”.
---
One guy found it funny and we added each other and went on nooby adventures together, running around the wildy in a mixture of various bronze/iron armour we found hiding from a Rev in the bandit camp pizza shop.
---
Fun times
---
uhhhhhhh ive got 62 hours in the story and im quite sure im just a bit over halfway through. Not even 100%ing it either, just playing whatever quests i find fun
---
I remember those days, the progression of my bank went like this:
---
Hovering around 8-10m -&gt; rangers from med clue 15 -&gt; dwh from 600kc shaman -&gt; 3a chest from hard clue -&gt; 5 Zennys total from Gorilla tasks -&gt; passive money through Vork/Slayer/Zulrah -&gt; half of bank dumped for 99 crafting -&gt; 5m dumped doing lava rc -&gt; half again dumped for 90 herblore.
---
Now I’m back to square one, but at least I have some reqs out the way for solo CoX when I can be bothered to learn it.
---
Nope, master wand was just accuracy.
---
My #1 gripe with that episode as a whole. The entire Ghost scene seemed like it was CGI'd as an afterthought.
---
Click on your cannon balls use fkey to switch to mage book, hit tele grab, hit cannon,
---
Teleuse cannonballs on cannon
---
Bring dragon ruby bolts (e) for the majority then you’re supposed to switch them for dragon diamond bolts (e) at 1/3rd hp (250 hp). That way you’re doing the maximum damage you can per bolt proc. You’re losing out on damage if you just camp the dragon ruby bolts (e) the whole kill.
---
\*\*dies in alkarid\*\*
---
The only reason I stay on the highest skill total world is that there is a higher chance of an absolute Chad in the crafting guild dropping loot. 99 crafting was my first 99 and has so far been surprisingly rewarding minus the quick tele to bank.
---
Nah that's not gonna be worth anything sorry
---
happening in android too now
---
It’s certainly a cool username and all that but definitely not worth anything, it really boils down to if you find someone who reaallllyy wants that name.
---
Fire cape masterrace
---
May I ask why you made that decision? What are you planning to do with the money you currently have for a DB?
---
No you just got memed
---
I feel you, but it baffles me how people can play this game on these kind of resolutions. You have about 35 kilometers of space between your inventory and the center of your screen. It would rather knife myself in the dick than do so much wasted mouse movements.
---
You've clearly never played Uber bingo
---
Of course! 
---
And one other tip related to magic I might add, if you can afford it, get a rune pouch. It's so worth it when it comes to anything magic related, especially when doing things like tab making and PvM..
---
I'd rather take a cheese grater to my balls
---
What is this buying burnt foods thing about?
---
pleb use karamja gloves 3 or 4
---
make unholy symbols, gets you 50 crafting fast and sells for decent cash
---
I got the hang of it pretty quickly. Olm is overwhelming at first but I'm getting better
---
Always have it muted obviously. 
---
But when you come back after a really long break hearing that music is damn epic.
---
It has 0 mage defence

Well shit, why dont we all magically pull 100m out of our ass to buy our way through 2000 total lvl. (Im actually doing that right now lol, but yeah other people cant just do that...)
---
I had a problem like that, I got a new phone but my authenticatior was stuck on my old phone, and Jagex wouldn’t let me disable it. Such bs especially as I only enabled it for safety boots anyway. I eventually fixed it but the authenticatior is absolute crap and entirely flawed
---
People say hitpoints is the most important factor. As dharok's damage boost scales of it. 90 to 92 HP seems to be the sweetspot for switching to Dharok's.
---
You can try it yourself since an obby set isn't that expensive (you can sell dharok's and buy obby and see the difference).
---
look up "quest order list" and do some quests, go try training slayer, doing the wilderness slayer master early on can be some good cash and fun, set some goals for yourself. Do you want the full graceful outfit to gain more run speed? Go do agility rooftop courses, do you want to make passive money farming? Learn how to do herb runs, Do you want a cool player owned house? Look up some money making guides and train construction. The world is your oyster lol, id reccomend train at sandcrabs to get your combat stats up to 70/70/70
---
Hold left click on any corner of the application and drag it to make it smaller
---
If you are unable to find a team to go with, join the CC 'rad pvm' they will take you on a raid for diary but it will cost you 10m.
---
Shame you didn't have an emblem
---
It depends on what Jagex feel should be the intended price of a contract, what other updates impact seed prices, as well as general seed prices as well.
---
Realistically the best way to balance them is for the seeds to retain their value from other sources away from the seed packs (since giving more seeds just turns into a slippery slope).
---
It's also possible that seeds were inflated pre-Farming guild (in preparation for Farming Guild requirements) and they're now settling at a more suitable price. Clue scroll update did have a minor impact on higher seed prices (mainly from rewards).

Making money in F2P is very slow in general. There are some obscure ways to make money by obtaining low volume items and selling them for a high price. You can find some youtubers like Jakeyosaurus making money for a bond as F2P. However I would recommend buying membership and then make money as a member.
---
Al Kharid guards are one of the better spots to train combat, but there are more options depending on your levels. Cockatrice or minotaurs are good for lower levels. Hill giants are pretty good for med levels. If you’re higher you could try ankous or catablepons.
---
what's 15/5?
---
I havent done the quest but what if giving the npc who taught you to cook them a huge sum of cooked Karambwans would give you the ability to not cook poisoned ones.
---
Talking to him and asking to be taught to cook poisoned ones could revert the effect in case they're needed for something.
---
Long live pim brother, thank you for the comment

Range is the ideal prayer to have before Jad spawns because you can't visually react to range but you can mage
---
This season has been awful so many plot holes and plot armour.
---
I for one have had more than enough of that trend. But it is always up to the community
---
I can relate to this hard and its so cool. 
---
I gave a f2p player a bond during a giveaway one time and he had re-started playing the game. I told him he could add me and ask any questions he wanted during his learning times. He told me he didn't want to use the bond yet and he was going to wait until he was higher level and completed his f2p quests. Anyway as time goes by he asks me the odd question here and there (where is best place to train my range etc) - introduced him to the oldschool killing minotours in stronghold on security (what a throwback). Anyway a few weeks ago he pm'ed me saying he was going for a firecape and asked me loads of questions about invent setup and advice during the waves etc to which i replied to the best i could. He then continued to update me (wave 50 with 3 dose brew and 5 restores etc). I wished him gl etc and he replied saying he needed to logout for a few hours and calm down as he was nervous etc (extremely :cutenoobs:). Anyways he failed twice and managed to get it on his 3rd attempt. I logged in the next day and he just pm'ed me to say "i got it!!" and it was honestly such a cool feeling that he'd managed to learn the caves and get the cape himself and now is becoming a real grinder :P.
---
TLDR : i gave f2p player bond, he saved for while, used it, got firecape. Super cutenoob story.
---
More pics please! I wanna see your cute lil friend.
---
I feel like the boot switch wasnt worth it since gaurdian boots have decent stats. I do with to b-ring (i) already. 
---
My switch is fighter torso, veracs plateskirt, b-ring i, tent whip, d defender, fire cape, torture.
---
Finally a good use for pets
---
Didn't you watch the stream? They already called the FBI. RuneLite headquarters got raided. Many people died.
---
I’m saying the guys sounded like a reference to red skull from the MCU
---
It's also s good money making method
---
Seers(i) and eternal boots have no real effect, if you have the money get yourself a ring of the gods and some devout boots.
---
Magic accuracy is basically useless, and you want to be able to afk for as long as possible.
---
The offensive mage prayers are also useless since they only boost accuracy and thats as close to 100% as it gets already.
---
Thats about as long as getting 99 agility, and clearly more fun(If you aren't jebrim ofc).
---
I hop until I find an ironman
---
That's what alts are for :P
---
One time when I was in elementary school it was laptop day in class.  I don't remember what we were supposed to do, but whatever it was, my partner and I wanted to play Runescape instead.
---
So as the teacher's talking, we boot up Runescape but little did we know, our sound was all the way up.  Suddenly the sound of synthesizers, horns, and drums start blaring from our computer.  Everyone in our class started laughing, so my partner and I started to laugh too, hoping no one would know it was us.
---
We tried to close it, but the computers were so shit, Runescape froze on them so we were stuck with the login theme blaring on our computer before I forced a shutdown.

Theres only so much you can make from PvMing, even a maxed gear team blitzing TOB all day will only realistically pull 20m an hour including unique splits, anyone much wealthier either stakes or RWTs
---
I personally think its just the "Nostalgia" feeling and the minigames would die out a week after release. Most players are efficient nowadays compared to before where exp/ph EHP wasn't that big.
---
He stakes which is pretty much about luck... 
---
The best way to earn consistent money is doing slayer, bosses and raids.. however you will not make 100b, maybe 1 or 2 after a year of grinding...
---
lol aint even trusting ya self equip the fire staff
---
I would come for sure! My condolences!
---
Have you considered nerfing successful dragon warhammer specs to around 20% defence reduction? 30% is A LOT of reduction and outlier in terms of overpoweredness compared against other special attack dragon weapons

You dont need 99 prayer to stake lol

I played for 6 years from '03 to 09. About a year ago I got a message that my main had been used for botting and was now locked, oh well. Then last week I found out osrs was on mobile too, now I'm back and i can tell you, the excitement is back.
---
He's really not that cool but ok

I got it first day as well, 6.05pm GMT! Sold for 233m

Wow that’s actually so much better. You can actually do stuff like afk nmz on mobile and not get bored out of your mind. If I’m in combat I find that I can be out of the app for a little longer (30-45 sec) but it still sucks.
---
I'll add you when I'm next on!
---
The people in this thread should stay away from casinos
---
Can you increase the elite clue drop rate of alchemical hydra to 1/65 like Vorkath? Can remove the hard clue drop. Doesn't make sense that Hydra boss drops elites at a much lower rate than a lower lv boss, Cerberus.
---
As someone who is grinding for elites I'd like some variety:)
---
I suggested [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/66ng2q/suggestion_ability_to_cancel_tasks_from_this/) a couple years ago, it was brought up on a livestream and the JMods seemed to like the idea but it was never polled or mentioned again, can it be polled?
---
Someone taking 9s doesn't mean anything. The brazier breaking deals a lot more damage than the cold. A lot more being like 15 at max hp or some shit. Getting hit a 9 is probably just some 60 hp dude getting hit by broken brazier.
---
I once accidentally alched my magic secateurs it costs like 40k to get back lol
---
I don’t think “most” players play hyper efficiently these days
---
Can we have a NPC or boss that uses brid style attacks making us switch more and learn how to pvp and pvm better
---
Can we have the theatre of blood drop rates?
---
"Hey! I didn't say you can have that!"
---
When you can make 2M/hr at rune drags or brutal blacks while afk, then no revs are not worth it.
---
Just general things mate. Pretty keen on getting a ornate pool and fairy rings in the PoH. Not much into construction atm tho
---
Amber Baal (real one) was in the cc 2 days ago

There are some issues with the abyssal sire which could be addressed:
---
- Currently it is necessary to kill 4 respiratory systems with 50 hp each, as well as the 400 hp sire, but you only get 450 slayer xp from every kill. The slayer xp rates from killing the abyssal sire are already slow, so I don't think it would be unfair to include the health of the respiratory systems in the slayer xp granted by killing the sire. Basically the suggestion is to **increase the slayer xp from 450 to 600** (or it should even be increased to 650, as /u/GodHandFemto points out that the sire already has a 1.125 xp multiplier.)
---
- Currently, when you attack the sire to initiate its phase changes (the first at &lt;200 hp, and the second at &lt;140 hp) the sire takes no damage, even if the hit was successful. It feels awful when you get a 200+ xp drop but don't get to see any damage dealt. **Could you make these phase changes work more like zulrah, where the damage carries over?**
---
- The sire can spawn poison pools underneath you, which you have to avoid by running to a different tile. During the last and second-to-last phase, there are a ton of spawns and scions that surround you, making it difficult to click/tap the ground to move, especially on mobile. To fix this, **could you give the sire and its respiratory systems a "fight" instead of attack option?** Doing this would allow players to set their attack options to hidden/right-click only, in doing so being able to left-click or tap through the scions/spawns to avoid taking damage from the poison pools.
---
- Using shadow barrage on the sire stuns it for 20 seconds, but it can't be stunned again until the 20 seconds is over. This means sometimes you have to go to attack a respiratory system until the stun runs out, then go back and stun the sire before continuing to attack the respiratory system. **Could you make it possible to re-stun the sire before the first stun is over?** This would make it much more convenient, being able to better control when the sire's respiratory systems will be vulnerable. Credit to u/Pinuzzo for this one.
---
As others have said, upgrade for the bolts.
---
I only bought the DCB for Galvek in DS2 since the bolts gave me like 5 max hits over addy, I plan to sell it back since I can afford an ACB now.
---
For regular slayer, especially safespottable mobs like Wyverns, stick to rune/broads
---
Blue and white theme lol
---
Some people. Most people use thoroughly cooked karams for bossing. &amp; it’s not that it’s hard to hit number 2. It’s just easier to hit space which currently is defaulted to poison. Makes no sense.
---
Even so what the flhellcwere you using the slot for?
---
Trading or timing the market out of fear is generally a bad practice. If you have reason to believe a BIS will be replaced or dropped more commonly by an upcoming update then getting rid of it may be a good idea. Otherwise items’ prices float around a bit but is steady enough not to worry about it.
---
Haha it's funny cus she doesnt know it's RuneScape not roomscape xD
---
i agree. it should do this
---
I dont understand why they are even bringing up the idea to get rid of it. It would change pretty much everything about pvming. But i suppose i should be investing in more ppots now before d day
---
Not for plebs like me who can barely complete it in regular form, but for some people regular Inferno is not a challenge anymore.
---
Did you make this in scetchup?
---
Runelite's chat filter plugin will block all of this when pared with a list of regex to use.
---

Will ironmen be banned for using alts?

---
At least he got off of fortnite.
---
 Could you please take a critical look at the current lvl 75 weaponry and  change (raise) the level requirement based on damage output? Currently  we have weapons like the twisted bow and toxic blowpipe with the same  level requirements as the slayer's staff (e) or the trident of the seas,  even though they out DPS them in the majority of situations.
---
The fact that we're considering putting in an NPC to teach you how to cheese a core game mechanic should indicate something is amiss.
---
Imo they should remove flicking but halve PP loss rates across the board, to maybe compensate since they started balancing for it for some reason.
---
Happend to me too at 72 farming
---
Personally I'm not a fan of prayer flicking, like I said in the title I think it's very counter intuitive to how one would expect prayer to work, but at this point it's so integral to PvM that we 100% need to keep it. But since that's the case, there needs to be some way in game to teach players how to prayer flick.
---
Would a colourblind mode be feasible? Or could some objects be recoloured? 
---
A recolour isn't necessary, but would be a QoL improvement for colourblind players. 
---
Items/objects that could use a recolour are:
---
• Stamina pots/Antidote++
---
• Super restore/Super anti poison
---
• Range/melee phase at Cerberus
---
• Friends/NPC dot on the minimap
---
• Red chat on a clear chatbox
---
ouch
---
Why would there be a tutorial to teach players how to abuse the praying mechanics? Maybe the combat style would be a good idea however.
---
Of all the NPCs to represent OSRS, they chose the sandwich lady.  Sex sells I guess.
---
It actually has to do with the item being untradeable.
---
When did they discuss removing it? Last week iirc they said they want to keep it because of pvming like inferno.
---
Thats just sad.. xD
---
/u/67859295710582735625 posits the possibility that the subject, also known as /u/curtilous lacks the competence to equip a fire staff, and knowing his own incompetence, has instead opted for 5 incendiary runes as an alternative. this is comedic as the subject of his ridicule is failing to equip magic secateurs, and would perhaps (in theory) forget also to equip the fire staff
---
I’m aware, the comment thread was referring to the underground pass though.
---
Yeh you know, tedious going to CW to regen everytime than back to Edge for fairy rings
---
Fake, nobody plays RuneScape and has a girlfriend
---
i got to level 92 before i realized you could spam click to fast harvest
---
I feel the same way, but there's no way they'll remove flicking. Like you said, they balanced everything around it now, so to replace it, they'd need to rebalance everything.
---
Second this, this would really be a great QOL improvment for joining hosts.
---
I...never knew this.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
**The Hydra Tail Issue (2 of 2):**
---
As for the previous post, these are my OTHER 2 potential ideas for Hydra tail alternatives:
---
· What are your views on a Hydra Tail being applied to the DH Lance to make it a **“Cursed Dragon Hunter Lance”** and give back the hasta’s **+2 prayer bonus**? Applying it would also recolor the Lance red, similar to the first design version by Mod West.
---
· What can be done for a Hydra Tail combining with an Abyssal Whip to form the **\[Abyssal\] Bonewhip**? I think that the design for the Bonewhip should look more menacing and abyssal-like with a chemical glow. (Similar to those submitted by [u/deathlezz](https://www.reddit.com/u/deathlezz)). Polled stat changes are ok, but could be substituted for a **Passive Effect** based on the chemical glow selected (Not sure yet by how much would be ok):
---
o Default Red would have +4 Slash and +2 Strength
---
o Green would have +% Damage, but -% Accuracy
---
o Blue would have -% Damage, but +% Accuracy.
---
i see you point but nobody taught us how to prayer flick when we all started, we had to learn and adapt to each new boss, theres plenty of big Runescape youtubers out there and anyone starting runescape would surely watch some of them. Seems like itd be easy enough for them to figure out without devs having to waste time on another tutor just for flicking prayer on and off.
---
Should be Obby.
---
?
---
10 boots in 508 is well above the typical drop rate. Assumptions are that they are around 1:250 or 1:260 after the recent changes. Going double drop rate sucks, but it’s not overly rare.
---
Unfortunately since it's such an integral part of PvM, it's necessary to teach players how to use it. Since the devs want to keep it, there needs to be a way to learn it outside of watching the streamers.
---

Killing demons in the gated area under Karamja volcano and looting some guys rune med helm and addy armour when he died
---
Excuses smh
---
I think its good idea as it offers multiple play styles. AFK pray, lazy flick pray, prayer flick
---
getting ranger boots from their clue scrolls.
---
(fuck you jarrod you're not good your just lucky)
---
Set tele to outside and enter in build mode. Best option for now.
---
There's already a prayer tutor, so I don't think it'd be much dev time to include a simple chat option
---
You're barely over twice the drop rate and it's not uncommon to go 6-7x dry so you could very possibly be over 2000 clues without them!
---
PrtScn
---
Big oof
---
This. The biggest offenders are Tbow, Scythe, Blowpipe and Kodai Wand. Other more minor cases to look at would be Sang Staff and Rapier.
---
I guess but imagine how they would design it..
---
"ok guys you can now kill big boss, u must click ur prayer off/on really fast on time with the games tick rate in order to trick the system into thinking it's not turned on!!!" 
---
They need to change all of it, but I can't see Jagex ever making a tutorial on how to bug abuse their game essentially.
---
Can you make the projectile attacks in raids, such as olm's falling crystals, vasa's range attacks and tekton's lava splats, more consistent on when they will do damage during the animation.  
---
As it currently stands these attacks will do damage on different parts of the animation from one raid to the next. For example sometimes the falling crystals on olm will do damage the tick before they hit the floor whereas in another raid they will do damage on the tick they hit the floor. This is extremely annoying as it can cause you to take damage in one raid where you would not have taken damage in another.

I AFK woodcut or fish at work all the time and every once in a while my game will log out when my sounds on and I’m in a meeting or in another room and I start to hear the login theme play soooo loud and I notice everyone’s heads perk up wondering wtf it is and I sprint to my laptop to mute lol. One of my engineers immediately knew and now we pk together haha
---
Yeah i think they deliberately ignore this one because it's phrased too long for a QA
---
What
---
Hey, you take those watermelon seeds out of that junk pile. They stack and they are good farm xp! (Ironman btw)
---
Should have prayed the stuff...
---
Works so well, used to have a girl character and made like almost 2.5m/hr begging in total level worlds. Easiest money ever.
---
Are you looking for /r/RunescapeGoneWild?
---
But my money maker 😢
---
Got chain from regular dusties at 400kc and got my vissy from wyverns st 270kc.😂
---
I see how it looks on the character and I know it's shorter and it actually has little sleeves on character but I wanted to do it more like photo and a crop top kind thing. 😁 Trying not to show it all but still have fun with it 😂
---
More reasons as to why prayer flicking shouldn't have been kept in the game, but sadly here we are
---
Looks like he's busting a nice dance move
---
You're a spoiler
---
Nah, flicking is for end game, noobs don't need to worry about it. When they reach the point when they need to flick, chances are they will know how to do it anyways.
---
You sound like your job is full of middle schoolers
---
You can do basically 90% of the PvM content in the game without prayer flicking. By the time you're on to stuff like Inferno, you're definitely experienced enough to not need an in-game tutor.
---
I tried getting it, but it didnt work.
---
Please for the love of god jagex I’ve been asking since day 1 of hydra release, my ex girlfriend doesn’t even ignore me this much.
---
Anyways,
---
With hydra currently only way for it to be damaged by chemicals if it’s standing right on it before it comes, is there a chance to change it so it can be damaged if it’s walking into it as well?
---
ZeZimA
---
No, like everyone said, its kinda pointless, because its really not integral at all, except for maybe the inferno. I almost never pray flick, and do pretty much all end-game content besides ToB and Inferno. 
---
I get your just trying to help new players, but its really just pointless because its not a necessity.
---
Imma go ahead and call bs on this one, you wouldn't even have an onyx while going for the boost as you already made the zenyte gem.
---
Bitterkoekje dps calculator, should be easy enough to find on Google (check his twitter).
---
One of my other questions (which was maybe a little too long to fully cover) was answered only partially last week. I see no reason why they couldn't choose just one of these suggestions as a topic of discussion.
---
Huh???? 120 farm here...
---
You only need to have one tile between you and the crystal that's falling from the ceiling. Angle your camera so it's looking down at you from above (though not directly vertical, you'll find a sweet spot), then stand still and attack the head until you see the shadow of a crystal appear under your feet /within one tile of you, or until you see the actual crystal itself appear above you in the same positions. If you look closely you should be able to see the shadows appear a tick or two before the actual crystal shows up above you. This gives you some lead time.
---
Only then do you need to move, and you only need to more two tiles away, so there's one empty tile between the falling Crystal and you. You might wind up needing to constantly move every now and again due to RNG, but it you stay calm you should find that it's not too had to avoid most of (but not all - some simply can't be avoided) the crystals as they fall.
---
Whats good about 3a ring? Does it change your character model like ring of coins or something?
---
You okay?
---
Well he sent me a picture of his inventory with an onyx ring and a zenyte, don’t think he knew what he was doing.
---
Maybe an in game polling system?
---
Upgrade that mic
---
Just spam click the patch until your character rotates to the side a bit then snaps back to facing the patch
---
Not for long at least.
---
No trust here
---
It's not about the money, it's about sending a message.
---
Rest In Peace Captain Pim. May you find rest with God.
---
Looks like bonds to me
---
Don’t we all lose a bit of our health in rl when training agility
---
We should tell get human,  i don't have a facebook though
---
Its true. Works on herbs and allotments. Just spam click until your character turns a tinybit and then snaps back to facing the patch. You’ll harvest twice as fast
---
After I learned this, I felt pain seeing people drop their watermelons and snape grass. I wanted to tell them they could note it at the Leprechaun but by the time the items showed, they already left.
---
Do you work for them or something?
---
Dont. I have 87 range, and on task with slayer helm its fucken annoying
---
Truly. I wish i could do that but training my melee cus nmz sucks
---
Not too sure i just thought it was the best method in general
---
Horrible screenshot aside, the golden tench is fairly rare I suppose. You should average one every 15 hours or so, so not too rare.
---
Item that you would've dropped's high alch value &gt; price of a nature rune  = pure profit
---
If you spam click our crop until your character jitters, you'll harvest the produce faster.
---
You don't really have a better option. It's still fairly easy to get the tp off if you time it and aren't getting hit by 20 people.
---
Idk i play mobile. Idk how it is on pc
---
It also can’t be mined by members with more than 30 mining
---
Everything can be done without flicking though so they literally wouldnt have to rebalance anything.
---
Dude same! I was perfectly certain they would veto that shit. My solution was to earn a little money, give it to my dad, and ask him to put it on his card since I didn't have one. He asked me wtf a recurring membership was, I explained, and he said "oh sure like a magazine subscription." He paid for it himself, didn't mind at all.
---
If you like whiskey it's probably way cheaper here than overseas.
---
I think tweaking the numbers vs the pray bonus makes this an excellent idea
---
You should train your IQ level
---
Not if you're an ironman
---
Found his username, what was his post called?
---
Lmfaoooooooooooooooo
---
Bro install Runelite. It tells you the exact tile to dig at.
---
I started my Farming grind yesterday. God bless this post for all these tips.
---
They need to translate it to correct English first

Can we see some quality of life updates to trouble brewing:
---
* Currently there is no close by bank so if you forget something you will miss a trouble brewing round, and you will have to wait possibly for 20 minutes.
---
* Make it so that your stats and run energy reset after each round, as the game is right now you may start the next round of trouble brewing with decreased stats and run energy.
---
* Implement the same mechanic trouble brewing has for filling buckets of water for when dumping stuff into the hoppers and kettle. Right now it's super tedious to individually click on every single item and then on the hopper. It's even worse with the kettle as it has a cooldown timer.
---
* Make it possible for people to wear full graceful in trouble brewing.
---
* Show a timer when the next Rum is going to be produced, it's really difficult now to plan stuff out in trouble brewing because you are not sure when the next rum is going to be made.
---
* Increase the amount of points for each bottle of rum successfully made, decrease points from buckets of water and give like 25 points to the winning team. Right now there is no insentive to actually play the game as you get nothing from winning and barely anything from brewing rum.
---
Isn't that the gp value to alch all those seeds so 24 natures?
---
Shocked how many people don't know this
---
I plan on it. Everyone says yeti but I feel like it’s still just as cheap as the snowball.
---
‘Risked’ on a normal account where u have 1 hour to get your items back.
---
If you were a HCIM u would’ve ‘risked’.
---
Pathetic normy btw
---
Camoose
---
Dwh is another rare bis that dropped 10m from peak, yet items like arcane, elysian, tbow havent budged when they all follow a cycle.Weird market indeed :/
---
And if dropping the note what's the point in dropping it to save that 1 inventory space over keeping it.
---
I haven't farmed watermelon in months but I still have over 10,000 in the bank and I use them to make ultra compost and protect pineapple plants now that I'm 99 farming and going for the pet.
---
Ill make sure he reads this, thank you brother
---
Look figured this was you Stoner
---
look at it this way, at least you realized it before you got past half way
---
Don't think anyone's heard from him since 200m all.
---
You're a fucking god. I never knew this. I literally just cleared out like 70 items rofl. jesus christ this is amazing.
---
That's fairly accurate.
---
Something else to note, on the Wiki the image of the grid is different to mine in game. On the wiki, the dots that are blue and red are both grey?
---
Thank you very much!
---
I feel like I get more herbs with my dramen staff on ffs feel like the magical shitters don’t work half the time 😂
---
Is it easyscape that RS3 can have this on a toolbelt and still have its boost applied?
---
For over 7 years Blizzard ran the pinnacle of MMOs with the pinnacle of customer support... as their only game that was online and had any support.
---
Actually it might be even longer than 7 years.
---
Near instant live chat online, no longer than 15minute waits on the phone outside of Christmas time, servers hardly had issues, so on and so forth.
---
Let’s not make excuses here.
---
Look up Dragon Slayer 2.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Similar to the Ring of Suffering option, can we poll for an option to toggle whether a Serpentine helm will have a chance to give/block venom/poison damage? When disabled it won't use scales. This could require a dialogue so that it can't be done during combat, making it less possible to be abused. Things like getting KC for bandos is a waste of charges and can be annoying to juggle food on the ground and unequip during
---
Yes, but remember to wait until his hp bar disappears, or he will hit you.
---
Omg yes please. I’m at 2,800 sire KC and it’s a grind. I’d appreciate some love for this boss lol
---
Relatable. My girlfriend told me “You always get so excited for those videos of Swamplegs” lol
---
I’m tired of it too because slayer is in a pretty perfect state right now and already has almost all dev time devoted to it.
---
So what the sire can be a little annoying. Maybe let them focus on the other 99% of the game that frequently goes ignored.
---
&gt;At what point do 3rd party clients effect game integrity?
---
Uhhhh idk where you've been dude but they have been affecting game integrity for years. 3rd party clients need to be banned and have needed to be for a long time 
---
Inb4 "but jagex needs to implement muh mAnDaToRy features"
---
Can we add a bank pin to the login screen?
---
I'm still blown away that removing such a massive part of the game was their solution to all the gold farming/botting.  I'm so happy it was all undone.  I have no doubt Runescape would be dead currently if it had remained - and OSRS likely wouldn't exist.
---
I was like 70 magic too lmfao
---
I really like how the mini map is just a TINY bit crooked.
---
Havnt you tought they might have seen it and tought hell no do they dont bring it up?
---
Reminds me of my mom calling my gamecube a cubegame
---
Wouldn't this version be inferior because this lava is cooler than the original?
---
i am combat level 61 with relatively low stats elsewhere. I was thinking about doing slayer for making money, is this viable? I like the idea of the chance of getting loot that sells for high GP. THanks for taking the time.
---
Aw i see. This is what the rune pouch is for, for me. Combo runes for all four elemental runes and laws. You can now Tele everywhere in one inv spot
---
Perhaps this has already been asked, but with mobile supporting higher FPS is this something we can expect to eventually come to the PC version?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/wWCmAmi](https://imgur.com/a/wWCmAmi) 
---
This was today, I'm not enjoying doing the inferno anymore. So this is all you're getting.
---
They would never do this because often when they “put something on the backlog” it means they are never actually going to finish that update but want to avoid outrage.
---
I'm 99 and didn't know 🙃
---
Yeah pretty much, they've basically won the lottery with what they did to the game in the past compared to how much money it brings in now
---
Tbh the transitions are the worst part of that boss. Avoiding the glowing tiles is boring. I wish I could deal damage while avoiding simultaneously
---
Ah so it’s been put on the backlog
---
12xp per block (Mining)
---
8xp per block (Crafting)
---
So going off base 77 you would gain
---
3.8M crafting xp
---
5.8M mining xp 
---
Hope this helps
---
And boss pet dry streaks :D
---
Did any one else notice someone called about a rs player whos a severely handicapped paraplegic?
---
No rune pouch?
---
Why can't we extend this time to once every 3 months or half a year?
---
Best of luck, you've got my upvote.
---
Rust zacht jongen.
---
I guess the strat I'm using kinda works
---
Too much focus on PVP. Economy is actually good if you can handle the pvp parts, but it gets tedious. If they actually added an equal sized PVE portion to balance things out it would have ended up better.
---
Every time I die before Zuk, I feel this

Can verziks stab defence be reduced so rapier has more use? Slot of it's uses were replaced with the dragon Hunter Lance. This change would make it a nice middle ground between whip and scythe
---
I would just pay with my phone credit and barely use my phone lol
---
Good idea. I’m sure the skilling community would appreciate this too!
---
Cerberus is an option though. If you are only 60 slayer, you havent killed enough hellhound to even complain lmao. I'm sitting at 91 slayer right now and hellhounds are such an easy, free xp task that I prefer them just because i can afk them.
---
I'll bring a cannon, guthans for switch, super combats, and just sit under my cannon and afk the whole task. They have such low defence that I eat threw them without a problem.
---
Almost 41 farming going the easy route (questing to 32 FTW) thanks for the advice. I usually just click once, wait for it to finish then use my ultracompost and plant another seed.
---
Playing a lot. And getting donations.
---
I'd normally be using a draymen staff or a wc ace cos of tree runs at same time
---
I mean I would like to have someone to shoot the shit with when I play.
---
I'm a returning player who quit before 70 cbt back in 2010, and I started agaib about a week or so ago. Hmu if you wanna chat in discord or smth.
---
I think I’ve heard they don’t want to do this. They ban in waves and try to make it unpredictable for the bot creator to know when/why/how their bot was detected
---
Thieving needs to be at least one tier lower.
---
Goblin boys don't even know. They'll find out with the quickness.
---
Ye u right, the moss giants boss might be morw fitting
---
It's definitely not that much, are you accounting for the fact that each dense essence block makes multiple fragments?
---
good idea lets make ppl lose their banks because of dcs and server issues
---
3lven dude, stick to making solid YT videos instead of inadvertently shouting out shady RL forks

Hydra solo boss being camped too heavy, supply is up so its pushing prices down. It’s still a crazy amount of gp/hr even without claw drops

Only for remappings that your OS supports, which, admittedly, is a stupid restriction.
---
Venezuelan pesos. So like 3 bucks probably.
---
Exactly though, it’s one slot for a tele, like ectophial, and you need the full graceful for the decent period of time you’re picking herbs and crops for the regen boost
---
Whys this a troll?
---
big f
---
sometimes if you don't time it right it doesnt take. it tricked me into thinking you had to constantly spam click to get it to harvest fast but you really just need to hit it like 4 times as you start the animation.
---
Warding in Z-tier.
---
this... changes... everything.
---
Buy mith darts and afk at sand crabs. Can easily get 75 in a few hours. Rcb is so shit there. If not blowpipe you should use a karils bow, as it is much more dps than rune cbow and has longer range
---
Still under drop rate, just keep grinding!
---
Let's say you do have to use prayer in this new thing while gathering resources. That's less concentration and accuracy you have when trying to click on whatever resources your gathering WHILE prayer flicking? That puts someone flicking at a huge disadvantage possibly. The pendulum swings both ways. You don't just get to prayer flick with 0 opportunity cost. It costs time, mouse clicks, and a decent amount of concentration.
---
Have you tried duo nylocas? It's almost an entirely different room compared to trio/4man. Even without trio/4man scaling it's the hardest room to duo (xarpus can be harder, depends on specs/gear/meleeing). I can't imagine bloat/nylocas/verzik going well at all. I'm sure it is possible to do scaled deathless duos, but until I see it I will just assume it isn't doable. It's probably easier to do consistent solos than consistent deathless 2+2 ToB.
---
WoW can do it, why can’t Jagex?
---
No excuses honestly. They made millions in revenue. Time to invest in some real player support.
---
there's a bug on reddit mobile where you can hit submit and it'll post it x number of times.
---
Why
---
By what metric are you measuring his 'decline'? All of his Mory videos have similar views.
---
I would agree if not for wintertodt.
---
You can't complain when you are less than the drop-rate
---
I agree, back then subscriptions weren't a thing either. I wouldn't dare ask my parents for a WoW membership. In order to get runescape I had to sacrifice my birthday present that year, and when my dad forgot to cancel the auto-renew I was so excited the following year.
---
It's a pain in my ass on my main and ironman lol
---
Gives bonus 10% yield on herbs, allotments, hops, grapevines, and also yield higher tier herbs from herbiboars. When magic secateurs are left in inventory (not equipped) they don’t provide bonus, so equip it.
---
Is this supposed to make sense?
---
Also how do you not pick up on these things after watching hundreds if not thousands of other players doing runs alongside you. Like do people think everyone is just running quickly to talk to the tool leprechaun for fun in between their harvests? Or that everyone is wielding the secateurs cause they look cool?
---
When I see a bunch of people in the game doing something I don’t normally do, I go look up why they are doing it.
---
Ibans has a higher max hit at low levels but tridents attack speed makes it better
---
I thought that was Alkan.
---
So you're saying you need to camp justiciar to have enough brews for zuk? Mate, if anything that just shows that your waste brews during waves since you have no idea how to do them without unnecessary damage
---
Well having one anguish makes it a bit faster to get another zenyte and onyx :)
---
This is why I don't host. I'd host when bored for teles otherwise.
---
Around 1.5m mining xp and 2m crafting XP assuming 11.5m RC XP :)
---
This ending is like a Christopher Nolan Level ending for a video, gratz on the achievement and on playing with reddit, J-mods and people around OSRS for a week before release !!
---
Can we make pure essence F2P? Right now it is f2p in the sense that you can buy it at the GE, but my F2P Ironman can’t get any that way and it makes runecrafting even more tedious than usual.
---
Yeah sorta. If a f2p account has above 40 attack/def or above 1 prayer they’ll be at a big disadvantage to the optimized accounts. You can still get kills of course but the fights will be weighted against you from the start
---
Just look on the wiki for the monster, it lists their attack speed
---
I believe they mean the (medium?) diary reward of 5% chance to get 2 blocks at once. you only get xp for 1 block
---
thank u sir!
---
Bro you can carry 2147000 cannonballs in your inventory, there is no logic in this game LUL
---
I just realized this... 94...
---
Bit lost on what to do with the game atm, currently in nmz training
---
This throws me back to the days where we didn't have the wiki and no one really knew shit about efficient play, you'd find out little tricks like this all the time all by word of mouth from more experienced players.
---
Wheres the sounds for ice barraging dust devils/necheryals at?
---
Same with subprime mortgage backed securities. Smh
---
Your comment above is false. Go look at bond prices over the course of 2 years

It’s definitely on the wiki

[Mine's based off how easy/fun it is to train and how useful the skill is for what I like to do in the game.](https://i.imgur.com/IIiUmwO.png)
---
What kc did you get pet on?
---
Unless you’re an Ironman don’t charge the orbs. It’s not worth the time invested compared to the money saved
---
Yes, I think this is correct.
---
This comment section shows how people get scammed. People have no idea about the game.
---
what an interestingly small horse
---
For F2P ironmen the only way is to craft and enchant it from scratch, yes.
---
You are right, that is the only way in f2p.
---
Yea but look at all that free cons exp
---
True lol.
---
No
---
Damn I need to search by new sooner.
---
Inb4 you dont. You dont harvest unless secateurs in invy.
---
Until you get to diary progression, rc doesn't do anything for an Ironman account.
---
Sell ur nans crocs
---
thanks, guess I have some crafting to do
---
I'd be onboard with it. I actively do not do sire on task because it is pretty tedious to fight.
---
I just wear it to not take up a slot. Since you tele right to the patch you run less so you don't need graceful as much. The lower weight is the best part about it but like I said just the cape won't make or break it. The bonus isn't in effect while you're running to the patch and you only stop for so long. I did all the way to 70 farming without graceful and I manage
---
Might be a begging alt
---
BC people posting panic questions like "Why is Lance dropping so hard suddenly?" on reddit
---
according to the p2p RC training page on the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_Runecraft_training#Crafting_blood/soul_runes_in_Arceuus_(77%E2%80%9399)), You would get 1,235,000 mining xp from 77-99 rc if you immediately moved on to soul runes at 90. This experience will be slightly lower if you have part of the kourend diary done as one of the tiers gives you a 5% chance to get 2 blocks at once instead of 1, however it only gives experience for 1 block
---
You won't have a problem at those stats. Just take the best weapon and armor you've got and a bit of food and you'll be fine.
---
tbh I really like the farming guild. i didn't do much farming except to get quest recs til it came out. it's just nice to have everything there so you can get the feel for different crops without spending half an hour running around the map, plus you get seed packs for farming contracts. Makes it feel more manageable. Just look at the highest level things you can plant in each patch and play around in the farming guild. theres a nearby fairy ring, and the skills necklace puts you right inside.
---
At work currently, go home shower jerk myself off cause I’m lonely, go to wt and hope Joel gets on skype

---
Shoutouts to ya boy Coby.
---
Cool
---
I'll add you my man. Yeah I'm from the U.K.
---
I mean there is a lot of faster turn around content you can do like allotments, herbs, giant seaweed, etc. I am not sure of what kind of exp rates you can expect but it’s certainly a non-zero amount, if you wanna be more active. Other than that, not sure there is much you can do.
---
72 crafting and 68 magic is kinda tough to get before you wana start farming though.....

You'll have to speak up i'm wearing a towel.
---
Are you happy with how skilling fits in the current economy? As someone who likes gathering resources at their sources, I find it super disheartening that the most efficient ways of getting logs (for example) is from killing monsters.
---
Well with that logic nothing is necessary anywhere, you can just prayer flick everything in the game use a r cbow.  It greatly speeds up kills, is cost efficient and BIS in tons of places for ffas, preventing crashes, etc.
---
Haha hes dating your mom
---
I know someone who got it on 1 KC
---
Thats... intresting. Ill deffo have to use all these Calquats i have from contracts there now.

get range to 75 for bp and do ds2 for vork although you'll want to get your other stats up too. other than that barrows, giant mole, skotizo would be doable if you can get dark totems/arclight. hespori once you get farming up which honestly won't take that long if you do tree/fruit tree runs.

I think he needs to hit the gym.

Pretty sure when you complete the quest it specifies that you have to equip them. Learn to read lol

Added. Thanks.

&gt;Ya i do my Allotments from Sweetcorn + with flowers if i have seeds. with at least 3-5 herb runs a day with my houses and seaweed. thing is im going to get 99 craftin from seaweed banked before i get farming by a long mile.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Kinda dont want to delay the 99 crafting if i can help it due to how nuts the cape is
---
Herbiboar bumps it up a tier IMO
---
I would ask my friends to play on their accounts. It went as far as I would be playing on my friends cousin's brother account who lived across the country. I played on so many different accounts its amazing actually. Only time it sucked is we all tried to get on at the same time(after school) and only 1 of us could play and I would always be the 1st one kicked off
---
Can the blurite sword be obtainable after the quest?
---
Myth cape (mounted) from 47-99 is ~86.8m. 
---
Mahogany tables from 52-99 is ~184.4m. 
---
Oak dungeon doors from 74-99 is ~78.6m.
---
Screw titles. They always end up meaning nothing and just add clutter and wasted dev time.

Great idea if you want to melt the phone!

Dropping 200m or...?

With games like WoW I always tried to pull the 'Buy it and pretend I didn't know there was a monthly subscription fee when I get home' method. It never worked. I always ended up returning the game.

You can animation cancel compost pouring with planting a seed about one tick into the animation, but not the other way around

You sound like you need an ironman.

RemindMe! 4 hours
---
In all honesty that's super depressing; I love osrs, but my highest skill is only 83 after a few months of playing\~I can't imagine the sheer amount of time sitting at your computer that it would take to get 200m in \*one\* skill, let alone all of them, and moving onto an alt.

Source: Have 11m total xp on my account loll.

Who is this guy?

Yeah okay buddy

Probability doesn't stack additively like how you assume it should be 70% otherwise itd be guaranteed at the 3,000th kill.

Formula is 1-(chance of not receiving)^(#of kills)

The drop rate is 1/3000, but not everyone gets it by then. About 63% receive at drop rate.

Its on the accuser to prove what is accepted wrong lol. But i have done it in the past to confirm myself.

A whopping 200gp per

Like MTX and Subscription models are the only pricing models that exist. I'd suggest paying 40 dollars for lifetime access, but of course that wouldn't happen because there are lots of addicts that pay more than 40 dollars on it, and it would be a stupid business decision.
---
 Now, onto multiple accounts - of course you would not be able to access two accounts at the same time. That would be ridiculous, though maybe you could upon reaching a certain total level, like 1600. At that point mains should have enough money to fund their pures , and that would be a good way to revive PKing, since players can experiment more, not be deterred by the price, but hey, you can only dream.
---
Can you drop items as an Ironman and have a regular player pick them up? TIL.
---
There were some design flaws, like how SC generated maps and its spawn camping problem, but overall I wouldn't say the minigames themselves were bad. That said, the community did it for rewards back then and that is even truer now, but I wouldn't say that is a fault of the content. If they were to come back, I doubt they'd be exactly the same and they probably would be minigames based on the concepts rather than faithful recreations.
---
So you comment has so many flaws. 
---
1. You created your own quote out of nothing I have said to try and make an illogical point 
---
2. You are asking me to create a minigame in which I never said there needed to be a brand new one 
---
3. This post is about implementing a former/new minigame so that there is a variety to the game. 
---
4. To answer your question, I absolutely could create a mini game, but that’s not my goal.
---
Lol roomscape is the exact same thing my gf calls it.
---
Just an interesting thought.
---
They shouldn’t have to reprhase is it jmods actually took the time to read it it explains everything thoroughly and provides a solution to every concern. 
---
There is no reason that jmods shouldn’t address sire it’s not designed well and needs fixed

My little girl ame up to me a few days ago while I was playing mobile "Daddy, whatchu playin?"  'Runescape, baby girl.'  "Roomscape?"  'Yep, that's it.'
---
Well yes, it has a few uses in "have x FM lol"...
---
Rc is F tier because it's just running back and forth, arguably worse than FM, but at the end of the run, you feel like you did more than just ***literally*** burn money. You made runes, that someone will just use up, like always.
---
Agility is a lot of clicking and is pretty fucking boring, from what I've seen, but yeah, it's useful, you can run more (as if members need to run that much when they have a billion of teleports) and can go through certain areas, especially in wilderness, since pkers aren't likely to have 70+ agility, meaning you can just run away by having it up high, lol.
---
No lol reddit doesn’t represent a large portion of the game at all
---
dream mentor bosses?

I know it takes engine work to do but add some system to sell and split loot on GE or some other method of splitting loot. The fact that group PvM is so susceptible to scamming is honestly unacceptable.

more like I NEET it

With Elf content coming and the rewards polled being not too well received. I think there's position to poll a korasi variant weapon. Magic based melee weapon that scales off of strength. Obviously balanced better than before. Elf questline seems great for a stat requirement. Keeping select pk builds viable and possibly opening new ones/empowering more lackluster builds.
---
1. You can paraphrase in a quote
---
2. I meant that instead of proposing Jagex start working on a general concept, you could put in the effort to make up an idea of something you think that would work

104m/90= 1.15m a day. Feel bad for you if you are averaging 1m a day doing Slayer.

Also not sure if it mentions it in the wiki, but do the hard rumble mode. The wiki mentions block lists, gear and inv set ups though.
---
Ikr im kinda shocked its nice to know there are so many new players
---
It's true even the fastest slayer tasks are about on par with runecrafting, but at least you're also getting as much in combat skills. How much magic xp/hour does casting magic imbue once every lava run give?
---
Log into rs3. All old accounts went to runescape3. Osrs released 2013 and no stats or items transferred.
---
Well to be fair jagex could provide us with this info in game... it would be helpful
---
Was the gf.
---
It's how I lived my gay fantasy.
---
Maybe go look at what actual people who actually play the game (unlike you apparently) are doing then chofl. See how many you can find playing minigames for no reward.

Just stop

Can you make it possible to trade or sell members items in free to play? i have items on a account that i want to transfer without buying membership on that account.

Same. I hear everyone always talking about how much more educt they are at this game than when they were kids, how much more than 'get it'. But I'm probably less efficient then when I was a kid lol. I'm just try to have fun.

Agi was my first 99 and now on my way to 99 mining for second. After that RC. Am I playing the game wrong?
---
He named his staff butt?
---
Looks fucking smooth dude
---
RC robes are unnecessary, especially considering how slow it is compared to other skills, it'd need to take like 15+ hrs to get the robes for them to be balanced.
---
Theres a few different ways to get XP in the skill, ZMI and Arceuus library are open from level 1, at 77 you unlock Blood RC which is the most popular way to train the skill.
---
for irons maybe

dungeon doors and mahogany tables  you don’t even have to move your mouse

It's impressive what they can do with a browser-based java game

Yes! Wednesday tomorrow!

You're commenting that each time this topic is mentioned, get downvoted and presented with counterarguments. I'm yet to hear why it would be "dead content".
---
* Low level PK scene is a thing. Nobody is saying mains and high level accounts will suddenly use steel-rune warhammers, and this is not the point of this suggestion. If you care only about high level accounts, all of low- and mid-tier gear is "dead content".
---
* Rune warhammer would become best-in-slot KO weapon for Strength pures in F2P and until 60 Strength in P2P, giving it a niche that he warhammers currently lack. Up to roughly 50 combined Attack/Strength levels, strength-based account would have a stronger, although less accurate KO attack than standard pures in the same combat level bracket. 
---
Maybe our definitions are different, but I'd say that "dead content" items have absolutely no use or there is no reason to use them at all due to existence of better alternatives. Warhammers are currently the definition of "dead content": more expensive and weaker than longswords, which have a better strength bonus **and** the attack speed. And of course, there are scimitars, which have much higher DPS, and battle axes, which are decent 1-handed KO weapons with a strength bonus comparable to 2hs. Other than fashionscape, there is no reason to use bronze-rune warhammers at all.
---
Now, I guess you could make warhammers faster, although maces seem like a better candidate for that, or make them stronger - but then again, they would just become battleaxes v2.0. Instead, I'm proposing giving them a niche use for low level and untypical accounts. Sure, they will be just as useless for most players, but at least they would have **a** use, as opposed to having none.

The Trident is a little more convenient because it works on any spell book.

Enormous impact, the dream mentor main boss gives over 100k points iirc.

I see what you're saying - it may just come down to the fact that they don't want to buff easily fully-botted skills

Chaotic rapier - 60 attack to wear, untradable, obtained from Dungeoneering, had limited amount of charges before having to be recharged there.

Ghrazi Rapier - Tradable, 75 attack to wear, Mega rare drop from ToB, 180m, cost about 700gp per charge

Chaotic Maul - Everything same as Rapier

Elder Maul - 75 Attack and Strength req, drop from CoX, 14m, non degradable.

I don’t not see the comparison whatsoever.

You can make money with herbs, but you'll spend money planting trees (fast XP).

Haha thanks for the suggestion but I got quest cape and almost all hard diaries now. Im except for RC (bad) at base 70s and the levels really start to slow down. Elite diaries are all so far away

I’ve gotten tons of sharks and lobsters on my HC account.

Slayer sucks and is boring change my mind
---
People with Aspergers don't think the same way we do, my dude. If this is what helps him, then who are we to say no?
---
At the cost of the accuracy, yes. That's the idea. You could definitely say that it would affect the low level PvP, but what I mostly meant by "no changes to F2P meta" is that no new items stronger than the current best-in-slot gear would be introduced. People seem to be afraid of giving F2P new items that would increase the DPS or max hit of any of the combat styles - and warhammers simply will not do that.
---
Fruit trees and hardwoods are the most cost effective.
---
Palm trees are dirt cheap gp/XP celasrus, mahogany, redwood, hepsori for cheap XP too
---
Jealous that you can stack caskets. I'm wayyy to impatient

I'm for this as long as they add in a nice bulge

*insert cringy 73 meme*

Last week I started getting random 3-5 second freezes as well. Never had any problems before and I have the best internet offered in my area so I’m assuming it’s something server side. I’ve noticed it gets better/worse depending on the word I’m using.
---
its so boring.  plus i can only play a couple hours a day so it's not really worth it to pay for a rumble if I cant afk for 6 hours at a time. not that its expensive it just feels like a waste of time when i could be doing slayer or grinding vork.

Literally everything on your list is a bunch of assumptions... It took me fucking forever to get rogue's outfit way back when you could get duplicate pieces. I'm *very* glad they changed that.

Yes, you can still be extremely unlucky. It's all a number's game, I'm not saying we should change that, just tweak the numbers a bit.

---
Diversity within a skill is good but replacing training a skill with something else isn't ideal. We should aim to have more variety with Construction by adding new Construction methods; not letting a gathering minigame effectively give Construction exp.
---
As for alternate rewards, I always thought it would be neat to offer special skilling tools that don't degrade. It could be simple stuff like a wieldable hammer or more unique stuff like an Axe that cuts Magic Trees faster than other axes, but it is only as good as a Rune Axe on non-Magic Trees. That would make it more akin to minigames like PC and BA where you unlock a few useful rewards, usually just the once. There could be some other use for the points, like buying exp in Gathering skills even since that is what the minigame is about, gathering, but I don't think the primarily benefits need to be degrading items like bonus exp.
---
D spear is dropped by practically everything

No it isn't. The vast, vast majority of support cases go through the system and work as intended. The vast, vast majority of reddit posts simply get replies that the system worked as intended. Support works fine as is.

I would still have 2fa on your email. In theory itd be unnecessary if nobody could ever find out what the email is, yeah

Recharging is also easier as I just buy a new one and sell the empty one. Also, what Special\_Feeling said. But its a matter of opinion.
---
Must've taken a long time! Too bad you didn't use that time to multi-task and learn how to take a screenshot.

I don't base my morals around what you should/shouldn't do in a video game when it comes to buying cheaper gold from a gold seller than spending a bunch on bonds.  I'm definitely not reporting him either.  I'm not here to have you impose any "morals" on me either over a video game.  Judge me all you want. I don't care about your opinion of me.
---
...Yeah, that would also fall under thinking differently.

Pking yourself is the safest method, but you can drop your gear anywhere. I’ve dropped items to my main 10 squares from the GE before.

Chaotic has an 80 attack requirement.

Hmm interesting concept, dmm being a minigame within 07. It has always felt like a big rift for me; I either play dmm or 07, but never both at the same time. I'll play DMM for months, switch to 07 to play with some friends, get tired of the grind and go back to DMM. Not sure how they would do it though. I was trying to provide a more simple solution that wouldn't take tons of dev time and testing.
---
The pain can be in the cost
---
Since cases do get overturned after enough evidence is submitted through twitter/reddit it apparently is not working as intended.
---
That's good I'm sure you'll find her at least one good friend!
---
I never said you did. I termed it bonus exp several times. But whether it is direct or bonus doesn't change too much. If you earn 125K Con exp in an hour of SC, you get that exp in 0 time by training the skill normally for like 15 mins. It does still require you to train the skill normally, but I never said the contrary. And you pretty much ignored all my points to complain about something that wasn't there.
---
Yes dream mentor boss gives you 75k pts ish

Wild turkey American honey is amazing

I know this doesn't really answer your question, but if you are planning on training cooking seriously, it is VERY worth getting cooking gauntlets if you don't have a restriction stopping you from doing the quest. You should be cooking in the Hosidius kitchen with the gauntlets, it'll save you SO much money over the trip to 99 with how much you won't burn.
---
You stop burning sharks at 99 with no boosts. You can start at 80 in the Rogue's Den but you'll be burning about 11-12% of your sharks which is not really worth it. Just get your gauntlets and the Hosidius favor.
---
I just use quick teles on my home teelports and an ecto for canifis
---
Don’t know the answer, tbh. I think having more gp on drop tables makes more sense. Remove magic logs from vorkath’s table and add the equivalent in gold coins. Or, honestly, just increase the amount of hide/bones. Makes way more sense.
---
That's true, but if you run from Port Tyras it's not too difficult to recharge Ibans.

There's no actual grave but your stuff stays on the ground for an hour if you die to pvm/pve. In PvP your stuff shows up for you and your opponent and then after a minute it shows up to everyone and stays there for an hour
---
&gt;You’re telling me a minigame that could give 30-50k exp an hour in, let’s say fletching,
---
So far, dead content 
---
&gt;could make you 50-500k GP an hour depending on certain levels,
---
Ok so this is just a moneymaker, then. Not a minigame. A moneymaker. For some accounts it would be their best moneymaker and they would do it- for any account which this is not their best moneymaker, dead content ofc. 
---
&gt;and have the reward of getting, let’s say making fletching logs 50% faster which makes an already minimal method actually viable.
---
Nope still dead lol, nobody would do it for this. Darts are 750k+ exp/hour 
---
&gt; If you are part of the cancer that truly believe BiS is the only thing that will make good content, go back to RS3.
---
Lmfao do not try and place the blame on me here bud. I wish it wasn't this way. I don't *believe* minigames need bis rewards to keep people. I can *clearly observe it*. It is happening now. This isn't a theory. There is demonstrable evidence. Minigames which do not have bis rewards are dead. This is not a theory, this is an observable fact.

Yeah no you need to be physically healthy no matter how you think.

bp, addy darts, salve ei, void (i use blessed dhide and karils cause its got better def, i don't have elite, and the dps spreadsheet says its actually marginally better). bgs/dwh spec at the beginning although your range is high enough/you have rigour it might not be necessary. still you'll get more kills if you lower its defense.

You can also pay them to remove your trees quickly too, instead of chopping it down to the stump and then removing. 200 gp.

Yes. Just incase you get assigned that tree on the next contract.

One is usually more than enough, as I commonly find another seed in a seed pack or birds nest before I get assigned it again.
---
Don't worry about it, in the time Ive played I've only known one or two people get it in under 2 attempts (most take even more). 
---
Rendi has done dozens if not hundreds of capes at this point.
---
I agree. What I’m saying is make the minigame worthwhile by making the points go towards items that are readable or untradable, allow decent exp within the game. This makes players not feel like they are playing a pointless mini game with the only reward being what you can buy with the points. 
---
Castle Wars is utterly dead because the rewards are just cosmetic/BiS for pure (who boost anyway) and the exp is actual shit.
---
I give a shit, imagine being such a cunt you hate when people get happy over their achievements that they should be posting because this is a community. You don’t give a shit but many people do.

just completed dwarf cannon quest and can finally afford it.  the issue now is cannonballs.  is it worth it to mine coal and iron and make them from scratch, or should i just bite the bullet and buy em premade?  i have time to spare but that time could also be used killing things with the cannon.  or maybe not making them from scratch but buying steel bars?  any insight?

What you are saying doesn't even make sense, if I boost right before it is going to tick down then I will only have the boost for 1 tick. From what I can tell 1 tick is not 80 ticks? 
---
It would be obvious if boosting reset the timer back to 80 ticks+ and it would be severely abused by making expensive pots like a super combat last longer by boosting some cheap stat.

Buy them pre-made, or make an alt to smith the cannonballs for you (from steel bars) to save some gold (since making cannonballs is extremely AFK, it's easy to make cannonballs on an alt while doing whatever on your main).
---
Making cannonballs is pretty bad in terms of gp/h. From steel bars, you're looking at like 100k-200k an hour. There are plenty of things you can do at any level range that makes significantly more than that. If you were to mine iron + coal, smith into steel, and make cannonballs it'd take even more time and be significantly less gp/h.
---
I bring this up because you're a main account. You can use the GE. So use it. If you make your money in a more efficient manner, you'll be able to afford more cannonballs than if you would have made them from scratch yourself in the same amount of time, if that makes sense.

Totally fair.  Questing makes the most sense then.  I wasn't sure if it could be worth leveling construction to make the rest of the game a little more convenient.  I don't play that much, so if it removes some of the grind of just running from place to place it could be worth it for me.

Hopefully not, it's really only useful for people doing insane challenges like these just because of how long it takes to get. From my understanding you'd have to do 30 hard gnome deliveries to be able to get 10 pieces of random gnome food from it, and if you use it I think you'd have to do another 30? I wasn't 100% sure on that, that's my best interpretation of the wiki and I couldn't find much info on people actually using that item for anything at all in the game lol.
---
You're basically getting 2 brews for 1 inventory slot in terms of how much you can heal if you're not a low level account doing a special challenge, like how a fally shield 4 gives 2 restores for 1 inventory slot, but you have to spend a ton of time getting the item back each time.

I dont get lucky drops. I've had 2 whip drops total, and 1 kraken tentacle at 900 or so kc. Done about 60 raids with not a single drop and usually have a good amount of points. 200 or so on God bosses with nothing and roughly 100 or so med and hard clues and the most I've ever got from a clue is 800k roughly.

I dont put in much work but I'm sitting at about 2k hours and I try to do a little bit of everything.

The OSRS community is small enough as is. Dividing the reddit community even further is just a good way to make people feel even more alone while playing this game. They can't even share an achievement while getting shit on by the very same community that they can only share the content with. I've been in a lot of gaming subs and OSRS stands out so much as one that loves to shit on people's 99's among other things. I mean other subs do it also but man does it happen frequently in this sub and the people who do it are so much more vile about it.
---
I started playing OSRS for the very first time about 3+ months ago. I'm personally so happy to hit 90+ in attack and strength and also breaking a 100 mill bank. I would have loved to share just any achievement with this community. Even getting firecape I was so happy and just wanted to share my excitement with the community. But I browsed this sub often enough in those 3 months that a majority of posts celebrating personal achievements are highly looked down on.

So there is  [https://twitter.com/jagexsupport](https://twitter.com/jagexsupport). I don't know how great they are about this account but try it. If it doesn't work we can try something else. But if you actually deserved the ban, don't waste anyone's time. Its selfish and not chill. The reason they make it so the ban can't be appealed is cause people appeal even when they obviously did it.

It just sucks cuz no matter what restrictions they put on it, people can just program bots to finish the requirements. I'm sure the whole time they are emblem farming, they have 50 more accounts getting lvl 20. So even if they add a time gate to doing BH on the account, or some quest requirement, they will always be able to keep up. It is just so perplexing that there isn't some solution out there we just havent seen yet.

It may be pointless for you, and that's the beauty of the game. I actually ENJOY tick manipulation hunter and 1.5t teaks. I want to blow my brains out if I was to just hunt chins regularly though. I also quite like 3t fishing and mining, though I still do a lot of afk fishing, depending on how much focus I want to give. It scratches some weird autistic itch in my brain that likes the repetitiveness. I find it relaxing. 
---
Besides, I have three monitors. It's not like I'm staring at fullscreen RS doing 3t methods...might as well get fast xp rates especially for something like hunter thats not afk anyway.

I mean ideally the way it would work is that there'd be a 10s countdown to hop in any wilderness area. So no, you wouldn't be able to freely hop out at the sign of danger. But you also wouldn't get jumped from a person appearing out of nowhere.

I just started construction and was running more planks to rimmington from fally, was wondering wtf the nearby players were running to the general store for.

That's true. The numbers can be tweaked. Maybe it doesn't work for Piety/Rigour/Augury and only on the single-stat boosting prayers. Maybe Range could only get a portion of the benefit (1.5% and 3% respectively). There's ways to balance this to make it work.
---
I don't think that's ideal at all. I think it's ideal as is. The system has been this way for decades and I think it's a good system. I guess the answer is no, this hasn't been brought up. Much like adding ak47's hasn't been brought up....cuz it just doesn't make sense

I'd say that's unlikely, his alt he used for a while was 'SkillersL' with 110m rc from double natures, 170m cook,among a few other 99s. He hasn't touched that account in over a year. Can't see him playing another account if he was going for XP considering the progress on that one. I have no clue what he's up to, but I personally think he's  just playing another game these days.

Potupson or evscapes guides are fine. Basically just learn to trap the melee ones etc and jad spawns where the orange mager spawns. They explain it but honestly if you watch them guides then watch someone do a run youll do it easily.
---
Didn't ask

I like agility....

3t hunter is probably the easiest skill to 3t but I guess that’s subjective. I find it nearly relaxing, and I would never touch 1.5 teaks or whatever tick mining is nowadays
---
EHP/hr is what youre thinking of. EHP is just another unit of xp.
---
will do Mr. Imp
---
Even at 1 def with some pure gear, rune warhammer accuracy would be roughly 50% at 1 Attack. Against a 10 Defence pure with full black, the accuracy would fall below 20%. For comparison, accuracy of a rune 2h with 40 Attack is over 90% vs 1 Defence and almost 80% vs 10 Defence in black armor. And don't forget that the main DPS weapon of Strength pures - event rpg - would be even less accurate. Relying on Ranged for DPS would quickly change their combat level to Ranged-based.
---
Not saying that F2P low Attack pures would be useless, but I'd say that accuracy can be pretty helpful as well, even in pure fights.

Konar keys are meh. 100k/key at the average key drop rate isn't great compared to most good moneymakers. And a lot of Konar tasks (locations) are so poor that it takes away from efficiency and afkability. 
---
Do Nieve/Steve till 95, and work in bosses wherever you can or whenever you feel like it. 
---
Black Demons task? Do Demonic Gorillas (need to finish MM2). Great money, great xp. This option isn't available if doing Konar, so it's a dealbreaker for me pre-95. 
---
After 95, the Hydra task (always do Alchemical Hydra when on hydra task) becomes such a good moneymaker that Konar becomes worth it. Plus by this point you'll have a lot of good options that will make your point balance more or less even.
---
my bad thanks for the correction

So no, I really don't know how bad the bot problem is in f2p cause I'd never touch f2p.
---
I had 98 farming before i realised that white lily make sure allotment do not disease. :)))
---
I don't think prayer prayer should be E tier. You're saying mining is more useful/easier
---
What's the point of that sub?
---
IIRC there was a iron that had 4 3rd age pieces just about a year after the mode released, he would follow streamers with it to show off. Ppll get mad lucky sometimes.
---
Ah in f2p it makes sense. But honestly, why even play f2p lol
---
Could the amount of untrimmed and trimmed skillcapes in game be updated? The last one was over 2 years ago, I believe.
---
Pretty much same for me. I will occasionally skill up attack/strength with hill giants near the GE, and use the oboe keys, but aside from that mining has made me most of my money.
---
And ur poor haha just guessing by how you spend ur free rs time having “fun”
---
You shouldn't need more ranged levels. Are you using ruby (e) and diamond (e) bolts?
---
But other people do care? Its nice to share in achievements of others and congratulate them

Trade you for the bird lol
---
its a house
---
OOF
---
It feels like it ruins the joke when it's explained.
---
Jagex is powerless agint rapidly changing mob mentality.
---
Get membership
---
Same
---
I died 6 times and got it on my 7th so never feel bad just keep trying really you’ll get it though tons of us already have it and are waiting for you to join the brotherhood.
---
Don't forget to donate to my patreon!
---
So if I go with Nieve/Steve should I get MM2 done asap? Haven't done it yet
---
Edit: realized I have to do MM2 anyways for barrows gloves so yeah
---
I was just asking if he referred bug as 3t. Because like you said, 3t is not a bug.
---
Ah yes, they also mentioned a Meiyerditch/Castle Drakan course though.
---
I tried f2p Skilling and wanted to kill myself. I'd rather runecraft in full obsidian without stamina potions
---
So instead of the same shitty and stale memes we get the same shitty and stale "after 4 years of playing" posts. Fantastic.
---
Gif source? Or is this OC?
---
My face when
---
It’s part of Pirate Pete’s subquest in RfD.
---
Let's say for Hellhounds or Black Demons
---
mountain time (right now its 5:10)
---
I mean, the equivalency is in the knowledge of the possible/likely consequences for his chosen actions, even when alternatives exist. there are a million ways to play the game, he's chosen to play a piece of content in the wilderness, he knows whats up, it's on the signs when you walk north!
---
Honestly, I'd rather see "I just hit 99" posts than memes.
---
Only if you want 20% more exp, not even that, stop spewing shit without knowing. You can get 2gp/xp with 150k/xp, there is many ways to train it.
---
Top comment btw
---
Does justiciar have any uses other than the inferno and rune dragons?
---
And pet drops
---
Yay!
---
I've gotten 500 nats from doing this. Lol
---
Nice at least you know you’ve done it. Life long failure here
---
Adding this here; Slepe is lacking in content and a rooftop course here could be a great place for Black Graceful to come from. Make it an alternative to Seers-tele for 80-90 agility. The NPC that sells you the black graceful set can be an arch-enemy of Grace's (hell yeah, lore baby).
---
I mean unless you've got a raking fetish and disable it
---
At the very least you can get consistent 4kc trips. I know, I've been there and done it without rigour.
---
Lmao, how do you guys come up with things like this??
---
OH SHIT BROTHER YOU BETTER CRANK THAT HOG WHILE YOU CAN ARRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOO
---
this isn't a random event though
---
i really think an ironman would solve a lot of your gripes with the game
---
While normally I'd agree with this sentiment adding an otherwise unobtainable(for no reason) item to a shop stock takes 0 developer time.
---
Oh that's fair, I was fuckin ready if there was a way to get herblore to 99 in 3 hours lol
---
Lol? Can get 750 slay PTS in a day, gl doing 100 farm contracts in that time.
---
TIL filling my enventory with platebodys doesn't max my defense level
---
I love that is never the punchline, he always just kinda casually says it. You can't just look to the end of the comment to see the " in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."
---
Sheet. Maybe on weekends. It's midnight in uk
---
Credit card fraud.
---
Many stolen credit cards was spent on runescape, the credit card companies got sick of all the refund and tasked jagex to deal with it.
---
As a result we got trade restriction.
---
That's like saying seconds exist to make life as devoid as fun as possible? EHP is a unit of measurement used to measure the minimal amount of hours required to level up an account to it's current stats. 
---
That's it.
---
This sub has a blind hatred for ehp without understanding it.
---
Wait till you hear about my dad
---
damn rip btw add me on osrs ZayOsrs
---
Roll tide!
---
In all seriousness, when my friend first told me about the game in 2006, I went home after school and got on my dad’s computer to play what I thought was called roomscape, but when I typed it into the browser it just took me to a interior design website. I was sad and I had to wait a whole other day before excited young me could try out a cool new game
---
I bought a Brine Saber for Rock Slugs.
---
A guy got it qith 18 cb.. Lol
---
That 18 combat fire cape was crazy to watch
---
That's late game, early game is shit. Like think back to 1 or 2 traps
---
You're an honorable man.
---
I'd say having a job and being able to support yourself is much more fulfilling than spending an average of 14 hours a day for 6 years clicking on pixels.
---
I can't have twitch finger control forever ready to log out at a moment's notice. I'd like to be able to access inventory and prayer sometimes
---
Disgusting "smooth" animations 😷
---
I don't think it's worth anybodies time to try and convince you otherwise. You've made it pretty clear you would never understand a pet rat.
---
You sound like a problem solver
---
Lol I think your exaggerating that a bit...
---
I'll put it in my notes I'm not at home rn
---
I call Minecraft Mineman because of what a friend's mom called it in the background of a discord call
---
I just had an orjazzm
---
Ur hot
---
Anyone asking that is braindead enough to forget they destroyed one version of the game by doing that
---
You can spam click some herbs and allotments to harvest them faster!
---
Yes; they were nerfed as the prices of brews were affected by it.
---
I miss this a lot from RS2.
---
Yup, that was the point of my comment, wintertodt is fun and fast xp so it doesn't deserve the "z tier."
---
No it is not safe, it downloads compiled java code from the owners server every time you run it and executes it. I doubt anyone is going to read java byte code, and I very much doubt anyone would notice if he added something malicious. 
---
Is it trust worthy? Probably. Guy seems chill enough. Do you trust him? Then you're good to go. Do you trust him to keep his Web server secure? I personally don't, so I will not be using his client. You should learn to compile your own runelite and add the plugins you want if you care about account security.
---
I just hit 60 atk and def and don't really know where to go armor or weapon wise after this. I'm super poor with 150K to my name alongside my rune set. What should I aim for now?
---
Been playing osrs for 3 years and never knew this existed lol. I thought it was a Jmod trolling him at first 😂
---
Could you point me in a direction where I can learn to do so! That sounds awesome
---
Practice on the jad simulator.  I did jad first try, and 3rd try in general (died trying to pray flick the mages) with 60 def, 60 pray, and 87 range or something.  
---
Jad is honestly easy I feel like most people fail because they get nervous and can't keep their heart rate down and focus.  Logout before jad and take some deep breaths before you start
---
1/10th chance of herb dying with ultra in 1 event. Therefore you exponentiate that percentage with the number of events. (1/10)^3 = 1/1000 which is fairly unlucky
---
😢😢 guess I'm just in it for that sweet sweet Hunter exp then. Was hoping to sustain a bond tho
---
I'm almost positive older people like to do this just to fuck with their kids, then when their kids get older they do the same. As is tradition.
---
Has this always been the dialog? I’ve been a space bar warrior for every quest, I never would’ve noticed
---
They patch stuff it’s not intended to be there, and for my experience in game, zuk is slightly easier than triple jads.
---
So if you meant getting every wave harder than the wave before, yeah. 
---
Idk man, Jagex don’t test many stuff
---
when you are walking to lavas why would you need to do those things?
---
his username?
---
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ANYTHING
---
&lt;3
---
Don’t complain then.
---
Would love to have an explanation on how you get around the magic blast hitting you while praying ranged.. It chews me up.. I get 2 sometimes 3 kills per trip ( tho just started it) 
---
Void - regular working on Elite 
---
92 ranged 
---
Dhcb 
---
Ward
---
Pegs
---
Salve ei 
---
Archers I
---
Rigour 
---
The magic just hits 15-20s so consistently I have to eat.
---
Would love some input does elite void have more magic def?
---
Perfection.
---
Yeah why the obby cape?
---
The point is not the correct calculation but the tiny chance of this occurring, if what you say is true then it only proves it is only more rare.
---
Mobile
---
I don't know yeah it seems like they're still probably broken. The wiki suggests an average of 8 nests a run but I'm getting more like 4 at best.
---
On the flipside my parents thought their credit cards would be hacked and refused on that reason alone
---
so am i wrong there? would that allow him to get into your email thru 2fa?
---
ook
---
Motherlode mine
---
Boys or men? Da fuck
---
$30 for 2 months. That was the physical cards.
---
Lol almost like everyone still played and coulda been bros but were too scared of public ridicule when there wouldn't have been any. Kids are strange indeed.
---
It's like game, game knows game. You gotta be drongo to know drongo
---
Hcuim?
---
You need 60% favour and min 45 farming to enter the guild 
---
There was an update very recently so that you no longer lose favour in other houses. To gain favour you usually just do a couple of monotonous tasks, and you'll gain favour for each action or whenever you hand some items in to an NPC. For Hosidius I think you need to start out just pushing a trough back and forth (simply left clicking to move it, nothing tricky)  
---
You can also make fertiliser, check the wiki on how to do it. It's really cheap to buy the supplies, and really fast favour too. But can be quite click intensive. I personally did this method to 100%. 
---
You should complete the depths of despair quest at 20% favour because it gives 10% as a reward. And you can also start Hosidius Kitchen to gain some decent cooking xp as well as gain favour. The wiki will explain how to do that better than I can tbh
