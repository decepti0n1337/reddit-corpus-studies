Worth noting that 100 million trees is like, a days worth of trees for people to cut down. Its a nice effort but probably wont have impact.

This was in their first post about 3rd party clients under prohibited section. I think it's  it okay to use

---
"Features which allow you to interact with altars with fewer clicks than our client would allow."
---
Jagex cracked down on Zulrah bots as of late. I've seen hardly any obvious bots in my 500ish kc since scale/unique prices went up. Only seen 1 gibberish username, whereas before I'd see several gibberish usernames in a couple hours of Zulrah.
---
EoC literally halved the playerbase within a week of its release. What are you on about?
---
Then I shouldn't tell you I have the smoke devil pet which I also got at 20kc?
---
It failed to get 75% support three times and only passed once when bundled with another question. And player choice and will of the player base are not the same things; a specific player can choose to do anything they want, but it doesn't mean the player base will agree that thing should be possible. But if they are the same thing, then you said it should be the player's choice and those features failed their polls, so you agreed they shouldn't be possible since the players choose not to have them.
---
Sir I've seen so many people go dry on different things on this game, some ppl have more than 10k kill count with a single unique item at a boss, some people have 50m+ exp on a skill without getting a pet, me myself I have almost 32,700.000 exp on thieving without getting Rocky, I've tried almost every available method on the game just to get that chance to get the pet. But I think I'm not lucky enough or something. Most of the time I see people with 40- thieving have that pet that I was hunting for months and most of them are iron mens, I don't know what's wrong but I'm sure that there is something wrong.
---
I know this might sound as silly evidence but I cant trust osrs wiki any more with everything.
---
There‚Äôs zero good item sinks and every one that comes in never leaves because of the non existent death mechanics
---
Sniper take the shot.
---
EoC halved the playerbase within a week of its release, and the vote for opening up "oldschool" servers were opened up within the year. I do not think that is a coincidence.
---
Lance is far better than DHCB in CoX. If you plan on doing a lot of raids, you should sell the DHCB. Assuming you were doing vorkath with the crossbow, you can also melee vorkath for similar kills/hr and gp/hr. Personally, I preferred doing melee vorkath over the DHCB method.

He's in Maize clan chat! Good guy, totally not a bot. Insane skillet account, like holy shit.
---
No never, FOR GUTHIX!
---
so whats the joke i missed?
---
Except I could be playing like 5 other games instead lol
---
No problem. He's max combat, I'm max melees with 91 range and 90 mage. I'm also 70 prayer. He's got tbow and max gear, I'm I'm void lol.
---
2258kc 1 ring
---
I know this is a joke. But in case someone was actually wondering this wouldn‚Äôt really work because modern browsers (Chrome) are ditching Java support.
---
I have not, I did 30,000 pre-collection log, I may have gotten around 20 or so. I've gotten 6 in the 6,000 after the log released.
---
One of the reasons they made inferno was because firecape is pretty much a joke to get now, they wanted to create something that would be an accomplishment for people that beat it, obviously the want to protect the integrity of that. If you go back and read the dev/release blogs they pretty much state this
---
A lot of the mobile players that came in a year ago are on bossing now. Theres probably a huge amount of those items coming into the game, much faster than they are leaving. Supply and demand can be a bitch.
---
While money makers like you mentioned are pulling in less money, everything is also costing less for the most part so thats nice. Even COX items are crashing hard, like the DHCB and stuff. Not sure about tbow
---
Yup and everyone on reddit bitches about having gold sinks, they are too dumb to realize item sinks is what we really need.
---
I have only killed 6,000 since the collection log released, I've gotten 6 from these 6,000, possibly around 20 from the previous 30,000. No daggers yet, kinda surprised, figured Jagex would give me that big finger, tbh. I have gotten about 5 or 6 Dragonstones WITHOUT the RoW, so there's that... xD

Lol it‚Äôs not against the rules though, they didn‚Äôt say anything about hiding options, just moving or resizing. 
---
RIP you dude F lmao
---
I really liked his desert only ironman series.
---
Yes. But the runelite devs have been in constant contact with jagex. If it‚Äôs still there it‚Äôs fine
---
Can‚Äôt you alch them ?
---
Same. Well, I did try OSB once back in the day and I've logged on mobile a few things, but I have no issues with the vanilla client. That said, the desktop game really needs to port some of those mobile features like GPU and address some of the other accessibility and performance issues that Third-Party Clients offer.
---
Can I have a kiss

Ultimateiron

Agreed man. But understand, that most people play this game 16+ hours a day and have no life, so they can get mills in a day. Be glad you arent one of them
---
Nmz normal custom rumble turn off a few bosses use super combats and dharoks. Use absorbs and stay in the middle so never out of cmb. Repot every 19 mins and lower hp back to 1.  
---
  
---
Bandits if you go over 20 mins you stop auto retaliating, die, and get logged, possibly losing some stuff an hour later. Nmz you just lose the 26k you put in the coffer, which you make back and more from herb boxes anyway.

Damn that just made me so sad

Ok.

There's nothing "OP" or "bullshitty" about RL (at least those plugins you can actually detect and ban). Menu ordering is basic QoL that should be in the base game.

Sorting by new on all is my favorite social experiment.

Wtf, it just keeps going and going. How the fuck does he land so many stunts in a row?

Meet Shadowletics, my Shadowland locked ultimate ironman. After recently running out of ideas I decided to up the ante, to forge my own jounrey from scratch. No ideas. No problem. But this time I can't leave Shadowland, all leading up to eventually taking on one of WoW's biggest challenges... Original Content.  
---
(In all seriousness I'm sure WoW is a perfectly fun and original game.)
---
Why be so concerned with plugins that teach players mechanics and make certain parts of the game much more tolerable.
---
 when compared to zulrah and other money making farms that create huge economic gaps in the economy by devalueing mid level content and making the step to end game raids and content so much more unattainable.
---
All of the bot busting focus should be on the zulrah , impling and bounty bots.
---
If need be make zulrah tied to sote.

The ones where he broke the bots on pvp worlds / in the wilderness for bank were interesting. Most of his interviewing bot makers from discord are pretty boring IMO.

"strategically placed" doesn't matter. 100 million trees are still cut down a day, this won't have any impact.

Dh isn‚Äôt really effective until you‚Äôre 90+ hp since the set effect is based on your hp level. Use full obsidian with an obsidian sword.

Of the ones you listed, I believe that the only bannable one as of right now is prayer warnings
---
If you get a boss task you get to pick how many, so if you get a wildy boss task you can pick only 3 (the minimum) or if you get one you like you can pick 35
---
Remember that some of those are false and you brush them off because jagex promised you they're super accurate.
---
We need more videos of people Dragon dagger specing things irl

Yeah get out, oh wait why did our player base tank 70%... It's for the good of the game though. at least I can play with the boys though.

Probably both guys

I pickpocketed H.A.M. Members for about 300-400 of the clues if I'm guessing. I bought 27m worth of Gourmet Implings (money from Smithing grind) to speed the grind up a lot. (bought imps, sold jars, bought more imps, sold jars, etc until broke)

True. I bought Gourmet Implings for a part of the grind :)

Oh does the hive hate puggers now

I thought that green thing 10 secs in was a lighter and the camera was just rly close to it lmfao.

Duh. Learn the default layout like everyone else though.

Thanks! No spoilers yet, but I got reasonably lucky on some areas. a big part of my collection log has been filled :D. Planning to also post an overview of what I got and if I got lucky on items X and Y or not.
---
Just longpress on the globe icon.
---
So is swapping bury to use on bones okay for using the altar?
---
I Just read a guide that says to use this bosses:Count Draynor , King roald, Moss giant, Ice Troll King, Khazard warlord. That works if i use full obsidian with obby sword aswell.?
---
But, I'm a 0 kc on any boss or raid don't even have fire cape, am I a champion too?
---
Your arrows?
---
damn i thought this sub was done posting these lame ass leaking memes
---
Jagex can't tell the difference either way so it's basically them saying 'please don't do it.'
---
Yessir
---
Hacked
---
Thanks fam
---
people defending pugger need to realize that his videos are fake if you are making 200 grand a year from a cheating method on osrs are you going to tell anyone about it let alone a youtuber?
---
2 questions
---
1 - is there a website I can go to that shows items in Runescape in the order they were introduced to the game? I haven't been that active other than playing RS to Runecraft and I feel like I've missed out on the last 3 months of things added in game, and would like to catch myself up.
---
2 - With the big cake in Varrock yesterday, did you just take a slice from it to eat? I forgot to go there to check it out.
---
But I feel like that plugin is even less invasive than the others, as it‚Äôs just an overlay plugin that draws a square in your prayer tab around the correct prayer to use. Do you know of any specific instances of anyone getting banned for this by chance?
---
You‚Äôre more than welcome to add me :) I‚Äôm very friendly and enjoy helping others when I can. 
---
IGN: Gay Papa
---
Stay positive bud and grind on. :)
---
The real reason why people choose to be ironmen.
---
It doesn't really impact anyone other than streamers. Until they can detect it, go ham with it. 
---
Imagine putting this much effort into such a useless thing, when they could be putting all this effort into their own client, gpu rendering, adding better particle engine and much more. Literally **anything** is better than wasting time on this. Because as I said before, it only opens a paywall for **paid** clients. 
---
This only benefits clans and other abusers, the public will be affected.
---
thank you so much :') trying to get back to grinding on this account haha
---
Not sure to be honest about using multiple numbers. Far as I‚Äôve seen each number gets 1 hour free WiFi per day . Could try new number after first hour is up I suppose. If not at least you got the one hour. And the t mobile thing is with ‚Äúgo go in flight‚Äù. That‚Äôs name of WiFi provider with a lot of large carriers. American uses that and I believe other carriers like DL or United as well.
---
It collects junk, so no
---
And yet you wrote this response. Thinking emoji
---
I like my name and respect your opinion.
---
To be honest I would definitely brag about taking in a six figure salary by creating bots. In that super obnoxious vague way "yeah I make over 100k a year but I can't tell you how. It's only for the inner circle.."
---
As for server upkeep I really doubt they spend much if they have physical servers they own. You can buy used servers dirt cheap that are more than powerful enough for osrs bots. I would hope they are using their own programs and not paying to be script kiddies at that level. Maybe paying for multiple internet lines to increase their bandwidth. This is all speculation of course so don't take it as fact
---
Well then it just seems they try to avoid engine work at all cost, which is kind of sad as it wouldn't limit them as much in th le future, but alright. Thanks for the information though, seems I was wrong then.
---
I just lost max cash stack twice on my ‚Äòmain‚Äô. I started an ironman account and grinding 99 Firemaking rn. I know most of the community is a troll but I like to try and stay positive and keep the community alive :)

(Name got banned 3 times already but I get it right back just because of trolls)
---
Sixthageking. I flip a lot, smoke a lot and am pretty chill. Add me :)
---
If there's enough idiotic people in this game to even warrant profitability on a paid client when free and open source ones are more than easily available to use then I have little hope for the collective IQ of the Runescape community.
---
I find it better to run north east corner and stand next to a pile of armor you only get hit from 2 sides so your absorption stays up more.

Who the fuck is sirpugger? And why we now need to defend against his acquisitions?

His content went from killing bots in the wildy and getting them to suicide to long ass boring interviews with suspected botters about what they make and how much bots that don't exist could make.
---
There was this game with a helicopter and a guy shooting these little yellow balls at the enemy and moving through the level, I can‚Äôt remember what is was called but was trying to tell my wife about it the other day, I played it a lot in middle school, Miniclip was the shit and was also my into to RS.

Ahh true I've been doin hard rumble on mobile makes sense.

On the 9th day, God fell, slain by Ash's hand?

There's also the issue of some users not speaking English.  It's totally possible!
---
If these people can barely afford food I don't think they are going to be able to afford to have a computer and an internet connection. They most likely work for some people that do have access to them. It would be stupid for them to RWT frequently considering the risk of both the farmer and the account taking the gold of being banned.

Are you saying this somehow happened to Jagex OSRS staff? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1_SUHtrQlE

You got downvoted, I upvoted you back to 1. 
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs true though. Discussion is dead here for the most part, because everything‚Äôs been discussed a billion times over. 
---
Any discussion ideas people can think of, I encourage you to use the search bar feature and see how over saturated this sub has been over the years with that discussion. 
---
Only top content makes it to the top on Reddit. The people using this sub are mostly hardened long term RS vets, so their upvotes dictate what is visible to us, including run down memes that get circle jerked around like crazy. 
---
The only place to really find tangible discussion is in a more live environment, such as clan chats or discords.

Small companies aren't an exception. While larger companies tend to pay more attention to profits, small companies can also do so.

I tried like three times last night stayed up until like 4am and went to bed defeated lol. I woke up like nah I'm getting it rn so I did. Morale of the story is dont give up
---
I'd say it was went from 96-99 with it in like a week and a half
---
And yes the healers get stressful
---
The grind is just too fucking long lol. Even the quickest 99s in the game take as long as multiple campaigns of other games. I had to quit after deciding maxing as an adult was a pipe dream if I wanted to do anything else

How was the connection anyway? Flying melb-&gt;lax early next year so might use it for some osrs if it's bearable

The total level requirement for f2p worlds is in f2p skills only. Leveling those wouldn't allow him to enter f2p 750 worlds.

The LMS and PVP worlds are in a rotation , it‚Äôll go back to the original worlds after ~2 weeks to allow people from all over to have better ping.
---
Cool In theory
---
In actuality, it just gives clans another mechanic to exploit/control the playerbase or high profile targets. 
---
Certain people would be perma-ragged. Raggers and crashers are a serious issue for streamers or players of interest.

We unfortunately have too toxic of a pk community to ever implement something like this into the game.

I think you're talking of shield of arrav

Sounds like you want to bot but not get banned
---
Yeah, I know. I just don‚Äôt understand how ‚Äúgo play the game you enjoy!‚Äù translates as an insult.
---
The collection log is definitely not useless for a lot of players. As a main I don't care about having a costume room filled to the brim with treasure trail items - I'd much rather have the log just show that I've gotten one of every medium clue unique. It's also very fun to compete against friends in it, and it brings you to content you'd never see otherwise. I'm currently 4k dry on a Shaman mask, and it's very entertaining knowing that my friends are grinding items like that too.
---
I don't trust anyone who skills post 200m.
---
Use bludgeon and bp switch instead of arclight dcb. Also use full body and legs switch instead. So bandos and god dhide. Should improve kills per trip for sure. I get around 40-50 kills per trip. Sgs for specs to heal up
---
I'm not sure how it works exactly but when buying over the phone for example sometimes all they need is the card number
---
Then don't use them and let everyone else play how they want to.

Why use ppots at barrows though? I have always had enough prayer, hitting dharok first, then ahrim, then karils, and the rest barley use 1 food unless i have really bad RNG with veracs. If dharok happens to be the tunnel brother then that is about the only time ill use a dose of ppot. Sometimes karils hits a lot as the tunnel brother but food is so cheap (5gp for cheesy buttery potato). I only have like 65 pray using ibans staff so i think lots of people could save a lot of money on supplies
---
Still bring both anguish and torture? I‚Äôd really like to limit my switches if possible. I‚Äôm a potato.
---
Def keep anguish and tort
---
I missed both of those things. Now I only miss one of them
---
No he doesn't. This dude just made up everything on the spot
---
The difference is jagex had a single backup from 2007 and a small handful of content that was almost ready to release (gwd etc)
---
Blizzard has backups of *everything* and most people agree the game didn't really start going downhill until the end of wrath/start of cata, so they've got like 3-5 years of content at least if they pace themselves
---
Boy wait till u see FOX news
---
Nope

A real g would fight to make a point and put their pride and dignity on the line after talking so much shit with nothing to back it up but all I hear are your excuses because you don‚Äôt really got it like that and you‚Äôre bitch made

Inspired by some other posters around here to just... do some creative writing about OSRS. I just started my first iron man which has really opened the game up to me again. I love this game and I think its at its best when it creates a little story. So i tried to tell "the story" of my ironman so far. I had fun writing it

I have actually managed to use home teleport when poisoned but you need to click it right when the poison splash shows up. I was about to die but somehow got to bank with 3 hp.

Looks like that couple J1mmy met at the hill giants got gud, props to them.

Yeah but even those newer pieces of content were *specifically* designed to have an *old school* feel so not to break the nostalgic experience lol. The game is designed around it whether you feel it personally or not lol.

He isnt asking for a bond hes asking if you can teach him safe spot so he can make money for his bond

Personally I think it‚Äôs fucking tragic that they‚Äôve taken over complete worlds. It makes it impossible for people to use them if they can‚Äôt afford to pay these rev ‚Äòprotectors‚Äô.

I like to think that's just the way he talks on a daily basis

There‚Äôs hundreds of worlds to kill revs on.

Hell, the amount of different systems for gearing is overwhelming even for an older player. Hopefully they finally realise that it's confusing as hell and fix it in Shadowlands.
---
Its like the equivalent of people who've never fired a firearm, trying to get A gun banned. You shouldn't be able to vote no if you have never participated in it, just because it says PVP in the title. They should add a limit of atleast 50+ kills for these type of polls imo.

Miscellania is so little profit these days it might only be worth it if your very low level

Yeah, it‚Äôs what ive been doing since it got removed. It‚Äôs not a great fix though since I have to do it every single time i open Runelite.
---
So does that mean you can't use RuneLite anymore?? ü§î
---
Everyone does quests. Also everyone does pvm. Not everyone pks though.
---
Sweet, I'll go farm kills with my alt then.
---
I unironically agree with you on the pvm part, but people who are able to do proposed quests should be able to vote on them.
---
Oh yeah, that‚Äôs where I started with RuneScape. Good memories
---
Yeah they might do some but they haven't completed everything, so they should be the only players to vote.

They are  non profit organization
---
Add a hotspot teleport or spell to bring us to the current active hot spots. It can be a reward from loot crates.
---
I'll agree to not vote on PVP if Jagex grants me immunity in the wildy. Until then, I'll vote on whatever the fuck I want. :)
---
Ha... I was going to say "at the risk of sounding condescending, the interaction boils down to...", but I took it out because it was presumptuous. 
---
Anyway, I wasn't trying to be condescending, I just figured it was the clearest way to communicate the message.
---
enjoy discussing things on this site when the downvote system incentivizes silencing people with opinions differing from the hivemind (i.e. the vanilla client isn't that bad)
---
Shameless cunts
---
I guess it's magic
---
A poloygon magician never reveals
---
It was good man, it cut in and out at times very briefly so I wasn‚Äôt willing to do slayer etc on the hardcore but was easily good enough to play consistently. Caught up on some new osrs YouTube content etc without having to buffer
---
I think someone will cheat and obtain items from GE and it's not the same achievement doing it on a normie than ironman. Group Ironman is coming soon.
---
would love to see more of your work :)
---
What job you have where you can play the game undetected? I wouldn't dare opening osrs at work
---
I legit got a Smouldering Stone from under 100 Hell hounds a couple days ago. So lucky.
---
We all know eachother IRL and trust eachother really well lol. The main thing that convinced us is we have 6 guys that all wanted to play together so this is the best way we can do it unfortunately!
---
Are you implying that firing a firearm gives you perfect knowledge of what's best for everyone?
---
I knew this day would happen
---
Its not so much about what the plugins doing. its more about you not having to think about what pray to use
---
Loving the hcim, each achievement feels great, like who knew fishing big nets for a cosmic talisman would feel good when receiving the drop haha. If I die then oh well, I have a perfectly good grey helm boi to carry on with. I‚Äôd say my main is similar to yours, max gear minus t bow, can buy most items so getting good drops isn‚Äôt exciting anymore. Hcim completely changes that!
---
Thanks! Well yea im max melee so just wondering if I should go bis gear üòÅ
---
I dunno he has realtor friends, I trust him over you, the economic developer that works for the local government /s
---
I vote yes to QoL stuff like tradable rune pouches (seriously, I was hoping to make so much bank of selling them day one, but nooo) but why would I want to vote yes to increasing freeze time or something that will just let me get ganked easier?
---
Bruv just trun the camera
---
Might take 3 hours on a pc but I can assure you it takes a hell of a lot longer on mobile. The telekinetic room was pretty rough. Also no runelite plug-ins to help..
---
Watched the revenant, took a shit, just usual long haul flight shenanigans :)
---
I can't find the post that I saw around the time but here you go

This guy wants to blame bots on the huge decline, but I'll tell you something for free, Jagex isn't going to do a bot cleanup to make their game look less popular a week after arguably their most controversial update ever dropped. Also if you played around that time, you know that bots were rampant. They single handedly 1/10thed the price of the dragon full helm. 
---
https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_full_helm
---
Compare that price drop at the end of 2012 to the Dragon Platebody, another item that was similarly useless before and after EoC, only held value over alch price because of how rare it was, and was not botted to death at the release of EoC.
---
Matter of discipline
---
Yes it does, get better without it
---
Underrated comment
---
You could hear the sounds of clapping all the way to the mage arena
---
Undermining someone else's achievements based on a higher standard is a pretty shameless thing to do.
---
Nothing is more fun then playing with real friends! I wish you guys GL on the journey and hope all of you stay true to the game mode!
---
Appreciate it man!
---
OMGDFAS N O WAY D000D WE R LEAAAKING1!!!
---
Zulrah is one I'd really like. I have both mutagens already so it'd be a complete set. I also wouldn't mind a dag king pet.
---
Sorry for your loss, but to me it sounds like you neee a cc, really brings the social aspect of the game to its peak
---
It depends on the airline
---
I‚Äôm just really confused as to what people thought I meant by this lol
---
You should have started with at least a bronze axe and a tinderbox chop logs then light them in a line.
---
Catch shrimp south of lumbridge for and cook them  you get 200 total in no time.
---
Also I'm pretty sure you will still be able to claim the rewards after the event is over in draynor village from some guy called Django or some shit
---
Pardon the dumb question but what‚Äôs ilpt stand for hah.

Not sure, but I got it from here:

---
But surely you understand the motivation and reasons behind thinking and acting that way.
---
Before they ruined the game the first time around, I had 2 visages in 45 minutes at frost dragons.  On old school I'd say 14kc prime pet probably.
---
Reeeeeee

Dont do no nut november! We must nut for the existence of the earth, pornhub will plant trees for views!

I have a mining cape but i use mythical for d warhammer specs

Ironically he only plays osrs

just some dumb zoomer trend
---
Well... How did it go?
---
Seriously? What a bunch of sad nerds. What has this game come to
---
I mean, if you‚Äôre ready to buy it for 1m from a store, you might aswell just buy the trouver parchment for it lol.

Imagine trying to make money from your job.

This is big dumb right here.

For context, the first image was at the top of this sub about a month ago after Pugger's video about bot farms went viral among OSRS players, and everyone was pissed about bots. Second image is from recently, after Puggers apparently just found a random skiller who wasn't chatting and decided to call them out as a bot in a video.
---
How so?
---
Literally showing your intelligence lmao.
---
dont tell me what to do
---
just wait until she does one small favour
---
Are you implying that never using or owning one gives you perfect knowledge of what's best for everyone?

Nothing impressive, he have people to guard him whole time... Such a pyssy ironmen

Dudes finished now until new content.
---
That‚Äôs crazy, wonder if he‚Äôll start doing other completionist stuff now
---
Birdhouses is the answer to why you'd want to keep training and the solution to get there. Regular runs at the start/end and middle of your play-session can push you over the line and they get better around this level anyway.
---
Given that RuneLite left them in and Adam (the main RuneLite dev) was in talks with one of the Jmods about what needed to be removed and what could stay, it‚Äôs ***probably*** safe.
---
RuneLite is the best one atm, they're working vigilantly to make sure all of their plugins comply with Jagex's recent third party client statements.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Check the OSRS page tho, they just released a defined statement recently mostly outlining what kind of plugins aren't allowed.
---
Do f2p quests with xp rewards and low requirements. I'm pretty sure you can safespot mage in vampire slayer for attack xp. Doric's quest gives mining xp. Knight's sword just requires tanking ice giants/warriors for smithing xp. Witch's potion would get you a few mage levels.
---
No it isn‚Äôt stop spreading misinformation and read the blog post
---
If the behelit was in there too then that's a p good clue, all you have to do now is sacrifice your loved ones. /s

I think black chinchompas are one of the best skilling moneymakers in the game... And happen to be the best hunter xp/h, so yeah. If you wanted a quick-ish 99 that'll net you some nice profit then go for it.
---
Ha, nice try kid. You clearly just messaged yourself.

Probably has public chat off or switched to clan chat.  I routinely miss public interactions like this; especially on mobile.

I got this clue yesterday and got 20 fire runes...

Your account gets locked after X number of failed attempts already, so adding a larger cap to prevent brute force is meaningless.

Can't access the seed bank

trying to organize my bank, any good videos or threads I should check out? thanks!
---
Can you weild salamanders?  Cheap magic xp but it‚Äôs SLOW.  But probably the cheapest combat mage xp in the game considering the cost of the ammo.  Another gp free but time consuming method would be Arceuus library book.  10x magic level per book, if I remember right.
---
The first time I didn't have Prot item on and got barraged while luring Calli, then Calli stacked me the same moment I clicked prot. item! Second time I got AGS spec'd the same tick I tried dosing my Ppot and lost another! Learnt from my mistakes though, never took prot item off again and always made sure my prayer was high! Luckily I had 5 Flails from the Barrows grind. :)
---

---
I mean not really. Cataclysm kind of ruined the ability to do a full scale emerald dream expac
---
Thanks man, can finally move onto the 99 Craft grind!
---
Literally every thing you just bullet pointed is cheating.  If you can't learn the content don't do the content,  a 3pc telling you how to play, where to stand, what to pray, ect is unfair to every person who got shit on while learning the content only to master it later. If you don't want to put the time in to learn a piece of content don't do it at all.
---
If they're only getting $50 for making a video, I'd imagine that extra amount is pretty helpful
---
It's more for leaks in case the hashes get out.
---
Over 75 times ya
---
Oh man, this is hilarious.
---
&gt; every one thought Sick Nerd should have won, when he's not even playing rs atm  
---
To be fair, the golden gnome voting period was before Sick Nerd finished ToB and went to play CoD full time. 
---
I totally agree that the Sparc Mac booing was a bad look for our community and that Curtis deserved at least a nod.
---
but having a wikipedia open on the side of your client with exact pictures of what happens and when to do it IS LITERALLY THE SAME THING
---
could have been hacked, contact customer support through the website and get a ticket, change your email password &amp; RS password also check haveibeenpwned
---
Oh wow I'm so glad he finally get sceptre !
---
Garden of tranquility might give her some desperately needed relaxation
---
Finally get sceptre
---
Imo I'm on the fence. I'm for the idea in the sense I can't see this becoming a power/exp creep. At the same time I'm against it because it's such a minimal qol that id almost rather jmods focus on other issues.
---
do you have any idea to what they increased it to or where to read up on it?
---
Ah because sometimes when I have more than one runelite open and I only change the settings on one then close it it doesn't save on the other one
---
Oi, I'm fucking on it

Yes.

Oh yeah, you‚Äôre right haha
---
Sorry :P
---
what
---
Super excited about this! Hopefully the 12 hour mute doesn‚Äôt get abused. I honestly only report bots 95% of the time. It‚Äôs rare for me to come across normal players who actually deserved to be reported. I just add them to ignore if they‚Äôre toxic lol
---
Except it's not you still have to figure out how to use that information. Not be spoon fed with timers, prayer indicates, ground indicators, ect
---
There's no secret, he's just a liar
---
just take all the dyes n shit and hold spacebar, done in 30 secs.
---
Using this logic everyone who has gone to the wildy and got into a combat scenario Is part of the PvP community.
---
Zammy robes, steel med and long
---
According to the comments curtis needs to do something new every time he gets a good drop.
---
I think he should also look into getting a new laugh every time he laughs at something, can only use one laugh one time.
---
Because it‚Äôs not hard to get one
---
I do a lot of duo bandos gwd and I generally tank. Currently I use verac helm, bcp, and tassets. Every other slot is bis. Is it worth upgrading my armor to justicar?
---
Guy was able to take a ss, should have responded.
---
Might have been afk i guess
---
For its spec
---
Just triggered then.
---
Huh thank you for the explanation! I just don‚Äôt get why people collect it hahaha
---
I usually get 4, so i use 2 doses, just means i only have to get a new pot every other bank trip
---
Yeah item collections are weird... Like 10m of marrentil paste....
---
I can get 6 kills sometimes. But I assume the full dose is cause who is gonna bother splitting the potions to an accurate amount
---
But in the videos the clan always gets demolished by people who are better. Then you die.
---
You arent protected, youre giving someone money to not kill you.
---
who hurt you
---
He asked about the hammer not the maul.
---
Wow you didnt cencor mm2 spoilers wtf this is so sad
---
Dam all their missing is a d med helm for an iconic look
---
Our polling system is horribly undemocratic, given that 25% of boomers who are terrified of change can hold the 75% of us who want the game to improve hostage.
---
Welcome back my man! Add me, I can help you ingame. 
---
Acc name: fe mecatop
---
Also give me ur name to add you
---
It's NNN. Get out of here with those words you sinner. REPENT
---
I personally chose chaos ele because it felt safer and more simple, but I think for chance per hour, venenatis is the best, callsito and vetion are alright, and ele is the worst.  Depends on gear too, I'm just assuming no wildy weapons.
---
Or better yet, make the attack option 'hidden' for both npc and player
---
I had sounds on, but for the most part it was based off visuals.
---
Tanzanite fang on 1st drop at zulrah upon release. Was 18m at the time.
---
Wow. That's a really convincing scam for new/younger players. 
---
I'm not sure what jagex really can do about this though. Could maybe try to hit them with copyright infringement, but I don't see that stopping scammers like that.
---
Not a new place to bot im sure karambwans have been strongly botted ever since they changed karambwan fishin
---
I haven't played much on this particular account but I have significant time sunk into another that I main on OSRS.
---
He didn‚Äôt buy any protection, viewers and clan mates helped him lmao
---
Inferno cape users be like: MOHHAHAHA
---
What you don't think the RS version of Romeo and Juliette is amazing?
---
The above message was brought to you by [RAID SHADOW LEGENDS]
---
RS' take on it could be but only if it was written by someone with a modicum of competence
---
Maybe for a bit but it won't last long since it's a temporary event. Thanks for the heads up though, gotta make use of this on my f2p uim
---
I know people do dart fletching in between alchs because you get that half second before the spellbook switches back from the inventory
---
They did do a ban sweep for infernal cape rwt maybe yours accidentally got caught up in the mix?
---
Congrats! Working on my 9th try now! Persistence is key!
---
Pick flax, sell to general store
---
I say UIM, I think it'll be cooler than a hardcore and I haven't looked at hiscore but it's probably easier to get high up on there(?)

I don‚Äôt drink so that‚Äôs a no go

1 day into NNN and the sub is hugging and caressing eachother tenderly.

 I saw an ad on the TV the other day for this. It's a plague lol.

[Got it! :D](https://imgur.com/gallery/IErjeUN)
---
No
---
&gt;more loot means less loot
---
are you a conservative
---
I always thought UIM was more prestigious than HCIM
---
I think he asked because if you are leaving or burying any bones you can make another 11k every trip by bringing .5 dose and banking an extra bone. Would only matter if you have inventory issues
---
I hate the telekinetic room too lol. I know they buffed it so you don't have to stand still anymore and you don't have to be in a straight line anymore either, but it's still clunky and slow. It would be nice if we could get bonus points for the 10th/50th successful telekinetic puzzles as well.
---
Yea or starts getting harassed by a horde of fanboys ingame
---
Dang dude, nice grind, gonna have to play catch-up with some of your questing probably. But good stuff. Forgot how much melee influences Combat lvl. I'm 96 range, 90 mage and have like 3 combat lvls on you lol, 80 att/def and 89 strength also 
---
Mind if I add you when I hop on in 30mins or an hour?
---
40 rune scim
---
50 granite hammer
---
60 dragon scim
---
65 cudgel?
---
70 abyssal whip/dagger
---
I just always bring full potions, when I stop by ge to restock I just decant them.
---
The first one did but i gor another hot step and it didnt show on rl i was pissed
---
Doesnt say anything about player count. Next.
---
I don‚Äôt always but it does help. It also is nice to use 1 dose stamina pots before running to hydra or the dog, maybe other uses too which you can drink then smash vial at the bank and take an extra food quickly
---
Ha ha ha yeah look how edgy I can be ha ha I am edgelord master 3000 ha ha ha
---
I wonder how much that guy paid to get this ad up that shit cost money
---
Bring melee gear for woox walk or just walk it out and chill
---
I'm glad you're literally in this person's head and know exactly what actions they'll take in the future. very cool
---
just give me 5 minutes in photoshop
---
I used the flinch safespot with crystal halberd along with glory/black dhide.  Suicided my stuff in edgeville before every trip, but I still risked a few untradeables like seed box, rune pouch, and my ava's assembler.  I usually got around 10 kills per hour, and only saw about 5 pkers in 130ish kills, none of which managed to kill me.  It was pretty painful, but it's probably my proudest item on that account so far!
---
Sceptre get!
---
If people knew they dropped their scales and darts in bp, they \*could\* be less likely to bring it to wildy, same goes for any chargeable staff or melee weapon.
---
Download Runelite and switch it to you're desired version. It has overlays to mock the older original client versions.
---
Well that's sure boring. Thanks!
---
Can alch while running for farming/runecrafting
---
Am a girl, play OSRS
---
Advertising for what?
---
Yep, definitely
---
I think so too. I mean, not dying when training agility is not all that hard
---
Check [haveIbeenpwned.com](http://haveIbeenpwned.com) to see if it got leaked anywhere
---
That what comes up when i try to open the osrs client
---
The new client proposal was going to be in a modern scripting language. Totally possible to run on a browser if they ever go through with it.
---
Jesus, that's some dedication. I haven't played in months now (seems like I always play in small bursts and take long breaks), but I've never grinded that hard lol.
---
Especially with money. I never seemed capable of making the big bucks like some players do.
---
That‚Äôs almost 1 ranger boot per week for 5 years straight. That‚Äôs also under 200 clues per week average so nice job on being on the right side of rng! Absolute beast accomplishment.
---
You might want to get that 'tip' checked before offer it as a reward
---
Venenatis singles safespot with msb(i) is super chill but its like 10 kills hr
---
Ohhhh I thought you meant that people could just skip the entire process and then buy one for a mil instead. Yea fair enough. You should only be able to buy one if you have got one before then
---
Oooo, we've been reduced to name-calling. I'ma back out here lads... But first make sure to try out this free new hero game: [RAID SHADOW LEGENDS]
---
https://i.imgur.com/xV8nZSu.jpg
---
Wait till you hear about runecrafting!
---
With two fingers and lots of practice with timing :)
---
91 fm in a week with WT is really not that crazy. Irons can just steal a few 100 cakes in Ardy and be set, no other supplies needed.
---
Thanks I worked hard on this and am proud!
---
That doesn't make sense at all
---
Wowie, when did you get pmod
---
As someone mentioned prior: [Optimal Quest Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) 
---
RuneScape is an insanely open ended RPG, and for some people that is pretty intimidating. The quest guide is totally optional but it will give you a structured guideline on figuring out and setting yourself some goals. 
---
If you do quests, and use guides, I highly recommend spending your time and reading the dialogue. The quests are fantastic and will definitely be less of a chore than most people make questing to be.
---
What do you find most difficult? I'm sure people on here will be more than happy to give you some tips on troublesome areas of the fight.
---
Didn't Shakespeare write it?
---
Would it be awkward if I unedit my edit?
---
Would you alch it for 10M?
---
Haha what the fuck are you talking about
---
This is like it just time travelled from 2006
---
That would really annoy me.
---
Agreed. These other dudes have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.
---
Appreciate it. Gonna try with the serp helm later.
---
I guess his fireball attacks. Tried ranging, then melee. Got slightly further with melee. Had anti-dragonfire shield, was told super anti-dragonfire pot would help. Still getting annihilated. I've heard about walking to avoid it, but I can't seem to get it down.
---
What weapon are you using to get that many kills?
---
Galvek is much much harder maybe you should lvl up more or try to get better gear. I feel like you are just postponing the inevitable. Good luck!
---
Keep your max account and afk on it while you Iron your man. You can use bonds on your Ironman to keep its membership active. It keeps your non-Ironman account valuable.
---
It's basically a bunch of small quests in a big one but not as bad as RFD
---

Go back to pressing frostbolt only in classic. Everyone who‚Äôs playing classic right now has been deep throating that garbage and shitting on anything that has to do with retail.

If i leave anything it's always 1 or 2 d'hide at the very most, but 90% of the time i take all loot from 4 kills

Shit, tyvm for the reminder!

I‚Äôll pass it up the chain.
---
Damn where is that

Fell down one of the Veitcong traps during regicide and got stuck in the ground?

This whole thing seems a bit dodgy, just saying

Sitting in line at the grain elevator, line takes 1.5-2 hours. I got a phone, charger, and unlimited data. I'm doing farm runs while doing farm runs lol.
---
No it doesnt. I need to be shown data from 2006-2014.
---
Nice man, now you just need a few def levels and b gloves and youll be ready to start slaying
---
No thanks.
---
Genuine question, are you leaving hides for those kills? Because my inv is full after 4 kills
---
What a monster of a drop chance. 
---
A little unsolicited advice: If you have no plans with that coin you just made, I‚Äôd recommend leveling that prayer just a tad. At least to 50 until you get yourself another valuable drop. The rest of that bag can go to any gear or supplies that will increase you efficiency in barrows.
---
Use DDS if you don't have claws for spec.
---

---
I think his point is that rarely do quests (a fairly isolated part of the game) become the make or break point for the average player, as they can be avoided or rushed through.
---
How do I get these notifications on mobile?
---
Nobody in top 3k died so nothing too crazy was lost.
---
I got VERY lucky on flips. I grinded nothing at all. I flip everyday, I also work from home so leave my account on NMZ while I work to train combats :)
---
Crazy what can be accomplished when you use your popularity to hold a rev world but get people banned if they attack you in a pvp environment
---
?
---
I'm 120 combat with 87 Range and 97 HP. I'm pretty sure I'm just using a bad strategy.

---
None of the points you've made mean much at all, though. They just mean that if he is indeed profiting off of it then he's just smarter than some of the other idiots that've sold out and isn't being so blatant about it.
---
The attacks on bots could just be planned to save face. Him "encouraging Jagex to shut them down" means absolutely nothing because he's only "reporting" on scripts that Jagex are already on to.
---
The thing is even if he isn't in cahoots with bot makers he's undoubtedly still helped them out - all he's done for months on end is show hundreds of thousands of people how profitable bots are.
---
I did, it's actually pretty good but it's way too grindy and p2w
---
Hi guys, it's op's girlfriend here. One small favour was indeed even worse. I kind of wanted to explore the game by myself and play as people did back in the day without having to read a guide!
---
All you do is click away during the fireball. If you see it in the air, click. That simple.
---
Amethyst alts are pretty common though.
---
watching it back a few times, he runs into the same spot lol
---
This is a common misconception. I stand by what I said, in RL, OSB prices are ONLY ever shown on a single line in the in-game GE interface, not the panel.
---
Here's proof/examples: [https://i.imgur.com/ONtCbRh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ONtCbRh.png)
---
It's very easy to test this yourself if you think it's fabricated/shopped or whatever. And no it's not because I'm using inactive items, you can see that with the 3a range coif in the pic, and you can also see it if you test something like rune items. I chose 3a because I knew the discrepancy would be obvious.
---
Here is Adam, the owner of RL, saying it is used very minimally because they don't want to depend on OSB: [https://i.imgur.com/vOM7Osi.png](https://i.imgur.com/vOM7Osi.png)

Gilded cup has a higher cons req than 65

Nah, talking to the bartender and repeatedly buying the drinks. They're all 3gp and I'm sure they sell for more on the ge
---
that doesnt even look close to it
---
When youre so overly rich you can collect 3a longswords. Sounds like you play a bit too much
---
Still better then a Soup guide
---
I like that I spelled ‚Äùsquire‚Äù correct one time and wrong two times
---
Yea. Not a jad phase. I just keep getting smacked 30s and 40s and am just panic eating non stop during his Blue phase. I've only ever got 1 kill at Zulrah because I always run out of food. Is void too low for zulrah?

'Rc is the worst skill' says who? The reddit mob? Tons of people like it. The game is not going to cater to JUST you

for what?

im 77 hunter with only questing and birdhouses. Really good method, agreed
---
I use void for my range switch, but if you're low defence you might find it worth it to switch to something with more range def bonus. I might suggest using the big hits to your advantage with vengeance as well, and also bring some karambwans for combo food.
---
If you keep asking someone who also needs it will join you
---
Sounds like a flip waiting to happen
---
I‚Äôd say classic is 10x worse. Bfa is shit, I agree. Legion was really good. Don't base your entire opinion of WoW on one shitty xpac. But since youre a classic fanboy, i already know you will.
---
Stake it

Its already crashed to the ground lmao. Delete this!

This is how mobile users flex on client users
---
no offense mate but no one asked how much you play

I brings karams as well. Defence is 79. Unfortunately I'm only 84 magic so venge is quite a bit off lol. Thanks for the help anyway noveq

I don‚Äôt hate them for what they do. I understand. But I still don‚Äôt agree. So I neither support not actively fight them. They don‚Äôt really affect the economy that much. 100s of players have hundreds of bils. A few dorks making 50m gp to sell is whatever
---
no reason to panic eat, just stay calm and dont die. you dont need to be at 99 hp, just stay at a range where you can be killed in one hit. Try to use time when you cannot attack the boss to prio healing back up when possible.
---
Yeah like max combat raids.
---
Really happy that all of you guys are potheads and alcoholics as well :,)
---
annnd the joke went right over your head
---
Ah ok. I never got really deep into all the member's stuff and all the different strats for leveling your character.

Yeah but then you have less room for supplies.

Yes, it's fine

The guys solution below solved it. Thanks for your help though.

you also take screenshots wrong

Jagex put them on things other than regular blacks, Metal and KBD. Brutals did wonders for it, same with the Rune dragons.

I did it not that long ago, it really wasnt that bad. Make your own teams and use your best judgement on who to invite.
---
I got dchain occult and pet within 30 kills on my first thermy task.
---
I'm generally against using alts for iron gameplay but using an alt to lure chaos ely to the safespot is an insanely fast and easy way to get the dragon pickaxe, so that's what I did.
---
Your iron is just standing in one spot, and you hop worlds to attack the chaos ely that your alt lured, so your iron is basically in combat with chaos ely 99% of the time.
---
Wish I could come with my Ironman but I am out of seeds for the crops I want to plant. Only have 30 farming also.

So like if you want me to hold your hand I can. No trading. No GE. Everything you have to get on your own. So pretty FUCKIN HARD. Better?

You sir, are blessed! üôè

No thanks, waste of time
---
Collector is probably the easiest role for a first-timer. The most important thing is to call quickly with the horn in your inventory. You will need to call every 30s. If you're playing on runelite there will be a 30s countdown timer so you know when you will need to call. Go to the BA world, enter the first room. Make sure accept aid is turned on, then advertise the role you want by saying 'collector here' or 'col here'. Someone will invite you to join their team. Good luck!

shutthefuckupboomer your game is dead
---
Fair enough, you do you
---
It's not incredibly different until you start slaying. you start off questing just like rs3 but once you actually start slaying it's like 15k xp an hour on most tasks so there's a long time before you actually get to play the game.
---
Died on yesterdays server lag / crash at Port Phasmatys farming patch. Vampire teleported on me, killed me through the ring of life. Only few weeks played. Decided to make 1 more. When todays lag hit I was in Draynor bank and someone had lured a dark wizard to kill the bots. Survived with 1 hp this time. This mode isn't for me I quess. Too much stress.
---
If this is real, what was wrong with 10 year old you's spelling?

If you‚Äôre killing vorkath properly 9/10 times the limiting factor for trip length is running out of space for loot. Food/prayer hardly ever run out.

Vanilla Runelite is perfectly safe with the plugins provided, just make sure you are playing the most updated version.
---
It's just an isnignificant amount of money and you waste time keeping it to 100% and collecting. You can simply do 2-3 vorkath trips and gain the same money for less effort cause it's not a daily.
---
Yes, they had a lot of comms with jagex before this update/statement. This was to ensure they removed plugins or features jagex was properly outlining were against the rules.

You can use that old account to log in to osrs just have to start from scratch just like everyone else and then that account will work for both osrs and rs3
---
In f2p, you grind out money and xp, turns into a chore.
---
Members is when you start playing the game.
---
What do you mean by 'with the plugin provided'?
---
I downloaded it a few days ago from runelite.net
---
idk
---
Wow dude that‚Äôs amazing!
---
glad we could make your experience feel more rewarding :)
---
Your account progress will be on rs3 however you can use the same login for osrs
---
Just use w330, it takes about 5 seconds longer each time but saves you at least 50m
---
Join Fe Reborn! Small and friendly. Everyone knows eachoter
---
&gt;No, even if you're geared. If you are specifically targeting one person, regardless of the circumstances, it's bannable. Fullstop. You could be risking 5b and it'd still count.
---
Wrong, it's not. 
---
&gt;Location and content does not matter.
---
Lol... No one is forcing you to play in the wilderness. Killing you won't get me banned, regardless of number of kills. Wildy = you accept death. Unless luring is involved, you can't say shit. You have the power to stop the PKer, that's how it's different. Whereas in PVE you can't do shit if someone crashes you. So, of course PVE and PVP differ significantly, which is why you can't compare the two. 
---
Show me evidence of PKing 1 guy over and over in full gear being bannable (Jmod strictly saying so) otherwise it's misinformation and fearmongering.

you ever watched his stream? thats not all he does

I do several runs from 1 inventory of food/ppots. Using ardy cloak to restore prayer every time, then barrows tab to return back. I maximize rune potential through having morytania hard diaries done and by obtaining 86.2% favor (2 skeletons, 1 bloodworm). That's why I leave all of those runes in my inventory, because I know I will be receiving them all at one point within the trip. Makes banking less cluttered. The only set of runes that is there due to laziness are the fire runes. When I would switch to my dragon defender and dds to use my 4 specs on Ahrim I would have to switch back to Iban's Staff and my Tome of Fire. Well since I didn't have any fire runes I would have to reset the magic spell selection every single time. Just got annoying, so I threw the fire runes in there to prevent that from happening.

All of the sneaking around and catching rats.

There is no G.E. App like their is( or was, havint played in awhile) for WOW but there is mobile osrs and you can be at the ge so it‚Äôs as simple as teleporting there! Hope that helps ya
---
I agree, it was my least favorite quest by far
---
yeah this guys logic is reeeally dumb.  basically excusing streamers to bring bils into the wildy and making pking of them a bannable offense.  Also under his logic you can't fight off the clans pimping out rev worlds because that would be "targeted harassment" too
---
Btw if anyone else decided to do this, I believe obsidian platebodies are the best gp per tokkul.

Stronghold of Security prepared me for that exact moment!!!

still missing obors club(doing hill giants offstream for it), easy-medium clues(onstream) after that all pets starting with slay bosses and finishing up hard and elite clues that way aswell. Going to play leagues for the rewards too and group ironman once that comes out aswell.
---
Two guys can be a cute couple!
---
Just wanted to let you know, most people blur out the stats and whatnot to hide their identity.
---
(There are sites that can let you look up players accounts based on stats)
---
But you didn‚Äôt even blur out your IGN. So I‚Äôm just confused
---
What does the first pool even do again
---
It's just a meme dude, lol. And you didn't even blur out your username. If stats were possible to hack you with then the high scores would be a huge security issue
---
3pcs didn't save the game. GE, ironman, and continuous slayer updates did
---
Bruh. He makes his whole living off that merch store basically. He doesn't upload often enough for ad revenue to help him, and he doesn't stream Swamp Man that I know of. Those "thousands" he's making off the merch store look a lot less impressive when that's most of his income.
---
And banter between content creators is nothing new. I voted for Rendi and was sad the other edit got there, but that's how limited rewards work.
---
Like what happed with the vagas massacre...
---
This was a really cool behind the scenes thing, it‚Äôs a good filler for the main content. Settled, if you read this, just know we appreciate the content, no matter how long it takes to release, and these mini in between videos are always welcome. 
---
Ps owo J1mmy plz
---
So what's preventing you from just taking the name and not paying?
---
To add to this; if you‚Äôre on the tile where the fire ball lands, it will one hit you no matter what (Over 100 damage), one tile away and it‚Äôs half the damage, around 50. Two tiles like baked said and you take 0 damage.
---
He streamed all revs, protection doesnt allow you to do that. Plus he didn't pay anyone to protect him.
---
i didnt understand why all people censored their stats in the first place but i just did it because everyone does so... im livestreaming this also so there actually was no real point of censoring since everyone could just tune into the stream and look at them.. but at least now i know why people do this. Thanks!

How does buying clues work ?

Stop realising filler I already read the manga and just want to see the end animated.

i guess lol :D

Congrats man

hashes?

Ur off ur rocker if you think Jagex doesn‚Äôt keep those puppies in plain text. We‚Äôre talking about a company that left a tbow spawned in as a ground item, had staff stealing accounts, and doesn‚Äôt test items on death before pushing to production.
---
Their code more of a joke than corporate software
---
For slayer? After sote can cannon them in the market place in prif.
---
presumably its not in yet because all of jagex's systems are archaic. i wouldnt care if it was added but i feel like thats time that could be spent on more relevant things

It's would not be that difficult to import the capes over from rs3. I doubt its would drastically alter release schedule to release.
---
Not that great of RNG but I got Skotos and dark claw on 6kc
---
This, but it also changes. When you once hit that lucky streak and get around 5b, you won't play the game without staking anymore. After u lose that 4b back, u just stake and won't do anything without completely bis items in bank. Then u do one raid or slay task and go back to stake. 
---
Welcome to my life.
---
My only way to prevent this happening; quit main and start an ironman and 1-75def builds.
---
jagex literally have to be delusional to think anyone is paying 11 dollars a month or 6m per every 14 days to play on that dumpster fire known as the vanilla client. like literally lmao. actually a complete embarrassment.
---
Each onyx bolt tip is currently 8k, so 3.5 bolts would cover the per inventory cost of sacreds. The thing is an inventory of internals is much faster to obtain. At the 1/16 rate of bolt tips you should receive 3.5 tips in 56 eels on average which is about 2.24 inventories on just bolt tips.
---
I know that fishing internals is faster due to the level; maybe not 2.24:1 faster but infernals also generate profit off of lava scales and tokkul which would bring that number down.
---
So I'll stand by my original statement that internals are more afk, more exp, and better money for the average player as compared to sacred eels. The only thing that makes this close is zulrahs scales are up in value from when I made my initial tests like 6 months ago.
---
Also super antifire.
---
The whole point is to reward a select few who dedicate their time to obtaining something. By this logic, image castle wars armour should be removed as not even 1% of playerbase would even have it.
---
a  boring solo game mode saved an mmorpg lul what?
---
Well, is he wrong?
---
But no one is asking him how much he played or how much I played, thats why it makes no sense lol.
---
He was literally trying to bait those early comments so that he could find a way to tell people how little he plays, you see shit like this all the time on the sub. His comment makes no sense because I never mentioned how much I play, but if you're interested I have 66 firemaking and I think wintertodt is a complete waste of life. I hope you're impressed by my lack of hours.
---
I‚Äôve never gotten one and I‚Äôm not lying when I say I have buddies(multiple) who have pkd an eternal of RCers
---
His viewerbase is not 12 years olds, you can literally say that about any successful osrs streamer who screeches like a whale any time they get a drop.   
---
Staking and PvP are not divisive period it's part of the game always has been always will be, without PvP we wouldn't of seen osrs come back.  He's not even toxic if you consider what he does "toxic" than so is sicknerd, skillspecs, odablock, boaty, faux, the list goes on and on.  Faux is by far not the only streamer to come off as a know it all cunt. 
---
To your third point this has nothing to do with fortnite, the communities don't cross over especially with sparc. His personality is normal when he isn't hammered drunk, he talks like a normal person when he isn't hammered drunk, just because you don't like him being loud doesn't mean most people do. No streamer in osrs engages his chat like sparc, every stream is quite literally a feel good party regardless of content.  
---
To your last point his streams aren't for children and 100% not the fortnite community, you would know that if you ever watched his stream and didn't just have preconceived notions of it.  There is a reason when he switches from osrs to fortnite he drops from 1k+ viewers to 200
---
Love this community

I've done all the level 5 diary requirements in two days on 306 w/randoms as well. I've only had one walkout, almost everyone else came back after a while. You could  try Casual BA as mentioned here, but I think the best experience is just learning it with randoms. I'd also be glad to take you along for some games.
---
See you at the top brother
---
what's that addy armor gon do without a scimitar
---
yeah but the good thing about rs is you don't have to pay attention while doing boring things like skilling. the problem is fun and engaging content is only really at the endgame so...i guess people just don't have motivation.
---
Hi it's me Deadly Farts

Where u at
---
Kurasks/Barrows
---
I mean 40 minutes is really long for a quest with a guide. If you don‚Äôt count all the quests that have been made since osrs release, one small favor is one of the longest quests in the game. Iirc the only quests that are longer are mep2, regicide, maybe underground pass, legends quest, desert treasure. I‚Äôm probably missing some but compared to the vast majority of quests that can be completed in 10-15 mins one small favor is really long
---
I want cheaper herblore secondaries though
---
Buying bonds
---
It takes 2 seconds to kill them, I've probably  pked about 30m from people bringing cash stacks, runes, teleports, etc.
---
And I anti pk while a do clues... none of the pkers expect an ags to wack them.
---
Prayer pots and super restores are about the same.price last I checked. Currently and iron sinfo might be old. Basically you get 4 more prayer points for the same price tho
---
Zulrah can be considerably faster with those levels. Keep at it and upgrade the gear when you can. Blowpipe first.
---
You‚Äôll make some money and learn the boss for even faster kills.
---
Wow, you beat me by 7,395 kc!

I got the image from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/dqn8yq/invest_in_this_under_used_format/

Worth mentioning as well that RL already removed the plugins Jagex was banning, so as long as you don‚Äôt circumvent what RL already offers, you‚Äôre fine.
---
I stand by my last week and a half experience of doing it that sacred is worse xp and almost 2x better gp per hour. I told you my own gains. Most people would probably find fishing sacred is more/faster money as well.
---
Never knew I felt this way until I read it. I hate bots and it activates me a lot.
---
So...?
---
? They made a list of banned plugins, and runelite has removed them all

How was Underground Pass? :\^)
