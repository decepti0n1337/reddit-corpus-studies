Not all newer methods are better.  It doesn't really have much to do with time, except that dev's are motivated to make their methods competitive in order for people to actually use them.  NMZ is used over gorillas because it's FASTER, fundamentally.  Both because of boosting pots/powerups and because of lower defense enemies (because you select them strategically).  Also, it's safe.  All non-traditional OSRS things that most players agree don't fit in.
---
---
---
Embrace it. It'll come.
---
[removed]
---
or they could add pre-eoc vanguard, trickster and battle mage armour lmao. 
---

---
on a serious note though, i wouldn't be against it
---
Every time you cut there's a 1/8 chance of depletion (except normal trees which always drop, and redwoods which are 1/11). 
---
You have a chance to receive a log every 4 game ticks (2.4 seconds) with dragon axe, not sure if it scales with tool level but I assume so. 
---
The chance of receiving a log is proportional to your own level and inversely proportional to the level of tree you're cutting (higher wc lvl -&gt; higher chance to get a log, lower tier tree -&gt; higher chance to get a log). May also scale with tool level, idk
---
There are tick manipulation methods that take advantage of game mechanics to let you get a 'cut chance' more often than every 4 ticks but most people don't do those since they're much more effort than ordinary afking.
---
Uhh, no idea. Whatever 490k addy darts costs if you're talking about fletching, few hundred mills overall
---
It's actually not. If you just spent half of your time doing literally nothing in between banks you'll still get more XP from bstaffs.
---
Cosmetics should be an in game achievement like they always have been, not "pay 5$ or you can't have it"
---
I mean, shortening the animations and speeding them up aren't necessarily the same things. I imagine they could probably find a way to simply not have the boss idling for 2 seconds at the start and end of every animation in the fight.
---
Would be very interesting to figure out what percentage of osrs players actively browse this sub, although I’m not sure how you could go about doing that.
---
Hé deserves it even if hé didn't bot.
---
The cunt plagues Ash and other jmods daily for nonsensical stuff and pure insulting complaints
---
Mostly, I did about 100 kc with one tho, I like the flow better with BP but that’s me.
---
No, you still have to bring the runes and be on standard spellbook to cast the spell
---
LMFAO. I did the same thing basically, was skipping everywhere I went when I got mine.
---
&gt;If you need a way to sink gold, fine. If you need a way to craft magic armor, fine. Just don't fool yourself into thinking it will make the game more enjoyable to sit at the bank and buy ANOTHER skill.
---
This has actually swayed me
---
More like Netflix and skill.
---
Correct
---
Hard to say, the cape is nice at least
---
This
---
which recolours?
---
I've played 25 games and have had maybe 1 fight that I didn't get absolutely fucking wrecked in.
---
50k+ is pretty high as far rentals go tbh. For me at least.
---
I agree with you for most stuff, I don't pretty rarely, but stuff like mystic robes + tome +staff for the occasional magic-weak slayer task.
---
Though as time goes on and the cash goes up, I can afford to have more gear just sitting in the bank.
---
When I was cash strapped though, swapping out gear sets for another one was really useful.
---
And I mean, 50k-100k is a 1-2% margin on single a 5m flip. Not hard to take that hit imo! And that doesn't even take into account the chance of an item selling for the same, or even at a profit!
---
I have 5b in the bank, that matters jagex!
---
Voting no because it devalues 2000 total level
---
Bisco this weekend anyone going?
---
Goblins northwest of lumbridge, near the cows/windmill
---
but he could lose rank1
---
No, not at all. I'm just saying LMS isn't where someone who wants to learn PvP should go.
---
Why repost this?
---
Probably enrich if you're a normal account, numulite isn't worth much.
---
That's because of all the people who vote no for the sake of voting no
---
damn dog you really convinced me to vote yes on warding
---
maybe I'll make even more alts that hit the voting criteria to vote no with
---
&gt;Make the game more engaging, by adding skills that will be fun and engaging rather than oh look at this new grind we made for you
---
That's dungeoneering which imo is fine as a minigame not a skill tho.
---
Never heard of screen capture?
---
Agree. They could even write a sequel to What Lies Below which unlocks access to the fabric/silk you use to make the dagon'hai robes. However the wielding reqs don't necessarily have to go beyond WLB.
---
More like constructive criticism instead of calling it straight trash.
---
The entire reason they give you these free level up boxes is to try and get you addicted you know that right? Now I personally don't buy them but it doesn't Change the fact that it is a predatory system and people like you defending these horrible systems are the reason gaming companies keep trying to push all this MTX shit in our faces.
---
Karma is a bitch.
---
A guy posted a screenshot of him getting banned for botting saying it was his first offense and crying. Turns out it wasn't his first offense. That's it
---
How did you make the model of the player?
---
You had to gather charms first which was the longest/most time consuming part of summoning before you could run from the bank to the obelisk..
---
You sound like a loser.
---
Just because players utilize it doesn't make it good content, there's a reason jagex is trying to make it less appealing by removing things from the shop.
---
NMZ takes all the fun out of training combat yet players feel the need to do it because it's the most efficient method - this makes combat the only skill in the game where the afk method is more efficient than any other
---
Jagex don't poll integrity changes because even though the community might not want a certain change, sometimes it's better for the game.
---
But as I said in my previous comment, that's just my opinion
---
212 kc claw and 232 kc pet :)
---
"Mimic the look of..."
---
the only detail you must know is that the community was obviously against it with a "no fuck this, this will devalue this" attitude
---
Yeah, dying over 1000 times before I'm not trash at PvP is not something that sounds fun to me.
---
DH scales damage on how many hitpoints you have missing (and STR etc) so if you have higher HP and STR then you'll get better rates there.
---
Obby is just the best below DH that in 99% of cases where you aren't fighting a slayer monster, an undead or whatever. Cheap, easy and accessible DPS gear. I found it to be the best for my training style even after mid-90s, all the way to 200m attack/defence and I'm working on Strength with it now too.
---
Playing with the above sheet, I think you might beat Obby with something stupid like rapier and BIS everything but who wants to spend like 300m for a very small gain - we're talking about literally only a few hours difference from 60/60/60 to 99/99/99.
---
\^\^ my thoughts exactly. Just make no summoning zones for certain content. Inferno, pvp, TOB, COX, ect.
---
1 point of data is a trend
---
pepega
---
I would let him slide on the crummy shotgun if he had actually thought about his choice of beer. Why not use "landshark" for the luls?
---
i mean...it says it right there "in this mode you die"
---
People like new content. I'm pretty sure it passes handily, 80%+
---
Congrats man :’)
---
As an Australian, I'd say the yanks have nothing on our concentration camps, and that they should up their level or get out of the game
---
Honestly they should enact a small tax on the G.e to revitalize person on person trading.
---
Nice
---
I seem to recall going in his house, teasing him by mentioning his incomplete nexus, and immediately getting kicked out XD almost positive that happened.
---
It seems like a forced expansion of crafting. I suppose there is a small void to fill in the lore of magic armor, but not enough to warrant a new skill.
---
I mean if you're bad at switching in the first place you're gonna have a bad time. Loads of PvM'er content creators have been getting wins
---
Thanks, isn't Bludgeon strictly better than hasta?
---
What? Max players are voting no to this just to keep max cape? If they are not willing to accept new skills, they do not deserve max cape.
---
You can see active players and know that isn't true.
---
"too much dev time" boy, if I haven't heard that one a million times.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
Looks like you need 75 def
---
Buy bonds
---
You can probably do zulrah if you have trident and blowpipe, if not then you can do barrows with a super budget setup to get 70 pray then do the hard mory diary then go back to barrows. You could also camp brutal black dragons, gargoyles or skeletal wyverns for lower attention.
---
If you wanna do skilling instead then you could craft nats or do farming, those are decent money.
---

Inb4 someone goes there and immediately gets pked

Ranged defence on the rune legs massively outweighs the tiny bit of negative mage defence
---
I wouldn't mind no updates for half a year for 1k bankspace.
---
OP isn't the guy who got banned
---
Are you in Australia by any chance?
---
True, but IMO having a constant progression of increasingly better gear
---
is more fun than hoping for the RNG Gods to bless you with one single incredibly rare drop.
---
Yeah I botted mining to 99. Got a 2 week ban and final warning. I have never botted since. Now im 1800+ total
---
Wat.
---
Almost all champions are on a similar power curve. You only need 2-3 champions in each role. Playing tons of champions HARMS you in League. You’ll never have an instinctive knowledge of the champion’s skills and won’t know what fights you can and can’t take. That forces you to think more about micro and less about macro, which hurts your gameplay. 
---
Trying to play a certain champion because he “counters” another is liable to make you lose the game. Just have two champions that do two different jobs. With Top lane as an example, play Mordekaiser and Malphite. One is a lane bully and is dominant in 1v1s. The other is a play-making teamfight tank. There’s your two champions. If one gets countered, likelihood is the other answers that weakness.
---
Not that you even need 2-3 champions. There are many Challenger OTPs.
---
Dharok is better at 92 hp and above. So higher levels use dharok, lower use obby.
---
Artisans time has come and gone. If it was introduced earlier in the life span of the game or during proposed to be implemented during the next new player surge like we had with mobile maybe.
---
Sailing i was all for sadly it didn't happen.
---
Summoning ho boy... Despite the skill being well designed for the training process and all the rewards were OP. The only way id vote it in is if we removed the following monsters. Unicorn, Bunyip, Terrorbird, War Tortise, All the 80+ titans, and the Pack Yak
---
Dust devils at 65, kurasks at 70, skeletal wyverns (kinda) at 72, gargoyles at 75, brutal black dragons (kinda) at 77, nechryael at 80. Some are only kinda good because the tasks are short unless you extend them.
---
Admit it.  You only posted this so someone would say "username checks out"
---
no, it was banned back in 2010, it was the only time I botted, and I was banhammered for it
---
I was just sharing that I got permabanned on my first offense... and while I don't like it, i deserved it
---
Most of the people in Olympus CC are like that (and he's their leader lmao... or was their leader?).
---
These guys are the ones that got Arceuus Library RC and smoke dungeon alts nerfed by tweeting JMods directly. I guess they have a lot of influence since they're maxed?
---
Yes but I mean what can you build at 91 lol
---
That's like $66, need some MTX to make up for that loss in coin $_$
---
But why would we dissolve expensive gear rather than just things like steel plate bodies..?
---
Cope from a country with a low GDP
---
Bot..5b..welp move along.
---
I felt this..
---
I think they're in a better position to determine what is and what is not more beneficial in the long-run of the game. If you feel like you might be able to, feel free to apply. They're hiring more often than not, so it's worth a try.
---
Those dice bots in the GE. Lose all your cash or make a shit ton, it was meant to be.
---
Stats?
---
Right on my man
---
Yeah fuck all that shit
---
obama's going to prison.
---
I played a ton back in middle school all those years ago and started new account recently etc. I play it mostly on laptop but have it on my phone too. What do you all like to do on mobile? What handles the best I guess is the question maybe. Thanks. You all are great
---
I never bothered with leaving preserve on w/ range pots. Doesn’t matter too big of a deal. Range pots don’t even cost a lot, so you can just repot every 3 levels or so.
---
sadly Max players are one of the larger voting groups as the invest the most time into the game. and its not that hard to reach 25% fail rate when PvPers do like to spite vote. There is the sentiment of purists that vote no to everything. It really isn't that hard to get the 25% no vote
---
Jagex please
---
The current rune pouch is used in the upgraded rune pouch recipy though so it remains in the game
---
Nerd.
---
Only an RS player can shotgun that bad
---
Its jjst like telling someone to go to runelite.net or to their discord. Its just a gray area to the advertising website rule
---
Why are you against it? I don't like everything in it but OSRS needs to get over this final bump of autistic 'no change' screeching imo.
---
Construction sucks, farming sucks, hunter is *ok*. Their track record of new skills is terrible. Dungeoneering was cool, but it was a mini game, not a skill. 
---
Whatever, I left before and I’ll leave again if it changes too much.
---
It's not too hard to explain, basically Jagex said they wanted to slightly nerf bulwark and Reddit completely freaked out, filling the entire front page with brainlet memes. The pvp community on Twitter then called for the deletion of the subreddit. In all honesty seeing people get genuinely worked up over this shit was hilarious.
---
This entire post is a whinge about how toxic the community is for attacking warding and burying any positive feedback, all the upvoted comments claim to agree that those people suck. And you're still downvoted. This community is awful
---
Where in Australia are you to get bad ping? WA?
---
They added this quest so people would have a excuse for their female characters
---
New skills would be fine.... as long as it’s not as fucking stupid as warding.
---
I thought the dock was pretty straightforward, just requires patience. But fuck Kruk's cave and the tank route. Died so many times
---
That is messed up, Jagex should un-ban him and get their customer support together.
---
Add me in game within the next few mins and I'll get you some extra rune I have RSN: Slazket
---
Now Shotgun a beer
---
Going with blowpipe over a crossbow with dragon anti fire shield is throwing away money, but do you my dude.
---
Should've used cooking gauntlets
---
To be completely honest I think the only way to really improve them would be to add links to some video guides. I realize my original comment was super blunt now but I don't think something like the Olm fight can be reasonably explained through a text guide, especially not to someone inexperienced with PvM.
---
If you hangup your shirts when they finish drying they won't wrinkle as bad.
---
Pros: black background, yellow text
---
I did that one passively. Just checked out if there were any monsters nearby anytime I traveled anywhere. Wasn't too bad
---
There are very few cases where you'd actually use the full set as their prayer stats aren't very high until you get the set bonus. Realistically it would only be used in Pyramid Plunder, and off task bursting/ barraging for training without having ancestral
---
I mean I've had quest cape for ages I just like keeping useless shit for some reason. I have an entire tab dedicated to stuff I pretty much never use lol
---
Added you
---
Maybe instead of this backwater reaction, look at it as a reason to enjoy runecrafting?
---
Oh, wait, no, that gets in the way of being chronically upset on the internet!
---
Sorry that would have been helpful
---
atk:78
---
str: 83

farming:92
---
slayer:80
---
wc:73
---
cooking:72
---

---
everything else is garbage
---
But if it purely kept players than the player count would not increase substantially. Which it has.
---
Oh ok my bad, I am the big stupid
---
I'm fine if it's still a thing so long as long as splashing isn't the only way to obtain vis (dissolving being the 'normal' method I guess).
---
Gratz for 99 hunter
---
People don't know what keyboard and mouse hooks are. I don't think they actually grasp how jagex's anticheat works in modern times. It's multilayered and attempts to capture people at all of these layers. It really isn't as simple as "the mouse co-ordinates are 473 533 and now they're 473 563 in under 1ms hmm"
---
I got my first and only 99 at wintertodt, basically just said “last game, getting 99, gl everyone” in the north east corner and someone said “be free”
---
warding not passing will grant the devs the ground to work on expanding other skills, while warding passing will provide the framework for more balanced pvp updates as well as a brand new skill for new players to try/old players a fresh goal.
---
I ready to vote no, bring on the polls.
---
I feel the same. I uses to be able to drop 18 hours straight on the weekends but now I can barely gutt an hour
---
I mean I'm from America. It sucks here. Working on getting out.
---
F
---
You seem to have the stats for Zulrah and barrows and doing farm rund and slayer tasks aren't bad money makers either.
---
Thanks for sharing I’ve been looking for something like this
---
whether you like it or not warding is going to end up being in the game. you think they'd spend almost a year working on it if they weren't going to introduce it? Its coming we cant get rid of it only thing you can do is give criticism on the skill. end of
---
DEF pure here
---
pls stop giving STR xp ElBaRg
---
I'm from America. Idk what YOU'RE on. Have you never been to a country with actual public transportation? It's actually nonexistent here.
---
I’m not sure you know how the death mechanics work
---
F for respect
---
No they're not. They changed that.
---
from what I understand it's only against the rules nowadays if you're high on the highscores or for infernal cape, otherwise they don't care
---
The concept of making your own gear is enticing, but the execution in both OSRS and RS3 prior to Invention has been laughable
---
At 60 defense you should get dragon platelets and boots, and work towards a fighter torso. A guy just above you posted about looking for people to play barbarian assault with you should hit him up because the fighter torso will be useful for a while.
---
I know I had an hour to get it but I was logged out and didn't know what world I was in
---
Where do you live, in the boonies? Most major cities have decent options dude step out of your bubble
---
Classic post 😴
---
I haven’t played a single time but am willing to learn. Is that ok?
---
im not sure if i would be able to to do zulrah tbh...I have blowpipe, ancient dhide, mage wise i have nothing but basics and access to ancients.
---
(Last game I played of LMS sums this all up, me vs a guy that was fully loaded. This was a quick art work I tried to do, which I hope you like. )
---
Did you not read the blog? They aren't going to remove ring imbues from NMZ, only add it to warding as an alternative method of imbuing.
---
I'm not going to, but how do you bot?
---
ah yes, the nerf that simultaneously doesn't matter at all but is so critical it must be forced through unpolled and desired :&gt;)
---
No. That's why polling exists.
---
I mean it's really not all that profitable anymore. Double nats used to be good money but that was a long time ago, nats are much much cheaper now then they were then. Bloods are less than 1m gp/h even with the elite kourend diary, although they are very AFK. Meanwhile you can basically AFK zulrah and still easily make 1.7-2m gp/h depending on efficiency. It would be nice to get a real skilling money maker back into the game, right now nothing comes close to the money you can make from raids and bossing.
---
Most people that that are against it haven’t read the blog
---
Bp is heavily reliant on the bgs spec, but dhcb I still find is more consistent with a good average kill speed.
---
Uh... also people who want to deal more damage.
---
But yeah, I'm assuming cosmetic stuff that fits into the game, not the clowny stuff we see in rs3 nowadays. If we're going to take Jagex's word on "no unpolled partnership items", might as well believe them on the "fits into the game's aesthetics" too.
---
:)
---
more spoilers: its not about the skill actually being good or bad.
---
Rock on with the post mate! In your opinion is rune going to be worth with shamans being there vs green d? Would like to melee but hey range has to be trained at some point heh
---
Just planning for the upcoming weeks so its appreciated. Cheers!
---
Plus you do like 7 kill trips
---
Idk about this guy but my half a day old iron man account got banned for bottling randomly when I don’t bot. I can’t for the life of me figure out why either. Same thing would happen every time I tried to have an iron man, but not to my regular account. I’ve since given up trying to make an iron man account.
---
Actually time and time again this sub is shown to be a pretty accurate predictor of the general populace. I wouldn't be surprised if the official warding poll got very similar results
---
*side glances at rs3 people who buy bexp*
---
Ignoring your restrictions
---
Body: rune - torso - Bandos
---
Magic: salad robes - mystic - ahrims/infinity - ancestral
---
Magic weapon: fire stick - Ibans - trident - fancier tridents
---
Range: leather - all dragonhides - Arma
---
Range weapon: bone bow - msbi rune arrows / rcb broads - blowpipe - twow
---
They are changing the total worlds requirements mate
---
#
---
i thought they weren't putting this in because it didn't pass the poll?
---
Putting subtle racist overtones aside- you're onto something here.  There's a vast emptiness to the east and there's a lot that could be done to introduce asian themes with a new area.
---
It was back in winter dude...
---
That's 6 months
---
You either play like an average of 5 mins a day or haven't even tried. The game should not be scaled to the amount of time you personally can put into the game. That's just silly.
---
We get 2 big content updates a year. That's not a lot at all. It takes a max of 2 weeks for the average player(not maxed mains, med levels) to have tried out most new content and understand it/have it settle into the game.
---
Like if 6 months isn't enough time to learn updates like kebos or fossil island than maybe the problem is you?
---
Probably true, yeah
---
Meta af
---
Super unpopular opinion, and I’m not at all serious about this being implemented, but it would be funny/interesting if jagex allowed you to bot 1 skill that you hated. So long as you also cannot make money or sell anything you botted for. 
---
Some skills in this game I genuinely hate, but have to do to reach certain goals. I totally get the grind and all that, but it makes me laugh thinking im playing a GAME, doing something I genuinely hate in my free time
---
Fuck off Momo
---
Disagreeing with your opinion is not being whiny
---
I can't shotgun a 4Loko, but I've chugged out of a glass. Had that bitch down in like 8 seconds or less. It made for the start of an interesting night.
---
I have lvl 5 + 375 points in attacker, collector, &amp; healer, but I have not ever touched defender. Would much rather play with chill people than piss off some groups my first few attempts trying. Would love to join in I'll try the cc later.
---
Alternatively if anyone wants to hit me up for some BA my rsn is ruderiot
---
Soo... It's like 20 mil to get 83 cons from 1 and then 20 or 25 mil to build everything.
---
Yes I’ve burnt out of my main a year back then decided to try Ironman and it gave me the refreshing feeling I wanted because accomplishments came so frequently.  However, it’s getting out of hand now how long it will take to reach the next goal.  I enjoyed Osrs for years now and had a lot of fun playing but apart of growing up is realizing your responsibilities in life and this game does a good job keeping people away from them ahaha.
---
Honestly the amount of money he'd be paying jagex would kind of justify him having that kind of power over the poll
---
Mind you the average poll gets like 30k votes, so 1k accounts ($11k) wouldn't be a huuuuge sway
---
Lmao
---
While I'm not a person who actively competes in that sort of stuff you have to understand that some people enjoy the appeal of being good in something, regardless of the fame or money. Infact I personally feel like it's more noble that way. To be the best at something knowing there's no reward other than the personal satisfaction of knowing you were one of the best at it.
---
Fucking cringe
---
Iirc the average osrs player is 1034 total. Just to give a bit of perspective into how much content the average player has completed.
---
I'm guessing you couldn't spot dead content if it suckled your dickhole.
---
Yeah my iron man accounts keep randomly getting banned for botting that I’m not doing.
---
How can bot bans be expired? I thought they were perma bans. Were bottling bans only temporary in the past? (I just started back after 2 years off, so I’m genuinely asking)
---
Nice man, we can play later, it's 4 am for me. For defender I recommend Lord shaynes defender guide, it's great.
---
It would be extremely unlikely as it's purpose among this proposed skill is nothing like invention. For this it just a fast way to gather raw ingredients, rather than afk'ing and splashing.
---
It won't have the effect invention did. And I'd rather see it as an expansion to existing production skills, so they have tangible benefits to being levelled.
---
Or he took it out of the fridge, put it in a cold oven, then the videos starts.
---
Exactly what you mentioned. Just to save a few seconds. One in the west room on the southeast corner, one in the east room on the northwest corner. The south room is the jewellery box and altar so there will be a pool right next to them, and I'll have a pool right next to all three of obelisk / fairy ring / spirit tree instead of just one of them.
---
One of my fondest memories was when farming came out and I hung out with 50 other people standing around a plot watering onions.
---
Can you ask?
---
Man early osrs high scores were so fun
---
It was competitive and everything, but effciencyscape wasn't at it's peak yeeet(still leagues better than 2006)
---
This is probably what pushed effciency scape to what it is now.(also ehp contests...)
---
Ah, that makes sense
---
You can safespot the ogre warriors from the front of the cave, the shamens are a little further back. Idk if their drop table is different because I only ranged the warriors, but if they're worth killing I think they use magic attacks so dhide would be best or just pray flick PfMagic.
---
It's a subjective opinion. "I would prefer not to add a new skill to the game because it drastically alters my gameplay" is a very valid point even if you disagree with it.
---
You can't ask someone what their favorite food is and then tell them their answer is wrong.
---
The only random I do is genie. Time it takes yo do any other isnt worth the exp to me
---
epic gamer moment
---
for Warding if properly introduce I could say yeah. I mean it's not that far of stretch imo.
---
I had really hoped you were about to open a can of beans.
---
Quest took me like 5 hours lmao
---
Why do they have such a hard on for warding? How many times did they poll sailing for comparison?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLgHOpYBnUM
---
Tfw I can’t tell my girlfriend I play rs too cause my girlfriend doesn’t exist
---
I’m saying gz, and i mean it, but deep down inside I’m enraged lol.
---
My hope is since Jagex knows they need an item sink option it could potentially be polled and expanded.
---
It would be really cool to see expansion into other skills as well, I definitely would be down for that. But we're just talking. I don't think it will pass :(

Alright man, just hit me up in game or join the cc :-)

---
It's just +5 mage at the cost of defense equal to adamant or black d'hide. It's a more than fair tradeoff mate.
---
Ancestral is also irrelevant here since it's straight up BIS and a tier above.
---
So how is this not variety, you explained it well yourself in the first parapraph...
---
And the average league players plays like, idk, 10 champions? But everyone gets hyped as fuck when a new champion releases
---
I really don't see why that matters at all
---
Low level content *exists* heck we just got a med level dungeon
---
What if most players are maxed, does that mean that all content must be catering towards maxed players?
---
I'm seeing this thrown around a lot but it seriously wouldn't be the opinion of most maxed players. It's a quick skill that's buyable, it's hardly a runecrafting or agility 2.0.
---
Even people who somewhat forced themselves to finish maxing could do this easily within a couple of weeks. It's bloody incorporated splashing as a method within the skill...
---
Are you in France by any chance?
---
I bet he didn't even make the bot himself, what a shit ironman!
---
he's saying there are a lot of vocal people in the subreddit that will bitch about anything new but hype up older stuff even if comparatively one ends up being much more fleshed out than the other
---
attack, strength, defense, hitpoints, agility, magic, ranged, slayer, construction, farming, prayer
---
This and the rune pouch buffs are so weirdly thrown in as a "look it's useful" that it kinda took me aback.
---
These can enter the game in ways relating to how they currently exist. They aren't required to be with a skill.
---
crossbow is so good, good job
---
Along with being able to craft armor sets:
---
\-Provides a new hunting method to gather silk to make new crafting robes.
---
\-More variety of crafting robes including Dagon'hai robes that people have been asking for for years.
---
\-The dissolving ability would allow players to reduce armors and weapons into metal bars/hides/silks + warding materials. This would give a use to the millions of useless armors and weapons that flood the ge as well as slayer drops that we typically leave on the ground. Dissolving removes these from the game, they go up in price as a result, smithing and slayer becomes more profitable.
---
\-3 new types of rune pouches. (Although the wilderness one will not be craftable via warding. Its basically a wilderness only rune pouch that works the same as the one we have now, just less costly) One includes a large rune pouch which allows 4 types of any rune instead of three. 
---
\-Craftable AND tradeable scrolls of redirection. No more relying on NMZ.
---
\-Magic incantations (Basically the blessings that you hold in your ammo slot that boost prayer, but instead boosts magic attack)
---
\-Air, water, and earth tomes + their respectable pages are fcraftable. 
---
\-Hate runecrafting? Fused essence pouches which will hold slightly less than the combination of all the other 4 pouches (27 essences). But you can use it alongside the other 4, remember that. So increased RC rates and money per hour for those who rely on abyssal runecrafting for money (Nats, deaths etc). Also we can repair our own pouches.
---
\-New warding/runecrafting minigame (Rewards will be polled in another poll). New warding guild.
---
\-Oh and an antipoison lamp. Charge it up with various anti poison pots. Sounds baller, looks baller.
---
I should have said this, but I don't have the money for that... So these are comparing weapons of 100-2.5mil
---
the mods rarely remove banned posts, its known that Jagex has no support and that reddit is the only way to get support.
---
 
---
It seems counterintuitive to make it against reddit rules when Jagex uses reddit as their customer support. Especially when the mods on here rarely remove anything at all.
---
Because they are kittens. You are not supposed to do it with a kitten.
---
What would it add though? Aside from new armour that could come into the game regardless, it essentially just reshuffles existing content and proposes flat buffs to stuff that's been in game for ages.
---
U can't win if you don't fight and get upgrades
---
Sigh, i started learning raids recently, mostly doing duos with a friend, 43kc yet to get an item in my name. (Got 2 total, arcane pray scroll and d claws)

While everyone else talks shit about your shotgun I got you a good tip. Tilt the bottom of the beer at an angle up and poke a hole in the can where the air bubble is that way it doesn’t spray.
---
Too true. Been playing different doom wads and mods for like 20 years and it's still fun.
---
To be fair it makes sense that English may not be his first language or perfect. He's literally from another land (continent?).
---
Doctor: so tell me what you do in a typical day
---
 "watch Netflix and play RuneScape on my phone"
---
Doctor: and?...
---
"And?"
---
If I'm not mistaken, they announced warding being worked on many months ago (around december or January I believe), on their website and social media. But honestly jagex mostly has given up on their own platform and are trying to use the modern ways of communication to stay in touch with their audience.
---
So it would be a single player version of the game?
---
Get rekt
---
Because that isnt actually true and having the posts stay up just perpetuates the meme leading real players to believe it and try to get help here rather than just using the proper systems.
---
It will just sink trash items that are held at their alch value anyway. I really don't know how people see this as a viable sink. It's not designed like invention was, there's nothing incentivising you to dissolve expensive gear or unique stuff like treasure trails.
---
Would the essence pouch repair option be changed to warding or just add another method? If it replaces the old method then how does this effect for example lava rune crafting where you have magic imbue and NPC contact runes in inventory?
---
Are you in Canada by any chance?
---
Tell me again how Jagex doesn’t streamline their own content into the game?
---
Take my spade, and we’ll make it I swear
---
Turns out there isn’t a single bot in this game. It’s alllll Lynx.

no shotgun no 99

Funny how democracy sucks when it's not on your side

That’s one way to get my daily programming assignments out of the way
---
Lets get a trend going of worse and worse shotguns every video
---
&gt; school runesca
---
I understand what your saying, but as I mentioned there are plenty of models from earlier and later that think look great. the slayer monsters don't look the way they look because they came out in 2005, they look that way because of deadlines and corporate pressures. 
---
Now if you like how they look that's not a problem, but it's hard to deny they just don't line up with the quality of most other monsters.
---
"Hey, I don't like the idea of a new skill"
---
"This is trash"
---
Those two comments aren't the same dude.
---
Sell this to jagex
---
Aren’t they called parents?
---
You can also get the fire hd 7 gor 30 dollars that might run osrs.
---
Almost like that's what makes the game what it is, players voting on what they want.
---
It would make it more obvious that half the skill could fit inside magic and/or runecrafting that's for sure.
---
Warding does not fit RuneScape at all the skill is completely useless focus on getting a max cape before asking for a new skill.
---
Make sure you add that to the reddit rules, it’s just a meme brooo doesn’t need to be taken literally
---
Basically, Warding needs to be the smithing/fletching/crafting for mage. Hindsight is 20/20, some crafting items could have been moved to fletching, like ranger armors, and Runecrafting could've been a part of Warding if this skill was released when RC was. 
---
But, it wasn't, and people won't want changes to be that drastic. It's what I'd do, and I'd probably piss off most of my players doing it. Probably why I'm not a game dev.
---
I struggled swapping from bp to dhcb at first too, going from 3mins+ to the occasional sub 1min but average 1:15-130.
---
And the dmg you take assuming you dont plank the mechanics could be anywhere between 0-1000 since his attack styles rng its just more likely praying range with a dhcb/anti and taking the mage hit is going to be less damage then tanking the range hit as they both got the samw max hit
---
Hopefully this helps, but also dhcb makes for alot smoother trips imo :)
---
Make gold bracelets then high alch or sell!
---
But this universe exists on a 5D manifold
---
Deadman rework
---
I’m going to make some commentary on the state of the game and the idea of new skills in general. This is not specific to warding or indicative of my desire for the skill or not, just some observations I’ve made while thinking about it.
---
People don’t want things with super powerful rewards because the OSRS combat system gets less fun when too much power creep is introduced due to our capped hp values. We saw this all happen in late RS2. 
---
Without good rewards, a skill without great rewards is just more hoops to jump through for little benefit. There’s arguments to be made about how “you can just not do it if you don’t like it”, but nobody enjoys training firemaking either. We still do it anyway because it’s a skill and we feel like we need to level our skills for account progression and total level. For a lot of players, a new skill will be treated as required content that they absolutely cannot ignore since it’s required for total levels and account progression. That is the problem.
---
Normally a lot of low-rewarding content still gets a lot of the “Sure, I don’t mind this content” yes votes since it won’t upset or replace existing things, only add new choices. You were not significantly penalized for not using the new content. 
---
When new content is introduced that’s basically a large ‘required’ timesink but doesn’t add powerful new benefits and rewards, you get a lot of people that don’t want it, but if it does then you’ve only managed to accelerate the decay of the game due.
---
My route was the handholds next to the dodgy ground, hard to see and easy to miss
---
He didn’t say “I don’t want a new skill.” He said “it’s trash.”
---
The reason why Jagex is proposing a new skill at all is because the community said that’s something they’re interested. So that hurdle is past us. If you voted “not interested in a new skill” then you would logically abstain from the process of creating a new skill if it does pass.
---
If you aren’t interested in the new skill, and don’t want to give constructive criticism, then don’t give any form of criticism at all. Why would you involve yourself if you don’t care?
---
Can someone please edit this and add sea shanty 2 in the background of the beginning, it starts as a whisper and gets louder horn drop on the 99 and continue playing until he starts his pussy ass shotgun add a record scratch cut the danks and play an appropriate loud screeching whaaat thee fuuuuck! 
---
Idk why my brain imagined this to begin with but now I won’t be able to sleep until I see it. I’ll buy the first person to do it a bond.
---
Pay for someone else to do it for you, or do it yourself. That's like saying it would be silly to ever get an uber or taxi if you know how to drive.
---
The only quests I can really think of that are problems are dragon slayer and the fossil island one. As there's portions of the quest revolving around finding and helping someone else to sail. But perhaps it's because it's terrain they are experienced with and you can't have been?
---
This is really fun, I wish I could use OSRS to practice making absurd scripts for things, but it’s just not worth the risk :/
---
Finish your sentence...
---
That's not very old school
---
I'd think the difference is kinda minimal. Swapping for a range pot will save you a couple k gp but you'll likely be eating a bit more. The real question is why haven't you upgraded your gear at that kc? A little investment in an anguish or something would make for faster kills and thus fewer expenses and faster profit.
---
They said there were too many people out of the office
---
Ya know it's a banger when it says hypercam2
---
Thought girth is what counts but okie
---
Really as long they steer clear of EoC-like updates, I think any other updates are fine.
---
It was a fun thing, but a shit skill. Raids made the most of it imo.
---
&gt;2150 total btw
---
Perma banned btw lol
---
You can camp blue dragons without an antifire shield, use fire strike it’s fairly effective not the best but it will get you where you need to be.
---
Harsh
---
Burn
---
You're messing up then
---
I'm 60 attack 80 strength using a Dscim and blowpipe and my trips are ~15 kills
---
If they are using range you run away and pray mage when the swap happens.  If they Melee you change prayers safely and continue.  From there, you need to look at your armor and determine if you have better mage or range defense and pray the opposite.  I use veracs skirt so I pray mage.  After mage, you again run away and pray range before reacting if he goes Melee.
---
Their money wasted, yes
---
Have a downvote for your heresy.
---
It's a piece of story that contradicts RS3, not the lore. Yeah, we may not be able to find Kethsi or do the Dragonkin quest line, but that's the thing with alternate timelines, they don't ever have to. The background and backstory of OSRS and RS3 are the same, but the events in each game seem to take place in two different timelines, like Zeah not having reconnected with the mainland in RS3, and as you mentioned Bob dying in DS2, which means Kethsi will never be rediscovered, and so on.
---
How is the graphic so beautiful? Mine look like fake minecraft

Hunting! Oh wait noooooooo

People can have opinions that dont agree with yours. You dont like that many think its trash, why dont you abstain from egging us on cupcake?
---
There is a high lvl guard in journeys that drops the rune kite. Safe spot with fire blast or something.

It's a reference to Vis Wax, a material extracted from runes used in Invention in RS3.
---
You saying you don’t like cats?
---
Doesn’t surprise me that Reddit likes warding
---
Yeh that's shit :/ at least it's better than it used to be. 180ms west coast US was rather playable for the years we were forced to. So atleast you're around half that. Feel for ya tho mate.
---
I saw a skulled little level 33 with a wizard hat, iron plate set, and dds prowling rev cave one time bro you’re gonna have to stay alert
---
Lol I’m glad someone else has a useless quest tab as well.
---
YONWO. you only need woman once.
---
currently in the same boat. only difference is that i am 70 defence.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I personally decided to get 99 slay with my current combat, then ill decide if going main is worth it or not.
---
i look at it this way, i can always make a maxed main with guthans in 2 months if i wanted in NMZ. making my current account takes longer. so i am probably going to keep 108 CB on this account forever.
---
the lack of defense and attack doesn't hold me back that much from bossing/slayer and the pking is significantly better at my combat bracket.
---
lol what the fuck
---
Don't care get rid of it
---
Blessed requires 70 defense buddy
---
If the client is open source and you don't have autoupdater on it, the client really can't do shit.
---
Why would you autoclick NMZ when its so easy to afk NMZ without botting though?
---
Soon
---
It would take way too much dev time to make a beta; they'll poll it and then if it passes they'll make a beta to make sure it's designed properly
---
wao cant believe jagex would just ban a clan leader. hes a CLAN LEADER for crying out loud
---
RS was already shit in 2010
---
They're trying to make it as good as they can so that it can pass and it can help the game thrive
---
What’s your RSN?
---
You're the whiner here
---
What about Scythe?
---
It's netfish and chill smh
---
Try imagining fixing bugs and broken shit instead then
---
Heard the droprate isnt that great.
---
I agree but I like warding in particular because it doesn't feel like random new content, it feels like something that couldve and shouldve been in the game already.
---
I like it because it doesn't feel like something new. It feels like RuneScape finishing what it started with the artisanal aspects of the combat triangle. So long as smithing, crafting, fletching and rc are in the game I feel like warding should be too
---
I always thought of Gielinor as like Europe, and we still have an unexplored vast land
---
Ye i remember starting rs3 purely because the lowest osrs world for me was like 290 us before aussie servers. Then the aussie servers DCd for like 2 years straight hahhaha. But yeah i pk 95% of my time on rs now and i hop between 350 and 450-550ms worlds non stop. Legit calling giant wars on half second delay lol but rs is better for ping than black desert or guild wars or ffsiv, those become unplayable at high latency.
---
Vis in general is a thing relating to magic before Runescape.
---
This is just embarrassing
---
There's a difference between removing a skill and adding a skill, brainlet
---
Not without trickery. I think all copys are intended to disappear.
---
All three
---
See, this seems like a real problem to me. People wont want imbues removed from NMZ because it will make it harder for them to obtain. For all the crying people do about "game health" and stuff, they really are hypocritical of what they vote on in polls. Anything which makes the game easier will often pass polls, while things which makes existing methods worse despite being needed, will get voted against. People wont want things to be removed from NMZ because its easy to get while its there. Despite Nightmare Zone being a terrible concept from when a time where the developers didnt have resources and knowledge to make something better
---
He's talking about dat THICC waist
---
I used to "rent" a bludgeon for certain tasks and sold it after, usually making 50k~ gp in just the trade itself

Sounds good to me champ.
---
cant wait for more crafting
---
fuck yeh
---
Sailing or bust
---
He himself confirmed it
---
Do some research on NMZ and problems that it creates and then come back to this topic.
---
I like everything except the mysterious man hat or whatever that guy is called. Shits generic.
---
They should just add it in without polling it just to spite the toxic brainlets
---
Runescape is no longer a flash game, no one ever uses the website. Nearly everyone uses Twitter. It only makes sense to post on twitter

I waited a lifetime for the reward, I can wait for them to rise ;)

Teak cut

This is only racist if you are looking for it to be racist.
---
Great work everyone, really impressed, I'll be voting yes to the skill.
---
Question: What's the deal with **unpicking/reforging**? Are those part of crafting and smithing, or are they related to warding?
---
I dont know what this is, but i like it.
---
Just wait until I hit 99 woodcutting and shotgun a beer with an axe instead of a knife
---
Autoalchemical asphyxiation
---
i agree with what ur saying, shouldn't be a banable  offence for that macro
---
But u still need a job tho
---
I call these guys I-AWAGs( i always wanted a godsword) cus they say that if you ask why theyre using it.
---
Is there a mass collection/album of these brainlet posts? Their why Im subbed here
---
Max combat. Pures/limited accounts are pointless.
---
Construction is the only one really, since it gives you a lot of unlockable stuff to use for the sake of convenience.
---
And it's a buyable with an extremely tedious training method, lol.
---
Some idiot rank 10 ironman got banned for botting but he's attempting to deny it
---
Lol it's school, not a war. You act like you walked across no man's land.
---
I mean a posted about this today. I got Perma bam for botting on an account I haven’t used in months. Just wanted to log in today and start playing again. Seems like a pretty prevalent issue
---
Wait are you the guy?
---
Fun fact if you drop a lit cigarette into gasoline itll go out.
---
I never said I need the increased space, I’m barely over 400 on my main. I just don’t prefer to have all that stuff in my bank when it’s not used much like stash items. Hence why I mentioned having a place to store them, also there are single off items for clues that I couldn’t remember off hand.
---
thanks for the input "ur a nogger"
---
Same. I hit 2k kc this week and haven’t gotten any uniques yet. Looking at the collection log makes me sad.
---
He's the main distraction we need at Area-51 so we can Naruto run past his burning wreckage.
---
Legit don’t know how people have the mental capacity to play ultimate Ironman accounts makes sense they would bot. 
---
As to why they would bother idk.
---
Because he’s a “top player” and doesn’t like it and his opinion is more important than yours.
---
le gem gem gem gem gem
---
thank you i never really realized how little of a difference it made
---
I'm going to try some lms again tomorrow and hope for the best
---
It actually hides everything but pets lmfao
---
Runelite is good and free
---
They do have all 3 of the examples you gave (Quests, Minigame, and map area (guild)) in the long form warding update
---
It’s nice to see that young children are still picking up the game! :)
---
Are they working on the engine? I have seen 0 blogs or correspondence about that.
---
Go apply at your local grocery store, hobby lobby, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Chik fil A, BBQ joints, receptionist/office manager.
---
Insist on talking to manager and filling out application same day. Worked every time for me when I was younger and needed a job. Of course dress nice..
---
They all start off at a much higher than $8.10.
---
Don’t get complacent at a dollar general.
---
There’s countless other jobs that starting pay is more and no trade or education required.
---
Excuse me but *what is your problem*
---
Lol still gone tho.
---
Dont need another buyable skill. They should work on a skill that is more unique than a smithibg or crafting remix
---
70 atk, 60 str. You will never hit Robert the strong with 60 atk in dragon slayer 2.
---
Have you seen the art for ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAME TO OSRS?
---
Biggest example are the Raid teasers and slayer boss wallpapers...
---
petition to make the only skill slayer so fucking noobs can't use garbage skills to inflate their lvls!
---
*[Flute salad plays]*
---
They say not appealable, but personally in my experience they had a look anyway.
---
Can't lose much for trying.
---
I play Ironman, I don’t have a problem with bankspace, I’m voting yes to warding. 
---
You saying the game shouldn’t have Ironmen in mind is obnoxious. You can make a valid point without saying that an entire subsection of the community is basically invalid.
---
Idk I find prayer is very important in the inferno. A lot more than food is in any case. It might help the justiciar bots brute force their first cape though
---
barrows is fun with the blowpipe! it tears through Ahrim!
---
There's an entire town of people called Ali
---
Whats her rating?
---
Fortunately I've never had any valuable accounts hacked because I'm usually watching them like a hawk, so take my experience with a grain of salt lol
---
I didn't downvote you and your opinion is valid. Just saying I don't like pre-GE trade.
---
Not at all what I intended or meant, what I said was the devs themselves when pitching ironman, stated that they would never have content tailored to them nor influence the games development, now more bankspace making the game mode more viable? Absolutely! But voting no to something because of the limitations of your gamemode is not fair to others
---
Well no wonder. If you want to make friends with the hivemind you have to train the definitive best skill in the entire game. 
---
Agility.
---
This is such a good meme
---
thanks for that amazing heads up, planning to have 65 def and 85ish range and mage, would that info change your answer?
---
What was the point of the oven mitts lol
---
Kinda weird and I doubt anyone would do it... but I also kinda like it for some reason
---
this is also true, but i don’t see how one example of racism excuses another
---
Maybe go for purple slayer helm or something? Blue doesn't really work here
---
I miss dungeoneering :(
---
I just said yhe hard work merits checking it out. I never said to vote yes for it
---
You know there is an entire new area comming out in a week and a half?
---
The thing about stuff like this, is that although it’s true that you’ll make some money back, it’ll take a large chunk of time to do so, which you could be using to do a far better money maker. Sorry for the rough explanation
---
question is if it's non-degradable or not. 
---
At least mages have better equipment to hit those peskie bulwark hide users right??
---
A few hours, like 3 or 4 probably
---
I'm not trying to excuse it. But old Jagex really didn't seem to give a fuck
---
Fair enough.  All I know is it literally told me they wouldn't review it ( like they tell everyone), but I appealed anyway and it got reversed.
---
I even got like a personal email from a J-mod, saying they went over it and it was now unbanned etc.
---
No, most effective way to kill him is with a crush weapon. I'm not the most avid bossing player nor am I a subject matter expert. However.. I killed him with 70 atk and 60 str, I was still struggling to hit him effectively. I also have 92 range, tried that as well. Range armor was way too squishy.
---
Yes, and cannibals exist; doesn't make them the majority.
---
Curious, was it the same accounts? Is there a link to this first banning/appealing online?
---
That's the only thing I can think of, but I don't think it does work for achievement diary gear
---
I don't really think it would be a problem. Very few people would bring the divine out, unless they were in max teams or in anti pj world's. But even then, an arcane for maxed teams would be better for DPS. Hell some teams rock tome fire surges lol for that higher DPS chance. 
---
So in reality, it would be PvM'ers that take the divine out and who'd benefit most from using it. Pkers would still hit through the divine as opposed to hitting 0s on a bulwark none stop. Freezes would be more common as well.
---
&gt;1500 total
---
Yeah I had a ton of free bank space back then too. You'll run out. Ask any endgame iron.
---
They really need to make the second question a tiered question then. Or rather that we can prioritize our answers. Like:
---
1. Sailing
---
1. Artisan
---
1. Invention
---
1. Warding
---
So it doesn't end up with 
---
19% want sailing
---
21% want artisan
---
24% want invention
---
26% want warding
---
And let's say everyone that wanted sailing the most want artisan if sailing doesn't get most votes, those that want invention wants invention or nothing. And those that want warding wants 50/50 split between sailing and artisan. etc etc 
---
So you have to tally the votes somehow to make sure that it's not just which one gets the most votes in the first round and everything else gets thrown out immediately. 
---
Because if 40% want artisan or sailing, and only 26% want warding then is warding really the most popular choice?
---
If you want some mid-tier content you'll be able to do sooner, do some barrows too!
---
But yeah, Monkey Madness 2 and Dragon Slayer 2 are both good longer term goals
---
I didn't even realise this was a RuneLite feature, we really are spoiled.
---
I hate to be that guy but just buy gold then? price of bond is 4.2m and lets say on average 1m on ur average website costs what 70 cents? 2.80 gets u a bond 5.60 is a month. think smart not hard? I mean i hate to promote that stuff but a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do. if 11 dollars really hurts your ability to play the game thats a good way to half it.
---
All the newbies are downvoting :)
---
Rngesus*
---
It’s mining. But for invention.
---
about 1/20th what you get on ge but ill keep it in mind for the btws
---
Best way to get laws for a early game HCIM?
---
I would bet everyone in atleast t he top 25 use bots
---
Slayer with blowpipe is great exp!
---
The screen went black, I'll use this when I get 10k planks in, it'll probably help with my mental state at that time, thanks
---
You suck alch yourself.
---
But guys this time it was his first offence. This is so unfair that he gets banned for a few first offences, guys. Like, come on, why is he banned for bottig??
---
Thank you for your advice man
---
hes so shit n slow on vids lmfao definite ahk.
---
Can I ask what you don't like about it? I personally think warding could blow new life into a lot of different parts of the game.
---
I think that with a few more changes I might vote yes though, I'd really like a new skill, It's exciting
---
Same reaction when I finished DS2 after the last boss
---
Yeah I'll have to just time it right by the sounds, cheers bro
---
This comment right here officer
---
I really like that bit about us getting to the ice trolls first thus we have a troll kingdom.
---
The theater of blood is also a decent split from rs3 no?
---
I'd really love to know the little lore differences like this, but they're pretty hard to find.
---
Yee
---
Huh? How is your ping any different than back home in Austria?
---
Im surprised you're aware of the climbing boots fiasco because you're literally suggesting the same thing but on a larger scale with more common items
---
Harder bosses?  Harder as in more difficult?  Because we can see how they are now pushing the absolute limits of the combat skill system.  Or harder as in pump the numbers up so you need even stronger gear stacking to deal with the numbers?  No thanks.
---
But a roll back implies your account is put in its past state, ergo no fire cape.
---
There is a very large number of players who reeeeee at anything new added to the game. To these people there is nothing jamflex can do to appease them
---
The problem is that the items created with warding are mostly useless. Out of all the magic gear coming out only 1 set is better than ahrims. Its barely stronger (+37 vs +35) yet it has 0 defensive bonuses while ahrims is much more tanky. The only thing thats actually useful is the ammo slot magic boosting item. Other than that, all of the gear is worthless.
---
So we are going to spend 4 hours maxing this skill and it becomes dead content. There were so many better skills proposed that went ignored.
---
That's true but I known people who have botted to 200m xp without a ban, depending on the skill it's very easy. Also legit botting is a thing and it's very hard to detect
---
Maybe it won't, maybe it will. If you like the proposal don't forget to vote yes!
---
Can I ask what you don't like about the skill? I personally think the skill looks great; the lore seems a little forced right now but they will have plenty of time to sort that out in future quests, and the content they're proposing looks great. I'm really looking forward to a new skill as well.
---
Most of the things coming out of warding are pretty lackluster. I mean yeah there's a very small niche use for some of them but really most of them are obsolete by the look of them.
---
Also, can you stop with the "wilderness only!"? It's not going to revive the wilderness and it will just add up to be a confusing mess over time.
---
It's not about not wanting content, it's about the content itself being a clone of a skill that already exists with a twist of magic components. 
---
It also sucks it's a buyable skill. I just kinda wished it were something different.
---
It sounds like you're trying to disregard the fact that people speak certain ways depending on where they come from. Yes. People can speak differently.
---
Having a character who has a texan accent is not racist. Neither is a character that has broken english and looks asian.
---
Are you implying that black panther was obscenely racist for having Wakandans have an african accent?
---
I think thieving is the fastest 99 you can get out the gate 
---
It was the first 99 in osrs.
---
I'm not defending his choice to bot, I just said that if you bot to compete in high scores it's an instant perma ban
---
I even posted it as humor
---
A man of culture I see
---
Hire this man
---
Wrath runes get up to like 1.2m/hr
---
Which is pretty good for a skill
---
Is there any point to casting the explorer ring's low level alchemy?
---
What’s wrong with new content though? What exactly would you want from a new skill
---
Can I ask what you don't like about the skill? I personally think warding looks great; the lore seems a little forced right now but they will have plenty of time to sort that out in future quests, and the content they're proposing makes magic combat much more appealing to me. I'm really looking forward to having a new skill to train as well.
---
If you honestly don't like the proposal and don't think it will be good for the game, then a no vote is fair though.
---
Should I add a /s?
---
Zmi is pretty ez with the follow train
---
Makes it semi afk and mobile friendly
---
But the best he can do is $10 because no market
---
&gt;only long time higher level accounts get the first offence warning
---
i think you misunderstood bud
---
not everyone. I have a friend who got perma first offence
---
Thing is I just reached 1956 total, this skill will get me to 2k total in less than a day.
---
I wanted to get to 2k with only 23 skills :( wouldve been more impressive for me.
---
Other than that i dont really mind this skill
---
Ah my bad there, shoulda seen the satire but I'm just confused because I'm being downvoted so I tripped out and thought you meant what you said :p
---
i went on in more detail in another comment in this chain, dunno if you read that already
---
i see where you’re coming from, and i think that in an ideal post-race world, people would be able to make light of each other’s cultures in a way that’s genuinely harmless. in my experience, though, race and any stereotypes that come with it have been and will continue to be touchy subjects given human history’s not-too-long-ago troubles/conflicts based around race. 
---
i also feel that it’s really not anyone’s place but the people affected to say whether something is offensive or not. this applies within some realm of reasonableness, of course (as in, i hope i’m still sounding reasonable/credible and not like a total sjw here), but i feel that if something makes people feel bad, there should be an attempt to understand why and remedy the situation, rather than telling them to shrug it off or grow a thicker skin (again, with some room for telling people to fuck off and suck it up if the situation actually calls for it)
---
sorry this ended up coming off as kind of a ramble- keep in mind i’m not completely solid on these ideas, they’re more just notions in my head and hence putting them into words wasn’t the smoothest transition.
---
Playing devil's advocate here but you gotta remember that only a little bit east of the river Lum is a horde of goblins who are constantly respawning and attempting to invade Lumbridge only to be stopped by guards who risk their lives working day and night fending off those gobbos from invading the town. I'd say that Bob has a perfectly sane reason to be scared of Zanik, especially since he doesn't know she's not aggressive.
---
That being said he could just straight up be an asshole, and I feel that in the next quest Jamglocks should poll a new quest in the Dorgeshuun quest line that gives some of the citizens some well deserved sensitivity training.
---
"slayer 2" is more of a meme name for a skill that achieves the same level of unified enjoyment that slayer brings.
---
Warding can be disliked for legitimate reasons, many of which I've outlined.
---
People don't legit want Slayer.. again. They want a skill that's as enjoyable and expansive as slayer, rather than just another buyable that has a fair bit of identity crisis
---
top notch content
---
I took 2 years off and held top 120 lol. Hell there is this guy on front page, Harmony, who got perm banned twice and reached front page with an account created in 2016.
---
You can atleast try...
---
Voting no because no
---
I don’t want to be forced to run to the guild every time I want to skill. Or be forced to train in one spot.
---
Bot scrips = afkable...? I didn't know questing was AFK...
---
OSRS is a very low APM game, I play almost exclusively on 2 accounts and often have another companion game, Elite, Warband, Warframe what have you. It doesn't take any large amount of effort to multitask when the required APM is like sub - 20 in most of OSRS. Talking to your friends shouldn't lower your ability to play rs and has no impact on "How afk" something is. Neither does watching a video.
---
I can queue up an essence rock when blood rcing, and walk into the kitchen, debate what I want to eat, lay out some tinfoil. Forget the temp I was supposed to bake my food at, check the package and then get things going. Then, grab a drink as a snack and return to the computer with a mostly done inv of essence blocks. That's AFK. You can leave yourself doing slayer with prayer or guthans for up to 20 mins at a time, that's AFK.
---
Honestly I can understand that
---
I've been wondering the same thing. They don't really stack like dust devils. Would blow pipe be quicker?
---
le epic hidden gem
---
How dare you!
---
yeah lol. A lot of botters say by hand when referring to playing normally.
---
Is it really a stereotype if it can be applied to all humans in all cultures regardless of race though? It sounds like you have a personal bias because the character portrayed in this specific case happens to be Asian. I speak broken dialects of other languages, I'm sure I sound basically the same (but worse) because I struggle to find the proper connecting words and conjugations.
---
Speak for yourself, as I am proud of what I've achieved.  My project is a distributed, fault-tolerant, scalable system that is reliably bringing in billions of GP.  It has taken months of development effort to get to where it is today.  It allowed me to practice and improve my technical abilities, and to explore new technologies that I wouldn't have discovered if I had been sticking to my day job. I've been a professional software engineer for 10 years. There are probably more professional software engineers working on runescape bots than there are working for Jagex
---
Ah yes thanks, that makes sense! GL out there :)
---
u/title2imagebot
---
Would help if you specified what you don't like about the skill.
---
Gonna be great when the PvP community retaliates by voting no to this shit excuse of another crafting skill.
---
Why is the crafting item vis? It's literally an rs3 item. Do you think that will set well with players trying to get as far from away rs3 as possible? The way it's designed now feels like an rs3 skill. Also, the first dev blog left a bad impression and majority will go off on first impressions. 
---
I don't think the idea is bad, but they designed it like an rs3 skill. And they aren't actually taking player feedback to the core design, like making it feel less like an rs3 skill with it's rs3 item names, or polling the name of the skill. People will vote no based on the name alone.
---
90-110 is probably what I would call mid level. 50cb is easily achievable in 1 day so below 90 fairly early game.
---
My guy you are not a player if you do not do it manually.
---
&gt; We intend to poll Warding this month.
---
From the blog.
---
I'll be voting no because while I really like what they're doing; it's better off as qol for other skills. We don't need a new skill for the sake of a new skill
---
Check zulrah/vork/guardians item collection. You may have died with it and it's still there
---
I believe you have 3 spots in your inventory open (one for the cape and two spots with planks that end up not getting used, as you need 3 planks per time). Just fill up those spots with any equipable item. If you then fuck up, equip any item,  then you have a spot for the cape. Unequip after 1 cape build
---
cool bud, also fuck off stop ruining my favorite childhood game
---
Raids chest is where I accidentally leave all my items
---
interesting concept but how do you prove this without streaming it or viding it?
---
 Im a CB 91 who has barely touched Barbarian Assault since I came back to osrs, I'll be sure to jump into your clan :)
---
Sadly 🦀JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST BIG FINANCIAL INSITUTIONS🦀
---
The name sucks. That wasn't polled but jagex is polling green pixels. Yes this is a valid reason even though you disagree with me.
---
lmao have you seen twitter? every comment is negative on twitter, here the few negative comments get downvoted. So people give up saying them and just post a few memes.
---
This sub is not the only rs community
---
well played sir rofl
---
Oh my gosh! She messaged me and was very upset about this! This is amazing! I sent it to her. Lmao
---
That reply is gold.
---
We don’t deserve your words of wisdom
---
you're delusional if you think a significant portion of the player base would quit over a new skill
---
So you've locked your cat in your room? What a monster🤣
---
Who's your gfs guy?
---
As a relatively new player (and Ironman btw) i'm gonna vote yes, because i was getting worried that i'll finish all 99 before 2030 and suddenly have free time again.
---
Download a botting client such as tribot, dreambot run it, get a script using their site and run the script
---
So you want magic to be the new range? Making stuff more OP doesnt solve anything.
---
Back then I used to piss off the raggers in 2k worlds haha
---
Nobody but apparently I hurt a lot of people with my mean ol' Reddit comment :(
---
Update:
---
When trying to tell grab an explorers ring it says "You can't cast this spell on that object."
---
If you drop it and try to pick up after diary completion it says "That is not the correct tier of reward for you."
---
So this method doesn't work at all lol.
---
Absolute mad lad.
---
+respect
---
Yes preasu. This wourd bringu greatu honor to our grorious gamu.
---
It's a manufacturing skill like smithing or crafting, what the hell did you expect. You sound like someone who would support Slayer 2 to be honest
---
My bad haha my comment was like two minutes before you posted this comment. I do see what you're saying and I think maybe the OSRS teams wants to make Skilling more viable. I cant say this is their intention but maybe they want to start removing some resource drops from PvM?
---
Funnily enough, I’ll vote with them. I don’t think warding adds anything of value to the game. I also dislike that there was a forced nerf of the bulwark shield.  Now, where do I pick up my torch and pitchfork?
---
Could be.
---
Or could just be an account farm - people train up accounts then sell on black market sites, and in order for this to even slightly be worth their time they'd have to level multiple at once. I suppose some of the more reputable sellers would do so manually to avoid getting banned for macroing after the sale of the account. The less reputable ones or ones that sit on accounts for months before selling would probably be botting it tho.
---
Or it could just be some guy training up a bunch of alts for god knows what reason... Maybe that 5 accounts at corp guy training up new accounts for the ones that were banned and making extras for the next time Jagex decides he looks too bot-like.
---
I think he's pretty good. And I like him as a content creator. 
---
 Is that the full conversation? Or had you already confronted him once
---
You contradicted yourself in your first sentence cuz that's not the community, which is why I pushed back on the whole "them thing". If you don't know much about the warding skill, why are you criticising people for not looking into it, when you haven't done so yourself?
---
The proposed design is nowhere near as in-depth as invention is by the way, only select items. Invention also isn't a money sink skill, but an item sink skill.
---
The runepouch change could be good, but it has to be done differently. I'm assuming the wilderness pouch would replace the current one we have in our banks.
---
That means we are having a useful item taken away from us and locked behind an 83 Warding requirement. It means that in the meantime, people would have to sacrifice inventory spaces for things like the Inferno and ToB by carrying around their individual runes.
---
Nobody will vote the new pouches into the game if it means having to deal with a massive inconvenience for an unknown amount of time.
---
I saw this, screenshotted it and took it to my guy, he ran every test imaginable and it turns out that you're correct, this is actually one way to get an amulet of power before 70 crafting.
---
Imageboards (I.E 4chan for you normies) are unironically the best alternative since if you reply to something you give it more attention by default and arguments need to have actual merit to get anywhere. All other social media platforms were designed with keeping the attention of sub-70 IQ ADD ridden mobile users as long as possible. Twitter included.
---
I agree! How do we keep our users happy? Get rid of those that cheat! Case well handled on Jagex part.
---
Glad you have a guy for that
---
In a society he was oppressed in.
---
Botters rise up.
---
They'll have a beta if this passes; presumably there will be time to get the gp/xp rates right.
---
The guy who literally created runescape has said as much, and that he wishes he had put it in the game originally.
---
Next.
---
They should of scrapped the idea on it's 2nd poll tbh, just give us a skill like dungeoneering or something..
---
Yeah, i figured something like that. But the names were pretty unique and not like each other at all, so i think that your first suggestion is correct.
---
I thought i was tripping at first xD
---
Amazing
---
They told him to not drink the brain water, no matter what because his brain needs it.
---
But he is thirsty and the nearest water bottle is just out of reach.
---
This guy was a fucking scumbag that used to stream snipe other Ironmen for absolutely no reason other than be a nuisance. Couldn’t have happened to a better person.
---
Good riddance.
---
RS3 did it successfully
---
Might be 1013 on his acc
---
That's what polling is for. Most people aren't going to change their mind based on discussion. There will be a small group of people in the middle who may but ultimately it comes down to whether the playerbase prefers new content or less change. They are two fundamentally different viewpoints, so it's impossible to convince either side with the arguments of the other.
---
If you want a new skill your arguments are that it's a good addition and new content expands the game giving more to do. The nostalgia argument won't sway you because you clearly don't care about it.
---
If you don't want the new content then the skill could be way better than anything else in the game but you still wouldn't want it because that's not why you play. You play for the nostalgia primarily so any new content is going to detract from that.
---
These two camps are incompatible so all we can do is poll it and go with the majority (the 75% pass rate certainly favours the nostalgia side).
---
Yeah if it passes that will be the final straw. I’ve never even played WoW but all my close friends have/do so I’ll just play that instead
---
I don’t want sailing or warding lmao
---
Actually been needing this in my life I’m an avid console player and I play one game and need that game to go to when I finish a match etc
---
by lying for memes
---
Congrats mate, now your virginity is protected for all eternity! 😁
---
I like how his defense was basically "Why would anyone bot granites for 70k xp/h???"
---
Mining granite for 200m mining xp has to be one of the most tedious and mind numbing tasks you could give yourself in-game. Those rocks have probably seen more botting from Ironmen than anything else in-game.
---
Dude probably burnt himself out of the game one week, and decided then that the risk was worth taking, and now regrets his decision because the consequences from back then became a reality. Can't blame him for taking the risk, you have to be a true no-lifer to set these kinds of goals for yourself. I would imagine every Ironman of his level has had the craving to do the same. All it takes is that one bad week.
---
Did you talk to the guy on the second floor?
---
What makes a good store-of-value in your opinion? I would like to hear what you think.
---
Theres already a soldier where you can check for people
---
I will vote yes on one account, and no on the other so I can simultaneously piss off elitist neckbeards and people who really want the skill, at the same time
---
I just logged into my account for the first time in probably a week. It said my last login was 9 hours ago. I was standing in the building East of Castle Wars and the minigame tab was defaulted in the hotbar. Nothing out of my inventory or bank account was missing so my question is, is there any reason someone would hijack an account to play Castele Wars?
---
But where can I see my vision score?
---
OP is an idiot lol. 
---
Wow one of the best pkers one ticked a 4 way? Must be cheating.
---
The amount of salty pkers in the pvp community is insane. He gets mad hate all day long saying he's cheating or a garbage pker. When he is literally in rags doing no melee, no upgrade challenges on your ass. 
---
Yikes
---
How ass of a pker can you be to think that 1 ticking a 4 way switch is proof of ahk? And you're looking like a desperate fan seeking attention no wonder he blocked you. This whole post is really just proof that you're an idiot.
---
Found OP's clan mate
---
[Just read the herb run section of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/98v1h4/how_to_do_farm_runs_a_comprehensive_beginners/). 
---
Also do quests that give farming xp to get through the early levels
---
You people need to accept that some people don't like warding. It's not some other problem. People think the skill is shit. Get over it.
---
How come? Curious to know why. I’m out of the loop.
---
Yeah pretty much what I've been doing, thanks man
---
Based
---
Good luck detecting a nonpublic vpn lol
---
Ive got you on
---
I've been doing those things, I just get distracted me am not very good at the whole clicking thing sometimes, by the sounds I just gotta call the servent (am using the cook) when I have the right amount of planks and not just willy nilly like I have been, thank you for your advice my dude
---
&gt;why do we even need a new skill at this point?
---
To make rank 1 available for grabs?
---
The more they talk about warding, the more I wish they talked about sailing
---
&gt; The only dynamic IP addressing done, is local, most routers have this feature, and this is just a DCHP lease of 86,400 seconds, [by default in most cases] this has nothing to do with the external WAN IP address.
---
Some people still get dynamic IPs from their ISP, i.e. they can renew their lease and get a new WAN IP. Depends on where you live, in Sweden you used to have to pay extra for a static IP, now I think most IPs are static.
---
I think it's important to acknowledge there are some areas they can improve in, and that there's always a certain % of population that's dissatisfied with the given content and that the aim is to lower that % as much as possible. I personally dislike how Dagannoth rings are all tied up to lower level warding, for example. They're boss rings. They're old, easy-to-obtain boss rings, but they're still boss rings, and I think it'd be more appropriate to have all of them at ~60-70+. But that isn't *enough* to make me vote no. Some people have multiple of these smaller complaints, and until they see them addressed, they don't feel good voting yes.
---
I guess you're new to reddit?
---
I've talked to everyone on the first, second and third floor minus the children. I have the quest listed as infromed upon via the information center and the corrisponding Kudos to go with them.
---
Because then they'd have to pay them and do alot of work on their side whereas now they're paying 0 for RL.
---
Alch 
---
Self
---
who cares
---
Found Ditters dick rider haha
---
The most efficient way to play the game is to buy all of your skills and then spend hours at Vorkath or Zulrah to make up for it, but that’s not necessarily the most enjoyable way to play it for everyone.
---
I'm all for warding, but I want to point out that just because many of the current skills in game wouldn't pass a poll, it doesn't mean we should lower our standards about what skills we accept in game. I'm voting for warding specifically because it seems like it's been very thought-out and looks like it will be much more rewarding to train than, say, smithing.
---
No, please. Let’s keep it simple.
---
They're the most vocal though. Twitter is a ruckus rn can't expect reddit to be any better.
---
More like I-SWAG
---
if this is the cost for having used their altar to get 99 prayer then i'm willing to pay it.
---
I did actually enjoy dungeoneering back when it was introduced. Genuinely wouldn't mind it in osrs
---
I would have voted no to agility every time. You're telling me I have to click on rooftops for dozens of hours just to get to a moderately functional level? Yeah, every single person would have seen that and voted no immediately
---
It just seemed like a good opportunity to see how the subreddit reader's votes stack up against the real poll results. It's not really useful for detecting poll manipulation because anyone reading this can vote in this poll even if they're not eligible in the game, and on the other hand the real poll will have people voting on multiple accounts.
---
I really dont like that part of the playerbase seems to have the philosophy that stuff from before 2007 is always good, and anything they try to make now is Satans anus which they are trying to push us all through.
---
The no voters seems to think that Jagex is trying to convince them into "ruining" oldschool. When its very clear that these developers have so much passion for this skill.
---
Yeah, that worries me too, but I hope it's just a vocal minority. So far the respones on reddit seems mostly positive. Also reddit/twitter isn't the entire playerbase, so I'm cautiously optimistic that it might pass
---
Imagine playing the victim after basically trying to pull rank “google me bro” “rank 11k”
---
Gtfo
---
Or maybe to see what demographic is represented more on reddit.
---
Imagine the two results being wildly different: "guess not as many players are reddit hussars as we're led to believe".
---
i'm equally upset but the first and last comment as i am confused by the TY that's being sandwiched by it.
---
I'm a person from Serbia who speaks accentless English, but there's many people in my country who don't. Most people assume I don't either and are surprised when it turns out that I can. People assume this all the time.
---
Why do you think struggling with English is a racist portrayal of specifically Asian people? Why do you think it is okay when a game or movie portrays someone from my country as a petty criminal (or worse) who speaks like a 70s Russian mafioso, whereas an overwhelmingly positive character of Asian descent in that same movie or game is considered racist only because they speak heavily accented English? Why is it a problem only when it applies to you, when the reality is that most people in this world don't speak English like native English speakers do?
---
No.
---
Oh I know what I could get rid of I just don't want to for some bizarre reason
---
The docs on warding have the reasons why the skill is being developed, that's the why, but now let me ask you, why shouldn't we get a new skill? Is it that bad? The core game will still be the same, and warding doesn't even add much to that "core"
---
Think about it, if I asked you to describe the game in 2 minutes before and after (hypothetically) the skill was added, would it affect what you'd say? I really doubt it, it is something minor meant only to fix an issue, while adding 99 more levels to the total level and 200m xp to the total xp, and because of that I can't get behind the point of making it less faithful to the "good old days"
---
I don’t see the point of any of the warding mage gears. we have mystic infinity ahrim and ancestral. Thats enough.
---
That all sounds a little confusing for now :P Ill stick to 60 1 80 as a goal then start looking into briding etc, its a little too hectic for me
---
Thanks again for the help!
---
"lower our standards" what does that mean?
---
Should we vote to remove Firemaking because its a shitty skill which is not up to our standards? no.
---
I dont quite see why Players think theyre better at designing things than the people who actually design things.
---
Hey look I found the rs3 hater :)
---
Wasn't hard, I didn't even have to reel him in
---
D:
---
He 100% brute forced the entire olm fight my dude, otherwise it doesn't take anywhere near 4 hours. He mentioned he can't even kill jad somewhere.
---
I dont think its sad necessarily. There will never be a fanbase who thinks like a hivemind. Majority polled, majority gets to decide. Such is the way of things.
---
There is some merit in botting a regular account at least. You could think of PK prepping or making monetary gains by RWT. 
---
Botting an ironman would be solely for the reason of raising your e-peen in standing compared to others, which considering how long the mode has been out for and the amount of high leveled ironmen these days, nobody gives a fuck about anymore.
---
"Needing much effort or skill to accomplish, deal with, or understand." is the definition of difficult. OSRS accomplishments take *time*. PvP is the single difficult aspect of this game.
---
Especially these days
---
Don’t have anything against RS3, only your victim complex
---
Completely true but you forgot that the 10 hours you play as a kid having the time of your life equates to 0xp.
---
I've played the game since 2007 and I remember playing the hell out of clan wars, castle wars stealing creation when that was released. 
---
And yet I quit that account when EOC was released.
---
Playing osrs now I have destroyed that accounts stats and total level within a month or so and yet had less fun doing it.
---
Fair enough lol, didn't even know about this method. 2 clicks on the minimap every 10 mins with the dbone neck - what's happening to this game lmao.
---
Don't let them scare you into voting yes on something that isn't fitting for OSRS.
---
I'm not telling you how you feel about warding, I'm just saying to be careful.
---
Yeah I suppose that would make sense. I think if it's a "main" someone actually plays "not part of a bot farm" they usually temp ban first
---
All combat skills at 80 is 102 cb which I'd say is reasonably mot level
---
"victim complex"
---
need to find a group that's willing to take some gold and my rewards to carry me through for the diary achievement.
---
Voted!
---
What if we just vote warding into the game and then proceed to vote no for all content they want to add to the skill.
---
are you guys going to show the results?
---
Ward man gets paid.
---
Same could be said about this subreddit lol
---
:(
---
Do you happen tonknow if he did knights?  I just assumed he did
---
It does make sense to make this comparison, reddit often considers itself to be the voice of all players.
---
&gt;Bot scrips = afkable...? I didn't know questing was AFK...
---
He wasn't saying that he used the scripts.
---
&gt;I can queue up an essence rock when blood rcing, and walk into the kitchen, debate what I want to eat, lay out some tinfoil. Forget the temp I was supposed to bake my food at, check the package and then get things going. Then, grab a drink as a snack and return to the computer with a mostly done inv of essence blocks. That's AFK. You can leave yourself doing slayer with prayer or guthans for up to 20 mins at a time, that's AFK.
---
Yes, indeed RC is very afk after Zeah. The issue is getting there in the first place.
---
The issue is that the skill simply isn't fun. There needs to be some kind of way the skill can be fun to train as opposed to lavas or somethinng. Im not talking about regular accounts but ironmen too. The game shouldn't require you to bank 100,000's and teleport to be able to train the skill anywhere near decently (though those methods being part of the top top RC methods is of course still fine).
---
I’m rank 6969 did you look me up or what?
---
Oh I missed that part originally. Yeah that's completely wrong
---
I would say getting a 99 requires effort
---
&gt; I just feel that any substance that is meant to artificially increase your performance should be banned and that you should be banned if you are caught using them.
---
That's fair, but if it ruins the sport because you can't figure out who is using and who isn't, it would be terrible. It's only a good idea if it actually works. And currently, it wouldn't work very well because of the limited resources available in the sport for testing. If it had an organisation and funding the size of the Olympics to do the testing, then fine. But it doesn't, so the testing would be very subpar making cheating very easy. So it's better to limit the testing to the most dangerous substances and ignore the rest so your tests can become more focused and thus more precise.
---
&gt; Using this same logic, botting should be allowed in OSRS as long as your using "safe" or "limited" bots. 
---
No, for a few reasons.
---
1. OSRS is a video game and not a competitive sport. We don't need a fair and level playing field. Cheaters have very limited impact on the rest of the players, which is in stark contrast to a competitive sport.
---
2. In OSRS, you can simply focus more resources than standard (i.e. the average account) into the top players who are actually competing for ranks on the hiscores. You can't do that for a competitive sport because all competitors compete for the top spots.
---
3. It's much easier to figure out what is cheating and what is not in OSRS. If you're clicking yourself, it's not cheating. If you're letting a program click, it's cheating. Done. For sports, it's a lot more complicated because there are thousands of drugs that should be banned and thousands that shouldn't, and the banned substances would still have a tolerance level. For instance, you could ban high concentrations of caffeine, but still allow a small concentration so competitors won't get banned for eating a chocolate bar. In other words, chemistry is complicated.
---
Yep, when the real poll's results are revealed.
---
Just asking for the sake of discussion but why do you think people like skilling in the first place?
---
Or get out of retail and find a different job that leads to a career.
---
If you are, be proud, it's good to pride yourself in what you have achieved :)
---
Not being ironic btw
---
My grandma can do better
---
Just as a protip, NMZ isn't the best combat xp in the game. I believe the best currently is using Viggora's chainmace at the chaos druids
---
They are if you alt for your gp, and I think if you do max eff tob on your main astral runners can still ne efficient but U'm not 100% sure on that one
---
Bruh the whole game is clicking for hundreds of hours, it's about the rewards and usefulness of the skill.  If it were to be presented now we might not have rooftops or w.e. but it's a perfectly logical skill to have in the game vs say fire making where it apparently takes skill to use a tinderbox on a higher level log.
---
bruh 😂😜😜🙌🙌
---
Same, instead of pissing a load of money up the wall on booze and food last weekend I grinded vorkath to make osrs bank and spared my irl bank lol.
---
What does paft mean
---
Nice reading skills.
---
How fucking dare you have your own opinion
---
Im wondering how this poll will compare to the real one, since the most people who vote on this will have a stronger feeling on the poll than the average ingame voter.
---
But without such updates, we never would've had the polling system and the ability to direct the game updates the way we want. When one door closes, another one opens, OP
---
Because we have a bunch of useless skills already.
---
Granted I'm still on the fence about the whole thing I might vote yes but I really rather them add some worthwhile content to like the 10ish skills that serve almost no purpose at this point on regular accounts then quest requirements and making the numbers go higher.
---
look me up in bentoki
---
"This is what happened to me so this is how it always is." There are more factors that go into if they give you a perm first time. When osrs came out me and my buddies that played way back in the day wanted to pk but we have jobs now so we botted accounts. We had some get permed off rip and some got second chances.
---
This is amazing!
---
I have no idea why Fairy rings are even on an elite achievment diary. Not only does it not make sense lorewise. Its also a riddiculous requirement for something which is essentially a QoL reward. As much as people would like you to think its a life changing experience. Its really just 1 inventory slot, not powerful at all, and just helps when you forget the staff.
---
In 2010, it was reward for a mid level quest which required like 50s statwise.
---
He just wants to know which items to merch
---
Because the majority of Americans who condemned that practice are at fault.
---
Some nice stats
---
Remember to visit the Beer museum, Hemingway bar and Absintherie.
---
Old-school refers to the recreation of the 2007 scape servers. Precisely. For me, the game hasn't been 'oldschool 2007 scape' for a while now. I had thought that this new skill would be the epitome of the debate. I'm voting no until the skill is more fleshed out. I don't quite fancy how it's been pitched, nor the training method, the rewards, or even the minigames.
---
Remember when they killed the wild for a bit?  Oof.
---
Tbh the mage armor issue could have been handled like in rs3 - crafting. Want more of a magical feel? Tie in with RC. We already make staves via crafting with a magic tie in.
---
I get wanting to add a new skill, but at least make it something different and unique rather than just a mage production skill.
---
Just out of interest, what mechanics do you think sarachnis teaches you?
---
If they had made skills more rewarding and/or fun to train between 70-99 this could have been a good idea. As it is now most people either suffer through or afk/bankstand through to 99 so adding 110 just adds a lot more to suffer through.
---
But when adding more rewards to higher level it also becomes power creep. Lower levels will have a hard time catching up.
---
Maybe should be based on damage
---
I’m 107 cb with 102 CoX killcount. It’s isn’t as inefficient as you think it is. Things like GWD is different story
---
What the fuck does his flair have to do with it

Imagine being a little bitch and dropping a near 1m karma account
---
When you do not have elite diary done, but you are lazy to bank (when bursting dust devil, nech etc)
---
Why would magic and crafting need expansions? They already have more than enough content (especially magic). Only RC could make use of some new updates, but then I don't know if the whole warding skill makes sense integrated in RC. Also you would have the RC elitists "back in my day we had to […]".
---
Im very curious as well
---
Runelite
---
Well, in my opinion the entire hunter skill is "not very 2007" .
---
Exactly why I'm voting yes. Very well thought out new car they presented us.
---
That one annoying ass obstacle is probably the only bad part
---
He is referring to your first point....
---
If I need a random obscure item for clue scrolls or quests, I cant be bothered to wait.
---
Ummm jimflez? First offense perma ban NOT OK!!!
---
(Laughs in 2 gmail accounts)
---
The graphics devs are out of touch and will make those things have out of place graphics that really stand out and not fit with the environment
---
Make it an even 100 and you got a deal
---
Warding has never made sense as a skill to me and never will no matter how much stuff they shove into it. I'm not opposed to most of the ideas but they can be incorporated into existing skills.
---
Understandable, some people just don't want to see a new skill regardless of what it is
---
92 is half of 99
---
Voting no, this game is supposed to be OSRS, not RS4.
---
07 with some new content, a whole new skill is too much.
---
The real big brain move is voting yes to be able to make it into the 2000 total level servers
---
Technically it’s 2013 so the EOC would’ve been released already...
---
Link to the smackdown?
---
So anyoneone who doesn't want this new ""skill"" can't use other new weapon/armour? My bad.
---
If you actually leave this echochamber for once and search some other opinions why people vote no it might help you understand. But I'm afraid that is a bit too much too ask. Stay safe in this echochamber and be very suprised.
---
For calculating go effiency it doesn't matter how long for each you are using them
---
“You probably remember better than I do”... FUCK
---
yeah, you're funny cunt.
---
I think it's just a regular ol' racist tho
---
It doesn't matter for how long you are using them to calculate gp effiency
---
Wait what... he’s been playing for 4-5 YEARS and this is only his second attempt??
---
We are probably the same age, if you missed im a full time student right now? There is always a way, find it.
---
Better take some pictures of the exp rates with my bot just incase I get caught
---
They released dragon slayer 2, monke madness 2, chambers of xeric, theatre of blood, Zeah, inferno, mobile.
---
All of them are large content and you're focusing on they're only fuckup which has been improved on...
---
i mean if it passes its gonna be good with this level of gatekeeping so its not like its a bad thing to have ppl that are a hard buy for new skills
---
Sounds like he was you and you botted tbh
---
So the hive mind is deeming yes votes to be allowed now. Nice influencing of the people
---
dont worry i already knew that there wasnt anything you could do for me.
---
dont forget firemaking the most useless skill in runescape imo.
---
looks like we're still safe
---
Yeah turning Zanaris blue was fucking retarded
---
Get a Neitiznot as well
---
You need to go through Jagex's support page.

---
A hops patch. A tree patch would probably have helped for the balloon quest, though.
---
honestly i think its rad to get just to level a new skill.
---
Torn between A &amp; B
---
Petition for a quest that replaces the Saradomin followers on Entrana with Zaros
---
it was obvious he botted but he never straight up confirmed it from what i could see earlier, except that one tweet he made that was obviously a joke lol
---
Nerf wasn't even that to be honest though. People were posting dps calculations about it and it went from like a 30% accuracy against the person with bulwark to like 31%, or something similar.
---
&gt; mate made an outlandish claim that it cost 2mil an hour to use D darts
---
I know; but this statement from OP is not regarding efficiency just the raw cost of using the darts. I think OP is mistaking the two and not considering efficiency at all just the raw cost of the darts he is using per hour(300k worth)
---
To efficiently use dragon darts at zulrah you need to be able to make in excess of 13m/h consistantly, as the maths suggests in the discord channel.
---
It doesn't fit smithing because smithing is for melee armour.
---
It doesn't fit crafting because making armour in crafting is more related to needlework.
---
It doesn't fit runecraft because runecraft is about making runes, not armour.
---
It doesn't fit magic because magic is about casting spells.
---
Do you also think that fishing should be part of hunter? Should herblore be part of cooking? Should fletching be part of crafting? Should runecraft be part of magic? Should smithing be part of crafting?
---
By adding this content to other skills, not only does it feel very out of place, it also would not provide an item sink on anyway near the same scale.
---
so you are too poor to buy skills but dont wanna do them without buying. interesting reason to be upset.
---
but how it is 2.5mil an hour i did zul for a few hours and dident use that much
---
i think it goes both ways though. i think there are people that would vote yes to a shitty skill simply because they want more updates. think about the updates you've personally voted strong *no*s to. there are always people who vote yes for those updates.
---
Whats the point then?
---
Is void the best method to use? i'm trying to find a good setup to start doing this myself.
---
Well you'd vote no to 1 but still vote yes to some of the others then, because at the very least if it does get voted in despite you not wanting it you can at least still get some of the things you wanted. Unless you're adamant about none of them coming through a new skill, then you'd vote no to everything.
---
I was watching someone stream last night who was complaining Jagex hid poll results so they could put warding in even if it didn’t pass. I reminded them that we voted for hidden poll results. I got banned lol
---
&gt;-What are the benefits that will entice players to train/ level up that isn't for the sole purpose of maxxing?
---
This is the one I'm really targeting, because right now the answer is nothing. Warding as a skill is like 2/3rds of the way to being great, but that last third - the actual purpose of the skill - is the part they haven't seemed to be able to get any traction on yet.
---
lol nice use of neck beard
---
Insulting someone is a sure way to turn an abstain to a no.
---
they aren't as good as the fire tome anyway so shouldn't make much difference?
---
&gt;too poor to buy
---
false
---
&gt;don’t wanna do them without buying
---
correct, because to not do that is a waste of time
---
Seeing how the subreddit readers' opinions compare to the results of the in-game poll.
---
probably have botted as soon as 'his offence got removed 3 months ago'
---
I think what a lot of people forget is that the skill will get more rewarding with time. Things like quest requirements are what give lots of skills value. That's why I'm voting yes, it may not be perfect on release but I trust the devs to keep working it after release.
---
yaw teain me apart Jagex
---
Lamps, baby!
---
Skilling rings that fill your inventory faster arent merely useless, they can also make power skilling more annoying if the % is too high. So there would need to be full xp also rewarded with the double yield to be worth it
---
Where was that, on here? I missed it idk what's going on
---
If warding focused on the other things and not magic smithing, it might actually be a good skill. Until then, though, its garbage.
---
Am I reading this right or does the best armor warding has to offer come at level 80, then the only things between 80 and 99 are some one-offs like a BiS magic ammo slot item and an upgraded rune pouch?
---
Obviously stuff can be added, but I feel like a new skill shouldn't be completely devoid of content for 80% of the xp required for 99.
---
Stick to ice.
---
B so far is best no doubt
---
You could just spend a while afk at gargs while playing a different account
---
same. Lost fuckload of fresh accs. Rip these unique names tho.
---
I got barrows gloves with base 45s combat. Theres no way at 70 attack you dont have the other stats to get em
---
This is slightly off topic, but I like using wardrobes for my outfits to save space. However why are xerician robes not in the magic wardrobe? Bothers me more than it should.
---
The clip was from this weekend though so it was in the time frame that he was banned for
---
I'd like to see warding used to redo elemental workshop
---
Paging u/girlfriend2007scape
---
the best argument i've ever heard to voting yes to warding is that it makes training RC harder.
---
Do you have access to the PayPal account? I would just cancel the card on there till the membership runs out.
---
Honestly it's kind of sad it took this long to ban him. Who knows how long he could of been botting on that account.
---
5 heads and no unique, 2 rune spears, spirit seed, dragonfruit seed, 25 onyx tips x2. 
---
Keep on trying and eventually RNG will decide if you are worthy.
---
They would have to find jobs if Jagex actually banned them for the RWT going on with Revenant's profit.
---
I'm sure many people who say they won't vote for a new skill also voted no to all of Kourend, Raids, new BiS items for a lot of slots across all three styles and new skilling methods. Atleast I did.
---
Even when that's not the case, just not wanting a new skill is a completely valid stance that could have many reasons.
---
Yes, Runescape got many new skills back in the day, and I often had a problem with those, but this is the first time I have any real voice.
---
Why would u record ur own gameplay in the first place? If youre just doing granite... seems like he recorded it in an attempt to cover his ass afterwards
---
Do u want to repost again?
---
🅱
---
Only took 3900 tries..yeeeet
---
Amen brother. The cancer is downvoting you, I am trying to fight back with an upvote, brother.
---
Kids reading this. You have a lesson to learn here. Look at the picture and notice how horribly the guy acts in the chat. It's disgusting and not funny at all. You have a chance to be positive and brighten someone's day or you can be a dick head like SEWERRATLORD. I promise you that if you choose to act nice to each others, it will feel a thousand times better than trolling people and being a cunt.
---
the main problem with this nerf, is that its destroying combos for all brackets. you see the gmaul because it is instant and combos with everything. Everybracket uses gmaul. when gmaul is nerfed, every single bracket trying to use a gmaul would have to unskull. Idk if it will end up being good or worse for the game but its going to slow everything down. AGS best spec Weapon, void range best accounts, and thats that. Good players and triple eating can easily abuse this nerf.  
---
Safing is actually going to be a real thing now tbh....
---
Thank you for waiting until after the real poll results to post these results, as not doing so would probably cause skewed votes in line with Reddit's opinion.
---
AKA, "If everyone on Reddit voted yes, guess I'll vote yes too, they seem to know what they're doing."
---
Nice try, Google. I don’t have an account and I’m not creating one.
---
Honestly, mourning's end part 2 isn't that annoying.     
---
DS2's only hard part is the end boss, and if you have experience with bossing you won't really find it too difficult. 
---
MM2 is just fucking aids though. Shittiest fucking quest in the game, no doubt. Whoever decided that RS needs more sneaking sections is objectively wrong
---
"makes thing like vorkath and revs feel like a job"
---
When saying something like that and using it as a negative and a reason NOT to release Warding, that would imply that they are complaining about the grind of farming gp. If playing a game feels like a job, why are you doing it?
---
Is your screen cracked?
---
No one tell anyone I've been playing since RuneScape classic and never even attempted it....
---
No it’s not
---
B is clean as hell. B for sure.
---
No clue why the app would be doing that haha
---
Zelda?
---
Yes warding. No moths!
---
The criticism is of buyables not of vorkath and revs
---
I live in a one bedroom with one cat. But the cat is part barnacle.
---
I guess I have a snowflake ironman after all!
---
&gt; I am all for Warding providing they don't intertwine it with other skills to the point where it is essential to raise Warding to progress efficiently in existing skills.
---
Maybe not for *progression's* sake, but if warding isn't intertwined with other aspects of the game it will certainly feel like an excuse to add dissolving for the economy. Something that will be weird in retrospect (if warding passes) is that only the newly-added warding-specific quests would have warding requirements. You could literally make a currently-maxed account with all achievement diaries (save for qcape emote step) and all but 2 or 3 quests done without ever training the skill.
---
It could be a little confusing cus option b is clearly the best but in the twitter post that was option 3. I do hope people dont get caught out with that
---
Yes exactly. Dude has been botting for years. Their bot detection is shit.
---
Can they make the login smaller or transparent? I think that it covers up too much of the background tbh.
---
I like them all!
---
remove special attacks from the game. Problem solved.
---
Fuckin oooosh.
---
The most accurate description yet
---
Literally voting for any reason that is your own is a good reason to vote. That’s all.
---
What is it with nerds on this sub not knowing how to shotgun....
---
Ironman money??
---
While he definitely put a lot of effort into that post, there's so many bullshit points that you really can't take it seriously. Literally 90% of his negative points can apply to any other non-combat skills of OSRS if they would be proposed. And then the other points are "oh well it's designed to nerf/buff other things ingame, it can be fused with crafting, rc etc. 
---
Horseshit arguments.
---
And people say pkers are toxic lmfao
---
Also this is my first time breaking the law. As you can see, I got off probation from the last one three months ago.
---
Since when vote results are shown before the poll ends? Have you ever seen something like that? Is that hard to understand that showing results has a negative influence ?
---
I am all for warding if it is developed right. I don’t want them rushing to have it in the game ASAP. When I first read about warding it sounded awful and just not good content (it seemed rushed).  I haven’t read much up on it yet but I probably will within the next couple of days. 
---
I do like how they are taking our feedback and using it to improve the skill.
---
A
---
They're gonna change the entire game. It's gonna be like when summoning came out and literally changed how everything is done. "Battle wards" is a horrible idea.
---
So many chaos runes, gz
---
&gt; Elemental shield are made of metal, so they fit in smithing, warding is not proposing shields.
---
The Thaumaturge set has a shield in it, all the proposed sets have hats (you conveniently left that bit out), and this is a shit argument anyways. Splitbark/bloodbark/soulbark are made of bark, does that mean it's woodcutting/fletching and not warding?
---
&gt;making xerician robes is needlework based
---
How do you propose the silk turns into robes?
---
&gt;By casting magic spells, something you you don't do in warding.
---
Please explain the difference.
---
So you've been 100% in favor of every update? Of course there's going to be "politics" in a game where the community gets to choose the updates.
---
So should we have a basketweaving skill, needleworking skill, jewellery crafting skill, glass blowing skill? I mean just because it doesn’t exactly fit the name of the skill doesn’t mean it doesn’t belong. But again I really don’t care whether you get the robes from warding or crafting or as a drop from pvm. 
---
Also how is warding any different from needlework? From what I understood from the blog you use silk and vis and other items to create armour? Besides obviously using vis to enchant(?) the armour how is that different from crafting? 
---
My point of bringing it up as another buyable is that it lacks a lot of depth, sure it makes thematic sense but it seems pretty boring to train, if this was a new way to engage with runecrafting wouldn’t that be better solution to fix that dead skill? 
---
I also want to point out that I am currently 98 rc (rsn: Dabs4NaeNaes) and am not asking for new content just so I don’t have to do that skill. You could make warding as extremely slow exp for rc so that it doesn’t disrupt the meta, but it gives more depth to the skill. How often do people even use runecrafting, besides ironman who actually crafts runes?? How many times have you used even 20% of the altars we have in the game? I haven’t and I’m sure most people don’t. 
---
And my final point that I think would make sense, why are we even drawing wards in the first place, why not use the already existing altars in the game from runecrafting, maybe there would be different bonuses for visiting and training warding at those specific altars? 
---
Again I don’t have a huge problem with warding, and I really want a new skill, it just seems to be too basic of a skill and osrs already has a huge problem with existing skills being too basic.
---
Literally unplayable
---
i botted once, got banned for two weeks.... god what a boring two weeks... i learned my listen real quick
---
Yes
---
It's not quite that much. It's around 70k or so, but only 4 patches to visit.
---
I’ve had 1,400+ Chaos eines in one drop, supplies are crazy. Thanks!
---
I like B the most. Where were these posted at?
---
Nah, you're just so wrong man. I got perma banned for fly fish botting, dropping fish. 17 year old account, first offense. Double spaced name. Last time I checked, powerfishing barbarian fishing wasn't a big money maker.
---
What's being proposed isn't making armour like that though. It'll be more afkable and faster xp, something that would be very unbalanced to add to runecraft.
---
I have no idea what's going on here. I was expecting some I mahatma I or IHQ69 or elvmage something.
---
200M worth of 3t granite takes a toll on your health
---
just wear max mage+sang and nobody's gonna fuck with you.
---
Construction was a social skill back in the day. Back when house parties for the hell of it were a thing. When you could spend hours at someone’s house going through the dungeon, boxing in the ring, and generally just hanging out. It was cool to see peoples different designs and layouts and the money they sank into it. It was the ultimate XP waste, and we loved it. 
---
Nowadays construction doesn’t seem to have a place because nobody does stuff like this anymore. It’s there solely to get the benefit of teleports and the ornate pool. Maybe save a few bank spaces. Gilded alter is useless for anyone except hardcore ironmen, which can’t even open their house to other people.
---
Not arguing for the guy, but some people are very good friends (and/or irl friends) with their clan mates.
---
I'd honestly vote no to that
---
Fuck the people who say yes to warding. It will change everything down to pvm/pvp fights. They mention "battle wards"...I wasn't against it until that.
---
20m
---
The whole game is based around grinding XP for things though? It doesn't matter what you do, if you do it efficiently it's going to cost you a ton of money, or if it's a gathering skill you will make no gp for faster xp.
---
I find it interesting that you're fine with dropping cash on gear, of which a lot of the top end stuff is a marginal upgrade on the more affordable options, yet you don't like spending gp on xp, which you could argue is the entire point of the game on the first place?
---
Fair play to you though, you seem to hate most if not all forms of skilling yet have a maxed account.
---
The difference is that invention is a well thought out skill with a unique identity and function. Warding lacks both idenity and uniqueness. It's literally an amalgamation of existing skills and mechanics.
---
Dissolving items is not what makes invention invention and is not what makes warding warding. Dissolving items could be added in any number of ways.
---
&gt;take a joke

&gt;is defensive at a joke

Guys it was  his first offense though!/s

Dungeoneering was awesome imo.
---
That would change the core of the game though? If you're so against grind, maybe osrs isn't the game for you, sorry man.
---
Congratulations, you've just advanced a Shotgunning level.
---
Your Shotgunning level is now 2.

I want it because new skills were always my favourite part of runescape, and this sounds like a fun addition
---
Interesting parts of this grind/the tab
---
\- First Tome at 28KC
---
\- Completed 1st Pyromancer set before 100KC
---
\- First Phoenix at 202KC. Died with it, got it back around 400KC.
---
\- Magic logs were from the very last crate I opened.
---
\-  Account is 8 days old, 3days11hours spent online ingame (not entirely all WT but most of it)
---
&gt; without exposure to non-obvious or questinable value additions which already ruined the original game once
---
1. Are we gonna imply that things that destroyed RS3 wre Warding? 
---
2. If something is not obvious or questionable am  I gonna base my decision on my feeling of it being questionable to me or should I try to ask questions and try to understand that once I understand that I can form an obvious opinion why I think it is bad and vote according to it (devs should provide answers to these peopel who ar concerned) - I just think it is not a reasonable decision to vote against somethng because you fear something blury and possibly bad in the future if you can rationally understand it. 
---
At the same time what we like and we do not like is very subjective but in that case I feel it hard to accept as a general argument why to why should somebody vote no because somebody didn't like summoning 12 yeasr ago and does not like Warding nowadays.
---
KFC has nothing on Popeyes tbh.
---
Your mentality is all wrong.
---
Some methods are for best xp
---
Some methods are for best profit
---
Some methods are for hybridized xp
---
Hunter is almost necessary for the skill though because of the vast array of materials hunter creatures produce when trapped.
---
Dorgesh-Kaan please
---
It’s not about adding the new BIS gear. It’s about filing gaps in mage armor since they’re all pretty much useless up to mystics. Until salad robes were added there was an even bigger gap. Some of the niche things are pretty inventive. Dhide shields aren’t game breaking but we’re a welcomed addition to the game. Warding is trying to also fill those little gaps. Not sure if we need a whole new skill for it, but I appreciate them trying to fill out the mage side of the triangle.
---
A slayer-like task skill for non-combat skills would have been really nice. 
---
I was pumped when I saw the idea of it. I think though when it was introduced people weren't interested in a new skill yet. 
---
I wonder if it went back for a vote if it would get more votes now.
---
Hope our hit the report button
---
You wouldn't be able to log in with that same e-mail, it has to be a unique one
---
you might be able to free up your e-mail in the account settings on your banned account and then link it with your new account, not 100% sure though
---
I want dungeoneering instead :(
---
Crush it with pestle &amp; mortar
---
Think I've got this all wrong actually...
---
The only thing that I really want Jagex to address is that right now, very few (especially) group bosses take reasonable damage from magic. Things like Barrows and Kracken exist, but all wilderness, GWD, etc, all heavily resist magic for some reason. 
---
It just makes it really hard to play with magic as your primary combat stat and I’m not really sure why.
---
Oh cool it’s... an item... nice?
---
they both logs you off for 10-45 mins every 2 or 3 hours
---
I have no issues with grinding
---
I'd rather a skill be overbloated than completely empty; which warding absolutely is. It's also laughable to say that this would make crafting bloated when it already literally creates cloth items.
---
Creating magical armor doesn't have to be good RC xp (if that's the direction we're hypothetically talking about going in). If the act of creating magic armor is so integral to the game then it would be fine to just allow RC to take up the mantle, but have it not be a viable training method.
---
It wouldn't be "added" to magic any more than enchanted bolts or suffering was "added" to magic.
---
People would shit over chinchompas, 100% wouldn’t pass.
---
Never getting 75 attack
---
I'd rather just nmz afk a maxed combat and do raids if I needed money
---
smithing brings a ton of gp into the game
---
im not talking about gold smithing at bf, but making a weapon or any piece of armor steel+ brings gp into the game. i always thought that was the purpose of smithing
---
This isn't going to solve the issue with end game items becoming way to common though.  No one is going to dissolve bandos tassets.  They are going to do it to rune platelegs which people already high alch.  Literally it doesn't solve the market crisis, its just another buyable.  It's a no for me.
---
Fuck off lol
---
Don’t want a new skill in OSRS point blank period.
---
how do I delete someone elses comment?
---
And brain dead vorkath farming is like 2-3x that
---
Overloads hurt you for 50hp when you drink them but when it expires you get the health back.
---
The last time I used an auto clicker was a decade ago and even then my free, malware infested, autoclicker had an "offset" setting so the mouse would not click the same pixel every time.  You underestimate botters.
---
Nice gear man, ignore all the people telling you what to do. The fun in Runescape is that its an open world game and you can play the way you want
---
Let’s be real, most people have decided and nothing from a person on Reddit will change their mind.
---
look closer
---
Holy shit this guy has problems
---
There was a stretch for a bit where people saying Jagex should remove polling or lower it to 50% were getting a lot of upvotes and I felt the same way. New people who look at osrs as it's own thing without the context of RS3.
---
Oh, I’m sorry. I misunderstood. Yea that would be pretty weird.
---
So the first guy is right, I'm just a nerd and I need to drink overloads instead of wasting cash on pots
---
You have to think of what it will do to boost the economy of the game as well. Being able to disassemble items will be huge! It's taking apart and using other skills incorporated to fit the needs of the skill. It's a great idea.
---
i do it everyday and sell that gold and then every 3rd day I'll stake it a few times so like $150/week in average after paying subscription fees
---
Nah I doubt that's the reason
---
Yup
---
I think the issue with pking is more that a lot of the time getting pked is more a nuisance than actually useful for the pker, thus all the spade memes.
---
This has got to be the worst counter argument yet. Well done.
---
Currently maxed?
---
I love the extra demographic questions for statistical analysis. I.e. newer players more accepting of change.
---
A and D are too close to the Karuulm theme though
---
&gt; So many negative implications and potential unexpected outcomes
---
As with every update. Should have just left osrs in the vanilla state. /s
---
I'll look at it a second time in a few and see if I can figure it out. If I can't then I suppose I'll live still. Thanks for the replies either way:)
---
But they detailed it would be trained similar to smithing or crafting rates.....
---
I’m hoping this passes. I remember being a member when Hunter first dropped and that was a magical experience.
---
Also I’m hoping that the creation of a Warding Guild would result in some modifications to the Mages Guild as a result. 
---
Guilds need major work and this could be used to shore up at least one along with bringing some new content into the game
---
as far as i know, he’s a one-off occurence. i believe rs3 expanded on his lore and an eastern land, but he stands alone in oldschool. 
---
on the topic of immersion: is it not equally plausible to make him a seasoned traveler who’s had a chance to become fluent in whatever they speak in gielinor? i see a hole in this argument as well, if an eastern continent is ever released. if players travel to an eastern continent with eastern design, it’s to be expected that inhabitants of that land won’t be fluent in “english” as well; imo, “true” and “complete” immersion would be them speaking their native language, but that isn’t feasible for obvious reasons. is the solution to this, then, to make them all speak broken english, just to convey that foreignness? probably not, because people would lose their shit in 2019. no, they’d probably just speak **normal english,** (probably with some kind of local flair) because what other options are there?
---
Yea true. But I feel like this is an “emergency/urgent issue” for someone with that high of a rank. In order to be top ten, this pretty much has to be your life...all day every day.
---
Diamond spec hits 80+ as well
---
You got hacked?
---
Can't remember his name, but when I came back to osrs about 1 year ago someone came to me while I was killing cows and asked what level my main account was. When I told him that this is my main acc he gave me 900k 
---
Sometimes this community is cancer, sometimes it is gold..
---
Guys, B is winning.
---
Are you using runelite? How do you get the boosted stats to appear in the bottom left of the client?
---
Because you could sit down with a bunch of monkeys and a bucket of crack and come up with a better skill than warding
---
It's a fuel mix specifically for a vehicle, the reason he says people will see you as a fool is because they have a funny tendency to explode.
---
Overall I don’t think I’ll vote for it still, but that’s just me and I won’t be too butthurt If it ends up passing.
---
Nah not enough people go to the OSRS website. It’s sad, I bet less than a quarter of the people voting actually will have read the latest dev blog about it.
---
If an Ironman and normal both damage a mob does no one get the drop?
---
I think the double meaning is that le wrong generation type people always hated it thinking it was nonsense, actually missing the silent G aspect
---
Incorrect
---
B ty
---
Everytime. It's why my doctor says I have anxiety issues.
---
Fear of destabilizing the game is one
---
If the results of this poll and the real poll are different Reddit will have a meltdown even though it’s been shown many times that reddit is not a good example of the player base as a whole.
---
i spend a good 3 hours before bed just mindlessly doing a skill. definitely helps me wind down a bit.
---
1000 marks per piece
---
&gt; While he was setting up a mouse recording
---
That's not how bots work in 2019.

---
I’d say 1 spot is pretty big for any PVM. Using fairy ring for zulrah? 1 extra food, which can sometimes be the difference between a death and a teleport out. Like you said, KQ can also benefit greatly from it. Sire as well for the extra food
---
I thought how damage worked in this game is you roll vs their defense (so 82(+x for other equip boost) vs 40) then if you win you roll vs your max str hit (0~40 as an example) and that’s how CB works.
---
Tbh people that are that dedicated to this game are the delusional ones. Zero life.
---
But they didnt detail how much clicking it is.... 5000 cph for those rates isnt worth it
---
&gt; Botting should be a straight up perma ban I don't care if you're a high level or low level.
---
Lol wat. Found the botter
---
why post what he said? couldve atleast blurred the n word
---
I think that was the point...
---
I can imagine someone like this having a full blown identity crisis spawning from a ban. They spend their lives playing this game. This is probably the best thing that could happen to this guy, but having seen the addicts who play this game, hes probably already working on another account.
---
I guess we agree to disagree then. I get what you are trying to say and I especially agree with the fact that slayer in 05 when it came out was pretty lackluster and unfinished. However, with all the updates slayer has become one of the most unique and fun skills in the game imo. 
---
I understand your problem with it being restrictive, but that doesn't bother me personally. The opposite really, I enjoy slayer because it's one of the most diverse skills in the game. If I "have to" grind to 70 wc, I know I will be clicking on the same 3 trees for a couple of hours. For 70 Mining, I will be clicking on the same 3 rocks for a couple of hours. For 70 Agility, I will run this exact lap for a couple of hours.
---
However if I am about to do slayer, I don't really know if I'm going to go bossing, afking, bursting or cannoning. Also the difference between two trees or two rocks is vastly smaller than the difference between 2 mobs. 
---
TLDR: I understand your personal opinion and find it very valid. But I disagree with you.
---
im sorry, i didn’t know if it’d be worth it to do hops patches or bush patches or anything along those lines, guess ill just stick to what im doing now.
---
I thought people wanted the results hidden BEFORE you voted, and then they would visible after you voted. This would make sense to me, and I'm not sure why it wasn't implemented this way.
---
throw in hardwood trees on fossile island can do them every 3 days and a calquat tree once a day also
---
Well, imagine Jagex implementing a skill where if you spend more gp you get more xp. Like bruuuuuuuh
---
ok thanks friend, didn’t know if it would be worth it to do hops and bush patches.
---
Too many problems to list here, the main ones being another pointless buyable skill that is highlighted as being incredibly boring. If smithing were polled today, I'd likely vote no because of how poorly implemented it is, just like warding. 
---
If a new skill is going to be added, it has to be something unique that hasn't been done before. Many people, myself included, aren't against a new skill. But I don't want the game to feel more like a chore than it already does.
---
I never understood this, if you play RS to grind to max, wouldn't you want there to be another thing to max? Do you think you'll reach the ultimate nirvana once you have a max cape? Because you won't.
---
If you don't like the grind itself, you won't like getting the max cape either. If you think you will, that's just the relief it's over, which likely indicated you didn't actually enjoy it and as such you shouldn't have done it.
---
I see a lot of the same thought process in league, where people play the game even though they hate it because they think if they reach a certain rank it'll be all worth it.
---
Do your part to keep osrs old school. vote no
---
What exactly is "bot busting (moderate)"?
---
there is a bury warning plugin on runelite
---
B for Bruce, B for Brave
---
where's the update, bro?
---
A mother should have mercy to her child. The guy put hella hours into his account and obioisv cares about it, even though he botted. In fact, this guy botted skills on his Ironman, which doesn’t affect you, nor the economy. I’m not saying that botting is good, but I understand the stress of having an account banned. I think there could be more leniency when account with 5000+ hour accounts getting booted. Say remove a handful of exp or money gained from using the bot?
---
They need to spend dev time reworking bank to make it work a new skill would be amazing  but for some of us 800 just isnt enough.
---
Please explain what makes it "horrible", I think they've reworked it into a good production skill.
---
The authenticator does remember me. I saved my passwords to the app though so that may be why. Every 30 days I have to retype a new authenticator code
---
Rank 10 ironman was banned for bottling then he basically tweeted out something along the lines of "I'd like an explanation, feel free to share any info publicly" then mod weath tweeted back "probably the botting you did on the weekend" lol
---
Fruit trees and calquat is all i did to level 99 farming. Only recently added redwood, mahogany and Hespori.
---
What do you consider oldschool?
---
Do you vote no to all new content? if so, might I be able to interest you in a private server with no updates?
---
But why is it being a buyable skill a bad thing?
---
brianlets, that's a new one. gj op
---
What makes content necessary? I see a lot of people say a new skill is unnecessary idk how they can tell the difference
---
Precisely why the GE/bonds ruined the game and made all non-ironman content completely pointless
---
Wait did warding pass? I quit quite a while back back but thought it failed
---
That would be awesome! Tyvm for replying, appreciate it a lot :)
---
You should probably wait with that until you consider yourself a knowledgeable player, you're skipping a big chunk of the learning curve by having people help you as much as possible early on. Of course, you should always have the Wiki open, but there are things you need opinions on.
---
I'm in the exact same position, maxed med and i've been thinking of making a new main because I want to do Rune Dragons/Potentially raids/Bandos etc. which I can't on a med.
---
But I don't want to, after all the effort of keeping 60 attack and 70 def quested then just make it a main. I also hate questing so doing it all again seems like a big ballache.
---
We couldn't vote on any of those skills in the first place, so I'm not sure why that matters.
---
Additionally, your argument sort of boils down to "We have uninspiring skills in the game already, so we should be able to add a new one!"
---
Having skills with very little complexity (firemaking) does not mean we should add more...
---
We should have more content like Wintertodt, for example, which really re-invigorated a reason to train firemaking. That's the sort of content I believe most players would prefer to be added.
---
It's a perfectly valid argument in an mmo where you decide your own path.
---
Counter point, vote Yes to warding. Don't really need to put a reason why because you never bother to either.
---
yes pls
---
Runelite could in theory audit poll results.
---
"A while" lol
---
I didn't ask to be hurt like this.
---
This cannot be used as a weapon you cannot board the ship to Entrana.
---
Lol!
---
Half of the things you mentioned is medieval, and it dosnt really matter because back in 2004-2007 everybody saw this game as a medieval game, nothing else. Sure there was alot of small things that maybe wasnt 100% medieval but from the bigger picture this was a medieval game and thats also what attracted myself and others to play runescape over wow etc
---
This is too high quality for this sub
---
Is I do agree. However people are entitled to have that mindset of voting no to any skill. Whether you think that is a bad reason or not they are allowed to feel that way.  And it only limits in a new skill lol. They can create new mini games. New raids. New bosses. They can anything
---
Why though? I haven't touched hunter, farming, or con outside of quest rewards. I'm not a fan of those skills but I don't bitch saying they are bad skills or need to be removed. They just aren't my cup of tea, but I know others enjoy those skills.
---
I'm just afraid that most of the magic armors are going to be recoloured versions of already existing armour, especially if they have names like 'bloodbark' or 'soulbark'. Dragon hai and Arceuus are already in the game so that only leads to a few really unique sets.
---
None of those things are medieval. There has never been any of those in real life.
---
what?
---
I'm unsure if this is satire or not. Please can you flare this correctly?
---
Eh, a couple hours or so.
---
Yea I see what you're saying, it's a weird skill that's for sure. Has to be something better out there as well, and they could definitely work on skills that need expanded before they add a new one, like smithing, hunter and heck they had so much planned for the farming guild and did like half of it.
---
fuck you, you little bitch broke boy
---
I was for awhile but now I play again lol, caught the itch. It's been an on again off again relationship that started around 05-06
---
lmfaooooo
---
Compared to other skills, it's orders of magnitude more interesting:
---
Woodcutting: a few different axes, after level 60 just dragon forever, like 6 different trees and only a few are worth cutting after certain levels, and the skill itself - click tree until full, bank repeat.  Biggest "variety" is a bird nest.
---
Slayer: different slayer masters, different locations, different monsters with different combat styles, and most importantly, each monster drops many different items
---
oh yeah you’re just misinterpreting what i’m saying
---
i’d rather it just have rates that are tied to the levels not how much wealth you have and instead be tied to effort
---
like hunter can be 110K if you do it normally, but up to 280K if you go hard on it
---
This plugin van get you banned
---
It's your first offence too! How could Brainlax let this happen?
---
I don't understand how one skill can "ruin" a game, but ok I guess. I didn't play back then so I guess I wouldn't know?
---
Stfu
---
[Just remember these 2 words when you feel like giving up on Raids](https://youtu.be/jEI3N9kIyP4?t=7)
---
Get d platelegs. They have better defence stats than obby legs. Obby legs are only worth it if they give you an extra max hit which they rarely do.
---
You are the voice of the toxicity of this community... You don't even know what you are talking about, did you even read the blog? If so, provide us with some solid arguments on why we should vote no instead of this random idiotic bullshit.
---
Instead of going on and on and calling people who wants it ingame "weebs" why don't you actually tell us why you don't want it ingame?
---
Good try
---
That's the only time you'll hear that response.
---
I had a bot I used years ago, like 2009 or 2010, before the bot nuke. It was a green dragon bot that'd I occasionally run overnight when I was low on cash. The only punishment I got was a short ban, I want to say 48 hours, and a few random skills were rolled back like 7 levels. I've been to scared to bot since.
---
Yeah, I have calibration issues too. Sent a bug report when it happened for the first time, but nothing happened. I wonder if other people sent reports...
---
Then why not add an item sink as an item sink instead of disguising it as a skill?
---
I voted B and thought I’d be in the minority. Glad to see others liked it too.
---
I will vote yes if someone gives me bond at half the GE price. I like this skill overall but i dont have time to play OSRS right now.
---
Yeah like everyone in osrs
---
That's the issue with 1-99s is your first skills are a snooze fest for videos. Really no additional content.. Just grinding boring skills  
---
But if you link your youtube ill subscribe and check them out as they progress
---
Quite sure the other Olympus founder has acc shared for pvm goals
---
Good thing youre always a kid again when you log in
---
Like 80 mil loaned some had more but im on a break so i loaned some
---
Why exactly is it a bad skill?
---
But why does that need to be in the form of a new skill?
---
Just pick and choose what you can afford from the strategy page on the osrs [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzHaar_Fight_Cave/Strategies)
---
You shouldn’t need 48 minutes of antifire for 6-7 kills
---
*After a quick search and a devious grin, the monks allow you to board.*
---
Because Slayer scape is priority and zeah has bukkus of Slayer scape. 
---
Not to mention easy farming training and house rep system for subpar rewards excluding quest gating or a quick tele to a Slayer area.
---
There are many skills I enjoy, but there are some I dont enjoy but I want to get them because the final product (Skillcape) gives me joy. Its not worth the risk for a Potential new skill that could be boring aswell, there is more than enough to do in runescape even now. I dont want something new to Break the game.
---
Ty
---
Sigh.....\*unzips pants\*
---
I thought the issue with polls in the past was showing us poll results before we’d even voted.
---
??? okay your baiting at this point, get blocked
---
Im maxed and cba getting another 99
---
Yeah, especially with the recent bitching about Dinh's and black d'hide, warding seems like it might even help. It will add more ways for lower level mage items to enter the market lowering their price and opportunities to add more powerful magic gear that could help blast through player's magic defenses.
---
No jagex didnt want ironmen being able to abuse other peoples accounts for training so the only xp you can possibly get from pking is the magic base casting xp.
---
I see Bobby B, I upvote
---
The entire Reddit front page is telling everyone to vote Yes. Even your comment is a subtle hint how you want people to vote.
---
lol ok. I'm right so I'm baiting.
---
Part of the fun for some is learning. 
---
When I was younger the game was a lot more mysterious which made it a lot more fun.
---
They can have a massive impact on how the game is played, look at dungeoneering &amp; summoning as examples of that. Not saying this one will, but that's the fear.
---
Not satire. Just a funny way of calling Jagex names and to raise the eyebrow of the reader. However, I am legitimate when I say to vote no for warding.
---
Yeah, but the issue there is, if you want XP, you don’t get to choose from any of that content. At least when I chop a Mage log, I know I’m getting 250XP. If I go to a slayer master, of which there are only a couple worth using once you’re any decent combat level, I have to kill what they tell me to kill, unless I can skip it. 
---
It’s pointless having a ton of variety if you don’t get to access it at will and reap the reward.
---
See I thought it would just be the first boss. Imagine my surprise when I saw that it the length was 7:30! Amazingly well done!
---
Well. Can always count on reddit to have your back lol.
---
-35 karma we should definitely do the opposite of whatever this guy says
---
This also works for allotments, same technique.
---
Holy fucking incel
---
I voted B because it made me feel like when I was crawling out of that damn underground pass to this neato place
---
It's pure cheating, and what's even worse it makes you a worse runescape player as well. You don't have to think on your own anymore, the client does pretty much everything for you. It shows you have to kill Jad and all other PvM bosses. But i guess it suits the lazy generation of today.
---
I think the issue for some people is that there is already quite a lot of dead content existing in the game, so adding a new skill takes away time from reviving or reworking said content.
---
I generally like it but am not a huge fan of infinity robes having a source outside of MTA. How will crafting it work the the collection log?
---
literally describing me, started again because of Mika’s DMM series, I see it as a survival game which keeps it fun
---
Regardless of if it's common or not that would make me feel like shit
---
It's not a new skill. It's just more of the same. I don't want it
---
What stats do you recommand?
---
I don’t see what value you’re talking about, here. You’re just saying that we have some poorly thought-out skills already, so warding should be fine.
---
You’re comparing warding to trash skills. I don’t want another trash skill.
---
Because people try to downplay the other sides legitimate thoughts with brainless memes.
---
Your opinion is not progressive enough for reddit. Fuck you. Sincerely, reddit. ^/s
---
It's likely just a clickbait tier update carefully manufactured for the perfect release time to help increase players/returning players who would jump at the chance of buying membership to test out the new skill.
---
Asking for a ftiend too. Slide in the dms
---
:( oh, I'll delete it then :(
---
personally I like the login B screen, the colors represent more of an Elve-ish vibe. and remind of doing roving elves for the first time. that being said A,C,D are not bad. I think that the production team should pick the one that best fits with the identity of the quest. Im super excited!
---
and if ya nan had wheels she'd be a bike?
---
I'm pretty convinced I own the actual unluckiest account in history. I've seen people drier than me for a specific pet, but never anyone who had *zero* pets with my stats. All of my 'petable' skills are 99+ (14m RC, 14m agil, 18m farm, 14.5m wc...) and not a single pet on the horizon. Other fun facts:
---
* The time I did 77-99 runecraft (all in 1 go) coincided exactly with the crash in blood rune prices (early this year), which made me lose a potential ~40m gp
---
* I'm currently holding just under 30k giant seaweed, which is by itself just under 20% chance of pet (~1k seeds, all harvested post-99)
---
* Getting the Skull scepter took me a total of nearly 500 kills, due to having to kill over 350 cattablepons for the 1/33 bottom of scepter (that's a 0.0021% chance for it to take this long, rarer than getting any pet I still don't have despite 120m+ 'petable' exp).
---
A second crafting skill won’t keep players interested or help with longevity. It’s literally a bank standing skill. How about you focus your time on some fun and engaging content instead? 
---
Nex/dg ?
---
&gt;Lmao. OK yeah. This sub is actually super friendly and welcoming of changes into the game..my bad
---
Honestly the buyable skills are a fucking chore and I don’t like having to do them. I already have enough skills to burn my money on. I’m voting no.

i posted this as a joke, which is why it's clearly tagged "humor". but the real joke is all of these experts in racism responding with a sincere 5 paragraph essay about why this isn't racist that i will never read
---
Literaly fucked up my hand the other day doing this. Might have carpol tunnel syndrome lol. Thanks JiggleHecks
---
I do, but I also play a HCIM and love wildy/boss content so it's... really conflicting. At least I can relax whilst skilling
---
Again, that is not Jebrim. That’s a completely different player. Do you see the name Jebrim anywhere?
---
Because the current system to get magic armor is awful?

For real, I've literally never seen the straw man example that shows up in every single reddit argument.

Dude if enchanted forrest was a hub for warding and the warding skill cape was like one of those centaurs or something, that'd be so fucking bad ass. They'd have to make a way to get there from the warding quest tho or risk locking warding content behind FairyTale Pt2

I guess there’s some confusion as to who the actual owner of that account is, I had read various times that was one of Jebrims alts. If it isn’t, I apologize for attributing the clip to him. Doesn’t really change my point that mouse recorders are used even at the highest of levels.

The first poll failed hard but jalgex has put significant money and time into making it so they've taken feedback and come back with warding mk 2 which is in line with what people wanted warding to be, ie not trying to be 10 skills at once.

This has to have been a subtle LOTR joke. I'm sure of it.

But like isn't invention considered a good skill?

How is it the same as other skills in your eyes?
---
Well now I'm definitely voting for warding
---
Well blacksmithing provides Best in slot plate armour. 99 smithing will provide you with a rune platebody..? Maybe if jagex made skills that we've had for almost 20 years actually relevant to the gameplay we're seeing now I would have faith in warding.
---
Of all the lies in this story his wife being up at 3am and being in contact with his friends is completely insignificant.

---
Holy strawman
---
I want to say that Warding is actually really flavorful from just filling the magic armour crafting gap in the game. And warding as a "imbuing magic into items" skill fits well and can be expanded on into areas like maybe magic weapons like magic swords and bows which would be cool asf
---
From what we've seen from the devs so far, they've put a lot of time and effort into Warding even while it's not guarenteed to make it into the game. I think it's safe to say that they'll make more updates to the first new skill in years even after the several rounds of beta (which will fix the exp rates)
---
And an item sink is super important for the longevity of bossing and the economy
---
I haven't gotten 99 hunter yet because I don't see the point,  unlocking new monsters to slay is fun however as it's not just a meaningless advancement. You unlock something new to do. Similar to how the quests (which are themselves also pretty fun) also often unlock new areas or items or monsters 
---
Depending on what you mean by "getting everything needed for raiding" I probably didn't feel a particular joy from each item either, however they did impact how well I performed at raids or allowed me to do different bosses (such as when I got hasta for vasa or dwh for tekton), it did bring joy because it allowed me to do more.
---
I originally quit rs in 06 because I was a F2P player and at a certain point I realized I wasn't having fun and I wasn't going towards anything. All I was doing was grinding to raise numbers so I would grind faster. If I had members it might have been different because there was a lot more to do and a lot more things that would have gotten unlocked.
---
The only time I felt happy with total level was 2000 because I was finally able to access the (at that time) highest level server, which allowed me to play on all servers. And even then it was mainly because it was a common joke in my cc to say "sure come my world" when you asked something, only to notice they were on w49 &amp; you got GIGAPRANKED
---
True though
---
The economic conditions that made Invention good for RS3 don't exist in OSRS.  That's the dumbest fucking argument people bring up regarding this issue and I don't understand how it keeps getting put out.

Investing in this meme, I like it.
---
We should all vote no to personally save you a lot of time and money, so you don’t have to level the skill, would be tragic.
---
I’m not overstating anything. My account is maxed. Most of the people I play with are maxed and are going for max. Not one of us wants to see this buyable Pass. We will raise a shitstorm to hell and back and be so loud jagex won’t have a choice but to back down. We run the game. We vote in the polls. We dominate this game.
---
Fair enough, I personally use loads of visual and audio queues while bossing but to each their own
---
Lol this game has more holes than Swiss cheese

yeah this is a dumb comment

I got 99 fishing at Monkfish, and everytime I would glance up and see the heron, I'd get a little excited.. hover my mouse over, and disappointment.

The immense joy I felt when I looked back down from my tv show to see that spicy red text.. "You have a funny feeling you're being followed."
---
I legitimately just yelled "Oh my god!" about 6 times in a row. Got him at 400k xp to 99.
---
My wife was worried when I started yelling LOL
---
Wtf are you talking about? U said it had a double meaning and it doesnt. I'm not saying it has no meaning
---
Then why can't we update skills that are stuck in before 2007. 99 smithing provides you with the ability to make a rune platebody. Wow how useful. Instead of giving smithing an update it's going to have it's own skill entirely. Wonderful.
---
Banning these clients would need a sweeping ban on all third party clients. I could easily fork and compile my personal version of RL+, so it wouldn't do much good to shut down specific clients.
---
do the most efficient xp/hr methods
---
Agreed 100%. Warding sounds awesome. People just like to Reeee at any big change.
---
"A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent."
---
How is it a strawman?
---
I mean sure it could provide us with some numbers much like polling the subreddit is doing, but the person I replied to was claiming Runelite could audit poll results to see if Jagex was rigging it.  If Runelite and OSBuddy did do it, all it would do is add to the tinfoil hat fire.  
---
We have no way of knowing how many people voted on the default client other than what Jagex tells us.  The fact is, if Jagex wants to rig poll results they can.  Hidden, not hidden, Runelite auditing, nothing will prevent it.
---
Jokes and memes aside, it'd be dope if I could get a push notification letting me know that I can collect Battlestaves from Zaff or whenever I can do Tears of Guthix again.
---
I feel like that is partially a symptom of the nature of your relationship. As you said, you don’t have each other’s phone numbers because your primary communication method is in game. What about people who interact doing other things? 
---
Friends from some activity that doesn’t have a communication network built in - staying in touch with them requires you to go out and get their phone number or email or what have you.
---
Still there :(

Yeah I just like hoarding random junk lmao, I recently started a rusty sword collection for example

---
OK that's fair but these guys (the Olympus CC) were the ones who have the green light for the sandstone grinder AFAIK. It definitely devalues the old Crafting grinds that we used to have to do, but I'd rather be in this position than the one we were in two years ago where charters and battlestaves were really the only options. It could have definitely been made a bit slower to get the sand from the grinder. I suppose it fits thematically at least.
---
As for competitiveness -- sure, but I don't really have time to be competitive. I'm not maxed like you are, and I have to work 10 hours a day. I know these people have more time so they can afford to be competitive. Even if I was a day-1 ironman, I wouldn't have been able sustain the top page or even top-250, because I probably wouldn't be maxed even now (just too busy with other things). I try to play efficiently so that I can get as much done as possible in my limited playtime, but I recognize that I will never be competitive nor was I ever able to have been competitive due to school and work. So either way I think I would have had this mentality.
---
Jagex could have easily manipulated the polls regardless if results were hidden or public.
---
There is nothing about warding that couldn't be just added to crafting/smithing/rc.
---
Wait when did Warding ever get initially polled
---
You just don’t seem on board with the old school vibe. Maybe just play WoW or rs3.
---
OSRS players: Don't change iconic areas, it ruins the old school feel!
---
Also OSRS players: Literally whole screen filled with overlays.
---
Dream skill is Sailing
---
Also can you just fucking remove NMZ
---
Seems like a fun concept to me. I've always wanted to make mage robes, and I think the way they pitched it as being fundamentally a little different than crafting or smithing is pretty cool. It follows a pretty old school crafting/gathering paradigm and doesn't rock the boat too heavily.
---
Some of these things could be added to Crafting, Runecrafting, or Smithing... but I feel like those skills have their own quirks that don't make them perfect fits either. Crafting is a major overarching skill that covers a lot of things. Runecrafting generally focuses specifically on the runes themselves and will have a close relationship with Warding. Smithing is weak and really needs more incentive to be trained, but I don't think adding mage gear to Smithing is the fix.
---
I think Warding has the potential to integrate with the world and add to the game. It may be a bit samey compared to some other skills, but I think the proposed content is of reasonably good quality and future content added to the skill could make it even more robust. I like having more options for mage gear, a few of the options will be great in niche scenarios or on a budget. I think Warding is in a pretty good spot after all of the revision it has gone through and I'd be pretty excited to see it in the game.
---
I'm not sure where your WoW comparison comes from. I guess disassembling things is a lot like disenchanting them? I think adding an item sink to the game is inoffensive and I think a new skill to make magical equipment fills a niche that isn't covered well in the game already.
---
\&gt;but I think the ability to create mage armour warrants its own skill
---
And I disagree.
---
Fully you gotta plug your youtube man. Fantastic mobile only series
---
Flytta til.....HOKKSUND
---
i think what he's suggesting is that jagex couldn't change someones vote because a 3rd party client could pick up on that.
---
 and if they instead added completely fake votes to rig a poll that would be incredibly obvious
---
Nah these people are iconic, wouldn't be osrs without them
---
Just because someone wouldn’t vote in a current skill doesn’t mean that we should vote in a shit skill. That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard
---
deal
---
The process of making Elemental gear, is unique to the Elemental ore discovered in the single location near Seers. It is bound with Elemental energy (Air water earth fire, long ago - the four....) and later as the material science progressed bound with conscious energy (Think mind rune).
---
While on the surface these two look very similar, personally with how Warding is presented i don't see it. 
---
First and foremost components for Warding come from dissolving an already "End of process" item - that is the item sink aspect - think of a steel platebody, 2 Coal 1 Iron ore mined from a "natural" resource (x5), to then be smithed and shaped into the platebody. Warding asks you destroy this "End of process" item to provide the necessary ingredients for the start of another cyclical process. 
---
Elemental gear is: 1 acquire natural resource, 2 process resource, 3 receive end product. (This is fundamentally and thematically the same as most skills with some minor exceptions)
---
Warding gear is: 1 acquire non-natural already refined product, 2 destroy said product for components, 3 process resource by finding appropriate ward, 4 receive end product. 
---
It's a small change - but it fundamentally goes against other skills thematically which is why i don't believe Warding fits well into OSRS. Let alone EW3, which would honestly be a slap in the face to the quest series given the above example and how it follows traditional skill examples.
---
Do you actually believe over 75% of people will vote yes?
---
lmao then practically all skilling in this game is afk since its almost all point and click....
---
Any opinion is common if you're actively looking for it.
---
The community voted against hiding poll results though
---
Why is this unpopular? This is just a suggestion, don't phrase it like its some type of outlier idea.
---
You need to add it to all of them wtf
---
You have never run out of things to do in OSRS.
---
Ironman btw

Not needing to carry the staff is a big benefit and one of the better rewards across all the elite diaries. It would be an extreme QoL change to be made available to everyone. Lumby elite was the first elite i got because i wanted the reward.

I did vote, and it was good... though the last question asked me what kind of dream skill would I want in the game... I wrote I'm all for surprises and didn't have anything specific just anything to enhance the game further...   
---
But now that I think about it, as a music person, and something outside the box of practical skills, "Barding" would be interesting. This is kind of climbing out of that music skill in the Sims where they progressively play better the higher their skill level, but Music could provide temporary boosts to other skills like prayer does. As well as give people a co-operative skill aside from combat.

I mean it's in the lore of the Fremenicks, and you even use a lire to teleport there.

sure, you are right that they have not answered a lot of questions and people nowadays take more details into account (economic benefits etc. people liked the idea of cool pets with summoning and at the beginning, people/kids did not understand how it will warp the meta)
---
I hope they will clarify things before the final poll.
---
fine, but it's not that hard to run out of new things you want to do
---
Fuck you for combining two of my favorite things! :D
---
It's the mage corner of the armour triangle, that's a well defined identity. It's meant to be as different from Crafting as Smithing is. Its function isn't purely unique because it doesn't have to be.
---
Your entire argument seems to revolve around the fact that these functions could be put into different skills. The whole point is to take some of the skill bloat and put them into a new skill so that you actually need to work towards something rather than have it as a byproduct of whatever else you're working on. Smithing and Crafting are separate skills from Defense and Ranging, putting robes into Magic doesn't fit the game's design.  If I'm casting fire strike on dragons for six hours does it really make sense that my character learned how to make bloodbark armour as a result? 
---
If our characters are going to make magic armour they do need magic smithing, otherwise the combat triangle and their artisan counterparts is imbalanced.
---
Yep, its a HUGE time investment but its super rewarding and allows your stats to be absurdly low for your combat level. I can have 99 str, ranged, and mage with 60 attack AN. Smite at 60 combat. Think about the general amount of hp people around that combat level have. Effectively, the gmaul nerf is the best thing that couldve happened to me because now that combat range is going to have to risk Hundreds of k on average instead of like 50k total thanks to gmauls op’ness. Also i would be looting on my main. Also the max hit i can possibly do is a 34/34 with a dds and that is assuming i can SOMWHOW get a Zerker ring(which requires alot of help from alot of other people so idk how realistic it is)
---
It is absurd that jmods think it would be so hard to add content to a skill that they would rather add a new skill with the content instead
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of these people never even played back in the day, but are using the old school idea as a way to boost their elitist ego.
---
I think this makes sense. If warding fails it's not like the mods will scrap every single proposal under it; they'll get reworked and repolled with other content. Vote for what you like so the JMods know which ideas are still worth pursuing.
---
Amsterdam?
---
Damn 3 weeks worth of runecrafting not too bad.
---
Isn’t account sharing within the rules now?
---
Pretty sure Torv uses a number of people’s accounts on his videos. I thought sharing was no longer against rules
---
he's the burger lord
---
everyone should get 1. he already got his 1 and did a 2.
---
Legit question. Is it not? Why did i think it was?
---
That's a fair point, but I'd still argue that you should cut warding the same slack. This is a good way to revolutionize the way we do other skills. Just like how slayer made combat skills more interesting, warding would make magic, rune crafting, and potentially other skills have more flavor and purpose to them.
---
 In addition, slayer was very bare minimum upon release, similar to how Warding is now according to the poll. There have since been tons of updates added to slayer making it the skill that everyone loves today. I'd argue that warding could go down this same path given the diversity the skill seems to possess at the moment.
---
Like you said crafting already covers creating the base robes.  Runecrafting could easily absorb the de-compiling and imbuing aspect of warding and still keep everything thematic. 
---
Nothing about warding will capture new player interest. It looks good with rose tinted glasses because we are used to the existing grind but for new players that is off-putting. 
---
Just because the team chose this skill and has hung on for dear life to shape it doesn't automatically justify a yes vote for it. The only reason warding was brought to the table was because of the player feedback survey. The team themselves chose warding as the new skill concept instead of working with the community to see what type of skill they would like to see brought into the game. Yes they are working with the community now to shape it into something we would want but like you said this is only to justify the effort they put in after their initially poorly thought out concept was presented and received overwhelming community backlash. 
---
At the end of they day this is simply my personal opinion as a veteran player who would like to see the game continue to thrive and not just have skills implemented for the sake of implementing new skills. Runescape needs to adapt and break out of this mindset of every skill needs to be some boring grind. There is no reason new skills cant be different and engaging. Newer players don't have the rose tinted glasses we all have where we are all used to the stale grind. Modern gamers want engaging content not boring repetitive grinds. Sailing and dungeoneering were simply examples i was using to convey a point. A new type of skill that encourages the use of other skills and encourages changing environments not simply bank standing and afk grinding.
---
Honestly I just don't like the idea of the content I don't want just another buyable skill I think the game has too many would much rather the features be added to current in game skills to fill gaps add the armour to crafting and magic why does it need a whole new skill when it can be logically be fitted into current skills really nicely and bring new life to them.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣hoooot garbage.. If you rap I hope you have good friends that tell you that you are trash at it and not lie and make you feel good about it.. Cause boy.. You def not makin ya momma proud with thia shit
---
If you think crafting is useless try playing ironman for a different perspective. The whole skill is filled to the brim with exceptionally useful upgrades, some of which are best in slot and when you finally max it out you get the most useful skillcape in the game. Crafting doesn't need anything else for a while. Adding content to runecrafting is taboo and magic already has more utility than any other skill. Warding will fit in just fine.
---
I just don’t post my osrs names online but I appreciate you clearing up my confusion and apologize again for the mistake.
---
Just look through all past votes, new content almost always passes. Unless it's either ugly, removes/impedes current playstyles, MTXslippyerslope.
---
This is a new skill that fills a hole in the current combatcrafting trifecta. It doesn't mess with balance, fits in the game, has no MTX hints, and really only hurts already maxed players who would stand to lose something.
---
I recommend doing highest trees and fruit trees you can. Celastrius in guild when you can. Typically it is not worth it to protect trees like magics/dfruit unless you have extra coconuts laying around, as with ultracompost you are at a 1/10 chance for it to fail iirc. Most of this stuff is available online. If you're maxing xp it'll be expensive and you can offset this by herb runs as much as possible. Use a herb seed Calc to get a general idea of avg profit, aka what seed can max your gains gp wise. This will be less xp but help with money in regards to farming. Try to do two tree runs a day, with one of them being fruit trees. Utilize calquat when possible, these take a little less than 24 hrs to grow.
---
Finally, do watermelons over Snape grass. Snape seeds are far more expensive than watermelon for not even double the xp. If you're doing herb or have the cash to throw at Snape seeds, go for it, but since the majority of your xp is coming from trees, you can save more by doing this anyways. Use bush patches if you really wanna max, and cactus as well. Typically I only hit those in the farm guild cause they aren't too far out of the way.
---
&gt; Losing long term veterans like him is bad for game health.

.
---
&gt;Botting is bad for game health.
---
True as that is, a mute for begging would be reasonable imo
---
Getting pk’ed by brainlets. They come in all different genders, it’s 2019
---
Yeah, actually tiered vis sounds like a better way of going about it than tiered silk, though the silk is pretty flavorful. Tiered vis would also make dismantling higher tier items like boss drops more worthwhile instead just dismantling more lower level drops for the same type of vis... 
---
Honestly, I really liked the tiered silk, but tiered vis seems better. I guess it's gonna have to be waiting the details of how vis/dismantling will work now
---
"what if people start saying "NO TO ALL NEW BOSSES, THIS IS OLDSCHOOL, GO PLAY RS3"
---
They already said they won't do any new raids for quite a while
---
minigames are dead content"
---
None of this had anything to do with his argument.
---
I mean I wouldn’t say unused but it’s like 50%of the entire map and probably has like 10% of the game’s content if we’re being generous. There’s still a ton of empty dead space and unnecessarily huge things in zeah.
---
To be fair though on release it was a huge blunder, now it’s a lot better but still needs some love.
---
Yea but botting is a major first offense. Autoclicking is minor and you will get the 2 day ban or whatever first then a perma. Pretty sure you just get permad if you bot straight up tho
---
&gt; craft runes with without paying 100% or near 100% attention
---
zmi and bloods exist
---
just try learning about the game before making crazy statements like that
---
How I'd feel? If I was botting, I earned it. 
---
Fuck off.
---
Warding will give me cancer.

#voteno
---
Yeah, one less time. Which means it’s auto’ing clicks
---
Knight's Sword for smithing xp
---
Firemaking, cooking, woodcutting, and fishing are fast and afk.
---
Wood cutting and firemaking are fastest at low levels
---
I use runelite, yes. IMO the vast majority of it should not be a part of the game. Farming timers are *explicitly disallowed* and have been for years, that's why osbuddy removed them in like 2016 or 2017. But runelite throws one in and voila, no problem. 
---
I have a very hardline stance on 3rd party clients and you are definitely not gonna convince me they are fair lol, full disclosure.
---
Valid points \^ I see where your coming from and I agree with most of what you say. I do believe it has potential but it still needs to be more refined at this point for me personally. Maybe a year or two it'll be ready to go.
---
Train all your right column skills up to 40. That will do it easily. If you find one of those skills easier then train that one
---
The fact that it's too hard for noobs to train rc might say something
---
I do think they should at least make some skills actually usable and have a purpose in the game first before adding new ones. That’s just me though
---
I'd be much more concerned about the dice bots and phishers. This is a non-issue.
---
This or do a 109 med lvl. 75 atk 75 def 77 pray 99 rest combat stats.
---
Its a main acc with the lowest effective cb lvl to pk.
---
The the bracket to pk is fairly large
---
not when the script author is retarded and lets it bug out
---
B
---
Sorry but is this a serious question?
---
Get the levels that you can to make a total of 500. Start with Firemaking and Woodcutting?
---
I used to think that too lmao
---
My friends little brother alched to 99 magic by rigging a small desk fan to hit his left click button while he slept!
---
It's very old school. I admire them for that. But really that's my issue with it. I don't want another skill I feel like I need to grind. I want a skill I'm excited to grind. If only sailing passed.
---
I'd just train a bit of everything, and train a bit more of whatever you enjoy most. Your levels are low enough that everything is more or less equally efficient.
---
Yeah, belt those out then hit some mining and smithing should round you enough lvls
---
60 smithing through smelting iron? That's gonna take years. Just get 30 to be able to make steel bars at blast furnace and you're golden.
---
This is what I want anyways. All this proposed stuff is easily incorporated into existing skills.
---
C, The answer is always C.
---
I'm not here to feed a troll but you do need help sweetheart, take care
---
Stick to training combat. Fastest xp rates since you’re highest level in them. Fight cows or chicken since they’ll have the lowest defense and you’ll hit the most often. Train only strength to increase max hits. Once strength is 99 train attack. If you still need levels after 99 attack go to defense.
---
But like... What do you define as a reskin?
---
Mining could be a reskin of woodcutting which is a reskin of fishing? They're all clicking on a natural resource to gather it.
---
Fletching is a reskin of crafting which is a reskin of smiting? They're all combining 2 or more resources together into a more useful one, either standing in a bank or at an anvil.
---
More of a stretch but you could argue hunter is a reskin of thieving which is interacting with NPCs in a non combat way to gain resources.
---
Is slayer a reskin of combat training because its interacting with enemies in a combat oriented way?
---
While I definitely agree that sailing and even artisan were more impactful for the game and obviously I'm being a bit facetious here, but lots of the skills could already be considered reskins in your literal clicking interactions with the game, but I don't think that's a reason to dismiss warding right out of the gate
---
If you're an ironmeme, who cares? The game shouldn't be tailored to ironmemes. Go stand alone or something. If you want specific runes, go craft them.
---
If I'm not mistaken there's the option to run to pre-existing wards instead of drawing your own, which gives better XP. So it's an optional bankstanding skill.
---
If you home tele then walk 3 steps west followed by 5 steps south you will be on the Figurolitto tile. If you dig on that tile you will be sent to an alternate osrs dimension where farming is 1.5x exp but gives you spades instead of herbs and cheese instead of wood.
---
We're not in tarkov anymore
---
he said they could make new bosses, raids or minigames
---
If you look at the state of minigames, they're all dead, so I doubt they want to make more of those. They came out after ToB to state they wouldn't make raids 3 for quite a while &amp; my argument of bosses is an extension of what some people think about skills
---
If sailing were polled today I would vote for it.
---
Thieving is the most shit skill in game imo. The hate that runecrafting gets will make no sense to me when thieving is a skill. With runecrafting the grind to 77 can be annoying but after, you have one of the best afk money makers in the game. Thieving on the other hand requires constant attention and to get to 90 it's a fucking big pain in the ass. In conclusion thieving bad, runecrafting good.
---
Sorry, I misinterpreted your previous post. I actually meant my post as an agreement and expansion on what I thought the intent of your post was. &lt;3

i mean u can't really afk sara as she changes targets every 3 attacks

4.5m for a negligible DPS increase unless you're using dragon bolts

Btw with not-so-bis gear :(

Question- is it allowed if I had a friend complete a quest for me, that I cant manage?
---
I don't see how using a built in function of Windows can be seen as botting when all his clicks are his own.
---
This is me while doing farm runs

Why not add summoning? Not against Warding it looks very cool, legitimately curious
---
You sound upset

Bubbles is stunting, just kicking him like that

Thank you dude! I might put a cheeky plug in the comments! (:

No a buyable is literally a skill that is purchased like con, nobody makes money from that and it’s boring af to train.  Everyone wants this skill until they actually have to train it.

Oh I don't think so

No, boring as heck, didn't fit, and is something that most people would've voted no for.

Not at all, watch it closely. I'm withdrawing 14 by double clicking and then banking 12 as i exit the interface!

While we are talking about that, how come everyone is ok with the puzzle solver integrated into runelite?
---
People always claim that it’s just qol, but how the fk can it be when it literally tells you where to click to solve a puzzle. The one thing that actually requires a little bit of skill in the game (the puzzle boxes) are basically being exploited by the runelite users. 
---
Huge integrity issue yet no one seems to care.
---
we voted NO to hidden poll results...
---
General game fixes should be normal updates, not hidden behind a skill.
---
Engine work
---
You can ***what***

If items are more expensive, it incentives killing certain monsters and doing variety content vs just gp/hr
---
No, Im saying thats what the pvm gods point was when he posted his appeal to reddit...
---
I don't. Let's not mess up again by ruining a beauitful game..
---
The method used by OSBuddy prior to them removing their plugin was significantly different to what's used by clients now.
---
Jagex changed the way that the farming state was stored in order to inhibit the client's plugin. It was using local variables to monitor the growth state for each of the patches. This could be done regardless of how far away from the patch you're standing. That is absolutely an unfair advantage.
---
The method currently used by clients now isn't far off what's achievable by setting a timer on your phone.
---
He doesn't say that on most of the comments though
---
I haven’t had this issue, but I mostly play on my Windows PC. The only issue I have with my MacBook Pro, which I recently updated to Mojave, is that the computer runs really hot and the AC adapter gets so hot you can’t even hold it.
---
We haven't seen any "recent" skill additions since 2007, but you're right RS2 was awesome because of the skills that came with it. As of 2013, OSRS hasn't seen a "new" skill in 6 years, we've seen plenty of new dungeons, high level bosses, high level quests, balanced gear upgrades, and an entire new continent of places to explore and skill on... but no new skills...
---
I was agreeing with you.
---
Swampman good
---
Official client bad
---
There are other factors here:
---
Adds item sink - great for longevity
---
Should make mage more viable in many mid tier situations (especially with the armor that increases casting by a tick)
---
Gives hunter (a gathering skill) an actual purpose.
---
Its not meant to be a game changing skill like Summoning or Dungeoneering, its just supposed to fill a large gap in the combat triangle.
---
 B fo show
---
Adding a new skill is not the same as overhauling the entire combat system, doofus.
---
Did my first ever beginner clue and got a jester cape from it, so now I do them all for those sweet steel plateskirts and bread loaves!
---
It completely reversed item inflation for RS3 from what I hear.

I promise I'm really just curious, and really am not trying to start an argument.
---
Is there something specific that you do not like about introducing warding that keeps you from wanting it in the game? I just want to see a POV from somebody on your side.
---
I dont see why. It's a good item sink
---
I don't like warding but will probably vote yes for this reason.
---
Does ketchup count as tomato jelly?
---
No need to be a dick
---
His point is if you vote no to the ass fuck but yes to the lube, you'll get given the lube later on to help with anything else you wanna use it for.
---
Ahk use is rampant in pvp worlds atm. Its bad
---
&gt;Nobody makes money from con
---
People this disconnected from the game shouldn't be allowed to participate in the polls. He genuinely thinks that items are freshly spawned whenever he buys planks, gold leaves, etc. and that the items don't come from other players selling them for profit.
---
Everyone does number 5, but never admits to it.
---
\&gt;Why do you disagree with new skills?
---
I dont. I disagree with Warding.
---
\&gt;Can you make an argument against warding that wouldn't apply to slayer?
---
I have done so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cdtkrk/why_dont_people_want_warding/etx0s3c/?context=3).
---
Id say you need to learn how to properly budget and manage finances.  Even with the info you gave (Which is likely lower than reality) a budget would stretch really far for you.   Every Dollar app is a solid place to start if youre really bad with this stuff.

Just to clarify this typically only happens when I play OSRS

---
Depends on the quest really, I'd err to the side of caution and would probably say no. Especially with the quests like RFD bosses for barrows gloves, ds2 or mm2. Quests kinda fall under accomplishments especially when you factor in quest cape.
---
Runecrafting could use it. Its an extremely one dimensional skillin its current state; as long as it didn't increase xp rates, it would fit just fine as a runecrafting expansion. Rs3 used runecrafting requirements for making higher tier mage gear like seasingers and I always thought it made perfect sense.
---
Im fine with a new skill, but a new skill that would fit just fine within currently existing skills just seems redundant.
---

Just watch streamers of pk videos, more helpful than a guide I'd say
---
Tell me this: what other piece of content has had its blog changed and updated before a poll as frequently as Warding? Its been almost a year since they announced the skill, and everytime there has been negative feedback, they address those concerns. 
---
Why does Warding get a year's worth of planning and blog changes, while other proposed skills in the past have just gotten a quick poll?
---
AFK in the sense that you don't have to pay attention.
---
TRU
---
Thank you!
---
Don't really see how the G.E ruined new player retention. Nowadays I think newer players would be turned off having to sit around for hours trying to buy items instead of just using the G.E. It's also a hub for most players, and more often than not you'll find people asking for advice (or begging). Lumbridge has always been a newbie area, the whole point is to introduce new players to the basics and have them venture off and explore. For this reason it only offers the basics of resource gathering. 
---
There was a reason people 75% voted for the G.E, even die hard nostalgia driven players. Player trading was a massive gimmick, and people eventually realised that. Yeah, you'd get to know people and make friends through trading, but it became a massive time sink for most people who just wanted to play the game. A lot of people had alts just to trade for this reason. Scamming was rampant and I mean RAMPANT. It's frustrating trying to sell things and for it to take hours before you've been offered a legitimate price for your items. 
---
I do agree with the economy manipulation though, it's easier than ever to bulk buy items if they've been hinted at receiving a buff or change that will jack the price up. Plenty of people just watch the developer streams for this sole reason. 
---
Botters actually keep the prices of certain resources stable. It's sort of a 'necessary' evil. Just watch the prices of certain items after a bot ban-wave. Botters also have other bots that will sell stuff regardless of if there is a G.E or not, just take a look at old clips of people luring trade bots into the varrock wizards and getting them killed for bank (back when you actually lost shit on death).
---
Practice on an account with some defense. Pures are very hard because kO potential is high.
---
bots won't do *everything* for you, but can be set to do repeating tasks. Most of them are safe skilling tasks like mining, woodcutting, fishing, etc. There are some more complex bots that can complete less than safe things like slayer tasks. Then you have custom coded bots that are generally not available to the public that can do things like questing.
---
I mean, I see where you’re coming from. But botting is botting either way. I think botting for pk stats is just as dirtbag as botting for rank.
---
The worst quest in the game is darkness of hallowvale
---
Eh I love babby and have been watching since the tossed salads and scrambled eggs days but I think he is much better when he can control the editing rather than live. I love the idea of being with babish but he's not great off the cuff so not sure how it'll be on hot ones. But I love both the shows!
---
I went there and tanked in full justicar and bulwark with 2 range dps with t bows and absolutely shreaded sara way more money than bandos and easy af
---
Can't tell if troll or handicapped
---
Because if u are pvming with scythe and tbow and you get hacked u lose it, bankpin doesnt do shit that way which is ridiculous
---
No, those skills are also bad. But if we're going to add a new skill then shouldn't we have higher expectations?
---
the fact it happened over the weekend seems very fitting to me, having followed his twitter adventures for a while now (he blocked me after my comment on the other post where i half defended him lol)
---
seems fitting someone like him would think he can just turn bot on during the weekend and turn it off on monday
---
''but it was only 5 hours!!''
---
I need this I’ve been empty since 99 slayer
---
Maybe unpopular opinion, but the people that sink endless hours into the game and achieve everything there is to achieve in osrs *probably* know more about what’s best for the game than all the obby cape units that are making fun of them lol
---
He stole a post from a guy who has cancer...
---
yah you can with a bulwark she only switches her target if u run u can stand at her with a bulwark np
---
we just understand this game has no chance of entertaining you without gp to jump start you
---
People genuinely think hidden results means that they're being rigged, yes. There is no evidence though.
---
And they've had 15 more years of farming the same items
---
His family be beefing my mining game
---
200m Slayer is waiting for you.
---
Recently moved to China, ping aint ideal let me tell you. Worse still is getting Jagex to accept my money without rejecting the payment because of my location/vpn
---
Not useful for anything you have equiped. Pvm with a scythe tbow get hacked bankpin doesnt do shit. We need bankpin on login (optional)
---
Runescape, at the core, has very little hand holding and guidance.  Someone who is trying to give this game a chance will get to Tutorial Island and will be instructed on how to perform every action to get to the next challenge.
---
Once a player finished Tutorial Island, they are dropped off in Lumbridge.  At this point, the player is given very little direction and is left to their own devices.
---
A lot of people I know, include myself, found the player interaction to be what got us REALLY into the game.  Any updates which limit player interaction are impacting one of the great aspects of the game.  
---
Lumbridge used to have a lot of people in it.  Not just newbies, but mid/high level players.  
---
Why is that?
---
* The city itself was just as useful as every other F2P city
---
   * Lots of quests start here
---
   * Access to various resources and skilling spots
---
* The only free teleport used to be the Home teleport
---
So what went wrong?
---
* Free teleports now include Minigames, Edgeville, etc.
---
* Varrock was given a HUGE boost in utility in proportion to other F2P cities
---
   * Why would anyone go literally anywhere else when the central trading hub is confined to Varrock?
---
Same for me, I think it took them a week but they unbanned me and regave me the account pretty fast. Got botted for like 15k zulrah kills lol.
---
Fair enough.
---
Fishing is just something I do while playing another game. I consider that zero time, but I can understand that everyone is different.
---
This.
---
and the main issue here hasn't been core mechanics. 
---
First blog at runefest announcement was theres not enough here voting no. Jagex says give us help then and people gave back and forth info.
---
Blog 2 comes out. reee warding let it die its not slayer 2 or sailing. But also still not enough to justify a skill. Jagex ok thanks will try something else
---
Blog 3. Reeeee summoning. Op armors devaluing stuff. Put it all in rune crafting and regular crafting. also too confusing. Jagex Ok well fix it
---
blog 4. 1 minigame 4 quests no summoning op armors removed dabbles in rune crafting to have some xp go to rune crafting, explains how the skill actually functions and its process.  community responds reeeeeeeeee stop pushing warding.
---
Togglescape reeee
---
That’s what Bubblebass (the big fat fish) says in the show for his order lol
---
Soldier front and drift city were fun as well
---
In 2 trips, ~15 kills, of using iron darts because I forgot to switch after Kraken, she never healed, and I was getting ~1:45.  I put dragon darts in for the rest of the task, continued to get ~1:45, and she healed a few times over about 100 kills.
---
The reason that was the case is because there was no good magic equivalent. Like, imbuing  boots to upgraded versions is part of runecraft and magic. Does that really make sense?
---
Any type of magically-created armor will be chucked into a hodgepodge of skills. It makes much more sense to solidify that idea into its separate skill.
---
You bring 4 doses???
---
Do a few raids whenever u can
---
I disagree with the logic of "it's OSRRS, it should stay OSRS" because to me, Oldschool is basically just an undoing of RS3's mistake; not a freeze frame of that time period.
---
That said, I'm against the new skill because I feel there are so many problems in this game that go overlooked. Like Skull Tricking for example which kills PVP for me. Until they focus on fixing problems in the game I'm not enthusiastic about adding even more content to manage.
---
Extended super anti or what pot??
---
when you complete all the rotations, it will go back to the very beginning which will always be the green range zulrah. It doesn't attack you when you first start zulrah, but if rotations reset it will attack you. Could that be why you think it skips a phase?
---
15k and I'm yours (am a guy in irl though)
---
This guys actually an idiot. If he botted it’s hardly 5 years of hard work. More like 5 years of on/off playing with help from a bot.
---
unpopular opinion btw
---
I'm practicing on LMS
---
Yes.
---
It works remarkably well. 
---
Its 99.9 % effective versus the 75% effective rates of condoms.

---
Weeeeeef vs frazwah
---
I picked yours, great job!
---
its really hard to make something feel like its always been a part of the game. Zeah, Nmz, Catacombs do not feel like this at all. But if you go and look at the document on the twitter page they have 4 quests planned to tie warding into the game
---
I legitimately simply prefer for RuneScape to not have warding and people need to understand that
---
Is the warding poll in game live now?
---
i should've specified the nerf just after achievement diary update (2015 iirc) when they were actually busted af, lasted 1 week if i'm not wrong
---
Nice weefer today
---
So we can conclude that lore doesnt matter then. And your E-penis is more important than being consistent about the world and its lore
---
go for it then
---
Honestly does not sound like that bad of an idea.
---
I trade new people spades and tell them to always keep it in the bank
---
I will vote for A, looks really good and fit to starting screen
---
He kept repeatedly moving in the same pattern. It could have been made on a bot client sure but it was static coordinates being clicked indefinitely.
---
I’m guessing your voting yes just because it’s a new skill. Go get 2k total then will talk
---
I’ve already lost the nostalgic feeling from the game. It doesn’t feel like the game I played when I was 7-10 it feels like eh game I’ve been playing for longer than the original. It’s just a game I play now.
---
&gt;Thats why threads end up in huge circlejerks where only the right opinion (which in the eyes of reddit is a progressive opinion) is correct to hold. 
---
Case in point that drakepost on the hot page right now calling people "elitist neckbeards" for wanting the game to stay as close to  their preferred era and are worried that history will repeat itself.
---
That's some "probably browses /r/gatekeeping daily" levels of toxic selfish hypocrisy.
---
When they want the game to change to fit *their* specific vision, it's okay because their preferences are the correct ones, but if other people like it how it already is, that's because they're toxic manbaby neckbeard incels who're just angry because they probably live in their mother's basement and never get laid so they don't want anyone else to have fun, either.
---
So another daily?
---
[Hiya buddy!](https://i.redd.it/h11tn6xguzcx.jpg)
---
Ah yes that makes sense thanks!
---
Well, a full on bot script will play the game for in automation. Macros can be used to make certain actions quicker (like being able to do stuff that usually requires multiple clicks in one click).
---
I think the Grand Exchange is one of those examples where the juice isn't worth the squeeze.
---
A better idea might have been to rework the Trading Post, which is something that could have been available in every bank.
---
it’s not a scam when they are not making any promises to do anything in return. Would you give your change to a guy begging on the street in a Gucci suit?
---
&gt;The game is already different than it was on launch.
---
I know, but people can try to preserve the game as much as they can. A lot of players don't really like the idea of OSRS being a game showing "what RuneScape 3 could've been".
---
Staying true to it's roots only gets more and more difficult when Jagex starts implementing things like new skills and cosmetic awards from promotions.
---
&gt; Play on a private server
---
No, get used to the democracy.
---
What if the pauldron and greaves were enchanted bark?
---
Personally I never thought it made sense as a skill, but I see it mentioned on this subreddit semi-often.
---
Smells like ammonia
---
I can do 5K, a set of mithril armor (skirt of course), and a Ruby ring
---
I think people are just gun-shy about updates after Jagex massacred what is now rs3 and left their players (now osrs players) feeling like runescape was dead. It’s an understandable reaction from the community in my opinion
---
How, exactly? I mean, it literally is the game you played 10+ years ago, expanded. To me a lot of what's been added seems like natural progression of the game. Anything I'd call a 'core' mechanic from 2007 is still unchanged.
---
That's actually really cool, this is way closer to the aesthetic of the og login screen than what I've got. It's unfortunate you didn't get it to the level you wanted it to be, but hey, making something is better than making nothing.
---
Farming timers can and always could have been achieved with a timer on your phone. Like I said, the exact methodology is unimportant. The end result is a client telling you when your plants are ready and jagex saying no, don't do that.
---
Extended super anti and o think superantivenom is what they are. 
---
I bring 4 of all. Could just bring 3 of the antifire but it’s whatever. Would just replace 1 dose with a dhide most times.
---
Might not get banned but it definitely will be detected and flagged as scripts/botting.
---
If it's not natural mouse movement/ touch screen movement, it's going to be flagged.  There is no debate here.
---
Why do they even call it 07Scape anymore.
---
It has way more shit added to it than Runescape in 2007. Some of it improves the game (like QOL menus and shortcuts, and some of it ruins the game (like ridiculously OP ranged weapons available to use as early as level 60.)
---
is it that bad lol
---
The fact you are voting no means you've become part of the hive mind and are not actually voting on what you do or do not want to be added for updates.
---
I don't even know what these are TBH.
---
tell ya what m8
---
Of course not, and I hope nobody gives players like that money. I will stand by that it is a scam as they are trying to get less knowledgeable people to give them money.
---
Hard agree. Puzzle solvers are fucked.
---
I've done it tanked for friends pet hunting sat there in justiciar and a bulwark barely even needed to brew just had to smack her first
---

Still fantastic though, good job!

Yes, very much so.
---
how about a third option being: NEITHER GG NO RE
---
A macro is something that records and repeat a process like clicking, moving the mouse pointer, keyboard input, etc. Example you could set a macros to click high alch, move to an item in your inventory, click the item to perform the alch, move mouse back to high alch and repeat. You could use this for a number of things and have it on a hot key for banking items faster, gearing up, etc. 
---
A bot is a complete script that you would use via a botting client that is packed with scripts for pretty much every game function. The key difference is that a bot can read the games system output codes to that it can react to different situations like random events, player interactions, etc. Its also capable of varrying movement and action types tp best mimic a player. 
---
To summarize, a bot is a smart too that has the capability of making its own decisions (within the limits of its code) where as a macros is a completely dumb script that repeats the exact same input.
---
Why would you want to? It's like asking what's the best way to get into cigarettes.
---
Makes sense, I’ve seen so many guides and didn’t hear anything about it. Good to know I was going insane, thanks!
---
Runespan was a bandaid solution to rc that devalued the skill. I'm not suggesting that.
---
Rs3 made a good update where they made rcing in the wilderness high risk but increased the XP. You had an item that skulled the user and when u got killed dropped 500k. The item itself costs 1m or something so money actually left the game. It was a really good system.
---
Things like that to help break up rcing in the early levels is what we need. At the moment, rc has probably two other methods to train it.
---
Invention ruined rs3 by saving the economy?
---
I made 2.5 min in one hour soloing revs with a blowpipe this morning.  I didn't die once.  If you do die, you only risk like 130k with the proper setup.  For best results, you should do it when the playercounts are low.
---
I too wish we still had compromise the game-&gt;life barrier by going to a thirdparty website rife with degenerates admins, mishandled data, and god knows what else just to facilitate something as fundamental as trading.

Yeah this post sums it up for me. I would like a new skill and Warding isn't inherently terrible, but I don't trust the current iteration of Jagex to get it 100% right.
---
I think the game would mostly be dead if they didn't introduce the GE
---
No one wants to spend hours in a super crowded w2 trying to sell their all their shit
---
This is exactly the point Im trying to make.... The other proposed skills didn't have this much effort put into it. They were just polled, and everyone moved on with their lives. My point is, this skill has gotten 4 entire blogs just because it is Mod West's passion project
---
Construction
---
I eat my burgers medium rare to medium. Never had anything wrong with me so far
---
Cant get pregnant is we don’t have sex boys
---
It's pretty good, I like it better than option C or D but B still gets my vote.
---
Nope i did it a couple months ago to get the boosts for a diary.
---
Ok should be doable like 8h for 2weeks of membership
---
10% decrease with cape.
---
25% chance of null with necklace.
---
Ha ha me drink alcohol LOL
---
&gt; If you're unable to grasp why the two methods are the same
---
But they aren't... good lord
---
Basically sold about 70 bonds?
---
This is fake the balloon didn't dodge the obstacles
---
You're not stuck, you can do underwater agility and pyramid plunder if you dislike ardy knights
---
As long as you have been thinking about it, what you like and dislike, how it fits in the game, whether or not it warrants the dev time, etc. Then whichever way you vote is fine. There aren't teams and there is no loser. We all want runescape to be the best it can be.
---
Iirc they said in the blog that they want to poll the core skill first, then poll more if it passes. They don’t want to spend unnecessary weeks of dev time for something that gets shot down.
---
You're absolutely right, jagex making major changes has never had a negative impact on the subscriber base in the past. What was I thinking.
---
It always bothered me when they'd directly punch his uncovered monkey brain, like holy hell these girls are giving him an ass whooping
---
I want to believe but I get the feeling at least 26% of the player base will vote no on a new skill no matter how much work is done on it.
---
Cute, I am sure your mom will understand
---
I read enough of the skill to not be interested in the mid tier rewards they are offering. The best one was the essence pouch which requires 85 rc to even use. Which at that point you dont really use pouches  it any more and move on to arceus rc. Not to mention 27 essence doesnt work if you're at normal altars because one spot gets used up for runes lol.
---
If that's the best the skill has to offer I'm not interested.
---
It's also going to be dead content for a year until they catch up diary and quest requirements. And that's If they even make a new diary. Gonna be weird seeing people with diary cape and 1 warding. Lol.
---
But everyone has their own opinion. I think a minigame that can be an item sink will win out over a new skill. Look at all the new guilds and minigames and quests coming out. We dont need a new skill with all the great content they're adding into the game. I'd rather see updates to old dead guilds before I see a new skill. But that's just my 2 cents.
---
I’m here and I’ve pmed you no reply yet lol
---
I wonder why....
---
I asked for a source you prick, thanks for taking the time to reply yet contributing nothing.
---
The fact that I now know it’s Serene makes it even worse.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
i dont think warding will pass but i will vote yes. I don't know if i even want warding or not, but i think its the right choice to vote it in. Warding is not going to ruin the game in any way. I have confidence in the oldschool team that even if warding is not up to par on release, they will work on making it a good skill.
---
I think they based the whole brainlet meme on you
---
Fuck you got me
---
&gt; Meh, Runescape in 2010 had it on a midlevel quest. 
---
Oh man, no way! How'd that go for rs3? I bet it's doing better than ever!
---
Are you against all updates then? It just seems like a thought process that leads to nothing.
---
Seems a bit selfish. Your goals are not all that matters lol
---
Soulja boy used to play runescape. Look it up
---
I’m voting no
---
Congratz! lot of people here are being snarky lol, just for reference here are some improvements you can make: Bgloves, drag defender, nezzy, infernal (fcape even?).
---
Bcp/tassies if you're 70+ def lol lose the torso
---
It was a different Jagex from a different time
---
BiS gear costs a lot? :O 
---
let’s add a new skill
---
With the desert easy diary &amp; "contact!" complete it's not bad since you can bank at Sophanem and sell your noted artifacts to that one dude by the agility pyramid. 
---
That said, it'd be cool if they could have similar rooms/minigame locations all across the game that feature that specific locale and different loot according to level. The idea of breaking in and stealing from dungeons/treasure rooms is more interesting than the meta of pickpocketing.
---
Unlikely if you run it for reasonable periods of time.
---
Taking on the warriors guild basement rn for the defende
---
Banning 3rd party clients makes exactly 0 changes to the game as it was intended to be played.
---
all would have been solved if he bought a dinhs- wait no
---
Because suggesting any new content for this game is heresy to the '07 purists.
---
I remember that yeah was forever ago
---
Farming and bird house runs
---
It’s a joke not a Reddit post lol
---
HA
---
Because on Twitter are everybody who is downvoted on here
---
I think it's clear what he needs to do for 99 mining.
---
https://youtu.be/C-CjjcoTZ20?t=0m35s
---
Yup, the "other content is garbage so let's add more!" argument really isn't helping lol.
---
For me the main issue with Warding isn't that it doesn't fit, it's that I don't think it adds much of anything of value to the game.
---
&gt;and encouraging them to do stuff like buying gold or botting later on.
---
Sounds kinda made up tbh
---
I always judge an acc by RC/Agility/Mining, if any of those is lacking I consider the account garbage. 
---
You sir have a garbage account.
---
Would be perfect if it were a dandelion lol
---
I appreciate the art, but please draw something original. Every piece I’ve seen has been a tracing. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/NMvpFRN.jpg
---
Right, and bc it's just UI it's adding a new button and attaching the same function used for the current button to the new button. Maybe a littttle bit more effort if it was, say, a tab for each piece of jewelry and a button per tele but something like that can by dynamic so once it's done for one piece of jewelry you essentially have it for all
---
People would post the results to social media and people who check reddit/watch streams/yt videos could get influenced by that.
---
Nice attempt to sidestep what I was saying :)
---
Thank you! Appreciate it - was so fun to make (:
---
you could make it stop if you stopped posting about it
---
Why are buyables bad? I prefer buyables because they're typically the quickest to train.
---
B for sure
---
its simple. add al kharid guards to the gates. problem solved.

It’s just a parody, I have original art.

Or just one inv, some dhides, and a bulwark.

Only if you are a saradomin scum
---
paint was being annoying if i forgot to click on the canvas before changing the color it would fart up same reason why justicar is over 100m and theres a red vertical line on the bottom row
---
Back in the day my somewhere between 5-10 year old account that had been members the whole time and never had any offenses or trouble got banned for life unnappealable for macroing on the first offense.
---
I was using rsbot or something but I had HUNDREDS if not thousands of hours of legit playtime, had never been a scammer or caused issues. once second I'm level 114 the next I'm gone forever. 
---
Pretty fucking lame that they'd add this first offense option NOW. Should give me a chance to play my old character. I'd pay.
---
and the fact that the team was 5 mods at the time...
---
Ooooof. I didnt know that about the explorers ring but thank you so much for being the guinea pig
---
This doesn’t make any sense at all. You pile the monkeys by walking back and forth. Smoke is only worth using on Abby demons bcuz of the teleport. Stick to ice spells lol
---
it's also silly to vote yes to all new skills, correct
---
Vorkath question. In regular void and sub 90 defense, should I be using Bastion potions for the extra def levels, or just ranging?
---
Also I hope your RNJesus blesses me when I grind it out tonight..
---
&gt; It’s not funny anymore
---
I’m sorry but I chuckled lol. Good luck with the grind! :)
---
Yeah great you're really cool dude
---
yeah and you're an idiot, gl in life
---
Runelite is not associated with runescape,
---
Don't get hacked
---
I mean most people dont just use an autoswitcher all the time and its pretty rare as is.
---
People will use it during a fight to switch a few things and change prays and spec in the same tick, but its not like theyre using one the whole fight most of the time.
---
I rarely ever see people even do that as well, at least not in singles deep wildy pking. 
---
People arent not pvping for that reason.
---
course not, but they should still have valid reasons
---
I mean they could just add new magic gear without a new skill. (As well as fixing the alch value issue somehow)
---
Would you rather the hoards of utterly useless and worthless items remain utterly useless and worthless?
---
You could impliment an osrs version of them
---
The rouges outfit is a pretty good idea for theiving. A chance of double loot is a novel idea that adds to the skill. 
---
Maybe you could have an osrs version of safe cracking where there's a rare chance to get a item that upgrades a peice of your Rouges outfit. each upgrade gives you a higher chance of double (or maybe even triple, quad, depending on thieving lvl) pickpocketing the NPC and a lower chacnce of getting caught. 
---
Make the upgrades tradable so thieving has a viable way of making money, but have a mark of grace like currency system where you need to trade an npc a certain amount of loot to upgrade the Rouge outfit, just so you are still forced to take part in the content. 
---
This will make the Rouges outfit more of a use while also making a more afk and less click intensive version of normal thieving.
---
An osrs compromise of Rs3 mechanics
---
I doubt a flood of people will go and grind out 99 today lol. It won’t effect it much
---
Great video tedious. Truly epic last few scenes with the music, the 99 party, the emote + tele, all very good. I would love to give a Zeah Only a go sometime :)
---
in europe its very popular to have gas cars, every gas station has gas pumps here and some car makers make them gas from factorys like volvo.

I want summoning. Remove pack yack make war tort lvl 94 and remove steel titan. Problems solved. I actually enjoyed seeing charms on the ground. Made most monsters at least have some value
---
Upvoted this on two accounts, simply because this must have taken some time to make AND because its a nice overview of the current gear avaliable.
---
Thanks for posting!

Good luck getting that many d stones. Should be a fun wait in the GE.

I see reading isn't your strong point.

^^^^^^^got old a year ago

reading comprehension. get some

I don't want new bosses. In fact, I would vote in favor of removing some.
---
Slayer is an activity...
---
*bans*
---
10/10
---
You are right. Please vote no on as many accounts as possible or this game will go to shit
---
This is why so many shit suggestions get added to the game.
---
This looks really amazing, good job!
---
Hey guys check out my new series it's a new take on "an area locked IM" it's called "Actually Locked Ironman"
---
because every one needs help gettinginto 2k total worlds
---
it doesnt even outclass ahrims ffs, you need 80 warding to make gear that is worst then ahrims.....
---
What’s your setup if you don’t mind me asking!
---
Good point, but begging and pretending to be a "cute noob" is the new meta of scamming.
---
Do it, we'll probably get a tbow spawn somewhere
---
No matter what direction developers try to go with this it seems like the community is split right down the middle for it. 
---
Those who don't want it make arguments based on "FUN"
---
Those who do want it make arguments on the actual content provided and their playing styles. 
---
I say just vote to what you want specifically. If you don't want it then vote NO. 
---
If you do want it then vote YES. 
---
It's really that simple guys. No need to bash each other for the reasons why it should or shouldn't pass.
---
Omg so brave
---
Ooo, read from 500k
---
No one cares cock
---
Are they taking advantage of generous people? Yeah sure. But they aren't scamming anybody.
---
I get blue screens occasionally with runelite. Updating my graphics drivers usually does the trick.
---
Fucking laughed my ass off
---
My mom says I read at a 4th grade level doe.
---
Who says they need to create new accounts to change the results? 
---
They control what is displayed there. If they really wanted to rig a vote, they could display whatever result they want. 
---
I mean they wouldnt do it in real time, because people would notice changes made like that. They would just rig it from the begining.  
---
Point is if they really wanted to rig it, they could. But I doubt that is happening because most changes I have seen are widely supported.
---
No fkn shame
---
Hcuo btw
---
It doesn’t fit the game. It’s confusing, unnecessary and just another meaningless update to keep the shit tier of players busy for a month until they get bored of it and demand more new useless content
---
This post made 0 sense
---
Bots at shops would run even more rampant then they are now D:
---
Then neither does any other skill with that thought process? It’s to create better gear or gear to use...
---
Just got a jelly task. I'll try it out thanks
---
Why make already bloated skills even more bloated? Look at crafting for example, there is so much shit in that skill already.
---
How? What did he do?
---
They would halve xp that wasn't even related to what you were botting.
---
One user on RS3 that had 2.4b xp was caught botting, and was halved in every skill, ending up with 1.2b xp.
---
as someone who has played lots of games from their childhood, you probably would never recapture that feeling for long.
---
guess you better pull out moms credit card
---
Legit, A and D is similar,   
---
A high detail,
---
D low detail
---
gz
---
Isn't the same for literally every non combat? Other than quest/diary requirements, the only reason to train any of them is just for the level or because you enjoy training them.
---
41 pages of the blog kinda indicate that have a fairly good idea of how to implement it..
---
Nobody does that unless they're on an iron.
---
To be honest it’s expensive but if wanted to do dbones I would do them at the chaos altar. According to the wiki it’s better in the long run and especially if you  don’t keep a stack on you.
---
Ah dun wan et
---
I like working towards 99s but also enjoy doing barrows
---
that doesn't even make sense, the lvl 50 cement on a stick is better than the AGS
---
One thing I thought about was making superior variants of armors, bronze to rune at higher level smithing. They'd be made up of the same materials, but also a new higher tier mystical ore. Each superior variant would have similar stats to their regular counterpart, but have some unique Stat change that would warrant making them preferable over regular, not being better than the next step up, and a bit pricier.
---
For Priff, maybe Courage running through the Undergound Pass. :P
---
Bought enough bonds in game for 10 years or so worth of membership.
---
thats the problem jagex has, they don't flush out there ideas, they dont crowd source ideas, they dont ask for opinions on matters of balance until its far too late.
---
Development of anything takes a long time but jagex usually rushes it and fucks it up.
---
Seems like the work of propaganda artists'
---
Chambers is literally osrs version of dungeoneering lol
---
Probably got tired of being cyberbullied and made a new account
---
I would kill for high level thieving quests, culminating in a bank robbery.
---
Man this is trippy as shit, reminds me of F2P in an alternate reality :D
---
You all are bandwagoners. B looks like a rs3 login screen.
---
Can't relate
---
RS3 was done in by the combination of EoC and micro transactions.
---
Summoning was pretty good and dungeoneering was great imo. Divination could’ve been better but it was just the gathering skill side of invention.
---
The recent mining/smithing rework is also pretty good and OSRS could definitely afford to take a page or two out of it.
---
I think Warding can grow into a much better skill than it sounds though, especially considering all the things within it that will improve the game overall.
---
Status bars runelite plugin
---
Yeah I know that, I guess I just didn't realize that it was so weak that a 50% acc + 12.5% damage boost wouldn't make it busted lol
---
As a casual player, I like when others keep me informed.
---
So a new skill shouldn't ever be made?
---
I do. It's the very last skill I'll train, and I'm specifically completing every quest, diary and mini-quest I can (In addition to maxing every non-combat skill) before I even start it, so I can get 99 as quickly as possible. I'm close to 60 slayer now and I've completed 3 tasks, I think.
---
So? Then is all normal accounts do is quests and slayer? 
---
People enjoy the game in many ways other than slayer. Lots of skills can be used for money makers for example
---
Here for the furry JMOD smackdown
---
Lofi RuneScape radio — beats to relax/scape to
---
Cause training it will make u admit to a hospital ward obviously
---
If you're male and you play male character, that's big gay. You obviously just like to stare at dudes all day. 
---
/s
---
Which part?
---
Idk I had a script for ankous that would pick up loot and heal with guthans. Bots can do a lot for you
---
Anyway I wan to training with my inferno Cape wearing, I dont have alot of time to play now for get this 99 on 2 days or less, this will take long time to get 99, so many ppl same like me, play osrs like 3-4 hr a day.
---
why is a skill having a lot of content bad in your opinion?
---
I would literally kms
---
H
---
it's not a valid opinion because you don't judge the thing based on what it is, it's literally the same as saying "all black people are violent criminals and I never want any of them in my neighborhood" 
---
Would you say that's a valid opinion?
---
That’s literally the point he is making here, that construction wasn’t about max efficiency, but fun.
---
You need 85 fletching to make a bow thats worse then the one at level 80 stupid arguement.
---
Like i said a new skill isn't tailerd to end game content, you say the skill is fine yet your excuse for voting no is because of no BIS items obtained from it.
---
Like I said, predictable.
---
Raids are not Dungeoneering. Thanks.
---
I find them fun when I want to do something with high intensity, buts been a while since I felt like doing that
---
That happens with just about any action with the right camera angles
---
Didn't this already happen with the minigames reward shop?
---
Warding is also colloquially known as the term for defensive magics, ie the ones you place on the cloth to make you not die so easy.
---
Idk if you’re a troll or not. Those guys talking are literally the guys who created the game that you want kept the same? Are you joking honestly lol? Watch the video bro, vote however you want honestly I don’t personally care. But younger me alllllllways loved when they added new skills back in the day, and you better believe I’ll still like the new ones! :)
---
Ur head is a brick
---
That one was easy
---
I actually might try that, thanks.
---
too many normies in Runescape
---
Nice, retort to insulting me. Very progressive of you. 
---
Jagex has had numerous failures in the past. Even with betas involved (eg: EoC) The blog has many inconsistencies such as stating gp/xp rates involving items that have never been in the market yet. Hence, they’re pulling numbers out of their asses. 
---
Of course I’m going to be skeptical of this new skill which might I add, is not fun OR engaging in any form. Literally a crafting bankstanding buyable.
---
I stand by my statement, if you like a RuneScape with plenty of updates that introduced progression then RS3 is the game you should look into. They’ve had many great updates and skills I’m sure you’d like.
---
Lmfao any chance you could send the link my way? Dude has been doing it for so long it isn’t the same.
---
I really want a RuneScape Undertale mod overhaul now...
---
They are a minority. I consider myself pretty diehard and look forward to new skills and content. There is a minority of elitest trihards who dont want any of their time devalued so cling to saying everything is bad.
---
Nice try Jagex
---
opportunity cost, though.
---
Sell that loot and buy piety.
---
  I liked how you compared other universes to the one that we play in to form your basis, but I feel like in this situation it's comparing apples and oranges. 
---
  In those two worlds, magic is much rarer in general, there's no need to be creating magical armor on a grand scale because you aren't going to be battling against an army of wizards, but in Runescape everyone and their mother has the affinity to use magic. Noobs fresh off tut island can just start throwing spells at any thing they want, and while for the other combat skills those noobs can easily create armor for themselves for lower tiers, wouldn't it make sense for them to be able to do the same for magic?
---
  I know I got off topic but still the point stands that in our game world, magic isn't scarce like it is in those, someone litteraly left them on the floor in Lumbridge castle because it wasn't worth it to pick them back up to them. 
---
  I don't understand why you pointed out the runecrafting comparison about runes that you can't even use yet. To me, warding would be like a different type of magic, one that isn't channeled through runes. It's more like your home teleport spell that you channel through yourself/the energy from deconstruction of items, therefore it would make sense on how you'd be able to make armor you can't even use yet, because the training to make that armor follows a different type of magic, one that doesn't require proficiency on channeling energy through runes, and that make sense lore-wise to me.
---
I forget the exact quests, but if you do 5 certain ones that only have melee attacks, you can pray melee and AFK in Rumble. NMZ boosters were huge before the 20 minute combat timer. That would still work, you just need to click once every 20 mins, which you would do anyway to restore prayer.
---
Fuck being your kid that’s all I can say
---
Sounds like smithing, crafting  and fletching
---
Fun is a matter of person taste, but if traditional skilling isn't for you, there'll be a warding and runecraft mini-game as an alternative training method.
---
&gt;Go into a room of regular everyday gamers and say that you still play runescape, the look they give you
---
What
---
I guess I’m an asshole for not wanting another skill like smithing and crafting, two of the worst skills to train in game.
---
To be honest neither are a required upgrade at present, magic amulet provides same mage bonus as both so I guess I'll just see how it is going when I'm actually seriously looking at the upgrade for the defensive/prayer bonus as you said might get lucky on a hard before then
---
My tongue just gets all tied up haha, I have a condition that makes certain muscles move and when I get a little nervous my left cheek twitches and it just floods me with insecurity. Some people have way more problems than I do, I don’t think it’s fair I have to endure this (drugs didn’t do this to me, concussion). You’re the type of guy I want to sit down and just talk to. You’ve added a lot of positivity to my day. Baby steps, I’ll start cleaning for a few hours. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sacrificing your time to make someone a little brighter for a while :)) might hit the gym too breh
---
Gimme that body body
---
Why not do both?
---
the reason question, should warding come into the game would it affect you negatively? 
---
then look at it from the perspective, will it effect people positively?
---
85% of the reason I'm voting no would be considered silly by most people. But I'm so fucking against Infinity becoming a craftable item. I don't care if the silk comes into the game through Mage Training Arena. Attaching an exp value to Infinity robes could crash the set. Its alch price is low. So that 4m robe top could be crafted for very solid exp rates mid level, and the market is over-saturated with robe tops. People will pay top dollar for the silk, and just crash the armor because Infinity isn't even good.
---
Can this be an actual zone in game please lmao
---
the argument can be made that better magic gear can be added without adding warding. I think its would still be unhelpful to add it to shops/minigames/monster drop tables, since thats the only way you can get most magic armor anyways.
---
yeah I meant combat bots generally can't go start new tasks. if you plan to stay in one area for hours, combat bots will work
---
Might have been someone who clicked shift to drop without realising

You lost me, we are talking about donations, if you expect something on return for a donation, that's not a donation.
---
7 day free trial from mobile then you can snowball the bond from there
---
Are you sure?
---
So I went from oldschool to rs3 back to playing both right now. Both of the things that you mentioned are part of the reason why invention is great. 
---
Simply put, the process of invention:
---
1. Disassemble items into components 
---
2. Use 5 components to create a gizmo 
---
3. Put the gizmo on your augmented gear
---
        3.a. Almost all combat gear level 70+ can be augmented and most gathering skills have an item (axe/pickaxe/ect..) which can also be augmented.
---
4. Level up your augmented gear through combat or skilling.
---
5. Once it has been levelled up enough you can either destroy it at lvl 10 or siphon it and keep your item at lvl 12. These provide the same amount of exp, but lvl 12 takes twice as long to get. So if you're training you may destroy cheaper gear like barrows or gwd1 gear, but siphon higher level stuff like nex gear.
---
So that is the bare bones of how you train invention. The skill itself acts as both a massive item sink as well as a quasi gold sink, which lies in the gizmos (perks).

So basically any torso, leg, weapon, shield or skilling item above level 70 can be augmented and fitted with perks. These perks are made from the components in which you get from disassembling stuff. Almost every single item in the game can be disassembled to give components. There are 3 types of components: 
---
1. Common: Very easy to get and can come from anything, but usually come from items that are very easy to get in bulk and relatively cheap. Ie low level metal armours and weapons, logs, bows those sorts of things. These are generally used to create items to help with invention rather than perks which help with combat or skilling. 
---
2. Uncommon: These components generally come from the same sorts of items that are listed above, but in much less quantity. For example, tensile parts and precise components are both materials you can get from disassembling a magic longbow, but you'll get about 10 tensile parts for every precise component you get. These types of components are generally used in both items that help with invention and combat/skilling gear. Some of the best skilling and combat perks require hundreds, if not thousands of these components to obtain.
---
3. Rare: These come from a specific source, usually uniques from high level bosses or specific untradeable items. These are almost exclusively used for combat and skilling perks and they tend to produce ones that either are best in slot, or very close.  These components tend to be by far the most expensive to get, often requiring millions of gp each to obtain. 
---
The best way to illustrate the use of these is with the perks precise and equilibrium. You can get both the precise and equilibrium perks from precise components. The best combination you can get is precise 4 equilibrium 2(P4E2), which is incredibly rare. Even at level 120 invention it is about 1/1k per attempt, which will take 5 precise components. In order to get enough components to attempt 1 of these perks you'd need about 22k magic longbows as well as many thousands of swords for the gizmo shells. All in all, this perk will likely cost the average player 10s if not &gt;100m to get. If you were fully perking out max gear you would need to do this 6 times. 
---
However, the next tier below, precise 5 can be obtained from 5 Armadyl components and is guaranteed that you will get it. This gives a lot of value to Kree's uniques that they would not have before and is still a pretty good perk and is very accessible for most players.
---
This is arguable one of, if not the best weapon perk in the game and is akin to getting a tbow or scythe. There is zero content in the game which requires either of these two weapons to complete, but it helps if you can afford to get one you should. 
---
So in going for a playset of this perk, you're taking an absolute shitton of items out of the game. It also acts as a quasi gold sink in that a lot of items that would have otherwise been alched are disassembled instead and therefore not bringing additional gp into the game. 
---
Additionally, most perks don't come close in price to the one that I mentioned and are relatively affordable. The best perks however, do tend to be very expensive, but they are that way for a reason.
---
The last thing is that it also costs money to use augmented gear in the form of divine charges. When you augment an item it takes a certain amount of charges from your charge pack with higher level items (t90) taking about 3x the charges of lower lvl items (t70). This is in my opinion one of the things missing from warding in that you should have to use some material, I'd assume vis, to maintain the wards that have been cast on your armour. 
---
Sorry this this ramble, I hope some of it made sense, feel free to ask any questions if you'd like
---
You could use that argument for almost everything. Next to nothing in OSRS is actually difficult. “Why not just bot it” seems to just be an excuse not to play. If you don’t want to play then just don’t lmfao no one is making you
---
the extremety is inconsequential considering the fact that the pure logic is at fault, there is no sliding scale where at some point he is correct is telling people to skip
---
That’s not what I’m arguing.
---
If you time it right, you can click once at the very end, and your character will run straight there without getting caught
---
Id rather have an Audi than a pos Subaru
---
Black (t) for Raiden and Splitbark for Sam would be a good start.
---
D2H works good enough I think to get Sam's Murasama in a pinch (mostly for the color and the stance, sadly not the shape).
---
Raiden could really just use the Katana from clue scrolls, it'd be much better.
---
I got another charity tax break just for spending time with you by replying, thanks
---
Yeah, so they can write 24 skills instead of 23 skills in description of the game
---
Not at all. They have a track record of releasing massive updates poorly and taking years to make them decent. See Zeah, Nightmare Zone, Nieve’s cave, etc.
---
&gt;new 10 minute quest
---
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE
---
Apparently you are.
---
&gt;I don't want any skills because that's not old school
---
&gt;Now excuse me while I go kill Vorkath with my blowpipe
---
&gt; How is oversaturation of the number of skills a less bad problem than oversaturation of the content of skills?
---
I already completely described this in my response. It's more digestible for new players and veteran players alike to have things segmented into easily definable chunks. For a new entering the game who wants to train a skill, it's easier for them to not have to read a 30 page guide because that skill is oversaturated. 
---
Oversaturation of skills is just simply not a problem. It wasn't a problem when slayer, farming, hunter, or construction were added, and it isn't a problem now. 
---
And even then would you rather have a &lt;5% increase in the number of skills, or a 100% increase in the number of content within a skill? The relative impact by adding it to existing skills rather than as a standalone is way larger.
---
Pathetic, but at the same time sad. He keeps denying his ban like a fool even he and Jagex knows the truth, but what you can do about to a person who has put his heart and soul into a video game which in the end means nothing? Even when he was rank 10 Ironman, he was still a nobody, for me at least - if you want to be something by OSRS, do streaming, videos or do something where you have a chance to be noticed like DMM.
---
But if this guy does 5 stages of grief (currently he's on 1st stage: Denial), I feel pity for him. Such a wasteful effort as a person down the drain.
---
Is everyone seriously this against warding? I don't get it, warding soumd great!
---
So if crafting works with wood, why did we get fletching?
---
It's not really like a farm run tho. It's more of just a wait timer where the more higher your level is the less of a wait time you have because you have more safes to crack.
---
So at lvl 80 you have one and have a 30min timer to refresh it. But at 97 you have like 20 so if may take you 1 hour to get through them all.
---
Jagex bad at balancing new content. Have you seen our pvm drop tables and NMZ?
---
Afk money making with runecrafting? I musta missed something. I didn't think there was any afk runecrafting.
---
The problem with all of these ‘progressives’ is that they can never handle to cold hard truth, they just go into a melt down. 
---
What do you expect. His post literally states he has no concerns over the fact a MMO is being catered to a game mode which encourages solo play.
---
I really don't think the OSRS community knows a damn thing about the effects of item sinks on the economy. Like the overall macro effect. So fucking what if Dragon Boots are 300k instead of 500k. Spiritual warriors are more of a nostalgia thing (which is completely fine and acceptable). But we don't need to damage other parts of the market because we think Dragon Boots need a life time static price of 500k. Same goes for Warrior Rings, which I often see people claim needs a sink. Warrior rings are bad rings. Plain and simple. Imbued they are better, but still bad. OG 2007 players used them, but they really had no idea that strength bonus was much better. The ring is trash and shouldn't be forced into a 1 mill item because it used to be cool.
---
I'm voting no for this reason.
---
so we need more skills that have little to nothing to offer is what you are saying?  Why, why cant we have a skill that has interactive content for everyone, those at end game and those that are just starting?
---
thanks bro
---
Wow you’re so pathetic dude, it’s sad to see people like you exist. Change is natural and with helpful discussion we can make this game better than it is today. People like you are really the only force that’s hindering progress. This conversation could be bigger than osrs but we will keep it here. Fact is you seem really sad man I feel for you buddy.
---
&gt;Crafting is a skill for creating ranged armor.
---
Crafting is a skill for working with gems, cloth wood etc. You can already create staves and robes with crafting, given you already have the magical supplies.
---
&gt;magic
---
Magic is not a purely combat skill in the same way ranged and attack strength are. Magic is also a utility skill. Reviving plants isn't combat, tanning hides isnt combat, teleporting isnt combat. But most importantly we already have magic being used to create magical components in charging air orbs.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
My argument isn't to making crafting alone, or magic/runecrafting alone take all of warding. 
---
Magic and/or runecrafting would be used to imbue non magical wood/cloth etc with magical properties, like how charging air orbs is now, then use the crafting skill to assemble them into armor.
---
What specific element do you see in warding that will break the balance on the game?
---
One thing I always find slightly troubling is that fans seem to create more interesting landscapes than the devs.
---
That said, really interesting, believable bit of world building here
---
thing is you're talking 5 and 6 years ago when osrs first started and they failed miserably due to it still be nostalgia as a motivator back then. Keep in mind sailing was polled pre ge and artisan slightly after. Think they were both just around 50% for a yes
---
BiS after Ancestral AND fashionscape? Wish I had a bot farm to vote 500x Yes with.
---
When??
---
Dude gave me 3m and full rune since he was leaving. I know he's a Reddit or, so thanks my dude! It's been a ton of help on my Quest to complete every Quest
---
Imagine not having 2FA for your email
---
How so? Most things have locations where they must be done (ex: mining at an ore rock) and some have limitations on when you can do them (ex: slayer-only monsters). You can choose to do the runs at any time, in any order, or not at all. Not to mention there are other ways to train the skills. I’m genuinely curious what you mean.
---
Nice.
---
Way back when before the bot nuke I remember
---
started the day before al karad came into the game, never once used a bot.  Mainly due to not wanting to risk my computer by downloading suspect software.
---
In essence the same problems exist.
---
1. It's a buyable/ bankstand.
---
2. It doesn't really make sense on the tin. Imagine you're a veteran coming back to check out how oldschool is like. Do you think they'll find Warding interesting and engaging, or do you think they'll find it to be closer to a bunch of contrived activities to a vague concept, similar to how Divination in RS3 is?
---
3. With the existence of all crafting/ magic/ runecrafting, it doesn't fill enough of a niche to justify being a skill. Magic armor, yeah, it lacks a lot of tiers and reasonable ways of getting them. But Magic, in essence, is a multi-faceted and obscure premise- It almost makes sense magic armor is obtained in weird ways.
---
Splitbark, Infinity, Void, Lunar. All of these are obtained in strange but appropriate ways.
---
4. We could just as easily implement all the hotfixes to magic's effectiveness in pvp/ pvm anyway, and take warding's unique aspects and put them into enhancing existing skills.
---
5. Warding feels like a box that contains all the bandaid fixes to a bunch of problems, but in an almost too "nail on head" sort of way. Cool, it creates an item sink for low tier armors. But isn't there a more creative way to do that? Why can we imbue rings with Warding, but enchanting rings is still Magic?
---
I myself would like to see a **good** new skill enter into the game. I don't think Warding will have a pull for new players, be interesting enough to engage existing players, and it doesn't justify itself existing enough for old players to agree with changing the point of OSRS; "oldschool was cooler than newschool"
---
The fact Jagex even come up with the ideas to negatively impact other skills in this way is a bad sign, which is why I’ll vote no. Similar case on other games/MMOs. I’m playing another MMO, ESO, &amp; the fact the devs can come up with some ideas, which all the PVE, PVP &amp; roleplay community argue against because it will break the game in some way, is a bad sign. On ESO they’ve done it repeatedly, came up with some real stupid ass game breaking PVP decisions specifically, on OSRS it looks like the same with some aspects of Warding.
---
Click and hold alt on your keyboard and move it around
---
He's just jealous he didn't also get the idea to make that quality joke.
---
#VOTE NO
---
&gt; Why is hunter better as a new skill than as an expansion/incorporating fishing?
---
Are you stupid lmfao.
---
As a Guthixian myself, I would love to be able to become a gnome glider indeed.
---
Yes to that.
---
I don't know what any of that is so i don't like it.
---
Definitely in PKing, where 1 inventory spot for a brew or something can give a very big advantage. (Often have more than 3 runes). Although at the same time, one of the biggest struggles with people ever trying to use the standard spellbook is having WAY too many runes in your inventory, so maybe this could help alleviate that?
---
The more I think about it, the more I think it is just a gut reaction that I don't like it, more than anything I can reason through 100%. (Helpful, I know lol)
---
Because yeah I do agree that a lot of the time for me, the biggest issue the rune pouch being at 3 ever causes for me is just that its slightly annoying to like house tele and then use a portal to GE, instead of teleing straight there, etc.
---
Again though, if you make a superior variant it will adversely affect higher tiers. 
---
Is superior adamant better than regular rune? If so it doesn't make sense. If not, there's very little room to increase stats without usurping rune and making it worth the hassle.
---
Is superior rune better than dragon? If so, dragon is devalued, along with every PvM creature that drops it. If not, it's not worth it.
---
I agree it's a "shame" smithing can't be more useful, but I'm not really sure how it would change. End-game PvM/PvP equips really have to come from boss drops, they can't be gathered via resources. Some equips, like Dragon plates and spirit shields have to be forged via smithing, but it's just a 1-time thing. I'm not really sure how you can get past that.
---
Gotta respectfully disagree on that one haha
---
Having a year headstart before the skill releases allows anyone to stockpile all the way to 99 if they wish. The price spikes on release are a result of sudden demand when there should be none. Jagex can easily stop these things from happening yet they dont.
---
Maybe it stems from rs3’s shitty new skills
---
Theirs a big difference in constructive criticism and insults, originally I was providing constructive criticism but then I was insulted so I felt I wanted to retaliate. You’re “let’s make peace man and let the elitists do and say whatever” isn’t helping.
---
No smackdown since it was on Twitter but they basically confirmed he had expired botting bans before despite him saying he had never botted. Plus he then started to ask for a lesser sentence since it was his "first offence"
---
If you Say you haven’t auto clicked high alch at some point you’re a liar.
---
they wont add a skill to existing content its something they did with lunar diplomacy on rs3 and i don't believe that was received very well
---
Your point is strawmanning everyone else and generally being disrespectful to the opinions of other people.
---
90% of what I read from you is “everyone who disagrees with me is an idiot. It’s really, really immature. Why do you have to be an asshole about it?
---
Well in my defense rs3 was ruined before that but i get your point. Anything at that point is an "improvement" or "saved"
---
Because it appears to be an illogical viewpoint. Why would you want to prevent all new skills entering the game? At least explain your logic.
---
High alching until I break my mousepad
---
What if I dont want a new skill in osrs?
---
It's creative, but I highly doubt a *Smithing* upgrade that instead makes all PvM and PvP easier would never pass a poll.
---
Why
---
I know why youre struggling with that. Thats because a lot of the things that warding is said to do already perfectly exists currently. Taking elements from already existing content and basing a skill around that already screams "this skill cant stand alone." Its pretty baseless. Charging orbs is already magic and enchantment.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Ya know makes me kinda glad I don't have max cape yet because I can knock it out right as warding is added and get one of the now very few max capes. Just finished fishing the other day, swimming in money from all the anglers, and not looking forward to the next grind...mining...also jamflex give me a pet plox, I'm 4 99's and 123mill xp with no pets. I'm over the beaver drop rate and close to the heron drop rate. I'm bout to get on lottis next dry streak post.
---
If warding isn't old school or fits in with the feel then I'm sure Zulrah and birdhouse runs can be removed too
---
Nice dude I’ve been trying to get him for a while now.
---
are you playing in person or online ?
---
My only problem with warding is that the icon reminds me too much of house portals.
---
lvl 70s loved invention because it made worthless gear worth something because maxcapers had to buy them in bulk just to finish a cape. Game catering to level 70s that only lasts a couple months max is silly
---
Regardless of whether or not this guy botted, why can they figure out that he did and ban him but not the 18million GE gambling bots or woodcutting bots or zulrah bots or any other bots for that matter?!?
---
Straight Toronto man just scammed yo ass.
---
Wow wow relax my brother no need to insult
---
A reason why it should be added holds more weight than reasons why it shouldn't be added. Why add it at all if it's dead on arrival content?
---
Very much this. 
---
The primary reason I don’t do a whole lot of AFKing anymore is because when I’m trying to read something or find some misplaced asshole semicolon, I get logged and having to retype the password only to get logged again 10 minutes later just isn’t worth the time it’s taking away from whatever I’m trying to get done. 
---
Bring back the old lobby screen.
---
Epic new content!
---
God I hate that logic so much. I mean, nothing wrong about playing an opposite sex character, but if your logic is “I’d rather stare at a girl’s butt than play a dude” then that’s just disappointing.
---
My brother used to bot like 10 years ago on his laptop but that’s about the only thing I can think of. Also my main account has been fine so far, it’s just iron man accounts that keep getting banned
---
'uNpOpUlAr OpInIoN'
---
Yes but the problem is that this new skill isn’t fresh. It’s another buyable/bankstanding skill. I would love to see more content that’s *different* from what we already have.
---
A break from RS will probably do him good. Most people on such a high competitive level in RS probably aren't living the healthiest life (either mentally or physically) unless it's their actual job.

---
Pay for membership with cash, if you have the real life cash to spend. This way you don't feel like you have to play in that time period to continuously make more gold in game to pay for bonds. When you break it down unless your job in real life pays absolute shit it is more efficient to use real cash. Even most shit jobs it takes 2 hours of work to pay for membership for a month compared to multiple hours in game.
---
It's a little long but but hard; you also need to do dream mentor but that's pretty easy

The problem is if you buff gathering skills you buff bots

I think a lot of people would be upset if they lost all their diary rewards overnight, because it'd be a pretty big change for a lot of things, for example barrows, elite void, private hunter cave, etc.

I assume it would either not get integrated or have a large grace period post launch (lets say a month)
---
So youre just here to whine then. not have an actual discussion got it. Lmao

Just bot. No XP waste.

How about I just vote no instead?
---
I would love a new skill but awarding looks ridiculously dumb to me. Complicated and feel like it would be really weird to add it to “OSRS”
---

---
Someone please illustrate this
---
4x4 and animal style are literally both from in n out. Animal style is a mustard grilled patty, pickles grilled onions and extra spread. And 4x4 means 4 patties with 4 pieces of cheese. It's not multiplicative at all.
---
I get what your saying about it being potentially overpowered. The shift drop option is pretty decent. Was just curious I guess.
---
My first impression of this image was simply to stare at C and absorb what's going on there for about thirty seconds. It's eery and intriguing. A and D are just try hard attempts to shoehorn elvish imagery into the original login screen. B is my second place pick, but it really just feels like they moved the login screen outside into the woods, which kinda loses the semblance that I'm about to be transported into another realm. Yours feels like a brand new portal into a whole new aspect of Gielinor.
---
did they say end of the month? thought they simply said "this month"
---
I don't disagree that the content proposed for Warding could be jammed into existing skills. GentleTractor's post on Warding from a couple months ago gave some insight into how that might work. 
---
**However,**
---
It is irrefutably true that Smithing and Crafting are the dedicated melee and ranged production skills - there is presently no magic production skill in game. Magic armour has always dropped from monsters, been bought from shops or 'created' by NPCs. **Just because it's always been this way, doesn't mean this is the way it was intended to be**. Andrew Gower has supposedly given his blessing on Warding, saying it would have made sense as a skill back when he was still overseeing the game. 
---
As everyone already knows as well, **skill bloat** is a real thing. There is a LOT going on in both Magic &amp; Crafting (RC maybe not as much - and if Warding didn't pass I'd like to see majority of the good content being shifted there). 
---
We also have this 'imbue' problem and it's clear that Jagex have gone for a 2-birds-with-one-soapstone approach here. I don't really mind that. I've grown to like the idea that Warding is **the process for imbuing combat items** (armour, combat jewellery) and Enchanting via Magic is **the process for imbuing utility jewellery**. I appreciate that explanation doesn't work in terms of the proposed skilling rings, but I don't see them passing a poll anyway.
---
I would be less excited for Warding than I am if they were releasing it without quests or a minigame. The fact that it's coming with both is alluring to me, plus new skills were really exciting back in the day when I was a kid and I'd like to relive that. I hope my thoughts on this topic have been what you were after.
---
Was confirmed a while ago, but yeah!!!!!
---
Honestly wouldnt be upset at all if they moved enchanting abilities from the mage tree to warding. Offer an npc to enchant things for non members if it's a non member skill for gold.
---
Yeah dude you’re definitely the loser here. Many of us have played this game since we were young kids, no fucking shit some of us are going to expect a nostalgic feeling when coming back. I’m not sure what your definition of “grown ass man” is, but if you bothered using your brain cells for once you’d know the dude can only be around 20 years old lmao, younger if he didn’t play at the very start.

What is warding? And where's all this talk coming from? Guessing I missed a Dev blog
---
No, they are all completely true. I do not want to change the premise of existing skills.

Gold smithing at bf does too because it’s all made into jewelry and high alched later on

I don't have a lost currently but to list one i would like to see the meta for combat (nmz) be changed as its a very anti social boring concept. Also would like to see minigames revived. (possibly adding combat xp as a reward with rates similar to nmz)

I really don't know why i am replying to these as most of them are just jerking off warding with no logic for the entire game. But i do appreciate that you simply asked for an opinion without calling me brain dead thanks.

I wonder where the "blessing" would be used. I assume kraken since mage def is important there but most other places you seem to prefer prayer bonus as far as I can remember

You'd rather leave dead content skills as dead content (smithing especially) and add a new one with content that divides nicely into current skills?

Yeah
---
Wards / Warding is commonly used in video games as some form of protective magic (magic shields / barriers / force fields / etc.)  
---
  
---
Probably also connected to "apotropaic magic" which pretty much means some type of magic that wards off evil or harmful entities, spirits, infuences and so on.
---
I don’t think we need any mid tier mage Armour other than what’s there, still gunna vote no for a new skills but love the work you put into this post

I love your videos, I really hope you don’t bot, I don’t think you do. Insane dedication.

I'm a die hard fan who thinks warding seems cool, just needs improvement before we poll it.
---
This.. I didn’t last long at all after Summoning and i think being the last big update before EoC leaves a bad taste in my mouth over the skill.
---
RS3's Mining and Smithing are sooooo great for an Ironman, it lets you actually be self-reliant. On the other hand, OSRS has such better Hunter/Farming IM xp (between birdhouses and Farming guild) that it's absurd.
---
Warding improves existing skills without changing their premise. The dissolving element will create more demand for the products of other skills.
---
A friend linked me another post of someone talking about the same person

You can put on revolution which does all the abilities automatically for you, gameplay stays almost identical to OSRS if you want to but with different animations. But then you also have a choice of actively engaging with the content and using abilities efficiently if you so wish. They're also improving the early game so it doesn't feel as boring by allowing to use toned down versions of high level abilities from the get go. 
---
But like I said at least you gave it a chance and didn't like it which is fine, loads of people shit on it but haven't tried it once in the last 5 years.

Great find on RR man I had no idea about that project! I'd be interested in knowing how he/she got those samples. Are they in the client? I might actually write something myself using that soundfont...     
---
To anybody reading this in the future - that Youtube vid linked above is the way to go!
---
You can’t even trade those, this should be me, damn it. meeeeeeeee
---
There's lots of people who share the same opinions in the opposite direction (prefer magical theme of warding to the steampunk/mechanical theme of invention).
---
I don’t know if that’s sweet or depressing
---
Lmao people on this subreddit will downvote fucking anything that challenges their opinion. Its so pathetic, you speak the truth.
---
Are you said smartass
---
I'm from Egypt and I get 80 ping :O
---
People that play osrs and eft? Literally dozens of us!
---
How do you close the bank that fast?
---
Thiev ardy knights with rogues outfit. Super afk and decent money
---
Reported.
---
I’ve 100% never botted 60% of the time you ask me.
---
Why does it say Ash is "replying to @northyorkrs" when he's replying to @Sorbosander_?
---
Press escape
---
Hmm I wouldn't want to do that, don't like selling even more data.
---
In order to make money, they have to keep players engaged. In order to keep players engaged, new content needs to be introduced. In order for new content to be introduced, it must pass a majority vote from the community.
---
"Why is your character posing in your fanart"
---
You can’t do that because monsters de-Agro and then you get 5 min logged.
---
Very unpopular opinion:
---
If they are IM/HCIM - who cares. Just remove them from hiscores and let them be.. sometimes rushing end game content isnt that bad if you've already maxed a couple accounts and just want to try something/experiment. They can't trade anyways.
---
If they are not HCIM/IM then reset everything to level 1 and make them start over.
---
I did dislike back in the day losing a solid IGN when you got banned for botting.
---
Yep
---
What's a dog?
---
I just started playing again after bein away for a while, I'm gonna go ahead and not vote on this thing I know literally nothing about.
---
I’m 126 I only had a kraken pet and I lost it because I didn’t know to insure it.
---
I mean you're free to vote however you want on what content if any warding brings (if it passes). (And I mean this and respect this) But too many people who want warding to fail the poll just blindly vote no to everything even though the next questions are asking what you would like if it does end up passing, which is the mindset that leads to a completely unfun, dead skill that exists only as another barrier to quests/diaries/max cape/200m all, which while it seem's that what you want it, judging by how much people complain about new content being dead content that's a minority.
---
I did and got my 2.1k main banned, can't say I regret it.   
---
Started out with autoclicking, moved on to light ahk, progressed on to more complex ahk. Eventually tried an actual botting client and got my 1st temp ban (my own script). A month later I was back at it again with a mouse recorder and got myself a perm.   
---
Took a couple months off, then started playing on the alt. Did the usual autoclicking, and ahk abuse. Got to 2k total, and got myself another 2 day ban with a mouse recorder. After the temp I continued normally with some ahk and eventually got burnt out.   
---
If I ever come back I'll definitely continue. I just love scripting and getting away with botting more than the acual gameplay. But I didn't just bot the majority was done legit, some half automated and some fully botted.
---
&gt; slightly annoyed
---
im not a prick and don't get offended by other people's happiness.
---
 Ur it kinda devalues other ironman that are actually playing the game.
---
C. None of the above.
---
Lol no trust this is an irl friend who makes bank as an accountant... he wouldnt scam me for $60
---
Yea I tried buying a bond last night I just left the offer in for 4.5m all night it bought when I logged on today
---
Honestly never tried it because I’m sure it’s a great way to get a computer virus.
---
Did you create this 100% yourself? Or did you use some generating tool? Looks great!!
---
zezima
---
Bruh, put some yellow text on a black background with that and you're set. Amazing
---
bruh 🙌😫😎😡😤
---
Good bot.
---
Think of it like this, it's diet Mtn lightning and they're trying to say it's not. Sorry but it's not Mtx dew. 
---
If they want to add a skill I want it to be a quality product. Warding isn't.
---
It’s working great all those places are PvP hotspots now lol.
---
How did you make that map, is there a program for that? Looks great btw
---
lol its annoying as hell when some lvl 50 opens the door to attack a ravager on the other side
---
I type in my password so often it takes half a second tops.  Is it that big of a problem?
---
Shouldn't you just say 105+
---
I'm getting an error when trying to open the link in the today's poll to view pictures. And I don't see this poll in the news on the official page too. Can someone post the link here? I'd like to vote :).
---
Hahahahah would be pretty jokes... I doubt the guy who makes 60k a year is gonna scam a irl friend of 14 years for $60 LUL
---
D reminds me of the temple of time from ocarina of time.
---
Need more work ethnic if ya wanna be a b b beast of a pker, b.
---
God damn i respect lynx titan so much. Dude came in and wrecked this game quicker and harder than anyone else, then skipped town like some sort of cowboy. Respect.
---
Maybe do slayer until 70 or green dragons for bones and hides
---
There's a minimum of 5
---
Also maybe someone can help me out but on mobile I can't seem to add a post flair. I'm sure I'm just being dumb but it just says "this community doesn't have post flairs" or something to that effect
---
It’s 50/50 somebody will say it or won’t
---
Dungeoning would have had the same impact whether it was a minigame or a skill.
---
What a useless comment.
---
Sick art. Looks like he's doing external shoulder rotations with his shield though lol.  Gotta keep that rotator cuff happy!
---
Never going to pass a poll unless Tbow and Blowpipe both got nerfed. Ranged is too strong to give any better gear to. That's why they couldn't get those Vampirium Vambraces in with ToB no matter how hard they tried.
---
On the island of conri, what is the southernmost icon, looks like a golden feather or flame?
---
Holy crud though this is awesome. Maps are always the essential start, never ever though about using the RS style.
---
In a different comment, type Q
---
See: the Overwatch and League communities
---
Break the bot. If the bot cant bank, it will not be able to make anymore bowstring
---
Agility is the dumbest skill in my opinion in terms of training. Fire-making, smithing, and thieving are all pretty fucking useless apart from diary requirements which is frustrating.
---
What.. lol
---
Ok
---
I didn’t bother fighting cause customer service suck there goes 11$ it was only a day ban
---
You’re so rude.  He misunderstood and you didn’t even try to act civil.  It’s not an attractive way to act.
---
Found him
---
Item sinks reduce deflation, not inflation, and OSRS is in deflation.
---
Train travel was invented by industrialists who wanted to make money so your point about airline companies is ridiculous. They weren’t invented as “public transportation.”
---
I’m not mad, just disappointed
---
You do realize that 1-99 is 99% filler in the form of low level armor and weapons, right? You listed everything the skill does in 1 sentence. How is that a "really wide skill?" The only skill more worthless is Firemaking, but you can at least level that quickly without investing 65m to do so.
---
Bandit's
---
&gt;Just release some content without consulting our shit playerbase once in awhile... It seemed to work pretty well until Eoc.
---
There were lots of bad updates before eoc. Even still you manage to encapsulate why its not a good idea. It works pretty well right until it doesn't and once it doesn't there's typically no going back.
---
I hated its introduction as a skill.
---
As a mini game i wouldn't mind as long as i wasnt forced to do it for some BiS item or w/e
---
Lol I just realized DVS is gonna have to go back and re-max his two other ironmen
---
Is this just Photoshop? Or is there a tool for this?
---
In what world is a new skill not a large amount of new gameplay
---
remindme! 2 hours
---
So what? Any new content can break balance. What matters is it is quickly corrected.
---
Jagex is already balancing content around Tbow. So how is balancing around new content bad?
---
Haha, I love it XD
---
And yet they quickly became one of the best forms of public transit, in some countries. There's a good reason we don't use them in the USA. Airline companies managed to lobby any development of them into the ground while also creating a bad public image of them as a "poor man's transportation".

---
are rangers going back up?
---
I think it would have been good if wards were created from fires by use of a lamp. Firemaking could have a lot of potential that way.
---
Lol I still want new things to come from osrs it becoming its own game no rs3. It has to change to survive other wise what would I do when I reach max go pk? That’s dead content.
---
\&gt;Should we vote to remove Firemaking because its a shitty skill which is not up to our standards?  
---
...yeah
---
The game you grew up loving is built on content that wasn't polled lol. Most of the skills we have. Most of the map. Almost everything.
---
Why home? Get it on mobile man!
---
I'm still waiting to hear any sort of reasoning to be opposed to any new skills.
---
I didn’t say you were? Do you just assume what people mean or do you read their comments and genuinely not understand arguments?
---
None of the buffs are helpful for botters, especially when requiring 85 of the artisan skills and costs extra 400 gp every time it activates, but it's cool, convenient and a nice flex for real players.
---
This was taken a while ago.
---
Yeah rs3 rates are easily 1m+/hr with the best methods
---
I think a really good example of this  is the difference between d'hide and blessed d'hide. we can make d'hide. but we can get better d'hide from something else. Right now other than xercian, we can't make any good magic robes. everything is buyable. So why not allow us to make some better robes, more easily.
---
Condense the skill properly while we're at it. Put the boots and stave making in warding as well. It makes more sense.
---
Say goodbye to your account
---
Brought to you by Twitch(tm) Prime(tm)
---
I don't like this
---
RuneScape has always been like that.
---
I think you have it backwards. I think future Elemental Workshop quests should use Warding, not that Warding should require the Elemental Workshop quests.
---
Those gathering skills are tied to a production skill.
---
Mining provides ores for smithing.
---
Woodcutting provides logs for fletching (firemaking being a way to remove the logs too, we all know that's the most useless skill design in the game)
---
Fishing provides raw fish for cooking.
---
Then we have crafting that utilises some of mining, and hides from monsters. Hunter ties in as the gathering skill for this relatively well as well, but hunter is kind of its own thing as it was introduced later.
---
Warding is being proposed as the production skill for mage robes, but what gathering skill does it have? Warding... Or hunter? Or farming? Idk they can't seem to decide there. It's where its odd where it is. It's essentially an identical skill to crafting in practice... But where you use magic to afk and gather resources... Or you can use warding to quickly gather resources at a cost..
---
See the confusion and weird design issues? Warding is a production skill that is essentially magic crafting, but it's also its own gathering skill. It would be like if for crafting you went and afk'd range to gather thread. Or for smithing you had to afk firemaking to turn ores to bars for use in smithing. It's a weird gameplay decision that is the only thing differentiating warding from crafting.
---
Without that concept, and with a regular "tool and gathering skill" warding would be "use this resource from gathering skill and craft it into magic robes". Which crafting already does for Xerician and could easily do for other robes if we wanted a way to craft them 
---
That's why it's a reskin, and one with confusing design decisions and a massive identity crisis imo. And after all that it doesn't even change the game, the only changes it makes are flat buffs to existing content that could be brought in anyway, and mid level mage gear changes. Other than that it will just be a buyable / afk'able bank standing magic crafting to get a skillcape and forget the skill after that.
---
This is very good. Let's make this happen. Step 1: pass warding.
---
Not really, they still had to sit there in the dungeon for 20 minutes and are 80m short
---
[Yes](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1102306828829057031)

ah, gotcha.. grats though brother

Lord shayne defender guide. There u go
---
You already have one on your bank if you're smart, why wouldn't it be there to log in too? :/
---
That’s the one where you gotta run around over and over right? I think they made it more manageable in like 2017
---
Jesus....
---
I think it's pretty accepted that range is currently, and has been for a while, the strongest 
---
combat skill with three of the most OP things in the game all being for range. Blowpipe, twisted bow, Rigour.
---
This definetely took some time. To put it in perspective, during the 50-99 range grind 
---
[I was able to create a member Hardcore Ironman, die at total 2066](https://twitter.com/HCIM_Deaths/status/1124245879404355584) ,
---
create a new hardcore and get to close to 1600 total level.
---
The loot is pretty much all in my inv. Rune items were alched and I used most of the gold for addy arrows.
---
I also used up 30k death runes,5k chaos runes and around 50k mind runes, and dropped between 15-20k cosmics to my alt together with
---
iron, steel and mithril arrows which I didn't keep track of (probably around 100k arrows in total).
---
All of the mithril kites, earth and water runes and limpwurt roots were just dropped, I also cut all the 
---
gems I got and dropped them as well. 
---
I got from 70 to 75 crafting just cutting gems they drop, and also from around 43 prayer to 68 burying big bones. 
---
Lastly, I also used an Earth Tiara instead of a Coif because Coif looks awful.
---
Gz on 200k
---
\&gt; Is superior adamant better than regular rune? If so it doesn't make sense.   
---
The bonus stats don't have to be directly related to melee combat. Maybe one bonus is the negative bonuses are reduced, or the armor is lighter, or it could just be something lazy like a prayer bonus. That way, improved adamant will never be better than normal rune with it's primary purpose.
---
Yeh it's not even really the tool, like a hammer is a tool or a knife is. We still use the lamp as our "tool" to harness the magic. The ward is simply the production station.
---
Even though this is /r/2007scape and I've never played nay of the Elder Scrolls games I still half expected the Skyrim meme when the screen went black.
---
Because some people think that any change what so ever to osrs will be bad for the game. I understand their point of view because rs3 but it gotten to the point where they complain about it because "it's not osrs". I'm not saying we should blindly accept changes to the game but some changes are helpful are in some cases needed. Personally I'm all for adding content to the game, the problem is that they have to add something new but not something that will heavily affect late game shit but also wont be "dead content" atleast that's how this sub acts on new content.
---
No ty, next.
---
You are welcome son.
---
Make ta bank with two bankers side by side. A red and blue. Tedious but not too bad. Or maybe a bank for quest items over to the side?
---
This is actually one of the things that kinda drove me away from rs some. I dont play much anymore and a big part of that is my realization that most non-combat skills have no end-game. fishing and cooking can make decent money, but in most other skills you are better off grinding mobs for the drops that you would be making. Do you grind mining up to 70 and compete over the rune ore, after grinding smithing up to 85+ and then barely make any money on your rune items, or do you go kill mid-level monsters and make a lot more money for the effort, even getting the benefit of being able to safely alch most of the drops because of how much higher the profit margin is? 
---
TL:DR I feel like the classic crafting skills could use a rework to make them relevant to pvming.
---
Hahaha, so far I do not. But now I will be looking out for them.
---
Nice achievement man that’s nuts!! Gratz. True gamer
---
what a shit reason to vote yes
---
Or log on Rs3.
---
spend 3.5m a day ? dumb decision. just don't post incriminating info online and/or just use a different username from anything related to your public profiles
---
You're maybe spending too much time unconsciously at those efficient places too. I come across full dragon equipping warriors all over the place just wandering around ahha. Mobile definitely helped an influx of returning and newer players who weren't as experienced or caring to be efficient.
---
Hol up. This is cool but how did you get 70 crafting f2p?
---
You were literally arguing that they shouldn’t vote no just because they didn’t want a new skill. I didn’t say you were saying they can’t vote no. I was saying that you shouldn’t force people to have to let content into the game that they don’t want.
---
Ok few problems with the stuff. 
---
1. Nightmare zone isn't dead is the sad thing. It is actually the best way to get melee xp in the game. And is profitable at that and no other skill has the fastest xp be the most profitable way to get there aside from melee. The devs agreed awhile back that nightmare zone was a mistake and that it is the one content they would remove if they could. It doesn't need to be revived as they are actively trying to kill it with the removal of most of its rewards.
---
2. Castle wars is not dead you have a thriving competitive community. Yes a activity bar would be nice to have.
---
3. Soul wars would need a massive revamp of its rewards as the xp from it was stupidly high. FoG sure I'm game as the shields are interesting for PvP. Stealing Creation no sacred clay rewards try again IMO.
---
U really should choose a handle that cant be traced back to your name at the very least
---
So what youre saying is we need new ranging gear?
---
This would be great location, super close to a bank too. New warding got me hyped
---
This better be on the calendar or riot
---
&gt;compare "dead"games
---
ahh, right where we don't want to be lumped in.
---
The Hosidius revamp shows that it’s possible for them to eventually fix all of Kourend, though. I have faith that in due time we’ll see the rest of the map look great.
---
Lol this is great
---
Binging with Babish makes it.
---
Is autoclicking considered a low level offense that jagex pretty much ignores or is a simple autoclicker not something their antibot picks up?
---
