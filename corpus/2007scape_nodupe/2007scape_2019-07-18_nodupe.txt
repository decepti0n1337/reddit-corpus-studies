Ok but Jamflex's PR department aside, EoC is RS3.
---
I’ve said this same shit to sooo many PKers on here but they always fall back to “Nah I should get a greater reward for attacking someone who can’t fight back. Oh and it should be easier to do.” 
---

---
This isn’t an argument based in logic at this point, it’s PKers being lazy and greedy.
---
If the Grand Exchange was moved to lumbridge would it change the game to be better?

Nah I'd get 40 Sara kc and lay the nut if you will to Zilyana in her own boss room bro

Row (I) on hellhounds in the wilderness is a 1/32 hard clue drop rate, eclectics give you mediums in less than an invy, and ham guards give easy's in a few minutes. Upgrading to a master is very fast after you have the elite. But yeah, if you can't complete masters that's a different story, though you can still trade in all the elites you can't complete and take a shot at a master.
---
Alternatively for hards, if you're an iron like that helm suggests, could be green dragons. It's 1/64 instead of 1/32, but obviously you get bones and hides anyways so it's kind of like 0 time hards.
---
Why is there none of it in the actual 2007scape base game? It feels so out of place. I'm in a slayer dungeon, not a rave. I'm binding blood runes, not partying at a rave. I'm fighting a massive, toxic snake, not partying at a rave.
---
Purple doesn't really exist much in nature, so it's really obnoxious. It seems like ghost wants to use hyper neon purple colors as some sort of calling card, but not only does he not know it looks awful, but it also looks really awful as a player if you spend time and perform an activity there.
---
What kind of sick joke is it that Brother Jered is the guy who teaches players how to make pa(e)do robes?
---
&gt;Why is slayer better as a new skill than as an expansion to combat? 
---
In retrospect, it doesn't make much sense to have as a skill other than variety in killing. One could explain it as "you've already killed a large variety of lower-levelled creatures and as a result you now have enough experience to deal with slightly more demanding higher-levelled beings". Knowing pure combat doesn't guarantee you have that experience because you don't necessarily slay monsters that require particular finishing, damaging or combat techniques to kill much unlike slayer ones. 
---
I still think it doesn't make all that much sense but this is my attempt at an explanation.
---
&gt;Why is hunter better as a new skill than as an expansion/incorporating fishing?
---
Hunter is (mostly) the pursuit and entrapment/slaughter of animals in a **terrestrial** environment, or if not terrestrial at least active hunting of the prey. Fishing is the **aquatic**, largely passive luring of animals. The process for both is clearly different and having experience in one doesn't have much influence on your performance in the other in realistic terms. 
---
&gt;Why is farming better as a new skill rather than as an expansion of herblore? 
---
Again, having experience in cleaning herbs, knowing their effects and making potions has obviously nothing to do with taking care of plant life.
---
&gt;Why are firemaking and woodcutting not part of the same skill?
---
Same thing.
---
&gt;Why are attack and strength not 1 skill? Ranged covers both damage and accuracy. 
---
This one is actually a good question and it absolutely is idiotic that we have two separate skills for melee combat.
---
&gt;Why are magic and runecrafting not 1 skill?
---
The distinctions made above involving a realistic perspective aren't made as easily for things that explore the occult like Magic or Runecrafting, since the lines between both are so blurry in the first place. This discourages their separation into different skills. However, you could still argue that Runecrafting deals with the process of compressing the raw energy of Magic into rune essence while Magic deals with the interaction of these energies with each other through the casting of spells (which obviously require different runes), making them infinitesimally yet sufficiently distinct. Another thing to note is that through the precedents already established (cerb boots, wlb infused wand, lunar staff, etc.), Runecrafting also covers compressing magical raw energy from altars into other items and not just runes. All this to say that manipulating arcane energies is already the theme of both and that they cover all sides of the magic spectrum in terms of creation, processing and production, thus leaving very little reason for the development of a new skill.
---
&lt;p&gt;Why are mining and smithing not one 1 skill? 
---
Same realistic distinction. Extracting minerals doesn't mean you have the knowledge to work them.
---
&gt;Why did construction not get put into crafting?
---
That's not such a bad question, and the only explanation I can find for this is Construction is simply item creation on a massive scale, involving slightly different physics. The realistic distinction doesn't really apply here, though and I agree with this sentiment somewhat.
---
My point, really, is that Warding doesn't have as clear an identity as the skills you mentioned and that we already have two skills involving the arcane. We don't need a third when Runecrafting would very clearly benefit from this. As long as the exp rates for the new content are ridiculously low compared to current rates in order to limit items to usefulness only, meaning they would simply be rewards for training your runecrafting skill and not training methods. That's something that runecrafting sorely needs.

Risk isn’t a factor. Don’t attack a person in tank gear if you don’t want shit loot. It’s so simple. Stats shouldn’t be based on how much cash you’re worth if you get killed by another player.
---
Personally I would much prefer a 2010 server to what we got.
---
I just dont think a purely oldschool server with no update is viable. The entire point of MMORPGS is the point that they get updated. 2007 Runescape is an unfinished game, with unfinished quests, unfinished areas, and arguably unfinished skills (Hunter mostly).
---
Splitting the playerbase also changes the economy as less players are playing. Specifically I believe that a 2007 server with no updates wouldnt be very popular. Maybe at the start, but people would quickly get bored of having no new stuff.
---
Though I am probably not the right person to have this discussion with, as I would NEVER play Runescape if it didnt get updated. So I cant imagine a version of Runescape which would just not be updated
---
hold up, shouldn't that show white lily seeds as well? they're a unique more rare than the bloody bucket in my experience

---
The only issue is that KC isn't track iirc so it could only display their current KC not the KC they got the pet at
---
Nah, I've done them before. Way too much inventory management and banking. Plus the monotonous consistent drops are extremely boring to me.
---
Maybe, that's why I'm only asking for 1-2 worlds. I'm not telling them to shutdown the main-game and force everyone to only play 2007 RuneScape. Just a couple of our own worlds, for the guys who started playing 15 or so years ago, and still love it like that.
---
Even if we only have 1000 people playing and it's just one world, it's still more than that permanent DMM world, and it's still 1000 people that get to play the RuneScape they want to play.
---
Never seen someone typo Zaros so badly before, but don't blame ya
---
Bruh you wasted your time by not doing rooftops. You should have full graceful already
---
I would settle with some of the good quests from 2007-2011, but I love 2010 Runescape more than 2007 tbh
---
&gt; they also brought the value down
---
That's what getting rid of the highest drops does, it brings the average value of the drops down, but then they redistributed the weight towards the middle of the pack such that the average value of the drops is lower than before, but the average gp/key was higher.
---
The only girls in osrs are the guys that are "too lazy" after recruitment drive /s

The point of the wildy is to facilitate amthe opportunity to PK. Not the guarantee to PK. Not to guarantee you money if you PK.
---
I personally liked the idea of dungeoneering, but not as a skill. I think it should have been implemented as raids or something. It was certainly helpful overall though, but it didn’t feel like much of a skill
---
the bonus doesn't work in pvp so having block on is just +3 to your def.

At current, the normal spellbook can't recieve more than 1 spell without adding another row, which is a no go.
---
Im talking about condensing spells that are functionally the same, with different values. Including elemental spells, curses, ect, not teleports as those are functionally different.

If you're using a curse (or elemental spell), you're unlikely to need to switch between different tiers of force in one setting, making a toggle effective

I always wonder where I'd be in life if I hadn't traded my future for RuneScape, and actually paid attention in school instead. But then I realise I'd be a normie with no exp gains. Yup.

Yeah. Twitch continues to do nothing about it. I think the jmods recently said they came up with a way to help take care of it on their own, without twitch. Which im pretty sure just means they set up bots to mass report the phishing streams lol because twitch just does nothing.

"Humor"
---
&gt; Once again, you ignored the part about not everyone running your gear or trying to fight back.
---
I don't see how this isn't a point in my favor. Most people in the wild aren't running Dinh's just like most people in the wild aren't using max mage gear.
---
&gt;First, saying a Level 40 Armor is half as good as Level 70 Armor is by no means comparable to saying a Level 75 Shield is twice as good as another Level 75 Shield
---
I mean, it's the next best option. And is what most people in the wild are wearing. It's literally a 1:1 comparison. 
---
&gt; Also, not sure how you can say an AGS is twice as good as a Whip; it is roughly 60% higher stats than a Whip
---
65%, from pure stats, sure, except you ignore that it's only used for the spec which has double accuracy and increased damage. 
---
It is [quite literally](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cb6ghe/a_list_of_pvp_accuracy_rates_against_a_dinhs/) twice as effective as a whip and that's assuming you're using a ddef. 
---
&gt;Oh also, Ahrim's (+58) is not twice as strong as Mystic (+39); that is a 50% increase, which is exactly what I suggested the Bulwark should be over the DFS
---
I mean, yeah if you wanna pretend like *defense* bonuses aren't a thing on *armor*.

This is utter nonsense and couldnt be further from the truth, and this is what happens when you fail to look at updates holistically. This is why I always separate Runescape into 2 eras: Pre-2008 and Post-2008. These eras are very distinct from each other.
---
Now, let me answer this question: Was EoC a bad update? Yeah, sure. It was pretty bad. But it was merely the product of what the game had become. Had we not had summoning, had we not had curses, had we not had overloads, had we not had dungeoneering, had we not had chaotic rapiers, then there isnt a single chance of earth that we would have had something like EoC. It was to be expected because the game had been pushed into a corner where the only way out according to devs was introducing a new combat system because they had pushed the degenerate button far too hard. Something we have been on pace to do on OSRS for a while now as well. Everything goes hand in hand. Nothing appears out of the blue.
---
Therefore, its very very easy to imagine an action bar in post-2008 era of RuneScape, it played right into the hands of what the game had become.
---
Conversely, its impossible to imagine Evolution of Combat in pre-2008 era of RuneScape.
---
Since you dont know.... "a great partnership" is a way for jagex to sell your personal info to twitch..  they dont give a fuck about anything related to what you think of "partnership" .They cant just straight up sell it anymore cause of "GDPR" laws going into affect in the UK. 
---

That's why you see so many "partnership" ideas lately from a lot of companies  based in the UK

Yup I been playing since the day Oldschool came out and its the pre-eoc that people cared about in 2013, not the arbitrary selection of skills that just so happened to have been around before the 2007 backup was created. I really don't think oldschool should be using the same skills that are already in RS3 though, because if anything the oldschool team should make them better and therefore different. I think the warding skill does a good job of taking from RS3 skill mechanics that have had a positive impact on the greater game ecosystem as a whole. It should be implemented.
---
Lol ikr I bring 2 brews and 4 anglers and have never does. Also this guy forgot he bring noted bones so he’s just as roastable

Lmao a 2k total pker isn’t a pker. It’s a skiller with attitude
---
I bet he had a pretty special and intimate relationship with that hammer and losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.
---
Even though this change to curses coincided with EoC, I can't see this change as being EoC exclusive because it is in no ways reliant on abilities or adrenaline.
---
This is incredible
---
Why didn’t you join a private sever if you wanted an unadulterated version of the game with no progression that would never change? It’s a business. Yes we are here for entertainment , we pay for it, but at the same time we have to have new shit added to the game. I guarantee you they already have the skill completed. They aren’t going to waste their time and effort on it

I'd recommend buying a blowpipe and try and get yourself a fire cape. Afterwards you could decide to keep the bp, or sell it to invest into prayer and other skills.
---
Did your brainlet even look at the profile pictures
---
I mean whip isn't really used in any high lvl pvm even tent is seen as very budget. Bp is just fucked for how cheap yet good it is but I guess zulrah bots will do that lmao. I guess on average tho high end pvm gear is generally more expensive when compared to pvp gear.
---
To fund 77 pray (63) id probably have to do a good bit of zulrah anyways so I may as well train first then learn zulrah.

Okay, so don't spend any money on chins. Instead, get an MSB(i) and rune/amethyst arrows and 15 minute AFK at Nightmare Zone. You'll get like 650k XP a day for like 200k, before herb boxes
---
Anyone have a list of optimal dailies/things to check in on every few hours and their reqs? Coming back and no clue where to start so I want to write out a list of stuff to do when I log in before I go bossing (more exp focused than cash, I won't take time to do herb runs, for example because i would make more profit just doing 2 vorkath kills rather than going on the run.)

Thanks in advance!

No Free Trade made it harder for active/high level players to play, but they were also the least affected by Eoc because they had the time and the motivation to learn Eoc mechanics. The most affected by Eoc were low level, on-and-off players because after Eoc they suddenly couldn't play at all. Summoning, dungeoneering, could simply be ignored, you didnt have to do it. Eoc was forced on everybody.

Lol this guy was literally bait. The fact you thought this was a legitimate pker is why you guys get skulltricked all the time and cry on reddit after.

Don’t allow stacking of the same curse, but a cool set effect of some new curse gear could be to allow the player to place an additional curse (so 2 total) on their opponent. Although, I think there’s also room for a few entirely new curses such as a poison curse that you cast on an enemy and if that enemy is already poisoned, when they receive poison damage there is an x% chance that they will receive two poison hits instead of one. Or a set effect that increases the effectiveness of curses, allowing you to reduce the opponents stats by 20% with the highest tier curses, which would reduce a max mains def by 20 levels (pretty significant amount there). A curse that drains run energy of opponent at 2x normal rate would be cool. A pvm curse that blinds the opponent giving them a 7% chance to miss would be neat too.
---
Yeah I am so confused. Just gonna finish off all the other kills for the quest and hope for some proper RNG when I come back.
---

---
ok tbf there has been plenty of endgame content release in the last couple years. as at least 1 of the big 3 updates has been for endgame players. Theatre of Blood, Chambers of Xeric, kebos was good for everyone.
---
And roe/caviar.
---
Same thing happened to me
---
You're never finding wizardsam25 with that quitters attitude
---
So Everytime I'm getting a Slayer task I'm looking at porn?
---
Think you report him in game for breaking real world laws
---
Don't worry about it Dongs mate, you're clearly dealing with a classic Reddit geek here.  
---
Why is it that some of these weirdos have so much to say about PKers, PKing, mechanics, etc that they have little to no experience with?   
---
Man's talking about max teams but has likely never even dealt with ancestral blokes before.  Honestly.. these Reddit kids talk so much shit about salad robe souljas and mystic hat magicians but haven't bridded in their life, why? At least the noob PKers (spade collectors as they've been deemed) are trying to learn..   
---
This cringeworthy divide that's being continually driven between PvMers, PKers and skillers by the neckbeard circlejerk on this website is baffling haha
---
Whales, mostly.
---
Honestly surprised the serp helm got the hit alongside void awhile back rather than the bpipe. Item is dummy broke dps and so much revolves around it now I’m sure they’re too scared to change it now
---
Many people have expressed ideas for Curses which would be definitely suitable for an Arceuus House rework. I'm just concerned with buffing the existing Curses on the Standard Spellbook if they aren't moved to the Arceuus one
---
No one allowed to poke fun at people in Arizona? Or are you one of those SJWs. Based on your comment history, you sound like a proper spud
---
Hey Roidie got a Tbow? Nice.
---
You must be hung like a horse
---
Yeah I have a rock hard stiffer over here

20% stat reduction is about what it would take for them to see use in pvp

I think Emps is one of the ones that actually adds things that are completely OC.

I think Emps has some. I forget though.
---
You can convince me that updates and new content should be welcome, you can't convince me that Warding wouldn't be better as a crafting/runecrafting/fletching rework then it's own skill. 
---
Vote no to warding!
---
If you say so. Enjoy your night my friend.
---
Reminds me of when I killed the rank 1 clue scroller uim he kept spamming "plz no" and that he would give me gold...added him on discord and voiced with him he told me he lost a rune pouch and tons of shards or something :)
---
I love this design
---
Lol.  You make it sound like I'm butthurt.  I just find it downright hilarious how clueless this sub is about deep wild.
---
I do both PvP and PvM in the wild so I am not biased
---
My suggestion would be: Make Curse Spells ignore magic defense, in PvP and PvE. For example the Bandos Boss has such a high magic defense. But if Curses ignore resistances, Curses become more viable. Same goes for PvP. Next step would be to make curses stackable but ONLY in PvP. Otherwise you would see an over use of it on every boss. 3rd step would be to give curses a unique mechanic(PvP). Maybe let the first 3 spells be calculacted flat and all following ones multiplicated. And disable curses in Multi PvP Zones.
---
Void is BIS off task? In what non-boss situations is void not BIS then?
---
jfc im stupid, thanks lol
---
"20k gp? nah I think i'll go for 200 gp"
---
I think the point of this poll is moreso to guage how good a representative the Reddit community is compared to the wider community. That's why the poll results are being hidden until after the official poll. If the Reddit poll is close to the official poll, then in future discussions we can say–with slightly more credibility–that a poll failing/passing on Reddit means something for official ones.
---
Nope.  All the experienced PKers gather at any PvM/Skilling hot spot.  Lava maze, chaos altar, revs, kalisto, and black chins are the main ones.  Wilderness relies on a food chain
---
Why this look like me
---
You can take off the bulwark unless you're tanking you know? Have you ever anti-pked before?
---
He's [skilling with style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwN6efmhp7E)
---
I was going to vote no to warding but if this is how the new skillcape gonna look like I'm voting yes
---
I haven't read any of the blogs, but I'm voting yes for that sexy purple goodness
---
Not ops act so idk how he could tell you
---
Wait it doesn't count below 0? I thought that was the whole point of weight reducing gear
---
was watching dbz on my other monitor lol
---
So is warding gonna be passed or something?
---
too much skilling mustve killed his braincells, sad tbh
---
pkers bad
---
but rc worst
---
Petition to make Vorkath Headless when the head drops...

That was satisfying.

Barrows gear is more than enough, I'd make that a priority since farming barrows is great for any Ironman

🦀🦀🦀GENTRIFY VARROCK🦀🦀🦀
---
No u
---
So basically its like a race or specific group of people saying that calling eachother something is okay but the moment someone else does its bad
---
Some will argue thats what CoX is.
---
I think adding a minigame where you get to check out unexplorered sections of caves/woods/castles and getting a chance to find gear would be cool. But it would take a fair bit of fixing before a skill like dungeoneering would be welcome in osrs.
---
He can't log into OSRS anymore because his account keeps getting locked from people trying to brute force it
---
Summoning was so great when it came out.
---
by some tweaks you mean: no terror bird, war tortoise, pack yak, bunyip, unicorn, or lvl 80+ titans
---
Does that explain why some kills on vorkath roll one normal drop?
---
I think the OP is specifically using this as an argument for people against warding because it's a new skill and not so much other reasons they may be against warding. The original comment is not specific to warding, but OP is saying it's another reason why warding should be ok (mainly to those who are against it for this particular reason).
---
Ok
---
Having a custom house tiles months earlier does not hurt integrity or mechanics .
---
Because summoning would either be OP as shit or useless

Isn’t there a warning that you’re about to enter deep wilderness? Christ, man...
---
mystics is standard for ghorrock singles
---
much thanks
---
Oh, that is gross. Stop using konar!
---
Don't the levers give a warning message if they lead to wildy?
---
O I 1t flick slayer so misc pray pots build up so I got a huge surplus so pray doses aren’t really that hard to get for me
---
most of the people on this subreddit can hardly kill a demonic gorilla let alone nh brid
---
Yep.. I previously turned off warning messages... oof.
---
Dg is a minigame, not a skill. gtfo.
---
50/50? Nearly all posts on this sub are supportive for warding now since the rework.
---
ah, yeah I wouldn't have noticed that in 100 years haha
---
That actually is serene
---
Right, because we should all be aware of who the sweatiest no-life players are in a video game.
---
Its pretty reasonable to start soloing at like 105-110 cmb with mid-high tier gear
---
you're at the part inside the cave, not outside, right. cause if you're still outside you have more stuff to do. if not sorry, im out of ideas
---
Don’t go running with that edge! Could poke yer eye out!
---
*”They all gotta buy sarabrews”*

For you do rooftops from as soon as you can don't you average enough marks to get full set by the late 50s?
---
You asked why they preferred it and said it's basically the same shit.
---
I said it was not the same and that fandom was outdated as hell (both missing materials and having incorrect info).
---
Guess I shoulda specified fandom in that first post.
---
I thought the same was well lol, it is totally synced up. Two people having a confrontation

---
[suggestion] let me use my rock hard stiffer to smash gargoyles that Konar assigns
---
Can you not?
---
Havent played osrs in months.. is warding gonna be a thing
---
Awesome! Thanks
---
Is there an NPC option that somehow blocks blackjacking?
---
According to the wiki, wrath runes are better. Not sure if that's with max cape or just rc cape though.
---
Agility affects regain speed when not running. Weight affects how long you can run
---
looks like mod ash
---
You can go back and grab your stuff. 
---
(You might have seen other players opening chest, meaning its not instanced)
---
Gains before brai.... wait
---
Curses, Chaotics, Ancient Warrior Equipment... Hell even the stuff we got from Fist of Guthix was severely overpowered. There was SO many things that were horrible decisions, however just because alot of it was bad didn't make them all bad ideas just bad execution; Even some ideas were fine in of them selves but the WHOLE together was bad.
---
I guess it could be changed to +10% accuracy to attacks towards the target instead, but that would be more similar to affinity debuffs instead of Vuln.
---
At this point I'd just go to volcanic mine and get a spell
---
I love this
---
Upgrade to steel. That iron isn't too great and steel isn't much more expensive.
---
The northern part of Varrock isn't too bad, it's just a slum in the southern part probably due to the dark wizards killing noobs and depriving the local economy of their gold.
---
It's a stretch, the d'hide boots are high tops

Thieving is purple base with black trim.

Ahhhhhh that makes sense. Thank you!

Honestly check the official RS forums. IDK any, but they post applications and stuff there.
---
didn't make the cut because it wasn't submitted in time? Seems unreal that this wouldn't make the cut, well done.
---
Imagine learning to ok on world 18.
---
ruining the game to pwn the haters

i know those 70s stats will be too hard to get right
---
where do you guys work? i work for Sage in Australia..
---
already a thing
---
r/runescapehentai
---
They wouldn’t complain about being killed entering the wild if they weren’t forced to enter it. When non-PK content gets put in the wild, it opens the discussion up to more than just PKers.
---
Rofl of course it is. Thanks m8 time to do some research
---
Your argument and logic are fantastic. The problem is that everyone is already stuck in their opinion on this, and unfortunately I feel like it's a losing battle. I hope I'm wrong though. You can't have your cake and eat it too, in the sense that it should be oldschool but also shouldn't be boring, grindy, or buyable. It seems like it can be one or the other at this point, since all of the current skills are like that and I've yet to hear something alternative (minus sailing, rip)
---
Nah man, J mods didn't like it (I would put it top 4 but i'm bias)
---
you can solo literally everything in the game besides revs and ToB basically
---
I think soloing CoX for the twisted bow is actually p efficient. you can get it done in about 45-50 minutes after you learn it and are decent at it and obviously no split so you keep all the loot
---
I always talk to him, he's my favorite.
---
Training at a 100 times gravity basically.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
o okay the vids i watched very misleading then cause they make it seem so simple like o okay just spend 200 g on the cart and bam your done
---
personally woulda voted this one
---
What is wrong with you.
---
There was a suggestion a while back to make it clear who's attacked you- Skull Tricking generally relies on using multiple accounts with identical appearances and names to skull someone they're attacking
---
Nooo! Just had to do a slayer task after to celebrate!
---
Got unlucky with loads of acid attacks which take ages.
---
The only leveling I did was rooftop, everything else was quest/complete
---
What’s your setup? I use dragon cbow, anti fire shield and potion. Then pray range, hardly take any damage.
---
Gigachads don’t even wear weight reducing clothes
---
Clue hunting with it is my favorite
---
nah bro, it’s the **S**
---
you didn’t draw it in elementary school?
---
Well.. shit

Same! Feels great to finally wear Rune platebody!

i think it’s reasonably likely that it passes yes

---
Yep, and you find those pkers up at deep wildy pvm/skilling hotspots. I understand you can go to PVP worlds, but it’s not the same. If you pked often or are in a singles team you’d understand that
---
afk skilling: wc, fish, amethyst mining, glassblowing, cooking, smithing etc.
---
Farm runs are also quite easy
---
Although I really like the art and design this has more a Fossil Island theme to it then priff imo.
---
*song starts playing out of thin air*
---
Pumping?
---
That fire surge will fuck you up, dont get it twisted. Hits 40s.
---
And brews are a bad deal to tank with solely. Gonna drain your magic defense a ton if you dont restore every 3 doses
---
Bro RuneScape is a fucking magic place
---
I want the wilderness to be as Jagex designed it; high risk, high reward. Thought experiment: Don't you think it's a problem if you can hunt chins with no gear and escape 100% of the time? That is a fundamental design flaw. I'm not saying I have all the answers, and I'm not saying that the shield is the only culprit, but we need to balance around the design of the wilderness.
---
Who gives a shit? It's his life he can do what he wants. Live your own life you troglodyte.
---
You're missing the point. Xerician robes don't set a precedent for magic gear being craftable without Warding. If anything, the opposite is true - here's a magic robe set released in the last three years that was reluctantly added to Crafting amongst all the ranged leather armours because it didn't have an appropriate skill to be nested under. They don't support your argument, they're examples of how Jagex even came up with Warding in the first place. 
---
&gt; Slayer is fun, hunter is fun, magic is fun, farming is cool
---
That's totally subjective. Just like how I don't think Magic is fun and you do, some people are going to find Warding fun and some won't. That's part of the beauty of OSRS. You're not forced to train anything - you train the skills you want and interact with the content that suits your playstyle best. 
---
&gt; standing and clicking in one spot for hours blows.
---
Well I uhhh...have some bad news for you...about, like, the whole game.
---
which is great for botting and a waste of time on a main
---
This looks amazing
---
yes stinky
---
Ye actually, I pk singles every day, it’s like all I do lol. I pk at 44s BH world, black chins bh world, mb and resource area, 50 wines, and rev entrance. 
---
My risk is 400k-600k. Standard AGS/Maul set up. https://m.imgur.com/MEqdK56?r
---
The wild is pretty dead, I can count on 1 hand how often I run into clans and I pk every day.
---
i dont understand any of this lol
---
Dude, i understand how averages work...
---
Im certain avg gp/key (which i meant by value) went down with the droptable change.
---
They tweaked it again later on, but that is irrelevant as the first change is what made the reddit mob go apeshit.
---
I change it everytime, I bet ur lazy u don't even brew in the beginning of games
---
How do he mechanics work, does anyone know? If someone actually sells one of those for 1 coin, will op get it, or will the person with the highest-value buy ticket get it? Or is it chronological?
---
You know people get smited there right. Despite you thinking otherwise. Hell, several days ago Thurco lost a serp helm with around 10k scales in it at the altar.
---
? Wildy ports dont work. Mage bank lever. Also do t think of tb as only pking people below 30 wild. 
---
People tb for
---
Ppl looting in pvp worlds.
---
Killing bots.
---
Securing kills in multi fights.
---
Keep ppl im rev caves.
---
Sneaky bh tb at the end of fight.
---
I'm not against new content I just don't want warding as a skill. Slap those magic robes with a prayer bonus into crafting or a new Temple Knight quest and call it a day. 
---
A new Temple Knight quest that rewards Magic and/or Range equivalents of Initiate/Proselyte would be pretty bitching. I like quests.
---
I'd vote south every time in the hopes to get it to Lumby.
---

And the rich get richer
---
Just pay yourself 10 Jute fibres.
---
My flair isn't accurate. Do you want to respond to my point, or was that all you had to say?
---
&gt; Im certain avg gp/key (which i meant by value) went down with the droptable change.
---
It didn't, people made spreadsheets right away and the average value of a Konar drop was higher (on RSB prices because GE prices were still too low bc new items)
---
This is what poop looks like, after swallowing gum
---
And what about crafting/const cape (t)
---
So stinking cute!
---
I wanna be the one with the cool watermill on my head.
---
Don’t forget Midnight!
---
thats very much untrue
---
Ok so BH is weird because PJ timer. Im out deep multi and single borders everyday for at least 6 hours.
---
Mad cuz bad
---
highest current buy value
---
Unless he finished the quest.
---
idk why but the 98/99 prayer points in this screenshot drives me crazy
---
okay since we need gold sinks lets make it so if you go pking you items are returned to you for a fee too. also lets make it so if you go PVMing you can pay a small fee for temporary max gear because we need gold sinks right? what stupid logic is that
---
Messaged you in dms!
---
Sadly this is true some people are too lazy/uncaring and bring the teleport scroll book with all their teles on it and their cash stack thinking that they wouldnt randomly meet anyone in the wild an then get ice barraged for 20m or so. Making it the real problem we need to stop people bringing dumass risk to wilderness.
---
Highest value offered will get the items.
---
Suppose if i keep it on 2gp , OP will not get it.
---
He said he forgot it. Being in the game for a long time doesn't mean he'll always remember it
---
This sounds like a hilarious idea. I feel like it would divide us into silly teams like east team versus west team and so on.
---
Yeah, my point being that its far easier and not expensive to open magpies instead of killing hellhounds or dragons with row for hards.
---
Do you have 43 Prayer already? If not, I would recommend investing in that before your gear as it will make questing much easier. For example, a Dragon Scimitar will be one of your best offensive weapons at 60 Attack but you need to do Monkey Madness to wield it, and that is much easier with all three protection prayers. Especially the underground section.
---
Your best bet is to do dragon bones on a lit gilded altar in the house party world. Its safer than the Chaos Altar in the Wilderness which is better xp but there's much more risk. You could also do some quests beforehand to try and get more Prayer xp to cut down on how many levels you need to train. The Wiki has a list if you scroll down: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer
---
For gear, full rune is relatively cheap (around 130k), a combat bracelet is probably your best in slot for gloves until you can get some of the higher tier Recipe for Disaster gloves, and a Glory is your best and fairly modestly priced amulet. For a cape, I would recommend the Ardougne Cloak. You can get it for free by doing the easy diary (requires a few quests and skills but nothing too difficult) and has some small bonuses, together with an unlimited teleport to the monastery south of Ardougne.
---
Don't be so... axiomatic
---
I need your help, adventurer.  I'm trying to dig in the wilderness but I'm so dummy thicc that the sound of my ass cheeks clapping keeps alerting PKers

I used to use this colour scheme in Halo reach. It was called Khaki and Seafoam

Why don't you join a private server?
---
Tell that to the chinese during ww2
---
But u profit and get a chance at pet with firemaking
---
Already got the phoenix
---
Well yea, that’s why Bh worlds are better for solo pkers, on top of that you’ll actually find other pkers risking more than salad robes and can pk 2m+ pks consistently since it’s almost always active there. 
---
Regardless, even outside of Bh/PvP worlds, I can’t think of a single time I ever feared a TB, it’s really not that strong when you consider that an outlast fight lasts 3-4 minutes anyway.
---
Not sure about the brown. The colours should represent the theme in some way, is brown... mystical?
---
That could just be me tbf. I’d try the purple cape with your light blue trim.

---
Don't cheapen my comment about the majority of the player base by saying neither is more sensible. People wanted a GE, for convenience, and so we have one.
---
Just because you're an ironman btw doesn't mean we all enjoy the same stuff. I don't enjoy sitting at the ge spamming to go afk and wait 5, 10, 15 or more minutes until I get a trade offer which isn't even what I want.
---
I want to play the game in the mode I chose to play, which really benefits from not having to include time waiting around to trade.

How come quick prayer for mage/blue?
---
ive only taken a crack at it once so far. got the mechanics down but ended up having to leave without a kill because i just couldnt hit high enough to kill it in a single rotation and then it goes into its random nothing makes sense anymore phases and it becomes a shitshow. gonna try again soon at 80/80
---
Or does it?
---
Just add a few :33's here and there and watch the money come in
---
That's quite a hilarious troll though, that shit works on gullible scapers
---
bait?
---
How many brothers are u killing at a time?
---
I bet runecrafting would fail if it was polled today. So would agility and firemaking as well. I support adding warding because it seems interesting enough.
---
There isn't anything out there other than the official client.  Runelight also doesn't have any plans to expand into the app and I wouldn't trust any company other than Jagex or open source like runelight.
---
I mean, I wouldn't say it's meaningless unless he's said anything since then which is contrary? I wasn't trying to say it's gospel, but everyone in this thread already decided lynx has gone to a different game.
---
Just because someone drops out the spotlight doesn't mean they disappear. Who knows, maybe his parents had enough and told him to make his own lasagne?
---
**Nobody** here seems to know anything for definite, so you don't get to weight comments on their value. Dunce.
---
Cause when ur learning if u dint know whats coming u dont gotta switch prayer or gear for red but if its blue then u can quick pray and start switching
---
Well if you're hoping for runelite to come to mobile, they already said it's not happening.
---
If you want it bad enough i guess learn programming urself?
---
Lmao I’m so naive cuz I’m new
---
They must be looking for my logout button.
---
Id unironically recommend going to a library or something. If its not possible, use void and a fury to minimise switches. Try to familiarise yourself with the rotations first, theres some apps that teach you them on the android store. Prayers go first, then gear. Try to save eating for between phases and make sure your prayer is over 20 before jad phase
---
And like i said before its always time to switch gear and prayer after blue so ull know then
---
Gotta love how you crossed out your name but left your friend's lol
---
So do people want soul split and all the other pre-eoc shit now or what?
---
This honestly looks like jagex shilling to me.
---
In 1:13 why do i feel like thst was me lol, i got the warhammer recently on that exact same spot lol
---
I have a few questions about Barrows.
---
Here's my current gear/lvls: https://imgur.com/a/W0V5Zil
---
What should I be wearing for Barrows, and for which brother?
---
What gear should I get/swap out? Rune Cbow and broad bolts or Msb and Amethyst? What ammo should I use?
---
What's thee optimal route to fight the brothers?
---
There's a thing I've read about a certain "percent" you should be aiming for? What would that be and how would I achieve it?
---
I'll be setting out to finish Morytania Hard Diary soon and would like to do Barrows as soon as I'm done.  Any other suggestions or recommendations would be great.
---
Thanks.

Playing???
---
Agreed. Once you've won hundreds of millions in less than a minute, it's hard to go back to 2-3m/hr without it deeming pointless.
---
Every chaotic is worse than what we have now, especially CCB/maul which would be almost useless besides pking and chaotic staff would be decent in general but not gamebreaking.
---
This is like the closest you can get to a purely horrible thing as you can get
---
Bullshit
---
People still complaining about EOC today? Utterly bullshit.
---
EOC is **not** the problem. Today &lt;5% plays Legacy Mode, people love EOC. Combat triangle is well balanced. Monsters with consistent behavior e.g. demons (deemed as "magical creature" in Old School by any slayer master) **are** magical in the sense that they use magic and are weak to range... And I could go on and on forever...
---
What people wanted was Runescape pre-**MTX.**
---
Old School is Runescape without MTX. Full stop.
---
Having said that, with or without Warding, I love the new content they're suggesting to bring into the game.
---
I just wanna get over with the diary first. Takes time to learn so ill do it later in the future
---
Well obviously he still remembers because 10 years from now he'll still be playing Runescape.
---
I've gotten them from contracts. I don't know if its specifically for hard contracts sine my farming was 90 when the guild and farming contracts came out.
---
Ye, who tf wears mithril leggings with that setup, freaking bullshit
---
no problem mate, good luck in the game! :)
---
He can peer into your soul!

**Sea Shanty 2 Intensifies**
---
Found the ironman!
---
Gratz bro farming cape is sick, any tangleroots? Also I think there’s another pair of boots that match the rest of the green.
---
Lms has helped me a lot. Theres a cool feeling being one step ahead on your switches which i never got from pking in the wild. Id always get shit on and panic/tilt
---
I'll be voting no but would love to have a new skill, I just don't like the concept of warding
---
why
---
No they can't
---
I'd  give RS3 a shot but I have no to frands on it
---
No roots sadly. Ended with 120 hespori kc and alot of herb/potato catcus/ and assorted trees/fruit trees for the xp and yeah the boots arnt the best
---
He doesnt have a tome
---
damn that hurts
---
People will move it next to a runecrafting altar.
---
Yeah this argument honestly makes me so irritated. If they would go to the length to hide polls, and still rig it why wouldn't they just rig it from the start.
---
Hes risking a shit ton more than bulwark boy
---
I took out ancestral with a toxic sotd, eternal boots, occult, arcane spirit shield and fury, armadyl top/bottom and acb with dragonstone dragon bolts e, serp infernal and AGS to kill a chin hunter on a PvP world in case of clans. Range hit 0s with rigour and 112 range, mage splashed with around 108 mage as I boosted from bank with heart. Hitting the cunt off prayer with my prayers on augury/rigour. Worked him to around 70, went in for an AGS, which hit 0 with infernal, piety and 118 attack and strength. I brought spellbook swap and tbd him, back to ancients. The cunt easily ranked while being a proper spud with shit prayer flicking and he kinda didn't know where the hobgoblins were. It is stupidly strong. People in Elysians at least get hit.
---
lmao
---
Would your answer change if I told you that the 2nd pic was from lynx Titan's account, so all of the skills have 200m xp?
---
Lmfao either you're really unlucky or just bad at the game.  6 years in OSRS and over 800 hard clues and never died.
---
Don't we have enough brown skillcapes already?
---
One's girl random birthday date and trivia which every RS player has cherished for years, yeah this is obvious
---
Idk about you, but this to me feels more runescapey than the options we got
---
RS3 has that more like deliberately detail orientated style, while "super oldschool" runescape feels on the brink of a cheesy colorful fantasy game with "moody" sort of lighting
---
Like this looks like the cover of one of those oldschool "guidebooks" for runescape
---
I can’t think of any off the top of my head rn
---
What exactly makes you think that a pker getting an easy free kill makes them a brainlet?
---
If they refuse taking fights that are unfavourable to them, then wouldn't that be a smart choice to take? Why try to fight an uphill battle when you can willingly choose to be the one at an advantage instead?
---
Also I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there were more pkers in the wildy focusing pvm-ers and clue hunters purely because of the reaction all the pvm-ers give them in reddit and ingame.
---
If you replace the frog hat and the boots
---
Im okay with this
---
You definitely didn't do that on osrs, considering there's no dangerous portal
---
Alfred
---
Sober???
---
That's actually beautiful
---
&gt; That's totally subjective. Just like how I don't think Magic is fun and you do, some people are going to find Warding fun and some won’t.
---
This. It seems that EVERYONE hates mining, but I love it. Seeing ores stack up in the bank is addictive as hell to me. But thats me. Warding fills all of those voids in the game, and while some people may hate it, I guarantee it will be some people’s go to skill that they enjoy the most.
---
50/50  either it happens or it doesn’t happen
---
A huge thing that helped me was physically counting out his attacks and when the 6th one hit, I’d anticipate the special. On the freeze you can eat/sip potion and that’ll stop the attack on vork then crumble undead, on the acid phase I start walking after the 6th attack. Hope that helps
---
Consistently playing a decent amount per day over a period of many years. Priorities and efficiency.
---
Imagine not realizing that while not that difficult, it's blatantly obviously more difficult, which is all they said.
---
Still lower tier than green dhide.

My bucket came with my first Hespori kill, sorry
---
This is infinitely better than the purple one.
---
how? a lot of the steps are in hot spots, rogues castle I never get caught but the chaos altar is basically a guarantee.
---
Don’t worry buddy I laughed
---
Suck a fat cock it can be used for this
---
Sorry i don't use runelite, can you explain this to me please?
---
Yes my child
---
or use ring of wealth
---
It's alright, but avoid the mage robes. Makes you look like a scammer/pure/fraud-spammer
---
A great point. I've advocated for a singular server as well for a while, which consisted of the re released 2007scape with 0 updates other than bug fixes. Got voted down for the same myopic reasoning.
---
That dopamine rush once finally getting it must have juicy.
---
Just nutted on the ceiling fan and got showered
---
Got 1k offers for each item at 3k ea
---
What are the current stat proposals for Crystal armor? Are any of you selling your ancestral robes in preparation for the release (in case they drop in price)?
---
Oooo my birthday
---
You could try rev caves untill zulrah gear
---
8
---
Interesting, my goal I'm working towards now is getting an Armadyl crossbow and the Ward. I've just snagged the Ward recently and just hit 90 ranged yesterday.
---
My plan was to get to 99 ranged via slayer, use the Arma until I had enough coin to get a DHCB and then roll in the dough.
---
The problem is essentially what you said yourself.
---
You want high requirements but you also want something ”above” grandmaster. A grandmaster quest is incredibly time consuming, and by putting high requirements you’re only making sure to limit the customers that can experience your hard work.
---
The OSRS team is small, from a business perspective there’s little incentive to make what you ask for. A good compromise would be not to focus on the requirements of the quest but the difficulty of the boss or some other mechanic. This way a bigger crowd can attempt the content but may see themselves struggling a lot.
---
"but you can't complete it?" 
---
"I went from 40 to 49 runecrafting in SIX days. Accomplishments like that don't go unnoticed"
---
Who in their right mind would loan money to someone who's 6Bil in debt.
---
Chance of being struck by lightening on any given day is about 1/250 million, chance of winning the lottery is close to 1/300 million.  Just as a ball park estimate, we're looking at odds 10,000 times less likely than that. 
---
If each of the 7.5 billion people on Earth started playing Runescape from the day they were born until the day they died, the chance of any one of them replicating this occurrence would be less than 1/3.5 billion. So you would need 3.5 billion lifetimes of the entire population of earth before you reached odds where this is likely to occur. 
---
So it's quite unlikely. It's more likely that OP fucked up somehow.
---
A
---
Is this not related to the Lumbridge anti-splashing update they did? I get he isn't in splashing gear. It may work if he tries to cast again outside of the no-splash zone they introduced
---
Yeah there's no way this happened nice try at karma farming though
---
[These are the latest stats I can find for it](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/2/2f/Song_of_the_Elves_Poll_Blog_II_%283%29.png/650px-Song_of_the_Elves_Poll_Blog_II_%283%29.png?b3c8f). Armadyl has 8 more range attack bonus and better defenses. Crystal armor has +2 range defense and +4 prayer. It also has a +15% damage bonus and 30% accuracy bonus with the Crystal bow. I can't think of anywhere it'll be particularly good.
---
The range bonus is in line with black d'hide but with much lower melee defense and slightly higher magic and range defense and prayer bonus. The coif in particular is pretty tanky for a range helm.
---
Would you want sailing?
---
[:(](https://i.imgur.com/eOPc65x.gif)
---
Lol your logic makes no sense. Obviously the people who stayed on rs3 prefer the new combat. If you want the legacy combat you play old school. Also doesn’t playing on legacy mode put you at a major disadvantage?
---
That is weird I just finished my ironman from 50 to 99 wintertodt only and got 550 or 560 kc. Looks like the points gained changes the outcome alot.
---
So this has to have it's own separate database right? Else people can jump around from the latest game to this outdated game and potentially cause problems.
---
If it's an entirely new database, i don't know how the community would feel abut playing RS again **FOR THE 3RD TIME**.
---
Did you read anything or you just pretending to be stupid? We weed guy mentioned that the time something takes doesn't make it more difficult and I explained how in a way it definitely does. Then I used my distance analogy. Realizing running kind of takes away from the analogy because that also has a much more physical demand for the discussion I made an edit, before you commented, saying that walking fits as well. Fucking moron.
---
They pretty much added EoC because that's what all MMORPGs were doing at the time and they have admitted this. 
---
Part of the problem with Runescape is if they add something like Summoning and it turns out to be a bad idea there's no way of minimizing the content. WoW makes tons of mistakes but they just don't continue with it next expansion and it basically fixes itself.
---
Congrats on the axe!
---
But yes, fighting back is totally a good idea /s
---
Thing is this isn’t even really correct. There was like a 3 year gap between hunter and summoning being added. Then dungeoneering was the last skill added before EOC and that wasn’t even really a skill.
---
See?! Brown... she'll turn any second now...
---
The stats are comparable to black d'hide with each piece receiving an individual damage boost of 3% when worn individually. The full set with crystal bow offers 15% damage boost and 30% accuracy. I haven't run any numbers but it seems like it could compete with armadyl in some situations. (possibly tbow zulrah etc). There may be an initial drop in price with regards to armadyl pieces but i expect it to retain its value long term as crystal armour is expected to be rare and it is of course degradeable.
---
The armadyl helmet is the only piece that may suffer as the new crystal helmet costs the least to repair and offers a 3% damage boost over the armadyl helm. 
---
These are just my opinions so do with them what you will.
---
Perhaps, but that wouldn't really make a lot of sense given the origins of the shield and such. Perhaps blood and soul runes to charge it would be more apt
---
I did the DT thieving grind at pyramid plunder. Not quite as mindless as stall thieving, almost enjoyable for me! Made a bit -not loads- of cash from the gold seals when I banked every few runs
---
I has my entire ham set disappear a few days after I finish death to dorg. Placeholders and everyrbing, just totally gone one day. I couldn't even lose it all on death, it just disappeared lol.

No pet though :(

On my main i take the fastest route and log if i see a white dot. (Never died btw)
---
But on my HCIM i scout for moderately dangerous locations. (Never spotted a PKer in 50+ hards)
---
I don't go to Chaos Altar/Lava Dragon isle on HCIM though, as that would be retarded.
---
I once fished near a lvl 3 skiller account that was like 12 in smithing rank and had like that amount of xp
---
D
---
by your logic 99 runecrafting would be just as hard to get as 80 runecrafting, just more time consuming :p
---
If the entire population of earth attempted to replicate this outcome once per day, every day from their births until they died, the chances of any of them succeeding during all of their lifetimes would be around 1/3.5 billion. 
---
It's hard to express how unlikely this is. It's like designating a picking a random atom in a few grains of sand, mixing them up, and then picking the same one the next time around.
---
You can hover your mouse over the redirect link and it shows you the scam site it directs you to
---
If you really think that, as a blanket statement, the more time something takes the harder it is, and that your analogy did a good job of illustrating a counterpoint you are far beyond my help. This has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen hahaha
---
Why? I dont understand
---
But, i looked at my bank and it says UP instead of down?
---
Naw that’s my internet gf
---
No its clean
---
as usual the players come up with better designs than the paid artists
---
You do realise Jagex fucked up multiple peoples accounts with the attack style change and not all of them had their stats reverted yeah?
---
Hunter2
---
Tu quoque
---
Why is it only about *your game experience*? Why can't the PKer have fun looting the 10 million GP worth of scrolls that your dumb ass brought into the wilderness?
---
No, the guy who wrote the original comment hates the idea of someone spending tons of gold to unlock content through quests on pures that you previously couldn't by using these lamps, which is entirely different than reversing a miss-click.
---
Her birthday is green
---
Best offers kick in.
---
RNG if best offers are equal from different players (oldest offer doesn't get it, it's randomized).
---
When best offers are these dumb offers it means the market has run out of serious buy offers because either that market participants have been banned, have closed their offers to move to other thing or all their offers have been met.
---
Try reinstalling runelite - I've never had any trouble with that, unless my IP changed or switched devices.
---
I have a slight feeling that he may have killed them before starting the quest and taking that pic
---
This is pure art
---
What was your invent?
---
An entire server for 30 people at any given time as opposed to 50k plus at anytime? A restart? Bug fixes for 30 people? Really? A lot of people quit after summoning? I dont remember that, but then again I was too busy enjoying the game as an average player. I remember a lot of people quitting because of something called EoC.
---
/s?
---
u/JagexGambit this is why you guys need to update the news post. People are getting the wrong idea on what these lamps do.
---
Then those people should still have it reverted but that doesn't mean everyone should get negative xp lamps
---
So you want the pvmer to be the only one risking anything in a situation where someone with a bullwark interacts with a pker?  Yea sounds smart. Perhaps the simple solution is for pkers to risk more by using better gear if they want to kill someone using the shield?  Either way you guys have at it, my ely is still better them bullwark in every tanking situation lol.
---
It's a meme that circulates on this sub from time to time. People used to get their account recovered when they showed info about their account in a screenshot. Especially if they got a really valuable drop.
---
It had to be that song
---
Check your quest log to make sure you are actually up to the right bit.  
---
Also - are you using a client?
---
I also went about 70 dry for the mogre bone.. Must be a glitch in the drop rate, no way its 1/4
---
Excuse me, but it is a terrible idea which shouldn't have been polled in the first place. 
---
Account progression is a fundamental part of basically every RPG. The thought of adding negative account progression methods make no sense whatsoever, it goes against the principle a game like RuneScape is founded on.    
---
Jagex even admits in this newspost that there are technical limitations and security checks that need to be changed. In other words, Jagex never intended to decrease experience. 
---
&gt; there's been continued demand for them
---
Just because a handful of people continuously demand something, doesn't automatically mean that it is a good idea or that Jagex should consider it.
---
Keep in mind who is asking for it. They are players that **voluntarily choose** to limit certain skills. Therefore it is their responsibility.
---
It is their risk, as it were. You know, the risk from "Risk vs. Reward" they always lecture others about. In turn their reward is being overpowered for their combat level. 
---
&gt; we wanted to gauge the overall community's stance on them once again. If these go to a poll, it'll be under very different conditions than last time where they would have been tradeable.
---
I thought that the community was very clear about this in the previous poll. We don't want it, period. Stop repolling things. 
---
Anyway, maybe I'm missing something here, but I barely see any change in this and the previous proposal. Sure, you've made them untradeable, which is great. But the idea is still massively flawed. 
---
There is still the arbitrary level cap of level 50 and -500 experience limit.
---
It is flawed because people are still fucked when they accidentally get level 51, 61, 71 or 76 attack. Even when they are within the 500 experience limit. Then what about the people that need minus 501 experience? 
---
The same people that demanded these lamps, will then demand to increase or remove the limits. It is an extremely slippery slope.
---
the whole point is bc you have potential personal info on reddit, or even the username the same as other websites that they can use to get personal info 
---
knowing rsn means nothing, but knowing the reddit account attached to an rsn can mean something
---
Yes look everything behind fucking slayer. Holy shit.
---
&gt;I think Ive been attacked on nearly every clue step I’ve done in the wilderness.
---
Either you're doing your clues in bounty worlds or outright lying. I've done over 900 clues and never been attacked once. 
---
Hell, even if you WERE doing your clues in bounty worlds you wouldn't be attacked that much.
---
Your own comment sums this up [https://www.reddit.com/r/trebuchetmemes/comments/cepwll/my\_first\_ever\_cakeday\_am\_i\_doing\_this\_right/eu491ux?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/trebuchetmemes/comments/cepwll/my_first_ever_cakeday_am_i_doing_this_right/eu491ux?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I don’t necessarily find bank standing for 40 hours fun.

I like the 2nd one more. Charge it with something, maybe not blood/soul runes, but have it charged with something similar to revenant weapons.

Warning: An entire clan is going to fuck you up simply for being here.

Warning: some piece of shit is dressed up as a chaos druid and killing low levels trying to collect herbs.

Warning: some faggot knows you’re just runecrafting, but still wants to kill you anyway.

Warning: there is a group of cunts waiting to ice barrage you at the teleport location.

Warning: you know that rune pouch you spent weeks saving up points for? Yeah you’ll lose that if you die in the wilderness.
---
Fuck you.
---
&gt; The idea is that PKers are knuckle-dragging, crayon-eating, mouth-breathing, window-licking, sleeping-helmet-wearing, dumbasses that are so inbred you’d think to call them a sandwich. They can’t spot the difference between someone to kill for a tidy purse of loot and someone who will only drop a spade. Thus, they are ridiculed.
---
No where in his post did he imply it was osrs. He could have easily learned to brid around 2008-2012.
---
To a certain degree of course, but it’s one thing to fight someone better than you, and another entirely to never have had a chance and get completely obliterated, you know?
---
There are a lot of players doin clues in wild. If you pkers stopped pking us we would vote yes to pk updates
---
A cosmetic for getting x-amount of kills In a game would also be Cool :) something to show of really high skill
---
I totally agree with Ds2 req. Yeah Zulruh could do a slayer req like maybe 81?
---
Gotcha. I agree then.
---
Going for varrock body 2 on pures or 11 def slayer helm/addy gloves isn’t bad though
---
idk if it is damage wise but it means you don’t need to stand melee distance
---
!
---
Brb stealing this look
---
It was fine, better then any of the ideas thrown around osrs that’s for sure. Summoning was actually a Andrew gower update and was planned for rs way before its 2008 release.
---
People overreact because the level 99 perk was a beast that could hold 26 inventory spaces more. Something that is quite powerful, but requires 99 in the skill. 99 strength means you can hit 50-90s. That seems pretty overpowered - I think strength should be removed too.
---
Not to mention having a friend or alt is just as good if not better than this one pet. It’s also one familiar out of dozens, but sure, even if it was overpowered, let’s dismiss an entire skill because of one easily adjustable or removable element.
---
It'll be here in the form of "The gauntlet" in a week or so.
---
Fighting back isn’t possible if you get barraged and rushed as soon as you teleport into the wilderness. There’s that whole “not moving” thing. 
---
“Fight back,” he said, to the person with naught but a spade.

Remember the days where you would get muted for even saying noob? How far we've come!
---
turns to dust passed 30 wild
---
Never comment again.
---
How does the game decide whether to give money back?
---
Sometimes when I buy something I get a partial discount to my offer.
---
After reading it I will be voting no because everything they are adding is either already in the game or is unneeded. Why do we need tank mage armour and why can we create some of the best armour for mage at a low lwarding level?Mage is supposed to be high damage with low protection not high damage and a tank. The minigame is most likely going to be dead content because it is going to only give a 1/3 of the exp you would normally get if you trained warding normally with a little runecrafting exp bonus. Maybe they will change my mind if they release it in a test server world like they said they are going to do.
---
They talked about the suggestion on one of the Q&amp;A streams not too long ago, the mods weren't too keen on the idea
---
gz on the tbow
---
Spiked manacles are a great reward
---
That would just turn into question "Which minigame is the most efficient to play for rewards".
---
A spade isn’t 10 million GP, nor is any incomplete clue scroll. Clearly, by the number of discussions about this topic, it isn’t just me complaining about this.
---
You do realise alot of pkers actually want the jamal to be nerfed?
---
Same man.
---
So many minor conveniences that I just forgot Runlite added. Like left click exchange on a tool leprechaun, or right click for price of item. Etc.
---
And the big things too, like the GPU, skybox and smooth animation plugins make the game look 1000x better
---
Hell fucking no
---
They’re not killing off the gmaul. They’re making the best combo weapon for all PK builds and combat brackets worth more money to reflect how useful it is in PVP. 
---
The fact that the best combo weapon was 30k was a problem. They’re changing that, and changing the pvp meta (which is also a good thing).
---
Fix the void symbol and you got a yes from me
---
What does xlog mean?
---
Wow such a great comment.  Anyone who doesn't like scammers must've gotten scammed!
---
Everybody who got one since then lose tho not only u if it makes u feel better.
---
I’m relatively new to the game, why is it that pkers are usually depicted with the green gear?
---
It’s rare, like really really rare. It looks cool
---
Congrats brother
---
Dam what a well made video
---
Orange!
---
Farm runs this morning felt so weird having to right click the tool leprechaun etc. Not to mention the GE. Kept clicking talk to instead of exchange haha.
---
9 or 10 for sure!
---
That's true, they added that "one-off" bit since the last time they posted about negative xp lamps which I think is why some people are confused
---
So that's the whole point. to "not get killed".
---
you know people out there maybe like surviving instead of gambling who hits the highest?
---
Really you make it seem like "there's only one playstyle, MINE, and jagex should do everything to fit it".
---
If you can't kill them, go to the next target - they aren't going to try to kill you.
---
And if you dislike them running away: that's what duel arena is for.
---
You forgot slayer.
---
Let me eat it
---
Cause her birthday was yesterday, and he played RuneScape 10 minutes ago.
---
In that case the price that you offered to pay for the item was higher than the price it was being offered for.
---
For example: if someone tries to sell item X for 1m, and you put in an offer to buy item X for 1.1m, you will actually just pay 1m and get the 100k difference back. 
---
This only happens if the item you are trying to buy was already being offered for a lower price before you put in your buy offer.
---
Yeah, quest reward xp should be permanent. I’ve been wanting these for awhile since I accidentally used a dark bow spec on defensive mode on my 1def pure. I’m sure there’s a lot of accounts that share a similar situation with mine
---
Drat! Foiled again!
---
Mastakes were made.
---
I am so sorry for your RNG lmao that really blows
---
Instantly noticed the difference when logged in. 
---
15-20 fps, no animation smoothener etc.
---
It really showed the fact how little Jagex cares about their own client.
---
I wont be logging in until Runelite works again. Basic animations and low fps give me headache.
---
pretty sure u can still drop it
---
You left your compass for us to see? 
---
Gf account lol.
---
Inbread
---
That's why people do vene. For the gp/hr
---
:V
---
How many fish did you kill getting 200m xp? You bastard you couldnt even throw them back in the water?
---
Only LMS change I want to see is permanently deleted from the game.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion: Purely staking streams are dogshit.
---
What u on about u fuckin retard 😂 if you are doing something that requires this on repeat you would set it up and leave it r u fucking slow who needs the function just for 1 invent ?? It’s 1 click to setup then it’s left as it is until you don’t need ? Fuckin slow kid man
---
Sigh more pvp content. Can't we remove this toxic part of the community already?
---
I literary quit osrs for a year due to the amount of toxity I received while just skilling in wilderness. - I don't care that I die (that's the whole idea), just don't be toxic when I try to do my best while running away.
---
Before any pvp update happens they should follow suit of overwatch and make toxic language a perm mute on second offense.
---
It's not so bad in max gear and when I'm in the zone. Often can go a few hours at 20-24 kills an hour. Then I fuck up once and die and it's all downhill from there.
---
Now add one strike-through from the top of the S to the bottom.
---
I'll have yours then ty
---
What a glorious fuck up that was
---
Does that make him an old god?
---
Mystics is just easier to say than listing the rest of the gear
---
What's the discord link? Could you pm it to me?
---
Can't see the quest in my log
---
the whole point of the nerf is because jagex has decided its to easy to "not get killed" so they are nerfing it a tiny bit so its not just a get out of danger free card
---
Confirmation bias. Every time a new purple item is added “EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS PURPLE!!1!” and then when an item or area is literally any other colour... silence...
---
It’s getting kinda old tbh but I imagine it’ll never go away as players never forget anything.

If I see an meme about The Inbetweeners, I upvote.

Fuck roggy, so glad he left osg

no they don't, every ironman uses iban staff pre slayer87... atleast the sane ones...

Its OP

yes i can't do zeah library without it lol

I mean isn't every video game just clicking a mouse on your computer screen? They're all the same thing by that logic yeah?

RunelitePlus has been updated
---
We voted on all submissions and the ones with the most votes were chosen. Personally I preferred this over a few of the ones that went through, but we’ve got to respect the voting process. Good job on your submission :)
---
Haha, I'm currently in the middle of a 2 day agility grind and without those green boxes, my world is ending.
---
Inbfore this turns into a karma contest with people repeating the comment with higher quantities and values.
---
But there are mushrooms all over Tirannwn, It's one of the most memorable things about the place in my opinion.
---
So is warding officially passed and going to be implemented into the game? Or are they still trying to convince people in order to get it passed?
---
Imagine doing anything in Runescape without giant neon green boxes showing you where to click
---
Whats bridding?
---
You guys are getting k's?
---
One thing that these commenters neglect to mention is that is you are straight 60's your accuracy with the obsidian sword will be abysmal. I used obby to train to 70atk and str, but as soon as I hit 70 atk i was getting ~20k xp/hr more by just switching to whip due to the accuracy difference. Whip cannon train strength so to get your strength to 70 for dharoks obby is a necessity, but beyond that its meh. Higher potential damage than whip but with literally no accuracy. Whip ends up with like +126 for me and obby sword is +46
---
Also nerf (remove) the door and make that entire section of the wild multi.
---
RIP 30gp
---
Username checks out
---
70 is already high enough as is.
---
Dharok smack! Yes please
---
That makes me question whether Jagex knows how to properly program a drop table more than anything else, to be honest. When multiple, let alone many, people experience 'once in the history of the universe' levels of unlikeliness, the most likely scenario is that the formula is flawed.
---
One of the most broken plugins in the game tbh, along with clue scroll solvers
---
They probably lose money on it, also.
---
How do they differentiate between quest xp and non quest xp?
---
I do have a tendency to make similar art work, I should probably work
---
on variation
---
every retard can get 85 agil in that 7 months tho..
---
A whole load of people would need to mess up for you to ever buy it.
---
Petition to move it onto the Nightmare Zone so we could crush that shitty content.
---
You would need 2k total exp removed from nature spirit to get addy gloves.  With only 500 xp being able to be removed, pures would be able to do A Souls Bane and therefore do Varrock mediums (not sure about varrock hard, don’t know the reqs off the top of my head)
---
purple good
---
Ahh didnt realize u cud only use 1
---
It totally isn't though. Look at how many comments in this thread legitimately hate PKers.
---
Even then, if you constantly mock and ridicule something you eventually start to believe it. It's different from making fun of something you yourself are a part of, most of this shit is straight vitriolic and it gets really tiring.
---
Especially since the majority of the hatred and mocking is based on complete falsehoods originating from spectator bias.

Chambers of Xeric is pretty much our dungeoneering. Osrs did a fantastic job with CoX. People can take that motivation and grind out the skills to take part

If a quest is completed that gives 12k exp, you're not allowed to go under 12k total exp for that skill.

Vorkath is really easy once you learn his mechanics. The three biggest things you have to watch out for is:
---
He's got a "just keep ~~swimming~~ moving or ur ded kid" phase.
---
He's got a "just dont misclick or ur ded kid" phase".
---
and he's also got a "move 2 tiles away or ur ded kid" attack.
---
let me dream please :)
---
Well it's not for me to implement but this would be my method:
---
They already track completed quests, so based on the list of completed quests add the total xp for each skill, then don't allow players to go below that level. Could be harder with the quests that don't require you to get the XP but should be okay for managing pures.
---
Lvl wise, sure :)
---
Damn this guy is scary
---
Check fremnik boots and guthix dhide boots.

Is bp better xp per HR?
---

---
Do you legitimately believe this? Have you ever stepped in the wilderness for anything other then clues, prayer training or Rev Caves?
---
You guys are the flat earthers of OSRS. You circlejerk over this bullshit idea that could be disproven within 10 minutes, but would prefer to hold you hands over your ears and pretend it's real.
---
If you read what I said, deaths anywhere cost 5% of your gear to recover and or are capped at a certain amount of gp. Now consider a tob raid, where people are risking twisted bows and scythes and basically gear worth over 1-2B gp. That 5%/capped amount of gp being deleted from the game is going to have a significant impact. Now my question isn't whether it would be better or not than warding. My point was there is plenty they can do about gp/item sinks, but choose not to. If your reason for passing Warding is not because of the skill itself and instead that it's going to cost a few people 50-200M+ to get 99, then you haven't really made a persuasive point.

This game needs new big updates every few months. The game is incredibly dead when you get to end game. There is literally nothing to do except to max, get all pets, or do TOB 5000 times.

I have had a similar thought, like there is some sort of luck roll on creation of the account that has weight in the drop algorithm?

yknow, i'd love for lms in its current state to stay f2p and give players a taste of what members gear looks and feels like.

Or do -10 run energy in the process.

My account was hacked and then temp banned for botting. Only had account 3 weeks never macroed, however i know the website i used my email which had same pw as rs, and was rs related site. Got on about 8 hrs after mt last login spinning flax with bank cleaned. Next day hit eith a ban. Im not looking for sympathy but if i set up 2fa on my email and my rs acc and change passwords will i be safe? Or should i just make a new account? Im preferring not the latter because i just fot 70 in att str and did mm and t0 construction. But i also dont want to poor time to get hacked and perm banned. Thanks scapers!
---
aren't they only going to have a beta world if the vote passes? 
---
would really suck if you vote yes, have the beta world, realize you hate the skill, but its too late because its voted in. I don't think it will be the end of the world if it passes or fails, and understand that some people want it and that is fine. honestly it just irks me how many people are assigning negative motivations to anyone who disagrees with them.
---
no
---
I mostly just brought one invent at a time as you still get very good xp rates with minimal risk.
---
Assuming your not trying to tank, use the MA2 symbol to suicide even if you bring more bones, just bring the exact coins. My runs were generally; full invent &gt; burning amulet to lava maze &gt; use &gt; suicide &gt; repeat.
---
Wait can you explain what it is?
---
Not spite. The skill is dogshit. It’s literally a crafting clone/buyable. No one wants another crafting skill to train. It’s not fun or engaging. It’s not oldschool. All of its content can be incorporated into various existing skills.
---
Chair kit + rope + whiskey set is my goto drop
---
Which is why I was going to vote no because of the Battle Wards. Combat abilities shouldn't be coming from a crafting-esque skill. That was the worst part of warding. Now that that is gone, I'll probably vote yes.
---
I think that would get ridiculed, because actually coming up with the details would invariably change the skill a hell of a lot from a conceptual level. Lots of people would end up being mad that the content that would end up being delivered isn't the same as was polled, or that it was polled before people had any real idea of what they were voting for.
---
ima need you to delete this

Yeh they can, but you lure the spider to the right spot when they clouds aren't there and they won't pass through the spider so you don't get hit at all. I stayed in the same spot for an hour just dropping the sulphur when my inv was full.

I use(d) this kind of outfit on my Farming cape: [https://imgur.com/a/raeoefT](https://imgur.com/a/raeoefT)

That's on my original main account, which I no longer play. Nowadays I only play on my HCIM.
---
If this whole sub were a hive mind, every thread wouldn't be arguments
---
I want to frame the cover. This is awesome.
---
Can confirm. My account turns 18 sometime next year according to Hans
---
this isnt really a democracy though, it is a business. businesses give more weight to people who pay more so that they will continue to pay more. would you rather keep 1 customer who pays 200 a month or 5 that pay 11 a month each?
---
Afking means he does not play tbh, not to mention that his RS client is downsized so much that it's essentially not even on the screen.
---
What a terrible attitude mate. This LMS has the potential to revitalize the wilderness in itself. It's been seen time and time again that all it takes for people to become interested in PKing is to win that first fight, to feel the thrill for the first time.
---
LMS gives people the option to learn main bridding in a safe way and gain the confidence to actually go deep wild.
---
I've seen it personally since the beta has hit. There's been so many new noobs in the wilderness and it's heart warming.
---
I play about 80-90% on vanilla or mobile. It was hilarious seeing all the people in cc and ge griping about not having all their RL features.
---
Why was it shit
---
Quality of life changes exist in every online game in the world apart from runescape, where the devs just outsource it to random people making their own clients.
---
Theres a reason that the overwhelming majority of players use a third party client, Jagex's laziness to do things themselves
---
That’s kinda dumb what’s the point of having a beta at all if it only comes in if it passes? Everyone is entitled to there own opinion like if you like the skill fair enough cast your vote personally it passing or failing doesn’t change how I play or enjoy the game lol. This is the sole reason why I created an Ironman alt and when I play on it I just turn public off so it’s like a single player game. Got no time to hear toxic comments and opinions when I’m playing that’s all you need when your home from work and want down time lol.
---
How would the removal of food dropping be implemented? By making the food disappear when dropped? By literally disallowing players to drop the food or else?
---
You misunderstand. 
---
The problem at present is that the Gmaul ISN’T used as a +1 except in the honor pking bracket where it isn’t a problem. The Gmaul is problematic because it can be used as a cheap spec weapon in ADDITION to an expensive +1. I.E. Combo rushing and wild-card for DH fights. That’s problematic and should be fixed.
---
But they aren’t doing anything about rushing here. AGS-&gt;Gmaul will be unaffected. It’s only honor PKing that’s being impacted here. It’s good that they are making it worth more, but in honor pking risk must be equal to reward. It’s not fair that you’d have to risk 5M for me to accept to fight you in only 1M worth of gear, nor is it fair that you’d demand me match the 5M risk for 1M reward...
---
On it’s own the Gmaul is not good except as a KO weapon. It cannot be used for rushing, it’s too inaccurate at high levels, and in pures brackets players have too high HP per damage dealt in the lower brackets to be able to rush without relying on slow combo methods like Ancients to KO. Probably every pure has tried Ancient to Gmaul rushing, and it fucking sucks because a) you get no kills as everyone has time to tele, b) it’s not profitable because pures risk 70k.
---
customers who pay more should have a louder say. this is the way it is in any business, and jagex is running a business. I only have a main and a pure i sometimes bond, i am much less important to keep around than someone who plays on 12 accounts all the time
---
- Jad and Zulrah plugins have been removed a long time ago
---
- Cerberus plugin just mainly helps with seeing the ghosts since they actually are really hard to see. I guess it's borderline but it's kept due accessibility issues (colorblind/ vision impaired) I think
---
-Demonic gorilla plugin is certainly questionable
---
I distinctly remember banking it, and I would have noticed if it was following me around at vorkath. Obviously I have no way to prove it, as I don’t take random photos of normal vorkath trips. If a jmod can confirm, though, that would be helpful.
---
Maybe some would, I'm sure some would see it's not worth their time and move on.
---
Why would you ever have an uninsured pet, let alone while doing dangerous PVM.
---
Setting yourself a big goal is a good way to start off. Could be like get a quest cape. Then split off other goals that you need to reach in order to get the quest cape. Like getting your mining level up to do making friends with my arm, getting hunter up for mm2 etc. Then once you’ve done that maybe say like okay I want to now be able to kill vorkath to make money to get gear for pvm and slayer. So you would want salve(ei), void/elite void etc. then you need the western hards for elite void. Just working on bigger goals will lead you to smaller tasks that will ultimately get your account progressing.
---
That's literally just microtransactions you're describing there.
---
I will vote yes.
---
Voting yes
---
How doesn’t it make sense
---
I was pking at wildy altar when someone came along on a ironman acc wearing full graceful. As soon as I located him however, I was hit by someone off the screen and we ended up scuffling for a few minutes while he ran down the list of unmentionables to call people. All while this happened the ironman in full graceful ran away and i assumed he had logged.
---
I was being beaten in the fight and ran down to 30 wildy to tele, the ragger came down beside me and I decided to break for one moment before teleing because for some reason he decided to tele out first.
---
15 seconds goes by and the ironman in full graceful returns, I pounce, remembering all the vile names that were slung my way by his alt account. He begs and pleads me to off, I say dude why didn't you log you were completely free. He said, "thought ur dumbass teld"
---
next thing I know I'm looting 1m cash plus various other goodies.
---
You might feel bad but others have pulled even more brainlet of moves.
---
Maybe some would. But I doubt most will waste their runes or bolts for it
---
and if you don't like it don't forget to vote no!
---
I think that a lot of players oversimplify and say stupid things without really putting much thought into them. Personally, I don't care which color schemes artists use when creating content in OSRS, purple is aesthetically pleasing so it should be used. That being said, it seems like there is a lot more purple coming into the game relative to what was coming into the game on RS2. It seemed like the art team from the original development of RS2 tended to use more neutral colors or neutral tones when they chose to use colors (thinking soul wars capes and stealing creation armours) This might be confirmation bias from me reading it everywhere online, but I don't really recall much purple coming into the game relative to the amount of updates. I don't think using more purple (relatively) is a bad thing, but I think that's why the players perceive a lot more purple coming into the game than there actually is. You may have more insight than me into this, as I was fairly young back in 2007 playing RuneScape regularly and I may just not have been mentally aware of all of the purple things that may have been coming into the game, but I don't recall very many.
---
I also think it's important for artists to be able to design content in their own style, and just because the art team may have been more inclined to use duller colors back in the actual 2007\~ era shouldn't restrict the OSRS art team from using whatever they please. Another consideration might be the fact that the RS2 team just wasn't developing content that should be purple, and the OSRS team is. 
---
I don't think it's a big deal, and I don't really care, but I do think we already have 2 purple skill capes and a lot of other skill capes only have 1 color, so it would be nice to have a different colored skillcape to go with different outfits that may match warding thematically. This obviously hasn't been a factor, and arguably shouldn't be a factor, when you consider how many tan or green capes we have. Since warding is a creation skill, I like the idea of shades of brown with a more magical trim than Crafting/Construction, but brown is also already filled as a niche and doesn't necessarily go with outfits that don't already have a cape.
---
Remove sanfew or stamina but not both pothiding specs is still a thing  
---
Agree with +Mith seeds, dd briding is whatever to me. I have no problem with ::renderself its default functionality built into the client so might as well as keep it, increases skill cap too.  
---
Agree with +occult, meh on full dh, too much rng to get all pieces  
---
Don't let other players pick up shit that I drop/don't loot.  
---
-bring for people's starting loadouts, +bring(i) to chests
---
A big problem with RS3 is whenever new skills were added was that they were very barebones. Divination for a few years until invention was released was basically near enough useless besides making porters/portents &amp; signs of life/div locations. Most people burned their energy (the primary resource gathered from it) on increasing the xp/hr. It was horrendously slow and only got better because we got caches which are a daily which gives insane xp for the time it takes and the meta still is now just to do caches instead of training the skill.
---
Invention on release was a massive mess where the meta was to disassemble expensive items to throw into a gizmo which you throw away. People got 200m in lightning speed before it was nerfed and the meta became to level up weapons and armour then it became a passive skill that you train just by doing combat until eventually we got skilling invention as well.
---
Now you have to ask is it really worth adding a new skill? Eventually they'll get more content to be more worthwhile and have more training options but a lot of resources is thrown into one skill and pretty much the rest of the year is spent adding to it to make it more worthwhile. Those resources could be spent on adding onto other skills which have less worth or not as many training options. A lot of the things I've seen from warding could be added directly into existing skills, like making magic armour with runecrafting or crafting which is how RS3 currently handles magic armour.
---
YEEEAAAAAAHHHH!!! THIS GUY GETS IT
---
Im trying to do it now but I cant find out how to calculate dps vs another player :(
---
Because quests like DS2 and MM2 totally cater to pures and not mains right???
---
That's an incredibly dumb take lol
---
Hijacking top comment here, but what are your guys thoughts on RuneLite Plus? I know it has all the banned plugins Jagex wanted removed from RL, but why or why don't you use that client instead?
---
Reminds me of the div cape
---
Truth. Yesterday I was trying to do the shade robes miniquest. I died five times between two of the wilderness steps. I had a ghostspesk amulet visably equipped. Reclaiming that and the ring of visibility five times was annoying as fuck
---
Add emove between re and ddit to find all the removed post in the topic
---
I'm glad they are regulating this a bit, but a lot still seems like cheating to me. Would be great to have the QoL stuff just added to the game and for RL to not be a thing that existed.
---
Y'know what thought I've never had? "Gee, I wish I could make blue wizard robes"
---
I logged onto rs3 for 20 minute and got my construction for to 50 through the Halloween event last year
---
You havent logged into rs3 have you
---
I would say minimum levels for completed quests also can't be lamped below I think that's fair. So if you've done dream mentor you cant lamp below 85 combat
---
Keeping it at 70 allows progression in future quests. They have already talked about a. Grand master in morytania, maybe the implement some lvl 75-80’s. 
---
Also most med level accounts don’t skill at all and are going to have a rough go at getting the stat requirements.
---
Something I noticed with Monster Hunter World, being able to use the monster encyclopedia in game to see what weaknesses the monsters have, on top of having to earn that information yourself by going on a few hunts first, is extremely fulfilling gameplay.  You've earned the information and then dont have to pull up the wiki on your phone when hunting them again next time.
---
No because then a 1 defence pures could suddenly access areas of the game they can’t currently. Would change the meta significantly. 1 defence pures have never been able to use fairy rings for example, this would remove all restrictions on things like that!
---
osrs doesn't pretend anything of the sort. They purposely make polling 1 vote per account, not 1 vote per user. If they wanted it to be 1 vote per user they could implement that, but they choose not to. If someone plays 12 accounts they will have a bigger voice, not sure how that is just microtransactions im describing here
---
Its gonna be same as crafting and smithing thats how i know it will suck.
---
VPNs are way to easy to use, it wouldn't hold much back.

---
East or bust
---
This is beautiful. Looks a bit too rs3, though. Reminds me of that polypore dungeon place a bit. I guess that came out near the end of rs2, but osrs graphics haven't been updated. 2010-2012 were great years for rs2 (until EoC), but there were a lot of balance issues by then. I am off topic now, but summoning and overloads were way problematic. Dungeoneering was awesome, but t80 equipment shouldn't be tied to a skill like that. Maybe to unlock and repair it, sure, but it should have a gp cost too.  
---
  
---
Your art made me have hallucinations of what rs2 could have been. And I feel like it's better than osrs. And definitely not rs3.
---
i agree it seems lame. if they did release a beta before the vote people could be more informed on how they feel about it. you would think with something as big as adding an entire new skill they might have done it.
---
Lol talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
---
BP + Rigour is similar to whip + reasonable str gear, but BP has upkeep cost with both ammo and scales. I think its pretty reasonable.
---
You got this fam, bring a stabby weapon like a rune sword, plenty of pizzas and dont forget your anti dragon fire shield.
---
The argument was that they aren't doing it for fun. What's fun about killing a target 20 levels lower than you wearing no armor, and who doesn't fight back?
---
So if i have 1 legit and 5 fake IDs IRL its not vote manipulation if i vote 6 times for a prime minister?  
---
Lemme tell you it is.
---
Lol. You think you katter enough for people to just "check your post" Mr. Bigshot Blogger? Link it or stfu
---
How can you be a fan of warding if you havent trained it?
---
We never quit, we just have long breaks
---
*I* never said they were cheating. The other guy did. I think they give an excessive advantage over the default client, though. 
---
Quest Guides aren't actually inside of the client. There's a huge difference between having to go and look up a guide and having the guide in the game giving you the answers. The latter defeats the purpose of challenging the player to begin with
---
\&gt;Because it fits a very real purpose in the game.
---
Debatable. It's purpose could be handled with existing skills. It is not a unique idea at all and neither is it's purpose. Most of the argument against Warding is that what it provides is already feasible within existing constructs within the game.
---
\&gt;It's also a very good opportunity to introduce more variety to magic armour by being able to craft low, mid and high-tier gear.
---
Which could be done completely without adding a new skill.
---
Sounds like a sucky skill to me.
---
purple good match my graceful good me like purple
---
He never was implying, and neither am I. 
---
But even besides that, the idea behind having polls for voting is that everyone's opinion on it gets thrown in and considered. While, yes people CAN vote that way with multiple accounts, and can even look at it with that view point, I don't think most people want that to be the idea behind it.
---
Most people could probably after that one person possibly paying more money into the game shouldn't have more voting power over others who don't/can't.
---
Again, it's obviously not illegal since it's in a part of a privately owned business's structure, but it can still be seen as scummy and not really all that fair.
---
I saw someone suggest some mix of dungeoneering and sailing called exploration, that sounds amazing. Could imagine exploring islands sailing, finding treasure and exploring the island, using skills to navigate. It could be amazing. Honestly I've said it many times I just have no interest in new buyables that are heavily based on existing skills. At least summoning forced you to gather charms rather than be a straight buyable.

No dude, the people who don't like EOC, like me, quit RS3. Also the legacy system is slower than EOC so nobody uses it.
---
you really think jagex went through the effort to make some accounts more lucky than others? it benefits them in no way and requires extra calculations for the creation of any new content and storage of account data larger
---
Just curious where you’ve been looking at them? In the CCs I’m in most people are voting yes. All the people I know IRL are voting yes. Reddit and twitter is generally 50/50, for sure, but most other places/groups seem to be majority yes. I think it’ll be very close to passing at the very least
---
Because that entirely depends on the cost/benefit analysis. Even 2,000 hours of dev/artist time is only maybe ~£100,0000 invested. Onboard a few new players and get an extra ~10,000 months of subscriptions (by the way, the release of mobile probably boosted the game by close to ~500,000 months of extra subscriptions) and you've got instant return on investment. That's before factoring the extra longevity added to the game.
---
You can support them on Patreon [here](https://www.patreon.com/runelite).
---
That’s just another R name with the word Crafting slapped to it... warding is more than just crafting robes too, Magic Imbue sounds cool, but there’s literally a spell already called that.
---
What is warding other than its content? Besides a few total levels
---
My comment: "Something being subjectively un-fun for a single person doesn't make it bad, or bad for the game. Let me address the counter-arguments."
---
Your comment: Lol
---
I mean there's no way anyone accept that fact now, it's a little too late, but outside of the main client being terrible, how is it not? You have access to things that you weren't intended to, a great example of this is the swampletics episode where he can view the tile IDs, and see the part through the temple trekking bog immediately. He even voices his concern and does it properly. It's just weird to see people classify certain features as "cheating" despite them all coming from the same basic principles of how the clients work. You know for sure jagex would rather just say no custom clients then have to decide on a plug-in to plug-in basis what they are okay with, but it's far to late for that now lol. I hate the usage of this term but unpopular opinion
---
No, not necessarily. I would add other criteria. Like having 3k hours played (which is just login time) thats not a lot when people have artificially higher hours when theyre just logged in. This means level 3 skillers or people only pking all day or only pvming all day can easily vote as well. The only thing that matters is that dedicated players have the say in the poll, not 1900 total accounts that have played for 2 months.
---
you dont need graceful
---
Most people that are voting no arent voting no cause its a new skill, but because they don't find the skill appealing at all. Saying that nobody is obligated to train the skill as a reason to blindly vote it in is completely ignorant. Dead, bad content is BAD for the game no matter if you are forced to do it or not. And it being a skill means you will be forced into training it eventually for maxcape, quest reqs etc. Just look at rs3s divination. It offered basicly nothing and was a boring, pointless grind that should have been scrapped, as should warding
---
Have you even read Das Crabital?
---
Wot
---
they are skulled - why cant you skull back, if they are supposedly risking 10k what is stopping you from wearing the same stuff and skulling back on them and beating them with skill if they are so brainless
---
anything that enters the game he plays directly effects him. thats like saying oh why do you care if mtx comes in just dont buy it
---
Yeah. And? A large portion of the player base left, regardless
---
What happened?
---
Which is stupid because the community clearly wants a new skills, as shown in the most recent priority poll.
---
Yeah, I always thought that was weird.
---
thanks for the tip!(:
---
I hear you, I don't hate and want pures to suffer, but I also don't want pures to be able to get something game changing. However they have since changed the blog to say its a 1 time 500 negative xp lamp and that seems okay to me.
---
There’s definitely a couple cases where some rando’s got their bans quashed
---
&gt;still moving of imbuing from NMZ
---
Did you read the updated blog? The ring imbuing is “in addition to” the NMZ imbues, not instead of.
---
you have to give the box to the npc you got it from
---
once you stake the thrill from winning triumphs any in game content to the point you rather stake it all and loose then go play
---
Yeah, not sure. I would like a new skill as well but him mentioning that leaves me wondering if what he said will be true haha.
---
3 more to go
---
I like it, but it needs to be more purple.
---
Not ever cape has to look like Doritos and Mountain Dew.
---
If all they play is lms they won't be here for long anyway. Having variety would keep the game interesting
---
Lol you think I have any opinion whatsoever. Literally have no opinion either way, probably won't even vote. Although, you probably do actually need to play a skill before making a decision. Champ.
---
Congratulations you have not only not answered my question but have also compared a new skill to micro transactions. Truly a big brain player
---
~~in 2019~~
---
Exactly what I thought.
---
Either that, or they have a KPOP girl as their profile picture.
---
Lmao yeah the concepts of what's going in the skill hasn't change at all /s
---
They took out the bits people didnt like  and most people came around to the idea.
---
The remaining people who vote no have no reason beyond not wanting another skill in general it seems like, and that would be a minority. Who doesnt want more content? More metas to learn?
---
Despite only being 13% of the playerbase..
---
one person with 3 tbows could do it
---
with the way ge offers work
---
You have to finish it in one sitting unfortunately. And you should still have the clue involving it who can tell you. 
---
If you are having problems with the puzzle boxes I'd suggest going to the wiki for it, they have a pretty good guide on how to solve them that, for me, trivialized how difficult I used to think they were
---
"Old School community would probably like some sort of well-designed EOC"
---
How out of touch are you? Nobody wants this.
---
Accounts that haven't been played recently this month or the previous months shouldn't be allowed to vote. I'm sure jagex doesn't care tho because they want it pass regardless
---
Isn't it interesting how people with various interest and an overlapping interest actually comment on things? Its almost like the comments were relevant to the OP but not in agreement.   
---
Its interesting how consistently people have common interests yet differing opinions.
---
"Reddit Fornite Babies" sick burn bud. 
---
You also typed a damned book but didnt elaborate with any meaningful explanation as to your side of the arguement, beyond "No, you suck I rule"
---
Those reqs are already there for all those things except rune gloves atm. Jagex reset accounts with 40 to 1 and they cant use b gloves or addy or dragon.
---
That's still not an argument for warding.
---
Additionally, among the people who don't want a new skill ever, there are probably quite a lot of people who are fine with other update. Not having a new skill doesn't mean the game won't evolve; it just won't evolve with new skills.
---
As it stands, many of the existing skills outright suck. I would far *far* prefer to have them updated to be actually good/useful/fun before we even think about new skills. Significant chunks of warding's content can even be used to update some existing skills to that purpose. You get the content and improve the state of current skills without shaking up the game as much as a new skill would. It's a win-win.
---
But what if I don't want to?
---
What does everyone have against purple?
---
I use runelite but if you're that reliant on a client that you can't even play the game, that's pretty sad
---
Dont you think people who play the game for many hours each day that are willing to pay money to get membership on multiple accounts should have a bigger say than the average osrs player who plays 2 hours a week and has 500 total? Theres no rules on voting on multiple accounts, and the small percentage of high level players bonding accounts wont make a big difference compared to the massive influx of new players likely coming from mobile that have gotten their 300 total ready to vote yes to anything
---
The issue is he is saying his end goal was to get 99 in buyables but doesn't understand you can sell gear back to the GE if he actually needs the 500ish mil. 
---
Then he is dismissing that 0.7 dps increase would have saved him 10 hours. 
---
Basically people are ripping him because he dismisses any facts shown to him because he doesn't want to admit he is wrong.
---
yeah agility wont give you any  actual experience congrats you are now lvl 5 street smarts
---
Let's try to fix the shit skills before adding a new shit skill then, yeah?
---
A skill is very groundbreaking. Warding specifically is a very overwhelming skill, they are not proposing adding a simplistic sensible skill like firemaking, its a skill that is going to do a fuckton of stuff so to say that this is just about "having fun or not having fun" is borderline ridiculous when this will permanently change a ton of content in the and dilute a bunch of other stuff. So its not a skill like firemaking that you can just leave alone if you dont want it, because its gonna be omnipresent.
---
Since your "most important" point was about the time difference between getting a better skill after warding is either passed or failed, I was wondering what you thought that time difference was.
---
I'm also trying to demonstrate that voting no because warding isn't your definition of "perfect" isn't in your own best interest.
---
You absolutely should vote how you see fit, I'm just trying to better inform your opinion by demonstrating that you're shooting yourself in the foot if your hope is to have a better skill in the future.
---
The real question is... can I do it while running agility courses? Agility is fucking hard without a second element to distract me from the monotony of Agility. I’m currently high alching stuff for cash, but if Warding presents a new skill to add to agility I’m all in.
---
He’s speaking the language of the gods.
---
Ancient warrior equipment was like "hey remember barrows? Let's do that again but make it more expensive"
---
So that’s why polls are about to go live letting us vote for/against the skill without having played it? We have all the information right now. The poll is tomorrow. The player in the original picture has decided he doesn’t like it based on the exact same information available to everyone, but reddit no like that.
---
Crabitalism is private ownership of the means of production and exchange.

"Classes" are arbitrary, vague, and do not match up with the nuanced reality of everyday life.

Amazing.

Oooh that's good at least. I didn't see that at first.
---
probably dead lol, kept me out of a lot of drugs and violence in my area. my mom used to bitch at me (like all of us) for always being on the computer and never going out with friends, and now a lot of those friends are dead, in jail, or doing activities that will lead them to such.

Blowpipe is so lame to BiS range weapon is some kind of teal trumpet. I hate using it. Nothing about the damned thing screams OP ranged weapon. It's a fucking blowpipe...
---
Now ballista. There's a cool ranged weapon imo. Heavy duty, solid ranged weapon 🔫
---
Excessive advantage. What a joke. You really going to pitch a fit that Johnny Randomguy can complete his Arceuus favor slightly faster than someone else? Now I’ve seen it all. This is peak “if I had to suffer, so should you” mentality.
---
How about making the wildy like it used to be? The wildy used to be the most exciting thing in runescape now it's been replaced by deadmanmode. How about account security and authenticator delay? Nah let's get a new skill we totally need that.. As far as i'm concerned there are major core updates that the game needs before a new skill. Account security should be the #1 priority..
---
Ok 100k isn’t a small amount of money to invest in ideas that have repeatedly failed. I’m just saying that they’re literally spending time on proposing new skills that could be spent elsewhere. 2000 hours is 250 work days. Pretty much a full year of work. Why keep spending that much time on ideas that have regularly failed polls? While everyone may want a new skill, why would jagex feel confident at all that they can get one passed if this one fails? They can’t just keep going at it when they have other projects they want to work on too.
---
The polls were chosen to be 75% yes to pass for a reason, otherwise literally everything would pass. 3 people with alts voting yes and 1 person with alts voting no is the same thing as 3 people without alts voting yes and 1 person without alts voting no
---
Lets leave the socio-ethical jabs at modern society at ease, this is Runescape, not a parliament. Lets call them what they are, assholes who dont want their game to change too much, because they think their taste should guide the direction of RS.
---
I got one around 2500 kc and that happened several times to me lol! With the rl  plugins it helps bc it shows the lines were aggro would be lost
---
Now that Battle Wards is dead, I agree. I think that was the biggest turn-off for people, so hopefully they know that those aren't a thing anymore.
---
Graceful is overrated tbh. Afternplaying a few accounts that cant us it, it really doesnt help that much beyond weight reduction. Its set effect often isnt worth taking imo.
---
[It's intentional.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/524i9s/demon_butler_follows_you_when_using_poh_fairy_ring/d7hcbx5/)
---
C
---
Fuck off, I can think 10 better songs.
---
Yes, so? I'm not saying Warding should not be added.
---
Been playing rs3 a couple months actually, and that's just an event. You cant deduce the entire experience through an event that is working towards a new land, so understandably itll be a good one
---
Where are the options being presented?
---
No, of course they shouldn't, that's how you subvert a democratic process. I urge you to look at my last comment, do you think rich people IRL should have the ability to have more votes in government elections because they pay more taxes and provide more for the economy?
---
How about stop trying to make this game rs3.5 and work on fixing and improving the things we have or need
---
Bring a weapon and kill it
---
Not sure, definitely one of the tasks that sticks out the most
---
So its hear say....
---
That's the main reason I like the sound of warding. It's a logical step like smithing is for melee and crafting is for range.
---
But when they first introduced it, it was a heavy "fuck no" for me when I got to the Battle Ward section. They removed that part, so now I don't really see a problem with it.
---
Do you want a video or what? Enabled or disabled I get consistently worse FPS on RuneLite. Official client is a smooth and steady 50 at all times.
---
You have it backwards, I don't want it because I don't want ANY new skills, but if it were to pass it's not that bad of a skill if it was forced on me.
---
"Im maxed so even though itll help flesh out low and mid game, fuck that"
---
It's still their right to have an opinion.. how stupid it might be
---
Because it's the core of osrs, also, Warding will encourage you to craft items at specific Wards around the world, so technically if you follow the core of the skill you will not bankstand.
---
Charging your phone to full!
---
Why?
---
Ancients didn't exist in 2002
---
I've thought extensively about such a feature, its so obvious to me that I assume there are tons of reasons why it isn't in the game.
---
You neglected to cover how this feature will function in pvp deaths, though In my idea of this feature the items could instantly be returned to the bank if the player entered a pvp zone. Keeping the items safe, while not affording them any more advantage by letting them use the item with no risks.
---
My point is that a bad skill hurts the game more than things such a bad minigame, because it is a skill and it locks certain things such as max cape behind it. Very few people are voting no purely because they dont want to train another skill to max, but because they dont like warding. 
---
"No skill is ever going to get added" 
---
Sailing literally got to like 70% before mobile release back when the community was way more conservative. If the osrs team pushed sailing as hard as they are with warding, and post mobile release it would most likely pass, because sailing at least offered some gameplay that seemed interesting.
---
You seem to highly inflate how many people in this game are maxed. Theres only just over 7000 maxed players, meanwhile theres hundreds of thousands of low level, new players from mobile release that are going to have just as big of a say as an account with thousands of hours of gametime.
---
Let him play how he wants to play who cares.
---
That is amazing haha
---
Yeah. I know. I was in no way saying you couldn't do that, not was I denying that people who pay more have more voting power. 
---
What I'm saying is that it's STILL scummy. Yes, people DO have that ability to use their multiple accounts to gain favor in their votes, and it's in no way illegal.
---
What I was saying, was that despite the fact that people can do it, it's seen as scummy, and for a good reason. It lends to the idea that you can basically throw money at votes, which is pretty unbalanced towards an idea of a fair polling system which is what a grand majority of people want
---
I apologise that my other earlier posts weren't clear enough on this
---
Voting no
---
There's a [recent blog post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/warding-blog?oldschool=1#_ga=2.81797206.1742510158.1563458980-91101591.1547226588) on the old school website that you can read. It will give you a good rundown of what warding would entail.
---
I enjoy watching him. His deadman content was entertaining... But it’s moreover because of the fact he’s absolutely hopeless lol. There’s something morbidly curious about watching another person spiral deeper and deeper into a hole they cannot escape from.
---
Dude 130kc 1 hilt in my name and no weapon splits :( gimme your luck plz
---
&gt; Because over 75% of players agreed that the updates should be added
---
Thank you captain obvious! As if I didnt know that already. 
---
&gt; I played in 2013 when osrs was re-released. The game was fun again, but became stagnant quickly. And not just for me, for a lot of people. Look at the graph data for the player count. 2013 - early 2014 the player count was drastically falling
---
The playercount dropped for a lot of reasons. For example, alone the uncertainty that the game wouldnt stay worried players and made them not wanna put in the same amount of time they otherwise would, its a self fulfilling prophecy. Updates that really contributed to maintaining and spiking a consistently higher player count was Grand Exchange and Free-to-Play, F2p automatically keeps the playercount higher. Leading up to that you had 14 relatively big updates that had no significance on the playercount, so all you bring up is a big hoax. You also fail to address what difference it would have made if an update had taken a different form or if we had a different update in its place. What if Zulrah didnt spit out every resource ever? Would Zulrah have been bad? What if blowpipe wasnt 1 tick faster than polled? Would this have been bad? What if Zulrah didnt render fishing and resource gathering completely useless? As you can see, Zulrah may be a fun boss to kill but Zulrah could have taken many many different and much better forms. Current player count doesnt take long term consequences into account. Because updates usually shrinkens the life expectancy of the game. Its not without consequences to make updates. Player count also isnt indicative of a better game. Fortnite has a higher player count than RS, shouldnt you be playing that? It must mean its better! 
---
&gt; There is no above average priced balanced mage gear. So back to my point about warding. 
---
Yes there is. But lets just say theres a need for an averaged priced balanced mage gear then that should be added to a boss and not be given a whole new skill, rofl. 
---
Then you go on to say that "it would be good for pking" but all warding is gonna do is adding a ton of welfare magic sets like dragonhide armour for ranged that pking really doesnt need, its terrible for pking and terrible for the game in general. 
---
&gt; They're ran by a corporation who's main goal is to make money.
---
Thanks again captain obvious. They have successfully managed to do that with MTX. Im not a shareholder, so I see zero benefit from the company making more money. If OSRS made 1/100 of what it does currently it would still be succesful and very much alive. It doesnt need to make half of what it makes now.
---
&gt; You wouldnt have this game if they werent so dedicated to it.
---
Yes I would have. I voted to have this game 7~ years ago and then we got it. It had nothing to do with any dedication or the lack thereof.
---
&gt; You can vote no to a new skill, but in reality, the one killing the game is you.
---
Im the one saving the game. Im the garden of tranquility and belligerent in the global war on easyscape, the messiah and liberator of RuneScape.
---
&gt; And you say the skill doesnt make sense? How doesnt it? We can make metal armor.. and leather armor... but not magic armor? If no skills have made sense, then what the fuck makes sense to you?
---
[I have pointed out why it doesnt make sense here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ce2yyj/why_i_will_be_voting_no_to_warding/)
---
Might as well not vote at all then if you ask me.
---
There are a few items that are useful for high-levels if that is all you're interested in.
---
The first armor set, Pado's, is actually insanely strong. It has a low Magic Attack Bonus, it gives +28 Prayer and increases damage on Zamorak creatures by 10%. That makes it a very strong prayer armor and better than BiS Gear like Ancestral and Imbued Capes against most Zamorak foes. Thammaron's is similarly strong if you ever mage in the Wilderness; unlike Sceptre this should work with trident too but it would always risk a piece. Most of the rest of the armors seem targeted at lower levels or PvP though.
---
Aside from armor, the Skilling Rings would be helpful if you ever do gathering skills. Incantations would create a new BiS Magic item and give you more Magic Attack for PvM. The upgraded Rune Pouch holds an extra rune which could save you inventory with bossing. And the Fused Essence Pouch would be a small buff to RC. There is also other stuff like Guild and Minigame which should give useful rewards based on the full design doc.
---
Additional armor for pure pking?
---
Agree with everything you said besides the korasi. fuck that sword.
---
also they need to make sure you cant go below your quested attk/def/range/mage/str/hp and i'm all for it.
---
honestly The only people who use alts for that are the ones who are hyper efficient. I think I've only ever seen 1 or maybe 2 alts bring stuff to gwd. The only time i really see alts common place is when people barrage/burst nechs
---
Got it, as will ever person on this subreddit.
---
Downvoting for fishing for upvotes.
---
Right i understand that de valuing ahrims but as i said why cant they make things that you add to say ahrims which degrade faster or the items themselves its an item skin etc just feel like these amours are terrible ancestral is decent and so it should be given its ability’s etc but why would any high level player vote for this just feels like dead content amours imo
---
Lesser of two evils, frankly.
---
\&gt;Warding would fix the inconsistency that’s in the game **right now**.
---
Or, and hear me out on this one, they could fix the game without adding a new skill.
---
Ive read it. It looks like crafting and runecrafting. Will be voting no.
---
I honestly would just have more free time and wasted it on something else.  Nothing really particularly positive or negative has come out  this game for me.
---
Your also joking about suicide which is sooo funny. Props to you my guy I bet your a riot in 10th grade.
---
You need to go to youtube and type in "osrs pking loot" if you think that its a waste of time. 
---
Ive killed people that were completely naked in the wild that had accidentally withdrawn their cash stack before going out to kill green drags or catch chins twice. Once for 7m gp and once for 4m gp, if that has happened to me twice, imagine how often it happens over the whole game? Pking is a numbers game, it works out to be small kills/hr in normal circumstances.. But every once in a long while you get the whale. The AGS smite, an accidental skuller with max gear, the pissed off anti pker who skulled up, etc. The off chance of a big one is what makes pkers carry on. If you dont get it or simply wouldnt want to invest that kind of time, that's completely fine but when did you become the arbiter of how people spend their time on video games? Also, what makes you qualified to tell anyone that they are wasting time on a video game that was created for the purpose of wasting time? Because I think you may be surprised about what comes off as the more moronic activity.
---
No Adamant Bucket Helm - No Party.
---
For learning and getting some completions, you'll can start. It won't be the most efficient.
---
However, you'll certainly want some more equipment to make the runs and learning easier. You'll probably want to eventually get some defense reduction for CoX, as that's basically what you'll use your spec on 90% of the time. Prayer levels for unlocking rigour would be very nice, and dragon defender/boots/xbow with dragon bolts if you plan on grinding things out. I'm not sure on the exact numbers, but I think ahrims is going to be strongly preferred over void mage as well.
---
78 Herb is going to be very beneficial for making your own brews (90 herb is not a req for soloing if you look for overload dropping enemies).
---
There's also the obvious, eventually getting 99 strength and 99 mage to increase your damage output.
---
I totally know where you're coming from! I always find weird tidbits of info and want to discuss them with someone. Occasionally I'll make a post like that (or see one from someone else) and one or two people will get super into it.
---
I really think warding would be fun :(
---
I’m fairly certain they turn into coins if they’re not protected.
---
You just answered your own question brother:
---
&gt; Why is everyone telling me this
---
&gt; The easy way of getting things
---
But I respect your playstyle.
---
Downvoting.
---
Good job my guy!
---
I believe the one to get Ghostly robes has you go into the wilderness a couple times.
---
Cool didn't think of that. I'll go earn 100k-300k an hour doing collection skills and think that's worth it because I gathered the items myself turning a 40 hour skill into a 500 hr skill instead of just grinding raids for 20 hours. 
---
Bankstanding buyable isn't fun. This isn't how you attract players. You can add the content and balance changes without forcing this stuff.
---
definitely still copying, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. its certainly not stealing, anyhow
---
rigour will make a HUGE difference in your raids experience with how much ranging is done
---
RuneLite OSRS &gt; RS3 &gt; Vanilla Client OSRS is what I’m getting from this? 😂
---
No it's literally from jagex?
---
There is a cc for shield of arrav/heroes. I think it may even be joinable from the mini game tab.
---
Ding ding ding we have a winner, no skill addition would be optimal.
---
I'd probably go with the cbow since it's less expensive (I think) and my range is significantly higher than my melee stats. But tbh unless I sold anguish and torture plus camp vork for 2 weeks I don't think getting that type of money is realistic atm. Gonna attempt to afford rigour and test it out! All of the replies to this question has made me a bit more optimistic about it tbh!
---
Oh ok
---
In your opinion.
---
Got hooked and spending too much time might be an understatement lol
---
This is my universe
---
I want the music from RS3 in osrs so badly. The live productions that play in major cities are beautiful.
---
&gt;	I think they look awful and would hate to see them in the default client.
---
Even if it was optional?
---
I don't think you understand how RuneScape works
---
There is a gap there for sure. I pk occasionally in a small team using mystics but I’m too bad and too poor to use ahrims. Risk roughly 600k on death (not including my +1) and I die semi-often, wouldn’t be adverse to bringing that risk up to 1m or so with slightly better mage robes (so robes are half my risk at about 500k~) but there is nothing that fills that gap.
---
might as well kill a few goblins for 5gp while ur at it
---
Seriously, stop. This sub has become quite a shitter, let people have their own opinions before calling people who you disagree with "neckbeards". Everyone has their own reason of liking/disliking the skill. Also, just as a reminder https://i.imgur.com/F516gX8.png a lot of people seem to disregard this.
---
Just like most things in settings, it could be toggleable. I just find it extremely irritating that there is like 3 animated motions in attack animation or for eg; woodcutting. It makes game look so buggy. Even the newest bosses look like big piles of lag.
---
Ofc its personal preference. + Jagex promised gpu rendering years ago and still not delivered.
---
A few use it but most (myself included) use the castle wars top or just monk robe top
---
Many skills could've been scrapped into different skills, the difference is that Warding has potential to be it's own  skill imo.
---
Also, i can't really understand how you don't find Warding engaging when it's basically utulize the essense of what osrs is about.
---
&gt; There is obviously the scenario where if you are hacked and wearing your best gear, you could just be made to skull in the wildy and lose the items that way, though I'm sure we can refine or expand upon the idea to help mitigate the likelihood of that.
---
Sorry I added the above text after posting. I believe making it so you need a PIN to cross into the wildy or teleport to the wildy with a protected item is a suitable workaround.
---
But I'm not in different I would rather not have the skill, so how would not voting help me achieve that.
---
some drop from a boss ig
---
I mean, when there are people saying 'I don't even play RS anymore but I'm getting a bond to vote no' it's pretty ridiculous.
---
Remember the last time Jagex did a MASSIVE update to revive the playerbase even with a 5 month beta
---
 hint: EoC.
---
Look how well that turned out!
---
Voting no. This is oldschool
---
Alright cool, I think that'll be the plan. Only 50ish mill so with vork and revs it shouldn't take too long. Thank you!
---
I really hope i get to go next year :( this set list was probably my favorite and im so bummed i couldn't go
---
Wym? What skill could possibly exist that lets you turn ~~Xerician fabric~~ *special silk cloth* into magical armor at the moment?
---
Doesn't matter if it's politics or as little as a childrens medieval game; hypocracy is everywhere
---
Clicking the "X" to close the client, the game will log you out after 90 seconds even if still in combat, also, if the dragon dies before those 90 seconds, the game will log you out immediately after killing it, skipping the need to be out of combat for 10 seconds(Need to have closed client for at least 10 seconds for the skipping part.).
---
Explained better here: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Logout_button
---
Easy example is that they promised GPU rendering for Computer clients years ago (They said it would come with mobile), but here we are, runescape hogging just one core from our CPUs.
---
The mocking isnt all unreasonable.
---
\&gt;It's disheartening as a player that warding is the best update they can think of for OSRS right now.
---
I feel this.
---
&gt; So wait, regardless of whether or not you have to do the content to play how you want to, just acknowledging it is the problem? The fact that you'll see it and see other people doing it?
---
What? Depending on your goals you have to do it regardless, you cant ignore skills when theyre implemented. But thats not my point. When you say yes to warding you say yes to everything thats warding gonna do and add, theyre not gonna add a dead skill with no content, warding offers an overwhelming unnecessary amount of content, you cant just ignore content lol. Its part of the game.
---
&gt; Well, in that case, I agree you can't ignore it, but that doesn't really connect the dots for me as to why it shouldn't be added.
---
Its bad for that very reason and shouldnt be added? 
---
&gt; The point I was making is that it existing won't negatively impact your experience, regardless of whether or not you choose to train it. 
---
Yes it will negatively impact my experience, I cant ignore warding when its been added to the game, it has a tremendous effect on a lot of content, you cant ignore that. 
---
&gt; But if just seeing it in-game negatively impacts you, then I'm not really sure that's the game's fault.
---
Yes thats the games fault. And the players for voting it in. And JageX for polling it.
---
I have more Karma than you... I'm not fishing, I just wanted to Gage if people actually got it. A lot of new players might not.
---
Would you care to go into more details about your decidion?
---
They don’t need a new skill to fix anything
---
Man you guys just want everything don’t you. Do you suppose we vote yes on absolutely everything just because it’s new? Grow up dude
---
Nobody gets excited about training herblore or crafting dude. This is crafting with extra steps.
---
I dont like the animation smootherer, but i like the further distance view and agility boxes etc
---
Yes people shit on every new idea. This is not healthy for the game.
---
Nice. I'm happy for you. Setting goals is so important to long time scaping and staying interested to the game
---
&gt;	RuneLite Plus
---
I’m confused, how is this different than RuneLite? Is it made by the same people?
---
Colour scheme is correct
---
And also a PIN to world hop to pvp I assume, definetly strikes me as something very messy and fun to code.
---
Finally a good warding post.
---
Lance is about 30mil cheaper than dhcb, which is why I recommended it :) You could also sell more stuff to get dhcb,and use that for quicker Vorkath kills tbh.
---
Or maybe people just want a different skill other than Warding to enter the game
---
Everything i say is in my opinion as long as i don't claim im stating a fact.
---
Ive been attacked when running to the lever but never fallen. Log out buttons op.
---
The absolute state of yes voters. People have stated why they don't want the skill over and over. Why do you need to have it specifically explained for you? Read the downvoted comments on the warding blog.
---
and Runelite doesnt have to do anything to help with that optimization. Its opensource project and its doesnt have to do anything. Jagex is a real company that owns runescape.
---
For some reason Runelite is more popular than regular client by far these days.
---
me either, feels good right?
---
Its way too obvious how conflicting warding is on the osrs community,
---
it will never get to 75% because of this alone, not because people have 10 alts.
---
no, the 1 vote will be enough.
---
Learn how to use punctuation properly you fuckin tryhard
---
&gt; Hi, Noexi here :D
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Just thought i'd make an account on here to let you know i'm not voting NO just so it won't make my 200M all grind longer. I actually enjoy skilling and wouldn't mind it taking longer. Hence why alot of HLC members have been asking to nerf certain methods.
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; I do however vote no because I ask myself: Why does OSRS need a new skill? - simply, it doesn't. OSRS will continue to, and has always, existed without a new skill and has been a thriving game ever since release. Ask yourself that instead of "Why not?".
---
&gt; Is it really sad though that people who spend extra time playing and making multiple accounts use them to vote? I hope you find a something in your future where you are just as passionate about it as I (and other players) are about OSRS staying OSRS, and not letting history repeat itself and let it go down the road of RS3.
---
&gt; Have a nice day! :)
---
Ever since the OSBuddy/runelite lawsuit fiasco I’ve just played the classic client. Don’t really mind it at all and I don’t think it takes away from any enjoyment I get playing the game
---
No
---
&gt;  basically would have eliminated any choice you had when it comes to skilling 
---
A myth. Slayer only does that because in the process of maxing that you get 99s in all combats (not true in the current meta either). Meanwhile theres a shit tonne of skills and 99 artisan could easily just be a bump in the road to maxing those.
---
How about skill rework people suggest instead of warding? I haven't heard anything other than literally that sentence
---
Total level to vote needs to be 1k minimum.
---
WRONG.
---
just because there isn't anything in the 80+ tier for the skill doesn't mean it wont be there later. Mentality like this is why we will never get a 100% flushed out skill in this game. As look at blog 2 and the pre blog 3 text dump all he stuff over lvl 80 was removed for being better than ahrims and rivaling ancestral in their %dmg buff monster/creature zones. It is easier for them to poll the bulk of a skill to get it to pass and then poll the end their questionable stuff later to flush it out cause as it stands no skill will ever be fully flushed out due to player nostalgia or people who cry about devaluing something else in the game
---
amazing troll work
---
Personally think there is a lot more they can add to the game than something so divisive. 
---
Rare fossils don’t have a use in the game, imagine how exciting a new release for a fossil island boss would be and how much people would love that.
---
Either way I’ll be voting no for a number of reasons, and I hate being grouped into this “I don’t want a new skill” category, I’d love a new skill, just not warding.
---
Strange way of spelling Flute Salad.
---
Great, so you recognize things can have examples and reasons for changing the game negatively. Do you see now how “any new skill bad always” makes much less sense?
---
One of my worst fears right here.
---
They are also polling it for the community to decide what to do with it... They are also opening beta testing and open to changes that the community is looking for... They've done this before, even.
---
I mean, I literally don't like Slayer as is in the game right now, but its theme and reward structure is not bad. It does add variety to training combat skills, but it's painfully slow and inefficient still because you're either using sub-optimal gear, or fighting mobs with high defenses.
---
That being said it came with the package that is OSRS so I don't mind.
---
Warding on the other hand I can't shake as being just a subsection of magic. You could strip enchanting from magic, make the new skill "Enchanting", and literally everyone would understand it. But Warding rubs people the way Divination does in RS3; vague name for a mystical/ magical skill where you do a contrived activity involving magic mcguffins.
---
At least with shit like Sailing or Bard you understand on the tin what it could entail in terms of activities/ training.
---
&gt;league  
---
&gt;free  
---
Holy shit dude.
---
Smoke Battlestaff if you can afford it, Book of Darkness, Seers' ring,  Mystic, Light Mystic, Dark Mystic, Dusk Mystic, Enchanted or Darkness hat (they're all the same.. Vote yes to Warding btw), 3rd age amulet if you can afford it, amulet of glory.
---
Yeah sure, not publically.
---
Impacting him is not the same as _negatively_ impacting him though, and the question was asking how it would negatively impact him.
---
League mtx aren't pure cosmetic
---
Same but with 1375
---
Don’t think so
---
Yes, because it means IRL rich players have the greatest say, regardless of outcome, which is shitty
---
Java?
---
in regards to?
---
I am pretty sure that’s what they proposed in the first blog
---
&gt;  since RuneLite is open source you can be sure your RS login is safe
---
Do you compile Runelite yourself after inspecting the code? If not it's not safe. Just because the source is available doesn't mean the downloadable executable was made from it.
---
yee bro
---
Everyone keeps spewing this like everyone voting no has tons of alts but people that vote yes don't?
---
Like, what?
---
Slayer the most enjoyed skill among the player base. If it isn't supposed to be like slayer and still isn't acceptably "fun" to you, then what is comparable in your view?
---
Also: Claiming "straw man" because you can't comprehend a counter point is, ironically, a straw man.
---
Just to say, these are the people that vote no to all updates. It’s not just that it’s a new skill
---
Ignoring all the reasons to vote no is just as bad as ignoring the reasons to vote yes. Cunt
---
I also mentioned it’s barely better than ahrims and barrows isn’t even CLOSE to endgame. A morytania Locked UIM did it with like 60 combat lol
---
This is such bullshit, majority of the people I see voting no and open to a new skill, they just don’t want warding.
---
What is wrong with that?
---
Obviously, you don't know how to read. It has been 24 hours and I haven't received a tracking number. Also, I chose 2 day shipping.
---
&gt;Jagex decides the rules for their game
---
And clearly they haven’t ruled that the Arceuus library plugin violates their rules. RuneLite has removed plugins in the past that Jagex said broke their rules (Jad, Zulrah, etc) without issue. 
---
So literally you’re trying to enforce your own rules on the rest of the playerbase, and that’s not fair. What you find enjoyable I might hate, and what I enjoy you may find boring. 
---
Also, how petty do you have to be that other people’s accomplishments “de-value” your own. It’s attitudes like this that mean well never see a meaningful Runecrafting skill rebalance. “If I had to suffer, you should too” is a terrible attitude to have about, as you like to point out, **a game**.
---
Nop only for future imbues
---
Hey bath girl, start of as a collector, its pretty straightforward
---
As I said I don't mind the *risk*, hell forced skulling I could agree with on certain activities.  It's the attitude I have a problem with.
---
join a clan and learn to pvm, it is way better than warding. I promise
---
How infinite money pls
---
Lmk when Elon Musk buys bonds on 120,000 alts and then decides the outcome of every poll personally
---
Hell yeah you are
---
This sub has gotten so divisive over issues like this... implying 'wrong' or 'right' on matters of opinion.... Both toxic and great communities exist in every large group of people. So tired of seeing these 'straw man' overgeneralized posts.
---
I think if they re-worked artisan to where instead of getting random skilling tasks to get xp, you could tell a master “look, im gonna go cut redwoods from 90-99 wc and I want some artisain xp along they way”. This way you could train skills they way you want doing the methods you want. However, add this alongside the tasks, and if you were to simply do all tasks the master would assign you would get more xp in the artisan skill rather than telling him what your gonna do. And maybe bonus xp for every task completed. That way, the quickest way to level the skill would be to do the tasks, but if you don’t like being forced to make 2k bronze platebodies at 90+ smithing ya dont have too.
---
Join the runelite discord and ask there
---
I read all posts and watch all Q&amp;As. I havent missed a single one in 6 years.
---
Nice art style. It’d be fun to see a series of your character progressing in raids gear. Like next time she’s in a neitz and torso with defender etc.
---
No problem!
---
Making it easier isn't cheating.
---
for clarification i can only enter the runescape website from google and if i try downloading the client then i can't open the website as well
---
is runescape banned in israel or some shit
---
its still trash
---
It isnt. Slayer, as a skill, incentivizes killing random mobs that would normally have zero incentive to kill otherwise. Skilling, on the other hand, should have an incentive in of itself to engage in - and is far more varied in its individual skills. 
---
Training combat through slayer isn't really a big deal as all combat skills are more or less trained the same way, with the exception of magic/range somewhat. All skills in Runescape barring those are vastly different in terms of gameplay. 
---
Lets say I want to get 99 hunter. I want some money to jump-start my account and enjoy hunter as a skill. But, wait - in order to train efficiently now I have to do artisan. Instead of just being able to train the skill I want to train, I'm essentially compelled to do skills I dont want to do to train the skill I do want to do. It's bad game design. Macroefficiency is far more interesting and compelling without artisan than with it.
---
I too would love dungeoneering to come back. Raids isn't even close to the same thing
---
Obviously you can’t read because I said it hasn’t been shipped ans you can’t get a tracking number until it’s shipped you fucking tard. Wait 3 - 5 days then go cry kid
---
details, details
---
As long as it fits in with the old school feel I think it's fine to add skills
---
what kind of low life has 8 alts lmfao
---
I did this method lol he was very happy to assist
---
Grinding stats?
---
Warding just doesn't look intriguing enough to grind. If it always existed, I wouldn't give a shit. But I hope you understand the significance of adding a brand new skill to the OSRS experience. People mark eras in runescape by the introduction of skills- that shit is both hype and game changing.
---
Warding just doesn't seem to be the one to do it for me. I'd rather have a pass on this, roll the dice, and see what other skill we could pitch.
---
No imbues will not be removed from players they will remain in both NMZ and warding and at a future time they will poll the removal of imbues from NMZ.
---
It was originally blogged with some op items, OSRS community said no, Jagex came back with a new blog last week with a new blog... a lot of changes were made voted by the Osrs community... I think the blog looks good... but clearly Osrs is still in oppression.
---
Google Silven's NMZ guide. It's not that long and describes the three strategies for how to get maximum XP, maximum points, and/or maximum afk time. 
---
Generally wear Dharok's, bring a ton of absorption potions, and sit at 1hp
---
You'd fit right in over at r/gatekeeping
---
Lmao
---
Solomon's General Store   /s
---
You're probably thinking of RuneLite Plus, I'm only referring to the main RuneLite branch
---
\&gt;Holy shit this dumb argument
---
Glad we can have this civil conversation.
---
\&gt;Let's add all melee combat skills into one. Let's add fletching and  smithing into crafting. Let's add FM to cooking. Let's combine hunter  and slayer and also herblore and farming.
---
Except those skills all exist. The discussion isn't "how can we streamline all our skills into the smallest number possible?" It's "does this new skill deserve to be added?" And to that, I answer "no."
---
\&gt;Warding has enough content for being a seperate skill
---
**Strongly** disagree.
---
Warding bad
---
Why is warding bad?
---
Remember to go out and vote yes. There's way more of us than them.
---
I'm conflicted because I would like a more "fun" skill than Warding ideally, but pretty much every skill idea has something that 25% of people will bitch about, so you wonder what will *ever* pass
---
Resources?
---
Thanks for sharing, no one cares.  There are other ways to train just bankstanding will be the super expensive but quick way
---
More like someone not understanding that people have different opinions.
---
What a roller coaster
---
idk, looking at the warding doc it looks super interesting and feels old school to me.
---
I don't know of any other game that'd allow people to use addons that trivialized hard content. All addons that for example made it easy to avoid boss mechanics were banned and broken by Blizzard.
---
I don't see the problem. It sounds kinda fun, will probs improve other skills such as farming and hunter. bring a bunch of new quests and locations too!
---
I’ll take your advice and ignore this reddit post, back to being influenced by you tubers it is
---
I never understood the fact that we are getting free additional content in a new skill. Whether you level it or not is your choice but your opinion alone shouldn't deter fun for other players
---
I mean, I enjoy crafting/smithing, but that's because I specifically go out and farm all the materials myself. I understand people not particularly enjoying that content as opposed to PVP/PVM content, but the skill seems not out of place, so I don't seen having it hurting people who don't enjoy production skills while it will be good content for those who do.
---
People are generalizing in /r/2007scape???
---
I’m voting yes with all 30 of my revenant bot accounts
---
lmfao what a grease bomb. NOO MOM I CAN'T LEAVE THE CHAIR YET
---
Okay, you still don't get it.
---
&gt; someone who has membership on 1 account is not paying the same as someone who has membership on 10 accounts. 
---
Correct, but my issue is that one person with more than one account gets more than one vote. My opinion is one player, one vote, because these other accounts are played by the same individual who is making the same decision which inflates the voting process.
---
&gt; you already agree that people who pay should have votes and f2p people shouldnt, you have 0 ethical problems with that even though it is exactly richer = influencing polls. 
---
I never said this. I said that someone who is F2P shouldn't reasonably have a vote because they are not affected by the polls whereas a P2P-player is. Making the extension that one person with several P2P-accounts should have more votes is completely contradictory to what I've commented in the past. The issue is that these accounts will vote the same way because they are controlled by the same owner, which effectively is buying votes.
---
You got 99 farming in RS in 2006? I don't even know if I ever met someone with 99 farming once when I played from 05-07.
---
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
---
No one suggested that you goof, just described what it's contents were.   "warding has enough content for being a seperate skill" is not a fact, it's your opinion, and not very effectively communicated if you want people to change their minds tbh.
---
You really should remember your mom's birthday.
---
Well that’s fucking weird then good luck with your haunted computer m8 👻
---
I don't play video games actively for almost a year already - real life is too good. I only played before for 1 month due to a serious injury at gym and I can allow such vacations.

I’ve always liked Bandos
---
They wouldn't be able to do that anyways, since they have to respect the outcomes of a poll.
---
Honesty I would love playing Ironman but I want a max main 1st.

Yeh there are rc bots that wear full rune and are around 40-50 combat

“If you don’t protect your account the way jagex pleads for you to do then your account may be at risk”
---
222 barrows chests for a k coif HAHAHA FUCK ME RIGHT?
---
How would you recommend starting?
---
Please consider donating some spare change on their patron. They're only getting like 500 bucks a month. It's pretty sad, considering what they do and how many players use it.
---
While his idea is unrealistic and wouldn't happen, how is that voter suppression? Everyone would be allowed to vote, they just wouldn't be able to use a bunch of alts to vote a bunch of times. Everyone should only get 1 vote. This wouldn't be denying anyone that vote, it would be stopping people from abusing the system.
---
I disagree with your implication that opinions can not be wrong.  Opinions CAN be wrong and the opinion that improving the spell icons was bad, was wrong.
---
The Imbues will be attainable via NMZ _or_ Warding for the time being.
---
It's just easier to Jagex to remove the Imbues from the reward shop if they already exist somewhere else first. I do not think the Imbues will be removed from the rings.
---
Since leveing from the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cdrsxh/i_too_made_some_elemental_runes_for_everyone_to/?st=jy8x6pfu&amp;sh=4e23fa95), I've been able to craft more elemental runes per rune essences.
---
This is actually very fun to do. [Album here](https://imgur.com/a/oV72kcy) contains the steps and some low effort memes.
---
I'd say my runecrafting is 60 now, I do plan on making the whole rune set before stopping.
---
If they took all player feedback ,they would drop it before the polls, like they did with """"PARTNERSHIPS"""""".
---
ye maybe. I'd vote yes to dungeoneering without the chaotic rewards, because that sounds F U N. Warding is a tumor.
---
Not all champions are equal. Most of the time, though, you can one trick any champion and carry all the same.
---
But yes, I am 100% telling you that having all the champions isn't an advantage at all. It just outright isn't.
---
Your main point (read: first) was relating to ancestral.
---
Sorry if I came across as pissy, I'm over-caffeinated and under-slept from being up too late doing ToB -_-
---
This isnt Lynx titan tho
---
Because it's an efficient way for serious people to sway the votes to favour their interests. If you're so passionate about the skill, create alts yourself
---
You're shortminded as fuck and your thought process leaves a lot to be desired.
---
Animation smoother is for betas
---
"nOt efFecTivElY coMuniCaTed" suck my fucking dick you spastic.
---
Could just make a flag that doesn’t let u go into any pvp situation with account bound items
---
For me 2008.. just post hd update
---
What I don’t understand is how the mobile version is so smooth compared to the desktop  version. Yet it doesn’t compromise the animation
---
Just because all the old skill suck doesn't mean new one should be as well. Those skill were design 20 years ago we should aim for better skills.
---
Most likely increase. Since you can take them apart for materials, the demand for them will increase.
---
At the very least Mystic won't go down, it's already at alch price.
---
If it adds BIS gear, skill bad, powercreep
---
If it doesn’t add BIS gear, skill bad, useless
---
In other words, skill always bad
---
Yeah you all are fear mongering on Reddit but most players will say yes to it and it will pass.
---
I'm 1710 and started when mobile came out too, not even really trying to be efficient just playing the game, setting small achievable goals and varying my tasks.

Bullying because he has another point of view and attempted to interact by explaining himself? How pathetic.
---

---
Well definitely add something to it and not just the date itself
---
Don't try arguing with these brainlets, they're a lost hope.
---
So keep in mind that if you vote  against Warding, you're likely voting in favor of permanently locking in  OSRS' skill count at 23."
---
Flawed "blackmail" logic
---
Closer i think i like the darker colours
---
I don't like this either, but it's the reality of running a business. You put in resources and you need to get an added value or you'll end up bankrupt. The problem is not the new content, it's the 75% majority that is going to block all ambitious updates. 66% majority would be better IMO and only use a qualitative majority of 75% on content that changes the core of the game like MTX and combat mechanics like what EOC did.
---
Doesn't matter. Zezima is still daddy.
---
Thank god.
---
Obviously no, you fucking donut. But I would be in favor of gradual updates that are unrelated to inferno directly that ultimately make the experience slightly easier than it was a year ago. 
---
Let’s say that a new weapon gets added that deals more damage to tzhaar. I wouldn’t pitch a fit because inferno got slightly easier.
---
(D)
---
Only being able to do it in a particular location reminds me of runecracfting, so it works, but can potentially slow it down a ton. But, that can be worth it to make it more fun.
---
To be clear, I am not anti-new skills, or anti updates. I want osrs to change and grow and thats all well and good.
---
I think that a skill change is a huge, monumental game changer. In its current supposed implementation, warding is:
---
Shit.
---
Fix it or don't add it. This shouldn't be a divisive issue for players. We ALL WANT THE GAME TO BE EVEN BETTER. Its not so much that we disagree with each other about how to achieve that as much as its Jagex being slow, lazy, and having bad ideas constantly.
---
define a good reason then
---
That's with each skill on release.
---
It adds little until more content is added to the skill over time.
---
Subscriptions are honestly just temporary stock in Jagex with the power to vote and make small changes in the company lol.
---
Please explain why you feel that way. I'm actually asking. OSRS was meant to capture the old feel of RuneScape and keep the general experience of playing the game as similar as possible, not to keep it literally the same game forever.
---
Can you find me where this was said by the mods?
---
Yes it is and slayer is the single worst skill idea to ever get into the game.
---
Some of the armors are op, like the one between ahrims and the next tier.
---
Play an Ironman, max main is irrelevant, since you can buy most of the skills
---
Rich people doesn't sway the opinion or outcomes of polls as much as people think. Especially not in RS.
---
Wouldn’t dissolving throwaway items (like low level armors) have a real effect on the economy? Wouldn’t we see the price of a bunch of stuff rise due to the fact that they are now resources for a skill? 
---
Is there that much or a surplus of low level items to be resistant to that?
---
I'm glad you only have considered the leveling in your thought process, not the benefits of the skills itself
---
/&gt;using mee mee arrows on leddit
---
I don't think it's a dumb complaint, as you said it can't be fun. Complaining about something not being fun is pretty standard. It can't really ever change though so if the complaint is one that is meant to illicit change, then I agree.
---
You gotta go to like level seven to fight chromazon, not that that's a big deal though.
---
reddit in the past few weeks have collectively decided we NEED this skill
---
I doubt warding will get more than 50%.
---
You wouldn't think it was sad if it was something you didnt want in the game.
---
Ouch, the horrible flashbacks. I have a feeling (along with many facts) that Warding will be equally bad, especially in an ancient traditional game such as OSRS.
---
Wait till the bot army’s vote yes because it’s free gp for them with a new skill
---
No - opinions cannot be wrong, and if you believe otherwise you are being intentionally dense. That is not my opinion, that is a fact.
---
Its not my job to think of new skills, that is up to the osrs design team. It irrlevelvent even if i did think of a new, fun, engaging skill, it wouldn't be added because i am, again, not part of the design team.
---
I understand you are angry. It frustrating to be wrong. walk it off.
---
I don't see this as an issue, in rs3 there are total worlds that go up to 2600. With a new skill they could wait to see how totals world are impacted and then adjust accordingly.
---
This isn't how you get people to vote what you want them to. This is how you get spite-voting.
---
I agree that I would have liked artisan more than Warding, but I'm nearing a point where I really want a new skill to be added just to fuckin break that seal and allow people to realize that a new skill isn't such a bad thing
---
I love the home tele bottle
---
Actually in current landscape chaotic would be "underpowered" for the tier at which it is available, and the fact it is degradable.
---
Ahh shit.. here we go again..
---
I understand that you don't lime what he does, but whats hypocritical about it?
---
I am one of those. The thought of trying to re-get full graceful after lvl 60 agility is haunting.
---
yes but like I said at least 40% of the population would hate it because it “doesn’t fit OSRS”, and then if you add the people who never want a new skill ever you have a majority. So no new skills ever
---
Can’t believe I have to explain this, but a reason that makes sense. Is that simple enough for you?
---
Well then, instead of a democratic poll, think of it as a quality control filter, it needs vast majority approval rather than 50% taking one glance and thinking 'yeah, sounds neat I guess'
---
All I've done is state my opinion and you're jumping all over me. Is it because you actually find my points to be compelling but you just don't want to admit it? 
---
You should take a small break from the internet. Maybe have a snack.
---
This was so annoying when you trained dungeoneering
---
The more dedicated fanbase has a better idea about the game, and this understand led them to not want any new skill. The more dedicated fanbase also got into alts. It's a correlation.
---
\&gt;calling other people noobs
---
\&gt;doesn't know about the soa clanchat
---
Mkay.
---
&gt;Lol jokes on you. I have a tbow offer in at 2b, someone is gonna get so screwed lmao. 
---
If this is a joke I really don't get it.
---
Heroes quest is members though
---
Yeah, hopefully she has a good nights sleep on the couch :)
---
Thanks. I was already planning on voting yes, but I was just curious.
---
&gt;IP
---
can be easily changed
---
&gt;hardwareID
---
can be easily changed in fact it takes LESS time than changing your IP.
---
People that like things I don't like are \[toxic/neckbears/sweaty/incels\]!!!!!
---
Opinions can be wrong.  To use a ridiculous example, I could say “my opinion is that black people don’t deserve rights”.  That opinion would be categorically wrong and if you defend it then you are also wrong.
---
Bonds have gone up a shitload in the past month, summer I guess?
---
Should i try to stockpile them now or just buy them as needed? I normally buy one at the end of each 2 weeks.
---
Real question: 
---
Will Venezuelans will vote yes or no?
---
That's true of course. But is it really THAT bad if they add decent exp/h rates? It's not like a bankstanding skill is radically changing the experience of the game. If people hate crafting, smithing and runecrafting, I wonder if they even like the game runescape itself lol. It's a click based game that raises the dopamine levels when we reach a goal. In three years time a good part of the community will be maxed or really end game. I think it's vital that this game keeps some novelty to it. If people really hate the warding skill, then sure, no problem, they should vote no. I do believe though that for most people the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. I'm just trying to convince the people that haven't 100% made up their mind.
---
Our opinion is worth more than others because we have no lives and pay 8× the amount of money normal peoples do. REEEEEEEE
---
There’s a small gap, like we could use a T60 armor and I suppose it would be interesting to have a way to make mage armor.
---
Does it mean I think we need a new skill for that stuff? Absolutely not. Seems way too niche for a new skill.
---
We gotta fight back! I'm single and kind of gainfully employed. I'll bond at least 5 accounts just to get this skill. 
---
Let the blood bath begin.
---
So a constructive conversation about what's good or bad about Warding or the game is wrong because people might... change their mind? I apologize, I didn't realize that people who disagree should demonize the other because their views are different
---
The problem is people nowadays- looking at you unstable political climate- is people have stopped using opinion by definition, and now use it synonymously with "I believe". Beliefs, can very much indeed be wrong. Flat Earth, Earth is the center of the universe, etc. History is full of examples.
---
Still not griefing though? You never know what people have in their inventory
---
Bankstanding buyable is so 1999.
---
why do you think this will be the last skill proposal? people have said that both of the previous times as well
---
&gt; if it’s not a standalone skill how much of the content will get done if not for the personal satisfaction?
---
why does it need to be done a lot? if its good people will do it either way, if its not good then its people can ignore it
---
slayer is a fucking garbage skill
---
Not sure if sincere or really good at sarcasm lol
---
I will be voting no to warding. Yes I have a neckbeard. 
---
This whole time I thought I was going to vote no for genuine reasons. After discovering my neckbeard's selfish agenda, I realize this is not the case, and I am forever doomed to a world of downdoots. 
---
Tl;dr for those yes voters, me and my neckbeard will have a chat over dinner.
---
25% is an enormous buffer for things that people are actually opinionated about
---
He literally just gave you a great reason why. It's just another bankstanding buyable, and we have plenty of those.
---
This is just your own personal opinion. Nobody is forcing you in to buying skills. Also your opinion that that doing raids and buying it will be more entertaining. It can entirely be trained passively by dissolving drops you normally would have alchemy anyway.
---
Furthermore this is all speculation coming from somebody who hasn’t even tried the skill yet!
---
If the reason to dissolve a bandos is good enough, I am sure people will dissolve those.
---
Its all about what are they going to give.
---
Oh shit!  These are so sick!
---
And warding is worse than atrisan.
---
They were way more popular after a ton of updates, but not so much at release.
---
Ofcourse there were people that loved them, but a lot of people didn't.
---
dam.. who else wants to shit out of their dicks now?
---
This is where the player base CAN voice their opinion, the forums are dead and the only other thing is a support ticket or messaging a JMOD on Twitter, like it or not this is the best we got and we have to use it to ensure the future of the game we love.
---
"Waaah people didn't vote for what i wanted".
---
Grow the fuck up guys. That's the point of voting. That your opinion doesn't outweigh anyone else's.
---
I just found a reason to vote no to the poll
---
How am i displaying anger?, using 3rd party clients is cheating, i don't think anyone can deny that since it gives you benefits not included in the official client.
---
i doubt they were inactive but even if they were, why does it matter? pvpers have multiple votes due to typically having multiple accounts/builds and their shit never passes. you're concerned about a minority giving itself slightly more power, but its unlikely to actually change the results.
---
I agree, if y’all hate purple so much then this is the best alternative. But I’m still a huge fan of the purple
---
No it isn't. How dumb/ignorant do you have to be to think everybody who understands the need for a UBI eventually is a NEET? I'll try to level with you however pointless it might be. I don't think he'll even come close to winning. I'm not counting my goodboypoints waiting for that 1000. Doesn't change the fact that we're headed in a direction where unskilled labor is going to be obsolete for human hands. This is going to go over your head though so i won't invest too much thought into it.
---
I should try this
---
I am fairly sure that I was talking about **respecting the voting process**. And not whether the updates are necessary or why they don't pass.
---
When you respect the voting process, you will accept the result no matter the outcome. No matter if the losing side was better. No matter the reason behind the votes.
---
Try ur firewall then if it still doesn’t work just download Runelite client instead of playing from the website
---
Congratulations, you understand how a reality with infinite works, not probabilities. I'm not saying the fabric of our Universe has been ripped, I'm just saying the formula for the game's RNG is bad. An event that has a 1/9,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 chance can still happen, because the numerator is 1, not 0... but it ***shouldn't*** happen.
---
yooooo I had no idea you had an OSRS account that's legit. Now that I got a 99 I kind of don't know what to do and I definitely don't want to Quest lmao.
---
I’ve had the twisted bow at 1mil for a month now... no budge so far.
---
Yes. If you have void that works well too. I always use void. 100 chests deep and have made 20M.
---
You can look at the gauntlet as a similar form of raids I think? Might be wrong so dont flame me
---
Clearly, you don't have more than 20 IQ. Please point to me where I said I was against warding? Oh wait, you can't, cause I haven't. I'm voting yes tommorow. That doesn't change any fucking thing I said.
---
Lazy people need their cheat client 🙄
---
Man I just don’t want another boring crafting skill I have to bank-stand for 400 hours to level...
---
Vast majority of maxed players like myself would prefer something that’s not crafting / runecrafting niche and can be fit into it. I’ll gladly dump a cash stack(not selling items) the first week and would have my max cape back when shitheads like you cry about needing 70 for a new diary. It’s not a new skill any of us directly care about it’s a complete rework of existing content that can be fit into current content and completely changing the Meta of ALOT of things in the game.
---
You know, thats a solid point on the analytical side of things. What would you propose, if you were to make adjustments to warding and the products of?
---
Djngeoneering is NOW popular but at release it definietly was NOT , I remember, myself included hating the fuck out of the skill and not touching it for another 6months before people started to understand how it worked.
---
Stfu neckbeard.
---
Man summoning ruined a bunch of pvm
---
It was not worth having some people burst rock lobsters for charms to break bosses and pvp
---
To be honest, if Jagex ever decides to remove Runelite, I'm quitting.
---
It's not even about the timers, the UI, the little tools. It's about the draw distance, animation smoothing, anti-aliasing, consistent and high FPS with gpu and the fog. It makes the game so much cleaner and it looks beautiful.
---
The reddit special :)
---
I've always called the bulwark Dinh's door, so why not?
---
There are people that argue EOC was necessary.
---
There are a lot of people that argue summoning ruined the combat system and dungeoneering was a fantastic minigame but a terrible skill and the rewards broke combat even further.
---
Took me like 89 seagull kills for the drop, thought I was going insane.
---
Perhaps. Is a new, not very well thought out, buyable bankstanding skill the solution though?
---
&gt;Slayer would get no voted if polled today.
---
skill that add weapon that will be OP for years to come? 
---
skill that can KO any pure in PVP? 
---
wtf!? who voted for skill in 2005!?
---
Suck my ass cockgobbler
---
I dont like the idea of players being able to vote more than once in the first place. I think actually using bonds on inactive accounts to have multiple votes is just another step past that
---
I did 55 to 83 last month using oak larders/dungeon doors. I would do it for an hour or two and then stop. It really is a nice addition to my account and totally worth the grind tho. I have trouble seeing big grinds through and it felt really good to get it done.
---
I can honestly say I wouldn't bother playing OS if it wasn't for runelite. The game is so dated that runelite just gives it that edge that it needs to be bearable.
---
I do hope so, because the skill will most likely not pass 75%. This is what MMK said about it. [https://twitter.com/RealMatK/status/1150777491470114816](https://twitter.com/RealMatK/status/1150777491470114816)
---
What they will learn from it imo is that the community is divided af and that either the polling has to change or we will be waiting for a long time until the "perfect" skill suggestion is made. It probably doesn't exist :/
---
it looks weird on the NPC's but I actually prefer it on my character. Took me a couple times to figure that out.
---
That's just sadistic
---
Yet Slayer is a skill.
---
Rs3 is mostly adults with money who buy promos. They are much more mature over rs07 players, we seem to get all the whiney kids. They usually skill and pvm only, no one pks on Rs3. If you want to talk, join a clan.
---
It's almost like you're expected to use atleast some of your brain cells to play the game. Go back to rs3.
---
By scraping it entirely and coming up with something else lol
---
Um unless i'm reading an old blog its for Crystal bow only?
---
I only had 1 issue with galvek. I died twice before I understood what to do when he throws down those 6 or so bombs. Other than that I got through it no problem. Congrats though mate
---
pepelaugh
---
1 word. Silkbots
---
So much tension can I get a doujin
---
Either I can expect to go 1500 dry or you're gonna get some good luck real soon. I hope for both our sakes, your next scythe is inbound.
---
Why does it suck? Not hating just curious.
---
it always depends on school/university for me.  Whenever school is on break, ill jam osrs like no tomorrow.  Once schools back in full force, i gotta ease up or else my studies take a hit lol.
---
I know Jagex allows them for now but specifically at your own risk, they don't embrace them but i guess it's a status quo thing since Jagex don't have the resources to do anything about it.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Do you think people don't have an opinion on warding?
---
because talking to somebody who thinks it's a good addition isn't going to my change my opinion that it isn't. You don't know anything about it that I don't. There's no perspective you can offer me that's gonna change my opinion. This OP is literally demonizing people who don't agree with him. Not sure that's the best ground to stand on.
---
And this is what will make any skills hard to pass. You just can’t please everyone.
---
Don’t take this the wrong way though because it’s not like every skill in the game is loved by all and if any future skills are polled it will be the same case. This is just one of the realities we have to accept of a polling system. We’re all free to exercise our vote how we see fit.
---
I’d be interested to see a repoll of some old ideas like sailing, artisan, and also warding to see if there’s any interest again in some of them.
---
How do you learn the game ? Like it just looks so different I don’t even know where to start
---
TWO*
---
Look, if i was planning on pooping in someone's coffee and i saw them piss in it i would stay away from them because they are clearly crazier.
---
Slayer could be turned into a minigame but definitely isnt one. Dungeoneering is 100% a fully fleshed out minigame. Poor comparison.
---
If Dungeoneering isn't a skill, then Slayer isn't a skill.
---
10-12 years ago...
---
You're forgetting the most important part. You started playing 10-12 years ago. There wasn't much in the way of options for online games back then. Compare that to nowadays and tell me if you really think it's the same.
---
What parts do you feel like aren't thought out?
---
And you're not forced to do any of that content?
---
What don't you get about that?
---
Gzz beast
---
You actually expect these people to have any sort of valid reasoning for their no vote? They never do.
---
Got a lizardman task and told myself I would do DS2 before I keep hunting the DWH. Probably gonna get some more quests done first because I want DS2 to be my last quest for qcape before SotE comes out
---
What about beta servers where players need to hit a certain low base level (say 30 or 40?) before they can vote at all for or against it?
---
Neckbeards upset that they're being called out for being neckbeards. What's wrong with it is that all you middle aged neckbeards will never be happy with anything new no matter what it might be.
---
*mini game
---
Or lack of resources?, RS3 is still the main game for Jagex with the most resources.
---
Slayer is literally fetch quests.
---
It’s a Scottish Highlander not a yak
---
You do need a 2nd person for Heros quest, however. The same CC ppl use to find a partner for shield of arrav ppl use for Heros quest.
---
Also theres ususlly a pmod in that cc directly players on how to quickly complete the partner part of heros quest
---
Cc is - 'osrs soa'
---
How about we just get stealing creation back and call it a day
---
They’re just casuals in disguise that can’t handle getting another skill to 99 or 200m
---
Except partnerships went into polls and was voted no and to such a one-sided favor that the poll was closed early.
---
Sorry what?  RS3?
---
Just because something is significantly better than what it was doesn't make it good.
---
Although I do agree: it IS better. I just feel it isn't good enough. This doesn't really seem like a new skill to me. 
---
Runecrafting needs a buff in some way, shape or form. Making magical armor using runecrafting would probably be fine.
---
So I'm voting no. If it passes anyway, it passes.
---
What would those reasons be? I am going to list out the warding skill right here for you. 
---
You craft magic armor, you get the resources through farming or killing mobs are buying the mats on the GE. 
---
You can get imbued rings which gives an alternative to imbues from the nmz which we know is going to change with warding or some other alternative. 
---
You can get some new items that help leveling, an anti poison lamp, the name does exactly what it sounds like. And then a few other items. 
---
I like all of this and I liked battle wards but at least there was an argument beyond ThIs Is SUmoNiNg ThIs Is GoNnA Be RstHrEee. 
---
If you wonder why your getting hate is because there isn’t an argument against warding, other than you gotta get more exp to max? Which is a bad argument in the first place.
---
I enjoy hunter tyvm
---
Its all explained in the lore. But you dont read lore so you dont understand it. Magic is part of the universe, its how we can play as human, its essential. Now, we are a medieval fantasy game, and I think its better to lean more to the medieval side than the fantasy side, too much fantasy and you get a science fiction game, a science fiction game is basically what RS3 has now, it also looks like science fiction with its graphics, warding would further contribute to this feel. Whats good about magic is it includes so many aspects and takes it under its own hood just using different spellbooks. Thats all Warding is. Its just a spell. If you want Warding as a skill you would also want enchanting as a skill. Alchemizing as a skill. Curses as a skill. Warding is nothing but a spell on a spellbook and it would be better if it was just that.  
---
&gt; Using eating trees and chair avatars is an absurd strawman for what warding would bring to the game if it passed.
---
No its because you use vacuous truths like "its a game" Yes yes. We all know its a game. Did you think I didnt know that it is a game? If its because "you can do whatever with a game" then yeah, but that doesnt make it good. I have explained that to you.
---
&gt;You think I’ve got all my alts bonded at the same time lmao. You think I don’t have a 2b bank? 
---
&gt;Exactly what I’m talking about. Trying to say I use my mums credit card because I’m going to vote no to warding lmao freak
---
Boy, this post, and you in general are just toxic. Look at how upset you are over this! I mean come on get a grip please.
---
Why do people want a copy pasted skill? What's wrong with the one already in Rs3? The game is not gone and if eoc is the error you can simply play it in a legacy restricted world.
---
Sick!
---
Alch yourself please :)
---
i mean the dissolve part of it is RS3 sequence stuff but then again some loved content is also rs3 stuff, tbow=hex hunter, trident=polypore, rapier/elder maul are slightly nerfed chaotis, song of the elves, taste of hope, dragon slayer 2 rewards and the area its in, raids and the whole basis of it is rs3/WoW sooooooo yea no its fine let them have their ass backwards logic
---
everyone votes how they personally want to, and the resultant outcome is what most people agree to. Welcome to democracy.
---
It wouldn’t be like player owned ports, but I did quite enjoy that. But then OSRS came out so I never truly got that far into it.
---
Wait they wanted to make spell s bugger and it failed? Wtf? I've literally wanted this since fucking 2005.
---
Some of it would to make sense of the barbarian training instead of it just being a tack on part of a main skill. In my eyes it could remove the requirement of having to use many tools which could be a UIM benefit or just someone wanting to maximize inventory space. I just thought the barbarian training was a odd tack on to skills and it popped into my head of the idea.
---
It’s gonna pass
---
Yeah it'll just be crafting items that will sit at alch value. Sort of like smithing
---
yea but reach swat just wasnt the same,  the brs didnt sound like birds chirping, and some of the maps really felt lifeless. kinda like stagnant or something.  halo 4 had some really cool maps.  like the one in the sky  where your in the red storm cloud.    halo reach maps felt like they where made in forge
---
Mat K doesn't even work there anymore, that's just his opinion. It also doesn't say that they won't work on skills, he's more saying that no skill will pass.
---
Why would they put effort into remaking these features on the client when it's already done for then for free? They can focus on actual content that RL can't develop.
---
Use two brain cells before you post.
---
Kpop covers that
---
It’s not that I don’t want any new skill. I’d be happy to have a new skill if it’s the right one. Warding just isn’t it.
---
Why? Because it’s just pointless. No one has ever asked to be able to craft magic armor. The game has survived just fine without that ability. While there are some cool proposals within the skill, all of it could be achieved by other means utilizing skills like crafting, magic, and runecrafting. I can’t justify the immense amount of dev time it would take to add this skill when there’s no real need or want for it.
---
Just take a break and try it again in a few months / years. Sometimes you just gotta not burn yourself out on it and theres tons of other fun games to checkout in the meantime
---
A lot of OSRS quests are also just a "chain" of fetch this/kill this tbh
---
I'll bond up 40 accs. 160m is nothing for a staket.
---
Get my Hope's up? I never said I was voting yes 😂 I dont care either way. I'm just saying because I've seen tons of people on either side with alts. All saying they have numerous numbers ready to vote. Some saying they have 30 or so bots ready to vote yes.
---
I love skilling, but there exceptions when the skill requires abnormally high "effort" ( time or cash) for abysmal returns. For example I liked grinding mining at blast mine to 99. Got a rhythm going, felt like I was rewarded appropriately for my investment with decent XP and GP. Agility is nice because I progressed courses and unlock short cuts as well as slight uptick in run regen. Etc. I dump a crapton of money into my house and I can drastically change how I experience the game. 
---
The herblore grind was garbage. It's a GP check. You bankstand, then you get 99. Wow I can make overloads now... When the rest of my raids team already could. Oh I can make a bit of money adding herbs to vials. Wow. Much reward, glad I poured 70mil down the drain. 
---
Warding is just another boring bankstand grind for mediocre returns and has the audacity to ask you to spend mils on it. You can add the update without forcing a mediocre grind. Jagex themselves have said it would already be as boring as other grinds. And it will. My issue is that it's not rewarding.
---
New boss content is fine with me, I’d sincerely love a new place to pvm with friends since I have enjoyed raids 1 &amp;2 and think they were implemented in the spirit of OSRS... but a skill like warding just screams RS3 to me. Why not just add this skill to Rs3?
---
They should just add a new, more difficult godward dungeon style update to enjoy with friends or something. Just my opinion, and justification for why I will be voting no
---
“It could lean quite heavily on existing production skills (Crafting, Runecrafting, Fletching) making them a little more useful and worth training up.” 
---
Sounds like you just solved warding - add the Mage gear the community (NOT the company) wants in a way that fills the gap, meshes with existing skills, and futhers the purpose of underused skills. 
---
Or, continue with the “shot in the dark” method of pouring loads of mod&amp;dev time into creating a skill and surrounding content that... may never see the light of day. What a waste of time and effort if it is polled against!
---
3 or 5 fire runes?
---
Who is muhfn and why does every server I go to have a crier telling me to block them?

---
Thank you so much for all of this! Dpick shouldn't be an issue, and have salve (e) and (ei) or whatever they are. However, I need salve, occult, tort, and anguish? Seems like a lot of necks...but anyway, the goal before starting will be to get rigour! Dcbow also isn't an issue! Thank you again! Sorry if my response is a bit jumbled, really sick sitting in the doctors office right now.
---
If they have 0 incentive to develop all the content then why would they develop enough to make a video on it for RuneFest? I am talking about a beta test if it passes a couple months down the line.
---
me and all the other gmaul pures gonna have a great time doing monkey madness and lost city quests together smh...
---
You'd think someone maxed would be hype to grind a new skill
---
Just me validating you've made a good point

---
I thought more than 51% liked RFD? Except the stew part which is probably below 10%
---
I think they all sounded pretty neat. The least desirable for me probably was artisan, but if it were fleshed out more I could maybe get onboard.
---
If Jagex had shoved Sailing down our throats after months of watching us meme and legitimately explain away why we don’t want the skill nor the surrounding activities as much as they are forcing it down our throats with Warding, maybe Sailing would have actually passed.
---
I don't want dungeoneering because it had no purpose being a skill more than a minigame. It has no benefits to the rest of the game except combat, right? And the best way to train it was to just boost with a friend and run the smallest rooms. 
---
There's dungeoneering, and then the rest of the game. They don't blend together at all.
---
No to warding!
---
But no need to spite a war for alt voters. Tbf jamflex could very easily manipulate the polls,  with their own bot army or whatever. Hope we stay oldschool
---
The name is Bondage... James Bondage
---
Me too, I got all the eastern scroll and the port master title, I got no problem with if it got added, because osrs doesn't have a comp cape.
---
Agree cos they would all vote no even if we were missing con/hunter/farm like back in the day
---
I didn't know the telegrabbing part. I appreciate that!
---
Jagex should add beta warding servers, so the community can have a better view about it.
---
I completely disagree - spite voting is a good excuse they’ve settled on, but they were always going to vote that way. It’s been that way before trump too - there have always been the “independent” voter that always vote for one party, then just use these excuses to claim that’s why they voted for said party/poll result.
---
The economy is crashing! Your clicks aren’t even worth what they used to go for!
---
What a weirdo, lmao
---
Sailing is temple trekking on the ocean 
---
Artisan is stealing creation rewards; the skill
---
At least warding has some depth off the bat
---
while i agree i also think warding &gt; nothing
---
I don't think we should change the vote percentage from 75% and that's coming from someone who has wanted certain wilderness updates to pass that failed by 5-10%. The vote percentage is high because it only allows updates in that a super majority of people enjoy. It's best this way because it means there wouldn't be anything that passes that the community has a split opinion about. If only 51% of people wanted something in the game there is probably a good reason why 49% of people are voting no. The acceptable amount decided a long time ago is less than 25% of people not wanting something so theoretically 1/4 people would be upset. 
---
The polling system is flawed, i agree, in that it creates a "tunnel" (i can't think of a word) of updated content in the game. Meaning content that isn't as popular has a lower chance of passing because people will often vote no. So Jagex sticks to updating popular content because they know it will pass polls, if they work on content that fails it was a big waste of time/money. That's why a large % of updates are for pvm, it's easy to justify working on pvm updates to their employers when they reliably pass polls.
---
Yes, it failed because down syndrome pvpers said it would devalue their skill towards people who can't click Ice Barrage just as precisely.
---
thats  pro gamer move right there
---
I got 99 theories and 76 ain't one
---
This should be the single reason people should vote no /s
---
Really weird. Seems like some sort of firewall issue maybe. Does the osrs website itself open?
---
Yes that is case 
---
No it wont happen 
---
this rune pouch is used with the 2 slot rune pouch to make the 4 slot rune pouch
---
Duely noted, I will RES tag him! Thanks.
---
those guys are probably newer pkers that want to pk with absolutely no risk at all. Only ever killed one abyss rcer and that's because dumbass was skulled with a free d pick
---
Hopefully this is just a joke, I can’t imagine somebody is this passionate that they’d bond x amount of accounts just for a singular vote on Warding.
---
Yes voters are retarded lol.
---
Takes only 25.1% no votes and it's over.
---
Weebs from 2009 are now Koreaphiles in 2019.
---
It's their attempt to integrate warding with skills other than just magic. At the core of the skill it's manipulating magical fabric to create things - it doesnt need to be limited to just armour. Rune pouches are made of magical fabric, it fits.
---
I personally don't see too much wrong with it, there's plenty of skills that tie into others and gives rewards for them - you might just not notice because they're often tradeable. 
---
Additionally, these new and rewards are being polled separately from the skill itself. You're giving a reason to vote no to that question, not warding itself.
---
But how would you complete the quest if you're locked to entrana only
---
Damn dude drink some herbal tea and chill out or something
---
Hey don't disrespect Jagex's customer service platform!
---
Yay the ability to make shitty subtier armor that would be cheaper to buy off the GE than make myself. How rewarding lol.
---
Nope! Thing is it used to work perfectly fine before I quit a month ago!
---
A little part of me died inside for you
---
And thats a good thing.
---
it makes sense that they want to poll it sooner rather than later. It is diverting developer time away from other things. Why waste time if it's just gonna fail in the future
---
because they're retards lol, kids have 25 kc thinking they're elite and better than you.
---
elite void is meh but it's alright. after like a few kc's and getting more comfortable you should switch over to non-void. you only really use like 2-3 brews at olm anyway. basically 1 brew dose if you're running

---
You never played back in 06 when everyone at karamja needed fire, to cook lobster to slay lesser demons. Everyone needed firemaking then :)
---
I've had a buy offer for 1 gp on a twisted bow since the minute the patch hit for CoX, your attempts will be futile.
---
It's Pikachu
---
Yes, I agree. I think though 70% is perfectly reasonable.
---
well yea they've said that they're going to hold a beta if it passes. As for the video for runefest what they developed was concept art. No in game models were made yet as far as i know it was all drawings if i remember correctly
---
From what I've read up on the skill, and to my understanding, it's a very easy and cheap skill to 99, as such it should not be added until it's fixed, plus it could throw combat out of wack which could damage pvm/pvp, not worth it...
---
From their perspective though.. why do work that someone else has already done
---
That's what they said about Sailing, and Artisan, and it's what they'll say about the next proposed skill, and the next one, and the next one.
---
Fucking add the skill and we can make it fit everybody's issues after it's initially implemented.
---
It could be, yes, but knowing Jagex if it doesnt pass they more than likely will scrap the entire idea as a whole.
---
Progression could be based on your ship and upgrading it would require blueprints found about the various islands that could be navigated to. Personally, I think making it a skill limits it more as it’s very vague on what would exactly give XP. Would it be like agility where you do laps of the sea or would it be from making the boats? Big chunks from discovering islands, like dungeoneering? That always felt a little strange to me.
---
Coming from another pker, this is a absolute brainlet take.
---
lol just learn to click buddy
---
Imbue your salve
---
why try to influence people if you dont play the damn game?
---
The entire skill is based on the idea that crafting is for ranged and smithing is for melee, which is nonsense. Apart from that, I believe that it's a bad solution to many of this games problems.
---
I wish they would release more monsters that drop raw food / materials to make use of skills like that more often.
---
Underappreciated reference.
---
True, I do get that. Just it would be really nice if it was built in.
---
and mtx
---
Hey, fishing end game is Infernal and Sacred Eels, that's some good afk money right there, and free Zulrah scales. 
---
End game hunter is catching Dragon Implings, or Black Chins if you care about Wilderness stuff. 
---
Cooking is kind of a niche skill to me, like Fire Making right now, I mean the best Cooking xp is wines, but it also gets you some killer skill boosts and cooked fish... 
---
And thieving... another interactive skill, End game would be Pyramid Plunder... 
---
I think end game skilling skills need to be more integrated with pvm to serve a better purpose but most of them do that already.
---
You can vote no, I have no qualms with that. It would just be rather ironic if the people who want to keep the game "pure" use RuneLite to play the game.
---
What are your specific criticisms about warding? To me, its a better version of smithing and crafting, and paves the way for future improvements to those skills. Warding also makes sense lore wise, fills gaps in the least played side of the combat triangle, is awesome for skillers who see combat update after combat update, actually feels like a skill instead of a mini game, and isn’t overpowered.
---
If you’re going to complain about bankstanding skills, maybe play an Ironman?
---
It's honestly a huge turn off to the game that these neckbeards bottleneck progress
---
No skill has been perfect upon release, they've all had updates over time that made them better. As it stands, warding would be flawed, but shooting it down immediately won't give it the time it needs to get better through testing and player feedback.
---
I see, using personal attacks now because you are standing on water. Your argument has collapsed on itself.
---
Have a good day.
---
Sadly I see it failing because of the people who want to vote no just to vote no. I like warding especially the process of dissolving which will reduce gold from people just alching and remove items which we need.
---
Almost all of your post history on this sub is bitching about PvP, stop being such a virgin lmfao this is cringe as fuck.
---
What I worry for is the players who want warding getting so butthurt if it doesn’t pass that they will vote no to sailing. Which would be very very upsetting. I’m almost wanting to vote yes to warding so we can get sailing. That was the one piece of OSRS content that I actually really want.
---
Those things are not mutually exclusive, if you think something is good for the game you probably also like it.
---
Sailing is only good in theory. No offense but RuneScape doesn’t have the team size or infrastructure to make it actually good or interesting. If I wanted sailing content I would play another game, i just don’t see a way where it would be decent mechanically and content wise. If it was a mini game it would likely be dead within days after people get over the initial hype and realize this isn’t something they would want to pour in a ton of time into, unless forced by some sort of content or gear unlocks. 
---
RuneScape would have to have a huge effort and overhaul to make sailing worth the dev time.
---
That's just one thing I dislike and you're right other skills tie in together. To me it would make sense to be able to craft pouches with a runecrafting requirement rather than using a new skill.
---
I will be voting no because I dislike the skill as a whole. I'll still be voting yes on the parts I do like in case it passes.
---
That's not an opinion though. It's just objectively wrong, like you said.
---
I don’t think you came off like you think all updates are fine, but there is a sentiment on reddit that if you don’t automatically support then you’re just being difficult.
---
I guess my point as it relates to this post is that if it seems like there’s some double-think or weak reasons as to why people oppose warding, it’s because there’s general distrust in Jagex to put out major features that are good for the game. I’d say I’m in that camp. But you’re right, I don’t immediately see anything wrong with warding, which is why I’m not a hard no right now
---
A true artisan of BM.
---
&gt;hope everything is going okay in your life my dude.
---
It's really not
---
Another one: people on this sub who actually like Warding dont say anything because they dont want to get criticized. 
---
This sub is "if you aren't with us, then you're opinions are trash"
---
vote yes
---
Shut up,  serene
---
S
---
Honestly I wish this would happen.
---
I 100% agree that this shouldn’t decide the fate of future skills. I’m voting no
---
Same, I voted yes to allow the resizeable icons because I thought it was kinda pointless to have all that empty space, but I respect the opinions of the players who think the precision required to cast the spells is a skill worth preserving because it's their game too.
---
Mtx destroyed it more or pretty much entirely.
---
Quests in RS 3  are actually much better and far more enjoyable than osrs( immersive af) . Can surely see devs putting in a lot of effort there. As much as i hate Eoc the osrs combat system is pretty lame as well.
---
Don't just jump on the Rs3 hate bandwagon
---
Imagine people that keep making these memes only to have their precious skill *NOT* pass because people vote 'No' out of spite because of these dumb memes. I hope all of you get so mad when it doesn't pass.
---
No not only because of this. I don't like a lot of the content that has passes polls. Just recently mtx was polled but failed.
---
This game can't last forever and seeing stuff like warding make it this far just reminds me of when RS3 went down.
---
Of course they’re all superior, they’re all BIS and some of the expensive gear in the game
---
I feel like we don't need a new skill we need to work on content that is dead. I would rather see reworks and content that has been swept under the rug become relevent and fun. I feel like ever since zeah was released the mainland was kinda just forgotten about and their focus is over there now. I would totally vote for warding if everything else in the game was as good as it could be but i dont feel like trying to give us a new skill is what we really need
---
I may end up voting yes just because I know they're working hard on it. I'm undecided. The problem is the game is already fucked by this seperation with the other skills. We can't undo fletching/crafting/smithing now. But if we could go back, I wouldn't hate training non-combat skills so much. I do some skilling and it's not  satisfying in any way(minus agility because shortcuts). If I gain a strength level, for instance, I can now hit higher, awesome! If I gain a fletching/crafting/smithing level... I will still be buying my items. 
---
I can go gain 20 fletching levels and it doesn't make smithing suck less like gaining 20 strength levels make training another combat skill suck less. So it's not that warding doesn't provide enough content as much as it is just another "making gear" skill that I'll end up only training for quest/diary requirements and then buy other people's output (like bows from fletching) when I actually need a particular item. 
---
I'd just rather have 1 very diverse skill that you can train in several different practical ways, than have 5 seperate skills that are in essence the same thing but outputs for different usages.
---
Imagine if Crafting, Fletching, and Smithing were all one skill and they proposed adding warding to the abilities of having a high level in that skill. Would give people an incentive to train it besides having to do something they can't stand for 50 hours to do a quest (me with mining and smithing for ds2, for example)
---
I did read the post and like I said I'm looking forward in warding. I myself don't judge on a post. I rather judge by the warding game play but since warding isn't out yet and yet to see some warding game play or have myself training warding I wouldn't judge it.
---
i feel one way and you feel another. I think its pretty clear how we will vote tomorrow no need to talk about it more.
---
Casual detected - "I don't want more added to the game because I haven't finished everything else there is to do"
---
Why do you think you have so much to do, it's because the Devs have added tonnes of stuff to the game since release
---
Not at all.
---
You can sell your stuff on the grand exchange sure, just know that there's a lot of people selling items so you may have to lower your initial price by 5% (there's a button for it in the interface). Also there's multiple guides for effective training on the wiki).
---
Actual unpopular opinion here:
---
I think the community definitely got way better. At the start there were a lot more purists but nowadays, a lot of content actually passes. A lot of these QoL changes wouldn't have ever passed back in 2013 when the servers launched (think shift-drop).
---
That being said, I wish I could say the same about the Classic WoW community, it seems like they haven't learned from us that their game can't sustain itself without content updates.
---
MatK doesn’t work for Jagex anymore so you can’t really take what he’s saying as fact
---
The fact that you generalize people that vote no to updates as neckbeards and the fact that you call people that voted no to that update "down syndrome pvpers" says a lot about you, your mindset, and whether you actually have anything important to say.
---
Actually, online content isn't rated by the ESRB, and that distinction is precisely WHY they aren't liable.
---
There is not, but the Amulet of Nature is so incredibly useless that you really, really shouldn't worry about it.
---
Thanks I added you, first friend
---
I think sailing has come and gone, I was just trying to portray the public opinion. I wasn't active when sailing was polled, what was its downfall?
---
Not OP but I did follow that comment train and no one has of yet responded with links to high effort posts since the update detailing issues with the skill.  Could you link them for me please?  On one hand, it'll sate my curiosity since I don't know much about warding in general, and on the other it'll also shut people the op up if they are wrong.
---
You son of a bitch you ;) you are a legend too
---
Alright, if you insist.
---
&gt;other skills are severly lacking
---
I haven't had or read any complaints.
---
&gt; another half-baked one
---
Warding was better planned out than your argument was, that's for sure
---
&gt; There isn't enough content to justify another skill
---
Compared to what? It's on par with pretty much every other production skill.
---
Thematically, a new skill makes more sense to me than just throwing everything into a bunch of other skills
---
As for why I think it's healthier to the game, I generally advocate offering players more choice in terms of what to do / train increases the longevity of their play-time and the size of the userbase. As stated earlier, I think Warding fits thematically. OSRS gets to outwardly demonstrate that it's growing via the addition of new long-form content, which could attract a broader audience. Current players with an interest in leveling something new get the opportunity. People get to theorycraft around efficient or profitable training methods and use that information to play the markets. In-demand resources will have an increased demand, making other skills more profitable.
---
Long story short, it gives a lot of people a new option of something to do, and *even if* I have no interest in training it myself, a larger active community benefits me as well.
---
So what do you want, a new skill that you get 99 in a day? Because that would be so much fun. There’s gonna be grind no matter what. Anything “new” and “exciting” is gonna get pretty fucking stale by the time you get 99 anyway. The fact that a new skill with new content being potentially being added to the game is exciting. The evolution of this game is exciting.
---
Like I said, those “unique” skills everyone refers to didn’t pass. So obviously the uniqueness of the skill isn’t a priority. 
---
Also, next time you reply, please don’t regurgitate that same piss poor arguments.
---
Depends on how much you’re buying. I’m seen as low as .50
---
2277-99=2178
---
21+78=99
---
I honestly don't think it'll pass, and that makes me sad because i would love a new skill and i personally think Warding fits the game thematically. I'll take my downvotes.
---
I think it's because of the update. It might take some time before the third party clients get it fixed. Only thing I can recommend is to use the default client until it's resolved.
---
Idk man, I've been playing rs since 2004, ive came to conclusion that if your a good pker, your good at pvm on rs07. For example, I always see people complaining about jad, I literally did it first try with no hesitation. For Rs07, you only have to understand the boss and his abilities to kill him. In RS3, it takes a bit more brain and specific abilities and movements, also the use of pots and ports, summoning monsters, etc... Personally I only pk on rs07 and pvm on rs3. I think RS3 pvming shames rs07 by a mile.
---
Sure, send me $11 and I'll fix it for you!
---
If your screen is too small to tell what the text says zooming in will help you read the text.  How fucking retarded are you?
---
Looks good, but the Wiki already has average values for each Revenant and the Skulled variants are considerably lower than yours. Maybe double check your (and their) calculations?
---
This makes me want to be a vegan 😥
---
Magical crafting (aka warding) isn't a bad idea, but it's not rewarding as polled. As a maxed player there is no incentive to train the skill outside of getting my max cape back basically. 
---
It might be okay mid level content or it could just be a trap for players in the middle. Like let's say you spend  30-40mil and get to 80ish warding and you can make make high tier mage armor for yourself. However making that made armor costs 5k more a piece to make than to sell because everyone makes it to train up on anyways so you if you really wanted the armor you could have just bought it. And I'm not even seeing a justication that would mean this new content needs to have its own skill.
---
Basically You can't have a skill give shit rewards and be costly. That's pretty much what warding is going to do. 
---
As far as introducing this content to existing skills you could probably push it into magic/crafting/runecrafting and just keep the xp rates low. Or push it in as part of a quest.  
---
As far introducing a new skill without overlap... Artisan was mildly interesting but needed to be fleshed out more. Slayer for skills wasn't a bad idea. People didn't like the artificial gates though. Sailing is more like a minigame but with the right tweaking could have made more sense as a skill. Maybe a skill for summoning and capturing and defeating planar beings and using that to imbue or create items. Who knows, not really my job to propose new content.
---
This Konar has blown my mind. You did a fantastic job working our imagination.  Its so mesmerizing..  
---
Wish you all the best career-wise!
---
Kuradal from rs3 was my favourite npc before i quit, "kurruh doll" i used to call her lol. Anyway maybe her in an osrs setting?
---
btw i would pay for a poster of your konar.. i mean DAAMN
---
I’m voting no but I want a new skill. Not another bank standing buyable or gathering skill. 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Your gonna need 99 agil aswell for sure
---
So the reason for voting no is because "muh max cape"?
---
Vote yes If have a big pp
---
And thats negative how?
---
If you can convince me sailing will integrate into the larger game as well as warding then I'd vote for it. Warding feels like a skill that fits into the game to me, sailing just seems like it'll be a minigame with an xp tracker.
---
You mean YES
---
What kinda logic is this lmao? We’re talking about a poll in a video game not a general election. People should vote for content they think they will enjoy because, again, this is a video game.
---
I enjoy your username there, friend.
---
Ok thanks I will check the guides.
---
I think it was a lack of player count to be honest with you. A lot of people not open for change. It only failed by 6%
---
I mean it's not hard when you need 75% to pass.
---
Love the color scheme!
---
I beg everyone to read the full latest Warding blog before voting, i think Warding will be terrible for the game and for the players, and i'd hate to see it get voted in because people skipped the blogs that came out after the first, it got massively worse
---
i will thanks :)
---
In a thread applauding someone for calling the r/2007scape sub 'toxic' (because they want warding to be added and some people don't), OP insults people with disabilities? Not cool, mods should ban this punk. 
---
Absolute cancer to this game.
---
Hmm was that method expensive?
---
If you give it time to develop and feedback it when it's in beta then that could be a possibility.
---
Both. Both are shitty, petty, and childish.
---
Don't really care tbh but thanks for your worries.
---
made you smile, I win &lt;3
---
I had about 50m cash on top of my equips. Iirc it was about 25m from those kills. Got a skeletal visage 5 kills after purchasing my dhcb which was awesome
---
This is fucking KOALA TEA
---
Also love this one
---
Oh wow! Thank you for the detailed response! I’ll look into some of these quests after work... Do you think I’ll be able to complete most of them at my level?
---
Yeah that's how I made the fossil island and Dragon slayer ones,
---
But as you can see the one that won is very similar to mine and has no brick wall.
---
Wow I just take for granted that I’ve literally known the game since it came out it must be very weird for a first time player. 
---
My ign is m mullan if you’re bored and need to ask a question
---
I think it boils down to that too. Some want something entirely unique VS something that fills a long time gap in the game. I think a skill can be fine if it fits either of those. Ideally, we'd want both, but that's pretty tough. I think Warding is as close as that gets to trying to appease both sides.
---
it won't come, but I honestly will vote for something like "Do you wish the osrs to focus on a new skill? if you vote yes then you can't vote no to the skill, only the content in it."
---
Yes we would, because this is vote manipulation either way.
---
MMK did a livestream on twitch two days ago, and he was saying literally the same things. You discredit his view on this solely because he no longer works for jagex since recently. Like that takes away all his insight from over the years in how things work at the company. We'll see who is right in the future. I do think you're naive if you think warding not passing won't have an effect on potential future skill updates. If you consider that a personal attack, you should have a thicker skin man.
---
What? I do not disagree with you on the point that mods will still consider new skills. I said “If someone presents you 7 points, and you find a **flaw** with one of them”, this implies that I too think point 7 is a flaw. I do think the other 6 points seem alright.
---
I dont know man, like, I tried to say something to promote discussion and you just came back arguing against things i didnt say.
---
all of it should be added to existing skills, it doesn't need to be a new one.
---
&gt; "There isn't enough to the skill." - Have you ever heard of Firemaking? The skill where you literally burn logs and that's it. Or even Fishing, where you click a spot and afk for hours. This isn't a valid criticism because Warding is just as (if not more) content rich than most of the skills in the game.
---
that's kind of an argument for not having it, in that they should be fixing those other shitty skills instead of wasting time on a new one.
---
Supply crates are dope
---
Just wanna say- if someone isnt switching to magic protect, I will win the fight 100% of the time and you should too. Their inexperience is clear and you should be wall hugging at the very least if you aren't winning fights against these players. This makes it an automatic win as it is, but you shouldn't even need to wall hug or dd to beat these players as their skill will be lacking. Try putting in blood barrages and make sure you are using augry. You might need to work on quicker switches. This kind of buff just isnt needed.
---
Literally every single thread about warding has valid criticisms of the skill. You're just ignoring it.
---
I found this comment after looking for 10 seconds in this thread.
---
No because over half of the content for it is reh...

yeah people on this sub bitched for like a week straight when elder and twisted armor failed the poll and said that people voting against it were holding the game back and that chambers would be dead on arrival. just goes to show how well the casuals on this sub understand game balance
---
Mods said if warding doesn’t pass then no new skill will be added. So pretty much holding hostage new contents. I see it as “we worked sooooo hard so if this doesn’t pass no more skills for you guys”. People work hard and they don’t succeed. That’s life.

Think about how many times you interact with the drop table over the course of the thousands of hours you play an account. You only remember the extreme outlier times of lucky/unlucky.

im voting no on 3 accs because u said that

Got mine at 69 recently 1500~ total
---
I was trying to find a solution that I wouldn't need to remember for every task and doesn't rely on RNG. I think it would be a decently simply fix in terms of coding, as long as the variables are simple enough you just X/2 and have it thrown out an even number.  
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Fair enough, can't fault you on that one. 
---
For arguments sake though, having 70 fletching to make yew long bows then alch them is nice xp/hr and makes you a chunk of gold as well as mage xp when you alch.
---
I went on a fletching streak and ended up at 92 from yew longs bows and 82 mage from alching, and built a nice little cash stack to work with as I moved on to tackle other goals.

Have fun whatever you decide mate!

You've killed 2k of a monster that has a 1/5k drop rate for the dwh. What are you expecting? Just keep killing them. Some people have had to kill like 25k before one dropped.
---
Entirely useless set of armor lol. Spent 200 mil getting 99 wardng to make armor when you could just buy the armor off the GE for less because it'll always cost more to make it yourself than to buy it or better yet buy Ancestral because it's better and save yourself 200mil. 
---
Why not take warding content and add it to firemaking and fletching and crafting so we can flesh out skills that need more interactive content and get a new list of armor. Oh wait you're one of those retarded plebs who get upset when people actually think for themselves and have an informed opinion and not willing to put up with your retarded bullshit.
---
I don't give a fuck if I have to train a new skill. Give me a fucking reward though. A set of shit tier armor is not a reward. This skill is as dumb as herblore and fletching and equally useless.
---
The combat should be same within Daemonheim as the time it was released.

The rest of the game on the other hand reeks of mtx cosmetic trash I can understand nobody here wants to see, not to mention the whole combat triangle overhaul it has.

I wanted the niche items, just that Pado's set was too overpowered in the poll blog, they edited the blog since then though to nerf the set so now I'm okay with it. I'm fine with Dagon'Hai being better than Ahrim's, it's just that it's WAY too accessible in comparison even to Mystics, let alone Ahrim's.
---
In my opinion, the majority of anti-pvp content posted on r/2007scape comes from people that fully understand pking and the wilderness but are more interested in manipulating Old School Runescape for their own profit (boosted xp, and gp/hour).
---
Always shift click brother
---
nah
---
why grind hours of mage training arena to get infinity robe set when you can just craft it with warding... it kills current available content
---
this is what happens when they force stuff on the community when we simply don't want it.   
---
You can put a bow on a turd, I'm still not ever going to want it.
---
because it gives new purpose to those skills, much like combat has a better purpose now there's the slayer skill. also, like slayer, I think we underestimate how much a skill like this could get people exploring new areas they had no need to go before and really appreciating what's there.
---
Yeah, nothing short of base 86, or 20 99s. Lol. Imagine being such a new player you don't have that. Lol.
---
Enchanting would have been fine. The problem is that there is already enchanting, and Jagex was adamant about not including enchanting in enchanting. But they were willing to move enchanting 2 (imbuing) to enchanting cause arbitrary reasons.
---
New name “Arcanist” (and bring back the flash game pls and ty)
---
then they should have continuously polled parts throughout all the blogs they did imo. Now just feels like one of the worst times
---
\*panic buy dart tips\*
---
I've read the blog. And depsite me not liking the skill 100% I will still vote Yes. There are aspects of it that I'm not 100% sure about, but overall I think it will be refreshing to see something like this in osrs. Adding a new skill will not turn it into EOC. 
---
So as I'm not 100% sure about this skill, I'm excited to see something like this come through.
---
Would moving all the Warding items to RC or Crafting even pass the polls?
---
Spite voting is mostly a pretext, no one who voted yes will now vote no because of memes on reddit.  Take your own advice and stop taking everyone for their word - it'll lead to a lot of dissapointment.
---
Honestly, I hope if it doesn't pass Jagex just pretends it did pass and releases it anyways.
---
Get a bonecrusher you fool! :)
---
Thanks man will do :)
---
I don't think they have polled it yet, but alot of people are expecting it to not pass just like sailing.
---
I love runelite enough to be a [patreon supporter](https://www.patreon.com/runelite), which is something that not enough people do, consider helping out the developer and provide your support guys!
---
I honestly think that without third party clients like Runelite OSRS would be in a much worse state right now, many players see it as a vital part of the game and we should all show our support.
---
Buying vials of water
---
Dungeoneering !!!! Was so fun as a kid to play with my friends, now that we're older(know slightly more than before) it would be even more fun.
---
We have blocks and skips for those we really hate, but I feel a lot of people might rethink some of them if they weren't quite as tedious. I know I might skips 3 tasks before i finally find one or just decide to stop blowing points. Just a way to have a bit more variety in the mix personally.  
---
Thank you for the support!
---
Yoink them bones
---
Especially in the catacombs
---
Ohhh, okay.  I was looking at the current version of Pado’s and confused. 
---
I feel that, ideally it would require some vis from high level equipment to make so it’s not super cheap and accessible.   That req feels kinda low as well.
---
Chinese company already sold Jagex
---
Vote yes to pvp
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Add me, "ThisMuchDad" in game! I'm in basically the same scenario!
---
how many hours that would be?
---
Elite is; not sure about regular
---
Gotta farm
---
Your opinion is valued my fellow scaper. Tho my crafting lvl is wayy lower than his. So id rather buy than try recreating those :p but i agree that it could use some refining and improvement ;)
---
im glad u havent vote before, ape
---
i provided jagex with original creation details which included things like original ip adress the account was created in like 2005 all correct recovery answers and 3 of the first passwords ever used on account... got denied. tried again but this time only with payment id from like 2017 guess what instant access... what bunch of horseshit
---
I’d rather have more skills than less.. RuneScape would be boring as shit with only like 3 skills, combat, resource-gathering, and production. The more the merrier if u ask me
---
2007scape was dead in the water for a long time until good content started to be added lol.
---
Nice, I've got like 30-40 with no drops
---
love me some troglodyte comments
---
Lol what do you have against hammers bro?
---
You use more than that when you're killing melee hand
---
Ah that’s great! Haha I’m uk time zone and mostly play after I finish work ✌🏻
---
"VOTE YES FOR MY MERCHES"
---
Seriously.  Imagine if you applied some of the criticisms to skills like smithing.  You'd end up gutting the core of OSRS.
---
WHAT?!? We lost out on a fucking SAILING skill
---
The question on everyone's lips.
---
Piss off
---
Sounds like you're the  neurotic sanctimonious cry baby.
---
Really hope that wasn’t me... doing my bird house soon to find out
---
that doesn't look like 2000 words
---
I ate a gout tuber because I didn't know the value and thought it was useless food wasting space in my inventory.
---
Looked it up a few minutes later, realized I made like a 500k mistake and got another one within 20 mins or so.
---
2k kills is nothing. It's a 1/5k drop
---
Because it's not fun.
---
I mean personally I think the black is way too much.
---
that's not an argument for warding though, its an argument how you dont like skilling. if you think that way why would you want MORE of the same with warding?
---
Yeah stuff like metal dragons are annoying because they're like 50 bronze dragons. If it was like 20 maybe I'd go and do it. 
---
One thing to consider is that it would get people to the task milestones quicker, and they could just turn it off for the big milestones of points. I dont think its a huge problem, but you considered most other things already :)
---
...How does this relate to the point at hand which is twitter brainlets doing exactly what you aren't?
---
Yeah yeah we get it you don't like people talking about trump.
---
Agreed all around. If we look at the last 4 skills of the 2007 version of RS2, they're all good examples (IMO) of what good skills look like: hunter (varied training methods, no bankstanding, adds lots of content to other skills and areas of the game), construction (grindy training, but made up for by adding tons of rewarding content that makes the grind worthwhile), farming (varied training methods, various rewards to make the grind worthwhile), and slayer (all around fantastic skill IMO). Those 4 skills are the point of comparison for me of what a new skill needs to look like in terms of fun, rewards, and level of player engagement.
---
Alan gone be pissssssed
---
NUUBS only 10 mil xp in a week lmao
---
&gt; Just because that combat is the meta at Edgeville and gets you the most Bounty Hunter points shouldn't entitle them to pickup timers or weapons nerfs and other hand-holding shit.
---
&gt; I may be overlapping a lot of issues there but in a nutshell, pure and CLAN combat have created a number of interesting problems I think Jagex have given undue weight to.
---
What kind of bad pvp changes were clans or pures responsible for?
---
Unfortunately I'm Central Time (US) but maybe on the weekends we could boss or something! HMU next time you see me online in game!
---
Green is not a creative color.
---
Every skill in RS already has a well defined purpose and core gameplay loop, unlike combat before Slayer.
---
We don’t need warding to rework smithing and crafting...
---
Multiple times every stream he brags and laughs about how he had been in way more debt. He prides this with her got out no problem. The reason he was able to get out of that debt is he was fencing billions of go for BTCs and was given billions in donations in stream or "if you win give it back, if you lose don't worry" or "do something crazy" as a front for the GP until he got perm banned for it. Now he doesn't have this sugar daddy, statistics say it will be extremely hard to climb out of that by staking only. Especially his main method of triple bet all winning stakes, or any method. This debt staking is simply a legal pyramid scheme dug deep. There is now a person offering debt consolidation services for his lenders accepting debt at 75% of what they are owed.

Buying gf
---
Actually i voted for B, i thought it looked most natural or had the best old school look. Congratulations on getting an honorable mention!
---
u right
---
I kinda of like this but I think it needs to be relatively subtle. That's kind of what we have Skill Capes for to begin with, but adding more options would be cool!
---
Yes, gunboat diplomacy
---
I can appreciate the positivity, but at the same time I'm not going to try and deny the power of memes either.
---
Most communities online cant be trusted with polling, because most communities dont know whats good for the games. The average player doesnt have the ability to see how a skill/item will do in the long term and just votes against it. Im all for keeping the integrity of OSRS, but fuck i dont want to keep playing the same game from 2007 with zero updates.
---
Even tho us government is considered to corrupt. They realized early on that if electoral votes are the only way to come to a decision. To many people having an opinion will never result is a conclusion.
---
Dont mean to be an ass, but I know what I'm talking about when it comes to color choice.
---
The trap remix goes dumb
---
Works for me.
---
They actually did originally but they thought it was too confusing and they never even specified how you'd get it. Boggles my mind that despite most of the content here being better designed than the blog back in April, they actually took steps backwards in some regards.
---
Neither am i, just (idiotic) cheap lol, refused to spend 650k just for a shitty diary part :P
---
Thank you brotha, much love
---
Well too bad for you the people who actually created the game dont consider it cheating, so eat a big ol dick lmao
---
there are noobs in there too. on one of my accounts my partner got himself stuck and i had to open the guide and give him point by point instructions of what to do until i finally realized hes phoenix and not actually black arm like he said he was. didnt help that he had a wpm count of &lt;15
---
How tf do I get a quest cape?! I need one they look awesome
---
Changes to BM and MM were bad too. The rotations were unfun and the abilities were bland, at least compared to what they were in, say, Cata or MoP. It had been a long time coming though, ever since they started the 'pruning' of the spellbooks.
---
Then they removed Survival, saying they would incorporate it into MM's talents, but they didn't. That colossally bad taste in my mouth combined with BM and MM being in some of the worst states that they've ever been in (as far as enjoyment is concerned) did me in. Blizzard refused to accept that they done messed up with SV, and pursued their 'vision' for the class despite the outcry from the hunter community, clinging to their pride and arrogance. That's why so many hunters stopped playing in Legion, whether they stopped playing WoW or just stopped playing Hunter.
---
well that information isn't really that hard to get.
---
you are most likely getting your recovery questions wrong and if so i doubt anything else matters.
---
Nothing wrong with adding another layer of interesting challenging raid content to be one level above other money makers..
---
right, but whether or not *an individual* makes money doesn't change anything. the fact is that pking is a less-than-zero sum game. it obviously doesn't make sense to describe it as a moneymaking method since overall the playerbase loses money from doing it, even though some individuals do come out profiting.
---
in that regard, it is pretty much identical to the duel arena. which is what i'm saying. no ignorance here lol.
---
Yep same issue with BFA here, i leveled both a Hordie and Alliance to 120, on Alliance I leveled a Disc priest and it took an ungodly amount of time to do anything. On Horde I leveled a Hunter and once I hat 120 scaling kicked in and everything started 1-shotting me for no reason.
---
It's such a shame because the story for BFA is phenomenal, but I don't want to play the game at all.
---
I had to do this task a couple times too. I think the game is a little finicky in what you can do to still meet the task. Just do it again and I bet it works
---
If a quest is completed that requires y previous XP and gives 12k exp, you're not allowed to go under y+12k total exp for that skill.
---
Only members can vote in polls
---
This whole place was designed to be an aggregate news outlet where theoretically users filter out what's unimportant.
---
In practice, it's just people censoring things they disagree with. 
---
Reddit is good for just a few things: tech solutions, breaking news, and niche content (game-specific subreddits).
---
This is going to sound elitist, but the more populated the subreddit is with average people, the worse off it is. It's some sort of tragedy of the commons effect where people attempt to pander to the lowest common denominator of humor and bad memes. That being said, this subreddit has some serious quality content creators compared to most.
---
lol? its still up on the main page
---
Who isn’t ready with the alts to get the worst skill idea stopped.
---
That crow is such a nice guy
---
Sup cay cunt
---
Yes, and like almost everyone else - me included - back in the day you were a noob. If you think you were anything else with those stats honestly you’re delusional.
---
Elite dungeons is more like bossing. That's not Dungeoneering. Dungeoneering is "the skill of the skills", all your other skills are useful for training it.
---
I'm interested in new skills too, just not one that's just lighting logs on fire when ranges already make it useless
---
Wish I could get the torch but this guys gets a phoenix
---
This is secretly a covert way of trying to get people to hire you to do inferno capes? If so, its working. ;)
---
Sorry for no pet, but damn dude, that's impressive.

would it possible to just test-run the content somehow? test run 1 or 2 weeks with the content being accessible at an increased xp rate so people can give it a try or not then poll the skill after that trial period. If it passes then maybe just reduce all the xp everyone acquired by the same xp multiplier that was originally applied so the time isn't completely wasted, or maybe just allow people to level to a cap? idk but at this point nobody is gonna say yes unless people can see it for themselves.
---
It isn’t the majority opinion at least 60% of the osrs subreddit is for warding as seen by the top posts and comments on virtually every post being pro warding.
---
Hi, I'm a friends of Lynx Titian, we are composed of a vast underground community of 99ers, absoulutley we will not support another 200m skill to acheive. We have locations in Singapore, Colombia, and you guessed it Velenuzlia, the people of 99ers, will not vote for a new 200m skill.
---
I used the same setup with bp and addy arts and the range prayer 15%.. killed them pretty fast
---
It hurts when I see someone so much better at this game than me
---
you bring chins, ill bring runes for barraging.
---
and here we see an angry cheater after he got called out for cheating
---
sad :(
---
Yeah you know that upvote button next to the downvote? Educate me on that too and maybe you will understand why this post has upvotes (hint: people think it's funny, kind of like your first claim).
---
Doing quests
---
Hunters were broken at the beginning of legion, as well as after getting two legendaries during Nighthold progression. Their kit might have felt a little boring, but I dont know if it is a statistical fact that "a ton of hunters quit." I knew a ton of boomkins and demo locks switching to hunter for that sick barrage dmg.
---
True story, the guy i did Shield of Arrav with became a good friend and years later, after leaving and coming back to the game, we both just happened to become members and did heroes quest too. Kept in good contact for a while but that was a while ago on Original RuneScape. Good times!
---
If I spent 1 hour a day every day with no breaks. Sure. That's casual right? 
---
That's roughly £100K worth of labor for me.
---
It's also an hour a day I can't exercise, walk my dogs, tend to my garden, tutor my kids, spend time with my partner. 
---
We're not all folks who can dedicate their life to a game from the naughties. The perspective of casual really skews when you have a full time job, family and other responsibilities.
---
Rune crafting is making runes. The same way fletching is to ranged.
---
Yet we still have crafting for making the ranged armour.
---
nope
---
Yes they do. They know the game is rigged.
---
I really wish that it was you were wrong but sadly you’re right. :/
---
Legit asking, why not add it? So far the only arguments I've heard against it as "its rc2" and "it sucks"
---
Which kind of quests? + are there any f2p quests where I can get a cape?
---
Complete all Quests. (miniquests do not have to be completed).
---
Start asap. The sooner you complete much Quests, the better
---
r/thedonald
---
The neckbeards would let a new skill enter the game if it wasn't such a useless waste of 99 total levels... ALL of the warding content could be added to runecrafting. 
---
Smithing makes melee armour and weapons
---
crafting makes ranged armour and mage weapons
---
Fletching makes Ranged weapons and ammunition
---
Runecrafting makes mage ammunition
---
..
---
See the void?
---
or let people vote what they wanna vote for and dont follow the hivemind.
---
Bring dungeoneering back
---
Like p2p or f2p? I’m a f2p player bc I don’t got no job and I aint planning on getting one as a 13 year old
---
What? No one said anything about that.
---
Flamtaer or go fuck your mother

Getting an extra bond to vote no specifically because of your post
---
fight caves has very little to do with the inferno, you only need to do it once for acces
---
I'm not sure which ones. I wouldn't risk the chance of a ban.
---
Most things look straight up glitched without it on imo, i never noticed before using it and turning it off to laugh at the old animations
---
INB4 op is actually in a clan baiting more people to skull.
---
Go back to RS3 rs3 chick!
---
&gt;Since mage is pretty broken right now, pkers often opt to use those robes so they minimize their risk without losing out on that much anyway.
---
Wait what LOL? Youre insinuating mage is broken in the way that its TOO STRONG? Jesus christ how are so many people on this sub genuinely this clueless about the PvP aspect of the game and yet act like they know everything about it despite never actually participating in it?
---
Mage is by far the weakest DPS in PvP, mage accuracy is dog shit because of how magic defense is calculated...hence why Jagex is polling changing the calculation to 50/50. 
---
Also, virtually no one actually regularly PKs in salad robes in singles. What youre referring to is the majority of people in REV CAVE because its a multi area that huge teams are always at so your probability of dying is much higher, and you dont need some great DPS setup to kill when you have a team of 5-10 people with you. And even then, I dont think you realize most people in basic salad robes setups are still risking like 150-200k and some more lol. IF you wear salad robes in singles, you lose out on A LOT, youll be bullied by other PKers(not to mention not have any shot of killing anyone at Chins or wherever else youre pking in singles) the vast majority of whom are in different mystics sets ranging from 600k-3m+ in risk. Tons of people are regularly risking 1.5-2m because using a blessed SS and d boots is a very common setup. There are FAR more people risking 1m+ pking in the common singles areas than there are people pking in salad robes and rag.
---
Please actually have experience and knowledge of what youre talking about before you start trying to educate people...it only continues to reinforce stupid memes like this one as being true and people genuinely believing it when all the people who ACTUALLY PK say that it isnt.
---
opensource =/ safe, sure it helps but that doesn't mean it can push out a bad update.
---
I'm imagining a vote weighting that scales down based on common ip address.  Because a poll should really be a vote for a person, not a vote for every account played even if they are actual legitimate alt play accounts.
---
I started ToB with 99 str, 99 range, 94 mage and mid 80 att/def. I've done ToB with a pure with 42 def and 75 attack and he generally did fine (and he brought a gilded defender for style). I'd say the minimum is 94 magic (Ice barrage is required), high enough attack to wield a whip or scythe, enough defense for void (or Bandos) and max strength/range for damage output.
---
Lmao or maybe I just played other parts of the game? I had probably 5k gwd kc, maybe 3k PK's and was always looking for the next pkri or war...
---
Definitely not a noob, just never devoted time to skilling for 2k total.
---
Sorry to hear you were a noob back then though, I see some things never change :/
---
It would massively devalue runecrafting and a kick in the teeth for people who have put in the grind to 99.
---
I mean you’re getting downvoted but you’re obviously right that a ton of new content has been added to OSRS without a new skill being added.
---
Also, yes lots of pvm has been added but idk why people shit on that. The fact of the matter is combat is a huge portion of the game and the endgame combat mode is high lvl pvm which is so much better and more diverse than it was back when OSRS started.
---
I will absolutely support jagex adding more skilling content going forward and I would love things like stealing creation, smithing updates, rc updates, and I might even vote for awarding. But saying that being opposed to warding = wanting OSRS to die from lack of new content is just silly.
---
I like enchanting personally.
---
I am groot.
---
as a zerk that 70 def req hurts my soul
---
All of em, f2p and P2p. But if u really want a f2p cape im pretty sure the cabbage one is the only available option.
---
You do all the quests, f2p and p2p, once you’ve completed them all, you get your quest cape.
---
Because it is actual steaming garbage. I'll admit that I didn't raid after the first so I cant comment on that, but BFA has been utter trash. I've lost so many good friends because we would play wow together (vanilla guild), but now no one wants to get on. The game is easily in its worst state, and the good systems (m+, raids, organized party content), are bogged down by awful progression that means nothing if it doesnt warforge.
---
Dharok could be a fun mode for LMS, if they want to introduce different modes of it.
---
yes ma’am anything for you
---
Good luck! I recommend the WDR discord to find learner raids with other 0kc players, as the 416 FFA world doesn't typically have many learner groups running about. Get geared and work for it, took me like 20 attempts for my first kc and it's paying off.
---
Hmm. Didn't know that. Although at nearly 70, you'd think at least easy's would pop up.
---
I feel like it could be added to magic and runecrafting if people weren’t scared of their rcing grinds being devalued.
---
oooooooooook you're just a degenerate
---
yeah dw I'm voting no
---
Zuhaar will single handedly turn the tides and get warding passed
---
such is the cycle of rs, everyone wants something except what's offered
---
What’s that quest called and does that cape have a purpose is nah?
---
Smithing makes melee armour and weapons  
---
crafting makes ranged armour and mage weapons  
---
Fletching makes Ranged weapons and ammunition  
---
Runecrafting makes mage ammunition  
---
..  
---
If you have a dog you neglect, you don't go buy another dog because you're bored.
---
glad you finally understand. good talk
---
A new skill is not only "Another crafting", it's a platform for new content. Adding warding to runecrafting and crafting will make it either op or dead content. Instead, warding on its own is a new place for new content, instead of trying to balance it out in other skills. The skills in Runescape are simple, just look at woodcutting and firemaking, no one is complaining or trying to merge older skills into fewer ones.

Calm down old boy, you couldn't leave it at your original "k" reply. You sat there for a few minutes and let it stew just to come back here and edit that reply into whatever you call this. That is satisfying enough for me. Have a good day!
---
Kid you sound like you wanna be featured on the front page of /r/iamverysmart
---
Serious question: Why can't warding be split up into three skills and make them more viable to the game versus putting in a whole new skill?
---
If they can get wet you could use this (technique)[https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/5t006a/making_floating_glass_dolls/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share]

---
There is no requeriments for it and it has no proprose what so ever XD
---
&gt; If they refuse taking fights that are unfavourable to them, then wouldn't that be a smart choice to take? Why try to fight an uphill battle when you can willingly choose to be the one at an advantage instead?
---
Most players know this and this is exactly why pkers are hated so much.
---
Who says you'd have to destroy xp rates? add the content at the same rates the skill already has. Nothing devalued, missing content added.
---
How would they shut it down exactly? It's open source and the makers of the fork are not required to listen to jagex
---
Imagine thinking that over 75% of voting players are neckbeards who are out to ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Warding imo serves no purpose whatsoever except to cash grab a few maxed players who will have yet another grind to get their max cape back, it would make far more sense as an addition to other skills to improve many different grindy skills, as it's presented, it's just another grind to suck players in. I don't understand why we can't just rework the bad, boring skills everyone hates, rather than adding another boring grind to the game. The logic is basically "we have like 5 skills that we all hate, lets add another rather than revamping the ones we hate!"
---
That's why I'm voting no, you can improve the game without adding a new skill. Did invention make rs3 more fun? Did summoning make rs3 more fun? Dung? No, but dung was a really fun part of the game, unfortunately it being a skill sucked and made no sense, it was a good minigame, bad skill, summining? Bad skill, not fun, grindy, did not improve the game, people just liked the rewards, that's literally it. 
---
Tldr; if your only way of making the game last longer is to make players grind even longer to max, you aren't improving the game. Maxed players still play the game, why? Because there's things other than skills to do in Runescape that make it fun.
---
What skills do you consider fun outside of combat/slayer ? Thats the only skills people like lol.
---
This looks nothing like hunter. Hunter is a much lighter washed out brown with a totally different trim.
---
case and point, grow the fuck up and speak to others like a normal fucking human being, not everyone is posting with the intent to make you upset. you are the first one to post either "retard" or "neck beard". I asked for a normal discussion, you dont have to engage, but when you did it was negative. You are part of the reason for this hostile community.
---
It's so frustrating that humanity has such a struggle with discussing ideas in a reasonable way. For example, both sides in this situation feel very strongly about their beliefs, and both sides have valid arguments, yet there is no civil discussion between the two to see each other's side of the fence. It just turns into a childish war where both sides call each other retards via memes.
---
Who's there!
---
Wait so you don’t want to grind 99 smithing for your full set of rune amour before leveling past 40 defense?
---
I am sure more training methods will be pooled in future updates if the skill pass. Every skill gain more ways to train over time.
---
It doesnt even give you money anymore except for super high level because of bloated PvM drops ruining gathering skills
---
FIREMAKING .... Like what the fuck...
---
I just reported you for sexual harassment
---
"8 alts and a main" that's just fucking sad
---
yea, maybe you’re right, i get it. warding is still stupid though.
---
Yep exactly. I can definitely play on 1440p, but it's much more tedious. 4k would be unimaginably small.
---
oooooh shit I didn't see that lmfao. I thought it was the kill after. A dude not too long ago killed graardor and as soon as he died he sees the pet follow him for 1 second before he gets sent back to lumby.
---
? if u dislike the update and find it damaging for the game. Then expressing no in an attempt to keep it under 75% is absolutely valid.
---
It is not fake votes.
---
Hoe long until we’re all that “Gay Cunt”?
---
Case and point.
---
I came here expecting a neck beard argument, but was pleasantly surprised
---
It shot up before that because it was free and better in almost every way
---
Cringe
---
wait how does a UIM complete SOA without trading?
---
Wow someone’s Mom bought the wrong pizza rolls at the store today. Calm your flappy tits and respect OP’s attempts at a constructive debate.
---
It's not great content, and there's great content on this sub. Just not the same stupid spade memes every day littering the front page.
---
but good job, you sure proved me wrong by immediately attacking me personally. I definitely see why i should vote yes now
---
Finally, a regular comment.
---
I mean, smiting could be dissolved into defense, and fetching into ranged. its more so for the flavor aspect I and the idea of adding a new avenue for quests/gear/content to be added that i'm looking forward towards. I suppose Runecrafting is dry as hell, but again people are testy when it comes to changing that skill at all.
---
So wouldn't it make more sense for Runecrafting to make Mage ammunition and weapons like Fletching while a different skill does armor? I also wouldn't say Crafting makes Magic Weapons; it technically does but the magic comes from the orbs, made from Magic, and Crafting just screws them on.
---
Yeah but these are the magic level required or else 3rd age would be t30
---
No and I have no clue why. We’re weird in establishing systems of measurement (See Imperial System)
---
Then I'd rather see them work on currently lacking skills like thieving, construction and herblore than them releasing a new WIP skill
---
I don't see how vengeance on a 1 def pure would be game breaking /s
---
What a nonsensical reason. Bloating other skill tables is much worse. A new skill also gives Jagex a place to focus new updates, instead of eventually easy scaping or cluttering every skill in the game.
---
I respect your ability to vote no, but your reason lacks any real support.
---
Any trimmed armor is better than both of those. I can trim yours for free if you’d like.
---
You guys are nuts, good work &lt;3
---
Oddly enough, this is the first time I have seen a max cape be called a "good boy cape" (I am sure I have been missing out, we all discover things at different paces). 
---
Now I will never be able to call it anything else.  Thank you, and I truly mean it.
---
I don't PvP so can't comment there (though I don't think it offers a lot in that regards besides tagging gear for more visibility in invent for swaps, and having the spec button be clickable? Someone more experienced would need to chime in there).
---
For pvm definitely not. Not many runelite features are necessity for anything, they're mostly creature comforts and important/useful QoL (like interfaces scaling to actual screen resolutions, GPU plugin giving any PC with a dedicated GPU much more consistent 50 frames, smoother animations, longer render distances, larger zoom (though default client is in a good state for this now).
---
You by no means need runelite. But it's free and open source and has lots of little useful things, so I'd always recommend trying it.
---
I think essentially loot text on the ground, interface scaling, bank tags and farming timers are the main uses I get regularly out of runelite. Agility highlights were super nice while working on max too.
---
How does it choose who to give the spare money to?
---
Lets say it paired a 1gp offer with a sale of 1m; how does it decide to give the difference to either the buyer or the seller?
---
I think I'm probably just retarded and having a hard time understanding this because I'm drunk, but I'm still asking the question.
---
I don’t know what that means but sure! I am a low level and noob tho
---
:) good luck!
---
Of course it will affect players since to "Fit" into the world it needs to be intergrated to quests/diaries but this isnt a con for any new skill more a requirement to make it seemless.
---
Ignore those players they are more then likey baiting reactions, they cant honestly believe any major content introduced will only afffect those who want to.
---
You know... more than 1 skill can be added.. right?
---
I just wish I knew where to start with learning raids...
---
lmaoo it sucks so much man
---
You guys are so fast haha, thanks :)
---
Reason for voting no?
---
Def is literally meaningless, don’t even bother training it in tob. Slayer/nmz only at this point. Especially if you’re doing ffas you want to squeeze out as much dps as possible to try to yoink points from rooms
---
everything in this game is "work in progress"
---
A few of my pker friends do it with untradables when they get ganked or run our of supplies in 1v1s. Drop barrows gloves, d boots with orny kit, fire cape, etc
---
Precisely. It's not affecting the actual use of Gmaul at all, it's just making that use come with actual risk instead of being able to rag people with a 30k spec weapon at risk.
---
Me as well. Went from "Hell no." To a solid yes, the reworks have made me genuinely hopeful it sees the light of day in game.
---
Looks like a older Corolla with a digital dash
---
Only low or low/medium on a commercial or electric stove, your standard household gas stove won't heat up a pan enough to actually fry things at that setting.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I personally think not skulling and using better gear is better.
---
Man it looks like they have a put a lot of time and effort into designing this skill thats essentially tailoring/scrapping. I'd love a new skill, but my Jimmies arent rustled from this.
---
Sadly I have to vote no. Sorry devs.
---
Lmao what? Anecdotal evidence 
---
Sample size 2
---
I've always been interested to know what other players drive. Who has 99 turbo?🤔
---
If a majority of the stuff ends up being high alch price while the higher tier gear settles slightly higher than high alch price then I feel like the skill as a whole is a success. Rune armor and dhide is at alch price and if you look at dragon equipment, most of the weapons are at alch price as well. 
---
Why does this new skill have to be held at a higher standard?
---
Ok.
---
Stop stealing
---
Or at least balance-able. It may or may not be fully balanced in its current form (it seems that it probably is but we don't have enough details to say for sure.) But there's quite a difference between a couple features that need balancing versus almost every feature needs balancing. And if is it a matter of just tweaking a couple numbers or changing some drop rates? Or is it more involved?
---
Those are different teams? Also the security flaws impact both games so they need to talk with RS3 regarding it? Also the Web team to get authentication on the website?
---
You're missing the point, but it's ok.
---
My biggest gripe are the Fahrenheit system, and the month/date/year thing tbh
---
I'd like a new skill that adds one or multiple entirely new mechanics into the game. Something that is truly different than other skills. I feel like this lukewarm approach to magic-gear crafting doesn't really justify a new skill.
---
And before you say "Plenty of skills are similar" I am aware that a lot of artisan skills share mechanics, those are old skills. Skills that have been in the game long since before 2007. Think about any new skill Runescape has seen.
---
Hunter: added the entirely new mechanic of placing traps to catch animals. Brought in the first ranged-AoE equipment (chins) as filling some gaps in low level content for other skills. This is probably the least unique "New skill" the game has ever seen and it still brings more to the table than warding will.
---
Construction: brought the ability to create a personal house, brought new teleports, new minigames, the ability to create teleport tablets, and a brand new method of training prayer. Plus letting other people visit your house and socially creating a whole new side of the game via house parties.
---
Dungeoneering: Brought with it the biggest and most complex minigame Runescape has ever seen. Brought dozens of new skilling locations and rewards that assist gameplay without just beig static buffs as well as new untradable gear that was actually worth getting.
---
Summoning: This introduced the new mechanic of being able to summon creatures with uses. Creatures that could hold items, creatures that could fight for you or boost your stats, even creatures that could heal you. Also gave creatures special moves which could be used in creative ways and created new incentive for PvM via charm drops, so that suddenly creatures that were considered unviable were now a niche way to train combat and summoning efficiently.
---
Divination: The first gathering/artisan combined skill that allows you to gather energy and fuse it with items to create new skilling methods and genuinely useful items that were not seen until the release of the skill. Giving us an item sink and opening up the door for invention.
---
Invention: Brought the concept of disassembling items, an incredible item sink. Allows you to augment armor and weapons and give them perks to increase their effectiveness in unique ways. Also allows you to do the same with tools. Added in dozens of new items in the game, as well as machines that automate typically tedious processes like turning logs into planks or casting high-alchemy, which prior to invention were not useful actions to high level accounts.
---
Warding: It's like smithing but you make magic items. Disassemble stuff for vis to create mid-level armor. Oh and you can also imbue rings without having to camp nightmare zone, but only if that section of the poll passes. Probably will be a decent item sink but it won't bring any new mechanics or effects into the game.
---
I disagree my dude. But I respect you for having your own opinion. I think it has a lot of pro's to offer to the game. Item sink, fills in the gaps with magic armour, ect.
---
There is also the Minigame. I think there are some other methods too, but it is not Crafting diversity yet. While I'd love to see Warding have Crafting's variety, it seems they are focusing more on the core of the skill before making it more complex.
---
I’d advise to look up Asukayen on YT for some good guides, imo at least. He’s carried me through a couple of bosses already and his guides overall are pretty complete and ‘noob friendly’.
---
Wow because 120 invention takes 0 time at all.... how in the hell is this anything like invention other than dissolving? You legit siphon from armor/weapons to level invention. 
---
I also with 90% of RS3 players have 120 invention.
---
Read all of them. Still voting no.
---
Niche set, if you have a limited budget, I'd first consider what you actually want to do, then buy items for those activities. Skirt is kinda good though until you can afford Tassets.
---
That's Gielinor's ass.
---
Here's the biggest problem with it all, people who have already done it, don't care about people who didn't. 
---
In reality, players matter very little to eachother outside the context of group content. I don't care if rendi has a level 18 FC account, it's super cool, it's a huge achievement, he earned it and I respect that. It's his achievement that he did for himself. 
---
It has no bearing on the way I play MY game. If you can't be proud of your own accomplisments it doesn't matter how hard the skill is or continues to be. More people will get 99, more people will get 200M. The value of a 99 drops the longer the game exists. 
---
If someone paid runners to do RC is their cape really more impressive than the UIM with 99 RC?  It's the same cape regardless of the path to get it. AFK bloods didn't exist before. That's new content. I bet the people who already had 99 rc reee'd really hard when that came out.
---
I need a magnifying glass to see on fixed mode lol
---
We pay, we slay, we gay.
---
I'll vote yes.
---
Warding should just be a remaster to runecrafting imo.
---
Vskirt is great for slayer tasks where you don't pray overheads but pray something like piety, there it is my go-to leg slot and I use prossy top or bcp with it. Vhelm is good for most bossing I guess
---
Dungeoneering was the best because It was extremely fun, could be done alone or with friends, useful rewards, trained most of your skills in one, AND it could be done endlessly with literally 0gp on your account. Dg will be forever unmatched.
---
It's almost like the purpose of a business is to make money, so they do things that make them the most money. What a surprise.
---
I hit the Visage on 40 kc yesterday. Keep it going champ, you’ll get the pet in no time with this luck.
---
They had a plan to change them as part of the integrity stuff, but it hasn't been a high priority. I'd agree it has been something left hanging for too long, but they do have multiple teams so they can make new content while updating old content and dealing with integrity issues (i.e. they've been working on recent PvP integrity stuff and new player experience alongside Song of the Elves). Hopefully, they do get back to the Death System this year; their pitch had a lot of improvements to the current system that would be nice to have.
---
Uh Ha Ha
---
Feel free to
---
Warding is not necessary for the future of the game. Any other particular skill chosen as a candidate for the next skill is not necessary, either. But \*some\* skill is necessary. It's been far too long without a new skill.
---
That’s a bruh moment
---
People still use twatter?
---
warding bad
---
I think the idea that combat ability should be exclusive to the combat skills is kind flawed. The idea behind Runescape is that everything flows together and becomes more than a sum of its parts. Herblore changes combat for instance, Its almost like the SlayerScape players only cares about slayer and riots if they have to do literally anything else.
---
"Why does mining have to be tied to smithing and crafting? I hate Mining but love smithing!"
---
That would be the same thing. The game should strive to incorporate things into all aspects of the game, and have it be relevant outside its own little bubble
---
He is not posting on r/sweden though Serene used to do that a lot
---
100% agree
---
With this logic couldn’t you say the same with mining and smithing?
---
Depends what you're intending to use it for. If you're slaying 24/7, odds on favorite the skirt is the optimal choice as the helmet slot will be taken and it provides more defence than proselyte though at the cost of +2 prayer. Most people wont prioritise prayer over DPS.
---
Don't tell me how to vote.
---
I never used a spec wep with DHCB, the kills go just as fast it seems. Maybe even faster than pulling out the melee set up just to whiff two specs.
---
You can barely stand there and attack?
---
I don't think dissolving will have as wide a spread or long-term benefit if it was packaged this way. These skills already have training options, and making dissolving compete with already set exp rates will never happen, especially if it involved RC (which is the most logical, really liked the idea tbh)
---
Basically, take smithing for example. If you were to stuff smithing into the crafting skill (which is logical in real-world sense), the value of bars/ore wouldn't be as stable since players have plenty of other training options, like bstaves. But then bars/ore fall in price, become new meta, followed by bstaves falling, ect., eventually having the opposite effect of what was originally intended.
---
The problem is there's no indication of such for high level items
---
It's all steel platebodies and robetops in their examples.
---
There's only going to be like 5 types of vis
---
Now they're also saying you can splash for vis, so I really don't know what to believe.
---
Either because they remember playing rs2 before EoC and all the good memories of it, so when EoC came out it ruined a lot of their ideas of the game so they quit keep on thinking its a complete dumpster fire. The warding part is because some osrs players refuse to want things to change for what could be the better, as im guessing youve seen memes and such around the reddit page :)
---
I have yet to see an actual explanation as to why "warding good vote yes" other than "it sounds epic and I need something new to do in my miserable life"
---
You're literally just repeatedly falling back on the same argument he already addressed.
---
Bwana why you gotta pull out the hard  B
---
It’s not passing
---
put some gp on these games &amp; nobody is complaining
---
weird flex...
---
All of them who use ballista's are hypocrites. They just want to hang on to there skillcapes so they can feel better about themselves because they have no friends because they're neckbeards.
---
There are a lot of things that you find out by testing content that just don’t end up being thought of when you look at it from a design sheet. Also a lot of people who might have good ideas that others could rally behind haven’t given it much thought because it doesn’t actually even exist yet.
---
There’s no way that it is as fleshed our now as it could be with 6 months of live play and feedback.
---
Fletching is crafting but to ranged gear
---
Do you wanna keep going down this road because all of RuneScape skills are the same
---
Wait why are people surprised by this? It's a law of math.
---
99+99=198 - 98+1=99
---
198+99=297 - 97+2=99
---
Like of course this keeps going for a while...
---
Umm, more pkers doing LMS means less pkers in wildy.
---
don't be a defeatist youre just making it harder to pass
---
Nice construction pure you got there
---
Don’t do quests and you’ll get one
---
Anyone saying this is a season to vote no is crazy.
---
When’s the poll
---
If you do hespori I would forsure. It cuts off around 12h of growtime so u can fight it daily
---
im voting no LUL
---
He's just doing it for fun, it literally changes nothing. He just can't see his character but everybody else can. If anything, this hinders himself if he messes up a gear switch or something like that it's just harder to notice. I have no idea what you're confused about here..
---
99 warding brings back nieve to be your waifu
---
You speak of acting maturely yet you started your post with an insult. I welcome all criticism and read through it all - I want this to have the best chance it can and that’s only possible by listening to the community. 
---
You may say that a lot of players don’t want the skill, yourself I presume are within that group (sorry if I’m misjudging you), and that if we were to have truly listened, we would have dropped it already and moved on without polling. When have we ever done that? How is that fair to those who do want it?
---
I’m not saying the skill is flawless, otherwise it would have unanimous support and that I don’t believe is possible. Hell, people even voted no to the world map update - what possible reason could someone say no to that? I’m genuinely curious!
---
Regardless, you’ve already come to the assumption that it will fail the poll, which is fair enough. I personally can’t predict the future but I certainly won’t blame anyone if it fails, like you’re accusing me of. I also wasn’t saying that you think attack and strength should be combined, I’m saying the criticism of “Warding doesn’t fit as its own unique skill” isn’t a defined requirement as most skills are not unique as many are quite similar. Like attack and strength or crafting and fletching. Sorry that I wasn’t clearer before.
---
Anyway, I’m sorry you feel like I’m the wrong person for the job. I’ve played runescape since 2004 - I stopped for a while during the dark ages - and my most memorable moments were skill releases as they truly brought the world alive with activity. If my goals are misguided and my work not good enough for you, I can only apologise and promise I’ll keep loving the job and hoping people like my work as I grow and learn from the mistakes.
---
Your not wrong.
---
The community has gone down hill in a big way the last couple years.
---
Originally I think people did to protect their account info but it's become a bit of a meme to excessively block out info on these types of posts.
---
I think the other player can just use the item on the uim and it will transfer into their inventory or onto the ground for them to pick up
---
You can not, also triple jads are imo the easiest part
---
Well the evidence is speaking for itself: I see a way higher percentage toxic language in wilderness than I ever could dream of seeing on the court. You can say "it's not set in stone" - no it is not. But I can see a correlation if not causation. And even a correlative relationship means that toxicity will be reduced if we remove one side of it.
---
Yeah I like this idea, always wondered if there was a tool for this I guess there isn’t
---
Man you wiki guys are awesome!
---
BuT WhY nOt JuSt AdD It To RuNeCrAfTiNg
---
No of course, but I do contribute to the runelite repo and there’s so many eyes on it, given that Adam and the main team manually review all the changes that are pushed into the master branch, it’s so highly unlikely that if someone wanted to write malicious code that it would actually get pushed into the app. Also that’s why you use 2factor auth, even if they get your pass they’ll need your code to login.
---
Why are you playing this game if you think skills suck? This game is kind of mostly about skills
---
TLDR: A lvl 123 in shitty armour comes up to me and starts asking me random questions. We start chatting meanwhile hes dropping items around me to troll the whole time. He starts with a whip and then third age mage bottoms and i log my main under me in another world and sneakily log in to scoop it. He said he had rapier on him and he was gonna drop it next...gg free 20m
---
If that were true they would have forced the skill a long time ago with things too op for the game... At least they're giving you a choice now.
---
Again, how fast do you think it should be? 85 hours is 152k xp/h
---
34 hours is 382k xp/h
---
What is a reasonable xp/h to you, because those seem fine to me
---
Mate, I've been making mills at shades of mort'ton ever since I needed 80 fm for a master clue.
---
Firemaking has a niche, albeit an obscure one.
---
Same but 2277
---
Not really, there are better ones out there, a quick youtube search will provide plenty of methods
---
Why play the game in the first place if skills are shit? No ones forced to play and grind any skill at all
---
Yeah this, gives it a sustainable use and makes sense. I thought it was a great idea since the production skill needed a gathering skill to fuel it, and hunter hadn't been utilized yet save for dead crafting content
---
It's a small team. You can't expect them to put months and months of coding, design and animation work into something just so the community can say no and have to scrap it all.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it.
---
Cb bracelet and grahzi rapier
---
Juiciest 30k I’ve ever seen
---
That would’ve been great! But sailing failed its poll.
---
Being a skill does not guarantee it will not introduce power creep
---
I really don't like how powercreep has become this death term. It's a required part of any mmo, or the game dies. Compared to rs2 osrs's powercreep is really reel'd.
---
I like niche scape for powercreep reasons.
---
Well I'm all in favour of *just* doing such polls.
---
Honestly I think people are forgetting that with the current attitude we're not only making it impossible to do anything for jagex as company. Worse we're making it so no developer wants to work there: for me as developer the biggest demotivator is when you create something, think about it thoroughly and suddenly it is "well we're not longer doing that".
---
You can only take so many times that before the job becomes "unbearing" and you start quickly looking for a new job. And from experience I know that it's not hard to find better places to work with.
---
So the polling will in the end mean that jagex loses their top devs, and it's not going to be possible to attract good new devs who stick.
---
&gt;this game is mostly about skills
---
Pvm would like a word with you
---
Except you have to be logged in the world when the item is dropped to see it?
---
I’m maxed fam. I dont mind grinding any skill but why add another shit skill and the only point that’s made is “other skills wouldn’t pass a poll”?
---
ikr! its insane, need to work on it though seriously lmfao
---
Username checks out (dudes).
---
How you PvM without using skills? Attack, strength, defence, HP, ranged, prayer?
---
And then people also hate. Osrs quests. But they hate kill and fetch quests too. Everyone Judy hates everything.
---
But new skills devalue my lumbridge-only ironman
---
Your comparison makes no sense to me. Crafting is mundane. Everything in crafting is something I could make in real life. And runes are a very different thing in lore than wizard robes. 
---
Neither of those really fit what warding does, and dumping all the stuff from warding into them would bloat the hell out of crafting.
---
No thanks!  Downvote me ok!
---
Didn't realise skills are the only possible update to RuneScape and the only thing they've ever polled
---
I never played RS3 bro lol Summoning was def in RS2. I stopped playing when they switched to RS3 and only ever came back for the OSRS. I just had to double check but summoning came out in the beginning of 2008. Doesn't matter if you liked the skill or not, I could give a fuck lmao. It was part of the game. So that's probably why you're getting downvoted. Also for intruding on a positive comment thread with nothing positive to say.
---
No I said vote yes you stupid ignorant neckbeard fuck.  Lemme guess you didn't read the 3 development blogs and then you came here to say this, typical maxed osrs player smh
---
any ss of his reaction?
---
Have all streamers experienced the traumatic EoC change? What about OSRS streamers who never suffered the trauma before?
---
Oh we misunderstood eachother, I have no issue with the xp rates/time to 99. My issue is the method essentially being 'making potions' or 'creating battlestaves or d'hide bodies' from 1-99.   
---
I'm not up for that.
---
And now what if quest A requires y xp, gives x. Quest B requires y+a xp, with a less than x? And gives no xp.
---
Sure the minimum can be calculated - it's always possible to do that, but this is not a trivial calculation in all cases. - What about the required combat during quests?
---
Some people just hate doing quests bro

Definitely would be better to poll some of the larger 'fixes' separately. How much of the community would support it if it were worked into runecrafting instead? How about if it didn't add any new BIS equipment in f2p? At the very least, it'd give the devs some insight into what the community as a whole likes or dislikes about warding. A straight up fail, especially if it's close, isn't likely to yield much information on what people want changed, or if the skill is salvageable as a whole, and a close pass won't tell the developers whether it's one massive hangup that got 25% of the community skeptical or a bunch of small ones.

If there's 50 percent of the playerbase who absolutely don't want anything to do with warding, that's a very different situation from 10 percent being fundamentally opposed to it and 40 percent liking everything except the dissolving mechanic.

Why not higher the standard? You can't justify lack of design because 'other skills have it aswell'.

Jagex should at least add something like cannonballs or arrow tips (something usefull in smithing outside of steel platebodies to high alch). You need the crafting skill for so much more than only crafting dhide sets, I know warding would have cool features too at higher levels but still.

After reading it a third time, I realize maybe the flow-charts just killed it for me, just look how boring it represents a 'new' skill.
