I don’t think you even lock in houses anymore do you? Didn’t they just change that? 
---
This occurs when you kill it in its ground state as it resets states when safespotted every 20-30 seconds or so, so sometimes you get a 100% non-transitional kill that usually gives regular bones.

just tested it with normal seaweed as well. you're right. buy buy buy buy lol. EHP will be 1.3m an hour for crafting.

Hey I don't care that much but you shouldn't spoil it for everyone just browsing comments
---
I care
---
&gt;when you have no clue what you're talking about but you make a post anyway
---
XP/hr is good but it's one of the few minutes that feels actually unpleasant to play IMO.

Why do your skill icons look like that?

Just go around saying btw

Are there any plans on reworking/improving the skill cape perks? Almost all of them seem very bad and there is almost no scenario where you would ever want to use them. 
---
LOL? So you are bitching about the fact that you cant destroy items that you PKd? If I cant have them nobody can???
---
You legit picked a gamemode that means no trading or interacting with other players. So why should I care to vote yes when you shouldnt be PKing in the wilderness anyways??
---
Additionally, Ironmen have the PVP advantage because they can keep their HP low via PVP. I aint giving a quality of life to an ironman and wasitng dev resources on such a stupid suggestion. 
---
Just kill them like a man.

At least he got paid. Usually they take the kill and dip

This got weird..
---
The dragon slayer lance is strictly worse than the Zammy hasta against non-dragons
---
Lance= +85 stab, +70 str
---
Z hasta = +85 stab, +75 str, +13 mellee/range defence, +2 prayer
---
Whip= +82 slash + 82 str.
---
But it has a 20% accuracy and damage buff which makes it bis against dragon.
---
You can use z hasta against non-dragons slayer if you fancy a non-whip weapon. Dps is about the same.
---
Blast Furnace is the key
---
No you've got it backwards. You are still too low leveled to do be doing slayer.
---
I proposed an idea a while ago to hold a button on the left side of the screen and when you tap with your other thumb it instantly right clicks. Sort of like a hot key.

He can't wait to get his hands on his unbannable bot.
---
The only people talking about it are the people complaining
---
&gt;"Sit kid" am I right.
---
thats a meme dude. your entire argument is a literal meme. 
---
&gt;When pkers are consistently toxic and release that toxicity by killing you it doesn't really matter to you if it's fair, you just don't like them. So if you wanna start getting pk updates stop acting arrogant like you are in your comment.
---
buddy thats not how it works. you admitted the PVM community is toxic so you wanna fuck us over in the polls and destroy the game cause you lost your spade? does that not sound like what a hypocritical retarded baby does? you have *no right to be mad* because youre dying in a PVP zone so add entitlement issues to that too. you feel entitled to not dying for some reason because you risk nothing. 
---
&gt;Similarly teleblock significantly affects skillers in low wildly. To say they shouldn't have a say in what kills them in the wild is stupid. The same applies to the root buffs. Just cause you think it's a fair buff as the killer does not mean pvmers think it's fair to be killed that way. You act like that's pvmer bias and bitching but it goes both ways. Pvpers want buffs to help them kill, pvmers want nerfs to help them live.
---
problem is there are more PVMers and skillers than PKers. so the burning need to survive the wild while taking advantage of its content (while also being blissfully unaware of the warning message you get when you enter, which is that youre going to lose your spade if youre not careful) is more than the desire to have actual balanced spellbooks. 
---
&gt;You'll never win polls perpetuating that attitude.
---
i dont really have a word for how fucking retarded this is lol. you just admitted to being extremely toxic and manipulating polls because youre mad the rules of the wild apply to you. we will never win polls anyway, unless people voting on PVP (read: PVP, like players fighting other players, not wild PVM or skilling) are vetted for wildy PVP activity. 
---
you guys CONSTANTLY cry about morons and noob accounts voting in PVP polls when your favorite polls dont pass. you CONSTANTLY cry about hiding poll results. and now here you are again crying about losing your spade, and seriously threatening to destroy this community over it. 
---
of course were better than you lol.

he didnt actually get 40 rc, i’m pretty sure he has no physical way to gain runecrafting xp at all (outside lamping). i thought that was obvious, but then i realized that he’s done stuff that seemed impossible so now I realize that it could be taken the wrong way. sorry
---
This was never polled but can we please move the keyboard right side up when using mobile so typing is easier?
---
And can we move the more commonly used tabs to the right side of the screen? Or just move all of them to the right?
---
Could you make Hops patches more easily accessible and add one to the farming guild?
---
but.. if it can be efficiently killed with range and safespotted my lazy senses tingle
---
No
---
i really have to wonder if the people who compare rs3 to WoW have ever actually played WoW
---
Bots. Have you ever been to a f2p world? Especially barb village. It's crazy that they dont get banned straight away.
---
So balanced...
---
Would you agree that season 3 really has been a big step up from 1 and 2? Not all the way to the full top gear experience but is constantly getting closer. Fake 47's were a real let down though.
---
Holy.. how can I commission one?
---
you mean swampleticrabs? i'd wager no one even knew of the -55 ranged, but now it's a straight meme because of swampletics
---
Oh yeah it's the ghost flick or whatever right.  Makes sense why they died then lol
---
i think konar give the most points as well.
---
hellhounds and blue dragons both have available safe spots so they should be easy. I'm 89 combat and I've been using Nieve and have yet to be given a task I couldn't do, you can look up guides on good ways to do the tasks on youtube.
---
He saved up tomes for the ultimate dopamine rush
---
Do konar Slayer master at your level. If you have to look up YouTube guides on your task on where and how to kill a monster.
---
Sometimes things like pyrfiends look like they hit melee but hit magic.
---
A lot of people use cannon to speed up tasks but you lose like 200k per task. 
---
Start ranging tasks you find too hard for your level like black demons, or blue dragons. If you have to cancel the task. You'll be doing it the slow way but you kinda have to just put in the time with how low your level is. You'll get better Slayer Masters and tasks as you go on. 
---
If you don't want to slowly safespot with rcbow and broads you can learn to pray flick, or get used to spending like 80k a task on prayer pots. Most tasks you should just be able to use monk fish and telly back quickly with Slayer ring in the future.

Well, yeah, awful people exist, but that's no reason to join in on the mob mentality and shrug your shoulders like nothing can possibly be done about shitty people. I really hope you find some people who eventually don't make you feel like this, because this is a terribly cynical and sad outlook.

Yes there is no longer the need to lock in. It will not reduce if you decide to work on another house.

Probably should of gotten higher fishing, farming, and mining before you did this.

I’d start with getting a fire cape and barrows gloves.
---
Use obsidian legs and a fighter torso or obsidian body instead of barrows and upgrade to a torture army over fury, and start saving for Bandos and primordials.
---
the comment that guy zayden made was supposed to be a joke, but i guess his reaction was bad so he was disliked
---
This is awesome, I wanted to make something similar which includes various additional milestones and completionist achievements. I'll probably be forking this. Good work man!
---
I didn't make it past the first season. Like everyone else, I felt they got lazy with their scripting. Having things be scripted isn't at all a bad thing. Aimless meandering episodes are just as bad. But it seems like they didn't put any effort at all into making things seem even slightly natural or authentic. Then of course their was their extreme reliance on low hanging fruit when it came to humour. Like the episode where they go on an actual grand tour. Jeremy and James are in luxury European sports cars and Richard is in a Dodge Demon or whatever. They just repeated the same "Richard is being loud and obnoxious in a loud and obnoxious American car" joke every 30 seconds for the entire fucking episode. The whole season in general was reliant on the whole "Americans are uncultured" joke. I actually like that type of humor because I know it's just some good natured ribbing. But rote repetition of the same joke ad nauseum is just plain fucking annoying. I could still forgive it if it were just the one episode, but no, they had to have The American as their track driver every damn episode.
---
"Lol! He doesn't like anything foreign! COMMUNISM!!!!!! HAHAHAHA ISN'T THAT HYSTERICAL!!!!!!"

Please fuck off with that tired ass bullshit. Thank God they got rid of him. I'm not even going to talk about Brain Crash. Everything that needs to be said about that dumpster fire has already been said. Of course, these issues didn't actually start with TGT. The pattern of laziness had already started to emerge in their final Top Gear seasons. I wish they would just retire from this shit and move on to other things. Nowadays they just come off as old men desperately clinging to past success, or creatively bankrupt celebrities collecting a paycheck.

Can't really share your entire collection log at a glance with a screenshot.

Farming contracts give you a ton of seeds, some of which sell pretty well. You can eventually farm/kill this plant boss called Hespori (i think) which has a 1/10 chance of dropping a bottomless compost bucket, which sells decently well right now. You can plant special crops that increase the yield of all your other crops, increasing profit from herb runs.
---
My farming was level 1 a couple days ago and I'm almost 50 now, so I'm sure you could do it if you try.
---
My recommendation is to farm the highest level allotments and herbs you can, and trees give pretty big chunks of experience, so don't ignore them either (they're expensive and not profitable though, so I'd stick to willows if you're on a budget). Do a farm run in between quests, and aim for quests that unlock new transportation methods, give you good chunks of experience in skills you need, or unlock passive profits (battlestaves from varrock diary require a couple quests for different diary levels, hand in the sand gives you free sand buckets, gertrude's cat lets you raise cats which you can trade for 200 death runes). I'm almost at 100 quest points from doing just this: quest, farm run, quest, farm run...

Only useful if you want the task to be longer, I’d just stay with the extra offensive bonuses

So I have a friend and he's botted every single one of his pure's combat stats and hasn't been caught on any of them. He also says that 90% of the pures he knows have botted their stats as well. Simply put if any one of their accounts is ever event caught they just make and bot a new one.
---
Also first time offenses are lax, I have another friend who botted full graceful on a new account and got a 1 week ban with no other repercussions. In his words "1 week of membership is a good price to pay for full graceful."
---
There are bots with &gt;100m xp that get loaded up with reports yet are never toasted while sometimes noobs get hit with the banhammer.

I'll restart
---
&gt;Only useful if you want the task to be longer
---
Or shorted. Using bracelets to extend good tasks and shorten bad tasks is something like 15% better xp compared to dps gloves. You personally might prefer the offensive bonus but that doesn't change the fact that slayer bracelets will increase his xp/hour more than any of the gear you suggested. 
---
Sounds like he just has the item in his inv when he lost it or he got hacked when he logged off or he’s lying?

iron and fly fishing are pretty effective.
---
I got 99 magic back in the days of rs2 using elite switch which basically was a primitive click here Gary’s hood third party program. 
---
The thing is legitimately alched my way up to 81 magic or something, which is about 30k alchs, but I develop RSI - yeah repetitive strain injury from all the clicking. I would mostly watch tv at the same time anyway and take the ball out the mouse. 
---
I got to the point I was like why the fuck am I grinding a game that Im not even playing. I ended up just playing the game (fun stuff like castle wars) of an evening, then leaving the auto clicker on to do 5k alchs over night, wake up pc off go to school come back do the same again the next evening.

I second the motion
---
A lot of casinos have the option to do that, and that's what I have done with a lot of them. I really wish it was as simple as just not go, but the addiction is too strong and I can't handle it without external help. Again, this is just me and I understand the update would be unnecessary for a lot of players.

Robert the strong was by far the most annoying and difficult and i knew this well ahead of time. The hard part about getting 85Cmb is balancing your melee stats with your range stats. Seeing how you'll be killing Queest version Vorkath and Galvak with range, you'll also need melee stats for Robert.
---
I decided to get 65 Strength since I knew that i'd wouldn't be gaining another max hit unless i went for 68 strength and was potted. 70 Defense was because i knew i would need absolute max tanky-ness if i were to have any hope in tanking Galvek, Vorkath and Robert. And will 300+ Range defense, robert the strong still ran a train on me. Took me 8 Attempts, and the successful kill was super lucky with my hits (Started the fight with 3 30+ Dmace specs where i'd normally hit 0s). I ended up using a dragon mace since i'd want the defense from crystal shield if the barrelchest anchor were to be used.
---
In the end i got impatient and went from 60-65 attack, 65-66 strength instead of getting 86 range like i had originally intended, and i think the extra attack levels paid off.
---
Because jagex is retarded with agil shortcuts.

Only for range. Ferocious is new melee bis(needs ds2) and torment for mage. But your account needs work. Just do the quests dude imo they are the most important part of account progression, showing you have gear doesnt prove anything except that you probably bought bonds

If the Tome of Fire is added to the game, should it protect you from dragonfire whilst you have it equipped?

I had 1 shotted both Vorkath and Galvak. Vorkath was actually a joke seeing as i have his mechanics memorized since i got a few hundred kc on my main, Galvak on the otherhand... I have honest to god, never see so many fucking lucky bolt spec's ever. I had gotten 2 ruby bolt spec's B2B in phase 1, then got 3 more ruby spec's in phase two. All in all i think i landed about 7 ruby specs and 5-6 diamond bolt specs. And with all of that, i had to redemption twice with no food and on my last douse of super restore, tick eating perfectly and no overheal eating. My jaw was on the fool on those specs... Wish i recorded it.

They've said no, logic was that everyone would start very low and end up adding one coin at a time and it would affect prices or something

I just labbed out some stuff to do with prayer flicking yesterday. There are a lot of guides on YouTube about how to do it (Zulu's one is probably the best), but nobody seemed to go in to the actual mechanics of it. I'm not sure if that'll help you, but I found it quite interesting, and I've already done the research so might as well share it.
---
Basically, the idea behind prayer flicking is to turn **on** your prayer at the **end** of a tick, then turn it **off** at the **start** of the next tick. That way your prayer is only ever on in the period when the game is transitioning from one tick to the next. Here's an example:
---
500ms click (on)
---
700ms click (off)
---
1100ms click (on)
---
1300ms click (off)
---
There are game ticks at 0ms, 600ms, 1200ms etc. 
---
If you are struggling with prayer flicking, try and widen the gap between the on/off clicks. The only thing that's important is that the on/off pair occur on different ticks. 
---
If you're finding that your prayers never go up, it means both on/off clicks are **on the same tick**. You need to shift your timing. If you are finding that your prayer is going down, that means **your prayers are active for more than 1 tick**. You need to do the whole process faster. I use game sounds, and Runelite has a built in metronome / prayer flick helper. You can also use animations (Zulu's guide explains this well) to help time it.

I promise you that "meta" in the context of game strategy is shorthand for "metagame." "Meta," the prefix, indicates that something exists on a higher abstract level. So the "metagame" is the game outside the game. Meta is not an initialism, and if you've seen it used as such, that's what's called a "backronym" where an existing word is turned into an acronym, usually to help remember it. Your backronym is useful because it roughly explains the concept of a metagame in practical terms.

Or add me KiDreggiNgiB and I’ll go sort shit out

That’s -10 minutes of slayer fml

the prior because the latter wouldn't fucking asking lmao
---
So PKers should be able to kill ironmen without risk? Defeats the purpose of the wilderness.
---
"No interacting with other players" you say.  By that logic, I shouldn't be able to be attacked by other players period.  See how silly that sounds? There is content in the wilderness beneficial to ironmen accounts, so they will go there.  They should have reason to fight back when attacked.
---
I anticipate someone like you will attempt to say "stay out of the wilderness if you don't want to get attacked" to which I will counter that if there wasn't content there that was beneficial to progressing my account, then I wouldn't go there, ever.
---
If you attempt to pk someone, and they kill you instead, you should be punished. It's that simple.  It's not that I expect ironmen to run around pking people and just destroying items for fun (because as you put it, these ironmen who have pking built accounts should just have an alt ready to loot; this update in no way changes that.)
---
Regardless, you are in the minority, 71% of the voting community thought it was a good idea.

im actually all for this. fashionscape is a huge part of the game for me. i WANT to achieve things for the cuter items and clothing. and i want morty med legs!! im sad i cant have them back! i knew  shouldnt have completed my diary :\[\[\[ anyways, fashionscape is a big deal. 
---
I consider both and I prefer non-combat skilling but will do combat if that makes more money
---
Callisto was supposed to be weak to mage initially, but a safespot was found to take no damage.
---
Vetion was supposed to be weak to melee, and Venenatis to range.
---
Someone has completed inferno on mobile... So yes, it's all possible. Going to be a bit harder than it is on desktop tho.
---
Lol&lt;3 got another
---
Wait really? All those times I ruined my withdraw x value by withdrawing 100k
---
Luckily I think it always looks for the best offer so I don't think it's too likely you'd sell it for that much. 
---
People who don't bot don't get banned for botting.
---
These people use 3rd party autotypers otherwise you would need to have autochat enabled to see what they are typing which no one does when doing prayer in w330.
---
The recovery system is automated despite what anyone tells you. That extra details box at the bottom is useless. I struggle to recover old accounts too. I don't 100% remember passwords I used, I didn't answer recovery questions with actual answers, members details are long gone. Pretty frustrating. 
---
All you have to do is be assigned a task right? 
---
Anyone know if they’re still doing 7 says free membership with mobile? Like maybe for new players or something?
---
lol’d
---
63 slayer and my highest other stats are 75 wc 82 fleching and 62 fishing 
---
Found this post at -1 cause it's not trashing OP for not knowing the optimal play. Stay classy guys.
---
Alright thanks ill look into doing that
---
Don’t we always? 
---
You can only see autochat if your public is set to show autochat. Those people are using 3rd party programs.
---
well there goes the luck for the rest of my account then :( 
---
Nice to see this community actually helping me out. 
---
I still don't see that as crashing. There are still plenty of others to attack. Crashing would be stealing nearly all the kills without much possibility of the other person doing much. This is fair game
---
Thanks, appreciate the info
---
Iirc it chooses the most recent one that fits your price 
---
Got mine doing bandos kc :^)
---
Most likely. Probably just start a new acc tbh. 
---
And how would you know there are no false bans? Not a single one out of the entire lifetime of this game? And somehow Jagex writes perfect code for their bot detection system even though their game can have bugs? 
---
Of course you believe that false bans can't happen if you think everyone who complains about it is lying. 
---
That's my point. It is not a question of originality, but of popularity. Marvel did not invent cinematic universes. Universal's monster movies were doing the same thing nearly a century ago, but who do you think all these studios trying to create their own CUs are imitating? Here's a hint, it's the one that's been raking in billions of dollars for the last ten years.
---
Thanks everyone who came, hopefully you got some good loot!
---
Took 21 days using the Seers Village Hard Diary for 74 -90, but no Ardougne Elite for 90 - 99. Pretty much no-lifed the grind. Was a week shorter than 77 - 99 RC, way less money, and way more AFK. Easy as FUCK on mobile once you learn the hitboxes. Clicking on the screen became a reflex. Most days were over 500k agility xp days, but twice or so/more each of the three weeks I’d have 700-900k xp agility days. 
---
I did it because I saw some dude two or three months ago emoting with the cape and it looked badass. Decided to 99 RC and agility back to back, here we are.
---
Next stop might be 64-99 farming through tithe farm, or chasing 99 slayer straight out since the cape is insane
---
&gt;Ehhh for gambling it does. As someone who used to have a gambling addiction I kinda know. I absolutely love going to casinos but it was hurting me financially so I chose to stop. It’s not like a drug addiction 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
---
Not all people are the same amount of addicted though, like for anything.
---
they've done it for people on path of exile and warframe. and I believe there was one case of ash doing it for Someone on osrs, I'll see if I can find the posts when I get home from work 
---
Haven't gotten to Dust Devils or Nechs yet, that might explain it.
---
It was pretty balanced imo.
---
Crafting w sandstone and giant seaweed makes crafting a braindead skill now when before it was actually tedious but important (like an easier herblore).
---
And they say art is dead.
---
Settled pls let me be your Morytania gf
---
Nice.
---
Someone in my clan crashed them for the luls. Just wait, they'll settle at their proper value eventually.
---
They do drop 10 noted big bones. You definitely just picked up the loot and left the clue on the ground. Now that I think about it, there's a chance that tile was full of dropped fish and you couldn't pick up the clue. Whatever it was, it wasn't the game, it was you 
---
It's definitely not
---
Hey, you could be that guy who got hacked and after like a year discovered the hacker had moved his gloves of silence where his void gloves had been, and he had been using them with void the entire time.
---
me too btw
---
Id agree if it was one world but its not. First come first serve thats been the rule on this game forever. Why crash a spot when you can hop? Cant find a spot right asay? Neither could they. Keep looking. Like i said 9/10 you can find an open world. Making it a dick move
---
Theyve been considering a pipe nerf for at least 2 years

Gg no rm fgt &lt;3

That ones def been suggested afair and is engine work ofc

So no humor?

Can we pay 100 of each ore to unlock all colours for our golem pet (mining pet).

I do now

Ahh that's hot!

I prefer "alch yourself" but that works too

Group slayer?

You're wasting your time.  They don't give a shit if you need with a couple of bots and get them banned
---
Damn good progress man but you could be way further if you were p2p. Any particular reason you stay f2p?
---
Three charges on your glory, GG account kid
---
Lmaooo I’ve been there with people not answering the damn question you asked. Quests are pretty much the best way to explore in my opinion, they’ll send you all over the map and give you unique objectives and whatnot.
---
ok
---
Are you asking why the reduction in time to make or update a trade affects markets?
---
See real world for example and information related to that.
---
Morytania
---
I attack it the second it spawns...
---
The bar is actually set that low, though.
---
Similar to this is the lowball scam. For example: Some guy is buying BGS for 11,8M. It seems reasonable but the GE price is 12M, so selling it for that low is the equivalent of just giving the guy 200k for nothing.
---
Rule of thumb: Don't sell or buy anything from players that you can buy from the GE, except if you hit the buy limits.
---
How do you get yellow graceful?
---
Missing many colours not impressed
---
yeah but if you recolor it’s kept on pvm deaths so it’s worth 
---
I'm pretty sure if you're next to the kebbit you have a significantly higher chance of catching it. At least that is how I remember it from when I did it on my iron. Could still fail a few times in a row, but its a significant boost.
---
doubt
---
Lmao I didn't even notice your name until now. Nice.
---
I guess if you juggle during the kill. Either way, one hop for a world isn't worth the 30k
---
show that goblin what the bone spear is all about
---
Why accuse me of reposting when u could accuse me of not being original instead (I just need some quick karma for a ride home)
---
Not far enough, if he goes and Smiths cannon balls, he can click 3 times and wait a minute and 43 seconds. Plenty of time for a push from the wife and a possible catch from the doctor. He holds a leg with one hand and then clicks 3 times with the other.
---
We still exist. How else am I supposed to kill scrubs that bring their cash stacks into the wildy? 
---
Sorry, I don’t agree. I’ve been around since you had to string every bow individually, and “cook all” wasn’t a thing. Saving 3 clicks isn’t quality of life. 
---
Do you mean Donut Licker?
---
This actually the true power level of autism.
---
I thought I had mentioned entertaining but apparently I missed that. Yes he’s funny too. Lol
---
I’m gonna give you 10k to fuck off. 
---
Smithing and runecrafting bots out the ass at edgeville all day everyday. Only skill over lvl 50 is 96 RC. Yeah. Ok. Maybe a few weirdos. Dozens of them? Nah. Bots. 100%
---
Bi-ron woman btw.
---
What you mean m8 you're coming on my thread talking shit you ain't shit so you're fired now get out 
---
Someone who licks donuts and then puts them back on their display.

seems a bit silly to be sorry about champ, drop rate is like 1/32 or some shit. Gotten 2 on both of my accs in less than 15 kc on each.

The problem with bots isn't that they legal. The problem is jagexs bot team is to small
---
Your thread sucks ass
---
Yeah, I see your point with having an alcher now.
---
And yeah, there probably were some scams with it originally, but I really doubt it would cause that big of an increase in scams. People who already scam would just start using a new method, and people who get scammed would just be scammed with something else. If it's a money pouch scam "regarding pvp", I assume that would mean something along the lines of getting a player to enter the wilderness... In which case, the player would likely be able to be lured/scammed anyways.
---
I dunno, I just think that the convenience of having it would outweigh whatever negatives there are.
---
It does when you do the have a anti fire shield
---
It's Pikachu!!..... FUCK! 
---
Tbh I like his videos but the community agreeing on shit is what I'm getting tired of. Everyone's happy as fuck about the new A friend and nobody's miserable, arguing about politics, spamming, doxing, etc. I want another gay pride event where the entire subreddit devolves into a shithole of memes and hate speech. I want neckbeards doxing other neckbeards, I want more jmod corruption. This positive Andy shit needs to stop 
---
This is a gamechanger. For fashionscape as well. Imagine the possibilities. 
---
I just hate quests. 
---
What does it sound like to say lmao out loud? Was he actually laughing, or spelled out lmao?
---
what if they're not cut down?
---
Hey man this is seriously awesome. Such an upgrade from using ironmanosrs, love how smooth the animations are and the grouping of the items.
---
Do you have plans to add in more things in the future? E.g. more clue scroll support.
---
Also, how is working with Vue?
---
Client says 96 prayer but stats say 99 prayer. Which ones faked?
---
That's a good idea but some people play with their thumbs only. 
---
Ya never know it doesn't matter about the bot team dude it needs to have a stipulation there is no person that can get rid of bots but the law god damnit 
---
My original statement was correct according to official wiki.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/King_Black_Dragon/Strategies#Ranged%20
---
It didn't use to have it, but it was polled and put in eventually.

Castle wara

HEYYYYYO GOTEM haha nice
---
You’re correct
---
Put that on your resume! I’d hire your ass
---
Now **this** is *QOL*
---
GE gives you the best current offer.
---
If you sell for 1gp and the current buy prices are 2m, 2.1m, 2.2m, and 17k gp you will get 2.2m.
---
The danger of putting an item in for 1gp springs up with low volume items because there just might be nobody buying at the time and you'll end up selling for 1gp to the first offer put in, or the only offers are people with super lowballs sitting in the ge for months like 17k for a bludgeon.
---
luh mao. 
---
It was tragic 
---
Do you hate barrows gloves?
---
It's good to feel closer to God.
---
56 + 20 = 76, so 24% didn't care.
---
56 * 100 / 76 = 74%. That's close to passing. 
---
Iron man btw
---
Theres a setting that makes it so your pets can only be clicked/selected after first right clicking them

I saw the template for “tin” in another sub and thought it would be perfect for here with the right wording.

Would be better if guy said "off" in this meme

also well said

Theres 3 crabs near where u mine volcanic ash. Rarely anyone there ever.

So if you didn't have a tele or the agility level and no one killed you would your account just be soft locked?

Ah shit you’re right, fuck buying back your stuff at vorkath, you should just lose it.
---
Flair checks out
---
i’ve honestly never considered that this would be an issue. are you colourblind? i’m just curious, i barely notice them
---
it will, however, pull out 100k from your death items, if you had brought alchs and were there for awhile\\\*
---
\^\*2+ kills
---
one of my most fond memories of RS was with Nex. She just came out and 2 of my buddies let me leech a trip (I was like 95 cb and had no gear) just to see if I brought any luck. Long story short, we ended up getting crashed but getting the loot; it was a Virtus Wand in my name... 100M split at the time. 
---
That’s a death, most situations you can get it back for free in less you in wildy 20+
---
Impressive^not^really^thay^impressive^
---
Honestly who cares? The way botting is right now isn’t really that bad and it puts money into jagex pocket and keeps the game running. They really don’t crash the economy that badly. Any item that is valuable generally isn’t botted aside from zulrah barrows and revenants 
---
The pipe is at barbarian agility arena, the monkey bars that are comparable to varrock course is in edge dungeon. In the wildy
---
It don't put money in their pockets they use bonds  and anything that's valuable is botted there is no limit what are u a botter u fuckin jackass you're fired god damnit now get out 
---
Like 3m an hour, very easy to sustain a bond if bossing
---
Fukin ignorant bum are ya
---
HAHAHAH ANOTHER SWAMPLETICS JOKE I HOPE U GET LOADS OF KARMA HAHAHAH
---
Hi ExtravagantTim, send me a private message and we can discuss :)
---
Thank you! :)
---
This is amazing great work man
---
Thanks man, apprhysiate it :)
---
Imagine getting 800m off 99 rc instead of 300 come on m8 you're high or something 
---
Oh no, he will be the first to hit 47 47 
---
You do realize that bonds are only put into the game when someone purchases them from jagex for real life money right? 
---
I'd give him the d first, then hide.
---
Unrelated but I met a guy at the GE begging for 1M to stake. He kept saying how he can’t stop and lost all his shit and I said he had a gambling addiction. He said no I don’t I just need 1 M please so I can stake and make my money please I can’t stop staking I keep trying to quit but I can’t stop I’ve spent thousands on bonds so I can stake I can’t stop. 
---
People get legit addicted to staking in RS it’s sad :/
---
what the fuck
---
I used found that shortcut invaluable when I did hops runs. Yanillian hops skyrocketed due to mahogany trees so I was constantly farming them. Having the shortcut was so nice because Port Sarim is somewhat tricky to get to quickly without the proper upgrades. 
---
Yeah, the explorers ring teleports you right above Port Sarim, but my destination is Entrana so I would bank my contraband in Draynor and then use the shortcut. 
---
You’ve gotta be about 9 1/2 years old
---
That'll be a no from you then I guess. This sub is an echo chamber filled with retarded parrots.
---
Jagex may as well just go ahead and block all Venezuelan ISPs 
---
56% yes isn’t close to passing, look at the rest of this thread / anything they repolled, everything else was above 71%. Sorry you’re retarded and care so much about a NPC.
---
Dopamine [x]
---
Go to vegas and stake someone
---
Ah okay. I thought that is probably the case then. 
---
I personally couldn’t care less about rc because I don’t enjoy it. I could earn 800m in ways much quicker than 99 rc
---
Ill give it a gamble
---
Stay away from the sand casino unless you're willing to lose whatever you stake. 
---
Be careful what you wish for. Introduce more skillers/pvmers to pvp environments and you'll have even more players voting no on necessary pk updates simply because they'd also affect them.
---
It’s a online game bro, move on 
---
yeah you can add them to your ignore list
---
Yes, yes it is
---
Report him and put on ignore list. He will most likely be muted for a while. 
---
this is just flat out wrong
---
Report him. I've been banned for lesser things.
---
Care to explain how this webpage would phish you?
---
not op but thanks for the grammar lesson 
---
Thanks to the few who actually answered and didn't downvote my question. I asked because I suspected that the majority of people here just hear shit and repeat it without even thinking. I love reddit but it's circle jerk for dumbasses
---
3k rune knives in the wild nice
---
I've had two drops around that rate. First was smouldering stone from hell hounds, second was agility pet at level 68 in seers
---
Don't think I'm colorblind they just got super distracting and made my eyes hurt, it ended up being fine...I guess eventually you get used to anything. 
---
Skip Wyrms? Why?!
---
I’m in it for the dopamine bro, I can wait 
---
Ill try to get their on mobile!
---
It also gives you 2 guaranteed ultra rare chests on rs3 which could give you bank to swap over  
---
Because max NH’ing is full of zeros and small hits. NHing on pures/zerks is fun because the hits are much higher, which lead to a much faster paced fight, involving a lot more skill imo. 
---
Tbh your stats arent really high enough to do any sort of bossing though. Barrows is really the only viable one for you since your magic is higher level. But your range/melee are to low to do any bosses really, and most bosses are gonna be ranged or melee'd. I would continue working on slayer honestly. Train your non combats up. Work toward barrows gloves - it will be the best grind to get out of the way and it feels so good to get it out the way early on rather than later. B gloves are helpful and BiS for basically everything until you reach late late game and even then they're probably gonna be BiS for most things. 
---
Would've been a 180iq dad joke if you used lunar armor.
---
I think the hidden word is fuck but I can't tell
---
Hosa. Hes in the center

What are your stats/gear you are using for zulrah?
---
OP: "Hey I have a suggestion, could X be buffed?"
---
You: "sO dOn'T uSe X tHeN"
---
???
---
Can we make the entire COX floor a safespot to prevent people from losing their bank.
---
There is an option where you can't left click your pet.
---
He doesn’t even know if you have children dummy. No nothing can be done about it, cause he’s a random dude on a game. Who cares what he says.
---
Probably a 12 year old trying to make himself giggle. Just ignore and move on. Report if you wish 
---
I knew a guy in-game who went to prison for threatening to blow up a school or something, report it to Jagex if you genuinely feel threatened. If he's just flaming you, report him for seriously offensive language and move on. 
---
Could say hes edging towards max ;)
---
Hitpoints is your first 99? Damn well most of the rest are gonna be easier
---
Bro like 85% of the playerbase is disabled
---
He's wearing bad gear and probably about to die
---
Hey, my RuneScape text looked almost unreadable on one of my desktop screens. Nothing seemed to help, even fiddling with ClearText and windows font sizes.
---
Did some digging and turns out some monitors have odd adjustments like sharpness. Turning it down made the text in RuneScape amazingly better for me and I don't have headaches anymore.
---
Figured I may as well write this here in the hope that it help someone else.
---
meanwhile i'm over here still fumbling normal jad once the healers spawn. 
---
D chain from dustys many years ago training def in the original smoke dung 
---
What is your interest in a "trophy hall" in the POH? It could be used to mount all of the monster heads, along with more updated armor displays, such as Bandos.
---
Currently there is no way to mount the monster heads without mqking an entirely new room for one mount, which isn't very efficient.
---
Unfortunately this was asked on a Q&amp;A session within the last few months i think and Mod Ash gave a reason why they couldn't/wouldn't do it but I can't remember why
---
Why no void
---
It took me like a solid year to get steel armor lol 
---
I have no fucking clue what the hell I did for a year lmao
---
He legit has us by the dick and balls...
---
Clicky click
---
Don’t have elite yet wasn’t sure if normal void would be better or arma with serp
---
Yes
---
This is one of those things that all my friends in real life agree should be added, I agree should be added, so many people on line think should be added, and something My guys and I literally get pissed about not being added to this point in Old School’s life cycle, but it won’t be for actually no reason. 
---
Look bh worlds - its like 200-500k/hr pick up everything you can. 
---
I don't have any issues with it but I have an 8700k so idk. 
---
Osrs.wiki
---
I’m not saying RWT doesn’t harm the game. My thought process is  simple really tho. If people didn’t support these bots, there wouldn’t be begging bots. All people have to do is stop giving to beggars. It’s kinda like the dice rollers at the GE, if people didn’t gamble with them, they wouldn’t be there. 
---
what time of day does he make the vids public
---
From what I understood, it's not about the price but about the inventory space. Your health decreases by a fixed % but increases by a fixed flat amount. That means the less health pool you have, the less food you need despite taking the same % damage.
---
Ie: if you have 11 hp, a full inventory can heal you to full 28 times; if you have 99 hp the same inventory will heal you to full only thrice.
---
when did this update get put into effect?
---
Wonderful
---
The dragon is attacking him not the player 
---
They removed the falcon missing?
---
oooo
---
750k/hr? what the hell kind of moneymaking content are you doing?
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
How tf do y’all find all these friends lmao
---
Gz dude, I'm on the grind to 99 myself at the moment. You planning on getting the blue graceful recolor from the brimhaven agility dungeon? It looks super slick with the skill cape.
---
that's how RNG drops work.
---
It sounds like a French person laughing.
---
What a fucking loser
---
It also technically exists with Hosidius house favour with the compost right? 
---
Begging also gives fresh level 3's the ability to make 500k - 1M per hour with zero effort needed, which is more gold than many maxed skills can make per hour. Is that also not damaging to the game? 
---
This would actually increase security.  You have to enter a pin to get to the exchange, so they don't have increased access to gold.  On the other hand I wouldn't have my cash stack in my inventory constantly when merching, it would be in my bank.  If I got hacked the cash would be in the bank behind a pin.
---
Gotta make it exclusive. How about 20 konar keys per piece
---
I was expecting a better reaction, but still very worth it as long as someone from Jagex eventually sees 
---
But I thought repeating the same referendum that the people voted on again was bad?
---
Issa joke plz no pk
---
Carrying around the GE makes people play the actual game more?
---
Just as an FYI, RuneLite has a stretched mode which basically acts as interface scaling. It's the best you'll get until Jagex adds interface scaling. 
---
Considering HA value is 48k, that's waayyy less than the value of 90 marks of grace
---
I agree but this just makes me think swampletics and now my dick is hard...so there’s that

Hate emojis

Your sister has very pretty nails!
---
If a certificate was basically a string of randomized characters like a hash how possible is it to be able to pick one out and connect to the server 
---
You would literally need to intercept network traffic from jagex servers and decrypt it just to log into runescape and the next time the certificate string changes you would have to do it over and over again 
---
Who would do that 
---
Developing bank slot templates which will provide a variety of premade organizational choices for the current gear and resources within player’s banks.
---
Could you make rejoining a commonly used clan chat clickable instead of having to type? Seems like a great quality of life idea to me. 
---
Doing Slayer through Konar could probably get you a few drops to open up better options 
---
That's why I'm thinking that it's more on the server side but obviously the client would be involved as well 
---
It's like the only way it's possible to me at the moment is if you could have it so in order to log in to the server you would have to have an updated certificate on the client physically ?
---
Has never happened before, but now it has happened again in that same spot.

Im around 2k kc and went with a friend to show him how to kill KBD. We did four kills and he got the pet. “Is that good?” 
---
I could have killed him.
---
Seriously... As people, what the fuck are we doing?
---
These people are never banned anyway
---
I like the idea but in the current state of the game, forcing players to log out is a good thing. This would keep world population really high, artificially and make it a challenge to determine what world configuration/changes are best.
---
White lilies don’t protect herb patches they only protect allotments.  
---
Also protection doesn’t affect minimum yield. Minimum yield is 3 + level of compost (regular = 1, super = 2, ultra = 3), so there is still benefit to using higher quality compost on plants that have 0% chance of dying.
---
Lol yeah. 
---
wut?

its my turn to repost this maymay next time guys

Gratz brother! wish i could be there but i got work @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

How long has the game been stale for, you're only like 40 hours in. My friend, it's time to find a new one, perhaps Neopets?
---
Dragon slayer. Unless you're using chain for fashionscape
---
Without a doubt difficult. But isn't it more than 60, with hydra, zulrah, vork, garvik, looting bag? (Idk if I'm missing more). The point of my comment was that the guy wasn't completely wrong, ultim has changed a lot since it's original concept. But it's a pretty dead game mode anyway so I really couldn't care less, I'm just making an observation.
---
Yeah. Pls rename monkey madness 2 to monkey mania
---
Just get a youtube channel
---
Happy....
---
And it continues
---
Zulrah. If you can kill it once you'll get good enough to kill it several times per trip. There is also a lot of motivation to grind it since there are several possible upgrades to your setup as opposed to something like vorkath where it's dhcb and you're now in bis.
---
How funny. I meant the amount of content I could do on mobile aka barrows etc was getting stale! But i see reddit triggers you easily, perhaps try Facebook?

I’m 843kc and I’ve only used the normal void + blowpipe method. Works pretty darn good! My kill times are usually under 2 min

OSRS might be a little older, like 20 ish avg age. I've been playing RS since I was 9 and I'm only 18 so Anywhere from 12-25 I would say.
---
Thanks for this, hate the game, but enjoyed their memes
---
It's 2 weeks, I think
---
Lumbridge and Draynor medium diary takes no effort or time to complete, so a moderately helpful shortcut like this is quite fitting actually.
---
I'd say with a fair bit of confidence that there are far more people in OSRS's history who have autoclicked their way to 94 or 99 magic compared to people who have used burst/barrage with slayer to do the same. Even if that isn't true, I am certain there are more people who have manually alched 94/99 magic than people who have used slayer to do the same.

Because dragon slayer is all about unlocking brutal blue dragon task from Konar, I mean it's not like Konar came out last month whereas Dragon Slayer has been in the game since the beginning. 
---
Yes people can hide behind it if it's pushed to an unreasonable level, especially on new content. 170 Brutal Blue Drags is extremely unfair on a mid level account, this is clearly  an oversight because it is ridiculous to expect a mid level account to spend days grinding this task. Heck I'm nearly max and even I wouldn't wanna do this.
---
Other dragons are assigned on a fair scale, 12 Steel drags for example or 5-10 Wyverns, 20 black dragons so on and so forth. Yes, the skip option exists but that option is not justification to have a broken task lile this in the game.
---
Stop trying to act like some hardcore elite player you're not impressing anyone.

After all the data breaches in the past few years you really have to diversify what your accounts are linked to, across any platform. The only things of mine that havent had attempted(one or two successful) breaches are weird accounts with my more obscure names or emails, like my RS account is so old it logs in from a username not an email and its nothing commom i use because it was a name made when i was 12, never had a breach there. In contrast my WoW account has been breached twice, after they made you switch to email for the account sign in, of course i was foolish and that account had one of my more often used passwords so it was inevitable.
---
There is always the possibility of trojans, user error, or any number of things but consideration needs to be given to the fact there are zips and pdfs out there with tons of peoples names and their common user information for online accounts, any scammer just needs to pick a name and start trying common apps with that persons info and eventually they hit paydirt. Ideally they look for accounts with cards bound to them that they can then charge the shit out of for something they can then turn into cash by selling. 
---
This is excellent parody btw
---
I'm a Gyazo kind of man myself but I like where you're going with this 
---
+1 to this, no point in locking it away from people who are level 3 skillers. 
---
I bet my mouse hand there would be a bug where you could get a max cash stack
---
I disagree, at least in my case. I started playing WoW and RS at the same time. It was PKing that kept me playing RS. There are no games I can think of where you kill someone and get their loot and it means as much as it does in runescape. 
---
I still play both to this day, with LONG periods of not playing both to be fair, but they both have their attracting features. 
---
Yea my webmd suggests you are gay but it's cool

Oh, wow, i should tell my wife and go find a husband, shame too, we had a good run but if i got the gay its too late for us.

if he weighs more than a graceful set BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
---
Thanks, man.

add Hunter tome pls

Any one that’s against this because it’s ezscape I’d just like to point out if you die to a boss in most cases you can buy your items back with money from your bank....  If you can do that all the way across the map why the hell wouldn’t you be able to use the money from your bank, at the bank? Lol 
---
Due to popular demand i got the fucking ring. time to afk nmz to get enough points to imbue it. 
---
The one chunk guy seems to be doing okay.
---
Over time theres suggestions/ideas on reddit that get a lot of support and even jmods commenting on liking the ideas (hell they even get talked about on QnAs sometimes with approval/fondness) to never be heard of again. What happens with these ideas. Will they ever be polled or anything? 
---
If specifics are needed, I guess I'll have to have a list ready for next weeks lol. 
---
Also farming pet chance from new kebos stuff when? 
---
It sounds like the osrs community is bored due to most content being saturated. 
---
Last week ish?
---
See I think it's a bit bigger than selling gold. Some people bot for high scores or other various reasons. When it comes down to it, there not really much you can do to stop botting.
---
  
---
Even if you might think that's true of the combat system there is so much more to the game than combat. Runescape still has the best quests and story in the business and an extensive skilling system. 
---
 I joined Osrs after those fools at jagex added the action bar. If I wanted to play Wow I would play my old death knight build for fucks sake 
---
One of the best things about runelite is the constant updates and dedicated coders. As far as jagex should be concerned it's free work for their product.
---
I wouldn't say it copied WoW exactly but took things from popular MMO's. The new achievement point system is pretty similar to WoW's which isn't a bad thing really. A lot of the interfaces are similar. Also with the game being faster to level up and a bigger focus on end game content it's getting similar to WoW where the only real updates are for end game and getting there as quickly as possible. Obviously it's not as quick as WoW where you can just buy max level and jump straight into the end game but I can see it going down that direction and it's not necessarily a bad thing I guess.
---
!Remindme 10 hours
---
I think the only buff we should ever consider is making them only drop clue specific items (uniques).
---
Agreed! Its great how the other graceful colours are unlockable for skillers because its skilling clothing, it shouldn't be locked behind slayer. Maybe add something to the stone chests that can be used to purchase it, or a large amount of lizard fangs or xerician fabric?

I mean it's still agility content for agility gear. So for me that is related. 
---
Grinding out slayer specifically to unlock this, doesn't feel right IMO. 
---
I think the actual cost coming from agility, coupled with reqs like the Kebos hard is more fitting. 
---
How long did it take :)

i disagree entirely

And there are a minimum of 10 suicide bots making cannonballs at edgeville 24/7.

80% of the coin pouch use is literally for this. Usually a fan of QOL updates but this just doesn't fit. It's way too easy to open your bank and withdraw coins in 3 seconds anyways.

after about 3 hours of calculations i have come to a conclusion that this drop would have to be about 50/50
---
That or make them each have their own special effect like cure poison, reduce prayer drain, or increase magic defense; things along those lines.
---
This can be done already and if implemented would only really benefit merchers in the long haul 
---
Nice idea that I think we’ve all had but I couldn’t see this passing if polled 
---
what
---
I'm using the official app that someone on reddit linked in a big thread reminiscing about the old days. I'm happy with the app.
---
I think someone else had the right idea, because I use a password that I use for a lot of things the password is probably compromised already from leaks back in the day and somebody in Vietnam just got a hit when mining for accounts.
---
I've managed to successfully appeal that the account is mine to JAGEX and it's been re-activated. I have created a brand new password that I've never used before that is just a random jumble of letters and numbers, so it's going to take me a bit to get used to but will be worth it. I think I am going to change my passwords on everything ever.
---
I've had someone log into my google account from Vietnam twice but googles security measures have blocked them both times because it's obviously not me.
---
I've been a bit of an idiot here because I used a password I already know is compromised but figured it would be safe because I didn't think the hackers would think to try my password for a runescape account. 
---
Lesson learnt and I thank all for the advice.
---
They chose to limit themselves.
---
I don't get why people hate the ditch. Its a crack in the Earth from when Zamorak nuked Forinthry . It gives a feeling when jumping over it like Oh shit I'm in the wilderness. I always thought it looked cool at least better then nothing at all. 
---
Devalues my GE only ironman
---
Get woox too do infernal on this 
---
Probably because f2p players can only enchant amulets. If they made the ring enchantable in f2p, it might be confusing for new players that one ring can be enchanted but others can't be.
---
No this is patrick
---
Wildy alter is half price. 
---
I think level 40 is a suitable ceiling for the F2P combat skills, seeing as the reward from dragon slayer is the ability to wear the best F2P plate-body. Going any higher would infringe on the content that members already pay for too much. This is because F2P is meant to be a promotion for players to buy membership. However, one area of F2P combat that I think could be improved is the crossbows, seeing as only the bronze crossbow/phoenix crossbow is available, resulting in a very limited variation of training methods.
---
I think possibly I owe you an apology, even though your theory that I'd been phished was wrong it was me being lazy and stupid that caused the issue.
---
I used a password I know had already been compromised because I figured the hackers wouldn't be thinking to cross check it with a runescape account and I was wrong. Thankfully I've got my account back and as you say I need to practise safer internet habits.
---
I second this, it’s probably because they’re less known than other bones, same with wyrm bones
---
I agree. I am a skiller my self. I was just pointing out the failure in logic of the comment I replied to.
---
Cool!

Do slayer until 85 melee range and magic and then go raids

I was only able to grind out full graceful by slaying simultaneously on another account. Way easier to half ass two things than to focus entirely on agility. Fuck agility.

Does anyone else think there is enough graceful recolors in the game? Some might even say too many

Less clicks, longer mouse life, mouse keeps value for longer.

Why not just give a piece of graceful every 8 agility tickets? See this is the same concept, irreverent content. 
---
Fair enough, I'm sure you're right but I'm just confused, the wiki says they have 125 mage and 120 range level, but 80 mage defence and 140 range defence.
---
Is our attack tested against their combat level or their specific defence level?

God damn that’s actually insane, I might do it, if not you can use wyrm bones for 35m 99 prayer but it’s 175k exp an hour

eoc looks like wow, but it doesn't play anything like it. jagex made just about every mistake it was possible to make. damage values are wildly variable, CC breaks are on the GCD, abilities have virtually no synergy. hotkey-mmo-101 type of stuff. all those years of blizzard polish were completely lost in translation.
---
a game combining the best bits of wow and runescape would have been amazing. it's actually amazing how thoroughly they wasted that potential.

How do i configure the my search engine(s) (on firefox, chrome and ie) yo land directly on the new wiki?

---
its the only hood that makes sense to have an effect though, and its not a buff at all, purely cosmetic, even with a downgrade of not having the negative weight reduction.
---
Someone with 99 agility can surely swap out Gracefood hood for Agility hood, I don't see the issue I don't think people still start begging for other hoods to have an effect. 
---
Yeah well same line from that rule book states account sharing is against the rules - which have been said is ok unless the player gains "unfair advantage".
---
Those rules are more or less guide lines.
---
If the player would state something along the lines of: The player whom give me an item will be heavily rewarded - and then proceed to give away a item of significant less value. Thats more dishonest.
---
I agree however, begging is a grey area but in my opinion they arent doing anything wrong by simply asking for a item. 
---
People buying gold is the reason why botting exists. Plain and simple
---
Quantity &lt; Quality, he doesn't have any of that.
---
They're not specifically useful for anything tbh. Being a designated tank at Bandos is probably the only use they have really have.
---
They are good boots, it's just that in most scenarios you really don't need defence bonus, which makes Dragon and Primordial boots better.
---
then you would be able to wear things like ice gloves and still keeping the set effect? 
---
More like r/lostredditors
---
Wintertodd. Barb fishing too every now and then. 
---
For an account that far along how is your farming so low
---
After you done some of the hardest bosses in the game for a couple times I imagine its not that hard to do it again since you know what to expect while pking is random and you can never know what skill pking level is your opponent and that is what i meant, but it makes your argument look bad so you decided not to think about it like that.

The problem with jailbait is how wildly different it is from fishing bait. When you go fishing, the fish is in the water, you have the rod and know where the fish will come from.

I support - though I think you should be able to choose how you pay, i.e. it shouldn't automatically just take money from your bank unless you tell it to. You should have the option to just use whatever cash is in your inventory, without having to work out how much that is so you don't go over and use your bank funds.

Once you’ve shown the basement NPC a rune defender once you only need tokens to get in, regardless of you have any defenders currently on you.
---
What impresses me the most is that he pays 5 memberships
---
If you need any help or advice DisperseRS :) 
---
ah yes, i should have remembered this at monday when rs3 got it quest that locates in cook guild and i accidentally forgot the chef hat when i went to do it.
---
Use Karils instead of armadyl cus there’s no negative attack bonus’ on karils where as there is with armadyl 
---
Meh, if you get the sinhaza tier 5 cape, I think every single person would have full completion. Still pretty cool to get pet+ item completion this early on :)
---
It's not that it isn't possible, just not worth the amount of time it would take for a couple of players who can't seem to use a mouse. Even zoomed out all the way that hitbox is at least the size of an inventory slot. 
---
Looks like you hit the rune essence drop twice 
---
Sweet 
---
I actually don't. It took 4 times the drop rate to jump on reddit and complain. Surely when you go 4.7x the drop rate it will start to feel extremely shit. 
---
Based off of the statistics document i'm at 99.18% that i should've seen the pickaxe by this killcount. While it's not fully accurate and whether it was or wasn't there it's still rng to get I'm just tilted that's all. 
---
I bring karils to "debuff" then swap to arma for the actual kill, -14 stab doesn't matter against corp with 30% of his defence
---
Ha ha, I do that. 
---
I'm not hating on any one. I'm aware he has a disorder and with a lot of autistic people routine and repetition are fundamental. He's put an insane amount of hours in to the game which is fine, but I don't think it should be praised because it probably wouldn't of happened if he wasn't autistic. 
---
With the likes of b0aty/shroud/anyone else, that's their job basically.
---
Lynx doesn't have a job.
---
i legitimately hate you atm... gj 
---
The way I see it is they should be punished for it, but I definitely don't hold it against them for doing it. 
---
Can we please have boss spawn timers all other 3rd clients have it and very surprised it's not already in the game
---
Please!!!!yes please this is what I’ve wanted for years 
---
This is the type of shit that makes pvp more exciting than pvm. It wasn't a bug, his target was just in the middle of the obstacle when he target teleported. That is fantastic gameplay to watch, because even the streamer couldn't predict something like that
---
You can now get to the Virgin islands. Congrats.
---
Just got my dragon defender back, I didn't need to grind from bronze to rune again. PSA to anyone who lost their dragon defender: you don't need the other defenders to get it back
---
whats your set up? I have a dhcb but im thinking of selling it for other pvm gear 
---
Fully support!

I can’t help but read anything in his voice now like a Morgan Freeman effect 
---
Would adding an xp/h calculator be considered qol? I'm constantly on mobile so run runelite is out of the question. 
---
Maybe it could be added to the xp setup near the minimap. Setting it up could either show all xp/h gained or you could choose a specific skill and reset the counter as you please.
---
Guys, I'm level 17 cooking and I can't cook this trout. It's not a special trout or anything. What's wrong?
---
2 rounds of 12 dwh specs before kill on karils then arma so I'm tankier, no 0s anyway
---
not being hit too often is important as I have to micromanage 3 accs
---
so I guess I'll have to just stick with dwh specs?
---
I love it when he randomly explodes with anger for dying or making a mistake. I just watched his vid on Mountain Daughter and he went berserk when the Kendall killed im
---
With the recent expansions to the kebbos lowlands and morytania as well as the upcoming prifddinas update can we expect and expansion to menaphos on the horizon? If so is this area likely to be the eventual location of raids 3 or some other analogous content?

please can you do something about the wyrms, i appreciate the work gone into them, but after a long task they're quite headache inducing.
---
not really, look up a full list of god items, quite a few of them are like 5k or free from quests
---
Nicely done
---
I love that he’s basically saying “lmao this idiot actually gave me 200k”
---
For about a month or so, the daily amount of cannonballs sold went from average 40m to average 100m+ cballs every day. With that the price dropped by 20 ea or so. Recently that stopped, it dropped back to 40m, and the price shot up again. I can only think they banned a massive bot farm that made and sold about 1,8 billion cannonballs in that period.
---
Hey guys question regarding bonds  
---
Any ways to buy bonds for osrs mobile? as far as i can see the only purchaseable there is the monthly membership by not using visa or other cards but by mobile load  
---
and anyone living in abu dhabi uae knows where to purchase paysafe cards? Thanks in advance
---
Depends on what items you have unlocked so far, but I don't think you should be down 100+k
---
Its always been a huge long term goal for me.
---
I still can’t do it even with those. I still have to glance at my screen every few seconds.
---
it's not that hard not to check, just have a little self control
---
I would get rid of the white recolor for this tbh
---
Don’t scare the noobs
---
If your hitpoints is higher than 70 you can access the zamorak section of the god wars dungeon, just wear a zamorak item to stop the monsters agro'ing you.

Oxford dictionary changes its definitions based on corners of culture. Context always matters in interpretation. Absolute unit comes from a meme and is used all around. It’s just a shorthand way of saying something is a display of pinnacle physique. Often used sarcastically.

Fuck you, man.

Hot dang this is a 3 month old comment. Its not like I made up the number 0.15, the calculator calculated it. If you just blindly think bandos is better "because its bandos" you're fooling yourself. Let actual data drive your views, not how things feel.
---
Kronos seed Master race dude. Averaging 200k exp a day as an iron. 
---
Doesn't help with the game looking bad to noobs 
---
There's no way you can know how much data I've looked at from my comment?
---
Justiciar is a loss of 0.48 dps which means 10-15 second slower kills factoring in BGS. This is not made up by the amount of times you have to eat less as these are so limited.

You aint flicking prayers whilst having a shit. These are just straight up script kiddies.

Yeah but its slow and afkish.

Fast crafting xp requires bossing, which is again balanced.

See my reply to the other guy. I am fully aware that people do that. In this case though, there is literally 0 evidence that this guy ever said he'd give anything in return. It's one line completely taken out of context. Sure, maybe he said that as well, but until OP offers a screenshot not taken out of context I highly doubt that was the case here. OP had no reason not to just post the whole damn picture then instead of this, which I'm assuming was taken out of context for reddit karma. 
---
However, if this guy was actually promising some 'reward' in return, yeah, I think the book should be thrown at him. Until then though this is not another witchhunt brought to you by the hivemind that is reddit.
---
I've reported so many of those, my ignore list is full of them

Oh, you sweet summer child

You mean 5 bonds every two weeks?

Just use them to merch, I have a merchant alt which more than pays for itself.

I just bought the new IPhone for the big screen to play osrs. I was wondering has anyone else had problems with osrs crashing on iOS especially when you are trying to open the map in game?
---
brimstone keys are mediocre and rare, duradel and nieve give tasks with better normal drops/faster kills on average, so tou make more with them in the long run
---
Yeah, that’s what I was doing my calculations by, I just misworded my comment. If your median is 20% below the other groups median, then ~83% of your population is below their median intelligence, since IQ has a standard deviation of 15 and is always centered at 100 for humans.

I felt like all the hype built around Billy was thrown out the window when Disney killed the Netflix Marvel shows. When they had to kill all possibility of another season I think it screwed Billy because he was gonna be big bad in season 3

Saving 2 seconds on something you do thousands of times results in saving hours of your time. This fits the description of QoL.

If you can pay the 100k fee to recover your items from instanced bosses, without withdrawing gold from the bank, why not do the same for the GE?

And it's also case insensitive!
---
Congrats! Just got the same thing along with my first 99! Started again when mobile game out.
---
this is why i said if you've got money to blow. getting a nice POH is literally one of the best long term investments you can make on your account i think so may as well get it done early if they can afford it. 
---
when I can safespot a quest boss with ranget &gt;&gt;
---
Last I checked, you could get like 2m xp per hour or more in fetching if you can afford it. That's like 6 hours for a 99, so it really isnt Much.
---
This guy is maxed though so it's actually huge.
---
You can do the same while the gold is in your inventory.
---
I'm sure it would be a toggle though. Something that could prioritize taking gold from your inventory first, or just the option to turn it off.
---
*Gets whole inventory of items*

Yes! I play it on both an Android phone and an iPad. The crashing on iOS is really bad, and it does indeed happen often when opening the map.
---
SGS all day everyday
---
Sarcasm doesnt translate through text. Like, at all.
---
There are really people out there like this.
---
It's pretty average gp/h, it just takes a lot of hours to get 99
---
He's going to ask for a fury until someone either gives him one, if not, hop to the next world. Once someone falls for it, that's when the dialogue changes. He will start to ask for more items with the promise to be on a YT video or something similar. He will try to get as much as he can out out you once you fall for his initial scam, because he knows you are guilliable.
---
Does OP mention the coins stay on your character after leaving the GE screen? No.
---
So no, not a coin pouch.
---
tell u what mate
---
Idk pet is what I’m going for so sounds like pretty good luck to me.
---
"if you can afford it" is key here

This is what diary rewards should be. Not buffs to skills.

Is there any chance at all of new haircuts and beard styles ever being added to the game? The current choices are so limited.

Or the konar teleport

Bc rsps r dum
---
Indeed. Most useful thing ever.
---
Lol, I like that the players are considered the adults in this scenario. In reality the whole reason hiding results would help is because players just go with what's more popular when they can't think for themselves, or they simply refuse to vote because the poll isn't going their way.
---
SGS 100%

Good luck with your grind! Hope you get it soon

Aaaaaaaaayyyyy laaahmaaaoooo.

4 dwh specs and bring dragon or crystal hally as spec weps after dwh specs.also elite void is best imo at corp

ur shit

but dude, they're going up in 4k HDR now and they look SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD! I don't really mind the scripted-ness of it since it's one of the few pieces of streamable content that really use my TV's capabilities

No idea I was high

Then it got full of itself and become overly complicated and difficult to follow.

How long until the next video? :(

Don’t worry it won’t pass either way, pures don’t get updates because pvmers are scared of a 60-90 combat bracket 
---
osrs combat mechanics are severely outdated. thats just what makes it old school tho ig
---
Congratulations you wasted your own time and posted about it on reddit.
---
Untrim capes look different but it's more of the novelty of having it.
---
Whenever I commented, there was a person saying it's not that impressive these days.  But that comment is now collapsed with -40ish votes.

Bet he's got a granite ring too.

just mass downvote them all :)

Yeah I’ll pass on that one. 😭
---
Don't have it in front of me, but I don't recall seeing those kind of settings. Where are they found?
---
You have an option to report for solicitation 
---
Not trying to make a meme out of this. I hang out a lot at the ge and its a common practice were people will flash their wealth (usually a twisted bow or something) and will ask for an relative expensive item. People will then give that item to the beggar in the hopes that the rich beggar will reward them or compensate them.
---
it is likely but it still needed to be said if people are actually draining their enjoyment in the game with this behavior
---
To make you non questing/diary plebs suffer daily. 
---
Xshare
---
Motherlode mine is full of these too.  Rune pick, garbage stats, generic name, run turned off, with like 90+ mining.  They stay logged in like 24/7 too, I see them allll the time.
---
Also check out all the plank making bots in Camelot on PvP worlds.  There's a huge amount of low level accounts running planks with the butler and cammy tp.
---
I dunno the 4th wall breaks didn't seem terribly unique, Malcom in the Middle was doing the same shit decades ago, the dialogue was decent at times and absolute trash at others and the production values were pretty good but eh, good production doesn't make a good tv show. I mean I'm not gonna judge anyone for liking it, each to their own but personally I think it's massively over hyped compared to things like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad or The Wire. It's not a terrible show but I do not understand how it got the following it did. 
---
Awesome! Great work then :D
---
I don't even get how this is a scam? What would the other person get out of doing this?
---
He's trying to trick gullible noobs.
---
You can only be logged for 20 minutes while in combat and not doing anything. 
---
Sure does look awfully a lot like sub zero
---
A Friends first HCIM was easily more popular but then he decided to fuck himself over lol
---
What happened?
---
It's a hard diary req... not Elite. And Kebos Hard has pretty lax requirements.
---
Rip 50M xp.
---
Ah, I'm like upper 40s Hunter and have hated all the time wasted trapping &amp; releasing lizards, missing kebbits with falcons, and picking up bird snares that fell over. I've heard chins are worth a bit of cash but I'd rather be runecrafting than standing in a swamp with nets and rope. 
---
lol nice
---
I feel, it was sarcasm. 
---
Whats a gf
---
Just gotta read my other replies and I cover that m8.
---
Bet this guy made billions flipping. That’s what it was. 
---
he decided tos cam his viewers for a few bill then sold out to promote RWT getting all his accs banned lol
---
welcome to capitalism 
---
Why is everyone so obsessed with this series I don’t get it
---
No barrows gloves...savage...

Everyone seems to have forgotten that you still haven't [paid up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9w73h4/mrmole73/)

Appreciate it guys &lt;3
---
Just do birdhouses then. When you reach mahogany you get 1020 xp per house so 4080xp every 50 mins for literally 2 mins work.
---
Did you read my other responses? I'm fully aware of the situation that this post is supposed to portray. Without context though this is just a witchhunt, nothing more.

HES AN ANIMAL IF YOU DONT GIVE HIM THE DHIDE ILL CRY UWU SAD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I still love spacey :)

Sorry I don’t have my ghostspeak amulet on me, can someone please translate?

Yeah, I did.
---
Fastest smithing is gold Gauntlets at blast furnice. But if you don't want to deal with that, make steel 2h until 48 then steel plate bodies until 50.
---
I think cannoning is cheaper at earlier levels tho?
---
Because they have no idea what they're talking about because the only have they've ever played in their life is RuneScape (whether it be 3 or Old School, or both.)
---
its incredible the amount of people in this thread that apparently can't read.
---
I couldn't care less about this either way, but atleast half of you bitching have conflated this with something else.
---
This isn't about adding a coin pouch.
---
Reading comprehension is your friend people. 
---
Mithril darts. Questing or achievement diaries. And like 3 days worth of tree runs. 
---
NOT MY FUCKING POST PLEASE
---
Pretty sure the top is worth way more on the GE
---
You’re a meme 
---
You know too much about horse testicles
---
Well if you’re dumb enough to give him a fury it’s your loss to be fair...  he never said you’d get anything in return. He’s just trying to get funds for his 2nd tbow. 
---
Then I have no idea why you felt the need to comment that then when I already covered that, but alright.
---
Blue cape better 
---
Humble
---
Hopefully you credit the Jagex player model designer too every time you post a recolor
---
New quest, swamp diplomacy.
---
that does not affect the DPS calculator .
---
It seems like iron men get the thriving pet or agility pet super earlier
---
So tell me this what will OSRS and classic WOW make ?
---
Decided to do zulrah but then I got a blue drag task. So I’m still at Vorkath for now
---
This could also give some of them some use in combat as another combo food like guthix rest maybe. It's also sort of thematically fitting since they're barbarian content.
---
Yeah I guess so, not worth selling them yet though, they’re worth over 7k 100% 
---
This is sarcastic, right?
---
It's not just about strength and intelligence though. Bears wouldn't be able to make weapons and tools, throw spears, or just about anything that requires that kind of precision. Their chubby little murder mittens just wouldn't be able to do it.
---
Yeah my average is like 2 mins with void, but I find it heavily depends on whether or not you get a good bgs spec at the start 
---
Currently, Old School Runescape by Jagex is a fun and compelling game, as it is fairly difficult.
---
If this change were to go through and the shortcut no longer required medium diaries, then Old School Runescape by Jagex would no longer be a difficult game, and as such, would cease to be complelling fun.
---
TLDR: It'S eAsYsCaPe!!!1!!
---
If you lack the quest points, getting to the Catacombs is faster coming from Draynor/Draynor Manor (since tabs stack). Suppose a Rimmington house teleport might work the same though. Going to Konar I tele to the Farming Guild vis Skill Necklace. 
---
Obviously fairy rings are the way to go but a lot of people, myself included, don’t have the ability to use them yet. Also you don’t need the spell book unlocked to use the tabs which were around 1.2k each. Since they stack, I figured that was more convenient that carrying around a Glory with me on Slayer tasks. 
---
Lmao, I've only been to the catacombs like 3 times.I'm sure if I end up going more I'll get teletabs. 
---
f2p needs tb
---
I did on my twitter actually :) nice try though
---
That’s my point it’s just such a pain in the ass. I just do not have the skills for most diaries and most of the time I really don’t want to have to go around doing a bunch of unrelated shit when I just want to grind one skill at a time. The rewards are worth it, there’s no disputing that but it’s just so damn out of the way most of the time. 
---
Hi SphericalBox!
---
I for one find this deplorable. This is a disgusting witch hunt that needs to stop. What if this person was just seeing if someone was nice enough to trust them with a fury, I bet he gave them back 2x more than what was trusted. This is why we need the wall.
---
The one in the top left?
---
Probably too useful to gate it behind a diary after the fact.
---
Ehhhh not quite, I'm closer to being a cute noob. Only started up again last month after a 14 or so year absence. 
---
Lmao oookay Joe Rogan 
---
Why is there not a ring round that finger?
---
I couldn't watch it after the side-character's of a side-character's backstory were getting backstories. 
---
99 rc squad. Doing all the bad 99s first. Working on mining now.
---
Moments before disaster
---
My pb in that setup is 2:14 going to switch to void today. And 100% fastest kill so far was with a big hit from DWH
---
You do you.
---
Big congrats 
---
it's not that they don't wanna fuck with it because they can't, its because of the insane player backlash, and they want to be respectful about it. jagex knows they have players that are paralyzed 11 year olds who play the game with a trackball mouse, and it probably looks exactly like a bot who cant talk, since maybe all they do all day is train. There are also hardcore skillers who just turn off chat.
---
I fucking love that guy, I would never expect that I could watch a 1,5hr youtube video about getting 60 wc. 
---
Same
---
Okay so how about we introduce preset inventory and armour setups like rs3, since you do that thousands of times as well? How about a one-click agility course to save you all the effort too? Play the game cunt and stop wanting to make it easier
---
He finna chomp at the end therr
---
Could we get an option to right-click cast the regular Fertile Soil spell if we have the ultracompost version unlocked? Right now the only option is to drop all the volcanic ash in your inventory before casting it (and getting the drop/cast warning) every time you want to use the regular version instead. 
---
Make sure you insure it.
---
Not sure why you think bears couldn’t make and throw spears with 80% human intelligence. Their paws are useful enough, they can certainly make a throwing motion, and they would have the brain capacity for it.
---
 
---
Also, the cost of being able to use the shortcut is hugely disproportionate to the utility of it.
---
The only real use of the shortcut is getting to a fishing spot if none spawn bank-side, which isn't very useful at all.
---
As much as he loves little boys?
---
DUDE WEED LMAO
---
Or just make bonuses like that work on the dummy instead of adding unnecessary upgrades.
---
I agree friend,in my younger days I remember having my mother pay for my membership back in 2007-2010, now im in my early 20's and pay for my own. Its a game that you cant  put down once you start back up against. I love it, im enjoying every second, it is a masterpiece. Mobile has created a new revival of sorts to the series bringing in more new players, amazing! Having an incredible time killing dragons and using my cannon. In one month I reached 81 combat and 991 total skill level. Cheers!
---
Lol what about the guy who died on had for the 9th time yesterday :(
---
Haha, he's still doing it. Had to log in to see for myself. Got some of the bridhouse bois to chip in a few reports too
---
First two seasons were pure unadulterated spacey-kino. Let's forget anything else happened.
---
stake it then pussy
---
Got a bucket on KC 1 and 3, never been lucky at other bosses/demi bosses. No Groot, would love to know the drop rate
---
Well you can do about 20 medium clues per hour and master clues are a 1/30 drop rate from them.
---
Why did you think that this effect was specific to the DWH? As soon as the first person used a DWH spec on Verzik and everyone saw the message, we all knew that *no* defence lowering weapons would work on her.
---
And then everyone in the Grand Exchange clapped.
---
They've already said no
---
so.. be consistent and say "(boostable)"
---
I had extended antifires and shield so I wasn’t taking damage from dragon fire it was just taking forever for me to kill it
---
Is not is?
---
Oh no, someone on the 2007scape reddit called me a nerd! The CGI looks fine. Are you all forgetting what movies ~used to~ look like? From what I understand he’s not in genie form very often in the movie? 
---
I’m thinking people will find something wrong with literally anything just so they can belly-ache about it and have some random internet strangers play sycophant to them so they feel validated. 
---
OSRS mobils is a life saver. Only annoyance I've had is the Inventory panel and magic/prayer panel should be able to be open at the same time. Without F keys on mobile, it's such a nuisance to play. 
---
Cool thank you!
---
Don't you worry I have the complete opposite of that. First 3 kills reward totals. 5 Kronos, 3 Spirit Tree seeds..........
---
I think the post is fine.
---
nice
---
I was chatting with a guy while fighting turoths one night after a Christmas party. He friended me and traded his fury for my glory. Real nice dude.
---
We can throw spears and shit while they would be limited to melee due to physical differences.
---
Dude, they’re not eating the cats, they’re using them to catch mice, to help the people in West Ardougne. And you don’t have to do it, it’s just an optional bit of bonus content. 
---
Also if that’s what’s got you hung up, wait til you hear about the stray dog in Varrock....
---
So I got two Rune defenders for nothing? Shit. 
---
Does the nmz method cost a lot?
---
Would jagex be open to stop putting out large content so frequently and taking time to address other issues instead? There are many things that are ruining the game that are just getting pushed under the rug and eventually they will come back

RWT is already bannable though

Alright, move along Hitler.

I've heard him mess it up a couple of times but very rare.
---
But if you have a fury and a torso (especially with just a whip), it might come off as if you bond bought for it. Not my opinion, just the most common train of thought. Zenyte jewelry set and weapons (along with special use items like Guthans) are much better investments anyway.
---
Keep training your slayer - you’re getting close to a level where you’ll have a lot of profitable tasks unlocked. 
---
Do Monkey Madness 2, this turns black demons into one of the most profitable tasks because of demonic gorillas, one zenyte drop will keep you a member for over a month. 
---
Someone recommended herb runs - if you can be assed to do ranarr runs and make ~100k profit per run, you’d only need to do 2 runs per day for 14 days to be really close to a bond. 
---
Toilet OSRS is real mvp
---
It’s a meme that, as usual, everyone without an original thought jumps on. If U want my personal opinion. His video series is dumb as hell. Rs content creators have run out of ideas so they do shit like this. 
---
It's something they probably should have done as it introduces some interesting things like making manipulating markets harder, and gives a reason for people to find traders when buying selling large masses of resources.  However because of slow price updating thst opens the door for people to scam/rip people off when prices get weird
---
It’s extra great because he has a reminder in the video that you need regular spice and he himself messes up 
---
Understandable Sir. Have a great Day.

Swampletics is a character that the YouTuber "Settled" created after maxing his Ultimate Iron Man. Settled has been creating a YouTube series. The premise of the Swampletics series is that he is playing another Ultimate Iron Man, but this time he cannot leave the region of Morytania (commonly referred to as Morytania locked). He has set various goals for himself, hoping to eventually beat the Theatre of Blood (Raids 2) without ever leaving Morytania. This series is filled with unique challenges that a normal player wouldn't normally partake in. I would suggest watching the first video if you think this sounds interesting!  
---
P.S. Ultimate Iron Man (UIM): Game mode where the player cannot use a bank.
---
I never said that? That wasnt even remotely the point of what i said.
---
Its still money you can use somewhere else and that you worked for longer than if you just use irl money. Opportunity cost is literally a cost.
---
This is not a debate, its a fact. You need to make over 6m per hour to even think about competing with min wage jobs. You need 15m per hour to even think about competing with my salary. There is no method that can compete with even min wage jobs apaet from ToB, and you'd need 2x ToB gp ra5es to even reach my irl salary. 
---
Buying p2p with bonds is less efficient than with irl money, this is fact.
---
Then sell it? It's a videogame don't do what's not fun
---
I thought it was a forced meme but people seem to genuinely enjoy it. He also only posts once a week but we get 20 posts a day about it.
---
Well you are certainly entitled to your opinion. 
---
Because 99% of the other rs youtubers are literally only doing wintertodt or clues and their commentary sounds usually like a cheap boaty soundboard.

A Friend had solo account before Iron, that I remember.

Yeah, somewhere around 7-8k based on xp. Good time to buy
---
That's what house tabs and portals are for.
---
lmao every time
---
&gt;I see no point in changing something because a minority doesn't like it.
---
You literally changed it though. Now, if you change it back, your comment will be made worse for it. 
---
So it seems you did see a point, and do realize how your wording could easily be misinterpreted.
---
It's almost embarrassing how defensive you're being about this, especially after the fact that you buckled and edited your comment to clarify.
---
You'll immediately have better command of the English language if you improve your phrasing. It's really up to you, though. No one here cares if you want to go through life being worse at English.
---
Make it possible to get grape seeds some other way to give the vinery a point. Currently the only way to get them is accessed at 100% Hosidius favour even though the vinery is accessed at 60% favour.
---
Also dead minigames, items, whatever you can think of.
---
New prayer content :D
---
Mole claws

That’s true.

The reason I play OSRS is for the nostalgia, and I didn’t have money to buy bonds when I was 12 so I’m not gonna start now.
---
Feels better having earned it.
---
Slaying monsters and parenting like a boss
---
I'm honestly almost more interested in him than Swampletics just because he's so unpolished. Swampletics is like peak performance, onechunkman is a kid playing in a puddle of mud and I love it.
---
Begging should be a muteable offense, give it three days or something at first. 2 weeks for second. Permamute for 3rd.
---
Some of stuff your suggesting here is really starting to worry me. 
---
&gt;currently it's more profitable to sell seeds gained from combat and other means rather than plant them and sell the produce. 
---
No it isn't? Herb runs are extremely good profit
---
Yes, they can. Treat them as normal teak trees.
---
I get a nostalgic feeling when I see him grind for example a mithril scimitar. He has a clear goal with interesting rules, nice editing and a nice voice.
---
What outfit is this 
---
Yes.
---
Thank you :)
---
Not sure why people are posting so many brimstone key loots they are just konar drops lol
---
That's because it's been retardedly easy for anyone to make gold since mop. You don't even have to think. The mindless casual content gives way more gold than farming did in earlier xpacs. 
---
WOD Garrison? That shit printed money, and still kinda does.
---
Begging was incredibly prevalent in wow before that, though. People would constantly sit by the AH asking for money on low level toons. Hell, the first like 20g I got in wow was from "begging". First dude I asked for money sent me like 10g in the mailbox. 
---
Back then, I didn't know about the 1hr delay, so I thought it was just lost. I told him I didn't get the money, and I guess he didn't know of the 1hr timer either, and he traded me another 10g.
---
Logged in the next day, got the first 10g out of my mailbox and I felt like a fucking BALLER.
---
Even outside of that though, wow community was a lot friendlier and helpful. if you were in a social guild you essentially didn't need to beg, there were plenty of players willing to help guildies with no questions asked. I still have the person added on battlenet who gave me my first 600g for my epic mount in TBC. That was an insane amount of money to just hand over to someone.
---
You’re doing the right thing.
---
If they made it easier to become a Player Mod we’d see less of this, I think. They’d also obviously have to watch them more, because nerds are rather petty and frivolous at times, but if we could mute these people ourselves instead of just reporting and ignoring I feel like it would cut down on the amount of players getting scammed. Mainly new ones that I’m worried about. Getting scammed for the 20k you made killing cows in Lumbridge for two days or the account you finally got to lv40 Defence would surely turn someone off. 
---
Ughhhh fine take your +1. Here I was getting ready to downvote some noob getting 99 fletching. 
---
I mean this is just the loot, you wouldn't pick this shit up considering the method for 1m+ xp/hr involves using auto retaliate and moving between two corner spots every attack, actually picking these drops up would unstack the monkeys and lower your xp/hr significantly, i'd still recommend the method though. Runelite just doesn't account for what you don't pick up, it just lists EVERYTHING dropped. Also it's more than 37m. The chins alone he mentioned cost more than 37m, and that doesn't even take into account the cost of staminas/ranging potions and the time taken to charge the bone crusher.
---
I remember wandering around f2p wearing members stuff back in the day.  This one group of f2pers called me Darth Vader when I walked by in full Lunar.
---
Explain?
---
God, never gotten them before. Yesterday I got the Dragon Gloves unlocked. Now for the quest grind to get to 175 qp
---
I got my skeletal visage at 180kc, it wasn’t worth the price stated more like 32m I think 
---
Cost doesn't really matter in the first place, although that really shouldn't happen either.  It's the fact that people have to constantly heal. It also makes absolutely no sense that you're actually punished for having better defensive stats (higher hp) by being forced to heal even more and therefore get  lower xp rates.
---
I still have all the old defenders lol
---
Its not hard, and it's not easy
---
Congrats mate, now it’s just wasting time sitting in a cash stack though. Put it into gear and supplies for leveling.
---
sorry this isn't some tiny asian girl getting groped in public, not interested.

Bought 200m worth over a month ago haha 😂 just slowly waiting...

Damn good luck

"Should the Wilderness ditch be replaced with a barrier that you do not have to click on? This barrier would require confirmation on a warning screen before you may cross to prevent luring."
---
Does this mean it returns to how it was pre-ditch in 2006 or would it be like a visible magical barrier?
---
Pretty much.
---
Divine spirit shield. Vote yes, corp needs some love
---
Stakers all have this mindset. Do I have money? I should stake it. Do I not have money? I should stake to make more money because it’s fast.
---
A freak accident bug is definitely not the reason pvp is exciting lol.
---
And yes it was a bug.
---
I’ve set my sights on a fight cape as my next achievement so no doubt it will all go on good ranged gear and supplies.
---
The thing is though, with 90 slayer you haven't unlocked a task that is even half as profitable as just killing Zulrah. 
---
It's close to the way I play the game, so I like it. Can't imagine playing a normie account.

- Should we add Divine?
---
- Should we make it impossible to misclick Veng/Crumble Undead?
---
Fuck off, this isn't QOL. 
---
Blowpipe for sure then. Probably also want a Verac’s skirt and if possible try to get it on task and you can use a slayer helm imbued and breeze through the waves. 
---
At least the new wiki is showing up on google now, sometimes it’s even the first result. 
---
Really? Which herbs? I'd like to get into farming for profit but it always seemed like there were a lot of hurdles to maximise efficiency.
---
Muhh children. Bro is this your first day in the internet or what
---
What? Divine? I'm sorry how is Divine in any way considered QOL???? Please take a stance on what you mean by QOL because it literally does not make any sense
---
People don't read. QOL was last week. This is for Week 3 - Re-Runs. 
---
I've just set function mode to always right click, makes things a little longer but I find with holding down if you character is moving it can be hard 
---
Thanks for the reply 
---
Yeah you're right
---
Just trolling
---
Lol why so mad, but please keep going. This is exactly why I love commentsections! If yoz actually read other comments, someone wrote a helpful one recommending to use "(boostable)" instead of just trying to go all in on me, just like you did. You talk so proudly of your english, I bet you dont even know other languages. The point of a language is to understand eachother, not to brag about anything.
---
meanwhile i am 2,3k+ kc without one, ehh.
---
Divine spirit shield was not polled last week.
---
Don't the devs spend enough time recoloring shit, this is RuneScape not a coloring book! Lol but that being said ur recolor doesn't look bad.
---
I haven’t watched it all. Did he die and revert to iron man?
---
Swampletics. A YouTube series started by Settled where he is an ultimate Ironman that only operates in morytania. I recently binged all current episodes and I would say it's really entertaining and the anticipation for the next episode is like waiting for the package when you get shipping details.
---
What kind of lube should i put in my ass since pures are going to get fucked hard with a hard diary req?

Did you make the original black graceful recolor as well?

Currently it opporates different than both other shields. Wyverns special attack should recharge the shield.
---
Can we be able to keep previous tiers of diary rewards? Had a discussion with Mod Ash about it.
---
https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/1092828863716036608?s=21
---
Had a conversation with ash about allowing players to keep previous tiers of diary items by "disenchanting" or making previous tiers' effects "inactive" so that only the current tier has the active abilities (to avoid abuse of teleports and abilities of such). The conversation should explain everything. Ash said this is something that could be done, wanted to see what you think and if you could discuss it on the next Q and A. Let me know if you have any questions. I’d be more than happy to discuss it further with you.

Only makes sense, you have to enter your bank pin to access the GE anyway.

Devalues my nostalgia of having to run around the wall.

How is it easier to post to reddit than googling?

Such nostalgia...talking to my friends all day about how I could finally afford Black armour then being jealous that they had Mithril.
---
Then getting home and playing on dial-up. I'll never get the time back but I don't regret it. Ironically it taught me skills about money management that I don't think children these days get.

1st thing I did! (after flexing it on here of course!) :)
---
He was aggro'd onto the guy in the corner, but got caught and safespotted on the crystal. The update that made it harder for him to reset increased his tolerance of not being able to hit his target so he stayed there a few seconds longer than you might be used to before resetting!

&gt;QoL Month Poll: Re-runs
---
&gt;It's time for our third week of QoL month - Re-runs! This part of QoL month
---
well yeah there will always be people who's password is "password" :P there's basically a few ways to do it (assuming the hashes aren't salted). You can have a big old dictionary and a set of "rules" for example "dog" from the dictionary and "add 1" to the word being one of the rules so it'd check "dog" and "dog1". or 0's for o's etc.
---
 There's also the brute force method where you can set something called a "mask" for example my brand of router only allowed lower case characters and it has to be 8 letters long, so knowing that....you'd ask the program to check every combination of 8 character lowercase passwords using ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l   aaaaaaaa aaaaaaab etc.
---
which is basically "26 letters" to the power of the length of the password or 26\^8 = 208827064576 but if you add in uppercase and numbers then suddenly it's 26 lower case, 26 uppercase and 10 numbers ( 62\^8 = 218340105584896) and then you can add in special characters which is something like 95\^8 and it gets even more difficult.
---
Combinatorics is a cruel thing though and I'm not the best at maths.
---
People also use the password creating method of "5 random dictionary words" for example: horse cage poker tree pitchfork  and according to the first google search the uk dictionary contains 171,476 words and 5 random words would make it 171476\^5 = 148257516582242625049957376 combinations and makes the password a lot more feasible to remember (but also has the downside that people use that same password a lot, and some places still store passwords in plain text ruining it).
---
Ultimate Iron Man mode and Hardcore Iron Man mode are separate. Only Hardcore Ironmen lose their status and revert to regular Ironmen on death. Swampletics is an UIM so deaths don't matter for him. Technically, deaths actually help him at times because it allows him to "bank" items in various death storage places (such as Zulrah or Vorkath, but obviously neither of those are in Morytania so Swampletics won't be using those 2 options).
---
Playing Apex Legends getting frustrated then watching a movie while I woodcut.
---
You say all this as if slayer and bosses like Vorkath don't print money in RS. You can earn a bond in one hour of efficient vorkath on average. You aren't making a WoW token in an hour with the same level of effort.
---
It’s really bad! I hope it is just temporary, but it seems like a big enough problem it should be looked at.
---
🅱️ claws
---
Ah, right. As a uim can I downgrade to hcim?
---
He attac, He protec, but most of all he stretched out to hec
---
you good my dude?
---
All of them. Plus harvesting berries/cacti/fruit are also profitable. There's actually plenty of ways to make money farming. 
---
This is dependant on yield, I reguarly only get 6 snapdragons using ultracompost and magic secateurs at 72 farming, which means I lose like 10k over selling the seed
---
And also he is snec
---
Lol I just did this quest like a day ago, that cracked me up as well.
---
"What the fuck, i ate!"
---
No you dunce. Skilling QOL was last week. This week is re-runs. 
---
Divine was polled and nearly passed a long time ago, so it's a "re-run". 
---
Totally. Underwood’s character is so devious that he pulls all this shit off while somehow making the audience still root for him (at least until the last season, but the plot seemed to drop off a bit there).
---
With tbow, I know prayer is preferred. With blowpipe, since it's a bit less accurate, people may bring the ranged bonus?
---
Put your name on the in game model if you're so worried about losing credit /s
---
Great recolor I guess
---
Same! The number of friends I have online went from one to about 5. It seems like mobile brought back a lot of my old RS friends. They all have memberships now and are alone daily. What a time to be alive!
---
Mod Gambit, please answer this. You realize by "nerfing" the proposed sandstone update, you've put high level ironman crafters at an even bigger disadvantage against those few who used the overlooked sandstone method to get 24k buckets per hour?
---
How in the world are we supposed to catch up to them now?
---
This is hardly wilderness rejuvenation. Just reads off like you're mad you die at revs.
---
&gt; only exception I can think of is the Spear and Hasta, the latter is behind the barbarian training
---
Spear, claws, warhammer, 2h, sword, axe, pick, harpoon, cane has dragon in it's name so I count it too.

Hasta requires tai bwo wannai trio.

---
Good.  Meme. 
---
You Level multiple skills while making good profit in the long run.
---
It's kinda sad actually that most people just straight up lie about their WoW experience on other subs hoping for that sweet karma.
---
Thinking there is any inherently flawed way of playing RS is just completely flawed thinking.
---
This game is about as sandbox as MMOs get. You can play however the hell you feel like it.
---
People like settled because it's fun watching him challenge himself.
---
The fury of mod ash
---
Y'all realise that you don't even need to beg to be given money, there are a tonne of people in OSRS that have given me money just because I said nice things to them... it's those damn rich people being too benevolent.
---
You cannot go from UIM to HCIM, but I believe you can go from UIM to regular IM. HCIM is a single decision made on Tutorial Island.
---
i meant it teles you into a part that's not wildy I couldn't remember what it's called haven't played in very long. back when I played you could pay for a private session with the boss, idk if that's considered an instance 
---
It happens relatively frequently if you're banging out random "10 minutes per quest point" quests for RFD. That's when I noticed it a bunch of times, and haven't really noticed it before or since.
---
hahaha... I was thinking the same thing! I liked the fire cape tho
---
It’s titled re run in the headline and skilling in the actual post you brainlet
---
And this actually marks the fourth time they’ve tried to shove divine down our throats and it will just fail again 
---
Oh man i'm hyped for almost all of these changes. Spellbook/prayer changes are much, MUCH needed. And the special attack icon is awesome. Only one i'm unsure of is the wilderness ditch change.
---
As a side note, it's absolutely retarded that most of these changes won't be allowed in PvP. Makes the game feel inconsistent, and makes PvP feel outdated. But then again, PvP in this game is boring af braindead nonsense so what do i care.
---
For reals. There's no reason to not add the divine. Its got better damage reduction than ely at the cost of prayer. It was balanced back in 2007 and would still be balanced in this game. 
---
Just an example of its balance is that people wouldn't use it in the Inferno because of how much prayer they would lose.
---
ok real talk there's actually a method to this god awful shit that i figured out but haven't seen mentioned anywhere, which got me like 89k xp/hr at a level the wiki said i should get 68-72k xp/hr. You need hella staminas, and there're three spawns of the dark little fucks on the south west side, you run between them, making sure you're standing next to them as they spawn and instantly throwing the bird, if they start moving you'll fail 80% of the time, but as long as they're standing still you'll always catch them, and being one square away cuts out how fuckin slow it takes for you to grab the bird again once it's caught something
---
This guy probably also tells people their parents should die in front of them, or is the typical sit retard guy.
---
It's also called QOL week
---
Divine spirit shield
---
Quality of Life
---
Ah yes, the JageX we know.
---
Get RC too 96, and you profit if you're worried about loss (y)
---
ty for the reminder of how much I love theory of finance. I have to start reading again.
---
This is a poll that repolls failed questions. The divine failed a poll and they're repelling which is fine.
---
It's still QoL **month**, as it says in the title and all over the blog, it would be reasonable to assume that meant the repolls would be of QoL features and not a new boss drop out of nowhere
---
I think the title is wrong, the subtitle is "re-polls" and also none of the other suggestions are skilling related either lol.
---
You dont read. This is quality of life reruns. Divine spirit shield isnt quality of life.
---
what you mean? a 500m and a 120m drop isn't enough? LMFAO
---
I bet you had a different opinion on buffing sandstone
---
&gt; Poll Question #4
---
Should a small miniquest be added to retire Hatius Cosaintus? If this question passes, his functionality would be moved to Gee, one of the farmers found wandering around Lumbridge.
---
lemme chop his head off and take his hat ty
---
D claws failed a poll twice before being passed. Lets get the divine back in the same way. Corp hype.
---
99 rc before fletch? Jesus
---
But what I mean is, doesn't that one guy who makes his password 'password' ruin it the security for everybody?
---
If I understand correctly the process would be like this:
---
'password' -&gt; hashing algorithm -&gt; 128 bit string
---
Take a rainbow table of common passwords run through common algorithms -&gt; that same 128 bit string occurs and shows the plain text password 'password'
---
Now that you know the maths used to hash the database, you can run it in reverse and get all the plain text passwords.
---
That may not be how it works, its just what I've gathered from what I know on the topic.
---
Why is it necessary to show that, why would I lie?
---
Wadu
---
Give "Unique CC" a try. Lots of great people who like to chat.
---
I will vote no to literally any more content requiring me to skill scorpia or Ben. No thanks.

Meta has changed, you're right in not using void.
---
Waaaaduuuuuu
---
I’m against this because I would put in a typo and there goes my whole bank. 
---
Almost all of these are severely needed improvements, wtf in here "worries you"? Like the only things i could see being a problem here are the shield and wilderness ditch changes.
---
No, its called quality of life reruns.  
---
&gt; It's time for our third week of QoL month - Re-runs! This part of QoL month

I really dont get how people can assign a solid xp/hr figure to Slayer, its sooooo RNG dependant on tasks, sometimes I get maybe 10k xp in an hour if I get multiple shit tasks
---
&gt;RS content creators have run out of ideas so they do shit like this
---
So...new ideas for content, like a region locked UIM, is running out of ideas...?

You're overheating. You need to set a power threshold to reduce the heat. 
---
* Right click the Start menu and select Control Panel.
---
* Click Hardware and Sound.
---
* Select Power Options.
---
* Find Processor power management and open the menu for Minimum processor state.
---
* Change the setting for on battery to 30-50%
---
* Change the setting for plugged in to 30-50%
---
Youll have to undo it to run normal applications again at regular speeds. 30% should be plenty to get 30 fps out of runelite.
---
But RNGesus

You better have picked up those fire runes boi.

thats her hands tho?

That does not matter in the slightest, it is still QOL month as the title suggests;
---
&gt; QoL Month Poll: Re-runs
---
Ty sir, appreciate it
---
Tag him with a 1 + ring of suffering. Exactly.
---
"enjoy your mute bro, much love"
---
the only poll they were on before the one that passed was to add them just to DMM
---
Yeah the private portals are instances. Instances are zones where other players are unable to see you. You get your own instanced zone.
---
But kbd can be uninstanced as well
---
Requires 6 Hydra leather

Ao lucky :O

Vorkath's head AND visage, nice loot!
---
Lol no need for an herb clock, just set a timer for 85 minutes and you’ll be fine. 
---
Yep 
---
Can we change the attack speed of the Seercull so it is in line with the Magic Shortbow? Sure the Seercull is a meme but it'd be an actually decently useful and fun weapon if it just had the same attack speed. It even has the same level requirement and accuracy bonus, and its spec is arguably less useful than MSB (super restores/mage pots are already prolific in PKing), so I don't see any reason it has to stay dead content.
---
&gt;Should a small miniquest be added to retire Hatius Cosaintus? If this question passes, his functionality would be moved to Gee, one of the farmers found wandering around Lumbridge.
---
The fuck? People want to poll removing him altogether, not create a whole new miniquest around him. Who comes up with this shit? 
---
I like the meme videos about this guy. Can anyone shoot me a link to a video lol
---
&gt; 1) Having readily available calculators is an extremely recent development in human history and education is still catching up
---
So why did we use calculators in 7th grade, 10 years ago. But they don't use calculators in first grade now?
---
Ok cool, its still **week** 3 of the QOL month, making it a QOL week. That is however super irrelevant to what I'm asking, why is Divine being polled as a QOL?
---
Meh I was busy, this is youtube not a business or anything. 
---
There was a dude scavenging and got them so they didnt go to waste. I was so excited for a DD task then i saw smoke dungeon..the fuck konar. Oh well. Time to frolick with duradel now 
---
This is what happens when a pvmer suggests pvp update 
---
What colorblind person thinks the D defender is pink?
---
"Easyscape though"
---
-RS3 Brainlets
---
It's repolls week fam, chill tf out
---
Some of these things (ex divine) have failed up to 3 times already and are clearly not wanted. The worrying part is Jagex trying to shove content down the throat of the community when we don’t want it.
---
how many months did it take her?
---
Yeah tell her it's not like holding a dick..
---
Why are you responding to me, lol
---
Flush it on down with the rest of your poo then. 
---
no
---
The majority of us don't, that's the point of offering an alternative.
---
&gt;These numbers are based on mining and subsequently depositing the ore to the machine while not dropping lower valued Sandstone. It will not be possible to deposit noted Sandstone though it would be possible to run pre-banked Sandstone back and forth from the Quarry - however, Drew's location does not make this a particularly efficient process.
---
We looked into the numbers behind and found that actually very few players used this method to obtain large amounts of sandstone. The issue was fixed within a few hours - we hope that the location of the machine (as mentioned in the news post) should make this banked sandstone less efficient than it may have been were we to add a Sandstorm spell. 
---
It failed once before, it will fail once again.
---
It showed up as a response to my comment, idk why. My apologies.
---
I think that having no type of defense is probably the point of that particular game design decision.
---
Lol
---
well GL, I went 3000 points dry on a Hydra task :)
---
Starting a petition to let us marry waifu Elena.
---
Jagex have no fucking backbone. Just because 16.5% of the community voice their opinions they withdraw an update. If you give a fuck about the strength, just reduce the amount of buckets the sandstone gives.....
---
Runecraft
---
“Trying to control free speech” 
---
Lmao god that’s a stupid thing to say 
---
not to mention you need 99 mining and have to 3t in order for it to be better than charter ships lmao
---
dead content
---
Are you in the zamorak encampment or just I  the center where you climb down to?
---
They already have skips and blocks. Plenty of ways to do less slayer tasks that you don't wanna do. 
---
This has layers, I like it
---
This has been a trend for a couple months max, sounds like a new idea to me? More interesting than watching you run bones for coins to make back the money you lose to pkers at green drags.
---
Got 2 picks before pet at 47
---
It will be like the farming guild doors.
---
cons :ezscape
---
Not even close. Droprate is 1/8 or 1/10 with no deaths so it’s around 40 for an item in your name assuming 4 man raids which is by far the most popular group size and is most efficient generally.
---
fairy tale part 1, starting fairy tail part 2 are the most important things an account needs to have done. You have NO requirements for fairy tale part 2 except to finish so get the bonus and get out.
---
Delete this bot.
---
They must not enjoy the game enough to be botting so he's doing them a favor
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Do you know what a flip phone is
---
same, i am saving up cash to pay for my construction grind at the moment but it's taking so long to get the cash when you're not already a high-level endgame player
---
This id just the typical respons to everything regarding pures or skillers.
---
Adding new content with req. not doable for a lvl 3 is not "limiting themself by choice". I don't think that 'hiding' 1 color of graceful is fair if all others are not hidden behind combat. Be reasonable, don't just throw that argument out there for the sake of it.
---
Didn't they leave this out of the re-make for a reason?
---
The community is dumb and if they're too dumb to make decisions that are good for the game, they deserve to have their voices ignored, see: Should we remove 6hr AFK?
---
Exactly, voting is broken because people who have never played IM are allowed to vote in a fucking sand bucket poll.
---
I like the special attack suggestion.  I understand why it shouldnt be in PvP but it'd be a nice QoL for PvM.
---
The ditch is unsightly and there would still be a warning before entering the wilderness.
---
Just tell them to get fucked. Anyone dumb enough to fall for this shit deserves it. 
---
Considering they're case insensitive, probably. 
---
Hm is that costing you and how much do/hr?
---
During that part I always just watched the video until he got to a safe spot, paused it until I got myself to that safespot, and worked my way through the platform like that. Only got caught once, and that was at that tricky part right at the end.
---
Have used bots on an alt in the past. I don't have a problem with someone resource gathering on an alt, but bot farms piss me off. I wish Jagex would ban data centers and offending IPs of bot farms. 
---
Slayer really doesn't need any more buffs
---
literally struggling with gp between smithing and construction lmao
---
thieving, slayer, vorkath, hydra, zulrah (granted a little less since nerf)
---
People you need to die irl
---
..or maybe they don't enjoy sitting in NMZ doing nothing for 6 hours a day and instead enjoy PVMing or PKing? 
---
thank you
---
Wow bro. Wow. 😂😂😂 someone get their mans
---
I don't know how you manage to be so hurt every time I see you comment, but you need therapy dude.
---
85? Alright. Thanks for the tip.
---
Why? It's pretty easy especially with Ifixit website you cant get lost. Thermal paste is 6 bucks, I dont see why not.
---
Mr Snek don't feel so good
---
They don't repoll very often. I think the last Rerun poll (previously called Near-Miss) was in like 2016 or something like that. I do agree that reoffering until it passes isn't good, but at the same time just because something fails doesn't mean the entire idea should be scrapped forever. If they polled a lot of stuff in 2013 it would have failed; Grimy Herbs was something that did fail back then. But the community's opinions do change over time, both as players come and go and players become more or less accepting of certain things. So if there is still strong interest in an update, players should get a chance to vote on it again instead of just pointing back to a 4 year old poll.
---
As for the sand thing, other things have been scrapped before too. Personally, I think they may have scaled it back more than needed, but I think it is good that they stop and reconsider when something doesn't seem right instead of pushing it out anyway. Sometimes things sound fine in the concept stage, so they poll it but then when they go to Dev or QA it they realize it wasn't balanced as polled, so they change it. If they did release it as polled, it would likely have gotten a post-release nerf instead, which is well within their right for balancing, so better to just address it now.
---
Good fuck ironmen
---
I’m the opposite. I usually can’t sit through a movie or a tv show without something else to do. I’ve caught myself watching a movie on one monitor, playing hearthstone on the other and scrolling through reddit on my phone all at once.
---
Devalues my iron, man.
---
If you are in the main are right as you go down the rope, you need to have a piece of armor from Zammy, sara, armadyl, and bandos. 
---
Maybe like zammy d'hide chaps, sara dhide top, amradyl coif, bandos d'hide boots would work. Or maybe switch it up and throw a god book in there to replace a piece or a blessing.
---
Also, if you have 70 str, go to the North East corner and jump over the bridge to get to the zammy area boss room, where you would collect kill count for Zammy, and there I believe there is only zammy monsters, so you zammy platelegs would suffice. However bring a stamina potion and a super restore potion, as when you jump off the bridge to swim across to the zammy area it drains all your stats very low.  
---
Man I got back in last winter (so over a year ago) played the absolute shit out of it for like 3 months then gave up again, but Graceful was one of the first things I did. And I fucking hated it, but I’m back again slowly questing 
---
I agree with this so much, doing some boss’ that require you to switch prayers is the biggest pain, so many times iv died where I have to eat and switch prayer at the same time n I don’t do it fast enough
---
The divine just getting polled on a short and probably low participation timeframe is pretty worrying to me. **If you didn't check it this poll lasts 4 days...** I'm not against adding it per say but it would be a pretty large change and could shift the meta on some things. I just thing it should be polled over the period of at least two weeks and have it be the centerpiece of the poll if they do it.
---
A lot of the changes they are suggesting are only outside of PvP (question 2,5,6,10) which I feel in general this is bad for the game and will only widen the gap for people to get into PvP. It made sense for something like autocast for staves but now it seems like they are just going to use it for everything. I am also kind of worried this will lead to armors and weapons having different stats in PvM/PvP (I know the bp already does but that kind of a special situation).
---
Bc there are only 15 mods and 200k accounts.
---
Don’t we all?
---
So if the poll suggested spell changes were implemented, you wouldn't do crafting that way?
---
Can we get clarification on how decisions are made to make unpolled balance changes while other similar changes are polled? For example the void/zulrah nerfs were not polled but nerfing gmaul or buffing entangles are polled.
---
Oo boy time for my arms big adventure 
---
Something the world doesn't deserve. 
---
Teleport in POH is so worth it you won't look back.
---
Not as much, but it was still pretty great. I watched most of the latter half. 
---
But how many extra doritos can you eat without having to click one more time after you complete the obstacle. Max out your render distance you can easily eat three or four more doritos my man. 
---
Suggle &gt; Slayermusiq
---
\&gt;The ditch is unsightly
---
That's your opinion. I think it looks great.
---
How can it keep track of loot?
---
It's kind of like when you kill a boss and get a sapphire
---
Because it is way too much, I need 50k buckets just to get 87 crafting on my ironman, I also need to buy those 50k buckets as well as enough runes to glassmake them all.
---
I know you are a very destructive person. Good thing im not an ironman so I wont be affected by normies doing anything they can to destroy the game in order to make it easier for themselves. Proceed!
---
East? I thought you said Weast
---
Who’s disagreeing with the majority?
---
While that may seem like a crazy theory, it is probably a factor. Not to say they won't do it because of it, but it is part of the reason they are taking time to look into it rather than just rushing it out. If hiding the results does lead to more things failing, that would be bad for business. Though it probably wouldn't be that extreme of an impact.
---
Silver jewelers literally does this
---
Chill out? I thought it was funny lol. Idgaf either way
---
Rs3 noob - correct me if im wrong
---
Is that a farming pet or a boss pet? I dont know osrs pets beyond the agility squirrel, the theiv racc, and the chaos elemental
---
i just have visited oldschool.runescape.wiki so often that chrome autofills when i tupe in o, so I can just do o-tab search
---
If they hid poll results jagex could just pretend things passed that didn’t and no one would no. I really don’t think they’re trying to force content into the game though.
---
LOL Lets not forget that Jagex doesn't have to Poll anything. We are an extremely lucky community to even have the power to vote at all. That is definitely not the reason they are not hidden, imo.
---
A miniquest also fundamentally undermines the entire desire to get rid of him. For a miniquest to exist, he presumably has to keep existing until the player starts it to then usher off his responsibilities to his replacement. Which means there he continues lurking in Lummy, for all new players to see. He’s a nasty out of place eyesore - it absolutely *would* be better to just remove him &amp; act like he was never there. In fact, IMO that’s the only thing that should be considered. 
---
Damn sorry for enjoying a youtube series
---
literally got my first iasor on kc 18, am 21 atm with plenty of attas and kronos
---
So there's going to be a guy standing in the middle of the desert, surrounded by sand, with a machine used to make *more sand*?
---
I get the concerns about balancing the sandstone process but this seems like a little too Runescape even for Runescape.
---
Will this new version of sandstone crafting be polled? Personally, I'd rather just forget the whole thing than have what's currently suggested.
---
Money laundering?
---
"Please help me"
---
nah, the real noob is you not knowing that it helps!
---
I'm so glad the female Armadyl helmet is being polled. Thing looks like a chicken nugget right now.
---
&gt; And you know very well QoL Month doesn't mean every question is QoL.
---
Yeah I know they dont understand what quality of life entices or what it means. Thats why they should be criticized for failing to understand this.
---
Good try
---

...They could be rigging the polls right now and you wouldn't know.

Not a fan of Pink Floyd references, eh.

His entire post history is calling people lonely skinny virgins. If I had to guess, OP is a lonely skinny virgin.
---
You want qol month to be like any other month, I got you. Push for that instead.
---
Its not hypocritical to do the method if u were against it in the first place. U can still think it shouldnt be in the game.
---
Lol those names are amazing, but we already have the bracelets that when worn will either extend a task by not counting the kill or will reduce the task by counting it twice.

A lil sexual abuse..ezpz problem solved

Did you know a bear can decapitate a full grown moose with a single swipe of the paw?

SWAMPLETICS GOOD

Fuck irons. Game shouldn't revolve around them anyways. It's an mmo for a reason
---
u have been absolutely smorced my friend!
---
&gt; Thats a fair point but you also lose out on ores you could have mined for that xp. Every upside has a downside and vice versa.
---
I don't think that's a fair way to think about it. That's like saying if I do lava runes, I miss out on the nature runes I could have gotten from gaining 70k rc xp/h. 
---
The most fair way of thinking of it is currently: Gain sand and no xp. After the update: Gain sand + mining xp.
---
I never done 07 raids :/
---
You can kill shades in mortanya which are a much lower level than the ones in the kourned catacombs
---
Somewhat rare
---
I hate the idea of a lot of these changes not affecting PVP areas. I assume it includes the wilderness, so any PVM content in those areas will be subject to the PVP restrictions. It makes it feel like 2 slightly different games while also attempting to remove the actual border between them (should the ditch removal pass). Walk slightly too far north and your autocasts all reset etc.
---
It makes the PVP community at large seem unable to accept any changes to the current gameplay flow of PVP, and the fact that you'll need to learn a bunch of mechanics changes between the two modes means that it's going to be harder to attempt PVP casually. In these cases it's not even mechanics, it's how you interact with the client entirely.
---
Increasing the divide between the two modes doesn't seem like a good direction to me, and is almost at odds with the entire idea of the wilderness area.
---
&gt; Just cause he's ugly?
---
Yup. 
---
Except for the fact that if they really want something in the game, they just add it without a poll. Where was the dryanor docks? They don't really mind ststuff failing polls, because if they really really wanted it, they would just add it
---
Slayer
---
Good PVMers. Still 500m buddy. 
---
Most "WEALTHY" PvMers. 
---
It nearly passed a poll to be remove. Just didn't quite make the 75% threshold. 
---
&gt; Taking him out of the game without any lore is even worse than just keeping him there
---
Lol what? He was added with no lore in the first place strutting around Lumbridge wearing armour from 2 ages ago with no reasonable context as to how he got it, he looks ugly and tacky as hell, and we should treat him like the developer who created him: force him out and avoid questions related to him on the QnA like it's a family member who went to prison. 
---
P
---
 If I got a blue dragon task and wanted to do it at Vorkath, what would be the best gear setup to use if I don't have arma? I know that void is the best off task but with the slayer helm, what else should I use?
---
Make a main
---
Because everyone's gonna be running around with a 1b shield in PvP worlds
---
Can you stupid fucks learn to read the damn titles?  It's repolling shit that failed by less than 1% over the years.
---
What? Most good pvmers have multi billion gp banks 
---
Hope u dc
---
Okay thanks for your answer, do you know where in Mortanya?
---
RUNECRAFT BAD
---
You need piece from each god. Zammy sara arma bandos
---
Sounds like a lot of effort lmao, I dont care about EHP so ill stick to duradel
---
&gt; A lot of these updates arent "low effort" they are game changing.
---
To make it more clear for you:
---
low effort and game changing are not mutually exclusive.
---
Also you dont need to quote your entire post again we already know the doctor dropped you on your head when you were born.
---
Thanks alot for the answer, will probably do this!
---
Pretty much best in slot for feet ranged bonus.
---
It does sound fun! I know I'm a noob for this but I did enjoy using the LFR feature because I didn't really have a desire to do raiding but I tried out LFR and really enjoyed myself believe it or not. It made me want to do raids at a harder difficulty but this was late into Legion so most guilds weren't looking for anyone so I said I would wait for BFA but I'm back to playing OSRS now. I'd like to get into high level raiding at one point though, I still enjoy the collection stuff on WoW as well though. :) 
---
When you have a player-base that is as compartmentalized into cliques as OSRS’ is you’re bound to have backlash, from one group or another, regardless of what you poll. It passed and I’m sure some IM players voted for it to improve the meta of their own gameplay but there were very obviously enough in that section of the community that weren’t having it. I get that Jagex goofs sometimes but this is one case where the blame lies with the player-base itself. 
---
I guess we’ll have to disagree then because that is exactly how i, and many others, see it. I can do nats and miss out on faster xp or do lavas and miss out of profit. I don’t know anyone that doesn’t look at it that way actually. Other than you, that is.
---
300-500% buff to sand? buff in what sense? You say its bad for integrity but I'm struggling to see how?
---
1. Its not exactly easy to access as im pretty sure its planned to be a lunar spell
---
2. Many other stats have similar training methods which are 300-500% quicker than other methods (grapes) 
---
In all honesty I couldn't care either way, but Jagex's track record lately regarding polls and updates has been shocking. and it's fastly becoming a very grey area. Like people have mentioned below, what's the point in polls if either way Jagex can turn round and decided on the opposite outcome. THAT is not heathly for the game.
---
Yeah morton shades are only cb level 40 and more slayer xp i believe 
---
"they are already way ahead" you fucknut thats the exact reason every fucking buff is passing because ur sorry ass wants to do the same that others have done in fraction of time... time to go ahead and cry a little bit more dumwit
---
I've got 3 points on my comment?
---
That 5xp/h more is welcome buff. I might get 99 before grave!
---
who would down vote this, heretics
---
This is the most "let them eat cake" response I've ever seen. 
---
Thanks for the input! As for the number of attempts, I honestly couldn't tell you as I didn't count
---
You have been smorcinsoned!
---
Than why doesn’t he go to pking or pvm?
---
good, fuck all you pussies 
---
That would actually be really nice 
---
what do you mean ? we didnt even want this lmfao
---
Everyone who answered u is straight up wrong. He was already polled to be removed but it failed. 
---
A simple correction of an honest mistake is better
---
Must be w362... that's my friend. 
---
There is always slayer to train your combat actively. 
---
Desert treasure and it made me laugh my ass off while doing the quest. 
---
So now they just straight up disregard poll results. Wonderful.
---
“QoL”
---
Morton with an apostrophe in there.
---
Buy a barrows teleport from Grand exchange and run west from there.
---
Yet its in a ‘QOL’ month......................
---
Do you really think the pvp community is large enough or in jagex's ear enough to hold polls hostage? And you think that their opposition is because they want to pick on noobs, not because they want to preserve one of the few skill-based aspects of the game as much as possible? The only demands in terms of mechanical ability in any aspect of this game are mouse accuracy, clicking speed, and timing actions on the correct game ticks. Relatively few activities require even one of these, so if you don't like these requirements, do something else instead of dumbing down activities that do.
---
Asking for these changes to make pvp easier is like asking for 3-point line to be moved closer in NBA games because it will let average people compete in the NBA (it won't). It won't let bad pkers suddenly compete, but it will devalue an important skill that helps distinguish the best pkers. Just like there are lower levels of basketball where you can hone your skills, there are lower levels of pking where you can practice without spellbook icons/mouse accuracy being as much of an issue (f2p/BH/ge on pvp worlds). 
---
I think it's also quite hypocritical of you to accuse the PvP community of throwing hissy fits when this subreddit did just that when that poll didn't go the way the majority of them wanted, spite voting other pvp-related polls and constantly clamoring for a repoll.
---
Sorry dude but I got you beat.

How do you know 4 hours? I was talking to him just now too.

Same problem, forced to play on US worlds because they're "only" 160 ping compared to my region 330+ ping...
---
You're missing my point. Without the ditch, you can easily just walk back and forth between wildy and non-wildy, which can lead to underhanded pvp practices. With the ditch, you have to perform an animation every time, reducing the ability to juke people by running in and out.
---
Mort'ton just north of burgh de rott. They can be safe spotted using magic or range around the west most broken building
---
Oof, you seem a little upset. Someone need a juice break?
---
Wow that’s a load of shit, that grinding machine + NPC sound horrible. 
---
Rs3’s engine is not worth the hassle it would take to transition across, they would be better off starting from the ground up.
---
Stop expecting easy gains at a low level then.
---
Thanks a lot!!
---
Like I said it is good that they stop and reconsider when something doesn't seem right instead of pushing it out anyway. Sometimes things sound fine in the concept stage, so they poll it but then when they go to Dev or QA it they realize it wasn't balanced as polled, so they change it. If they did release it as polled, it would likely have gotten a post-release nerf instead, which is well within their right for balancing, so better to just address it now. And if they realized it sooner, they likely wouldn't have even polled it.

thank you very much! osrs society is rly nice

i was skeptical, thought it wouldn’t be interesting at all but i watched the first one and immediately binged the rest of the series, and i don’t watch youtube casually, i only look up videos when i need a guide or something specific 
---
It sure as fuck would make the chaos alter a complete joke, unless youet 6 man teamed on at once, and would also be amazing at escaping revs. There's plenty of reasons to visit the wildy and not skull
---
K thanks, bai
---
Tbf the things he listed make the game way easier. I’d rather someone give me constructive criticism like that, better than saying nothing 
---
I dunno, there sure seems to be plenty of noobs around since the release of mobile. It's not like 2006, but they do exist.
---
I'll probably vote yes because the ditch is weird and I think a warning will be just as good in terms of keeping noobs safe.
---
pvp update so no
---
I do a lot of pvm, but I can't think of a place for it, I'm sure the top pvmers will know what to do with it. It runs the risk of being another spectral...

Oh and the roughly 100 hours of actually blowing the glass.

Just stop.  You have no clue what you are speaking of.

Look, the underhand PVP practices are going to be minimal. Barely anyone hangs around the border unless they are looking to PVP themselves.

Got that 200JagexIQ

They might have misheard 1/80 as 1/180 possibly? 1/180 seems closer to the drop rate.

Elysian is better than divine on old school. Sure the effect is stronger. But without prayer points the effect doesn't work, and the only places where ely is currently used are Inferno and armadyl gwd, both places where prayer is more crusial than health
---
&gt;Questing to use NMZ instead of sandcrabbing to 85cmb

 smh kids these days

Why bother to poll something if you don't care what the community wants?
---
As soon as the poll blog went live, people started testing the method and saw that it was 3-4 times faster than collecting sand, which was acceptable to players when they voted for it.
---
This isn't a case of something being polled, released and then discovering that it was OP, in which case a Nerf is appropriate; the rates were well known while the poll was active. 
---
What has changed since the poll blog went up? Did you just not bother testing the method before putting it online?
---
Why not just reduce the rates from sandstone by ~half, so that you get slightly more sand/hr than buckets, without making crafting a huge gold sink. At least this way, the players who relied on the poll having passed aren't penalized for already having mine sandstone. 
---

---
Its hard to laugh about the idiots when you know that scumbag is making bank, i'd rather laugh at him losing an account with 1.5b+ on it.
---
It's hardly any less fair than requiring a 75% vote to remove something that wasn't polled in the first place, and has never historically been popular.
---
Literally couldn’t understand that either, Jagex has to add a gold sink to EVERYTHING
---
Damn can I upvote this twice
---
What? It is quite obviously pink when you look at the model.
---
Fake and gay
---
Jagex reserve the final say. They didn't outright remove the update, they reworked it in favour of integrity. They've outlined in reasonable detail what you should expect from the update, and they've made it so that the update will still have an impact on the rate at which you can collect buckets of sand.
---
I like to bring dwh and ring of suffering RI but that is probably meta
---
If you're right I've been sperging out for no reason, I hope that's true lol
---
Yes, I have all the item rewards.
---
i got d spear from steel drags (1/111k). tilted me a bit
---
It’s more important to downvote bad info than it is to protect someone’s imaginary internet points 
---
what if i have unlimited membership for winning king of the skill though? 
---
&gt; **Why 100 coins per Bucket of Sand?**
---
100k buckets is only 10m, that's really not a lot (effectively 0.82 gp/xp with 3:18 superglass and making dorge orbs)
---
Ok so give me a reason to put through the divine. I shouldnt be giving reasons as to why not. You give me reasons as to **why**.
---
Honestly I have no issue with this slight change other than the cost of making buckets of sand. If I need to collect 40,000 buckets of sand I would be spending 4m on top of spending the time mining to get the sand, it has no use being that expensive
---
\&gt;I, like many of the people here, played back before the ditch was introduced
---
Same.
---
\&gt;don't know anyone who was lured due to a lack of a ditch.
---
There's dozens of videos on youtube of it being done. Just because you don't personally know anyone doesn't mean it's not an issue. 
---
\&gt;It may prevent a tiny number of people from making a stupid mistake.
---
Or the massive influx of new players, but again, not the main issue.
---
\&gt;But everyone has to live with how it damages the map and ruins immersion.
---
I don't see how a ditch that separates the one place in the map that you can get killed by other players is immersion breaking. Separating a dangerous area from a non dangerous area is one of the main uses of ditches. I don't see how it ruins immersion at all. It's a ditch, similar to ditches elsewhere in the game, but this one you can click on.
---
\&gt;Moreover the game is much, much safer than it used to be due to the changes in death mechanics in PvM.
---
But those done apply to pvp, so this point is irrelevant.
---
\&gt;Having a small amount of peril makes the game much more fun and immersive.
---
But not if that peril is due to the predatory practices of other players. There's nothing "fun and immersive" about someone abusing mechanics to kill you.
---
Kinda strange that the new npc will be called gee seem early
---
This isn't gonna work again dude
---
You're absolutely right. I have some very simple thought experiments:
---
"If X was released back in Y, would it have been popular?" (If this newly released X was released in year Y, would X be popular?)
---
"If Z was released today, would it be popular?"
---
I can almost certainly say, that if Hatius was released in 2004 or 2005 or some shit, he wouldn't be disliked (and actually this is the first time I see hate against him). I think it's cool to have a fully geared out character in the beginning area. But any quests/miniquests added to the game can only be good.
---
It got nerfed? How badly?
---
Slayer makes grinding combat skills bearable for me
---
I will upvote your post, but fuck your comment bro sorry
---
If I’m soloing Rex I can stay there indefinitely with Gotham’s and alchs (more profit, less afk) or blood barrage and no alchs. I’ll be doing it later and I can show you the ropes in about 5 hours if you add me in game and just message me. My RSN is Hntrguy.

GOGO POWER RANGERS

I mean, this guy is using the triple parenthesis. What do you expect? 
---
Black demons are amazing xp... just get a arclight and pray melee afk. I've been at konar been getting great xp and have made 2 mil from 6 keys. So it's well worth it over nieve imo. I have the skotizo pet and dont really care for totems and I find konar is better money in the long run than skotizo.
---
Stop furthering the divide between PvP and PvM. The mechanics should be the same across the board, regardless of whether you are doing one or the other.
---
People accustomed to new PvM setups, should the polls pass, will be discouraged from doing PvP where they cannot use said setups.
---
New method was still like 20 hours slower than charters or vorkath.  Stop using that phrase for everything you don't like.
---
First of all, 20m (+ maybe 2m for rune and bucket costs) is an extremely reasonable cost for 99 crafting considering it unlocks 4 bis jewelry items and the best bank teleport in the game. So the cost associated is already quite reasonable.
---
Second, your comparisons aren't accurate because while using more essence for rc or using and spinning more bowstrings for fletching would impact how long it takes to train these skills, using more gp would have no effect on the rate of training crafting. If the speed was the exact same for those skills even with the higher resource demand then for ironman at least there would be no difference and the cost increase wouldn't be an issue.
---
The sandstone update which passed the poll was definitely better than the bucket method by miles but I really dont see a problem with it.  It doesnt need to be hell on earth for an ironman to collect half of secondaries to train crafting because in the end you still need to collect the giant seaweed, make the glass costing runes and $$ and blow it for what still is a relatively slow xp/h rate (because ironman can't rely on bot armies to cheaply make their air orbs like normal accounts can.)  
---
A lot of important items and content is locked behind crafting levels the vast majority of ironman players dont consider collecting sand or 3tick mining a fun and rewarding part of being an ironman.  They do it because they are forced to if they want to have glories or zenytes.  
---
The proposed solution still sucks a lot and the totally unnecessary 100gp per sand is really expensive for most players.  Theiving and agility pyramid, the two best pre pvm $$ methods make ~200k-300k per hour with high levels in the skill and there is already a high demand for that money for kingdom, construction, runes, and fletching.  
---
The fact that the sandstone passed the poll by large margins means that it should be implemented.  Mentioning that they disregarded a passed poll on the advice of high level players makes me and about 95% of all other ironman very mad.  Just because currently collecting a single secondary for a slowish xp/h training method is currently mindnumbingly horrible doesnt mean that it always need to be horrible.  
---
' **Gold sink** is an economic process by which a video game's ingame currency ('**gold**'), or any item that can be valued against it, is removed. ' 
---
How is that not a gold sink?
---
 Ironmen still bring GP into the game even if its a tiny comparison to normies.
---
Except that Corp cant roll on RDT like other monsters do, it only can roll RDT thru the Uncut-drop (which is alrdy pretty rare), with an "extremely low chance"

Same and i still have the crafting grind ahead. No more ez scape updates please :(
---
fuck that guy. but alsp,this is a witch hunt, and while i do think hes an ass, your basically doing the same by proxy as now he will be spammed with the same messages he sent you. in future, just cover his name as well. 
---
It would be niche but one super restore used with it could save 256 health which is insane to think about. 
---
So why not keep all $200?
---
To be fair: giant seaweed and the 10kg sandstones could potentially make 170+ glass per super glass make cast. Clearly this isn't the right solution.
---
If they reduce the cost of buckets, increase the conversion rates to be comparable to charter ships earlier (WITHOUT tick manipulation) and provided the buckets are noted upon withdraw, then I think the grinder is the best option
---
Thank you!!!
---
You realize most people don’t tick manipulate right? Lol. I do sometimes myself, but you’re out of your mind saying the majority of players are super efficient like that 
---
&gt; Jagex reserve the final say.
---
Yup that's true. And that still violates the principles of a democracy.
---
did he even try to use the agility obstacle
---
Sociopath detected
---
HP starts at 10 tho
---
I'm completely against most platforms Jagex get there feedback from.   The biggest and almost main purpose of this sub is to troll and yet this is where Jagex come for the majority of feedback.
---
The same goes for full time streamers, they have way more time to play over the average player.   Taking their feedback doesn't reflect the large majority of players.
---
They took feedback about clans in DMM from big content creators which literally had huge negative impacts on the time span of the seasons.    
---
It happens all the time and with a lot of stuff its fucking dumb.
---
And now I'm sad.
---
Other than 50/50, what are the chances of vorkath ranging 5 times in a row and hitting 20+? Yes, I just died at Vorkath and yes I'm salty about it.
---
Sounds like a very Russian name.
---
Petition to change Zulrah Snakeling Pet to this Streched Snek
---
That's 1 hour to pay for 2000 buckets of sand, plus however long it takes to mine enough sand stone for 2000 buckets. At that point charters on there own would be faster I think, though I'm not sure what exact rates are.
---
think its the second rarest skilling pet after the farming one. to get it in your 50s is wild gz. hope to get it one day as well
---
Stams are cheap.  Fuck off.
---
I watched half of it last night because it kept showing up in my recommended. 10/10 didn’t regret 
---
I love my surface pro i use the stylus alll the time aswell on my note 9, no problems mate
---
I guess since you're going for the stacking, but I'd rather just carry a dueling ring for clan wars resets and quick banking at Castle wars. I think banking at Castle wars and swapping glories would be faster over all? Ill be honest I don't even really know exactly where the manor tele drops you, so maybe Im wrong.
---
I haven't played my main in a while either, are you able to buy just normal kourend tele tabs?
---
Other option id see is just getting that kourend book and the pages from the new quests. Most of them are pretty short and will get you around to most parts of Zeah.
---
The book to unlock the kourend tele is ridiculously easy to find with the runelite plugin as well for anyone who hasn't unlocked that.
---
Clues can roll up only firelighters, uncommon/unlikely the higher tier you get, and be worth *far* less than this.
---
So to answer- firelighter rolls just kill value on clues.
---
Easy clues can just roll complete shit frequently (2 coifs, etc.)
---
false, im a maxed iron and i never once struggled with gp thanks to slayer
---
In the same post I talked about a chisel spawn also, but go off lol
---
QoL definitely isn't an item buff, a skill buff, a recourse collection buff...I just think this month should be called like suggestions month because QoL was what used to be suggested, but now its mostly just some of the latter.
---
You're right about the last part. But the areas are already so different, I don't think it is that big of a deal but I could be in the minority. Stuff already changes with the client, like being in a certain world disables one of your prayers. Certain items only work in certain areas (looting bag). It isn't that crazy for an area to have restrictions
---
Iirc, he actually says in a swampletics video "I hope I have enough prayer for this" when in some type or fight where he could easily do the fight ten times in a row.
---
I may be mistaken, though, so take the quote with a grain of salt. I'll try to find it after I get home in like an hour.
---
He definitely loses prayer over time in at least a couple of his fights throughout his videos, though. It's possible that he just doesn't care about being efficient with prayer, but even with that I'd call it a quirk as he basically does everything else flawlessly. 
---
Personally, I just don't think its possible for *everything* to fail. The community will get bored way to fast, eventually passing polls. I also don't think the Polls are the final say when it comes to content. Yes, a lot of the times it is due to the fact we have a great dev team, but if everything started to fail all the time, which I don't think will ever happen, the dev's just wouldn't sit by and let it happen, they would say: Hey we are adding this content, here are polls so you can decide how this content comes out. 
---
Kind of how it was with fossil island and Kebos. They didn't poll 'should be add Kebos lowlands', they said 'We have a big update coming up, here is your chance to vote on how the final product looks like'. 
---
I get what your saying but I just don't think it will ever go down to that. 
---
This fucking community lol. How sad
---
Not everyone cares about optimization, but rather just want to enjoy osrs. 
---
Go HA your judgemental Vibes and stop assuming your way is the only right way. 
---
Thanks for the response!
---
https://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1074
---
Divine failed by almost 10% though.
---
One super rest with the divine mitigates 256 damage. Maybe it will be niche but that is absurd. 
---
This person is correct. 
---
As someone who barely got a bank pin a few months ago, I thought it was unnecessary since I had authenticator and thought people wouldn’t even be able to log into it let alone get into my bank.
---
The problem is, this color palette doesn't match the OSRS style. At all.  
---
Also, the moment any form of black Graceful gets released is the moment everyone switches to it. Not really something I want to see, personally.
---
Wtf, no. Also, are you retarded? A full prayer pot heals more than 99 prayer points at 4 doses. If excluding brews, wtf is this for then? What, you're gunna drink 4 doses of super combat in 1 click?? That's just a blatant waste of 3 doses. Stamina potions? Also wastes 3 dose effects of regen energy. The only potion this suggestion works for is energy potions and nmz potions. Can't think of a single other case in game where you would need more than one potion dose in one tick, if we're excluding brews. Think next time before you post.
---
I DONT HAVE A BONER! YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE WITH A BONER! 
---
Eh, I don't even PvP and I think it should stay as it is.
---
Pretty sure most of us grind woodcutting for cash at one point back in the days ! I know i did and that's how i made my first 10m then, bought my Santa hat that i wanted for so long. I quit, came back pre eoc just like that, shit was over 100m lol!
---
Memes bud (:
---
Tick manipulation should never be proposed as a QOL update: 
---
Change my mind
---
Put your house in kourend for a cheap and easy teleport east of the woodcutting guild
---
probably the 10th time ive said this but the reason for me not wanting the original update is not because it 'devalues' my crafting xp, its because randomly making something 5x faster is not a good thing for the game, and the people voting yes to it just want fast crafting so they can get to end game stuff quickly. My argument is purely from a point of longevity of the game, not because i care about my xp being 'devalued'
---
This is the same mindset that happened with Fossil Island on the day of release. Everything was “dead content” but in reality all of it was really useful. 
---
yeah I guess not having a fury for zulrah is so smart lmao
---
This has actually nothing to do with those potions, did you read the rest of the comments or did you blindly write a statement to announce your ignorance. 
---
The line work on this is crisp af.
---
Stam pots
---
Tick manipulation should never be proposed as a "QOL" update:
---
Because the Pvp community was very much against this stuff last time.
---
Iron gold doesn't effect the economy in any way so gold sunk from irons isn't a gold sink for the overall economy. 
---
Look no one cares about your 60k loot. Go alch it and buy some more buckets of sand you fucking loser.
---
Because they can't be arsed to enter it everytime they log in. I don't have one but then again I won't really care if I get hacked and if I do I won't be posting on Reddit about how I'm quitting. If people cared as half as much as they say they do about their accounts they'd have a bank pin on - simple as that.
---
Used to come from raids and is now on a slayer monster table so the price will without a doubt go down further. Sell now.
---
Damn just got mine a few days ago, and I can safely say gz on completing one of the most tedious grinds in the game.
---
Well, RIP your rng then bud, the average loot from the current table is 105k.
---
Would forcing the player to have room in his/her inventory for the molton glass fix this? I mean- its not the most elegant fix but its preventing massive xp rates and retaining usefulness of the sandstone+giant seaweed
---
Buckets of sand are mainly only used for ironman accounts where they definitely dont need to add an unecessary gp sink
---
We need to fusion summon Red Cape and Blue Cape Swampletics to get Purple Cape Swampletics.
---
How does it ruin immersion?
---
OP watched "How to train melee AFK vid" I see.
---
The divine was polled two other times failing by much less than that.
---
Konar disappoints me a lot, and I don't care for money I have decent gear already. Yeah I know I can make like 38k xp at black demons but dries up more than 2k cannonballs and it's a long one, is my preference tho.
---
How about we focus an entire update on improving account security? We continuously ask for this and keep being ignored. I wish a J-mod would reply with the reasoning behind Authenticator removal delay has never been addressed. 
---
Gee has been in lumbridge since 2005 my guy 
---
Same thing happened with the spell book size it passed THREE times but they kept polling it until it failed
---
Fuck off.  As an ironman this mentality needs to die.  Stop dividing the community with this petty as fuck ideology. 
---
I think it totally matches the Hydra area. Is it just too flashy for you?
---
Set a goal for something like raids 1 and make money for the gear by doing slayer and rcing. This way it also forces you to do quests (for barrows gloves) and to get your stats up and make money all at the same time. 
---
This way is more enjoyable than trying to grind out one thing at a time. 
---
So now what?
---
They will fix the Draynor dock, said sorry and said they'll remember to detail changes in nostalgic scenery next time.
---
I don't mean to defend them on disregarding poll results, but at least on the Draynor issue they couldn't have done better.
---
You don't mine ore on an iron anyway if you're talking efficiency wise, you 3t granite and passively get ore from pvm. There's no reason ever not to take free xp, even if you feel bad getting post 99 xp.
---
Great discussion point. 
---
So now polls that have passed just aren't going to be implemented...? Many players have already collected sandstone in preparation for the update. I don't understand why we just went the opposite direction when it's already been polled and **passed**.
---
Splitting PVM from PVP is honestly ridiculous. It seems this subreddit brought this on yourselves for excluding PVP so much. Why even poll fixes that are half baked?
---
what's stopping you from getting 83 hunter
---
The man must really love sand
---
so it seems then that the chance to start rolling for unique's is 1/180?
---
He sure does know a lot about high quality gold though.
---
I agree, the shortcut should stay elite, however keeping some rope? Seems more like a hard diary to me. It doesnt effect a global rope market lol, and it also is just a QOL for people trying to kill the most outdated and already tilting boss (Besides KBD).
---
Jeez, you're a really bad ironman if you aren't going for a glory and instead going for a fury.
---
Mods ban this man
---
This is just the black graceful someone mentions every single week. Nothing new 
---
Guess you'll have to work for your fury.
---
&gt;I am honestly getting tired of these "high level members" of the community you keep talking about.
---
1 out of 100s of easyscape updates dont make it into the game and you're saying fuck the high level community lol?
---
We weren't conflicted the poll passed by a huge percentage what are you on about
---
Very nice, I know you needed it. 
---
Why limit it to energy potions? I can also see this being useful for prayer potions. I mean it's your call, suggest it in next week's Q&amp;A
---
Shut the fuck up you boring cunt.
---
Yea back in the day suggestions mostly were QoL because the game was clunky in 07. Now these suggestions are mostly content changes and buffs because the game has become pretty polished. Definitely a misleading label, “Community Suggestions...” would be better
---
The poll passed but Jagex did not think about what the spell will really require and do. For mains, people found out if they bought the largest sandstone blocks and giant seaweed, and casted glass make, it would be 1m/hr crafting xp. That isn't balanced and a buff like that is not QOL. It is a good idea for them to rethink it. 
---
Those fire starter are LIT!🔥🔥🔥🔥 I have over 3.9mil of them worth about 3.9mil

Lots of people seem to think they’re guaranteed a drop within X amount of kills.
---
*superior slayer and catacomb barraging dramtically increase xp rates for slayer*
---
community: nice
---
*buckets of sand*
---
community: EZSCAPE!????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
This could easily be avoided by capping the amount of XP earn't per cast?
---
Hahaha yes! couldn’t have said it better 😂
---
wait did somebody say swampletics
---
yes they will lmao. you are clueless about pvp if you dont think people will use it. Currently, there are 40 man teams (flamingos) who run around in 1b+ gear constantly because of the spec trade timer implemented last year
---
Wtf i had  2 times the 1 in 2k dragon drops but no claw
---
He’s trending lol
---
Might have to check it out. I've only really worked with react before and that had it's ups and downs. It would be fun to try and do a small project like this 
---
The prayer potion part is still iffy, but where do i submit that to next week? 
---
Nice to know Jagex have no backbone.
---
ok, but that wasnt my point. you know what the wild is, what it represents.
---
Are you sure about the elite void? I can see it: https://i.imgur.com/Cg55dTN.png
---
Again, what changed since the poll blog went up? If they were unaware of the rates of sand collection, that means they just never bothered to test it at all and just pulled the sand/sandstone numbers out of their asses.
---
If you are saying 75 slayer is considered high level please stop talking
---
1/512, keep going 
---
stfu milk boy
---
Thank god.  I voted no.
---
in what way is he laughing at him? he's informing him that there are quicker methods to get to zeah. some he doesn't have the requirements to do but some he does have, the point is informing him of all the options.  
---
so unless he's doing a home-tele only ironman or something, is there any reason he should keep running from lummy to draynor when there are quicker methods that he already has access to, but just doesn't know they exist?
---
A lot of people agreed with that slow route since it got upvoted to the top, so a lot of people decided to call him out
---
You’re right to an extent.. the game is advertised as “you pay you say” with the polls in mind. Sure we’re lucky they poll things, but the game is built on it. If they didn’t poll shit people would probably start quitting, so it isn’t like Jagex is just gonna stop polls. The tricky part is they keep running polls back that fail and now removed an update that will pass. The games foundation is on the community input through polls, but they’re undermining the communities voice by backtracking on passed polls or redoing failed ones. FWIW imo shit like arma helm model on females should absolutely be re-polled since it doesn’t affect gameplay, but trying to force Divine in again is a slippery slope 
---
You could also just change the rotation of you map without having to move draynor.  He said down, not south
---
Well, it’s a good thing this isn’t a democracy. 
---
They LITERALLY can't trade, are you disabled? The entire point of the game mode is that they can't interact with the economy. 
---
THIS NEEDS A BUFF!!! 
---

---

---
Yeah maybe, but so what
---
YOU'RE KILLING ME BRO! THESE ARE FUNDAMENTALS TO THE GAME! 
---
QoL, similar to "game integrity" tends to have an incredibly broad meaning around these parts.
---
So brave
---
why would you do this.
---
I'm so fucking curious, god dammit.
---
This isn't correct, they've intercepted and ignored poll results many times. One of the first times I've seen was they polled asking if they should remove the ability to 6hr AFK splash/NMZ, which of course failed the polls, and Jagex decided to do it anyways.
---
Good idea! I'll add another one in the top of the page.
---
Waaaaaaaaa
---
&gt; No one else knows how to do it
---
There is no way a team of software developers can't figure out how to implement this. Sure, maybe not the content devs, as they are mostly familiar with Runescript and not the engine that the game is built on. But there is literally a team of people who ***are*** familiar with the engine, and have been able to implement interface scaling already in mobile. I'm sure they are currently busy with mobile, but that's why I'm asking, because I'm curious to know if it's on their list of to-do's. It's not a matter of if they can do it, because we know they can. It's a matter of if they choose to allocate the time and resources to do so, and when this might be.
---
🤔 My macro economics textbook has a rule for doubling GDP. Should I invest for doubling the value of my spade pking clan.

you have to do a minigame to finish lumby diary without adding it to the diary.. sneaky snakes are sneaky
---
this could be allied to MANY skills... 
---
with tick manipulation at 99 mining it’s “slightly” better XP than charters and it costs 20x more. 
---
&gt; At 99 Mining, a casual player will be gaining a little under double the amount of sand than what’s currently available at Yanille
---
This is the similar rate also at 65 mining with tick manipulation, so I say it’s a good middle ground for speed that most people would be doing. This means it costs 100gp more than filling up your own buckets for double the buckets/hr, which means you have to make more than 350k/hr in order for it to be efficient to do the new method as opposed to collecting your own buckets. That might not be bad for high level accounts but for low/med levels that feels pretty horrible.
---
After a year or so, as the game and community change, repolling things isn't necessarily a bad thing (i.e. repoll hiding poll results please).
---
It's more problematic when it's 3 times in a month.

&gt;Does it mess with other playstyles? (Vengeance being moved isn’t something players have previously enjoyed)
---
&gt;Should players be able to rearrange the order of the spell icons in their spellbooks? If this question passes, it would only affect non PvP areas
---
??? just change the poll question to allow spell rearrangement in pvp so that autismal pkers don't get in the way of updates
---
You sound just like my dad.
---
Thanks Jagex, keep combatting EZScape and move this change to RS3 if the kiddies want it so bad.
---
Yeah there are other mitigations they could have done too however they didn't mention it in any devblog so I doubt they had even considered it.
---
Their initial proposal would have allowed someone to use giant seaweed and the largest sandstones for 170ish glass per spell cast. Look me in the eyes and tell me that's fine O.O. 
---
This being said their new proposal is garbage. Tick manipulation and 99 mining shouldn't be what it takes to beat shop scape.
---
I got a bucket at 17, 18, and 20kc
---
Zezima is like a father to us all
---
The only problem i see is the gp cost. In my opinion it should be the click intensive variant at med lvl ironmen too, but with the gp cost i dont think it would be viable before slayer/pvm grinds.
---
the issue is the purposed changed to sandstone is literally fine. its very fair and it sounds kinda fun. meanwhile casuals are screeching the hlc is literally RUINING the game because they don't have time to play an mmo anymore.
---
cattering the casuals ruined wow, it ruined runescape once, not gonna have it happen again. you don't need to be a high level player to enjoy this game.
---
It's very anticlimactic. Don't bother.
---
Nice maxing party w/ 96 prayer ;)
---
Yeah because they never drop stuff over to mains or alts. Are you that dense? 
---
Gz nerd, about time it went like this
---
you wouldnt use it at inferno lol your clueless
---
I try to as well - but the hunter/fishing icons block a sizable portion of the instance on the minimap so that's still kind of tough. Plus yellow dots are prioritized when a fish is standing over them too so sometimes it's hard to notice regardless.
---
To paraphrase what I said elsewhere, they don't repoll often; I think last time was like 2 or 3 years ago. Reoffering until something passes isn't good, but at the same time, it is good to ignore something the community wants now because it once got 72% in a poll 4 years ago either. Over time, the community changes, both in players coming and going and the opinions of players in general. In 2013, a lot of stuff would have failed that would pass today; Grimy Herbs did fail back then. If it is something the community still doesn't want, then it would fail a poll again. But if it is something where there is a reasonable demand, I don't think it is out of the question to repoll it after 3 years or so to see if there is more support.
---
You can feed the suffering with recoils to get the effect

Luigi
---
That's why it's "creep", not "jump".
---
Tbf it’s helped me loads. No internet as I just moved out so I afk all day at work
---
500 kc got my first dpick yesterday and no pet yet but that's to be expected
---
15-16 is legal in most countries on earth. These women look 18-20+
---
Not bad, that's 945 coins you didn't have before. 
---
It would/could have created a meta where you just superglass make and do'nt blow the glass. The exp from the spell scales with how many glass you made per cast. The following would have been true.
---
Starting with an inventory of 18 giant weed and 6 10kg sandstone casting the spell gives us 108 glass (All supplies buyable from grand exchange).
---
Giant weed counts for 6 regular seaweed (18 * 6 = 108). 10Kg sandstone counts for 18 sand buckets (18 * 6 = 108)
---
Using superglass make gives 10 crafting exp per glass made thus 1.08k exp per cast.
---
Spell is 5 ticks with, lets allow 1 ticks banking, giving 6 ticks total(Note you can actually bank during the spell cooldown, 1t here is generous).
---
Thus we cast 1000 times/hour for 1.08k exp each giving 1080k exp/h ~ 1.1m exp/h
---
Solid point. Maybe an option to turn them off by talking to Annette or Ceto? Idk - i find it frustrating since i have no use for them right now.
---
Can you make Empty light bulbs from crafting more useful please? or at the very least noteable
---
Yeah everyone is a fucking snowflake these days
---
Swamp man bad
---
You never really "have" the $200, even after they "send" it, because like others have said it's stolen/fraud money, so it will end up getting charge backed eventually.
---
We talking about the man, right??
---
Did you really get all of thoose boots just to make a pun?
---
You basically never have to grind cash after the super early-game. You end up with more than you need pretty much as soon as you get to 65-70 slayer, so gp can basically be viewed as requiring 0 time to acquire (since you'd be training slayer anyways because of how crucial 87 slay is).
---
Hindsight is 20/20 so it's hard to say, but that outcome of adding superiors to addy and rune dragons sounds incredibly obvious.
---
I sincerely doubt jagex's ability to make a new engine that even roughly matches the current one. Especially considering they can't even update the client.
---
The halo remaster was made with a mix of engines from other halos as well as other developers. No one will even touch the osrs engine besides ash in an emergency. 
---
Just my opinion: if it can't be added into PvP, just don't propose it. All these different settings in one game for 2 groups/areas. I hate it.
---
Yes sir
---
he is already just leeching off of rs drama and profiting, now hes too lazy to make his own thumbnails or pay someone to do them for him... IMO this is just stealing from smaller creator even if content breaks ToS of rs....
---
Ironmen are pretty strong! Get it? Ok ill walk myself out
---
It's more the principle of the thing. The image was good enough to take for this reddit post, so it should be good enough to credit the artist. 
---
Only your right hand would get stronger, just like masturbating.
---
after considering the cost of the runes/buckets/sand, it's probably around 1:1 gp/xp
---
money just kinda pours in when you do slayer if you don't skip the good tasks for it (dusts/gargs/nechs)
---
Cheers mate. I shall try all the ASAP. Much love. 
---
It's all fun and games until they nerf melee and mage and make range even more powerful but call it an integrity change because they think blowpipes should be more expensive for how good it is
---
its not game QOL its polls based on the developers qol for the month. AKA the least amount of work for the most content 
---
Shoot you right, if there isn't a reward of 1 qp then vote no.
---
Oh my, you're a special kind of fool.
---
1. No PKer gives a damn about sand. Other ironman are voting no. 
---
2. Collecting sand at a faster rate is fun? 
---
3. Your statement holds no value whatsoever since spite voters are just going to spite vote anyway. Saying "MAKE SURE THEY WON'T HAVE FUN EITHER" implies that if this poll passed you would have voted yes to PvP updates. That is simply not the case, sand collector. You were going to vote no anyway. 
---
My b. I forgot that looking forward to an update is frowned upon. 
---
Also, do you mean thinking the world revolves around me, the same way the vocal minority was? About this same update? Crazy to think someone would voice their opinion on a social media platform. 
---
Gtfoh, gatekeeper
---
Shitty attitudes like this just get cool shit covered in ugly watermarks. Don't be an asshole
---
I am trying to do damage on him but it takes ages to kill him just got a 5min kill lol
---
That was technically polled in the question when they asked wether or not the quest should be added. Anytime there’s a new quest there’s has to be new areas and changes to existing areas. No one cares when they change zeah or something for a quest so I guess it was just an oversight to by them to think no one care about the draynor change. Basically what I’m saying is jagex isn’t purposely adding things they know the players don’t want 
---
i agree lol
---
I was skeptical at first too, but as soon as I watched it I got hooked
---
Just make a house portal 
---
the xp rate was pretty comparable to mining iron in the mining guild, not bad by any means.
---
its just bigger creator stealing from smaller creqtors once again and if i was toolsRS id copyright claim that video in heartbeat for free money. oakdice thinks hes perfect abd all that shit, yet hes just stealing from others.
---
ya your right i think im gonnas tart with some slayer or barrows on the main
---
I remember my first time Englishing
---
This is the best solution!
---
I don't see it as a scam....
---
It's the wilderness as it always is, risk vs reward.
---
Believe him and he is telling the truth you make bank.
---
Believe him and he is talking shit... you make significantly less;however, you still gain.
---
Personally I never tell people what I have just let them work it out for themselves... haven't had an issue finding a fight 
---
not sure who couldnt get that in 2 or 3 months playing like 2 hours a day
---
I just started watching it all today, he has some great content. Swampletics FTW 
---
I will definitely look into the requirements for the rock cake then! Thank you for your replies
---
Yeh
---
I think it makes the Inferno easier (you will be able to survive any Zuk hits). 
---
I don't think it will pass and I won't be voting Yes.
---
You could also try unrestricted worlds. There, you can use all the supplies (including Zul’ andra teleports 20k ea) you want without spending anything. This makes it a lot better to learn one rotation at a time because you can quickly teleport out and go back in if you get a rotation you don’t know. I recently did this and saved way more money than I would have made learning zulrah in teleports alone. 
---
You may be on to something. 
---
if you want low effort money makers, doing birdhouse runs + herb runs + giant seaweed nets you alot of profit in the long run without much effort.
---
lol it would have been over 1.1m an hour only using the glass make spell. Extremely overpowered. But yeah everyone who noticed that is a neckbeard 
---
Guy is using an autoclicker to flick protect from melee on and off so his prayer doesn't deplete. The post is jokingly saying that the guy is just practicing the flicking before going into NMZ
---
Somebody got PKed for their spade.
---
You mad you banked all that sandstone for nothing bruh 😭
---
What is the ratio now,  and is it worse? 
---
lol i just love the way PKers really think clicking an icon is skillgap
---
I will vote Yes :)
---
Probably BIS offhand for blackchin hunting
---
When i used to watch his guides back in 2014, he legit sounded like the most innocent soul ever lol
---
If you're not on an ironman is 1750 total even difficult to achieve? I don't want noobs voting for ezscape without understanding this is a grinding game..
---
But why are they doing it outside of the NMZ  instead of in a dream?
---
RS3 had these with presets. They're amazing.
---
20k is way higher than what is actually possible at the (at the exchange rates which passed the poll). It was less than half that in reality. 20k+ was using the patched method, which lasted only a few hours.
---
Gatekeeper? Haha. 
---
You should probably be the one leaving since you're quitting, right?
---
You're making it seem like this is some HUGE update. This a minuscule change that hardly affects the game. If something so small would make you quit, you really aren't that valuable. 
---
It's usually sent by using stolen card information or money that has been gained illegally. Never worth the risk.
---
What’s the name?
---
No quest point ironman ( no q p btw ) has been around for awhile and its been pretty good 
---
I will too!
---
&gt;  easy, AFK way of getting 60 hunter for MM2
---
You could get 60 in a fraction of the time with normal methods. 
---
Andy Six, is that you?
---
And then reddit will start complaining since most of them are ~1500 total.
---
Charters : infinite and constant supply of molten glass / blowing
---
Initially proposed method : multiple hours to mine, and gather sand while also incredibly click intensive, hours and hours to make the glass, and after all that finally get charters equivalent exp
---
New proposed method : multiple hours to mine and still very click intensive, 2,5x less sand, 100x more costy, stupidly boring and slow, to finally POSSIBLY get the same exp as charters (if 99 mining and ticking)
---
Wtf?? Listen to your playerbase not to weird elitists blowing glass is barely 70k exp an hour with obtaining etc. 
---
Support, though the autists will be screaming ezscape.
---
Cause it was in RS3
---
Presets is a way better word for it. I was struggling with what words to use
---
The first time they polled in the negative if I recall, meaning you needed 75% for it to not happen.
---
It works up until the point you are caught and charged with fraud. Good luck getting any credit anywhere if that is what happens
---
Nice! I'm probably a bit on the 'devalues my Infernal' train which may be affecting my decision.
---
I also have to consider the shield will be like 1Bil and you couldn't use the Twisted Bow while having the shield equipped there.
---
Wilderness is the only place this content can exist, it is too rewarding otherwise. Most of the game has become a risk free zone with the changes made to death mechanics, people camp every boss with bis gear flooding the game with gold/items at an astounding rate. The wilderness is meant to be  a high risk/reward zone
---
but how will i max my driving-on-the-interstate-at-90mph-only ironmongrel?
---
You don’t consider charter ships a viable method, but yet the proposed solution had to be balanced around it. In fact, for most players it’s significantly worse. Adding an extra cost, plus mining and longer banking times and you’ve got content that’s DOA. They either need to nerf the shops while bringing other methods closer to the 70k/90k rates, or use the solution that passed a poll and adjust it down accordingly. The proposed solution is just silly. 
---
I can kind of get the thought process behinds ezscape creep but imo this is more along the lines of shift click drop
---
So being able to afford 99 in a skill that takes 6 hours to max is an achievement? Lol the 2m xp per hour method isnt like EXTRENELY expensive. If you can afford bandos armor than you can afford 99 fetching and more. That's your average high level player..
---
They afked for too long and eventually died as a result. The owner just hasn’t come back yet.
---
Is he actually going for ranger boots?
---
It's a really good series if you're into osrs content.
---
When you’re just trying to pop balloons in the Falador party room then someone runs over and grabs your d long
---
I agree to an extent but OSRS is nowhere near as severe as rs3
---
Seems like you crashed him...?
---
But did it died?
---
Yep. Fraud marker is the thing you never want on your file. 
---
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
---
Current death mechanics needs to be  reworked. 
---
Jagex making anything even slightly easier = everyone screams ezscape muh game integrity
---
Personally I'm more concerned with poll integrity, ie not assuming that the 83.5% of people that voted for this didn't consider balance at all and just ignoring the result because a vocal minority complained loudly enough.
---
You're one of the people I'm talking about. You don't want to try hard for 99s so you vote yes for every easyscape update because you think getting 99s take 10 billion years or some shit.
---
Its 12 minutes left my dude
---
I agree with what you're saying, but I can't find any kind of pity for someone who's video is OBVIOUSLY a guide on how to fucking cheat at the game. 
---
Fuck that guy and his thumbnail. 
---
An upvote for you. Amen
---
Smoking Kills (Slayer Helmet) came out in 2008, same year as corp.
---
Statius' Warhammer (DWH) came out in 2008.
---
Rocktails (Anglerfish) came out in 2009.
---
We got a staff of light cosmetic upgrade in OSRS when Staff of Light came out in 2010.
---
List goes on. I would generally disagree with your statement that anything post 2007 is RS3, it's just false.
---
Real talk - is now a killer time to invest in iron or what?
---
This is fucking outrageous. Jagex please reconsider this.
---
2 months after he changed his name from it , unless he changes back to it after that time
---
also some names are banned for different reasons like if his account got banned with the name on it
---
maybe jagex will do another name cleanup again in a year or 2
---
I feel like this title is missing a comma.
---
beautiful! this is a beautiful video
---
How is it a neck beard demand to not homogenize crafting for im? 
---
Then don't go to the Wilds for possible high reward lmao or go with cheap gear.
---
What he does is 1 tick prayer flicking, which does not drain prayer and keeps the prayer up at all times. It's not spamming, it's precise timing. That's why he always has the overhead on.
---
The reason he was saying for that fight "I hope I have enough prayer for this," was because he mentioned there were NPCs there that drain his prayer when he's hit.
---
Waaah I can’t get 99 crafting for free in under. 20h :(
---
Hohoho wait til the runecrafting grind
---
Yep, this was before the addition of Slepe and ToB. IIRC he did mostly the same grinds as Swampletics have done so far.
---
It’s fairly high on an Ironman, yes. Remember no cballs, d scim is best weapon until 85 slayer, and you don’t get black mask until 58. Even at 75 though, this method is still made inefficient by gp requirements, it’s just even worse with lower slayer. 
---
yep i just recently banked 93 and i still don't see any issue with it
---
they're still gonna give us an alternative to the sandpit so all the people complaining right now are either oblivious or just upset that jagex isn't gonna magically shave 40-45 hours off the time to max
---
I've been edging for the last 4 hours hurry the f up. 
---
I have the Authenticator and PIN. I have to use the authenticator once every 30 days and the PIN once per login. That's it. It's extremely easy.

You do realise what game you’re playing right?

What does the triple parenthesis mean?

Then don’t play 
---
i only ever give money to noobs actively doing things in game. if they're sitting in the GE begging for money they could be doing one of the various activities in the game to *actually* earn money. 
---
that's if they're even noobs at all and not experienced players running bots on low level accounts to fish for free cash with 0 effort.
---
First drop was a while ago, having a first try with just a Cbow. Today I tried chinning for the first time and the last 3 drops happened:D
---
I have no idea. I just know that a lot of things are bottlenecked by banking. Some things like making unfinished pots as an example would get an increase but only marginally, not even enough for me to care personally. 
---
Honestly its way less of a factor than nostalgia brigading.
---
Nah i got sick of barrows due to horrible rng, barely any 100k chests and 3 karils coifs and 1 crossbow are my only items
---
I don't think it had to do with maxed players.
---
* Sandstone being used as a substitute for Buckets of Sands didn't make sense.
---
* Having to process the Sandstone into Buckets of Sand makes sense.
---
* The amount of Buckets of Sand you received was far too much as polled, and would've rightfully deserved a nerf.
---
The new *method* is good, but the new *rates* and *cost* are not.
---
What's funny about the last satchel is you can access it easily from the other side, and not even need to do the last, trickiest part, apparently he missed that in his guide.
---
Happy Birthday mate
---
They’re siding with the minority.

It's more than some folks have gotten.

Don't let the sweaty's with filled up loot logs make you think you aren't doing anything.

Logging on right now just to vote on 4.
---
Lol. I take a break, get excited for an update, then get let down by jagex. I dont want 1.1m xp/hr. I do want superglass make to work with sandstone. 
---
I am SO sorry that we have a difference of opinion. 
---
I love that you wrongly assume everyone who wanted a new method of obtaining Buckets of Sand is just a noob with no game knowledge.
---
Maybe they just have a different opinion to you.
---
Yeah I feel you on that one but is it really necessary to go and comment on those posts? I mean you can also scroll past if without wasting any time on it. 
---
Oh sorry I must be retarded for thinking mains could buy it on he
---
Wait .. they can, guess you’re the retard 
---
Awesome compromise!
---
What is there to dislike about it? Lol it literally just saves inventory space
---
You don’t lose it if you’re not skilled you moron
---
What's overpowered about it?
---
Fun fact, superglassmake caps at 180 crafting xp per cast. So the 1m/h thing is not the reason they revoked this.
---
No one is forcing you to go into the wildy to get a Dragon Pickaxe. You can very easily use a rune one.
---
However obtaining one through wilderness bossing where there is a risk of getting PKed for all of your items in your inventory except 3 can give the reward of a faster pickaxe.
---
If someone banked it then they’re taking twice as long for trying to cheat and I’m fine w that :-)
---
Nah i keep losing money doing them so i just do them casually every now and then (15kc, still die once at olm in final phase thus my points go below 15k and i lose money)
---
Look I hate OakDice as much as the next guy but are you actually trying to defend a video of some guy cheating
---
It wasn’t a bad idea, but like there are so many changes that shouldn’t be left up to the community. 
---
We aren’t the god damn devs. 
---
They know shit we don’t and it is just confusing why they poll some dumb shit than won’t pool bigger stuff.
---
2nd One is locked behind Morytania Elite 
---
What he's saying is polls are accessed by the game client program and by the website server program. They have limited resources to change the website server program. If they only change one without the other, you could still view the poll results. 
---
[Lol 69](https://i.imgur.com/YHoMZIX.png)
---
Nah mate it’s literally just shit compared to charters and filling your own buckets. 
---
Agreed. A big qol increase in getting a secondary for blowing glass doesnt take away the fact that you still need to get the giant seaweed, money for runes, make the glass, and blow the seaweed.  
---
If it's some random starter noob in iron armor and you upgrade him to steel, or give a goblin killer their first full set then fair enough it just helps than out a bit. But if it's like full addy/rune you've just taken a pretty big part of the early game sense of accomplishment away from them - its gp value might be nothing to a higher level but to a noob it's a big milestone
---
If it's a ge beggar I completely ignore them, anyone who donates to these kind of players are just enabling laziness to the point some of them openly refuse to go out and earn their own money when asked why they don't do that, since begging can get hundreds of k an hour apparently
---
Varrock gen store upstairs
---
Window open and curtains drawn, yuck!
---
the worst part is there are people who fall for this and end up losing money themselves and possible charges for what they thought was an attempt at free money. though if you keep the chats you should be able to prove innocence 
---
noone would have voted yes for this if they knew it would create over 1m an hour exp rates for normal accounts in 1/4 of the price of the 150k exp methods. thats just outright stupid
---
Fuck no. 
---
Where did you people come from? Mobile? RS3? All these new players have no idea how OSRS is run and they come here and try to change how it's been since 2013. Fuck off.
---
He's asking how Jagex would know the difference just by looking at it though. 
---
Base 80's member. Recommend joining. Been in the CC since I started playing again. Good group of people.

---
Been in the cc for a couple of months now. Learnt a few new bosses already. Always a team for bandos if you want one haha. 
---
Not ready for raids yet but looking forward to learning with you guys. 
---
Its insane how good wyrm bones are for prayer atm. 
---
Going for 950-1000gp each on G/E atm.
---
On gilded altar thats like 5.5gp/xp (half if using wildy altar)
---
Compare that to dragon bones at 9.2gp/xp
---
Wyrm bones: 175 xp
---
Dragon bones 252 xp
---
Just wait until some popular youtuber makes a video on this "cheap new prayer method" and these bones will skyrocket.
---
but would literally any ironman have enough seaweed/giant seaweed to make that?
---
It’s way better than the current bucket filling system .. you just want it extremely easy. Go play normie bud then you can just buy gems to cut.
---
The bigger pain in the ass is dealing with 1-3 kill trips unlike a main that can camp for hours in a trio or something. Biggest thing that puts me off gwd on my iron. Imagine killing 15000-20000 goblins or imps just to finish bandos or zammy in a reasonable rate, taking a ton of time between each kill to get back there. 
---
Because the problem is that people stockpiled a method that was absolutely OP before it was hot fixed. 
---
Making the ratio less would just be punishing those that didn’t abuse the unintended method for getting it. 
---
I never said everyone is a noob. I like how you didn't care about how the guy I replied to assumed everyone against the new method is a maxed player.
---
You see the world in a beautiful way
---
I haven't gotten 171 before, but I've definitely rolled a few in the 400 range
---
Absolutely not
---
It’s only the fastest method at 99 mining and tick manuipulation. Otherwise chartering is still the best. 
---
it doesnt matter if video was about brexit or racism, you think this is first time oakdice has done this? 
---
This exactly. I should have clarified. I’m worried a trade like this would be flagged or something.
---
Nice shirt mate

Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
I'm aware of the nmz/splashing poll, that's why I specified "passing". In that case the poll to remove it failed, it's a different situation. 
---
Not really op. You would have to take an an entire inventory of ppots to use it more than 15 mins at bandos.
---
But yet we have dragon claws? Blow pipe? Rigour? Zenyte jewelry?the list goes on buddy boy. Not every rs3 item/update was bad. A lot of people liked 2009-2011scape.
---
You really think it's faster to have to read and interpret a guide over and over instead of mindlessly following the exact same steps as a professional quester? He literally tells you when you can spam space through dialogue and when you need to be precise. He's #1, k thanks bai.

thats still more than many others, keep on grinding nigga
---
Yea its dope as fuck dont know what uses it has other than the staff?
---
Gratz! I got mine at 3kc a few weeks ago :) I never expected a pet at all so I love him dearly :P it matches Arceus Graceful and a Toxic Blowpipe very well if your every trying to fashionflex with it 
---
Why vote no to new interesting content that I’d imagine less than 5% of the osrs population is going to have at any given time? I always thought they were awesome and looks pretty dope 
---
the "can't tell if sarcasm" comments when it's blatant sarcasm
---
i guess this just reinforces the social stereotypes of this community
---
Here's my question:
---
Why is someone in the desert going through all this effort to grind sandstone, when literally the entire desert is covered in sand?
---
Hmmmm...
---
What does RNG mean?
---
L
---
risk = reward
---
also when bulwark exists you have no excuse dying at most places 
---
theres no risk in this game anymore, hasn't been since they changed death mechanics and added bosses that give 4m/hr with no risk of losing anything when dying
---
id love to see people like you play pre eoc
---
Huh, either that was edited in or I skimmed over it while reading expecting it to be the same. I get why resizing and the spec orb were excluded, but rearranging has already been a thing in third-party clients so this seems bit strange.

played yourself.
---
I think that if you implemented this then emulating android and using mouse would be advantage over not doing that which is not what you want.  The reason it would be advantageous is with your suggestion you can 1 tick from weapons without spec bars (and still get the second spec off because mouse), which is pretty strong.
---
Could I have some numbers on why Gargs are shit xp and go?
---
Actually Jagex have done this before:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/91ip2a/when_your_thing_you_want_doesnt_pass_a_poll/?st=JS3MSOEU&amp;sh=fb5c3a19
---
The squeaky wheel gets the grease. It was polled, it passed, but because the bitching, it isn't being added....?
---
Thank you so much for the fast responses! I think I just worry too much because it would break my heart if I lost all the hours I put into my account
---
but then it brings this: the poll passed by massive favor and jagex can just say, nevermind we are not doing this even though this passed by 83.5%.
---
Jagex can just say nope we are doing this for any future poll.
---
What you mean that jagex is getting further away? I’m not quite sure what is meant 
---
Personally, I like Captain America better.
---
Thats so sad
---
go one tick an 8 way and then you can tell me that making barrage the size of the entire interface wouldn't make it easier to do
---
shit, if you can one tick a 4 way and i'll be impressed
---
Let em die
---
It isn't random and it isn't 5x faster. It's a quality of life update so that people don't have to spend hundreds of hours collecting sand from a pit.  You still get the same xp/hr while actually crafting. This adds an alternative to the 40+ hour sand pit grind which gains zero xp with one that is interactive and incorporates an additional use to the mining skill.  Do you actually think that the better option for the longevity of the game is to have a slow and shitty 40+ hour no xp gained grind instead of an interactive multi-skill addition? If you are trying to argue that part of the crafting grind should be to spend hours gaining no xp at the sandpits filling buckets then this is about devaluing your xp as this would introduce a faster and actually interactive method of collecting sand. Once you have sand, no matter where it came from, your crafting xp/hr is the same. You aren't suddenly gaining x5 faster crafting xp because you didn't spend 500 hours collecting sand for 0xp/hr.
---
Polling was great at the start. It gave devs more of an idea of what players want, and where they want to see the game go.
---
Unfortunately polling anymore is a complete mess. Players have developed a feeling of entitlement and when they don't get what they want, they instantly vote no to polls that don't affect them causing other aspects of the game to fall very short compared to others. 
---
Polls should still play a part to major changes and the devs should still be focused on taking in feedback, but something needs to change.
---
We don't do ffa raids but we are recruiting people  . Clan chat: "lootchasing" we have about 45 members alot of them are close to raid ready and a handful raid on the regular. If you're interested I'll be able to get you in the discord!
---
But Runite Ore can be obtained from many monster loots and now also outside the Wilderness.  
---
If it was still only available in the Wilderness, I would agree, but that is not the case.
---
Or maybe it’s to drive all you pussy ass pvpers to the point in life where all you want to do is trade your existence for a nature rune and 3 fire runes, which is totally what I want btw
---
My personal theory is that part of the reason they canceled this update was because it'd force them to re-write the entire Super Glassmake spell code. Currently, the amount of bonus glass received upon casting the spell is related to the number of glass you were trying to cast. That's 30% bonus glass when trying to do 13 and 60% bonus glass when trying to do 18, so using those numbers how many bonus glass would we get trying to make **120 glass at once**? We're potentially talking hundreds, maybe even over 1000 glass made **per cast** of the spell.

Hi GoOnNoMeatNoPudding!

You'll run into the same problem.  If I run an emulator with a mouse and keyboard and log into a mobile pvp only world, everyone there would be food for me.

I bet you cannoned your way to 99 slayer.
---
It's a secret unlock at 99 agility.

Not going to lie,  I miss the days of classic and the   weird graphics.  . .
---
You just got screwed. No way to get your money back. They did it to me once and screwed me for 21 days.
---
I like this guy!
---
&gt; This isn't a case of something being polled, released and then discovering that it was OP, in which case a Nerf is appropriate; the rates were well known while the poll was active. 
---
most retarded argument ive heard in  a while..
---
Oh my bad, re-read your reply and it makes sense now. I'm kind of blinded by annoyance reading everything on reddit lately so my go-to is to think everyone disagrees with me. Good to read something sensible in this mess.
---

A combination of my favourite colours oh god please I need this so bad.

Definitly slayer 🤟🏼 WBU?
---
That’s for Ironmen and women I don’t judge only. I could be wrong but didn’t he specifically say for mains 1mil/hour 
---
True, you'll only be getting 100k xp/hr at 2s2g :/
---
Can’t wait to See yours in 10 weeks ;)
---
Maybe some people don't play to max? I would rather save irl money then rsgp
---
Nobody thinks that. 
---
People are just happy and hyped because he's super entertaining, dedicated, and he's doing it better than almost anyone else. 
---
Expensive items fluctuate a lot like that
---
downvote, have a beautiful day.
---
there are toxic players in general.  it's not like theres one community that contains all the toxic players lol
---
They aren't "ignoring" anything. The statement makes it clear that they fucked up and polled something without processing feedback. If the original question had time to be discussed and changed before going live, it never would have been polled as it was. That's the problem they're facing. 
---
i got my fire cape and my barrows glove, but only 95 combat; once I'm 100 i'll find this post again :D
---
94 thiev is already max ardy knights exp. Its 250k xp and 300k gp an hour from 94 and its maxed there.
---
the divine poll though
---
Thanks
---
It’s best with sound. When ur hear the prayer u double click and just sync it that way. There’s also a runelite plugin for this method of flicking. The ticks are different on all worlds because of inconsistent ping or whatever, which is why the sound is very helpful
---
Its been sitting at 5-5.5m for awhile thats why i ask.
---
Impeccable. 
---
&gt; "infinitely charismatic anti-hero who breaks the fourth wall to tell the audience his intentions" is an incredibly compelling formula.
---
I don't think any formula is inherently compelling, any idea can be done well or terrible it's entirely about execution.
---
&gt;Not to mention, production value absolutely matters in a show
---
When did I say it didn't? I said it doesn't make a good tv show because on it's own production doesn't make something good. A well produced turd is still a turd but a poorly produced and fundamentally solid show can still be good.
---
&gt;Its definitely not on the level of the Big Three you mentioned, but it's pretty easy to see why the show's first two seasons were as popular as they were.
---
I dunno I'm not saying it has to be as good as them to be great but eh, I still don't get the hype. Maybe it's just because politics are kind of in right now as far as entertainment goes so it's got more oomph for some people but I just found it kinda dull and not terribly well written but eh that's personal taste I guess. 
---
Okay but then you need to consider that the price of sandstone and seaweed will likely rise a significant amount if that method becomes mainstream, other people were saying around 30gp/xp minimum. The time spent gathering that amount of cash would again render the method comparable to other methods like glassblowing.
---
"Galaxy Clan" cc, our raids are mostly split however
---
Got my full set a few days ago also. Its pretty great... congrats!
---
Just because someone isn't affected by the poll that doesn't mean they can't have a valid opinion on it, lol. 
---
Also, still waiting for someone to give me a valid reason for the poll being reverted if it wasn't because of a controversial situation surrounding the community
---
Gralic berad
---
A singles team has no business using them since they want DPS. Someone like Abyss would definitely use it since he gets hunted down by singles teams every stream. 
---
Solo/small squads would definitely use though. 
---
Devalues my autism
---
You're acting as if chartering at max efficiency is any easier than tick manip mining. Charters are a pain in the ass.
---
Rune dragons are probably your best bet with your stats. They were added during your hiatus and require dragon slayer 2 to be completed.
---
Common sense and facts are not well received on reddit. Only anything that says "Rune craft bad" or "make the game easier please" is liked on here. Or something about swampletics, u can get away with that as well.
---
Really? You colored bro. I don't call myself an artist for using a coloring book. You made it black lmfao.
---
Oh cry me a river. You just don't have the will to put any decent chunk of time into grinding out crafting and just want 85 handed to you. I'm only 76 and can see how the polled change would've massively devalued getting a fury/zenyte.
---
ironman skilling clan which has now become the rot of skilling to reddit because they opposed the sand change lmao
---
Would like to clarify, i have only donated full rune at 2 different points, one to someone who had been training at hill giants and was strong enough to wear, but did not have the money. I helped him through a few parts of dragon slayer.
---
The second, i gave to someone who was hacked, but looking back on it it could have been a scam. The guy seems really nice to this day, so i don't think so.
---
they should've just made it 1 sandstone piece for 1 bucket of sand. lmao
---
i vote invest in 90 herb for raids 1 and then work on base 80 stats to hit 2k (besides rc of course) 
---
That’s not funny. What an idiotic comment 
---
Wait a second, playing a mode that doesn't make GP per hour the king of everything makes you stupid? 
---
Hope you get lucky, good luck man :D
---
&gt;Ah, so a passive aggressive reply it was. Got it.
---
nope, just aggressive. this almost as bad as people saying "humblebrag" for something that's just a brag.
---
&gt;Until the OP responds, it is perfectly possible it was not sarcasm.
---
to someone who doesn't understand social cues, sure
---
you seem pretty thin-skinned, btw
---
If you just wanna max efficiently, you can get 90ish Melee stats before doing slayer, because of how much you barrage and cannon
---
Everyone should play however they damn want to, though
---
I need to know where she got this. I want 
---
The infamous green strength amulets? Yes.
---
i tried that, also got full prayer to be sure, but still nothing
---
this is why you don't open crates before getting better relevant base stats 
---
There was an influx in demand with the release of Kebos and Konar with people scrambling to make a profit on all ends, so blowpipes went up to like 6.8m at one point and are just settling back down now that people are flooding the market with all of the loot they've acquired over the last couple weeks
---
This is a month old but I get 1-2 gems ever 2 inventories or so. I do mine with a glory on though
---
Your question is answered very clearly in their statement...
---
This is why we should have a higher voting requirement.
---
Je bent echt n machine.

Only 75% of the passed entries get implemented

Thanks! Gz on your set aswell :D
---
PUSH IT TO THE POLLS
---
just use your keyboard to select the location like literally everyone else
---
How do these moronic posts constantly get upvoted? It's not rare to get garbage like this from a med, but I guess to the average level 70 redditor this is mind blowing content. 
---
**https://i.imgur.com/r3mNPPK.jpg**
---
Friend of mine achieved this on his ironman as well. Probably the 2nd rarest untrimmed cape for ironman behind slayer.
---
Right? Like why scrap the idea all together?
---
probably ignoring picking up all the extra buckets that get tossed on the ground
---
I didn't even see the third pair until I read the comments.  Congrats on the insane RNG lol
---
The only time it's been nerfed in its existence was a few days after its release in early 2015, and that was only a nerf in pvp. Jagex are awful at nerfing overpowered content (see zulrah drop table nerfed 5 times, nmz, splashing, tbow) so nothing to worry about there.
---
Firstly, they are not actually obligated to put in a thing just because they polled it.  That is great news for them because there are plenty of passed polled updates that never made it to the game.  So the premise that this "breaking of trust" is somehow even a thing is not really founded in reality.
---
Secondly, if they stated that they still want to assist with sand per hour but don't like this solution, maybe let them make the next suggestion before commenting.
---
I fucking love ranget
---
I’d say to cater to the people who were forced to stop playing because of eoc. I put thousands of hours from when i started playing in 2005 to 2012 when I was forced to pretty much quit because eoc made things so different. Yes the backup was for 2007 but many people myself included liked how it was in 2011 but we didnt have anywhere to go but 2007scape.

---
mobile game - Summoners War.  
---
I'm sorry.
---
What could possibly have changed? Did they drastically miscalculate it and decide that this is way too broken?  When I saw it I was excited as an Ironman but did some calculationsand thought this was a bit much, just upset they couldn’t just tweak the numbers instead of killing it. Nothing in the game is less fun than shop hopping 
---
Ffs it has been 2 hours 
---
Apparently this weeks "QoL" polls are re-polls (polls which narrowly failed in the past). Whether or not they are truly QoL is a different story 
---
I see, so this post is actually a disguised Ironman with low crafting 
---
facts
---
Read the post title, read your reply, ponder.
---
It's not a poll issue, it's an integrity issue that needs to be implemented already. Especially in a month full of poll questions.
---
Ah my weekly dopamine rush is here
---
Ay it's here!
---
Poll suggestion. Poll gets 83%.
---
"We’ve worked directly with some high-level members of the community that this impacts"
---
- We are now not going to go through with the suggestion. Even though 83% of the community want it. 
---
Polls mean nothing. 
---
Is RS3 taking over OSRS in the background?
---
- Majority of players didn't ask for EoC, but they did it anyway. 
---
Well I guess with this assumption it's safe to say SpinToWin is closer than we thought boys.
---
I am so ready.
---
A minority of people were actually being homophobic. Most players just didn't want political statements within the game. Don't play pretend, please.
---
I don't particularly see why it should be locked behind a diary, as none of the other recolors are. Keys are nearly a more fitting requirement, but even then, I think there's a better way to handle it.
---
Red cape better
---
Began as bug abuse, is a gameplay mechanic now.
---
:O
---
Too fast
---
Yeah I mean they also said that mobile wouldn't change how the game is played on PC and the game is so much easier than it was even with AHK now thanks to mobile.
---
Enjoy your karma. Excuse me while I lock myself in my room for 15 minutes. 
---
He should've said "such as a 1/171 drop" lmao, would've pissed the guy off even more.
---
The problem with new content is the rewards. We are going to put a another reward to an already existing piece of content which already have a 500m and 200m drops. Because of muh nostalgia. Sorry that aint good enough. Again. I not agaisnt divine per say. I am more agaisnt wasting a reward possibility on a piece of content which on its own already has super valuable drops.
---
I like curry leaf picking Verf but I can't wait for pineapple picking Verf. 
---
Must be someone you know irl who would know a certain number you would use. Maybe a four digit code you have for your phone or a locker somewhere and a friend also knows the same so they would try it for your pin?
---
Just an example but if you've never given it away somehow in relation to RS, I truly believe it's someone you know personally.
---
dude did you just steal settled's karma?? not cool
---
Gratz alch it
---
Oh neat. I'll see you in 20 minutes depression
---
Why is that annoying though? I agree they could've just adjusted the numbers but why does it matter?
---
I was more looking for what was efficient for my level, not what could theoretically make money cause like you said anything can.
---
The chosen one. Finally a new episode Pog
---
Ultimate.
---
The bank told me they wouldn't hold onto my 654 raw chickens
---
Nut
---
Because the update had a massive oversight that they didn't think about and realized it would have massive balance breaking consequences to which most of the people who voted had no idea?
---
While I'm well versed on the issue, I'd imagine "unspecified abuse" is probably easily translated into "a lot of complaints". I can't see how this would be abused either. 
---
And now the waiting until the next episode is out begins..
---
It’s similar to all these new games trying to cash in on the battle royal format it’s pathetic to see the lack of originality 
---
Niche =/= shitty. Not everything needs to be BiS for everyone everywhere
---
It's less about level and more about achievements, barrows is less profitable and more annoying to get to without morytania hard diaries.
---
But I'd reccomend high enough mage to cast Iban's blast, and having done underground pass, plus at least 43 prayer, and enough defence to wear full rune at the very least. 
---

What's the point in voting in polls anymore ?????
---
STILL NO PICKLES!!!
---
.

---
Locking content out of the wilderness is bad game design. Why should I quest for BiS gloves when I want to pk? Why should I have to make money for BiS gear when I want to pk? 
---
Aww an update you wanted didnt make it into the game? Must feel bad to have content spite voted.
---
Swampletics. It’s a series that this guy releases every Wednesday, he’s a UIM self locked to Morytania with the ultimate goal of completing theater of blood
---
No skill in pvp? Pvp is probably one of the ONLY dimensions in this game that requires some sort of skill. ToB and inferno are the other 2. The rest is a time grind with minimal skill. 
---
I explained this in my comment, the difference is that the wilderness is the only region that lines you up against other players.
---
You must be new. No worries, I'll explain. The polls were added to OSRS in 2013 as a way to have the players decide future updates. This was due to the fact that we, as a community, decided that Jagex was not to be trusted and that we should decide updates. Jagex then added the feature, and ever since players have decided the game. Here we are 6 years later and they are now in the last 2 weeks going against the polling system 3 times. This should not be tolerated and I'm glad the community is speaking out at Jagex's actions.
---
Hope that helped!
---
I'm still learning so not that many yet, last trip I did a little over 20 I think. I take the best range Gear I have with ring of suffering and a arma cbow + twisted buckler. I also take a staff of light for blood barrage and it counts as zammy+sara item while walking there.
---
96 Def, 99 range &amp; mage and 94 pray.
---
since you didn't farm enough karma ealier you took it off and re-posted... cut the crap and stop posting it 
---
I read on another post some hackers know a flaw in the system to where they can brute Force your bank pin with unlimited tries
---
Upvote that shit
---
Should just say "Thanks!" and then delete it
---
Think people more easily associate divine with eoc and other bad updates and that turns them off to it. I agree, they should add it
---
The PvP community notoriously shoots down any PvP qol update. Anything at all no matter how small or how convenient. These sort of updates are invaluable to regular players and pvmers. Being able to click the spec orb would be life-changing at demonic gorillas.  And so jmods are forced to add all these non-PvP qualifiers so that the majority of players can enjoy it. 
---
Why are they so vehemently against any change? Thy say it's because it devalues their 'skill' at knowing where the buttons are, their learned muscle memory.
---
There is such a huge barrier of entry to PvP. You see posts on this subject all the time about how the PvP community is dying and how jagex could help. And here they are making qol updated that would lower entry and help a wider audience engage with the content. And it's all DOA.
---
Disclaimer: my only PvP experience is torvesta videos and getting killed while doing clues in the wildy, so this is an outsiders perspective
---
Idiot the spell is capped 
---
Will be OP for pvp.
---
I didn't notice any getting stolen lol, no hard feelings tho.  Thanks c:
---
fuck yes. haven't been this excited since last Wednesday.
---
I miss old Settled
---
YESSSS THANK GOD
---
Finally I can train my new Swampletics video locked ultimate ironman. 
---
The reason they "caved" wasn't because 0.1% of playerbase complained, it was because this would have been over 1m xp/hr for main accounts in crafting for a ridiculously cheap price.
---
Swampletics
---
Sick loot yo really good
---
Hey man, thanks for replying!  I didn't know if you would've left the post already since it was posted 11 days ago iirc.
---
Would you be on around 11pm EST tonight?  I can gather a couple of my friends and go learn alongside you.
---
My IGN is "Fight Cancer", please feel free to add as I will be adding you

Awesome! Thanks, I'll look into it. I don't even know how to level up most skills lmao. Right now I'm just trying to get my attack and smithing up lol. Don't know if that's even a good idea... but I'm rocking a black longsword with half of a bronze armor set LOL. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do in my skill level right now, but that guide will probably help. Thanks a lot!
---
Finally I've got a weeks worth of hog juice sitting here waiting. 
---
Just ban all players with 100+ combat
---
The rules clearly state to add a letter for flair, I legit didnt think it posted. What's your deal. My account is literally a month old. I've made 3 post and 1 accounts for most of my karma which I could care less about. Keep downvoting me bro. 
---
Im happy agaib
---
What's the point in polls and what's the point in voting if the integrity of the polls are over thrown. This game is meant to be run by the community 
---
seriously dude????
---
Because it completely devalues gwd and bandos in specific when you can last twice as long a trip. Also makes finding worlds to do bandos more tedious 
---
Instead of re-polling the divine spirit shield, why not save it and introduce it later on for some content in the future? Doesn’t have to be a divine spirit shield either to have those shield effects, it could be a new rare drop for an upcoming raid or something. I just don’t understand why they would so casually throw more power creep into the game when very few if anybody actually was calling for the divine ss to be put into the game, especially to content that already exists and has utility anyway. 
---
Y’all have years and years of content that will have to be made for this game, don’t rush to fill up the power creep meter so quickly!
---
Right are emulators even allowed? Not that I care either way just curious. I just know a lot of emulators act as a jailbroken phone etc so you can add auto clickers etc. I dont remember what it's called on blue stacks but I used to play lineage on blue stacks emulator and it copied your clicks and movements etc so it made account after account and did the first 10 levels automatically over and over again for me haha
---
If you are bringing a Divine/ely, you likely have a tbow. So the divine/ely won't be equipped while you're killing Zuk since you'll have a tbow.
---
has nothing to do with the update, it has everything to do how you're speaking to other people
---
Nice
---
So Jagex can choose not to add something ththe community wants despite it passing, but won't add something they believe will improve the game but wom't pass because of spite? What's the point of any of of really than? If you're worried aboabot game integrity be worried about it as a whole.
---
You did 20 kills with only armadyl crossbow?! What! That's insane! No chins??
---
Sad I didn’t get that name first :(
---
I remember about a year or 2 ago they mentioned how they eventually want to move all rewards over to other minigames/skills and then remove it entirely. I'd have to go back and find it when I get the chance.
---
I know with Warding they were gonna poll adding imbues to it. If Warding or that specific question failed, they said regardless they would be removing Imbues from NMZ and putting them somewhere else.
---
It's alright, but red cape was better tbh
---
Heh, nice try Giraffesex. You can't trick us into giving you control that easily.
---
im pretty sure everyone knows what a clue box is chief its just a joke
---
It’s okay I was on the toilet!!!!!
---
Holy fuck I didn't realize it was Wednesday. Time for that dopamine rush
---
I mean it's 50/50
---
I'll be honest, you fuckin' got me, hahaha.
---
This is hot!
---
I didn't know they existed until a month or 2 ago. Just wanted to make sure
---
The Small Fishing Net means you have JMod Angels watching over you
---
You have a link to his posts? 
---
the spellbook change would allow you to make the icon significantly larger, doesnt have anything to do with the rearanging since you can do that already with 3rd party clients
---
Why would I want a benefit for someone else besides me? /s
---
YES
---
I just wish I was in on the joke and understood :( 
---
After a long hard day, coming home to this is pure e*cstasy* 
---
He used 5 accounts to do what he could do on one.. you can own all the recolors on 1 account. There is no way you can argue this is normal... there's no debate.
---
You can buy death runes from the zankrak mage aswell. Easy 1m/hour
---
So ready.
---
yeah honestly i was with them w. the whole "we're going to make it slower" thing but jesus that's so much iron money poofed for low-mid level accounts
---
I mean there us no guarantee that when you flip a coin that it ever lands on heads
---
Yees another dopamine rush
---
trading post didnt work fine, because it only showed selling offers and not buying offers. it was extremely annoying to use as well. GE passed because people realized that it was basically good for everyone, and the merching clan things in RS2 was only a problem because of the trade limit.
---
&gt;  So was changing corp instances specifically for IM accounts
---
They did that because people were actively crashing ironmen after they had spec tabbing the boss for like 20 mins. Doesn't seem arbitrary to me.
---
You got some Jmods tossing you some gifts in the form of a net
---
You little stupid ass bitch. 
---
"Bait" is a very common internet term for a joke/troll post.  
---
And you're such a hypocritical loser that it isn't even funny. You say you "just want to chill in games", yet you go out of your way to make yourself a victim by falling for obvious scams that anybody with two brain cells to rub together would see coming a mile away. Why would you trade ANYBODY on a PVP server? It just makes no fuckin' sense and you deserve to lose your in-game wealth at that point for being such a gullible nobhead.
---
"Tyranny" despite the fact for the last 6 years the community is the reason the game is in the great spot it is...
---
&gt; Why do dumb fucks like you make ironmen,
---
Assuming I even play an iron LOL, which I dont so the change doesnt effect me even a little bit...so im not crying about shit bud. 
---
Theres no reason not to make filling buckets of sand less than the complete aids it is, 50 hours of filling up buckets is not fun game play at all. Theres absolutely no harm in making it better, even if it isnt 6x faster..like I said 3x would be completely fine.
---
And like I said 3x faster is still a lot of work and earning your achievements so your argument about me being against "actually having to put some effort into earning your achievement" is completely false. Spending 50 hours to fill up a fuckin bucket is dumb as shit, since you then have to also spend a shit ton of time actually crafting. 
---
Your only argument is "well I suffered and it sucked so everyone else should suffer through aids gameplay", it has nothing to do with working for something. You dont have any legitimate argument besides wanting other people to have to suffer through some unnecessarily shitty gameplay.

I've had a theory about why people hat Pkers so much. Now, I must be honest I really don't like Pkers because it's not a part of content I like to participate in, but I understand it's part of the game and when you go into the wilderness there is always that risk. That being said, I think the problem with getting PvP content passed is that all people, to some degree, need skilling and pvm for the simple task of progression. Because of this, pvpers and Pkers can both get behind good skilling/PvM updates. On the flip side, it is not required to kill other players to progress your account in any way, so when a strict PvMer is forced into a Pking situation they don't want to be in, they are automatically frustrated and resent the person who killed them. There's also the notion that, with the exception of crashing, PvMer's can't directly impact somebody else's experience in the game. Even with crashing, it's as simple as hopping world's until you find an empty one. Pkers, on the other hand, directly change what happens to a player while they're trying to complete some other task. Whether it's clue hunting, bossing, skilling or slaying, Pkers can always negatively impact what you're doing and in a fairly significant way. I think these are the reasons there is such a separation when it comes to PvP updates. Everyone, to some degree, is a PvMer and a skiller, but not everyone is a pker.

---
I completely agree with you. But this is normal slayer we are talking about though, it's not like it takes nearly the effort of gwd and bosses.
---
For bosses, I absolutely agree luck and unique drops are the way to go. But for something as afk as killing fire giants? Consistency would be the way to go, no need to over-award players for something with no effort. The current drop table is almost perfectly suited for this.
---
Nice 
---
I completely agree with you. But this is normal slayer we are talking about, it's not like it takes nearly the effort of gwd and bosses and thus should not equat to similar types of drops.
---
But the point still stands, just dont use it. I also dont care and would personaly not use it. My response was to the guy above saying why it couldnt be used in pvp.
---
Careful he don’t hit you with a car
---
How is lvl 70 not low? Its 737k experience, and thieving is 100k per hour from 45, 150k ish from 55, and 200k+ish from 65. You can quest to get to 45. You could get 1 to 80 or 85 in a single day. Thieving is one of the very few skills that can achieve insane xp rates before you even hit 50.
---
"The purity is damaged but will recover over time" reminds me of my virginity
---
What an absolute legend. 
---
That's the joke.
---
Jagex with the sneaky Swampletics buff with the fishing net.
---
&gt; Considering the price of a bucket of sand is at 68 gp on the g/e right now and that you can buy buckets of sand for charter's at 5 gp each, this makes it non-viable for everyone.
---
It was an update for ironmen who you know... can't use the GE.
---
21 minutes and 26 seconds before my depression resumes
---
He has 2 hunter now, see you next time.
---
I'd buy him more tea to seduce my girlfriend.
---
You're not a nice guy just a fool.
---
Do you honestly believe PKers represent over 25% of the voting player base? Most people who play to PK only don't even pay attention to polls. You'll see when these polls pass by 80%, if that.
---
In fact, these polls fuck PKers: Adam said he may remove the prayer swapper plugin from Runelite if it passes. Something I'd argue we rely on especially considering half of bridding is switching prayers. This time I'm voting no just because of that: my muscle memory is for eagle eye and mystic might, but I still want to use augury and rigour on my med. 
---
Because sandstone is compacted sand. It'd need to be broken apart first. That's what I meant.
---
Because, almost all content is directed to be person VS game, not person VS person.
---
*dopamine
---
As they should, people act like playing this game for 100 hours and having 750 total makes them in anyway capable of knowing what direction to take the meta of a skill. 
---
I suggested 50 days played or 1750 total to vote and got downvoted by the noobs who think they understand rs enough to influence the game direction. 
---
W
---
I agree with this a lot. They certainly rushed it to the polls and realized their mistake after but it’s a little late at that point. I think it would have been better for them to maintain integrity by introducing the change into the game as voted upon and then afterwards implementing/polling a nerf to the rate (similar to what happened with bird nests). 
---
When you have a baby and wanna brag about it 10m after birth...

omfg finding a world to do bandos is insane atm
---
Heh, didn't censor the kid, thanks for the account. 
---
Crafting is already easy as it is with giant seaweed. The crafting cape is extremely useful, which is why making the skill way too easy is a bad idea.
---
It says RE-RUNS. Not skilling, read the titles.
---
He's probably researched well enough to know that it would be his final exception for the goals he has in mind
---
Because instead of tuning the concept, they are completely scrapping it when it was polled and passed. It's a blatant disregard for the wishes of the community on something *they* thought of.
---
IMO it's better to at least _think_ of it in terms of "last exception" so that the first instinct isn't to just hop out of the area whenever a roadblock is hit
---
Offer my cheeks and ask for tea too
---
Funny cause you have the same name as a Taylor Swift song
---
Ah yes the player base that voted majority in favor of keeping 200k/hr afk mage xp with profit. These are the people they should be listening to lmao
---
But usually you’re at least getting some kind of xp while doing it, shopping is a little different because it’s spending time so you can spend time to get xp. 
---
Yea, stoppng content because of this is pretty stupid. This is why the spellbook/prayerbook sorting QoL is very important.
---
barrage being the size of the entire interface just makes bridding more of a joke 
---
&gt;The point of this update wasn't to make it faster to collect sand, it was to make it less aids.
---
I guess? I think many people would disagree, though. A far more active method *should* give more sand, especially when compared to buying from shops.
---
95 and did it all on charters. I have to say that any changes that make it less aids than charters should be coming into the game. Charters is already 70k an hour. Try to pass that with giant seaweed...
---
\&gt; and you can buy buckets of sand at charter's at 5 gp each
---
They also did a comparison, which makes the new method equivalent to charter's if you do tick manipulation and have 99 mining.
---
So to run it down for you:
---
\- It costs more;
---
\- It's a longer process (You have to mine sandstone and then grind it);
---
\- It's less efficient.
---
If it was more efficient it would be useful for iron men, if you made profit from it, it would be useful for normal accounts. Right now it's neither.
---
Slayer ⏫ goes up

damn nice snowflake ironman, first checking for username only ironman i've ever heard of.

Thats the hypest lvl 2 hunter ever.

This series is like a bond for my life
---
I think people forget that what made divine even more broken in singles back in the day was nex armors/brew flasks/curses/bonfire buffs. I honestly dont think it would be THAT great definitely powerful though.
---
I agree. 
---
What does settled have planned for Hunter? Any Morytania experts have ideas?
---
Okay, but you still get Buckets of Sand slower, which is the complaint. I'd much rather receive no Mining experience and faster sand, or somewhere in between.
---
Season 2 is pretty good so far. I think a Swampletics Movie would be absolute hype.
---
Today just became a good day
---
&gt;  I wish a J-mod would reply with the reasoning behind Authenticator removal delay has never been addressed.
---
It has been addressed multiple times on the Q&amp;A. They essentially just said they didn't want people to get angry and spam their support when they lose their phones because you would have to wait that delay.
---
It isn't the answer most people would want to hear but it has been addressed before.

My favorite blue cape memory was the 2nd dopamine oak plank. Those were the days

Speaking from personal experience (and from what I've noticed), new players generally tend to keep their heads down and try to figure out things on their own. It's pretty easy to feel self-conscious when you haven't really leveled much
---
E

hey we're already seeing runelite plugins that essentially automate tribridding, may as well implement a captcha solver too

What do you reckon? Could it have been planted to make the series more interesting and less monotonous? The series is taking off and I'm sure Jagex are well aware of its success.
---
Best series I have ever watched!
---
Literally sat all day at home ill refreshing youtube now and again waiting for this to be uploaded. The dopamine rush is real
---
With 50 runecrafting, you can make 2.5m an hour being a rune essence runner at zmi 
---
It wasn't super exciting but it unlocks a lot of stuff. He pretty much just unlocked barrows armors. I mean, before, if he was using barrows stuff and died that equipment was pretty much just gone. Now it makes it a lot more practical to use and go for them.

Theres always so much anticipation for episodes and now u end this one with a teaser like that? Man how am i gonna be able to wait a week... 
---
Not an Ironman; but pretty sure teams are more efficient 
---
I mean... I voted yes to the original method, so relax. I was simply saying they wanted some way to process Sandstone into Buckets of Sand, and that made sense. It's okay, even in a fantasy game like OSRS, for things to make sense.
---
Woah. Take it easy, man. 
---
The unavoidable damage would be avoidable with divine and cost prayer points instead. I think the ely already works this way, but overall less damage soak for 0 cost. (which is also why ely is actually more useful than divine, and always was.)
---
A spirit shield with BiS prayer bonuses might be a bit too strong, considering their already high defence.
---
Sounds very cool and love the idea leadership and commitment to your members. I’m only like 67 combat but i wish you guys the best of luck :)
---
Dont have to be, divine drains your prayer also so you have to use more supplies
---
I got my account back! Thank you very much for the help bud. Now I just have to figure out what I was doing before I stopped playing for 4 years :P
---
Devalues my small fishing net collection 
---
Offer to train runecrafting on his account
---
Could the speed of emptying and filling compost bins be made faster? 
---
With the upcoming volcanic ash buff you'll be able to mine more ultra fertile soil spell casts worth of ash in the same time it takes to fill compost bins for bottomless compost charges. It takes 3 minutes total to mine the ash, manually empty, harvest the allotment near the bin, and fill the compost bin (the farming guild's bin), which results in 60 ultracompost charges for the bucket. 
---
In those same 3 minutes, at 67+ mining, you can mine 160 ash which equals 80 ultra fertile soil casts, which is assuming a rate of 800 ash/hr before the nerf. (800*4= 3200/20 = 160 ash per 3 min).
---
As it stands for ironmen the time it takes emptying and filling bins simply takes too long. Doubling the speed or doubling the capacity (or a mixture of both) of bins would give the bucket back that usefulness back. 
---
my favorite conspiracy theory
---
though tbh its probably an oversight to NOT have fishing equipment near what is kind of a big fishing spot
---
I waited all day refreshing youtube. You uploaded it the minute I got to work. Oh well, at least I have something to look forward to when I get off. 
---
It's the new opening for swampletics season 2
---
not worth the time, would be considerably faster to train woodcutting through teaks/redwoods and make the money for construction, don't forget you need to make the planks after you cut the logs which will be expensive and time consuming, but if you enjoy it go for it :)
---
I’ll have you know he is 40,320 minutes old thank you very much 
---
Slower xp/hr but only need to click once every 20-30 minutes 
---
 I'm afraid you've squandered the remaining faith I had in you, and thus I will be taking my viewership elsewhere. I wish you good luck with the rest of your Morytania-only-but-only-when-it's-convenient-Ironman. And with that, sir, I bid you bonjour. 
---
It comes with a catch. I can only wear God items affiliated with Brassica Prime, and I only eat cabbage.
---
Sorry, too many people upset about Jagex upholding even the tiniest standard of game integrity has my nipples all twisted
---
He must’ve found some training method that gives very frequent and small xp drops that can get him to 27 hunter 
---
Blue cape Swampletics made an exception with the saw. Red cape Swampletics made an exception with King Roald. Green cape Swampletics is going to be the pure cape.
---
&gt; In PvP situations, sure it might be a good for low level singles (edge) but in multi or deep wild You don't have a BoB to carry an absurd amount of restores nowadays. If you get hit by a clan you're screwed. In PvM it's worse than ely in every way. Even in inferno because of the prayer drain.
---
Exactly why it isn't needed at all. It failed the polls already and arguably has no purpose. Pass. 
---
Amazing content bro, keep it up
---
What content can you do to get xp at 2 hunter?
---
it probably dose nothing i know, but I have had problems in the past.
---
You sure its med clue? looks more like a hard clue reward
---
hence the throw away
---
Yeah he prob had a pipe wrench of a cock
---
Boo hoo, he put a numerous amount of hours into it to set up for more videos, idiot, downvoted
---
&gt;charters should be the alternative, not the other way around.

Agreed. Active methods like the one being suggested should definitely cost less gold and give more sand per hour.

Considering the fungus is probably around 600 gp in the GE right now (I am not actually sure) you could probably get 700-800 fungus per hour I'm guessing. Lets call it ball park 500k gp / hr. Bond in 5-6 hours.

This would result in pures getting access to vengeance, heavy ballista, and maybe better rfd gloves? Not sure if adamant gloves has a defence requirment on top of the xp you need to claim in order to get them in the first place.

I see, my mistake
---
Dopamine overload

Look at the video clips, there's no net in the house.

I disagree. There are other area locked, and they break so many rules. It really makes people lose interest because it becomes just another Ironman.

My only thought is hes found a way to speed up getting randoms thus decreasing time between lamps

I really can’t think there is anything else in Morytania that would give small amounts of hunter xp

They added a teasing stick drop to karamja. Can't find a suitable link, but it was recent

Haven’t been doing either of those tbh I was just doing herb/allotment runs, will definitely be doing them now tho. ty

As with every update if you can get a few people to spam tweet jagex employees you basically control the development for some reason 
---
bot detection is pretty much a joke at this point, minus f2p suicide botters/common public scripts 
---
any private/semi-private script is gonna be very safe and have very very little ban rate unless it's a really common goldfarming method.

people have botted 50m+ xp at wintertodt 247 without a ban lol

What method was this?

Very rarely this is maybe the first time that wasn't for engine work reasons 
---
How would a minigame to remove a character from the game be a better use of dev time than simply making existing, iconic citizens the achievement masters (e.g. Duke of Lumbridge, King of Varrock, etc.)?
---
Yea it adds up. But the divines strength is in keeping you alive through bursts of damage, not giving you sustain. 
---
No it wouldnt be that great, ely would be better in general still. It might be useful in chambers of xeric, but dps is still meta anyways.

Where you can only play if you can be seen in the background of any swamplectics video. If he's not on, you're not on. If hes on, you better be in screen view because IM WATCHIN MOTHER FUCKER

Yeet

Don't let these two assholes bring you down. Be proud of yourself, you did something tough.

Is it? I wasn’t aware.

no pls add more and more BiS items or else whats even the point
---
Inb4 rs3
---
Pro tip, find a part of the item name that is uncommon and type that to make searching faster and more accurate. 
---
Eg. yew logs = "w lo".
---
Cannonball = "NBA"
---
Super restore = "r res"
---
Just scrap the sand idea. And for fucks sake stop designing the game around ironmen.
---
What a load of shit
---
Not everyone who banked sandstone was cheating.
---
Sure, abusing the 5kg spawn is probably cheating, but a lot of people started legit mining sandstone in preparation.
---
Well that was quick. 
---
I do feel that Jagex needs to work more on UI stuff to be more competitive with Runelite and the like. It seems like the “QoL” stuff like breaking down sandstone to sand is rather trivial in the grand scheme of things. There’s a way to do it already; if it’s slow, welcome to RuneScape. 
---
Superglassmake with sandstone and giant seaweed would have been over 1m xp/hr. Do you REALLY believe that most of the people voting on this knew that when they voted?
---
It would have been over 1m xp/hr and SUPER CHEAP

&gt; @JagexAsh Can a teasing stick become a spawnable item or obtainable from a crate near the different pitfall traps? Similar to the bird snare/box trap around the Zeah hunter spot.

That's what he would've thought before this saw problem arised though.

&gt; Well the entire point of OSRS is that the community decides everything

[Hmmmmm](https://i.imgur.com/XEhITA5.png)
---
28 days of work for 200k...... ouch
---
They reverted the update because they didn't know what to do about the unintended consequence.
---
If they add it with some cap as to the xp/hr that you can get to keep it in line I wouldn't care. Infact I'd be more than fine with that.
---
So I just got the lance, lucky claw drop and this thing is fucking straight trash, I'd love to sell it but worried they will buff it.
---
jesus redditors are so cringy over this
---
Wow, nice catch.
---
Ohhh okay got ya
---
The point being to let pures reset to 1 defence if they hit 2 or 3? Imagine if you hit 501 xp? I support pures being able to get their 1 defence back, but kind of hard doing it properly. Also is there no content that pures can unlock that gives less than 580ish defence xp?
---
I’d say it’s more along the lines of,
---
To PK and have a decent chance at defeating people near your CB level you either need a very specific pure that takes many hours to build OR you need to be maxed.
---
That and all the toxic asshole clans.
---
The Dragon Defender had an image in the original poll. As for the Barrier, I think they meant an invisible barrier that would prompt you with a warning when crossing, kinda like Farming Guild Doors.
---
I die in wild. Pker bad.
---
To the top of the thread!
---
I'm familiar with the pvp community and do some pvp myself, but I feel your post isn't accurate in a number of ways. (though I'll admit up-front that I recognize some PvP players do hold opinions similar to what you stated)
---
These changes as written don't reduce the barrier of entry to pvp, they increase it. Spell icon resizing and prayer/spell positioning \_would not work in PvP\_, so PvMers who might become familiar with some particular setup outside of PvP would not be able to use that same setup if they wanted to try to make an entry to PvP.
---
Regardless of my feelings on any particular question I feel these changes would, as polled, further the divide between the PvM and PvP communities by making them almost into separate game modes with different rules about how the game works.
---
The entire next episode is going to be about discovery stuff tho, a new method of gaining hunter xp he wasn't aware of before.
---
Why would you vote for another one then

Why not show the diary?

Huh, TIL. This will be perfect for midterms!

1 player can only attack defensively and cannot wield weapons.

The other cannot train defense.

This entire game has looked like a private server for years. Has anyone ever been to the nightmare zone?

I had a similar experience earlier this week. So for the last two years, I’ve been picking flax as a money maker. I have about 700 hours or so in the fields. I had just made enough money to afford a bond so I could finally stop paying $11 a month on this dumbass game. As I walked into the ge, I noticed this guy saying that he takes your money, and gives you twice as much in return. I thought this was a pretty sweet deal, I could buy 2 bonds now! Sadly he logged out right after I traded over the cash. Oh well, back to the flax fields I guess.

Nah exceptions ruin single location ironmen. They should be treated as super dirty and rarely done, even when totally necessary and fair like this. Totally killed my interest in so many people's videos. When they strawpoll the viewers and everyone votes yes for them to basically cheat.

you need a net for hunter

Katarina Hartlova is so great

Yep. My 8m per 4 hours for 10mins of flipping an item with a constant 1mil margin is less efficient than spending an hour and a half at a job I hate. Keep telling yourself that, friend.
---
As a level 99 I support this notion, lets get this polled as\[
---
The same reasoning of "we know better than the players" is what caused eoc and RS3 to get the go ahead. The entire existence of the polls is because the community vocally refused to trust jagex when it comes to osrs updates.

Not bug abuse. Its not a bug, and its certainly not abuse, since JageX have acknowledged the method (now intended to be in the game) so re-phrase to: non-bug use. I cant expect you to know this though. 
---
And being maxed doesnt mean youre free from feeling lazy and entitled. Plenty of maxed normies.
---
Feel like this should be tagged "spoiler"
---
Then why the fuck do you want this shit sand method retard.
---
Nah, its the only way to train a skill. I think its okay to give them the bare minimum.
---
If it doesn’t give good exp which it wouldn’t have because of the cap there would be no demand for sandstone 
---
73/75/70 att/str/def. I figured out how to add grind NMZ so if I wanted them to be higher I guess that's an easy way.
---
Magic is pretty crap, like 56. Would need a bit of gold for spamming HA but I mostly put it off because I didn't want to spam HA.

bruuhhh 2 hunter

In one of his streams, he said he's actually going to be doing ToB with other morytania-locked ironmen.  Not necessarily UIM, but morytania-locked.
---
Oh shit, i wonder in which patch they secretly added that one
---
Because autism has trouble with the non-literal
---
Yeah...maybe everything OUTSIDE of grinding filling up buckets for a week, this isnt an argument for the  crafting skill as a whole so not sure why youre even bothering to mention it.
---
The point is a specific method that is a method every iron uses (again I dont even play an iron, just the logic behind not improving it makes 0 sense) is unnecessarily painful. You must be forgetting that filling up the buckets is simply the first part, you still have to spend another 50+ hours actually training the skill. The amount of time spent and what you have to do in order to actually train the skill is just as horrible as sitting there mining. Training a skill and how enjoyable it is, is something that is subjective anyway...but EVERYONE objectively hates filling up freakin buckets and the amount of time you have to spend doing it to actually train the skill. 
---
Again, the only argument youre making is that it sucks a shit ton to do but it should still stay the same because...why again? Because everybody should suffer because you have had to? Game integrity isnt an argument because it has little to no impact on it, youre just grasping at straws trying to find a legitimate reason why it shouldnt be sped up to some level, maybe not 6x faster though.

But this doesn't alleviate any of his limitations. As far as I can tell, the net doesn't circumvent any obstacle whatsoever. In fact, all it does it open up more content for him too. Net positive. 
---
People shouldn't be focusing on the 100gp/sand.  Obviously thats insane but we should be focusing on the fact that a very decent and popular update passed but was randomly not implemented because some "high level players" (ironman who already have 99 crafting) complained to jagex.    Give us infinite sand and the xp rate will probably only go up to like 90k/h 
---
How many ironmans have untrimmed cooking though? I got it on my ironman because it’s kind of unconventional and I’ve never seen anyone else with one
---
Oh derp! I see now haha Thanks bud! 
---
That's how I felt when making the trap version of the drake and josh theme song
---
 it wouldn't be morytania only then
---
He's going to force randoms by training one skill and doing another after 15 minutes I used to do it back in the day
---
Still wishing it had been polled, I've been in MLM so I haven't gotten to officially see it for myself. Ughh. Lumbridge and Draynor no longer appear how they originally were anywhere.... could've at least just put a rowboat and not a whole dock.
---
sit kid, swamp hat best hat
---
I don’t think they are referring to exp about this..? They might be talking about cash per hour. Not sure though. 
---
What cap? The cap with the update would be 1080 xp/cast.
---
I think a fair penance would be to break the tainted tool store after picking up a fresh saw and new planks 
---
imagine taking dfs and lance into wildy
---
oh fuck yeah, please?
---
No need to poll that, its a integrity issue.
---
Probably because it's all everyone's talking about. Maybe the video series uses dramatic music that excites you.
---
How was I in any way being edgy you fucking meme spouting idiot 
---
&gt;ironmeme07
---
is it tho?
---
Bruh when did he do a face reveal ?
---
ya I don't know who you think I am but having two alts that have both done ds2 sounds a little bit high autism for me
---
I'm honestly kind of scared for the integrity of this game longterm when people unironically ask why doubling the current max xp/hr of a skill (which is already the second fastest skill) is bad LOL
---
How can you turn this into something negative? Jagex did great, 'everything' passes nowadays and they polled an incorrect solution to an existing problem and corrected it when they realized - by the help of reddit that the solution can be done much better than what they had thought of.
---
No you’re right, you’re the only one on reddit that knew what dopamine was until last week
---
what the actual fuck does your comment even mean
---
&gt; I'd much rather receive no Mining experience and faster sand
---
Yeah make it like 5k XP/h or something but significantly better sand
---
He could have built decorative rocks with limestone after only level 5 construction...
---
The Dorg crossbow is better than the mithril one, rune with broad bolts and up is the only crossbow better. If you're training, you're best off using darts/knives or even a shortbow. Crossbows are really bad xp/hour.
---
just for you ;)
---
OneChunkMan?
---
Aaanndd there goes all poll integrity... Pretty pathetic.
---
No, it's not. Part of the region lock is that you are locked out of things that aren't obtainable in your region
---
Agreed. That's another reason why it's kind of weird that he would want this change to be implemented.
---
Like I get doing your account and thinking "man I wish I had XYZ, that'd be nice", but to actually try and make those changes yourself is different.
---
Also, I'm not sure if I like the idea in general of Jagex throwing bones to these random snowflakes. What happens when Karamja only asks for some net or some other bs? The reason ash added that thing was "so that Dragula will have a little bit better time playing runescape" and I personally don't think that's cool.
---
I didn’t say that. Just saying the word dopamine was rarely used. now it’s being used everywhere 
---
Don't worry bois, I am coming for Slayermusiq's clout. Working on a bunch of videos. 
---
Once I'm done with the videos, I'll be going for that b gloves record on Reddit.
---
i hope it pases lads!
---
Wtf r u talking about I’m clearly arguing against it. Wow. I feel bad now. Didn’t realize I was arguing with an actual developmentally disabled autismo
---
The funny part is once people actually get it, they will realize it's almost useless if you have been playing for a while since you've already developed muscle memory for the current setup.
---
You cant get smited if you smite yourself
---
Using the term ‘normie’ is edgy.
---
😩😭🙏
---
On what basis are you saying the proposed solution was incorrect?
---
/u/SettledRS How do you feel about the community backing you on Project: Swampletics? 
---
I'd really like to know! 
---
You’re also paying a significant amount of gp for that mining exp at 100gp per bucket of sand. I believe that gp would have to be factored in if looking at an efficiency standpoint because that’s time as well. 
---
Seriously what is the context of this image?
---
Collecting resources by skilling in 2k19? Haven't you heard of slayer and PvM? Skilling is so 2007...
