Inquisitor set + mace is better dps than bandos + scythe on tekton for any number of hammer specs 
---
It’s better dps than bandos + rapier on any slayer task that isn’t specifically outrageously strong to crush
---
It’s better dps off-task than bandos+rapier anywhere off task that isn’t outrageously strong to crush. 
---
It’s better dps than anywhere dwh specs are largely effective 
---
- Places where bandos is better 
---
1. For tanking gwd 
---
2. ToB because you don’t dwh verzik, bloat, or nylo/although debatable because you dwh maiden, Xarpus, and bloat has virtually no defense anyways with salve(e) accuracy buff
---
3. That’s about it. 
---
Most slayer monsters that you afk already aren’t so accurate to which the def bonuses from bandos would outweigh the increased dps from the crush accuracy in pair with the mace. The inquisitor set also has a decent prayer bonus so if you use protect from mele, the lack of defense is moot. 
---
This (imo) is genuinely not ok for its placement in terms of levels required to wear it. Especially under the assumption that due to nightmare having SO many drops and it *likely* following the trend of armor pieces being more common than weapons; it would presumably be relatively common.
---
A better balancing solution would be to lower the Str bonus and give it a set effect to make up the difference (similar to obsidian, but in this case more viable) to which it would still hold its niche equally the same for limited def accounts and *some* off-task instances. Or they could just raise the defense req since the increased crush accuracy is already insane for dwh specs and especially with the mace
---
I just thanked you then, why would I do it later aswell?

Saying Husky has 0 Corp kc on his iron is kind of disingenuous don't you think? That'd assume that Husky was the only person involved in this update and the decision to have the Siren's Charm be an attachment for the Mage's Book, would would be far from the case. 
---
Arcane Spirit Shield will still have use elsewhere in the game, just not everywhere it used to be used. Siren's Tome has *worse* defensive stats than Mage's Book, plus a -5 prayer bonus. The Arcane still has +5 accuracy over the Siren's Tome too. This is just reddit reeing over an update that "devalues" their previous achievements and possibly decreases their bank value.

It always upsets me when people get so involved in politics thinking people are actually actively pursuing their best interests.
---
Like anyone that is mainstream enough to become a president doesn't give a shit about you. If we do get something for the people it's only to benefit the buisness partners and ex ceo's of major industries.
---
For instance when we asked for free health care in America we got this fucked up corperate moshposh where the corperations are allowed to jack up the prices of their drugs because the state is taking the bill any ways.
---
We want healthier food for kids, we get corperations fighting for that spot on their plate at school. shoveling down different processed shitty foods from different grains/fats that haven't had all the nutrition sucked out of it from abusive factory farming.
---
If even someone that was Independent and didn't take part in this soap opera called politics became president it's not like he would have the backing of Congress or any other people because they're all revolving door ex ceo's and major industry heads who will just stiffle anything that the president has to do. Those Industry leaders are the ones who fund all the campaigns and write the laws, not the president.

I'm complaining about the general sentiment on this subreddit from a really large number of people that new gear should only ever fill niches and NEVER be stronger than any other commonly used items.
---
have you done the stronghold of security already for 10k?
---
the early game when you dont know anything is one of the best experiences you can have on rs, and you can only really have it once. id recommend not looking up too many guides
---
I mean it is worth mentioning that the way they set up polls it seems like the only options are ''Add this new item this exact way'' or ''Item will not be added'', without an option that says something like ''good idea, but not with the current stats'' and a lot of people are going to vote yes simply for the added content. A simple mention that if it fails it will be looked at for a rebalance and then repolled would go a long way.
---
I think Wolf even mentioned they would consider this for the future after the Basilisk Jaw backlash, so either they didn't actually consider it, or don't want to do it.
---
Then again most people probably don't care about new items being too strong or devaluing other very rare items anyway, so good chance it would still pass
---
Now we get a fucking gnome shield.

I'm not saying I have been hacked before but its definitely not impossible for anyone to hack u even with 2fa it's still possible but that's not the point of the post the point was to have someone insure ur items so if u ever somehow lose them and the biggest upside would be how much gold would leave the game

I think not playing RS helps. I used to, and had no real goals, and didn’t feel the need because RS fulfilled that for me. It was hard to quit, but it’s been night and day.

&gt; I'm assuming an artist working on an old MMO from 2001 for a poor salary would be passionate about it.
---
As opposed to working on an old MOBA from 2004, am I right? You might wanna stop making assumptions then. By the logic youre using here 100% of all JageX employees are passionate, you might wanna be more careful in your assessments unless you really want to make "passion" be diluted and redundant. 
---
Im gonna try and be careful now. I would say Ash is pretty passionate about his job. Worked for the company since 2004. Works overtime without extra pay. Responds to all tweets. Paid out $10000 out of his own pockets to a player of the game hes developing for. Now, stop throwing "passionate" around as if things dont have a meaning.

---
You should bring the highest level defensive gear you've got. Most of the enemies there can just be run past. A few are higher level and you should bring food in case they hit you while you're running by.
---
\&gt; Guardians benefit from the crush bonus from armor because you use the pickaxe on crush.   
---
Accuracy bonuses to non spec hits are not very important - I'd much sooner get the avernic than get this, since I assume it won't be cheap.
---
Someone understands.

Well hello there, Tim Allen biker boy. It seems you have unknowingly stumbled upon The Savage Prophecy, you little shat. Go to Youtube and type in "25 Buttholes" with the quickness or my savage goons will light you up.

Now drink the concoctiooooonnnnnn.

What the actual fuck is this ?! Please no
---
Yeah that's a fair point. Guess it probably will devalue bandos, at least in places where defence doesn't matter. Defence does matter at Cerberus for instance. People will still use Justiciar Faceguard though.

---
Where ever the def actually matters. Which won't be a lot of places. 
---
I think even in both raids inquisitor will replace bandos, despite the difference bandos makes over say void. Mostly due to how important dwh specs are on some bosses.

&gt;You could always just go grind out the book yourself on your main.
---
I did that for 3 years. In the end, it was a waste of time. It doesn't even come close to the freedom and enjoyment that an actual iron provides.
---
&gt;It’s sad you HAVE to play an iron to avoid using the GE.
---
It's not sad, it's just what works for me. I could equally look at mains trapped in the Vorkath/Zulrah/Raids ratrace and be sad for them, but I understand that's just how they want to play the game. It's not for me, but it works for them and that's all that matters. My only regret is starting as a main, given I already had one in RS2. Ironman was always the way to play the game for me, and I wasted 3 years of progression by not acknowledging that earlier.
---
Im all for a repoll. It was apart of runelite and no one complained, then it was polled and failed by a few %. Some pkers are scared that noobs being able to change their prayer arraignment will make pking “too easy” and those noobs in turn will be pk gods and destroy them should they be able to reorder prayers.

See that's a good explanation. I played runescape classic when I was a kid but I never became a member, so coming back for me was basically the same until I became a member. Can't you just not play the content if you don't approve of it?

I guess if it was impossible to go pk without the new stuff I could see the issue, but then people are running around in the wild with 1b value gear.

I don't know enough about high end content I guess.

This just in; higher up suits only care about profit in their company designed to make profit.

But we need new shiny content with inflated stats to keep the game interesting! Nothing more exciting than having a higher number :)

It’s almost as if when a PvP player attacks a PvM(e) player in the wildy —ya know the ONE place in the game this interaction can happen with a surplus of warnings (outside of minigames of PvP worlds) — the PvM player isn’t the first to make a toxic comment toward the attacking player. Which that is most often the case in my experience. If I’m doing something in the wildy and someone attacks me; my response is always “gl” because unless you’re in multi, it’s actually hard to die. The VERY few times I manage to die, I say “gf” and they respond the same 
---
Sincerely, someone who partakes in both aspects of the game (more pvm nowadays because the wildy is lowkey dead).

Jagex has a relatively small team of devs, do you want them to spend a ton of time designing something that lasts 2 weeks of the year or use that time to work on actual content?

---
Not weird bro my club plays this joint every weekend and everyone turns up on the dance floor
---
Thank you Jagex for making my childhood great
---
No idea why but that was the first teleport spot I decided to look at and was confused for a moment.
---
It is unfortunate and probably a reason why jagex has such shitty turn over rates. But by this point it's a self perpetual shit ball that keeps getting bigger as it roles on.
---
Less dedicated people want to work for jagex, more people harass jagex, jagex hired less and less relevant people, people keep name calling them.
---
I don't think there is a good way out, and we are past the glory days of old school RuneScape when the dev team was just 4 dudes that where just supposed to maintain the game.
---
There now most likely micro managers and hr departments sucking the work space dry. Once they set up the team they have to convince shareholders that they are still working, and in a position like that if you don't bring back any good news or anything that can be improved you are kind of a useless asset, so your only option is to micro manage and deplete your human resources of anything meaningful. 
---
It's just a bunch of corperate busy body's who only know how to manage people, creating and leading the direction of the game. So while I don't agree personally with the misdirection of anger to the employees them selves who are miss treated I do stand up for the resentment to jagex the company itself. Probably a lot of what the team has to do is make content we will enjoy then prove to shareholders what they did being like " look we got more twitch views from twisted league and 2k more memberships, we need more x resources because we think it can make you more money" and we don't get to see that side. Jagex tells us what content they want us to make and all we really get to say is no, and why.
---
There was a time where jagex and the shareholders still thought rs3 was the cash cow, and osrs was on a blissful time with probably a stupid low over head, and raw but potent updates. A lot of them bad for late game health but it was a different feeling, a different Game, a different team.
---
The shift of money and attention that has been switched over sense mobile has changed a lot, and in a way the game doesn't feel the same. Too many people come and go, many of which don't even play the game. All trying to put their personal spin on it, with no one liking it. They're just trying to do their job, with the experience that higher ups thought they needed and they get shit on, which in turn probably threatens their likely hood of remaining there. It sounds stressful. I feel nothing but bad for them.
---
who does that for fun tho?
---
That sounds like an awesome idea
---
Sigh.

Because more than 50% more people have slayer than hunter.

160k xp/hr... Lmao, the old Reddit exaggeration strikes again.
---
The base cast exp for fire surge is 50.5, and its max hit is 54 on task or so (average hit of 27). This averages out to 50.5 + 27*2 = 104.5 exp/cast. You can cast a maximum of 1200 spells/hr (6000 ticks/hr, 5 ticks/spell), so this comes to an absolute maximum of 125k xp/hr in the absolute best case scenario, at 95+ magic using the best spell in BiS gear and burning through burnt pages. 
---
The number you quote is almost 30% higher than this, lmao. Jeez, nowhere else except for Reddit do you see such consistent spreading of misinformation.
---
Lmao you know this is osrs right? It hasnt been out for 15 years but ive defiantly been playing since 06 so take a step back and fuck yourself mr. I think i know it all

"Dont talk to me or my son ever again"

it doesn't mean you'll automatically be a god at it, it just makes it more accessible meaning more people will try it.

If I didn't already have a built in muscle memory pvp I wouldn't even try learning it in this day and age.

making pvp more accessible with small things like spell resizing and prayer reordering is a good thing for pvp.

That must be false, according to OP the game didn’t exist then!!

Is that with warhammer specs on both? Either way mace wont be used at tekton since people are still gonna bring scythe and rapier or just lance. KQ I guess, but KQ is purely for pet hunt

When using the trident of swamp, should i be defensive casting as well?? (as per the logic that defensive casting is better than magic xp only casting such as when barraging dusts/nechryaels).

There's no point in owning an Arcane if you don't already own a Kodai. The Arcane is more expensive despite being a smaller upgrade over the its second-BIS compared to the Kodai.
---
If they don't stack and you would never own an Arcane over a Kodai, then the value of the Arcane won't go up if you give it this buff. The Arcane should either stack with the Kodai or it should have a different effect
---
Just let this sink in.

Theres like 10000 things to do. There are lots of bots but they just sit at like 20 of those things. So if you do the other 99980 things, you never notice them. At end game you might encounter one bot per year (excluding hacked accs to spam msgs at ge).

Quest diaries and Slayer. You hit max combat from Slayer, keep going. Then you work on skills while doing raids, bossing, ECT. Eventually you'll just end up with lots of cash from like 75+ Slayer, then money becomes less of a concern for your essentials. There are slower methods of Slayer that net more money, same can be said with almost anything in RuneScape. The meta is to power level everything and grind out a boss for go, and liquidate stuff to buy faster methods of training. I mean there's no real advice for this it's a open ended game but there are like max efficiency guides and stuff. I find a lot of the fun is carving my own path, opting for odd lucrative methods if there are any.
---
Depending on who you are and what rate you play the game I would say you can find small things between the way that are profitable and good experience like blast furnace. It's just about keeping a eye out for different opritunuties. Like with Slayer many people opt out of doing blue dragons tasks because they're often really slow for someone of your stats. If you stick with it, by the time you are like 80 Slayer you'll have close to 10m from all the dragon tasks you get alone.
---
If you have a hard time keeping goals or focus it's best to segment your goals as much as possible. Or don't. Some people just need big goals and need to do everything tick perfect, all the way. But for me I to keep a series of small goals, and hop around a lot.
---
Oh yeah I have receipts!
---
Thanks for the support
---
Just because you’re dry doesn’t mean they should rework the entire boss

I'm just tired of this "ironmen will have it easier than they do now" mindset I see often. That's just restricting the game in unnecessary ways. It's useless.

Vorks head is only guaranteed at 50 kc. After that it's just a 1/50 drop rate.
---
Work towards quest cape, prioritizing RFD, MM2, DS2, and SOTE—doing these quests will give you an overall mix of questing, skilling, and slayer/PvM (MM2 req), while unlocking all of the main “meta” content in the game.
---
The melee side of the new items I'm ok with, the staff and offhand however..
---
Goddamn I always sleep on this stuff looks like it's more fucking vork for me

That's the exact mindset right there. Why focus on a single group? What's the driving force behind that?

He’s making an Epstein didn’t kill himself joke I believe.
---
If they do anything with the jars I imagine they would move the jars to a guaranteed drop after a certain kc, then add another trolly rare drop that's untradeable.
---
Slayer prod

Because there should never be better items released into the game right?

We should just keep the same content forever !

ironman is only fun and satisfying for a while then it gets annoying as fuck. it's like 500x grindier than a main and you have to do boring prep for literally anything you wanna do, your supplies are always kind of limited too. give it a try for what it's worth tho.
---
J1mmy's chat is good too
---
What???
---
Slayer level: Nice
---
What do you mean? What setting can I change to make it easier to bank?
---
Graardor's nipples make me so uncomfortable
---
I'm just a casual and would be happy with either a pass or fail in the polling of the tome but the fact that you say 2% of irons want something harder is a far cry from what the community want.
---
It seems to me like the majority were happy with what Jagex are producing and that is how the polling system works.
---
I would say the reason Husky is getting what seems like a lot of harsh responses on twitter is that the top 2% have a major investment/spend a lot of their lives on OSRS (nothing wrong with that) and take this poll extremely personally.
---
It's split but it's worth it because the defence xp is worth more (timewise)
---
As a Chad, I approve this thread 💯
---
That's bloody amazing, good on ya ;)
---
I think homages should be used very sparingly and not impact the game, but I think this is worthy of one because it made something previously not worth doing other than for favor the sole runecrafting training method, up to lvl 77, for a Jagex created game mode.
---
Its been a long time goal of mine to get EVERY food related item in the game.. ive only just mustered the energy to do it..

What am i missing?? Im sure there are more than whats listed on the food guide.

Also if you would like to make a donation of something i dont have... single item donation only.. not looking to make money

Thanks :)

I happen to have 2 cosmic talismans in Ironmans invent. All I did was open caskets from ammenite crabs I believe. You should get some there

Yooo what's worse, is our characters have none. Nipplackin' if you will

Just give hats to all pets...

Cannachat is cool, it’s a social cc with everything from newer people to maxed mains. Lotta skillers, lotta pvmers down to teach bossing/raids, lotta shooting the shit about random stuff. We’re a diverse group, all of us have been there, and we love to help where we can. Swing by sometime and chop it up. Our rules are super ez: don’t be a shithead (no racism/sexism, religion, or politics) , and always split loot evenly.

Haha that  sounds awesome! Text is not really my strong suit but I would gladly paint a bookmark with the battle axe for you if it’s something you would like to order, and leave room for you to add text 😄
---
And if the staves are worth a bill, then surely they can have there huge hits with that risk?
---
Some areas tax different so maybe you got got charged a bit much for tax when it finalized in a different area.

God dhide next, then rigour. Pegs and arma last. Rigour seems steep, but it’s the biggest pvm upgrade in the game, and is actually quite cheap right now. Rigour in dhide is better dps than eagle eye in full arma (obviously bc arma just adds accuracy, but this is meant as a point of reference regarding gp spent on the upgrades)
---
either way, even if arcane is involved in the tome i think itll be mage + siren = tome tier 1 and tier 1 + sigil = tier 2 tome, regardless that means mage book will still have more than 9m value anyhow. but the problem for jagex is, they have to make a literal new poll for arcane attach to sirens tome cuz itll make it even better.

Very nice, congrats! I’ll get my top tomorrow to complete it. Ironman has forced me to value marks and get graceful for the first time ever. It’s much more enjoyable!

Anyone have a bossing CC or something similar? I'd love to try new things in the game lol. I've been mass killing Zulrah trying to get some money saved but I'm crazy dry on uniques and, as much as I'd love to get the pet, I don't really play enough to get more than 5 or so kills a day.
---
Why are they worth anything when they aren't discontinued like in RS3?
---
I don't see how this is different than Kodai Wand, then again I wasn't around when that was released.

Really though, people need to stop putting Arcane Sigil on a throne. What Arcane needs is a passive effect

Yeah no. It’s just not funny to me.
---
Sara sword was never relevant at any point in runescapes history, because abyssal whip existed beforehand. Just a strength training option.
---
I disliked the crystal blade just as much as I disliked this mace. I thought crystal blade was a needless and pointless item since we already had the abby tentacle. So using crystal blade to defend this mace doesn't really change my mind.
---
Hasta got devalued at first, but that got reversed when they introduced the dragonhunter lance, which is useful in many more situations than the rapier. And this is exactly what i'm saying they should do with the bludgeon - require it to be upgraded into a new stronger weapon. If you want a 1h crush option so badly then they could even upgrade the bludgeon into a 1h version, similar to how the zammy spear is turned into a 1h weapon. The worst part about devaluing the bludgeon is that it also makes the abyssal sire a pointless slayer boss.
---
Jagex have gone back on their bad decisions in the past (e.g zulrah), so why should we just "get on with it" and accept trash updates.
---
11/22/63 was sooooo good right up until the last few chapters which were kinda trash. a truly fantastic book with a mediocre ending.
---
If this is who I think it is in-game, just LMAO
---
Without menu swapping there is no way to do what your looking to do. 
---
Just don’t be special and right click..
---
You say and I quote 
---
&gt;Arcane shouldn't even conceptually be the BiS offensive magic offhand. It's a shield.
---
Historically that has NEVER been the case in OSRS.  A shield had always been a BIS option.
---
If I'm not mistaken, the Divine/Arcane/Elysian all have the same passive effects where it reduces prayer instead of damage? Seems like it would be a net negative in OS
---
When I was like 13 I had my first girlfriend on RuneScape. She was also a highschool kid who lived in Canada. I took her on dates and gave her steak and good tasting cabbage. She gave me an uncut gem. We talked about having crushes on people at school. She later dumped me for some guy with the username pooooooooop.

Why do the pet rocks have party hats on them?

Don't arm Chromebooks have the play store? Is mobile an option?

---
am i able to apply higher poison to a dagger without removing it?
---
like say i add wep poison (+) to a dagger, then can i use wep poison (++) on the dagger without removing the poison?
---
the reason i ask is i got an abby dagger on twisted league, and i cant get a cleaning cloth on there. so if i make it a (p+) dagger for now can i make it (p++) once i get to sarachnis?
---
What a pathetic straw-man.  
---
I never said it was okay for people to harass her.  If you're not delusional then you'll realize a female public figure on the internet is going to be harassed, whether you like it or not.  
---
You can either whine about how it's "not okay" or you can accept it and deal with it, being prepared for it and not taking them seriously are a couple good ways of doing that.

This is what I'm doing. Just got back in the game, don't know the password to my old account so I'm grinding a new one. Honestly im glad I'm starting fresh anyway, pretty sure my old account was a mess.

You sure he got a firecape and not a heart attack or seizure with that filming..

no
---
Gratz! Haha
---
Yeah, shields are always BiS if you care about defenses. What is BiS depends on the situation, but everyone seems to think BiS means all situations
---
Honestly, as someone who just started and is playing for free, people have been very nice to me, given me money and gear for free, and generally made me feel welcome. Maybe it's in part the holiday spirit, idk, but it's been nice. I definitely didn't remember anyone being nice ever.
---
I mean, I would find it really weird, creepy, and overall shitty if someone made a joke about raids being my panty drawer after putting a ton of hard work into raids.
---
He said he was shaking like crazy lol
---
I don’t mean to go totally off topic here, but you’ll make a lot more money if you do Cerb and Sire for full tasks as well. Last Cerb task I did, I got a smouldering stone and a primordial crystal. Last Sire task I did, I got an Abby dagger. That’s in addition to the 1.5m (sire) or 2.8m (Cerb) that you already make without uniques, which you may not get every single task. But it’s incredibly easy pvm (once you get the hang of it) that acts as a bridge into the higher level pvm like CoX. Olm shares a few mechanics with slayer bosses. And I don’t mean to come of as presumptuous, but if you did them frequently I think you’d be sitting on quite a bit more than 70m. If pvm isn’t your thing, that’s totally cool too, I just figured I’d throw it out there, because they’re incredibly easy to kill on mobile. Feel free to message me if you have any questions about dealing with certain boss mechanics on a touch screen, I do literally everything on mobile except for raids.

Weird looking infernal cape... but nah gz

as an ironman who has a mages book but not an arcane, i see this as an absolute win

You cannot remove it without a cleaning cloth.
---
Learned this the hard way with my Dragon Hasta, thankfully I got another one lol

I was hoping they added them to more pets and bosses this year too, mainly I wanted my Hydra pet to have hats on every head.  
---
Maybe some hope for next year =/
---
Ah yes hello and welcome to RS, we hope you enjoy th evoid
---
There should be a pet rate for how many times u let it it becomes ur pet... i would love that dog :(
---
so you cant just use a higher tier poison on it?
---
i know you cant remove it
---
I'm assuming they meant in-game gold?
---
In reply to this, did they say if they're adding the entire set of TPs on the Arceuus spellbook or just some of them? Because for standard/lunar/ancients not every TP can be added to the nexus.

I'm not ignorant to the fact that companies are out there to make money. I just don't think that as a consumer I should actually care about that if I disagree with one of their decisions.
---
Like, I'm not going to just accept things I disagree with or think negatively affect my experience just because the multi-million/billion dollar company wants to make even more money, you know? 
---
In a way it's like a peasant apologizing for a rich king whose decisions are negatively affecting the peasant so the king can make more money. It just doesn't make sense.

But i do remember sw being a solid training method back in the day. maybe have sw give 50% xp and no free ammo available. but instead a passive buff of a chance to save ammo/runes
---
Going to use this for my dopamine once twisted league ends
---
why does everything need to upgrade something else?  let low level gear fucking fade out already, its getting old.  at this point i feel like jagex should just update the game as they want it because this community is too busy arguing trying to kill it themselves.
---
Definitely a good one
---
What's the OC? I think I've seen this beforr
---
no... someone figures something out of the game each update, we dont need a million npcs with different players names in the game, there is already enough as is.
---
jagex didnt think "hey this guy made a code to tell where our shit is, let make this the only way to train rc on purpose because of that".  it was always an option, they just made it more efficient.
---
the fact you don't even consider raids etc with claiming slayer helm &gt; everything else just proves you shouldn't have a say about anything pvm related.

I remember the pain in the ass that was learning Zulrah, the rotation guide always distracted the hell out of me too.
---
What helped me was just trying to be reactive (and quick) to what Zulrah was doing so I could focus on prayer and gear switching based off what was happening rather than trying to memorize all of the rotations, that and as soon as the gas disappears you should start moving to the other side of the island, just doing those two things I was able to get all the rotations memorized and it makes the boss a cinch.
---
The gas still fucks me up a lot

I never knew so many people cared this passionately about the Arcane

Well that's not really on Jagex. The corrupted runs average out on 528k the run (source Wiki) with a chance on crystal armour seeds and the blade. IT is pretty good money and a challenging boss fight for a change. Imo it's not as much dead content as people think it is.

Please add mediums!! Also hard would be incredible.

Submit a bug report don't post on Reddit
---
This is the right mindset. Good on you
---
Serp helm also protects from venom so it won't be used at zulrah or something like it. It would probably be op at dk's since you don't have to bring antidotes or sanfews. So it doesn't look too overpowered but it might be.
---
I found Moss Giants to have okay drops. Runes, black shield, mith sword, seeds and big bones (get those prayer gains). They also drop their aggro after a while so you can confidently go after just one without tagging anyone else’s. 
---
I’ve been chipping away at temple spiders (for slayer). I’ve found them really tough and really need to use Protect from Melee for most of the time (I’m level 64 with 51 in Str, Def, Att). I’ll probably keep trying with them but might return to Moss Giants to boost those combat skills. (I also need to work on my smithing to make myself some decent armour. Lvl 64 and still rocking the steel chain mail - embarrassing ;) ).

Yeah I feel that. Hopefully group ironman will be successful for you guys then. Sometimes I wish there was lending in OSRS. I feel bad leaving all my gear on my account when it could be getting used by someone who wants it, but I only have a handful of friends who I can trust, and most of them are playing less and less these days, or ironmen themselves.

It's not gay if there's no eye contact.

No it is not allowed. You're right it's allowed via windows mousekeys.

You’ve clearly never done MTA.

We are not going to sit and hope for some content where arcane can be kind of useful. Defence and prayer simply isnt that important in osrs, and its hard to make that the case

I'd actually love to see the statistics on all the good sink npcs

I've done b2p on 3 accounts and my iron has master wand + mages book.

To spend 10 hours for an add-on that gives access to a bis item is really no big deal lol.

AFAIK they aren't cleartext, thank god. But still, its super troubling and the only response I've gotten from Jagex was that "Well, we think its better to just have people not tell others their passwords. If you protect your account like that, you'll be fine."
---
Charge your phone

I was also surprised that or the crab emoji didn't make it. Or one of Jagex's alternative spellings like jamflex.

However, some of the small words were fun to me to see: "nostalgia", "brother", "friends", and even "Pokemon". This game really does have a lot of meaning and this odd dichotomy between nostalgia and living in the new past but making new friends and rekindling old relationships. It's been such a blast over the last couple years since I got back into it.
---
Gratz, I hate you now.
---
Theres no cancel button in an email like that. Obvious scam
---
If you tie the new book to some other super rare drop, the new book is gonna be worthless. It'll be the exact same situation as ranger boots and peg crystals.
---
Received same mail with the same mrjones1991 address yesterday. It's phishing. If you ever feel unsure go to the official runescape website and check your account there but never log in from any links in those emails.
---
the boss looks to be hard enough for team only so could b dead content to normal iron accounts but being brought in for group ironman
---
It's not a bad idea to dress up as Santa and let people pk you for a gift
---
Seems that way from the comments here lol. What a guy.
---
Dev team: What the fuck is a RuneScape!?
---
Support machine broke
---
wakes up later to find it was all an hallucination.
---
I just had rotations picture up at the side of my screen when I was learning, it helped a lot. Make sure your switches are clean then you should be set.
---
Managed to sell 1 mage’s book for 8m. Glad I didn’t hoard like I’m sure some people did
---
This is absolutely stupid because no matter what a new BiS will come someday, wether its now or when the game dies in a year. They did balance tome perfectly to fit in the game. The issue is that defence bonus is useless. Arcane would still have been good even with Tome if only the defence bonus was useful
---
Although they are not forced to add it, it does speak volumes when really good ideas barely fail polls, but don't get added. Whereas things that pass polls (whether good or bad), also don't get added. As a player, we've always been under the impression that if a poll passes, said idea come into the game, which has worked great in allowing players to sculpt the direction in which the games moves. By not adding something that has passed the polls, this takes away from the feeling, and makes it so Jagex are catering towards the minority instead of the majority (clearly shown by the poll).
---
Twitter feedback? Did you miss all the arcane memes on here?
---
So, then you make sang hot garbage. Only thing keeping it relevant was the sirens tome to compete vs the new dps staff plus tome of fire.
---
It shouldn't, in my opinion it should have been a stand alone item but for some reason jagex has a boner for making attachments
---
Please shut the fuck up, they never stated this.
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure the Warding skill lost because of majority voting no. I really wanted it in.
---
Thanks elitist community, you guys know best
---
darn you.
---
Mages book was already the middle tier magic shield. It’ll remain a cheaper alternative to the BiS shield. Jagex decided not to add it anyways though
---
14 years and never once noticed runes coming out the flames... man
---
New areas, bosses, items, quests, etc. Basically they reverted the game to how it was in 2007 and are updating like they did before, though the content is different. The biggest difference is the polling system. Every update (Outside of 'integrity changes') has to pass a poll with 75% approval. It lets the community have a direct hand in what is added to the game.
---
I just can't understand why they would poll an item if they're not sure if it should be implemented in the game. They really should've thought this true, before polling this item..
---
No just no.
---
People having a go at Mod Husky on twitter, has a maxed Ironman with no Corp KC and so was perceived as influencing the design to make it easier on irons.
---
Arcane stonks bout to moon. RIP to anyone who sold low
---
TBF this is **not** a Jagex bug. This might happen while working with external providers like Google or Apple since they're in charge of everything that regards your payments.
---
Jagex doesn't cancel anything (doesn't actually do *anything*) unless they're been told (technically speaking *notified*) to do so by Google or Apple. Apple is regarded as being really **shit** from a developer point of view: if something goes wrong - like in this case - you can't do anything but a manual (AKA "hack") intervention from Jagex PS which can take a while. Google at least provide a quite good console you can play with. Apple is just... Apple: everything is concealed, everything is invisible, it just happens by divine (Steve Jobs poltergeist) intervention...
---
I agree it’s mostly done for pet purposes, but you can still make pretty good money there. Like 1m an hour or something with good stats and decent luck
---
Turns out if you flash fancy new bis in front of noobs they tend to vote yes. This isn't always beneficial to the longevity of the game especially when there are 6 other unique already coming in the game.
---
The price will probably go up since more people will be using fire surge
---
Bro!!
---
So you stopped using the main?
---
You need to steal her iron first
---
MMK uses Runelite, I imagine most of them use that or the default client for the sake of simplicity.

This is from an anime series called Sabagebu! Here is a part of this scene on Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCbsTDWeNcU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCbsTDWeNcU)
---
No reason for an offhand book to have the same magic damage bonus as the BiS mage top AND bottom combined.
---
He suggested it on Twitter, but the community probably gave him that idea. I saw a few people mention that as an alternative
---
Christmas greetings! Our most recent poll featured a new group boss, The Nightmare, and a host of new equipment as rewards. The poll ended on Wednesday December 11th, and we're pleased to say that all of the rewards passed.
---
There has been a lot of discussion about one item in particular, the Siren's tome, which would be the new best-in-slot magic offhand item. However, we've decided not to add the Siren's tome to the game.
---
The Siren's tome, and how we should introduce it, was the subject of a lot of debate both internally and externally during the design process, and this debate continued through to the polling stages. The tome faced one main source of contention - its introduction to the game would devalue the existing best-in-slot item, the Arcane spirit shield, and the challenging grind offered by the Corporeal Beast. Rumblings among some areas of the community suggested that we were trying to trivialise the magic off-hand grind for Iron accounts. This really isn't the case - we offered the Siren's tome because we had identified an item slot which hadn't seen any upgrades for a long time.
---
On reflection, we have decided to maintain the status quo. We've seen a host of innovative ideas from players about how the item could be redesigned, and we're very grateful for the constructive support. However, as The Nightmare is arriving with six unique rewards, we don't feel it is right to proceed with a seventh one - especially one that has so much uncertainty around it. We may well revisit the idea of an off-hand magic item from future content, though, and the community's suggestions could be very helpful for that. Regardless, we should have anticipated the impact of this item before polling it, and we'll do better to review how new equipment fits holistically within Old School RuneScape.
---
We want to reiterate that this decision was not taken lightly. There's no other way around it - the tome passed the poll, but we feel, that for the reasons listed, we're doing what is right for the game.
---
We also want to be clear that those of us lucky enough to be working on Old School RuneScape are a united team. We succeed as a team, and we tackle any challenges as a team. In no circumstance is it ever acceptable to target individual J-Mods with harassment. We're very fortunate to be working so closely with such a passionate community, but behaviour of this kind will ultimately lead to reduced engagement and fewer open discussions with players.
---
Going forward we'll be releasing The Nightmare and the other rewards early in 2020. We're going to learn more about how you feel about the introduction of new items, and how they should be introduced. We'll survey players and use focus groups to gather the information we need to guide a long-term approach to introducing and polling new equipment that you're comfortable with, and one that allows Old School to grow.
---
No BIS should be buyable anyway.  Make it earn it, or don't get it, and let people who can't be bothered settle with buying slightly worse gear.
---
Worked for barrows gloves for years.
---
It wasnt a risk if they can just keep the poll what it is, i just dont get how they can remove an item eho already passed a poll.
---
The heroe we don't deserve.
---
Ye. Like wtf are polls suppose to mean then ? If they can revert everything back
---
Jagex is a woman
---
Jagex made him up to get you to think other people enjoy this game.. when you don’t.. you’re just clicking
---
Thanks for the insanely easy merch and for the 100m Arcane Jagex! Made absolute bank this week and haven't even merched in years.
---
Its unreal
---
This boss was about to be overloaded with uniques anyway. Rather than bodging the book onto a sigil or something it makes sense just to save it for some future content where it can be reworked and fit thematically.
---
You're gonna need some papyrus or a glassblowing pipe
---
Maybe a boss mechanic where the higher your armor the lower the max hit they can hit on you? A lot of games have this, the way defence works in osrs now is more like a dodge rating type of thing
---
Shouldnt you guys have had that internal discussion before polling it and costing players a lot of gp
---
Someone, in seeing this news, is currently logging onto mobile repeatedly mumbling “shit, shit, shit, shit”
---
I never said the corp grind was an issue I said the content sucks. Arcanes like half to a third the time of bow, without any alt usage. With an alt it gets way faster.
---
It's been shown time and time again that nearly anything that isn't a pvp update or a new skill will pass a poll. The requirements to vote are laughably low, and there's clearly a high population of players that will vote yes to anything without any knowledge of the content's impact on the game. They could poll twisted league exp rates and relics and I'd bet the majority of that would pass as well, but there's not way they should be implemented into the game.
---
Wait so we're just getting mages book and the new attachment for free then? I don't have to put any work in? Cool!
---
/s because I know you'll need it with how fucking retarded you must be to consider this new combo item requiring 0 effort.
---
Distorted text generator

i got the same email, just ignore it.

---
How to invalidate your own polling system lmao.
---
Arcane is long overdue to being dethroned as BiS item and is actually the comparatively worst of them all and not really worth getting unless you own all the other BiS items already. My hype for this boss died down considerably.
---
guuhbay
---
So its not osrs anymore, we are entering rs3 era then?
---
Becouse osrs was always about what players think are right.
---
Nurse should tell him the good new today :)
---
So then why do I take the time out of my day to go vote? What's the point.
---
Back to the flax fields.
---
Wyd this is going to make my ely crash
---
just get members right away,
---
Buying items for the purpose of merching is always a risk. Especially ones that are being/have recently been polled
---
Ill stick to the official LSD. Idc how trust worthy research chemicals are. I dont trust the name Research Chemicals..
---
I still stake quite often actually. I normally do a few 5-10m chucks, if I make 10m I walk, and if I lose my initial cash I walk. I find it quite fun but you have to walk in accepting that what you bring you’re okay with losing. I go to casinos IRL maybe once every few months and do the same thing (although more like $200-400). If you can’t control your impulses in a video game, never go to a casino.
---
This sub isn't for spreading your pro-Jagex propoganda
---
Big oof
---
Yep, but then the new boss would need to be "harder" then corp otherwise you'll have content that makes no god damn sense.
---
Amen, it's not hard work and at some point you end up making money on your knowledge rather than your skills. Just knowing how to do the job is most of the work.
---
Did you end up profiting or losing in the end?
---
If the government is investigating you under some speocifc banking laws, they're actually not even allowed to tell you.
---
The player base passed the tome's poll though.
---
Props to jagex for considering updates and their implications
---
Arcane isn't really a defensive shield though. It's niche is magic attack with a glaring magic defense weakness. It has decent melee and ranged defence, but if Ranged and Melee defence was relevant you'd use a crystal shield/ely/spectral or something which would still be used in a number of places.
---
Wtf right? Why have a poll system if we're not going to respect the results?
---
I'm quite sure it'll be harder than corp lol.
---
Corp can be afked with 0 food used, and has almost no mechanics. It's an 11 year old boss.
---
I haven’t, would you mind informing me?
---
Between mage book, corp shields, and tome of fire, mage doesn't need new bis offhands.
---
Its needs a mid tier between a literal quest item filled by treasure trails, that sounds like a vanity item on paper, and a 7 figure book.
---
So, you'd expect Jagex to take advice from casual fuckers like you who play 1 hour a day and are generally clueless about the game and not neckbeards who analyze everything and have a ton more knowledge? 
---
Good one.
---

Y’all to the wise old man in draynor. He can tell which items are useless from your bank

doing all f2p quests is a good start.

If you're a hardcore go to the wilderness sooner rather than later to get the planks needed for dragon slayer, look on the wiki for the plank spawn.
---
Alright, well i have gotten around 40 larren's keys since the update and no scroll drops. I have some serious doubts.
---
Support. I don't know why the trend with new bosses is to have them pretty much ignore your armor entirely and depend exclusively on prayer switching. Verzik and most of the TOB monsters for example give no shits what you're wearing, besides maybe the nycolas room. Look at KQ, 2/3 of her attack straight up ignore your defense entirely, and she's not even new.
---
Why does it matter how it affects current bis lol.
---
Should we combine rune scim + dscim + whip + bludgeon + an addon to make a scythe?
---
Non bis items are used by people who can't afford to get bis, that's their use after bis is added. There doesn't always need to be an addon.
---
Very tough decision to make for sure but this is certainly for the better
---
I'm at 407 days played. Created 1167 days ago D:
---
Let the fuckers lose some money!!
---
&gt;without dark altar getting 99 pray is like getting 99 slayer twice. 
---
This isn't even close to true. I have 10x prayer exp(warrior+focus) and should almost have 99 prayer banked from 99 slayer from doing bloodvelds and hydras to 99.
---
Almost 91
---
The attachment would have been good for PVP where hitting but rolling 0 is fine since that still lets you catch a freeze or TB.
---
You've missed his point. It's that pegasian crystals are worthless because the time they attach to are rarer than the crystal.
---
If this attachment went only on arcanes then over time (depending on drop rate) the attachment would become worthless as it's useless without an arcane similar to how you can't do anything with just the pegasian crystal
---
Little harsh lol. Not that he deserves it, but I’m sure he knows the risk involved. It just didn’t pay off this time
---
Yep. Lost my 1b at sand casino. Made iron. Haven't touched main since.
---
Accumulator is bad. You can fletch infinite broad arrows/bolts and the best mage training method to 99 is library.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
I refuse to believe this is the same team that added rigour into the game lol
---
Sure looks happy to still be killed
---
&gt; avoid the sphinx with a pet out
---
how is a player supposed to find out about that??
---
Where is the mace worse? Combined with the armor is same max hit and more accurate
---
I’m assuming this is in reference to the hate towards Husky on Twitter. His comment was misinterpreted but he still came across as being incredibly rude to assume that what the reason the player didn’t what the update.
---
Jagex update to deal with splashers, next are the spiders.
---
Look, I empathize with the fact that you lost 35 million gp but I am not sure why Jagex has to frame content around people making/losing gp. You make your choice in the economy and that just how it works. 
---
I think I get your point more if you are saying that Jagex could have communicated this to the community better. But still, you make the choices when it comes to hedging for/against content changes.
---
Anywhere where stab or slash is predominant.
---
Kill it with fire
---
Well if having a big bank makes you want to go staking, when that urge comes along message a good buddy, give him all the gold on your account, have him hold it for x number of days so you can get a reminder of being broke, once the urge goes away or the agreed upon time, get your money back from him, then give him around 20m for saving your bank. 
---
I have a friend that does this with me, he keeps his cash in the end and my bank gets a little bit bigger. Win win.
---
These look randomly generated. They're great

Community is actually incredibly entitled. Find me another game that gets permission from the player base on every major update
---
That's not what I was saying.. the point is you listen to the entire community. The top .1% people don't get to dictate the game or the game would never progress.
---
No shit but you want to name some?
---
True, people give the mods so much shit when they love the game as much as we do and should be praised more
---
I was just responding to your comment. Its never been worthwhile getting it

From the wiki:
---
When worn, 10% chance of mining 2 ores at once up to mithril, granting xp for both ores mined. Also works on sandstone rock, as well as lovakite ore (despite being a higher level than mithril). However it does not work at Motherlode Mine, Blast Mine, Volcanic Mine, or on gem rocks.
---
9hp doesn’t make you level 2
---
hahahha i assumed this was fake but did they really poll it, have it pass, then just decide nah nevermind? 
---
thats actually insane and people who sold their shield for 60m are gonna be so pissed
---
Prob
---
Yes jagex definitly should've communicated this earlier, you know during the beta.
---
And no i didnt hedge or merch because i had the arcane already and only sold it after it passed the poll, because it would be completely useless to me after the new bis came out.
---
Zeah Hero
---
At 20M?! I bought one for 96m yesterday morning and sold for 98 few mins later... If only I held onto it smh
---
Oh so you do get the xp drops, nice. I really thought you didn't
---
How is it a RangeScape meta when all three combat styles have their own thing going on for them. At raids 1 Range is dominant but that's not necessarily bad. 
---
Slayer is still done quite often with melee.
---
at the same time, most games dont get a second chance after massively fucking up their game do they? people just quit and the game dies.
---
Lost 10m not happy 1/5th the bank
---
The top .1% is more knowledgeable than the rest of the community, and also, it was far more people than that who complained about this OBVIOUS terrible decision. 
---
The game is literally nothing like it was in 2013 so it's more than obvious that they don't only listen to the top 0.1%. They just realized their decision was stupid and reverted it.
---
Yeah but its still worse overall against monsters without weakness as it has charges.
---
Nobody likes charges, so just make the mace slightly worse overall by giving it slightly less strength, but still better against crush and only crush as it has higher accuracy
---
If it’s worse than the arcane then it’s worthless and if it’s better then the arcane is dead content....
---
Get it now? It’s really not too complicated lmao...
---
It's a "Should we" and not a "We will add with your approval."
---
If I said "Should I give you $200?" and you say "Yes," I can still turn around and go "Nahhhh bruh. Fuck that."
---
I used to do it mining iron, 35xp per drop, 70xp when I got 2.
---
Arc bgs war hammer and a max house obvs you don't have that if you are only getting 4 kills and hour 
---
Like I said are you hardcore? Or Nah
---
Sucks to suck

Damm that hella worth it ty for this

I’ve got it all bud, let’s compare accounts:)
---
Most recent example is the brimstone ring from hydra/alchemical hydra.
---
I was very happy to see all the cool christmas dress up stuff after completing the event
---
Nowhere did I mention the quantifiable number of neigh-sayers. Go back and read.
---
You need me to distinguish for you where stab or slash is meta?
---
The stats are better than a dragon Sq and around the same as dragon kite, except with a crush bonus around the same as a charged DFS. Combine that with it's great offensive abilities and it'd be a great shield in defensive situations to cut back on switches.
---
It's not ely by any means, but to say it's not really a defensive shield kinda undermines the respectable stats
---
I wouldn't be opposed to this.
---
But then people would cry.
---
You're blaming jagex for selling an item at a loss...? Oh boy, if I could do that every time I lost some GP on an item!
---
will you be happy when they change their mind about a passing poll that you support?
---
Anybody?
---
Those series seem like an inverse of what I outlined. This idea isn't whether a new account type would be created to coexist with normal players and ironmen. This idea is more about a hypothetical restart to RuneScape with this method of play being the default. I'm interested in what kind of repercussions it would have. 
---
I was reading an interesting piece of history on items where previously *everything* was tradable at some early point in Classic. Players complained that this made questing too easy, so they introduced restrictions. This is kind of taking those early steps Jagex made themselves way back to a higher level.
---
No it doesnt. Go educate yourself.
---
There is no PvP in Twisted League what the fuck?
---
Why did he drop it in the first place? He had like 3 empty inventory slots.
---
selling an item at a loss because of an announcement that wasn't true, yes
---
So then we're should change Corp and GWD for ironmen?
---
Ooofff
---
Oh okay that makes sense.  Some reason I thought it was like a group clue scroll thing.
---
I've even made friends randomly right-clicking and looking people up. Playing on my alt I randomly stumbled into a guy who had the same 2 99s as I did, similar total level and total xp, and very similar stats. The cherry on the cake was our default player models. We had the same clothes, skin color, and hair.
---
Realizing we played OSRS so similarly that we were basically mirroring each other without knowing it, we obviously instantly became good friends.
---
Why would they bot there when it's probably more profitable for them to bot zalcano
---
The top .1% doesnt know that much more they just put more time in. It's not like they spend their time researching small details. They spend their time grinding ehp. They might be slightly more knowledgeable and I'm not saying their opinions should be ignored but it's a good thing the game isn't catered to just them
---
People who bought their shield for 60m are gonna be so happy
---
Here’s a spreadsheet with blast furnace info

Apparently has quite a big impact on people like you that for some reason think this would’ve been good to have in the game. Stop crying.

KEKW
---
*Ash parroting good ideas posted by some dude here.
---
You're pretty slow at data mining, it's already in the game
---
Because whats good for the game weighs higher than what people supposedly want (for the first time in history).
---
no support, enough people are farming it already, look at chaos runes for example.
---
people need to stop thinking "i need the most money i can get" isnt the idea of it to get xp, the rewards are just a bonus?!
---
I do understand your frustration, i really do. but i dont think this is a good idea. its peoples mindset that needs to change not the boss.
---
&gt; We dont know if this will be easier to get.
---
Easier in time it takes? Hard to say
---
Easier overall? It should be as ToB is raids level difficulty while a corp like boss isnt. With the amount of people avle to kill a corp like boss it wouldnt matter if its 1/5k while rapier is 1/200 or whatever it is if there are 25 times more people doing ashihama than tob making up for the larger droprate.
---
It doesnt matter if its a crush rapier, there isnt that much crush weakness in the game so many people would buy it to just use as how people now use rapier for everything like slayer tasks. More rapier like weapons comes in, rapier falls in price
---
If they just make the mace better for Only crush, while not matching how rapier is the best for overall things like even slaying anything like even bloodvelds, then the mace would still be BiS at something without fjcking over the rapier
---
I'm actually completely out of the loop and only posted this in reference to the weekly Jagex posting on the official site. I just see people freaking out on the devs every time they make a comment and it bothers me. Thanks for the background information though!
---
No im implying there are no such places where stab is better than crush where you wouldnt just use a lance e.g. you can use mace everywhere you would use rapier. Probably take pve out of ur name if you are this dense
---
Chance at double ores as someone else pointed out, and the top acts a prospector top.
---
What is considered an "end game" boss has changed since RuneScape has existed. There was a point where black knights were the strongest monster in the game. Then moss and ice Giants. 
---
Raids and other bosses "devalued" kbd and kalphite queen but who cares? Do we really want to be stuck in a game with the same end game bosses forever?
---
Yeah, but don't bot in the future, okay?
---
Jagex thought up and designed the reward.
---
80% of the playerbase thought the reward sounded sweet.
---
Some amount of the other 20% of players whined really loudly.
---
So while you might think that the devs of a game and 80% of their player base being on board with something would be more than enough to go through with any update, but apparently a small section of the playerbase crying hard enough can overrule that supermajority.
---
This whole polling thing is turning into a huge fucking joke.
---
Changes no one asked for.... "BAM, here they are and unpolled."
---
Things that pass a vote... "On second thought.... NAH"
---
Because it's a super rare item from a boss that takes a while to kill and it is still BIS. Even if BIS makes it 5% better the fact is that it holds that title.
---
If they made it so much lower tier items like D boots, rangers, whips, Neitz etc etc. are all attachments to a BIS item then they sure as hell should do the same to a much more prestigious item like the Arcane.
---
Sure, it is high as $0.30 cents brutal, you can use the lightning network for less than $. 01 cent. You can also use litecoin for less than $0.01 cent per transaction or even better, use nano for free and instant transactions.
---
You don't like volatility against dollars? No worries, use USDC, TUSD, Dai or any stable coin that you want.
---
But if you ask me, I want a coin without inflation like bitcoin or litecoin any day. That's why 99% of my money is in crypto, and just the rest in dollars and Mexican Pesos.
---
Great point! I’ll not go too nuts, got to have some responsibility with money haha!
---
The thing that I think most people don't like about it is that there's a minimum of 5 mins of prep time before you can even reach the boss. Additionally with the randomization of rooms, not every layout is can be optimal for success and sometimes requires that you just restart.
---
As for the rewards, they're definitely on the weaker side, especially for the regular gauntlet but I can understand the increase in rarity. If you look at how many hours it would take to obtain all of the rewards, including the blade, it's honestly ridiculous and not worth it for a majority of people. We're talking the same time it might take you to get 1 or 2 99s. Also the crystal armor was somewhat of a disappointment for most people even though it's still used for a few niche things.
---
and he made it into justiciar lol
---
Make it like Corp. It's doable solo, but you need a dwh and bgs as well as a decent enough house to be able to debuff it so you can solo it.
---
There was never an implication to make corp drops available elsewhere, rather have more alternatives to the Arcane. 
---
&gt;If you find Corp boring enough to the point you won’t do it even though you want something from it why are you even playing rs?
---
What even is this argument? Some parts of OSRS are badly designed, outdated and flat out boring, while other parts are of it are great and well designed. Sometimes I spend some time at some content that I don't necessarily like (shamans for DWH) so I can have more fun at other places (raids). It's also a large leap for you to say I won't ever do corp, it's just not great content IMO.
---
I say that we add more alternatives in more item slots, as long as they don't break the game balance, even though that sometimes that's justified considering boss/content difficulty, rarity or accessibility.
---
Put public chat to off and don't worry about toxicity
---
Small sample size
---
just remove all the rewards then add more xp, would you be happy with that, my guess is no cause your post is talking about getting as much loot as you can.
---
Most people dont want to do that, hance the blade being half the price
---
Start off by having a significantly larger sample size.
---
He could have venged for a faster kill. Also kara elite diaries give you a daily revive in there, so can sometimes just afk jad with a t bow.

Heyo! Was just wondering if u were still plannin on adding me? RSN is Maximus_VII
---
I don’t play OSRS anymore but I still keep up with it sometimes and I’m glad they decided to not go through with it. There’s ways to bring in items without % damage on it and, personally, it kind of looked like half-assed with attaching it to some random irrelevant item anyway. Good on the jmods to listen to feedback
---
I think it can be abused by richer players but to us common folk it helps us by making membership cost nothing irl but some time you'd probs spend playing the game anyway.
---
Grotesque guardians pet has no festive hat! Jagex make my marble pet get into the spirit!
---
that luck is crazy
---
but need a way bigger sample size to even start talking about normal distrobution
---
In my view, the developers/lower level employees are gonna be a lot better than upper management - goes forblike any company i guess lol. I support the os devs and their passion for the game, not the stinginess of upper mgmt. Though as it relates to your topic, i've only bought bonds once a few years ago lol.
---
And i didn't even know it was my cakeday thanks lol
---
Lmao
---
Does dumb shit in game, says dumb shit on twitter, says dumb shit on reddit and leaked his personal account which people are obviously going to dig at and find his interest in downloading cam whore videos. Unprofessional IMO.
---
Only intelligent analysis in the thread
---
They might not say "compromise our detection algorithm", but its never "i cant tell you what crime you comitted" like what OP claims. 
---
They say you botted/used an illegal 3rd party, proof that you actually did this or how they found out they wont reveal.
---
Yep, believe it or not they do control the game they develop
---
Hell yeah! Gnome Cult has started!
---
Tbh lorewise they definitely don't since we basically discovered Runecrafting for them.
---
if community wants it 😍
---
Inquisitor’s is “evil” justiciar per the lore so it makes sense
---
This is why jagex has the override polls sometimes as evem you have a vote
---
Buy some solid gear and just train Slayer consistently. (I know everyone says that.) I've made a fortune in my grind for 99. Currently almost 95. Also do all the quests, they give a ton of free xp and unlock some of the best areas and training methods. Good luck fam
---
What do you think they were doing with the imprisoned Unicorn in Underground Pass  0\_o
---
Correct decision
---
Saw a lot of hate towards husky and [this](https://twitter.com/Cantbanme911/status/1204757166294544387?s=19) tweet directed towards gee about the shield is just sad, lol
---
&gt;time 2 sit gobby boi
---
???
---
This seems most likely.  People who were going to lose a lot of money on Arcanes became the loudest voice.  This way they don’t even have to deal with it, people will be unhappy for a bit then forget, just like with all the other issues they have.
---
It's outdated for the exact reasons you outlined, it belongs to a version of the game that had a lot less power creep. It was supposed to be a boss that was massed or where you had a smaller group kill it together.
---
if a con artists fools someone into giving them their money then they give it back, is the con artist bad for not going along with the deception?
---
The poll was written to where people that didn't want the item to attach to the book, but they did want the item would still vote yes. Not a good way to poll imo

Arcane crashed because it's not BiS anymore, but no one thought it would pass. The only way it goes back up at all is if they announce they may revert or rework the current tome.  
---
 And Mages book is going up right now. Anecdotal evidence is not real evidence.

---
I see it now, and I've appealed already
---
People can disagree all they want, Jagex has confirmed today that:  
---
&gt;passing a poll means the community is okay with a change entering the game, but the final decision of whether or not to implement said change lies with Jagex
---
the best defense is a good offense
---
Thank you. I'm aware that there's better ways, but I simply didn't have the stats to do those methods
---
People who bought the Mages book for 20m are gonna be pissed
---
That's cuz easy noob pets don't deserve fancy hats
---
there are a lot of people who raid without max gear at cox for example, id expect if the staff isnt hilariously rare that demand for tome will go up. 
---
can heart/ovl to get surge and thatd be a pretty giant boost for lower magic lv pvmers

...that’s a runelite plugin

We’re trying something new this month, maybe 2-3 more.

I’m at 290 lol
---
I spent on average 6 hours a day on StarCraft and couldn't get into grandmasters even after 4 years.
---
same, I completely forgot about the gauntlet existing. It's a lot of fun and I ran through it quite a bit, but there's no reason for me to go back. The rewards aren't up to par with other challenges
---
Jesus Christ dude. Why are you so fucking difficult. It's not a backwards way of thinking to call out someone for being creepy. It is creepy for a random person to say "Hey, I wanna smell your feet". How can you not fucking get that? 
---
It's not a double entendre, you just inherently view everything from a sexual lens so that's what you see. https://i.imgur.com/VMnUOOc.jpg
---
What a garbage human being.
---
Last time i killed it with friends it was 4 of us spamming the house tele method.
---
Was still really fucking lame.
---
Nope
---
This will mean that the new staff and harmonized orb with tome of fire will massively out dps sang staff, increasing max hits at 99 mage from 39 to 49 and at 120 mage from 46 to 49. I think that a lot of people, myself included, voted yes on the tome and the staff with the assumption that the extra 4% damage to the sang (changing 39 and 46 to 40 and 48) would help balance out how massively this new item surpasses sang in dps right now. That means that the nightmare is going to produce objectively better general use items than the sang staff and the ghrazi rapier, which will make tob fall even more in relevance. Do you plan on addressing this at all?
---
Nope. Even if you *did* get it back your name will still get crossed off the HC high scores.
---
they don't restore HC even to those who lost it because of literal game bug, let alone lag
---
Start at the bottom of the pyramid and make your way up by passing obstacles. At the top, you'll get an item worth 10k. Sell it to an npc nearby. The higher your agility, the more money you make.
---
What do you think? Of course there isn't lol

No that's how she goes

Tell the duke I said hey, *would yah*

I was playing on mine and I had a DC and I came back with 1HP and I ate right as todt hit for a 1 (I didn’t die) but after that I got my HP to 18.
---
Boss mechanic where defense matters.  DPS is useless and is based on skilling/mechanics where high defense is needed to take hits while activating the weapons or damage inflicting mechanics (Boss behind a wall of fire or in water; immune to all types of damage except siege weapons/spirit towers/some bullshit; players have to tank hits while activating these to actually do damage to a boss).  Rotate the mechanic to DPS every so often after the fire or water subsides.  Balances out the damage vs defense debate...
---
If you’re going to buy Gp, do it with bonds to support the game and have zero risk. The only warning would be that some people get unmotivated to grind bosses or Gp after realizing they can buy it with real world money. Not saying it will ruin your experience but it’s something to consider.
---
You died, so no
---
What do you see
---
I think they should make an hd option it would be nice and attracted those who hate the games look. Here’s the two main reason some people are against it 1. Work will be distracted from other content 2. No ones asking for this....                              it makes perfect sense let the dev suggest new content so every one votes no unless it directly makes their life easier, and no ones asking but there’s a new post about hd every week? I hate this community -_-
---
There are a lot of Ironman CC’s you can join. I tend to just afk on my mine and focus on my main. It’s easier that way
---
I would have liked to have multiple rune pouches and looting bags, again, why didn’t that pass?
---
That’s a pretty anodyne way of describing what went down. He snidely replied to someone saying that the Arcane shield should be the base of the new item with a statement that basically seemed like he was astounded that players would expect ironmen to do a long hard grind like that. Then 90% of the replies were criticizing the decision and 10% were personally harassing him.
---
How?
---
It's a sad state when people think they're immune to criticism for saying something stupid.
---
I don't know what was said, and the only actual tweet linked here was to another mod for another reason, but it sounds like one of the mods made a joke that wasn't received well, and he doesn't like that it wasn't received well.  Well, that's a risk you take.  Accept it and move on.
---
Huh, thought me and the boys was a meme from last summer tbh.
---
Ah that's a shame, it's my first time playing hardcore. Havnt looked into it too much. Guess I have to decide to go again, or continue a basic iron man
---
Legend.
---
Grats bro
---
If only the community didn't vote yes all the time to anything pvm related
---
I wish I managed to get that chance! Time to try again, or continue as a trashy ironman

Prove it to me that there is no better shield in game than that.

Didn't he die in a really anticlimatic way tho

Oh Im counting on doing that eventually. Not trying to skip anything. Im just mad that new content gets revoked because of people crying once mroe on twitter.

Only if you buy it off the GE not if you just buy it from dear old Jagex. So not always I guess

Worth just doing LSD. 2c-i, 2c-b, 2c-e have unique visuals and stimulation, I definitely prefer lsd. The come ups are less harsh and the high seems a bit more happy protected. Low does LSD can be less anxiety inducing and more mellow than marijuana.
---
Yeah... That's what they said when they created EoC
---
Here are his stats  [https://imgur.com/a/gmhSFP3](https://imgur.com/a/gmhSFP3)

How many blades did you buy
---
ok should i just play osrs normally from website download or runscape lite.
---
so you dont enjoy corp but want sigils, suck it up buttercup
---
[Shit like this](https://twitter.com/Mort__Myre/status/1204824293856514048)
---
You can report that to Twitter
---
Well shit
---
I'm personally a big fan of RuneLite.
---
Free, open source, and lots of quality of life features.
---
Please add collection log like feature. So people can try and simulate how long it will take for completionists to finish.
---
Also, can you do something like, give an input of X, open that many caskets and show updated collection log? This way people can run simulations that average out to how many caskets means all unique items quickly.
---
Husky was so condescending and demeaning/dismissive in his responses. Hopefully he was given similar instructions regarding his interactions on twitter.
---
In a game that has this many stability issues there is a large chance that you will lose your HC status to factors beyond your control. Keep this in mind when spending your time and effort in this game mode. Imagine the disappointment when you disconnect during an activity such as bandos.
---
I mean this would be optional, there can still be the repetitive grind doing the same course available, this can be just an extension to those who find agility too boring. Just make this slightly more rewarding maybe
---
“Stop.  Get some help.”
---
Seriously though, that’s addiction.  I mean, the game itself is addicting but doing gambling type tasks is even more addicting.  Make an iron man or just limit yourself from going to the arena.  
---
If you want to gamble, it’s better to use fake money like GP instead of going to your local casino and gambling away your actual money.  Why not live a little and change to PKing, still technically a gamble with RNG, more things to do.  More things to see.  More bot farms to discover and disrupt.  
---
Or take a break and get a new hobby.  Then come back to OSRS with a clear mind and don’t go to sand casino...
---
Nahhhh bruh. Fuck that.
---
The gauntlet needs some much needed QOL before adding more uniques to it. Ask anyone who has done 300+ corrupted gauntlet and they will agree.
---
But what I find hilarious is that they initially wanted it to be a 10% magic damage bonus.
---
I get deliberating over adding it to the game at 4%, but they must have been smoking some insane shit to think that 10% was pollable
---
I think the 2k bots used to crash a world were fresh F2P accounts. Thus they can't vote.
---
Insane conflict of interest Lmao ok
---
LMAOOOO so all the other mods are whiteknighting for gee???
---
If it makes you feel any better, I once projectile vomited on the NYC subway train. My boyfriend swears that he has never seen so many people run away so fast - they all crammed themselves in one section of the train like a bunch of sardines in a can lmao.
---
A kid was the only one, besides my boyfriend, to stay beside me. Afterwards, when I was done, the kid offered me a plastic bag lol.
---
0 risk
---
lol you do realize that they still occasionally ban gold buyers to make an example out of them, to instill fear in the RWT community? 
---
You say there is zero risk, when there is in-fact risk. Odds are I won’t be banned - especially if I RWT with reputable brands who know how to minimize risk - but that’s a risk I’m still not willing to take. There is too much sentimental value to even place a small risk of ban on this account.
---
Happened to me 10+ years ago. Used pay by phone without telling parents. (I was like 15) mom calls phone company and says it shouldn't be there blah blah, so they remove the charge. Few weeks later my account is "locked" until I repay my debt. Worst part was it was for a few months and I could ONLY mail in cash to them. Of course my parents wont pay for that. Was decent first account too
---
people were upset when that gauntlet boss hit through prayer. No one would accept defense as a thing needed anywhere and would reeeee about not having 100% protection prayers
---
Looking at that addy (G) guy flexing on those noobs
---
Thats cool :D
---
&gt; &gt;Hey we should be nicer to people
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; &gt;You’ve been brainwashed
---
&gt; How is not being a dick “brainwashing”?
---
Politics (2019)
---
Or if one is being a completionist or going for minnows.
---
No, but they will anyways. On the internet, you have a block feature, in real life, you don't.
---
I know, for better or worse we can only police ourselves. And I have no issue with valid criticism, but I much prefer that it be given in a constructive manner.
---
Lolol
---
I have been rwting since 2010 and never had a warning. So idk. I never bought more than 100mill so idk
---
Like a marble
---
they do "what's right for the game" when it comes to PvM but not PvP. of course PvM items will pass a poll with ease but god forbid ever allowing weapons and armour only to be used in PvP in the game
---
&gt; Next, you just restrict they from botting semi products to a finished one. 
---
Which is a big restriction. Where once it might take them 1x time to sell raw resources, it'll take them possibly 2x+ time to sell finished items. That's double the amount of time Jagex has to kill bots which is huge. 
---
&gt; imagine the shops selling runes always have 75% amount of goods and normal players need to buy them with a high price
---
Normal players would rather use the GE to buy their runes...I'm not sure what you're trying to illustrate with your rune shop example. Bots today also buy out the rune shop. Are you implying that the raw resource bots like ones who chop willows will migrate to player shops? They will be less effective then which is what I'm trying to say. 
---
Will it eliminate botting? Probably not, but it will definitely be a blow to botting is what I'm trying to say.
---
My guy, that’s what this comment from Jagex is about lmao.
---
Best of luck!! :)
---
your mom was on animal planet?
---
Isn't that the guy from "lower the better" series on YouTube?
---
&gt; As a general rule of OSRS, a hit rolls some number between 0 and Max Hit. Damage progression, then, is purely trying to raise the maximum damage. 
---
Right, minor detail here... you do understand there's a skill called defense and armor that co-exists with this skill for the sole purpose to limit the frequency of a hit going through. Your well thought out suggestion abolishes this skill and the armor associated with it as a hit is guaranteed by raising the minimum above 0.
---
This is why adderall shouldn't be perscribed
---
let us attach it to skilling outfit hats, I wanna do festive farm runs
---
You only get fees for transactions that leave you with a negative balance. So if you go negative, don’t use the account anymore. Online subscriptions like Venmo, Apple Music, Amazon, etc will always go through no matter what the balance in your account is, so always leave enough for those to process. Additionally, if you rarely overdraft, you can go in and ask about getting the fees reversed. However, if you’re consistently getting your account overdrawn, you should probably work on managing your finances to prevent going negative.
---
Godamn glowbwanas
---
A jmod forced an update through to make his individual grind as an ironmen better at the expense of the entire games end-game integrity, and proceeded to condescend to the playerbase when called out about it.
---
This response from Jagex reads like a CCP threat towards the people after doing some pretty heinous shit.   The integrity of the game shouldn't come down to which JMODS are having a hard time grinding end game items as ironmen.
---
Not defending some of the twats in the community that literally send *death threats* over this shit but also not remotely impressed with Jagex or this Jmod.
---
Yep, Justiciar is a great example of this.
---
I normally dislike these type of joke suggestions. But this is no joke. %100 want.
---
Loads perfectly fine for me.
---
I mean if some random dude walked up to you and flashed a million dollars for no reason I’d call that a weird flex.
---
Fake news!
---
imagine that, kempq comeback
---
Link to the post of that guy saying this? I missed it.
---
&gt; Ok, the way you put it kinda justifies the harassment
---
No. It's a video game.
---
Cant wait for some 20 minute video that’ll actually be entertaining of some dude 100 hours in a fight cave
---
totally agree. love B0aty :)
---
Is there a way to search reddit for replies to my comments? I dont screenshot the 1% because its the internet. Ive been called way worse things than that tweet since 2000, especially if you count xbox live. 
---
Not that its right to flame others. But people like sanders and trump face 1000000000x more criticism and harassment than I or Husky and they are still on social media every day. 
---
And for the above tweet. Its not even a personal attack. Just a random derogatory word that has no relevance to him.
---
Everyone harasses the mods and directs their anger at them when realistically they are the bottom rung of the corporate ladder. They can't really make major changes or improvements without the greenlight from the upper management.
---
All the things that are obviously huge issues like Customer support for example are because the monkey suits refuse to shill out the cost to improve it but tell the mods to report the bad news to the player base so they take the beating and it's not like they can openly complain about how mismanaged it is without getting the boot.
---
And I'm not entirely sure how much change the executive members can do because the board of directors still have several Chinese members I believe that could be heavily influencing company decisions. It's mostly speculation at that level though as I can't find much current information on who makes up the board or who owns how much of the shares etc.
---
[deleted]
---
I havent personally done it but see no problem with it. I have a monthly subscription running on my account so I dont really know what the bond prices are like, and I dont have to stress with selling stuff to obtain membership. Its a legit way to get some money and so many people are getting their membership that way - all around a good thing Id say. 
---
My moneymakers are random slayer, gauntlet, bossing (mostly Vorkath and DKs) and I inject it straight to leveling up my skills haha. Im more of a skiller than anything though - chasing that elusive achievement cape :)
---
It took me about 20 minutes to get. And imo, any small amount of xp gained is worth it. There are a lot of other things they are focusing on atm, this doesn’t seem like something that needs to be added to their plate.

Yeah...

**Trouble Brewing:** one time for Morytania diary, then *maybe* some fashionscape hunters. 
---
**Mage Training:** Just enough personally for Bones to Peaches, bots farm Mage Book/Infinity Boots/Wands and sometimes robes for fashionscape. 
---
**Jiggig:** Never again after the quest. Bet most players couldn't find it on a map. 
---
**Chompy Birds:** Just enough for diary requirements. Pretty sure nobody wants to be here. 
---
**Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup:** Just enough for diary. I dunno, maybe some bots hunt Gout Tubers but I really doubt it. 
---
**Beer brewing:** I'm pretty sure most people don't even know this is a thing, and forget about it promptly after the Keldagrim quest line. 
---
**Shades of Mort'ton:** Actually kinda fun, but I think most people bail out after the quest because the rewards aren't great. 
---
**Temple Trekking:** If you can leave Morytania, you probably haven't done this all that much. I think it's pretty fun but it's possible to make it boringly efficient by bailing out of every event. 
---
**Fishing Trawler:** Nobody wants to be here, if some other way existed to get the Angler's outfit then it'd just be 1-2 times for diary. 
---
**Gnomeball:** Once for a diary requirement, then I've never seen anyone mention it again. 
---
**Gnome Restaurant:** Only reason I know this exists is because someone got killed in Inferno trying to use the reward. 
---
**Puro-Puro:** Bots. Bots everywhere. 
---
I'd love to see some of these games cleaned up and made a little more fun. Shades would be decent with some more XP slapped on it; even if it's never made "efficient" there's no need for it to be so stingy.
---
No that's not the issue.
---
The issue was that on corrupted gauntlet, even if you went in with T2 armour and a full invent of food, and played the boss perfectly, you could still easily die. 
---
Now its at a good point where if you prep and pray properly you *should* be able to complete them 95% of the time
---
True, people should accept shit.
---
And just because he chooses to defend harassment and abuse doesn’t mean you should call him names.
---
It's a meme.
---
Holiday events are always about the memes. 
---
Get with it.
---
That wasn't the point
---
I think he’s a ork only one of his kind in game
---
Technically, the lumberjack is the only skilling outfit that is worth getting if you're stopping at 99.
---
HEYO
---
Exactly this, and is also why twitter (which is a lot of high level or maxed players) has a drastically different view on things than Reddit, which I'm guessing more casual players flock to. Call twitter toxic all you want, but at least it's a good voice to counter the more casual playerbase.
---
I'm willing to be at least 75%of the yes votes just looked and thought "sick, a new item" and voted yes without worrying about meta at all. 
---
&gt;with a player base since they only think they know what they want a lot of the time.
---
Player base was also very against the EOC but Jagex in that case thought they knew better than the playerbase. Look how well that turned out.
---
&gt;The content is the reward, not how much money you can make
---
Really goes to show how much this community's mindset has changed when this isn't popular. We all wanted old school because, pvp and combat system aside, it was just too meaningless earning money in rs3.
---
All of my rs pvm friends stopped playing because of how easy it is to make money, that everything needs to be 2m+ profit/hr consistently. Pretty much an entire clan of 16 people I would play with on almost a daily basis gone. There's no substance because the money reward has been made more important than the fun had making it. The game is unrecognizable to them, and I don't blame them. 
---
Why the fuck does everything have to be inflated in rewards AND solo content?
---
Difference is, it worked. You get nothing from crying here.
---
Because that wouldn’t make any sense ..duhhh
---
I love that subreddit haha!
---
He said it could be Chestbrah... Do you understand jokes?
---
Their life of celebacy has left them less potent.
---
Oh no he said simulating instead of simulation, clearly esl /s
---
The outfit isnt ment for people that only go 99.
---
Gz man!
---
You might take some flak for that, maybe try this:
---
“Shout out to the Jmods who do things that make this game awesome. If you are a Jmod who isn’t making the game awesome, please start doing so. &lt;3”
---
And yet a Jmod responded to the Reddit post presumably before his ticket was sorted.
---
Agility is a good early skill, run energy is precious. Theiving is another, gets you some start up cash and a variety of loot. Food from bakers, cash from pickpocket, fruit stalls can give you strange fruit (recovers 30 run energy) when you can do wall safes in rouges den you can get gems pretty easy. Just a few ideas for you
---
It doesnt change that all those off hand mage items have almost 0 impact on anything at all. Not a single off hand mage item has a significant or noticable impact on what you're doing. You buy arcane when you run out of things to buy. It is the most disappointing 100m+ upgrade you can buy.
---
Jagex is so bad... Let's have a poll system for a community driven game - we make the decisions 
---
\-Jagex: Nah
---
A lot of it is not valid criticism that is the problem
---
Your first complaint was about whether or not you'd play any of the games available by nature of the genre and that's meaningless to comment on purely because it was casting a wide net for all types of games out there for various interests.
---
&gt; you set a fucking low bar on what is 'good'
---
Plus, you aren't even following your own criticisms.  There's nothing wrong with not being a fan of indie games, but you still type in hyperbole for some reason.  Just because you interpreted the wrong message from my post and devoted a whole paragraph to it doesn't actually mean you are saying anything.
---
OSRS isn't even technically a AAA game.  It is an MMO but it is a game that banks on a huge nostalgia trip with a functional feedback loop similar to Cookie Clicker for leveling practically all of the skills if we go by standard leveling.  However it owns up to interesting gameplay due to major design flaws and combat-related content like high tier PvM, PvP, and even some skilling.  British infused wit mark the dialogue and story in the questlines which round off an interesting experience for the player and a solid contender that marks its own territory in the MMO genre.
---
So I say a statement like "we play a game like OSRS" and expect an open mind when approaching indie games.  To double down on your aggressive stance towards independent gaming studios that push out unique experiences and games that are solid experiences is an issue that is on you; your opinions on the matter are actually very closed-minded in the end because not giving the time of day for these games is just purposefully closing yourself off from forming a valid opinion.  In this year you can still give OSRS a chance but dismiss indie games as not worth the time is just disappointing but also ironic.
---
&gt; demanding games made by rich AAA publishers to not be as good as games they made before is a perfectly reasonable demand as a consumer and you can't change my mind on that!
---
Frankly I don't even know how this was assumed of me.  If you actually understood my stance on indie games at all, it is that there is incredible quality in good indie games if you actually take the time to try and explore the offerings available.  But the vast majority of indie titles are very cheap and in contrast to the churning of some AAA titles, indie games try to offer uniqueness and a fresh take with solid gameplay to boot for such a great price.  This translates to the disappointment of bad AAA titles now that get worse and worse and offer much less "value" than some of the solid contenders in the indie slot.  It's tiresome for me to see another CoD game come out that is usually repackaging itself, but I applaud a solid remake in Resident Evil 2 for PC due to its polish and fresh look on its own old story.  Seeing another average Assassin's Creed that is now plagued with microtransactions is disappointing because the bar is getting set lower and lower and the consumers will still buy it, usually for its star power in its "TRIPLE A GAME" status and probably the franchise too.  Yet I will applaud the likes of Persona 5 being such a successful addition to the franchise on release, the newest God of War surprising everybody with a well-rounded game, or Red Dead Redemption 2 being a solid sequel to the original because they made a game in their specific genre that doesn't compromise in any part, story included.  So I'm eager to see how The Last of Us 2 plays out given the quality of the first, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for yet another Battlefield or even a Pokemon game because I'm out there for quality, AAA or not.  But, it is satisfying to find an indie game that I would personally enjoy (currently playing the indie game Bug Fables because it is practically a spiritual successor to the glory days of Paper Mario/Thousand Year Door) because $60 for another bug-riddled mess with forced DLC expansions and MTX with a half-baked story and/or gameplay is just not great as a norm.
---
___
---
tl;dr: Indie games are cheap but amazing gems if you find the ones that are right for you.  AAA releases are getting complacent due to their "big budget" and appeal.  Those companies have nothing to prove so putting out another game in a long established franchise with major flaws is fine for them but difficult for an indie studio to do.  Stop misinterpreting (you have done it twice now) by jumping the gun and speaking in hyperbole, plus attempting some pointless personal attack to validate your argument.
---
I'm ending it here because if you somehow go on to attack me over an extremely misinformed opinion you hold for a third time, there's no point to continue.
---
there's a difference between no laughter and responses of "that was dumb" "not funny" vs being called a ni**er, fa**ot, and i wouldn't be surprised if there were some death threats from the less socialized members of the community.
---
There's actually this entire fucking thing called risk vs reward.
---
Sure you can invest probably 200m+ in order to hit **up to** an 80 on someone, which you can only follow up with a DDS spec at best. It also has a 2 tick delay so that people with good reactions can venge off of it. 
---
While doing so you'll also be in robes, that give near zero defensive bonuses, and open yourself up even more to being killed and lose 150m.
---
So yes, I'll say its balanced

It was a fucking joke, he's not literally adding content to make his grind easier holy shit get a grip

---
Thank you, you are a gentlehuman and a scholar.
---
Yeah, because after years of playing this game I'm not dumb enough to assume poll results are set in stone. I'm sure everyone has been unhappy, at some point, over polls. Jagex will poll something and change their mind, poll something and never do it, something will fail a poll and be added to the game anyways. It's how it works.
---
Yes!!!!
---
Remember literally only a few weeks ago when that streamer got falsely banned mid-stream?
---
False bans happen.
---
Yeah if the story is true thats like thousands of dollars worth of gp
---
If people bring it into the wilderness then it's absolutely no different from them bringing an AGS... Aside from the fact that black dhide gives a bunch of magic defence and is the norm for people in the wildy

---
*nothing* holds it's price spike when it's first released.
---
lmao pet wagon it’s the best name
---
I'd also be fine with nerfing the harmony orb. perhaps decrease the staff's % damage buff if the harmony orb specifically is applied to it. As long as bis at 99 and 120 mage are roughly equal I think it's a good choice. I personally don't mind "devaluing" sigil. With the polled changes to ToB, higher accurace = guaranteed crab freezes. Perhaps the siren book could also have negative accuracy instead of higher accuracy, to make it even more niche.
---
What
---
The main reason why this straight up cannot happen is because it would make the game super uninteresting. Currently, the way we negate damage in high level pvm (the only place this discussion matters, nobody is using an arcane or this tome at fire giants) is either by praying effectively, or moving effectively. That's not a coincidence either- forcing the player to move, attack, or change prayers *is the only way to require skill in the game*. These are the mechanics by which the game is made interesting, and there are really no alternatives. 
---
Any scenario where damage is simply unavoidable and you 100% have to tank it no matter how good you are is boring and doesn't require skill, so the vast majority of high level pvm (with the exception of basically just verzik bomb) isn't designed around mechanics like that. It's designed so that negating damage is done skillfully via movement and prayer, not boring and stupidly by wearing tank armor. 
---
Tanking isn't good **and never can be**, unless they add no skill required boring content to the game.
---
Boofing caffeine is where its at
---
I've got hacked before and I couldn't recover account. A couple years later I tried again after it got banned and goti this time when it had max meele stats botting dragons. I mean a response on why I couldn't recover account would be helpful, if they just need a little more info. They can technically do anything since you signed terms of service with your account.
---
Correct.
---
Because they got more input. Easy answer.

---
But ok keep thinking you know the details because of some misinformed witch hunt
---
To an extent I can understand passionate responses from people. This game is the only hobby a lot of people seriously partake in and when a change is made that “devalues my x Ironman” which is a way of saying this makes the &lt;insert unhealthily large number of hours&gt; grind I just did completely meaningless it can upset people. That being said personal attacks or threats are never okay, but heated debate is a sign of a healthy community.
---
hahaha
---
RIP my irredeemable main who got banned for botting in 2019 when I hadn't played since early 2018. RIP lucky angel. Only ever play the main client and love my auth protected Ironman now :)
---
Alright fuck you guys
---
Yeaa I guess lol
---
what other poll result has passed and then been reneged? 
---
the only one i can think of is the hitsplats and thats because engine work
---
Took a leaf bladed sword instead of arclight to skotizo.
---
the harassment and the fact that it was a bad addition are two separate issues. 
---
just because people were harassing a mod doesn't change the fact that adding the tome as proposed was not the best thing for the game. if some people weren't socially stunted assholes they still would not have added the tome.
---
And "get thousands of bots to stand in the same place and do processing-heavy tasks" doesn't exactly take a genius-level intellect to figure out , as crash methods go.
---
But really what time is a good time to stand up to a community? Props to you for even trying.
---
Crop isn’t challenging? Zulrah is harder. Corp just takes 90 people or 1 person with a house, a cannon, and a dream. There’s a reason there’s farms of bots at it rn. I personally think those people gave jagex the business about “ruining my Corp farm” and helped persuade them off of it. I still like the tome, but damn if this new boss isn’t loaded with rewards.
---
This "first firecape" post puts all of the rest to shame. This is the kind quality content we don't even deserve. Bring it to the top boys.
---
Best tanking ever in any runescape video ever. Damn.
---
Aight, thats it,

GET MY GUN WE BOUT TO ROB A WELLS FARGO
---
Meanwhile two weeks ago they were creaming over him lmfao
---
And kempq was involved too
---
that would mean they would have to remake a lot of bosses since this game's bosses are balanced around prayer switching and stuff
---
It’s 3. Kempq, rendi, xzact
---
Everytime you see someome drive a ridicuously expensive car, has an expensive watch, designer clothes etc. that's essentially what they're doing. Flashing their wealth right in front of you.
---
I'm really happy of the decision. On one hand, it fucka with people who panic sell the shield and people who bought mages book to make profit. And on the other hand, it shows people that they should stop trying to make the best of price fluctuations and if they do, they should accept that all of it is market speculation and you could just lose all your bank value in a week by flipping.
---
I love the attention to detail, even just the bots chopping a tree! Brings back good memories and still looks like this on populated f2p worlds.
---
Everyone mad: holds stacks of mage books
---
Everyone else: truly understands why it was removed. ( and kept their arcane)
---
Not gods, mere mortals, like myself. And I guess I’m making the assumption that they want the company they work for to continue to pay then.
---
I always thought damage soaking they did back in EOC worked well. At least that way higher tier armor soaked more damage, instead of getting a higher % chance of taking 0 damage.
---
Maybe they want a severence package and a better job tho
---
Those are my crocs...
---
How is any of that made up? The server crash method was pretty obvious.
---
Blowpipe and then Chins when healers come out for easy mode. You have like a full 2 seconds everytime to process which prayer to turn on/keep on
---
Ayy random ornament kit. Solid fake luck here

I don't know anything about the situation but Jared has a point.

I've seen tons of shit like this, tools for games that are kinda like simulators that are only a fraction "complete". Why does every developer of stuff like this post it around when it's barely done?
---
You didn't know what you voted for.... we're going to go for a second poll with 2 options: no to sirens tome and yes to not having sirens tome.
---
And you absolutely have to have it for Jad right?
---
And I’m over here sitting 88 levels higher than him, unable to defeat Jad
---
Ummmmmm, probably? Seems like a reasonable thing to assume.

did they say if The Nightmare of Ashihama will be a solo/team boss ?
---
The problem with Arcane is that its a really weak off-hand BIS for Mage. Compared to Avernic for Melee its garbage and Ranged doesn't need an offhand since Blowpipe and Twisted bow are 2h. I feel the Tome after the nerfs was an appropriately powerful offhand BIS.
---
Your brain is driving your body! I’d say that’s operating a vehicle.
---
Yes, I got a mining pet at 55.
---
What even is this? Only been playing for a few months
---
Yeah the poll is really more just to prevent them from putting things IN the game that we vote no to.
---
No its just called being a decent fucking person. Sorry that that is such a foreign concept to you.
---
That's like saying people shouldn't invest in businesses because it would just be a waste of money if some businesses didn't or can't use it faithfully. There's a lot of mutual benefit to both parties when it works, but of course if it gets too risky then nobody will want to invest. Just like investment, the pros of engaging the community have to outweigh its cons for both sides to benefit. Mitigating the cons isn't something that Jagex can do; that's on us.
---
Not after you complete the first one.
---
With buckets of sand they talked to really talented knowledgable ironmen about what would be reasonable rates, very lengthy thorough discussions with many analyses conducted.
---
When buckets of sand then hit the poll booths JageX had decided to scrap everything they had just talked to knowledgable players about.
---
Hmm
---
SHIT, JAGEX TOOK DOWN YOUR SITE MAN

I thought I had hid this post, thanks Reddit! I had posted a picture with this but it didnt work :(

I know he is just so washed, do me a favor and try to even come close to a cb attempt like this and post it for me?
---
Must comment, this deserved more than just an upvote lmaooo
---
Yeah, i got bought arcane for 102mil yesterday. Waiting it to raise back up to 140m+
---
From mage book i Made like 20mil in first day they went up, after that i didnt touch them.
---
I started flipping on the 6th of december this yeah, i am up like 60mil now, and if i sell my arcane now, thats extra 30mil+ profit
---
HP is more important than str in dh
---
Damn. Rs is a hell of a drug
---
I agree, I don't think rendi would be so obvious with the name, unless he thought we would think it's too obvious this making it surprising again.
---
I commute about 4 hours per day to and from work :) mobile’s been very nice for that.
---
Lol he didnt lose a potential 200m, with that logic anytime you kill a boss and it doesnt drop the biggest loot you lost money. Not how it works. Any flip has the potential to gain. As long as its positive its a win, and not any loss
---
How long did it take for you to get good at flipping
---
I just hit 100 and just try whenever I get a Tzhaar task
---
I’ve tried 3 times now, wave 40, 1 shot by jad at spawn, and then I got him to half. Should only be a few more tries 😅
---
Isn't there a dude who has that going on currently.
---
That's not why people are upset with Rendi. It's because he acted like a child and tried to blame Jagex for not responding to him. There was a great mod response to his video.
---
?? That's Runescape 3. This sub actually for Old School Runescape, which is a based on Runescape from around 2007, right before EoC.
---
No mmo tells you what you were botting for a macro ban.
---
I've always heard they make ~ $20-30k USD
---
Is the blade of saelador (spelling*) no longer BIS slash weapon?
---
Non-melee offhands are bad because magic works in a very odd way, and range is almost entirely dependent upon top/leg range gear and the weapon (90% the weapon/ammo). Because of the way magic damage works, staves with +% damage completely outclass all armor - I can put on full elder gear and do worse dps with an ancient staff than if i was naked with a staff of the dead. In fact against a monster with +200 magic defense and level 1 magic - a person with 0 magic bonus and 15% magic damage bonus is better dps than somebody in +74 magic bonus and accuracy is 80.71% vs 91.05%. Most mage accuracy comes from your magic level and most magic defense comes from the opponent's magic level - this makes magic damage % increases WAY stronger than accuracy bonus. In fact 0 magic bonus and max magic damage bonus is better than absolute max mage bonus (excluding the damage bonus you get from it) up until your opponent has 99 magic and 23 magic defence bonus or 1 magic and 870 magic defence bonus.

Mobile is working, I'm on it.

Until we get a level 3 with Fire Cape this ain't gonna stop
---
If you train your mage a little bit you can telegrab wines and sell them for decent starter cash. You could also loot pvp world's. If you're unsure what either if those are a quick YouTube search will certainly yield some guides
---
I hope a bunch of Jagex guys invested money into the shield before they announced it lol.
---
It isnt unfair, It was the right decision. Tomb wasnt a necessary update, and it created controversy. All the people that are able and did invest in the tome and it failed is part of economy.
---
People invest in companies all the time with potential of things happening and lose out. Its the way this shit works.
---
JMods and their ironmen ruin PvP as well because now nobody wants to put content there cuz ironmen bitch and moan
---
Yeah that's such a baffling response. We're talking a BiS in fucking runescape of all games and he's whining about grinding? God forbid someone grind for something in runescape.
---
I really liked that they added auth to the stronghold of security now. (You cant get the final emote without 2fa)
---
Hey, ocasionally I'll hit somebody with my car, sue me.
---
Have you not seen the toxic hate that has poured out onto reddit and twitter? These toxic people are the followers of these loud mouthed streamers. This game should not be tailored around how they think it should be.. When a change happens that they dont accept look at how toxic they are... Why give these idiots so much power? The poll system is for the players. The players voted YES that should not be changed no matter what.
---
I wish they would have done this with Brexit.
---
I don't think Corp was ever balanced to be solo, it just so happens that it is possible to abuse mechanics to make solo kills pretty easy. If you couldn't abuse spec spamming or leaving the boss room at the right tick to avoid damage then it would be very difficult, especially if you couldn't suicide spam to leave food on the floor for an hour.
---
Is that 24 stacked unnoted tin? Lol wtf

Sweet hockeystick.

Didn't they fix this in rs3?

Honestly skilling is the best way to get your money up espexially mining/wc/rc najor returns abd after a week or two you will be amking over 1m a day minimum
---
EoC did nothing to effect their profits, actually they put a ton of work into that instead of something to maximize profits from MTX such as SoF and Solomon’s store.
---
New staff completely destroys sang staff in most situations so it's power creeped that too. Also technically this armor is just another armor that's better than justiciar, although bandos filled that role already.
---
And Kempq is still theorizing lvl-19 firecape.
---
Yeah but that's not weird at all though
---
I mean, theoretically at some point we may just need to start raising some caps slowly.  Skills could go over 99, gear could be higher tiers.  I know that's a very unpopular idea and maybe it would never fly, but like you said there's some point in the future (5 years?  10 years?) where further progression and development of the game is just no longer possible within the confines of "everything must remain consistently relevant as much as possible".  It's honestly fairly impressive how OSRS continues to receive significant updates over time without destroying previously existing content constantly.  In every other MMO I've ever seen, older content is always becoming obsolete with new updates, all across the power spectrum.  At some point we might have to accept some amount of that.
---
What is this about? Are there any specifix examples of this someone can link to me?
---
but growing harassment towards their employees is less disturbing? Why should they be forced to subject their employees to mistreatment.

Jad wave is definitely possible to tick eat

i only seen one other on here that was b4 whip

Yea maybe they should call that update something like "Combat Evolution"
---
we pay we gay
---
They are not adding the tome
---
# So targeting an individual Jmod is nothing new and has been happening since OSRS started. Yes, it is not nice and leads to sleepless nights; but the bit that irks me is talking about it leading to reduced engagement. That feels like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
---
How fucked do players have to be to be harassing Jagex Employees over this game?
---
Go play WOW or Pokémon go or do something to better yourself. 
---
Not one jagex employee is holding a gun point to your head that you must play osrs.
---
But its been decided that although passing it isnt being added so im unsure what you are ranting about
---
What is a wdr mod? And what is a scale world record? I'm very out of the loop, sorry.
---
He downvotes you because yours works. What a salty bitch
---
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing the past couple hours getting through the requirement quests, I don’t even really watch the video just listen lol. Just figured maybe reddit would have some good advice on top of the guide, and you guys came through like always :)
---
&gt;Now if they made it so you could buy superior combat abilities or something to make combat easier by paying a fee, then absolutely that’s fucked.
---
That exists. Auras and many high-tier combat pets are unlocked via loyalty points, which, and I'm sure you can guess where this is going, are earned based on how much money you've given to Jagex. You can also literally buy xp.
---
As far as monetization is concerned, RS3 is basically a cash-grab Korean mmo. That's not to say it's completely without merit or enjoyability, but at this point it exists almost entirely as a vehicle for mtx.
---
Kind of sounds like you're one of the neckbeards..  js..
---
pass the ranarr bro
---
If you have 1 hp, you can never take more than 1 damage. If you eat in the same tick as you take that 1 damage, you’ll heal rather than die. 
---
e.g. if Jad missiles you and you eat a lobster in the same tick, Jad will take you down to 0 but the lobster will heal you 12, giving you 12 hp.
---
certain damage like ranged damage is calculated before its applied to your health, so if you have 5 hp and the ranger in the fight caves tries to hit you, it will probably hit you for a 5, so you eat up after the damage is calculated and before the damage is applied, and it still hits you a five, but you dont die
---
&gt; It doesn't really matter what item the hasta builds into, as long as the hasta and zammy boss don't become dead content.
---
yes it does. it's the difference between good and bad design. That comment alone ruin any reason to take this argument seriously.
---
&gt; Why does there even need to be a crush weapon specifically for this slot? All that matters at this level is what levels up your combat stats the fastest. DScimmy 60-70, whip 70-75 then everything else is endgame gear.
---
stab, slash, crush.
---
Did you just said why does there need to be a crush weapon for lv 70? Fuck this trash post LOL.
---
&gt; how can you not think the bludgeon will crash when everyone upgrades to the mace over time.
---
i never said bludgeon wouldn't crash, i said it's time is in the past.
---
The people praising the mods and being positive on this thread are the same people who are constantly criticizing the mods and being negative on the subreddit.
---
There's a response to the message you just replied to stating exactly what he said. People are *absolutely* upset with Rendi because they think he's caused the crashes by releasing the video.
---
Account where you turn yourself into a chinchompa. I thought I'd seen it all.
---
Works fine. Maybe include 
---
"MY Mobile is down - Anyone else?"
---
wait what the fuck? seriously??
---
this calls for a longer rant
---
That looks like ~150m profit tho
---
Not being added so why dont you stop crying and put whatever a pacifier is (cock?) in your cum stained mouth
---
Basically, when the damage of an attack is calculated, the result is something between 0 and your current health.
---
There is a window after the damage is calculated and before it hits you where you can eat, and since your health is now higher than it was when the hit was calculated, you are sure you will survive the hit.
---
That's a very basic explanation, as I have very little experience doing it in game, but I think there are a lot of videos explaining tick eating with a lot of details
---
Good decision imo
---
Yeah I felt like you hadnt read todays dev blog. Will stay tuned for the sequel
---
Yep. It's predatory as fuck. No different from a loan shark offering 2000 dollars at 300% interest and if not paid within x days they get your car. They are banking on the fact that poor people have literally no other option besides going hungry or losing utilities.

Sure EOC ruined the game but in itself wasn't 'nefarious'. It was an illguided attempt to improve the game. EoC killing the playerbase is what caused the rise of MTX. 
---
Again, Jagex is a Corporation. It's main goal is to make profit. That's not an inherently bad thing though. 
---
And also like I mentioned those are largely different teams anyway. Mistakes were made, lessons were learned.
---
Limited ressource in a competive environment. And if every world is full tough luck
---
I want to harass mods too
---
unfortunately I've never once seen one get harassed, instead just an army of cocksucking
---
That's a great idea. I also think that due to the fear of powercreep in OSRS, additional niches need to be created in the game. Most high level pvm is dps/prayflick-scape. If we want to continue filling niches with BiS gear, additional niches should be created.
---
I don't get why people make the game so political in the first place. I've been playing since I was 6 and I haven't cried, complained, or bitched about ANY aspect of this game.
---
I'll put 50m on it not being Xzact. Shake?
---
I mean you can say whatever you want I'm not here crying to be unbanned and about injustice. I have no incentive to lie. My account is unlocked and I'm pissed about it, but it is what it is. I didn't cheat.🤷‍♂️
---
Usually yeah but I was at full health. I'm not dh'ing goblins, I just happened to be wearing dh today when I 2 hit a goblin.
---
Go kill other intense bosses. Go solo Zammy gwd
---
Commenting to remind myself to check back later, I’m also very confused.
---
Unpopular opinion when you think or see a medieval mage you think tome/book in the off hand slot bot not a big ass shield. bis mage off hand should be a tome/ book with what can be assumed is spells written in the book
---
Yeah but they don't want to rework magic because it would be way too much of a headache rebalancing the entire game. Currently like 80% of your magic accuracy is based on your magic level, and the magic level of the enemy. Magic defence and attack mean basically nothing outside of pvp as you won't ever mage something with a magic level above 4 in pvm because blowpipe is probably better.
---
Thing is, I have no problem when it comes to competing for skiller resources because in the end at least someone gets the reward, usually whoever is fastest or has higher skill level. But with kills, no one gets anything. So all your time and resources are just wasted because someone decides to tag the enemy *once*. It's such BS.
---
Not if you NDA too
---
Why do we see this same post any time any studio makes a mistake on a game? We know this already. Posting it repeatedly isn't going to make the psychos change their ways.

It's next best to Ely, and some people doing ToB might not exactly have a 600m shield on top of likely wanting a tbow
---
I’m not arguing RS3 went down a massive MTX rabbit hole, Im just saying EoC as an update was not the problem.
---
Personally I really liked the loyalty store, it makes sense to incentivize keeping membership to your game and the rewards were nice but they weren’t (at least when I played RS3) over powered to the point where I felt like the loyalty points were worth spending 10 dollars each month even if I wasn’t playing just so I would have them to spend if/when I returned.
---
50mil
---
My issue probably either came up from the day he recorded selling it being different than when I calculated or my thoughts of how much supplies would’ve costed him was lower than the actual amount. Oh well
---
Thank you for this. I literally never knew that. That’s so helpful for my initial panic lmfao
---
k, get infernal
---
the dialogue had a bunch of typos and grammar issues aswell. tsk tsk tsk
---
Try the same comment on Twitter, the n word.
---
Still is too many. I don't see how they can see they have a lack of rewards for new bosses and then lump 7 onto one.
---
Split polls in the future. Poll the first 3-5 ideas and then if a significant amount fail run a second poll. Why they think polling 7 and them all passing and then knee jerk reacting to remove one is a good decision... Idk
---
No. Jagex does not and will not balance content around 3pc.
---
How did he manage to lower his combat level?
---
Yeah and if you're not one of the first people to do that you lost money because you bought it at 140m 6 months ago to do ToB/CoX and you can only buy/sell it for ~90m because that's the current price it's trading at. Again it's dumb as fuck if it's your primary gear.
---
"we can't take people tweeting at us, so if you keep doing it we will listen to you even less than you do"
---
I get people go to far, fuck those people, but don't threaten us with reduced community engagement
---
Is gauntlet harder than ToB?
---
its negligible. arcane atleast has some nice def/prayer which are usually irrelevant too. this also isnt even considering the fact its only useful for trident/sanguine + ancients. if youre on regular spellbook for some reason youre going to be using tome of fire anyway. arcane is basically dead content idk why people are gatekeeping it so hard
---
Its from mrjones1991, i also got like 20
---
How do you get in a clan?  No One responds when I talk in game and I have no friends to play with
---
Menu entry swapper, swaps ‘talk to’ with ‘bank’  so banking with a banker is always just a left click.
---
Rendi said (when xzact got the current record before whoever this is) that he wont try as he didnt see how 14cb would be doable, and he didnt want to bust match being 15cb as thats not a record
---
It’s common practice to consider lower profits as a loss. 
---
Don’t confuse operation costs with upper management padding their wallets. If you break even then you’re considered a dying company, the goal of a corporation isn’t profit itself but constant growth of profit while cutting out costs. 
---
OSRS maintains its purity because it’s target audience would instantly abandon it. Don’t think for a second Jagex wouldn’t RS3 this bitch if it’d make them more money.
---
Ppl can bitch about him dropping racial slurs all they want but when PvPers were being civil, no one gave a shit and only cared about the tome, then when one guy drops the n-bomb suddenly everyone is able to see the issue, even if most only care about the racial slur, it improved the visibility of the topic by a lot.
---
Jagex takes SOOOO much shit from the community its maddness
---
Mrjones continuing his path of scamming
---
i woldnt even bring a shield while maging zulrah that last switch cba anyway. staff/blowpipe/tbow no offhands is how i do it
---
No it doesn’t?
---
Itt: bunch of mad people that didn't watch the qna so they're making assumptions as to why they made their choice.
---
The boss has 7 rewards guys, they said it in the qna. That's why the removed it.
---
My guess I it'll be back in 6 months for the inevitable raids 3.
---
Why would u buy those books for 20M anyways? There are a lot more books than there would be attachments lol
---
Also if someone hasn't played before why would they wanna speed through the first levels? I mean there is actually more to do in members with more fun really, but if the goal of members is to speed run the account first time... Probably not going to work out that way lol and even if they do go for ehp I feel like that's a lot less you get it or the game first go around
---
Instead maybe something you add to the Arcane that corrupts it with dark magic and makes it more powerful?
---
Wait y'all have pets??
---
gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Sarasword until you can afford an abyssal dagger
---
What way is that? I understand the aspect of people overly harassing jmods and that's not cool, but how would anyone give feedback? It seems thin-skinned to get questioned on Twitter to the point where you need to threaten reduced community involvement. That's exactly what this community needs, to be listened to less....
---
Good idea but the amount of PvMers crying that they got killed for a few mith or addy bars on their ironmen then spite voting PvP updates is enough for me consider voting no
---
thanks for the link, but yeah i know the spawns now. Looked into that after i died on my 2nd attempt
---
Both of which are useless in pvm, which is where dps is far more of an important metric.
---
Range can safespot using objects, mage can safespot using spells, melee can tank with better stats.
---
This is going in the epic gamer pasta pot. 
---
Unfortunately, with the competition this year, I don't even know if yours makes top 5. 
---
This is the strongest contender this year
---
&gt; You committed the ultimate cardinal sin, you got personal. You, as a team of professionals trying to make money, got personal. You got personal and decided to insult your playbase, calling us "ass-hats" and "freeloaders". Not a wise move.
---
&gt; We won't forget this. You've set a new tone for the kind of interaction we'll be having with you. It's a cold one. One where there aren't any illusions about the reality of the situation. Previous notions of "family" are dead. We are mere consumers to you, and that is obvious.
---
&gt; You have chosen to bring in a new era of hostility and bitterness. Well done. Great PR move.
---

---
How would you be able to get a blowpipe before fire cape lol
---
Treasure seeker! Temple spiders for me.
---
You’re helpless. Good riddance.
---
Yep, I agree the pathfinding when your character has to run to get into range (always goes 1 tile further than needed) is enough reason to bring the crystal bow if you're not familiar with melee range of the monsters.
---
Something I'd strongly recommend is turning on NPC Indicators in Runelite. You need to put the exact monster name in there, each monster separated by comma. It shows what tiles theyre occupying, so you can avoid melee range HEAPS easier
---
I've never heard of Aslog before(googled random names), but if my friend said "Aslog Aland had a plan" I'd assume it was a person.
---
I mean if your banks 400m, and you invest in arcane for a full mage setup, that's 10% of your bank.
---
It's a name man
---
What's this Arcane you speak of?
---
Boooo hoooo
---
KQ has people doing upwards of 256 of her, just for the desert diary

This is the 3rd time you've posted this.

where is the timeline of the tracing lol that's the important part

Just so long as you drink said delicious milk before it sours?

Its a hard life pickin stones and pullin teets but sure as god's got sandals it beats fightin dudes with treasure trails.

And I should have invested in apple and Amazon and Google 15 years ago. Hindsight is 20/20

Quick glance at these comments show almost no one here has worked a customer service job. Under no circumstances are they obligated to accept harrassment from yall. They dint get paid to be harrassed
---
You choose to limit yourself
---
But but but Jagex bad
---
You’re a sainf
---
I for one would love to see a tank mechanic at this new boss or whatever future boss they come out with.  Its a shame the ely has no real PvM use, same for Justiciar and the Bulwark.  And "Tank Method Inferno" is just bullshit, that shouldn't be the only use justi/ely.  Thats a one time use and most players either don't attempt the inferno or don't use the tank method anyways because its only good if you aren't good at prayer switching during the inferno.
---
after about 6 months and a lot of losses
---
So I never used a Cannon before since I am still pretty new and as an Ironman, what are my efficient ways of getting Cannonballs?
---
Drakes are hit or miss. One min kept getting them now 3rd task dry no hard clue.
---
What happened that made them say this?
---
It’s almost as if Ironman mode was made to be more challenging than mains
---
It's an official game mode with a significant portion of the player base playing it, content has to be designed with them in mind.
---
That's not the point.
---
He added something to the game that only Ironmen would ever have need for.  
---
It doesn't matter how few people use it, it should have never been added in the first place.
---
Or how about just buffing the Arcane so it isn't complete shit and the tomb wouldn't be a straight upgrade? You also don't know how long on average the tomb would take to get so saying it would have been quicker/easier to get is complete speculation.
---
Do it with melee. It’s easy enough.
---
Yeah, personally I’m against the tome. I’m also against the way some of us behave.
---
That kid more manly than 80% of new york
---
The idea of the grubby chest was that if you get a key drop, you can get the supplies and use them on the spot. What's more likely, that the intention they quite literally told us they had for the chest is... Well, that, or that they used the chest as a backdoor for something that no ironman ever will use?
---
Gonna bwuk you up.
---
the signature is a nice touch. i especially like the framing on this work.
---
But why not open a new client to log in?
---
Just ignore him and hop.
---
I tried that
---
Tough luck? but they changed lock picks.. saradomin wizards.. ploughs.. competitive environment my ass.. They decide what they want to change based on how many people cry about it.
---
That’s the twitter nonsense, I don’t have links for anything there though.
---
It's a meme. The first time Rendi did the Lev 18 FC a couple Kemp Q fans were like "I saw it in his discord it's Kemp Q". They were just talking out of their ass, and they said the same thing when Rendi's record was beat.
---
I think you missed the investment
---
Agree
---
I def. clicked the jad one,I was gettin exp all the way till jad cause I was watching waiting for 91 to hit. The task ended right as I killed jad an if I did click the other one I still didn’t get my 100th task points. I didn’t gain any points at all.
---
If you go to Settings, then "Advanced options" you'll want to toggle the Side-panels options (bottom left)
---
Except Druidic ritual, a classic exception
---
Saylor by any chance?
---
and that's why no one remembers your name
---
^or mine
---
Ummm. Maybe 3rd party clients. Fake email. Fake runescape website. Your friends. There's your answer
---
It is easy, but probably not for noobs? I never really saw a need to try it but I know how if I wanted to.
---
Might wanna turn your private chat onto "friends" or just off, that way "people" like this won't waste their time simply ruining your day.
---
Simply put, sand crabs are not the place to look for friendly interactions with other players lol
---
this is kinda sad
---
There's a clues roll step at the volcano as well if that counts.
---
Higher than this
---
A lot of people.  They're not gunna phase out Bandos any time soon, so why would they completely destroy anything to do with Corp?
---
&gt; Sorry dun wanna waste time arguing with you
---
Yeah me neither. Given the way you type, I wouldn't be surprised if you even understand what I'm saying. If you can't see how extracting a raw resource and selling it takes more time than extracting a resource, creating a finished product and then selling it, then it's hopeless to continue further.
---
Later.
---
I highly doubt that was the idea at all.
---
If it were then there wouldn't be a roll for stuff like noted Herbs and Runes.
---
Never had that happen. People have been reporting a lot of bugs after the cold fix.
---
yeah sandcrabs is major aids.
---
id highly recommend trying to knock out quests for fossil island. or at least turning your private chat off and being ready to hop if you run into someone being petty.
---
I meleed jad on rs3 before I realized you didnt have to... After getting the cape. It still sucks prayer switching for jad three way
---
This wouldn’t be the best content. You clearly haven’t ever been to the blast furnace.
---
Lol saltyyyyy
---
Nah. I mean why dun you just open a new client before you are blocked? Coz I play two account at the same time and often logout automatically because of sometimes need to focus on one account. And never got any log in problems.
---
What’s the real price atm?
---
RSPS's back then: "Wow! This server even has a working AGS spec!"
---
RSPS's now: "ToB was released a week ago, why don't we have it yet??"
---
Stop it. This is my new favorite anime.
---
Someone had 10 mage books lol
---
You're probably just bummed your mage book merch went awry
---
/s
---
But honestly, did you read the blog for their reasoning? It's valid. Items like this are purely power creep, rather than redistributing power, as they should be doing.
---
And here I am struggling with Galvek and Kruk at 92 combat
---
That's great!
---
&gt; It's next best to Ely
---
Ely &gt; Crystal shield &gt;&gt;&gt; arcane
---
&gt; people doing ToB
---
would use the tome instead(not that we know the price it would end up on), but the point people are making is that the new tome would make the arcane pretty trash, and I have to agree with that and so did Jagex.
---
I’m confused why mage book is dropping when it is now still BIS for mage?
---
Massive bot farm in 50 wilderness?
---
No....This is RuneScape!
---
I totally agree with you. But can't we just have one God Wars styled boss where mage is optimal and profitable? Like how we use a tank for graardor. Or Kree'arra you have to range. These bosses are as simple as they come, but require multiple people to be done efficiently. It'd be awesome if Zilyana was susceptible to magic imo, because then people would ice barrage her and such.  
---
Current enemies you mage include:  
---
Barrows, Dagannoth Rex, Lava Dragons, Kraken, Zulrah, and some raids bosses. I've heard KQ blood barrage can be decent way of speeding up kph by healing, but even regular KQ is terrible gp/hr. It'd be pretty easy to design a boss that is optinal to mage, but benefits from range and melee def.
---
Used to use OSB way back, runelite now. Never shared credentials with anyone personally. :/
---
What’s not true about it
---
I gathered aha!
---
If they polled 'should we make the Tbow 10x more common' it would pass a fucking poll mate. That's because we're players, not game developers. We vote on whether we like the proposed content, but 99.9% dont know shit about game design. So quit your bitching and quit making 3 posts to drive your point.
---
Wear ring of wealth, might get a shield half instead next time (:
---
IDK what that is my brother.
---
Xact or something was 16
---
Wait what happened?
---
My professor for thermo, he smoked us too
---
I agree it's absolutely disgusting. I also find think it's a strange coincidence MMK left shortly after the reddit memes about him, after he had the courage to stream on twitch. For all we know he could have been sitting on job offers and that could have been the straw the broke the camels back.
---
Lol usually I might merch for updates but I've been away from the game for a while, been looking forward to this update to bring my interest back to the game.
---
Get a few hunter levels and start doing bird houses, you'll be at 1070 total in a week for barely any work
---
Watching somebody perform like this hurts my heart. 
---
Don’t get me wrong... It takes talent to make music that people will enjoy. Be it a dj making songs on their computer or a band getting together and writing/recording songs. 
---
But this is not performing. I feel like attending a show like this is just so you can listen to the artists music on the house sound system with a room full of people. Very little in the way of showmanship. You’d get the same experience if the artist wasn’t even attending.
---
While I agree that the Nightmare still has plenty of drops, ignoring the community seems pretty stupid to me. If they thought all of the potential rewards passing would be too many, then they shouldn't have polled all of them at once. Maybe poll the armor and the mace, or the tome, staff, and orbs, and if all of whichever set of rewards they polled passed, then they could be done with it, if they failed then they could try again with different possible rewards.
---
But that's not how they did it, so they shouldn't go back after the fact and say "this is too many rewards so we're not going to put one of the drops you voted for in anyway."
---
Same thing is happening to me, I need two zenytes but keep getting the rarer drops instead, including celastrus seeds etc.
---
