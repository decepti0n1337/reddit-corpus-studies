Could anyone help me with a duel arena clue step?
---
---
---
Right, but the majority of players are content with the official client - the one Jagex allows.
---

---
Like I said, should there be no more centralization, it opens up a huge can of worms for them.
---
Wrong information from the wrong wiki, go figure
---
Nice
---
Young me from the mid-2000's is really impressed

LMFAO why are you so offended

Not offended at all. Just find it funny that you‚Äôre so insecure you find it weird that someone took 2 seconds to look at your profile

I mean, if you dont like people adding nothing to the thread, why are you adding this to the thread? Like yeah I could just up vote and move on, you could just down vote and move on. All in all who cares either way?
---
assuming you're getting hit often enough that blowpipe specs aren't more than enough to heal you, then yeah sure.
---
Deal with it
---
If you find a better picture of a group of JMods lmk.
---
I'm all for 3rd party clients, but RL+ is going to get them banned..
---
theres always gonna be a lot to take in if ur coming back after a long break, ive been there. a lot of things I think could have been done without tbh. but some things aren't so bad and were needed for the game to grow and people not to get bored. just wiki stuff you don't know and read up on the updates when you're doing smething afk . or ask friends in game what something is if you aren't sure.

Right... I could always do like 200 hours of temple trekking like swampy boy. For the final exp.

Thanks

On top of the mentioned, aim for the BIS mage cape, the imbued god cape. This can be gotten from Mage Arena 2. I myself am working on this, and have only gotten the unimbued version (mage arena 1). Please note it is a wilderness task, so research it and don‚Äôt take anything you aren‚Äôt prepared to lose.
---
this text only comes up, if you 
---
A. Talk to your mining pet 
---
B. have already set your mining pet to be colored based on Daeyalt, which is useless other than getting out of the mine in meiyerditch 
---
its not something that most people will ever come across or notice. and the dialog actually fits with the lore. Efaritay actually has a tale in RS lore, and it being something the myreque wouldnt tell you actually makes sense aswell.
---
the only thing they did was put the dialog into the format of the meme
---
something like Hatius Cosaintus is an example of hamfisted stuff, or the captian khaled npc in zeah
---
Howd u make the money for bandos at cmb 87
---
There's also a thanos meme in that Zeah volcano.
---
Ah yes, nonchalant zoophilia. The classic trope
---
The whole point of OSRS was that it was not going to stay the same. Jagex asked players if they wanted new stuff added into the game, players said yes. Some of the stuff has been great imo. We've gotten sequels to classic quests such as Monkey Madness and Dragon Slayer.
---
So yes it is OSRS as it is based on the backup of Runescape from 2007. Also the best part is you literally don't even have to touch any of the new content.
---
My ‚ÄúYou did me a favor and hired me as a young developer, so I took full advantage  of you as a company and don‚Äôt feel bad about it one bit‚Äù look.
---
They‚Äôre gonna pay ROT to hold down the area.
---
This is the worst video I‚Äôve ever seen
---
It's a shame olm gets so boring once you're in max. Suppose there's CM for that though
---
So zeah rc for elemental runes?
---
Very original! Been loving all your stuff man
---
It's true that OSRS isn't the game you left, but RS wasn't static when you played it either. In 2005-2006 they introduced 4 new skills (slayer, farming, construction, hunting). Compared to that, the OSRS team has been conservative in what they implement &amp; stuck to the design philosophy that RS3 had forsaken.
---
There's tons of guides online (youtube is saturated with em) to bring you up to speed, but give it a chance. Come for the nostalgia, stay because OSRS is actually pretty darn good
---
Yeah fire zombies. That sounds about right.
---
i am a btw btw btw
---
Again, it affects more than just pvp. It completely devalues my account
---
\#2 would be infuriating to get
---
Ah another to the collection of run escape related dad jokes, take an updoot
---
I told some dude in a CoX to dwh guardians instead of d pick speccing and he spent the rest of the raid shit talking me. Really don't get people in this game lol
---
Meanwhile whoever I've spoken to that has used a Bulwark at the chaos altar tells me, "I literally can walk out when people try to kill me with a water staff and xeracian robes but once people start bringing actual magic gear more towards end game they catch almost every freeze and I have borderline 0 chance of escaping."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If people are trying to kill you when you're wearing black d'hide and a bulwark while doing prayer training, but they "risk" 10k in gear, they have absolutely no right to be complaining, especially if you consider that a lot of people don't bring black d'hide but rather something like Justiciar body, because your not fighting back.
---
Seriously if you want to kill people praying at the altar THAT badly and feel like their dinhs is a problem, maybe consider that they're not planning to fight back and consider wearing more then LITERALLY beginner content gear trying to kill someone wearing late/end game gear.

Tips on what to do after b gloves?
---
Not wrong though
---
There are already free and buy ins.
---
All the plugins? Breh half the plugins should be in the base game
---
Ah yeah ur right. Idk though, dont rlly care for the monster boxing method, huge advantage that shouldn‚Äôt even be in game. If a single pker is on you from post 30 wildly ur objective should be to hit 30 and teleport and the amount of pkers doesnt affect that
---
No

I'm 27, most of my clan is around the same or older.  PM me if any interest in joining, we do mostly PvM and the occasional PKing adventure.

Way more dedication than I have, ha
---
And I'm giving feedback that those portions are good, should stay, and should be modified and added to.
---
Lol I wish I had money to stake. I'm just trying to go in the FFA clan wars portal, and people only go there on world 2.
---
Yeah my name leads to some funny in game scenarios. Met a lot of awesome people in the game :)
---
Opinion on what? There would have been no reason to create a mobile version of a game that was the least popular it had ever been. The risk would have been too great for very little expected payoff. After large and frequent content updates became the norm and the player base shot through the roof to be even more popular than it had been at release there was a real reason to believe the game would be around long enough to make the effort to create an entire new client for entirely new platforms worth the time.
---
Tyvm!
---
Maybe us players in our 20‚Äôs should start a clan?
---
Appreciate it!
---
Tyvm mtx my butthole
---
If jagex added proper xp/h trackers, a bank value indicator, a GPU renderer and maybe some small QoL stuff like the osrs wiki lookup orb, ground item texts/some type of highlight system and quest/playlist filters there wouldn't really be a need to use third party clients at least for me. I'd love to use the normal client but it lacks too many of the even basic things that make life a tad bit easier.
---
Devalues my not being a sack of shit ironman.
---
I actually did tho . " use karils or dhide because he attacks with magic and melee" also said I used to use rune cbow and I showed the potions I take . No clue what ur on about
---
Hahahaha, case and point made. Truly a treasure
---
Most of people who grind castle wars are pures they can't really contribute too much even if they were actually playing.
---
Anyways be nice to each other lads cuz at least one of you is actually a 7 year old girl irl

Puts things in perspective

Dude cool? Who hasn‚Äôt autoclicked high alch mage these days? I‚Äôve had 5 accounts that mouse recorded mage

Yeah whatever fuck u

Especially these days

And how did I not do the mechanics I recorded the whole fight and went over each stage . Gtfo

The faux intellectuals are my favorite to come across on reddit. If you break down and get upset at any little disagreement maybe you shouldn't be on here my guy.

F2P combat training to base 40 takes a lot longer then just a few hours. Don't set false expectations for the poor guy.
---
That being said, sure P2P base 40 is easily done in a few hours.
---
What setup is for magic and range accuracy for maxed tribird gear as well as for budget tribrid gear?
---
Agility becomes the worst skill after 77 rc
---
How long does a Halo take?
---
Is that from a sseths video?
---
Yeah except let‚Äôs make it 30x more complicated, have massive effects on PvM and PvP metas, and completely rewrite the skill from the ground up every week until it‚Äôs tolerable enough for people to vote yes on. 
---
Also we can explain any inaccuracy or weird quirk with ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs magical‚Äù.
---
The argument should never be based on what the person is risking or not when it comes to a skulled person trying to kill a non skulled person.  The reason why the skulled person is risking more is because they're trying to kill someone else and take their stuff.  Risk reward.
---
Is she gonna sit on it?
---
Note 9 here and it's great. Pen works perfect, makes everything super easy
---
Are the people you're speaking to bringing zero brews?
---
Not really, but it can be finicky when dragging items/moving them around either in your bank or your inventory. I never really have to tap anything on the curved parts of the screen, but when you have to, the pen provides that extra precision.
---
Id rather have 3rd party clients pushing the moral of integrity of the game than have to play on the vanilla client. If jagex were able to implement features of QoL that the 3rd party clients bring i'd be for wiping the 3rd parties, but I don't think that's going to happen.
---
Fuck yes, that would be great.
---
Oh that's interesting, definitely seems like 60 att will be the meta for pure pking if the gmaul attachment becomes that risky to use.
---
Black d‚Äôhide protects my shovel. Fight me.
---
Did any pkers complain about splashing on black d hide in pre-EoC RS2?
---
very blurry
---
I hate you :( I‚Äôm the only Ironman in the whole game without dwh
---
I think it's runelite doing it. Happening to me as well.
---
I definitely agree. Agility will be my last 99 without a doubt. The ardy course is definitely better than seers but it still blows.
---
\&gt; You are saying a lot for someone saying very little. 
---
Ironic considering you've provided no evidence for any of your claims and your argument seems to consist of brainlet strawmen.
---
\&gt; WHY do you think it was a bad nerf? Explain. 
---
You're the one advocating for a change in the game, it's on you to justify that change.  Why do you think it's a good change?  Other than your feelings being hurt when cabbage robes splash off a guy who literally cannot attack you.
---
\&gt; aside from the REEEing you are doing. 
---
This is also ironic, considering the instant &gt;:( downvote from you, and considering the fact that this nerf was suggested by Jagex entirely due to pkers reeing on twitter about a shield doing what a shield should do.
---
wwwAAAAAAAAA
---
The bot mafia do what the bot mafia gotta do.
---
Extended antifire pot + antidragon shield, use a d scim and rune body+legs, kill green dragons with a looting bag?
---
If they gave it up to 50 charges that you can grind in stronghold it wouldn't be bad at all. Make every monster/some monster have a chance at a common tertiary drop in addition to their normal drop. Boom, not dead content.
---
Maybe get some bis gear fgt
---
Beginner clue?? Since when?
---
It is! It also has some special meaning to me. Id rather not share in public but I can pm you if you want?
---
Cool novel brotendo
---
Proud papa! This is awesome!
---
They defenitely can. They just dont give a shit because its pvp.
---
Lmao, a single video from 6 years ago with barely 5k likes and 150k views *in 6 years* and a petition that didn‚Äôt even reach 50k supporters. Definitely the majority of the community bud. The original private 2006scape beta had more active people than that and the original petition to bring back 2007 RS had over 10 times that many signatures.
---
It‚Äôs also from someone who quit after EoC rather than long before that like the majority of the OSRS community who quit from a combination of horribly dead pking, no economy, bad updates, and micro transactions that were everywhere long before pre-EoC.
---
Honestly I've haven't thought of that, but that is quite a suggestion.

Selling 13 spades is the new GE begging meta.

Ah, the voice of a noob that never crafted body runes before

So you leave me out of shades raid ;_;?

"Mom said it's my turn on the Run escape"
---
Does it work in OSRS? Will test
---
16 bit Runescape nice.
---
Alright your math checks out I was wrong. :)
---
Any lagging or anything like that? How bad does it drain the notes battery? I feel like osrs sucks my iphones battery dry. And then when i charge and play on my iphone my phone gets hotter then the fires of hell.
---
Any issues like those on the note?
---
As the two fires change color in the background
---
Lol Agreed. I don't know why people are downvoting you, it's true though.
---
OSRS wiki is your best friend. Make sure you use the official wiki and not fandom! :)
---
Hello there!
---
Do lots of quests. Skips a lot of slow early levels.
---
I haven't used OSB in years.
---
General Graardor!
---
XP tracker is in the default client. 
---
Item text on the ground is unnecessary.
---
it's my biggest regret in life :\^(
---
it's the new meta
---
Yes I‚Äôm sure  I just did 99 woodcut using infernal axe. When it decays the axe is destroyed you and get the stone back. You then need to use the stone on another axe.
---
Training up my slayer to do MM2, currently at 66 and hoping to hit 70 this weekend!
---
just to flex
---
Nope looks trash
---
efficiency. you log in, get xp, and log out. dwaddleing around is a waste of xp
---
11. Declare your intention to quit after a bad update, then login 2 days later
---
Osrs hasn't been out for 17 years!
---
Trick 5 players into using their special with atleast 0:45 till next round
---
No dailies thanks

Should've been the title
---
What did you stuff it with... almost looks like he's sleeping
---
i always fletch
---
There's a guide called Osrs for Begginers by Theoatrix. It's suuuper complete, pretty much a tutorial to all of it and it's a long video too.
---
Many people are playing it right now, it all depends if you get into it or not. It's a grindy game want it or not, so expect to throw hours a day getting skills up and doing quests.
---
Go complete the tutorial, get immersed in the game, go complete the Cook's assistant quest and you be the judge if it's worth it or not.
---
Go watch streamers, see what they're doing and if you find it interesting to be able to do those things like raiding or killing bosses
---
It isn't GPL
---
I would definitely recommend it, although one big thing is to understand grinding is a major part of old school. As for tips, I would say start at f2p, and understand the basic game, maybe get levels, and do some quests. If you enjoy it and want more, then switch over to p2p.
---
‚ÄúThat doesnt feel like guthans spear‚Äù
---
Link
---
Never heard of it
---
&gt; Use ten different expletives while fighting other players in the Wilderness.
---
that's a lot of gamer words
---
Well done! You have completed an easy task in the Public Chat area. Your Achievement Diary has been updated.
---
Toggle your slayer tasks so the master disregards your combat level.
---
pretty sure the vast majority of people who play this game are 21+
---
Somebody has to use all that Flax irl
---
$11
---
he's an idiot so whatever LOL
---
The fuck is this weeb shit
---
I have a question about monster weaknesses on the wiki. [Take blue dragons.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blue_dragon) It says their weakness is magic/stab/ranged, but they still have a very high defense for that. Is it just that they're slightly weaker at defending those attacks than others, or is there some additional modifier for magic/stab/ranged?
---
Haha yeah thats the sad truth :(
---
yes
---
no it's not, the norm is a lot weirder than just "odd sex talk"
---
Bob the cat didn‚Äôt need to die.
---
he's in too deep, no stopping him now
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
This is a valid complaint and I would not mind getting a more effective one.
---
Idk why but I like that name alot.
---
I was just playing while charging for like an hour or so and no heat problems. My phones usually plugged in while I'm playing at night so I can't answer about battery drain, the note 9 has a 4k MaH battery tho, which is pretty good. No lagging problems. Everything loads fine, not just runescape, service/wifi permitting ofc.
---
With curved glass, don't get a screen protector btw. I'd recommend using Liquid Glass over your screen when you get the phone instead. Soaks into the glass and cures, making it way tougher. Curved glass and screen protectors don't get along very well
---
Can the ten expletives be in one message? And on the same note can I tell one kid to hop ten times in rapid succession
---
#1 wouldn‚Äôt be possible if your level is an odd number though
---
I'm at 74 points rn, how much is it to skip?
---
Also what def is required for slayer helm?
---
Do ppl eat these?
---
Your not wearing pyro tho
---
No thanks
---
that's for the medium diary
---
Amazing! Thanks for the info! Any way someone could take a picture of the phone  running the game? Id like to see it if i could
---
But wildly tasks dont reward you with points, do they? I didn't get any when I finished 120 mammoths
---
The crab looks completely fake like it‚Äôs VR or something, that‚Äôs why I specified. Pull the massive stick out of your ass I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cool to have an iPhone?
---
I will take this advice ty
---
They do, they give the most points of any slayer master at 25 points per task. 
---
But you have to do 5 wildy tasks before you are eligible to receive points.
---
300k per hour isn't that great tbh. I don't expect anything to change for the worse. Zamorak grapes are massively overpriced compared to the wine output, so it's probably a good thing if the grapes drop in price.
---
10
---
I'm sorry if this is a noob question, but why do people scribble out their stats n stuff like that when they show off cool stuff?
---
Fury
---
Game mechanics that change on location like that are confusing enough
---
Start with b ring imo especially if you can imbue it
---
You hit the monster with -65 slash so you dont gain combat exp, on the same tick as ur main which kills the monster, and you both get exp
---
More points.
---
Actually I use:
---
Dins (or battle staff+Ely)
---
Torag helm
---
Arma top/bottom
---
Bandos boots (sure I should be in guardians)
---
Suffering (i)
---
Barrows gloves
---
Phoenix neck
---
Range cape
---
I also loose 13 inv slots in gear for hunter.
---
:l
---
The shield is strong enough against range and melee that the pker is forced to use mage, and mage against dhide + pray mage doesn't work very well, no matter what gear you are wearing whether it be ghostly or ancestral.
---
I'd assume that was a lot of people trying mobile out wherever they were (not necessarily new players).
---
lol
---
Imagine the Dinhs being so strong against range and melee that it is higher dps to mage against dhide + mage pray... Oh wait, thats reality, you don't have to imagine it.
---
Prob doing research and going under the radar so his methods still work as well as they normally do. Cant let those bot farms catch on ya know
---
Jagex will auto-censor gambling bots for you.
---
You forgot a classic "Say Nice after someone mentions you their level on any skill"
---
*69*
---
I do find the pen to be more of a nuisance than a help. I havent used it since mobile release.
---
The lightning to firewall has to be the most infuriating death
---
When i was learning zulrah, i somehow didnt catch the fact that she sometimes ranges during mage form, and i legit thought the game was bugged because i kept takin heavy damage despite praying mage
---
Idk why but I read this in filthy franks voice
---
You automatically lose the upgraded on death even if you are protecting it or not.
---
Slayer level: 100
---
Oh shit son
---
"trash pkers" pvmers kill npcs all day lmfao. Get off of reddit and go back to larping as a bot before you ruin your efficiency.
---
The fuck is runelite plus?
---
I was 20 tries in b4 I realized this lmao ( Did Range rotation only, skipped other with logouts to learn)
---
Try not starting farming the day before your bond expires
---
i made one because i cant stay away from the duel arena after i end up bored on my main. well worth it
---
I had to turn the monitor off real quick and hide in the computer room closet once to avoid my mom. But I never got caught either.
---
It can be done at 1875 total if you get 93 slayer with 70 hp, 70 atk, 70 def, 70 range, and 76 str. Realistically you need right around 2k total because of the combat.
---
the game basically works on how you want to make your account. There's no set goals, and everyone's account is different. The best advice is start doing quests. That will require you to explore the map, level up your skills, and really give you a feel of how the game works.
---
I don't suggest paying for membership until you finish a lot of the f2p content first. There really is so much to do even in f2p, like easily 100+ hours of content, and there's nearly infinite replayability. p2p unlocks thousands of hours of content.
---
Seeing as information was shared via word of mouth it's not surprising that new content gets ripped apart in the age of wikis knowing every detail and 3rd party clients existing to literally give us answers to doing anything.
---
The boys? I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt follow. I pay alone majority of the time, sadly
---
Wouldn‚Äôt Ava‚Äôs be useless since it doesn‚Äôt pick up bolt racks?
---
To speak from the Skilling community, we dont get to use a lot of shortcuts even at 99 agility.
---
And never will. I don't want catered to, I just wanna be able to hop across the river to fly fish on the other side.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt a god cape be a better alternative to Ava‚Äôs b/c of prayer bonus and the fact that Ava's doesn‚Äôt pick up bolt racks
---
Saw you hit it today on my pure (Nwaalllday) nice work!
---
Not to mention the fact that Pest Control was absolutely dead at the tail end of RuneScape 2 and so OSRS gave it a huge boost in relevancy
---
I havent done it either, add me and message me in game.  Username is Chunkyman68.  I should be logging in in like 20
---
Good bot.
---
Doxed and murdered by the botters :0
---
You never have to bank with bloods. They‚Äôre made differently than other runes. You don‚Äôt use pure essence. I‚Äôd def look into it. Check out a little guide. Rc is my fav skill to do while just chilling watching tv or whatever.
---
Have you done the math?
---
Tell me the magic defense bonus of someone wearing black dhide body and chaps, nezzy helm, b gloves, mage cape, dinh's, glory
---
Now tell me the mage offense bonus of someone wearing ahrim's top and bottom, infinity boots, barrows gloves, book of darkness, occult necklace, toxic staff of the dead, mage area cape
---
The mage has a 17m risk skulled with a +1
---
The dinh's is wearing a 28k risk unskulled
---
The player with dinh's still has more mage def than the ahrim's has mage offense, and that's ignoring the def bonus from brews, too.
---
What do you think?
---
You are so ignorant :O
---
the dogs still getting put down
---
I have 68m WC exp and guess how many I have.
---
Yes.
---
Zero :)
---
nah im out. ive been back for two months rebuilding stats and if this level of faggoty ass shit is allowed now ill just go back to drinking.
---
Imo yes
---
You could always work towards buying Bonds. They're about 4m each  and give 2 weeks of membership. As a beginner it can take a while to make that so I'd recommend just paying the $11 but late-game it's pretty easy to sustain bonds.
---
That is nice...
---
"Jad is the BOSS of the fight caves minigame."
---
Could have confirmed that for ya 2276 total levels ago
---
He is saving the trees wtf is your problem mindlessly slaying Ents and taking the logs for your own greed???? #savethetrees
---
+1 mage def
---
Fishing be like
---
I've had pots three times on two different accounts, it feels so bad man
---
I added you. just lmk when you wanna try to get this quest done
---
You got the kq head for desert elites, and then you went back and grinded a second one for the helm before getting diary cape? Absolute mad man
---
Hey we dont know when the update is coming. Maybe you'll get a wave of motivation. I'm not sure. I'll probably stay 50 for awhile before making any changes.
---
Oh ok I didn‚Äôt know of the bond thing, that is pretty sweet
---
I've been torn for like a year if I want 31 pray. I misquested my account and buried bones to 13 pray. I cannot use ancients or have an altar in my house.
---
Mainly I dont get 31 pray because there are a lot of raggers /rushers in my bracket who target me when I'm looting. I feel like I'd get ragged even harder with 31 pray and an obvious +1
---
well i'd safely say doing slayer with a 2m bank rather than a 300m bank won't hinder your enjoyment by much at all, just get over your grief of losing and you'll be all good my dude. start chilling out and working on your slayer goals mate
---
I hate myself. Melee only rotation, hide from all attacking phases, and get lucky. It's really time consuming but not bad once you get used to it.
---
i left almost 6 years ago and am enjoying my life much more than as a young adult
---
Hey nice to see you again! Gl pking my dude
---
I wish they would just incorporate all those ideas into runecrafting lol. Literally has crafting in the name and a rune is the same as a sigil/glyph which are used in some other games for magical crafting or spells..
---
Are you new to runes cape?
---
you think the memes you see on fb were made by those pages?
---
I did it for a bunch of games lol
---
Dial up was so loud
---
What's your total level?
---
You could have waited till 75 range and do it with the toxic blowpipe
---
I agree with revolvinq, slayer is the best way to train combat and make money at the same time. You just need to get to 75 so you can get gargoyles (I make over a mill per task sometimes).
---
Upgrades that I can see are upgrade Hard-Leather shield to snakeskin or green d'hide shield, use broad bolts (with Rune crossbow) or emerald (e) mithril bolts, and use proselyte instead of initiate.
---
Inventory seems alright if you change your ammo and crossbow.
---
Training firemaking but everytime I light a log I say you're fired
---
Good bye
---
No you cant, you could try the new boss, Sarachnis, if you want to duo a boss. Its made for mid levels and you can fight it with other players.
---
Woox walking the gunfire
---
Saying stupid shit on virtually every post on this sub.
---
Nothing says 50attack low risk Gmaul prod like a pure with 6k kills
---
It's pretty effective. People complain but it's honestly not that difficult to tank to 30 line and tele out. Even when tbed you have an option for escape because of all the aggressive npcs at pk hot spots. Singles teams have to have a level of coordination when focusing a kill, so it's not as simple as it sounds. Even when people are falled in on you and you're unable to see who is hitting you, all you have to do is turn on auto retaliate and you can see what they are doing.
---
haha i dont care about karma
---
Raising your combat level allows you to try other slayer masters.
---
Taste my knowledge sounds like something I would say after nutting in my osrs gf mouth when we role-playing
---
Right.  I highly doubt the way magic rolls are calculated has chanced since like 2007  though.
---
While you are correct, you missed the point that OP was trying to make. 
---
A player with 40 attack, 80, strength, 1 def, 80 hp, 80 range, 80 magic and 70 prayer is only 68 combat. Which is equivalent to 54 in all combat stats for a typical main. Thats a significant difference in dps hence why mains are at an incredible disadvantage. And the pure loses nothing from having only 1 def as they‚Äôll be praying switching anyways.
---
It's common for people to not worry about bringing a bgs over dwh, as dwh specs can still miss. I don't think I've ever run into someone that actually felt the need to switch, but it could be seen as worthwhile.
---
You get over 10m gp on the way to 99 thieving depending on what method you do. It also doesnt take long for the 99 conpared to the other skills.
---
Belle delphine more like baelle delphine
---
I‚Äôll give thieving a shot
---
What teammates?
---
Lol that t bow is at least $700
---
I like many others PK to have fun.

You're funny lol
---
::bank
---
When u reach 99rc u instantly become mgtown and a ferdora appears on your head
---
So accurate
---
We all play the game to have fun, not saying no one is having fun. Just saying that, if Jagex really wants people to try out PKing, there's gotta be more of an incentive to PK. So outside of fun, what're the incentives? Well, probably the money
---
Why you got LGBTQ in your name then lol
---
Elite or master clue maybe
---
17 years straight? But OSRS came out 6 years ago.
---
TLDR of the video is that they're rare drops(based on combat level) in pre-eoc, rs3.
---
They come with pairs of skills, ie firemaing and woodcutting, agility and summoning, etc. One of the skills is always assistable(via assist system) and one isn't.
---
You need to open 4 pairs of skkills (lv91, 93, 95, 97) each awarding xp(15k, 20k, 25k, 30k) in the skill you chose.
---
After that you got a dragonkin lamp, which awarded xp in a skill of your choice based off it's level.
---
Something like this happened to me today with a user called Nize It Yute. I didn't do the trade out of fear after seeing this post, but I just wanted to know what the results of this whole ordeal for OP was.
---
My item is....wait im not going to share my secret money maker
---
Did you do seaweed and herbs runs a lot? Or just fruits trees haha
---
Also I think a "mild" congrats is in order!!
---
Don't forget that girls instantly trow there panties at you everywhere you go, it almost gets annoying after a while.
---
"If they were smart" is not really fair in my opinion. They would then have to hire many people to keep it up to date. And they'd probably need to remove many of the "OP" plugins. If this were to happen odds are many would be annoyed and just continue to use branches of Runelite created by other people.
---
As it is the client is a big factor in people playing right now. There's a 3rd party system, upping their player count, and they don't have to pay a dime. Now that is smart. (Not the "right" thing to do, but from a business standpoint it is smart.)
---
I think dragon bolt (E) needs to be replace with something else.
---
Small correction: Damage rolls from 0 to max, with a uniform distribution.
---
&gt;For every 4 str bonus you get +1 to your max hit
---
This is also incorrect.
---
    Max hit = floor((320 + (strength level + 8 + stance bonus) * (strength bouns + 64))/640)
---
Where strength level is your visible strength level (aka after potions), multiplied by prayer and/or other bonuses.
---

Now u have it wont have to worry about it ever again and u have 20m to get good gear too.

I've done quite a few wyvern trips now. Running with full blessed d'hide (for Protect from missiles when still aggro) + fury/Dragon crossbow/amethyst broad bolts. I've averaged around 300k+ each trip :) think I might hold on the anguish for now and save up for full bandos which has been a long time goal. But did want to ask is it worth bringing a book of law and switching between the mind shield when safespotting ?
---
Mahogany trees and papayas, i didnt do any seaweed
---
:D
---
He's a college kid and I don't think he's played the game in years. All his videos are low level pures. He doesn't hybrid, pve, or much go into deep Wildy.
---
Honestly think he makes videos over the summer and rarely during the school year for extra money. He makes decent videos but isn't interested in most parts of the game
---
You know it‚Äôs a scam because Jagex would never tell you your email changed
---
Adding on to this: Runelite Plus is in no way connected to the original Runelite Client. Their names are similar but please don't associate the two.
---
Not all are the actual lowest but the hard ones are (agility, rc, slayer)
---
What are the best weapons for a Zerk setup?
---
Lets say right now it doesn't have Veng yet and is only 60 atk, and not great str/range/magic yet. 
---
DDS? Gmaul? MSB? Knives? Dscim?
---
I assume Gmaul and/or DDS is the way to go, but what would be best to use as my dps weapon? Is it best to use Range? Or would a Dscim actually be good? Should I use a barrelchest anchor to smack with after? 
---
Any tips would be great.
---
Straight facts
---
I've seen several people have withdraw/deposit all as the primary left click option for the bank interface, how is this done? I don't see anything in the Runelite menu swapper plugin

Gz dude but rip all that time and money spent.. definitely would‚Äôve gone for lvl blowpipe first would‚Äôve made it easier

Florida is so fuckin weird man

Very true, just hate how I get rewarded with the silly lucky drops and never the ones I‚Äôm actually after

I figured because it was calling out the hivemind it would die in /new, but im glad it got more traction than that
---
11. Tell someone ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in wilderness before killing them while they type angry reply.
---
Pretty much same as what i did before. Farm runs for GP and trying for pet. PvM for fun and GP to work towards Inferno gear. AFK skilling for pets while im doing other stuff.  
---
Only diff is i don't feel like i \*should\* finish off skills i dislike, like mining and hunter because i already have.
---
Easy enough to just go to one of the northern corners, people are much less toxic there.

Very true, just hate how I‚Äôm always rewarded with the silly lucky drops and never the ones I‚Äôm after which are never as rare

Thanks man this is very very useful. Much appreciated!
---
I would have been happy with that, I've done over 2k abby demons and I'm like 80 kc at sire with no unsired.
---
Hype for it would lower pretty soon, so, any lumbermill or underground will do.  Wilderness and rc altars, in my opinion, won't count. 
---
Except if you make it restricted. Like "can be achieved only at weekends". I am pretty sure someone will be happy to put an afk alt on every single open roof he finds. Maybe, feeding 301 world with bots that do nothing isn't a bad idea for it. That way the amount of players that would be interested in such achievement will be lower.
---
Somewhere near the South of Al Kharid
---
‚Äî Fk, I had 30min left
---
‚Äî HaHa, sit kid
---
Since most of the people would be just semiafk or alching, "bombing" remote locations by loging there and instantly logging out can also happen. I bet, someone will have 50 bots for 50 roofs to log in once an hour and run around just to mess with people
---
looks a bit cartoony for rs but i still like it otherwise

I mean most of the mods are about the same age as the playerbase these days, but sure

---
Yeah, it‚Äôs the wilderness, you shouldn‚Äôt be unkillable. Like I said, anyone in the wilderness is my target. I right pvpers too. It‚Äôs ridiculous that pvmers are near invincible with the shield. 
---
To be honest, there isn‚Äôt much point in telling you this. You are clearly very stupid and you dodge my valid points, instead rebutting with ridiculous statements about how it wont affect me if I don‚Äôt attack them.
---
I truly hope this extreme ignorance and stupidity is only because of some bias driven by your hatred for pvpers, but something tells me you‚Äôre probably like this in real life too. I suggest seeking help in overcoming this issue. I wish you all the best.
---
It's like 30 xp off being exactly half, that's way closer than "roughly"
---
If ur just remapping a key, ur 100% fine.
---
Its not exactly, so it is still roughly.

if you check the npc list the only seemingly viable L.O. would be the look-out south of wintertodt. not sure though since im not on atm.

---
Rendi I love your content and hope you reach those 1 mil subs. You and swamp man are fantastic.
---
If you wanna be efficient, dont start till at least 70 cmb but probably 90 or so. Lower masters give tasks that are slow/bad xp/bad loot/annoying/all of the above. 
---
Otherwise, start whenever you want with the highest level master you can use. Push for 70 combat so you can use chaeldar, i think she's way better than vannaka. 
---
Fastest points is wildy slayer, it is good xp at lower levels too if you cannon (but obviously risky)
---
Skip/block tasks that you don't like doing and don't give good loot. Common skips/blocks are fire giants, hellhounds, suqahs, wyrms/drakes, and blue/metal dragons.
---
If you can get Jad to 1 hp then you're fully capable of killing him. Don't be afraid to take a break mid fight to get your nerves under control.  I ran behind a safe spot twice when I was killing jad, and it really helped to stop the panic clicks.
---
Yes once you have tormented brace and ahrims you should make the switch to blessed d hides as well.
---
Considering you're in a subreddit filled with active players you're probably going to get a biased answer. You're the only one that can decide if it's worth it for you, but you can't figure it out without trying ;)

You're still safe. Usually a good way to know if it's legit is if it includes your username, generally phishing emails don't. As a safety measure, I always make sure to never click email links (even if they look official) and always check through the website.

[SHOOSH SHOOSH SHOOSH SHOOSH](https://youtu.be/boh92DrYEWs)
---
No one i play with is under 30 you'll be fine.
---
Everyone uses this retarded salad robe splashing argument because they don‚Äôt understand the problem, even if you catch a freeze there‚Äôs no way to do actual damage because it has better tank stats than a torags platebody with positive mage defense, which you can stack with near best in slot mage defense body and legs for 15k.
---
I catch freezes on bulwark all the time, the problem is that bolting or ags will always hit zero and they can tank the freeze no problem.  If it takes a max team fall in to kill a dude with 3 items it means the stats on the shield are overpowered, which they are, which is why it‚Äôs getting nerfed.  
---
Also the pkers are not risking 10k because unlike common perception, they don‚Äôt just have salad robes but a range and melee switch, runes, bolts, and supplies.  Being skulled in even a rags tribrid set is still risking 200k+ on top of the danger of getting pked by a team or max main in a better set.  Most pkers aren‚Äôt even looking for the bone runners but the juicy salad robe noobs who are risking more, the pker food chain is what makes the wilderness active.  The pvmer is the bait that attracts the noob pker, who attracts the good pkers who attract teams.  
---
When you make the pvmer unkillable with a zero risk stat check shield then noobs won‚Äôt go pk because they can‚Äôt even kill someone who won‚Äôt fight back and they don‚Äôt want to risk 1m+ when they are still learning the ropes.
---
One man army by b0aty, sort of a proto-ironman series. A friend's whitecat22 playthrough was very fun to watch. If you're looking for older stuff, TehNoobShow is always fun with their "gods exposed" series. Godsword set from scratch is RS2 but still amazing. Same with corp from scratch. Good luck hunting
---
quite a few people actually.
---
I tried this but it still gives me the same mail address.
---
The amount of gmauls that will be risked won't even compare to the amount of alchables that come into the game hourly, but it's not a terrible suggestion
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).
---
It was ment as a joke if it came over as being arrogant or me having a ego I apologise, sorry.
---
H
---
We gotta start somewhere. We can't just add a bunch of new updates that bring a shitload of cash into the game just because we already had alchables.
---
Thanks. I have looked through my mails and it isn't the first time my mail was 'changed'. I have send a request to change my mail in the past and was addressed with my in game name in the legit mails, so I think you are right when you say that you have to look at whether or not they address you with your username.
---
Gz
---
That sounds more like opportunity cost then a gold sink.
---
The email address means nothing since you can spoof it. Hover over the link they want you to go to and see what site it goes to.
---
Yes it's allowed. They aren't breaking any laws.
---
Hahaha I don‚Äôt watch videos on here but I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at them talking shit then failing to team you properly. Yet you are the one sucked in there eyes??? Good game my guy funny clip
---
The great thing about iron man is that it kind of makes you play every aspect about the game, you'll find yourself doing things you want to do more than what you have to do.
---
I personally can't see why playing a F2P Ironman being fun outside of the questing - after killing elvarg what do you do? Any goal is going to be uninteresting as theres no reward to progressing your account much further. 
---
I personally love the system of progression  you have to go through as an ironman, you take every upgrade o e step at a time and it makes every aspect of the game feel rewarding.
---
The four mil comes from whoever wants to buy it. The gold is given to whoever has the BH points, and then they get the gmaul itemand lose it, giving 1 mil to whoever killed them. Unless people only buy alchables with the points, gold never leaves the game. And even if people do buy alchables in the BH store, that's only a potential incoming gold loss, I wouldn't consider that a sink
---
How hard is it to understand if ur spending 4m coins on something and it only drops 1m coins thats a gold sink?

Not only sneaking down to play video games but while riding in a car i imagined someone(or something) hoping from fence post to fence post and just recently found out a bunch of others did the same thing.

It's a lot of gp to pay for membership with your levels, but doing some farming is nice and passive and maybe something like Mort fungus to make up the difference, however I'd totally suggest getting a paper round or something which takes a few hours to complete and you can afford the whole month as gp for you is precious
---
You get xp though
---
i received 5 emails from jagex when someone stole my account a few days ago

that is what i do every time it seems legit

Ironman is really fun, even if you can't play a lot

With iron man it is more time committment. With a reg just do what you do and make friends the similar level to you

I understand that explaining the joke makes it not funny but honestly it wasn't the funniest joke in the world and I really do hate chompy hunting so here goes.

I'm implying that anyone who has done chompy hunting would never make you kill 300 of them. Thus, jagex doesn't play the game, thus why other, unrelated bugs don't get fixed.

Don't listen to this. 9o% of us love the edits. Keep it up!

That's the goal, only the strong survive.

Been playing osrs for 3 years and my wife honestly doesn‚Äôt even know what the game is called lol
---
&gt; The whole thing is open source 
---
It's not actually. The client is split in two parts: The private part which exposes an API by communicating with the game internals, and the public part which are the plugins which build upon the runelite API. It is not possible for developers outside the runelite core group to modify the API or directly interface with the game client.

Completionist cape on 35 combat account?
---
Even if that's the case sauron used a straight mace. Not a chain mace. Using a sword in conjunction with a chain mace would be nearly impossible. Chain maces are used as a blunted broad sweeping motion making it nearly impossible to use any other weapon.

Yeah you‚Äôre right but I did write that it won‚Äôt beat Zulrah or Vorkath in terms of GP/Hr except ‚Äúat high levels‚Äù. 
---
I do think slayer is a valuable skill that is worth training up. But for most newer players with low skills who are trying to make some money immediately for say gear or sustaining a bond, is slayer really the best thing to recommend to them?
---
Thanks :)
---
I don't expect to win, I've seen other entries which blow this out of the water, but I still wanted to share it.
---
I. Fucking. Wish.
---
Why don‚Äôt we change Magic to where if you hit a 0 you get 0 xp. That fixes the splashing problem easy, without this awkward restriction mechanic.
---
By shitty do you mean all?
---
Combat in RS is all the same apart from bosses. You just double click on prayers at a consistent rhythm until the task is done.
---
Link?
---
Depends what you determine as inefficient. The only tasks I specifically lose money on are Kalphite and Dagganoth because I cannon them since it's very fast xp. Even bursting tasks on nechs and dust devil's you make a profit with while getting insane magic xp and fast Slayer xp. Pretty much all other tasks are profitable with the exception of a few like Demons (assuming you're not doing demonic gorrilas). If I try to do very efficient slaying and skip some bad tasks I usually net around 70-90k xp/hour (this is just me some people probably get way more). Which makes it faster than a lot of skills comparatively.
---
I don't think I've trained any combat skills outside of Slayer though which is why I'm pretty biased towards it. I'll be hitting 99 mage, range, and mid 90s melee stats when I finish my 99 slay grind.
---
Check out the wiki for quests that give the biggest xp rewards and try to do some of those. The lower levels while it may be fun, can be skipped for even more fun by doing a few quests. If you like the combat more than Skilling try out slayer once you hit 30+ in all combat stats as training slayer will get you prayer (with bone crusher) and all combat stats. And higher slayer gets you decent money if you dont use highly expensive degradable or expensive runes/ammo. 
---
Also look up barrows gloves or dragon slayer 2 speed running guide for a decent and efficient quest order for a bunch of quests
---

Jagex already knows this, otherwise they wouldn't have decided to offer Twitch Prime membership when the BH emblem farm was active. Ever since the first Twitch Prime promo in 2017, accounts using the Twitch Prime membership have had a drastically increased ban rate compared to bots that obtain membership by normal means.
---
I've got a theory that Jagex intentionally releases Twitch Prime promos during times when there are lots of bots in order to get botters to invest lots of money into infrastructure. Afterward, they drastically increase ban rates, resulting in the botters sustaining massive losses, causing many of them to get discouraged and quit the game.

Oh, that sucks then. Who's she though?

Ancient mace doesn't really need a nerd. If you dont have 15-20+ well coordinated friends you're not gonna smite anyone. That shit has the stats of a mith scimitar and things can very easily go wrong. I think if you're risking an expensive plus one in multi it's something you always have to be very alert for

new players should focus on questing and untradeable milestones

My girlfriends brother must have spent a few hundred dollars on V-Bucks because his mom didn‚Äôt realize her card was saved to the client.
---
Keys as a drop is really dumb. Just let the loot drop on the floor so we don't have to waste time getting barraged on our way to a chest after a kill
---
this is absolutely correct, the only reason everyone likes slayer is because people tend to find it enjoyable and it feels like it's macroefficient, but if you want to make money slayer will NEVER beat something like camping vorkath, so if you find that more enjoyable than slayer it is most definitely better
---
I used to enjoy slayer too, it was all I did on rs3 (old rs2) before I quit, but the thing is, for awhile I was doing slayer to get good stats for bossing, but training combat almost exclusively through slayer took such a long time I didn't get much bossing in before the game died, so in this game I've just trained stats through the easy afk methods while otherwise occupied, then made money from bosses like zulrah/vorkath which also funded getting 99 magic &amp; range at mm2 caves, and now I'm having a blast with high level pvm content
---
93 slayer and achievement cape? Old pic.
---
Lmao
---
Kids are never too young to learn to hop

My case is actually vice versa: I enjoyed games when I was depressed, but nowadays when I have recovered from my depression I no longer play games. Well, I do play, but not even close as much as when I was depressed.
---
Wildly slayer and konar slayer can be.
---

---
Not sure how much of a timer you'd want, but would lead to more cases of freezing and booking it when losing.

Slayer isn‚Äôt recommended for the money for new players more so as a training method that will also help them make a lot in the future

yes, rc = runecraft

i dont play 2007 im saying your all queers because you all live in your mums basement and suck your dads cock and still play runescape which is what 5 years old in 2001 used to play.
---
The argument for it being the same for 15 years is irrelevant. Void was changed and many other things too. 10k is way too cost effective for what you get. The closest thing to it is Karils which is 2m. It baffles me that people can‚Äôt see the issue.
---
big yikes
---
You only have to get killed a few times by people telling you to kill yourself irl when you already avoid pvping whenever you can to lump the whole bunch of em together.

I made that comment pointing out how stupid the idea of fellow kids is when most of us aren't kids. 20 year olds and up aren't kids

It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up
---
When you're 98 hp and want untrimmed slayer
---
Tf you on about? You start making money when you unlock kurasks. And kree doesnt even have a lvl req to kill other than the GWD req.
---
You‚Äôre doing slayer wrong
---
They should make category about insane achievements like solo ToB or 50 combat inferno cape for example
---
Show me where the bad man touched you.
---
Problem is new players are more bothered about buying a piece of bandos or a sara sword than actually progress Thier accounts.
---
How? Tons of monsters shit out gold, Gargoyles, Kurasks, Nechs, Smoke/Dust Devils, Kraken.. and Hydra especially but that's 95
---
You're actually fucked in the head
---
Yall dont hire black peopleüò¢üò¨üòé
---
of the top of my head: get 63-70 hunter and hunt red chins
---
idk HOW good it is, because of bots
---
you definitely make more at higher levels and with the western hard diary done you get a private chin hunting area
---
although thats quite a ways away for you
---
Don't repot after every stat refresh and lost prayer point
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking why void is apparently harder to attain than a zulrah kill? The chompies were more disheartening than the PC
---
They typed in a legitimate URL and hyperlinked it to another one damn.
---
What if i cant stand wtf
---
Would love to, I'll add you after I get off work today. I used to love barb assault and now can barely find anyone to play with, I'm sure I'll be rusty but I can make calls!
---
91 lol what? Not only is this entire post incorrect with the existence of wildy slayer and konar, but normal Slayer definitely starts to make money at like 70. From here you have Kurasks and Dust devils, then you get Gargoyles at 75, Nechs at 80, Abyssal Demons at 85, and if you've unlocked Vorkath you can kill him for blue dragons tasks. If you only make money killing Kree, you must have blocked all the good tasks lol.
---
Bud, that's one hell of a way to twist my words. But sure let's go ahead and take some huge logical liberties. "Alching is just botting gp into the game, all you have to do is click twice. Imagine all of the gp that gets flooded in. Be a real pro gamer and sell your items to the general store. Don't use the GE, because that's just botting trades."
---
"Don't use teleports, those are just a way to bot travel"
---
Are you also against barraging and chins? Because I can hit 8 mobs at once, I may as well be manually killing one and botting the other 7, right?
---
It's a weak argument.
---
Gargs, kurasks, brutal black Dragons, dust Devils, kraken. Just a list of things around 70-77ish slayer
---
They should make it so you have to manually swing your axe each time you chop trees because it's basically botting right now with how you just click and wait, completely not engaging in gameplay.
---
so what ya gonna do with that dead content crush weapon?
---
Someone tell the FBI we found their next school shooter.
---
Yeah I use spellbook swap for those
---
I agree. Some if the higher level trees give too many logs until they fall.
---
Crush my skull

Funny, well-made, and looks amazing. You're too good for this sub
---
Are you dumb? He says blizzard instead of jagex lmao this is clearly satire
---
When it rains it pours. Couple weeks ago I got supreme pet on 27 kc on a dag task, next day I got kraken pet in 218 kc
---
The only quest i can hard recommend is "knights sword" this doesn't impact progress by much but gets rid of a really difficult and annoying start that smithing would otherwise give you. 
---
Otherwise for the melee skills sounds like you have a good plan, you might want to consider killing goblins or some other mobs instead since they have other and more usefull drops, however that's just extra things you can do. For quests i'd recommend just looking at what quests are in your area or which quests you know of that look fun. good luck!!
---
Sorry, what kind of rubies?
---
That's a fair point, I can respect that. You're completely correct about rebalancing minigames. Reworking lms is a good start, since for the past year it's been the deadest of dead minigames. Being a white knight master rank should let you buy red or blue trimmed Proselyte. 
---
Games room should give you reward points- maybe to buy the ability to put the games in your house or new cosmetics (hard to balance, since 2p games are terrifically easy to boost).
---
Gnome restaurant is kind of fine as-is since you can skip tasks to go for the scarf or goggles.
---
Trouble Brewing should just be completely overhauled. I've literally never, ever seen anyone using a cosmetic from it. I'd be genuinely shocked to see someone with the 6k point flag.
---
Most of the groundwork is there, but so many minigames need tweaking.
---
More please
---
Same story here brother. I‚Äôll be like ‚Äújust click this green one that says prayer pot in a couple min while I take a shit‚Äù and she says ‚Äúprayer pot? l hahaha fuck you‚Äù

Was that some lizzy McGuire in there?

I'm guessing their comment was satirizing the original post. At least I'm hoping it was.
---
This is some the highest effort content I have seen on this subreddit
---
with slayer you typically need to put in at least a bit of effort to train, so at least to me, it requires enough concentration that I can't really play another game or do it while doing another task, but also isn't engaging enough to be that fun on its own like bossing/raids/inferno
---
so yes I do find it a lot less boring to train combat afk at sand crabs on mobile while I'm out playing Mtg or in class or something, obviously sitting there exclusively focused on your character and watching the hitsplats on sandcrabs will get boring, but I even find it more fun when I'm at my computer to afk train while playing another game like hearthstone or league of legends compared to trying to focus on slayer
---
What is this post even referencing?
---
I found this when the update hit because I'm always poking around looking at minor details. I was so excited lol. I wonder if they have any plans for it.
---
This was amazing! Loved every single moment of this. Hope to see more

I've got the year, but as for the month which it asks for I have literally no recollection of whether it was beginning or end of the year, as the weather is pretty much the same here whenever it isn't winter and that's really all I remember about it. It was more of a 'we all made accounts and played for a week then it died out' kind of situation, so unfortunately I don't have the most vivid memory of it.
---
You can counter it with locator orb I believe. When I was doing skulled revs w/ risk I'd bring one to drop my hp faster than they could drop my prayer.

1 npc at a time fits the other ones pretty well too
---
Dude make the full version its good
---
this exposes a fundamental issue with this game where all the somewhat decent money making methods(200k++/phr) are locked behind most tier 6 skills.
---
Previously, a new player with 30 mining can make upwards of 150k\~ phr and this enabled them to stay in the game longer
---
Maybe they are hardcore into darksouls and would like that type of "learn to swim or die" gameplay. You never know.

Wow, so beautiful...It's like I am playing the game and then ...

Why does your character look like hyponix

They just removed it but you used to need the cwars gear for trim.

Before that was 5k games for trim. I did that while playing osrs at release and then quit RS3 promptly afterwards.

Amen ‚Äúclue scroller‚Äù btw
---
Quest cape rip was too real.
---
Usually when people say "best" in terms to osrs they're usually speaking in effciency terms 
---
Meaning Slayer is one of the most efficient money makers, not purely gp profit.
---
But it trains your combat stats and sends you around the game, prompting you to also do a few quests.
---
Pvm is by far the best and most fun way to make money, it also requires high combat stats which you will gain through slayer.
---
Yeah youre right it takes a commitment to get there but in the long run its the best and most fun way to make some coin.
---
I love it! It was missing one thing however. Those DAMN invisible lines to cross to get hit by the DAYUM crossbows.

LMS has been the most fun i've had in a while from a minigame!

I'm saying it's universally accessible

For a pker, is 17m risk a budget setup? Full ahrim's, staff of the dead, infinity boots, occult is still less mage offense than the dinh's with dhide player has defense.
---
I have not ever died with dihn's in singles, nor do I realistically expect to. It's broken tbh. Sure, some people are for it, but that's just because they like how busted it is, because they like being able to guarantee survival in a pvp zone.

Is there a list of quest items that are normally thrown out? Things such as the blessed mith axe and lunar isle vial for example. The old man still leaves some stuff in your bank that may have uses but are probably not useful.

Dharoks at NMZ is now an option, depending on your HP. You really want 80-85+ HP for the set bonus. It's the easiest training method, and you'll get points for daily herb boxes.

I think revenants negatively impacted the game quite a bit. GP value wise and economy wise. most people doing revs are goldfarmers and the money per hour is insane compared to the green dragons those goldfarmers used to know. how much better, you ask? lets just say an hour of revs can net  a goldfarmer 4-5 X more money than the greens they've been doing for years. gold has become very cheap compared to what it used to be in the last 12 months. most normal players don't even bother with revs for too long because of the constant pkers and 1750-2.2k worlds are all locked down by groups and clans which literally rag you until you leave. with that said 90% of rev killers are goldfarmers and revs is just too good for the no requirement money maker it is. imo removing it completely as it is would long term benefit the game. I know this doesn't completely solve the issue, but trust me, it helps

None of these are true for me.

You realize there are now teleports to pretty much every single area of the game and graceful + stam pots exist right?

The j mods are a joke. This game won't be around for another decade

The wiki says that in order to get all fossil displays in the museum, you need 70 small, 60 medium, and 50 large fossils. Is this what I would need if I got every piece perfectly, or is there an RNG element that involves having to get the right pieces from cleaning, meaning that I would need more than this amount?
---
Rather than guide, just unlock certain agility shortcuts. Removing traveling time etc will in the longrun just be bad for the game imo.
---
-
---
It's kinda like how you alredy have teleports for fricking everything, or how every boss is instanced and has over the top loot drop table...

Shapiro style? So blocking them on twitter and interrupting them?
---
&gt;You're reading me wrong. I said a new player would NOT go P2P by buying a bond. It isn't like Jagex advertise the fact that you can upgrade to member by buying a bond straight from the GE. Unless you're really broke IRL, barely anyone will go for a bond the first time into P2P, and none will sustain in P2P with a bond if they struggle to make money.
---
I dont think a new player would pay irl money if they didnt get into the game yet. And there are a lot of ppl who don't want to pay either even when they could. 
---
So we are talking of a new player that needs money "for whatever reason". Either for a bond, for gear, to skill, whatever. 
---
&gt;You have little to no knowledge about slayer if you think the money starts to come at 70+ slayer. 
---
Thats exactly op's point. People want to romanticize slayer at any lvl and tbh it doesn't work like that. Yes you can do cave horrors for 900k in a drop with a rate 1/+500 so how many hours will they have to be there to get that drop??  Thats considered shit money if you want to get money asap. Say whatever you want but gp/h is not that good with slayer early on. Some tasks are great, but others are not. So ppl could take the time to explain to ppl and not simply say "slayer" after someone asks for a money making method.
---
Just get 75 range and blowpipe and you can essentially afk the caves.
---
Get your mage level up to unlock teleports, train your agility to run longer, use energy or stamina potions to restore run
---

This wording made me happy. 
---
Also good advice. However I will never get rid of my corpse of woman!
---
Don't know how you don't see the difference between manually clicking each window and using a program to swap through windows clicking in the exact same spot. Of course one could get you flagged and the others can't? It had nothing to do with him using alts to solo the boss lmao.
---
I'm talking about the people that have like dozens of hours to get to Duradel
---
Thanks man! Is your reddit name your RuneScape name also?
---
I don't believe so, just gotta hope they respond to your recovery request quick enough.
---
To have fun. :)
---
What‚Äôs happening here
---
You would not believe how exciting it was to see the first 5 seconds, then to notice it was 4 more minutes of this. Im blown away man.
---
Blood barrage is super useful for solo arma. What I usually do is kill the melee minion with blowpipe if it's still alive, blowpipe the mage minion and spec to heal if needed, and then blood barrage the range minion to heal up.
---
What if I password fail too many times?
---
Eh, Underground pass isn‚Äôt so bad as you can just run-glitch past all the traps and if you have 50-60 agil already and boost you usually won‚Äôt fail the obstacles. Doing it all again kinda sucks though.
---
Everything past that is just kinda annoying.
---
I tell players "stop thinking about money, focus on quests and having fun"
---
There is no *good* way to make money at low levels without taking advantage of weird game mechanics that a genuinely new player would not engage with (I'm thinking puro puro, etc).  We need to show new players that gp is not how they should measure their own worth, and that success takes time.
---
Try a style pf pking that isn‚Äôt completely brain dead lmao
---
Follow up to my video yesterday where I just showed the highlights/loot, dont really expect anyone to watch all of this but figured people might still enjoy it
---
It's in the blog posts.
---
Do you double bgs spec vorkath or just use one? right now im double speccing but i only get 1 kill a trip since i dont have any spec when hes dead
---
Good luck!
---
&gt; Skills like agility, runecrafting, etc become muscle memory after a while.
---
Not to mention crafting blood runes. More afk than slayer, imo. Yeah, getting 77 RC can be a bitch, but once you're there you can coast to 99.
---
What about kebos and farming Guild lol
---
That shit looks way to hard. I want a LMS easy mode lol
---
Noiceee
---
Because RuneScape takes place in the middle ages, there was no such thing as gender equality.
---
Put it in a bathtub and bathe in it to increase it's power.
---
That's true but beside those 2 things there has been nothing

---
Btw /r/woosh
---
No, you said ‚Äú2007 scape‚Äù
---
I'm 86 slayer and I feel like i still don't make great money. The cannon tasks and the money tasks even out and the money tasks aren't that great. I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
---
Hunter is definitely in the 'less fun' category for me.
---
How do I find a world In which people are actually playing LMS?
---
Twitch engagement is not a good factor as to whether or not a game is successful.    
---
Games can still be fun and super-popular, even if they are not fun to watch, because they are fun to play instead.    
---
Communities like Reddit are a better estimator on community health, because it's an open forum for all, rather than an entertainment show (twitch streams).
---
PvP using all three combat styles. You bring switches for everything and swap gear and prayers to counter your opponent's prayer and gear. Basically just abusing the combat triangle as hard as possible to force damage through.
---
Nah if you only want to pk make a pure, it‚Äôll take significantly longer to train a main up to the point where it can PK, especially with all the questing and skilling requirements for some items. If you do wanna just make a main to pk on always have high range strength and mage for max hits, and keep attack and defence limited to what gear you want at that time.
---
Should I be doing duradle or nieve
---
Not if you use serp, salve and stay above 116 str/atk
---
Yeah sorry that wasn‚Äôt a woosh you were reaching in the first place by making a really dumb comparison. Sorry you can‚Äôt have a corgi snowflake go back to playing Animal Crossing
---
Start some farming dude
---
Kinda feel like you just came back to the game and found out about the collection log
---
You wouldn't be forced to use the guide if it was added if you enjoy the effort for it's own sake.
---
Everyone goes through periods of low motivation. It's not a bad thing to take a break and come back with a fresh perspective. I know things can feel like a chore sometimes, just gotta find something that brings you joy. It'll come back to you eventually.
---
Lol so mad, make a concise argument
---
But if you do have 15-20 well coordinated friends you're guaranteed to get anyone's +1 and there's nothing they can do about it. Being in the wilderness you will always risk running into that well coordinated group and unless you want to risk 100m+ you'll never take an expensive +1 which is bullshit.
---
This is basically rule 1 on runescape
---
Use game capture in OBS as opposed to window capture. Hide your Bank Pin

---
Probably wasted all of their resources on warding and partnerships only to be shot down
---
Or could they be so nitpicky that since ctrl+tab combo was shortened to just Z, that they think its effectively lessening keystrokes? *shrug* is all i say.
---
I mean they always have 1 BIG update a year and the rest are smaller ones compared to it. I'd rather have a bunch of smaller updates and fixes to old content than have them work on 1 or 2 big things the entire year and have nothing else tbh. New elf city is coming in a few weeks so you got that to look forward to.

There isn't really a way to fix this issue atm though. The game is flooded with d'hide. Unless they increase the alch price it'll remain cheap as fuck.

We get sexually aroused denying them nice things in the exact same way they get sexually arpused killing some rando for a spade, also they are to blame for making the new alter dead content for everyone else rn(after the novelty wears off)

If I stick a Lego in your shoe,  it doesn't make walking more challenging or rewarding,  it just is a painful annoyance.  Im all for rewarding challenge,  I'm not for headache.
---
No need for unpleasantries my guy.
---
no i didn't. the bulwark could have just been made rarer to compensate for how strong it was instead of them nerfing it. i compare it to dclaws where it is a very strong 'wildy limited' item which is balanced because it is so expensive
---
Same thing happened for me. It's a great honor to pass the gauntlet. I just make sure he's always on my normal account üòÖ

---
\&gt; Emblem prices are low, because there are hundreds of emblem farming bots online everyday. 
---
That's not how it works - emblem farmers actually drove up the price of emblems because the T1 emblem drop rate is extremely low. Each bot banned also removes several emblems from the game, so given the Sir Pugger farm was getting wiped out on a daily basis, that led to thousands of emblems getting removed from the game each day. 
---
However, that farm has been gone since early June, which was also when the BH and Wilderness Slayer changes were implemented. It's a simple issue of no more demand from BH farmers combined with increased supply from Slayer.
---
gonna be using this strat from now on
---
I don't know anything about your PvP skills, but 1013 is one of the best brids in the game. Wasn't amazed by your opponents' skills, so I personally doubt that's him.

That being said, whoever those two cunts are deserve a phatty ban.

Yeah I agree not everything needs to be with 1 screen of a teleport

You go to the beta test worlds that are literally designed for LMS

Yes they can advertise.

---
To be honest I just NMZ prodded my way directly to duradel while at work, while doing non-slayer stuff while at home.
---
why 84? mostly everyone only gets it to 83 and boost from there.

It's a cursive z too isn't it?

Oh dear... is this even possible?  I feel bad for you.
---
I think you want to hit 64 total damage with BGS specs for efficient BP kills
---
so a bunch of people with the default look all conveniently decide to train their skills to look very similar before dropping the entire game and focusing 100% on runecrafting, nearly the point to where they have more XP in runecrafting than all other skills combined?
---
yeah, maybe they just enjoy it
---
U need alot of range levels currently to be balanced. Id aim for that at least and get 85 range. Only the HP levels will level you, but long term id aim for 80 strength 90+ range
---
It's actually faster to just Turael skip tasks than to boost for points. You end up with more (x desired task) per 10 hours with Turael skipping than you do with wildy points or turael + konar streaks.
---
However it's not macro efficient since you get way less gold/xp/pet chances that you'd otherwise get doing wildy slayer. But still if you're an Ironman farming Hydra or you're a main farming specific slayer bosses, it's worth it to just keep skipping.
---
I thought you just buy them after Recipe quest
---
This has been the release schedule for a long time now. Big update in january, which was kebos this year btw. And another big update in the summer, SoTE this year.
---
Then of course there is all the other stuff that gets released in between, the game updates every week so i can't even remember everything. But recently there has been the hosidius rework and forthos dungeon.
---
But imagine a "lego in shoe marathon" unlocked a special stupid cape, or access to a cool ingrediant to make your omellettes taste amazing.
---
This is a bizarre example but bear with me.
---
*Yes*, if your goal is "i want the tasty omellettes", that lego marathon is *awful*. It's a hell on earth- almost enough to make you not bother with the omellette ingredient. In fact- that's exactly what most people do. Not bother. They skip it and opt for a different goal- a special ingredient that makes their sandwiches taste amazing and all it involves is sitting in a particular chair for long enough. Easy.
---
But fuck it- you decide you want that omellette ingredient, so you dedicate a day and endure the pain. Knock it out of the way. Done.
---
You could've just not done it. You could've done what everyone else did. Why did you choose to do it? Did it matter that you chose to do it? Were you forced to?
---
Idk- player agency has fundamentally been at the very very core of games *like* runescape. Runescape **isn't actually fun** as an active experience. It's really boring. So why do people play it? You're just clicking on things every once in a while- it is super boring.
---
Don't you think it has something to do with how satisfying it is to *unlock* things, *complete* things, achieving goals you set out to do? Where you choose to expend your effort?
---
I literally would wake up around 4am to get some fishing in before having to get ready for school at 7ish. This went on till I was a sophomore in high school
---
Its silly to give rarity to something that is strong but barely used. 
---
bulwark isn't limited to wildy in its uses as the dclaws are, which were balanced accordingly. 
---
Jagex didn't have the foresight to see brainlets complaining about not being able to kill a shield meant for tanking when they only where salad robes. 
---
lets give a hypothetical : The same logic applies both ways, as a pvmer I think dclaws are op and want them nerfed, why should dclaws only be a pkers weapon? surely you can use dclaws elsewhere in the game but there are better options majority of the time. 
---
Imagine if pvmers complained enough that dclaws werent strong enough to damage corp, and jagex caves into the demand and now dclaws are BIS corp spec weapon. 
---
It isn't logical to nerf the bulwark because of some pkers not being able to get the kill in the same way I can't get a corp kill with d claws. If a pvmer wants to kill corp jagex says "use a spear" and guess what? thats how it is. 
---
this bulwark shit is just nonsense, pkers are crying as usual and jagex has a knee jerk reaction as usual and the community responses as usual. 
---
If pkers truly want to kill shield users than they need to get good.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for anyone else but I try to keep my goals small and realistically attainable. 
---
For example, rather than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get Barrows gloves‚Äù something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna knock out two of the RFD subquests.‚Äù  
---
Then work from there. Otherwise I get option paralysis / burnout like you‚Äôre talking about here.

I do ranarrs and Konar keys are very underwhelming to me.
---
I would highly recommend heading to the wiki and checking out the Mechanics section. There are designated times when crops grow, called a farming tick. If you plant close to a tick, say at 12:25 when the growth tick is at 12:30, even if your crop would normally take longer than that to grow, once the tick happens you get a growth cycle. There are certain advantageous times to plant based on what you want to grow.
---
No one knows except the JMods. People guess from stats that it's about 10-15% though.
---
No I just don't deal with ignorant assholes like yourself

The Vyerwatch  Lords (specifically Lord Drakan) would be more accurate, the Myreque are like the rebellious humans trying to dethrown the Sith. since the Mineral is there for them to mine, it's probably more aware of a lot that goes on with the Vyrewatch.
---
I have a max house and it's nice and all but not needed at all if you use the house party world.
---
Yep I‚Äôve killed it every task possible. 50k away from 99 slayer lol
---
Iirc, it means people can't stack damage and delay it until your prayer runs out
---
Or it should at least let you chug some pots in between specs
---
That was amazing, I wonder just how frustrating song of the elves is going to be. Well still worth it to keep the quest Cape i suppose
---
F
---
a better analogy would be a pvm item which is overpowered but also not that rare. so it means you dont need money nor skill to pvm because you had it. that was the equivalent with dinhs in pvp. and no it was not 'rarely used' literally anyone who went to deep wild with a big risk would be insane not to bring it in case they ran into a team
---
That would make it the best weapon in the bracket by far, making the whip useless
---
Probably will end up staying 50 attack and rushing with the new upgrade for the short term.
---
Then will transition into 60 attack since 50 attack build is basically dead to the average player. Large bank or spec and tele and playing it safe is the only viable way to remain 50 attack.
---

The person could just tell their friend(s) their new name, their location, or what they‚Äôre wearing. I wish there was a way to prevent teaming but Dmm has shown there‚Äôs currently no way to stop it
---
I have that and 3k, kills before log
---
People still dislike it though. I post on the Q&amp;A threads a lot and I see a lot of questions about metal dragons because even though it's really AFK, a lot of people just don't like the feeling that it takes them so long to do the task.
---
Google "mining levelling guide OSRS".
---
I think slayer is one of the most boring things ever too and hate how Jagex has decided it deserves 100 times more updates than any other skill in the game
---
Considering that the winning video will be published on official Old School channels, that would mean legal trouble.
---
Lol. Alt f4 closes the program. Alt tab rotates through. But yes. Every click and press is manual. There's no automation or outside software.

---
Bursting/barraging slayer is the most efficient way and if you find slayer fun I'd go with that. Personally I just splash, slow but I don't really have to do anything and I'm at 94 or 99 in a few weeks.
---
I just wanted to prepare for every possible situation, like if I used up too much charge to not be able to re-equip blowpipe when swapping out for dragon darts
---
I actually really enjoyed this system, not sure why there's a lot of hate against it. People litteraly share items all the time, and my clan is really close and we do it but just had an incident where someone borrowed a tbow and just left the clan..... Would've saved my clan a big headache
---
By Release is ten times more entertaining than Swampletics
---
That was litterally my guess

It's hard, just study more before you go in. Practically the only thing you have to do is stand on the right tile and flick Jad Phase on the opposite style it's attacking with.

I always suggest skilling with intermittent slayer training.
---
I always make sure to tell people that slayer is only really profitable at 72+ and to focus more on things that will help long term, like questing or agility.
---
Farming is one of the easiest skills to train
---
Is jagex ever going to address that their items kept on death tab is 100% inaccurate and misleading? Can this please be looked into and fixed?

---
Of course, there is practice for perfection, but that is not really relevant for a first kill.

I don't think it would fit as a log in screen, but I that's not a negative thing. You still created something beautiful!

Slayer is a good way to train combat as well, I don't see the problem
---
Well, then you should know you can‚Äôt take armor, weapons, or capes. The monks even tell you this. 
---
And if you‚Äôre going there a lot, which it seems like you are, then knowing what you can and can‚Äôt bring should be memorized.
---
Idk you seem pretty mad
---
No, expectation that wilderness should be safe area, sadly with bulwark's existence it's reality
---
Agility, sure. But the rest? No. You can earn money, and items with the rest.
---
Took me literally 70 deaths. I started by only doing the melee phase and learning that. Learn 1 phase then learn the rest slowly
---
Swampletics mostly had fun because his account van very limited and his progress was really rewarding. I can recommend making any ironman and getting the same rewarding feeling.

My mom played RS in the 2000‚Äôs when my brother and I introduced her to the game. The only thing she didn‚Äôt do were the quests because she didn‚Äôt know how to read English. I did all the quests in her account, and got further ahead in her acc than my mine because gotta do what mom says, duh. The Underground Pass was the most tedious thing in RS questing, and my mom would come check in on me every once in a while, see the gameplay, and tell me ‚Äúidk why you like questing it‚Äôs so irritating‚Äù. When all was said and done, my mom just hogged the computer from then on because her favorite mythological creatures are elves. Assed my self out of game time lmao.

Yeah I was definitely one of the early whip pures to do it back then, I was 87 cmb IIRC and it was my 4th try.  Shortly after that there were level 60s with it and within a year there were level 40s with it.  I honestly just got back into OSRS yesterday so I‚Äôm curious to know how low they‚Äôre doing it now.
---
Well that's great, but if they are gonna ban him for something not explicitly against the rules they should make an official statement on it so that others don't banned for doing similar things that aren't against the rules
---
Reported a couple of times over the weeks by the way.. still there, camping with his strenght cape, and his full guthan.
---
If it gets bad enough Jagex would probably start banning for it under "disruptive behavior". Sort of like how using an alt to sabotage Castle wars games became a bannable offence after enough people started doing it years ago.
---
Thanks! I guess I'll have to merch my way up again haha
---
Doesn't mobile have 60 fps...?
---
i want to try pvp (should i at my levels?) but at the same time i love pvm and this is my only account so i think the 75 atk build would be better for this too? and i limit strength to 77 as from 78 my account would become melee oriented and gain much more combat levels
---
Be careful the guy clearly loves puppies he must be some sort of psychopath

It's currently possible to spawn multiple of the same barrows brother in the tunnels. I know the chance of an item depends on the number of brothers killed, wondering if killing 7 brothers would increase the chance of an item and if this would be considered bug abuse if that's the case.

Click on the wrench &gt; advanced options &gt; side-panels
---
Your mage level is really low for zulrah, and void range/mage are extremely inaccurate until higher level stats. I‚Äôm only 83 range and 86 mage and if I use void range it adds a minute to my kills. 
---
However, it sounds like you just need one kill for the diary? If that‚Äôs the case you should be able to do it with your gear if you just keep practicing. It took me probably 20 deaths until my first kill. Then it took me another 60 kc to get to the point where I very rarely will still die. 
---
If you can, i would wear ahrims hood, top and bottom and use a toxic trident, occult and MA2 cape. Bring a bp with an Ava‚Äôs, blessed top and blessed bottom switch. Pre-pot with a range and mage potion and eat an angler at the bank so that you can bring more food since you‚Äôre running out. Bring around 4 karambwans and the rest sharks or better. Don‚Äôt forget 1-2 ppots and your anti-venom+ as well as a backup recoil

He was banned because clicking in the same spot on every account triggered bot detection, they are pretty up in the air about what they consider allowed and not allowed with ahk. It's supposed to be 1:1, you can use crazy scripts for years in pvp or fletch darts etc and never get banned but since they never unbanned him they probably consider what he was doing against the rules. Don't use AHK if you don't want a chance to be banned, they've always said that.
---
I'd say a mute for for inappropriate statements, absolutely not on board with hopping on the garbage that is making rules about 'stream sniping' though. That never works out well for communities that start doing it.

Q
---
Honestly the meta for pvp is range in void at your combat bracket
---
It‚Äôs stupid easy. Do Mm2 keep your defence at 45. Use balista knives and axes and contribute to the cancer.
---
75 attack zerkers aren‚Äôt meta right now and tbh they seem a bit underpowered for their lvl compared to 60 attack piety pures. 
---
My objective suggestion is to stay at a combat level with 60 attack where your ranged based so around 88 strength with 99 range and then just use void range into maul/claws/dds with the melee helm. It‚Äôs OP
---
This one hits close to home..
---
Naked. You go naked.
---
Can't wait to max so I can start playing the game
---
No, and I get it, that's my fault. But my question is how they got in. Like I've said, I've never done any sketchy shit with runescape
---
Watch out we‚Äôve got a pro in here
---
I have this unlocked.  
---
Am I right in thinking I withdraw 25 X Dragonhide , use Tan Leather 5 times , deposit then repeat?  
---
Which hide is usually best to use?
---

Nah. You'll die if you misclick badly, but you shouldn't lose more than 500k-1m MAX for the whole thing, even if you're complete ass at them

I feel like minigames are supposed to be that other 1% though.

Yup. Strength is almost always more important than accuracy.

Would love to have the share feature again. That way I could rent someone‚Äôs infernal axe for this clue

i actually havent seen his vids, ill have to check em out, i love me some elder scrolls content.
---
I thought you couldn't determine things through plain text, how can you tell if I'm acting high and mighty? I think we just figured out who the .... Dumb one is.
---
You have a virus or you shared your account and didn't change the pin. Period.
---
The only way they could get in your bank is one of two ways:
---
- A malicious Remote Acess Tool hidden in nearly any file, with which they watched you physically enter your pin on screen
---
- You gave your pin to someone and never changed it, and they came back to clean you out.
---
Honestly the signs make this entire thing work
---
Hope they choose this one
---
This was amazing, great work! Reminds me of happy tree friends, such a throwback.
---
Lmao fr tho reminds me of being in middle school drawing maps of lumby and varrock and shit. I never knew you could download the world map so I got tired of waiting for it to load on shitty dsl hahah
---
It is actually against the rules. Read the post from 2017 on it. Honestly I was surprised to find that out myself
---
The "single frame" high detail face after slapping the king is very hellbenders

Never shared my account as stated multiple times. I'm looking into the possibility of a virus now.

I attempted Jad last week and a buddy of mine sat with me though it, he said 600 Addy darts would be enough.
---
I believed him until I ran out of darts on wave 60.

Iunno about that "explicitly allowed" part.
---
Oh yeah, when I was a noob I had this buying coal cheap selling it back for more thing going... I didn't have a lot of knowledge about things and the game felt incredibly slow... mining in the dwarven Mines was annoying with everyone competing for iron or coal, but everyone was a real live person back then so I could chat with people. 
---
Then later I spent my time chopping Yews in Edgville with the same crew everyday, it was wholesome, I miss the old old school days.
---
It's still horribly slow and tedious lmao. Get brain.
---
nice
---
Fuck off get a screenie
---
Don't make a fool of yourself. There are more rewarding creatures to camp to get money from as an alt, which doesn't need you to get 85 slayer. Moreover, nobody is stupid enough to camp abbysal demon with full guthan on all the time.
---
Yes
---
(1/1024)^2
---
Or maybe (1/1024)^2 * 1/200 if the odds of getting any number of zulrah scales is equal.
---
Not sure if you see but this person is splashing on something other than rats or seagulls. Seen people splash on goblins and Varrock guards too. One can even occasionally find them splashing on ogress warriors.
---
Its actually pretty convenient. I have ghorrock tele in my poh. Ill tank through the idiots attacks and use a full inv of bones on the altar while brewwing, then let them finish me off for a free tele. The tards dont realize theyre just giving me an expensive tele.that increases my xp rates.
---
Smoke a fat bowl and pray to the rng gods
---
Yeah that works, but it works on my other account of resizable mode. No biggie though, thanks man!
---
I have 80 ranged, 86 hp and 83 defence. Anyone with a blowpipe (75 ranged) is definitely capable of beating this. The most important part of the fight is in watching Jad's legs - if he stands pray mage but if he slams pray ranged.

You may be a woman outside, but when you play Runescape, you become a 12 year old boy.

I have 2fa set up on my RuneScape account with the Google authenticator app, is that good enough?
---
I had this idea for a minigame. You give all your planks to a dude outside, you go in it's a instanced house that's in a very snowy area that continuously recieves damage from the weather, you go for like 3 minutes repairing stuff then do it  all again. The house is different everytime and you can bring leathers and such in with you for bonus crafting experience. 
---
Yeah its actually nuts that still after all this time something with training construction hasn't changed

Easier access to the elf lands is literally the reward of regicide.

This is literally just people upset about having to work for their rewards.
---
Im sorry you were downvoted.  I thought it was funny
---
Right he‚Äôs literally using ahk which Jagex has said is nearly always bannable (unless it‚Äôs doing something you can do with windows mouse keys anyways). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great rule but it is a rule nevertheless
---
I recently got back into the game, and I don't see many low levels with it, but I see tons of players in general with it. Back in the day it was actually rare, nowadays I see them all over the place. I would almost say I see them as often as I see obby capes.
---
And driving as well?
---
Go back to splashing rats in Lumbridge for no xp goblin boy hahaha Wow!
---
Make sure it's on your email too!
---
They won't poll it till their confident it'll pass or at least get close.
---
Yeah but then look you run into the same grind problem when the optimal strategy for the improved pest control is developed and then it becomes a grind again. The grind is just a part of the game man
---
Only when you've at least killed it once already
---
He missed the potato eat.
---
Because "chainmaceman" doesn't flow as nicely
---
Worth the risk of bringing a 6m item into the wildy
---
Nice.
---
Most, if not all Cats bury their shit though and it fertilisers the soil, so...
---
I mean with my 8 mil bank money can be tight I'm a noob i know :,(
---
Oh I know, he‚Äôs engaging a monster that is highly sought after in f2p probably annoying players who wanna kill it for bones and a chance at obor
---
Just as an FYI most people bring splash runes  to places like wyverns (the ogresses of f2p) do keep their monster while they go and do something for 10-15 minutes so someone doesn‚Äôt take their spot 
---
He probably would have splashed rats if jagex didn‚Äôt remove it from lumbridge. 
---
My point still stands if you wanna get 15k exp an hour splashing by all means go for it.
---
You deserve gold
---
I recommend running malwarebytes custom scan, and scanning everything available. Make sure on this page you check "Scan for rootkits" as many RATs are equipped with them.
---
You obviously don't know about reading either,  but I'll let you go through that blog post one more time before you delete your comment ;)
---
Well since it is $11 per month did you really think $25 was going to get you 3 months?
---
As other guy said, you save loads of hours maxing at NMZ and then getting 99 slayer
---
But ragging is completely different. Pking is throwing out all this damage for a kill while ragging is just preventing a player from fighting someone else with no intention to kill. 10/10 false equivalency
---
Right on, congrats dude! Killing Jad is on my OSRS bucket list of shit I always wanted to do as a kid, but couldn't. Well done.
---
ü¶Ä11ü¶Ä
---
I actually wouldnt want to see more of those, we are already have enough daily activites as it is. I really wouldnt want things to become dailyscape. 
---
I am just a person who wants to see the skilling methods differentiate a bit more though so I am probably a minority
---
Thank you, I'll do that!
---
Ooh that's a good call, do you know how much damage it does?
---
your gear and stats are pretty good for Jad, just be smart. know how to safe spot waves and dont panic at Jad! GL, you got this!
---
What country?
---
I used only blowpipe and focused on the prayers/positioning
---
That is a very rude response. I will also remind you of the rules on this subreddit. This is not a place to accuse players of wrongdoing. Contact Jagex for serious issues. 
---
It's easy to camp abyssal demons in full guthans. It may not be the fastest method but it allows someone to focus on their main while not worrying about death. 
---
Abyssal demons were a big goal as a kid and so I think they are rewarding. If you meant more rewarding financially, then why is this person camping abyssal demons and not that more rewarding thing? Maybe because it's an easy alt? 
---
From a purely logical point of view, why bother botting if all you need to do is click once in a while? Again, from a logical point of view, why bother with 85 slayer if there are better options? What does that have to do with anything? 
---
My account will be built similarly to this and I don't want people accusing me without any proof. I especially don't want them accusing me because I won't be botting.
---
In there with the Minnesota slurs...

'who trades fun for a boring grind'
---
I know different people have different opinions, but I wholeheartedly believe that there is nothing fun about RS - the whole thing is a boring grind. People grind for various reasons, but it's mostly either to waste time or to feel accomplished.
---
Doesn't matter what your poison is - you'll take a look at yourself 5 years down the line and think 'wtf was I doing'. We'll enjoy it whilst it lasts though
---
ü¶ÄJagex only cares about moneyü¶Ä
---
Well I mean you can think what you think. But its a pretty narrowminded opinion. There is literally no reason why it would be.
---
Be sure to not lamp and drive.
---
Do 1 skeleton, 1 rat, 2 works for 88% :)
---
So you want to game to be just checking different patches every 50 minutes for every skill without actually having to train the skills?
---
Herblore and cheap are not two words that go together.

Id say hes the passenger son...

Good luck.

Or even just make everyone the same name lol idk. Fortnite does streamer mode pretty well

Currently going for 70 for SOTE (64 rn) and if you have some cash you can buy make ppots with an amulet of chemistry and hardly lose any money. I haven‚Äôt tried it with super restores but I plan to do that until 70. Without the amulets of chemistry it would cost millions though
---
The bad part about this is you can‚Äôt sit and do it all in one go, you have to constantly buy and sell supplies unless you have a fat cash stack
---
You can not train herblore, and save an infinite unparalleled amount of money.
---
Play the game and have fun. Dont burn yourself out, luckily you got a shit ton of fun content ahead of you before the real grind starts, soo make the most of it bud!
---
Doesn‚Äôt exactly take a rocket scientist to fake this either, so again, it was a valid question
---
This. We have to come to the acceptance that this was a last ditch effort to save the game, given these legal issues they been having due to this. I mean, if they didn't do it, the game would actually be dead.
---
why is this not top of the world
---
What's your reasoning for it being the best? Because little broke boy shitters like you can see what it's like to use ice barrage? Neat.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Go for quest cape. Then diaries. One of the best ways to progress. You will work your way to most of the content doing that and then the world is your oyster

The darts script is just remapped mousekeys, so that one shouldn't get you in trouble. The weird thing to me is that he just remapped a bunch of built-in Windows functions and still got banned, which makes zero sense to me
---
Brute forced your login perhaps? If someone knew your email, it's literally only a matter of time before a brute force would prevail.
---
He‚Äôs not using it to interact with any of the clients though; he‚Äôs using it to more easily alt tab. You‚Äôre not allowed to do multiple inputs with a single key, which he isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs using a single key to make zero inputs.
---
Dood I feel that, I started rock climbing thanks to my buddies recommendation and now being physically stagnant is a little irritating now

At what range level? Isn't 2 out of 3 of Zulrah colours pretty much immune to Range?

---
Pvm or boss pet hunting is what is fun for me, some people enjoy skilling, others deal with it to get the benefits

Taking your own path is what makes it fun, nothing is mandatory but obviously benefits come from certain skills quests etc

This a tip how to break up with my girlfriend? My wife would probably appreciate it.

i don't know why more people don't complain about this quest. it's very one small favouresque

Well damn. Mind sharing your endless wisdom as to how you completed it without going back through the underground path?
---
I'd rather eat chalk than do this quest again
---
Yeah, I found this quest after I got a master clue scroll from easy hunting. Ironically I need to do quests to get the bard some barrows gloves  so I did it
---
It teleports with you.

Might actually go do this. Found a guide that I would opt to use:

Oh man that sounds crazy

Oh ok thanks
---
I don't have a problem with it other than that there are plenty of rats and seagulls to splash elsewhere, but he chooses to splash hill giants out of spite since it was removed from Lumbridge.
---
Quick fix would be to just add a dummy somewhere (wizard tower?) that can be splashed on and ban this sort of behavior since it kind of is disruptive.
---
I like the idea of the superiors, it would make it a bit more challenging and fun without changing too much.
---
Add superiors at a random amount, and for every 1 killed maybe the whole team comes out with another point. IDK
---
Isnt there a subreddit for this kind of fuck up?
---
Genuinely curious about this.
---
2 hours of failing and haven't been back since
---
No because you should be thieving for cakes at level 5
---
I think people who play like this enjoy that setup because either TV alone or OSRS alone isn‚Äôt enough stimulation. Osrs helps through the commercials and tv through the afk parts of training
---
The two are so intertwined it's not even worth saying something like this.
---
I understand what you are saying. However, I see this game as being quite liked by its players. Maybe it's not liked, but it certainly is played a lot.
---
That sort of brings up a question of why they should change it? After all, from a purely economic point of view, this product has demand. If they change it, would it still have the same demand?
---
The sort of extreme through process is this: are players simply addicted and not enjoying the game? Should the game just be deleted then?
---
However, I think that people either enjoy the grind or enjoy the late game content after the grind.
---
Yeah then you get bored as shit cause you‚Äôre killing monsters to level slayer and gaining xp in skills that don‚Äôt matter
---
Wait...am I not supposed to be flat packing my mahogany tables?
---
Teleports genius

To be fair, you never said SOME either. You just said pkers. The implication is all from that statement, not some.

Got in an argument with someone in the CC I'm in about this. He's a nearly maxed player that says he enjoys osrs over any other mmo he has ever played. 
---
Someone in the CC was complaining about doing mm2. The nearly maxed player says something along the lines "well at least it's better than go kill X amount of creature quests in other MMOs"
---
I asked him if he likes slayer. "Oh yeah that's my favorite skill by far" do you prefer slayer or questing? "Slayer, I like quests but slayer is more enjoyable" but slayer is just the go kill X amount of creature quests in other games "no they're completely different"

After going back and forth he just told me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

When collector steps forward to load, equip the mind shield and use your hotkey to switch to prayers tab. Click the prayer your mouse is on 2-3 times, then switch back to your inventory using hotkey. Click mind shield again, hotkey back to prayers and click only 1 prayer this time. Tab back to inventory and click mind shield for the last time. Finally, spam click the ground as queen is taking damage to break any extra prayer interfaces and end the wave. When you become familiar with force-ending wave 10 with mind shields, you can make minor adjustments. If queen is close to cannon, you might do only 2 mind shield loops or stack less prayers. If queen is far away, you might do an extra loop. The method explained above may lose you a couple ticks sometimes, but is generally a safe way to get most of the possible time save.

Usually it's not worth it for profit solely, the people who recommend it haven't done the math or don't care about money (pet hunters).
