---
why does everyone have such urge to kill this game is literally baffling to me
---
Is this Evil Bob‚Äôs Basics in Education and Learning?
---
H
---
YES
---
Thanks! 
---
Does anyone care about your account? It's a game, it's just meant for fun.
---
Days of it being 2007scape are long gone, where have you been the past 5 years?
---
I'll give you a tip, you can see it in your screenshot.
---
Katarina Hartlova is so great
---
Yep. My 8m per 4 hours for 10mins of flipping an item with a constant 1mil margin is less efficient than spending an hour and a half at a job I hate. Keep telling yourself that, friend.
---
As a level 99 I support this notion, lets get this polled as\[
---
The same reasoning of "we know better than the players" is what caused eoc and RS3 to get the go ahead. The entire existence of the polls is because the community vocally refused to trust jagex when it comes to osrs updates.
---
[removed]
---
Loooool top quality 
---
Not bug abuse. Its not a bug, and its certainly not abuse, since JageX have acknowledged the method (now intended to be in the game) so re-phrase to: non-bug use. I cant expect you to know this though. 
---

---
And being maxed doesnt mean youre free from feeling lazy and entitled. Plenty of maxed normies.
---
Feel like this should be tagged "spoiler"
---
Then why the fuck do you want this shit sand method retard.
---
Nah, its the only way to train a skill. I think its okay to give them the bare minimum.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt give good exp which it wouldn‚Äôt have because of the cap there would be no demand for sandstone 
---
73/75/70 att/str/def. I figured out how to add grind NMZ so if I wanted them to be higher I guess that's an easy way.
---
Magic is pretty crap, like 56. Would need a bit of gold for spamming HA but I mostly put it off because I didn't want to spam HA.
---
bruuhhh 2 hunter
---
In one of his streams, he said he's actually going to be doing ToB with other morytania-locked ironmen.  Not necessarily UIM, but morytania-locked.
---
Oh shit, i wonder in which patch they secretly added that one
---
Because autism has trouble with the non-literal
---
Yeah...maybe everything OUTSIDE of grinding filling up buckets for a week, this isnt an argument for the  crafting skill as a whole so not sure why youre even bothering to mention it.
---
The point is a specific method that is a method every iron uses (again I dont even play an iron, just the logic behind not improving it makes 0 sense) is unnecessarily painful. You must be forgetting that filling up the buckets is simply the first part, you still have to spend another 50+ hours actually training the skill. The amount of time spent and what you have to do in order to actually train the skill is just as horrible as sitting there mining. Training a skill and how enjoyable it is, is something that is subjective anyway...but EVERYONE objectively hates filling up freakin buckets and the amount of time you have to spend doing it to actually train the skill. 
---
Again, the only argument youre making is that it sucks a shit ton to do but it should still stay the same because...why again? Because everybody should suffer because you have had to? Game integrity isnt an argument because it has little to no impact on it, youre just grasping at straws trying to find a legitimate reason why it shouldnt be sped up to some level, maybe not 6x faster though.
---
But this doesn't alleviate any of his limitations. As far as I can tell, the net doesn't circumvent any obstacle whatsoever. In fact, all it does it open up more content for him too. Net positive. 
---
People shouldn't be focusing on the 100gp/sand.  Obviously thats insane but we should be focusing on the fact that a very decent and popular update passed but was randomly not implemented because some "high level players" (ironman who already have 99 crafting) complained to jagex.    Give us infinite sand and the xp rate will probably only go up to like 90k/h 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How many ironmans have untrimmed cooking though? I got it on my ironman because it‚Äôs kind of unconventional and I‚Äôve never seen anyone else with one
---
Oh derp! I see now haha Thanks bud! 
---
That's how I felt when making the trap version of the drake and josh theme song
---
 it wouldn't be morytania only then
---
He's going to force randoms by training one skill and doing another after 15 minutes I used to do it back in the day
---
Still wishing it had been polled, I've been in MLM so I haven't gotten to officially see it for myself. Ughh. Lumbridge and Draynor no longer appear how they originally were anywhere.... could've at least just put a rowboat and not a whole dock.
---
sit kid, swamp hat best hat
---
I don‚Äôt think they are referring to exp about this..? They might be talking about cash per hour. Not sure though. 
---
What cap? The cap with the update would be 1080 xp/cast.
---
I think a fair penance would be to break the tainted tool store after picking up a fresh saw and new planks 
---
imagine taking dfs and lance into wildy
---
oh fuck yeah, please?
---
No need to poll that, its a integrity issue.
---
Probably because it's all everyone's talking about. Maybe the video series uses dramatic music that excites you.
---
How was I in any way being edgy you fucking meme spouting idiot 
---
&gt;ironmeme07
---
is it tho?
---
Bruh when did he do a face reveal ?
---
ya I don't know who you think I am but having two alts that have both done ds2 sounds a little bit high autism for me
---
I'm honestly kind of scared for the integrity of this game longterm when people unironically ask why doubling the current max xp/hr of a skill (which is already the second fastest skill) is bad LOL
---
How can you turn this into something negative? Jagex did great, 'everything' passes nowadays and they polled an incorrect solution to an existing problem and corrected it when they realized - by the help of reddit that the solution can be done much better than what they had thought of.
---
No you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre the only one on reddit that knew what dopamine was until last week
---
what the actual fuck does your comment even mean
---
&gt; I'd much rather receive no Mining experience and faster sand
---
Yeah make it like 5k XP/h or something but significantly better sand
---
He could have built decorative rocks with limestone after only level 5 construction...
---
The Dorg crossbow is better than the mithril one, rune with broad bolts and up is the only crossbow better. If you're training, you're best off using darts/knives or even a shortbow. Crossbows are really bad xp/hour.
---
just for you ;)
---
OneChunkMan?
---
Aaanndd there goes all poll integrity... Pretty pathetic.
---
No, it's not. Part of the region lock is that you are locked out of things that aren't obtainable in your region
---
Agreed. That's another reason why it's kind of weird that he would want this change to be implemented.
---
Like I get doing your account and thinking "man I wish I had XYZ, that'd be nice", but to actually try and make those changes yourself is different.
---
Also, I'm not sure if I like the idea in general of Jagex throwing bones to these random snowflakes. What happens when Karamja only asks for some net or some other bs? The reason ash added that thing was "so that Dragula will have a little bit better time playing runescape" and I personally don't think that's cool.
---
I didn‚Äôt say that. Just saying the word dopamine was rarely used. now it‚Äôs being used everywhere 
---
Don't worry bois, I am coming for Slayermusiq's clout. Working on a bunch of videos. 
---
Once I'm done with the videos, I'll be going for that b gloves record on Reddit.
---
i hope it pases lads!
---
Wtf r u talking about I‚Äôm clearly arguing against it. Wow. I feel bad now. Didn‚Äôt realize I was arguing with an actual developmentally disabled autismo
---
The funny part is once people actually get it, they will realize it's almost useless if you have been playing for a while since you've already developed muscle memory for the current setup.
---
You cant get smited if you smite yourself
---
Using the term ‚Äònormie‚Äô is edgy.
---
üò©üò≠üôè
---
On what basis are you saying the proposed solution was incorrect?
---
/u/SettledRS How do you feel about the community backing you on Project: Swampletics? 
---
I'd really like to know! 
---
You‚Äôre also paying a significant amount of gp for that mining exp at 100gp per bucket of sand. I believe that gp would have to be factored in if looking at an efficiency standpoint because that‚Äôs time as well. 
---
Seriously what is the context of this image?
---
Collecting resources by skilling in 2k19? Haven't you heard of slayer and PvM? Skilling is so 2007...
---
Two and a half wafer thin lines of gak and a can of Stella, now that's a party. 
---
You must be really fun at parties.
---
Swampletics. It‚Äôs a series that this guy releases every Wednesday, he‚Äôs a UIM self locked to Morytania with the ultimate goal of completing theater of blood
---
Season blue swamp lettuce should've evolved to melatonin or serotonin. Dopamine is so season red
---
That's how it's supposed to work, but what actually happens 99% of the time is it makes you hit a 0, thus healing nothing
---
Very much intentional
---
I mean... the previous update passed a poll, too. Not even *that* is an assurance that the update will actually happen.
---
Could you post the blank template? I tried googling it and failed :(

House tele tabs and my construction cape POH teleport used to tele me inside my house, but now they tele me right outside the portal.  Not sure if it's a bug or whether I switched a setting somewhere. Has anyone had this happen and know how to change it back?

Just finished ds2 and i sold my bank for a dhcb, I plan on doing nothing but grinding vork for the next few weeks.  Set up is normal range void, dhcb, salve(ei), anti dragon shield, blessed d hide boots, avas accumulator, ruby dragon bolts e, and a diamond dragon bolts e switch.  I can kill vork obviously since i finished ds2, its just my trips arent efficient at all i only get 1 kill.  I feel like im taking way more damage than i should.  Stats are 95 range, 95 hp, 80 def, 70 prayer.  Should i be praying mage or range the whole time?  Or are there any obvious gear upgrades?(besides elite void, ill be getting it soon i was just too excited after buying the dhcb and wanted to test my luck).  I only have 3 kc including the quest kill so mechanically i can for sure improve, i just feel like im missing something, how many kills per trip do people usually get?  Thanks and sorry for the long post.
---
Monaletics the edgeville monastery locked ironman
---
1250 or 1500 should be the min not 250
---
That makes sense thank you. The G.E on the website is such a trap for people like me that dont notice things like this

---
Limit to 3 or 4 giant seaweed per cast. Problem solved.
---
theres a pastebin somewhere look harder
---
Do you know the definition of correlation, though? Or you wanna disagree just because it's fun?
---
Use protect from range, elite void is very big, rigour is giant if you don't have it, also use bastion potions for defence and range. Other than that get the mechanics down better and gl!
---
You fucking automation bots couldn't find a bug if it bit you in the ass. Go write more scripts kid. 
---
There is a setting under the house options whether you tele outside the portal, or inside your house when using a house tele. You must have accidentally switched it 
---
Click on options (the wrench icon), click on the gouse at the bottom, set "teleport inside" to on.
---
Ahhh that makes sense, thank you for correcting me
---
You don't have to worry about it, you're not popular enough for Jagex to cater to you 
---
BP isnt really breaking the game, just too much dps. The serp helm passively killing monsters from afar was a bit too much. Serp helm is basically the same at saradomin gwd, because you can just tag minions with BP to venom. This is a better mechanic because it's harder to use at the other bosses.
---
Theres no 1m margin item you can consistently make money off of but sure dude, whatever makes you feel better. You're only lying to yourself.
---
Sure, that makes sense, I'm just surprised people are this okay with it. It's content creator favoritism, frankly.
---
Also, what is the point of these restricted accounts if the owners of said accounts are asking devs for changes to make their accounts less restricted?
---
Because it makes sense for mod ash to add this change from a business standpoint for Jagex doesn't automatically make it something we should all be in favor of or accept.
---
Are you allowed to watch it on loop?
---
Divine is in next poll
---
Conveniently edited page after the video came out, nice try tho.
---
You just proved my point.
---
They based it on ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô.
---
Feedback = people reeeeee-ing on reddit. 
---
The only other ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô they have is the 85% yes vote... so can‚Äôt have based it on that.
---
‚ÄòFeedback‚Äô, used in the sense that both you and the Dev blog have described, is not a basis for determining a game changing decision.
---
THATS THE PROBLEM!
---
Im concerned when a skill that offers next to nothing is offered a meaningful update and people lose their minds over it.  If this was RC or agility would you still be this bitchy about it?  All crafting offers at max level is zenyte jewelery and that requires intense grinding OR jsut skipping the grind and buying it.  
---
And again, firemaking is 100% free to train to 99, takes like an hour to get the wc/fm skills to do it, and one quest, then you can train 1-99 FOR FREE, while pumping more resources into the game FOR FREE, in a minigame/boss that PUNISHES HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS because of how damage is dealt.  So... Wintertodt gives 1-99 for free that can be done at level 1 using cakes, while sandstone requires a specific non-rewarding quest, 1 mil gp for teleport, mining levels to do it, 77 magic for super glass make AND 2 additional quests and all quests for THOSE quests, one of which have a 4 part boss battle... 
---
But sandstone is bad, and wintertodt is fine?  Cool, seems legit, fair and balanced game, no issues here.
---
‚ÄúQoL is... not necessarily QoL.‚Äù Lmao I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm getting downvoted about this this is new content
---
That thing will tear you to shreds
---
People would tb themselves with an alt then go fight people when there is only a little bit of time left on the tb so that they are safe from getting tbed and can escape easily if necessary (because tb is almost up). This change made it so the tb got cleared when you logout/hop so you couldn't effectively abuse it anymore.
---
1250 is closer. I wouldn't want it so that only the late game players can participate in the polls. That's how we literally only get end game content and the game dies
---
It's clear that Jagex considered it and came to the conclusion that you *should* be able to find a small fishing net in Morytania. It's just that it took the morytania accounts to bring it to their attention. The change wasn't necessarily only for mory accounts.
---
Cheers, likewise
---
It definitely is more of a novelty overall. Pet chance, d pick, and visage. But it is decently profitable. A good first boss experience.
---
What world
---
Yea, like the Saw thing in Settled's newest video.
---
Obviously, getting Saw isn't mandatory, and there is a workaround to it if you allow yourself exceptions, but given how there already is a construction shop in the area.. it makes very little sense for that shop not to sell a saw.
---
It's not a huge change by any means, but makes a big difference for region-locked accounts. It's just that most content in RS isn't made with region-specific accounts in mind, and so there are bound to be a few oversights like this.
---
Only sad that Settled didn't see this before he made that video, he could have just requested Ash to add a Saw to that shop lmao.
---
Yah it's a big issue and often results in people being scammed. Jagex will occasionally change the prices manually to speed things up.
---
It would make A Souls Bane available for pures, but for now that is 0 impact.
---
??
---
How many times this gonna be posted today lmao 
---
They only make realistically changes that make sense lore wise, and they are changes that don't affect anybody negatively. I don't see any problem. 
---
Can we have a legitimate re-run QOL question? [Q10 on 7/7/17](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/a=13/oldschool/results.ws?id=1369) needs reworded and ran again, failing at 72.85%. The original question attempted to introduce togglable xp, which is not desirable, but removing the xp is.
---
Suggested question: "Should the 2 Strength XP given when pushing through wheat on the Hunter minigame Puro-Puro be removed?"
---
Original question: "Should a toggle option be added to allow players to opt out of receiving Strength XP when pushing through wheat on Puro-Puro? Pushing through the magical wheat found on Puro-Puro currently grants 2 Strength XP."
---
Wear some d'hide and get your mage up to not get teleblocked as easily, wear a glory to teleport out when someone comes for your cheeks.
---
Because none of the polled shop items passed, lol. 
---
This series is awesome and unique... But it's all I've seen on this subreddit lately 
---
This is literally all that had to do to ensure the change wasn't too drastic imo
---
That helped a lot, thanks man
---
Surprised there aren‚Äôt more dislikes 
---
Two questions:
---
1) Got 99 slayer today. Only planning on doing slayer for boss tasks from here on out - what should my block list be to encourage the most boss tasks?
---
2) For completing fossil displays, once I complete all of the small fossil displays, for example, will I continue to get small fossil drops during activities? Like, can I get more of a fossil type than I need to finish all the displays?
---
Many people don't mind the cost of the blowpipe, plus even though they have more range defence, the blowpipe is overpowered and thus probably stronger regardless.
---
Why is divine being polled? It's failed multiple times, nobody is asking for it, and it is incredibly overpowered and would change many metas. On top of that a ton of people already do corp for the 3 current spirit shields.
---
They will be moving Veos and his boat back to port sarim but in a different spot.
---
Okay, ignore the first part of my comment where I ask about what the community actually refers to as one-tick prayer flicking.
---
This doesn't change anything I've said.
---
&gt;but you literally don't lose prayer when doing this
---
Sure, but that is not what happens in the videos.
---
Both require a far higher degree of concentration, effort, and skill than the alternative. They are perfectly balanced.
---
I honestly don't think they should poll so much. Massive changes to the way the game is played, yes. But, there's a reason that polling every update isn't a common thing in games. Devs know better than the community does. 
---
Also, Reddit really shouldn't be used as an indicator on what the community wants. It's nice that they communicate so we'll, but things posted here aren't representative of the entire community. 
---
In response to this specific change, I don't care either way as it's not something I'd ever do anyways.
---
Jagex clearly put it there for him, and I think it's awesome. 
---
Second only to DMT
---
yea no idea, but at least the 10 people using the official client will be happy
---
Ah yes this is true. my apologies.
---
Yeah tbh I feel like it should be required that you have something like say 85 mining to get rune ore as a drop.
---
I finally beat Jad!!! Now on to my next challenge, Zulrah.
---
Anyone have any tips? I'm 99rng and 75mage yet Zulrah has killed me 18 times. Should I get 80-85 magic before I go back?
---
This is why I love ironman mode, and whilst there is still a fair bit of resource generation through PvM, there is still so much self-sufficiency, that it makes it so much more enjoyable to me!
---
Sometimes the fewest pixels make the biggest difference 
---
Fuck pures
---
I mean the most efficient way is with elite void, dhcb, and 99 stats but that doesn't mean your method is bad. 
---
Agreed. I can't see why this is a bad change when something like wintertodt exists and is defended. 
---
Second question, yes.
---
Nice
---
D
---
1. In theory I'd imagine you'd pick whichever slayer master has the highest weighting for boss tasks, then block the highest weighted tasks.  
---
  
---
2. I've not completed the fossils but considering you can turn them in to other things than just the displays. I'd assume you can get more.
---
Fuck # spoiled
---
settled also posts his videos to Reddit
---
Plenty of people had problems with Slayer EHP being nearly tripled though? They just got dismissed as sweaty nerds like all other times ridiculous updates pass. 
---
&gt; Devalues my i-shouldnt-be-an-ironman-but-i-am-an-ironman-anyway-because-im-an-snowflake-reddit-btw-man btw
---
I seriously have no idea why these people made an ironman in the first place if they just want to play it like a main.
---
TIL that blurred images = spoiler
---
Well if you‚Äôre using magic you‚Äôre better off using the occult for the magic damage bonus %. There are boots that grant magic damage %, hence the devout boots/ holy sandals
---
It is a bug though, even though Jagex has acknowledged it and accepted it, it's not like it was a feature that was implemented on purpose...
---
The moved Veos back to port sarim and removed the dock. I believe the quest takes you there instead. 
---
1) It is hard to account for everything during the concept stage. For situations like Sandstone, that is what Dev Blogs are aimed to help with but for QoL Month the process was a bit rushed. For the Hitsplats, they believed they could do it but when they went to make the changes they found it was more complex than expected. So they wouldn't have polled it if they knew they couldn't implement it within the expected timeframe.
---
2) They can't edit an active poll. They'd have to discard the entire poll and do it over to remove the question and during QoL Month they don't have the time to do that unless you want the second poll to last 2 days or such.
---
3) They said pretty clearly in the Dev Blog the poll was rushed. QoL Month doesn't allow a lot of time for feedback and they didn't catch enough before the poll was live, or it took a bit to be given. Normal polls tend to be better about this but there is always a chance it can happen.
---
4) Probably has to do with the "we believe that what we offered didn‚Äôt solve the issues we wished to address" part.
---
And the proposed solution shouldn't be scrapped since they will have taken more feedback on board. It is very rare they go against poll results and it only happens when there are notable balancing concerns. Also, just because someone is part of the "high-level community" doesn't mean the concerns they raise aren't valid. Many of those players know a lot about the game so there is a good chance they'd catch things others would overlook and if that results in higher exp than intended, it is worth bringing to attention. If the OSRS Team polled it as a 200% buff and it turns out to be a 400% buff because of something they didn't consider, that is a big deal even if it doesn't apply to most players and we shouldn't ignore it just because you want the 200%.
---
thing is settled has better content so its alright for him!
---
Can also mean NSFW
---
You're actually a dumbass. I didn't want to have to say it, but I'm surprised you don't know you can buy and sell an item one at a time. Outstanding, I know. 
---
It's only 8 elysians total and each offer takes 2min at most to fully complete both ways. Your 500m is "locked" for 2minutes. Nice
---
You are really dense lol
---
Is there always an available fishing net spawn where fishing spots are? If there weren't, and I pitched the idea to Jagex that they should add a small fishing net near fishing spots for lore purposes, do you think this would be a good use of their time?
---
I'm not calling you out, i genuinely want to know what your opinions are for these questions.
---
Ah bummer. These unid. large fossils need to start coming in a bit quicker then, I'm almost done w/ small &amp; med and I'm still 20 kudos away.
---
Yeah but i mean while using piety or other offensive prayers. If youre not attacking and getting attacked on the same tick its either more effort or less efficient if ur not using piety. 1 ticking you can have overhead + piety on all the time and like you said, its just rhythm. If youre not using piety youre basicly training combat and slayer 20-30% slower which is pretty huge 
---
One bad update doesn't mean jagex should add more bad updates. Also firemaking is pretty much a worthless skill. Crafting is not. 
---
Ah yeah makes sense. I just haven't gotten to the Occult yet as an ironmeme with only 81 slayer. Makes sense though. Thanks!
---
Not by using blowpipe special apparently
---
That's why there was unrestricted worlds...
---
You have to dumb stuff down for kids. If my niece asks why my car starts when we get in im not going to tell her how gas combusts in the cylinders which pushes the pistons and so on so forth 
---
Doesn't mean they couldn't have added it later
---
Mining is a worthless skill lmao. Crafting at least gives you Amulet or if you're an 1 def ironmeme like me also amulet of regen which is BiS and also useful for it's regen.
---
Most people don't think ironman mode in terms of efficiency, for example I only think about goals which make me better in combat and in this case, which allows me to obtain 90 crafting (or less with boosts) the fastest.
---
Mining has literally no relevance for my ironman outside of money and that can be obtained through different, more fun ways, since smithing doesn't produce anything useful.
---
It's literally a dead skill if it isn't for other uses, such as more efficient sand gathering as described in the poll.
---
Cute... took me 10k tokens to get one... then got a second one the cyclops after....  this game hates me!
---
Start saving up the hog juice 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs a different game but nothing noticeably changed so it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
How did konar slayer boost prayer? Or was it just for a break? 
---
It's a very small file, and you can run it on a Texas instruments scientific calculator
---
I'm just glad polling is a thing so PvPtards like you only get to whinge on Reddit instead of ruining the game.
---
Fair enough. That's your opinion, and I got nothing else to convince you at this point.
---
Personally, I don't think the Devs should entertain requests like these. I don't think this time was an issue, but I don't like the precedent of catering to arbitrary accounts.
---
LMAO
---
Change your linked email address password. Or create a new linked email just for the account. Set up an Authenticator too if you had it disabled, all after virus scanning your computer for a key logger
---
Will look you all up when I get on lunch. Combat 101 and really looking at starting raids 1 soonish. Need to finish the last 30 QP for Barrrows gloves however.
---
Yeah the barrows spade is an excellent point because when it was first released there was no spade so if you forgot it then you had to run back to a bank. They later added the spade because it makes sense to not punish people for not having basically worthless items.
---
I am not a pvper u ballsack. Sorry, people like other things than a glorified farmville.
---
I can't be bothered with that, so I just have them in fossil storage for now. Maybe they will get more use later
---
How recently. It was changed with the first drop table nerf. Because like 300 sharks was stupid. 
---
The vocal minority does not weigh out the majority. Are we even going to pretend that their "solution" is a convoluted gold sink? With their supposed "fix", you would have to tick mine at 99 to barely be above the charter shop method. This "fix" is of course brought to you by the same people that claimed that shops shouldn't be the optimal way to get resources.
---
Wym niche. Its supposed niche is already filled the by the elysian....
---
With only 11 kc why solo?
---
Honest question 
---
You can't buff the mundane. That's what makes people scream. If people had fun, more content is more fun. If people had to grind, suddenly it's "devaluing".
---
The divine spirit shield question took me by surprise. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to see that one. 
---
Where would you have to get mining EXP anyway if it isn't for diaries unless you are going for max?
---
Very few people want to go for max, mining is a dead skill if you aren't going for max as any benefit from mining can be gained from other ways.
---
Go get some sleep lol
---

At this point I‚Äôd rather fill 100,000 buckets of sand myself rather than getting a high mining level and 3 ticking sandstone as well as paying 10M GP just to get 99 crafting on my Ironman.
---
I guess I‚Äôll make an exception, but there will only be this exception and one other and *that‚Äôs it*.
---
It's honestly really annoying that so many skills in the game have almost no worthwhile reward for training them up to a high level. 
---
&gt; easily cast more than 1k/hr.
---
6000 ticks an hour, most tryhards i've watched manage 1 cast every 7-8 ticks
---
750-850 casts/hr assuming you don't pickup any excess
---
they definitely would've capped the glassmake xp though as it'd still have been a ridiculous buff
---

We need a quest where we go and fight a new boss underneath this man‚Äôs stall. Some sort of crystal monster that looks like Regice and hordes gems. New drop, multi-gem, that can be used as a substitute to craft any necklace. 
---
Sign in
---
Thanks dude :)
---
And 5 gloves rip
---
If you have 99 ranged you might have more luck only using ranged, and using the space that would otherwise have mage gear in it for more food.
---
Ideally you would be able to kill zulrah with your current stats, but it obviously will be easier if you got your magic up.
---
too wholesome
---
\+H
---
Depends on your combat level. If you our over 75 then you could make that much doing konar slayer I guess. 
---
This whole month has become such a giant shitshow.
---
This is correct. Can only attempt the clues with 3+ karamja steps. Avarage rate is around 1/14 for a karamja steps, so pretty time consuming
---
Wrong. Blowpipe special gives a guaranteed 0% accuracy in next shot
---
Lunar staff is destroyed on death and has a cost to it while dramen staff serves the exact same purpose and instead of paying something like 80k i think for lunar staff you can just chop a few dramen branches for free
---
And that‚Äôs exactly what it is... an unpopular opinion. No one cares.
---
Lmao of course you lose money while learning. But over time, raids are one of the best money makers in the game, probably top 3 or 4. And honestly not dying at olm isn‚Äôt hard, just focus on living before you focus on damage and after 10 kc dying should be infrequent.
---
I mean I was doing pretty good with the whole sobriety thing but I fell down the stairs an hour ago and now I think my arm is broken so I guess that‚Äôs going all out the fucking window 
---
They mentioned some tomorrow in the Q&amp;A today. I don't have a timestamp, but this should be the [VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/380044125).
---
Empty room?   hmmm    OH GOD NO PLEASE
---
 \-clicks intensify- 
---
Fair enough, thanks for the help.
---
Not currently because you can't fit any more than 3/18. There's no xp cap, it's just not possible since buckets of sand are 1:1 atm
---
&gt; the factor between what the normal players can achieve and what the elite skillers can is huge
---
Well, of course, there is a big gap between higher levels and higher effort of the same thing. Tick Manipulation isn't bug abusing; it is more difficult but more rewarding way to play the content and the fact they are acknowledging it show that it is a legitimate thing. It is kinda like how you can just kill Vorkath normally or you can Woox Walk the poison phase; that has a notable impact on your kill speed, but it is a lot harder to do and master. So it seems your problem is more that Tick Manipulation exists than how they handled this situation.

I had to log onto my porn account to upvote this again

Isn't changing the client for pvm and not pvp furthering the us vs them mentality?

Honestly, I just need someone to do rc/agility for me.......

I‚Äôd get her barrows gloves if she would get 77 rc for me :p
---
gl withdrawing whatever 18:6 seaweed/sandstone combination in 1 tick and clicking the spell again
---
Most people haven't played since the very beginning. OSRS has blown up in the last couple years. I don't want a game where the masses of uninformed, power creep wanting, grind hating players are allowed to make decisions. That's how we get a game that only caters to PvM, raising xp/hr, and OSRS starts dying.
---
This mad man also got the Max cape on a UMI after like 7000 hours
---
It needs to be overgrown for you to get a second one which is 2-3 hours after it‚Äôs already progressed into a full sized cat. 
---
Yeah I figured since it's so popular there's no shot, but it's like playing the Powerball or something and I rarely use the full other 5 spots anyway. Plus it's just fun to think about, and a whip has a heavy nostalgia factor for me having just come back to OSRS so it's fun to dream lol 
---
"Same recycled bullshit" yep that describes Timthetatman's videos nowadays.  
---
900 KC, 2 claws, 2 leathers, 3 tails, 1 ring piece and 2x knife drops... wtf is my luck
---
i dont even see him at the port...
---
wont let me
---
The concept makes sense though. More weight which means more mass which means more sand which makes more glass. I‚Äôm sorry your autism is affected and your time spent playing a game mode feels devalued.
---
I'm 60 something crafting on my ironman. I'm happy that my grind will be longer as I had been looking forward to that huge goal of getting high crafting.
---
Isn't he still at Draynor?
---
There are a few big gear investments like a whip that are essential if you are going to do 100s of hours of slayer or bossing.  Other stuff like 15 mil+ items are less valuable than skill levels that unlock diaries and other unlocks.  If you need to you can buy and sell items like a whip or dpick when you change activities.  Its a balancing act, if theres anything specific ask.
---
I saw a good video recently recommending chaos gauntlets with the fire spell.
---
You can tank the bosses with rune plate + legs, as the bosses you would use have a low enough magic defense that your magic offense isn't too relevant for accuracy/dps. 
---
Somehow you managed to misinterpret this by equating a small backwater village to an entire region equaling almost half of Gilenor.
---
GG, you played yourself.
---
Had to talk to Dark Mage in the Abyss so I had a skull and then got another wildy step
---
If you are planning on camping Zulrah for money then I would say get about 10 more magic levels then go back. If not then just keep plowing through with that one kill
---
Unlike the other comment I don‚Äôt recommend trying to learn with just ranged. It‚Äôs better in the long run to start with fewer switches but do both styles. 
---
As for learning what I did was just keep a guide with the rotations up next to the game window. It just takes time to get it down and after about 100 kc you won‚Äôt need the guide anymore  
---
This is not wrong. There is a certain degree of change in original work before it is a different thing. This is a minimal adjustment, not creation. People here don't really get it.
---
It's like I took a picture, not mine, and adjusted the hue on photoshop to make the grass blue, and call it "original work by me, the artist". It's pretentious and lazy. Anyone supporting this is either ignorant or trolling.
---
Just joined a cc full of zeah only ironmen and there is no pestle and mortar there...it‚Äôs one of our exceptions, along with doing Druidic ritual of course.
---
Skip it.
---
Otherwise blowpipe and some cheap god items for the wildy dungeon.
---
If there are other reasons, fine, but affecting ironmen isn't valid, it's an optional side gamemode that was never meant to affect players of standard accounts. 
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know :)
---
Wish there was more consistency between PvP and the normal game. Tired of how items (and now interface/prayers) change simply 
---
 because you walk into the wilderness.
---
it says southernmost dock of port sarim and i dont see him lmao
---
Quality of life suggestion, let me update my offer without having to cancel and make a new one.
---
Engine work
---
Me thinks, He thinks I'm making fun of my bro horse head
---
Honestly feel like it should be pushed to live/unrestricted worlds then repolled to remove/cancel.   
---
You can't just cancel it and it sets a bad precedence for future polls where devs can backtrack and override poll results.
---
S
---
&gt; The same reasoning of "we know better than the players" is what caused eoc and RS3 to get the go ahead.
---
That's completely different. That was about Jagex *introducing* something that hurt the game. This is the opposite. This is Jagex *refusing* to introduce something because they believe it would change the game for the worse.
---
I don't see how Jagex not changing the game can ever be spun into talk about EoC and RS3 happening all over. It's literally the exact opposite.
---
If you have access to a rock cake to get to 1hp you can do an absorbtion method and then use mage gear. The chaos gauntlets are a good idea.
---
Ohkay
---
Don't play a pure then you dimwit. It's a limitation you choose, not given to you.
---
Idiot, downvoted, still a bad post that you should delete 
---
Maybe bludgeon, b ring, torture? Depends on what you want to do but if you just wanna do slayer could be good.
---
The easy clue just stabs you.
---
Thanks friend 
---
He's not there any more, he's in draynor on the new dock there and they said they'll be removing that one and putting him back in port sarim but in the spot where the corsairs are atm
---
Wow your kids are super adorable. 
---
Can't you buy cards on amazon?
---
I completely agree that it's BS that they're not implementing it after passing a poll, but that's a risk you take when preparing for something before it's in the game.
---
same. doesnt work for me either
---
You used to be able to do something similar at flesh crawlers back in the day.  Nobody really knew why it worked but it was too consistent for it to be coincidence.
---
You got it bub
---
Zulrah is much more about remembering the phases and being ready for the next one. Your stats are more than fine to get kills with 
---
&gt; However, it basically required 1m for camulet, hard diary for closer teleports and more effort
---
The only relevant part there is the higher effort. 1m and hard diary are low requirements for a method that is 6 times faster.
---
&gt; Let the sandstone give 25% less charges
---
No, rather give it 25% of the originally proposed charges. That would be balanced as it would be faster than the current method while also giving substantial mining xp.
---
‚ÄúHey jagex can you uh add a rocktail spawn here thanks otherwise my tutorial only Ironman only gets shrimp‚Äù 
---
corsair cove?

Use the new wiki, not the old one.

The scale of Karamja, lmao. The bridge would be almost like walking down that hallway in Willy Wonka.

&gt; Jagex proposes to change the game radically
---
RS3 BOOOOIIS!
---
&gt; Jagex refusing to change the game radically
---
RS3 BOOOIIS!
---
Huh? They're literally opposites?
---
Well I would assume so given he said 30 hour grind isn't a problem anymore....
---
What kind of logic is this? A recolour doesn't take the slightest bit of time compared to new content creation. You're not losing content from this. 
---
How do you think it works? "Alright boys, we can either create a new quest, new skill guild, or new PvP content. Or we can instead spend the exact same amount of time and resources to a graceful set recolour. Mind you we can only have one of those."
---

It's pretty easy with mousekeys + the new 1click withdraw all.
---
Click once for 18, mousekeys 6, bind R to escape to close interface faster.
---
I actually dont mind the price. Most high level ironmen (I'm assuming it will be used by ironmen almost exclusively) have more cash than they know what to do with. 
---
Even after 99 smithing and construction, I have more money than I'll ever spend. This is compounded especially with just how fucking profitable Slayer has become. I make like 8-10m/task in alchables and cash alone every Hydra task.
---
If it's any way to measure, the gold selling spam accs used to sell 1m for like 4USD, then it was like 1USD in 2017. Now I see them spamming 88 cents per 1m gp at the GE. There is just an absurd amount of cash in game.
---
And ironmen don't have to pay for scales, darts, tassets, armadyl armour, rapiers, dhcb, etc. So I see the cost for the sand machine affecting mains way more.
---
Dude it was such a nice feel, found out its only a 1/64 but still really nice and my first pet ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think 99% of us agree this is largely inconsequential and shouldn't be a point of contention. 
---
‚ÄúThey polled 1 thing too early before listening to actual feedback and considering balancing issues, must mean that they don‚Äôt care about any poll results and will just do whatever they want‚Äù
---
If you truly believe they will just do whatever they want regardless of polls why even waste your time voting no? They‚Äôll just do it regardless

---
&gt;I am struggling to understand why this poll has been cancelled. Whilst yes it was a drastic change in buckets of sand per hour, it is improving what already is a mindless grind and I'm going to explain multiple issues below.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The trust in polls - You made the executive decision to poll this prematurely and you gave us the choice. We gave you a huge majority in favour and now you're failing to uphold your end of the deal. This alone will impact how we view future polls and we don't actually know if what we vote for is even going to be implemented. Trust between you and players will be damaged by this decision. Another question in the poll was about buffing volcanic ash. This is currently being botted by a large mass. Why not focus your attentions to the growing problem instead of hindering genuine players.  
---
&gt;Working with high level members of the community - To myself and probably many other people in the community, that instantly screams streamers and people that have already done this grind multiple times. You're taking information from people that have the time to sit collecting thousands upon thousands buckets of sand whilst entertaining their audiences. Whilst I agree it should not be "EzScape", the data collecting is very bias and the grind itself is already an extremely long process. The majority have told you they want this update. The integrity of the game is not at risk due to this update, only your reputation for not upholding your side of the poll system.  
---
&gt;The change in sand per hour - You have made it clear that you do want to improve sand per hour but this new proposed method is an ever so slight increase for a much more click intensive method. To efficiently mine the sandstone, it requires multiple quests, gp and a hard diary. Why are we not able to reap the rewards instead of the rates being dropped to numbers that barely benefit us. At this rate, you may as well afk at the sand pits as you're not really missing out on many buckets of sand per hour.  
---
&gt;ShopScape -  "we‚Äôre not the biggest fans of ShopScape". You are still enabling ShopScape and this can only be succeeded by a small margin by those who tick manipulate with 99 mining. I don't think anymore needs to be said here. If you can't see the problem, then I really don't know what to tell you.  
---
&gt;The result is that you went to one extreme of massively buffing sand to barely a buff at all unless you've got 99 mining or want to hop 5000 times. You gave us a choice, now uphold your end of the system.
---
THIS \^ @modash @oldschoolrunescape

I fucking love this series. High quality editing/audio/capturing, honest enthusiasm, Well thought out strategies, complete dedication to the concept and its grinds, composed/well spoken/positive narration,  open dialog with followers, and just god damn I love you.
---
That's entirely fair! Thank you for the hype up haha it was a slow time at KBD
---
This sounds like a very serious and important question for you. I'll have my team look into it and get back to you ASAP, fear not by dorito-munching friend.
---
Uh oh there it is
---
Don't you dare train combat without worrying about macroefficiency üò°
---
DFH is a very bad example to draw comparisons to, it in itself is a very scarce and rare drop where adding new ways to get it will have a much bigger impact on the price stability. Brews are not the same. You can get them from many different methods and they are extremely plentiful on the market. A few people a day total at max (probably less as time went on) getting 2,500 brews would not have any kind of meaningful long term effect on what is already a very highly traded and plentiful resource.
---
Moldy bedsheets
---
This is so cool.
---
nice dude i feel your excitement
---
Not surprised that his first concern is people running around and not the bots illegally gambling with 0:1 odds. This fits really well
---
Post proof that the 16.5% have more understanding of the game than the 83.5% I'll wait. 
---
That's me and I have a dick, hope you don't mind. 
---
The difference is that while the meta might be different between pvp and pvm, this actually changes the mechanics of the game.
---
[Here's](https://services.runescape.com/m=news/osrs-reveals-song-of-the-elves?oldschool=1) everything that was talked about at runefest for the elf expansion. [Here's](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-i?oldschool=1) the poll blog from the last month.
---
I understand what you're saying in principle, but we're talking about a game which ultimately Jagex has complete control over. The precedent is already set. I'd support your points if and when the Jmods start making changes to the game that affect non-region locked accounts, but until that point you don't really have a leg to stand on. Jagex can make any changes they would like for any reason. We can complain about changes they make that we don't like, but complaining about changes we don't mind simply because it shows that they can make changes for any reason doesn't make sense.
---
Region locked accounts have become "a thing" now. Obviously there are some restrictions that you have to accept when playing this way. It would of course be stupid for example to enable you to complete a quest from another region by adding an alternate storyline or something of that nature.
---
Adding a low valued and easily available (in the rest of the game) item to a shop or as a spawn is not the same thing. There's no reason, lore or otherwise that you shouldn't be allowed a fishing net in moritanya, a teasing stick in karamja or any other readily available item in any other region. It's simply that the unavailability hasn't affected anyone up to this point, so it hasn't needed to be altered.
---
Adding these items allows a player to access content that wasn't intentionally blocked from them. You can't go and ask the mods for an item drop to make skilling easier on your normal account for example because that content isn't arbitrarily locked for you. You can go and get any item in the game. For a region locked account that isn't an option.
---
The only way I can see for you to argue against this is to say that region locked accounts aren't valid and Jagex should tell them to suck it up and go and get these items if they want them (Settled literally did that in this video with the saw so it's not a ridiculous thing to suggest). Clearly the Jmods have indirectly accepted region locked accounts as at least unofficially valid by adding these item spawns.
---
I'm not even arguing that Jagex should be doing this. I think it would be perfectly valid of them to simply say no, but I think it's equally valid of them to cater to region locked accounts in this way. Once again I wouldn't support bigger changes that are implemented only to cater to specific people, but there's no sign of that happening so there's no point complaining about it.
---
Finally to your point about wasting mod time: Adding an item that already exists in game to an existing shop or as a spawn will take literally minutes.

Ash said he doesn't mind and he replies to literally every tweet I've ever sent him.

Best developer of all time. Even if he can't handle something, he will give his input or explain to you that it is out of his reach.

Whether or not what he says is added to the game is another thing. But it's the conversation that counts.
---
ofc it happens to someone in arma, pegasians etc.. meanwhile i just want my damn head drop so i can go back slaying

Every account has to make the same grind for graceful why should especially irons get it back lol
---
Love your content dude, keep it up!
---
Probably takes hardly any time at all. Also according to one of your other comments "blowing the region lock wide open" is exaggerating a ton. It literally gives him a net. To fish and catch lizards. This is not a big issue, I feel like you just like complaining. Miniscule update that adds a decent amount of time to the journey. Boo hoo.

---
Why would you have to bank there anyway? Just plant, harvest (if Ironman), you can note  supplies from the leprechaun, and just go to next patch.. 
---
Do you not understand what odds are? Odds are not a guarantee, it's a chance of something happening.  A roulette table landing on black 17 times in a row doesn't mean "anything can happen", it means that the chances of landing on black doesn't decrease just because it landed on black the time before. The chance of landing on black is 50% no matter how many times it lands on black. Odds mean everything, and anything can't happen.
---
It isn't just "a town" it plagues the entire wilderness, is an eyesore and shouldn't be in the game.
---
But then why wouldn't you research what is in the area or make some kind of criteria of what an area needs? Rather than randomly picking an area then getting devs to add stuff you didn't check.
---
It's not a big deal and it's cool of jagex to do it, just think it would be easier to plan it out a bit in the first place.

Or just dont be lazy

When I was grinding agility a while ago I went on mobile a few times and found it quite good. Tried doing a quest on it the other day and dear god it was the worst experience I've ever had.

I love how they were silent after he explained. Like what are you going to do? Explain early 2000s java development to your 4 year old?

---
Being an autistic maxed player doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you know what‚Äôs better for the game. It may appeal to you, but if we listened to only the EHP tick manipulators this game would have 20k players online and still no grand exchange.
---
I get 20-25 kills an hour with void/bp/bgs with roughly the same stats as yours.  I don‚Äôt really keep track of the gp/hr though.  Seems like around 100-115k/kill.
---
Honestly, I do most quests faster by reading the wiki guides than I do when following his guides. When I want to mind numbingly go through quests then I use his guides, it all comes down to how you prefer to process information I guess.
---
Plus it's like, what? 40k/hour for xp I believe? Either way it's a decent xp rate compared to other skills so it'll be faster to get 29-99 than 1-29 lol

if so, though, get at least 50 
---
Honestly you are probably right on the DFH part being a bad example.
---
But for brews, even if just an additional 10000 is in the market each day, it would destroy the market. Thats assuming just 4 accounts per day. Another issue with the brews is the fact that it would completely nullify an already pathetic skill in herblore. Another being an easy gateway for accounts to access brews without the levels, primarily IM**.** Another being game feeling like a private server. 
---
It's not just the economy that takes a hit. It's a chain of events that will likely set precedence to people voting yes to absurd content to come in order to keep up with the trend.

So legit man, keep it up!

Ayiza left and now we're stuck with Gambit who's doing a piss poor job seeing what we've been dealing with from these past few weeks. 
---
Thanks! Im pretty sure there could be some adjustments in there it's really just an idea I had and felt like sharing. 
---
Everything coming to this game doesn't have to be slayer/pvm/bis items... Skilling should be as fun and not be taken as work or a boring chore you have to go thru to unlock more pvm content. We should actually enjoy training a skill in my opinion
---
Dont forget to drop/telegrab to keep untrimmed. 
---
You have to do the worst quest in the game to get it.

---
The new influx of players is causing upper management to put pressure on devs on pump new and exciting updates on the fly in order to retain the player base. I miss the good old days of '13-'14 when an update was a dime a dozen. Game updates constantly coming out and new game breaking or bis shit is introduced regularly now. We're heading down the same path we took back in 2012.
---
Nah , it should be in the legs slot. I wanna have a big golden tench hanging there. 
---
Pros; great for flexing at ge 
---
Cons; none
---
okay? just because you personally would do something one way doesn't change the fact that there are people in rev caves who do what I said and would bring a divine if it existed over the bulwark (Assuming they could afford it)
---
‚ÄúWe got everything we need. We got Bailey‚Äôs‚Äù 
---
The models themselves don't take long, but iirc Jagex has previously said having so many variations on the same object makes stuff revolving around that object take longer to do.
---
IMHO we should be getting new and different content rather than spending time to add an 8th skin to existing content
---
more bots
---
Try the osrs soa clan chat
---
So we won‚Äôt introduce an update that PASSES the polls with flying colours because it devalues a small minority, yet we won‚Äôt accept a poll that fails by one or two %, EVEN though it‚Äôs an obviously healthy update for the game.
---
What an absolute joke.
---
I think it's worth it, extends trips without cutting down on DPS like Guthans. Comboed with it you can pretty much do most of your tasks in one trip without even needing food.
---
Not to mention it will end up saving you money in the long run on supplies etc. Definitely think it's worth it over Bandos. 
---
But IDK, if you prefer Bandos use that, it's not a necessity by any means.
---
i bought 10k jute seeds a long time ago when they were like 5gp and i use those 
---
Probably because all the bots that are mining it as well so the amount of iron ores in the GE is huge, therefore the prices are low
---
Aaah, nothing like a nice cuppa tea!
---
This so much. When I saw that tweet mod ry wrote a couple weeks back regarding changing the pace of updates towards ironmen, I knew that we'd be in for a shit show.
---
The fact that they choose what to poll anyways means it was flawed from the start. Who polls the pollsters? 
---
obviously the divine would be stronger, but it would buff the already OP (140 base def is double that of a DFS) and it would have no negatives (divine has a prayer draining effect). This, coupled with the fact that the bulwark is something insanely cheap like 5M makes this suggestion just make PKers want to team up more and will reduce the already dwindling number of solo PKers.
---
is this "1 3 def"? if so, we're in the same cc

and congrats :)

I feel like half the tine Jagex doesn't understand the implication of polls. Look at the sandstone poll for example. 
---
disconnected from what the community wants 
---
Can your kids sign into your phone and drop me that tbow pls? thanks
---
I wouldn't even say flicking is that hard to behonest. It's super easy to get the hang of; it's not like tick manipulation with mining or fishing that shit though is next level.
---
Ya but statistically it's unlikely, so it's accurate to say it's more likely for him to get a better drop. He's literally for the bottom of the barrel, it's only up from there.

Riiiight

Youre welcome... i guess. Also happy cake day

Well I mean assuming the allegations are true it was more than a simple aggressive sexual move that was awkward. I dislike people discounting Spaceys work in the face of what he allegedly did, but I don't dislike them for thinking he did it. They can believe whoever they wanna believe.

This sort of resentment making its way into the polling system facilitates it further, no point in even polling such negligable stat boosts, esepecially if these anamosities are merely suspicions or among the minority. Nevertheless, very little information about what the gear would provide, a 1 prayer bonus, was given.
---
Who is this guy he seems very Settled.
---
If you're only getting 3 kills per trip you're doing something wrong but your gear and prayers are find. Make sure you're not taking avoidable damage and focus on only eating during the freeze phase/between kills so you don't loose dps
---
Dude I haven't even seen it yet thanks =(
---
Thank you!!

Changeable sb/pray icons *is* a large PvP update, at least it would be if making things that are needlessly complicated *slightly* more user friendly didn't completely devalue muh small icon clicking skill. But no by all means blame jagex for not implementing all the PvP suggestions that get posted (lol) 
---
instead of taking any blame for denying every little thing that could make PvP easier, which would incentivize more players to participate.
---
I've spent a little time in his hideout 
---
If it were op it would be used in pvp witch it isn't
---
For maxed player with good gear it might not be worth it for slayer but otherwise it is. Personally I'd buy torture&gt;sgs&gt;tassets&gt;bcp&gt;prims (prims might be out of order. Can't recall the stats off the top of my head)

---
Lol wtf

I was legit sad that there wasn‚Äôt going to be a level 2 hunter party
---
Gzz
---
As soon as possible mate. That extra damage really builds up. I'm just about to hit 98 slayer myself. I've been grinding the crap out of this for ages. Always happy to help out with skips/blocks/methods :)
---
Why should the rest of the players suffer through shit because PKers want to preserve their "skill"? If the only people who don't want a change are PKers, then it stands to reason to make it not apply to PKers, and let it apply to everyone else.
---
the limitation on the number of times you can cast it before you have to recharge it kept it in check, i made an iban blast pure wayyyyy back and as fun as hitting 25s at such a low combat is, going back through ugp every 60 casts really made it unwieldy not even taking into account having to pay 200k and get it from the iban disciples again if you died with it
---
the upgraded iban staff removed all of those downsides and made it usable for general purpose pvm like barrows and zulrah for ironmemes
---
51 iq! yeah!
---
It takes a long time to get clue drops, now think about how 1/14 of these clues are going to be viable karamja ones, now think about how you need to get 5. That may take more than a whole waking day. So if 1/128 swarms drop a clue and 1/14 of those are okay, and you need 5.. long time
---
duracell is the only slayer master
---
We like OSRS here buddy

If you made a YouTube series of your kids watching you play, I'd watch the hell outta that
---
"But daddy, hes gunna get closer" pfff yeah right
---
I quit at EOC and came back to the game to make one account I can pk on in my spare time. Lol long story short in the process of making a 10hp ironman iban pure because I think it's crazy good.
---
Yes I think it is  a powerful spell but dude it's a serious pain in the ass to get so imo if someone is committed enough to getting it at a low level than more power to them
---
This might be a dumb question but how did you record on your phone while playing? 
---
Yeah. I doubt it‚Äôll find anything but better safe than sorry. Don‚Äôt log in on that computer until the scan gives you an all clear
---
It's junk

I ghorrok tele and locator orb pretty damn fast. You lose two slots for the teleport runes but you can bring 3 tank items and the orb with protect item.

&gt; Why is everything recently labelled as an 'Ironman Update'? You'd never have anything if we didn't make something just because they can use it - why does it matter, why should everyone not get something just because iron people might slightly benefit from it? Genuinely interested

It only requires 69 mage though so you should easily be able to unlock it

Nah 1 ticking bones will always be faster, could definitely be faster than afk bones though. Ensouled heads aren't really worth doing with wildy altar in the game but they're a nice low APM method if you cba with constantly clicking.
---
We just perfectly described 10 year old me.

I mean 80% is a lot when you take it with the average human intelligance. If you put average IQ at 100 that means the bears would be ~80 which is the lower end of "normal". I think we'd be pretty fucked if not for modern technology.

It's more that with Swampletics you feel like you're exploring and discovering new things about the game. Like shit how many of you knew the haunted mine had such a weird drop table? Or the meta UIM construction method? Or how to beat the Haunted Mine in the most minimalist gear possible?

True, but endless questions are how they learn about the world. I think it‚Äôs really cool when you give a child a complicated answer and they glean enough information to ask a decent follow up.

No worries Runescape is here and is more XP efficient than taking a day off from the grind to spend on some sack of meat
---
It's simply a stupid argument to make. He's pointing out that there are different opinions in one community, duh, but implies that the same people hold both standpoints, wich isn't the case.

It's not that he did not "specifically" say what he quoted, he did not say it *at all*.

---
Why is the guthan's set dropping so hard?
---
There are 3 medium clues on the ground. Doing one step on each clue counts the same as doing 3 steps on one clue while juggling so you can potentially complete a clue scroll.
---
Or kourend teleport
---
Or fairy rings
---
And the farming patch
---
You don't have to watch my dude 
---
polling worked fine in early days of osrs because only veterans and people who actually cared about the game and game integrity played then.
---
Now we have an influx of "normie" players and mobile demographic and also rs3 players who doesn't comprehend putting game integrity before their own personal gain.
---
sad really
---
Was a little too lean for me, personally
---
You rebuild Burgh De Rott, makes sense that the general store might stock this one item as a special case so they don't get caught without a carpenter again.
---
Your posts are such a wonderful treat when they pop up, thank you! &lt;3
---
I would support removing run energy from non-pvp and non-boss content. There would need to be new uses for the Graceful gear added though. After it was removed, would there be enough reason to level agility with just shortcuts?
---
That actually fucked me up as a kid: "what do you mean you've sold out there are at least 20 on the table on display &gt;:("
---
These items already exist so can‚Äôt be redistributed.  They also take up inventory slots, which for low level is another barrier whilst learning.
---
Low level agility and running is widely regarded as a low level nightmare.  Higher levels have graceful.
---

Nice a black dagger drop.
---
What should I spent slayer points on? I‚Äôm 82 cmb using konar; already have slay helm &amp; superiors
---
This is a nice idea, and would pair well with a rework of alternative cooking methods such as baking pies and cakes, pizzas and stews. Currently, cooking those items is very tedious (has even been mentioned by the OSRS team in a recent Q&amp;A) and it would be nice to see some new methods like making apple pies from scratch in the cooking guild for profit (respawn rates on ingredients in the guild would have to be buffed significantly, or increase stock in the RFD food chest to help meet the demand). Higher tier foods should have higher restoration amounts per eat, particularly pies as they only have 2 bites per food.
---
There are also some alternative ideas for solving this problem, such as reducing run energy consumption when in a city structures (Varrock, Falador, Lumbridge, etc), and for the longest time players have wanted Agility levels to have an effect in F2P worlds, but this won't really help purely F2P players.
---
All these combined realistically should be enough to solve the run energy crisis, without making it as effective as stamina and energy potions and providing a very welcome low-level moneymaking method. The run energy restored per inventory slot shouldn't be (much) higher than a restore potion (40% per inventory slot), but not as low as 10% per cake otherwise it won't really be worth the trouble.
---
i don't know what it is, i even have better ping on world 357, which is an american server world then on european servers world... 
---
I mean, this probably took next to no dev time to write and has zero impact on normal players.
---
People don‚Äôt want changes which are heavily weighted to ironmen at the detriment of regular accounts, this doesn‚Äôt fit that description
---
I'd love to see more of these random questions.

Dhins is not meant to be a damage dealing weapon, it's a 2 handed defensive shield with small offensive capabilities.

I understand what you're saying here. But I want my fashion scape more than you want QoL month to make sense, please vote yes :( x 
---
I'm glad you blacked your runes, who knows which hackers might've been after you would you have shown them! (gz btw)
---
Also ppl voting yes when they can't even do tob/infernal
---
What is this post for, exactly?
---
I would have liked it better if he had grabbed the saw at the beginning of the series and had to carry it with him the entire time
---
Give it to a Venezuelan person to make irl money
---
Oh yes it was still a good implementation. But it's just food for thought. I'm almost positive we'll see something like Inferno (Concept wise) in OSRS in the future. Just takes time and community support. I guess theater of Blood is kind of close to what I am going at but it is a bunch of quests together and still not a 100% drop. Also can't do it alone.
---
OSRS and RS3 are not different conceptually because they have the same roots. Seeing as RS3 literally is RuneScape over time. But godamn I've never seen a single game change Soo much from where it started. 
---
To mock you
---
I've had the exact same issue! I'm also from Belgium.
---
Same here + from Belgium too... 
---
If they were to implement it it'd be nerfed into the ground rendering it useless. Are you mad they prevented you from abusing an OP new method in the time it'd take to nerf or are you mad that they actually went back on something they polled? 
---
WOOOOOO Im so happy they released the farming pet drop rates. I asked the question in almost every QnA thread since release (as did a lot of other ppl). 
---
Wowee!
---
Get him excited about runecrafting and you will get 99 painlessly!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true - maybe instead you get a certain number of uses and then it can be stored like the servants coin purse.
---
Quick question. And to be clear this isn't me saying I'm for the removal or keeping of the ditch so hopefully people don't get shitty. 
---
Am I imagining it or did 12 year old me read that the ditch was there due to Guthix slamming his sword into the ground when he awoke during the godwars? I'm going insane and I know I read it somewhere, I just need to know if it was correct.
---
Hopefully you can answer this for me &lt;3
---
Start farm runs ASAP to be able to do herb runs and sustain your bond. 
---
Dw I got him with the 64 gp in the top right inventory slot.

Mate, Jagex literally asked the (Reddit) community for ideas on what to re-poll in the [QoL Month Week 3: Re-runs](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apgnxz/qol_month_week_3_reruns/?sort=top) thread.  The most requested suggestion has over 1000 upvotes, almost double of the second suggestion. (Which also wasn't included, but I don't know if its been polled before. Probably not, so its fair. Actually, practically none of the top comments are included.) Not to mention it has been requested else where many times before.
---
I don't know, maybe I'm misinformed, but I thought that this was a community driven game where **we** decide what changes get implemented and which ones doesn't. Yet Jagex refuses to even acknowledge it. If they can't or won't do it, the least they should do is explain it. Same if they're planning to do it at a later moment.
---
&gt; sick of things happening because of the minority are so vocal about it
---
What even is this logic?
---
Nothing happens just because a vocal minority wants it. This is why things should get polled to get the opinion of the entire community, or at least those who bother to vote. 
---
nope, you start slayer when nieve, or konar now, is unlocked. I have done that on an other account and it is totally not "efficient" I had cannon too but anyone slaying should have a cannon
---
Jeez. Posted this as a meme didn‚Äôt expect people to get so defensive and hostile about it. Thought it would look hilarious running around with two giant fish. 
---
Missing the question about using roots on tangleroot to change its color/appearance (similar to mining pet).  
---
well, now i know i'm not the only one. Spoke with some osrs friends from other sides of europe (mainly sweden) and they had no problems, so it's maybe only close to Belgium? 
---
btw, world 357 gives me the best ping to play atm (even if it's an american server :p), maybe for you too? 
---
I don't get it? It's simply cosmetics. Would be a fool to buy them regardless. 
---
I changed my mind. Tradable keys means completely MASSIVE item dumps in to the G.E. No bueno
---
Thanks dude I appreciate it!  
---
Idk man I‚Äôve gone to 94 farming so far and there‚Äôs been some times I‚Äôve wanted to bank after planting 
---
I mean like is this really something worth sharing?
---
I don‚Äôt even have a Ironman and I‚Äôm pissed
---
&gt; But even so, is it so wrong of me to post this?
---
Yes, but before you get mad at that answer, hear me out.
---
Runescape is the name for both games, where R3 has a 3 on it's end and OSRS had Oldschool before it's name. Now, the first place I would search a forum like reddit for a subsection to post my achievements or ask questions as a new osrs player would be either find a subreddit called /r/oldschoolrunescape or /r/runescape. There's nothing in OSRS right now that actually gets you the idea of searching /r/2007scape except if a friend or maybe another forum post talk about it, but there is still people who actually take their time looking when doing a google search for "reddit runescape" and reads that the second one is dedicated to the oldschool runescape community. Those people who doesn't might end up at /r/runescape and as can be seen in [this \(old-but-kinda-new\)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/ah50vq/i_bought_iron_bars_from_the_grand_exchange_but/eebgzjw/) post, people are happy to answer their question but quickly mentions this subreddit. It's great that /r/runescape doesn't have any rules against OSRS posts, but the only content (Very quick search for new posts) that gets upvoted mentioning OSRS is posts pocking fun at it or posts with so called /r/cutenoobs. So even if they allow it, it's not a great community to share memes and achievements from your OSRS playthrough as you probably can expect a vocal minority over there also dislikes OSRS and will be quick to voice their opinions about it in new posts. That's why we have a dedicated subreddit which doesn't allow posts not related to OSRS, see rule #1. 
---
Now, I strayed of a bit from the original question, but to wrap up the answer to your question: 
---
Yes, it's wrong. People know about the 2 games, and will check it out if it intrigues them. This subreddit is dedicated to the OSRS community and people don't come here to compare OSRS and RS3. People come here for Swampletics or the PVM vs PVP fued. The cute noobs and people getting rare drops saying "grinds over" at 3 kc. And this wouldn't work with both games sharing the same subreddit as I, and probably some other, have mostly no idea about what drops are good or what it considered a cute noob over at RS3, because even though I have played it, I like spending my time on OSRS instead.
---
If you like both games, subscribe to both subreddits. If you see posts that picks on the other game, ignore it. Because if you enjoy it, what's the reason for getting upset about them. Your opinion isn't going to change just because some guy told you that RS3 is easyscape because you can just mine the same rock over and over or put a log in the same fire. What does it matter? If you liked both games you probably enjoyed standing still to a fire and putting logs in as much as you enjoyed having to run all the way back to your start of your long fire line to start lighting your new inventory of logs. You're on the internet, you need to start ignoring stuff like those posts because it doesn't effect you. It can't touch you. You can scroll past it without someone breaking into your home and beating you up. I mean come on man, you've got to stop obsessing over what people do on the internet and just enjoy the games you're playing.  
---
Just fyi: void mage is alot better than ahrims w/o torm
---
it gets even better. I punched the numbers and in the same time as before, he'll actually get *twice* the amount of xp
---
Honestly it just doesn't feel like RuneScape to me. It doesn't carry the same charm of simplicity. Instead, it's like another game entirely, like WoW or something except it's not as good or fluid because it's still limited by old engine constraints. So it's like the worst of both worlds.
---
Even without the issues surrounding it like MTX, I still wouldn't want to play it purely on the basis of gameplay. Also, the game just feels bloated, from the interface to the world map. I mean walking around feels like you're in a theme park, everything's so smushed together, completely immersion breaking.
---
I think what they should have done from the beginning is just make a new game from scratch. 
---
Do u have anything blocked or extended?
---
Eoc left a bad impression on me when it first came out. It felt like none of the abilities did anything. Except for that super attack that took 100% of your charge everything else was so in impactful I didnt care. Also regardless of how fun or less grindy rs3 is mtx is a complete deal breaker
---
JACKPOT
---
This is a screen picture
---
Did you watch the whole video? :)
---
But they acknowledge things they work on might not always pass.. This theory is idiotic.
---
Higher level members of the community (which generally include streamers) tend to have a much better understanding of how updates balance the game in the long term than players with less experience. It‚Äôs not always a terrible idea to pay attention to their thoughts. 
---
Honestly 30 hours is nothing in a game like rs...
---
Rs3 left behind it's roots as a casual rpg to try to compete in a market with much better purpose built games. Rs3's rushed conversion from a casual, slower game to a fast paced skill based game shows, and jumping ship like that chased away most of its long time players while its foundation ensured it wouldn't be able to compete with games built from the ground up.
---
Instead of excelling at what it was good at, rs3 is a poor example of a modern MMO. Rs3 is essentially the kid who ditches his real friends - the people who liked him for who he is - to reinvent himself as the cool popular kid, only to end up with no friends at all.
---
Nope
---
True. Population as a whole back then were a lot more nooby though for sure. Really lacked the widespread game knowledge we all have today.
---
Nop
---
Reddit isnt the community, not even half of osrs players are on reddit so YES it is the minority
---
The ding is back
---
I've got both of those requirements and I don't have a fucking clue for the 'health' of the game 
---
Konar, Krystilia is on a separate streak.
---
I've just not been playing. I called my ISP and they say it has nothing to do with them so I don't know. I hope this gets fixed soon. At least it's good to know that I'm not the onlyl one, just like you said.
---
Always look forward to a new Benjo post, even better with the *ding*! 
---
how about just dishing out 11$ once and making sure it doesn't happen again haha, when you get mems do you have enough go to buy a bond?
---
Use your credit card to purchase membership
---
Ask a parent to use their credit card to purchase membership
---
Cut the grass/Shovel the walk/Do the dishes and ask parents to pay for membership
---
Play the game and earn your membership
---
Good luck
---
He still plays daily so I doubt that‚Äôs why he left
---
The most common complaint is that he looks awful, and his nearly unobtainable gear is a dumb thing to show complete noobs. This doesn't really address that well. 
---
why use a shortcut when you have unlimited run? why bother having stamina pots if you have unlimited run? why bother unlocking different teleport methods if you have unlimited run? even rs3 still has run energy and that game is the epitome of the word ‚Äúezscape‚Äù.  
---
run energy gives you motivation to progress you account, which is the main goal of OSRS imo. also we shouldn‚Äôt be catering the game towards new players, or especially those of f2p which is basically an extended demo. 
---
Because im in between jobs and really poor..
---
And this is the only game I find fun anymore..
---
Until it became keys

[FilppingOldschool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIi4nY4YuOYUJEg8XLM0vQw/featured) has a lot of playlists with different challenges like F2P flipping to bond and 1 hour flipping challenges. He also has some tutorials if you ever want to start flipping yourself.
---
i know exactly how you feel. i'm in between jobs myself and i had the exact same problem. luckily my father plays osrs as well and he gifted me 3 months membership, that saved me.
---
What's you ign? lemma check your stats

Wish benjo could be my valentine 
---
Woven burnt shrimp
---
I had set a goal of gettinf all wilderness pets, had done vennenatis en chaos elemental, wanted to do vetion but with 300 ping i can't defend myself against pk'ers.. So i can't really play either.. Doing some woodcutting and playing apex in the hope it's getting fixed soon.. 
---
Stop trying to sell an app version of websites that already exist, you dick.
---
Ah yeah you did 
---
Thanks for making my start of the day betterüòÇ
---
Did you even read the text? Lol
---
How do you expect me to 'just play the game' with no bank? 
---
I already have a UiM account that I cant play cuz no memb, thanks tho
---
fishing for eels?
---
This image has been posted here so many times... stop
---
Actually in the current meta gp is worthless (through alts on mains and vorkath/slayer on irons), so unless the costs of this are enough to upset the meta, which they are not, this doesn't contribute to the efficiency.
---
You can high alch the keys for 48k if you don't want to gamble
---
Snoot Boop
---
The amount of high level players who don't want new updates simply don't want them because it "Devalues" their work, game is eventually going to stop progressing 
---
Then maybe it‚Äôs worth the hopefully one time purchase of $11 if this is the only game that gives you enjoyment.
---
Lmao why would u use guthan if u have a sgs...
---
go online and turn private on
---
That's a builder's shop for the shades of Morton minigame which doesn't require a saw. The shop predates construction but a good while, no reason for it to have a saw. 
---
Bulwark makes you able to tank anywhere in the single combat wilderness without problems I think it‚Äôs fine. 
---
Isnt this a repost
---
Your wish might come true ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
no but weaklings need their virtual ego points
---
Except other infinite stacks show up as dots and boxes never do.
---
I dunno I'm not 12 and retarded
---
I'm sure you have ore or logs and shit in your bank. Grab your cash stack you dweeb, buy some fucking items in the grand exchange and go kill some shit or collect some shit and sell it.
---
My god some peoples kids
---
Because I sell the SGS to buy other stuff. If I did a dragon task before and bought a DHCB or Lance, for example, I wouldn‚Äôt bother selling it just buy an sgs. I pretty much always have Guthans though.
---
Besides, Guthans is more reliable. If you miss or hit low with your SGS specs you‚Äôre sol. Guthans heals slower but doesn‚Äôt need to recharge.
---
:O
---
FWIW, this is a really fun concept. You don't by any chance stream or youtube?
---
...Mr. President?
---
If only spending 11 bucks on a video game was feasible at the moment.
---
I eat 1 meal of beans and rice and 1 egg a day at the moment so. Yea.
---
Could you put a swampletics spoiler tag next time because just 'spoiler' without any context is not helpful. I haven't even seen the new vid yet :'((((
---
The concept of democracy reeeeeeeeeee!!!
---
Imagine being upset about TWO exceptions to an otherwise awesome display of dedication and content creation.
---
Then I‚Äôm sorry but a video game should be the least of your concerns.
---
Don't reply to me retard
---
+1000x this. The excuses for not allowing reordering and resizing are just dumb. 
---
‚ÄúEz scape!!‚Äù ‚ÄúGet good!!!‚Äù 
---
This game will eventually die because too many people are afraid of change, and think navigating a terrible UI is a form of skill.
---
It's not used in pvm anywhere which is what it was designed for, it's damage reduction doesn't even work in the wildy
---
It's use as a welfare clue scrolling item I hardly think classes it as fine lol 
---
Awww
---
Thought I was the only one. Totally agree 
---
They've implemented a lot of things at NMZ that failed polls anyway, as game integrity updates.
---
I think run energy is important because it adds another layer of progression. I know I‚Äôm in the minority but I enjoy run energy in pretty much every game I play. It forces me to slow down and enjoy what is around me as well as add another layer to combat/exploration. 
---
I personally never use stamina potions, but it gives players who don‚Äôt enjoy the energy system the opportunity to circumvent it while adding to the in game economy. I feel like that is a win, win. I can definitely see how people see the mechanic as a way to artificially slow the game down.
---
I‚Äôll be happy when graceful will be more useful to splash, currently I feel like my set is useless to me atm. For new players I think simply giving them access to agility would solve a lot of problems they are facing.
---
Do you guys even know what QoL means at this point? 
---
No way, it would probably stay over a bil for ages, settling around 700, or a good price over Ely 
---
PKers: We don't want PVP to die
---
Also PKers: Improving basic UI functionality to lower barrier of entry? Fuck that
---
Which one of you baboons recorded a recording of the recording?
---
Oh really? From what I read it sounded as if the Ely would still be chosen over the divine unless in certain situations, so I thought it‚Äôd be less. Thanks :)
---
Maybe make it more fair ? 
---
Das raycis
---
He did, I almost wanted to record the recording of him recording the recording.
---
Try r/runescape
---
Looked like a dick spoon at first. 
---
Damn lol
---
At a random 2012ish price point I remember:
---
Ely: 300m , divine: 600m yellow phat:500mish
---
Divine was always more valued as guaranteed damage reduction is far more useful 
---
Whatever the community wants! Unless Jagex think they know better. This system is a joke.
---
So you agree that it‚Äôs good to keep methods for only high end players. Good! 
---
Yeah... that's his point.
---
Even chaeldar?
---
I hate to be like this but the food you are claiming to eat is not at all good for your mental health and will cause greater harm than your ability to play runescape. Seriously, feed yourself.
---
I know it is, and it makes me puke 
---
Well, I guess it was worth more than 100gp then. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Mom said it's my turn on the repost!
---
Felt this in my heart
---
I will also add it probably isn't necessary to waste arclight on demons. Whip will do just fine. Of course if you have an abundance of charges on it then go ahead :)
---
you're missing the cost of 100gp per bucket of sand
---
Best cliff hanger since end of breaking bad season 3
---
I just sent it to you. Thank you for the quick response, much appreciated. 
---
It's basically a non degradable tent (rapier is a little better) and decent alternative to the lance. 
---
And have no option to fight back? So what? Bulwark protecting a few people doing clues or prayer (won't even have inventory of food there) from brainlets in mystic camping ice barrage is hardly a balance point 
---
Anyone guessed where the hunter xp comes from ?
---
Currently when you teleport in your poh while being inside your poh you have to reload the house for a few seconds. Can you either just cancel the teleport, or move the player to portal without the loading screen? its bothersome.
---
relatively speaking yes. Streams and streams of bots worse than before imo. Back then bots and random events drove people away before the wildy changes, im thinking worse than that. Mobs of resource specific rwt accounts are not getting taken out, as before, but with a potentially larger group.
---
You playing on a private server bro?
---
Consider yourself lucky. I got mine at 3000kc
---
That's just Gray-t
---
Because you could get 1080 crafting xp per cast of super glassmake if you filled your inventory with the large sandstones + giant seaweed. Reason being is that currently there is no xp limit on how much you can get per super glassmake, giving xp rates anywhere from 750k-1000k/hour.
---
Jagex could just put a cap on that shit, but that probably requires engine work. /s
---
Been away a while, is there a better method of collecting sand now or is it only being polled?
---
Fish don't have hands, they can't be left handed.
---
Smack him back
---
Kharyll is essential imo. Close to bank with access to slayer tower. Ironmen can do barrows through this teleport before 83 magic/hard diary. It‚Äôs also close to a fairy ring. It unlocks myre fungus money making method.
---
Lunar isle if you‚Äôll be using lunar spellbook for anything. That is my main reason. It‚Äôs also quick access for a hard clue. Not sure what else it could be used for honestly, maybe runecrafting?
---
I personally like to use Kourend for the quick access to catacombs. (With altar in POH this makes banking for relevant tasks nearly obsolete).
---
I smell catering 
---
I also have found that insulting people is the best way to prove I have the superior opinion. Good on you for showing off your outstanding argument!

i heard he was an obby mauler

M8 most RS players havent even touched a woman and are full blown autists, and if a few broke that mold the last thing in the world they would want is children

You can still make an altar at 50 con
---
well my little man got hard within 10 seconds so I can see why it would be so popular.
---
Wait its Valentine day?

Like bootstrapping a compiler
---
Lmao once I had a dude hop to my world insult me on all me gear, call me several names then be mad when I wouldn‚Äôt talk to him
---
Ever drank Bailey's from a shoe?
---
Divine was always higher price straight from like 2008 when gear was worse than what osrs has.
---
You can use both prayer and divine ... People just take more ppots 
---
Its also a good pking /range tank item
---
Make an ironman so you don't need to care about prices
---
i love how you they ask ‚Äúwhy cant he scratch you?‚Äù and you say ‚Äúbecause im‚Äù then pause because you were about to safespotting. hahaha I love it
---
Rip account didn't hide run energy
---
Imo the equippable fishing rods would look better if they were based on their regular counterparts, like a more simple brown fishing rod 
---
Yes I know but I meant you can ONLY restore prayer, not spec, stats and hp. In that case you may opt to chose to go to clan wars instead
---
Rune
---
who ever had the balls to say we shouldnt let the poll pass in its current state is the real mvm
---
Oversights due to how the content is made, he's absolutely right, a building store should have a saw, there's no reason for it not to, other than the store being older than construction and not being updated with the new item when construction came out, because who actually cares about a random store in morytania that's only useful for shades of mortton?  
---
That's like dictionary definition oversight
---
I'd first need a girl.
---
This made me cry
---
It will still be free mining xp, even if it's the same speed as yanille sand it will be very worth doing. You shouldn't expect an afk AND faster method/more efficient method. This updates offers an alternative method, if you don't like doing it, that's okay, not all content has to be so op that everyone wants to do it. 
---
What? The community was furious at tonnes of major content releases between the wilderness revamp and EOC. 
---
I would totally watch this. 
---
So what? They‚Äôre an extra mostly useless item dropped by enemies. You can get a slay helm recolour or show them off in your house, but other than that what do you want for them? Now if people have tons they can get some small use out of sacrificing them, but the point isn‚Äôt to have any sort of meaningful reward from then.
---
Why does everything have to have an op use?
---
I gave up my hope of ever seeing a Twisted Bow drop at Raids 1 after 420kc, the last 120kc only getting a buckler in my name. On to Theatre of Blood.

---
Hello my Finnish boy. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôm at a point now there I would happily pay 25k for a sand pack from a shop (250gp each bucket) 
---
Lmao did anyone else notice they put Swampletics in the picture at the top
---
Every. Tekton. Ever.
---
I ain't finished yet
---
Listen, don't let this amazing picture of swampletics distract you from the god damn shit tier update and the dismissal of voted upon content
---
Feels like April 1st
---
I'll just keep my heads thanks though 
---
Quality update 
---
Fix mining and smithing like they did in RS3
---
That‚Äôs some serious progress for 100 days, nicely done. 
---
it may have been before people got good computers so the 3rd picture where water is flowing may lag a bit at people.

Why did you build fireplaces with 15 cons when you could have built decorative rocks to garden with 5 cons?

---
Chances are if you have a bulk supply of vorkath heads either the prayer xp offered is so negligible and also you would have favour given arceeus is one of the fastest to get 
---
Thanks, this is a very helpful comment. Would you also unlock boss tasks or just do boss variants of normal ones!
---
After recently maxing karma on my main Reddit account
---
If you ignore the mining xp received, why does everyone forget about the mining xp? People need to understand the big picture of how much more macro efficient the new method still is. 
---
That‚Äôs the assembler max cape. Which removes everything from the max cape except the assembler effect. If a range cape can get the affect, the standard max cape should be able to. 
---
We need to build a barrier. 
---
Unfortunately there is a large portion of the pvp community that will vote against anything that changes the way pvp works, even to the detriment of the rest of the game. 
---
It is unfortunate and ironic, quite honestly. Many pkers wish for the pking scene to grow, yet they push hardest against the changes that would make pking more accessible.
---
The teleport is useful for clue scrolls, so I did it ages ago anyways.
---
1m isn't a lot.
---
Series went to shit after blue cape tbh.
---
Solid point for an item that has no use except for bank space because people don't want to just drop it.
---
Not sure why people complain about this.
---
Holy what. I'd this possible with ranger boots?
---
REEEEEEEEpost
---
Secretly they carry their bank pin in runes so they don't forget.
---
Thanks for that! I feel like if my gf rolls her eyes anymore when she‚Äôs sees me on mobile, they‚Äôll be likely to pop out of her head lol. 
---
Yes, I've seen someone get triple boots before and I've seen multiple double boots!
---
big brain gamer
---
apparently if it went the way they proposed you could get up to 1.3 million crafting exp/hour which of course isn't remotely acceptable so they're finding a way to work around it.
---
not sure if it's true but a lot of people are saying it so yeeeee
---
That's why my original comment was " Meet swampletics, my Morytania-locked-when-I-say-so ironman", cause that's what it is. I'm replying to you "ad nauseum" because you've yet to understand me up until now. 
---
Your expectation of the Mory building shop to have construction essentials is misguided. If anything they should change the name, not add a saw. It's a shop specifically dedicated to Shades of Mort'ton, why would it have construction supplies?
---
I was wondering when this post would go this direction LOL
---
grats on long bone
---
Wooooosh
---
Good for mid level players, what it was intended for.
---
The integrity is already spoilt. You have a vast majority of hardcore pvpers using pvp clients like exelint or whatever to move their prayers and spells and even autopray for them. The people against this change for the total game are the people abusing it against people with no means to use it back. If they want to change the spellbook/prayers, they should either do it for the entire game or not at all.
---
It is an absolutely fucking horrible compromise. If you grind 1k raids in cox or tob or an inferno cape and switch your prayers and spells all around and get accustom to their locations, now you suddenly can‚Äôt go into pvp and pvp with the same familiarity that you would pvm with. Now your icons are all switched up and you are at an even greater disadvantage in a pvp scenario, this update only works to further the gap between those who pvp and those who don‚Äôt. 
---
see you there mate :/
---
haha what r u talking about i love qol \^.\^
---
You get more exp from the base bones vorkath drops than it's head as a 1/50 drop.....
---
One could argue that the "special snowflakes" in this scenario are the pvp players, for insisting that their established skills not be interfered with by a UI improvement.
---
reported bro, rule 5. GF ACCOUNT!
---
1k prayer lmao.. I'm almost 400 kc and have gone last 200 kills dry of another head! 
---
Possibly (I don't know what you mean D:)
---
Doesn't change the fact that these numbers are a joke
---
Nex would be better for the game than raids and zulrah.
---
First post on the Sub btw, having trouble flairing my post tho? got tagged by the bot but when i try to add a flair no options come up.   
---
 what's up with that? 
---
this is so cute omg i wish i had kids 
---
It's going to be interesting seeing how people vote on the Divine.
---
It's hardly better than the Ely if it is even actually better at all. Plus people don't care about defense. A DFS gives defense bonus and +7 strength.
---
üéµTurn it off. Like a light switch!üéµ

üéµJust go click! It's a neat little Mormon trick.üéµ

Yeah I'd stay there a bit longer, at least until you unlock elite void 
---
I didn't know about the girlfriend. Could you elaborate?

Nice, can you move or nah?

Cool, thankyou. Not sure why it says that much. Might have too cancel it before it runs out because I only took the free trial 
---
Having the same issue, no word of jamflex on it yet though :/ Tried it on the official client but it has the same issue.
---
I want more!!!!!!!!!
---
I think a JMOD was payed by a bot maker to have that spawn there as a moneymaker

And? Divine would also cost 100‚Äôs of millions, Dinh‚Äôs is like 8m.

That‚Äôs crazy it‚Äôs 16 for a new account

You‚Äôre into some weird shit my dude.

On nvidia it is a setting you can turn on when pressing the default buttons alt+z.

I think you need nvidia geforce installed and overlay turned on.

No you can't, Windows Mousekeys are allowed.

"Historically, we have not given bans for some usage of programmable mouse keys (such as AutoHotKey). If players kept their usage of such software to an acceptable standard, we would not take action against them. This is no longer the case.

You may now only use your operating system's official default mouse keys program, unless it is to remap a key to any other button."

That's from the 2007scape newspost about AHK. You can use WMK and you can use AHK to rebind keys.

Lets say there's 1 million primordial crystals, 20 million dragon boots, 1 million pegasian crystals, and 250k ranger boots. Not real numbers but it gets the point across.
---
Every primordial crystal can be used to upgrade dragon boots with plenty of d boots to spare, but there will be plenty of pegasian crystals leftover from upgrading every single pair of ranger boots (which isn't the case in-game, some accounts want to keep rangers instead of pegasian). Since there's no other use for pegasian crystals, they end up being worthless since upgrading the boots aren't limited by them.

speaking of game integrity, hiding poll results is good for game integrity

Consistent in the sense it's a boss head and *should* give xp due to this update. It's far more common than any other boss head, so they lowered the xp per head. 
---
OMG look at that sweet 45xp!! Man at this rate I'm only 78 years away from level 5 when I can finally start the good content. Fletching shoetbows!
---
They should make you use a hammer on the sandstone to crush it into buckets. No more running to sand pit and gives a reason to collect sandstone.
---
Support if drops are unnoted.
---
Get over it man, if that's your reasons for quitting you're playing for the wrong reasons, play it for fun that's what games are for. 
---
He's on the west dock of rimmington now
---
Yep
---
YES! Been wanting this since /u/tizaki made that [suggestion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9j5f5l/ingame_wiki_lookup_orb_tool_here_you_go_mod_sween/). Good job Wiki and Runelite team!!
---
when did you finish crying
---
Dock is now in Rimmington (as per update).
---
1 Superior Dragon bone gives an average of 1050xp at the chaos alter. 
---
Or the painting doesn‚Äôt pan out as far as your screen...?
---
Hello, we are aware of the issue and are working on fixing it, sorry for the inconvenience, you'll hopefully be able to get through tutorial island soon :)!
---
dude just kill the tree spirit in the enchanted valley

you can safespot them and they drop all axes. (mith and addy quite commonly)
---
"sweetie come watch Daddy play! It's almost been a week since my last video and the community needs content!"

---
Its afk and not as draining as 8 hours of real work. 
---
Is your OSRS name really Dave?
---
Your not grinding Vorkath for the specific reason of the heads lmao üò≠ it‚Äôs a addition to a big drop table that pushes more additional player value towards a drop that‚Äôs just dropped every time after the first time you get it. Not to mention the addition of adding the head to the skill cape???? Like the previous comment stated, not every update has to be a game breaking meta that‚Äôs gonna power to to lvl 99 in minutes.
---
I'm gonna disagree on you with this fam... Robin Williams FTW
---
hey this isn't swampletics
---
No
---
Or just change the name slightly, like ranging cape (t)(v) 
---
The increase in click intensivity and steps to get sand just no go, and specially that cost.
---
If it was Easy like Sit at Sandstone, mine and deposit it then collect Bucket of Sand Notes, I'd be okay with that, no insane cost.
---
As soon as someone makes a video about making a goodwill bot, they ban straight away to appear as they care about the integrity of the game.  
---
*Nice*
---
Ending reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/l3cj9Kcbvyc?t=2m10s)
---
It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs their game, and at the end of the day if they think they polled something that would hurt the integrity of their game then they change their minds...
---
You may now ONLY use your OPERATING SYSTEMS official default keys program, UNLESS it is to remap a key to any button. 
---
That mean you can use AHK to remap any key to any button, not that you cant use WMK to rebind keys (I don't think WMK offers that functionality)
---
Watch your fucking language, there are kids here.
---
I strongly disagree, and encourage you to think critically and contribute something of substance to this post. I for one would not want that, and in fact swapped to an ironman account to escape some of these easy gratifications . HOWEVER, I do not find filling up 100k buckets intuitive, there is so much content to this game, and hoping worlds to get compete with other players in shops is NOT INTUITIVE. and if you really enjoyed the content you are free to continue doing so.
---
Actually much less than that part of the entire community said ‚ÄúYES‚Äù... some said ‚ÄúSkip question‚Äù
---
Yes
---
It's the shitmare, Randy, the shitmare. 
---
I had a runelite plug in with HP and prayer bars near the inventory and my 4 year old keeps track of when I need to eat another shark. 
---
Pretty sure you have to meet the requirements for duradel for your partner to get a task for both of y‚Äôall. 
---
Feel ya ! 
---
not related to this video, but how were you able to get a rake on karamja?
---
Maybe they should‚Äôve seen if the update really would‚Äôve gone through. They didn‚Äôt have to go mine sandstone early because if they think that the mechanic that they wanted so bad isn‚Äôt OP, it‚Äôs not going to be nerfed anytime soon. People mining beforehand just shows that they know it‚Äôs OP, but wanna abuse it while they can.
---
nope
---
One of the few things OSBuddy had that Runelite didn‚Äôt; very welcome addition 
---
I see people say NMZ should be removed as game integrity somewhat often, but I think there's actually an argument that it has to stay for game integrity.
---
NMZ, one of the best, if not the best way to train combats has been in the game for 5.5 years already. Removing it puts a barrier between accounts from before nmz and accounts after. High combat content is now harder to access for newer accounts, further increasing the income gap between newer and older players.
---
It's too late. Too much of the community got maxed training in NMZ for it to be fair for them to remove it, imo.
---
I know it will be removed or nerfed eventually, because "pulling the ladder up" updates always get voted eventually as more people complete the content and want to lock others out, but this is how I feel about it. Thousands of NMZ prods on reddit talking about how slayer and sandcrabs is good enough.
---
na man watch his old videos on his regular uim, he would casually condense 200 hours of playtime of pest control into one video like it was normal. This was without subscribers.
---
Shit thing is, we can't change our emails, we can't improve our account security because Jagex will accept Old Passwords and easily in many cases Gleamable information from database breaches, ISP, IP, info etc. We can protect our Emails and Payment info, Transaction ID's, but thats about it I don't know how much confidence I have in the current system that those are enough to give ample protection if someone decided to truely go after you.
---
What's there to talk about?
---
Polls over and it passed. 
---
We as in pvpers or people who don't pvp?
---
You miss the point. When the former takes 810 times longer than the latter, it is like comparing apples to oranges. You need to look at probabilities of action of the same duration to get a fair comparison.
---
A surprise to be sure..
---
Did you atleast get your double xp or free gold?? Lol
---
N‚Äôawwww
---
Try some stuff out on the calculator and fill us in on what you find
---
It's just some minions, there is no real battles like in 3rd age
---
Twiggy is a bigger eyesore than Hatius.  CMV.  
---
Also, I was totally against sandstone passing.... but it fucking passed.  If you're going to retroactively change polls then you either need to change the pass % or think a little harder on what you're going to poll.  Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Wtf dude that's fatphobic as hell. And ableist to boot!
---
Nah, I slayer partnered with my main who meets the requirements to get tasks on the level 18 account, already done 10 tasks through Duradel on it. I just got aviansie -task on main which I'm going to do later so I don't want to skip it. :(
---
agreed this PvP exclusion changes needs to stop, its ridiculous and makes the barrier for entry into the game more convoluted and confusing for new and current players.
---
Also makes going into the wilderness even more difficult as may adapt to using what would be QoL changes to your prayer book, moving prayers around to better suit your playstyle.
---
And Avid PK'rs would beable to react much faster then someone who doesn't spend alot of time and their entire interface gets screwed up every time they enter a PvP area.
---
I'd rather make extra assemblers to throw away at things like wilderness bosses
---
True, but guy with untrimmed 99 rc I saw in abyss was 100% a bot
---
At the end of the day to give a game away for free they need something to off set the development cost. And with how successful it seems to be since launch, I doubt server costs was ever looked at for the massive influx of players from the get go. I can't comment as only just picked this up but it doesn't at all seem like you can't own both 'locked' legends by level 50+ which then negates the need to ever worry about having enough as you already own content that matters.
---
Your computer always speaks to you in binary
---
Gotee
---
well the majority voted for it on the official polls. so if say you are wrong
---
Na seed, it‚Äôs either watch tower or clock tower quest for the ones near caste wars 
---
Do whichever quest and then just kill use ring of dueling to bank and go back 
---
So runelite can copy/paste good plugins from it
---
I am not okay. I pray to God, to Allah, to Buddha, to anyone, to please look over the evidence, I did not say I was a moderator, please God help me, fuck I hate my lie soo fucking much please god. 
---
I understand it's for the mini game, but it should have been updated at the release of construction. 
---
Wowee

This post gave me RS3 cancer
---
The animation would just hide the offhand item, just like if you went fishing with a shield.  It doesn't show a dragonfire shield when you're fishing.

i heard its more efficient xp and point wise later on, i dont need a helmet imbued right now anyway  
---
Hey! I'm talking with the service provider that we are using (Im fairly sure we are all using the same and its on their end, at least thats what everyone is telling me)  
---
There is a guy coming to my house soon to come check it out, I'll keep you up to date.   
---
(Also I came from rs3, same issue there)
---
Anyone knows why the online xp tracker from Runelite doesn't work anymore? Used to check it quite often.. really missing it
---
Jagex added a little known method to collecting sand back in 2006 which you may not have heard of...
---
What you do is go to Yanille with an inventory of buckets and near the house portal (which you can conveniently teleport to) you can harvest from a bottomless sandpit. 
---
The sand never just runs out! Trust me, I've tried to get to the bottom of it. Anyway, hope this helps.
---
1 super combat, spectral + hasta for the switch, like 4-6 super restores ou prayer potions, cons cape or 2 taverley tps that you switch back to House Teleport after you reach taverley rest food. I usually take a sip of stamina + anti poison when I bank so I can run there without a problem and the antipoison is for the spiders that can poison you when they attack you. Think that's what I usually run haven't done cerb in awhile haha
---
It would appear you are a shitface
---
Less streamers, more Benjo.

Yeah I'm going to call bait

I changed my name to bot513554523 for a good 6 months or so when I was on a skilling grind. It was so funny seeing how triggered people got and how many said reported. 
---
Yeah nah William's genie is the real genie. Lamp genie is gunna have to take the back seat on this one chief. 
---
I genuinely thought that was supposed to be a picture of Torvesta lol 
---
I lowkey enjoy these as much as Settled videos.
---
If it‚Äôs the masses that want it, why shouldn‚Äôt that be the way? Why should a game cater to a small percent of stale players who are somewhere on the spectrum, jobless and have a free 17 hours a day to do the same shit over and over and over again all day long while their parents spoon feed them day in and out.
---
it hurts bots who buy stuff like that and sell on g.e., more competition REEEE
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way they could have limited the amount of glass made, or make a certain sandstone block be usable like 1kg, breakdown the 5s and 10s into 1s before use or whatever, instead of creating an even worse method overall, I‚Äôve never used Glass make, so it‚Äôs not a bother to me, but it seems 100gp plus bucket plus time for a bucket of sand isn‚Äôt ideal as an alternative to stores, yeah they were right to stop a method that devalues 99 crafting, but to kill it and replace it with a worse method isn‚Äôt the way forward. 
---
lol nice blurring out your name in the screenshot but use the same udername name on reddit. Nice magic level bro!
---
Probably because there is a public Twitter chain involving Mod Ash proving the actual origin. Someone asked him to put one there awhile back.
---
Ahh. That's the easiest/best explanation so far. Thank ya :P.
---
Im not sure why in my head i was thinking the rarity of pegasion was actually =/= with rangers itself..which, they clearly arent lol. Then you consider the rarity of d boots to primordial, and theres the answer. 
---
Damn. I feel dumb for letting that slip by my brain lol. Im still fairly new to the game, seeing how a ton has changed since 07 and not to mention its been 12 years since 07 anyway :D (ive kept up watching some videos tho and even lurking these forums for a while, i probably debated for a year whether or not id make an account to play again or not)
---
Swamp made me create a iron man..
---
If the problem is on their end and you could let them know alot of people are experiencing the same issue that would be appreciated :P
---
Seems inconsistent if it doesn't work for antidote+ and super antifire
---
Foetuses certainly aren‚Äôt relevant then
---
But i havent even played in like 2 years.
---
Jagex catering to streamers once again while the regular player is left behind. A big yikkes from me. Ubsub, disliked and downvoted!

If you're really keen on doing the task I would highly recommend you do it with magic and not range and melee. Canceling a task does not kill your streak though

---
I'll add you! Add Airo in return, I'll message whenever I'm on.

All he did was angle his friend slightly on a wall in order to cut trees, he then proceeded to teach him he gave up on the game already. According to the title anyways.

No it means nothing will be implemented and then they'll just repoll it 6 months later under the banner "Re-runs 2.0" until it passes.

Not many other updates fail, look at any poll and youll struggle to find more than 2 or 3 failed questions that arent related to the wilderness in some fashion

That long bone right at the end lol. I bet that was your breaking point, wasn't it?

Is the hydra tail going to be updated or are we waiting for it to stay dead content and like 5 more years before polling something?

---
Are you able to bgs spec on every kill?
---
Because people want their ezscape and instant gratification despite the fact they‚Äôre playing an MMO
---
I'm not a pker, so if someone could explain, that would be helpful. Why is this not good for pvp? Seems like it would be a good defensive item to counter act the abundance of hard hitting spec weapons. The risk/reward is pretty high due to being smited along with the prayer drain making you able to lose it easily.
---
Soooooo Zed's Dead? Aaaaaye
---
the related picture changes based on your Google history. wikia is your first link for waterskin I'd bet.
---
It's not that is can be abused 'more easily', it's that for an actual price tracker to be implemented then Adam will be required to start collecting user information, which he is adamantly against doing so.
---
Or if you're a real wiz you can ctrl+x, ctrl+v so osb loses all its plugins 
---
Should be 10-15k exp per head IMO. Pointless to use them as is, doesnt impact anything I'd rather leave them in the bank in case of a future update.

Am I seeing this correct? 3 pets and an ely in 600 kills??? What is the pet drop rate anyways?
---
YES DING IS BACK AFTER SO MANY POSTS
---
Oh God that episode 
---
Its good to get in the habit of investing in supplies whenever you get a big drop like that. Spend like 1-2m on sharks and potions just to make sure you won‚Äôt run out any time soon
---
Dragon slayer 2 got done I see
---
Spot on, its the high level community that has worked through the game, sometimes on multiple accounts and they know from experience (in some cases 10's of thousands of hours of experience). 
---
What you're saying is 99 cooking == 99 Runecraft?
---
How is this possible? Cannon dragons? 
---
Ask for a +2 construction boost
---
The games been out for 5 years. Even playing casually you should be max or at least close to max in that time.
---
Which month is the 14th?
---
Reminder: slower doesnt equal harder/more of an achievement 
---
This has probably been asked a lot, but here goes.
---
Any tips for starting out? I downloaded the mobile app for nostalgia, and I'm kind of at a loss for where to actually start progressing (normal account, members)
---
No it shouldn't, that devalues the max cape.  And jagex said we had to choose between defensive or offensive for 99 capes, cant have both.  I just want to be able to tell the difference.
---
Blowpipe will be leagues ahead of anything else for crabs. But ignoring that because of the insane cost associated with it, you could give yourself a huge boost in dps by just upgrading to rune arrows. It's only another 70ish gp per arrow and you'll be increasing your dps by a good 30% or so.
---
For some exact numbers, you can always check out the [DPS Calculator by Bitterkoekje](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8)
---
Yes, putting months before days makes sense!
---
Fire Bolt + chaos gauntlets, slow n steady
---
Mr runelite dev when are you removing the demonic gorilla plugin? And will you remove the prayer reordering too if it doesn't pass the poll?
---
Greencape stoopid. Redcape the best cape, red match stabby stab color.
---
I'm not sure I want kids anymore
---
Primordial boots and amulet of torture. The two big upgrades to get starting into higher level slayer. Then you can start diversifying your other gear
---
I feel like all pets are rare enough for a congrats.  Congrats you lucky bastard.
---
This is from the YouTube series by Settled : Swampletics.  It‚Äôs relevance is in the most recent episode that was released yesterday.

---
Don't speak for the PvP community 
---
I'm confused, are you trying to say jmods are helping him cheat or something, because even if it's true, I doubt people care because the magnitude of cheating is so small.
---
 Yes but I think I tweeted this before the prismatic lamps and all of the crazy promotions to get tons of XP were a thing. You could still get the normal XP lamps but it wasn't as P2W as it eventually would be. I think this was maybe months before things started to really go downhill as far as P2W goes.
---
Actually, OS Buddy had it first. Plug ins don't have issues like runelite. You get what you pay for.
---
It's more than 2k an hour lol

I did it before the guide but same method as his

---
Haha theres a guy on YouTube that had a great guide for afking for 20 minutes at a time. And then accessing your computer from chrome remote desktop to drink a couple absorptions and use locator orb to get back to 1 hp. It's amazing
---
It should still be 2.5k, just because it‚Äôs more common shouldn‚Äôt affect that. It‚Äôs still a boss and they‚Äôre still rare enough that you‚Äôre only likely to get that 2.5k prayer xp every couple hours. Big deal.
---
What hahaha 
---
they didnt clearly say
---
Pures does mean 1 defense. All of the other builds and pures with extra conditions. Notice when people say ‚Äúpures‚Äù they think of 1 def pures. But in order to talk about any other build they add a prefix ‚Äúinitiate pure‚Äù, ‚Äúrune pure‚Äù, etc. But not for zerks, voiders, or dh builds. 
---
Literally same though lmao, mostly probabilities 
---
You'd have to use your own supply for these contract, your not "given" the supply for free. It would work the same way for the exp part. The only difference, it would bring more variety, more gameplay. 
---
And for the reward, cosmetic only rewards.

Thanks for support
---
I assumed you knew that players can attack you while you're in the wilderness.
---
It saves you from running to the bank to restock on food which is xp waste. The difference is noticeable. Especially when a 1 defense pure is getting hit by four different crabs multiple times
---
Yeah, it's like saying you've walked for 24 minutes, 20 seconds and 2 hours. Great format.
---
If you mention a date while speaking to someone your format might make sense, but not when you write it down.
---
Ima vote skip because im not too familiar with that aspect of the gameplay since i always play pure accounts  and do not want to vote on something that i know nothing about.

I believe we have more evidence of the debauchery Jagex is capable of than we have evidence of them performing well outside of polling constraints.

Wow a whole extra 10k prayer xp for 20 hours of Vorkath? The boss that drops superior dragon bones every kill? Yeah still not worth it.

the core problem runescape is currently facing is trying to cater casual players by making things easier and easier and oh boy do you guys just love it
---
Yew got to be kidding me
---
Runescape is a game where virtually nothing is difficult so the things that take longer are the more impressive achievements. You're free to not think so but the notion that we should be balancing the game on difficulty and not time is retarded. Time is the relevant factor here.

I would be hard pressed to remove the prayer reordering while OSB still has theirs, which also works in PvP. I wouldn't mind mutually agreeing with them to either remove it or disabling it in PvP, but we've never done anything like that before.
---
I don't see the gorilla plugin as OP. I have been trying to draw the "line" at bossing plugins and I don't think demonics are bosses. If enough people really wanted it removed I guess I don't really mind but I do not have a good way to measure what users want.
---
depends if it is polled or not lol
---
It is but taking it from a retarded amount of time, to a less but still retarded amount of time is fine. Inb4 slippery slope nonsense. You want this game to stay alive? Things are gonna change. Deal with it and elarn that noone cares about your skillcape but yourself.
---
What's the advantage of an ornate pool?   
---
Currently doing barrows and the instant refresh at clan wars + Barrows teletab make this a million times easier than when I used to do it =P
---
But it's part of getting crafting xp afterwards, so speeding it up drastically also increases crafting training drastically. 
---
This aint rocket science.
---
im already feeling nostalgic seeing this

Someone accused me of botting at Motherload mine because I replied to what he said super late, but it was because I was on mobile with the chat closed.

Runelite is awesome

---
Can tell you‚Äôve been cheated on. Who hurt you? 
---
Berserkers, Voiders, Dhers, are all pure builds that focus one main aspect for the account. The only reason they aren't referred to commonly as pures is because they are able to add "er" to the end of their equipment and it actually flows properly.
---
Also, plenty of people call them 1 def pures, as well as 13 def pures, etc. The main thing is they actually differentiate between all of the different builds even further than just focusing on one's defence level as well.
---
Love the update. But please could we get the GPU plugin working for Mac? 
---
Better hide those results 
---
This is correct. We actually plan on displaying a history of GE trades on the website in the future, and this will involve us tracking GE trades of users, but I do not plan on aggregating them or publishing them.
---
I suppose that makes sense, I didn‚Äôt even think about pures 
---
How is manipulation not a bigger problem right now with only a small portion of the userbase still using OSBuddy?
---
Primordial crystal should be able to be fused with each piece of dragon gear, giving STR boosts to all pieces. How about that?
---
Some people also use ranged cape at DK's on the lazy setup :))
---
yea the worlds are now being routed through toyko :/

Its op in pvp but so is ely. However divine is even more op. Impossible to die with divine if u pray mage and spam sip brews.

Jagex really just needs to implement more mechanics on bosses where players are forced to take damage and are unable to do damage. This would make all defensive gear way more useful

I was referring to his reply of telling people they need better jobs to afford an expendable two dollars a month. Like that was the actual reason people don't use OSB. I don't care what you support.

I just don't get why the method had to changed completely. Like, if it's too OP that a 10 KG sandstone block is worth 18 sand, nerf it to 12 or 9 or whatever the "balance" team thinks is appropriate. What's with completely reinventing the wheel instead of just tweaking the numbers?
---

You need to get Jagex to request its removal, then. They will comply, but OSB shouldn't have it when Runelite does not. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait till 2310 when you‚Äôre done and can finally play the game!
---
Every day we stray further...
---
They did address this yesterday. The sand update became bigger than expected. It was meant to be Small change, but now it has expanded a lot.
---
I really don't mind these changes, since I have always disagreed with people who call it "waste of developement time". Its the devs who choose if something is worth the dev time or not and it shouldnt be used as an argument to not do something.
---
Just full blessed d‚Äôhide, archers ring if you have one, anguish, or fury, or glory depending on your budget, a blessing and blowpipe with addy darts. With your ranged level you should shred the caves. If you aren‚Äôt a pure, getting 70 defense will help because as a noob you can take verac‚Äôs helm and skirt to take less damage from the range guys. But you should be perfectly fine as long as you follow a guide.
---
I feel there should be a minimum wait time based on how much it failed by such as
---
74% vote yes - 2 month min wait time
---
70% vote yes - 6 month min wait time
---
65% or below - 1 year min wait time
---
Because 1K so absolutely inconsequential for an item that takes a decent amount of time to obtain.
---
While it‚Äôs true that the altar has no requirement, most accounts with DS2 completed won‚Äôt need to worry about favor anyway. The ones that do probably won‚Äôt sacrifice their head stack for barely any exp just for the novelty of counting heads.
---
The fact that a farmable monster drops a head at more than double the rate of Vorkath and said head gives 50% more exp is just outright insulting.
---
Even if you‚Äôre killing 30 Vorkath an hour (which is a crazy rate) you‚Äôll be getting around 600 prayer exp an hour. It‚Äôs just so genuinely worthless that I question why they‚Äôd even add this, even with the existence of ensouled dragon heads and the fact that an already existing method is 50% more effective.

---
This update would have been specifically for ironmen and maybe rich mains who wanted 1k xp drops and had a ton of cash to spend. 
---
Wasted potential if they did that tbh.
---
I think it could be a good alternative to summoning that could train the skill itself and then when mounting creatures you get agility exp as well as Beast Handling exp.

Now if someone said they're pure and they're clearly a main, that's when I call bs. Surprising how often that happens too.

I came back after seeing a mobile advertisement, hadn't played since 08 so i figured i'd give it a shot. My account after 2 months of playing is better than my account that I started in 03 (93cb, 1357 total lvl). Really makes me wonder what I was doing while I was playing back in the day.

Getting crashed isn't toxicity. Also what you said isn't true in the first place. Most of the high level pvm is instanced. The main thing that gets crashed are slayer bosses/wildy bosses. 
---
Toxicity is telling someone to fuck off if they ask you to hop, or INTENTIONALLY trying to deny loot from iron men, or making fun of someones gear, etc. 
---
PKing is naturally going to be more toxic because its competitive. Also Pvp clans as we all know are often just big groups of toxic people.

Divine would absolutely be BiS at places where HP is more important than prayer (at least from a defensive standpoint). It would also be BiS defensive in pvp.

Thanks for the reply! I think I'll try it with the 40 def, but 70 would take me a while... super low melee stats rn. Your response definitely gives me reassurance 
---
What is the 1m/h method? Are talking about filling inv with giant seaweed and superglassmake? Because the spell caps at 180 crafting xp per cast or something
---
Too useful for bursting/barraging/crashing, would just be used as a pseudo rs3 aggression pot
---
This makes sense. Thanks.
---
pointless comment
---
everyone get what he means
---
HAHAHAHAHA, I love this community. RREEEEEEEEEE
---
maxed total for a 1 defence account? thats what everyone calls them
---
Who are you..? 
---
It's not as if it's going to be camped offensively, just as a mob-gathering tool as its spec currently does. Currently using a Dinh's for one of its only uses (gathering nechs/dusties while barraging) only allows to spec for aggro every two lures or so.
---
I agree with your second point, but regardless what tanky content gets released in the future, Divine (if it passes) will still be the better pick over Dinh's.
---
It doesn‚Äôt cap at 180 per cast. It only does right now because we can only hold 18 buckets. If you could hold 10 sandstone and like 16 seaweed, it would be something like 1k exp per cast.
---
Taking away the spec would lower slayer ehp I believe. 
---
I think would probably be BIS at inferno but using it in pvp seems like you are begging to be smited.
---
Prove me wrong though, Im not sure on my vote yet.
---
Another repost.
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand this logic. The heads will take a couple hours to obtain on average, so you‚Äôre looking at about less than 500 prayer exp/hour. While that is more than we would have gotten before, it‚Äôs so utterly inconsequential for pretty much any player capable of farming Vorkath that I, and I imagine most players, will just keep their head stacks for novelty.
---
It isn‚Äôt even worth my time to go and present it at the altar. If I don‚Äôt want them in my bank I just won‚Äôt pick them up or I‚Äôll drop them. 1 Superior Dragon bone on the Chaos altar gives more exp than this.
---
On the note of there being no requirement, most accounts with DS2 completed will have enough favor to use the heads as ensouled dragon heads. If you asked players who trained prayer using ensouled dragon heads if they would use Vorkath‚Äôs heads in addition to their ensouled head pile, I‚Äôm willing to bet they wouldn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs doing an activity in which it would be solely a boon to use them.
---
The current proposition is inconsequential and just insulting to those that have spent dozens to hundreds of hours collecting heads. I‚Äôll sit on my pile of 9 head and just pay the 70k from a singular drop of Vorkath to buy some bones that give me far more exp than the heads instead.

Maybe it's because you turned a well thought out explanation into an unwarranted commentary of my personality?  You can say it's not about my character, it's still unwelcome from a stranger on the internet; you don't know me.
---
Also just an FYI, slowly adding coins to an offer if that QoL was implemented versus aborting and putting in an offer for +50% will result in paying the exact same amount of money.  The only time it wouldn't be true is if you bought out all of the lowest selling offer with a bulk buy.
---
So unless there's some psychological factor of slowly creeping up the price that makes people not pay more or something, I fail to see how it would affect item prices.  I would love to hear your explanation without you trying to be my therapist. 
---
That's not how framerate or user experience works. 30fps is the very definition of flawed. Your framerate should always strive to be the same or higher than your monitor's refresh rate. RuneLite gets you there, and OSBuddy doesn't appear to anymore. 
---
B
---
As someone who has an ironman, I disagree, you could get relatively high level ingredients rather early using potion drops and spawns that naturally take place in the game.
---
That‚Äôs rape, doesn‚Äôt count 
---
A potion to gain aggression is something that's been suggested many times with pretty decent support on this sub, this would appease people looking for better ways to aggro mobs besides cannon, and give the Dinh's an actually valuable niche for slayer/farming mobs in multi zones.
---
Wouldn't make sence to do wt anyway as redwoods are much faster. Todt to 200m would be aids.

I don‚Äôt think you ever get hunter xp from setting or resetting traps, only from successful catches. Maybe baiting traps or using a torch on it to mask scent gives small xp though?

It used to be, although wyrm bones are twice as cheap as much faster as of right now. Although you have to pay attention if you go to the wildness later (ensouled heads are more afk basically)
---
Jesus thats like 4000 hours of afking
---
I‚Äôd rather use the head stack as a boss loot bank tab placeholder than for 1K prayer exp. That‚Äôs just so inconsequential it hurts.

With just blessed d'hide you should be able to tank rangers fine, especially with 94 range and a bp. Only dangerous waves should be 45/61 and if you top up before those waves you should be fine.

A lot of the 1 defence skiller accounts also have restricted prayer and attack level.

Would you consider them maxed with less than 99 prayer and attack?

Nah, just a shit joke mate.

This man maxed his UIM already. And no ways he's really making THAT much off youtube. He clearly just enjoys the game.

Nah you don't get xp from failed traps. Maybe from using guam tar on the trap as bait though? That's the only possibility I can think of outside lamping it, haven't tested it though

yes, whatever build, 60 attack/ 75 attack or 52 prayer or 1 prayer.

---
I don't really pvm in the wilderness and don't see myself doing it. I agree few spare assemblers is cool, but it would just be sweet to see some other uses for these relatively rare head drops. Not that I have any idea what could that be... So I'll just keep stacking them.

OP why do you feel the need to repost a meme that you didn't make?

you guys are vastly overestimating how many people switched... is runelite the most popular client now? yes, but there are still quite a few people who use osb

Brother you do realise that casual players are the reason osrs is still live and aging well. If u want to play with people from 15 years ago go play rs3 because thats where most of those are at. Dont get me wrong, I'm not as u say a "casual" I have a cb 118 ironman and also 3 normie alts all with maxed cb. I just realise that without casual players this game wont survive for another 5 years.

---
There are 6 account with all 99's expect 1 defence.
---
It gets harder to tell with when you consider less than 99 prayer and attack, because someone could have 99 prayer and attack, but not 99 in some other skill, and they would be higher up on the high scores than someone who didn't. 
---
Go play rs3 is you like that sort of thing
---
Just to be clear, I'm not completely opposed to Divine. I would not be upset if it passes, and I think it is pretty well balanced. 
---
However, like I said above, there are items like the bulwark that are not used for defensive purposes at all. If Divine is passed then bulwark will be completely useless (even if more tanking mechanics are added). This definitely adds a smite risk in pvp, but as long as the player safed up on prayer you can seriously lower your opponents KO potential with little offensive loss.
---
It's probably not gonna happen if they can't get around Apple's BS. They'll have to write a version that uses Metal instead of OpenGL. 
---
You can hit more than some1s hp in pvp to prevent tick eating and stuff.
---
The polls exist as a barrier to change. That's why the vote threshold is so high- a vast supermajority of us need to vote for the game to change, otherwise the default option is that it stays the same. We know this is good because the game is definitely already good as is, so the null hypothesis should be "just leave it as is". 
---
Polls give jagex a license to make a change. Such a change is not guaranteed- it is merely allowed. The null hypothesis of no change is still valid. The game is already good as it is now. If in retrospect jagex concludes that the change is bad, they'll just leave the already good game as is.
---
This is a good system. It gives 2 different prongs of the game- developers and players- a right to say no to change.

---
&gt; Unfinished Torstol vials are now able to be used in place of a clean Torstol when making Super Combat potions.
---
Fuck this update. Stop updating the game specifically to make it easier for ironmen. Literally the only purpose of this is to make it so ironmen who accidently had their torstols on them when making pots in Nardah don't miss out on the super combats. Bet there's some bitch jmod on the team who fucked up and got this shit into the game. 
---
You don‚Äôt get smited if you are wearing max trust me. Will just make tanking a clan easier, and drastically change the meta.

Yeah I can understand it wouldn‚Äôt be a priority for them especially when the majority of players use windows but I hope they find a workaround. 
---
Are you worried about accidental left click? 
---
Why is your freezing point 32¬∞F and not 0¬∞C. Just because everyone in the US does everything backwards doesn't mean it's right lol
---
That would be a great update IMO, very cool
---
How much more can you hit? Is it percentages or what? I dont pvp or pk......yet. so i really didnt know this was possible.
---
Product fits the market, they can pay people very little and content creators will be onboard. 
---
Will this also help boost the .wiki over the .fandom page when Googling?

RED BEST! BLUE DUMB!

Okay that really put things into perspective lol. Damn
---
Opting in and out as you buy / sell high and low would allow for even greater manipulation. Even if they were to add a timer between opting in and out, people could just make more accounts to bypass it.
---
Here is [Fix](https://gfycat.com/constantadeptairedaleterrier)
---
Nope - if they got your account back that's all they care about.
---
I think you can hit as high as the max of the weapon is, so if you are on 50 hp you can still get hits 70s if im correct.
---
Except you wouldn't be able to use more than 3 giant seaweed per cast.

I mean *arguably* given the perspective of the painting, one could say the boat is ever so slightly out of frame

I‚Äôm pretty sure that people thought that sandstone would work like giant seaweed where you can use sandstone in place of buckets of sand.

Fuck that. Str first gang here.

It's because the current one uses OpenGL 4.3 which Apple doesn't support. They'd have to rewrite parts of it to use OpenCL or Metal or something to get it to work on Mac. 
---
When the current version already works on Windows and Linux (because they have proper OpenGL support; let's be clear Apple is the only reason MacOS doesn't support OGL 4.3), it's low priority to make those changes (which are probably non-trivial). 
---
They will never tell you who is responsible as they would just have an IP address, which they can‚Äôt really share unless they want lawsuits. It‚Äôs not safe as it could have been some idiot kid who they have now doxxed.

what are u doing posting here before getting another 200m complete? get back to work scrub

How about not listening to people who have short memories and get ultra-triggered by docks.

The game was dying without updates you numbskull. I've seen people saying they don't care if the game dies without updates, they said they just want a game for themselves. Selfish, disgusting people.
---
Personal stocker here, can confirm.
---
U could just make the player be right next to the orb. It would definitely make it easier. The distance on resizable and fixed from top left to orb to player is smaller than distance between middle bottom inv, spec, then person. Especially for fixed. Unless they pit the orb like top right of the minimap
---
And you've got nothing to back up your claims. PvM community is arrogant as fuck. Do you even PvM?
---
i think runescape is capped to 50 fps but i might be wrong

osbuddy is terribly inefficient though, runelite is superior in that regard. even b0aty uses runelite, just without any plugins, because it's more efficient

Nuts

There is no one not pking now because the barrage icon is too small or they cant click the spec atk bar. No qol update is going to make any significant dent on PvP

Thank you for your insight, I was misguided.

I believe this is still the case

Imagine not understanding the point of runescape and then shit talking someone for playing runescape on the runescape reddit.

Go away you with your sound logic.

This is fantastic!

Just a small update i'd find nice, if you wiki click on a skill in your stats tab could it bring up the wiki page for f2p or p2p training depending on what type of world you're on?

Should cost more like 25m

---
This is actually lore breaking. 
---
Yah, I can agree with that. It would be nice to do a full Hellhound Task or use your Dark Totems in a row, then break to do the Clues when you're done. But it would be a pretty big change to the pacing of Clues, even if most would consider it an improvement.
---
I really don't think that would workn't
---
Reading around, it looks like you were moved to Lumbridge depending upon where you were on the boat. Not all tiles of the boat were properly moved. These people were at the helm of the ship, and weren't moved.

Yes. I'm not in pvm clans though. The vast majority of pvm is slayer and instanced bosses though where there is almost no toxicity.
---
Of course theres nothing to back up my claims. It's an opinion dude. It's also the most common opinion of pvp. Wheres your evidence that pvp is less toxic? 
---
Even if i was doesnt make it any less true
---
Existence isn't pointless the point of life is to get small doses of dopamine every couple of days

how did you know that

Anyone who has a stockpile of Vorkath heads will have enough money to buy 99 prayer anyway. I'd rather keep them as a trophy than use them for a measly 1k XP.

From my experience pvp is at most equally as toxic. Obviously if all you do is slayer and zulrah you're not gonna run into toxic people though lmao

I think a big problem with your gp/hr and xp/hr with silk is that you're acting like the silk is worth the full value you can sell it to the NPC for, but you're not taking into consideration the time it'll take you to run from the bank to the merchant. 
---
Since you can't sell the silk immediately after stealing it, you really need to take the banking into consideration here.

Items go down over time until they stabilize, especially raids items.

You do love me, I know it.

I remember it being around 100 to 110 before kebos was announced but I think I'll settle for 120. Not sure if it's worth it for me since I only do trio raids.
---
i mean you can look right now, 324 has 400 people on..?
---
If it was used for botting it will get banned. You have the responsibility to keep your account safe. If it gets hijacked it's a good lesson for next time. Make sure to use 2-part authentication.

I liked the boat there. Idk why people got so heart broken about it.

This is gonna be where it's at. This is where it was at before hydra hype.

Which would be the right skeleton then, because the ones he was killing were just simply called "Skeleton"?
---
Yup, guess I got no hope of ever getting this fixed. Don't waste your time on this shit game. Mods are fucking AFK or botting themselves. No communication whatsoever. You got incorrectly banned, of well that's too baaaad the ban was 100% accurate is all I fucking hear from this pathetic community team. Got charged for a month of sub even after I was incorrectly banned wich is fraud btw so there's that too...  
---
r/bikinibottomtwitter 
---
like slightly less dps. otherwise same trip length sorta deal.
---
Saw next
---
Go to the repository on github. But there is no way the RuneLite devs would have let phishing code get into their plugins so you are wasting your time. 
---
More likely you use the email/password for other things and your details were leaked from a hack on another database and posted on a website hackers use to share information like that. 
---
Yeah fr. Good thing no one compared them 
---
&gt;the only difference is that you lose your items if you die in PvP
---
This is the exact reason that people cry about pvp so much, people like to pretend that everyone involved in pvp is toxic as fuck but realistically they just can't handle getting killed and losing their items. If they do get told to "sit" their pride gets hurt with no real way to get back at the person who pked them through skill so they complain on reddit and vote no to content.
---
its not a huge priority for team raids, right. probably would buy other stuff first.
---
Ah yes, the good ol water volcano.

Nope used the GE

---
High critical yikes

what level one are you looking at? there are 7, varying from 21 to 85 combat.
---
Probably dropped

Australia servers would probably be decent
---
waaaaaaa waaaaaaa
---
found illiterate only ironman
---
Mains respeccing as 1def is literally the core reason why this update will never happen. This conversations been had many times. It's a terrible idea.
---
The ones he fought were level 40.
---
It‚Äôs the port where Veos used to be.
---
Did you try to login with your main and see what the price is? I wonder if it's some glitch or because you're Australian and paying through google play store or apple store.
---
I'd recommend completing quests or leveling up. Go for the barrows gloves grind! Once you get the b gloves your stats should be fairly decent and then you can think about money making methods. As your account stands no money making method is really worth it.
---
Are you kidding me!? That won't even get past the second screen. You'd need two 2080TIs in SLI to get even 10fps on the 3rd screen.

Where did it go?? It's not in port sarim or dray now...

Logging out in time is too mechanically challenging for your average pvmer
---
Are you trolling or just retarded?
---
As far as gear goes I have every stable priced item in the game, reason I say that is because I dont't want to buy upgrades that I'll sell later for tbow. So i've got like 200m ish to buy temp stuff like kodai for gwd or dclaws for thermy. So atm I've just got a pile of cash and I dont't want to buy anything that will drop in price faster than I can make money lol. So the dhcb is the closest thing that will give any real benefit.
---
How much did you lose like 2 mil tops? Go do blast furnace and make that in a day ez
---
Also add a Bribing skill so you get faster xp! The Charbonneau Commission taught me well on how to handle that. 
---
too bad it links to the worst wiki
---
Yeah there's just so many quests to do! I just got mems 3 days ago so I'm still working on a lot of stuff
---
A lot of data on the wiki is collected by players (and it is edited by players). Not many people kill those skeletons so the tables can be incomplete.
---
Yet they dont collect spice. Your dumbass is the one picking that shit up. I, on the other hand, dont drop shit AND i dont pick shit up.
---
Would one massively expensive and rare item change the entire meta? I don't usually see people pk with elisian though, is this a common issue?
---
Isn't str-&gt;atk-&gt;def the most optimal route?
---
I guess I wondered if this is even being actively worked on for Jagex. It works as one of many plugins on RuneLite so you just click the plugin tab and off you go. The OG client doesn't even have a plugin yet so I'm not sure if this is something that may be months or years from happening on the OG client. Thanks for the reply!
---
It‚Äôs ez just do it
---
Omg dude how do you even recover from something like that lol
---
You‚Äôre actually a moron! Honestly people like you are what‚Äôs wrong with this community...

Thank you for the insight!
---
the small off shore island with a tree is poetic in the "life finds a way" sense
---
maybe he thought the tree looked profoundoy lonely being seperated from an entire forest of brothers and sisters by a narrow gap of water, which represents whatever he thinks makes him a societal out cast.
---
or maybe he just does completeoy uninspired landscapes, and thought the dock detracted from the painting
---
the bottom line is Da Vinci painted and artistic representation, he didn't snap a photo, let his expressions be!
---
Nice dude! Gratz!!
---
well yeah ofc, i mean youd buy stuff like fero gloves, prims tassets ances hat arma helm and pegs before it. rigour and lance are the number 1 and 2 priorities for expensive upgrades.
---
All valid points, although afaik all stewable diaries are still pretty easy to do, the only exception I can think of is the diary to make a rune scimitar in the resource area, since that requires 2 separate boosts. But you can still world hop every 12 seconds instead of 60 seconds.
---
because i like it?
---
They drank it all duh
---
The golden age
---
Because the wiki is not an all-knowing god. It is made by the community and information is aggregated by players, unless someone asks a developer and they release the complete list of information. Which I'm guessing for these random skeletons no one has asked a dev about them and thus don't have 100% accurate information regarding them.
---
Fed them to his beaver
---
Ahh, got it, thanks!
---
Oof
---
Read the blog, it even says after discussion with high tier players in the community...
---
there are actually clouds in osrs, you just can't look up
---
Yeah I pay for the others directly from the website and it still says $11 when I try with my main although I‚Äôve been paying for my main for years now, it did say it was going to be charged through iTunes 
---
Dark relics give more XP if used on a skill used during raids, so I like using it in agi or mining to get that extra
---
Tell me more about your two defense pure
---
he want to do werewolf course if going for 99 agility, sadly that is locked behind prayer
---
I made this one up a couple weeks ago but:
---
there once was a game called Runescape,
---
to point and click was all it would take
---
to get 99, but it takes all your time!
---
Boy I'd suck a dick for max cape.
---
&gt;No one is going to pk now that wouldnt before
---
Disagree because it slightly lowers the skill floor (not ceiling) and makes bridding slightly more appealing to at least try out. And same for reordering prayers, making nhing *slightly* easier to get into. This claim is a theory, but I for one would be more inclined to lose a few hundred k trying it out if one or two needlessly difficult aspects of a notoriously hard activity were made slightly easier and I felt like I stood at least a wee bit of a chance.
---
&gt;makes it less appealing for the people who are at the top
---
It shouldn't, because with everything involved in nhing they'll still be at the top, and also will have gained the same "advantage" of bigger icons as everyone else. Their entire argument is based on butthurt elitism and that someone else will have it *slightly* easier.
---
It's completely visual, no unlocks or %boosts after 99.
---
Neither clearly although I could ask you the same thing. I didnt compare the two. 
---
I said majority of pvm is slayer or instanced pvm. Theres less interaction there and almost no competition which leads to it being much less toxic. Obviously if you were to compare solely the group pvm community to the pvp community youd see similar levels of toxicity. However that's just a small part of the pvm community.
---
I don't think so, I believe they are only in members areas
---
Don‚Äôt worry, everyone in this thread looks dumb. 
---
Imagine actively wasting your life by commenting like this.
---
It's much better to face these kinds of things, with a sense of pride, accomplishment, and rationality
---
Think he means about possible MTX.
---
Boi with that agility xp I highly doubt u will 
---
lmfao you probably downloaded a fake client or watched some double xp / quitting streams
---
I'm not convinced he is working seeing how many hours he puts into the game. Not saying that to shame him or anything, but last episode he put 30 something hours just to get 53 construction, and I'm guessing that was done in less than a week (considering his upload schedule). So either he has a job which allows him to play at the same time or he works very little or not at all.
---
Hes probably going to burst or chin def after hp
---
As for lance ill wait a month or two until that drops because it's still fairly new, but no doubt it would be good for raids though I don't like meeleing vorkath
---
Idk
---
Improve the game, don't make it easy
---
Even if those do pass, I definitely won't be taking advantage of those features. No point building muscle memory that will only work in one area imo
---
How does this imply MTX at all. Mod Ash said it best. The community mentions MTX more than anybody at Jagex ever has. THEY know we don‚Äôt want MTX, it ain‚Äôt coming 
---
I originally purely played runescape because my original mac mini was a mac mini and was years until i had something that could run current graphics
---
No, but I'm guessing that it has something to do with servers
---
Quality cOntent

Why cant you just put 500 of 3 runes in the normal pouch? 
---
Mfw no one RCs body runes anymore for 200m rc like you used to. Remember when osrs was for serious scapers?
---
it's actually not because you're in combat, but because the cloud can't float into the tile you're on when the spider is next to you! :)
---
reeeeeeepost
---
Fuck your bitch ass dude.
---
2100 total but ok. I'm 100% using this method cuz I want xp during sand collecting.
---
30 kills/hr is 99 range with a dhcb, rigour, elite void, dfireward. Kill times sub 2 mins with like 4-7 kill trips
---
i cant do nothing, but im hoping jagex can ban the person. its been a week and nothing has been done!
---
He can trade so he's better off actually firemaking
---
i wish i could give you gold 
---
There's around 30 phishing streams per day from what I've seen, Twitch need to do more about it since they're knowingly allowing criminals to profit via their platform but.....they're leaving that job up to what I assume are voluntary "twitch staff"  which I assume are like the "player mods" of twitch. It's not really "enough" but those volunteers are doing their best.
---
I wouldn't boycott twitch because once you know about those kind of streams you know to ignore them and after a while you forget all about them. but comeee onn guys we don't need to argue about it, be angry at the criminals not each other!

Key word there is ‚Äòarchaic‚Äô.

Glad to be in a sub where people are encouraging leaving school to do what you love instead of shaming it. Not saying school is bad or anything or that you should leave. But it really is shit that anytime anyone has a dream and leaves school they get shat on for it.

perhaps anyone who knows something can determine what the cause was of me getting hacked, weather it was from a remote access or keylogger of some sort. I have no clue, but if it was a keylogger you'd think they'd access any of the information I have on my computer, instead of just going for my RSGP. For the love of god they could've had access to thousands of dollars but they go for RSGP?

Aw okay I like your website but it‚Äôs to much to scroll through everything every time. Wish ironmanosrs updated more often

Range cape on it's own still useless compared to Assembler, with the Max Cape bonuses though it becomes decent for first time Infernos.

Most of these people have decent real world skills that could translate into much more money. Yet they are so addicted to RuneScape they stick to what's comfortable. Yeah you can look at that as doing something you like, but let's be honest. Humans are not meant to spend 10+ hours (being generous with that low of a number for some people...) a day playing a singular game. That's not healthy mentally or physically. That's the part I find sad.

Ohhhhh nice find!

You wrote all that but your premise is wrong. It's not about believing it, its about imposing something that is incorrect on others. Get out.

Yeah I forgot people trade in this game.

I'd agree this is a bit too much, but they shouldn't just throw away the idea, they could literally just make it give you less per sandstone piece.

Honestly, I realized that right after hitting submit, and thought I deleted the comment lol.
---
Yea, it would be one of those "this video is sponsored by squarespace" ones.
---
But he is efficient within his boundaries. To me, I haven't felt excitement watching a game like this since the first twitch plays Pokemon. Similar in that every accomplishment is overblown because it's so challenging
---
This is posted every valentines
---
Yea sure all of that exists but you act like this is what a majority of twitch is like when its just not. It all depends on who you watch and is pretty easy to avoid every thing you've listed here.
---
It‚Äôs not something they can separate. If you have membership on rs3. You have membership on OSRS. It‚Äôs not even a MTX. It‚Äôs a free trial which literally ever game offers lol

How many marks do you expect to get from 200m? 
---
&gt;‚Äùso instead they just meme.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚Äùoompa loompa‚Äù
---
Pick one.
---
Ok I‚Äôll admit this one I like
---
Archaic, but not incorrect.
---
&gt;pkers are by far the most toxic
---
Source? Citation? Literally anything besides Reddit memes? Like you talk a lot about toxicity and pkers, do you even pk? Do you even know what true toxicity is? Have fun at tob/cox with 0kc kid, I bet all those ‚Äúnontoxic‚Äù pvmers sure will help you out. Wanna get some wc xp? Cool beans. Just better not crash one of the sweaties doing 2tick teaks or you‚Äôll be in for one hell of a toxic time. 
---
Keep your exaggerations and ludicrous claims right up your ass with the rest of your bullshit. 
---
yaaaaaaaaaawn
---
Smy-ed! He‚Äôs smy-ed!!
---
Logically they would have to. Wyrm bones atm are cheaper than babydragon bones and are higher exp/hour. That makes no sense.
---
Either the other bones will crash in price or wyrm bones will increase in price. Give it time for people to acknowledge the existence of these bones. A new normal will be found.
---
I have never been tested or anything but I feel as though I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt really consider this a repetitive task as i am always playing another account when playing this account. It is just something to do for a meme on the side.
---
When I first made this account it was originally just going to be 200m cooking  because 200m cooking is a meme in itself. After I finished it though I thought fuck it why not keep going it‚Äôs a cool and easy account to do.
---
Holy shit I just realized 2013 was 6 years ago. F
---
Pikachu expression, he's not that impressed by drops anymore
---
I think that there should be a Swampletics subreddit to clear this place of being about nothing but him. I just had to go and block 30 people who made threads about him because I am sick of seeing it. Every single day, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, like why don‚Äôt you just go comment on his YouTube page about how much you love him. I mean jesus, seriously? We get it he is the most amazing person to ever grace this game in the history of every well known person to ever do so. He‚Äôs better than Zezima and Lynx and everyone else who ever had even a fraction of notoriety in this game. We get it. Stop.
---
Also yes this is another post about Swampletics lmao holy shit I didn‚Äôt even consider that wow good one you are hilarious lmfao
---
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
---
hey I get this reference
---
Taking his job seriously by the looks of it.
---
You won't see much. I've done hundreds of wilderness clue steps and have seen maybe 4 other people doing clue scrolls at the same time. 
---
yeah but that would be any UIM, skilling the least efficiently. and there are plenty of UIM that utilise all of runescape and is thus more relatable because who spent this much time in morytania as a noob?
---
the things that makes settled's series so popular are
---
1. His already good reputation
---
2. his voice-overs are good to listen to
---
3. rooting for the underdog because of the severe limitations.
---
4. his excitement and motivation to actually do ToB on that acc is inspiring.
---
nostaglia isn't everything. everybody always just attributes everything to nostalgia.
---
you like osrs?
---
&gt; yes, I like osrs
---
me too, it's so nostalgic
---
like.. what? there h√†ve to be many more reasons to play this game because if nostalgia was the biggest factor we'd all be playing minesweeper or  MS Paint.
---
Yeah /u/filthyorangecat said he confirmed it wasn't Ironside. But I believe Ironside sponsorship is just a kickback to him if someone uses his code or something like that
---
Gotcha. Cause I‚Äôm using elite void with bpipeand bgs and am only sometimes getting two kills. If I manage to hit with my one spec after the first kill
---
You have a point, Very wise words, I imagine it‚Äôll be a bit of both, they‚Äôll rise and some other bones will drop a bit
---
When are you estimating to finish agility?
---
The irony in your username is palpable. THC means no, or infrequent, dreams because if its effect on the hippocampus. 
---
Just exaggerations and bullshit galore with you eh? 
---
Not one fact in your fucking essays of posts. Your English teacher is rolling over in his grave. 
---
Having a conversation with someone and asking them questions isnt arguing lmfao
---
/u/settledRS I would also patreon 
---
Play another game.
---
I play Dota Auto Chess and smith them for example (or woodcut/fish).

Two monitors is the meta.

Correlation DOES NOT affect causation! Christ you think you‚Äôd have to beat these people over the head with a club.

Use best in slot f2p gear and food. Don‚Äôt forget you won‚Äôt be going against members just other f2p also range up some more, strength and attack so you have some ko potential and go from there

LOL you got me there 
---
Don‚Äôt you fucking dare.

They aren't superior. They overheat unless you spend extra on cooling. 
---
I can't while I'm in work, haha.

Or just let people buy what they want to buy. 
---
Haha nice.
---
I was skeptical until I heard the words "There's a snail camping the bridge so I have to hop worlds," and then I knew we were in for some real shit.
---
I am sorry, I was a bit insecure if I was ready for the show so I waited too long with the announcement. But I will do more shows in the future so don't worry!
---
Would really like to know why you made this comment? You do know that most people play this game for fun, right?
---
It's untradeable so you won't lose it in most places
---
De iron then.
---
5 that I know of, possibly more.
---
iirc You can't lose Ivan's staff unless you're in Wildy
---
This comment made my day 
---
Never said they shouldn't. Just calling them out for buying a more expensive harder to maintain product. 
---
D) All of the above

fuck you motherfucker its REDCAPE FOR LIFE

That sounds brilliant.

There are those of us who have some spare cash and only game (work provides my workstation resources). Maybe next gen ryzen will be in my next build, but we‚Äôll see. 
---
Views
---
Sponsors are probably reaching out to him because of this growth tbh
---
They don't despawn if you get logged out for a very short time iirc, it's just that getting 5 clues on karamja is like 9000 harpy kills. Try doing that in one day lol. Often he'd have one karamja step ready at the start of the day of streaming and so only 4 more karamja steps would be required or around 7200 kills. 
---
I love how people try to pk me at green drags. Hope you enjoy the amulet of glory and 7 dragonhides!
---
It‚Äôs all connected, once I used it on the range Max cape it wouldn‚Äôt let me use another on the normal range cape or normal max cape.
---
are you doing combat skill together or are you spending 10 years cannoning to 200m?
---
I did cooking first to make money lol I cooked fish for profit. This account just started as an afk money maker to fund maxing on my main.
---
Hey, glad we finally found something in common.
---
&gt;most of us probably play other games
---
You answered your own question.
---
Man did 200m cooking with no cooking gauntlets or Sean stove. Although that last 187m exp must have been killer profits 
---
Wholesome
---
You joke, but Minecraft Story Mode is on Netflix, so anything is possible at this point.
---
Thanks to everyone who came! I had a blast doing this show and I will continue writing more jokes for more shows! Maybe you'll get a private show around the GE World 302 where I practice, if you're lucky! 
---
its a dead area, why add shit?
---
It's funny how you're getting downvotes for stating the truth while a guy claiming there is zero skill in pvp is sitting at 2 upvotes. Would love to see him win half his fights (or even 1) vs brids in deep wild lmao. Honestly unsure whether or not he's trolling. Truly a case of Poes Law. 
---
Funny will be when he needs to fund 200m range with only cannonballs
---
Could we see the code? :)
---
It does lower the ceiling lol. It lowers the skill gap, not the floor. U can pk as a rag bolter or autocast barrage. Thats way easier than bridding. Then when u get more coordinated and familar you move up. 
---
The people at the top are separated by such little things. This definitely will jump people into another ‚Äútier‚Äù while the people at the top wont go up any because theyre already accurate af. 
---
no
---
Videos don't get demonitized due to age restrictions. They get fucked if the creator for example sing a song themselves or a song appears in the background for 2 seconds or some other random bs.
---
Are you guys trolling here I can't even tell lol. Why would I cite my personal experience.
---
You willingly traded someone your bank. Jagex won‚Äôt even acknowledge this as a scam. Sorry man. Just how it works. Don‚Äôt trade other players. Don‚Äôt trust other players... just iron man. 
---
ya 50gp is still too steep, and they've added too many steps.
---
Its clear they have devs making poll questions that are not actually doing the math before doing them.
---
11$
---
it would be faster then the suggested method I think still not including 3t possibly, but ya would be more tedious
---
Yeah any network security class will teach you that that‚Äôs the first thing you should never do.
---
Anime Lewds huh (Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Most overhyped thing on runescape i have ever seen, guy does ultimate ironman in morytania, cool.
---
I‚Äôm actually in the market to buy one of those right now. 
---
Honestly I never expect to get to combat but if I do I will cannon.
---
Well considering you can probably get 50 qp in under an hour it seems rather childish to ignore them. Quests are a part of the game and a very easy one at that.
---
lol. sad they get away with it tbh. 
---
You soiled something that was once funny. 
---
They are going to regret the purchase during the summer. 
---
Good job you did a run of barrows did you solo it or did you need help?
---
ALCH IT BOIS AND THEN BUY SOME BONEZ
---
Thanks man
---
 (Õ†‚âñ Õú ñÕ†‚âñ)
---
Came here to say this :(
---
I just cant bring myself to always tbh. I get efficiencyscape mode sometimes, but I gotta back up off the grind or I'll just drop it completely for half a year lmao
---
Right click guide should direct to the most current slayermusiq1 guide 
---
Why does green d hide body req dragon slayer to equip but the others don't?
---
Anything that triggers mr mole is welcome on this sub
---
It‚Äôs not dead, just suffers from the swamp decay effect.
---
That‚Äôs the best way to handle these situations I‚Äôve found. No reason to upset yourself over some one you don‚Äôt even know! Keep wearing your ardy cape with pride and tell him he wishes his cape teleported him around 
---
Best way early game to get gp. 
---
Go back to sand casino where you belong 
---
Runelite question here.. so I accidently clicked on something the other day and now my left click automatically withdraws 10 items at a time. How do I change it back to 1?
---
Thanks for the spoiler dickhead
---
Boss head is great
---
A few things that separates Settled from other YouTubers imo:
---
1. He seems to really enjoy the game. Doesn't complain about the grind, and doesn't fake over reactions when he gets something good. 
---
2. He really knows the game well, but is still discovering stuff that few people know about, and some things that aren't even on the Wiki. It's like being a kid again and discovering this whole big virtual world for the first time.
---
3. The editing is good without being overbearing. It's not just an endless "leveled up" parade, and the way he does commentary and talks through his plans helps you start thinking along the same lines. 
---
Overall, I really don't think there a series I've enjoyed more than this one.
---
/u/JagexGambit the Hatius Cosantius poll is a real punch in the gut. I thought it was gonna be a *re-poll*. 
---
People want him gone. I'm the one [who requested the the repoll in the other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apgnxz/qol_month_week_3_reruns/eg8jl6q/) but I didn't really expect you to poll a miniquest that **cements him in the game's lore**.  
---
Please poll it without the miniquest. Or maybe just don't poll it. The miniquest would be even worse. I'm actually kinda sorry I asked now...
---
This comment sums it up for me
---
Think about his excitement over rune platelegs, meanwhile I‚Äôm getting pissed if we get bcp and not tassets. I think this plays a big role in it too, a little appreciation for the little things 
---
LMFAO imagine him saying it with the accent
---
Someone is salty that they‚Äôre single
---
It's a pic of swampletics on a butt cheek, impressive stuff
---
Ok, still seems sketchy but I trust you cocaineandmojitos.

Oh oh oh, I understand now. Thanks for the clarification.
---
You are a kind and precious soul
---
Everything
---
If it isn‚Äôt ironside it‚Äôll probably be stakedotcom
---
Because you make 100k in 10 mins
---
why is all the good stuff pvm only? would making the gameplay in pvp a bit less finicky really be the end of the world?
---
Torag's hammers ofcourse..
---
I think I've seen one or two ironmen with slayer. I've heard about one guy who got herblore.
---
This guy salty af because nobody wanted to meet his morytania locked ultimate iron man after he maxed his other ultimate iron man and decided to up the ante to forge his own journey from scratch, no banking, no trading, but this time he can‚Äôt leave morytania and all leading up to taking on one of runescapes biggest challenges the theater of blood
---
he said its not ironside
---
I only vote what has majority of the votes since people already read it and voted for me.
---
I appreciate your post man. My gf broke up with me a week ago today and it‚Äôs been hell. I‚Äôve got back into scape though, and I‚Äôve been having a blast. Just finished MM the other day! Appreciate you fellas for this 
---
Shades of Mort'ton... Hell, if it wasn't for Swampletics I would have completely forgotten it was even a thing. Really needs a re-work
---
To the top

Why aren‚Äòt his poll results hidden? Jamflex pls /s

at 99 farm a herb runs between 150 and 250k.

TIL.

Oddly specific, what have you done OP?
---
So that's what happened to Blizzard
---
If you're wanting to get into PvM, then a main hands down.
---
Or he is chopping trees so he can repair the barricade for participation.
---
&gt;Players who struggle to maintain their activity via attacking enemies may find it easier to repair the barricades and gates. This also allows for players who do not want to train combat-related skills to also receive points. For repairing barricades it is advised that you finish the Easy Kandarin Diary for Kandarin headgear for double log output from normal trees, as the trees in the minigame do not respawn and you might be competing with other people who also require logs to repair the barricades. You need a hammer to repair barricades. You gain 5 Crafting experience per repair.

not bis for raids 1, that would by scythe and rapier.
---
I've had the account since like 2004 man that would be so hard
---
There's no way you did rooftop the whole time
---
I upped it to 10K and lost lol cause Settled said that it wasn't Ironside
---
Good luck getting +5
---
Lance &gt; Rapier.
---
I thought the same thing! 
---
Ultimate ironside!
---
Because this stuff already did not pass when it was PvM and PvP. At least we'll hopefully get it in this form.

RuneLite completes Old School RuneScape.
---
Lmao what are you on about theres no adults here
---
 Not really.

It doesn‚Äôt even have your account name. 
---
They‚Äôre kinda right though 
---
Clue scrolls are not slayer my friend.
---
Iron side has nice PCs. The overlap between the OSRS community and the no-life tech nerds community is quite great. Makes osrs community an ideal target even if osrs isn‚Äôt associated Sith high tech requirements
---
somebody tell me what level he would be if he did efficient (non tick manipulation) leveling
---
VERY surprised to see from your profile that you‚Äôre a rs3 player lol....go back to runespan
---
Im with you on the 3770k grind, feelsbad in ddr3
---
There's already a changelog in the dev blog which says that they will be polling just replacing him with a different NPC, not the miniquest. 
---
Sorry, I meant doesn't wt grant more fm exp than wc exp per kill
---
this is true for what we know right now, but given that he made such a huge point about getting hunter level 2, and that he's super excited about showing us the next couple weeks, i wouldn't be surprised if he manages to pull something out of his sleeves.
---
Isnt it like 1/50? Its not rare for a fairly easy boss.
---
Fair enough lol
---
If you're hit an 80, the damage is reduced to 56 and you're taxed 12 prayer points. You saved yourself 24 hp (3/8ths of a brew) to use 12 pp (less than 1/10th of a restore). You saved yourself an extra brew dose giving yourself the time to sip the restore in it's place..
---
Nobody is getting smited for this thing. People won't die with this thing.
---
they mentioned on the QnA that they are still working on it and hopefully it will be out next week. They currently have the functionality to add seeds to it, but not to remove from it (the item sink we didn't know we needed)
---
Unplayable
---
They do drop the keys. 
---
Wat is that fishing rod called
---
Just have to make the Bonecrusher Necklace worth using. Giving it the hybrid combat stats of a Fury (or perhaps just between Glory and Fury) would present a compelling reason to use it in scenarios where you would otherwise take a Fury while not devaluing zenyte jewellery. 
---
Yes it's better than ely if compared the way you did, no one would argue that. Is it worth ~750mil more risk? Probably not. And, unlike ely, you can counter it by draining their prayer dropping the reduction to 0. The likely result is that divine will be better for the first few hits, then utterly useless for all other hits.
---
You also don't factor in the loss of pressure/damage by having to quaff two pots to "heal" instead of just one, or the fact that any other prayers being used will make this even more difficult to manage. It also requires a higher skill cap to manage both hp and prayer pools to begin with, which also leads me to believe that this change is for the better even if it is better than ely because i wholeheartedly believe people should be rewarded for higher skill. Your numbers are pretty useless in practicality.
---
&gt;being smited won't happen
---
I'm not gonna sit here and run the numbers for something i don't care about, but when you run the numbers with smite factored in lmk, because without acknowledging the potential counter, none of this info is relevant to begin with.
---
Dont wanna get hacked out here m8. Also those are dorgeshuun teleport spheres.

The rare drop table 
---
I have your hiscores page bookmarked on my phone. I check it monthly! Good work man!!! I was hyped when I saw you hit 99 agility (: 
---
Sponsors would probably offer him some $$ upfront for signing on. I would say take the deal now and if he enjoys continued success (he will) he can use offers from potential sponsors to up his pay from his current ones if they low balled him. That explosive growth is definitely looking shiny as fuck to their Marketing teams right now 
---
I've had them from Hydra boss but I have also done about 200+ Grotesque guardians with ZERO keys. Might be glitched idk, was thinking the same thing lol
---
An ultimate Ironman, or any Ironman, is technically impure if they play any other games on the computer. This is common knowledge. In fact some would even argue that using the computer for ANYTHING other than OSRS, quest guides and drop tables would be impure. It destroys game integrity 
---
let me guess you was the a squeal of fortune aswell *facepalm*
---
Yikes the delusion is real.  
---
It's okay, players like you will end up killing the game and what made it great.  
---
Not a big deal to me since I play casually now, but you'll look back and realize how retarded you are in the future lol.

Be honest do you enjoy that xxx hour grind for the 5 second dopamine release? We're comparing camping something for a few hours to 10's of hours of mindlessly collecting something to then mindlessly craft it for xp, it's not the same.
---
It's arguably BiS for solos, especially once you calculate in the scythe's operating cost.
---
Absolutely not, no. Im like most og osrs players and had rs3 ruined by eoc/microtransactions
---
It means a lot to me that people care about what I am doing! Thank you man :) feel free to add me on the account I always have my private on if u want to ask me any questions!

Keep pestering him to release it haha

That works out 600k/hr though

How did you get cooking up without leveling anything else? Gold trading?

Sorry should of made it clear. Was wondering between the 3 I posted. No way I have the money for tassets haha
---
I won't regret it as it was the most powerful consumer grade cpu at the time of purchase. AMD has a lot of annoyances i don't wanna deal with, like the ram OC, which i hope they will fix with zen2.
---
And thermals are fine with the 9900k. Mine runs at 5ghz all core overclock and doenst go above 68 degrees during games. Yes i slapped an AIO on it, but why would I stick with AMD's stock cooler in the scenario i bought an 2700x when i spend like 2000+ euros on my build already.
---
Or stake.com

Just from selling logs to the general store. Obviously not efficient but it got the job done :p

How is ignoring him going to help? You'd still see the traps on the ground that blocks the ladder hitbox

Thermonucler smoke devil does
---
i made around 200-250k farming torstols per run, run takes 10 minutes, making around 1.5m per hour passively. maybe take into consideration the odd dead plant a run but usually pays itself off when you get those 16+ herb picks on 1 plant.
---
"Pathetic."

Personally id say the easter tutu but if you missed it dw. The community is working to make the golden tench equip tk the legs slot.

@Settled

Have you considered making a Patreon?

I would subscribe to your Patreon in a heartbeat. You could release the episodes an hour early for Patreon subscribers as a reward! \*wink\* \*wink\*
---
Afaik Grotesques are the only boss who currently don't drop keys. I've submitted a bug report for that a week ago, as (just as in this thread) everyone I spoke to hasn't gotten a Konar drop there in hundreds of kills each.
---
+ during games the cpu doens't nearly get as hot as during workloads like rendering. My cpu never hit 70C during gaming while running a 5ghz OC on all cores.
---
Addy makes it easier to study...

lol, amateur detective alright. think whatever the fuck you want.

Honestly if it unlocks a skill I see no problem adding things here and there for region locked accounts. Doesn't have to be easy mode power creep, just unlocking content at all is a good thing 
---
I hate to say it....    
---
Ok, who am I kidding, I love to say it.
---
This account getting a bunch of upvotes here it the cringest shit I've seen in quite some while. Pretty much each and everyone of you Reddit normies' accounts are better than this.
---
Last year he's played **less than an hour a day** on average.    
---
And bear in mind, this is brain dead afk ardy agility. Can do it even on your phone.    
---
The casual slayer, or whatever else you guys like to do, is wayyy more click intensive than this.
---
And yeah, I know this might get some replies saying agility is the hardest and most click intensive difficult skill there is. If you're saying this, I'd bet good money that you haven't even reached 95 agility so you could try out afk ardy. You're just saying it because that's what everyone else says. Agility is one of the easiest skills there is. Sure it's the slowest one, but also one of the easiest.
---
This guy is on pace to hit 200m agility in 9 years.    
---
Looking good...
---
Lmao i bet you're sitting there like "omfg bro im in another argument on reddit get me a towel to dry my sweat bro, lmao got em" like bitch you're only on here talkin shit because you have no voice or authority irl, so yeah im sure other posts are in need of you so you can feel morally satisfied lmao
---
Just overall best really. Just got back to osrs. And dragon use to be a must have. Just don't know which would be best. Out of the 3 I posted. No way I can afford tassets ha. My set up at the moment is. Helm of N , fury, torso, obsidian legs, d boots. So didn't know if other legs went better with that set up. 
---
So right click it.. are you dumb, overweight, or both?
---
Wait you're keyboard warring too tho where's ur vag
---
Took me 11 seconds to click your profile and find that, but good attempt at deflection 
---
Being pked is a free teleport out a lot of the time, too 
---
Risking anything on death in 2019 lul
---
Lul
---
Where do you live?
---
Still worth the chance - just like killing General Gradoor for Bandos Tassets. Rare but with enough kills you are more and more likely to get it.
---
I play ironman, have done so since release. Only one of these i abused was whip at 80 slayer. Im still only 92 crafting and I think this is too easy.
---
It shouldnt really be much faster than doing buckets in yanille, unless its a high effort method like the sandstone one being suggested. 
---
Did you know you can hop worlds? Its pretty handy
---
I've had multiple but i have a ton of bandos kills now so its more evened out, but the first one was super low. 
---
Ty
---
He's probably going to make plenty of money from marks of grace, not to mention it looks like he's funding the account from another account since he did cooking first and had to buy the things to cook
---
How long you been grandfathering?
---
You're so mad I can see your brain bubbling lol fuckin dumbass can't even maintain a simple conversation without having an anyeurism. 
---
Oh my bad, I just used dragon platelegs until I could use barrows. 60-70 doesn't take that long. 
---
Have never used obsidian but could be worth looking into for NMZ or something. 
---
Well, If I remember correctly you can't stockpile the stews pre-made. You have to spice them on the spot. I tried boosting for the mining req in "Making friends with my arm" and ended up having to make several trips from my bank aaaaaaall the way back up the weiss mountains and through the caves dodging projectiles... 
---

I don‚Äôt feel that new hides are necessary. I think if we remove some range strength from ammunition and the inherent bonuses from blowpipe and twisted bow we could add strength to armor. Range strength on armor makes sense. Allows us to add new best in slot armor without pushing too far. It punishes pkers who range in a black top and melee gear in every slot by removing some of their max hit. 
---
It also makes sense that someone in mystic is splashing on full hides. We don‚Äôt see people complaining that they crossbow a lot of 0s against someone in full rune with kite and helm.

On Reddit especially r/2007scape when ever I or others have a minority opinion they will get downvoted. No matter how reasonable they are. Here are some examples:

Ive tried basically everything before, and I will admit that for a period of time I was hooked on some of the harder stuff. When my body was in withdrawal though i would have THE most insane fucking vivid god damn dreams ever. And it would be all of 30 mins long, but the dream itself would feel like hours. It sucked cause that's all the sleep id get for a while but man those dreams were intense. Like shit happened where I couldnt even begin to describe it. One of them (that is very hard to explain btw) was basically like I was on some ship/boat kinda cruise thing maybe and I got somewhere and it was like an island of sorts, water everywhere, I went and this girl who in my dream I knew/was in love with type of thing/she was the perfect specimen ever (in the dream, no clue who it was and wasnt referencing anyone irl) and we basically left together? Wish i could explain the water part tho lol her "house" was on an island itself sort of and i was always in the water it seemed. Some more super crazy shit happened but i cant even begin to describe that. The dream felt so real though and it was such bliss cause this person was my "2nd half" type of love and it was..weird waking up.
---
And ive had so many more that are so much harder to explain lol. Im bad at explaining whats in my head too, but youve had these dreams before it seems the crazy vivid roller coaster type where random shit happens. Its quite the experience. Im not sure if i enjoy them though. Well i didnt enjoy what caused me to have them, so that's probably why.

when you report someone, the players you recently traded with should automatically be listed in the menu, or the report should be able to process without a name, considering jagex can see your trade history anyway

I know this is over a month old. But I mean, he played for two years and got a quest cape 9 months ago which iirc was one of his goals along with jad. Idk if he really ditched the game, more like just finished what he wanted to do.

I agree that a 20% increase isn't as bad for crafting, and i am aware that gathering sand is only part of the crafting meta for irons. The issue is that just because gathering sand is only a part of the method, a 600% increase is just too drastic (a 20% increase is too drastic as well. I'm not too sure what would happen with sandstone prices after this update because obviously no one banks it at the moment and there is no market for it at all, so im fairly sure (like 95% sure) that people will abuse 1,1m xp/h. Also the way superglassmake works with multiple seaweed and multiple sandstone just hints that the jmods had no clue what they were actually polling which is a part of why i am against the original proposal as well.

Doesnt matter.  Point is you're getting more exp for the same cost. Hence making it cheaper.

Yes cosmetic rewards only would work.  But honestly nobody would give a fuck about it then.

No one's gonna mention hunter?
---
Guaranteed bond money, breaks up the grind.
---
I find it kind of annoying that they keep repolling it. Like someone at jagex really wants the divine in the game.
---
Then stop talking you're doing the exact same thing except you're being toxic while doing it. The reason you run into toxicity everywhere is because you are the toxicity.
---
Absolutely. It has been extremely apparent. Given Ayiza's opinions on the game, I am starting to think Ayiza was the one keeping them in check over there. Sucks that he is gone and Jagex' actions lately have made me concerned about the future of the game
---
Ugh kids

I went from 62-95 fishing at monkfish, 50-92 mining at mlm, and 60-99 wc all while playing other games with osrs up on a different monitor to the side. It was like taking a several month long break from the game and coming back with a bunch of free xp.

Hey it's me, the guy. Will accept 1b for an apology

Sorry perhaps I should rephrase.  Outside of combats it's the most op.  Yes it's expensive but it is because of the uses it has.  So if you make it cheaper it's more accessible which given its power it shouldn't be.  It makes a lot of high level content more efficient and easier.  Doesnt need a buff and this has been stated on several occasions by jmods

I watch for the great content, I'm sure many will agree.

I just really don't like the false casual/hardcore dichotomy. It's a problem in all games, but it seems especially pronounced in the OSRS community. That division just doesn't accurately depict players though. I just got back into Rs two weeks ago after ten years away. I've been playing anywhere between six and twelve hours a day, I have clear long term goals I want to accomplish, and I very much plan on experiencing the endgame content I never got to as a child. But I'm not going about things in the most efficient way possible, I'm not min/maxing stats, or precisely calculating experience gains and tracking kills. I just want to have fun but also make progress. So am I casual or hardcore? I would say neither. I'm an intermediate player, more or less average. Casual players have a high turnover rate, they don't stick around or only play sporadically, so catering content to them isn't really going add to a games longevity. They still need content but it should be of a lower priority. Strong endgame content that appeals to hardcore players is absolutely necessary. They're really important for player retention. You definitely want keep them around, and keep them engaged. They also tend to be unpleasable. They're constantly going to complain about minor and major changes alike, and they will be extremely vocal about it. But when devs constantly cave to their demands development starts to yo-yo. A change is introduced only to be reverted or changed again, over and over and over again. The game gets caught in a loop and eventually you'll start to hemorrhage players. I understand why Jagex went for the whole player input system, but at this point they're letting the inmates run the asylum and it's causing problems and dividing players. Devs need to be able to assert themselves on some issues and take input or leave it up to players on others. Transparency doesn't need to be synonymous  with impotency. Players are not game devs, what they want is not always what's best for the game, and that is doubly true when the most vocal players are also the most niche players. Oh well though. I'm still having a blast playing again after so much time away.
---
So? That isn't a counter to my point
---
 The item is already fucking aids because pvmers and pkers can use it to tank and run away while its defensive stats are stupidly high and it's only 5m
---
Its my own opinion 100%. Its a meme also but that has absolutely nothing to do with it. 
---
I'm not an idiot dude. The fact that you think me finding the pking community to be the most toxic to be toxic is pretty scary. I said a bunch of times I don't think the whole community is toxic. Its just a relatively small community where you see toxicity 100x more often than skilling and pvm. I made my point very clear but for some reason you choose to either completely ignore the point, or you actually don't know how to read.

funny how your opinion and a meme are the same thing eh? Almost as if ive been pointing to that the entire time. I only care for facts, nothing more about one community or another. I participate in them all, and ive seen equal amounts of toxics in all. If you spread misinformation, dont be surprised that somebody will correct you. It is the rule of reddit after all. 
---
Well, I‚Äôm not even saying this for the sake of ironbtws, but why add something in that will take way more effort if it will bring in ‚Äúa little‚Äù more exp than something so effortless now? That‚Äôs not very cash money of them

the time spent was about the same for half the cost of the skill normally, issues are it causes the item price to increase meaning training without cost far more gp/xp

Did you take any of these comments seriously :/

Thanks a lot.
---
You are fucking stupid.  You buy your own supplies get exp for building then you want more exp as a reward for completing your contract.  Same cost.  More exp = less gp/exp.  I'm not mad about devaluing 99 con.  Just pointing out how you said it was a pro in OP.

If you only care about facts then you are adding absolutely nothing to this discussion. This whole topic is 100% subjective, there's no facts to be in here. If you have any facts proving my opinion wrong I'd love to hear them. But you don't because that's impossible..

There's already a lot of unlisted rules when in the wilderness. Changing the UI layout for only PVM is a bad way to continue the current trend of "PVM or PVP" only content. Honestly I shouldn't have to say anything more than "it's confusing".

Except what the fuck is subjective of dozens of different people all saying the exact same thing of "there are toxic portions in every community". Its not like im the only fucking one telling you off kid wake up lol. You really need to take a break from the reddits its brainleting you. 
---
I know what you mean, not being able to explain something but in your mind it seems so unfathomably cool. That is the nature of dreams and why they are so awesome :) your own personal experience.
---
I like smoking weed but im not a chronic smoker so i take breaks now and then after a few days and my dreams are always crazy vivid. You can also lucid dream extremely frequently because basically all you get is REM sleep. Normally you are in REM sleep for a few hours a night but after 3-5 days of heavy dreamless sleep, your brain overcompensates and you REM basically all night and wake up feeling exhausted as fuck because you just got out of acid land in your head lol. Anyway good time to take advantage of lucid dreaming.
---
If you like dreams another thing you might be interested in is looking up this phenomenon people have where they have dreams that last a "lifetime." IIRC they get stuck in the dream in their mind and they live like a full fledged life. I'm talkin 80 years. All the good stuff, being a kid, getting married, dying, all of it. And during the dream it feels like it is actually their life, and when they wake up it feels like that entire experience was suddenly stripped away, and they feel like their life is a lie and become manically depressed. I mean how would you feel if someone snapped their fingers and life as you know it was over just like that and it was all in your head. All the struggles for money... all that hard work in school... all the heartache over girlfriends dumping you... all those fights with your parents... all that struggle and pain... and now its nothing. Its crazy man. The brain is crazy. NGL i've wanted to experienece that "life dream" stuff but i also am not jealous of the waking up part. I think i'll stick to my own dreams :P
---
Go like under "rewards" you fucking degenerate.  Like talking to a brick fucking wall...doesnt help you cant even understand the language you're speaking in.

Rs3 would like to call bullshit on that. The reason that 2007 is still alive is due to polls even if you agree with that or not. Again not to say democracy doesnt have its shitty dimensions. Every system does. Doesnt meant jagex knows exactly know what to do or not do.
---
EoC was a perfect example of Jagex 'calling the shots'. And fucking it up majorly. It was unwanted and they decided to fuck up with what they 'thought' was good for the game. Which is how we arrived at Old school. The direction of the game was so bad, that people wanted to play a game without new content from 2007.
---
And we are talking about bias? Developers and the game companies have one of the biggest biases of them all. Profits. So thats a bad argument.
---
Look at the latest draynor change. Who the hell thought it was a good idea to put a dock by draynor? Or 2k brews to a mid level slayer master. I can get frustrated as well at high lvl neckbeards and streamers that play 15hrs a day try to stop updates that devalue shitty game design like buying 50k buckets of sand from a shop. Or that encourage the idea that 3ticking sandstone is this amazing and challenging game design that we should balance things around. 
---
But at the end of the day. Every system is going to  have its shitty quirks. But if history is any kind of message of a possible future. We are not too bad.

No they aren't. You can imagine a similar system where you can buy bonds for in-game GP but without allowing people to benefit from P2W - for example by selling bonds via an in-game NPC store. Obviously that won't ever happen because Jagex wants people to buy bonds but it's not impossible for one to exist without the other.

You can try to work towards vorkath too. There are a more prerequisite to do tho. Both zulrah and vorkath are similar gp/hr but vorkath a bit more chill and you only need high ranged level.

Its so sad, aint it.

they are already ignoring shit that passes polls, and now you guys want them to have complete control of it anyway?  Man you guys are sheep.
---
Holy fucking shit, the same almost happened to me. I was doing some kbd with wyvern ward, dhcb, and pegs. I met some dude and we started duoing him. Every fucking time I banked there would be a group of pkers waiting for me. Yet he always came safe. So one trip there was like literally 10 people attacking every single master, when I was tbed. So the "freind" started boxing me saying box back, and would constantly run down and up the ladder. 
---
I'm no idiot, if I die unskulled I lose like 30k, skulled and it becomes 200m+. So I never boxes him back, just in case and was able to tele out. Dude pmed me saying he could've died and to box him next time. I told him fuck no, im not boxing someone to save 30k. Deleted and consulted my cc, we agreed it was probably a skull trick. 
---
It sucks dude, good luck rebuilding. 
---
So I shouldn‚Äôt take the chance to kill someone who could have their runestack? 
---
Mammal, faux, and the other top streamers don't seem to be doing too bad either if they can do it full-time for years
---
Comparative to games like league or fortnite yeah, it's nowhere close in numbers, but being able to do it full-time means at least something is working out.
---
Can you elaborate further for me?
---
Typically right now in a Duo/Trio we pile the Mage hand first and then Spec the Melee hand and deal with that second. What do you do? Stats/Gear you use?
---
Thanks
---
why not just kill thermy instead
---
Appreciate the thoughts brother
---
Possibly. 
---
Hi, 
---
&gt; How does exactly lunar spell book helps me? 
---
A: Lunar spellbook is not necessary for farm runs.  Most people run Lunars (myself included) because you can use "Spellbook Swap" to use Arceuus spellbook in the case that one of your patches die, you can use the "Revive Crop" spell which has a 50-75% chance of reviving a dead patch.  Furthermore, it's useful because you can teleport to "Catherby" directly instead of running from Camelot telespot (some people find this a big deal, I don't personally mind running but I'll save anytime I can if possible).  
---
Like what other users have posted, you can use supercompost spell (I would not recommend this until you purchase the upgrade to ultracompost at Volcanic Mine).  
---
**Worth mentioning:** If you are doing farm runs every 80 minutes to secure a bond every 2 weeks, I would ***highly*** recommend getting the upgrade sooner rather than later to make your farm runs much nicer (Not a necessity) 
---
However, since there is the farming guild with Hespori, there are those unlimited compost buckets, so you could invest in one of those and then load yourself up to 100-1K ultracomposts so that the unlimited compost holds only 1 inventory space rather than 5-8 (depending on how many patches you have unlocked).
---
I know brother. Hindsight feels so clear, I put trust into someone I shouldnt have :(
