So many people fell for this, more funny than he post itself
---
---
---
Good quality post 
---
my opinion: ring should be dropped, but not the item that was inside it.
---
No it's better if it does work. Teach people to pay attention.
---
This is a bones to bananas comparison
---
I agree but they should have some type of appeal system for me to go to since I wasnt in control of my account when it was banned
---
When you put items in the bank, you can withdraw them as a stacked 'bank note' to transport more than 28 at a time. You can't use the note, to get the items back you need to use the notes on a banker. To get noted items along the bottom tab of the bank interface click withdraw items as: notes. 
---

---
Also to avoid confusion, this screen is your inventory. A loot bag or looting bag is an item to store additional items while in the wilderness
---
How is additional clues coming in not going to make a difference? Instead of only getting one clue a task, I can get 2 maybe even 3. Repeat that 100 times, that's an additional 200-300 clues, and that's per player.
---
Your weak ass brain surely must at least comprehend that. 
---
Sorry I meant all the untradables not all of them. Like the large spade. 
---
Aw ur so cute. Since nobody is helping you:
---
The tin you have at the top is in it’s noted form. You can turn anything noted at a bank.
---
Now for advice. Put everything in the bank.
---
Definitely is not one player in lummy lol

Quest menu, green star, ardougne. The first set of challenges (easy) will unlock the cape.
---
Well hopefully I've given you a reason to back to them. 😂

Honestly, how PvP works as a whole kinda needs to change. Not so much how you fight, but more how you get into fights. Like some form of PVP minitournament type of thing. Something that rewards PVPers with stuff you can ONLY get via PVP. Maybe PVP Barrows type of thing, where instead of fighting the barrows brothers, you enter a tournament, where you PVP one on one in rounds until just 2 people are left, and then you're dropped down into an arena like the final area of barrows and then you have to fight for the treasure.
---
The idea would also work as a way to have PvP that doesn't pay out with the other guy's stuff.
---
I mean sure I am interested but what the fuck does this have to do with osrs
---
[removed]
---
Prob just the cheapest barrows tank legs, fighter torso, obby shield.
---
I think torags plate and legs are like 1m, obby shield like 300k. You could tank karils too at that point. Though veracs will always hit through prayer and defence.
---
Probably ideally you'd want veracs.skirt, and helm for additional prayer bonus but your prayers just gonna get drained anyways. So whatever you can afford. 
---
Agreed.Alright, exp waste these trees won't cut themselvea
---
Adorable I love it
---
Increase the size of the map and give unlimited or 0 prayer are 2 good starts in my opinion.
---
Man hackers are fucking nice these days
---
I'm not being a baby about anything though? And the game isn't difficult, just time consuming.

Pretty intolerant of you, bucko.

Thanks man, gonna get on to it now.

By completing the easy section of the Ardougne Achievement diary, outlined here on [the Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne_Diary) .
---
It was joke just thought it was cool to see someone else from Louisiana in here haha
---
Ehh. He said he used to play but recently started up again. And  i gave him runes so he could go kill dragons. He said he wanted to make money so I gave him a little something to help him get started on the grind. Cmon. Let’s not pretend we all haven’t accepted a little help from time to time 
---
The only thing it might do, is make it easier to spec when switching from a non spec bar weapon. But im unsure 
---
I tend to play Daggerfall when afking osrs. It's so ridiculous and a lot of the time I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going but it's a ton of fun. Good to see that TES got the graphical and UI upgrades it needed, before the series went to shit that is. 
---
You're an idiot and its a shame that self hating homosexuals like yourself make it even harder for us to come to a place of equality

That would be so ridiculously hard to code we would be guaranteeing no other content for the rest of the year but ok
---
I just got my bucket yesterday and agree that there's a noticeable difference between before and after. I was getting mid 60 herbs per run, now I'm hovering around 55. That sucks, I dumped a ton of compost in there :(
---
Okay thanks everyone I'm good now.
---
Thonx beb
---
Thonx beb appreciate it
---
Nice
---
Except there are plenty of extremely small non-stackable items, so the meta would just be to use one of those.
---
Which would make me noobier- Torture with Guardians or Fury with Prims
---
My longest drystreak was 1270 :)))))
---
Yeah, this is a good way to keep a lid on power creep
---
in that case you might as well slay in full proselyte, holy sandals, and holy wraps with an ardy cloak and fally shield 
---
Ok thanks for the help gonna try this out and see how things go.
---
whats good to afk at work after nmz then ',pro at afk skills at work?'
---
Hey thanks, I appreciate it :)
---
Do the depths of despair quest as soon as possible - this will get you access to the crabclaw caves where you'll always be able to find a sand-crab spot to train your combat. Get your combat to base 60s then kills green dragons to remake the bond money. Once you have base 70s you can start the recipe for disaster quest to go for barrows gloves long-term, also get a dragon defender. Start slayer once you have base 70 combat stats, once you have 70+ slayer you'll be able to make bond money in a few days from kurasks/wyverns/gargoyles.
---
*Literally*
---
I got a 55 on a calc 2 test and managed a B+ you can recover brother!
---
Halfway? I don’t see a single skill at 93
---
Well duh that’s like comparing tea to MDMA
---
Yeah the pray flicking necessity is just cancer. You can argue it brings a skill to the table but then you have to accept that less player count comes with it
---
congrats
---
When you hit 70 mage and range I'd def suggest getting a black salamander cause it can hit with magic, range, and melee and the ammo is only like 8 gp ea. 
---
Yeah, hating women on reddit doesn't count!
---
They still do stuff like this but it’s hard to find without being in popular twitch streams.
---
I am a osrs player. Also have a few episode ideas based around the game.
---
thank you friendo, you've just doubled my wasted time :D
---
Same. I'll do my more AFK stuff while I study for Paramedic. Then when I listen to lectures I'll do agility or AFK slayer. 
---
Or I like to put flips in, study, and then check my flips during breaks.

99-50 = 49.
---
49/7 = 7.
---
1/2^7 = .0078
---
This account is 0.78% maxed.  Wow that's way further from 99 than I thought it would be.
---
that’s not how max hits work
---
if it doesn’t round up to a max hit, say it calculates to like 40.75 instead of 40.25 
---
every time you roll it’s out of the .75 instead of .25 so you’ll hit your max hit more often 
---
it also adds up. If you trade the tassels or obby legs for v skirt you trade off more and more 
---
I'm one of the people that hated the gay pride event and I see nothing wrong with this, in fact I think it's great. It's not like they're adding unpolled shit to the game, they're just answering questions. More power to them, these are the types of events that they should be doing. In fact, all I see is people complaining that someone might complain about it, nobody actually complaining about it.
---
This just has to be satire. Dude just baited 40 people

This would make it so you couldn't effectively loot or enjoy drop parties tho.

Without a stylus the minimap is too small to accurately select your desired run position. Allowing a pinch zoom feature on the mini map would make it much more functional.

Steam runes are pretty sick. 5% less exp than Lavas, but steams sell for like 150gp per making them like 500k+ gp per hour. At 4k runes per hour you lose 2k exp per hour, but are at +520k instead of -80k. Lavas are only better than steams if you can make ~600k per 3 minutes.

I got my dumb ass pk'ed for an imbued slayer helm yesterday after getting smited with an amulet of avarice on .. it's just part of the game. If anything I think Jagex are doing good work getting PvMers into the wildy, because in the old days it used to be dead

---
that isn't how dps works in this game though, according to [this](http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?317,318,712,65587452) and [the dps spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=sharing). 
---
in the simplest case, the attacker and defender both roll a number between 1 and their max rolls for attack and defense respectively. if the attacker has the higher roll, then the damage is rolled from 1 to their max hit, and then they do that damage.
---
the rolls are evenly distributed, so technically, getting more strength for higher max hits actually reduces your chance to hit your max hit, since there will be more possible numbers. the important part is that your average damage per successful hit increases, and it only increases whenever you get a new max hit, since there are no partial hits.
---
you can check this yourself with the dps spreadsheet, which is our most accurate way to determine dps. make two sets the exact same except one is wearing bandos tassets and the other has obby legs, so the only difference is 1 strength bonus on gear. if that 1 strength bonus doesn't give you a higher max hit, then there's no difference in dps.
---
so, any strength bonus over what is necessary for a higher max hit does nothing for your dps.

Hey guys, is the preserve prayer bugged?
---
While barraging nechs it feels like it only works 1/4 of the time, and sometimes drops a boosted level off straight away.
---
can anyone share the mechanics?
---
This is your argument:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If clues become stackable, people will "hoard" them.
---
If people "hoard" clues, people will get endless amount of clues.
---
If people get endless amounts of clues, the few valuable clue items will tank.
---
How does "hoard\[ing\]" clues lead to an "endless amount of clues?" Are they going to put a clue scroll spawn where the twisted bow spawn used to be? People still have to go out and get them from monsters. It's not like they become a 100% drop.

The topic of gay rights is political. There is absolutely no two ways about this.

Something I never understood but my account has been cleaned of over 50m (may not sound like much but I barely play osrs and only do slayer) 3 times. Full authentication and everything. Still to this day just fathoms me. I just bought back bandos chest for 20m lol when I had it last time it was 10m

and thats why 75/25 polls are a terrible idea. 25.1% of the playerbase can hold the remaining 74.9% hostage. the reason they started splitting the pvp and pvm polls in my opinion is because of what happened with the spellbook filter not making the icons bigger because the pvp people didnt want that to happen, while pretty much everyone whos doing pvm did.
---
Current rs3 graphics are booty water
---
highly considering it, can't have thid level of exp waste

I don't think that's possible for me anymore sadly, would be the dream though.
---
What is actually going on with deadman mode now? Why is there only one world with less than 100 players? Do they still reset every so often? 
---
I looked in your post history but couldn't find out your post. Would you share it again /u/ac441113?
---
If you can do CoX or vorkath you can pk. Meta is magic short to ags gmaul. Nothing difficult about it.  To be average at pvp takes very little.  You die in 2 fights and claim there is a huge learning curve. How many times have you died learning CoX, or other pvm content? Much more Id wager.  
---
The difference is that due to the death mechanics never reverting back to what they used to be, has spoiled PvMers. There is no risk on death. Simply minor inconvenience.  When you die i  pvp it hits harder because it actually punishes you, its no more difficult than pvm. 
---
Fix death mechanics Jagex
---
because some people do not do them immediately, and now instead of having one clue after finishing slayer task or other activity they will have 5 of them.
---
Wouldnt there be a risk of cross contamination 
---
Gotta figure it's gonna be pulling the dmg and accuracy buff, add that to prayer and super pots, it's rarley going to miss and because of the massive window for potential damage the rolls will average to around 57 damage per hit, versus the average per hit of the whip being around a 27. Meaning that on average dh will pull an extra 10 dmg in the same timeframe a whip hits twice.
---
A
---
Not sure about the item sink factor.  I'd like an item like this to be able to be used on multiple items without having to choose one, and not limiting the fun trolling to the people with 20B banks
---
This was over the span of about 10 kills.
---
Learn to be nice and maybe society would notice you;*
---
Pretty sure J mods can already disguise themselves as items and monsters in the live game so I'm gonna say that's dubious.
---
if you wouldn't be such a bad pker it wouldn't be a problem
---
:(
---
Turn off hardware acceleration, there's a tutorial on runelite wiki 
---
The problem with runelite is if its not allowed explicitly the only difference is searching each step on the wiki which is slower but essentially the same thing, while runelite definitely makes more people do clues it's also inevitable in one way or another due to the clue mechanics
---
No
---
Everyone starts somewhere. The skill gap, so to speak, has always been higher for me relative to other players. F2P simple turn fighting is how I began, and they can do this too. Also it's rather easier if doing a non PvP task in the wilderness to just escape, and that's an art in and of itself, and one new players will have to get used to practicing as well.
---
I'll probably never be as good at multitasking and clicking as accurately as the top hybrid PKers, but I can hold my own in a low level setting, and I enjoy it. New players will find their place if they are serious about PKing.
---
This just can't excuse Jagex making contrived update after contrived update to "balance" things. Some I can understand, like the blowpipe (and even this is questionable), but creating special conditions for dozens of items old and new is becoming annoying for sure. If they can come up with some more mid-high-tier content with some interesting variety to spice up gameplay that's enough. It doesn't have to be overpowered in one area,..."BUT NOT Wildy oh no we're only half serious, it's gonna get nerfed in the wild." There are just too many seams in the work to look pretty. 
---
Why is trident not allowed in pvp btw. I never got that. I liked the polypore staff from RS2.
---
He was asking what your name in-game is so he could add you and you could compete on agility courses. He wasn't saying he knows your user.

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.
---
Just spend the money and get your construction up, best decision ever.
---
dont bring axe, u get one from raids. Also join "we do raids" discord and ask there under "gear" section.
---
The wiki doesn’t literally tell you every next move for a puzzle box. At least you’d have to find the clue you got.
---
Tell me the idea of a bucket of sand update wasn't met with extreme backlash
---
This is also a great method at dustdevils, u get bad exp for half ur task but fuck me is it great to watch them.
---
A what
---
No, they are not. The main reason to raise only strength would be to have a higher max hit while keeping a low combat level. The thing is - you cannot train strength without training hitpoints on F2P and there are no strength-based weapons such as the obby maul, which makes F2P strength pures easily outdamaged by pures training attack.
---
Besides, their accuracy is terrible. Despite what some of the others said, I fought with a 1 attack &amp; 80-something strength pure with my regular 1 defence pure and he just couldn't hit me most of the time. It seems that more than 50% of his hits were 0s. They are simply not viable.
---
Configurable right click delay would do for me.
---
Or an on-screen "right click" button
---
Don't go against the reddit hivemind, friend. They don't understand basic psychology and choose to be willfully ignorant :(

---
TzHaar thieving is REALLY good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhnN8fP-yt0  
---
My original comment was actually misleading though so that was my bad. TzHaar thieving is considered a better method because it's like 2x the XP/hr (260k+) of Master Farmers while still being &gt;600k gp/hr, but Master Farmers are better gp/hr at like 900k-1m.
---
there are 3 different kinds of deadman mode. permanent deadman mode has been around since it was first released. this server never resets.
---
then there's seasonal deadman mode. this goes on for a few months and then resets.
---
at the end of the seasonal deadman mode, if you are in the top 2k ranked players, you are elligible for the deadman mode tournament. this is a week long and at the end there's a crazy battle royale kinda thing. jagex streams it and it's a whole big event.
---
🙄
---
I would be 100% ok with a graphical update. Also, prayer animations similar to curses would be raw.
---
Unpopular opinion: Many of runelites features should be banned. I really don’t think people understand how much easier they make the game, and it does it in such an artificial way.
---
shit
---
haha fuck pkers, it's just a joke dude haha, but really, fuck pkers haha, jk
---
Hey man, glad to see you make such a great achievement! the last 50 levels is where the grind starts but you got this!
---
I mean I dont hate the females but why include them in the game?
---
After you get the cape look into completing Fairy Tale I and the first half of Fairy Tale II. Doing so unlocks access to the Fairy Rings which are a great travel system all over Runescape. The Ardougne cape teleport puts you just west of a Fairy Ring, making this combination very strong for quick travel. 
---
Absolutely 
---
straight from the wiki:
---
Contrary to other prayers, Preserve does not grant an immediate effect; it needs to be activated at least 15 seconds before the next stat drain, whereupon it extends the boost by 30 seconds assuming it is not deactivated. Flicking Preserve thus provides no benefit.
---
I use runelite but runelite should be banned tbh. At least have a lot of it’s features culled.
---
Opening my canvas app fills me with anxiety each time man D: I feel you bro

Awesome thanks for the response! Do clans still kind of own the one that never resets? I remember when it first came out they would camp certain quests and pk people. 
---
I hope we get a graphical update soon
---
Promoting a specified group of people rather than rallying all people around a specified goal that effects everyone is identity politics.
---
I know, everybody likes to categorize themselves In some sort of movement at the moment, but that doesn't make it any less harmful to society. 
---
When people promote rights because of who those rights affect, rather than how those rights help everybody, tyranny becomes all but inevitable.

I need 49 more QP to reach 175 and finish rfd. Are there any "essential" quests I should be doing to make my life easier? I've got all the F2P quests done and all the required quests minus dt. 
---
2010 graphics would be great.
---
The problem is that these updates are actually good for the game and the user experience, but wouldn’t pass a poss if included in PvP. 
---
I think there shouldn’t be any updates that affect PvM but not PvP, but because the dedicated PvP community is so adamant against change, this is what they sadly have to do. 
---
The skill gap is a bigger problem in this game than it is any other game. People have been pking with this games mechanics since 2004. That’s nearly 15 years of perfecting combat, there NEEDS to be changes to PvP in some way that slightly negates this gigantic advantage. 
---
Why is your screenshot blurry? Are you using stretched mode in Runelite?

Am I meant to be taking so much damage on zulrah? I’m learning on the unrestricted worlds using the rotation pictures that are everywhere but I feel like they’ve very vague about where to stand in a certain section of the “u” so sometimes the blowpipe pulls me into the fog or the fog hasn’t gone away when I go to rotate.
---
Also if theres a guide that lets me select the rotation I’m using to my 12IQ brain doesn’t have to get distracted by stuff below or above it that would be sick.

Originally just wanted to get the Western Hard diary done but seeing as I haven’t died yet I might want to actually do some kills here and there.

Dude I'm a btw that went to UK too! Big oof on you making me relive that.
---
Oh no. Do we tell him? /s
---
How much more xp an hour is blowpipe, to say it’s too expensive is subjective to how much people are willing to spend, either way nice write up, precise and to the point 
---
God such good memories, especially before the guide price, there was some seriously interesting trading going on
---
The funny thing is most people, when i say most i mean the vast majority, dont really do clues. I myself do pretty much every clue i stumble upon, but i see a lot of players with very low clue count, yet this passes, i bet most of these players still wont do clues, because they dont have the requirements or cant bother. Runelite and osb have made it a ton easier, a lot of people struggle a lot with puzzles for example, but i dont see the upside of this.
---
Personally i hate doing skotizo because its essentially just clue after clue after clue. Getting 1-2 clues each task is great, doing clues for an hour sucks.
---
I just dont understand why this passes when atleast 80% of everyone who voted yes has less than 50 clues completed.
---
Lmfao I hate PKers and this still makes me want to go PK your ass
---
Man I can pretty much tank anyone as long as I have 42 pray
---
U just have to get good at evading and pick better worlds or go a different route
---
I have literally killed thousands of kbds and barely ever run into problems
---
I absolutely hate this. I don't know how it's passing polls. I can't think of worse game design because from a player standpoint. Imagine getting to grips with a feature only for the exact same feature to behave completely different in arbitrarily chosen other parts of the same game. 
---
Imagine doing lots of PVM. Then wanting go into some PvP. So gear up with your spec weapon and anglerfish. Only to have them not overheal you like you expect them to. And clicking the spec orb for fuck all to happen. All of which with no explanation unless you happen to have read the relevant patch notes potentially months ago when the content was changed. Absolutely maddening. 
---
I have no idea if this is the case, but in the off chance that it is some sort of issue with your internet service provider you could try connecting through a VPN.
---
200iq play, then you get banned and won't be distracted from school anymore
---
Or kill the game overnight, definitely leaning more toward that.
---
I fucking loved this period of the game but it wouldn’t happen today
---
Actually it was [$13.3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjtZGjI29Qc) lol
---
Imaging people pking at legit the only active spot in the entire wilderness for brid fights. Shame on them.
---
Yeah I'd be pissed. RS3 graphics are shit. 
---
Im from louisiana owo
---
1000iq comment tho
---
Thank you! I’ll keep my eyes peeled for any re-sales. If you do decide to make another slayer pin please keep me in mind. :)
---
I love this meme. Human decisions are always clouded by bias
---
I’m gonna bite the bullet tommorrow and buy a trial to a good VPN and see if that works, if you know of any good ones, would be appreciated! Thanks
---
Get good 
---
You don’t, if you got hacked you in some way gave your information out or someone found it.
---
That's the joke.

Hello my name is Calcletics, my calculus only ultimate ironman. After recently passing algebra on my main account I decided to up the ante and forge my own jounry from scratch. No studying, no cheating but this time i need to integrate. All leading up to one Calculus' biggest challenges: Trig Substitution. 
---
Hell yeah this is relatable as fuck lmao
---
dump a ton of serotonin on it 
---
Since when does it take 18hours to get lova favour
---
Imagine doing what the wilderness is interested for. Omgggggg how dare they!!!
---
I think the concern is more the time between obtaining the clue and doing the clue. Having to regear can be annoying, especially for bosses and the like, but going from PvM gear to Clue gear, then back to PvM gear can take time. But if you can stockpile 5 clues, you cut out 4 of those back and forths and that is where clues would speed up. Personally, I don't see it being too significant of an increase in the grand scheme, but it is a thing...
---
Wright State University? Happened here lmao.
---
People who get triggered by people thinking we should treat LGBT people like human beings should just fuck off. 
---
Can she spare any coochie?
---
Lol he actually learned stuff in school what a nerd
---
When im a lvl 120 with full bandos and tell people I have to train construction for the new quest.
---
Lol dw bud got my first ones at 600. Now at 2.5k clues with 12 rangers luck turns around 
---
Shut up bwanar
---
It's not nice, when someone hijacks an accout, they take all the GP and sell the account. The untradeables give them more value.
---
Nada
---
When upgrading PoH stuff like pools or jewellery boxes, do you need to have the actual items or are noted items okay?
---
Baguettics?
---
Just give them a fruit that restores a flat +5.
---
dude i’ve been fucking laughing at this for so long lmao this is great
---
Brainlet posting hours.
---
Overrated reply
---
If your combat average with them was 115 then yeah you shouldnt get too many less pre update.
---
XDDD ITS LE FUNNY BECAUSE 92 ARE AN HALF OF 99 IN ROONSKAPE
---
Yeah for real even if it was stackable to 3 each would be fine.
---
Same 
---
You say that, but lucky specs and combos can drop pretty much anyone. Stuff like Ice Barrage into AGS and G Maul can do high amounts of damage and it isn't uncommon to catch players off guard, especially when they are just passing through the Wilderness like that.
---
It can be quiet tedious for sure, on main i just did lavas to 79 to make boost easier, but its a few hours extra of rc, not really worth if youre not going for the other diarys. You can also start bloods from 77 if you prefer afk, and maybe get a lvl or 2 that way to make boost easier. Personally hate getting +5 boosts
---
[Can confirm](https://i.imgur.com/LArju5L.png), but Jagex actually eventually unbanned me - 2 years later...
---
Honestly, people like /u/Trench_Rat made me wonder if I was the only person to ever be falsely banned for botting back when I was trying to get support for this lol
---
I’m there with you bro, 2 heads, many whips, and a whole lotta nothing else
---
1/250 drop chance for a 36m item on medium clues. Sounds like a nice reward to me
---
I hope they look into this. It was a staple of pre-eoc f2p and p2p alike
---
I hate bwaners
---
It just blows my mind people who do wilderness content are pissed people kill them in the wilderness. Pking is fun for people regardless of loot so that's not even a reason. 
---
Good, lore friendly username
---
It makes perfect sense because the PvP aspect of the game becomes difficult to balance without completely redoing the whole system.
---
We are playing a game where bis was addy armor, and you couldn't use range within melee distance. When the engine transfered over you could tell they didn't account for the game going past 40 defence. When they got to around 70's in melee stats the flaws in our dice based 3d converted table top game became very apparent.
---
The thing is pvm doesn't have to adhere to to the same form of balance that PvP needs. Where you there when blowpipe was not nerfed for PvP? You could of out damage people tick eating before they fixed it the next day.
---
We can afford to have that in pvm cause you can still add more defence stats, and hp to monsters. You can still scale up.
---
With PvP we can't scale up anymore without addressing the same issues that eoc set out to fix. And there isn't a "real" solution because we are playing a broken game. It doesn't feel broken, cause that's the way we always knew it to be. But If you compare it to any percentile based scaling "perfect balance" game, we are just fucking wacky.
---
Yeah your probably right. However the effect might be seen as too strong if it just always increased run regen.
---
This was 30 into. A Wyrms task look at the good times too! And three medium the helms!
---
100k kill, absolute bank
---
Isn't w45 just a 5x exp private server basically?
---
I'll agree that certain things you need to have chat open for, like fighting Olm. Aside from that I can't think of many other bosses that you have to have chat for where there aren't any other signs. If vorkath turns off your prayers, that huge fucking protect prayer over your head is gone. The attack is brightly colored, like what more do you need. 
---
Huge first world problem here.
---
Lol cant wait...
---
Ayee got my first at the same kc
---
I can't hear you over my fucking freedom.
---
P sure that Wyrms are the best to kill for keys since you can literally 3 hit em with dhl. Alongside gargoyles. Really good task.
---
Adequately rated return statement
---
Don't let em.
---
i laughed like a fucking maniac in public, thanks op
---
You know someone knows their pixel art when they put the palette's name in the title

It is the best house layout design by far.

I wonder of I lost mine when I died to hespori. Gonna have to check that later.

For vorkath absolutely
---
If you think Albion online PvP is hard go play Minecraft and lmk how it goes for you.
---
Hey. Watch that hard r.
---
Thanks for the flips, just out my offer in for 1gp more than you.
---
I got 1 or two in the last 3k kill :( I feel you
---
What was that hide n seek garys mod game that people used to play? Could be a fun playermade minigame. 
---
Well. I know what I’m doing tomorrow at work. 
---
So good for keys and so much fun for mid levels!
---
Of course and my idea is add a guthix battlestaff to the konar drop table at double the odds of dusk mystic, combine it with a void mace, and now we got the staff of balance.
---
"Everyone that didn't like pride event was a homophobe!"
---
There's a reason nobody takes you people seriously anymore.
---
Ok. But when your fun infringes on my fun of the game I'm allowed to hate you too. :)
---
Even if no xp id wouldnt play castle wars
---
Kek i used to play competitive Minecraft PvP, no joke. "Minecraft Hardcore Games". High school was a good time.
---
I love the “we” shit they all say.
---
Is that why you're crying? 
---
LMAO
---
Why would I be crying when I have your loot? gg please come again.
---
Gotcha so we should just have polls where only you can vote.
---
Right? I've been pked so many times doing bone runs in the wildy, I have never gave a single fuck. I'd have to get pked every other inventory for it not to be worth doing. 
---
Not to mention the fun of pking at revs with mates and getting cleared by a clan. 
---
Cringe buzzword
---
&gt;The gown can be reobtained from this cupboard at any point if lost
---
This is a novice level quest bro.
---
Ah fair enough, carry on 
---
Come on man, he's a content creator and people have been keeping up him
---
Yeah you can log right back in
---
No. He explained the situation to the cops and nothing happened. From this point on; i'm guessing he's just trying to find the time to do things and possibly deal the ex drama on the side since there's still a kid in all of this.
---
I believe his plans were to move back to his home country and then continue making video's &amp; stream.
---
The privilege word. Bulig yikes.
---
I had a friend go with me with the ess and I dropped all the stews and traded him real quick. Rune pouches could also work 
---
There are quite a few guides out there, they usually involve Plank Make for mahogany, Superglass Make, and Tan Leather (requires Fremennik Hard).
---
Ok then why even take the time making this post. Kbd being in a safe area would lower profit and most pkers know that eventually one idiot is bringing bank loot so they’re going to attack anyone. That’s why they’re there. Nobody is taking the time to analyze your every piece of gear before they barrage you, they see a pvmer going to kbd they attack, you could have thousands of bolts atleast. 
---
You can toggle that effect btw
---
Since when did pkers need an incentive to kill anyone?
---
Do you know if you can drop rune pouches without a warning or anything? I can just check when I get home if you don’t know
---
What if they just made BigRedJapan run along courses perfectly, since he's already on the Al-Kharid course.
---
That look he gives you when he’s coming soon
---
It really be like that sometimes tho :(
---
Issa joke. People need to lighten up.
---
Is amulet of the damned for the certain barrows bonuses ever worth using over a fury or anguish or occult ? 
---
We use those polycom phones at work. Fuck them so hard. 
---
Use alt to loot then. PK anywhere but edge and you should get most of the shit
---
what about your soft phone?
---
Holy mackerel this is a good suggestion
---
Another good question is who even asked you?
---
when was the last time you played ftp
---
This is cringe as shit..
---
Well, I’m sure that’s easily avoidable (not sure how). And I wouldn’t even mind if I didn’t get the players equipment. Maybe if it dropped other things, like supplies to help with training skills/things that you will need/etc. 
---
that'd be if he both gets it and does not get it until he makes a measurement by opening the casket :P
---
Did you make this account and level all these up just to make a reddit post?
---
I cant stop laughing LOL
---
&gt; but I'm worried I'd have to do every new quest that comes out.
---
Well... I got bad news for you; that is exactly how it works. The cape unequips and you cannot reequip it until you have max Quest Points again.
---
Speak to Jerico, get bird seed from cupboard.
---
Follow up quest for Cold War?
---
I want full mouse support with the classic desk top layout. 
---
Mobile runs smoother on a 100 dollar smart phone then a 400 dollar stock PC from Walmart. 
---
I can output to HDMI, and use Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for about another 100 dollars for the accessories. 
---
Just make them unusable in pvp. Trident is already like this. 
---
Taste Vengeance!
---
The dopamine 😩
---
Is that the Canvas app?
---
The game shouldn't be balanced and developed around third party clients.
---
Do you tend to wear gear and carry an inv while woodcutting?
---
Fuck you. I came here to say that. :C
---
The requirement is always to complete all currently released quests.  When a new quest comes out, you can't equip it or use the teleport until you finish it.
---
It won't disappear, and if you're wearing it at the time of the update it'll just go to your inventory.
---
That is a great point though.
---
TBH, the worst part is the green boots... Pretty sure Teal boots are a thing in RS3 too.
---
Am I retarded? I don't see it. 
---
Sorry, but NO. 
---
Devalues my Chat Only ultimate ironman account.
---
How about ban every 3rd party client so everyone can play the game like it was meant to be played?
---
🤔
---
Just buy low, sell high *duh*
---
The point of doing clues is for money and this mostly loses money
---
Gzzz M8 
---
Lumberjack and teleport jewelry 
---
I agree the nmz is corny but I just avoid it all together and play to achieve the goals I’ve had since I first started playing, like 99 woodcutting and getting barrows armor 
---
Unpopar opinon BtW
---
The puzzle box plug in alone took my hard clues from like 30 mins to 15 seconds...
---
You can teleport to lumby in those worlds though
---
You wouldnt get crashed successfully by a void ranger if you have Arma and blowpipe. Only thing that beats blowpipes dps at bandos is a scythe.
---
Then there's no reason to oppose it that I can think of.
---
So why did it fail when it affected PvP, but passed when it didn't?
---
People around the world! Join hands!
---
It's fun to pk and that's the reason the wilderness is there. You never know what someone has on them, I've seen a black dhide scrub drop an ACB on the way to kbd. Pkers are there to pk and if you go into the wildy expecting to be safe or not get killed then that's on you as far as I'm concerned. Also if they're toxic you can add them to your ignore list or you can turn public off in the wildy if you're that concerned.
---
We're noobs unfortunately :( Don't have bills to spare
---
What?! I always make it a point to troll them into oblivion 
---
I didn't know anyone under the age of 20 plays this game anymore
---

This is fucking adorable
---
No one was doing herbivore while runelite was down 
---
This is the farming contracts fault.
---
Yeah seems more like a vocal minority then anything else. Its clue scroll stacking to 5 max like is it really doing anything negative. 
---
Yeah you gotta prayer flick, be on task and bring blood spells. 
---
If you just stand in the corner and pray mage then yes 2 kills a trip.
---
5 1/128’s and 2 shards is pretty lucky in his KC
---
Oh ok
---
Took me a second to realize what was going on in this post. My grades definitely suffered due to gaming but I still managed B average. You must find a balance. Priorities. 
---
That's a fair opinion, but at the end of the day we're here to have fun and play how we want to as long as we're not breaking rules. If Jagex has a problem with runelite and they ask them not to do certain things, then so be it, but I find it more fun so I'm going to use it.

What’s not a conspiracy is I’m down 350k because of the roll back

This was the update that made me quit rs2

---
It took me two tries. All that matters is you get it done :) I struggled with math my whole life.
---
my next goal is to be able to do vorkath and not struggle right now my combats are all 75+ prayer is 70 so doing ds2 was the hardest task ive had and still no fire cape which made it even harder :P
---
Which circles back to “may not always work, but doesn’t mean I won’t try”. Your reading comprehension is bad and you can’t seem to understand the bigger picture without getting your feelings hurt. Maybe stop investing so much thought process on me while taking your shits because it’s looks like it’s affecting you a little too much. 
---
Was heading to mage bank with nothing but a knife for the web the other day and someone pked me.  Literally got nothing out of it lol.

Made a fucky wucky! A wittle fucko boingo!

What's nmz?

I actually didn't!

same for me, I didn't even have to study much outside of lectures for diffeq because the professor was so good
---
spoiler alert: he didn’t
---
you do know that there is sandpit near a house portal at yanille right? and that you can toggle „outside” option on house tele? amf you wont believe it, you wont even need to hop!
---
Nooe i never really did  :( joined a pking clan and left a week or so after as i didnt like it. I made a defence tank though soon after and am really liking it, almost base 50 skills and currently 65 defence :)
---
Nice, proud of you

Counterpoint: block hellhounds unless you are doing Cerberus. They are terrible in every way.

You will gain the same or more zulrah teleports as drops if you can get more than 2.5 kills per trip or so, so if it seems that you can get 3 kill trips more often than not you shouldn't have to buy more from the GE

I feel you. Never had a 99 before until last weekend. I always thought there would be 50 people there spamming chat, but it was just me and a goblin and my godsword
---
I'm pretty sure it's BIS for the attacker role in Barbarian Assault. I know the leeching clan uses them.
---
Yeah, go bang that fire cape out when/ if you get a toxic blowpipe. Will take serious effort, but it rewards you in the end.
---
You're a fucking moron, there's no point in discussion because you're an ignorant. 1 nature 5 fire runes etc.
---
It just blows my mind people who pk are pissed people vote no to pvp content. Pvming is fun for people regardless of the quality of PVP so that's not even a reason.
---
I know that comes off snarky but you have to realize that the exact same line of thought exists for Pvmers. We vote no to things that will make our experience shittier. There's a sort of natural and unchangeable dichotomy between the two groups, and PVP just so happens to be the less popular/less accessible side of it.
---
You say: "No, I have the option to kill you, and I have fun killing you, so I wont stop. Even if that makes your experience worse."
---
JUST LIKE we say: "No, I have the option to hinder your ability to kill me, and I have fun killing KBD and not getting attacked, so I wont stop voting no. Even if that makes your experience worse."

---
Ironmen in fact cannot gain hp exp from other players, making them perfect for low hp rushing pures
---
It's necessary, there are two metas to balance. Both have powercreep but for way different reasons. MOST weapons in rs are useless/speedbumps for PVM but are used in builds for PVP.
---
It's having a cat and a dog in your house, they eat and poop different things.
---
Thanks for explaining some of the issues.
---
I see that about the lance now that I have looked up its stats, so I agree it does seem it can be a substitute for the hasta especially since it does so well at Olm. Thanks for that tip I might pick one up.
---
I get what you're saying about void, but my own experience is I have about 300 solo kc and I can't remember the last time I ran out of brews with void. Idk I find once you learn all the tricks for minimzing damage it isn't that much of an issue. Muttas hurt but if you pray flick range/mage and and augury I find its not too bad. Tightrope is a brew or two but its not too bad either. Also I was assuming he can't afford an arma/bandos setup, so using dhide and no str bonus seems like it wouldn't be much better dps. 
---
I'm guessing lake brings the ammy because he isn't at all worried about running out of brews, since as you said he's one of the best in the game. The OP however is just learning so I made that recommendation to save him a space.
---
I should have been more clear about bringing robes I didn't mean using void mage for olm that is of course awful. 
---
Anyway thanks for explaining, that helps clear things up for me and hopfully OP and others who read this.
---
yup got caught with all his loli porn gg pedo
---
Just so you know I'm 99.99999% sure marks will appear whether you fail or not. Failing has no factor on them appearing for you. There was a video a while ago showing where if you wait something like 5 minutes... And then jump to the next  specific obstacle... A mark would appear, unless it's been patched. Keep up the grind you'll get there mate.

I go to UK too small world lolo😂 I had Calc 2 last semester it was rough at first but I got a B. Did you get Yip or is she even teaching it (hope you don’t have Brown)

Rest in peace OSRS economy...
---
Check all the other brothers, one of them will have the tunnel, go in it.
---
oh! yeah i've heard about that. but no, i'm in quebec
---
Same here! Hope it gets fixed soon!
---
Yeah, just like every RS video ever. 
---
There are some already. Youtube them.
---
&gt;would have to go about pvp updates differently :)
---
Bruh, if you think that means anything other than PvP updates will simply hardly ever happen because Jagex has bigger things to worry about than if an update is balanced or not, you're much to optimistic. You might get ONE Jmod to focus on a pvp update once in a while, so I'll see you in a few years when your first update comes out and it either gets nerfed to shit because of either the pvp community itself or the rest of the game's playerbase.
---
I did 135 chests in the past 3 days and it wasn't in this month's patch notes. There's a significant delay idk how you could ever not notice it. 
---
&gt;but who gives a fuck? 
---
...people who do clues and don't want rewards to go down in price due to an influx of clues.
---
331 was a hosting world but I guess there was house drama (what even is that?) so now the guy hosts on 332 *sometimes.* They're unreliable worlds. 
---
Also congrats, I've only seen a few people who farm hops and are aware of that profit. That is all I do at 85 farming so outside of doing snapegrass for an extra \~50k exp per run you've got it down solid. 
---
TONE

The bane of all voip support staff

tbh runelite itself spoils the game in many ways lol

---
I just turn off everything except drop filter and boss down timers. The gpu plugins are so nice. 
---
1. 318 I believe.
---
2. Do fruit trees too, you'll get higher farming which in turn will make you harvest more herbs.  
---
     For extra crops, you could check out jangerberry bushes, and seaweed.
---
Pvp worlds are +/- 15 levels. You’d be ragged by a lot of msb to ags’ers with piety but bh is a little better. And yes those builds would be the main opponent so I would suggest doing ballista into g maul since it’s lower risk with really good dps. Obv you could switch it up with d bow/arma cross or if you don’t feel like risking just an msb to gmaul would bully any pure on pvp worlds. Be careful with building the account as the piety miniquest gives 20k att/str/def/hp xp and is a pretty late stage quest.  
---
And just an fyi I’m maxed piety with 75 attack and there was often a guy I would fight in bh with this build who lost to me 9/10 (this was back when I had around 93 strength and we would we get matched up). Msb to ags 1 tick is so unbelievably broken sometimes that if you do this build I would avoid fighting anything like my build unless you’re up for the challenge. 
---
combat bracelet is a cheap, good non-quest option. rfd seems daunting but just start doing quests and you'll be done before you know it.
---
every time he thonx someone
---
It's not either/or though, there should be a happy medium. The OG client doesn't need sliders to be solved for you but it should have some basic features like boost timers and ground item identification.
---
Jokes on you I have 32 construction and no money

I like the plate and shield better. The helm is okay and the legs would be too of not for the sash thing
---
You too! :)

you can store the set in the poh magic armor case which you probably wanna have anyawy to conserve bank space
---
Probably, yeah.

People get mad that they get killed after knowingly going to a PvP area.

Sucks to suck

Fun fact, if you buy a ship, go to it, use a water walking effect, and walk in a certain direction, you walk directly to the final dungeon of Daggerfall.  They put them in the same map!

I like to think he has a BP equipped
---
I mean, most of the pvp updates are direct buffs to the ability to kill people.  If you're a pvper, that sounds like a great thing to you, yeah I'd love to be able to kill my targets more easily.  But if you're a pvmer who only goes into the wildy to do content that they have no other options for, why would you ever support that?
---
If I'm a PvMer, you have to seriously convince me that "make it harder to escape from pkers" is something that I want to vote for.
---
Make sure you've got Guthan's on your final
---
no meme i think osrs is a good game if you follow the quest stories and really get into your character
---
most people just play it to grind numbers though
---
Fuck canvas 
---
When im farming rev imps in full monks robes with a dscim, neiz helm, and a defender what fucking logic does a PKer use to kill me?  Im CLEARLY not risking, im CLEALRY not going to lose anythign when i die, but they still TB me, then smite me, while alternating between ancients and ranged attacks with their clan, do not tell me that they arent doing it to troll.
---
That's what the pkers objecting to this thinks.
---
Spoken by someone how has clearly never gotten into pvp nor been apart of in the the past year. People dont have to go deep in max or fight bh prods in edge to learn. People learn muscle memory fighting pvmers and lesser leveled pkers or by pking with a team and clearing rev pvmers or other teams. Since starting with a clan and moving into all types of singles pking, i have always made profit. I am up 500m in a few months. I have watched 100s of clueless noobs learn the basic and then actually get good. The pvp is dead or the pvp is hard to get into is straight lies fed to people by people who have no fucking idea what theyre talking about.
---
Kc?
---
I use that same phone at work!  With the expansion module of course :D
---
I definitely got mods because certain times it gets unplayable with how buggy it is. Also I wanted to be faster since the map is so friggin huge. I'll check out what you said though lol
---
I like to grind my skills for questing, i really wanted cave horrows for my ironman so i needed 50 smithing still for cabin fever and i needed 40  farming and 47 prayer for rum deal, so i just ground it all out, i like to mix it up
---
It was glorious because I was using it to test custom backgrounds and one of the ladies from the office came in and was like oh my goodness is that your child oh my God

Taking Calc 2 right now as well. Failed the first test with a 42%. Trying my ass off to prepare for the second in a week and a half.

Canvas is such a hot garbage piece of software

Tbh I thought having it in rs3 was great for this reason.  Until I realized I had the maxed amount of hard clues and got super lazy to do them. 
---
Come where? I think you meant "Cum"
---
actual a good idea. 
---
Having come from RuneScape 3, for me, smoother animations versus choppy or static ones helps my eyes. I remember playing RuneScape back in 2007, but I never actually realized how bland everything was. I was definitely doped up on serotonin, haha. I have to have some sort of help with this, and that feature saves Old School for me.
---
So now you’re going to tell him what he should shouldn’t even enjoy?
---
Getting on and seeing that felt worse then getting hacked for bank
---
Do you think shilo is good even without the hard diary completed? (No access to the underground mine). It would take a while for me to get 50s on things like agility.. I will try iron for a while tho, ty 
---
Ooo, that's a nice layout, I might use that myself. I have a couple extra rooms for storage and stuff, so I'll have to tweak it.
---
What I did was write down everything I needed for each piece before I bought anything. Then I went through the list buying and storing the stuff in the order I was going to build the pieces. Just build them based on what level is the highest. So finish the nexus, bank, then the jewelry box, bank, then the pool and the occult. Use ring of dueling for a quick tele next to a bank chest, and make sure you have house teles to get back. I did a dry run to make sure it would all work inventory space wise before I started trying to boost. With preserve and a nicely organized materials section in your bank you should have plenty of time to build everything.
---
There are some pieces that need to be built on the previous tier (All of them actually if I remember correctly, but double check that), so make sure you have everything built up to the point where they're ready to be finished with the boost. Learned that the hard way with the Nexus. I reccomend building the dark altar as the base for the occult  since it takes 5 items to build that while the others only take 4. Saves an inventory space for the upgrade.
---
To build the maxed portal nexus you'll need 84 construction before boosting, so if you want it to be maxed you'll need one more level. It's also pretty dang expensive to build all the tiers and then add the teleports (5m to build to max, 10m to add every teleport), so make sure that's something you're ready to pay for. You also can't boost your magic for the nexus, so any high level teles like the ghorrock tele (96 magic) can't be added with the aid of say an imbude heart boost. Don't worry about adding the teleports till after, you don't need the construction boost to add teles.
---
I also recommend adding a wilderness obelisk to your plan. With the wildy hard diary done it can be very useful for getting in to the wilderness, and it basically save you the money of adding an annakarl and ghorrock tele to the nexus since there are obelisks right next to those teles.
---
I like the RS3 art, but I have no idea what half of the basic items are by looks.
---
Ah thank you for the reply. The issue is just that it is difficult to find someone willing to trio when I have low kc, so I guess I'm stuck with the we do raids 10 man raids until I get some. More kc
---
Ah yes this is the answer I was looking for thanks mate!! 
---
Tried Barrows for the first time yesterday and have since completed ~100 chests. Only just now starting to answer that one correctly. I have a hard time depicting it as well, and typically get interrupted by an attack.

I hope you gave that man a mil he earned it

when you are too lazy to create an original meme so you rely on the wojaks

Yeah thats how I did it, it shouldn’t be too hard to get learner raids together. After that, when you have like 10kc it gets really easy to get one together.
---
I recommend learning mage side first, when you’re confident there, move onto melee, confident there, move to running head.
---
Each role is different and teaches you a different aspect of the fight you can put together into running, which is honestly piss easy and really stress free despite looking like the hardest part.

Here we observe a level 102 ranging with adamant gloves. 
---
:\ What'd I do?
---
It's not lol, I can't stand questing, way too much walking (which I hate) and the other skills usually require a bit more attention or huge setups. Mining is just god tier, you dump everything on your bank, go to dwarf mine and just mine away. Doesn't matter if you're lvl 20 or 85, you just go and do it.
---
I tried to get into combat, but turns out I have to play a minigame I don't like to get the fighter torso, a billion long quests (monkey madness, lost city) with requirements I do not meet and monsters I can't kill to get some other stuff, it's just too overwhelming man(never played RS before). I rather just go and mine period.
---
Calc 2 is as bad as it gets, the rest is easy
---
I swear to god it just makes you want copy and paste stfu over and over to them. If they think their voices are being heard wait until you take pvp or the wildy away. This entire subreddit will melt the fuck down and the cannons + retribution prayers will go up for a month fucking straight.
---
They think because they can type on Reddit that somehow their asinine drivel is somehow meaningful. Like they're the type of people to expect a local league to change the rules to accommodate them. "I can't participate in that tournament on Sundays because I believe in God, I'm going to blow this up on Twitter until you change it to a Tuesday like I requested". Ignoring the fact 250 other people have signed up for that Sunday and have no issue. 
---
But seriously if your the type of player who thinks Reddit is an avenue to bitch about open world pking in OSRS please do us a favor and quit. Just go play some other game because you clearly have no idea how this one works and are taking advantage of open polling to change it into something it isn't.
---
The issue with this is that the art team will have to create an art model for every single item you want displayed, and while it may be as simple as adding an already existing item, inside another, it will still take way more effort than they deem fit.
---
It's an 86k loss per hard clue on average (not including clue loot) via magpie implings. Also, being expensive doesn't make it not the best method to obtain clues.
---
No he's not lol, I've seen this guy multiple times and he drops bonds for name changes every day and is doing the same scam trick every day where he tries to condition you to trade faster and faster until you finally fall for his scam.

I think you need to go back and read the original parent comment again. That wasn't the point.

Rs3 economy right now is healthier than osrs economy and it has much less pvp
---
Not at all man! Don't get me wrong assembler is super good and you should try to get it eventually but it shouldn't stop you from getting your ass handed to you a few times learning olm haha
---
Yes.
---
Why would you say that?
---
last I heard it was at near the lowest possible priority for the devs.
---
Shouldn’t you be blowpiping then. It’s more dps than act. You would be having much more fun
---
this really specific 
---
Hit me hard in the feels
---
And that is single handily due to the invention skill, the economy was in shambles before it got released due to the non existent pkers.
---
The unfortunate reality is that they don't want another rs3 and can't risk it
---
Completely agree with you nonetheless, take Valve for example - the only game they have that's still running strong is Dota 2, which is like the poster child for Creative Agency in a video game. Yeah it's swamped with cosmetics and other Valve shit but there's still that light behind the eyes.

What jebus said is correct. It's a global Timer, so if you Boost with 10 seconds left on that timer then activate preserve you're still going to drop a level in 10 seconds. If you Boost as soon as the Timer resets you get the full boost, if you Boost as soon as it resets then activate preserve you get the full effect + preserve.

I never said it was. What i said was there shouldn't be any new rings that will outclass the DKS/Wildy Rings in terms of stats. 
---
If there was going to be a BiS ring, ideally it should be something that combines the 3 DKS rings and the 2 Wildy rings that offer +8 to all combat bonuses - and it would probably require a item from a future end-game content.  But that would devalue the brimstone ring unless it has a different passive effect.

The word that shall not be named. Why dont you just write it out, you're already communicating the word to begin with. That is real cowardice.
---
"Prevailing ideology", just like democracy, in theory 51% ruling over the other 49%. In practise  more like the 30-40% ruling over the 60-70%. I hope you dont mean "prevailing" as in the most valid based on numbers.
---
And they still don't look right. The skirts are weirdly longer and there may be more issues, can't remember as I haven't played in a long time.
---
You literally cherry picked something you personally want to make the game safer for you, a pvmer. You also admitted to voting no to things that don't personally benefit you and stated that you only want updates that encourage PvP.
---
So basically there is no PvP update you will vote for unless it personally makes the wildy a *safe place ™ .* 
---
You know what, you're right. 
---
Here's what we should really do, make it so that only people who agree to fight with you can pvp. So basically when you try and attack someone they should then have to type in their password and confirm they want to fight you. If you don't want to fight then you don't type in your password and instead get what is called a 45 second head start. 
---
So because the pker open to attack you they will not be frozen in place and have TB + skull. You also instantly get protect item, it even persists through smite for 5 minutes. Thankfully your prayer and run energy are also given a 50% less consumption per minute thanks to your PvP protection.
---
If you want to attack the pker who skulled on you, during the 45 seconds they are frozen they also aren't allowed to eat or protect item for balance. You're also given any prayers they have access too permanently, sweet free rigour!
---
If you agree to pk then you'll both be transported to the duel arena where you can then pk with gold only. If you walk by another person in the wildy who doesn't try to attack you and you also ignore him you will both get 250k gp and a free pet out of the available pets you don't have because you were nice to each other. At the end of your session then you should be able upvote your favorite person who was near you in the wildy and they'll get what is called honor points.
---
If you turn in 2 honor points you get one free carry through Raids 1 or 2 and a garaunteed chance at a drop.

Dick in the usb port. Works every time.

which game did it go to shit with?

You missed the person you are replying to whole point. Its  if he/she was a pvmer why would they vote yes to something that allows pvpers to kill them faster?

Your argument of dont go in the wilderness is just a strawman

Is Vorkath hard to learn? I have 90 range + blowpipe. My melee stats are pretty low so is a BGS even worth it or should i resort to bone crossbow lol? 
---
I only have 80 mage so if I had to learn and grind one, would you recommend zulrah or vorkath
---
:D
---
Because i dont have a blowpipe or any other high DPS weapon that is low risk that i can use to quickly kill other revs, as for why revs in general, trying to get dragon platelegs or skirt for my ironman.
---
Might as well train runecrafting now
---
?
---
right, which is why i stood there and died, didnt active prayers, or attempt to flee or fight back.  PKers are actually stupid, if i had somethign i would have tried to escape, instead i jsut let myself die becuase i lost nothing of value except my time, hope the PKers enjoyed throwwing away 15k in runes to kill me for my FREE monks robes i got at monastery.
---
Loot, from rev imps.  I hope they enjoyed the 25 ether i collected for them and the monks robes.
---
very cool. the shading/perspective looks so good even with so few pixels to work with
---
1/300 drop rate for Zenyte and they can be fought in void armour. I'd say give it a go and see if you like it. Ambient loot should net about 1m/hr depending on how quickly you get the hang of switching your prayers and how many you can actually kill. Your stats arent bad at all you'd be better off with at least base 80 but as far as it goes no matter what you are bound to take some damage. Even in a generic setup like Karil's Top Veracs Skirt etc you will get hit and they max in the mid 30s so just stay safe on HP and really work at the prayer flicking.
---
Biggest helpful hint I can give is always switch prayer before trying to switch gear.
---
Best of luck out there
---
Then those should be the only add-ons allowed. Cerberus, gorillas, herbiboar, barrows, potion timers, buff and debuff timers, loot drop text... the sheer number of advantageous plug-ins proves that it is destructive to the playerbase's mindset.
---
Swampletics GOOD : ^ |
---
Well said, I myself can't figure out why you would take a pic of your screen with your phone in the first place.
---
Since you didn’t try to run that means they should let you live? It’s not like its hard to escape anyways. Don’t go in the wilderness if you can handle dying and losing nothing

The spellbook vote came out wayyyyy after all the pvp updates got shut down.

hes very easy to learn but hes not fun to grind and easier to mess up. zulrah takes longer to learn but its practically afk once you get it down.
---
You do realise that you are risking your loot?
---
Retard alchemise self
---
NO ONE is too stupid to notice they didnt bank their valuables before going to revs, PKers and idiots like you need to stop using THAT as an excuse, only a complete fucking moron doesnt double check before going to revs, christ... jagex should add a wealth indicator to EVERYONE in the widlerness to show how much potential loot a player will drop on death so PKers will fuck off and stop using those excuses, also fuck you maybe?  You are sitting here saying i 'cry a lot' but i bet you are one of those kids who picked up like 15 twisted bows then considered necking yoruself when jagex rolled back the servers becuase you dont have the skill to earn your own fucking items and gold.  You are a PRIME example of the toxic cunts in the community.

When you lock content people want to do behind other content people don't want to do, said people are going to want to change the content they don't want to do into something they want to do.

Why does the arbitrary value of rangers matter? Why do you have an interest in Rangers being 35m or whatever, rather than 30m and just slightly more obtainable? I really dont get your reasoning here.

I'm aware.

With this mindset we should fucking nerf blowpipe.
---
Wilderness has always "forced" people there. Level 44 rune rocks used to the the only decent place to mine, most of the best training spots such as axe hut and earth warriors, money making methods, mage cape etc etc. That's exactly how it should be.
---
The actual problem is that the average RS player now is a sissy bitch who complains about not everything being safe death.
---
Experiments, because the possibility exists that you could run into Swampletics.
---
Idk I feel a lot of those features are turned off and he wouldn't know what to look for. Could be wrong about that though

It's 100% photoshopped. The tell is the RC level. Any level besides exactly 1 or 9 is inexistent.

Nope, it isn't. Normal spellbook in general is trash

---
No new PVM polls will affect you. This is all old content.

All of what you just described is best in game. Best Prayer experience in the game. Best money in the game. You dont have to, but you are at a disadvantage. If I want a diary cape, I need to do Wilderness diaries. 
---
I have no issue with PVP changes.
---
What I have issue with is buffing PVP and adding OP spells or anything that makes it easier for a PKer to kill me. And on top of that if I want to do anything thats best in game I have to deal with PKers trying to skull trick me or use a spear to take away my +1. 
---
PVP is in a good spot. Im not going to stick more best in game shit in the wilderness just for danger. Black chins/Black Salamanders and so forth. The wilderness has the best moneymakers in the game, I dont wanna keep buffing it

Yeah teleblock is OP.

Not sure if you've seen posts about this suggestion yet:
---
But could we get some more Sandstone rocks, possibly a mine below.
---
If you think charters (for sand) are busy, this will be 10 fold.
---
This 
---
Zammy is the best one, it lowers their mage which means they constantly need to restore to barrage if they are 98 or under mage I think, also this lowers their magic def. 
---
Sara is 2nd best,1 pray point per hit isn't hugely relevant but its something
---
Guthix is by far the worst, not only does it not have a t75 staff to cast with, it does virtually nothing vs any low defence acc, it doesn't stack with itself (so if i'm 40 def and you guthix me, ill be 38 at worst) and its countered by both super restores and brews

Theres tons of new bosses in RS3 that 07 doesnt have/wont get. Its the reverse though, tons of content in 07 that will never be in RS3 (WC/Farm guild in Zeah prob wont ever make it in). To each their own, personally I only played RS3 until they kept adding more and more shit and then locking it behind stuff I just lost interest. Soooo many dailies you need to do or you get behind, takes over half a year to finish ports if you do it EVERY DAY etc. Im so glad i switched in Nov.

"Most people let clues sit in their bank, rangers will go down in price"
---
That's an Oxymoron.
---
If you mean it, you can actually pay a developer to make it for you and add it to your RuneLite for you.
---
Okay so was this one.

Pking is competitive. Be competitive. Otherwise you will not have any success.

Wasn’t this posted before? Could’ve sworn I saw it.

*Shrug*

This happens alot more than you think, I'd say atleast 8 out of 10 times I've killed people who look like they have nothing they have ALOT more than they should. Do you know how often people are stupid enough to bring their cash stack into the wildy? It's ALOT.
---
i was going to say GPU plugin + antialias but the plugins were down after the system update \~ \_\~
---
resizeable 1080 I guess?
---
Dude, careful posting your pin on here, don't wanna get hacked
---
Even if you don't win the possibility of winning makes it fun.
---
You realize that people doing wilderness slayer risk cannonballs, mysterious emblems, runes/bolts, they oftentimes have a +1 you can smite. I’d pk anyone at greater demons, why not? 
---
The whole point of polls is that we get to decide if we want content or not. Lots of ideas that could be considered "good for the game" didn't pass for any number of reasons, one of the bigger ones being that some people consider it a waste of dev time. You shouldn't just be cool with questions passing like this just because you agree with it because another poll is gonna come like this with stuff you disagree with and you won't be able to do anything about it.
---
You're not obliged to join a cc if you don't feel like talking to it's members...
---
I know what you mean. Over in RS3 they made it to where we can have like five different quick-prayer presets, but I never use them. I always change them when needed and haven't even touched the other presets, lol.
---
It was no problem, all in a days work.
---
Define doable...
---
1 at the moment, thinking about making a new one though
---
whats up "to the lost"
---
Can somebody explain the "official unofficial rules" for the [ToS](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms) &amp; [rules](https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules)?
---
As far as I understand it, it goes like
---
**3rd party clients**  
---
They're against Jagex ToS, but a majority of players use Runelite/OSB/Konduit without problem.
---
**Macros**  
---
Against the rules, but certain AHK scripts are okay, as long as it's 1:1 input-output.
---
**Account sharing**  
---
Against the rules, but it's "_okay_" as long as you aren't doing _high-profile content_, such as the Inferno.
---
Oh... this is a smart thing I should be doing. 
---
Private off, public set to friends... "Where is everyone" 
---
OP should join a clan, talk to some people in game. 
---
Maybe you would enjoy them too if you actually learned how to solve basic puzzles without the help from software.
---
There's always wood cutting, mining, and cooking.  You can splash to train magic, or train any combat at sand crabs.
---
For smithing you should probably just do that actively at blast furnace.  Cannonballs are painfully slow and give less xp per bar than standard steel Smithing.  You could do something like dart tips or bolts.  Those are afk and should make money.
---
Feelin this hard, gonna get a bombed exam back tomorrow but I only need a 45 to pass 
---
if i remember correctly, way back in the original RS u used to have a pestle and mortar in your invent in order to make potions right?
---
fun is subjective
---
Lmao get pked kido 
---
Some people. 8/10 is bullshit. You, me, and everyone else knows it. 1 in 100 is being generous.
---
Will you transfer it to your main or nah?
---
Fight pits too plz 
---
Apologies for believing that having a one-armed woman fighting in ww2 is politically motivated (I assume bf5 is what you're referencing). If they simply wanted to include women in the game they could've included Soviet women, who actually did fight in the war. Also nice strawman.
---
Yeah the only place i get med clues from is dagannoths.
---
They do respawn :) Just have no rewards for killing
---
I have my exam 2 Monday for my calc 2 not ready yet :(

They had us in the first part, not gonna lie

And in the end he planks to a 30 30 dbow cause he took a completely unnecessary risk so he loses all of his profit + 50m
---
It happened to me.  I just got done with all the f2p quests and I was going to get membership but I took like a 2 week break and when I got back my account was banned.

Funny how that keeps happening.

And international interference

I started by watching Swampletics and he mentioned using a Runelite feature that allowed him to do some minigame real quick, so I figured I'd use that since he used that.
---
You probably didn't intend it that way but I can only read this comment with a super sarcastic voice
---
Nice as it was your stuff stays on the ground for an hour so it’s not like he did some crazy heroic deed. Definitely not deserving of 1m, a reddit post suffices. 
---
Alch yourself
---
Very cool thank you TheKingKunta!!!
---
you probly never pk? its ATLEAST 20%, killing few of them a day they usualy drop teleport runes stack or house tab stack, and some times teleport scrolls and cash.
---
What's your suggestion 
---
Does it? I thought your items appear after a few minutes... did they change that?
---
Meet Dianetics, my GE-and-bank-locked UIM
---
What is 3D in assuming it is when you add a Z axis??because we are doing 3D motion soon in my physics class and 2D is when you have both x and y axis.
---
Unless they changed it to that recently no. Every time I’ve died I just run back and get my stuff. It’s happens a lot to me at gwd and it just sits there. Even have time to get kc 
---
I assure you this isn't a bamboozle.
---
Here's my Chrome history which'll probably show I'm completely new to the game. [Long way](https://i.imgur.com/DiUPrjg.png) to go for a diddle.

Imp jars are a mess, but that doesn't mean you should use that as an excuse. Change imp jars too.

Fuck that, make them a 100% drop.

imo quitting the game will only make you want to play it and distract from studying, finding a balance would be way better

almost everything is on be default tbh.

Yeah over half way!!! Good job!

when you try too hard to be funny that you get cut on your own edge
---
Also the other players can’t see your items. It’s Jagex’s fix for dcing/ server lag 
---
Huh... I didn’t know that. I swear I’m osrs you had to run to your body otherwise you grave disappears. Idk, I haven’t died in a long ass time because I only pvm and if I’ve died it was in a safezone (clan wars, nmz etc) or if I boss I always user a ring of life anyways

I've been to the depths of dark web and shady cancerous websites filled with 5000 popups and clicked like a madman. Torrented every fucky thing that exists. My League/WoW/RS accounts are/ have been worth thousands of dollars each. No protection, similar passwords on everything. 15 years of doing this.

You can try to shift blame to make yourself feel better but I think you gotta realize that woox wasnt actually quitting bro

Using any gear or pots is only going to have the same effect to both

Lemme see what that mouf do
---
Like if they drop on the ground? Weird. I totally didn’t even know that
---
nahyou get them only if you get actually rich. Than life really starts and true friends will find you.. 
---
If you drop it from your inventory they can but if you die they can’t see that 
---
You can't get avas if you're a 1 prayer pure.

It’s funny, I always asked myself how people DC and lose their HCIMs because my internets been fairly good. Until this week. DC after DC. It’s scary

Okay. Do you know if members items appear on non meme worlds then? I have an alt that ran out of mem and I didn’t transfer my items to my main in time
---
Because full black d'hide is somehow the most powerful armor in the game. 
---
Can you explain to me what 55 or 57 mean? In the Netherlands we grade on a 10 point scale and everything over 5,5 is a pass (and in uni the grades *really* don’t matter anymore, just pass/fail) and I thought the post was proudly showing off he passed lol. 
---
I'll have you know i live on the 9th floor
---
Just got bandos and dont have prims 
---
Never heard of the guy, is he like thenewboston of mathematics?
---
Eh not really if you think about it 
---
646 I think. 
---
Would love to see some activity at the fight pits
---
Then there's no reason you should have bandos rn.
---
Ohhh this is the US? I thought UK. In the US there's no ECTS right? I've heard of GPA (your average???) so it does matter how high your grade is? (other than pass/fail)
---
F for OP in any case.

Well sorry lol. And to be honest I would not mind. I am very attractive and pretty confident. So there is that.

implimenting a HD model toggle will take away a big chunk of dev time
---
everything seemed so hard (i was also f2p). We didn't hang out on reddit, we didn't hang out on discord or any other social channels.
---
We had a forum and we had a clan and you jsut chatted with people you met in game. Now you can just train to 99 and never interact with anyone. (NMZ for example)
---
Why are there Veggie Tales on my reddit XD
---
Dude you’re talking about best and you’re using addy gloves and a fucking crossbow lmfao. Get back with a blowpipe and black vambs if no ur too bad for bgloves.

Oh I see. I wasn't around for that, fairly new to the scene. My bad

they met in the middle

This has to be staged. Legit the worst “brid” I ever seen LOL.

Sequences and series getting you down? Need some help i got an A in calc 2 at Auburn, just pm me and I'll help explain concepts. I took it 2 yrs ago so I'll need to double check them 
---
Well it seems to be the case on every 2k worlds, along with many other worlds. It seems they can have this high a total level having probably auto clicked before with no repercussion. Not fair to everyone who trained legitimately.
---
The only problem is that he needs the sextant, chart, and compass in his bank (which can't happen) or inventory in order to be able to dig on any coordinate clue locations. He can't get those items as they are outside of Morytania
---
**It's something**
---
Exactly this. Op is a fucking noob, cbow, addy gloves, dhide boots, avas accu, and he’s complaining about other peoples gear? Smh
---
If using "mouse-keys" style macros, they must work like this:
---
- Set a fixed distance (eg 50 pixels) which you want to move the mouse
---
- ONE button press can move the mouse by your fixed amount in any direction.
---
- ONE button press can send either a Left or Right click
---
- You cannot have multiple different fixed distances set to different buttons, only different directions.
---
Here's a good video on how to use mousekeys-style macros for blackjacking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs9KZ1QMRSE

fairy ring is faster anyway

A monster also isn't a person. I'm not saying you don't have the ability or right to kill clue scrollers, nor am I saying you shouldn't. But you definitely are wasting their time for a 1/200 chance or some shit at like 500k or a couple mil in tps.
---
Lemme phrase it like this too. It all a boss dropped was 14-16k every time I killed it (a glory) and it took me 1-2m to kill it each time, that's fucking trash and a waste of my time. Now imagine not only am I wasting my time, but the thing I'm killing is a person so I'm wasting their time too. 
---
Be nice. Have purpose. Enjoy the great life you have, there is literally nothing you cant do and become. Play less runescape, have hobbies, be with your family. And again, be a nice guy and everything will work out fine :)

I think your beaver is sick

Lol vegan being dumb.  Username checks out

Eh i got an A in calc 2 and never opened the text. But I went to EVERY class and didn't miss any days, and wasn't on my phone during it, i was attentive and asked questions, and then i did the homework he gave us by myself before putting it in to Symbolab to make sure i got the right answer instead of just using symbolab lol
---
That’s not reassuring LUL
---
If I kill 25 random people on the wilderness during session who seem to be risking nothing or claim to be risking nothing, I usually end up profiting anywhere between 500k to 1,5m.
---
An example: 2 days ago I killed someone going to KBD who seemed to be risking under 50k. What did I get? ~~750k.
---
Its simply not worth it to NOT KILL people who act like they risk nothing, simply because the effort it takes to kill them is so little, and you have a decent chance of making profit.
---
For me personally, PKing in general is a good money maker, usually around 1-2m/hour and this includes both killing PKers and killing PVMers.
---
If you dont know, after they saw people interested in buying old Armour skin, they gave graphical update to more armors and added the old model to salmon shop lol.
---
Comes in, asks for an answer, gets an answer, "Idk about that". What a goober.
---
Hahaha i get it cause hes not really half way guys hahahahahahahaha never heard that one before hold on let me call my nan to show her this

Look at all of you being wholesome and supportive of another player and their struggles. That's just so heart warming I could just shit.

Damn Mod Ash's cock is huge.

I do clues all the time and I don't have these items in my bank.

My mum told me not to get mad at disabled people

Better not drink too much or you'll lose your red helmet! Good luck on the adventure.

It's just you.

Some people just love to cheat, dude. Sadly.

Lmao this fact this comment is positively rated shows the brainlets on this game would rather 3t fish then actually attempt to have fun
---
That’s when you snipe em in between kills. You can’t really complain that you can’t get on someone when they’re fighting something in single combat lol
---
Your fucked mate. Xfer your stuff to a mule and seek shelter
---
Thats what happen when u hire people with experience from other games. they copy paste evrything from other game they worked.
---
Pretty sure he got the joke lmfao
---
Yeah, or the member wilderness side of that place.
---
Maybe another underground area. Lots of underground places are visible to eachother past the walls depending on your camera angle, I remember doing underground pass and somehow being able to see rooms in the underground of Meiyerditch which is on completely the opposite side of the map
---
This stank like a troll post from the start and this settles it. Downvote and move on guys.
---
Sorry :( didn't consider this
---
Where did I get triggered by this vid? It was the actual brainlet that replied to my comment that triggered me lol. I love when pvmer/skillers try to antipk, makes it more fun. The reason I switched from a sweaty max cape chaser/efficient raider was when I did my 75-99 hunter grind at black chins and learned how to anti pk. It’s literally hilarious venge ags maul stacking people out when they least expect it. 
---
Lmao
---
Do you guys remember the armour rework that came in januari 2012? Thats when rs rly died for me.
---
Haven't seen this meme in 2 weeks so I must repost it

Meet cabbagletics, my cabbage locked ultimate ironman. After recently hitting lvl 32 on my my main I decided to up the ante, to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking. No trading. But this time I can't do anything but pick cabbage, all leading up to eventually taking on one of runescapes biggest challenges... earning enough to buy a cabbage cape.
---
Yes that's plenty good for raids.
---
World 65 mount quidamortem is the ffa world but those teams usualy have a kc requirement so you'll have little luck there.
---
But i've heard great things about the WeDoRaids discord for people who want to start raiding so you could check that out
---
Haha back then a visage drop was probably one of the best drops outside of gwd 
---
I think you guys have flawed thinking, if you think higher supply won't lead to lower prices you don't know basic economics.

Add my accounts: Mortismah &amp; MissSwifty

majority of people are not pkers and they vote to updates for their own benefit, they dont want to get pked in wildy.
---
Use the official runescape wiki, the fandom one is full of wrong info
---
or just don't do clue scrolls if you don't think they're worth your time
---
Smite is already broken. Let's not make it 100% required to pvp with
---
Your comment history simply leans towards negative responses to any given thread.
---
Nah its fair.
---
CW is pretty entertaining to NH pures in
---
bad toys, verrrry bad
---
He's right though, all pkers killing clue scrollers are absolute dog shit
---
I'd agree 100% if Jagex hired some of the Runelite developers to make the original client not suck ass. You really shouldn't need a 3rd part client to have a game about grinding xp for hundreds of hours actually show you how much xp you're earning per hour.
---
They actually had this on real armour, it’s so they can take a piss on objects in modern runescape to show their disgust with the way the game turned out.
---
He basically made this game.
---
First dev on osrs, at jagex since 04.
---
And on top of that he replied to 100k+ Question tweets on twitter. 
---
He also answers anything(You ask him about a bug and he gives you a straigth answer without trying to cloak it.).
---
He stands to his word. 
---
Example: He said that no matter how you get to be the last man standing in a DMM final you will get the 10k. When woox was the last man standing and jagex paid the 10k USD to a different player because woox won "unfairly", ash just paid woox the 10k out of his pocket. (Because his word was worth more than 10k to himself.)
---
Rare to see a genuine person like that.
---
You very clearly don't know what a protected class is, nor do you understand the implications of the encroachment that outlawing circumcision has re religious freedoms (even though i agree with you on that). But you're talking about women having more rights?? Thanks for your input dude
---
OP I'm so glad to see someone new genuinely joining this community. I didn't know people were still discovering osrs. Welcome to the fam, I hope people are nice and they believe you when you ask these questions / post these images. I hope you don't get called a troll too often and that you learn quick.
---
Everyone was a noob at some point! 
---
OP is a perfect example of this community's bad side.
---
I offer 855k and i'll trim your armor for free
---
Cant succeed if you give up
---
The max cape has that ability, if you want to show off like this you need to get all 99's.
---
All the ruined pures can become fixed
---
I’m shit at the game, don’t feel like trying nhing because I’m shit at the game. 
---
- literally what u just said. 
---
No wonder devs are complacent with turning this game into afkscape/tbow/bpscape. Just a bunch of brainless bots doing afk slayer lmao. 
---
And a cape
---
Sorry when it comes to the implications of circumstances religion takes a back seat, and yes I do understand protected classes but thanks for saying otherwise. And yes, I outlined 2 that women have that men down. Can you show me which right a man has that a woman doesn't? Not social issues, but an actual right that men have women don't? 
---
Bad
---
Does that include ToB gear? Doing ToB with a rapier / Sythe and full justiciar seems pretty good, sang staff too, the only thing that would be lacking is ranged I guess.
---
Also I presume they'd all have to wear random off pieces though :/
---
could also be watching movies/doing other shit and manually clicking?
---
Toggle options back when HD was introduced did hurt people. The toggle was never a full 100% toggle, the new animations, models etc. still carried over to low detail.
---
It's a 200IQ move on Jagex to allow 3rd party clients. They don't have to spend time developing new features, and if a new feature in a 3rd party client breaks, there's no problem. Jagex would have to waste so much time doing quality testing before adding new features, when Runelite can do it with no issue. If something breaks, that's your fault for using an unofficial, untested feature.
---
Na I’m just sick of coming on Reddit and seeing little bitches like you whining.
---
I want to see memes/suggestions/discussions and questions. Thought provoking stuff. Not you being a little bitch. 
---
Reminds me of the giant slime blobs from Darkest Dungeon
---
Clue Scroll Points didn't affect it much unless you already had thousands of clues done already. What being polled is pretty much equal to this "hyped up rework", minus the clue points. People will do a lot more clues if they become stackable than previously, because it's easier and more convenient. Aka EasyScape.
---
Bit like your life kid.
---
If you get 70 agi (though the grind sucks) they're great gp in taverly. 
---
My honest question: If you have 2fa on email and account, wtf is a bank pin gonna do anyway because if they got past those they probably have a keylogger anyway?
---
A mod told me that the Barbarian village meat left on the table is actually lab grown, so it's all good.
---
Cooking sharks at any level is profitable, even with burn rate. Compared to karambwans, I have no comparison but the exp will be a bit better, esp as you reach the 100% cook rate
---
I like to do fletch everyday
---
Carefully :P, currently my team's plan is to melee it with either whips or veracs (probably whips) this is going to be quite difficult. But the best of CCC will be competing in this challenge so I'm not worried
---
Split a spade*
---
In those days that phat was worth about as much if not more than what twisted bow does today
---
And a cape...
---
Eh, that update was good in my opinion. It actually meant that level and bonus increments mattered more. 
---
Right now, the difference between 98 and 99 strength, for instance, only matters with certain gear setups, as the max hits are the exact same in quite a few cases where the same max strength setups are compared. 
---
The 10x scaling also made it incredibly easy to adapt to, so I don't see any downsides aside from nostalgia.
---
Also where the first 45 spawns in wave 3.
---
I can guarantee you dragged the orange spawn away by being out of line of sight
---
I'm pretty sure just pushing his thumb down and moving it to the left will unlock it, his fingers are in prime position to do this
---
Stop posting your loot on reddit unless you fully secure your account and email, you are baiting hackers to try.
---
Ya my joke placement is fine, the end of a point is probably the best time to use a bit of light humour, fwiw tho i don't need arguing advice from a dude who just says shit cause it sounds right to him.
---
Well even if the key logger tracks mouse movements they still wouldn't know the pin because the number changes after each click.
---
Lmao are you crying bro?
---
Fair enough, didn't think of it that way.
---
no tob gear
---
because a couple of barrages is 1-2m 4Head
---
Who'd have thought barbarians were so progressive 
---
What do i see here? That they can mark someone?

What's castle wars
---
atm, pvm death is 60min times, pvp is way shorter, idk how long exacly.

sometimes some shenanigans happen, and pvm death counts as pvp, but only on rare ocassions.

Though a summer pie works even better

And I like training up my mine once a year

I don't get why people do that, this is just sad, not only that nmz is so afkable, like what's the point of that.  
---
Is it player vs player when there are 9 players who want to fight trying to kill 1 person who doesn't?
---
I only see the fun in pking when it's 1v1 and both are geared to fight.

God, Helmies are the most entitled pieces of shit I know.

Pure nostalgia.

P r e s t i g e
---
Unforunatly this is a known scam amd no action will probably be taken.
---
Can't confirm
---
Was that video supposed too show skill? You realize he is just clicking in a certain order right? Kinda like when people play guitar hero? Osrs pvp is literally a lowres version of guitar hero with a mouse instead of a instrument.
---
I guess clicking fast and precisely is a skill? But it's most definitely low on the skill totem pole. 
---
I just can't comprehend how people have never experieced the feel of multiplayer griefing.
---
It's like killing someone on Minecraft and watch his whole inventory of good shit drop to the floor like a fountain, bonus points if he actually has something or you just interrupted the guy in the middle of something.
---
Not every spider is pregnant....
---
Every abyssal demon has a spine, but not everyone drops that spine as a whip, nom saying? (Yes, the whips are the spines)
---
This game is the worst shit ever its like ur getting virtual heroin doses everyday but cant stop and need help
---
You should just quit the game with a poisoned efficiency mindset like that. 
---
Why do anything ever if you just didn’t get it in the first kill? No double ahirms in 10 chests? Yo fuck barrows that shit is for brainlet retards who just like empty clicking at pixels.

Do you see the hypocrisy? Do I need to spell it out any clearer for you? Just because a random player in the wilderness doesn’t have a set droprate for you to jerk off to, doesn’t mean that the gross majority of clue hunters in the wild don’t carry excess items at a 1/20 1/200 or 1/2000 rate. The only way to know is to kill them snowflake, like the only way to know what’s in your barrows chest is to fucking open it.

Is a monster's drop determined from the moment its spawned? or is it always rolled upon death?

I see people using that item highlight on rl. What's the point? Just obscures the item sprite to me.

He could have blocked every post, doesn’t make a different when his Reddit username is also his rsn.

I see videos of people playing where everything on the ground has its GE price and name next to it, and in God Wars, there's timers that automatically count down to the boss's next spawn, and the next time you can pray at the altar. How do I get all that?

People are more likely to cave in to peer pressure and vote for what seems like the most popular option. Thats why we want the poll results hidden, cause we want people to make a complete unbiased vote on what enters the game.
---
Its the same thing if someone logs into reddit one day and sees a hugely popular post telling them to vote no. Especially when the post lacks any constructive reasoning why.
---
you're like the 5th person to ~~karmafarm~~post this tweet

Didn't look into it but I'm guessing you bragged about it on Twitter or Reddit and some virgin spent all night abusing the recovery system.

Thought that read "marijuana locked" sounds like my main.
---
Doing the math at rates similar to ecumenical keys, it would take roughly 175 imps for 5 clues (versus 125 imps if the rates stayed the same).  Plus what's stopping people from dropping clues to combat the reduced drop rate?
---
Socialism is bad, it hikes taxes up, healthcare based on socialism fails terribly while being more expensive than free market alternatives, is bankrupting county councils in the UK. For the countries that tried a universal basic income they immediately regretted it as people would just rather live off welfare than work for it when given the option.
---
Interestingly the US spends more per capita on publically funded healthcare than the UK yet has no national healthcare.

Zeah favor says hi. But yeah, at least in zeah you can change what you do and it improves the favor rates and you unlock more ways to earn favor as you earn favor. But in menaphos, every way to earn favor is unlocked straight away. And you can stay at one spot all the way to max favor to all districts. Well, if you fish, woodcut or mine then you unlock place where it's 50% less likely to tree to fall, ores to crumble and fishing spots stays still longer.

I can't understand how someone is able to hack someone trough their ingame display name... It does not matter if you are going to try recover the account if you don't know the login email. There are lots of possible reasons why this kind of things could happen...
---
1. A bought account (Meaning that original creator recovered account back)
---
2. Shared account (Meaning close friend recovered the account back)
---
3. Owner of the account did real world trading and tried to cover his ass by claiming that he has been hacked, so his iron man would not get banned for RWT.
---
Salve amulet work on barrows now or what 
---
i don't understand what's going on here
---
Yup running around castle wars getting 1 hit by all the players not knowing what's going on is what brought me back to runescape &lt;3
---
So what if it lowers "prices", you're doing them faster which compensates for it. Unless you want clues to be profitable because its boring content 
---
i mean if you been raiding for 24 hours, you obviously need help and sleep because who the fuck would do that.
---
Hopping to a pvp worlds prompts a a warning, so if you read that warning and continued to hop to said pvp world, then you obviously deserve it

That's why your commenting on this Reddit and helping me become famous thank you.

Keep us posted

If you didn’t love to show of your achievements that no1 gives a fuck about you wouldn’t be hacked gf get 2fa

10 years? I thought it was a more recent thing? Not that I know anything about that...

---
Get 78 and use a similar boost to hit 83 :)
---
This! I also think he RWTed. People get banned for RWT, so he covered his ass by claiming ''he has been hacked''. There is no way to hack people trough their Display name, you can't even try to recover account with display name alone... You need ''Email login''.

Hi, any thoughts on maybe securing your platform and creating a delay on authenticator?

Wc/farm could be added to rs3 but not in the same format as osrs. Like dominion tower wasn't added as its in rs3 to osrs. 
---
Which means he was right?
---
This is such a bad fake
---
Do people who get tbows from this generally keep them or do they sell them?
---
It's called Runelite. It's a third-party Runescape client (completely free and safe, over half the people on osrs use it). You can download it at: runelite.net, and only use that link
---
Of course it can, it depends on the direction of the progression. Most people would rather see alzheimers not progress. 
---
RuneScape is fun. I like to kill bosses.
---
Not really, farm pet is like 30m xp, so you lucked out in both cases.

Sure, more to suck dry on the way to the bottom.

A country should never become socialist. Because it's never worked, and killed tens of millions of people in the attempt.

Why do your skill icons look weird?

Yes. The safespot in Tav dungeon is pretty easy to use, but I would recommend an antidragon shield to avoid being Nak flambée.

Haha I like it. I'll usually find a populated world and race people around the course. They dont know where racing though so naturally I'm moving faster but oh well.

The dude made his reddit account like a week ago. His comments include him saying "A" repeatedly and wanting jagex to give him ancestral bottoms. Maybe if you take the cosine of his average posts per day and do a partial fraction of it you can guess what his mother's maiden name is

And this is why we block the run energy when posting to reddit, rookie mistake.

This week on my main or on my pure I have killed a level 80 for his Fury, a guy doing a clue scroll for 5m in coins, some skulled guy at revs for his BP which I didn't smite and a guy doing Wildy slayer for full blessed arma-d'hide and Like 4k ether and the latest one was some naked guy near Mage bank who had 28 ring of wealths on him It really isn't the lottery at all

bs, why dont then hackers scam ppl with spark mac with 100b bank, everyone knows his nickname

Google made an extension for chrome called password checkup. It checks if your passwords have been in a database leak. Check that.

Gz
---
Do you have a bank pin? if you do, you need to get the account back within 3 days and your shit will be safe
---
Seeing your comment history seems like you hate everything lol
---
I'm really just trying to help mate =/ onedrive is a safe problem...
---
If you used passwords for osrs outside of it, and digging your info via reddit can lead to you personla details somewhere, hackers may impersonate you with old pass/ip/location and so on, and authy is removed withotu delay if jagex fails at recognizing it's an impersonation.
---
This is why jagex security sucks so fucking bad it's unbeilable.
---
agreed. and If I feel like I have a good opportunity I would try and tag two. But keeping jad from being fully healed is a pain to watch out for.

For real. I wanna see some dope pvp updates and I don’t go at all.

Dig through post history, find more about the person. Already have the username and screenshots for “proof”.

Having a username is the first step to hacking an account.

Fuck me the Dragon Slayer 2 part where you assault the island was fantastic. It's a mad rush to avoid a world war, everyone around you is dying and you have to do an agility course with the broken pieces of the boats. Having to stop to help out weaker warriors.

Hey my sister is extremely mad at me, is buying her a gift the solution or is sending her this reddit post it?

Idk what youre trying to achieve in telling me how much its worth and that it isnt worth it etc etc. I gave you the reasons that people hide names i couldnt give a fuck about how much its worth since i dont actively do this myself, i just gave the reasoning behind it.

I believe you need to have at least started The Fremenik Isles to access the ones that I was referring to however there are some north of Trollheim which you can access with only having done Death Plateau, but those you'll have to kill entirely yourself and it's kind of a trek to get there without having done further quests

No only helmies, people that repost the same shit, idiots that can't protect their accounts, and really stupid questions when they can be easily googeable.

in 5 mins i have been able to cover all spots with all thte snowflake ironmeme vids on youtube thx op

Yes there are,
---
you could also log on the worlds and search it yourself, probably would have taken less time than making a reddit post
---
Since when does that make a difference? You're not standing to gain, you're just doing it to cause harm. The only slightly redeeming factor is that it's not a particularly major thing- but it doesn't make it right and it doesn't make you not a cunt.

Outside the occasional "retard" most clan pkers only spam their clan tag. Sure you have the racist/moronic people (hell, there's some in my own post history) but you have just as many as those people while pvming (at least from my own experience).

I wasn't aware people did something other then remove x40 stack of hop seeds to be sure they filled every birdhouse.. do you open each nest as you get them instead of at the end of the run?

:)
---
&gt;you went to the wilderness you werent prepared to fight?
---
There's the "is da wildaness" argument. Of course I don't bring heavy weaponry to fight back when I don't want to fight, equipment I'll lose if I do get in a fight since I'm not equipped nor prepared for a fight and I can't do fuck against a freeze.
---
Jokes on you I've never been killed doing a wilderness clue. Your comment has nothing to do with my post either, only proving that the argument is yet again "is da wildy rawr".

I uhh dont hate it?

Ha ha.

See you back in about summer then! Have a nice quit(break)
---
Talking about popular bosses
---
Sorry guys last time I logged into it I couldn’t find them, but yeah found them, also the Ibans staff isn’t in the chest anyway to get that?
---
This exactly. And it makes sense. If they didnt lure/force pvmers out into the wilderness, brainlets would quit pking because they are shit and can only pk unwilling participants. Woth no brainlets, actual pkers wouldnt come out, theyd end up edge or.lever fighting, as there'd be noone to hunt down.
---
It was really ironic that they included that drop right after they tried to raise the price of brews by limiting the amount of birds nests entering the game.
---
Also part of the complaints were how broken the drop was for ironmemes. 2500 brews lasts a very long time on an ironman and it also takes a really long time to even get that many in the first place.
---
Thanks!
---
Vorkath, Zulrah and Alchemical Hydra are those bosses, Zulrah is 2.5m/h at the best, but if you have dragon hunter crossbow you can reach 3m/h at Vorkath, while Hydra has very high slayer requirement (95 slayer) and was released 2 months ago so uniques are expensive right now
---
Ironman btw

Ah, I see. That didn’t cross my mind, which is why I asked. Sorry for being a “dolt”?

Cool, thank you

No.

You sure? Its a long time since i did that and im pretty sure i just dropped the pouches for 28 space
---
But for real, at this point just stop posting your username on the subreddit. Too many people have been burned by it, and this dude basically just said "Hack Me" by posting a TBow and all of that information.
---
It's just unnecessary.
---
I breathed heavy through my nose.
---
yeah you should never let anyone know how much run energy, hp, and spec you have left. they can easily take that info and check it against a vast database of whatever nonsense youre an idiot 
---
I highly recommend as you get further along in the game or even now, no actually both. Go through all the settings and see what you want on and off. Some settings like gpu will put a load on your computer/laptop so maybe keep it off.
---
Because they will forget it tommorow
---
Damn I never thought of this. That would be chaos. People would hunt Swampletics down.
---
You don't remotely live in the real world then. Blizzard, a MUCH larger company, has accounts getting hacked left and right even with their authenticators. The reality is that account recovery options have to exist and when you broadcast information about yourself, you're making it easier to falsely recover.
---
You can be against victim blaming, but Jagex is in no way the perpetrator and it is ignorant to fault them for this.
---
Yeah if trade all my RNG away for that luck. 
---
you're very welcome.
---
Iirc, the devs are quite keen to make some form of mini-boss out of them. Mod Maz and maybe Mod West were the ones who expressed interest (I think, can't remeber exactly). There's a space in the museum ready for when they do make a use for them

Jagex have specifically said no one will ever be punished for using a 3rd Party Client. It only becomes sort of blurry when those clients have features that drastically give you an advantage over other player (a recent example being the auto prayer switch some PvP client had a few months ago), but this is unlikely to happen as Runelite and OSB have a good raport with Jagex, and when asked, they will often remove features if unfair

Lot of flags for this guy already having his information out there in the past. Broadcasting to one of the hubs for RS players that "I'm insanely rich now, and here's my username" wasn't the brightest idea.

If he uses the same usernames he's more likely to be using the same passwords for different things as well.

I just run through in a panicked state frantically opening anything in my path and while shouting at other players for resetting the doors.

dont take it serious. ironmemes lack social competence

You guys love being so over dramatic

Hp and prayer could help identify the account if it's a special build, otherwise it's useless, the rest is just memeing. Username and total xp are the important ones, and don't screenshot the level tab.
---
wow

I guess some people don't see the point in being a decent human.

I'm level 75 but what I've done for xp is search every gold chest and loot only the last room. If you're going for a sceptre, search all the sarcphagi then the golden chests.

Runelite plugin that changes interface to look more like 2010 one

Sometimes I imagine RS with modern (RDR2) graphics and such. I think the only way we'd accept that would be if the game was in a totally new location, new quests, new NPCs. Simply "updating" the graphics won't cut it.

Damn when I saw your post where you got the bow I had the feeling this would happen. GL with getting another tbow.
---
Lol the learning curve for RuneScape is quite small compared to other games such as league of legends. The biggest part of runescape pking, like with everything, is repetition. Just keep playing until you don’t have to think about switching prayers and you just reflexively do it. 
---
Only if you do them for long enough to get a set of ranger boots though right? 
---
You are so so clueless lmao.

I haven't played Runescape that much lately, but how on earth it's even possible to hack someone with 2fa without having physical or remote access to his phone or by making a phishing site with fake runescape login that asks for authentication code while it's used in realtime to actually log into actual runescape.  
---
There should be literally no way to get to the account without waiting for at least X (usually 7) days for authenticator to be removed while the actual owner should be spammed with emails daily telling that their authenticator will be removed in X days and that they should cancel it and resecure their account if it wasn't them.

Literally everything that shows up in the image can be found by this guy just wielding the bow at GE.

I agree about the twitch emotes but nah man emojis have made it now. They are just a part of language.

In the next few years they will be acceptable for use in academic papers. 😊😂 🍆 💦

Yeah I use a ipv6 unique password for my RuneScape and emails, all different. I have like 10 emails and 5 rs accounts. Less likely to get hacked if your password is something like fi7djb65rah63

Ah, and he always looks like that.

There.. you just implied that it was the cause.

Walking through the ghetto = getting jumped, posting RSN and a big drop = getting hacked.

When in the reality criminal decided to jump you = getting jumped, hacker decided to hack you = getting hacked.

---
Still, he painted a target on his bum
---
Just a side question, but my account uses the old style username as the account login. Can this be updated to an email address if necessary?
---
Most of the people who run around in multi killing every single white dots are usually the kind of people who are just getting into pking and having fun. The whole pvp bank fighting/burnong ammy 1v1 fights are whole different thing.
---
Wisely summed up topic btw
---
When I did this, I used MSB (i) with rune arrows. However, at that time, the arrows cost just as much as broad bolts. Now, however, they're back up to ~100gp, and the dps increase isn't too much compared to the RCB (last I checked, may be off).
---
I'd still suggest short bow, though. 
---
Probably something to do with the use of super potions, because it really doesn't increase dps all that much with them
---
Shaman masks are supposed to be useless. RIP price.

Why not bring something to fight back then? Noone is forcing you to come into the wilderness naked with your clue, bring sone gear and let us engage in player versus player activities!

Seems to be the safest acclunt is having old log in names as user names and not linking and email to the account
---
A. If you fall for this you don't deserve ur bank.
---
B. Ur logging in with a full inventory of supplies and gear with a bank 5 steps away.
---
C. Don't go to a fucking pvp world with ur bank if u don't want to lose.
---
D. Darwinism.
---
It really do be like that

Did a bit of a google, serotonin is more of a mood regulator, but is also where satisfaction comes from. Dopamine apparently affects alertness, although I would agree that both play a role. I am not a neuroscientist, and I doubt anyone here is either, so we will just say both do the job. 
---
 Wow. Um. Ok? You couldn't have more wholesome more say to way to say that? Bad words have no more common to make you funny! STOP DISCRIMINATION, block your C word or im downvoting! Cursing makes the bottom of the line: the lowest of class! People like you act like sin is all fun an game, but all they do is make me more mad! 😠 
---
Salad robes isn’t good mage gear tho
---
Did you change your password for your email recently and/or do you have an authenticator on your email aswell? Theres a chance that your email was compromised in an earlier breach from another company. 
---
Having an authenticator on your email aswell (like sms-authentication) will virtually eliminate any chance of getting hacked in the future. 
---
I fully agree jagex does share a good portion of the responsibility too for being very lax in their security and if they had proper security this probably wouldn't have happened. The 2fa at minimum shouldn't have just been able to be removed obviously. But knowing that jagex security is subpar users should take a lot of extra precaution to ensure their account is secure outside of jagex's poor measures. OP unfortunately didn't do anything extra here to secure themselves and left their account wide open under current circumstances.
---
I legit feel so bad for you. All your posts had smileys :(
---
Jagex needs to get up off their lazy asses and get better security in place. Quit delaying it and just fucking do it already. This is one of the reasons I quit. I’ll get a good account just for it to get inevitably hacked.
---
Socialism and by extension Communism have proven that they can't work when taken to their final destination (read: China, Soviet era Russia, Cuba &amp; Venezuela.) It leads to mass deaths worse than any other political system has done to its citizens, when socialism tries to control the prices of goods it then paralyses the economy. Then the added problem is socialism always wants more than what is within its grasp and the answer to it is always print more money or just tax the rich even more! I believe in equality of opportunity not equality of outcome. I don't believe you are born with a birthright to just assume an equal outcome to everyone else you should be working for it not bankrupting the government to live an easy lifestyle. Also Companies are not greedy by making a profit, that is literally what they're designed to be outside of charitable non profit organisations. It is their exchange of a good or service for currency, that is not immoral.

You guys are like incapable of understanding the word “fun”.

“Haha Torvesta is such an idiot, he could have completed 2.34 efficient hours of agility while alching in the time he wasted *chortle*. How is he ever going to hit the standard 70EHP minimum quota this week?” 
---
I recommend encrypting all your email that deals with 2fa Only because emails can be tracked very very easily and are sent through the internet as plain text. With an encrypted email it will be protected by Tls protocol
---
&gt; Someone loses a tbow because they had no 2-factor on their email
---
"This is clearly Jagex's fault!"
---
They got hacked because someone recovered their account with the info they’ve put out on Reddit.
---
If you want to you can just agk afkish range them near the chambers of xeric (zeah) its a bit of a hike tho you can stand on a lil elevation and range them. You can also do this above burthope and hide behind one of the tents, or ice trolls ofcourse they die way quicker. Anyhow gl on your tasks bro. The mind set of just doing slayer because you want to is imo the best mind set. Smiles/h is more important then xp/h

rune crossbow and broad bolts. Ignore the fools saying msb.

Ge didn't get trade limits enforced until 2008, and phats at no point got traded on it after that as they got set too low 
---
If you're using an autoclicker why not do 1 tick? Ensures no dmg is taken at all and people can't see that you're flicking.
---
Because you never know what they could have, wildy clue hunters and basically loot boxes.
---
Also bet it's their username@gmail.com as well.
---
No way they'd be able to figure out their email otherwise unless it's in a database leak linked to his username.
---
Now we're talking advanced.
---
I remember bringing a cannon pre-eoc days at bandits incase any bastard tried to crash 
---
cos it got updoots on reddit 
---
What about for a maxed pure? I’m 60 atk, but I’ve heard of 75 atk pures getting kc though 
---
and what about OP? His 7 days passed too since yesterday right? Oh no he is just a dumbass
---
Rofl if there was a virus that could remote to my computer, that means they had access to my computer, and the only thing they got was my RuneScape account? It's worth less than $700 if you rwt-ed everything on my account. 
---
The fact of the matter is Jagex are incompetent with account security. You can check the subreddits for other games and you'll hardly find posts about being hacked, yet it's a daily occurrence on this sub.
---
I didn't say or imply it was THE cause. The criminal is at fault. There's no question about that. 
---
But you can limit your chances of run ins with criminals by not acting like a retard. It's not the persons fault directly but they definitely didn't help themselves out.
---
"They shouldn't have done that to me" is a pretty stupid thing to say when you jump into a lion's den.

Rollercoaster of emotions!

eh, if people really wanted to wouldn't make a huge difference. Those sorts of passwords are weak to brute force attempts.

Have you tried getting gud?

No one ever said pkers were smart

What is the 'we do raids' is it a cc? I'm looking to get into raiding too soon.
---
How old was the account you had hacked? Was it your original 2006 Runescape account, or was it an account and email created within the past few years specifically and exclusively for creating that account?
---
Authenicator is like a bank pin: it protects certain aspects of your account that are most easily compromised. Nothing is going to protect your account if someone can submit a valid recovery attempt through website due to knowing your original passwords, ISP, creation date, and creation location. Nothing.
---
Very wholesome

The new botting meta
---
omg the fact you got hacked an iron man tbow........ dude ide be curled up in a little ball right now,  saying "wtf reddit" in a pouting crybaby voice.    no lie  i would be.    thats devastating  
---
done that before, its a bitch getting burnt water off the bottom of the pot.
---
nah ,OP definitely had some stufff on his reddit account that makes it easy to compromise
---
It's actually Will Smith.
---
Who woulda thunk it
---
That doesn't make sense to me. I can go to GE and see a guy with a tbow and full Arma, and it shows me his username. How do hacka not happen that way?
---
You'd think he'd get Ranger boots by now...
---
Exactly. - 2FA with sms is concidered bulletproof. For extra security, get a one-time code to disable the authenticator, write it down on a piece of paper and save it in your wallet - just in case you lose access to your phone.
---
Why do hill giants live in caves?
---
Ha! Fool, I’ve got your password now!
---
and is probably the name that's before @gmail.com on his email as well. Which also likely doubles as his log-in email.
---
Saradomin
---
Because hacks happen when you use the same username and password on multiple sites
---
***Why?***
---
So please could you answer why it is hypocrite to vote no if you use a 3rd party client but none of the option so swap prayer/spellbook? Or do I have made another typo so you could bash that instead of answering my question.

True socialism doesn't exist anywhere in Europe. I mean, look at Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, the most socialistic countries in Europe right? Well, no. They're very much capitalistic, but mixed with a tiny amount of socialism. If they were true socialistic, they would've collapsed ages ago.
---
People are wooooshing on this one I think
---
I see a lot of people blaming the guy for this as if it’s his fault. There shouldn’t be a game where it’s this easy to steal somebody’s account. Point blank period. You shouldn’t have to jump through 9 hoops and swim and Olympic swimming pool to keep your account safe. That’s what I’m paying my monthly money for. That is THEIR job not ours. 
---
:( 456
---
Asking the real questions here
---
Don’t keep it? People that camp gargoyles just leave it so try only pick up Alcs, coins and noted items
---
You seem like a nice fella. You don't think Jagex security is lax? The dude's got a 2fa too.
---
Hey Weath can you look into the false perm applied to my ironman? It was a first offense almost 2 years ago. I'm not a cheater and am asking you kindly to look an account that gave me great pride and joy. Name was fittingly "Was an hero".
---
Ranger boots are as common as 1/200, and you can do 25 clues per hour. That means on you can get a 30m+ item in under 10 hours. They are also the only reason that mediums are worth doing. This update absolutely will cause their price to drop, and their drop rate will not be affected by the new update - it will still roll a 1/200 boot drop.
---
Saying the loot is average unless you hit a big drop is like saying GWD is bad money unless you hit a rare. The rates are why you do it. 
---
Also, not trying to be a dick about it, but 500 clues is not abnormal. Mediums are highly camped and you can do literally hundreds in a day. 
---

---
use slay ring and a bank lol
---
lmao what do you mean? 
---
Well, I thought it was pretty cool. You clearly didn't know.
---
I don't think they need a delay I think they should do away with account recovery completely. It's kind of pointless when you could just reset your password through you own e-mail. Every other company that offers 2FA doesn't have a delay and they do just fine without it for example, Steam, Origin, Uplay(I think?) Some of them require talking to someone to get the authenticator removed though which might be a better step.
---
Do you have a job
---
No worries. Good luck
---
Got my first ever 99 on any of my accounts, my younger self would be proud.... but it’s cooking so it feels useless 
---
made me think of those slime blobs that would eat you in ocarina of time

Just curious, did you have bank pin?
---
If so, do you think they somehow social engineered the bank pin as well?

---
Hes probably wishing for another rollback now
---
The real (most likely) reason he got hacked is because Jagex still uses "security questions" which in this age are regarded as security holes. There have been many studies that have shown that security questions weaken the security of the account rather than improve it.
---

---
Wish you'd refund items like every other mmo I ever played. 
---
You’d ideally want different passwords to go with those emails too. 
---
This has got to be the funniest shit I've ever seen. Loses anc robes, gets t bow, flexes on on this shitty subreddit and then loses it all. Universe really does work in mysterious ways
---
Weird..  all I saw was *******
---
Got dropped lmao
---
Most email services have an option to have multiple e-mail aliases under the same 'main e-mail'. The limit for both gmail and outlook is 10 aliases per account. Meaning you can have 11 e-mail addresses under the same login.
---
Passwords should be unique all the time no matter what!
---
Oh then I have no bond to pick with him then. I like Jagex’s bot detection a lot. It’s super smart how they wait it out and ban bots in waves only after they’ve gained a couple hundred million combat, runecrafting, or hunger xp so as not to “reveal their detection methods” 😜
---
Wish they would buff castlewars rewards so it was as busy as it was back in the day
---
Going off of his reddit account, was made this year and doesn't seem to have any personal information to help with recovery questions, also don't get how they got rid of their 2fa.
---
You mean like nightmare zone, the very first "unique" update to osrs in 2013? It's just ghetto dominion tower, the guy's name is even dom. onion.

It wouldn't let me add text on mobile so I'll do it here. Just wondering if there is some way to move the buttons closer to the outside of the screen. Not a big deal but I can't even click through the space

Its under a minute to bank at gargs, why you wouldnt pick up and bank the ore is beyond me
---
To knock out a bunch of quests, do recipe for disaster!

I remember when osrs came out I was SUPER pumped to play it but after like a week of following it and getting my body ready I realized one afternoon "oh man i am dick deep in college with good grades.  I can't be playing an mmo let alone the soul sucking, mega addictive rs"
---
How did you get it quashed? I'm in the same boat.
---
Meet 2007scape reddit, my safe space locked regular Ironman. After recently downvoting all reasonable pvp updates I decided to up the ante to forge my own karma from scratch. Just whining and bitching, but this time I'll say pvpers are ruining my gains. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: still not maxing. 
---
Hey, this is weird! When I type my password, it blanks it out, watch!  
---
********
---
Imagine being this stupid that you don’t understand socialism doesn’t work 
---
It's not witch-hunting by any stretch of the imagination. He did not tell people to go harass, he did not tell people to message or find him in game or IRL. He simply shared someone who is possibly breaking the rules. Theres NO chance he will be harassed in game, and no one will think to message him and say "LMAO you on reddit for botting GG." No, worst case, Jagex will ban him. Which, in all fairness, is what should happen. 
---
There's an even better way to secure your account. I've posted it before but everybody said it was dumb so fuck it, I'll keep my account one of the safest out there. 
---
I have a lot of downtime at work where I can't do active things like PvM or high alching, but I can do skills/activities fletching. What are some good ways to make money with this time that don't require many clicks?

Don’t think you’re gonna get rangers that way mate

Get assambler and vorkath helm

What xp rates are you getting at hounds and what do you think EHP is?

Jakeyosaurus did a vid to get rangers and he lost money with out the rangers.

How can you not have a secure email address? Like its the one thing that's a universal nexus to all of your other accounts, you'd think even the laziest person would secure their email.
---
Just make a new account loooool 4head. 
---
When are we getting authenticator delay?
---
Got this thicc boi at 77 farming, was doing herb runs on mobile and nearly through my phone when i got him because he is the first pet and the one i wanted the most
---
Strength levels *always* matter if you are using potions.
---
Absolutely disgusting 
---
Why is still it that way?
---
One time private-keys of last resort to recover the account would solve that or even a SMS confirmation, or both!
---
If you don't really know how to fix it you should step up and dig about how criptocurrency services solve security issues in the field where there are the biggest incentives for hackers ever (stealing money).
---
Your problem has a solution. Please fix it, the security of my account shouldn't rely on other websites leaks.
---
From a strictly efficiency standpoint no, they aren’t a “great” task. Unless you’re at Cerb.
---
I like your friend lol.
---
Buy a flashcard
---
My favourite was cyclods but I think they're fully discontinued.
---
R4 is another popular one
---
As dumb as it sounds, something similar happened to me on my first grotesque guardians kill.
---
I didnt know the fight, I only knew I needed ranged and melee, so I bring a whip and a rune cbow. 
---
Used a full inventory of brews and super restores, and has 17 hp at the end of the fight. When my guy auto used the rock hammer, he got 1 last hit on me and brought me down to 3 hp.
---
The fight took way more than 8 minutes to complete, now I've got my kills down to around 2:30 and the fight is boring.
---
Nothing was like that first fight though lol. I didnt know it was basically a safe death either and I was risking a couple mill.
---
Amount of green d'hide traded lmao: https://i.imgur.com/gD0Tkos.jpg

Yes easily

Menu Entry Swapper on RuneLite helps

Dude literally said that he "venge ags maul stack" people when they least expect it, imagine casting Vengeance and using 100% of your spec to kill a clue scroll hunter LMAO. Actual brainlet
---
Excuse me Wtf
---
he literally wasted 15k on that that he could put into construction, so inefficient
---
You call Jagex retarded and then cry when I call you one LOL. No their security is fine, no one who takes precautions for their account gets hacked except by Jed.
---
hunter2
---
unless his username is also login (old account) it's not possible
---
Sorry to sound like a dick and the majority of people seem to think this is the answer as well, but this is such bullshit. My old main got hacked by several high ranking Oblivion members after first joining their clan, it was my fault for using similar information on their website, for some reason I thought I could trust them. However, I did have a completely separate and secure email that I used for the account which has a different Authenticator than the OSRS one, linked to my phone. Jagex’s shitty account security didn’t even bother going through that somehow. My account was recovered and thus compromised forever, so I basically stopped playing him after that. The 2FA on our email is complete bullshit I know other people who have gotten hacked on OSRS through it also, even though it works everywhere else. 
---
Jagex please please please fix your shit

---
Maybe and I am spit balling here some people including pvmers don't want to the continual move to ezscape.  Remember autocast, remember attack style, spec button, etc.  None of it is any better in pvp how does anyone who uses these and not f keys expect to get any better at the game.  Pvmers are widening the gap themselves. 
---
It's crazy how much mental gymnastics people like you go through to 'prove' that you can 100% protect your account.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't get hacked from just rsn right? Don't you need the info that person logs in with? This would mean email, or username for older accounts. A follow on question would be since I have an older account that uses a very old username, wouldn't a very old username be harder to find than an email associated with the account? My log in is my original username from like 03-04, so I feel more comfortable with that being my login information than the email I use for it
---
I’m sure this has worked on so many people
---
They're not even PvMers lad, half this sub are shit mid-tier mains lol 
---
Login with remember for 30 days checked. Logout, x out of client. Reload. Should fix it
---
To add to this, a surprising number of people talk about their first pets' names on /aww (a lot of the posts are "meet x, my first animal" or "my first x passed, here's photo from the past),  their mother's maiden on /raisedbynarcicists, and the town they were born (which is most likely the one they currently live in) in various places.  
---
Yes, you are. I'm upset that jagex puts PvM content that has nothing to do with pvp in the wilderness to provide fodder to brainlets.
---
Would you be ok with Jagex removing all PvM content from the wilderness since the wilderness is all about pvp?
---
Western province elite is pretty useless if you're not a hardcore tbh

People have fun different ways. Some enjoy killing big dogs, some enjoy chopping trees and then some enjoy just going out to kill players. Doesn’t make him a knob or anything
---
Except, In order to risk the same amount as a pure you have basically 0 ko potential. Pures are theoretically better for learning if you expect to die a lot and don't have a ton of money to fund sets of rune or mystic or whatever.

I was getting this yesterfay when I tried to log in, seemed to be an issue with the authenticator, changing the time on my phone to match up with the actual time seemed to fix it and let me log in.

At least you have the karma from the original post, right?

If they have no one dedicated only or neither hire a consultant expert on security like ever it would be revealing lmao

I know people like that and I can respect it. It's nothing personal lol. I don't pk but I'm getting better at keeping my composure when I'm attacked and escaping.

Hope you get your items back.
---
It's sad that players have to resort to front-page reddit attention for genuine issues which should be solved via the ticket system, but cannot currently be done so. But that is 100% how it is.
---
Yes he knows that, but no older version of runescape had every one as green
---
Haha, I bought 2k dragon bones yesterday at about 2.2k each and looked again this morning and saw they've jumped almost 100gp a piece. 
---
Plus if you're 1 tick flicking, which these auto clickers do, you're getting piety or whatever your max offensive prayer is the entire time as well.
---
This is a perfect example of why so many people become ironmen.

I'd say that depends on what you're rocking.  If you're in ahrims and d'hide without rigour or augury it might be better to sell it and use at least part of it for better gear. 
---
There's nothing stopping you from doing group ironman unofficially. Make a new account with some friends and make a rule to only trade between yourselves. 
---
It worked on me but the guy must have felt bad because my password is still the same and no one ever took it. 
---
...it wasn't a great account. 
---
Iron men cant trade, thus cannot real word TRADE.
---
Resizable.
---
Without attempting to be too biased since this is an OSRS subreddit, OSRS is the most popular game based on number of active players.
---
OSRS also does not have microtransactions apart from bonds which you can purchase for membership. Microtransactions were one of the main reasons why people quit runescape (now RS3).
---
Yes
---
Lmao plese show me where I've complained about dying to PvP in this thread? A little trouble with the reading comprehension perhaps?
---
The real question who in their right mind wouldn’t be amazed by that cock?
---
Crafting to 80 for a master clue, probably will work towards 99 afterwards
---
Full Black D'Hide on Entrana emote clue clever AF
---
Either via recovering the account with personal info like others said or no 2fa on email so they gained access to the email then removed the RS authentication.
---
its fun becouse there is a chance of nice loot does not matter stack of runes, house tab stack, teleport scrolls or opened clue casket like pages, or even a cash stack, its fun becouse you NEVER know what you are going to get thats the biggest fun factor in it.
---
Great, they ruined it
---
Why do you think everyone’s overdosing on drugs here but not everywhere else? Probably that one unit of corruption that allows pharmaceutical companies to prey on consumers to a level unheard of in other countries. Did you know that prescription drugs can only be advertised in two countries, the US and New Zealand? Almost as if these factors are connected and you can’t just hyper focus on one statistic like GDP.
---
hey just curious as to what exactly this is? I get the crab meme but don't actually know what it will do for us?
---
Thank you someone speaking some fucking sense! 
---
Dude... change your ign.... that is why you got hacked.
---
no, there were a lot of server issues
---
If you want afk, take your best gear into NMZ with 5 super combats, the locator orb and the rest absorbs. You can afk in the middle for 20 mins before you stop attacking so just set a timer for 20 mins and drop health the 1, repot and reabsorb. You can gain like 1m XP per day doing this 99% afk.
---
can't sell a tbow, if u cant trade it lul.
---
Where’s the point of this post? It’s literally someone getting asked what boots they’re wearing.
---
The game is working as intended, actually
---
Recently I've been playing my main and ironman only. I used to have those, plus my fishing alt and 3 c ball accounts to pay for membership. I got tired of the constant clicking and got 99 fishing at barehanded sharks. I ended up buying members for first time in a long time. Sorry bond sellers. 
---
Stupid retard.
---
Why can't you do PvM? There's a lot of good safespot money makers where you can camp until you run out of bolts. You click once every 30 seconds or so if you do Wyverns once you've waited out the aggro timer
---
I'd image it would actually look really cool if the helmet was changed to be more similar to the original.
---
I don’t know if you know how drug over doses work but generally when someone dies of a drug overdose they don’t die while being treated. The healthcare systems in every other country in the world does seem like a true statement however other countries in the world are using tax dollars for health insurance so you are still paying a good amount for health insurance and in many places this means that the supply of skilled doctors is lower or the definition of skilled doctors is lowered. Also much of the new developments in medicine happen in the United States for the reason that they are compensated for developments for life saving drugs or what not instead of the government telling them what they will pay
---
I bet you waste xp other places too so this doesn’t matter much 😂 
---
They don't come here and I don't think the teams actually communicate. The thing is, how do we systematically spam it with our crab memes without it being brigading?
---
Fair enough. I have never understood clan pking. I don't also don't get why people gotta say toxic stuff when they pk someone. It's like kicking someone that is already down... Alot of pvmers probably just see the worst of the pkers as there are large amounts shit pkers that stay specific to whatever pvming content they want to pk at. I've run into quite a few of them that don't fight back and are just trying to run because they only want to kill the defenseless...

RIP flexing iron meme

It's a false sense of security.
---
I made the right choice
---
I see no need for this in the game
---
Again, the key difference is that he only does it to make other people not have fun. It's great that this game lets you do whatever floats your boat, but it could very much do without that sort of toxicity.
---
The wilderness is not, and has never been entirely about PVP.   
---
It has rewarding content that comes with a risk of being PK’d.  Look at the abyss, green dragons, and rune rocks, things that have been there for ages that follow this idea. 
---
They’ve continued this with lava dragons, wilderness bosses, resource arena, etc.   
---
So nah, I wouldn’t be about that because the idea that the entire wilderness should be strictly PVP is not at all correct.  
---
silly billy
---
Should I be using damage prayers on them?  I've been trying to flick piety?eagle eye, but I'm thinking maybe I should just focus on rotation and not get damaged
---
You don't need 2 different emails unless you already practice bad security habits like reusing passwords across websites/services or not taking full advantage of things like MFA offered by your email provider.
---
Basically use a password manager, have unique passwords for all of your accounts online, and set MFA whenever a site/service support it. Preferably in this order of type: Security Key (Yubiko/FIDO etc) &gt; Google Authenticator/Authy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SMS (SMS has been shown to be vulnerable to SIM hijacking so avoid using it unless it's the only type offered, since no MFA is still worse than SMS).
---
Yeah it is Google it and they have a dicord as well🤘
---
Add me in game if you wanna learn together
---
Pm me for ign, cheers
---
Witch hunting was poor phrasing on his part.
---
If you look at the side bar, this post is specifically against the rules of the sub.
---
I'm not high enough level to do any money making combat except like barrows, which is way more attention than I have while at work.
---
I think a necklace or something with charges to maintain aggro or create aggro against monsters that normally arent aggressive would be a good alternative to this.
---
I literally gave you a rule of thumb for tediousness. 
---
Even Jagex accepts that people really want these clients, considering they are very well aware of them and decided not to ban them. Yet somehow nobody here is complaining that we can't bot. The importance of QoL is recognized well, except by you apparently who insists it's bad because tediousness is apparently integral to this game or something.
---
What part of the game takes place underwater?
---
You haven't done much Slayer.
---
I got to 80 magic a few months back and I did straight String Amulet spell to 99 just chillin on mobile
---
Lol all my bank has is a username and password. And everything else in life. RuneScape shouldn't need to be my most secured account in life. It's a game.
---
Jmods are incompetent and lazy af. Wonder if all those prize winners ever even got their prizes
---
If you were to remove authenticator, you would have to wait a few days before it actually removes so your account isn’t being jacked 
---
Diary Cape allows you to trim Quest Cape. Diary cape can be trimmed at will if you have it.
---
Jmods probably don't read this thread. Sometimes they'll make a thread asking for questions for their Q and A stream, and it will be stickied over this one.
---
I cannot comprehend how you don't understand it is a game that is played the way it was intended. 
---

---
Here is a good post about pyramid plunder. As you can see it's not really worth going for the mummy tombs.
---
very....
---
&gt;Imaging sitting down and using the in-game instruments from the observatory to do a coordinate clue.
---
You mean the way is was for years?
---
So no head?
---
Aaaah yes, thanks for explaining
---
No joke a giant ogre boss in the swamp would be sick
---
You smaller fossils should be filling the 3 spaces on the second row so that the 4 bigger ones can all be in a line and please me aesthetically. 
---
Good effort but you know you can do better.
---
7/10
---
All PvM content is literally designed to drag out fodder. There is no PvM  content in the wilderness that is more GP/hour than some non wildy PvM content. It's a joke imo.
---
For real? Had no clue. What a joke...
---
The account doesn't start off with the hijacker. This way it doesn't reach that point.
---
Lmao. Someone been looting.
---
My favorite ones are the GPU plugin, skybox (so OSRS doesn’t look like it’s in the middle of some eternal void), animation smoothing, ground items (labeling items above a certain gp), idle notifier (gives you a notification when you’re afking an action and you stop, like fishing), boosts information, and NPC tagging
---
Should have censored the run energy ...
---
24 hours a day since 1988 😏
---
But you’d have to a psychic to know it was coming and when to take advantage of it for your specific account 
---
You can still buy ranarrs -&gt; making potions -&gt; sell potions -&gt; repeat but you will lose some of the profit margin that you would've gotten if you bought them a bit cheaper and sold them for a bit more. It's probably still 300k an hour with your cash stack
---
Clearly fake as the best item, the brine saber, is still there
---
But that’s the entire point? It’s not compulsory, so there can’t be any forcing. You can simply choose not to do content you don’t want to do, and you can choose not to go in the wilderness.
---
It's gp, its a game. I play for fun, if I'm not having fun I hop off. I don't flip out and lose my shit when something a little crappy on a video game happens. I've never looked at gp differently, I've just seen it for what it was, a game. Too many people get caught up in this shit like it's the end of the world.
---
Thank you :)
---
OMG... My heart.. it's broken.. the internet has ruined me :(
---
That sounds fun; it just needs more people to whup. I think jagex could do a better job advertising Castle wars to f2p. I'm sure most of the new f2p mobile players have no idea that it's f2p now and how to get there.
---
Hodor
---
It can also save you a couple clicks when runecrafting and trivialize certain bosses and activities. Mostly memorization related stuff afaik.
---
uh no, +4 strength bonus is only a full +1 max hit at 160 effective strength level. in other words if you're like 90+ strength with a super strength, slayer helm and praying
---
otherwise it's only part of a max hit
---
This is easily the best response in this thread.
---
The most likely scenario is no, but I have seen it happen in very large companies all the time so you never know.
---
I remember it worked on me and I immediately flipped and logged out to change my pass. Account saved!
---
Same. I've never panicked so much and quickly changed my pass. 
---
Wouldn't everyone just go PVM for money then?
---
What'd they say?
---
Then your email address is not secure.
---
Don't forget to bring an occultist for that extra damage to eldritch, and a chance at crazy healing (but usually you'll just heal a 0 when you really needed a big heal and your crusader dies)
---
&gt;794/800
---
No bank pin, no authenticator
---
He said password, not username.
---
There is 1 exception, and that's the mythical cape. Otherwise, it'll be +1 max hit, minimum.
---
Hi OP's alt. Obviously RWT. 
---
You have no idea if they’d do it for a normal account or not. Nobody else has made it to the front page of customer support for this extremely specific issue yet.
---
Doubt
---
Assembler&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;range cape, it gves tbow like 3 or 4 max hits
---
so you lost expensive stuff but not all those tradable items you can easily rebuild with? alright seems legit, you wouldnt be left with those if you got hacked
---
Are you a hardcore? Then rune pouch. Other wise herb sack unless you are really really poor
---
Isn't that what the hunter2 meme is about?
---
If the password actually gets censored now, they could just keep it in local memory and replace your password with a random amount of asterisks without cross referencing with the password DB.
---
Not super secure, but if you have something on your computer scanning the memory for your OSRS-password you'd have bigger issues on hand.
---
When I got my original void (2 years ago or so) there were so many bots, and there were very frequently players who tried to make you lose by using doors in the worst ways possible.
---
At the time, the veteran boat on the standard PC world had probably a 25% winrate. Eventually, I saw someone advertising a CC for PC on alternative worlds, and was able to grind it out with other people who gave a shit.
---
Seems like it's changed since then, which is good.
---
Multivariable was way easier than Calc 2. It was just all the basic Calc 1 stuff with an extra step. Summations was the real bitch.
---
OP makes post about getting tbow then hacks himself for this screenshot and posts it to reddit in a 900IQ move to advocate for authenticator delay.
---
Yeah I know, but it forces me to write my thoughts down meaning I can convey these concepts better in the future. Also I learn weird bits just by googling things (Maduro straight up printed money to combat the oil price decline lmao).
---
They took a tentacle but not the 2 tridents right next to it? Or the black mask? Calling bullshit here
---
Thanks for the helpful post. I got the combat bracelet. The thing about me is I tend to grind my way to a satisfactory level to get the armor I really want, then just play the game without worrying about grinding. I definitely want to work by way up to the Dragon Defender and, maybe before that I might level my magic to get a Guthix cape or something in the mage minigame. 
---
Seeing a few 1m+ barrows items in there, hm...
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'
---
Sure did! I'll probably hold on to torstol then, even though I don't really intend to grind out 70+ in construction anytime soon.
---
Thank you! ♡
---
No, you just did your math wrong.
---
Can someone explain why the various parts are covered in red? And why he/she is getting shit for it? I’m new to the sub and returning to OSRS after quitting in like 2005 haha shits all new to me
---
Using the high scores you can use their levels to find their username. 
---
Should go without saying, anytime you post a screenshot, always black your name out.
---
your math must be incredibly wrong, because for it to increase your dps by 0.0005, then your accuracy would have to be less than 1%, which unless you're a lvl 3 trying to hit a boss monster, i don't think is even possible...
---
Recovery system is broken.
---
STILL no auth delay after the entire community has been reeeing about it for years.
---
Why is this still happening.
---
Why cant Jagex be fucked to actually secure peoples accounts or offer real customer service.
---
WoW charges only 4 dollars more and has easily 20x the level of customer support.
---
If I lose all my shit in wow, its restored.
---
In osrs jagex can admit a hack or recovery was partially their fault and tell you to fuck off.
---
I have no experience myself by have seen this question some times before. It seems to largely depent on how many people you can get to advertise for your house, either by paying people to or by using alts with autoscript (definitely don't do this). Depending on popularity and usefulness of the house I have seen people report tips of 5M+/h but it seems to fluctuate heavily
---
I'd say you should prioritize different passwords rather than different emails :D
---
Thanks for the free tbow sucka 
---
my username was never posted anywhere and i havent played the account for a long time, because ive been playing ironman mode. i dont think they added 2step because i can see in the google authenticator app that its still linked to my acc.
---
It could've been disabled by the hacker
---
Then nobody's email address is secure. Unless you literally only use it for RS (which seems to be a good idea). 
---
Don’t be ashamed of being suicidal after 99 rune crafting it’s a totally normal reaction to that level of cancer  
---
at 500 kc you must know it at least on a subconcious level surely
---
There’s people at the G.E. In every world wearing max gear, is what they’re doing just as reprehensible? Literally just wearing max gear?Blaming the victim here is idiotic, it reminds me of the argument “look what she was wearing, she was asking for it”.
---
If you have two factor email and two factor runescape acc security, you shouldn’t be able to get hacked. The problem is that accounts get recovered, and that’s up to jagex to be more careful. 
---
Would be a fun way to get niche accounts to play the minigame, I like the idea.
---
yeah i didn’t think i’d have to point that out 
---
I guarantee I would still be running Barrows over Castle Wars.
---
Contact support

they left 3 onyx aswell fact is they took the items worth alot my bank went from 1.8b to 122m
---
LOL

---
Well, I recall posts about it after the recent rollback. I think Ash did comment on some, but not sure which were trades and which were GE.
---
I would love to see some evidence. 
---
If this is true that’s another oopsie woopsie 
---
Thanks
---
I’m sure I can find a way
---
True that :D
---
Yea, I prefer to copy paste my passwords from a TrueCrypt volume
---
More like brought to you by the 40kc tbow split gang
---
What happened to the rune scim?
---
Legends quest and depending on how long it takes to get magic logs, desert treasure. Once those are out of the way I have a straight shot at the last part of RFD and can get my barrows gloves! 
---
Only 71 cmb on my hcim and I’ve been stacking up the combat upgrades on my character this week. Neitznot, D scim, Climbing Boots, and Fighter torso all in the last couple days. Gearing up to try and rush through early slayer, really excited!
---
Is that a gay club? I've never seen a club full of just dudes before.
---
This is true too
---
I'm assuming they recovered his account, when you recover an account the authenticator is removed automatically, this is why there are constant posts suggesting Jagex adds authenticator delay. 
---
Herb sack it is then! But how does being poor affect this decision?
---
We're in oddly similar situations, down to the timing and skill. I'm just at 900k left instead of 600k. Congratulations my dude, it's fuckin' awesome &lt;3
---
Orange fire can't compete
---
Word 'round the office is that you got a fat cock
---
Same bullshit happened to my ironman too, after trying various channels for help, I decided to talk with my bank and I managed to chargeback all my payments to Jagex going back to 2014. I urge you guys to do the same aswell, because on top of the money you get back from them, they will be charged some extra fee. I'm still here for the swampletics and the good memes, but after so many fuckups (RoT, Jed, no support, etc.) I decided to stop wasting my time (and money) on them.
---
What? Just use a different password for your email and its not hackable in that way. Add 2FA to prevent anything short of a hacker physically stealing your phone. Its not hard.
---
I desperately want a fire cape keychain but no one makes them
---
Why am I not allowed to downvote a post with no content?
---
It’s okay man I snagged a 25% on one of my calc 2 exams, the one on sequences and series. I managed an A- in the class though because my professor was the GOAT and allowed us to replace our lowest exam with our final exam score if we did better on the final than the rest of our exams, so I studied my ass off and killed the final. Calc 2s a bitch
---
Never 
---
With seaweed it’s significantly lower, 5k seaweed is like 8m xp if you use ultra, less than half of that if you don’t.
---
Your math is wrong, there's n-p where p is password length combinations to check. You only need to choose one position, the start point, your answer would be if we had to choose two positions.
---

He's not that good of a raider so he probably uses them for rooms like Shamans and Mystics.

Get your varrock diaries done for a few battlestaves every day.
---
The bulk of your xp is probably best done by glassblowing molten glass into unpowered orbs and selling them. It's usually very cost-effective xp, (2gp/xp'ish) and is pretty fast (90k/hr+ iirc). 
---
That's what she said
---
Got em.
---
Well no shit use a different password, but you made it sound like only idiots can get their email hacked. Even with 2FA on an email, your password is still going to get leaked at some point. Unless you sign up to literally 0 websites. 
---
Hey OP,
---
 with the amount of info I was able to find out about you and your osrs account, I may be able to hack your account back. Give me a minute.
---
“You botting?”
---
“No on mobile”
---
“Oh ok lol”
---
They haven’t. 
---
Great, can you ask the person responsible why there's no delay on removing the authenticator?
---
I've heard that it's just bots who clear the bank and trade stuff over. The bot probably didn't recognize the barrows as important/valuable for some reason?
---
I have this issue on mobile a lot. Can’t find a fix
---
The program itself does i'm sure since its not a registry added installed file. BUT, both programs take screen shots every single time you level, or get a boss KC. So if you worried on space, you might want to find that feature in the settings of OSB or RL and turn it off. 
---
Here’s your upvote for voting no on all pvp content.

I'd love if you or anyone else would be able to shed some light on what happened to my alt account a while back:  
---
I log into my alt to find that my PIN was being reset. I immediately checked my account page and my authenticator had been removed.  
---
This account is linked to a gmail with 2 factor authentication.  
---
My access logs showed only my devices and only my IP.  
---
I had **NO** emails regarding any of this.  
---
This was not a RAT or anything of the like. My main account was absolutely untouched.  
---
I Tweeted @JagexSupport and you can see how helpful they were: https://twitter.com/Dgc2002/status/1084603536070070272  
---
I can't even get help figuring out what method was used to compromise my account.  
---
I've been so pissed off about this because I'm absolutely helpless unless I manage to get a reddit thread with traction.  
---
And to get ahead of some questions:  
---
No, this password is not one that Troy Hunt has in the HaveIBeenPwned hash database.  
---
This password was not reused from another site.  
---
I have an antivirus(NOD32).  
---
I run Malware bytes.  
---
In general I'm a security conscious individual.

Who actually values the education system when it comes to the money grab that university’s and colleges are? Scape all day my man

&gt; @JagexSupport I logged into my second account to find my bank PIN in the process of being reset and that my authenticator was removed. My linked email(has 2FA) shows no activity from an IP that isn't mine. I'd love some help figuring out how this happened and how to avoid it.

You don’t need 70 agility for that 
---
Idk what it could be, I have no history of offenses, no mutes I don’t even think I’ve been reported, I made my account on mobile release and have been on mobile until the last couple days since my wife bought me a computer. I’ve been on runelite because of hope much more helpful it is as far as items and where to click for rooftop courses. I’m upset about it but I’m an adult now with a family so maybe this is a sign to drop the nostalgic game and move on. Idk but it just sucks thinking of the time I wasted. 
---
Men struggle because people struggle. Don't pretend no man struggles. 
---
Bruh they just wanted someone to double their 6m gp, they had no idea it could go wrong
---
Ah finally. I thought we were going to make it a full 4 days before this was posted again
---
every time I see something you’ve written I cringe, please get hit by a bus moron.

Ironic toxicity here btw
---
Women aren't either you SJW cunt
---
No, something's are actually difficult
---
Oh ur a btw, nice shield bro
---
You can buy a t6 emblem off of other players for around 1.2m and use the t6 to buy a rune pouch
---
I'm more thinking about real life issues and how men are more affected, affected to the point that they trade in real life for a virtual 1... if you think the depression rate and male suicide rate are not a problem then that's you; I think a game that depends on men to continue should at least be trying to uplift all their players and not just the minority... 
---
I appreciate your concern
---
It’s safe and the best 3rd party client imo. 
---
Did they give any evidence, mine said they couldn't give any. I wouldn't care that much  about the ban if they atleast gave a little bit of information
---
No you can set it to not require the bankpin if relogging within 5 minutes on the same device and IP address or something like that. 
---
My best guess here is someone went on your account and botted
---
This player didnt thought and they blame jagex for it
---
Motherlode Mine? 
---
Shit man you should’ve botted then 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Maniacal_monkey/Strategies#Ranged%20
---
Because you're not an ironman
---
Raised the way I am? What makes you think you have any clue about my upbringing? Do you actually not realize how big of a condescending fucknut you are?
---
I remember getting my first 99; it was firemaking as well! Couple months later I have 4 99s and my firemaking just hit level 106! Good luck and have a good day :)
---
Good job pal. Now it’s time to master the Zul
---
We don't teach CS in schools over here..  
---
Why would you not progress in a game because you throw away some in game money? Seriously if you struggle to make money for a bond and progress you're worse at RS than you are at CS.  
---
Keep going.
---
It was so funny it made me shat my pants
---
Is also possible you used a fake runelite client of course unknowingly and got your info taken and account botted overnight
---
Lol just lol if you don't automatically join Yellow Fortune because they're closest to the bank and you already went to mom for recruitment drive
---
I didnt make this point yet, but being able to continually imrpove is one of the main components to keep people interested in your game. 
---
So going from simply casting, adding a staff switch, adding another switch, activating a prayer in between, adding a 3rd switch, doing it even faster for a 1 tick and/or adding a 4 way switch, etc. all things that one works on and improves. However since inventory is limited 5 way and above switches arent necessary to learn. Lowering the skill ceiling to potentially lower barrier of entry is bad (especially in this case where it simply wont lower barrier of entry, no one is gunna 1 tick with an update first week of pvp).  
---
But yes cost and time investment should be worke on. They are the most important. Being able to set stats to below ur current level and just add level reqs to all quest items is the way to go. 60 60 60? Simply set ur def to 1 and u got a alright pure. Or 99x3 and want to pure pk? Easy. Also helps out the clan scene because now pures can join the main acene and mains can join the pure scene. Also shows the retarded argument “ you choose to limit urself.”  
---
Cost can be greatly improved by simply providing food and pots. Pvm makes up the vast majority of using those resources anyway. 
---
I dont kill them for ether, i kill them hoping for Dlegs or skirt, i dont want to camp skeletal wyverns because they take ages to kill with my gear even if i am sfespotting them, and i one shot imps.  I also cant kill higher level revs because im an ironman and people always tag or steal the kill if i dont kill them in under 4-5 hits, which i cant becuase of the bad gear i have.
---
Lol it said something like 
---
Evidence: Jagex something something 
---
going down her task list i missed ankous (which youd do w/ msb) and i missed kalphites (again, msb) 
---
and thats the end of tasks youd do, so I'm really not sure what I'm missing especially assuming op is a lower level.
---
People getting Ddos’d would be another one. But there’s no way of proving you were just cus your ISP shit itself for a few seconds. 
---
is this bait
---
Wonder what the cost is bursting to 94 from 70
---
Dude, this is the most accurate comment.
---
Watch this new method to loose your T Bow!
---
Let left you so much.  Amatures.
---
It's absolutely a problem, but that's not the way to solve it. Just let the day be a thing and go about your life.
---
Nah, I just value my free time more than you do kid, I'd much rather pay 24 cents a day than waste 1 hour a week of my time.
---
Well, it is to the point that if you don't trust it, you can download the source code yourself and compile it after reading through it. While the official client is technically the safest option, RuneLite isn't far behind.
---
And no, you won't get banned using it. Most third-party clients are allowed as long as they don't give a definite gameplay advantage, like macros.
---
That's like 90% of all cute noob shit posted on this sub. People eat it up
---
Your not wrong, the successful suicide rate of men vs woman doesn't "convince" me that there is a systemic issue in which men don't feel empowered to live anyway they want.  The reason that wouldn't convince me is I would never look at that statistic in a vacuum as that would lead to some silly conclusions.  
---
I do encourage you to leave the conversation though, you do not appear to be well prepared for it.
---
We all know what happened. 
---
Did u just completely ignore the second half of my sentence? Brainlet lmao.
---
If you really didnt' bot then I hope this gets sorted and you get your acc back, but there's been a strong history of people claiming they dindu nuffin' but they actually did... 
---
Weird request, man.
---
Nope you can get the mask anytime, just make sure you talk to Oziach, get barrows gloves from your barrows chest, and get 99 runecrafting.
---
If you happen to have an UIM that is land locked to Morytania because you decided to "up the ante" by going on a journey to complete one of RuneScapes toughest challenges, The Theater of Blood. Then the Amulet of the damned would be one of the best options available to you. When using any barrows set. 
---
Tasteful
---
i just said i did
---
but it's a necessary evil when you're trying to tell someone they come from a culture of ignorance
---
Yes it is. Runelite hacks the game just like a hottie client does. Still, I doubt that’s what you were using since jagex is still currently letting people have the game.
---
yes that is correct. you just have to have completed Cabin Fever and have right slayer lvl to kill also Witchwood icon
---
Ok for clarification, my RS name everyone sees is the same as one of my Reddit accounts. However, I type a different name into the login screen cause I made the account in 2003. Is this still a potential problem?
---
Also the password is unique which I'm sure helps but I still am curious.
---
As much as having a separate password and email for everything sucks ... this probably sucks more. I chose the first option and have never had any issues ever, I’d suggest it for the future. Unfortunately all you can do is learn from this and move on.
---
It aint 2009 no more. Regular scans haven't been a requirement since windows 7
---
How is it a meme if it’s reality?
---
people who think a skill ends at 99....
---
uh I joined and literally nobody has acknowledged me.
---
no ur right... coding into ur runelite to make a bot program is botting tho? or maybe you used a other program and but the blame into runelite... bots get detected because they click on the same second like all their other clicks they don't miss clicks their mouse teleports... etc
---
i highly suggest you take a quick trip through the stronghold of security

strange they left gp usually they take everything...

Why does socialism inherently fail when faced with corruption? What’s the mechanism you’re imagining there?
---
Hell yea dog. Haven’t met or seen a single ‘scaper yet at UK.
---
Nice bank pi... oh you didn’t have one set, not the games fault.
---
not reading any of that, you're irrelevant 
---
Open source software are usually most safe (hard to implement shady code with large  userbasis).
---
A placeholder isn't proof though that you lost the time? The guy who got refunded had video proof.

I was hacked in 2006 for like a rune chain and legs that I was wearing. Ever since then I refuse to log off with anything on me.

Depends on age of the account and whether it's considered goldfarming, aswell as probably just randomness because if everyone who bots gets a 2 week ban for the first offence, a lot of legit players will just bot until their first ban
---
Come on man, I clearly didn't say no man struggles.  I used the term "men" to say the entire gender is not struggling just because they are men.

Why is Oziach important?

I think it's worth personally. Saves an invent slot - could wear an ancestral hat and take a mage cape switch, would result in a damage increase i think

Jagex isn't going to waste manpower remaking everything in the kebos lowlands, for example, on a game that has a core marketability that has nothing to do with graphics.

Posting d claws and tbow on a social media platform within 50 kc of each other in a week isn't gloating? The more you know! Most players don't even post loot drops.

I likeeeee, especially the guthix one

Oh, you mean like you keep doing? Thought as much

Google zilrah helper. It’s a webpage where you click on zulrahs second phase and then it gives you the location of zulrah for the rest of the fight.
---
That’s even more shady because it will require a java plug in most likely. Basically no matter what someone will notice you doing whatever you are doing, and you will be fired most likely. Any company that’s not retarded monitors all activity on its networks, and often times firewalls will block any type of non work related activity to begin with 
---
Why would you want poll results hidden
---
Why? They are good item sinks and add fashionscape potential into the game.
---
They can't wait to split that 30 ways
---
I don't really get what people expected.
---
there are very few poll questions where votes matter. The ones that are super close often do get repolled.
---
IF jagex was going to drastically rework how they used the poll system (eg only poll controversial questions, only poll very broad design goals) sure. might do something to hide results.
---
The mindset of most players back then vs now is completely different. I bet if polled most would vote yes to remove the wilderness these days.
---
Those are the glory days. Savor every step.
---
Listen man I know what you mean, 90% of the issue is between the chair and the keyboard.  And I think it's fair on Jagex to not refund any lost items due to a compromised account.  But like me when I was hacked, most users would just like to know what happened.  Or given a better method of account security.  I'll put it like this 
---
My account (or everyones) is like my car.  And right now the only option I have now is to park it in my driveway, and lock it. And we all don't live in a great neighborhood.  It would be nice if we could get some CCTV cameras up watching our cars to catch the thieves, but they can't watch everyone's car.  There are too many.  So give me a garage to park it in.  And make our phones or some other device the only garage opener we have.  That way the only way someone can get into my garage is to physically steal my phone.  Or wait 7 days for the repair guy to come help me open it.
---
The only way into my email is for me to hit a "yes this is me signing in" on my phone. It would be cool if I had that option for Runescape.  Also It is one of the biggest MMO's out there and they can't even make their own authenticator app?  Blizzard has one, Steam has one, why can't Jagex have one?
---
Oof jagex ... Why...
---
Random characters are definitely more secure than other passwords of the same length, for example "password1234" is 12 characters, but a computer would guess it very quickly, because it is on a list of common passwords which are attempted before brute forcing all passwords.
---
You also seem to be underestimating how long brute forcing takes. Even if a hacker could send 100,000 login attempts per second (no way Jagex allows this), it would take as long as the age of the universe to try all 12-character passwords.
---
To top off, people will feel more compelled to *doing* their clues when they got a 5 stack. If anything, they'll feel *pressured* to do it more cause they can then spend their time not worrying about "missing out" on new ones while doing their next long term skilling task.
---
All you did was ask a question
---
Lol, my assumptions are based on actual evidence, yours are based on me having enough money to be able to enjoy the game differently than you.
---
Keep trying.
---
Favorite is a Tail of Two Cats! Least favorite isn’t a surprise, Monkey Madness II.
---
Everything.. it costed everything 
---
Honestly there are like 10 jmods on the osrs team, and several 100 thousand accounts.  Why people struggle with the idea that only the issues that are brought to their attention get specialized attention is beyond me.
---
Yes it would be better if this wasn't the case, but the fact that it is the case is in no way even remotely surprising or newsworthy.
---
In unrelated news, good luck getting your items back, upvote for visibility etc.
---
Favourite: DS2 - Extremely challenging for me personally, but it got me hooked on learning how to high level boss.
---
Least favourite: Darkness of Hallowvale - Meiyerditch is so devoid of colour that it made me big depressed and it getting from point A to point B felt like agility training.    
---
We don’t have any firewalls I watch YouTube/Twitch/Netflix all day

one time it was like 200 laws and 100k cash bc i was literally lazy. happens a lot.

they probably make more than you think lol

unless this comment was sarcasm i didn't catch

Make your account names different on hacking/botting sites m8 lol

---
Whatever you gotta tell yourself. You lost and didn’t offend me. Deuces.
---
Those are gorgeous! The necks aren't in game are they? I've never seen them before but they look like they might be some cool TT items or something. Maybe they could be added as some random quest item like the Armadyl Pendant alongside these recoulors?
---
From the jmod post on the other thread (saying he should have 2fa on email) I assume his email got hacked, so not necessarily an account recovery problem
---
By that logic then there is no reason why they shouldn't hide the results
---
It's really well known that incest porn is extremely popular for some reason or another.

There are private servers that are very public, and have donators donating thousands of dollars. You're worried about creating a personal private server that won't ever even be made public?

Ok cool, keep making them it's been a laugh.

wait. I thought u could get rid of bank pin instantly if u knew it?
---
You really think that they thought you were supporting them?
---
You're right, you can do this, but for people with no software background that isn't that helpful.  What those people can do is take solace in the fact that others of us HAVE done that and if there were issues they would be known.
---
Bruh
---
Bro what the fuck is this
---
Thats fine by me considering it only so good against magic, which is also extremely powerful for pvp, maybe not in the form of DPS but man are teleblocks and freezes powerful
---
I mean he shouldnt have to. Hcim, pures, uim, and skillers arent protected by bank pin. 
---
How do i do this safely? Can i buy them directly off the player or do I have to do the whole T7 kill someone in wildy thing?
---
"Jagex_Nooldes" is not an official jagex account.
---
Apparently that user is a shit poster, posting all over the Ama. 
---
You can, need to send strong reasons to support tho. 
---
At this point, I want to volunteer my time to help jagex with their customer support system. The improved customer support afterwards would be payment enough.
---
It worries me that after a while Jagex are going to stop supporting people completely, and that's when I'll likely be hacked... even though email and account both have authenticators, email and email password both consist of random letters, numbers and symbols and aren't used on any other sites or services. tl;dr, shit can happen and it will.
---
I nO bOt, WhY bAn (insert brainlet here)?

It is safe, lots of big names use it, just be absolutely sure you are downloading from the one and only source site.

Wow so much skill, this guy got outplayed so hard.

And yet they took out his rings, unimbued them, and traded them over?

Yea I wouldn't write out "the word that shall not be named" either because of the silly controversy around it. But I still believe that people should start actually using the word, or not refer to it at all. Guess that would be impossible to achieve in reality though.
---
I basically only use Reddit for 2007scape. The little other I've seen seem to match with what you're saying about leftist idealogy. Might be a symptom of the up/downvote system, but most likely the site being mainstream is a bigger factor.

If u want a bh group join “bh community” we just chill in there and sell tiers we also have a discord someone can hook u up with if we get on, and I know some people in cc like to go revs. We are mainly pures and zerks but anyone can come chill
---
You’re very naive when it comes to computers OP. And that is fine, this is an opportunity to educate yourself. I once had a guy like you, he would play games or watch Netflix or do other none work related stuff. Because we don’t inherently block sites like like that that are known to be okay sites. My boss has me save all the logs of his activity, when it hit the point where 3-4 of his non lunch hours a day were spent on non work related activities they fired him. Someone. Is. Watching. You. Any. Time. You. Are. On. The. Internet.

It was 3 am but I'm pretty sure i already had a tooth half which is the only part I have in my bank atm and I dont know why I'd be looking at the ecumenical key on the wiki if I got a tooth half. Definitely a possibility, but at this point I dont know anymore haha
---
Jagex lame af
---
Yeah but how would they know it... 
---
Okay, so like, what about your bank pin though?
---
First the Anc bottoms loss from rollback allegedly and now a tbow loss. At first I was suspicious, now I call shenanigans. Either he actually has no account security or hes RWT.
---
That’s kind of crazy when you think about it. Just your rsn alone shouldn’t be enough to get hacked. Guy probably has the same email for reddit and runescape, and the guy was able to get some info through his reddit account. 
---
b8
---
The f is this shit
---
Shoulda had bank pin
---
Mb :/. Thanks for letting me know - can’t believe how sad people are these days they would make a fake account just for an AMA.
---
 Those d boots.... Seriously nigga?
---
If there's any delay at all, I'll click away and miss it. Happens to me with mining, agility, and thieving. I'm all for this suggestion.
---
I mean it’s not enough to get hacked alone, but the reasoning is if no one knows your account name they literally can’t hack you because there’s nothing to hack
---
if u were getting KC to get ur shit back after rollback then couldve been prevented by always having a backup ecu key for a death/dc etc. or git gud and dont die 
---
That’s true. I was more thinking if that were an issue everyone would have to have their rsn blurred in game 
---
actually so mad LOL
---
This post is referring specifically to the OSHD client that had refused to work with Jagex. 
---
Dude I wouldn't be calling people brainlets if I were you.
---
Contrary to popular belief redditors on average are NOT the highest tier of their playerbase(if you're talking about total level, if not you're right) and no matter how many times they get hacked they continue to play the game.
---
Sit goblin boy. Back to lumbridge you go. 
---
I got a 55 on an exam today, came to reddit to forget about it, thanks.
---
The zamorak one reminds me of Konosuba!

so "real" socialism^TM has never been tried, huh?

It's almost as if socialists should never be trusted again.

can you change you name to oak tree after 4 years ?

Not really, again you won't see me complaining about PKers - I PvP myself and have even mentioned earlier how I like the wilderness to be a dangerous place.
---
However, the PKers that go for bare-minamum loot are simply the lowest on the food chain. 
---
Ya and I mean do that if you want. I'm just making it clear why that makes people think pkers are assholes. There's not much more of an asshole behavior than killing people for wasting their times 
---
Um actually its meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked ultimate ironman. After recently maxing my ultimate ironman I decided to up the ante, to forge my own jounrey from scratch. No banking. No trading. But this time I can't leave Morytania, all leading up to eventually taking on one of runescapes biggest challenges... The Theatre of Blood.
---
That would be ideal or alternatively he could rock a 2x2 on the right side and have a backwards L around the bolt tips

Yeah man no offense but the original ones are way better, yours are cool but don't fit the art style of osrs well.

Unless they update the vanilla client of course.

loooool you got BTFO

1. 2fa on email 
---
2. Email that is only used for runescape
---
2. 2fa on rs account
---
3. Bank pin
---
4. Password in game that is only used on runescape.
---
5. Different password on email than rs.
---
6. Different email than log in email for runescape.
---
7. Bank all worn items and items from inventory when logging out.
---
And if you still manage to get hacked you are facing someone who should not waste time hacking rs accounts.
---
Relax lol
---
Arma helm is far from fashionable :(

Wrong, very wrong. All high level accounts DO NOT have wealth. you clearly have no clue what you're talking about

Haha this is amazing, sit your shit down OP a botter and a liar get the fuck outta here pfft waste of space

The t7 kill in the wildy. Anything above t1 is untradeable. If you want to go that route, go to the cc “emblem area” and ask for a RANKED member

Ah you're the guy who got hacked. Best of luck on the HCIM man.

Good man, no longer showing his name!

How about Jagex offer real customer support and delay auth removal like the entire community has been begging for /u/Jagex_Weath
---
Why is Jagex incapable of proper customer service to the point where we have to make reddit and twitter posts to hope for a response.
---
why are we paying 11 dollars a month for incompetence. 
---
Maybe just make it cheaper to block in increments of 25? 
---
Could be imbued, looks like everything left was an untradable they didnt bother to make tradeable.
---
Quick heads up for next time, don’t forget your name is still visible top left :p

Hahahaha you really are the embodiment of a neckbeard alt-right redditor aren't you? Did you have that little list of dictators and war criminals open and ready in notepad? Awwww. Please tell me more about how 70% of Venezuela's economy isn't in the private sector. You should be seriously questioning your opinions because to anybody with a bit of history education, it's clear you have a belief and you'll shoehorn whatever you can to make that reality. 
---
You don’t need to retype pin upon hopping worlds. As long as the log out and relog in are close enough together. 
---
Graduated last year lol just tryna help 
---
yeah i tend to agree its probably not worth the risk. jagex is pretty inconsistant on this issue tho, they'll ban AE to make an example out of him for minicking mousekeys but my friend can gain 14m xp in like an hour using a super illegal script and nothing will happen to him.
---
No, I'm just detailing why people see this kind of pking as asshole behavior. I'm not interested in talking about if you should or shouldn't be an asshole. That's your own choice to make. If you're ok with that, all the more power to you.
---
C'mon mate, don't be like this my bwana
---
This sounds like something Dwight would say
---
"It's just clicking fast!"
---
Every single person in the PvP community is laughing at you right now. Go ahead, take me up on my offer; i'll give you a full year and if you can beat anyone who's considered a top tier hybrid i'll give you $1,000.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Just in case ur not a troll. Uim cant bank, you can die on hcim without knowing bank pin, and pures&amp;skillers can gain xp in unwanted skills without knowing the bank pin. 
---
This shit reminds me of that post where the dude was complaining someone in his CC was leaking his address for everyone to see. He then proceeds to screenshot it and post it on Reddit to get help without censoring his address. I feel for these folks, but sometimes they really do play themselves. 
---
if it wasn't for people pking at green drags then their drops would be worth nothing, tho
---
dude how do you remember your username
---
Brah I lost a guy in one of the last stages to a 0 heal and had to leave (making me lose another person), I ostracized that Occultist by keeping him at the bottom of my roster and never using him again for the rest of that play through...the name Zalam (meaning darkness in Arabic) now brings bad luck 
---
GIVE ME THE SARADOMIN ONE 
---
If I hacked an account and got a twisted bow and dragon claws I wouldn’t be worrying too hard about the smaller stuff. I’d rather get that shit off immediately before the owner notices it’s been hijacked and boots me off. 
---
I wouldn't say isolated but a female community would be nice. (I am the gf)
---
The fact that showing your username is considered “showing too much information” is proof that jagex has to get their shit together on securing accounts. You don’t see this happening on other mmos. Ffs they need an authenticator delay and alerts to disabling the authenticator. 
---
you have to go out of your way to interact with this stuff usually tho
---
Fairy Tale pt 2, cause it takes you to the Gorak's plane and I love that place. It's also one of those quests not very many people complete and it's relatively short and fits nicely in with the lost city story arc.
---
I stared at this for a few minutes hoping there was some hidden message in it.
---
What is the point you are trying to make? That Jagex doesn't care about people getting hacked?
---
Their items are protected (except UIM) but status isn't.

I was Not trolling. The topic was about Account security and Banking, making the mental jump to HC deaths and unwanted XP was just too far without clarification, but is obviously correct. 
---
It’s an actual clan that they want you to apply for but you don’t need it to be in the cc and ask anyone if they want to pk, strange that nobody replied though 
---
Upvoted because this needs to happen. Get this man to front page.
---
Jagex is. 
---
Restart your comp. also if pc type Jagex in your search files delete any cache and then delete anything associated with RuneScape or jagex in your comp. had this problem before and that fixed it.

Are you really going to die on this hill? How can you even defend this? Did somebody create the account in anticipation of you making this post?
---
Why do people think that posting about it will change the fact that they botted like cmon bro u botted just take the ban. And you found evidence of him on that shit yesterday that’s crazy 
---
He usually heals high enough or does enough damage for me to justify almost always using him, but damn if he's unreliable when you need him. I like to keep a cleric in front of the occultist, with him being all the way in the back. Usually good enough for keeping everyone's health up. 
---
Zalam is way too sweet of a name to not use, lick be damned.
---
You’re not paid to guard against them on Reddit, are you? Move along.
---
Maybe best for security, but not for the balance between security and convenience. One of the big benefits of password managers is being able to copypaste or autotype your passwords into things, having to type out a randomly generated 40 character long combination of letters numbers and symbols every time you need to log into something would get old quick
---
Cracking accounts is very easy, nothing is even manual, it’s all automatic, the programmes use hundreds of millions of email:password combos which are linked to Jagex - then it’s just a case of picking and choosing account s with wealth. They probably even have bots which check for account wealth aswell. It’s a huge business especially in games like Fortnite and Apex with rare skins and popularity.
---
Yes, someone traveled back in time to create the account with the exact same name as your reddit username on the botting forum over 24 hours before this thread was posted to just troll you. 
---
Just accept your ban, delete the thread and move on. 
---
He had no bank pin so that wouldnt help

---
Aww it isn't real. I am disappointed.
---
Gz man! I've been runecrafting with you at zeah but I'm at 94, still long journey ahead
---
Or jagex could pop their fucking head out of their ass and use an industry standard authenticator delay 
---
Yeah, uh.. we got nothing.
---
Bad bot
---
Exactly, Do you see how ridiculous that is? 
---
The problem isn't making using specs easier..the problem is how incredibly simple PvP is. 
---
In World of Warcraft PvP (and most mmorpgs) skill is determined by knowing when to use hundreds abilities, good positioning, comboing with your teammates, keeping track of hundreds of your opponents abilities. 
---
In Runescape, it's who clicked their spec bar faster. That's dumb. The PvP is dumb. Acting like that's competitive is dumb. Once you learn how to click in one tick to change armour then spec, you know everything about RuneScape PvP. There's nothing else but praying to the RNG god for big hits. 
---
lol good point
---
Thank you for posting to Jagex Customer Service!
---
You are using Jagex's number 1 (and only) customer service medium, Reddit! Thanks for your post, unfortunately due to budget cuts we cannot review your case unless you:
---
a) cause a community outcry and a few thousand upvotes that would result in bad PR if we don't respond
---
b) you are a famous streamer
---
Thank you again for applying for basic customer service rights to a company that hundreds of thousands of people pay $11 for, may the odds be in your favour! 
---
Authenticator is broken and you can bypass bank pins if you know how like most of these major guys do. Your account is never safe, sorry for your loss OP. I suggest making a new reddit account to show off future drops and cropping out acct info &lt;/3
---
who can i message?

Its just cum, if you think anyone who's tasted their own or someone elses cum is a disgusting animal then probably the majority of the adult world is a disgusting animal to you.. I'm not sure what the big deal is.

This is digusting buisness practices by Jagex. They've always been a company who gives an absolute zero amount of shit about their playet base.
---
The first ever days of runescape was in 2001 I think As well, but the game itself was started back in 1998-1999 it wasnt called runescape at the time, logging into osrs even says down at the bottom, jagex ltd 1999 I believe! 
---
Explore the world, interact with players you meet on the way, look out for quests (blue star icon) on the minimap as you go around the game to learn about the areas. Set goals, my first F2P goal was to complete all of the free quests within the game, this ended up teaching me about all the free areas of the game, obtaining items used the quests and training skills for those quests as well. the quest dialogue and lore is also really entertaining. 
---
Try everything yourself, just because one person says you shouldn't do it then it doesn't mean you won't enjoy it!  
---
www.osrs.wiki is a great resource for information.
---
Idk it seems fishy that he has all the gear he needs to rebuild left.hes still got a ten torso veracs skirt slay helm etc.  He either got the conflicted compassionate hacker or he real world traded
---
Jagex support. 
---
I’d start over, real life is always more important that a game so I can’t blame you for rwt, but if you enjoy the game (and it’s not the reason you fell behind on money) then I would absolutely start playing again. Maybe try Ironman this time around
---
Start over, so the cycle can repeat man. 
---
&gt; don't get how they got rid of their 2fa, seems like it's easy as hell to bypass then?
---
It is, that's why people want an authenticator delay or even an option to completely opt out of the account recovery system. Recovery instantly bypasses any and all security measures you can put on your account
---
&gt; Because they will ~~forget~~ repost it tommorow
---
Well apparently the high reward here is being able to complete that clue step, getting that dpick etc.
---
The Yindips smack down, even jucier. 
---
Very useful comment. Thanks.
---
Whether or not it is worth it or not is up to you. Do you still want to play even if you have to go through the early game? Maybe an ironmeme would spice things up. It’s entirely subjective so no one can answer this question but you.
---
Also how did you have 2b at 150m exp? My main is at 110m and I have a 300m bank.
---
If you have nothing better to do. If you spent too much time playing before then maybe use this as a reason to not get sucked back in like lots of people do
---
I hope you get treatement
---
Sorry about jagex security letting it be so easy to recover your account. Good luck on the hcim!
---
Can't find the thread, maybe someone else that comes across our posts has it bookmarked or something. But anyway, it was someone who got hacked for a 3a long or some shit after posting a screenshot on reddit. The guy who hacked him found his rsn (that he blocked out) because he didn't hide his prayer/hp or some other shit. Also found other info about him, and viola acc got recovered. And the meme about hiding everything, including run energy, the eyes of food in your inventory etc was born. For most ppl its a meme, but it didn't spawn from nothing and has merit (to some of it). 
---
i alway knew Torvesta was girl
---
Runescape’s quest mechanics are extremely similar to old text based games. 
---
“You’re in a room”
---
&gt; Examine room
---
“You find a set of shears on a table by the window”
---
&gt; Leave room
---
“You’re on a farm”
---
&gt; Use shears with sheep
---
“You get some wool”
---
... etc
---
Thanks man :) take it one day at and you will get there
---
Yeah took all of 2 minutes to find way too much info.
---
Change your usernames and drop this reddit account
---
Thanks! I just got a 6% raise today :)
---
fuck yeah dude you own. gz
---
These posts are refreshing rather than the “waaaaah banned for no reason waaaah” posts. I respect honesty man. I would restart though lol
---
That’s what you get for botting, stop being a bitch and take it like a man. 
---
People keep shitting on mechanics working different in pvp and PvM and I'm not sure why.
---
It's the easiest way to cater to each group without bothering the other. On top of that, it's only pvmers who probably never pvp who are whining about this.
---
You can disable recoveries?
---
At the time of my comment I didn’t know that it was just a reddit AMA. I don’t really care either way tbh. Just stating what I and others have discussed in similar topics about video games in general
---
Try it and find out, I am sure you will enjoy the progress until you get bored again, but just don't rwt next time so you can come back to that account again in the future.  
---
Set small goals, achieve them - don't think too much about the long term.
---
I got banned on my first account a long time ago, I learned from my mistake and restarted. I don't regret getting banned, it was a life lesson necessity to stop me from doing it again in the future.
---
You were using osbuddy. 
---
Good luck!
---
Fate has been determined 
---
Good outlook on the game.
---
Have fun with the new account :) 
---
You didn't unlock customer support ability yet. I'll upvote you. Good luck on your quest!
---
That’s shitty, they were probably looking for bossers in multi or heading to rev caves and figured they’d bust anyone in their way
---
So instead they do nothing? Genius 
---
Should have listened to the stronghold 
---
Looks like a possible real world trade
---
If someone was genuinely asking for their girlfriend, how would you phrase this to better convey the point and not be fucking weird?
---
Trust and honesty. Settled was up front with us about the times he stepped out of morytania. He also told us in the beginning that he would if it was necessary for content in morytania.
---
As for the point, it's a challenge. I mean, once you've maxed a UIM account, what else is there to do in this game? You have to get creative.
---
Flipping + for skills like fishing I did Minnows.
---
MDE never dies.
---
Truth is abrasive 
---
What other MMO do you lose your entire account for posting on reddit?
---
So you want to de-iron because you’re afraid you’ll get hacked? So long as your account is completely secure you have nothing to worry about.
---
This honestly seems like someone who is preparing to RWT.
---
But nobody plays it. I think removing the rune cost and giving no xp would be better, or atleast giving you that option.
---
Of course they aren't going to return his shit? That would be incredible retarded, the economy would be ruined extremely fast if they did that.
---
This is way too relatable
---
Imagine having to set up 3 different levels of security for an outdated 18 year old game because of Jagex’s flawed recovery system, and still running the risk of getting hacked anyway.
---
That's pretty terrible do you not boss or anything? 
---
It sounds like you may not have the cash to be playing atm based on having to rwt. I don't mean that in a bad way just an honest observation. Now if real life situations have changed and you do have the time and income to play by all means restart.
---
0kc still no pet. Ill keep praying.
---
🥰😘
---
I full out botted agility as well but I got a 2 day ban. Maybe it helps that I have b gloves and a lot of time played legit. I thought you only get major bot banned if it’s a money-making bot. 
---
JaMfLeX PlZ EmPlOY Me
---
Just as a serious question. Why not make a UiM or something?
---
I have a fairly high leveled ironman and I cant imagine redoing the same game mode. But I've thought about UiM
---
Make sure you use a bank pin and 2fa this time.
---
Judging how Jagex's code review process seems to be fucked (twisted bow) and security is a joke (9000 scammers running rampant with nothing being done about it), I'd say it wouldn't surprise me.
---
Yes, I never run only occultist now as my only source of healing, way too risky...but man those crit 40 heals are orgasmic 
---
How do people get the modernized skill icons like in this image? :o  
---
Btw grats op!
---
Y’all are really shitting on dude like it’s his fault. You should be able to show off loot and be happy without fear of someone stealing all your shit over night. No other game that I’ve paid a monthly sub to has had an issue like this and done little to nothing against it or speak about it. Imagine all the kids who get hacked that don’t use any social media and just happened to be wrong place wrong time. 
---
Imagine using osbot 😂😂😂
---
No, he's saying he initially made it a permanent ironman so a hacker couldn't de-iron him.
---
Take it out and flip it over, should work fine
---
No! This would devalue my spice collection!
---
These are gorgeous 
---
If this is true, that is fucking epic man. Do you think it's possible to replicate this feat? 
---
Lol ok so the notification or text message jagex security sends me saying "hey you have 7 days before your account is wiped and we cant help you" wouldnt help at all right
---
Neither of those genres require the same level of dexterity and precision that hybrid PK'ing does, hence why I said go ahead and give yourself a year to reach that same level and i'll give you $1,000. Hybridding is a niche all on its own. If you've watered it down like other brainless players to "it's just clicking lawl!" then I can tell you've never attempted to hybrid a single time. Dexterity- precision, speed, decision making and consistency are required to be a good hybrid PK'er, if you lack that you're simply going to get kills based purely on luck and not the way you've influenced the fight.
---
I don't think you replied to the right person man. 
---
We don’t pk you for your spades. We don’t even loot your bones.  We do it for xp and watching you betas panic to save your spades. 
---
Just do ultimate hcim
---
Hey there me
---
So about two years back I attempted getting a fire cape on a level 3 account. To do this I used some mechanics as well as death-touched darts which instant kill most monsters but won't count towards kill times or give exp. However when I used my first one on a 180, I gained defense experience. Clearly a bug, when I went through support, they claimed that I gained defense experience because I had the def xp option selected while using a ranged weapon so clearly it's not a bug. I had to elevate with a Reddit post and essentially spoil my method which I would've like to do a YouTube video about to get it fixed. And even then when I did it my worn items were taken off or sent to the bank... Including necessary items to complete my fire cape run (though they put the items back in my inventory). Even amongst all of that, a clear bug and a clear incident that was caused by accident fixing and reseting my defense, it was all fixed within a day.
---
 Unless these things are limited to Rs3, Jagex CAN reset stats, they can manipulate inventories, and they can help with a lot of issues they cause. I've always refrained from making a big deal because I am grateful for what Mod Harrison did for me even if I don't play on the account anymore but the lack of customer support is becoming very detrimental to both games. The obvious solution is to create a large customer service team, but I'm not aware of what Jagex's budget is. If anyone from Jagex reads this, I would highly suggest researching your options.

Yea was supposed to be a general thread response but I’m high my bad. 
---
Chill out
---
Ah, I think you are talking about DeviousMUD (name before Runescape) 
---
Part of that is that's there's more pvmers. 
---
Maybe canfis is considered gold farm cause of how often marks drop. 
---
Assumed so as I checked the wiki on Oziach and there was nothing about Cave Horrors or Black Masks there, haha. I got my mask anyway at 306 kills.
---
I'm an absolute chad. 
---
Who has the record of most rules violated in one post?
---
The jagex mods have their accounts flagged for restricted recoveries. We can't set it.
---
All the best man, sorry about you last account.
---
That shit is worthless in real currency. That’s the equivalent of sticking around in robbery to grab a few extra dollars. They probably just wanted the big ticket items and to sell it off before getting booted/locked/banned.
---
Favorite: Death to the Dorgeshuun. Zanek was a cool character and wasn't dumped after a quest or two and dorgesh-kaan was awesome
---
Least favorite: Monkey Madness. I fucking hated going through the maze of undead monkeys to get to that retarded gnome. Like come to me if you have magic dumbass genome.
---
Add an eternal page for tome of fire on med clues
---
Yeah I just kill bots on a pure as I wait for other pures. I like the fights and the fact that pking is the only real risk in the game. 
---
so what about the gay rights topic is particularly political compared to other issues the game deals with overtly? like questlines that have you subverting unjust systems and overthrowing tyrants? sounds like we're already taking all kinds of political stances here, why does it suddenly become an issue when it's about gays or women?
---
nothing beats MM. love getting the chance to do it on a new acc
---
You leave the bones? How will my spirit find rest?

---
Upvoting not because I want posts like this on the subreddit but because players deserve customer support for $11/month
---
What the fuck, where's your subscription to Excl?
---
Woah a different company on a different game had a different way to handle different situations. If you dont like jagex policy don't play the game or if you do just dont enter your info on phishing sites. Seems pretty dumb it is jagexs responsibility to return items when players fail to secure their accounts
---
Yea, Calc 1 was pretty easy for me. I didn’t take it in high school either.
---
high 80s, honestly most of my gp came from flipping or just friends giving me some bc i staked for them (maxed cb)
---
Depends on the professor. Always look professors up before registering. And never take Hanson if you can avoid it.
---
I don’t have to take Diff EQ for comp sci. Thank god.
---
one of the best times i've ever had in this game was when I joined my first PK clan way back in the day and learned the mechanics of pking. Death dot in a random location and lure the rich guys into a fake 1v1. Doesn't have much to do with this post but PVP is an essential part of this game. Some people who only PvE may end up bored one day maxed out and want to PvP. 
---
&gt;"forummod"
---
&gt;doesnt read the post title
---
Well in terms of recovery, that's unfortunately a product of our own invention. With the vast WWW its so easy to look up anything about anyone, and its on you to make sure you keep hidden what you don't want out there. I've heard a case where someone stole a WoW account worth thousands with a very sloppily photoshopped I.D. Photo. In the realm of games, no matter what you add there will always be a way to for someone to steal your account, and there will always be very determined and savvy folks trying. 
---
Its sad that someone can't share a picture of an exciting moment with their community, but that how it be these days. 
---
I’m still a freshman. Yet to drop a class.
---
It’s a runelite plug-in
---
So you might be one of "those" lol where you find 1 and 3 easy but 2 and diff eq hard that was a common trend at my school 
---
haha im well aware thats its not the meta... but its sorta my personal meta as it was incredibly afk and ive done all of it on mobile while at work (with wi-fi turned off, sneak level: 100) because i only need to look at screen once every 100 seconds or so
---
also big grats u/GO_HVM !!
---
Well I can go to work for my 8 hour shift and gain 6 hours of XP auto clicking. Therefore I can use the time I actually have to play to do fun activities that require high stats. 
---
That’s the thought process 
---
Are there gear pieces you already have? Fury, Barrows gloves, Verac's skirt, Archers ring, etc?
---
❤️
---
I read this then I remember how Jed gave out account info and got over 150b in gold hacked. 
---
could you explain some of the problems with the permanent dmm server? i was thinking about trying it out since it seems interesting.
---
Fucking moron
---
Even if you get pked green dragons is steady profit.
---
What a liarrrrr
---
Of course a registered email that is only used for OSRS is the best security. I just think that bank pins are an absolute must have and anyone that doesn’t have one should be prepared for consequences. 
---
The most recent incident with the btw’s Tbow would have been prevented by having a bank pin. He was able to recover his account before the pin could be removed. 
---
Yeah and I said hiding your stats isn't a meme. Not sure if you can read but I'm really confused by you two
---
Please downvote him. Fucking idiot he is. 
---
He dropped the items himself on the red dot leather gloves spawn south of the bank, kappa
---
&gt;had a different way to handle different situations. 
---
It's almost like it's a better more practical way that could be and has already been adapted by several MMOs
---
&gt;If you dont like jagex policy don't play the game or if you do just dont enter your info on phishing sites. 
---
I'm allowed to criticize Jagex 
---
Thought about it. I like the EGR program better at UK.
---
That is not the nature of how this goes down at all
---
If we're talking getting ranger boots on an ironman, this is an entirely different dynamic
---
But for the regular economy, this gives more incentive to do clues in bursts. The way the feel right now is they're not *mandatory*, and the rewards you get from them scale with their scarcity.
---
They're this game's version of a lottery ticket and a small diversion. Stackable clues turn them into something completely different. Similar to how farming runs became more of a migraine the more patches they add- you can absolutely NOT do them and miss out on the exp/ gp income. But it being there in the back of your head creates a sort of "pressure" to do these tasks.
---
By nature clue grinding is annoying, but them coming in at 1 at a time keeps them in the realm of this "short burst" diversion that has a chance for you to luck out on. It feels less "obligatory" in nature.
---
Economy balance aside (you say 100% increase to activity, you're likely to see something more in the realm of ~800% if we're being conservative) there's a psychology to the day to day play of runescape.
---
Think about when Stealing Creations was introduced; it was hands down a community favourite. It meshed well with the themes of Runescape's "genre" (being about a mix of pvp, item economy, community, skilling) and put them into this micro environment minigame. People loved it, but despite it being really fun, people HATED the rewards.
---
I can't recall it perfectly, but I think it's something like clay tools which gave you a % increase to exp earned that degraded over time. So it was more efficient overall to replenish it by doing the minigame now and then while skilling.
---
Doesn't seem too bad on paper, but the psychology of people training boring shit like WC/ Fishing/ Mining was the idea that it's "AFK" in nature. Kick back and do it on a second monitor without too much thought during those sessions you don't feel like doing "juice" content. Get your best in slot training item and go at it.
---
But the Stealing Creation reward created this small pressure of "hey, you're not being efficient"
---
You absolutely could continue playing like normal, but even the knowledge it existed "tainted" the feel a bit.
---
*That* realm of psychology is what changes clues to something much different. Right now tons of people have clues sitting in their bank being neglected, but if there was a max stack instated (even 5) they would feel more inclined to burn through that stack in one go and resume doing their activities. You feel like you're wasting opportunities to get clues if you leave a max stack sitting. You're more inclined to *start* your clue run.
---
That's why I gave you that ridiculous 800% factor. People will actually *start* doing clues more often, in bursts that get 5 (of each tier) done in *one* go. (cause it's easier to commit time to simply doing them with cleared/ teleport centered inventory)
---
More inclination to do them, more burst, less time neglected, people pressured to do them, FASTER process (less time spent swapping between activities/ changing inventories/ finding clue spots in close proximity)
---
Yes but it's pretty unlikely that this was the case here. He's an ironman so I doubt he was looking for gold giveaways, pservers, pk clients, etc. He probably re-used info that was compromised somehow (leak, social engineering, or carelessness). He wouldn't have been a target before the bow since his bank was a few hundred mil at most, so someone probably saw the tbow post and did some quick searching.
---
It sucks, gl on your future in game goals. Hate to see it happen. 
---
Thanks :P. Yeah I've slowed waaay down since my first month of playing..I made huge gains my first month and a half or so, since then though I just don't grind like I used to. I got barrow gloves my first 2 weeks of playing lol. I think it's cause I had goals for myself that when I reached them, now my goals are stuff like 94 mage, and stats that will just take a very long time/a lot of money to do now. So I got a little burnt out I suppose. 
---
I'm tryna decide if I want to get a couple more strength levels first before training attack up again. I probably will actually.
---
I don't pvp one bit but if I'm in the wild I blame myself for any deaths whatsoever.
---
I'm pretty sure their auto recovery system only works for accidentally destroyed/vendored/disenchanted items, not stuff that was traded to other players or put on the auction house
---
You can also get 10% additional bloods from elite dairy
---
Imagine being banned for clicking too much in a game that is all clicking.
---
Oh I agree. My gwd buddy that I do all my bossing with has about the same wealth as assaltwaffle now and he's also probably sand casino'd another 300-500m away so it just seems like waffle is unlucky to me. 
---
Ha gaaaaay
---
I don't understand how someone could hack you by display name only unless they knew your original account name login from the olden days or getting DOX'd through RWT and them knowing the combination of in-game username and email addrsess. Seems like you gotta fuck up pretty heavily or get some form of Mod Jed-style hacking on your account. 
---
Nah but I will need it eventually and this is just the right motivation 
---
Join KOD CC. we pk and pvm all the time and are very helpful. We host events too.
---
Honestly, stuff like this is the reason I quit recently. The quality of support Jagex provides compared to almost any other multiplayer game is pathetic. I flashback to wow support when the person you were talking to likely also played the game, which allowed them to understand your frustration and work better to help you. This coupled with a couple other big things like not adding an authenticator delay made playing the game seem even more pointless than it already is. Just remember, you don't own your account, jagex does. That already puts you in an interesting relationship as a consumer.

[deleted]
---
good point, and it’s funny you mention void since i’ve always preferred how it looks on guys. it looks more like a comfy sweater
---
favorite is DS2: the lore is great, genuinely had fun doing it, the music is amazing and it ends an iconic questline (of the guilds) with a bang. 
---
least fav is MEP2 because both times i brought way too many ppots initially so i had to juggle ppots with the mirrors and shit. NOT fun 
---
I don't think it's too hard? Just go into your bank personally and explain them the problem politely, that's what I did.
---
Just saying the system jagex has works perfect. I would much rather they keep this system rather than flood the market with 100 tbows a day due to fake hacks.
---
Even Blizzard games are like that and they have a multimillion dollar support department. The whole customer support industry needs an overhaul with regards to games, clearly just hiring more people doesn't fix anything 
---
i dont understand this stuff, i've been playing for 15 years and none of my accounts made by me have been hacked? my passwords are complete random f34r74j89983f BUT all are original login names, no email.
---
i think whats happening is either RWT(thanks for business) or people are really that dumb they fall for password scams from links etc.
---
I think your use of a question mark and no /s confused them?
---
“Sit retard”
---
osbot is not runelite, just so you know
---
&gt; Just saying the system jagex has works perfect.
---
What system? That's my whole point other than posting on Reddit, Twitter and praying for upvotes Jagex has no system
---
I've already given it and you just say "nu-uh!" Play the game how you want to play it. People averaging 1-2 more clues an hour isn't going to make a dramatic difference. There will be a price drop, but it won't be big. Rangers really shouldn't be 30m anyways imo, so them dropping back down to 27ish is fine with me.
---
My comment earlier still stands, you beast

---
No the system of not returning items.

Missing snakeskin hat too
---
I just did Eagle's Peak for the first time since it released in 2006 and had a blast. As soon as I walked into the campsite with the ferrets, I decided to take my time with the quest, completely ignore the wiki or any other guides (besides the in-game guide), and figure everything out on my own.
---
I'm going to start doing more quests this way. I read through all the dialog, solved the puzzle with the eagle statues/bird feeders, and felt genuinely accomplished when I figured everything out. 
---
It was cool. I realized that I've skipped through so many unique in-game experiences by following the quick guides on the wiki and holding the space bar through all the dialog. Also, I love the stupid, witty humor that Jagex puts into their storylines. 
---
How I know I will never ever be hacked unless there's a huge database leak from Jagex. No one else knows my login username. Chances of being hacked without being very irresponsible are astronomically low. Then I have 2fa and a pin, just in case.
---
Apparently he got hacked for his bank after he posted this. Ooooof
---
Interesting that you choose to use the same name for your reddit account as your [OSBot account.](https://i.imgur.com/HFCrmH3.png) Enjoy the ban, hopefully you won't cheat next time.
---
I'd assume bot scripts code a random delay interval to throw off tracking like that, I would
---
Am I misunderstanding how placeholders work or something?
---
I'm trying to organize my bank, and I right click the item and press placeholder. It'll display the greyed out item with 0 beside it, until I close my bank, and then it's gone. I can deposit it again, but if I try and withdraw it, the placeholder thing doesn't stay.
---
What gives?
---
That's kind of a shitty thing to do, you're essentially stealing. It's one thing to cancel your subscription and maybe chargeback the last month, but it's just downright dishonest to chargeback for time that you were actively playing the game
---
Thank you!
---
Had the above 3 when I got hacked a while back, guy didn't have my phone number, pc didn't have a keylogger and it wasn't Mod Jed. For whatever reason, my 2FA on email didn't trigger (Obviously not Jagex's fault) and they got into my email anyway. I've yet to figure out how they did it, especially because they were the most brainlet hacker and didn't steal the 50m I had equipped, but instead triggered my bank pin to be deleted and then left the account alone, which I took back long before they ever got in to the bank. 
---
Least favorite is One small favor, the world's biggest fetch quest.
---
There is a website that will check if your email or password has been compromised. It compares your info against known hacks. Of course this is a good way for the guy to get your info so dont post cirrent passwords. https://haveibeenpwned.com/
---
What do you mean when you say you suicided? I've never heard anyone say suicide botting until a couple times in this thread 
---
Not sure why they deleted this but it was good thanks for the recommendation lel
---
Osbot =/= runelite
---
That's not a system that's just inaction. 
---
Can we talk about how were making a joke of a fucked up situation that's ought to make the history books?
---
When they turned rs2 into rs3, rs2 died to me.
---
I would prefer if the actual ancestral set was recolored to something more neutral, rather than be shoehorned into the 3 gods aesthetic thing. The current one does look pretty saradominist, so just make it not be and then don't do recolored kits.
---
We're British you swine!
---
Good to hear about DS2. That one has been on my to-do list for awhile and I feel similarly about bossing.
---
to be fair that was a bit of an exception and most of the wealth he stole was from banned accounts.
---
Favorite is DS2, its the only quest i actually enjoyed doing. Least favourite is MM2 thanks to the dock. Mep2 and ratcatchers werent too bad with a video guide. 
---
Its good too set goals but dont grind too hard otherwise you will get burnt out, Same thing happened too me at wintertodl lol. It would be ideal too train strength up because it will increase your max hit, making it easier too train other combat stats. 
---
Man I laughed maniacally because of that OC that was posted a few days ago
---
My go to is using the guide but also reading all the dialogue. I find that I can do quests semi-efficiently that way but still enjoy the story.

Holy moly

Grats
---
stealing creation was still being played pvp style last time I logged into rs3 when they had the twitch promo. little known fact because it only happens on spotlight. It's actually the only decent pvp aspect that game still has.
---
not only the tbow, but also all the other items and gold on their account.
---
You didn't even set a bank pin lol no sympathy from me sorry
---
The COD analogy is bad because they are actively fighting against you and your team. You killing them is not to waste their time, it's to win the game, get kills, or get killstreaks. You literally gain nothing from the clue scrollers except in rare scenarios, and if you really cared about the gp from those rare scenarios you'd do a gp/hr activity. The reality is you are absolutely doing it because of enjoy wasting their time, and that makes you an asshole. I don't really care if you wanna be an asshole and it's up to you if you should or shouldn't, but you should at least own up when you're being an asshole. If you enjoy that you should happily say "I enjoy being an asshole".

Lmao wow this is impressive

I'm sure people have raged over less, also he wasn't naked.

Exactly, hence why no one says "watching my screen".

It is

Also at 1.8k. 7/11. No pet, no jar, no dragon thrownaxes or dragon knives. 
---
Haha that is an idea though, would be so bad for the legs xD. Really appreciate it man!
---
Try bounty hunter world wildy above edgeville , or rev caves :)))
---
Gay
---
The problem is not that it's a not a safe death. The problem is you have people who are being baited out to pick on people who have no intention of fighting back and apparently that's wilderness rejuv.
---
The idea that high gp per hour pvm spots is the only way to rejuvenate the wilderness is degenerate. 
---
Dont broadcast your account name... probably have super easy recovery questions/email/account
---
But now fam, they’re in! I fuckin died
---
There are many ways to implement account recovery without exposing user to the identity theft attack.

Just how I like it at night

What is this software?

Regardless of any methologies in place, unit and feature testing will never cover everything.

2.5m-3m with rune cbow???

Wow, I don’t even get that with bgs blowpipe. I must’ve be doing something wrong. 
---
Mfw this account gets hacked and they suicide your HC
---
you limited yourself then you get locked out of content.
---
You only use a granite maul in NMZ when you get the special attack boost. The rest of the time you would still use your dragon sword/scimitar, or better yet, full obsidian.
---
Either you are lying about having all the security measures or you have a virus since your pin was either never actually there or the hacker somehow knew it.
---
Easy there tiger 
---
I'm so glad those of us who have been pushing for the golden spade have finally gotten it
---
He should just try to sell the account for all it's worth at this point. I'd just walk away
---
Got beaver. LATER VIRGINS

Ah, I see that now. It came off as a suggestion to me for some reason.

Yeah 50 seconds for the extra 20m definitely isn’t worth the hackers time.

Jagex doesn't need many reasons to not do extra work. Passwords still aren't case sensitive either

I don't know how people don't understand 1:1 input/output.

What you are suggesting is 100% against the rules. It's not rocket science. 
---
If I see a post on here in 2 months with you getting a macro ban and you're blasting Jagex for it, I'll remember. 
---
IVe tried this and no luck. Ive cleared cache and still doesnt work.
---
Contracts are broken lol, it’s not hard to very quickly build up a herb tab again. As for food, buying potatoes with cheese or fishing/cooking karambwans is fast af.

Get mith gloves and climbing boots too
---
Nice.
---
He needed to black out all of the other information, otherwise we could steal his account. Unfortunate, but the account recovery system forces us to go this far. 
---
Or if your computer gets a RAT, then the ONLY thing that can realistically protect you is an auth delay. Leme tell you from personal experience.
---
Why not just have a tbow spawn and then reroll the server once everyone finds out. Oh wait that joke would probably be old it's been done before. 
---
oh no youre retarded
---
In security, we happily relinquish things like convenience in exchange for greater security.  It’s an absolute no-brainer. 
---
With how often they trigger, it could get a bit spammy. You already get a warning before they break so alerting every use may be a bit much. Maybe with a toggle...
---
You had 2fa on account + email BEFORE hack or after?
---
once again, illiterate reply and you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Why are you even here?
---
Yeah I just use hunter2, easy to remember.

Didn't censor name gg acc
---
That's sexist, where's international men's day??
---
Good job, sir. 
---
I torrent semi-frequently so there's a huge reason, &amp; yes you really should.
---
Right so the thing about getting hacked is that it is virtually always your own fault if it happens lol. If you have a 2fa secured email with a unique password that you only use for runescape, don't share your account, don't get phished, don't download a rat, and don't go around publishing all your information that could be used for recovery, you're not gonna get hacked. 
---
This sub is great at fearmongering and blaming jagex but not so good at personal responsibility. 
---
so you either hate this game and quit after a couple weeks or love this game through all its bullshit and next thing you know 10 years of your life have gone by and you’ll think to yourself “why tf am i still playing?” and stop thinking about it while you go back to playing. Eventually you will stop playing for an extended amount of time, however, you will find yourself back playing runescape as it holds you on a leash making you think youre free to leave the game but youre not, you are in prisoned by runescapes eternal grasps.
---
i'd be super dissapointed too if i threw my account away on some shitty bot software
---
Or just trade out the barrows gloves for blessed d hide gloves. -1 range attack for +1 prayer
---
Yeah, this is getting way out of hand, jagex really needs to do something about this.
---
‘Investors’ that would happen to be yourself and everyone that pays to play the game. The only pockets it’s lining are jagex employees. 
---
This is almost certainly going to create turmoil but I have to say it. Personally, I'm pretty flabbergasted at the community's reaction to this right now. Specifically, it's the fact that people are giving him shit for not having a bank pin, posting on reddit, not taking other precautions etc. As opposed to trying to offer a solution to help fix this, retroactively.
---
This is regardless of the fact that:
---
a) 99.9% chance Jagex won't be doing anything about it
---
b) He clearly messed up on a lot of things such as lazying out without a bank PIN, posting on reddit certain info, probably accidentally leaking information somewhere down the line as well
---
I mean, seriously, all that when said and done, just literally put yourself in this guy's shoes for just 10 seconds, and imagine everything to date is lost in terms of wealth (no alts, no nothing). This guy was an iron man too.
---
Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel really bad for this guy in spite of everything he did wrong. For those that are active on this sub, I would imagine we've all put considerable hours building our wealth in this game - having it lost altogether is so shitty, just so goddam shitty.
---
I just hope we can be supportive without commenting things he could have done in hindsight and at least TRY to help this guy in his current situation now.
---
They used a RAT this whole time and are just waiting for OP to get another bow. 
---
I wonder how this will affect Gnome Scarf prices, now that there are colored variants. Probably a decrease as demand drops, but not much since the market isn't getting flooded with exactly identical items.

&gt; 
---
&gt; I know personally, If I had an option for I.D. linked to my account. I probably wouldn't do it.
---
Why not? Wouldn't you want to lower your chances of getting recovered?
---
I agree people are probably pretty safe if they take proper precautions but there's still too many people getting recovered.
---
I do feel bad for the fact that this guy lost hundreds and hundreds of hours of progress on his account, but he needs to learn from his mistakes. I had a friend of mine who got hacked from streaming and not being mindful of what he streamed, leaking his pin, and user (old enough account to not have to enter email), and even password length. 
---
Did I feel bad for him? Of course, he’s my friend. 
---
Did he feel bad for himself? Not at all, he knew exactly what he did wrong.

Hey, Mod Owen here.

Try talking him down and asking him politely to get off the account. Sadly, there is nothing we can do at this point as the account is already compromised. Recover the email and change passwords.

No disrespect like keep it up I hope you enjoy making these, but I had to get on here and say that to me these comics are sheer unadulterated dogshit. They’re not funny, the drawing sucks, the premises are barely relatable.
---
Constructive criticism would be make less. Find a genuinely funny observation and make a comic then, ditch whatever schedule you’ve set that is pumping out this mediocre content. Maybe work on the drawing in the meantime. Lmao barrows questions are hard sometimes isn’t worth a cartoon. You have more space, you should be exploring more nuanced concepts than a meme can, so don’t copy them.
---
Sorry

You use what as your password? All I see is *******

Big oof

I keep my chat off while pking because literally all that happens 90% of the time is people throw insults, wouldn't be surprised if he did the same lol

most of the pures i see have to raid with mega bad people who would be fine with downscaled raids/be fine doing like&gt;5mans.
---
now it doesn't really matter much which is nice but beforehand itd gimp the points real badly.

You're first sentence is utterly pointless. As a designer myself, your entire message is disrespectful and useless. I hope it makes you happy degrading other people's art because it seems like nothing else does. 
---
Favorite: Any quest that I've already completed.
---
Least favorite: Any quest that I still have to do.
---
Jokes aside, the lunar quests are some of my favorite story wise despite some of their annoyances. (Memorization hopping stones!)
---
Bound to rise though
---
This is such a shitty nonconstructive comment... 
---
"No disrespect..." Yet you un-ironically type within the same stroke of your throbbing fingertips "they're not funny, the drawing sucks... make less." 
---
Also nice job on totally missing the joke... The joke isn't "Barrows questions are hard sometimes" The reliability is that the monsters constantly interrupt you.
---
If you truly wanted to say something constructive you would specify what in particular needs practiced instead of saying they're trash and leaving everyone confused.
---
nope
---
you can use that info to submit a recovery request, and if you have enough correct info you can submit a successful appeal
---
a successful appeal disables the current email, disables authenticator, and sets the e-mail to the email you set on the form
---
thus, you can gain full access without every touching 2fa/auth/email if the victim unfortunately has info on a DB leak (happens all the time, even to people with 2fa on email / rs acc).
---
i've made plenty of comments lately saying that people get targeted &amp; recovered if they're rich / high-level, and this just seems to be  another unfortunate case of this happening.
---
I do have a blowpipe

Wily cat’s hit 2’s and can kill behemoths pretty fast. I don’t think we need stronger cats than this.

Favorite Quest: Lunar Diplomacy. Little to no combat as well as fetching. Loved going to the dream world. Exploring a new area. Diplomatic part as well as the dream section has close ties to real life.
---
Least favorite: One Small Favour. Constant running around with the NPC’s trolling you. Felt like an entire waste of time.
---
Have not done DS2 yet because I’m going for 99 slayer untrimmed. How fun is the quest on a scale of 1-10?
---
Side related, is there a way to increase? 
---
This is common knowledge for anyone who singles pk. Go attack anyone doing callisto and holy shit the amount of flame you get is fucked. Worst part is, they don't even know how to flame. 
---
Favorite has to be Morning's End Part 2(Not meming and  im not a masochist). All of the elven quest line tbh.
---
I just like the intrigue and "dark fantasy" aspect of it. 
---
Least favorite is Ernest the chicken, dont ask me why but this quest is more of a chore to me than One small favour. 
---
Maybe it's because when i was a kid i only played F2P and this quest was one of the least worth doing of them.
---
What about bossing in general? Will I notice a significant difference (let's say with zulrah for example), or will all remain the same?

Is that language Finnish or Estonian?

haha 75 :D
---
They're cool designs and all but if you think flat vectored 2 dimensional images will fit into osrs I can't help you. 
---
Yes! I'm so excited for Song of the Elves
---
bad day?
---
Because if someone can remove the authenticator from your account then they have access to your email and can just simply delete the confirmation email so you wouldn't even know it was removed. Just secure your email and it wouldn't even matter. 
---
arent we all?
---
Had they not rolled back he’d have the bottom. If he had the bottom the raid would have gone diffently and the initial seed value of Java’s random calculator would have been different and the tbow might not have dropped. 
---
Really? Like are you fucking kidding me.
---
I still don’t believe it. 
---
Exactly why I cheat this game. No point being genuine 
---
Holy shit hes one of us
---
Level 94 is half way :)
---
On my HCIM I've used chaos altar for early overhead prayers, and crazed arch for rune c'bow. Even went to rogue's chests for dragonstones, done a few wilderness clue steps and plan to do Mage Arena in future. The wilderness isn't as off limits if you play it smart, be aware and choose your time of day correctly.
---
Play longer than a week and possibly become a member. 
---
You can't click on their name and find hundreds of comments with relevant information pertaining to their account when you see them at the GE
---
Exactly.  That’s why I said RuneScape is basically a text based game with graphics.  It’s not so obvious now maybe, but it was with 2D scape.
---
Iirc about 1/16k
---
God damn it, Frank. Eating your booze? That is genius!
---
So you expect them to list every single topic they are not willing or able to discuss instead of just avoiding the questions?
---
Also, your comment here and there don't ask the same thing. You claimed you asked "what she finds to be the biggest hurdles in her role", which is a more personal question she might have been able to answer. But what you actually asked there was "what are the major hurdles in your way currently (for support revamps)".
---
If Jagex had any updates to share on a Support revamp, an AMA is not the place to unveil them and any answer she'd be able to give is one we'd already been told in the past. But on the spot she probably wouldn't know what has been previously said so rather than saying too much and getting in trouble, she ignored the question.
---
Of course he felt bad for himself. This is not an argument. If we feel bad, then we should act as such.
---
As a side note, I don't believe that you would expect to behave the way you're behaving if you're in the same situation. I don't think anyone would, considering he likely spent at least 1-2 years on this account, maybe more.
---
As a further side note, although it would be a lot of work, this kind of stuff needs to be handled better. There should be direct mod intervention to retrieve his items, regardless of how much of a process it is or what precedent it's setting. This is really, really sad.
---
Gr8 anim8 m8 I r8 8/8
---
if you really care about speed runs, efficiency? yeah. if you don't, then no. 
---
you can play around w/ dps calc but in general most dmg in osrs is avoidable -&gt; all you really miss out on is rigour,piety. which is a decent amount of max hits. And 1-2 from not having tasset/prim/avernic/fero.
---
the biggest issue (at least for me) is that any build that is below 115 combat can't really solo raid. 22-24k pts from a good raid vs 31-35k is kinda a big middle finger from jagex.
---
hardcores would be more scared
---
what about one small favour
---
Because the answer is the always the obvious "don't give away information that will allow other people to recover your account" but for literally years that's been the answer and retards far and wide have insisted that it isn't good enough for some reason. Wtf is he supposed to say lmao
---
Not if my neck beard has anything to say about this 
---
I once dreamt that I was actually good at the game...
---
Blizzard support is nothing like this lol. It’s so easy to get in touch with a human who has the ability to fix things.
---
tbh, it has nothing to do with "flawed account security" in the most place, lol
---
these creatures will scout a victim, then search their reddit / other social media for specific info such as ISP, location, etc
---
then, they'll use info from DB leaks (info can be from legit like 2008 or earlier) to eventually submit a successful appeal.
---
pretty confused on how all reddit kids think "hahaha u had bad security in 2008 u deserved to be hacked!! haha you're retarded my dude get 2fa on email :D", when most high-level/rich players have auth + 2fa on their email/accounts lol.
---
recovery system is broken, yet no1 will believe this until it happens to them.
---
(never got hacked myself, but used to be associated with related stuff).
---
1.3mil xp/h??? 
---
LMAO and you using a fishing cape with addie boots.  2 peas of a pod right here. 
---
I didn't have it on my account, only on my email.
---
I’m fucking runewdpane dawg
---
The best money makers in free to play are telegrabbing wines or nature tunes. You can also do various store bought flipping methods. For Skilling, mining gold in the crafting guild or cutting yews in edgeville. But it's all chump change compared to members
---
Lmao yeah this would have been a great change back when people still actually played on that server. At least it finally happened, maybe with some streamer attention some life can be brought back to it now
---
Im doing Rag and Bone Man II right now, its my 3rd last quest before quest cape. God damn that quest is a bad design.
---
Imagine enabling 2FA for an online game but not for your email lol
---
Yeah, I have. Buy bonds
---
Yeah that's pretty bad. 
---
thats the full reply 
---
You just need a unique email ***and password*** on your Runescape account.
---
Maybe a good middle ground would be to fund the position through the support claims and get a 3rd party. Basically have some contractors who are paid by the case to solve these support issues. The pay would come from a $5 fee to elevate a ticket for support. Basically of your ticket goes no where you can pay $5 to get it more attention. 
---
+4 strength is very often a max hit, [but not always](https://i.imgur.com/lsY0Jbj.png).
---
Point is they recovered. We don’t need bots for our economy. 
---
The best thing about this whole mess is that Jmods will dickride popular memes or Streamers to the ends of the earth (example, the 73 hitsplat keychain) but some poor dude that tries to get his legitimately earned items back gets pushed aside because it's not popular enough.
---
This goes beyond just customer support as well. Polls being not hidden is baffling, The fact that they continually make egregious decisions every month causing massive drama &amp; Backlash in the community
---
Let's also not forget that whilst things like the PVP championship had players flown to the UK and sat in nice hotel rooms, We have competition winners from over a year ago(fact check me if wrong) That STILL haven't received any of their rewards.
---
I love this game and the community but asides from rarely seen small actions of overwhelming support from the Jmod team, They're one of the most incompetent Video gaming company that's currently active right now.
---
Jagex, You're currently responsible for the most successful Mmorpg Liscense in the entire world.
---
And you act like absolute fuckwits. 
---
This is exactly why they should stick to the fuck everyone policy. Do it for someone and everyone expects it to be done. Don’t return items and don’t reset stats. 
---
it would really depend how its set up. I've been in a situation where I wanted to buy a widely available product, one place was a bit cheaper but they needed proof that I owned the card (long story). Another place would just let me order without having to go through that extra step, and I opted for paying a tad more without having to verify my Identity. 
---
Plus I just have faith in the current security coupled with my online practices that I just wouldn't need it.
---
Why would they need to bypass your email 2FA? Have you actually tried the recovery process before? If you input personal info to recover the account then you don't need access to the primary email, period. Go try it. 
---
I know right, it's an awful quest. Imo, the *only* awful quest.
---
Wrong, you dont know enough to share your opinion. 
---
I said give a list of topics they’re willing to discuss. Did you even read or are you just wanting to be angry for the sake of being angry...?
---
Don’t forget the power ammy

Now I'm glad I didn't post this

Most favorite: A Taste of Hope. I ended getting super invested in the fights! (I'm sure DS2 will be my fave once I do it though)
---
Least favorite: Ratcatchers. Hoo boy did I absolutely loathe the stealth section. My cat grew fat on the VERY LAST rat of the quest! :/
---
gross. 
---
And I was just memeing.
---
I cant think of any other game where you actively have to hide your wealth to not get hacked. Unreal. And really unlucky for that ironman.
---
THIS IS WHY WE NEED AUTH DELAY JAMFLEX!!!
---
Did you report him for real life threats? Because those are escalated quickly. 
---
Okay man I give, you win, he killed himself and we are all to blame. I clearly can't change your mind.
---
An ask me anything thread seems the perfect place to place that sort of question. Especially such an upvoted one. Even if she couldn't reaveal much about anything. Just because she couldn't give OP an answer they wanted doesn't mean one shouldn't have been given.

*OwO, what's this? * It's your **2nd Cakeday** Dasein___! ^(hug)
---
My friend got recovered he had everything you listed and his only weakness was recovery. 
---
Someone recovered his ACTIVE account INSTANTLY (he was online earlier that day and plays daily) jagex should not allow this why would someone who plays actively and was online earlier that day suddenly forget all their log in info and current email address info? (Unless they recently received brain damage) 
---
They recovered his account with very basic info.
---
If they implemented a recovery delay this would give the owner a chance to dispute the recovery, preventing the account from falling into the wrong hands also security questions (that only you know the answers too) are a very good security tool for recovery and it baffles me why the removed them?! 
---
There is literally no cons to this only benefits and accounts would be much safer.
---
It's insanely easy if you have any amount of sleuthing skills. Like frankly it might be worth just getting a ton of people to start doing it to everyone so Jagex finally fixes the problem.
---
All these "authenticator delay" memes aren't really helping either. People just don't understand the actual issue and meme about it anyways
---
Unrestricted worlds are a thing yall. 
---
Stats=my stats
---
Gear=my gear 
---
Ok I'd like 10000 zul Andra tps please. 
---
I believe if you can recover the account it’ll boot him off
---
Appreciate, thanks friends. 
---
Boner garage 
---
This is way  more dope 
---
Pretty sure you don't need to be on a specific world for it, that's just how you find other players to play with. Unless they changed it and restricted it like LMS?
---
What's a good way to make money on my ironman at low to mid level stats? I'm trying to buy rune armor. All of my stats are level 20-55. 
---
All of the low level guides I see will say things like get level 70 this or get level 99 that before doing anything else or complete this extremely hard quest that requires 10 other quests and decent armor. 
---
Clues will still have the same drop rate as before, and if multiple clues becomes a thing, they'll get a diminishing drop rate like ecumenical keys, which could actually decrease the rate that clues drop, on average. Also, there's nothing wrong with the price of some items changing based on this update, the only players that will be negatively affected are those that hoard clue scroll uniques.
---
For absolute security you would need 2fa on the secondary recovery email for your primary email. 
---
You can drop trade away from an ironman account.
---
I never understood why people on this subreddit are always oblivious to even the most simple joke

Main thing is the cost of your time spent doing that rather than something else. As a maxed combat main you could easily make enough money bossing or doing raids to make it a better method.
---
Have you not seen the god capes? These designs are supposed to fit those themes hence the blue and green for guthix... Mod West (I believe it is) has his own designs for the god coloured ancestral and his guthix idea is a green and browny theme rather than the classic green and blue we all know from the god capes
---
this aint it chief
---
Everyone knows you need to censor your run energy to keep your account secure, duh!
---
Yeah its cool. I turned off that setting though since I didn't want hundreds of them over worthless levels early on lol
---
Just 2 dude having sex theres nothing gay about that bro
---
Okay so you could one train hunter up real quick and catch chins.   You could get mort myre fungus with a few quest unlocks. 
---
It ain't rocket science my guy
---
customer support for this game is sooo awful.
---
It would take a lot of time and effort to create a system that can track all that stuff though. Imagine all the fake requests they would get on a daily basis. 
---
He’s an iron man, they can’t trade the bow away in the first place.
---
Is it possible to change my email from my current on the account to a more secure 2FA email, or are you lumped with the one you started with?
---
I'll chime in here since i used to be apart of this scene back in 2010ish. When you hack these accounts you usually use scripts to export the items to a middle man account which then trades to a mule or sale account. This process would take too long to do by hand so its not uncommon to see someone with 20-40 scripts running. These login with suspected passwords and take anything within a set thresh hold. Untradebles are likely not detected here. The profits are not from a few big hacks but rather effiecently breaking into a bunch of accounts at once. Ironman btw.
---
you know I should really give that a try
---
Looking at traded volumes, you're looking at a less than 1 sold per day on most unenchanted zenytes, at almost an exact cost of the item being enchanted into. Kind of a money making method, but you've got to get lucky and even then it's extremely limited.
---
Authenticator is useless and can be disabled instantly with no delay. Once they have your account info it’s over. 
---
And if they recover you, you are shit out of luck.
---
Any quest with some of that oldschool stupid humor, like my arm's big adventure.
---
Mod Ed is actually incredible at making quests too, I like all of the ones he's released.
---
I don't have a particular quest I hate but I couldn't stand the platform in MM2
---
Can you boss completely afk though? 
---
**2FA YOUR FUCKING EMAILS JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE**
---
Nice bakuretsu!
---
You cannot set secondary emails on osrs accounts.
---
Of course. I doubt any data set is comprehensive.
---
Not hiding screen name still, not that it even matters at this point. Not having a bank pin set. You probably RWTed it and are farming for reddit karma. I wouldn't doubt it a JMod looks into this and bans you.
---
the smaller items are harder for OP to RWT off lmao
---
There’s no such thing as being hacked. The only way you get hijacked is by being low iq and leaking your information by following shady links and getting loggers and rats from downloading stupid stuff from more shady links.
---
So many accounts had 6h guthans at nmz. Idk. Out of all the things to bot idgaf about nmz. At least it shows they plan on actually playing. Where real bots just flood the game with resources. 
---
This the type of dude who buys bonds for GP too.
---
I would leave well enough alone.
---
DS2 is so good. Every other quest in the game felt tedious and like a task. But I just had so much fun with DS2 that even though it's one of the longest quests it felt quicker than most medium quests.
---
You can set core affinity regardless of how many cores you have. 
---
Go have a look yourself, you can choose which cores it runes on
---
Just came to see if I could yoink a dragon axe, ended up hitting the ring table 3x in a row.  First dragon axe was on 3 kc!!  My combat stats are all sub 70 so this was really exciting after using most of my food just to get in the safespot.

Bank pin is basically the only real secure thing on your account if your items are banked. Apart from a rat or you literally telling someone your pin, they will have to wait the 3 or 7 days to get it and you should ideally be able to get your account back by then.
---
Can you rc completely afk?
---
Hahahaha you’re so right, he already compromised his account name and creation date in one post

I’ve had many accounts. None of which have ever been compromised.

Just more risk of the account being hacked if the hacker can figure out a way to get into the manager which I’ve heard is possible. The only place I trust having a password is on a piece of paper or in my head.

Gg, you got that tbow way too early anyway :D. Next time set a bank pin and an authenticator.

What opinion? That lgbt people should have the same rights as anyone else? If that’s the opinion your talking about, then they can suck it up or fuck off.

As a person with a career in testing for the last 7 years your statement scares me. Agile methodology does not mean no more dedicated testing is required. Developer testing should always just be the first step followed by a test plan from a dedicated QA team (in any big/serious project). And a dedicated QA team does not mean junior developers that are put on testing for a bit before they start developping as it appears to be at Jagex. QA is a genuine career path even though most developpers don't like to see it that way or want to admit it. But if testing was that easy, we wouldn't be finding release blocking defects missed by the developers ..
---
I agree that QA seems to be a joke at times at jagex, but that's not the fault of any jmod but because of  management that refuses to spend budget on QA because these are often non-technical people that have your point of view and feel that a developer doing a quick look around is plenty sufficient.
---
No i'm dead serious, but i'm confident because I know you, nor anyone on this sub ever will. There's a reason why there are probably less than 10 people in the game at that level, and why i'll be keeping my $1,000.
---
His channel is surprisingly big.

I mean it was an AMA centred around international women's day so I wouldn't be surprised if it's not answered.

This guy is too woke for our conspiracy theories 😩
---
Thought this was so cruel at first haha
---
I hated doing them all tbh. DS2 was okay, but I really wish there weren't quests in the game. 
---
CoX is on the lower end of endgame
---
Wow!!
---
I'm currently working through rfd and it takes a while to get the QP and requirements but they're not too bad. Quests are quick for the most part but just a lot of them. I'd use a cb bracelet for now.
---
Jagex has grown too big for their britches, i hope it's not malicious or anything, and is merely a lack of staff to reply.......buuuuuut, the conspiracy nut in me is saying it's all some master plan to give us autism :( 
---
Crashing any type of account is a dick move, though.
---
I meant more like my goal. Not actually endgame. My bad
---
Rag and Bone man is the stupidest quest and as to why that shit got a sequel is beyond me.
---
I didn’t know that, interesting
---
I have like 11 CPU enabled which on I disable? 
---
Yeah honestly. You can go with full void, bgs, whip, trident, bp, d pickaxe, salve. Learn the mechanics from there and you’re good 
---
I don't like the idea of silly cosmetic bloat that doesn't fit the context of the game. It's one of the reasons that I don't play the original game.
---
Oh absolutely! Couldn’t agree with you more dude.
---
&gt;Authenticator can be disabled instantly with no delay. Once they have your account info it’s over. 
---
No, they need access to your email to disable authenticator. It is true that the email is sent immediately, but unless you can access the email then it doesn't matter when they send it. The truth is that even if someone hands you their username and password, you can't get in if they have auth and a secure email.
---
thought that was a legitimate link...sadly its not :'(
---
Lol customer service.
---
I bet you were one of the retard edgelords that cried on the forums when your account got a 3 day ban. 
---
How did anyone lose $11?
---
Favorite is easily Underground Pass, very intuitive objectives, a functional and lore-rich area with its own inhabitants and adventurers that feels alive without the intervention of the player. Nearly everything you need for the quest is inside the area too so it's very self-contained.
---
Least favorite is MM2, feels like it drags on too long at some points, bad boss fights (although it was a different time compared to A Taste of Hope and DS2 I guess), very annoying puzzle maze that brought back flashbacks of Ratcatchers.
---
True, people can disagree, but that doesn’t make their opinion right, nor does it make them free from criticism or scorn. 
---
Like with your ice cream example, you can be unsatisfied for have your order messed up, but I can call you out for being spoiled because you got the 8 vanilla and an extra scoop for free.
---
Similarly, people can say they dislike lgbt but that doesn’t mean they are immune from backlash. If someone were to say “Straight White Males should not do x, y, and z,” people should call them out on their bigotry.
---
you spelled wrong write :)
---
EXPUROSHUUUUUN!
---
I saw set affinity I have like 11 CPU enabled, I need to disable some? 
---
That's mine now
---
combat brace btw
---
How hard would it be to implement a photo ID linked to the account? WoW does it and seems to work fine. 
---
Given that OP was hacked once, i would say that a significant amount of other information is out there
---
Holy fuck *you're* bad at this
---
it's harder than you think to avoid being socially engineered when you post on social media a lot.
---
this just confirms how broken jagexs system is 
---
Not worth the effort
---
You posted to a reddit page that has 320k people in it that you just got 1b, with the account name exposed what did you think might happen? It's the equivalent of walking out of the bank with your wallet in hand putting dozens of hundred dollar bills into it for the world to see and then wondering why you got mugged. Now when you see the "forgot to blank out your 50 fming, hacked" memes on here you get why now. It'a a shame that happened but putting that information out there is risky.

De-ironing an acc ruins it more than losing 2bil, nobody wants to just have yet another main acc 
---
got 96 yesterday and been tracking the herbiboars today
---
I think the problem is in the root. People are able to recover accounts because of scraps of informations in internet(reddit account -&gt; little googling -&gt; getting access to email/sending fake jagex email to reset password) Some people are dumb posting emails/using everywhere the same password/not using 2FA but it still looks like something is off with recovery system. 
---
Another problem is "no refund policy" or whatever is it called. It's sketchy topic in many games/platforms. In wow after hack you get your items back but whole game isn't dependant on economy/items/gold. On steam people abused system by "hacking" accounts and writing tickets to support. You could double skins that way. Here jagex go out of their way to help streamers but if you are normal player your best bet is getting attention on reddit. I would understand if it was "small indie company" but it isn't, wow isn't much more expensive and got much better player support(but they lack in other aspects) It's even worse when you think that jagex can fail with something(tbow spawn) rollback server and you lose hunded of hours of grind(hello ironmans doing GWD)
---
My favourite is Lunar diplomacy Etheral man part

My least favourite is Lunar Diplomacy talking to pirates (really shit dialogue)

If they recover they bypass all of that

---
I wasn't talking about OP. I was talking in general, people like to say "Op you gave away your creation date, gg account"
---
People can give away their creation date all day and it will have practically no impact on their likeliness of being hacked. Judging from the downvotes on my original comment though, I guess I'm in the minority opinion!
---
Correct, but recovery is a different problem entirely and nobody alive can stop you from giving away all your information willingly. 
---
Yes, you can change the email that is linked to your account, which is the one where Jagex will send you stuff and that you can use to disable the authenticator. However the email you use to login is unchangeable, but this doesn't matter as it is just used as your login credentials.

Pfff RC and mining only skills holding

 I would spend hours cleaning it for free!

He lost his items due to a rollback by Jagex. They cause him to lose items, it wasn’t his fault. And yeah, it is a game. But it’s a game you have to spend $11 a month on to progress, and by taking away his progress, they essentially took his time and money because he has to do it all over again. Do you really not get this?

I am

No? I thought the idea was to make a really strong password so you never need to change it. Lol no shit I change ALL passwords to my ALL accounts/emails monthly. Still doesn't give me peace of mind with whaylt has been happening lately

Hunter is the most creative and fleshed out skill in the game in my eyes. I am not the biggest fan of training it but there is seriously a ton of variety. there are passive afk methods to medium click intensity to high apm methods. It also provides a decent gp/hr method at higher levels that is exclusive to Hunter.
---
My bad I misremembered. Its more like 1m to 2m an hr... Why do people do rc lol??? 
---
A bezel less iPhone? Dude you didn’t even try on this one. 
---
Dude doesn’t even have bank pin or auth 
---
Hope you’ve finished DS and won’t have to sit on that plate body a while. Grats man!
---
but really it's the bigger problem...
---
if they have access to your email then you have bigger problems to worry about than this game.
---
99% of players will do stuff that gives them the average chance be around 30m xp, or atleast high enough where you are always considered «lucky» to have it even with 99.
---
So unless he spesifically mentions him doing seaweeds or other rare stuff like mushroom patches, then you will be considered lucky in my mind.
---
Its going to take so long to do as f2p...
---
perfect way to rwt and keep your account
---

---
Pretty afk past 77 , decent gp/hr for skilling and the most common reason, diaries/maxing.
---
You aren't even a 1/4 of my OSRS Clue count guaranteed. It hardly matters because it just gives choice. It adds no difference in the overall amount of clues being completed as clue scrolls enthusiasts do clue scrolls as soon as they get them anyways. The only difference stacking clues makes is I can wait for a slayer task to be over to do 2 clues instead of taking 2 breaks inbetween.
---
So you want non degradable barrows?
---
Take it. Take it in your hand and throw it.
---
That's not the vibe I got, but to each their own :P
---
If you don't want to you don't have to obviously. I was just saying it would be legendary if you already had 99 crafting just from trying to get a bond.
---
what if they fixed it like they did for pest control and create level tiers, good rewards, and let us wear cape/hoods?
---
but when the account is recovered both auth and bank pin get removed, right?
---
Agreed and agreed.
---
Lmao exactly what I told myself
---
yeah it's just like a tinderbox, a red bead, a wood axe and a feather
---
I didnt get phished I got recovered :( And I know who did it. at least his discord name. My info was compromised through a database. 
---
Dude, are you blind? I have attitude because people can't understand or read, what the fuck? The entire fucking point you missed was the fact that the people who bought the bonds get banned, not the ones who received the bonds. How did you even cross that gap in the first place? Your talking about: people getting banned for receiving "bad" bonds. EVERYONE ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT: BANNED FOR BUYING BONDS USING "BAD" MONEY. Now where did I leave my high horse..
---
I just want to be made a pmod. I think with enough pmods who don’t abuse the power the game will be a lot better. Seeing one as a kid was great, I watched what I said, etc. I’ve been playing osrs since launch and literally seen 5 pmods. 
---
I actually disliked Fremennik Isles more, I hated going back and forth and back and forth between the islands. Both still relatively fun quests, though.

apparently you can change what you keep but I can't seem to do it
---
idk why people are downvoting you this was my first thought as well. While i understand it would defeat the purpose of the region locked ironmen...it would be cool af
---
That's unfortunate. I'm curious, though, as to why people don't use the actual Support feature of the website. No memeing. Genuinely curious if Jagex actually doesn't utilize that feature or...? I know when I've supported tickets in the past, they were always quick to respond and offer solutions. I dunno, maybe it's a crap shoot. Goodluck anyway, dude.
---
Meet Iron Bidiss, my hacked normal ironman. After recently getting a twisted bow in the Chambers of Xeric I decided to up the ante. No email 2FA, no bank pin, no screenshot censoring. But this time, I can't keep my account from getting hacked. All leading up to taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: getting customer support.

i think kraken could potentially?

assuming I do sapphire rings to 99, from where I am now, not including costs I could sell them for 187.5m
---
I'm nearly crazy enough to do this. 
---
Nah, this is probably the best one yet. I don’t understand how people get hacked by showing a username or bank. Imo those are the same people that clicked a solowoox link and exposed their account to some bad people. 
---
So... Who goes through the effort of hacking an account, and then leaves 20m+? Seems oddly suspicious to me.
---
I was half expecting some kind of T\_D joke so this was pleasantly surprising :D &lt;3
---
&gt; For example, an extra optional addition could be to link a cell-phone number that can never be viewed or changed on the account.
---
And then you move, change phone numbers and can't authenticate anymore.
---
&gt; I came back the other day to start playing again and couldn't locate my authenticator account number, so I basically lost my ability to get into my account. So what did I do? Literally just typed in my password, removed auth, when into my 2fa email, confirmed.
---
In the case of Jagex the've offloaded some of the security to your email provider. In most cases when you have 2FA it's required for both the game and to access the site. RuneScape only has it for the site and they get away with this by making you confirm the removal by email.
---
So for example if you want to secure your Amazon account all you need is a strong password and 2FA. To secure Runescape you need a strong password, 2FA, a strong email password and 2FA for your email.
---
Although they absolutely should have 2FA for their site as well since when you're logged in you can access the message center. When they do that they'll be more secure than say Instagram which doesn't require email verification to remove the authenticator
---
Do it no balls

---
When your membership ends you get teleported to Lumbridge respawn, but that doesn’t explain your missing items, etc. You probably got hacked and the hacker didn’t change your account info.
---
I'll pk someone suspiciously ungeared if there's nobody else around. As soon as there's a better target, I'm switching.
---
Killing ungeared players doesn't make the pker a bottom feeder. Most of the time I want a break from world hopping and the off-chance at hidden bankloot.
---
Maybe that's what the eyeroll was supposed to mean, I hope so anyway
---
Low key thought you had range Cape on for the whole comic. WP. . .
---
It's obvious YOU'RE not experienced with PK'ing when you don't know this already. I'm done here, I've made my point.
---
People always scream RWT but for ironmen especially I find it incredibly unlikely someone would discard a couple thousand hours for 1 grand. That said this guy is not answering a lot of questions so I think it's possible he's just lying for attention.  It's possible he lied from the start and used edited/old images.
---
Actually unhackable. Gz on tbow. 
---
Recolors for Justiciar too pls
---
It's alright because it wasn't a man saying that about women. 
---
Dont worry the community doesnt understand that 3rd party clients are the most obvious phish. I'm with u on this. Friend got hacked through bank pin and auth.
---
I remember making an f2p ranging pure back in the day.
---
This would've been about 12 years ago and I wasn't very knowledgeable about pures but I remember I always watched pure youtube vids and I wanted some of that fat loot.
---
When I say not very knowledgeable about pures and an f2p ranging pure, that's literally all I did. Range. No KO weapon or swaps just purely ranging with a shortbow. I remember I literally started pking at like 10 range. 
---
It worked ok, getting a kill was such a rush. I remember my name being edgy for a 12 year old like back_2_lum or something. Kinda wish I could remember it just to log in and laugh at myself. I remember feeling like a fucking legend in my green dhide chaps and vambraces.
