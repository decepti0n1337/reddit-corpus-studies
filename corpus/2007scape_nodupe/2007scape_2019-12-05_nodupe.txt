You can‚Äôt wake up sleepy if you never go to sleep

yikes

I have had leavers too, but I've had a lot more great teammates that stuck it out until the end, even after getting the points they needed for the torso. It sucks to have leavers, but that doesn't mean you have to become a leaver yourself and add to the problem.
---
I do have the current password, but I don‚Äôt have the email or any info on my account.
---
I always used my username and password to log in. Never used my email, and now that email was deleted a few years back on gmail for not using it
---
Lmfao, jagex shouldn‚Äôt be censoring ANY posts on this subreddit, And it‚Äôs weird that you‚Äôre in full support of it

?

Mole

How did it to?

Your making such a statement by not playing. Good for you üòÇ
---
Just go to the runescape wiki
---
They are doing she shearer also
---
This is common, it's easy to spoof email headers

Agreed his ‚Äúpublic service announcement‚Äù probably did more harm than good and just tried to create drama.

Glad you got perm muted, people like you are the cancer of the ge.

There are rs3 lore pages on their wiki, but a lot of it isn't applicable to osrs.

I found this youtube audiobook playlist in an older reddit thread tho, for osrs lore.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkL2uTQvdz9AgT_VYf3laAQ-Be8KHBiNk

im diggin it

Getting back into things after 9 years of not playing, and man is it unfortunate that all of the stats carried over to RS3 but not OSRS.
---
You can recover your account to reset the authenticator. You may also want to switch to an app with a backup option.
---
Somewhere around 60 to 70 hours depending on rng, how crowded locations are, and willingness to do methods like 3ting. Getting a pet would shave around 5 to 10 hours off.
---
Hey man, I'm just trying to play the guy i made the last time i played. If other people enjoy it good on them.
---
How do I recover my account with no information on, when it was made, early passwords, or any of the other bullshit they want at account recovery
---
Thats why they are blocked. High weighted tasks i dont want to do or have to skip every 3rd task.  Maybe im just misunderstanding your reasoning.
---
Im sorry you feel that way, have a wonderful day.
---
It‚Äôs just today‚Äôs trend. It‚Äôll probably die out soon, but some still stick around or get mentioned from time to time. Kinda like the stamina potion bridge

Houses technically are depreciating assets, yes sometimes houses go up in value depending on the market but we all know volatile real estate can be. When it comes to the car loan, the easy answer is stocks, bonds, invest into a company or small business, maybe high yield savings accounts if the rates are right,  etc. I sold and financed cars for years , and through working behind the scenes and dealing with a lot of wealthy customers that's basically where I got this info from

I got an email about their store being updated and hoped to see these but saw some hot garbage instead. Oh well my moneys safe for now

Yes it's not like several thousand people pay them 20$ a month for this sort of thing.

I've been looking for someone to play with too but most content in osrs is solo isn't it?
---
I honestly forgot that I used to do all my skilling with friends. I do everything solo now too, friendslist is full but never talk to anyone. How sad.

I‚Äôll take a jar. Still need one from the collection log lol

This subreddit is one of the largest RS communities out there. Things that are discussed here have a direct impact on what happens in this game (for better or for worse). It has enough influence that Jagex posts here as an official line of communication, and it has enough influence that if the top post says "the economy is crashing!!! gp means nothing!!!" people here are dumb enough to believe that without looking any further. Just look at how Rendi's video was received right at the start: people were praising him for "saving" the economy, calling him RuneScape's savior, and it took longer for people to realize "shit maybe we shouldn't have instructions on how to abuse a potentially game ruining bug, *a bug that hasn't been fully fixed*, right here on this sub". I'm all for freedom of speech, but the caveat to that is sometimes censoring free speech to prevent public panic.
---
I still maintain my position that you are expecting too much from randoms. Same reason why I don't raid with randoms - who the hell is splitting a Tbow when one drops? Sure, there are communities that exist to prevent drop scamming, but a new identity is always just a double name change away.
---
Whats up with all the mole shit

game is an MMO you should have to compete for resources at some point

Same issue here

My ethernet went out so I switched to WiFi, then once it came back I got dc'd and reconnected, all the music I've unlocked appeared at once. This happen to anyone else before?
---
Someone posted a mole meme, got thousands of upvotes, so now others are copying it so they can (potentially) get thousands of upvotes. No i don't know who started it, but if you a care enough I'm sure you could do a simple search and find out.
---
These stopped being funny and are just spam now.
---
I now see other posts regarding this issue. So yes, confirmed.
---
Getting the same thing
---
Nice

Same for me bud

To be fair, they're not *really* gods. They're just *mortals pretending to be gods*.
---
If you ask a true god, like Zaros or one of the Elder gods, they'd not recognize them as being true gods.
---
Scythe is kind of annoying to use. It has a fair amount of uses but in some cases its only slightly better than the option that, you know, doesn't cost 1k a swing.

Max level is best. You can do it at lower level but it's not ideal
---
Seems that way
---
He's not suggesting a fucking instant ban lmao
---
Well if you're bored on your main and don't have any plans for your cash stack I say go for it... your alt is a pure so i'm sure you've already thought about builds you like.. so do that! Good luck brother.
---
Tears of guthix doesn't work like that

Jesus. I‚Äôve had some shit go down in my life recently, and that alone is enough to make me give up trying to get from 89-90 slayed because I don‚Äôt have the motivation.

And you crazy motherfuckers are doing shit like this without being able to trade or bank. 
---
Nice.
---
Smart, the xp/hr doesnt mean anything to me. But my mind set was if i get rid of jad then ill have a higher chance of greater demons , boss task , arma , dagannoth because they also weigh just as much. All around 3% ish
---
Careful man you‚Äôre gonna piss off all the moles in this sub

ya filthy animoal

so, my issue started because i got a forced name change. I decided on a name, and saved it, only to realize that i forgot to capitalize. 
---
the name changer says that my name is taken if i try to capitalize it. does this mean that i will have to waste two more bonds to get the name i want? current name &gt; some random name &gt; Current Name
---
You make money with it which negates cost. If you‚Äôre using it on regular everyday slayer tasks, it costs too much I suppose

Drop rate of pet:
---
    1/3000
---
On a given kill, chance that you don't get the pet:
---
    2999/3000
---
The chance that you don't get the pet 15,967 times in a row:
---
    (2999/3000) * (2999/3000) * ... * (2999/3000) = (2999/3000)^(15967) ~ 0.00488 = 0.488%
---
DONT OPEN THE LINK MAN THATS HOW THEY GET YA
---
Wtf this isn't mole related
---
This is actually a really cool idea, and that's coming from someone without a 99 in anything. But I doubt they'll ever do this unfortunately.

Yuppp just came to the subreddit to check if was the only one. It was working a couple hours ago

yeah, got the same problem.

game where you cant interact with other players, and you are asking for instanced where you dont have to interact with other players?

Turn off low detail mode.

I'm having a problem too

115cb is required for maximum points, best is obviously max though.

Hes a snake. Zero integrity and will sell out any chance he gets to boost his views at the cost of his rep. I lump him in the same shit heap as sir pugger and boomepickill. Fucking trash kids that should not be representing our community tbh.
---
I hate shit like that in games where the player essentially becomes The Chosen One‚Ñ¢, and I feel like the start of that began/was seeded during the While Guthix Sleeps quest, and it went off the rails ever since.
---
I like OSRS because my character actually feels like some bumblefuck who wandered out of a swamp town, and because they are simultaneously a genius and idiot(evident by quest dialogue) - end up being dragged on some wild rides.

I‚Äôm asking for a work around to being told to fucking kill myself in a boss where you get 20k if there is more than 4 people in the world doing it.

Cool. Just making sure. Trying to do the no xp waste at work..now im bored.
---
Good not just me lol
---
There probably isn't because basically no one makes flatpacks (don't bother making them imo unless it's to make 1 for a friend who needs it).
---
you do not get 20k a kill lmao even with lots of people its very good money/hr

Bruh this is wack ty for digging this up

Haha shit. A guy gets used to not working at work hey?

Run a fibre optic line to my house and you've got a deal! for real though in high detail mode the fps drops so much the bomb gets me every time

Did jagex delete banned accounts? I had my account permanently banned for macroing a few years ago. I decided to log back in and I wasn't banned, however my players have been deleted. I want to know if my old account of 10+ years is deleted forever. I tried to appeal my ban a couple years back but they said they would not look into it.
---
I envy you mate gz
---
Could you do something about shop restock timers? Maybe something like RS3 where everyone has their own individual shop. It's a major issue for area locked content like Zeah in Twisted League right now, but it's a major issue for Ironmen in general because restock timers are extremely slow for equipment, mainly. Or stuff like chocolate bars at Kourend Castle.
---
You can literally make these yourself for about sixteen dollars. That's what I did. Jagex would probably sell them for sixty or some shit.
---
Having the same issue. Assuming servers are down.
---
Is nothing sacred?
---
But there's been reports of large bot farms moving to locations today, the complete shit servers lately starting right around the time the dupes did. Now not all coincidences are a conspiracy but almost all conspiracies have a lot of coincidences.

Spend a few bil on darts and watch yourself obliterating any other grind to 99 in like 3 hours.

Base 85‚Äôs-90‚Äôs in combat and having 78 herb is polite

Shame they never refund membership time for their technical problems.

What are your stats?

I‚Äôve facing issues for the past 1.5 hrs trying to access via mobile
---
Molebile?
---
Hell yeah, all I have is a btw btw
---
I'm guessing the 95 farming came from pure herb runs
---
Fun fact, it was recently proven to be wrong. When tantalum theorized the number he was distracted the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table

would help me a lot to have a nice alt!!

Congrats! 1kc Phoenix happened for me in the main game. Have been super unlucky in twisted league to make up for it lmao

That's a ~2.6% increase which will lead to ~2.6% increased xp/hr and up to ~2.6% increased profit/hr if you're killing stuff for money

ah must've missed that when i first checked it out, thanks!

I jammed these into another cable at work that looked like to be exact fits but it doesn't work and now they won't come apart

Servers down issue same.

Making the mole the purplish color was a nice touch. Quality mole meme
---
It has 11gp under the beer. It's clearly an edit
---
imagine telling an anti-cheating specialist to fix servers
---
exactly, thats literally the reason pvp in osrs will never change and grow. honestly not fun after doing the same pvp same weapons for 9 years.
---
Yeah salarin would only be supplemental, but it would be very slow magic and HP exp at any rate, and you could just stop if you got too close to 99. How about minigame herb sources, like agility arena, pest control, temple trekking? Worthwhile or inefficient for a UIM? And regarding seeds, if you're going for untrimmed herb you probably can't sit at master farmers all day, you'd have to stop thieving at some point well before 99 herb, so are there other good sources?
---
Thanks for answering. I love UIM strategies. I have a UIM attack pure I play for fun, I want to get into the warriors guild with 99 atk and no other combat skill raised (other than HP)
---
This smells like f2p bot bullshit
---
You get two stunbreak abilities. Anticipation and Freedom. The former must be used before you are stunned, and the latter is the only one that can break a stun. (Technically there is transfiguration but that is an ult and it‚Äôs like anticipation). 
---
Anticipation has a cooldown of 20 seconds. Freedom 30. Anticipation lasts 10 seconds. Freedom 6. You can‚Äôt be stun immune forever. And I say I hate stuns because unlike binds, they prevent you from eating or changing prayer in response to your opponent‚Äôs next attack. Also did I mention whole there are only two stunbreak abilities, there are more than two stun abilities on the mage ability book?
---
I understand how the abilities work. I just hate them for pvp. I personally think it‚Äôs bad design, and I‚Äôm not the only one, evidently. Rs3 pvp is a very very small community compared to OSRS, because most people do not like EoC pvp.
---
Oh no.
---
1b renevue is not equal to 1 billion net worth (hence the name billion dollar company), just like if you earn a billion dollars over your lifetime and spend most of it you arent considered a billionaire cause your net worth isnt a billion. What constitutes those terms is having that amount of money immediately available and able to be seen.
---
Ive been looking into this and the only answer ive come up with is making an alt to get bh kills im not a fan of cc or risk PvP so i was gonna get the pouch and then golden spec for my sgs and never touching bh again.
---
But mine scared me I was on and everything was good my phone died with the app opened. Charged the phone turned it back on and cant connect to server I have uninstalled 4 times before getting on reddit to find out it's not just me.

Ok we get it, don't need to repost

No I just leave it there constantly retrying. It keeps disconnecting though. This is the first time this has happened to me in year's. Its not that big of a deal. It'll be fixed soon. Im just a little surprised jagex hasn't addressed it yet.

Especially in the Zamorak following, I could see this being the case. You have freedom to do what you want, but if two zamorakians meet at a crossroads, only the stronger will prevail. Here Iban was simply in the way. He should have been stronger if he wanted to live. (Right? Power through strength?)
---
Damnit bobby. No seriously you f**ked up enjoy your membership. Theres a button for redeeming the bond to change your name instead of adding time. Kinda sneaky but at least they let you change it.
---
Mine isn‚Äôt working either, this is garbage. I could‚Äôve maxed in the time the servers have been down.

Jagex can find the player who got the pet on their 26th kc recently üëΩüé£

I smell a dupe

No it's not. It would be nice to have membership time credited since I bought a 3 month for the first time in 6 months just to play league and the servers are continually down

CONVERT ALL GP TO TRADING STICKS ASAP

Probably my favorite one so far, especially the ghostly God Kin- I mean Giant Mole in the back.

Why are you in full void with Avernic + Tent whip *at sand crabs*?

I got my mole pet on kill 1000 exactly and it was really satisfying

Ok good, I'm just glad it's not just me. It's been like this for hours now.

... I'd be pleased to get his big bone in my body. 
---
(Sorry.)
---
Yes.
---
If that was true there would be much more then a roll back, the servers would probably stay off until they could rework the whole system.

Gamecenter? Last time i seen that iphone just put fingerprint sensors in their phones.

Oof. I just felt like watching Netflix so I wanted to afk fish on leagues on mobile. Rip.

probs to communicate with the elves on the other side?

Discord good(enough). Twitch on the other hand, bad.
---
Funny that no one can log in and the website still says 60k+ players online.
---
I mean yeah that would be why I said "so much content" and not "all content".
---
Just disappointed to see so many things borrowed from rs3 vs originality
---
This is optimal to maximize rolls with minimal exp though lol
---
I honestly dont do shit but whats your total and combat level?
---
Before you comment just know i refuse to pk.
---
Still works on PC, I think it's just mobile.
---
Good luck finding hoodies with these sleeve combos
---
If youre like me and hate pest control just shoot for like 20-25 points a day. It's not a lot at once and you'll be done in a couple weeks.
---
is Zammy chaotic neutral or chaotic evil? Either way, I could see that being the case. However, I'm still not sure why Iban was "in the way" if they could use the overpass
---
Why doesn‚Äôt Jagex make some sort of announcement on the website? Servers have been down for hours now.
---
Next time you bank, drop all your magic gear on the ground so everyone knows the spot has been claimed while you‚Äôre gone.
---
I'm having the same problem. The app hasn't been working right for hours- I was about to make a post about it.
---
You clever molerfucker
---
OMG that mole is a total cutie!
---
So are you leaving the community then?
---
Can't speak for everyone but sometimes I type fast enough before the number text field shows up to type in an amount or quantity for your buy or sell offer. Then I just end up with numbers in my chat field.
---
Could be something else though.
---
I have the same problem
---
Came here looking for this. 
---
Same.
---
No, but I'm changing my rating to 1 star until this gets fixed.
---
I recovered an account that the email provider deleted my email to. If you can remember anything like you got 55 attack at rock crabs around may 2018 theres a good chance you could recover it. Ideally if you bought membership or bonds giving them a card number or anything helps hugely. If you kept the same bank though the years they should have records of everything about your account.
---
Ffs lmao

Thank you :)

Thanks! I think I spent almost 1M for mine xd, Getting pet x.x

Fuck. I'm over 5500kc and I thought I was unlucky

Doesn‚Äôt everyone know that when you bank you‚Äôre supposed to drop all of your gear on the ground so people know the spot has been claimed?

Ah, shame.

questionable ROI
---
Gonna depend on gear, input your stuff into dps calculator and see when your max hit drops down. If your max stays the same from like 118 to 116 then you can just repot at 115 ezpz. If you lose a max at 117, divines are probs worth.

---
It worked bro!
---
You can always sell your molebank and rebuild later. I heard Molekath is like 69m an hour.
---
:(
---
Not working on droid :(
---
Molebile
---
I had a dude kill me at green dragons, I went and made new gear, came back, and he took like one thing I had and left the rest on the ground....
---
A big number to define how many molecules are in a certain weight of an element. You can find how much each element weighs using a periodic table to know how much weight of an element contains one mole of that element
---
Hope that helps
---
Amazing
---
No, I don't have a pc or laptop... and I don't want money, I want the hours that the servers were down added back to my bond timer is all
---
mhm, and go back to playing your other games where your opinions about drop rates are supported by mtx loot boxes
---
I love you
---
yeah was just dc'ed off a australian world, honestly glad i checked the reddit, because i was in the mood to stake my bank
---
it's like talking to a brick wall
---
iPhone as well?
---
Moleble down
---
Yes, mobile is down,
---
Southeast US here
---
I can't find that tweet on the official twitter account of jagex o.O
---
I love you too I never thought you'd say the words
---
Lying? Fake account? There is not a tweet or mod post about this on runescape.com, @Jagex, @JagexSupport, @OldSchoolRS, or @Runescape.
---
I believe it was fake. I saw a image on the subreddit.
---
Saw some guy in a f2p world with a granite maul, begged my cousin to buy me membership, then proceeded to kill cows for an hour thinking I looked like a boss
---
This is so wholesome, I love both of you
---
Then you hit that period where your body feels super tired all of a sudden, and you have to fight through it with caffeine or loud music
---
I don‚Äôt even play rs anymore, but you‚Äôve got my upvote, friend.
---
Phew. I was thinking my new phone was butched
---
Ahhh sorry man :/
---
Give me the big bone Daddy Ash üí¶üí¶üí¶
---
No, no mod responses either. They're keeping us in the dark it seems and we're likely being sacrificed and intentionally ignored while they address the current dupe exploit, to prevent dummy accounts from crashing the market.
---
Seems better to pull the whole game down after a 120 second countdown and fix it globally.
---
Lol I almost took a job at molex hahahahahawow
---
Whoosh? I think? I hope. üò≥
---
Why would they only shut down mobile..also ive been on NA servers all day and no issues at all.
---
Rs moleble
---
More like 5 hours
---
Everyone is posting about it. Maybe if people searched instead of making new posts every minute, it would be easier to see an eventual response from Jagex, if they ever do one.
---
Just went back down for me, I guess I‚Äôll go fuck myself
---
no you're not hidden or locked or anything, its just theres probably 50 other comments in this thread asking the same thing, and another 50 posts on the front page (if you hide all the moles).
---
Oh boy, wait till Song of the Elves, my fave quest in the game by far.
---
Because ~2,000 dummy accounts were used to duplicate billions of gp. They may have discovered the only way to run that many was to use the mobile client. Shutting down the mobile login server would fix it quick if that's the case but if do I'd like a comment on it.
---
Yes, you already said it. Usually. I don't know if they do that either,but I worked at some places who didn't do it. I was always the first who arrived and it was horrible when those things happened. All those emails, error reports and pissed customers, who called over and over again before we officially started working.
---
They'll sort it out in no time once noticed I think.
---
I'm over 25kc with no white lilly seeds lol.
---
Thanks for letting everyone know that you were about to restart your phone.
---
I meant they won't want to fix this problem on a friday, so they won't even acknowledge it until monday.
---
yes mobile servers are down. in cases like this first sort by new and read instead of making the 1000th topic about the same thing
---
Its not entitlement its just not being a dick crashing people who just going about their own business instead of finding a world on the whole list of worlds that their is
---
can you read?
---
All I got are puns and I don't think people will really dig them, y'know?  Most of these jokes are also pretty underground too, so the reference may go over the heads of a few.
---
No I don‚Äôt think I will. I think if I want to ask about the OSRS servers in the OSRS subreddit that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôll do. Thanks though
---
Ah, I see. Sorry, my bad. Let's hope they give us a miracle and fix it before monday.
---
That doesn't make sense. The only way to run that many would be via mobile? You can easily run dozens of clients on a PC, you can't do that on mobile. I highly disagree thats the reasoning..
---
So you got like 3 posts on your feed? It‚Äôs moles all the way down
---
Its 1am went down at 8-9pm deffinetly longer than an hour.
---
I think one of they're servers (probably update server) crashed and the client can't check, if it needs to download an update,which prevents loading the game.
---
You can't stake claim to something you're not at
---
People do them. A while ago they were an insane money maker.
---
Don't know how to use Reddit?
---
You're welcome I agree they're my favorites I took a risk making them so derpy but it paid off
---
Be polite
---
That's depressing now that I think about it (the exploration part)
---
No one ever steals my memes
---
Silence grandayy
---
Just woke up in UK and it's down for me
---
Grow yanillian hops and buy sharks from piscarillious fishing shop after 100% pisc favor.
---
There are only 33 UIM with 99 herblore at all.
---
Never actually looked at the UIM high scores before. Kinda neat.
---
I'm printing this comment out and taping it to the wall above my desk so on a bad day I can look up and be reminded that lifes not all bad
---
Your obviously an irritating person its not taking claim its the fact they were going about their business and you want to come in and force them out and think your not a dick. When the truth is your a dick
---
I think thats a pc issue not an internet issue. Try turning on the gpu plugin if you havent. If your still getting frame drops make sure your drivers are up to date.
---
You guys have to restart your phone and make sure rs is closed before doing so.
---
I see. Before today I didn‚Äôt even know they had dedicated mobile servers, hopefully they get it figured out soon. High alching is so much harder on pc than mobile lol
---
I can't see what you did there in sorry
---
Jagex better give us free membership
---
Damn that sounds like really annoying time. Also, I hope jagex has their shit together
---
Sadly bro, when I clear the top ones I see them still at ge doing the same old spamming.

Also if your middle mouse button can be pressed left or right, that zooms the camera in and out respectively.
---
Mine works fine..
---
Copy and pasted from the other post that someone just made two minutes ago...
---
Check the front page, search by new. There are dozens of these posts. Yes mobile is down. Yes it's bullshit. Yes ü¶Ä$11ü¶Ä.
---
Maybe at most like 10 then .. not all 100 of them though.
---
That's what I was thinking, there's been a lot of lag spikes as well
---
More rule 34 of konar
---
Just imagine, future explorers get to either be vaporized by hostile alien species or confirm we are utterly alone in an uncaring universe. Sounds great!
---
The servers are down for some reason. So i guess just wait.  I found out like 30min ago.
---
Yup, similar situation here. Got Rocky between 10 and 15 thieving on my main, shit luck so far in the league.
---
Good to hear someone‚Äôs mobile works. Now to get everyone‚Äôs working.
---
Checked yesterday, there was only 2 pics. What a shame.
---
I experience the same. Mobile is not loading.
---
Your childish as fuck thats all that their is. Because you dont want to admit your a dick people are now entitled? So everytime i wanna be a dick i should just say everyone else is entitled huh?
---
Lol I got distracted by the mole memes tbh to get far down enough to see any posts.
---
‚ÄúSearch by new‚Äù
---
So uh, how'd that go?
---
Funny that, two days ago I've been on and off playing my f2p char without realising the drama that's going on with mobile
---
Yeah for a company like Jagex they should have somebody "on call" to come in and fix problems like this.
---
Looks to be fairly poorly
---
It would be awesome if we could get a mole player race, even if it's only cosmetic
---
Still down...
---
Big oof. Hope it gets figured out soon.
---
Love when Zamorak killed Guthix and then tried to fuck my shit too
---
That's some big gay right there
---
God damnit I was just thinking about posting this
---
You need to get it to load into an aus server, i think only way to do it is use your phones os browser, samsubg net for android safari for apple etc, go to world selection on rs website and select aus world and then let it load it in the rs app, although some people dont get this pop up.
---
Once the world is loaded in app select a non aus world as those worlds are ironicly down..
---
Oh neat, you have flare for it! I would say the DS2 bosses and the final boss of Song of the Elves were the worst, I also got reallllly close in a few skills for 86 CB so that was a bit of a challenge.  
---
I don't think I'll keep it, it was just a goal I wanted to achieve and I'm looking forward to PVM :)
---
I wanted to do a meme like this :(
---
I think of it more along the lines of msg (colonizing the moon and space around earth).
---
I found my new background! Well done sir or madame!
---
They‚Äôll be back up molementarily
---
Wait, people aren't still viewing Saradomin, Guthix &amp; Zamorak the way tehnoobshow portrayed them???
---
If your phone asks if you want to open the world using the RuneScape app, it should work. Make sure the app is off before telling the page to open with the app. 
---
And any non-American server *should* work, I‚Äôm on an EU server rn, better than Australia if ur in America.
---
You went too far mate. That‚Äôs God Ash!

I only need 3 letters to know what this is about.

RUNESCAPE IS PIXELATED!? NOOOOOOOOO
---
Molebile still down for me
---
youre gonna love Arceuus Ascent if you know Thanos
---
Seems to be the new issue. If you can manage to change worlds some how you might be able to get on
---
Runescape was originally created with a death mechanic where if you died and didn't get your stuff back in 2-3 minutes, it would disappear or someone else would pick it up, this is a massive item sink. As you've likely noticed, deaths are safe 99.9% of the time now so that item sink no longer exists. Thanks to this, items will all gradually drop in price without a proper sink. However this is a slow process, but the process is sped up much quicker when gold farmers are going after the particular item in question, which is why I would imagine DWH is dropping in price.
---
Also just note that I could be wrong, DWH might be dropping due to recent updates and a potentially lower demand of the item for some reason, if this is the case then the next update with a boss that DWH is good against will raise the price again, however if this happens and it drops yet again its likely the lack of death mechanic and gold farmers.
---
**TL:DR** No proper death mechanic and gold farmers are heavily farming DWH.

Evetyday i dream about konar being my wife. When i wake up i feel my life is incomplete so i rush to open osrs to be with my waifu konar again.

You ever heard of 06mate who had like 10 customs?

Android users, if you vpn into australia it will connect
---
Not allowed to say at the molment
---
Yes I heard that, players in discord from Aus can log in.
---

---
Literally me last night. I just kept going back to Konar for a Hydra task and she kept churning me shit. Ended up 12:32am, work at 4am (I‚Äôve just finished as I‚Äôm writing this) and black demands in the chasm of fire..
---
Uhuh. Doesn't matter if you take 5 minutes to bank, if you leave your spot then you lose your spot. Do the simple thing of finding a new world when you see a white dot when you get back, don't be an idiot and expect the other guy to hop cus you were banking lmfao.
---
As a rs3 scaper, this is for rs3 not osrs.
---
Because it will redirect you to an aussie world and you will be able to connect, try it for yourself

Is noreply@e.runescape.com a legit email address?
---
It's now 8:42 am in the UK...assuming that the team were unaware of the issues in the middle of the night, there's no excuse for Jagex to not be acknowledging the issue now, but as usual, no action on their end until it's too late.
---
I've never really been affected by any of the issues in the last year, but this sort of thing makes me question why I pay a subscription fee.
---
How did you... *Looks at Farming Lvl* oh...
---
Ootl, what is the reason behind the moles and servers?
---
I did the same with surfshark, worked like a charm
---
You are confusing "mole" with "avagadros number"
---
Its 3:50 am and the servers still not connecting for android. They should be embarrassed.
---
I wondered why the whole Reddit was saying entire servers were down and I was just plotting along on Aus world's playing league

Oh please. Dont even mention Riot. They are yet to balance their game and their servers are shit as well.

They said they didn't want them to be toggleable because the downsides are intentional. The flaw was giving some perks no downsides in my opinion, like Endless Endurance is not only the strongest choice but it also has no downside, whereas Dark Devotion is the weakest even without the downsides.

which wildly slayer tasks can you NOT cannon? thanks in advance

No jealousy bro, I don't really care if people make a merch. I'm just saying that's what most people would probably say their reasoning to voting no would be. I'm all for torag's hammers hitting twice. I've thought that since I was a kid.
---
Did it work?
---
You're right, maybe there is hope.
---
You just need to be awake until 10am or something and then you trick your brain into thinking its a brand new day and you get an energy boost
---
I don't mean you in particular. I don't understand why that would be the popular vote. I can only rationalise it as jealousy.

Its ridicilously easy to sink money to a single bar trip if you arent careful, thats why I like to get drunk beforehand and only sip on 1-2 drinks during the whole night

Use energy potions, strange fruits, super energy.
---
Leave within your means!!!
---
That would explain things
---
I wanna just down vote it.
---
But I can't.
---
Will the severs be down for x amount of time or back up after the update?
---
All good hope you get the ranking you are seeking on the hiscores page!
---
I do
---
Mage training arena is also highly botted. It should 100% be added to arcane, corp drops have decreased in value since the announcement of tome.
---
Allow me to make a more applicable analogy then. How would you feel if I took a dollar and 37 cents from you and through it out the window?
---
That's just what we were meant to do in this day and age.
---
Since the overlords have controlled the means of production in all walks of life, we have been left to consume.
---
Its glorious.
---
yeah i was thinking that the magic skillcape to swap spellbooks would be the best case but im only 95 magic atm. 
---
i think this would be my go to once i get 99 magic
---
My post stated that the game has lost "charm" and now feels "sterile", 2 clearly subjective points from my own perspective.
---
Why am i having to explain this? Why are you supporting someone who is clearly taking someones words out of context and running with their own narrative?
---
Nah mate
---
So are the changes to graceful set effect not in this update?
---
PANIC BUY ARCANES!!!
---
new book will still be BIS in every situation, arcane is junk now.
---
I mitigated this by going to the OSRS website, selecting world select on the left side and randomly going through worlds (I tried Aussie ones) and then clicking to open in app and one finally loaded.
---
It just worked again after I was logged out by the update.
---
arcane will still crash as 4% damage is always better than 5 accuracy in any situation.
---
&gt;It's almost like you want to force powercreep by posting preposterous suggestions
---
Are you surprised?
---
Just look at this post, people are bitching the "tome is dead content now" already do you not know how full retard this sub will go when jagex don't add anything BiS or powercreep like to a supposed new "boss".
---
The community pushed this game into the entire powercreep garbage and "every new boss/monster needs new bis" content. or "it needs to be 75mgp/hr" otherwise it's not going to pass a poll because "dead content".
---
&gt; Magic is utility first and damage second....
---
Rofl says who
---
Hey u/wealdie1day, I do trolo corps with max accs and I'm not interested in pets, if you want 1+3 boosting a lot more kc/h (all yours), pm me.
---
Will charge average corp kill per kc given or else give me all drops with an ely collat (do this on zammy boosting cuz its 14m on this is meh, too much risk i imagine).
---
nice
---
there aren't any lvl 3 skillers in Morytania
---
More likely they will be Venezuelans/hand played gold farming accounts.
---
Cannot wait for the boss killcount hiscores till it goes live. Probably the best update ever!
---
Jagex is killing it. Boss kc highscores already?!!?
---
Welcome. Only rqndom events we get here is the prison
---
Don't post rwt Shit on the Reddit or I'm gonna have all ur accs banned you slimey ball of cheesw
---
Trying this now, cheers!
---
thats what the goverment wants you to think
---
Well seeing as it is a book, it seems more in line with the idea than the arcane would be, but I think it should be its own item personally, rather than artificially raising the price of the mage's book.
---
Yeaaa lets downvote harder woooo!
---
I would guess the limit is there to restrict the number of compares per message. I don't know if these would be string compares based on the username, or if it converts it to some player id and compares that instead? 
---
Also, if the limit is stored in something that is only 1 byte, and it's signed, there might not be too much scope to increase it without changing the underlying type.
---
Definitely a no vote from me if it stays as an upgrade to mage's book.

I can't launch the game on Windows 10. The client won't load. Any ideas why?
---
this is actually nice. i like how the patches that are protected come first before swapping to arceeus. i can also easily slot my hop runs in between as well.
---
i dont have mory elite either so im doing 8/9 patches. thanks for sharing :)
---
Jokes on you, we don‚Äôt do ‚Äúhook ups‚Äù
---
Slightly similar to evscapes killing every monster from scratch. Starting at the lowest lvl monsters and working up, killing max 10 at a time and only being able to use their drops for upgrading and getting gear.
---
Obviously there's some differences in what you've asked about, which sounds fun. You should make it
---
If spending 20k per quest is too much for you, you can improve a lot how you play the game..
---
I‚Äôm kind of sad they‚Äôre removing the claim points thing on Twisted League, I liked clicking the button and watching the bar increase after completing a bunch of tasks.
---
4% mage damage isn't an upgrade?
---
Try refreshing it - I'm able to view it myself now but it's probably going slow due to everyone else refreshing it and trying to view it at the same time unfortunately.
---
I don't have access to high level pvm stuff, nor do I have insanely high runecrafting or the one or two other skills that need to be trained for tens of hours to make decent money.
---
For now all I have access to are pretty mediocre money-making methods, and so a 4k potion that is quite essential to making the game move at a tolerable pace is a quite excessive price.
---
Love the new boss log hiscores (well, once it updates anyway).
---
Have you guys considered adding a time hiscores for bosses/raids as well?
---
well, i only really enjoy pvm/pvp in this game. ironman is like 99% skilling lol. seriously just to start off your account you have to grind 99 fm (i stayed until tome which was around 16m exp) and 99 thieving (by blackjacking unless you're doing ardy med) it's satisfying when you achieve your goals but in the long run it's fucking annoying with extremely long grinds, bosses become dead content the second you get the boss drop you need. (unless zulrah for scales)
---
on a normal account you have the freedom to do whatever you want, on an ironman it's all forced
---
You think? If I open say a YouTube video or a twitch stream at the same time I‚Äôm playing the game gets laggy as hell but my CPU load isn‚Äôt high or anything, as soon as you exit out of the internet based thing the frame rate jumps.
---
I‚Äôll trim your gilded armor for free; just hand it over
---
cerb hiscores isnt working. comes up with something to do with league points instead.
---
The HiScores pages are trying to get up to speed as everyone refreshes it and logs in and out. Should hopefully catch up soon.
---
"Just one more raid this is the tbow I just know it."
---
They already had these killcounts before though
---
I‚Äôm gay for moleman

because nobody wants to draw fat bitches

Get piety rigour augury for sure if you do. Thay make or break a med lvl

How long did this take OP?
---
Ehh... they pretty much allow pseudo child-porn.

So by literally you mean the tome losing +10 attack

Yeah fishing blows. it was one of my last to max on rs2 and its one of my last on osrs

The person with the highest Dagganoth Kings KC is a streamer. He's almost 200m slayer xp mainly doing DKs, Fight Caves and Abby Demons.

He also has the highest Jad KC.

How long have you been on tutorial island for? I know it takes some players months and even years to figure it out. Maybe you haven‚Äôt completed it yet and just forgot.
---
He-man, superman, GI Joe, etc
---
ah yes sorry this one didn't have a mole on it. fuck off lmao
---
&gt;Jagex fell into their own trap by putting bis items in minigames
---
there's nothing wrong with this part though, if anything they should have been untradeable like barbarian assault or pest control, you know like rewarding people who actually play that specific content instead of just letting people just buy bonds and buy the items

'Sorry for the server issues, we've recently discovered our company is filled with moles somehow. Working on a fix, thinking about having Mod Fox hunt them all down. '

My standard client doesnt work either. Mobile is working now. Apparently Aus VPN helps.

I downloaded runelite and it works. Hilarious that people with the normal client can't play but runelite can...
---
I saw a guy called rs3 is shit the other day. No idea how he managed to get shit in his name.
---
I hope the great for you, I died a little inside seeing your KC and being that dry. 
---
I have had some bad RNG in this game like taking 147 runs of fishing trawler to get the angler set but I think your RNG is pretty rough on that one.
---
Someone made a mole + olm meme and then it spread like wildfire after someone did a mole kraken a few hours later
---
It's add on so you don't devalue old content.
---
Way too much work. Just make a new boss. No dev wants to rework wintertodt‚Äôs code to fit a boss into the works. Also could destroy solo wintertodt.
---
How did you get this list? Kinda interested in other bosses aswell
---
Nice id come meet him for a few mins if I saw this at the time

Makes sense. Thanks!

They just released a new section of the hiscores for bosses.

Yeah im also out of the loop as well, guess ill just enjoy them while they last

The shield didn't even go down visibly, people are fucking stupid
---
The prayer scroll went down 1m presumably because the new mage offhand will open up a newer budgeted tier below using a shield in its place with the prayer active, I'm thinking the value of the shield is going to hold strong looking at the comparative stat combos of the scenarios
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
earlier this morning, i could connect on mobile.  now i can't connect on desktop, but can connect on mobile?  when i try to launch the desktop game, it says something about an inability to get the game configuration from the site.  is this due to the update?  i'm concerned and confused.  i'm a new player, so this is all unknown to me.  thanks!
---
I'm not inconveniencing another person by farming a boss though
---
Hoes mad
---
Cerberus HS page doesn‚Äôt appear to be working
---
Enjoy my spade, king
---
I'd rather keep all 3 sepereate. Mage book can stay a cheaper alternative while arcane provides accuracy and defense while the tome is just about bigger red splats(potentially removing the mage def bonus). The main problem is the game is balanced around damage&gt;all.
---
and hes not on highscores anymore holy shit
---
guess their antibot system isnt very good
---
Can we just talk about how this dude has 77 pray and 87 herblore with 10k CoX kc. Jesus Christ..
---
He probably saved his family, no big deal.
---
I think he just get mas reported. Any jagex system already had that boss kill data probably
---
lol that's insane. Its like getting 200mil xp in att and strength with a combat bracelet.
---
Are you braindead? The tome still outclasses Arcane by a mile. Nobody was complaining about the price of the shield crashing, 10% on an offhand is just absurdly overpowered.
---
They wouldn't change the color for each league trust me. There aren't enough distinguishable colors for that to be a good idea
---
I‚Äôll take lower minimum wage for actually useable internet and much cheaper video games lol
---
Defender isnt a difficult grind, but youll need higher defense to wield a dragon one. Just do the grind on defensive, thats what I did from those exact stats
---
So you argue the best in slot items shouldn't be based on old rewards but then say that not all content needs to be relevant to endgame? Does the tier list need more padding out? 
---
You're also missing a key part of why they're making the items based on old rewards: it reduces inflation by taking items out of the game. If the lance is added to the economy without removing something, the overall value of the economy increases, and curtailing the bubbling of the in game economy is super vital
---
How is color engine work? I swear sometimes they say stuff like this and it confuses me because I work as a programmer and it really shouldn't be this hard anymore. I get it may be hard in the first year when everyone is learning the engine but it's been a while, making a couple of statements to check different game modes and using a different icon should not be hard
---
The tome still has magic damage %. As long if it has that i will be voting No.
---
does mass reporting give temp ban until jmods resolve it?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/ajNctTI](https://imgur.com/a/ajNctTI) 
---
Yeah that was quick.
---
imagine doing 50k zulrah kc without augury or rigour... smh
---
Thi sart style really reminds me of the game Dragonfable
---
Yeah that's a figured it was lol. Looks like she needed more colors.
---
I will be voting no aswell because of the % damage it gives. I am against these kind of updates that will make a boss like Corp dead content.
---
Same, i really don't know whats up with their systems. For a while i slightly understood, because from what I've heard most of the code is spaghetti, and some of it was this odd home-grown code, but its been 5 years now. Clear it up.
---
But how did you know what to do against the other 2? (3 if this isn't super long ago)
---
Reee I wish I had time to write up what I had in mind for some reward ideas.
---
On the other side of the paper my dude
---
We're all saying the same thing here Josh
---
u have to login and logout to start appearing on the kc hiscores.
---
Think the point is that obvs people want to also try the tome + the arcane SS aswell. If they would make that also an option then we wouldnt have anything to cry about. It is as if they are blind while plenty of people also here want to see the tome with the arcane. I also believe making Arcane + the Tome would make the tome a valueable item from this boss. Corporeal Beast wont be dead and we are all happy.
---
Hiscores seem to be really bugged, some bosses don't even show any kills at all :/
---
Wait they don't have their server tools on work laptops?
---
no
---
also temp bans wont remove you from highscores
---
Shit 200 IQ
---
Because nobody cares about him
---
no mole. didn't upvote
---
You def got the format wrong. The muscle Kings should be the first post, and the kids should be the Pkers.
---
a friend got let off? what? he didnt break any rules unlike boaty 
---
a friend just made advertising gambling video and jagex said "ok thats not allowed btw and ur perm banned on all accs"
---
I'm subscribed with two accounts for $11 each. It's not much at all. I don't wanna stress over getting bonds as in drop trading from an ironman to an account I don't use so I can convert the items into money. I rather work ~30 minutes and pay it that way.
---
I keep checking the hiscores and my killcounts dont appear. I should also be rank 200 exactly for Graador but my RSN doesn't appear. What gives?
---
He didn‚Äôt break any in game rules. But gambling is very much against the game rules and he promoted breaking them to a large audience. He 100% scum bagged for some quick cash.
---
Yeah 1 sulphur lizard task is 10 mediums and takes like 25-30 minutes to complete. You can stack so many 3 step mediums that getting the bis boots is pretty easy.
---
Heres what op said:
---
You can test is yourself with a pro timer software or a custom/bot clients and log timers, there is a split milliseconds response delay from the servers (between 0.055-0.075) if you enter the CORRECT number on your bank pin, so right now all you need to do to bypass someone's bank pin is just use a small script to count the milliseconds between entering number X on your pin to the server response in each number from 0-9 for 4 times and click exit after each time you enter a number to avoid getting locked out for 15min/1hour , this is a major bug in security and apparently it been there for decades and it also explains how some people posted here about how they got there bank hacked even though the pin was still in place when they logged back in, I won't be surprised if this can't even be patched.
---
The same trick works in the Login screen when entering the wrong email , for example entering an email which doesn't belong to any account will result in a fast response from the server and if the email does belong someone it will take longer for the server to response (maybe to check if the password is correct).
---
You can clean grimy herbs in Nardah.
---
I've caught 43 moles irl.
---
A week where this sub may as well just not exist.
---
The avarage loot from zulrah is 143k, 54k kills would equate to 7,722,000,000
---
Nearly 8 billion from 1 account.
---
What is that you want to know?
---
It took about 40 minutes after my first log in/out.
---
Tbf, ranger boots should really be from hard clues. I recall someone suggesting this recently and a lot of responses were either no because hard clues are harder to farm. Some ironmemes also said the same thing. Seems like many don‚Äôt want med clues to stop being a money maker.
---
Probably because it's through your phone provider and someone has to pay them, to pay for you.
---
99% of old content IS irrelevant in reality except for artificially placed ones like Cerberus boots.
---
It's doable, but with that slight delay mobile has sometimes and fat thumbing you gotta be like 110% on point during the had fight
---
But the payment servers are still up. Sounds legit.
---
You will do that. Once you train your agility enough. But its weird why you would think its good to not fail obstacles.
---
I mean its always possible thats a venezuelan or a moneymaking alt instead
---
Mines been acting up all morning then my account get locked for thinking it‚Äôs stolen.
---
I posted a screenshot of an account that no longer appears on the hiscores because it was banned.
---
Oversexualised in what way? The cleavage takes up like 0.05% of the picture, and Konar is a literally a Christmas tree.
---
&gt;But gambling is very much against the game rules and he promoted breaking them to a large audience.
---
player run game of chance hosting is against the rules, he just advertised 3rd party bitcoin gambling site, jagex just decided to make him example of what happens if you advertise gambling which is pretty bs
---
TBH this should probably be nsfw. I got cum on my work monitor.
---
Did you log in since the update ? My killcounts appered after I logged in..
---
That guy isn't. He has a ton of other boss kc and over 2k total.
---
Oh there plenty more to come, you just wait.
---
I didn't even know it had a use, what is it's niche?
---
just flick lol..? it's literally afk too
---
Good stuff on that special attack change.  Having mage be relevant in special attacks while pking looks awesome now that it doesn't combo with d claws.  Nerfing its damage would've made it useless in pking!
---
Dammit, you beat me to it XD
---
I don't get it. Surley he can't trade his fire/ infernal cape? If he was getting capes for other people, he'll need to log on to their accounts? Am I missing something?
---
I was talking about the first guy nvm
---
Getting that gp generally required effort and dedication(excluding bonds, but they are a necessary evil). An account capable of using ferocious gloves is very likely capable of using b gloves already.
---
guacamole...
---
Make sure to use your login email and not your registered email to login

Pure Crew cc, although it's mainly pures who tend to skill. Lots of pvmers though and a fair few pkers.
---
Damn
---
Honestly failing obstacles is the worst thi g fucking ever.
---
It's already a high concentration skill don't also make it longer arbitrarily.
---
I did 70-80 at seers and wanted to fucking die, what‚Äôs 84 for? Diary?
---
Probably because it would turn it to a red background instead of the white. Look at prayer, its cloud is yellow from trim
---
Revs!
---
Hydra
---
Can boss KCs be shown when you look up individual players?
---
karil have no nose why
---
Chaos druids are pretty good money at that level. Especially if you bring a looting bag for longer trips. Plus you‚Äôll get a bunch of heads to to either sell as well or use for prayer
---
Jesus christ that's 50% more than my career job
---
Runelite has a plug-in that does it for you, if that‚Äôs any help. It‚Äôs nice for clan chats
---
The opinion I‚Äôve heard is that there is enough revenue for them to be able to have a backup team, even a 3rd party, that would be able to step in on an emergency case like this one. 
---
I understand things have to get worked on and if everyone is asleep they can‚Äôt be. But by selling a subscription based model, there is some ethical pressure reasonably exerted that the issue either needs to be fixed in a timely fashion, or part of subscription costs refunded or credited.
---
I used to do them but they are only.viable for lower leveled accounts. Mediocre xp and they take too long to harvest.
---
This is fake you bought it from yourself
---
I wouldn't bother. It's easy enough to do this selling to yourself to post on reddit. There are much better things that are rarely traded that you can upsell. (Eg. Obscure quest required items).
---
second longest mole dry streak nice
---
Just think about how OP that would be though?  As an attachment to the arcane it would be BIS mage accuracy, mage % damage, prayer, and decent defensive bonuses.
---
Ankous don't deal that much damage
---
Did you talk to the old man who shows you how to use pok√©balls?
---
Tell me about it dude
---
That still doesn‚Äôt prove this specific account was a zulrah bot. I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt be, but it‚Äôs not a proven fact until confirmed by a mod who actually knows. It‚Äôs far more likely to not be a bot.
---
Is one kill equal one score?
---
I was joking lol. I already have 2 of my slots with decent passive obscure money makers
---
LUL
---
Well, we did, unless you want to add religion to the mix, there wasn't a superior being dictating what every one would be and become. 
---
It is due to the law of the strongest that we're here today. i don't know how far you want to analyze thru time until you realize that essentially we all came from nothing, be it on the caveman age or after it, humans built their own lineage based on our own determination. Some waited for it to fall from the sky, others worked for it.
---
Surely, the smartest and strongest had the advantage and they lead the way. Is it fair? i don't know, you tell me, overall life is not fair no matter how much you complain, and that will never change. 
---
It was due the work of someone back in the lineage that allowed us to be today what we are. Don't get me wrong, i value way more someone who worked their ass to have what they have than someone who gets the spoils of daddy's work. But you can't neglect the work that his dad, or his granddad, or whoever it is had in order to provide for his family.
---
And if we didn't had it that way we wouldn't live in the world that we live today. Surely it's not perfect and we have many issues, but you can't argue how far we become as a species.
---
Many lineages faded over time, be it because of wars or whatnot, people always will rise and fall from power and wealth. And the biggest you rise, the worse it is when you fall. That is the way the world works.
---
That is why i said that somehow somewhere in time we all started from zero. The important thing is that we all have equal opportunities and not equal outcomes. We're not equal, we're different, and there is nothing wrong with that.
---
Stated like a true PVMer
---
Galvek and Seren? Quest bosses kc tracking does not give any sense.
---
Congratulations, please help me find the motivation to spend 50 hours collecting imaginary fish :(. Currently only 82
---
Where do i get this
---
The 109K KC account is not a bot.
---
Probably the first bath you got this year.
---
I‚Äôve played RS for 14 years. Accounts on both games. Neither of them are above 70 agi and i‚Äôd honestly rather runecraft
---
when someone accidentally brings out their whole cash stack, really ticks me off!
---
The mol *IS* Avogadros number
---
Any updates on when mobile will be back and running?
---
Your mother always makes sure to clean me off when we‚Äôre done
---
Yeah you can die infinite times and you'll only lose points.
---
I'm also curious. I play mobile only and can only imagine what I'll go through learning raids via a cell phone
---
Jagex has to pay a larger cut to whoever provides that mobile payment method. That would mean Jagex earns less money, so you need to pay more to compensate.
---
You can die as many times as you please, but olm will be horrible trying to beat solo if you've never been. My suggestion is to go to WDR discord and go on a learner raid, will take an hour maybe depending on the amount of people and it'll be alot easier for you. Or you could always see if any of your friends will let you +1 with them for more points
---
Was pretty empty when I checked
---
Botted or an alt although normally an alt would use a tbow so they wouldn't have that much mage xp
---
Track your own flips and prices using history on the GE on the OSRS app. If you are buying and selling a lot create a spreadsheet or use a notepad
---
simmilar thing happened to me when i was buying yew logs to fletch. bought 10k yew logs for 10gp each cuz some smart ass crashed the market with yew logs.
---
i mean you won‚Äôt discover anything but you definitely have more access to explore the world now than ever thanks to planes and such
---
I do appreciate the input. Thank you.
---
Go easy. We don't want people rage quitting the game!
---
Oof, you still need someone to clean you up after a bath?
---
Hey, still waiting on that conclusion. Are you gonna follow through? Or just pretend you never said this?
---
I jus grinded the past week to get my thieving/hunter up to do mm2 but after unlocking it I realized how aids it is :( 
---
I don‚Äôt have time for a long ass random generated puzzle with a boss at the end..
---
üòÇüíØüëå
---
They could just give everyone who is member at the time a few more days, but personally I don't care much
---
The highscores require people to login/logout to update. It's only been a few hours, I'm sure more will show up soon.
---
worst i ever had to grind for a 5+ herblore boost was like 4 hours, that was such a drag xD
---
theres a couple ge websites, just google an item and theyll show up. look through them and figure out which one youd like to use.
---
What's this meme with cats and death runes??
---
You got me smoked i got 46 lmao desperately need 55....
---
It's not that bad. I play league while I do agility. Lvl 76 on my ironman
---
The 25m and 50m etc skill marks gives so many points so i can see it being done, yet impressive for sure \^\^
---
It did but they don't have to change it
---
Awh you ruined the witty back and forth with that lame comeback shame I was just starting to have fun
---
Ah yes the avacado number
---
It‚Äôs definitely that bad lol. I usually am watching Netflix and messing with some alts when I do train agility though. It‚Äôs just like 10 hours from 60-70 and even worse after that. So yeahhh fuck all that noise lol
---
thanks hoss
---
Just checked, uh since when lol I know they never use to back in the day. I guess it‚Äôs the only rune wep with spec? Makes no sense
---
Also my dad "Nah you cant download that game nothing is free"
---
good thing runescape used to be playable in browser :)
---
lol DAMN
---
Lmao stop being poor then
---
Berserker gut
---
Just have someone leech you
---
magnificent piece of art, my friend
---
That Ahrim's mole hood needs to be a thing.
---
Have someone leech you. Go to a popular world and someone will let u join. Just stand there and don‚Äôt die if they left u join. You don‚Äôt have to go in the rooms
---
This game is arbitrary.
---
I‚Äôd buy for 10.99 USD
---
~550 training an account for some shmoe to call it worthless.  Thank you.
---
Because no one in their right mind would ever think that an item worth 3 gp would sell for 50k. You chuck in 50k as the price because you know for certain that it would instantly buy. It would be annoying if, say, you click to add 5% twice and it doesn't buy. Now you'll have to cancel that purchase and restart the process.
---
You got a source?
---
I usually will lure him back to the swamps when I see him, because fuck that guy

In all my years of being a burrow brother. You never know what‚Äôs going to come through that hole.
---
I vote we replace moles with more realistic wiki pages like this.
---
What the fuck?
---
They cute and mad thicc. Petition to revive Nieve please?
---
You're welcome! Make sure to check the wiki and see what would works best for you. Battlestaves and d'hides tend to be pretty good, but the prices can of course change over time
---
Okay
---
but can you maybe draw the next picture where they are inside and warming their feet by the fire or something lol just an idea
---
Where can I sell my Gold? All I found were sites that were incredibly suspicious...
---
Honestly playing oblivion and Skyrim a lot in many different ways and "rules" really opened me up to how damaging fast travel (teleport) to everywhere is. 
---
It ruins the point of an open world and ruins the appreciation for a pretty well built world. Now osrs isn't TES and there are more things to do in osrs, while the only good thing about TES is the world, but I still think Jagex is very bad at utilizing a well built world.
---
how dare you I‚Äôm crying
---
I got dc'ed halfway through wintertodt 3 times so I gave up
---
Selling gold is against the rules and can result in your account being banned
---
guys only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting
---
Like that's a pretty good joke, but half this reddit actually thinks that's how you fix server problems lmao
---
reindeer sandwich lady is blessed
---
I would buy a bigger inventory too :D
---
Where‚Äôs farming?
---
Wtf, farming cape is missing.
---
It's the only one I have.

Do you have a text guide instead? The video is far to long to actually watch.

Imma stop you right there. Lying is immoral.
---
Okay? I thought that was a legit market. All kinds of YouTubers talk about people selling Gold. Even about Venezuelans earning their food by selling Gold...
---
It's 10 minutes, but only if you drop out of combat at any point. As long as new enemies attack you and aggro you before you lose aggro from a previous enemy (or you never kill that original enemy, ie splashing), you can go up to 20 minutes which is auto-log.

Came to either read or comment this. They also changed the alch price. It was because they split climbing boots into two separate boots, and all existing climbing boots became rock climbing boots. Supposedly for PvP i think.
---
Sick thanks
---
nope, have close to 6k zulrah kills post nerf and it is indeed around 90k/ a kill and around 120k with uniques if you dont go very dry.
---
Great thanks :)
---
Meanwhile, mutated bloodvelds don't drop big bones at all.
---
Sure but which one is more likely to occur, buying your own bronze darts to farm karma or have someone else offer 5K per bronze dart, they‚Äôre not saying it NEVER happens but come on
---
I have over 2k zulrahs like but it didn't show up at all for me. (Also like half of these have no recording of the drops because they were done before the achievement log thing I think.)
---
People don't subscribe and just grind bonds?? I pay $11 bucks a month and have never bought a bond before.

People do it, but it's against the rules. There's no legitimate/allowed way to make real money from in-game gold.

runecrafting is actually a really cool skills (&amp; profitable too) never got these memes

what's the rating you'll give it, reddit post judge?

Quality Year
---
They're being implemented in January after the holiday break.
---
to bad reality doesnt work that way.
---
Stab bonus and pray bonus are useful, plus the unlimited altar/fairy ring teleport. The obby cape is not necessarily worse, it‚Äôs just not worth the cash for most people since the bonuses are still minimal compared to other armor slots and  there are dirt cheap alternatives. That money could likely be better spent elsewhere (weapon upgrade, train range/prayer to get fire cape, etc)
---
If it werent for those meddling kids
---
Server is probably down
---
Too late 
---
I‚Äôm 65 attack at the moment. I don‚Äôt have a perfect account. Barrows gloves gives me 47 def. I should just get 70 def hahaha
---
They would have to make a new account type, like League Ironman, and change all the TL saves to be that account type. Making a new account type is definitely engine work. Probably not a huge undertaking, and something they would have done if they'd thought of it ahead of time, but it seems like corporate red tape makes it hard to get anything quickly from the engine team. They should be a lot more agile considering they have a 1 week sprint and release cycle, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This tactic will take a few runs to get the hang of but I‚Äôm more concerned with being efficient with supplies rather than time.  That‚Äôs really kind of you I should be on in a few hours.   RSN: GemKnight_Z
---
Ur arbitrary
---
No because they blow all their money on cocaine..
---
Pretty sure its Adwam =]
---
Guaca-mole-y anyone?
---
Pictures aren't going to do it justice tbh, they're huge in person
---
Definitely more interested in saving money on supplies rather than rushing and saving a bit of time so tanking and safe spotting the tunnels should be my best bet.  Base 70s is a ways off but something to shoot for during mid-game grind.
---
Yo guys,  
---
After the update today this unpolled change  [https://imgur.com/a/7FtT5M6](https://imgur.com/a/7FtT5M6)  was implemented. Because of this I buried a big bone since the tap to drop was automatically turned off when logging in. This big bone got me to level 2 prayer and ruined my hp pure account since I can no longer get 99hp at cb 25 now.
---
To put this in perspective, this hitpoints is trained at a rate of 2k xp/hr so I have been doing varrock museum cleaning for over 2200 hours. The 2 ranged was my own fuckup but this prayer level is different.   
---
I just hope this 15 prayer xp can be reset so I can be level 1pray again and continue my way to 99.  
---
TLDR: Got 2 pray because of the unpolled change today with tap to drop on mobile which ruins my acc build.
---
10 fucking hours, whoaoaa what a grind.
---
Runellite has a setting that once enabled allows you to exceed the default zoom. If memory serves right you can find it with searching "GPU"

Oh snap, OSRS music is on Spotify?

Lol, don't think you could've given a more ignorant response than this.
---
Why are you so naive??? USING THIS SUBREDDIT FOR BAN APPEALS is literally against the rules. People like you need to learn and frankly appealing on here probably lowers your chances of being unbanned from an actual appeal.

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone that offered feedback and criticism.  Learned a ton from this little thread and will take it into practice later tonight.  May the rng gods be with you all.

Waw... Some of the people in this comment section.
---
I read all of the updates and still didn't realise this one for mobile since it was not a main update, and im pretty sure there are a lot more people like me who have just read all of the main updates and focused on those. I was under the assumption that we have to vote for changes to the game.
---
It seems weird that people would accidentally lose something when they log in by dropping it, when there is a drop threshold warning for items and also wouldn't it be very obvious if you have dropped something since it will be on the floor right under you and also the inventory space you miss-clicked on is also missing?
---
It does sadden me to see the game becoming way too noob friendly and when i started the game in 2003 and onward the sense of not always being safe was actually an excitement in itself since it taught you to be careful and learn from your mistakes. This is healthy for a game and we shouldn't have to cater for these millennial mobile gamers that need p2w and easy street gameplay.
---
P.s. hope Jagex does something about this as they have re-rolled certain accounts in the past from unpolled updates. It would be great to see the consistency!
---
A child?
---
Ah the gold ole‚Äô reddit downvoting logical comments.
---
Isn't the entire inventory red when it's in drop mode? I feel like that's hard to miss. Pretty obvious when it's not in drop mode
---
Mole is just a quantity. Like 1 mole of water contain 6.022x10^23 molecules.
---
First part was me addressing his desires from this thread. The second was me addressing my desires from my post.
---
the fucks wrong with you, I said reality doesnt work that way, just because the drop raid of said item for example is 1/512 doesnt mean you are gonna get it every time you kill the monster 512 times, do you even understand how rng works?  
---
At first I thought that you need a reality check, now I think that you need a brain check as well.
---
&gt; I did not read the update
---
I'm not reading multiple pages of an update because I want to log in to chop trees on my lunch 
---
&gt; despite the warning message on login,
---
Warning message?
---
Imagine thinking anything originates from FB
---
Im sure Ill be ready at some point
---
Mate the entire inventory is red when drop mode is enabled
---
No way, mol√©

Was down for 5 seconds - better act like my life is over

I had 75 countries which is a surprise to me
---
you really got to stop with the holier than thou approach to make your argument. saying that the several people who disagree with your ideals of rng fixing "don't know fuck all" doesn't actually prove your point at all and only makes you look more like an ass than your original unpopular opinion made you look

i do have to applaud you for your dedication, successfully wasting other people's time with non-sequitur rebuttals for days now

---
&gt; Most countries, excluding the U.S., to my knowledge use periods rather than commas when dealing numbers greater than 999.
---
If you're looking purely at the number of countries, sure the decimal comma is slightly more widely used. The vast majority of the world *population* including China, India, and the United States, uses the decimal point. China and India together make up over a third of the entire world population.

much easier than i thought to mess this up. Before this update i was going back and forth with tap to drop between museum and herb runs, thinking i would be able to tell if it was red inv or not. Turns out it's easy not to notice and i buried a big bone after only 3 days.
---
Lol where is this meme from?
---
Gz on 99 hitpoints bro!
---
They do serve a purpose though.  To fill out a collection log and enhance player expression by having a follower character.  Just because *you* don't give a shit about that purpose doesn't mean that there is no purpose.  If pets served no purpose, Jagex wouldn't have bothered putting them in the game and players wouldn't bother even mentioning them existing, let alone grinding for them.
---
If you don't give a shit about them, why do you give a shit about who gets them and how those people get them?
---
How exactly does the boss score work? Is that 49.807 kills?

God of war kratos is literally half naked in the top half of the body, has godlike body and jawline lol. Funny how your main example of male vidya character is pretty sexualised. And male sexualization doesn't mesh with vidya that much because the primary demographic are males. There are fuck ton of shows targeted towards women that has heavily sexualised males(not that i care).

Staking addiction is also the cause of high boss/raids kc but rag gear

Its for all intents and purposes a pvm only technique called prayer flicking in most cases, though fighting Jad it's really more of an active toggle if you go into it properly

They even put out a statement that it was something they were experimenting with. Guy's just a pud.
---
Y'all gonna stereotype us elitists even harder than y'all already do for this comment, but it's not always difficult to RWT. When I sold 4b and quit after being hacked for the 2b in my inventory (they couldn't get into my bank), I was it through a private plug. It was extremely easy to find, because the entirety of the HLC RWT's out the fucking ass lol. If you sell to a level 126 main, you're not gonna get caught.
---
But then again, my account definitely looked like a legitimate player so maybe that had something to do with it. There's also the fact that a lot of my friends have Zulrah alts so you can't just look at an account's stats and assume it's a bot. Personally, I'd support banning alts for other reasons but that's another discussion.
---
I mean the Jagex staff mods. Specifically I'm curious to know if there is a story behind Mod Nasty's name

Use them up then drop trade them to main for bonds or just keep them in the bank. Not worth alching them

kid you not on the only iron dragon task I've ever done I got a d spear (no ring of wealth). I didn't realize how rare it was otherwise I'd have taken a picture.

I freakin‚Äô hate mobile. I try to stay away from it unless I am stuck at the airport without my laptop or something. I‚Äôve also never had a problem with toggling between the tap options.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I‚Äôm very glad we have mobile as an option; it is just not for me.
---
Thank you, I am quite uninformed in some parts of the game including combat gear. This is very helpful.
---
link not working
---
That‚Äôd be cool if they removed quest skill requirements but still required you do quests in their own quest line order. Imagine the competition to be the lowest level with barrows gloves lol
---
Made me think of Redwall
---
People probably just stopped bothering to claim their points after they hit 5k.
---
I‚Äôd vote for it
---
If they dump it 100m at a time I could see it, jagex even said themselves they don‚Äôt care about low trades until they‚Äôre in the billions
---
I remember the wizards tower with the caged lesser demon in it that everybody would wind strike. Some people would get the drop but wouldnt have the level for telegrab, so theyd shout it out and everybody with telegrab would be waiting to nab the drop when it spawned. what a rush.

You‚Äôre a beast, OP! Glad everything turned out well! Stay strong.

Every couple of days I‚Äôd look back at the post to see if there was an update, glad you made it.

so he enjoys the game and his life circumstances allow him to play that much, how is that a serious issue lol

Damn dude nice, almost lost all your items.

If you aren‚Äôt doing them already, herb runs and bird houses can help offset the costs by a lot. Even with lower levels you could easily get an extra 8-10 ppots/hour.
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Ash, Oasis, Sween, Bruno, JD (Chat).
---
2.  Mobile connectivity issues.
---
  *  Thank you for baring with us. Our Sys-admin team made a change to help with that, so far it looks ok and they are investigating. 
---
3.  Game update: Imp shop and Mage training arena
---
  *  Looks good, see newspost.
---
4. [IMAGE] Points thresholds for each rank on Twisted Leagues
---
  *  9,900 --- 6,520 --- 3,440 --- 1,570 --- 540 --- 100 --- 10
---
5. [IMAGE] Artwork from 7th Sleeper, Twisted League Pyromancer outfit.
---
  *  Looks cool!
---
6. New stuff in the merch store
---
  *  Couple of shirts etc. Check them out.
---
7. Twitch Prime membership thing ends Dec 10
---
  *  Move quick if you haven't and check it out.
---
8. Check out Nightmare of Ashihama reward changes/tweaks. 
---
  *  Blog post and BETA worlds. Check them out and send through feedback.
---
9. Why is the Q&amp;A today and why is next week's game update on Wednesday?
---
  *  Christmas season scheduling! 
---
10. Next week's game update sees Christmas event.
---
  *  Look forward to it!
---
11. Sneak Peek at Christmas update varrock
---
  *  Mod Oasis talks a little about the event and developing it.
---
12. Can we get a 'Clear History' feature for the game notifications log like with private chat?
---
  *  Sure, poll it next poll
---
13. Can we get a taxidermy outside of Morytania for skillers to stuff and mount fish?
---
  *  Don't see why not, the lore isn't particularly set there.
---
14. How are you feeling on a Monthly behind the scenes blog post?
---
  *  Funny you should say that, from next week we'll aim to bring back monthly blogs. We regret not talking about leagues as much before it came, there's a leagues retrospective coming out and that will include how we might improve future leagues.
---
15. Boss KC Hiscores, some link to Twisted Leagues points highscores?
---
  *  It's a bug! We'll be getting those fixed
---
16. Why aren't I on boss KC hiscores?
---
  *  It was system overload on launch, so log in and out and it should update. Keep us informed and these will get worked out.
---
17. Any update on mobile features; Reducing chat clickbox and changing duration of long-press?
---
  *  There is a design for the click-box thing, this would involve putting a button on that. This should help... Changing long-tap or double-tap inputs requires engine team to change how the game interprets those and at this stage we can't offer that in the immediate future sorry.
---
18. Why did you remove the claim points button on Twisted Leagues? I liked looking at the bar increase and seeing how many points I earned that session when I was about to log off.
---
  *  The main issue was that people might forget to claim them or didn't claim them at all. Automatic claiming was to help avoid these rewards not being sent to the main-game at the end of leagues.
---
19. Could Tithe Farm instances be limited to 2 players rather than 3? There's not enough room for 3.
---
  *  Yes that's a change we'd like to see. Afraid that it likely won't fit into the next weeks update and that's the last update of the year (and Leagues ends in January anyway).
---
20. Since the Abyssal Sire changes were received well, would you look to change Grotesque Guardians?
---
  *  Yes we want to change those and look to maybe add into the next QoL poll. Something we'd like to but need to consider where to fit it in.
---
21. Could you stop Trouver Parchments be changed so that they can't be used on an imbued untradeable in PVP under 20 Wilderness, you should only be losing the parchment imbue over 20 Wilderness.
---
  *  The blog stated this and while that's the case, we can certainly change it.
---
22. Any word on how often Leagues will take place?
---
  *  Don't know at this stage, we are pleasantly surprised at the popularity of this and are keen to offer it again but don't want to overload you with leagues. They also take up a fair bit of dev-time so it won't be anywhere near as frequent as DMM. Should we decide on that next time you'll hear about it ahead of time. 
---
23. Could we get a feature added to polling to explain why we voted no with options such as 'Just don't feel it belongs in OSRS'?
---
 * We did try this with a PVP poll a while back. Assuming this is possible to add, we can't trawl through a lot of text and responses. We could instead look at surveying a group of players after the poll.
---
24. If Ash is about, could you get him to talk about the technical side of restoring the OSRS backup?
---
  *  Yes! It was Feb 2013 and there was some concerns that if we let the community split into two with the main-game and others moving to the OSRS version... that could lead to 2 smaller communities that might dwindle off rather than one large that could grow. In the end MMG and Mod Pips agreed that it was worth trying so we started looking for a backup that we had (no version control back then). Not many backups and eventually found this version from August 2007. Things did need fixing like the chat system that points to external system that no longer exist and so on, display names etc. Needed to have various bits of it re-written to work in modern structure too. Mod Philip? worked very odd hours to get it done and everyone worked hard during Feb to get it working. Blocked out various bits of content that we couldn't re-write in time (Slug menace, Barbarian Assault, Construction, Penguin/Zanik) and slowly released those.
---
25. Could we see a group ironman BETA during a league to test GIM?
---
  *  Maybe? Hope to keep Group Ironman release hype. Feel it might be best to keep them seperate. Would also require a fair bit of work to make League work with GIM. Would also want to keep League as competitions so wouldn't really want to mix that with a BETA.
---
26. Can the compass on the minimap include a long-click or right-click look south etc?
---
  *  Yeah it's in the backlog!
---
27. Could we have trackers on leagues tasks (library books etc).
---
  *  Like that very much! Wouldn't be able to do it for this league since next week is the last update of the year.
---
28. In Leagues, there's an auto-insure feature. Could this be brought to the main-game for a huge amount of coins like 20-50m to insure all future pets (this would still require GP to reclaim?).
---
  *  Last time this was discussed on social media with players, there was some objections to making it easier and taking away the requirement to leave the area safely without losing the pet.
---
29. Onyx's and Chaos runes have crashed since the Song of The Elves update. Profitability from things like Zulrah is effected. Will the team look at tweaking Zulcano drop table to remove those?
---
  *  Haven't heard of plans to change it, will talk to the devs that made that one. 
---
30. Some storage systems like the Seed vault don't feel/act like normal banks and can't remove multiple items on the same game tick. Can they be changed when depositing and withdrawing items?
---
  *  Will look into it, the CoX bank thing has different code as it can sometimes allow things to be rearranged or otherwise. Three devs have looked at this to change it and have not been able to do so but will look at it again. The seed vault; no idea since it doesn't do anything dynamic that might be able to just get fixed.
---
31. Can the Sarrachnis timer be changed to 10 seconds from 30?
---
  *  Yeah. Definitely can and it seems to be something people want. Apparently Husky wanted it to be a short timer but it wasn't changed before release so be happy to look at it.
---
32. Is there a way to stop tabs closing in mobile when opening a new one?
---
  *  Maybe? Would need to rewrite a fair bit of the game-frame code that works on showing only one at the same time. Would then expect that on desktop?
---
33. What will the fate of Twisted league rewards be? Will they be tradeable rares?
---
  *  Only trophies are untradeable. We expect a blog on Trophies soon, we had not considered whether or not they'd become effectively discontinued and whether they'd be different between leagues. We fail to agree on what the best approach may be so we're going to talk about this in the next blog and will open up for feedback on this.
---
34. Can you make deposit boxes have the same interface as mobile (so we have deposit all, deposit X etc.)
---
  *  We can in the future.
---
35. Looting bags have been locked behind Bounty Hunter 2. A lot of PVMers and PKers can't get it as they used to, can we get the option to buy it back like with BH1? 
---
  *  We can, before then it was dropped by Wilderness creatures. Since then the drop rate has been buffed for creatures with combat higher than level 10, you might find a improvement before we consider an update like what you are asking for.
---
36. Is it safe to say there will be no changes to Twisted League this season?
---
  *  Yeah that could be said - next week is the last update of the year. The next thing would be making the reward shop in Jan!
---
37. Is it possible to roll-out small changes to clans as they are made available rather than 1 large game update?
---
  *  The main thing is the clan grouping system which needs to exist in any case and can't be half-rolled out. The smaller features that follow could be released incrementally like that but players don't always respond well to phased rollouts (which we've also tried to avoid on OSRS) so we'll try to release it as a full update when it's ready. 
---
38. When will you next release disc of returning and half-wines?
---
  *  The midsummer events were last in 2017 and stopped due to these temporary things taking a fair bit of dev time for what they are. We can do something else with them - bundle them into easter/halloween or in the Birthday event. Probably the birthday event.
---
39. Could we get clan-banks added to the game with the clan system?
---
  *  Is that needed? Not really? Could be opening a can of worms with that. Players in Group Ironman would expect some form of shared storage which is essentially the same thing. Realistically there will be some restrictions like only one world can log in at the one time. If we get it going for GIM then there's no reason why we can't offer it for clans.
---
40. Wilderness bosses used to have a high chance of dropping emblems on BH worlds which added incentive. That was removed and nothing replaced it so now there's no incentive to kill Wildy bosses on BH worlds.
---
  *  To be honest, not fond of the bosses in question and if we were to do buffs or changes we'd hope to properly address them and fix their mechanics. 
---
41. Any plans for Raids 3?
---
  *  Lots of ideas floating around, not in immediate plans or decided anything further. Raids usually takes like 5-6 months to develop and we made two within 18 months so we should be working on something else for a bit! 
---
42. Level 3 skillers used to be able to buy emblems and looting bags etc, this has created unique accounts. Could this be changed?
---
  *  Yes presumably if we make it available elsewhere, totally!
---
43. At RuneFest Mod Ash spoke about banking options, any update or thoughts on that?
---
  *  That was on poll 69 and passed, most of the dev-work is done so expect to see it in January!
---
44. When is group Ironman coming out?
---
  *  Can't say. Clan system needs to exist first and we don't have an ETA on that either which is reliant on an external team (engine). We hope to bring that to you as soon as we can. 
---
45. When is the Nightmare going to be released?
---
  *  Early next year, can't commit to something more exact sorry.
---
46. Any requirements for Nightmare?
---
  *  Not really, just have a good account and do Priest in Peril.
---
47. Ironmen won't be able to do the Nightmare? 
---
  *  Yes. Though normal accounts can do it with other normal accounts (one portal) and Ironmen will either have to solo or do it with other ironmen (another portal).
---

Rune went from 3410 two weeks ago, to 5400 last week, and now 6510. Its slowing down really fast and it's not like this week was some anomaly where ranks shot up super fast because of this change. Obviously it didnt have much effect. You are making excuses for yourself falling behind and just need to get over that you may not get the trophy you want.
---
Chief, glad to see you in good spirits. may you continue to thrive with the gains both IRL and in game.
---
Oh god. My only Niece is like, still a kid. Auto-correct makin me look all pedo.
---
I like how you didn't give me an actual reason and poked fun at the part that was most irrelevant to the topic of discussion. Also, keep in mind that us elitists account share and borrow our friends' accounts while they're quitting and whatnot as high-end alts. Another good bunch buy accounts. We also brutally skewed (yes, I'm calling bs on Jigglyplex's claim on stream) the living fuck outta the warding poll.
---
If anyone abuses alts the hardest, it's us. This is about game integrity, not what I want. This is why I don't like coming to this subreddit though. I feel like people just instantly flame others they disagree with and don't ever wanna explain why they feel that the other is wrong.
---
I personally think that the challenge should be on the content itself. If you want more interaction, they should release more interactive content, not make alts such an overpowering meta that people feel obliged to use them. I think we can all agree that some integrity issues came with alts such as voting on polls and whatnot.
---
Well nobody was asking that question as it is trimmed
---
Lmfaoooooooo wuu2

There are a lot of ... suspect accounts high up on several of the categories.

 #1 Chambers of Xeric KC has just shy of 10000 CoX runs but somehow never managed to get 90 herblore to make his own overloads? Never mind the fact that at 30 minutes per raid he's spent at least 4900 hours purely inside CoX.

Try again to make any meaningful explanation of the difference between a mole and an avogadro's number of something. A mole is a number of things.

Did it happen after tying your acc to email via osrs settings so that you could play on PC?
---
I remember having similar troubles with my alt that was created on mobile. If that's the case then untag the email in acc settings on osrs webpage.

Proud of you m8

Hmmm. Maybe. Cus I have a friend who's always claimed to have a really high kc at a particular boss and should be top 10 but isn't on the list. I was starting to wonder if they lied all this time but I see no.reason why they would have. This makes sense and I'm also curious of the answer
---
Could be server overloaded updating boss scores, just a theory.
---
Some of them are required for other quests and others give good gear.
---
My bad, I meant to say HP cape.
---
You are doing startup and research in your condition? Feel free to just chill and heal for a bit. Jk #noxpwaste

Brb studying

Yeah it's really great how it's an ugly generic brown menu now instead of a unique and otherworldly looking menu.
---
Oh, he snitching!

funny guy, free with a jamflex coupon code

Fuck... I have urge to get it...  trade you my 13 trouts for it? I must get it to put it on my wall so I could educate noobies that come over my home  once they ask me, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù then I explain all the osrs story including untrimmed and trimmed capes symbols and fally massacre.....maybe I should leave fally massacre part left out so it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the noob.

Bet the police love you.

My ironman has 96 banked so idk what you want from me

Next best thing is to actually read before accepting i guess

I mean it doesn‚Äôt prove anything by itself. Could just be random screenshots, but definitely worth looking into if these accounts haven‚Äôt already been banned.
---
Also snitches get stitches  you lil bitch
---
Why did you post this though lmao. Rendi sells capes and nobody cares, this is even less. Report it to jagex ya snitch lmao
---
Nice Freudian slip
---
People believe they have a limited amount of luck and don't want to waste it on things they don't need. The same people also believe that the chances of winning the lottery increase the more times you lose. They also believe saying some shit to their screen is going to influence the codes in servers hundreds of miles away.
---
Is it really you? If so I‚Äôm a huge fan
---
Don't let Mudkip see this.
---
Congratulations on your victory King
---
Boooo *in Patrick stars voice*
---
It's more of a cheat sheet than an actual guide, I probably should have specified in the title
---
No I mean I know what I'm talking about when I say uim herblore isn't that much slower than reg iron herblore
---
Guys I found Randall Weems!
---
I bookmarked your reddit account and checked pretty much every day to see if you'd posted  
---
happy you made it :)
---
If you are rank 1 I'll assume you're correct I just didn't feel like back tracking tbh.
---
I think it‚Äôs all just being updated in increments as opposed to all at once
---
200k a kill on average lmao
---
seren halo ruins it
---
Not just viable but easy
---
I may be crazy but I can only get 4 tbow shots off on zulrahs first phase and on the following Melee phase.  So I try to do 2 blowpipe into 4 tbow on phase 1 (which theoretically should mean I can get 5 tbow shots but I can‚Äôt) and then on phase 2 Melee I do 2 tbow 1 bp 1 tbow to try to maximize dps.
---
&gt;Who‚Äôs going to spend 1,950 points on slayer rings? 
---
well, apparently you are XD
---
I want to get void then upgrade to elite but I'm not quite at 100 combat currently 97. Should I do the intermediate boat now or wait until I get 100 and grind it out then?
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Should we tell him splashing there doesn‚Äôt work anymore..
---
And your comment is a prime example of, thats your problem then huh
---
You do the same prayer switching/flicking but also a whole host of other things on top of it. Go check out an araxxor guide from "RS Guy"
---
Where did they say this?
---
I got a D Med and a Whip b2b on my last task. All my RNG is completely gone.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know this üòÇ I‚Äôve been here for 6 hours RIP
---
damn fair enough. Feel like the sara halo doesn't fit and seren is the closest to what I want. Any suggestions?
---
its still alot more afk than 90% of skills and has far more xp than most skills for how afk it is, OP is simply complaining for nothing, aint that hard, dont do it if you dont want to
---
Check RoW boss count
---
88% isn't 881 loot potential though, it's quite a bit higher. 
---
You want 86.9% iirc
---
i am an RN in a cardiac icu that takes cares of adults after open heart surgery; such as CABGs. Fantastic to see you extubated and weaned to room air after going through all that. 
---
On the other side of the spectrum, when my patients and their families don't do well due to complications from surgery, OSRS helps me chill out and relax after a tough day at work.  
---
still not as bad as runecrafting though
---
Das macht mich angepisst
---
Not working on my Galaxy S10e nor my iPad mini
---
At 881/1012 loot potential you can receive bolt racks, which are worth significantly less than the runes you would otherwise get at 880 and below. 
---
Therefore you want to stay under 880/1012 which is ~86.9%, though I think Runelite's rounding may show a different number
---
That's fair
---
Gz
---
Can't play on mobile. Samsung A20
---
Hahah you came at the right time, nothing but moles in this sub rn
---
weird flex
---
~~To be honest I didn't think anyone would take my original comment seriously but all well here we are~~
---
edit: uhh I mean this guy is also in on it
---
I think you should switch some of your gear into prayer gear

just go to the timeframe shown in the link
---
You clearly dont speak it.
---
Yes
---
If you look at the wiki code it includes the uniques into the average loot per kill.
---
All at the same time üò≥üò≥üò≥Ôºü
---
U can‚Äôt log in on the site because it‚Äôs made on Game Center!! This is soo frustrating
---
Now you can keep it somewhere other than your keychain
---
some of the most popular british streamers/youtubers did a charity stream and played osrs as a part of it
---
This is innovation
---
Gratz bro!!! You must be one happy dude :)
---
runescape is some fine wine
---
The best sort!
---
Same for me. Works for my friend though so it seems to vary.
---
Mine worked this morning but now it‚Äôs down again like last night wtf
---
They're all missing their obby capes
---
Keep AFK fishing sharks at work all the way to 99, get 85 attack, level to 99 defence through Slayer, 83 Construction and a few other bits and bobs. :)
---
learn spawn rotations (there are 15 in total) so you dont have to improvise lure on 1 def.

Yes, this is exactly the same experience I've had with the mobile account! Since the servers treat emails as strings instead of unique identifiers, you can have several account linked to a single email. And if you create an account with mobile, there is some weird woodoo stuff that can alter the default mail that is used. Maybe, you were logged out of google account back then when the issue manifested or sth.  
---
Glad to hear that your issue is partially resolved!  
---
Personally, I'd suggest you stick to logging via runescape account to avoid similar issues.
