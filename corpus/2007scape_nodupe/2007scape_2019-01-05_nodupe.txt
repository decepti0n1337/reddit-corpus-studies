It's worth getting BGS at some point if you plan on doing Corp eventually, but otherwise, I don't really see the point in post bcp and tasset grind at Graardor.

i think it's pretty obvious by the wording you're trying to "greentext"
---
uh oh!
---
yea bro
---
5k deaths atm. Am I a bad person? 
---
They don’t.  I’m too high to explain but just look up how combat level is determined.  Like he said he has to have a combined 148 attack+strength to gain a combat level from leveling either in this case.  That could be 75/73 or 49/99.  
---
you probably are pretty ugly if you're insecure enough to make a post like this and then get defensive about it
---
He's 99 ranged so he's ranged based. 
---
Man play the game before commenting about it 
---
Didn't Mod Lottie post an update recently? 
---
As a hardcore d3 player, i made the switch. Fuck having to progress through the AH because you needed to overgear yourself. Fuck dcs killing you. 
---
Not technically a gold sink because the gold doesn't leave the game. But it does consume the scroll. 
---
yeah if you cant steal from someone without a talk option, turn on the auto long click thing so that when you tap it brings up the menu right away
---
U think it’s smart to sell out on dhcb now before it drops again
---
Someone’s estrogen pills threw off their testosterone levels
---
okay do you REALLY need 6 differently colored types of rune armor to enjoy the game? Is it REALLY necessary to be able to stuff every single purposeless item into a bank for "fashionscape"?

Im a new player (playing the free mode but really want to get a membership) and i already did the cook quest(eggs, milk, flour) and got the ghost neck and all, but all my gear is so trash. Do i need to go and do more quest (finish the ghost one and the bring the amulet to magic tower) or do i need to lvl my skills more? Is there a place where i can learn what i should do? Thnks for your time
---
Slightly unrelated but I’m more okay with someone crashing if most of the worlds are crowded than i am if they openly admit to being too lazy to try and hop

Why does a large proportion of Serene's comments use retarded sentences to destroy his reputation within /r/2007scape by plastering them all over the subreddit? Is he trying to establish that he isn't taking himself seriously or what?

anyone who plays ironman is gonna want unique/rare items thats the whole point of the mode. getting cool/rare stuff without trading is the appeal dude.

An American TV show that airs on "Tru TV" called "Impractical Jokers" features Sal as well as 3 of his friends. Episodes consist of them essentially daring one another to do social pranks such as [having one of them dress as an IKEA floor employee and trying to sell furniture to customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3eF3PzMeew).
---
The picture itself is an older picture of Sal when he was much bigger and the "tonight's big loser" is from the end of show recap.

Gz on 81 range friend!
---
or... you and your friend set this up so you could take a picture and get karma
---
Because there are updates that are way more useful than increasing bank space for some ironman accounts. A normal account should be nowhere near the limit, and there are probably only a dozen very late game irons that actually benefit from more space.
---
&gt; losing your mental functions
---
Speaking of.
---
I don't understand lol, you get adamant gloves from barrows too?
---
Getting dust from cm raids is my big goal atm. Just got the money for inferno gear too so may give that a shot when I have the time 
---
I can imagine it creating a new Mordekaiser bug
---
I'm convinced Valve is just a massive server room with Gaben sitting in the middle with a fridge full of beer eating sugary cereal and pizza all day. 
---
 You don’t get barrows gloves from barrows you get them finishing recipe for disaster same for bronze-dragon gloves 
---
I’m surprised theirs no heat at barrows!
---
Yaaaas. The OG way. Don’t miss it. 
---
/u/JagexLottie pls
---
Yep. Also one of my most hated aspects of rs3 is the cosmetic override bullshit, and I know I'm not alone there. I'd quit in a heartbeat if either of those suggestions were implemented

wtf...

Well it's a competitive job market out there

If you have the lunar spell book and high enough magic level you can turn flax into bowstrings with the bowstring spell. Profits and you get dual exp.

Yesterday I ate an edible (dont normally) and lost 2m to a scam and didn’t even realize it until an hour later

Absolutely. It's going to be spamming at a very consistent rate far too often. Don't do this ever.
---
Post your account you turd. This dude's not close to max if he believes people only handle 4 doses in a bank. 
---
Thanks yea, realizing how slow slayer is haha
---
A lot of people do that to 100+ combat people with a 99 in a stat. 
---
Yeah man
---
You’re probably right. 
---
Ty lol. Just don't copy the gear tab, I was still working on it when I took the screenshots. 
---
That’s fucking impressive. You know you can never train combat again right?
---
my friend told me you did.. im kinda new lol.. well fuck i wasted a lot of time haha, anyways thx.

Lol moron

No problem

Music sounds like one of those royalty free ripoffs

Not combat related, but picking up ashes off the floor at GE is the fastest moneymaker for a fresh account for starter GP.
---
nice
---
The only skill I have remotely close to 99 is Agility, which 90. :)
---
then dont limit yourself with ironman??
---

---
To those of you downvoting, why don't you explain, so i can do better?

drinking/blazing heavy and playing can be dangerous. Almost died on a slayer task and had to just log off in a panic sweat
---
He should walk in pvp for skull tricking
---
The game was converted for mobile that can do everything PC can, and you want to have them add mobile only content? Are you stupid? 
---
Pretty good but I'd recommend morytania hard, the requirements don't take too long compared to others
---
Yeah, there's like a dozen of these every day
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UronN9WUX18&amp;feature=youtu.be

It's still good xp. You won't get as much xp or profit as much,  but it's good still.  I'd still just do slayer and extend them and do them as you get them. 
---
Yeah working on that just need the agility and I think prayer 
---
Forget running out of the maze. I just tele back to the barrows entrance. House tele is for the return trip from GE
---
Yes it is. Lost all my gear to a hacker. Saving up for some real stuff
---
the colors hurt my eyes
---
Ooooof
---
untrimmed agility cape.
---
You're rude, aggressive, and man toward everyone in this thread. None of us have sympathy for you. 
---
Absolutely.  It's kind of counterintuitive since getting crashed in an overcrowded area is a lot more of a pain in the ass; like if someone ruins your dust devil spot, that's gonna be a lot of hopping trying to find another.  
---
But it actually makes me rage way harder when someone crashes me at like steel dragons or akous or some shit.  It's only gonna take me 10 seconds to hop to a new empty world, but I just VICIOUSLY hate the guy for it because it's so ridiculously lazy and inconsiderate.  At least if someone crashes your devils or nechs or some shit, it's likely they have an actual reason for it.  They're probably just fed up hopping around and decided fuck it, I'm sick of wasting time.  They're still a dick, but at least there's a reason.  If you crash somebody at ankous you're just a fucking scumbag asshole.
---
S P A G H E T T I C O D E
---
This is probably the best solution. The people most impacted are late game ironmen, including myself, and incomplete sets take up ~50 bank spaces
---
i'm honestly amazed af to see this, weirdest rng run i've had so far
---
Except if you tele to your house you don't need to use supplies so you never need to bank till you run out of scales in your bp and trident
---
I think you underestimate the amount of useless fire lighters in game

---
Ppl probably bought her max too lol
---
Gotcha. Yeah they’ve freaking skyrocketed in price...
---
Yes, in fact they knowingly have access to more parts of users accounts through several more methods than anyone not closely affiliated with the company. It is INCREDIBLY unlikely that a hacker would have taken full control of my account being that I used no third party system, hardly any interaction with other players that I didn't already know in real life, and my password had already been reset to a stronger one since the account was in use. ALSO, there was about a 30 minute window of opportunity for the hacker to steal my coins BEFORE my account was randomly seized BY JAGEX for no reason and STILL with no explanation. If it was explained that something I was doing in game was against policy, I would understand but that has not happened yet. MAYBE it wasn't a moderator and more so an administrator or perhaps a developer, SOMEONE with the ability to Ninja swipe my account while making it look like an accident to such an intense degree of accuracy that it strikes me as malicious activity by Jagex themselves.
---
Then just post it with his username lol. Saying you hate to be a snitch is dumb when that’s exactly what you’re doing. You don’t hate being a snitch, you’re getting a kick out of it. 
---
Did you just repost this? Lol. Pretty sure most people know about this safe spot for low lvl theiving :p prob not gona get a zillion upvotes 
---
You only post this so that you can get all of the gp and xp for yourself
---
i dont respect you
---
Lmao what a great way to troll someone
---
i had one for staking way in the beginning of osrs it was dope
---
I like to roleplay as Gertrude trying to fetch a strapping adventurer one day.

Why would he do it if he thinks it’s boring lol
---
Bury your face in a jar of dirt 
---
i thought u had to put the 3 totem pieces together before you could get another part as a drop
---
&gt;really boring 
---
i also have 5 black tourm cores and a granite hammer from guardians in like 310ish kc lol
---
I’m just salty lol
---
I wonder if you'll like it once new content like Kebos is only found on the new wiki and not the old one

Wow all 3 people? Well if you payed attention, I only was rude to you assholes who made the assumption that I was BOTTING to get to a low level for some ridiculous reason. The fellow who kinda believed me was spared.
---
Happy cake day bot
---
Ty
---
Shut up
---
easy, mute all chat in this area on busy worlds, especially low level accounts. easy, dont give me the shit that its hard... same with they are trying to get rid of RWT, thats complete crap, we have had jagex employees sell us gold before and most are still selling us it, some of these guys know us personally now. just remember in this world no body is perfect ;) winky
---
You can drop one and get another same totem piece

Haha the fact that his helmet wings go down when he’s sad is great.

If you're at the point where you're using a looting bag as an external bank I think it's time to alch the slayer tab and deep clean the last 2 screenies which are mostly junk

My gosh

Are you an iron? Just buy a tier 7 if not

Double the kc I got mine at. Unlucky mate.

WCGW if I insult the god of runescape in their own sub
---
ohhh ok ty!
---
Thanks!
---
I am not. Sadly I just made this account and have no GP on osrs :( if I had 1.5m I'd do it
---
If you kill two monsters at the exact same time and they roll the totem drop, you can get two of the same piece
---
You cant hate it too much or you wouldnt do it
---
Poor guy whoever lost that account. When I got hacked back in rs2 my bank got robbed but I at least still had my account lmao.
---
I literally put off doing this quest for 2 months because it looked so boring. Did it last night and absolutely hated it lol. 
---
Gw2 was such a disappointment for anyone who played gw1.
---
Great game for people who just want something a little new from wow, though.

Shoulda made an edit to make it actually appear in the inv 😁

Fucking loser

Just finished the Agility grind tonight! Need to finish Rum Deal, Cabin Fever, and start Great Brain Robbery and I can go live in Barrows

They've died, not banned.

They only take like 3 minutes to do, just gotta take the sub 1k loots in with that thought.

Wow I just came over from RS3 and I thought the 800 was a lot 
---
You sure were triggered Mr too important to dish out sympathy ass

Or e-dated $$$

delete this post (and yourself)
---
Man, you have the patience I wish I had! I'd like to go for a cape one day, but agility will most definitely not be it! good luck tho!

Meta

This is a good point.  The trouble is that at this point I'm not sure it's ever going to be possible to convince developers that MTX is a bad idea.  It just seems so obscenely profitable due to the shitty human brain and the way that the average person thinks and behaves.  For every MTX game that fails, I'm sure it could feasibly be blamed on all kinds of other shit that was probably wrong with the game.  In fact I would guess that most developers already understand that MTX is, to at least SOME degree, never a healthy thing to have in your game.  But I'd also guess that they can generally really obviously discern the fact that the profit from it far outweighs the drawback.  So it might not matter anyway in the end.
---
Like, as far as I understand it, isn't RS3 a pretty perfect example of what I'm getting at here?  You've got a game that has ALL KINDS of shit wrong with it, from bad design to outdated systems and graphics to ancient age to whatever, and then also MTX.  If and when it goes under, do we really think they'd hold the MTX responsible for that, even at all?  As I understand it, it still makes them a significant proportion of their profits even though it's essentially already dead, purely because of the ridiculous profitability of MTX.
---
Good luck with elites! I'm trying to finish all hard diaries and it's been quite a grind!

Where do I go to get this runelite plugin?
---
I see a lot of it go into general stores
---
Nope. No default option. Pick 1 or 2 every time. Takes you 0.5 IQ to know what you have in each bank. Takes you zero more seconds to click "bank 1" or "bank 2" than it currently does to click "bank". Maybe fill bank 1 with Skilling stuff. Bank 2 with combat. Idc, up to you. Want to switch stuff between bank 1 and bank 2? Well you can do it 28 items at a time by putting 28 things in your inventory, closing one bank, opening the other, and depositing them. Sound like too much of a hassle? Okay then just use one bank and stick with 800 spaces, idc, they're your banks do what you want. 
---

Mory hard is 100% a luck crapshoot for barrows. Literally did 40 runs the other night and every single chest was less than 20k, hell, some chests didn’t even cover the cost of my supplies for that specific run. I had way better luck before I got mory hard. I’m convinced it made the drops worse.
---
Reminds me of that time I went into the Wilderness wearing a mithril armour set, carrying black armour, a diamond and all my money, and had no weapons or runes.

yes pls

I use 2 p pots, 2 sips per kill with bp dwh 3 to 4 kills a trip with sharks. Only dip into last 2 sips if I leave pray on during poison or freeze phase or make it to forth kill

What actually was the point of implementing the 1000 total requirement to be permanent ironman?
---
Do what i said, spend 10m on gear then start on 99 untrimmed 99 prayer in the mean time
---
You're not doing a nose taps and mobile only ultimate iron man?
---
Looks like it sonce he said he has 110m
---
Yes, I’d like to sign up for the 10:15pm slot to kill that monster you’re killing.
---
You could apply pretty much all this logic to the opposite argument too.  I want to use this world to afk, more mobs aggrod at one time = longer time I can not pay attention.  You're flipping out acting entitled to the spawns that you can safespot, but what makes you any more entitled than the guy who wants to make use of the whole room to afk?
---
In fairness, I go to the bloodvelds near the fire giants as they seem less popular and I don't think they are as easily safe spotted.  It's a bit funny too how you say you use the bloodvelds task as a break so you can eat or watch something too.  What do you think people who pull the whole room are doing? Focussing intently?
---
Give all players a billion gold
---
Hey there! Glad to see that you know nothing about economics. I’d recommend that you take a look at Microeconomics and work your way to Macroeconomics as I think that’d be the best course of action for you. I will now proceed to give you a billion downvotes.

Yeah, an "old debt" my ass

Check your account on the website to see if you have any offences before paying attention  to any email. This is likely fake.

Why did he get downvoted? It’s fucking weird

No its fake

It's loaded into runelite by default, you just have to enable it

Probably because he got rid of a lot after maxing skills...

I agree with OP. I wish death on RS3 players as well my friend

But I was there two days ago on my main, now I need it on my Ironman

Probably because she started playing RS after EoC was a thing, so she never got to experience pre-eoc.

How much is gargoyles nowadays? Is G maul een worth anything?
---
Matters what you are training and how you are training it. If you dont mind clicking every 30 secs, then do hard for all of them. If you want to do afk, then do normal with magic and range. For melee you will need guthans to go super afk.

This would NEVER happen in our NOOB worlds, guys.

I did actually but I had no idea what to call it. I search NPC options etc. Thanks for being an ass but also answering the question.

Is there anywhere I can watch videos of the whole streams where people did DS2 on release and streamed it on Twitch (people such as b0aty)? I can only find youtube videos with tiny fragments of clips of the streams, not entire stream vods.

Sorry for the bad quality, guys. Computer can't screen cap for whatever reason and my camera is crap lol

I agree. Was super hyped when GW2 was coming out. After years of playing the shit out of GW1, I got completely let down.

Thank you

you can't forget out sponsor IRONSIDE

All of that NoFap making you irritated?

It’s a 3rd party client that runs Runescape but it has plugins that make the game so much easier for you. It would take me a long time to explain, YouTube it! But make sure you download it from the right website!

You need a rune full helm (h). Buy off the GE, it comes from treasure trails. The house made one is a completely different item

I had a quest cape pre-eoc, so I've already done almost every quest at LEAST once before. The newest ones I still like to follow along

Email address are relatively easy to spoof, never trust an email just because it says "@jagex.com" at the end. Likewise, never use links from such emails, rather, log into RuneScape from the homepage and check the message centre there, which will have a copy of the message were it real.
---
This goes for any service, you get an email or call from your bank, you should call the bank at their official number to inquire about the validity of the contact, regardless of how official the call or email seems, since they're far too easy to spoof.

Getting Zulrah down. I'm on the lower end of the magic and ranged requirements, but having good gear helps and learning the rotations with a budget setup will make me more effecient when I have better gear.

I have no clue what the hell is going on

I had to bank, get something to eat,  mow, and go to work.  I’ve been here all day!

Only 1/128 buddy

That's actually what's freaking me out. I've never entered into anything Runescape related that wasn't the game itself. I don't know where they got this information. And it only started happening after I bought a bond. I'm wondering if they have my bank info and credit number too.

Getting matches is easy af

The quest is a slasher movie lol

260 hours at 50k/hr, so less than a year

That's actually not to bad..

Great job! Once you get the first one out of the way you can start doing Jad for Slayer tasks..my favorite tasks by far!

Pet chance, additional cape, and tons of xp!

Thank you very much dude!

I legit thought of that first
---
It was my wiki back in the day

Stop being stupid

u mine and chisel blocks into bloods so its free bloods all the way. It's like 40k exp/hr and maybe 500k/hr profit? Very tolerable. One of the most afk skills honestly.

Grim Tales, the Fremmenik quests, Dragon Slayer 2, and Garden of Tranquility are all quite enjoyable imo. Quest cape was a really fun early goal on my iron.

I'm coming back from a long hiatus (left at about the time Raids and silver jewelry came out), so I need to get my quest cape back. Then I want to get 99 Slayer (so I can learn to actually boss/do raids/meaningfully engage with high level PvM content) and eventually get the Achievement Diary cape.
---
I still hold out hope for the Runecrafting pet, too, and grind out RC on occasion, but I don't know how committed I am to that one. Hoped I'd get it on the way to 99 and didn't.
---
Sounds good bro how big is your cock 
---
Group ironman's been vaguely "in the works" for a while now but don't expect it anytime soon. I'd say your best bet would be to just play individual ironmen and just train/quest everything together. Either that or your could make normal accounts and just play by group ironman rules, although that requires discipline that I don't possess.
---
460k is a pretty damn nice reward my man
---
I recognize the reference
---
If I cared enough to report someone who admits outside of the game in a private Instagram DM that they were bottinf, I'd report it to Jagex directly and not on a public sub that explicitly does not allow this kind of post

OP clearly is getting some sort of kick out of this than their sense of justice.  Hence, disgusting

Karambwan fishing is really good gp per hour with little to no effort, can make the account in literally one day and sustains 400k an hour at a fishing spot that never moves

Yes, farming guild update

Honestly, I rarely play OSRS but I stay subscribed for the memes. This subreddit is superb.

First time I got my hands on a Ring of Life I thought it was basically a automatic retreat. Didn't realise that if you got hit for 16 by a g maul spec you wouldn't get teleported...

Best explanation ever.

Yeah I mean it's fair enough. I've got 86 Slayer on RS3 and I've only done 17 tasks. If that's what you're used to it's going to be a nightmare trying to adjust to OSRS.

If only they would make people who actually report people PMods instead of sucking streamer dick. Pretty much every single world’s GE has scam bots, gambling bots, or some other rule-breaking activity going on, and they have pretty much free reign. All we can do is report them, but that doesn’t seem to do much.

good luck on the try, the rangers and meleers hit pretty hard.

At 1:20 you did really well with waiting for his attack, healing one brew then waiting back on the prayer book. 
---
You should keep your prayer tab open the whole time and switch to heal like you did at 1:20. (1 brew, back to prayer wait. Rinse repeat.) 
---
You also don‘t need to click back on Jad so many times.
---
Other than that goodluck on your next attempt!

Pro tip, don’t buy new. If you really want a laptop that’s never been used before try scratch and dent, or a place that specializes in overstocked products. I personally used Facebook marketplace, or you could try your local letgo craigslist etc. A lot of laptops are gifted and those who receive them as a gift don’t usually hold on to them long. It’s all about knowing what you’re looking for, it’s not hard to find someone who has no clue what their laptop is so you can use that to your advantage if you don’t have some ridiculous moral high ground. I got a 1 year old i7 1tb 15 inch dell inspiron for 200$ off a girl who got it as a gift and never used it. Gg ez 
---
Thrice to be exact

They only seem to make content makers pmods nowadays.

Where do you go to see slayer log?
---
You did not do 40 runs and have all chests below 20k. I've opened 300 chests this week (with Morty hards) and excluding barrows items I'd say the average is around 55k. Very rarely you get less than 20k. You have to be doing your progression % wrong

Thats what you get for not sharing your bank due to me tbing.

Wtf is wrong with you Kenneth.  Ever since you starting doing these drugs the things you say sound crazier and crazier.

Downloaded the wrong runelite months ago and I got highjacked by a bot or something. I only had like 300k and a d scimi on my ironman lol

Since then im good i don't need it anyway

Making the assumption that you are going for Kebos elites, sulliusceps are under rated for wc xp and the dedicated world never has any more than 10 people doing the event. I often see more in 1750+ worlds.

The 72* rc req is much more draining than the 85* wc one.

Let’s talk about my 6500 days since arrival... why do I play this still 
---
Have only "crashed" a guy once at lizard shaman. Just got the full favour and wanted to try them out, found a world where I couldnt see cannon balls at the entrance and went in. Guy was there whatever I'll just kill the southern lizard I'm only gonna do a few anyways, the ironmeme decides that instead of just ignoring it he should try to kill it first while threatening to bring in his main. At some point I just said fuck it and poked all the shaman to shut him up. Left maybe 3 kills later, not a big fan of them.
---
At least you owned up to it, dude. Mistakes are made sometimes 
---
No, they most likely got xp through over means, slayer monsters in RS3 and OSRS have the same xp per kill (assuming the monster is in OSRS of course), it's just more xp/h
---
100%
---
It’s fun, enjoyable, and you choose how difficult you want the game to be.
---
Quests are great, community has all matured from the younger days and you meet genuine good people around. Actually a great social MMORPG with a inclusive environment.
---
PVP community can be toxic, but that’s expected with all PVP games in general. Otherwise it’s crazy amount of fun, nostalgia and a great time-killer
---
Ignore button not at work.

Nmz prod /s

it's normal, literally everyone felt that way. You will understand way more in the game than your younger self ever did if you play now ;)

How else do you assert your dominance?

no.

Ahhh that's sweet, I'm stupid for not thinking of that lmao, thank you I'll definitely give that a go lol much better than potting up or fooding my way to 0
---
yeah that's what I'm starting to realize. Just way too risky at my lower level. Idk what else to do though
---
Absolutely loved the game and still do in some aspects. I see places I have no recollection of and struggle with training strategies. 
---
Any recs? 
---
No there wouldnt lmao. You need to redo your fucking math. I re did it and there are 2 completely empty worlds actually. Did you include the pvp worlds which are pretty close to empty?
---
I unironically store my void at zulrah because of this, along with a few other things.

This is hilarious haha

Is this why I can only get 2 kills max at vork? I run BP, elite void, BGS, AR(i), Sara boots, and rune darts in the BP. I also have 86 ranged. I thought my setup was fine but I can only get like 10-15 kills/hour
---
You must be leaving something out. did you not have 2fa on your email?
---
I've found worse, guy at velds pulled all of them and whenever I'd try to kill any of the fresh spawns or any he wasnt attacking would switch and kill the one I was hitting. 15 mins of this guy saying lol, lmao and omglol before finally finishing his task and fucking off. Didnt bother hopping cause all I wanted was to hurt his xp rates and make sure he couldnt afk.
---
The wedding speech ep always makes me cringe for him
---
Triangulate first; teleport to a few locations around the map and see the general direction it points you to. Once you've narrowed it down to a smaller area, triangulate that again. Once you feel you're close enough you can start chasing.

Runelite / Osrs Wiki

i wonder how much % of the osrs players are actually autistic

---
Eh soon youll learn that things are not black and white. All is gray
---
I am using Runelite. It isn't offering any tips? Is it an option I have to enable?
---
Til 2417k is equal to 2147m
---
-have you read on 5th Jan - "Tried to login, but incorrect password". My account was compromised again, the dude knows the bank pin and removed it. so thats why i can access the bank again after i recover my password.
---
- i said my TOB gear was gone, not sold, some other random stuffs from my bank in GE history is in the list.
---
Runelite hot/cold plugin is one of the most OP plugins. It'll literally tell you the location after some teleports 
---
They discussed this, having non-completed sets / individual items, put into chests. 
---
Ash said something techy and basically suggested there would be a serious issue of massive bugs / complications and that it isnt feasible. 
---
Go through recent QANDAs if you want the actual quote. 
---
You have the pet dude...
---
Void melee adds 10% to both your max hit and effective accuracy level.
---
And even if it only increased max hit that would still benefit the dwh spec as it lowers the chance of a successful damage roll to be a 0.
---
Let's be honest the last pic is not stroke victim it's autism or if he's mother drop him on his multiple times 
---
If my grandmother had wheels she would be a bike
---
No one cares LITERALLY NO ONE 
---
But the point I’m making is getting a drop worth 460k that could’ve been 100m is annoying because you could’ve had lots of money in your opinion but instead you got a few minutes of gp.
---
Not saying it’s deserved more, just the perception of the reward vs the potential 
---
Agree 
---
I dunno whether u can read or not, what he said is the hacker change the bank pin on the first day(hacker got the bank pin) then he cant use the bank because the bank pin is changed, to remove need 7 days,the hacker only sold the item in the inventory which is TOB gear he wore that day. Second is the next day, hacker go back into his account even after he change everything (email/pass) then the hacker remove the bank pin after sold everything so that is why he can see his bank after that.
---
I hate quests because I don’t want to do them, not because “I’m not taking them in.” I’d rip my balls off if I HAD to read through them. It’s cool that you like them, but I really don’t care about lore in the slightest with Runescape. 
---
I have a lot of questions ever since I got back into OSRS, so if anyone is willing to answer them, it would mean a lot to me. Players in F2P aren’t too friendly so it’s hard to get help without looking at old guides 
---
Should have gotten 69k xp

So why did the hacker wait a day before selling 1b+ in gear when he knew the bank pin and had access to the account..?

What method did you use to train mage?
---
I really loved his original videos, but honestly had to unsubscribe recently. The robotic voice and "creepy" background music in every, single, video was just getting frustrating. It's gimmicky. 
---
You could, but it doesn't make sense from my anecdotal personal experience, the goal of the BGS is to do as much damage as you can with the 2 specs, more damage = more stat reduction. You really also want a super combat at a minimum, and even then I was still completely something like 50% of my bgs specs.
---
Ugh.

Only thing more annoying then the spam bots are the people who complain about the spam bots.

Yes! Me and my friends started aswell when mobile got released. And for example when you watch a lot of YouTube videos when ur not playing yourself you will be learning about the game and you'll discover more and more what you can do (or work towards)

then why does everyone make a big deal out of the cape when u can just craft it with whatever level u need prolly like 70

You wear supreme, your level of stupidity is visible enough from that.

Thats the beauty of osrs, there is no right way to play. Train what interests you. Make your own build. Theres also tonnes of guides for osrs on youtube if you get stuck.

Ugh, watching this guide and the person said I only needed 6 of 3 types of runes, but then didnt mention I needed to be level 13 in magic?? Im slightly confused and just wasted time walking all the way to this quest spot for me to now have to walk back to the GE lol. On 2nd thought, im not 100% sure questing is for me.

One time me and a buddy got a girl to play with us just to fuck around. She doesn't know shit about shit with computers I can guarantee she didn't bot. We get back on the game about 3 hours after the first session and she is banned.

If someone can max on rs3 I'm sure they'd have to patience to get 70agility and do Sara with you for hours on end until they get the pet drop at 47kc, forgets to ensure it and then proceeds to lose it in the wilderness and not care and type lmao.. while you yourself have 1300+ without even an arma cbow and you get so pissed off that yiuvmessage them paragraphs of hate until they block you and then you realise you ruined tour only relationship with another human on this game and the. you proceddingly get dru k each night on 5$db long island ice teas at your local tgi fridays while training agility on mobile until you want to kill your thot server for being social acceptable and overall good at being a human.

Alkan/Number1_Boss isn't that incompetent.

That's not even their reasoning though. They support increased xp rates because they think that the reason as to why they can't get new players to stick around is that it takes too long to unlock "good" content (max cape, high level bosses and post-99 skilling).

People want to get good things in relation to what they have or money they make. For example Idgaf about 460k clue because it’s equivalent to 10 minutes bossing. In comparison it’s like a level 3 doing a clue and getting 1k, they could make 1k pretty quick so it’s not worth much. 
---
The fact it could have been worth something much more to the person receiving the loot is what is “annoying”. The fact it’s better than average is ok but in comparison to the items he could’ve had which hold the same drop chance this is both unlucky and lucky.

God I didn't realise being positive was so contentious. This is literally a glass half full argument. The guy got a super rare item and he posts about it on reddit like its a bummer. I completely understand what you're saying I just think it's a stupid way to think. 
---
u dumb
---
Probably poisoned prior
---
The guys name is friendzone. Can guess easily gotta cover better 
---
You can apparently acc share on RS as long as you don't share accounts to compete on the highscores, that's totally prohibited and will get you permed. For casual users, you're able to share at your own risk however.
---
Exactly, the spec weapon is honestly not needed (even though every guide you watch will tell you it is) when you're using the BP.
---
What have you done...
---
Yes
---
Like 3.14159, wbu?
---
that's indeed bfswapper, there are no chicks with dicks, only men with tits
---
You don't need dedicated graphics... The onboard graphics of the newer interesting chips is more than enough. IDK where you're looking for laptops but in the price range he's looking for all I see are 8000 series i3s and i5s. Which are more than enough. What shit are you looking at. I think you're the one spewing bullshit.
---
Nice try mod Mark
---
Look at that chad next to you though.
---
Because it would not take long to get over the honeymoon phase of your new pmod status and realize that it is a thankless, payless job that is sucking up your free time and making absolutely no difference because these spam bots are literally infinite. They are like roaches. You stomp one, but you know there's thousands more behind the wall ready to come out.
---
the stronghold of security says you should never share your account details! for shame! 
---
Dead giveaway. Act kind and treat others with respect, especially if there's zero reason to act in a different manner. Act reasonably in a respectful manner and receive respect in return.
---
Really isn't that difficult of a concept, unless you're a bloodthirsty sheep.
---
But I have this spot booked for another hour
---
I love how this is taking off
---
Well done Serene
---
Lllol
---
It's a bunch of "fools" against me, they're nothing to take seriously. They got blinded by a hateful harassment campaign initiated by a couple of psychopaths. Anyone who participates in this idiocy is scum.
---
Pay-Dirt!
---
Look up the definition of a "troll" and refrain from misinformation campaigns.
---
I know, but it's stupid that I get called a crasher when he's using both rooms
---
Saw a UIM complain yesterday that someone "stole his spot" at redwoods. Not at Bandos or Sara or even DK's... At the redwoods. 
---
No, seriously. Read it, the info is very valuable. Especially for someone having a delusional view about the whole instance..
---
As much as you noobz like 69, i be the rs exception that lives the 69 muhahhahahaha 
---
Zzzzzzz
---
when you gotta enter your bank pin for double xp :/
---
clicking on twitch ” double xp weekend ” will not get u anything exept ur account hacked :);)
---
The reason for that is people are putting higher prices or keeping then as merch item for farming guild release 10th January. :/
---
U have a good point there sir
---
Im on that spot. No 3rd party.
---
I strongly doubt that, you would get level 5 just from kicking the shit out of Cow (Level-2) before you left to do anything else. Unless they ran straight for Varrock to hit Dummy
---
Found the amateur without 99 agil!
---
log in different country ip
---
I did not actually mean that double hit chance would apply with special attacks, only for regular attacks.
---
yes this i want to know it might be a knew hack/scam by passing security which needs to be looked at if so asap
---
You're projecting 
---
Weird flex, then oak.
---
he said that not me btw... I imagined the range was his max. which he was indecisive about that's why 400-500 but in general he wanted less? 
---
idk what's your logic behind that? mind explaining how you understood it? you probably ignored "less than"?
---
&gt; You are getting all pissy because I said to get a new windows laptop and he'll be fine, which he absolutely would be. 
---
I told you 3 times already why that isn't true yet you still keep saying it. You're saying that based on some 5yo laptop you had which is completely irrelevant. What's relevant is specs of laptops he wants to buy and as I already told you gazillion times cheap laptops won't work well.  Use your brain just a little bit. 
---
Late reply, but swap your air runes to dust. Now you can house tele without tabs, freeing up an inven space :) 
---
I'm trying to discover those flairs sometime before posting, it's the same of the comments? We just need to write the letter? 
---
bookmarking this for later lmao
---
If you're using Runelite (you should use runelite), the tree timers are in the right hand panel under the timers tab.  Will tell you within 20 min when your trees are done.
---
how are you planning on getting barrows gloves now that your rng is completely depleted?
---
Serene tier comment
---
Why are you using a rune kite? Doesn’t that give u less range bonus? You’re safe spotting u don’t need defense 
---
Dude fuck hunter, fuck that motherfucking chinchompa skill
---
It's false according to anyone with a close to objectively independent mind.
---
It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine
---
Example?
---
The Diaries can wait a minute while you quest and train... another set of quests I completely forgot were Fairy Tale part 1 and then part 2 until you get the rings. Also Tree Gnome Stronghold and Grand Tree for the exp and unlocking Monkey Madness. I'll add you in game to help you :D 
---
Alright calm down lmao that doesnt make me an idiot
---
2 Fast 2 Favour
---
If you do that it will have a child called warding.
---
Dude I don’t even know how to add a flair. I tried and it said I don’t have the permission, so I just spam all my noob questions to ge untill someone answers me.
---
Love how you spend so much time on the OSRS Reddit commenting on people's achievement posts about them wasting time. You're a waste of life. Negative asshat.
---
Runelite does NOT do the mm puzzle for you, only clues
---
And you loved it 
---
U gotta understand that most of osrs playerbase are vets who have done the quests at least 1 time over and doing it again is easily put a physical and mental torture because of how theyre made.
---
Can’t believe i didnt know that, thanks!
---
Perfect "comeback" which obliterated your warped insult. 
---
Also, two points:
---
* Life isn't about winning arguments.  
---
* I generally respond once a day to the messages rolling in throughout the day.
---
I've already taken that into account, but half the stuff in this "timeline" doesn't make sense.
---
So your relationship was worth like 50 bucks. Nice.
---
Spotted the person without empathy, common sense, and any sense of morality!
---
Nice repost
---
Maxed RS3 rather laidback-like. Did some end-game content. Got bored because most goals were really time-gated (fuck doing Ports, seriously) and fuck doing Castle Wars for 500 hours for comp cape.
---
Went to OSRS on which I started an account before, and no-lifed the shit out of it the last few days.
---
Coming from the RS3 community; most people there dislike OSRS for the toxic players, not so much the game itself, which is by far a lot harder to 'finish'.
---
Make object not bankable, kinda like in biohazard except you can bank it in the quest and then teleport.
---
when you pk that clue scroller and tell them to take a seat, dear.
---
I ran a check on my phone and nothing came up. I've been changing my passwords for everything else all night in case it happens again on another account. I'm just so confused cause I've not touched anything but the app in the Play store. 
---
I suggest that Reddit incorporates the ability to visibly see the amount of total up/downvotes on every single remark. This used to be the case, but it got removed several years ago. 
---
With that said, it's difficult to stop *argumentum ad populum* from indoctrinating the average simpleton with these voting systems.
---
Really weird indeed. I just hope Jagex can get back to me.
---
Yeah fuck someone for playing a different game than you
---
That was for the make all option. He said that took like 10-12k lines of code, don’t remember the exact amount but that sounds right.
---
Yes, it is. Why are you so upset over nothing?
---
thanks alot bro!
---
Should have added some placeholder items
---
Nice vid man. Might start n ultimate Northernman myself, looks like fun :)
---
That makes me feel less crazy. Doesn't make me feel better. But less crazy is workable.
---
Dusties and nechs damn near pay for themselves 
---
There are tons of Ironmen with that much bank value. Imagine thinking you must do sketchy things for lots of gp 
---
How did she contact Jagex? I can't find anything on the support page to ask for a direct communication to explain the situation. 
---
AVI - Profile picture/avatar. Commonly used on Twitter according to some arbitrary definition site.
---
So I got about 4 days left on my membership by using the free week thing. Made about 1m now, what can I do to maximize my time and profit? Most or all of my money came from killing flesh crawlers but it has gotten a bit stale. Any advice is welcome! 
---
Mage of zamorak, smokes, let's go.
---
Don't spout misleading bias on my page.
---
Unfortunately all 3 are equally possible these days considering jagexs employee history hasn’t been the best recently..
---
Shu..... Nvm good point serene
---
"Waaaah, why does everyone harass me, all I do is be an asshole to people online!"
---
How do you get to 90 herblore without knowing how to use xp calculators
---
I think we voted like 83% to have half exp weekends instead of double exp weekends.
---
Insults and ad-hominems to describe your partial sight of the situation isn't valid nor an argument. Try again, bully!
---
Somewhere your email is public facing, or was sold by some survey or app you signed up for, or the email was in some unsecured database. Just google your email, watch what comes up. Could be FB, could be somewhere else, you give away a lot of private information. Like just from 2 seconds on Reddit, I know your age and location. Both of which are security question asks when you recover an account.
---
You really should be using a separate email for RS and nothing else, that is also properly secured with 2fa.
---
That said, you don't 'need' to do that, so long as you're extremely vigilant about phishing attempts and your email is secured, but it certainly doesn't hurt.
---
As a gmaul pure you might want to get 21 magic ASAP (using non-damaging spells to not gain hp xp), just so you can cast low level alchemy on thyself.

Stop projecting, psychopath.

Why do you need a clan to afk it?

Perfect

Took me 430 clue kc :D

honestly he seems to be more on the right track, but backed down because this is a subreddit about runescape, and thus isn't really a good platform to have political discussions.

people seem to tell you to shut the fuck up a lot because you seem hellbent on talking about politics in the 2007scape subreddit. maybe don't do that?

Your incompetence and hypocrisy is astonishing. Get lost.

False. Happens every single day, sometimes the populace get tricked into the opposite side of the hatred - Often based upon the  initial responses the visible score 2 hours in.
---
It's a wholesome post to see every day. Can't believe you've been doing it for almost a year. Automod should take over and sticky it. It would give new players ideas for what goals to go for 
---
No, patronizing sheep!
---
It’s not strange at all. It’s a collectable added to the game as a goal for people to reach. Players of every kind of game love accomplishing these goals. Gives them some joy, like a reward while playing the game. Even if received by pure chance. 
---
It’s not real. It’s an act. 
---
You can find it on eBay

MrMole post I don’t immediately downvote. Fuck

I personally don’t like it.

I don’t like pets either. It was also the beginning of a direction taken in art style that was awful too.

2007scape is great but not perfect. Blog posts (lol first firecape btw, my child was born lemme just call it dwarf in the title then it's osrs) can all fuck off imo.

I was just gonna splash to 70 mage or so

Weed is a similar dangerous drug which should be 100% prohibited and criminalized. Why issue an arbitrary defence for this  particular harmful drug? Seems hypocritical.

perhaps because you just have a lot of shitty opinions, and even when you are right you are coming off as an asshole ( using liberal as a derogatory term, calling people snowflakes). just chill okay?

I don’t mind quests but I do prefer some to others. My least favourite had to be Legends Quest. The spaghetti code on that quest is very bad but I understand why they won’t touch it as Mod Ash explained why on a Q&amp;A a while back. My favourite though has to be dragon slayer 2. It has everything. A good length, interesting dialogue and story, thrilling and tough boss encounters, good puzzles and great rewards. 
---
Didn’t burn them because they updated it so you can’t :p
---
Or to go out with their friends.
---
Oh yeah... Nvm
---
As someone with 54m xp and 1770 total, I appreciate the hell out of this video. I spend a lot of time pvming/researching pvm stuff not so much passive money/xp. This is really helpful man, and should allow me to pay for my own membership. I’ll let you know how it goes
---
It saves even more time when you just "crash" an entitled fuck.
---
I'd never resort to hyperbolic and emhpasized rebuttals and call-outs if it wasn't warranted. If somebody resorts to ad-hominems, personal attacks, or straight up baseless insults, it has to be called out. If you're defending these people, you fit perfectly in the same category as I previously described.

Hey there, memers! Peter Griffin from hit TV show Family Guy here to help you understand this meme.
---
The meme here depicts Squid ward from popular children's TV show Spongebob Squarepants looking old but excited about some paper. This links to the caption regarding a "btw" collecting all God pages.
---
"But Peter!" you exclaim. "Couldn't one simply purchase all of the God pages?" Aha, this is where btw comes in. Btw refers to ironman, a game option in which you are unable to trade or use the Grand Exchange. They are referred to as btws because an ironman will always tell you they are an ironman, finishing their statement with "ironman btw".
---
This links back to the meme because the only way an ironman could collect all of the God pages is by completing clues. This would take a very long time and lots of money and effort so the humour comes from Squidward looking bad because all he has cared about is God pages and has neglected to take care of his health and personal hygiene.
---
Hope that helps and don't forget to catch new episodes or Family Guy on Fox!
---
That’s my quest right there 
---
What about summoning was good? Messing up the combat triangle? Beasts of burden being horrendously broken? 
---
The irony
---
Imagine being so bad at hacking that all you get is 1 single guy with a full bronze set.... And you actually take it.
---
so barrows is an area with 6 separate boss fights, it is technically a minigame but it DOES NOT protect your items if you die, so in practical terms, it's more like a boss encounter.
---
Halberds are  big one, you can buy it at the npc for a few k and the G.E value is like 17k. It'll never sell though
---
I would love something like that *flair checks out*
---
&gt; Imagine living life being this pretentious :D
---

Complete psycho.
---
Why do you need to view it though? You've already entered the details, so you don't need to see them again.
---
In a normal situation, yes it is your account and only you should have access to it. The reality is that some people share their account and/or get their account hacked. In this case hijackers abuse this system to get their victim to reveal their sensitive details in what they think is a "safe environment", after all it is on the official RuneScape website.
---
If I remember correctly Jagex also sends an email about the ticket to the registered email. This email contains all the sensitive information the player has entered in the ticket. If this is true, this is another vulnerability. 
---
The manual recovery form already works this way. You enter the details, submit the recovery form. Jagex will eventually look in to it, but the player will not be able to cancel the recovery appeal or view the entered details after submitting it. 
---
No, sheep.
---
Arma before ward
---
Look up the definition of a "troll".
---
No worries man! The farming alone will pay for your membership so you'll never have to pay again. Also if you save for when the premier club is up each year it'll only cost 56m for a years membership which is only 150k per day!
---
Did you accidentally reply? Sigh.
---
Upcoming for one piece reference :) 
---
Bosses (and all pvm) are scaled to only 28 inventory slots and the amount of hp you can get back via current methods. Summoning would cause all of that content to become trivial with the bunyip/unicorn/beast of burden
---
You're either a subpar troll or actually retarded. Either way, you're a loser.
---
And bring back evil trees as well. It was totaly optional, no op xp rate, no op rewards but was a community event and tons of fun. Also it couls be done as a group for ironmens as well same as penguins. 
---
The only worse thing than dailyscape is soloscape. BRING BACK COMMUNITY EVENTS
---
The door is over there, please make haste through it. 
---
I think so.
---
So rigour, 99 range, pegasians, armadyl then ward? 
---
A Friend looks like he's back too
---
HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIBERNATION
---
Thanks, glad to be back :)
---
Luckily I'm a little over half way back to where I was in terms of skills and quests... At least in level, I know XP definitely not. But before I was a dumb middle schooler wasting time 90% of my time playing, now I actually need to maximize time spent playing hah. 
---
&gt;!A q  p!&lt;
---
M E T A
---
&gt;:w:&lt;
---
Id say so
---
That looks like a good upgrade order, you won’t need armadyl because void is BiS.
---
Runecrafting? What the fuck is that?!

They should add private rooms. Intanced area = 100k entry

I crashed a guy a the cinnamon bun crabs on New Years by accident I was very drunk and didn’t realize I ran back to the wrong spot after resetting and then I bullied this poor guy out of his spot and felt like an asshole when I realized what happened 
---
Haha yeah my buddies told me that, ima go blowpipe only next go round. And hopefully get it
---
I can smell the lasagne from here
---
Spam/bot recovery requests to get it locked maybe? 
---
Or just ask jagex to lock it. "Hi i believe my computer is compromised, will you lock my account while i reformat it". 
---
You can get by with like 30! Less are used but I'd bring 30 to be safe. 
---
Sorry, 👅 I can’t understand 👅 your accent 👅
---
Just open the caskets on entrana
---
This is a case of an idiot falling for the "your account has been locked, recover through this link" phishing scam. Nothing to see here 
---
Yes but only of one color. So it's literally fucking useless.
---
The only PvM activity I can think off where a bigger inventory at maximum efficiency would be a balance issue would be raids2 and inferno. Everywhere else you either bank and return within a minute or you just use an alt.
---
Because you're not the first idiot to fall for this. 
---
that's...autist. definitely.
---
I’m so horrible at these it’s embarrassing. 
---
This is dogshit
---
If the osrs team is going to develop a new skill that will impact the entire game then they can just as easily re-introduce a skill that has historic meaning to the game. The argument of "Summoning was broken" doesn't hold up when the alternative is literally the development and implementation of a new skill. 
---
nope just alot of normies dont like to raid with irons coz its usually them taking the loot =)
---
Lmao
---
Holy shit that's meta
---
My rule of thumb is red dots on the mini map. Banking in the catacombs should be less than 60 seconds start to finish, if you make it back in that frame im happy to return it.

That's not socializing, that's just being a fucking lazy cunt :)

The words were fake, but the emotion was real stemming from Will Smith being very distant from his dad IRL.
---
“Haha yeah I just played on mobile but was too impatient” 
---
\^ What he said
---
No, accuracy would lower your chance to hit a zero. Str bonus or a damage percent just widens the range of your hits, e.g. 1-40 or 1-44. So damage raises your max hit and raises the chance that you'll hit higher. 
---
"Pound" is the accurate style with dwh (the one that gives attack xp) meaning it's slightly more accurate. It doesn't matter how much you hit with dwh cause as long as you land a hit, your opponent's defence gets lowered by a flat 30%. This is why you just want to be as accurate as possible with it.
---
Unsushing for good Ron meme my child.
---
If the tangible rewards don’t help with anything outside the mini game and the exp rewards are slower than outside exp rates, what will be people’s motivation to do this?
---
i have literally never understood how to do these puzzles..like idk dude
---
it also takes &lt;2min to pay the 200k, even to make it lmfao.
---
Nope. You didn't read my post. You need to read, process and comprehend what I said.
---
Let me say it again. The *amount* of rebalancing a new skill has to have is *very* different for each new skill. Warding's is low, summoning's is crazy high. That alone is a reason to not have summoning.
---
I've played this game since 2007 and got 99 summoning a year after its release. To this day it is my favorite skill and when I play Rs3 its the only cape I wear. I love summoning, but it doesn't belong in Osrs.
---
Have you ever been diagnosed with minor BPD with Cluster B traits?
---
Hey I messed up, thar avg is for supercompost. Ultra compost has a 8.56 avg including death, and over 9 excluding dead ones (so disease free patches)
---
So it does beat toadflax, but not by much. Gotta calculate the cost of making your own ultra compost vs buying and how that cuts into which is better, 17k avg profit on toadflax and 20k avg profit on ranarr with these stats
---
Usually the cycle I see is 
---
* get into runescape
---
* it consumes your life
---
* you become aware of this and desire to change (or embrace it)
---
* you quit
---
* you live a happy successful life
---
* you hear the distant call
---
* it beckons
---
* you get back into runescape
---
$1000 gaming pc isn’t all that ridiculous. Shit many of the phones we play on are a grand anymore.
---
Are we even worthy
---
No, I'm a I'm a Smash 4 player. ;) Who would play that old, outdated, gltiched, amazing, beautiful, irreplaceable game?
---
\^ What he said 
---
He still streams. Twitch.tv/ayiza
---
That's strikingly accurate. The only reason I got back into this game was because I heard about mobile, a month later I hit 1500 total, something I was nowhere near when I started playing however many years ago 
---
You realize people would stop if you simply stopped making 50 comments an hour or put more thought into every comment you make, right?
---
People only do it because:
---
* You react to it.
---
* Every single comment you make is very throwaway and low-effort.
---
* You never seem to *not* be making at least 10 Reddit comments per hour.
---
Food for thought. Also, I'm sorry, but people playing into a meme that you actively encourage by not changing your behavior is not harassment.  
---
you're safespotting them...so you can literally log out at any time and hop
---
literally don't understand how you're getting pk'd unless you're afk for 20 minutes jerking off 
---
Bro evil trees were OP
---
Yea i think its time for you to take a break haha
---
wtf, who even dreams about runescape.. Maybe you should do some socialising, find a girlfriend or something - an online game should never take over your life, unless you earn good, and by good i mean good money - otherwise it should be treaten like a hobby which requires no more than 2-3 hours a day
---
I have had 4 cannonball alts running at the same time, can confirm not all are bots 
---
It helps the hijackers when the op is hand sending them all the info they need to recover the account.

Wow, amazing come back.

I died vs Lizard Shamans in the caves, i didn‘t lose any equipment except for potions and some drops, is that normal? 
---
You edited your comment as seen by the * symbol.  And my response still stands. The re-development of a skill with history will be on par with the creation of a new skill. Jagex no doubt already has the Summoning files from 2008+ and so removing the broken/fixing parts to better fit with the current game will be easier if not the same as creating a new skill from scratch. On the worst case that is takes the same time as developing Warding at least we have a skill that fits with the history of 2007scape that thousands of players play for. 
---
2-3 hours a day is a lot if you work or study full time. I am trying to scale back to playing a few hrs a week and it’s immensely challenging

He also hand delivered all his accounts info to the hijackers, i guess you missed that bit in his op. 
---
Alternating between the barrows gloves grind and barb fishing on my iron. Sometimes I sprinkle in mage training arena, although I'm running out of gp for runes and I really hate blackjacking. 
---
It’s not really that hard, and by that I mean it doesn’t take skill. There’s a “cheat sheet” way of doing them that makes them mad easy
---
No hunter or construction in this version of the game.
---
"Why does my peepee come out yellow" 
---
I did my assembler with 80 range and defense you are doin somethin wrong mate
---
I would come loot... But this is a setup!!
---
Runelite just tells you how to do it.
---
Fucking easyscape /s
---
That’s super dickish. It’s a mini game with bosses. They’re bosses that kill you. If you die you drop your items, unlike a mini game 
---
...what? Are you alright ? You had too much bandits brew ?
---
I upgraded from strength. Iron man makes it hard to get a good amulet 
---
D darts for bp right?
---
Runelite
---
Did he survive?
---
Are those cannon balls bottom right? Why do they look weird..
---
That would make both scrolling and changing tabs really expensive operations. You know how it takes nearly a second for the bank to come up currently, but swapping tabs and scrolling is nearly instant? Doing just the change you mention would make the initial loading of the bank somewhat faster, but shove that rendering time to all view changing operations. I personally don't want to wait a second for any tab of my bank to display.
---
Correct. I add them to bp as I'm nearing the end of the 2nd 360 kill just before I pot up for jad
---
Yeah they are wasted so plan accordingly if you’re making a low combat pker, only the level where the max hit goes up matters
---
There are definitely better ways to spend $8. Unfortunately none of those better options give you exp.
---
Don't got enough money for BGS and people say Elite void isn't good if you range isn't 95+ or some shit. 
---
Not even close to rigour if that shit cost 64m. I don't even got aramadyl armor/bgs or dhcb. 77 magic atm.
---
No! Because you still roll higher on average if you are potting. It's the difference in

When is the premier club?
---
Literal basic math. Add all the players from the member worlds (89,508), divide by number of worlds (88). That gives you an average of 1017 players on EVERY MEMBER WORLD...17*88=1496 AKA ~1500 excess. It's not that hard...
---
Put them in a rune pouch in your good to go. You should bring them anyway because they make tasks last longer because it frees up inventory space. Takes 2 seconds to clean an inventory of herbs. Just saying,  if you’re claiming you have no bank space, you also need to everything to reduce the size of your bank.
---
I'll record a trip after I finish my farm run. I don't see how people get 3+ kills a trip when I ran out of food on the weakened vorkath in the quest.
---
It’s very not great
---
I made a reddit account just for this post. Cuz funniest shit that happend to me in a while why would i setup lmao. 
---
You're gonna fry your balls with that laptop on your lap
---
This is the epitome of laziness. Imagine one of the greatest quality of life updates being too much of a hassle. 
---
Thanks for account
---
That 99 RC is so fake wtf.
---
who has the balls to actually start one
---
if he got ratted why did they go to the effort of locking his account and phising his recovery details when they could have just logged straight in?
---
Yeah i tend to rake a break every couple months until i realise all the time ive wasted i could be playing rs then i come back
---
Yes, you have to complete the totem to get more of the same pieces. 
---
An exception to this is if you drop the piece. For example, if you have 2 different pieces in the bank, 1 in your inventory and a superior spawns. You should drop the piece in your inventory and pick it back up after you kill the superior. 
---
I get what your saying but the meme does not make any sense? 
---
I only plant ranarrs in the disease free patches 
---
How did the email you recieved start? Did they say your username at the start? Because only Jagex does that.
---
If it starts with like ‘hey adventurer’ it’s always a scam. Jagex always uses your ingame name on emails
---
So it would seem...
---
Elite void stacks with salve amulet so it will always be better than dhide at your level.

Lol I must be a brainlet because it took me almost an hour.

I was good till like the last 6-8 pieces in the bottom right 
---
Yeah, and I'm sure people don't like EoC because they're not taking it in and/or giving it a fair chance, either.
---
Different people like different things. Plenty of people just simply don't like the kind of storytelling that rs quests offer, and maybe, just maaaybe, that's why they're skipping the dialogue, and not the other way around?
---
Get good Lmao

Could’ve gotten 69 prayer (ancient mace), 69 run energy and 69 attack.

 smh

Thank you for confirming yet again that you were a completely sheltered and autistic kid, Serene.
---
shut it u swine

Next best after elite void and can’t afford arma? Blessed dhide or Karils? 
---
If you go to the actual website not the email they fake phishing email they send you is this a way to combat it? Or are you SOL?

If you’re really dead set on looking at specs there’s an argument to be made that Apple products are superior because of their superior CPUs (which, like I said before, outperform the equivalents found in android devices year after year for like at least six years running now). But that would be silly ultimately because we all know that scoring some arbitrary amount of points more on a benchmark doesn’t effect usability very much nor enjoyment of the product. I could probably use an iPhone XS or Samsung S9 and get the exact same usability out of it and this is true for 99% of end users. The enjoyment of the OS is really the only difference now days between the competing flagships phones. If you like android more... then that’s cool. If someone else likes iOS more, equally cool. I’ve owned both android flagship phones and Apple phones and enjoyed both for different reasons. The only real difference is gonna be in the price department. If you compare the S9 and the XR (the XS is more a super premium phone and Apple intends the XR to be its successor to the iPhone 8) price-wise the S9 is like $720 and the XR is $749. The entry level XS runs $999. I would make the argument, and perhaps I’m wrong here, that someone in the market for the newest and best phones on the market won’t be phased much by paying an extra $30-280 (depending on how hardcore they wanna go) more if they enjoy the experience of the OS more. I’m totally the type of person who will drop more money on tech stuff just because I like it more and I imagine a lot of people buying the top of the line products released yearly are in a similar mindset that a few hundred dollars a year is a small price to pay for enjoyment. 
---
Wall of text due to mobile. Apologies. 
---
Imagine not having your game chat filtered
---
Out of the loop. NIH?
---
I disagree. Also fuck all you noobs that don't find your own world's in the catacombs
---
Sucks you're an ironman for this PK lol. Would have been some nice loot :P - I kid I kid... Probably genuine.
---
Funny thing is in one of those game made by the people that made adventure quest. You could edit the gold given and damage done, and it would actually stick I felt like such a badass showing off in computer class the next day.
---
He said a thing and it worked 
---
I think its safe to say lets add some serious hardcore security into the game shits been wild. Fuck slayer updates i wanna feel safe.
---
Was it Neive lewds
---
It ate your grub
---
To be fair, you will eventually be able to do 3/4 vork kills in that amount of time which is usually more than 200k
---
You are a piece or work dude lmao
---
BIRD UP
---
There isn't any objective that everyone follows; it's more of a sandbox MMO. You could focus on finishing all the quests, leveling one or more skills to 99, or killing a certain monster/getting a certain drop. As for the walking, training agility and getting the graceful set will cut down a lot on the energy restore time. Training magic will unlock a lot of teleports and allow you to enchant jewelry which also gives a lot of teleports (or you could just buy the teletabs and jewelry). Some quests, like Fairy Tale II, also unlock a lot of teleports which drastically cut down on walking. Also, don't forget the minigame teleports, many of which you can use from Lvl 1.  Overall, though, I'll be the first to admit that OSRS isn't the game for everyone. Some people really enjoy the freedom to set their own goals and explore in their own way. Others want a bit more direction. I'd try unlocking more teleports and see if the game feels better. Otherwise, it might just not be for you.
---
Serene come on. Just shut up.
---
Rs3 ironman seems fine, no mtx, different combat system though. 
---
If you dont want to waste your time then play 18hrs a day like lynx titan. I have a maxed account and a 1900 total lvl ironman and never bought battlestaffs, never did herb runs, bird runs on my main. On ironman i only do herb runs because its needed for skilling. I get way more nests from giant mole. So its not a must, and they are not even the best method for any kind of money/xp rate
---
Now please, take a seat dear.
---
Lmaooo! Oops. Firelighter** 😂😂😂
---
i understood the oujia reference dw
---
You need to pray mage if you’re only using basic antifires.
---
If the Spawn dies next to you it shouldn’t hit you.
---
Click the ground when he shoots the freeze so you stop attacking. If you shoot him as he freezes you there will be a delay before you can cast.
---
If you are okay with the wilderness, elder chaos druids are good

Bring back fist of guthix

Err not really, If i lost pmod because of this when I logged back in I would explain the situation and relate it to jagex staff if anything Irl happened emergency other than that no reason why he shouldnt log back in within 1 hour to trade a split
---
99 str range hp mage
---
80s the rest
---
i dont do raids, but i do vork occasionally, but i have a BGS for that, might just sell it.
---
I know that Hardcore Ultimate Ironman isn't real, but I made the account hardcore and purposefully don't use the bank.
---
was lucky to get a ruby on my first random event, and that bad boy is staying in the inventory until 50 crafting / 49 magic
---
Both have the same quality of graphics basically :v
---
Anti venom has the same effect rendering serp pretty much pointless
---
It doesn't. It has death storage, it costs nothing to get the items back.
---
You can disable prayer at the start of freeze and poison phase, that way you don't need to dring too much prayer potions. I don't think it's worth it to kill Vorkath with 5 min. kill time unless you have no better moneymakers available.
---
Th prophesy
---
Yeah, I managed to kill it with super anti and manta rays but only 1 run per trip. Dunno how people get 3+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Oo6TEBBw8&amp;feature=youtu.be 
---
Guess ill Google farm runs thanks dude! This game's been fun af so far
---
Wg cc
---
have most max gear, i only really slay and do vork, probably just sell it.
---
get myself some more 90+ skills.
---
Im not usually a big hater but like, who tf is considering this an achievement, in any sense?
---
Yeah no shit idiot
---
But what if I like dudes...
---
You're the one crying, I thought we'd been over this. Are you really that stupid?
---
Yeah just watched the video below.
---
You seem to be panicking on the spawn. Don’t click Vork after he freezes you and wait for the spawn to completely die before attacking again. He’s immune to damage before that.
---
DHCB helps a lot with kill speed. RCB sucks ass.  Blowpipe would be a lot better as well.
---
The fuck.. 😂 nice! 
---
dumb fuck
---
Immeasurable since its single handedly the best acclunt in the game but ban rate is so darn high if sold
---
I’m sorry but your title woulda looked a lot cooler if you said “bitches”
---
I’ll sell you mine at grape price lol
---
You seem to know...
---
Who is Serene and why does everyone hate them?
---
No that's a viral hoax. Will Smith knows his father and he's still active in his life.
---
All the way aroundddd
---
Is there any way to appeal a ban? I maxed my RS3 account and then started playing OSRS on it but it got banned for botting after playing for about a week (I think it was because I was using windows mouse keys and 3-ticking barbarian fishing). This was my first offense on the account.
---
You run around?
---
Bridge south I think 
---
Yes. This is what I expected.
---
Considering rushing is pretty much dead you kinda fucked the account. Your HP will be to low and you'll be stacked out by Obby Maulers. Keep that account for fun and make a new one.
---
Yeah it's crazy how much time we wasted by having fun lol. I'm still very far off from where my old account was in terms of quests, gear, etc. but oh well.
---
Don't you have to be 13 to play this game? 
---
And why put him on nostalgiascape put him on RealScape jezuz he should be put on nostalgiascape when he needs to be punished and mainscape when he has been good.

If I could give gold, this comment would get it. So instead ill give you an upvote.

IT WAS DOUBLE EXP WEEKEND???
---
You know, at this point I it is obvious he has some kind of problem. I'm starting to feel bad for the "shut up Serene" thing.
---
Make money I guess 
---
This ^^
---
This exact thing happened with a painting professor at my art school, I feel like i’m the only one who thinks that what happened to him was taken way too far. I wish you best of luck, it can’t be easy 
---
And you can't do that on an account which is maxed. Fully.
---
Seems a waste imo. He's done with the game
---
Osbuddy does. Why would runellite not?
---
Why would it be impossible? OSRS accounts are being sold every day.
---
Step 1. open the fucking map.
---
There is no step 2.
---
Mobile agility. I’m currently 73 and want 76 for easy teleports to Zulrah using the fairy ring. 
---
Tayroc with the sponsorships helped too.
---
thank you i now understand your meme and appreciate you more for it
---
Slay lvl?
---
If they ever add any form of Wings as an item for the cape slot I quit. That shit fucking ruined GW2
---
I would legit pay that.
---
Shut up, Serene.

What is this method called exactly? Just under water fishing?

Heyyyy yaaaaa

Wow it is just a picture of 10 bots in 1 place

I appreciate you too :-)

You may not believe this, but my slayer is 99. Crazy!!!!! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
Actually 17.7m do though
---
Because it’s the number one ranked account in the world, and you’d hope that a random new log in point after the same set log in point being used for 16 hours a day for five years straight would raise some red flags 
---
I was literally just thinkin serenes on a roll this year but then it crashed and burned
---
Why play a game with 10 other people when you can play a game with 50k other people?
---
click the middle mouse button and drag.
---
Actually Lynx Titan mentioned  they did do a double exp weekend and it was the only weekend he missed his daily exercising in the last few years. No fact checking from me ofc, just thought it was interesting he mentioned it in his AMA as I thought the same as you. 
---
Wow... I can't believe in all these years I didn't even accidentally do this. Thanks haha
---
Can i copy your homework?...
---
He's not asking for his stuff back. He's asking Jagex to look into it and see that he's telling the truth. He's simply trying to warn people of what happened so it doesn't happen to them man, why you gotta go off on him like that.
---
Gotta watch out for the samsquanch too.
---
Even if you don’t take defense into account it’s still worse lmao. Sorry dude, controlled is just bad. If you split the xp at all, even in half (let’s say it’s att/str) you would still be better off doing strictly strength and then strictly attack because of how max hit affects your dps. Split xp attack options is bad in every scenario except for bursting on defensive.
---
OSRS has never had a double exp weekend ever throughout its existence.
---
Everyone has a friend like this. I had an IRL friend who was the luckiest person at this game, I swear. He had a ~10kc Guthan’s Spear back in the day when they were like 9m. Then he went to Black Dragons with that money and got a visage in one inventory. Turned around to do Bandos free for all and got Tassets twice. His luck was unlike any I have ever seen.
---
hp regens every 60 seconds.
---
do it with 5 ip's in 5 mins

&gt; I farmed 5400 canyon shamans for mine,
---
holy shit that's rough, for me though i wasn't actively looking for one, simply killing them for slayer, iv'e decided to keep it though, i have plenty of cash/items already, and it's a cool drop to have "earned" myself.
---
Knives at rock crabs is relatively cheap and not terribly long 
---
I would also join if you guys don't send me pictures of your shit.
---
thanks man, im keeping it as a few have said, it's a cool drop to get and i already have most gear i need anyway.
---
Well you just ruined your son’s life. We all start sometime. 
---
This is part of the reason the x10 hp in rs3 and to avoid 0s
---
Oh shut the fuck up drama queen, you sound like a little bitch.

Your formatting is so god awful. I'm not trying to be a dick but there's absolutely no uniformity to it.

1/5000 is drop rate, I happily take an "average" kc for it. Took 5 seasons of Game of Thrones over about a week and came out to like 1.8m/hr after supplies considering hammer as well.

Iron only has 50% chance of smelting correctly you should have 10.

Yea but OP is an iron so just kinda bouncing around times as a thought experiment. I used bgs for about 400 kills and found it far more effective that the dwh.

Also Lost city gives you access to D Long and DDS which is useful.

Rc is slow xD

then why make it in first place?

Just get the rock cake, the quest is incredibly easy and doesn't take more than 15 minutes. The rock cake will save you a ton on prayer pots.

Holy shit dude that's not chump change

You need new eyes.

Agreed, was hype and didn’t bother looking through the options in the app :o

A strong effort. Love the fact you've dabbled in all skills rather than just powerleveled a certain one. Glad you are enjoying it! 
---
Genuinely curious, where does all the hate come from for double xp weekends?
---
The seasonal is alright because that’s only qualifying for the tourney. Since the tourney has a prize ($20k I think) they want people to not account share.
---
And the deep wildy chaos altar if you're willing to risk it. I tried it out for the first time recently, bringing only one inv at a time, and that shit is WACKY xp
---
aww man, i cannot imagine the hype you felt when you got the drop, theres something about FINALLY getting a drop you've been seeking that other games just cannot do.
---
 i was in mmorpgs stream when he got his back in the day and that was a hilarious reaction, the best i mustered was a "yaaay, cough cough cough cough dieeee"
---
Probably.
---
&gt;Thing is, from a security standpoint locking an account on failed logins is just terrible.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If it’s multiple failed logins in a row, they should just send an email. Otherwise you could just target users and have their account locked 24/7 by continuously sending requests.
---
\-\_- you lack of knowledge security concepts is terrible, its needed to stop bruit force attacks. 
---
Osrs is a lot easier already with the new updates and stuff compared to real os. We dont need xp weekends imo.

I can't answer what the difference between the 12-month membership and the premier club gold are, but membership *in general* is applied to the account, and not just the specific game.  When you create your generic Runescape account, you create an account for both OSRS and RS3.

he only had 875m GP the last time he played. He staked his entire cash stake and pretended to still have a bil, presumably knowing he'd scam someone to get money back...

Rfd was added in 2006.

I hear gods dont concern themselves with the trappings of mortal materialism
---
RIP. I feel ya on the set back. Rannar's are definitely a mid tier option I've found. So if you have around a 2m+ cash stack it's a non issue running rannar seeds as the 400k or so you need is easily available, but if you are sitting on 200k GP you should not be doing Rannar's. 
---
There is no fast or hard rule, but I'd say you should be able to afford at least 3 full farm runs when buying seeds. Your profit margins are insanely massive on toadflax, kwuarm, and avantoes.(18k in Avantoe seeds will get you around 120k back in Herbs) It's just Rannar is more overall GP both in investment and in returns.

if you think the trash he posts here is dumb you haven't seen him in the wild

I think these are too good based on the rarity of the rare drop table and that there’s that creature that always rolls on the table as loot. Maybe if they were like d spear, square half level of rarity on the table but I don’t think that would do much to make it much better overall and would prefer this to come from something else like a future skilling boss
---
The Bow would definitely be better DPS for pretty much everything. Nothing in the cave really has high defense, and the added range of the crossbow would really only benefit you with the healers on Jad.
---
That said, you could always just take both in, and use as you see fit. The poison effect would probably only be worth it on Jad though, and you could just take some poisoned arrows instead as well.
---
It’s bad game design to have to go outside the game for information
---
It sounded like you were defending it and that it was genius because it stuck it to the haters
---
At least it was your vorkath gear and not your tbow. As bad as losing 250-300m is at least that's re-attainable in a decent amount of time. Sadly no one can  really help you here and jagex won't do anything either.

a low combat cape like this dps is absolutely not a limiting factor, the caves will take forever no matter what. if you are trying to limit hp xp then youd want to poison in which case bolts would be best iirc.

Well I did outline in a post above how ranarrs are actually statistically more profitable even if we give them a greater chance to die, but remember with 6 lives (using ultracompost) you'd be wrong to assume you're only getting 6.46 herbs per patch, that's statistically impossible over a long period of time. You'll definitely be getting 8+ and improving the more you level up. This means the higher level you are the better ranarrs are.
---
Also the most important thing is prices change, so for example I didn't notice that ranarrs have gone from 42-47k the last few days without increasing the price of the weeds (which is unusual even for ranarrs and is the first time their prices havent matched since 2017) so until they drop a little bit it will be very slightly better to buy toadflax, but as soon as they drop even slightly ranarrs will be more profitable uncontested.
---
Used to drop I wanna say 100 noted sharks which got replaced by the manta drop, flooded the heck out of em

Item amounts dont add up very well, laws used for farming, anglers usually eaten, picked up hides/bones jav heads from other kills, totems are usually done at 3, etc.  I've gotten 3 full totems so far.

Each run consists of 2 (4) pp, 1 extended and a 2 ranging, with 5-8 lobsters depending on how much attention I'm paying.

Originally wanted to use 100K ruby bolts, but I think getting 100 spears is the goal, but will be using 100K regardless.

Great idea!

Thanks =)

Cannonball smithing is pretty common afk income for a secondary account for people that are too lazy to do another source of income. I have a lvl 3 that has 7 crafting and 94 smithing from cannonballs who's also muted (since 2006) so I never reply to anyone that talks to me =P

I agree, it is a win since i can sell the material for way more than what he took from my bank. But if he was botting im sure il get banned... Not worth it!

I’m also decently new to the game but 79 combat and had to learn the hard way I would be down to help people.

Well the main point of this video was actually to show you that you can make your game entirely free to play by buying bonds with gold and that you can do it at a relatively low level without spending much time. But you could always buy gold to make the game free for the rest of us =)

Can you imagine everyone in CW again like the old days

The fuck are you talking about. Is scamming not against the rules?
---
Questing is going to help you get through early leveling while also unlocking a lot of useful things. Getting full Graceful outfit will also help with getting around more efficiently. In terms of money, check [this thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9jrfpe/money_making_rates_guide/) out. The prices may not be the same but it'll give you an idea of the many ways you can make money for bonds. The lowest req one would probably be making bars at Blast Furnace. It can be done with a Coal Bag, but it's highly suggested to first get one via mining at the Motherlode Mine.
---
Ah okay.  That makes more sense.  My internet brain just saw you're and was like "No! Wrong!"  hahah
---
Thank you 
---
Sorry you're right I forgot that it technically costs a little bit. /u/lukef555's sentiment is correct, however. Depending on the bosses you have unlocked it can be done in 1 or 2 sessions.
---
Yeah
---
Put a red circle around your drops next time. So we peasants know where to look. 
---
Took me a long time to figure this out.
---
Nice drops btw
---
you probably logged into a phishing site most likely, stuff like double xp or whatever in your email/on reddit/on twitch.tv/on facebook is always fake and just there to steal your info.
---
Coincidence that I just saw this post, was thinking this earlier and was thouroughly confused and upset since I can't sit on it
---
In this case, low stats and telling someone to get laid kind of goes hand in hand. If someone like Lynx Titan told me to get laid I’d laugh. 
---
Also why did you only try message him 10 days later?
---
Sure, but at ~350k-500k an hour if you’re decently quick and determined (also not considering stamina pots/agility level) you still need 50 smithing (60 to be efficient) and even then you’re talking 5-6 hours of in game time again, if you’re quick. Realistically 2.8M from blast furnace I would assume takes most people 5-9 hours of in game time. If you work at all, that’s 1 hour of wages. 
---
Just by basic math, if you work any job and can’t make 2.8M in 1-1.5hrs of in game time, you might as well buy it. Idk many people making that money in an hour.

Get farming up and do herb runs. Decent money for very little time. You can get to 35 farming just through quests, which will let you do Toadflax which will be a decent profit. Could also do Limpwurts and white berries which are alright money.

Have you tried pressing play?

Serene you're clearly wrong on this one hear. Drugs and alcohol are a essential part of make any form of social experience that much more entertaining. Sober people just aren't as entertaining as people fucked up on various drugs.

Did Jagex ever provide a reason for not hiding poll results before voting?

tell me why "used too" is correct instead of "use too", except for the fact that it is.
---
So there’s no alternating, you tag each fish only one time. So with only 8 or 9 fish spawned at one time you can tag all of them and camp the new spawns that will be new to tag. I typically tag all in an area, continue around until all have been tagged, and then new spawns will be in place. That way you’re not wasting time waiting for them to enter the drift net and are making sure all fish are caught as soon as they’re available. Also as you see I put screen markers for deposit all and bank loot which you can do really quickly once you get used to it. 
---
Something you’ll also notice is that the north net can be stalled while placing the net from full -&gt; harvest -&gt; setting up the net so all the fish line up waiting to be caught. I plan on making a video sometime soon and I’ll send it your way. Hope that helps!

I take lots of damage from the range hit but the mage hit never lands I have pro magic on. Food and prayer pots are both about empty when I do 4 kills.

Typically I wont do a 4th kill if I dont have 5 sharks left. 
---
Super anti fire every 2 kills with pro range completely protects me from the magic attack.

Even if you could report him, he likely wouldn't even get a slap on the wrist.. there are many, many, players who are clearly bots that I report, then add as friends to see if anything happened.. alot of them still play lol

Well if you get him to spawn near Italy rock and use chinchompas you might have a better time with healers. I did it at 85 range actually started fight with addy darts so killed him to healers  spawn swapped to chins for a bit then safe spotted. Killed healers swapped darts to dragon darts. Then I cleared the last healer that got hung then him.

He wants the series to end, tbh. He had no reason to up the pay-out to 150m. He's only been genuinely targeted, like once, and spends most of his time welfare grinding on-edge in mostly empty worlds. It's gotta get old.

Wouldn't this mean that vorkath is ~4m gp/h? I mean... 1k kills means it's 200k per kill... If you assume 3mins per kill, that makes 4m

It's a more consistent method of catching sharks, but it's not nearly as AFK. The fishing pools move around the platform in 15 second intervals. Sometimes the pools have flying fish that pop up and eat 20 of your minnows each second if you're not paying attention.
