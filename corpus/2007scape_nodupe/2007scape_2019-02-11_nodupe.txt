Are you using runelite? If you are it might have taken a screenshot if you have it enabled.

Yeah i dont see why not, just wanted to mention that trying as is wont let you kill it, anything to reduce your negative mage bonus would work i suppose.
---
Excellent suggestions.

It is ironic that while skilling catalysts were suggested in OSRS's sub but RS3 devs implemented it as stone spirits in the mining and smithing rework. RS3 also has had various high intensity skilling methods like the M&amp;S rework, Cache, deep sea fishing, and safecracking. This just goes to show RS3 devs cares more about skilling than OSRS devs.

---
One thing you hit on at the start that is often overlooked is the feedback loop. This problem is embodied in a lot of different ways. For example, there are a lot of players that want skilling to be more profitable but others oppose that since they see skilling as easy. I think most would agree that chopping Magic Trees shouldn't be 1M per hour, but that doesn't mean Woodcutting shouldn't get a 1M per hour method; it just can be hard for some to envision that since we currently have nothing like that for Woodcutting. But if you mention a tougher boss with more profit, you'd have more to draw from that makes it easier to understand.
---
For the "3 Pillars", I'd say there is already a fourth. Resources were just lumped into one category, but Skilling Resources are different from PvM or General Resources. Items like Herbs, Seeds, Runes, and Hides may be obtainable from Skilling, but they PvM has always been a source of them; sometimes before they came from Skilling. We also can create new PvM Resources with Zulrah Scales being a good example, but you could also consider that a Unique.
---
Anyway, I like this draft of the Catalysts better. I still think the problem tends to be more with drop tables that overdo it than skilling resources in general, but I'd be all for replacing some of those resources, not all of them, with a 2x item. Though, I would prefer them to be a tad more unique or more generic. By that I mean it still feels a bit out of place to have multiple types of Hatchet Oil and I'd rather it be a more unique item for each tree than "same thing, dif box" or just a singular "Hatchet Oil" that worked on most trees; perhaps with the chance of bonus logs scaled per tree even. That would also open up the possibility of more creative bonuses than just 2x every time while still making them an increase to resources.
---
Trinkets are an interesting idea on how to improve the boosters. I kinda like the "storing the skilling outfit" part to allow for more outfits; if only the same could be done for Graceful... Though I feel like some of the functionality could be given to existing item or done without a new type of ore. For example, I'd love to see the return of Tackleboxes instead of a "Fishing Trinket"; it could do the same thing of storing the outfit and boosters, perhaps also bait, but it would be more fitting than a platinum pendant with a fish on it. If you went that route, each item could have its own quest or they could be added to existing content like Aerial Fishing or Trawler.
---
As for Variety and variation, that is certainly something skilling lacks. It does have some variety with training methods; if you're getting bored of one you can go do another that plays a bit differently. But most training methods still have that simplistic design without much excitement. One thing I've always wanted to see was more RNG Rewards when skilling. My go-to example would be stuff like the Pharaoh's Sceptre; it is rare enough to be sought but not so rare it seems unreasonable to get and it is a nice surprise when training at Plunder. Even if it isn't gameplay variety like the diversions you described with Trawler, rare rewards like those can go a long way. Like, imagine if there was a rare chance when mining to get a new unique gem instead of the normal gems. Or that a Bird's Nests from Woodcutting and only Woodcutting would have a unique ring inside. Even if these things are only 500-1000K, they would still be a nice surprise to help skilling feel more interesting. More varied gameplay would also be great to see, but I think that is better done with new methods than changing the existing ones. That said, I would be all for some diversions like that for Mermaid Agility.

What is the step?
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think as you say, minigames, much like skills, have a lot of scope for improvement on both the reward &amp; gameplay fronts. Some of them already do some really neat little things that could just do with a further nudge in terms of reward or profitability, while others could do with a fair bit of TLC from a design level. 
---
Some of the points you make, especially about CW &amp; BA are very good. Encouraging &amp; incentivising a positive style of gameplay that plays towards the objective and rewards active participants is definitely a big thing that should be kept at the forefront.

---
Folks, please read this and understand it. SlayerScape is more than a meme, SlayerScape represents the design path Jagex follows that eventually leads to what happened in RuneScape 3 - a path they went down before.
---
"What exactly happened in RuneScape 3"? Jagex sees Slayer is popular, that people want to train it, because it's rewarding, so they buff it so it remains fresh for people, making them want to train it, because now its even more rewarding, hey so many people are doing this specific piece of content, maybe we should buff it...
---
That leads to the issue where RuneScape 3 has literally hundreds of Slayer mobs with profits exceeding 1m+/hr, which isn't much right? Until you compare Slayer to other areas of the game, neglected areas of the game.
---
I mean shit, RuneScape 3 still has entire skills that are completely abandoned, outdated in design and barely touched since 2001. OSRS has a way more satisfying construction, agility and hunter skill. Entire parts of the game go ignored yet somehow in 2016-2017 they had new slayer monsters almost every other month. It was ridiculous, if not a new slayer mob a new boss. 
---
You can like Slayer, nobody says you can't. But if we allow Jagex to prioritize Slayer, keep dropping QoL items in the reward store and consistently making higher and stronger mobs with better loot, the chase is never going to stop. Eventually we will have 5m/hr slayer mobs while no other skill except Runecrafting can break 1m. Hell, or they'll just make a slayer mob that drops 100 noted nature runes every kill, and RCing will die alongside all the others.

You don't need additional incentives to skill like "resource boosters", the resources themselves (ore, fish, logs, etc) should be the incentive. It really is as simple as removing the mass amounts of resources you get through bosses. This has the effect as resource boosters but doesn't introduce a lot more resources into the game.

Regardless I am very happy this design is being implemented but, I feel like I should at least receive partial credit for the design since I came up with the idea so many years earlier.

Though this is well thought out, I don‚Äôt think it would change the economy at all. Now if the catalysts offered something like resources to be noted, this would be very different, since it would also give an exp advantage to having catalysts. The thing that messed up the rs3 economy with a similar idea was only because they were tradeable. Adding them as drops could hurt ironmen though if they are trying to get something like sharks before having a high fishing lvl. Overall I don‚Äôt think there is a way to implement this and make everyone happy, but then being unreadable would probably be better and would encourage pvmers to do some skilling for more gp
---
So don‚Äôt go in the wildy then I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt get it, before jumping the wall, crater, hole whatever it is in whatever iteration of RuneScape you‚Äôre playing it gives you a warning saying you should expect to die.

The community loves to meme about how terribly dull certain pieces of content are (***RUNECRAFT BAD***), but very rarely do we get conversations about what we could actually do to make them fun without just making them easier or faster. 
---
I think a balance exists somewhere, so there are always options &amp; choices to make, without fundamentally eroding away at the core Old-School feel &amp; style of gameplay. 
---
The issue RS3 is having is that RS3 is very top heavy. Few new players arriving which means the demand for low tier ore is practically non-existent to anyone other than alchers. When 90% of players have 99 mining and smithing and can do PvM for triple the profits per hour, they don't give a shit about mithril ore and gold ore because its useless to anyone who passes 30 smithing. So their endgame bosses dropping mithril and addy stone spirits is ofc going to be totally worthless. If they started dropping the tier 80/90 stone spirits itd be a different story.

I won't pretend to know how to game-design, but I can give my test for "bad content": Difficulty to bot. This isn't a perfect measure, and someone will always find a way to make a bot that outperforms humans at any task eventually, but there are a few cases where this works great:
---
Dead-Reckoning bot: Any bot using only a series of screen space commands, ex. click pixel x,y. This covers the most braindead content with no meaningful choice. Skills include Prayer, some Magic training, Runecrafting (mostly, excluding dangerous routes), Construction, Agility, Herblore, Crafting, Fletching, Cooking, Firemaking (outside WT)
---
Dead Reckoning++: Dead reckoning plus a few basic checks (still screenspace, ex. is this region red for health, or is region brown for tree, etc.). This makes a lot of other skills, like thieving, fishing, mining pretty much completely trivial. This wouldn't include reading tile state, just braindead pixel reading. 
---
Your trawler idea is fun because it's not that trivial. It gives players the opportunity to make VALUE JUDGEMENT decisions, assuming events aren't necessarily one-at-a-time. It seems very much like FTL, which isn't very mechanically complex but is very engaging due to the decisions that the player needs to make.
---
Other ways to beat trivial bots can help enjoyment, ex. complicated, dynamic balancing acts (enough simple things that it starts to look complex), and making players react to more random things (ex. Jad).
---

---
Mine now
---
Everybody has to keep in mind that there‚Äôs still a huge amount of mining resources in people‚Äôs banks. Once the demand goes back up, people will start using up the stone spirits. 
---
I honestly think the best way to revitalize skilling would be to make it some how synergistic with PvM. For instance- we do medium clue scrolls for chances at rangers which are augmented to make BiS range boots, along with having immense swag factor. I think skilling could have similar types of augments for weapons. 
---
A really cursory example would be ultra rare (but not pet rare- maybe 1/5k-10k per resource gathered) components that can augment weapons. If you were wood cutting you could find a shaft of wood from the first age which could augment a MSB or create a new type of bow/limbs, and this weapon could be tier 75 but less niche than twisted bow or scythe or the absolute best PvM weapons, but instead provide an accessible weapon variant for PvMers who cannot yet afford the ultra expensive weapons. 
---
This is similar to how chaotics were widely available weapons that players could use to boss, and dungeoneering promoted skilling due to being able to complete dungeon floors more quickly. I don‚Äôt think by any means these weapons should be chaotics, I just think they could serve the same type of utility as accessible and powerful bossing weapons, while also promoting the skilling to obtain them.
---
Another example could be fishing which could rarely give you shark leather which could be used for range armor less accurate than arma but perhaps providing better defensive stats or a recoil chance (shark scales are sharp when rubbed the wrong way)
---
Anyways, I‚Äôm sure a ton more ideas could be thought of, I just think maybe finding uniques that help with PvM and pking could promote skilling more than enhancing the gathering rate itself. With these updates enough players would be skilling that enhancing gathering rates might lead to a bit of oversupply. Let me know what you think!

People like pvm because it's varied and has meaningful choices to make. It's also very rewarding so there's a positive feedback loop where some players spend all their time killing monsters and the devs see all these players killing monsters and think that's all the players want to do, so pvm gets more rewards and more variety while skilling is left in the dirt.
---
Part of the problem is that skilling itself is boring to a lot of people, so they avoid it until they are "forced" to do skilling, at which point they complain because it's boring, tedious, and unrewarding compared to pvm. A possible solution is to replace a certain amount of resources on drop tables with resource boosters, which would help make skilling more profitable while not significantly decreasing the profit from pvm. Making skilling more rewarding doesn't fix the problem of it being boring though, so copying some designs from slayer like superior creatures, and rare drops could also help make skilling more interesting.
---
Not a part of the post, but I think it's relevant to discuss how polls hurt some parts of the game. The devs seem unwilling to design content that is interesting or varied when it comes to skilling, partly because previous designs like artisan have been shot down when it came to a poll, and updates that increase xp rates are similarly difficult to pass through a poll. This creates a negative feedback loop where the devs don't want to spend much time designing or developing new skilling methods because the community will vote it down, making all of the devs hard work come to nothing.
---
It seems like recently there has been a bit of turnaround when it comes to polls though, where the community is willing to vote for anything that makes the game easier/faster, including skilling methods. This creates another problem for the devs where they have to be very careful not to poll things that will make old content obsolete.

so if you started with 90 crafting you would be ok with that? if all you care about is personal restriction just play a non ironman account as if you are an ironman and let yourself buy crafting from your main, since like you said who cares that you cheated on the level since you just care about obtaining the fury itself on your own or whatever it may be.

They should make a little quest that features Slayermusiq as your helper
---
In a sense, but if you break the pre-established rules for the game then you've lost.
---
This isn't necessarily true, take spectral wyverns for example. Requires a quest that requires other skills to complete. Any monster in the slayer tower is locked behind priest in peril, ect.
---
running a blowpipe for an hour costs 2k scales, plus an insignificant amount of addy darts.

so its around like 250k an attempt.

twice as fast isn't a little faster.
---
&gt;And I have 75 Defense but was getting shredded by healers, like 10 damage every 5 seconds
---
do you have your defense pray on? defense pot from scb?
---
inferno healers do a lot of damage and they hit FAR more accurately and like twice as hard and you can still just facetank them just fine.
---
Skilling should be a profitable alternative. I find skilling boring so I kill monsters, and use the gp I get to buy sharks, potions, gear etc. And there should be a balance to this.
---
But you fail to address my point which is about how they design drop tables for like hardly any profit but with tiny chance of rare item 50m.
---
I'm not mad, I don't even agree with the response. But it seems you have issues with comprehension. The topic of contention is 'precedence' not 'reaction' to an event. I don't know how to explain this in anymore of a simpler manner..

---
Good ted talk
---
Um, alright? I don't understand what that nearly universal truth has to do with what I was currently telling the other guy.
---
I completely agree. It seems to me that a lot of people complaining about skilling being boring are playing on accounts that are already at endgame levels in a lot of aspects. This means that those people have already achieved high levels in most skills. I don't think that skilling really needs to be changed because there are plenty of incentives for players to reach high levels in most skills.
---
A large portion of the playerbase has already done that and now complains about skilling being pointless whilst ignoring the fact that they have already spent countless hours skilling to reach the point they're at.
---
Once you max in a skilling based game it's only logical that you then move to different content, since the whole point of skilling is to reach new levels and unlock more content.
---

---
I see that you touch upon changing the landscape of the game and hindering the nostalgia aspect, which I agree with.  But at the same time that aspect is already fleeting for me and most of the community.  The game has already drifted a greater distance than EoC to RS2 in the first place in terms of time without the combat (and now smithing) overhauls.
---
For the sake of saving 07's economy and integrity I feel that this would be a great move.  True 07scape is sadly dead and we're at another point in time for a warp back to the golden age of RuneScape.
---
Any game will need consistent changes and updates.  We're all fortunate to have a game over a decade old preserved so long.
---
Not really about ehp, the biggest problem with konar droptable was that its overpowered and goes against jagex's stance for the past couple weeks.
---
Attempting to raise brew prices by nerfing birdhouses and removing nests from boss drops, then making a 2500 brew drop?
---
Making it so killing a hellhound drops 2500 brews or 200 torstols? You can't say thats not overpowered. It legit felt like a private server.
---
Sometimes things aren't about being ehp its about how it affects the game's feel.
---
I'm not an ehp nerd, I've literally never 3 tickd or 2 ticked or whatever it is ANYTHING at all. But the konar drop table on release felt horrible for the game to me.
---
The way it is now with the nerfed droptable and the keys isntead of just dropping 200 ranarrs on the ground feels much more acceptable and if how it is now was how it was released I think more people would have been fine with it.
---
Can you not see?

Those monsters for Fishing Thrawler remind me of Ultima Online and its sea creatures. I love it.

I submitted an account recovery for an old account I used to have. How long does it take for Jagex to review an account recovery request?
---
Oh no, I didn't suspect you of stealing the design at all! Of course my initial reaction was that maybe it's possible you did come across my post... But then I thought about it some more, and it doesn't seem too far fetched that we both came up with a similar design. I was a bit hurt seeing all of the success at first, and I was kind of stressing a lot over it because I wasn't sure what to do... I was really afraid of how you'd react to my response, but it's so reassuring seeing how kind and reasonable you are being about all of this. I really appreciate you trying to make things right, and hopefully we'll be able to come up with a fair solution to all of this. 
---
I guess the only thing I ask of you is to try and update me on what's going on regarding this situation, just so I'm not in the dark. Thank you so much again for being so considerate and understanding about all of this. 
---
Rangers on 27. Just get em man.
---
No don't think so, you might get some cash off woodcutting to help you.
---
ur birthgiver i give her my willy :P
---
Lmao you dont even need sony vegas to be a clip channel you could just use a free one
---
No I only have 2 minutes to play every 3 months please add this to the game so I can get max cape
---
&gt; One thing I've always wanted to see was more RNG Rewards when skilling.
---
RS3 has this with Seren spirits, geodes, and fire spirits.

Dont get it

70-80 agility is a blur to me. I don't even remember doing it. It eventually gets so boring that your brain just deletes the memory.

Need more Aus pmods imo. Only ever seen one and there are so many bots/scammers/spammers its nuts.
---
Shits 120m, my bank is 110m
---
This is the highest my non combat stats have ever been lol. Ive had plenty of 99s in combat stats back in the day but everything i did was PvP related or for staking so the skilling thing is still new to me. 
---
I do want to work on my 94 mage grind though so i heard mm2 is really the only efficient way for bursting. Gonna knock out the thieving quick and probably do mm2 tomorrow unless I'm awake enough tonight! 
---
Btw - ive done the balloon transport quest..how exactly do i "unlock" the gnome route or whatever it says is needed? Do i need to do something special for that? 
---
Had to put on my glasses for this one, good read lad.
---
You can block the big one with the small one.
---
I mean you're just wrong
---
zeah rc with souls is ~40-45k xp an hour, and ~200-250k gp an hour.
---
That's quite horrible xp and horrible money.
---
I'm fine with it and I'd rather do it over lavas despite lavas being almost double the xp rate, but you can't possibly claim its good xp and money.
---
Wait what happened? When was this? Is there a video I can watch?
---
i don't mean to be rude but i cbf to read any of this cx

What's click bait about it ??? I was amazed by the high alch value and how much it turned out to be and I did open 50 brimstone keys so what was click bait?
---
That's kinda terrible lol. 
---
&gt;I don't know where you're getting this from
---
the blowpipe uses 2k scales for an hour of constantly using it and 600 darts.
---
on task w/ good range level a fight caves run is 30 minutes, thus uses 1k scales and 300 darts. Maybe a bit more, depends on how slow your runs are.
---
&gt;there's absolutely no way I could've just tanked that damage unless I had way more healing and less restores or full Karil's or something
---
look, you can go and watch any vid on youtube of jad, youll find all the main accounts tank them just fine. for pures they lure them or kill them but ofc 1 def is different.
---
support
---
but you gotta build your own circuitboards with NAND gates like one of those clue map puzzles or minigames
---
I do not have a herb sack sadly.

Found out my significant was a cheater recently too. I feel you brother. I found that it actually helps more to do slayer and scream their name as you deliver righteous justice to the scum of Gielinor. YOU LIKE BLACK DICK ALISE SUCK ON THIS ROCK HAMMER WHY DONT YOU LOVE ME

Second of all,

I didn't give anyone anything.

Third of all,

Is it not Jagex that suggests you put an authenticator on your account? Don't you need to go to the RS website to activate it?
---
I have a job, a family, and a life ...
---
I did it for the first time last week and thought it was pretty damn easy. 
---
I first watched /u/silvenx's [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDsaVV_SiKk&amp;t=342s) which helped a ton and then got it in 3 attempts. 
---
My main strat at Jad was continuously saying his attacks outloud. This helped me a TON.
---
Thank you, mate. It is actually a bunch of armor styles from some animes, mashed up around that lance (I wanted to draw a good lance, so I measured the shit out of it). Slap up a zamorak style symbol on the chest and bam! Also the shield which I liked to perceive as a dfs.
---
You're not even that dry. Isn't necklace 1/1k and the rest 1/5k (pet 1/3k)
---
This should apply to all games, not just Runescape.
---
If you don't have time to play, don't.
---
&gt; Yes they make the skill easier, but they're not absurd xp.
---
Yes, those are good examples. I don't really see the point of ZMI though. It's so similar to existing methods that's it's literally just functioning as a higher xp replacement for the most part. I don't think that's the right way to go. Zeah RC had that part solved, but it had another massive issue of being way too afk for the xp rates it offers. Better than all but the best xp rates and it's the lowest effort of all the methods in the skill. That's not a healthy balance.

---
Wow! Top quality suggestion! Thanks for taking the time to put this together! :D
---
Your argument is compelling! My, I‚Äôve never heard so many strong counter points before
---
It would be an aggressive punch. So the same str bonus as kick, just with your fists. And each attack you yell "deez fists" with maximum YEETness. 
---

---
The game is fine how it is
---
Now we‚Äôre having drama about drama. Does it ever end on this subreddit?
---
We could go without the slayer updates...
---
Also DMM might be the best promotion for the game right now, but I imagine a more accessible, less-grindy, more skill-expressive, and easier-to-watch tournament/esport would be a much better promotion. DMM is 50% grinding your ass off, 30% having a clan, and 20% pking skills. Castle wars tournaments on an unrestricted world would be far more interesting, easier to watch, and would showcase coordination and skill much more effectively imo.
---
So what? Why do you care about progressing faster? You're literally complaining that it was nicer when you were lower level and now you say you want to be even higher level? Why? Surely, that's completely counter-intuitive?
---
&gt;Tick manipulation requires thinking
---
It doesn't, at all. It's a clever use of game mechanics, but once you learn it, it's just muscle memory (and patience to keep doing it for hours non stop), there's 0 thinking. I never once saw tick manipulation as somehow more engaging than just AFKing, it's just more repetitive clicking without anything different or unpredictable happening.

Because Member's Items are untradeable on F2P Worlds and they've yet to rework that system to be otherwise.
---
Imo they should let new accounts start with all skills at 99 because it's not fair to those people who play casually.

You answered your own question. Fork over that $11 or wallow in your stash of members objects.
---
Should‚Äôve gotten banned, you‚Äôre apart of the SCUM of osrs. Fuck you and everything you do
---
The maxe already gives good loot and u often get like 10 gems from molly and the troll. Don‚Äôt think we need to update rewards
---
At the moment when you log into osrs your character gets a temporary id number that lasts until you log out/switch worlds. They wanted to rewrite this system so that the player ids won‚Äôt change allowing them to more effectively link people together.
---
For instance they could technically add group Ironman at the moment with the current system. The problem is once one of them logs out/hops they would no longer be recognized as a part of the group since the system links players by their player ids and that players is will have changed.
---
You could lure the healers over to you into a safespot to avoid dealing with Jad while killing them, but this is likely more trouble than it's worth. I never hear of non-pures safespotting, even newbies
---
One more thing, but it's a bit risky: once you tag all the healers, you can actually run directly through Jad and trap all the healers on the other side, completely neutralizing them without wasting time killing them. This should be done with caution though, as Jad can melee you if timed poorly. That doesn't necessarily mean an instant death, however
---
Rig is a tool. Dude talks about "fucking your mum" all the time when someone asks a legit question. Wouldn't be shocked if he was a virgin.

god damn pet + head already, gratz tho!

You should be fine then dude. Just remember that no legit website will ask for your email/password/pin including third party client cites like runelite. Anyone who wants you to ‚Äúlogin‚Äù to your account is phishing

Picking flax or running law runes are your best bets.

Then max in another 5 years instead? That would result in being maxed by playing an hour and 20 minutes every Saturday and Sunday and not playing in the weekdays at all.
---
Or don't max at all and set reasonable goals for yourself instead of going for the same goals as the streamers who play 6+ hours a day?
---
How is this even a problem?
---
Wow, I just have to say you can definitely tell you put a lot of thought and analysis of different things in creating this post. I see a lot of good in it and appreciate the effort you put into making this graphic. Well done!
---
Nice 
---
Personally, I think the catalyst should move the extra item into the bank, this would allow the time spent at a fishing spot for example be the same, where as with this you would have to bank twice as often.
---
3x faster buckets of sand != 3x faster xp/hr

If you want something to binge I enjoyed gunschilli‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn debt for a pet‚Äù series. It kind of over now but there are quite a lot of episodes and his videos always have top notch editing.
---
Kinda annoying they gave the two Ironman NPCs to the two streamers who didn't actually start the iron man thing in osrs.. 
---
Yes, people think the fight caves are easy.  
---
No, a single botched prayer swap alone won't kill you at any point. Hell, even with mediocre stats you don't have to pray swap during the regular fight caves until Jad (Just throw on prot from mage and tank + kill the rangers first while kiting around the meleer if that's giving you an issue). For Jad, you can always stay brewed up to the point you can't get 1 shot... Or if you KNOW you missed a pray flick and could die, then tick eating is always an option.
---
A) Yes, you have to prayer swap for every attack. If you're new or in a position where you can't see Jad, it's easy to default to protect from range then swap to mage if you hear a sound right away (since the range sound is delayed a bit). Once you're familiar with Jad it's easy enough to tell from the animations alone. Seriously, once the anxiety wears off and you attempt it calmly it's really not hard at all.
---
B) Not really. You shouldn't be taking any damage (Well, very little once healers spawn, but we'll get to that later) so you only need to pot if you're running low on prayer... Which Jad is easy enough to kill that you can just sip up to full before the fight and normally have enough pray to last you.
---
C) Pretty much, except you don't have to run around Jad. Just get all the healers on you (and none stuck behind Jad), wait for an attack, pray against it, throw on prot from melee, then run straight through Jad and get ready to pray v.s. his next attack.
---
D) Nope, just either get them set up in a line (if running through Jad sounds too intense for you) so only one healer can hit you, or get them all on you then run straight through Jad (So they'll be trying to attack you instead of healing Jad, but be stuck on the other side of Jad and do neither)
---
Really it's just a matter of practice and staying calm. The latter is the hardest part.
---
Bro, that‚Äôs a textbook clickbait title.

Quest, fully quest. Use the req for the quests as a guideline of progression. Then go from there.
---
It's an example of an active minigame that mid-level players and 45 def pures come back to for a fighter torso. Heck, 45 def pures RELY on this one minigame for the torso.
---
Fighter torso offers +4 strength bonus, the same as a 65 def 10m+ chestplate dropped rarely by a God Wars dungeon boss. BA gives some pretty strong rewards.
---
No, there's nothing to rethink here, you brainlet.
---
Look at the video tittle and the thumbnail tittle no click bait in it &gt;.&lt; but ok sorry it bothered u so much friend 
---
look at your junk mail
---
I've always hated that the meta for pretty much all of the Wilderness bosses, a long drawn out process of luring a boss to an obscure  safespot that is often times a pain in the ass to setup. I feel like by definition a boss fight should be engaging and challenging, not safespotting and hope no PKers wander by.
---
How do you access this
---
So do fun minigames, with actual rewards. The rewards don't even have to be op, then can be 1/10 of zulra gp/hr and people would probably still do them. I like LMS and castle wars, but nobody does them because you get *nothing*. 
---
Definitely a malicious tone with his edit.
---
They simply shouldn't *share* resources. So that there is always a point in doing fishing other than xp. (say you're an ironman and need food, fishing should be the solution). - This is true for any resource and any skill: skills should all have their own specific resource type they are best at for supplying, with some sideline resources you also give.
---
Smithing should give the best melee weaponry and armor, fishing unprocessed food, fletching best range weaponry, crafting best magic gear and range armor.
---
Then combat falls into it as the goal of those resources: we should do combat for points on the ladder it is for *using* resources you earned through skilling.
---
&gt; every other tom, dick, and harry
---
Then we should add a recolour to the rune cbow instead. That's what those 3 guys use. DHCB is already rather rare so you don't see it everywhere anyway.
---
Melee tank gear and use magic. Iban blast slayer dart etc
---

Thanks I hate it
---
Why guess its in the chat
---
i literally said its basically half of lavas, which is relative to the skill. Lavas = lava rune crafting.
---
It however would need some policing from jagex to make people actually play the game. Instead of having it dominate by clans who "trade" supplies (and actively hunt people who do not follow this trading).
---
Spammer, scammer, beggar ...
---
Same shit different name
---
Are you not meant to pick up the two blue dragonhide vorkath drops? I have since I usually will have 1-2 empty spots after 4 kills and run out of food.
---
Unpopular opinion perhaps?...  New content shouldn't really ever specifically cater to new or casual players.  The existing content is available to them.  Not saying that new content shouldn't be accessible by them, just not catered.
---
Bucket of sand is not a secondary. Crafting is not herblore.
---
Why are you moving the goal posts suddenly? Before, the 12.5k and 74k was definitely the wrong numbers, but now that you realise that they're correct and you make up some logic to explain why it's fine?
---
Dude I'm in NZ too, and I get 300-400ms ping in **our** world. The lowest i can get is w51, which is around 140ms ping.

Extremely high quality post. 
---
I would love to see this, but as a reward for Dungeoneering. In my mind dungeoneering could work well not as a skill, but as a mid-max overall level game. A big focus to this would be the necessity to have a higher overall level (all skills, not a focus on combat) in order to be most efficient. I think giving these as a direct reward from it and making it a reasonable money making method - hopefully comperable to slayer, but like base 50 skills would make similar money to lvl 70 slayer, and stays somewhat consistent with it.
---
Now, all of skilling is more profitable, which makes miserable skills like runecrafting or mining can be activities that people actually want to do after a bunch of slayer tasks in a row.
---
and also. Stealing Creation plz.
---
And what we do you think brings more attention then an event getting tens of thousands of views on the front page of Twitch?
---
Lmfaooooooooooooo
---
been doing herbiboar since 77 hunter, currently 97. Started doing redwood birdhouses at like 89 or 90 hunter because I thought why not. So far, the exp is ok, an extra 4800 every 50 minutes (every hour for me because im lazy). Good money though. I buy premade birdhouses in the ge for around 1.5kea, and all you need is 4 of them and 40 hops seeds, no hammer or chisel or clockwork. You'll always get a clockwork back (worth 1k) and at least 1 bird nest, so the houses pay for themselves immediately.
---
I mean, yeah, but Jagex security is also trash. 
---
Oh :(
---
purpp is probably my favourite atm when hes streaming solo

Now that OSRS is blowing up on mobile, can I ask that you bring back the funny Postbag from the Hedge and other lore like in the old days? To me and many players, that silly stuff was awesome.
---
I see my nephew playing this game and just hate how it is all about efficiency
---
BTW you can tell where jad will be on wave 3 I'm pretty sure it's where the first 45 spawns

If you have the inventory space then pick them up

---
Okay I respect the hard work on this. However this was a MASSIVE topic on RS3, and I know it's quite big on OSRS too. My goal is to just explain how this update could realistically play out.
---
Let's take a look at sharks. In your example you talk about lowering the amount of shark brought into the game through PVM by 10%, and to recoup that same amount through skilling. What happens to the price of sharks? Well they COULD go up. Shark supply drops by roughly 10%. However if the resource boosters ARE USED the shark supply essentially goes up anywhere from 0-10%. So you are looking at a potential increase, or decrease in the amount of sharks by -10% to +10% depending on how many new shark fishers become attracted to this.
---
So how many shark fishers become attracted? Well sharks are currently 656 gp each and 130 catches per hour coming out to 85k profit per hour. You are proposing to double this output/rate (with an added gp investment). That mean sharks come in at roughly no more profit than (drum roll please) 170k profit per hour! However that's if those boosters are 1 gp. The more they cost, the less you make. 
---
Listen, my point is. Cutting yews/magics or fishing lobsters and sharks are nostalgic. But they have NEVER been good money making. Even in those noob days they were semi viable at best. The problem runs SOOO much deeper than PVM drops. Initial fishing speeds are EXTREMELY problematic. If you really wanted balance, tweaking both of those things is the solution. Adding a booster that dampens gp/hr of an already shit method is piss poor design. And it certainly doesn't create balance. PVM gets the rewards it does because it's reqs, risk, game knowledge, and mechanics NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY ARE. Imagine wanting a singular skill like level 70 fishing to be competitive with multiple level 70 combat stats and mid level slayer. It's not fair. 
---
If you want skilling to be rewarding, Jagex and the community need to create high level skilling content with multiple requirements. Can you imagine a highly useful item locked behind a deep chasm mine that required 70 agility, 70 mining, and 70 thieving? Few players could participate as the investment would easily rival combats investment, and the gp per hour would stay high. Stop trying to force value into bits of content that are purely nostalgic. Sharks have never been meta and for good reason. Skilling needs multiple reqs and can't be afk if you expect more rewards from it. Any other design is flawed
---
i mean its technically 1m/ehp, not many methods are that good when you arent 70 in any stat
---
Just because you've been around since 2002 doesn't mean that you're immune from making bad decisions and getting your account details stolen.

As for an explanation of the price differential, this is often caused by an under informed or misinformed consumer base. Prices will stabilize as soon as the correct information becomes more widely accepted.

Don't leak your IP. That's your responsibility. Jagex servers are fine now.  BUT on the reason people do it because it was profitable? just make it so no one gets the items then. both problems solved.

tldr: this game is not getting better.

Yeah I get that, but if the f2p market dies, we will never see new players, the community will die, f2p has to hook the player to make them want p2p, and in f2p with out browsing reddit its mostly dead and full of bots I see no content in f2p that tells me that p2p is worth my $11, back in 2006 I saw reasons to get membership, yet the game was just as fun in f2p.

Personally I can't live without RuneLite's feature that shows prices of items on the ground (both GE and HA) so I can avoid picking worthless tat. Also, showing prices of items in the inventory/bank on hover.

much better. I just got 72 mining and there's a huge difference in "afkness" between a guaranteed 15-25 seconds of mining vs the frustration of only getting 1 pay dirt from an ore vein while you're away

Newbie Melody I believe its called? Or Harmony..
---
I really like the booster and trinket idea. My one big issue with how you have proposed it is the outfit storage. First of all, it defeats the object of it being an outfit, and second of all, it would not return fashionscape to skilling, it would just lead to more people wearing graceful. I say this as a member of /r/fashionscape. I actually like the idea of storing outfits in the trinket, I just don't think we should continue to get the 2.5% xp boost whilst it's in there.
---
I'm also a massive fan of your Fishing Trawler idea and I think it opens up a huge amount of content for other skills to have similar challenging mini-games.
---
What do you unlock from getting 200m xp?

I got lucky for every boss on the game I've done and went under drop rate. Every Slayer drop off got hard dry on. I was at 7k or so for whip like 4k for mask.

Why not both?

Isn't he on the spectrum a little bit? I vaguely remember someone saying something like that or something

What I think you illustrate quite nicely here is the importance of variability. To me, that is the most important feature which makes PvM inherently more interesting than skilling in the current state of the game: variability in how to approach a PvM challenge in gear and stats, variability in strategies with varying amounts of intensity, skill, and supplies required, varying amounts of risk, and most importantly of all, highly variable reward. There are very few skilling activities in the game which yield variable rewards, with maybe Farming being the only exception. I do believe that adding variable rewards with a degree of randomness that scales with your performace in a skilling activity can be a very easy way to make skilling more interesting.

The thing is, that can go wrong too. Maybe not so applicable to minigames, but the concept behind something like minnows is simply horrendous to me. While it's great to reward performance rather than simply doing anything, given how efficiency-oriented people are in this game it can also end up feeling like a punishment. The performance has to be fun and not too intensive. Otherwise, similar to x-tick fishing/powermining/etc, you can choose the punishment of intensive, boring performance or the punishment of lost efficiency.

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescapes biggest challenges, the Theatre of Blood.

Why are rune arrows suddenly all jacked up in price in the past few days? Is there a new update? 
---
Did you buy a tonne of gem bags or what?
---
In my own opinion, if the grind itself is based off of rng that isn't tick based (tick based meaning rng that is based on how many ticks it takes to obtain; IE the ticks it takes to cut a log or mine an ore), then it is not part of the  "repeatedly obtainable, intentionally grindable action" (which I really think needs reworded or given exceptions in the rules). Therefore, his grind to get 13 crafting for the jade and his grind to get to steel is acceptable because the grind itself does not require rng. In ShapersB's original question, he states that the grind itself is the rng therefore it should not be considered a  "repeatedly obtainable, intentionally grindable action". 
---
I'm currently doing this challenge myself and that is the clarification I've made for myself. There are also per activity exceptions that I feel must be made to keep this mode entertaining. Such as the WC 99 cape. That grind would be insufferable with a steel axe. I'm not sure how to define that as anything other than "cross that road when we get there". And in these video's, Pooka may have to state these exceptions per zone when also detailing his goals.

yes, but zulrah dropping 50 kwarm doesnt really help compared to him dropping 3-4 kwarm seeds

Hello Mr Mammal
---
The problem isnt about money.  The whole thing is that most people find cutting magic logs for money incredibly tedious slow and boring so when boring skilling becomes the only way to get materials, bots take over.  Pvm is varied and more fun for most people, and harder to do with bots so skilling drops from them make it so resources come into the game in a timely fashion without relying fully on bots.  Osrs isnt the same as it was in 2007 when thousands of 10 year olds were fully entertained running essence to air altars for 2k each.  People want efficient and engaging things to do for fun and being forced to cut magic logs for hours is not most peoples ideas of fun.  If magic logs were similar $$ to tob or zulrah, then bots would wreck the economy.  For the most part bots (and some alts) are the economies answer to poor or outdated game design.  If you want to cut magic logs all day go ahead, but if you think that making them worth 100k each will make people enjoy cutting them any more than bots well you are probably wrong.
---
Well, I'd say red is more of a religious nut/troll more than a ~~buzzword~~ 'conspiracy theorist'.
---
This looks like it took a tremendous amount of time and effort. Very well put together my friend! I love the suggestion, definitely like the motivation for people to actually skill a bit more rather than nuke npcs all day. 
---
I personally do not agree with all of the BiS gear that keeps getting polled into the game. It's going to be a fucking nightmare in a few years. Although I hope I am very wrong, we're going to have t90 items like rs3 before long. I'd very much like to see more variety rather than 'next best thing'. 
---
Yeah, that's old news and very tame information though.
---
To be fair what do u think rc should be if not rcing lmao

People get bored quickly once they do a skill for more than a few hours. You make it seem like there's so much content out there that isn't artificially padded by grotesque ("nostaligic" thus somehow "good") time lengthening tactics.

As for OP /u/821837 , I'll PM you my account screeny (2000+ total) if you want.

There is no reason some things need to exist in the current form they do. Nostalgia can be had on private servers, the OSRS we have today is far removed from the game of old. From merching, to player tendencies, etc... Nostalgia is like a collectors' drug inductor, you're always chasing it, it's never actually achieved outside of brief instances of de ja vu if you're lucky, everything else is just fleeting memory that's been slightly refreshed. I'm not saying the game needs to be turned inside out and made to be RS3 (there should be non-negotiable things from the starting inception of this version of the game, things like graphic fidelity for instance should NEVER be changed drastically).
---
As for the people you're addressing OP... those "but I got kids/work/wife/life" I fully agree with you there in principle. But not everyone that wants QoL changes or XP rate shifts, is one of these insane people. But your retort can be simpler to those morons. Just tell them not to play the game. People play games for enjoyment, if you don't have time to play a game, why would you care if the game takes 10 hours to get everything in it, or 100.. If you can't enjoy the game due to time, you can't enjoy it simply put. 
---
So at least there I agree OP.

Actually (slowly) working on a suggestion for something I call - no joke - the Artisan's Guild that is exactly what you guys are talking about. Stay tuned!

Is it worth swapping out dragon boots for devout boots? I'm kinda guessing the strength bonus is negligible compared to the prayer bonus of the devouts.

There was a YouTube video recently talking about afk ranged training and the guy was using rune arrows. It might be that? Not sure though

A bit extreme even for my tastes. Last thing you want is for even 5% of those people to be random trolls that abuse the system and mute people just because they don't care and find that fun (and don't care about actually having mod status and are simply abusing it for as long as they can for entertainment).
---
While 1,000 player mods might be nice. I hope it's done not completely random. Some pre-conditions need to be used as a filter if we're going to make that many people player mods THAT quickly.
---
(I would know, I was falsely moderated twice by player mod(s) back in 2011 and once in like 2008 if I recall)
---
Really wish that was the case, we need more uses for tank items like Ely, Spectral, Justiciar, Bulwark etc.
---
Imagine a powerful special attack from a group boss that requires one player to shield other party members behind his Bulwark: "Line up boys!"
---
Have a boss that drains prayer insanely fast and only a Spectral would help against it.
---
Oh well, maybe in the future...

In 99% of cases you‚Äôll want to opt for the highest dps possible. So go with dragon

No surprise that a scummy scammer/RWTer is a Dovydas fan.

TBH I think the problem is that people come to *oldschool runescape* expecting fun and engaging content. Runescape used to be literally characterized by long tedious grinds if you wanted to get to high levels. It's a novel concept having anything to do that's very engaging.

my milk example is concrete.  gallon at $5.  half-gallon at $7.50, in what world does this make sense?  because there are far more full-gallon containers than half-gallon containers?  use your head and stop spewing your nonsense from the eco101 you just took last month as an elective "kiddo".  you have to use critical thinking instead of a flowchart of events.  i know jagex aren't setting the prices.  i'm explaining that in no universe should an item get more expensive with less product in it.  stop thinking item A and item B, it's prayer xp.  when hydra bones were buffed, lava dragon bones should've instantly tanked to below their price.  
---
let me show you:  
---
*option 1 (lava dragon bones): 99 prayer in 40.5 hours for 204m  
---
*option 2 (hydra bones): 99 prayer in 38.2 hours for 180m
---
it's less time and money to use hydra over lava dragon.  the supply and demand is "prayer xp", not bones.  if the supply of total "prayer xp" from bones goes up, then **all** bones should drop in price proportionate to the amount of prayer xp they give.

Play now my lord!
---
Id like to see some more use for tanky gear in general.
---
Have a player with a Bulwark shield everyone behind him in a line from a boss special attack.
---
Have some things similar to Sire vents that players need to disable, requiring high enough mage bonus to even damage them for example, so someone needs to bring max mage or atleast multiple switches for that style.
---
Have a boss regenerate health through the whole fight, only way to damage it fast enough is to use multiple different Enchanted bolts depending on the color of the boss or something. Gives a use for the bolt pouch to save inv space and makes some rarely used bolt tips viable.
---
Just anything to give items more niche uses, give players more of a "role" to fill in the team instead of everyone going in with pretty much the same gear. This is what I imagined Raids 1 &amp; 2 to be like on release.

I'm very in favor of all the changes you talked about, except I think there should be XP ones as well. Possibly they could be only made obtainable from skilling as a random reward, similar to clue geodes or bottles. If you're training something like agility you don't really produce anything anyone would want to buy, so it would be left as it is, which imo is in a pretty awful state. Literally everyone hates training agility, and while I suppose that's sorta the point since it's a utility stat, not unlike construction, that saves you time and effort later on, I think there should be a way to allow people to enjoy the more engaging parts of the game for a greater portion of the time they spend on runescape. Why not have rare agility or construction boosts, for example, be obtainable from fishing or mining or smithing, with better boosts for higher level skilling? 
---
Clearly, supply (food and pots) prices when skilling is more attractive to players would, all things held equal, be cheaper than when it is less. Ironmen still benefit, but it's not clear that regular skillers will see much of a boost at higher levels. It could easily be the case that one skilling catalyst equals about as much as one of the resource it catalyzes for higher levels, since many more of those items need to be put into the game for players to level up. Gp/hr would likely increase for lobsters, for example, but less so for dark crabs with the proposed boosts.
---
Why not add skill xp boosts to skilling with better boosts for higher levels? I'm not talking about tradeable double xp boosts, or something like that, but maybe something like if you're 99 fishing you can get up to a 50% untradeable xp boost for agility for 5 laps of the ardougne rooftop course, for example, with the option to convert it to a 15% (30% of original boost percentage) tradeable boost for the same number of laps. It would encourage skilling at the higher levels and add more varied rewards to what i agree are very predictable and dull, but still necessary parts of the game. And they would help you spend less time doing other things you might hate, or give you the option to make a little extra money by selling the xp boost to someone else. No extra inflation, no power creep, still can't effectively buy levels, idk. It seems like this would be the necessary corollary to the changes you proposed. I can't imagine profits would increase very much, if at all from skilling for higher level requirement items unless this were added, and it adds another layer of diversity to skilling. Maybe make there be random drops, like you get from raids, of skilling catalysts and xp boosts from minigames as well.

You can still reassign keys in Windows.

Eh idk, the rewards were okay. They didn't give you better exp per hour usually, but they let you save quite a bit of money. I spent 50m total doing platebodies all the way to 99 smith in 2010. 30m of that was the mith plates from 68-88 lmao, glad I had hammers. 
---
Starting after 40-68 smith via gold bars, I'd wake up at 8, do stealing creation for hammers until 12, then smith mith/addy plates for 12 hours, sleep and repeat. Took me 12 days to 99 from 40 and it was relatively cheap.

That doesn't sound good. But in my case... I know the email is still the same one that I registered the account with &amp; has NOT been changed because after I click send once I fill out my email in the provided space.. the next screen pops up and it shows email sent to c*******@*****.com yadda yadda yadda &amp; and all of the "***'s" add up to my email and the fact it starts with a C proves it. So that eliminates that possibility.

I did play a few months back while on vacation at my parents house out of state... which is the last time I played. &amp; I am kind of thinking that may be what triggered it. Not sure

Thats why Im hoping a Moderator/Admin sees this and can assist me personally. Id be willing to answer any questions they have.

We all quit at some point before but those two are the reason no one ever came back to that game.

There are things that reward you that shouldn't be buffed imo, like runecrafting. But things that reward no xp and honestly just feel like a waste of time you ''have to do'' that at least for me have nothing in them to compensate with the time wasted should be buffed imo. Just because something is always been cancer doesn't necessarily mean it should stay that way.

Peak performance of bank standing.

Nah, the biggest reason for this is that a) they replaced them pretty much 1 for 1 when the actual number of ores used in smithing has dramatically decreased; and b) they replaced them directly such that many spirits dropped by e.g. Abyssal Demons are things like adamant and coal which are now pretty much obsolete beyond levels you get past in a couple of hours.

Start with a zerker quest guide. You‚Äôll get a ton of useful shit(b gloves, fighter torso, Ava‚Äôs accumulator) and you‚Äôll spend way less time training after the initial grind to actually use the items gained from the quests and mini games. After that you can jump straight into slayer(train defense and prayer to 70+ during the slayer grind once you‚Äôre financially ready for bosses) or go for the quest cape and diaries to unlock all of the higher tier content as early as possible.
---
Id rather use Legend Cape or ardougne cloak, def in most pvm places where "obby is bis" doesn't matter at all, while a prayer bonus does. Plus you don't look like a scrub

Concider this. I once went to fish lobs on 5 accts to make money in F2P for a bond. What I found out it was surprisingly fun trying to maintain good EXP rates on all accounts.
---
Doing lobster fishing with just 1 account is mundane and boring. However, the potential for (almost, but not technically possible) 5x reward from fishing felt nice.
---
Does this mean we should just increase the fishing productivity and clickability by 5x for those who want more active gameplay?
---
Well, not necessarily. This ties to another mechanic in game, too, which is actually technically an exploit, called 3 ticking.

I think a mechanic where you have the OPTION to turn the skilling up a notch by interacting more with what is happening on screen would be nice. However, it does need to be rewarding in order for it to be worth it, and inventory space is definitely an issue.
---
So one of the things I'd really like them to do is to eliminate 3 ticking entirely and replace it with optional way of gaining more resources via skilling.
---
**How would this method work in practice?**
---
Well, say, you are fishing. Every tick you fish, you have a chance to see more pools appear in the distance. These pools of fish would be Green, Blue, and Orange schools.
---
You could interact with these pools to get extra fish, 1 for Green, 3 for Blue, and 5 for Orange schools of fish, without interrupting your regular fishing activity.
---
Since this is intended to be replacement to 3tick, 3tick would be removed. There won't be any need for it anyway, since you can gain equivalent or more fishing EXP with this new method than with 3tick. As detailed above, intention is for this new method to be more dynamic and rewarding than regular fishing in exchange for higher resource output.
---
But another issue that still needs to be addressed is the inventory space. Should we just abandon the 28 slot system for skilling completely in favour of more faster skilling? If you think PvM, most skilling drops are noted, making it so they are shortcutting the 28 inventory system in the first place anyway, and making it difficult, if not outright impossible, for skilling to compete.
---
I don't think it would necessarily be harmful to the game to have "barrels" next to fishing spots where you can bank the fish. Maybe you have to pay an NPC to deliver it, or you can just note it there, but either way in order for regular skilling to be competitive with PvM(if players even want that) they need to come up with a way to overcome the 28 inventory slot limitation.
---
Otherwise, PvM getting noted drops and skillers still being forced to bank every 28 spots just isn't fair. As a side benefit, this could bring many unused resource locations usually too far away from bank normally back into viability again.
---
"girlfriend lol" 
---
Hence the suggestion about more fun skilling gameplay methods. 
---
I see you know rule 1
---
How much profit does it actually give?
---
Bait
---
Sounds like nanking
---
Yeah. I don't think people are mad because it makes getting sand easier. I think people are upset because it would more than TRIPLE the speed of collecting materials for an iconic ironman grind, and ALSO giving it pretty good xp/hr in a tedious skill.
---
If they simply change it to 2-2.5k buckets per hour, it would be perfectly okay.
---
It would make the crafting grind a bit faster, it would make the mining grind feel more useful, and it would not be OP or "devalue" any skill
---
If you go on Google and type in "add Skilling random events back osrs Reddit", you can see just how many times this question has been explained.
---
Spoiler: you're probably the 1500th person to suggest this.
---
I've killed over 20k Abby demons and had 40+ whips over 2 accounts
---
At this point it is "just got a whip lol"
---
Its fucking cool at first, but eventually it's just the payout from an otherwise not that great task
---
How are cat girls (?) related to this? XD
---
I loved that minigames as someone who absolutely can't stand the mindless running from altar to altar. The rewards were nice too, teleport tablets for altars you might otherwise never go to, useful for ironmen.
---
anyone know some places where bones/big bones spawn apart from the bone yard in the wildly 
---
Don't bot and you won't have this problem.
---
They won't be added back to osrs. I remember getting killed by these spirit tree of level 130+ while I was cb 50. The possibility of getting killed by a safe skill such as woodcutting does not add much value to the game..
---
They must think of other methods to reduce the botting.
---
I remember obby capes first being introduced. It devalued my legends cape.
---
Post is pretty gatekeepy.
---
If someone pays $11 per month, their vote weighs just as much as yours.
---
Your accuracy hardly matters at Sand crabs. Think max hit
---
The way I look at SC is essentially, instead of spending 2 hour of training mindlessly at some place, you could spend 1 hour having FUN and then training for somewhat of an equivalent, or slighly worse EXP.
---
It was a really good minigame and nailed the point of fun home.
---
Of course, it doesn't hurt that the minigame itself was so well designed in how it included other skills and offered new super strong combat gear, that was only available inside the minigame.
---
No because winners buy gold and winners dont lose

I personally chinned 99 range before doing Slayer and it's not really worth it. There are way too many bis use cases for the blowpipe you're are going to get a lot of ranged exp.
---
I'd say chin to 90-92 and then passively level range through whenever you use a bp.
---
Burstable Slayer tasks are more than enough for magic imo
---
Great info, that‚Äôs for the work

I use highlighted for anything alchable, but I'm cb 91 so... That'll probably change later.

---
You're a fucking idiot. If you don't want to get attacked don't go into the wildy. It's that simple. I'm not even a pker but I know as soon as I go into the wildy I'm fair game.
---
So if it's about fun, what's fun about attacking people who don't fight back? I already made this point but I'll make it again just for your dumb ass.
---
Perfect thank you :)
---
I don't know what exactly you're talking about but if it is what I think it is, you can change the URL in your r/2007scape bookmark to 'old.reddit.com' instead of 'www.reddit.com' and see if that is what you were asking for.
---
The fact that people don't understand this is just ridiculous. Once you enter a PvP zone you can be attacked for any reason, it doesn't matter. 
---
Fantastically made post. 
---
While I'm not sure about your solution but loot tables are definitely problem and has been for long time. I really think it swifted when Zulrah came. 
---
Not only Zulrah is still great money after initial nerfs but it shaped every new boss loot table that came after, because they had to tune them to be around the same or even better money/hr or otherwise people wouldn't be happy and just stick to Zulrah. And as bosses only have limited uniques or none at all, devs have to put other items to loot table to be decent gp/hr and those are usually combination of alchables and resources. 
---
Sure some resource drops are fine but it shouldn't be faster to kill bosses to obtain for example massive amount of ores/bars than actually doing them through Mining or Smithing but sure it feels so right now. Only reason to really train for example Mining and Smithing is for quests and beyond that, 99.
---
Like even if you would half the drop rate of all Zulrah items right now, it would still be good money. Same applies to other high gp/hr bosses.
---
Should be able to ask your KBD/Vork pet to recolor it for you using a head. That would be super neat, and people could show off that they have KBD or Vork pet while using another pet.
---
Would be sick.

You were still arguing about people killing players for no reason when there is no argument. You're in a PvP zone, the reason doesn't matter.
---
Yeah twinks exist, but most serious pvp players don't even keep characters at a low enough level to invade at undead burg, the difference is, those twinks are the exception in DS, as opposed to OSRS, where pkers regularly camp clue spots, teleportation spots, abyss runners, and skillers, where they know that no one is gonna attack back 9/10 times.
---
This shit is fresh homie
---
Arguing about what? Come again? 
---
I said you're a dickhead if you kill someone just to do it. I didn't say anything about anything else. If they're fine being a dickhead then whatever, and I \*know\* they're fine to do it.

Man I feel like every old picture I see of someone playing runescape 10 years ago had a crowded/cluttered desktop lol. Books everywhere, food and drinks, cds and dvds etc. 
---
Zulrah easiest boss on mobile with tbow
---
Some pkers will attack anyone in their combat bracket including myself, you can go a long while not finding anyone for a decent fight so you just kill everyone. Someone‚Äôs a little salty they died one too many times in the wild x)
---
Only if you at attack barricades
---
Yeah I'm not saying it should change, in fact I like the risk, but you guys act like you come across people who forget to bank 20m of shit every pking session, whereas I bet it happens once or twice a month at best. So, bearing all of that in mind, I fail to see how it's fun to attack people who consistently won't fight back, based on the tiny chance they brought major bank with them, you may as well camp bronze dragons for a visage by that logic.
---
Not sure if the cost you get from the runes would be worth it since you have to eat so much food to get them. Just a suggestion - the barbarian village dungeon has decent low level things to kill that likely profit you more (less food needed too). I remember doing that back in the day, work your way up to flesh crawlers then ankous after that for better profit
---
You can be assigned any boss that you meet the quest/skill requirements for.
---
When you are assigned a boss, the slayer master will ask how many you want to kill and you can choose any number between 3 and 35. If you think you're too weak for a particular boss you can always skip it.
---
It isn't really efficient to get assigned bosses through slayer, and there are probably better rewards that you could have spent the slayer points on.

---
I have had my account stolen before and when I tried recovering it, I never got an email. I did some digging in my email account and noticed whoever stole it created a ‚Äúrule‚Äù (called different things in different email providers). The rule was whenever I received an email with the word ‚Äúrunescape‚Äù in it, it would forward that email to the hackers email and delete it from my inbox. This would make it seem like I never received this email. 
---
You can check this by going to your email settings and filter through each setting that has to deal with automation for forwarding. 
---
Wow dude thanks a lot for the detailed answer! Wouldn‚Äôt it be really hard for me to kill them though using such a low lvl spell?:)

Not long then, thanks!

Can i get a summary i aint reading this fucking novel

I doubt it will be coming this year unless it's in like December. The Song of the Elves quest will becoming with Priffidinas in the next few months or so then Warding will be polled/blogged/discussed for ages so I don't think there'll be much time for any other updates this year.
---
kill count counter
---
You have to defeat Sir Leye, you'll gain at least 24 HP xp, you gain 1.33 HP xp per hit. (Use alt / friend to venge you and use super str &amp; att before you go inside and hope you get the room early to keep the boosted stats and hope he hits you a max hit of 3 so you'll deal 2 damage to him, leaving him 18 HP + he might heal as well so you'll gain even more HP xp)  
---
For What Lies Below the boss fight is in instance and you can't recoil, veng or poison/venom him. He has 60 HP so again, you'll gain at least 80 HP xp.  
---
How much defence xp you currently have?
---
None of these are essentials... They're just mid level unlocks
---
yo ima fart

"OSRS Noob gets absolutely decimated by SICK BURN."

Yes it takes time at first but it speeds up a bit to 5min a dragon
---
The PKers wet dream a spade made of crystals 
---
It looks like a cat when you scratch it's back.
---
Great picture though 
---
I think that the fact that regular hydras (which can be killed off-task) also drop the Hydra bones really increases the amount of bones coming into the game. If the Alchemical Hydra dropped "superior" Hydra bones (prob also with slight xp buff), just like Vorkath the price might go to a value that makes more sense.
---
I got my claw on 650ish kc, before that i had the dragon thrownaxes/knives so keep at it bro :)
---
RIP in peace grammar.
---
They do it because they're losers who want to feel superior, so they go after skillers. Oh, but if they realize the other person is a seasoned pker that can actually fight back, jesus, they run away fast af XD
---
Your edit tells me that you are probably one of those nerds who spend most of their time playing RS and are opposed to do increases because ‚Äúthat would devalue the time I put into this game‚Äù. You‚Äôre probably maxed as well.
---
just bored while thieving, just got the pet! (:

I like your attitude, bless you sir.

Thank you for your service.

What is the effective crafting XP rate after this buff?
---
as you watch the video you can see the beer glasses get emptier and emptier until theres 5 empty glasses on the table and the mods are ready to add a dock to draynor
---
Lmao why did you buy gold? That just takes the fun out of the damn game. 
---
Yeah, the unskilled comments are always a personal favorite as mine, as they proceed to get downed by someone lower lvl'd than them. My zerk down mains and I always get hit with, "u suck", if that is true, then what does it say about your main play?
---
Also, they can always gear up and come out to the wildy and defend themselves, them being defencless is their choice. 
---
But yeah, pvm - let me go kill this npc that is programmed to be killed by a player, much skillz.
---
BRB, adding extra content support to the engine so the content can support an engine that can support content.
---
I miss 2007 castle wars so much. Always full teams and you would see someone as a bunny. Is it as populated as it used to be?
---
I agree. But then people on reddit will bitch and whine about how easy it is to get rich solely by judging from reddit posts of a few lucky people who land a nice drop (E.g. when rev caves originally came out, when 1 person in the world got 2k sara brews).
---
Sounds like I'm safe to have balls if I just stay at NMZ until 200 mil all melee stats then

Not a pker, but I‚Äôve seen clue hunters bringing along their full stack of runes for a clue

"Haha my guy is owning these rock crabs"
---
On guild wars 2, which probably makes it less surprising as its a heavily RP'd game some guy kept referencing his different characters on there as "Personalities" and it just ground my fuckin' gears honestly. 
---
No you both
---
I agree with what you're saying but disagree with how we should interpret it. Ironmen have to "complete" each version of pvm, which each have their own grind. Normal accounts are incentivized to do whatever method makes the most money per hour, then just buy whatever uniques are needed. 
---
For example, ironmen have to grind barrows/godwars/wildy bosses/shamans/zulrah/vorkath/raids etc, but normal accounts grind zulrah/vork/zulrah/vork ad infinitum. THis isn't a requirement, but it makes sense for a normal account to operate purely in terms of GP/hr
---
Yea
---
I hear you but I feel like we shouldn‚Äôt look that far into things. Could say the same about anyone who‚Äôs addicted and good at a hobby. For example Imagine some dude gets really good at making pizza and gets recognized for it. Would you say he wasted his whole life making pizza? Then again one is getting payed one isn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt feel like deleting this but I just changed my mind think your right used to watch autumn elegy etc but starting to see the negativity towards that lifestyle is justified 
---
Void does look awful tbh, I dont ever plan to get it on my account, ill grind for Arma/Ancestral before startig raids
---
yes! and how many goblins were killed since 2019
---
There was a dude yesterday 300 barrows kc in without only 1 drop 
---
How many times do I have to fucking say, I don't want the wildy to change, it's just the way they defend it I find hypocritical and annoying, I wish they'd just say,"cos I can" rather than these elaborate excuses.
---
if you love achmed so much why don't you invite him to stay at your house moshe
---
weird flex but ok
---
X marks the spot made me swap the quest cape for a rune pouch. 
---
yeah man it sucks we're surrounded by leafs and mexicans 
---
&gt;But when a pker can be chased down by a naked guy with a dds, I don't think they're ready for real pvp
---
everyone starts somewhere, or did you start OSRS doing zulrah right off tutorial island? the way OSRS is set up causes there to be a large skill gap which is why when you go BH worlds youre either fighting a guy with 0 BH kills or 2000 BH kills and no in between. 
---
&gt;Only times I've died in wildy was offering bones at chaos altar. I've lost maybe 50k total from dying there, it's no big deal. I can see why someone would want to kill people there, they have high value bones.
---
i got a pure there for 600k in dagannoth bones as well as his own risk. and i am sure theres even more to be had there, because max mains and singles teams constantly camp the entrance. just killing one of them is a good way to net yourself 400k. 
---
as a PKer i will tell you with 100 percent honesty that aside from the rare whales and the people with wildy weapons, PVMers always risk shit, like on average 100-200k. that is why i am always gonna hop off a PVMer who i think isnt risking if a PKer shows up. it happened the other day. 
---
im chasing what mustve been an ironman or something or a noob, then i see the juiciest fucking snack come across the agility shortcut from revs so i freeze him, big bolt and claw spec him for 500k. and i think thats much better than the emblem i wouldve gotten off the other guy in monk robes. 
---
however PVMers are abundant and more reliable source of income. so i can patrol around looking for PVMers to kill who might be risking and then hope to run into other PKers who will definitely have more risk on them. 
---
still didn't add the green text in log, feelsbadman
---
"normie" yikes. Oh, and sorry I forgot it's 2019 where logic is at an all time low in society. Don't kid yourself, not every HC Iron lives forever, unless they don't log in or engage in any form of combat. 
---
no cluttered mess please
---
LEET
---
Untill you want to do the diaries and are forced to get it
---
Dont use an ipad
---
Then you learn that a lot of agility shortcuts are locked behind diaries so if you don't have that you gotta grind them out too. 
---
&gt;That wasn't his point but okay, I'll try spell it out in a way that smooth brains might understand. His point is, how can it be fun to fight enemies that don't retaliate? 
---
&gt;  I say drop any suggestions in the comments
---
Here is my suggestion: If you want titles, go play RS3.
---
Give me an afk way to train agility and give me 30k/hr doing it. I would get 99 his way. Gotten 50k agility xp today and I want to die.
---
Haha, maplestory 2 ran with constant graphic lag on my gtx 1070 and OC'ed 6600k. If it ran smoothly, I would have played it beyond one hour despite it being p2w. Game was dead on arrival. 
---
Sort of is when another clan or player whose a vastly higher level killing the same players as you hops onto your world and attacks you. A lot of my profit when killing wildly pve and slayer Bois actually comes from killing other pkers who are contesting the same spot.

Actually after farming guild I've been getting the odd 4 herb patches? This was prior to the bucket, I just bought one tonight. I would bring 9 compost and 9 seeds and I'm usually pretty strict with my regiment. What's going on? Also attas doesn't seem to work worldwide like it was supposed to?

This sounds more suited as a diary reward

Good work, gang.

I like it, but I also think it should be some clue scroll ornament kit type deal. Idk how I'd feel if vorkaths head has yet another use.

Ill get by without the diaries that require them. The only time id grind them is if a clue needed them, which afaik theres a Master step that needs a Torso
---
What the fuck is the point of telling someone who doesn‚Äôt know enough about the game to know when to get a defender, that he should get an item that‚Äôs worth over 100m

What would be a recommended loadout for doing the final Dream Mentor fight? I guess you'd want to put on mainly untradeables since you lose your items on death? I have 70+ Ranged/Magic and 75+ Melees and 70 Prayer.

what
---
Youll need to do it on an alt, most of rs3 is afk based and since we cant log on both games on the same acc you cant afk while playing osrs.
---
Do it for the experience, I did it myself and found out I do enjoy OSRS more
---
Except no one fled cause of he do rates, they fled because of EOC and wilderness removal. Things like the G.E. And better xp/hr and afk methods had a very minimal impact. In fact, the player base was increasing
---
I don't need any information about the Maiden. I need it on the Nylocas room.
---
Only time in my life anyone will see me agreeing with you
---
Green dragons most likely? If you get 80+ range and dragon slayer 2 done, vorkath is some of the best gp/h in the game
---
No it's due to the game not having a z buffer. Based on the angle of the camera, the game has no method of determining which object needs to draw over the next, so you get tons of graphical bugs like this. They are literally everywhere in game and piss me off. Certain capes always render through your armor. Certain animations can do the same thing. The tree leaves on karamja rendering before anything no matter how far in the background they are is pretty annoying for example.
---
Have a seat, dear.

---
Is this really an achievement worth making a post for?
---
You can't set any of the colors to orange because the text is already orange? So you won't be able to really see the orange highlight at all. You want those legendary items to really pop on the drop down menu. I changed it to red after I discovered this. 
---
It's clearly a joke. Take another look.

I don't see how providing a different example is an argument, but it seems like you don't disagree with me as much as you think. I agree a mechanics should be kept as long as there's no other way like it to improve gameplay.

Happy scaping!
---
pvp typically means 2 people fighting each other. when people say pker they typically refer to people in wilderness killing anyone
---
Man the mental image I have of you with a smug look of satisfaction on your face after you typed that second sentence thinking you got me good is hilarious, you're so clever dude!!

PKing is fun because killing other players is fun. If you can't understand that then I don't know what to tell you. The fact nerds like you get so triggered is just the cherry on top though.

Doesn't matter to you... I'm still gonna hold people accountable. 
---
Oh and there was no evidence on either of my accounts.
---
Oh yes very diverse clicking " click player click inventory click player click special attack vlick inventory click player"
---
pvp means you kill players, your method of doing so is irrelevant.
---
&gt;
---
When I say it's not engaging combat, I'm referring to killing people who don't bring combat gear or fight back(pretty much everyone who's not pking, bossing or doing wildy slayer), does it not get old pretty quickly?
---
heres the thing. nobody does this. there isnt a group of people out there targeting naked guys. ill run around in circles naked in the wild in front of PKers and no one will get me. ill stand at lava maze and watch some PKers duke it out for hours and no one will get me. as a PKer, i very rarely attack naked guys, and the PKers i know do the same. its all about context, and even if the naked guy is in the right spot it still depends on what hes doing for me to make a move. 
---
so of course i think youre referring to killing people who skill, boss and do wild slayer, since the majority of them just run and do not anti. if im not getting loot or making someone mad it gets old. thats why i never bother to kill naked people in the first place. 
---
&gt;Now when I talked about it not being profitable to fight other pkers, I don't actually know
---
i know you dont lol. you dont really know anything about PKing, but here you are forming your opinions. 
---
&gt;I, personally, don't hate pkers, but I can pretty safely say most of this community doesn't give two shits about you guys, just based on sentiments in game, in this subreddit and the way the polls go. 
---
this is a wrong opinion not based in fact. we got guys on this sub dedicated to destroying PKers and downvoting PVP polls. the constant amount of salt towards us is evident in absolutely every single post that vaguely has anything to do with PKing. why do you think were talking right now? 
---
&gt;The thing that annoys me is the massive leaps of logic some pkers go to to avoid admitting they just wanted some easy kills, so they went to go kill some skillers/clue hunters, which they are indeed allowed to do, so why all the elaborate excuses?
---
youre over analyzing this way too much man lol. youre assuming everybody does this; they do not. such a rare occurence and when it does happen its just funny to kill a naked person because you know theyre gonna be mad. its like when i kill a guy doin wild slayer for 50k, but he cries all the way to lumby and says enjoy the 50 cannonballs. i pretty much broke even on the kill, but the salt made it worth it. 
---
&gt;I think you might wanna reconsider which one of us is mad here lol, you clearly missed most of the points I was making, and then argued against a bunch of things I never even mentioned. What the fuck do spellbook filters have to do with anything? I don't recall even voting on that poll to begin with.
---
youre literally here getting mad about the one asshole out of 100 PKers who chases naked guys in the wild. spellbook filters are something the PVM community got triggered over and blamed the PKing community for. that fiasco is an example of the extreme disproportionate anger towards the PKing community. and people like you who exaggerate the frequency of people killing naked dudes in the wild/perpetuate the stereotype of a noob PKer being desperate for easy kills just helps fuel the fire. 
---
Yes, xp rates should be increased. Just because you have no life and sit on RuneScape for 6+ hours a day and burn through the content, that doesn't mean things should be a bit quicker. You do realise that you actually represent a very small percentage of the player base, and the game shouldn't be designed around people like you.
---
What's the best you're some kid who doesn't actually have to do anything irl and was never even around for the original game and where it went wrong... Just shut up.
---
Oh and you're snarky little comment at the end about a lot of people having an average total lvl totally proves that point that most people don't obsess to the same level you do about osrs.
---
the idea that "everyone" cares about ehp is hysterical considering i would bet 95% of players &amp; people on this sub play without a whisper of efficiency
---
thats a big ad
---
Picking flax is still one of the top money makers in the game. Not sure what you mean by this post.

I want to start doing 'farm runs' but I can't find any good guides that explain what a farm run is. I reached 54 farming by planting trees and paying the farmer to watch over it. But this is incredibly costly and doesn't yield any rewards.
---
Allotments seem like a waste of time. They offer little exp and half of them die. Paying the gardner doesn't seem worth it.
---
Only herb runs should yield profit? But I feel a little hesitant to begin with it, as even with ultracompost there is a 1/10 chance I get nothing?
---
I'm not sure where to begin!
---
Generally people drop the Iron ore they mine
---
If you're stuggling with vorkath try doing kills with a rcbow and antidragon shield. Use super extended antifires while praying range. You should be able to get at least 2 kills a trip.

Status bars, mouse over item stats, mouse over tool tips, boost info. There's a lot of it that is just displaying information you already have in a much better way. On the other hand things like the now deleted Jad plugin, the demonic gorilla plugin and the clue scroll helper are totally op and unneeded by anyone.

Nope, a group of pkers will attack a naked dude running through the wildy no matter what. Got to get those spades and lobsters.

This is what I say.  UIM signed up to be excluded from banking, not from every game update that would make their mode marginally easier to do without banking.  Personally I always thought bankers should be able to note stuff for UIM, they still are carrying their whole bank.

F2p has always been bot central. There's never been a point where it hasn't. That being said once you have 80+ combat stats it's incredibly easy to maintain a bond. 
---
It's against the rules tho
---
The influx from mobile users is why everything is so crowded, id suggest just buying a bond and using members.
---
It's weird how people will _still_ say they play _"for nostalgia"_, but there's a lot of powercreep compared to day 1, and most people use a 3rd party client because it basically plays the game for them.

Would this not create demand for them though?

No

Shit ideas tbh, everyone knows that killing npc's present the most profit as it should, skilling is afk/safe and you still make money.

Personally I say to just remove resources from drop tables. I didn‚Äôt use PvM for resource gathering back in 2007 and I am the same way now. 
---
Same logic as the repeated "Nice." comments? 
---
I was mainly thinking of Ice trolls when I made this. There are so many slayer monsters that aren‚Äôt in the log. Another good example are giants and hellhounds. 
---
I'll be straight with you dog. F2p is hell, honestly don't bother leveling your stats in f2p, buy 1 month of membership (or use the twich prime promation) and knock out the early levels by questing. There are literally 700k/hour money making methods that require stupid low stats on p2p. So, it'll be easy to maintain a bond.
---
That's a valid statement, I'm just not sure if Jagex should recognize capping XP as something that would classify as "beating the game"
---
Half of them time I get pked anymore, I've already finished my clue and am three iteming, so I straight up ask the pker I see to kill me so I don't have to walk all the way back 
---
I wanted to post this aswell :(
---
Add bonds to iOS mobile please
---
In RS3 recently, all ore/bar drops were switched out for stone spirits, which act similarly to what you propose but this instantly devalued some of them. 
---
Personally, I love this idea, I feel like the majority - at least 70% of mid-high level resources should enter the game via actual skilling and low level resources can get taken over by bosses. This both devalues botting and allows for free to play players who actually get to 60+ levels to make money off of chopping yews / mining addy rather than competing with bosses dropping scraps of paper worth of an item.
---
Let's say you purchase that annual Premier Club membership for $100, and can find the time to play just five hours per week. After the year is up, you've spent less than 6 cents per hour to be a member. If you pay by the month, you're spending a little more than 7 cents per hour.

When you open Runelite, there is a wrench in the top right corner. Click on this wrench and then a list with zll the plugins will appear. At the top of the bar you can search for specific plugins.

Fun game, i play both. 
---
but what about things like wintertodt? and firemaking in general?
---
I think, the idea is that they all should have some top-notch resources unique to themselves.
---
but thieving can supply almost anything, firemaking doesn't supply anything outside wintertodt, Runecrafting supplies only runes 90% of which can be purchased somewhere, similarly for fletching.
---
Having some overlap is fine but only at lower levels(low level resources) so you could imagine it like a couple circle graphs interlocking a bit in the middle but ultimately having the tips sticking out alone.

You can start by just not caring whether or not you step in the poison on the floor. healing vorkath a little and getting hit for 5 or 6 is much better than getting stacked out for 30s. Turn your run off, and just click somewhere far away. Preferably not walking through poison, but it doesn't matter too much if you're learning it. Then just walk back and forth, be sure to keep moving the entire time. Maybe watch a video of someone doing it. Good luck
---
I'm a casual that's been playing since osrs release and I fully side with ehp kids who don't want things to get out of hand the entire point of osrs is to have that Grind and achievement qhen you complete it.  I don't care how other people play I just do what I want when I want in game and personally find konar a fun new way to do slayer even if it isn't all cannon or burst tasks. Also to be fair I hate casuals and they will literally slowly kill this game if jagex tries to focus on them it's why WoW has slowly died over time because blizzard caters to the masses and not the dedicated players.

---
This is definitely not the issue I have with spells. In an instant, like casting a barrage spell, its too easy to missclick the icon. This is crucial for Inferno, ToB, Pking, PvM like there is a lot of places this change helps players avoid mistakes due to the amount of empty space in the interface. Even more so when you filter spells. This never should've been polled in the first place, it should've been a QoL update.
---
Who the fuck cares, pmods aren't saints. Let them swear, ffs you bunch of retards.

Not a big fan of questing either. But while I‚Äôm doing them I just think of the rewards. Just finished recipe for disaster and holy shit was it damn worth it for them barrow gloves!
---
Thanks man, it was an awesome feeling. The last week I‚Äôve been grinding stats to finish out barrows gloves and wanted MM2 to be my last quest for them. This was a great reward! Hopefully more to come :) cheers

I realised what the point of the picture was, what I'm saying is there are far more impressive things to flex on. A lev 50 with an inferno cape is a real flex, this is just blah imo :p
---
Please for the love of god. When you filter spells, ancients specifically, there is so much empty space to missclick in. It's not even funny. Help people stop missing nylocas freezes! Make Maiden Great Again!

Let's be honest we all want sailing more than warding.
---
No, that wouldn't be a better example at all. A better example would be adding, for instance, a spell that tanned a ton of dragon hides at once to allow everyone who uses dhide for crafting to do it more easily.

Oh, wait, that exists. Shocking, huh?

Dont worry about a 99 yet, get your first zulrah kill or something first, more fun that way.
---
Lootshare with an option for a toggleable item shard sharing system like on RS3
---
Ah ok, yeah I've been burning far too much money on the super combats then
---
Except that logic doesn't carry over; I've been part of the early game and have been able to experience it's speed. I understand that the game is mostly comprised of low-mid level content since the game didn't really take off until they released a boss like zulrah. Everything developed in the genuine 2007 version of the game is low-mid level content, by current standards, except for like smithing (99 smithing for a rune platebody lmao) and maybe gwd or kq.. 
---
Of course, what else would I do with it ? :) 
---
I imagine this game would be difficult if you can't read what the items are or know what to do. Care to elaborate on how you played the game?
---
I completely agree with you, I wish we had resizeable interface but in terms of what was rejected prior, the icon resize is at the very least a very feasible task to implement. Hopefully one day they will add fully resizable interface.
---
Then you'll have to give all the autists of osrs statues

I don't know if it was specifically polled, but there was a blog mentioning some use of rare fossils from fossil island, I'd like to see some use for those!
---
On the contrary, Tbow is actually not complained about by most players or devs at this point. It serves a specific purpose, its an incredibly rare item, and it IS a best in slot. Any nerfs to Tbow would kill its best in slot status for DPS on its effective monsters. However I do agree that the mages in Mage Arena 2 should be immune to Range and Melee since its MAGE ARENA. But when it comes to Tbow, it is fairly balanced. Its Good/BIS for about a dozen places (And then melee is BIS in the majority of places) and its rarity keeps it from being used on a mass scale. Now if everyone had Tbow the same way everyone has a blowpipe, THEN we'd have an issue..

Loot Key Scrolls? Failed with 73.9% and i don't know if they are considered as bad design for wildy or how well received it would be now. Just pointing out it was really close.

Also Wrath Altar from Abyss at 73.6%. What do you think about this now?

In RS3 there was a "Get Bond" interface that could be used to purchase a bond anywhere ingame from the GE at a +5% price. It was removed because of comunity backlash. But it would be a good ideia to be implemented for Ironman.

I've caught like 27k-ish black chins en route to finishing armadyl. I was never once attacked by a solo pker on normals. Never ever ever. 
---
People literally think they have a better chance to kill me on ancients when I need to run just 3 lvls to teleport than they do on normals.
---
Anyone who has spent any significant time either pking or being attacked knows that solo pking on normals in completely non-viable at high levels.
---
You really don't seem to understand the game economy very well. 
---
What rs3 content serves that purpose? I can't think of any. If anything, rs3 has this problem even worse than us.
---
Nightmare Zone on normal rumble, with obsidian, so that it's not really important to be at 1HP works great. I just got 99 Strength from 84 in 9 days doing this. You can use super combat potions instead to make it afk for up to 15 minutes. I'd strongly recommend it

---
It‚Äôs worth it with the milk u save imo, very cost efficient. Sadly doesn‚Äôt give rc exp tho
---
But thats still balanced. The basic spellbook is not meant to be powerful nor is it meant to be able to effectively solo pk. Sure you have no efficient massive damage spells like ancients does, but you have a point and click teleport prevention for up to 5 minutes. If you can stop them from teleporting and from running away on a single spellbook that is too much utility. Then you can easy range/melee brid fight to wear them down and they would still have to deal with being locked down by that spell. As a PKer, I think this is too powerful. If you want utility and damage/freeze you should have two people on different spellbooks. It has always been this way and has worked fine, its not a necessary change. The ancient spellbook was designed and released as a PvP spellbook. There has to be a balance between them.

&gt; If we had the server backup from like 4 months earlier, it would need 75% to add a ditch. 
---
Sucks for you that's not the case, then, huh?
---
&gt; There is nothing the ditch does better than a toggle-able warning similar to the one at death plateau wouldn't do better. 
---
It stops lures by actually being a physical barrier. A warning pop-up doesn't actually stop your character from moving.

Just happened to my brother yesterday while the monkeys were aggroed he had to wait and home tele was freaking out cause he risked like 35m

Can‚Äôt read the title can you? Clearly says warning. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so upset over me posting about this. I don‚Äôt use reddit a lot and I never go on the 2007 subreddit. Thanks for being toxic. Have a nice day.

this made me lol

*Whomsts's've'ave

I would be worried. Not super worried, but slightly. 
---
1. This probably means that they know your RuneScape password.
---
2. This probably means they know your registered email. 
---
So change your password for both. Check the recent login activity for your registered email. Consider changing your registered email, as this will ensure you'll no longer get spammed with phishing emails. 
---
Weird that people just imitate what others do like that

no proof he was HCIM

Toxic

Eh, make them do fairy tale for the fairy rings. Otherwise let them know it off. There's good things they don't get, but if they don't feel like questing, let them live their lives

Yeah dude! I was just learning this run, I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it was. I overthink fights all the time

Nice dude keep it going

He makes these just for the comment he's replying to

Pet, Jar and Mutagen then, you ain‚Äôt finished!

Truthfully this will never be implemented for a variety of reasons, but I believe this sounds more like "ironman content" than regular account content. No mains would waste their time with skilling catalysts, why would someone buy a skilling catalyst to use and then spend more time using it to collect resources instead of buying the resource in the first place? 
---
Thanks bro! Yeah I definitely was not expecting it since I got lucky at drakes a couple weeks ago 
---
As someone who started an ironman when the mode launched, this is completely fucking false. 
---
Not only is it false, but when the fuck did the community start caring for ironman? Was it when the streamers jumped on board? Because when it started everyone loved to go out of their way to shit talk it and hate on it. 
---
50/50.

Only if it can get me home from the bar for 15$

Thats what I like most about Runescape... Little rich kids cant spend their parents money to get ahead in the game and become better than other people who put the hours in working on their characters. That would ruin the game for me at least. One of the few games where you actually gotta put the work in.
---
lol the wilderness isnt for pking silly, now sit dear :)

How many q p

For barro   W‚Äôs gloves?

I've heard mods mention an elo system before and I've been hyped about it since. The problem with current unrestricted/tournament worlds is that it seems everyone is geared in completely max items. a matchmaking lobby where you can only take a +1 similar to last deadman finally would be spectacular. (and also introduce a ranking system for future tournaments)
---
same for bathing apparently

All the bosses fall into the same mechincal trap of: switch gear/switch prayer/move character or some combination of the 3. 
---
I‚Äôm suggesting a boss that‚Äôll shred you if you wear void or any dps-loaded layout and will make you wear more defensive based gear.
---
So when a bully goes after a weak kids dinner money, it‚Äôs ‚Äúballsy‚Äù because other bullies might be coming after the same kid? Nope, still sounds pretty pathetic to me
---
Started doing Wildy Slay with a switch+budget ok gear to learn how to pk a little instead of just run+tele or sit. Almost got a dude at demons yesterday til his buddy teled in and started blasting me w/45s. 
---
Pretty fun tbh, only 150k-ish risk, so one vork kill if I die.
---
Still had that anticipation dopamine though
---
Abby dagger is the BIS one handed str weapon after the Ghrazi Rapier, so it's definitely useful.

I bring a bgs and if I see the same pkers they get annoyed at me even though I only just auto retaliate

I do a lot of walking every day :) 
---
my point isn‚Äôt the fact he doesn‚Äôt go out much, it‚Äôs that he doesn‚Äôt do anything else. Runescape is his life. 
---
what part of me not wanting it you do not understand ? 
---
It‚Äôs not that we need our own specific player mods, but we need player mods to be more available to the iron communities. 
---
You mentioned:
---
&gt; They just watch the chats that are shared by both communities.
---
Well that‚Äôs not really the case since player mods aren‚Äôt really a part of that iron community. That‚Äôs the entire problem. 
---
Yeah I would probably kill an afk in runescape or an fps. But for fps I kill him because, well, it's a kill, why not take it? It would at least raise the k/d lol. And in osrs he might still have loot on him. So I wouldn't kill them because I enjoy it, but for said reasons.
---
But well, as I said. Haven't pked in the wilderness so I can't say much about it, but your reasoning doesn't sound very fun to me. 
---
add runespan
---
It's more than **double** the weight of the top. Ridiculous.
---
That‚Äôs the only boots I have dawg 
---
maybe it's because i logged into rs3 first then as they might share chat.

Dear player, lmao...
---
There is no denying it is faster xp but it is a lot more immersive and combat is actually engaging and fun. If you like high end pvm definitely worth it.

Why don‚Äôt we just get rid of Player moderators? It‚Äôs 2019, just having a silver crown next to your name means nothing nowadays. It‚Äôs such an archaic system, it makes zero sense to have them still. 
---
Nah you‚Äôre good, it‚Äôll only appear for you
---
Unless you died in pvp then other people can loot it
---
If you have enough gold for bonds on your iron, just make a lvl 3 to drop trade to and buy the bond on the level 3 and give it to your iron. You dont need a main to do this. Why do you play iron only? Isnt it boring? I'd go nuts if I only had my ironman and not my regular man
---
This was posted yesterday, the HCIM had ran out of food and only had prayer pots left and decided to risk it.
---
ok got it, so blessed dhide is actually better than rune plate + d legs?
---
85-90 melee stats won't be too bad although I'm thinking probably 85 on those 3 since I want to get started soon lol
---
The game mode a player mod plays doesn't matter at all? It's not like irons have their own chat
---
Hey dear I am solo rn, come over
---
I've seen it been used for items you're trying to collect, which I guess is the main idea. esp those items that don't have a GE value or HA value.
---
That's true but more interaction != more fun.
---
Some people enjoy monotone things like slayer.
---
I imagine it to be more fun if people actually fought back and had any kind of chance to win a fight. This doesn't convince me at all. 
---
We don't understand why you can't stand it so much that you can't just ignore it in your house/bank/pet storage.  If you don't like pets so much you should have considered it before you started your HCIM...you took the risk, man.
---
I understand that you don‚Äôt want it that is very clear. I‚Äôm just explaining that it is irrational and their is no reason you should be thus annoyed about it. Also you can get rid of it by dying if you want. Ironman is not catered too and it was very clear it would not be when it was created. As a hc Ironman you chose to limit yourself and this is an apparently unfortunate consequence of that choice. Although I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really much of a consequence as it‚Äôs not really a problem to begin with 
---
With your melee stats you could easily work up to affording a bond every 2 weeks
---
Pretty sure they've actually polled summoning in the past and it didn't pass. Which is good because I don't think it has a place in OSRS

Soup had a request for Jagex to bring back a few servers with the old combat system in the Wilderness for pking. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx8I7UHYj-U)
---
SoWrecked's video and petition actually came 2 weeks after that as a response to a Mod MMG dev blog (Jagec CEO at the time) where he apologized how EoC turned out on release.
---
BUt you're right about SoWrecked being the main guy behind the movement over Soup.
---
Have you tried enabling the gpu mode

---
Grats on your 63 runecrafting.
---
Yeah, I suppose while he has a point and all I can agree this isn't very appropriate behavior for a mod and it can encourage a level of toxicity when we don't hold them to higher standards. I can see how this could get worse real fast.
---
keep your stigmas to your self ;)
---
i did consider changing it since I havent been relevant here for 2 years almost but !
---
who knows ;)
---
An important note is a mid level boss would never drop anything that would make high level content crash to irrelevance. Mid level content would drop items that are significantly better than dragon armor, and worse than GWD. Giving mid level progression a second route rather than barrows. For instance. 
---
Now important note 2 is that if mid level content is released, they need to make rewards non-tradable, so it does not effect current prices nearly as much. And so it solves the issues you bring up of high level players farming it. 
---
Low level content does not have to be convenient, but you have to see this from a perspective that isn't your own, as the game gets older, people will get tired of catching trout and salmon, there just needs to be something new, and in an MMO for it to be worthwhile, it either has to have better xp rates, or better money-making/cosmetic/boosting item potential. If you're saying "convenience" is the issue, then pressure for more cosmetics as rewards, or rewards in the form of skilling outfits, or untradeables to keep it fresh, while not explosively changing anything. 
---
Then how are you 1250? Are all your skulking stats 99s?
---
Yeah I'd like to take full credit thanks 
---
Looks like the m was just cut off of maniacal
---
Dhide is better mage defence. That's how you'll be damaged most
---
I think an effective strategy at Revs is a duo - one person runs TB, the other runs blitz/barrage. You can bag a lot of PVMers this way and with a 2-way split the profit is decent. 
---
The downside here is that groups of 2 often get clan banged, so even a promising looking 2v2 or 2v1 against a pker has the imminent threat of a giant ass clan logging in. 
---
If you‚Äôre looking for loot, stick to the PVMers, if you‚Äôre looking for a fight get into a large group or pk somewhere else IMO 
---
i hope so, someday
---
7.6k my grief is more legitimate /s

...birdhouses?

I‚Äôd do it on a computer but I haven‚Äôt had one since I was like 14, mobile is the only way I‚Äôm able to play RS (you can imagine the excitement I had when they first announced mobile lol)

&gt; Some people enjoy monotone things like slayer.
---
Yep, that's why I pvm.
---
&gt; I imagine it to be more fun if people actually fought back and had any kind of chance to win a fight. This doesn't convince me at all. 
---
Well yeah, but that's not up to the pk'er, that's up to the guy who gets pk'd. 
---
Lumbridge castle, bank on 3rd floor and spinning wheel on floor 2
---
Legit question - why don't you think it has a place? 
---
Items aren‚Äôt text, they have a picture which comes attached with baggage of potential uses. A 6 y/o in a non-NativeEnglish speaking country thus sees the bucket, understands it‚Äôs potential functions as well as someone who knows what the word ‚Äòbucket‚Äô stands for and probably learns the word in the meantime.
---
The difficulty comes with quest dialogue and interaction with other players. 
---
Hey we have the same total lvl
---
How the hell did you get those stats already when you only started in 2019? How many hours a day do you play?
---
If you already have Amazon Prime then this is just free membership.

So will we see coinshare on there!?! If I recall it failed with like 73% or 74%. Fuck I'd love that feature so much so I can join random groups for God Wars.

They don‚Äôt have their own public chat, no. But just as how you probably have a friends chat filled with non irons, we have friend chats filled with only irons. 
---
yes youre absolutely right i created hardcore so i can have challenge if getting pet and not being able to get rid of it... fucking brainlet
---
why buy premade birdhouses? cheaper just to bring logs
---
There are more options. Some more... fancy... than others.
---
I'm humble too
---
could it be that they're both bad
---
They aren't going to release any information about that until any action is taken. 
---
Happened to me a few days ago forgot my light source and a tele so i actually died with huge risk luckily my gear was right where it was suppose to be with the light source.
---
There's obviously a reason I'm asking because a) some people here will know off the top of their head and b) i don't want to have to spend time going through a guide
---
Alright I'll take his spot I guess, just send me the details and I'll get right on it 
---
He‚Äôs in edgeville. The guy from Dragon Slayer west of the general store.
---
Yeah. Thinking about these people hurts my head.
---
{Brazzers}
---
They can possibly check if people are using clients to revoke the cape? 
---
I have no idea why you're being downvoted (-12 at time of this comment), your math is correct.
---
I wish one day to enter a thread and NOT see this joke.
---
So if I'm leveling WCing and fishing on my alt accounts while I level agility on my main, all on the same desktop, can I get banned when I trade the fish and lumber harvest to my main account?
---
ignorance is not stupidity jajaja

Shut up meg
---
Oziach is an NPC from dragon slayer and it's a tired old joke to tell people they have to talk to him to be able to get certain rare drops
---
Nice ! All the best with the fire cape!! 
---
My plan was to ham out more quests now with this set.. fire cape does look tempting but my ranged is too low ;_;
---
Lasagna cape from defeating the flying spaghetti monster 
---
i'm assuming this is trolling but you do know you can use the watermelon on the tool leprechaun and he will note all of them in your inventory, right? This can be done with most farming items. (couple exceptions being can't note cabbages at the falador allotment due to the cabbage field being right there and belladonas because they are untradable and can't be noted I believe)
---
Its bis for melee in raids no ?
---
Did you make one with the assembler? I‚Äôm not sure for the generic max cape does this
---
A lot of rejuvenation‚Äôs don‚Äôt last long term, when mage arena 2 came out mage bank was the most active it had been in years, pkers hunting the pvmers, pkers hunting those pkers ect; but within  a few weeks it was dead again, putting something like rev caves into the wilderness where people can consistently make mills/hr keeps the pker hunt pvmer hunt pker System going and thus rejuvenated the wild months after release
---
He can get it from the regular hydras
---
I would love that.
---
When you report players, it sends a snapshot of the recent chat, right? So maybe they could see which players have sent reports, and see if/how they handled themselves in chat. I feel like from there it wouldn't be hard to find who would be interested in being a pmod.
---
It *would* be time-consuming though. I don't think anyone on staff wants to sit down and read through thousands of chat logs just to determine if someone isn't a shithead.
---
Throw the whole thing away.
---
Exactly this.
---
Heeeyyy .. those skills are almost halfway there! Gratz!
---
Yeah definitely working on void, thank you!
---
No. 
---
Yeah, there aren't as many bots mining on the p2p servers.
---
I don‚Äôt see why..
---
dropped WoW after Uldir, don't reckon I'm going back until Blizz decides to get their shit together
---
I'm consistantly completing the raids under a hour and getting better every time with usually only the single death. But if items disappear more quickly than I thought this could be an issue
---
There's perfectly good training methods outside of the wildy for everything you mentioned. Dont blame the trap because you were enticed by the cheese my dude, you knew it was there.
---
So yes. 
---
Didn't know that, I've only bought ever bought plant cure and a seed dibber from him.
---
They probably just put the spade there so it doesn't look plain and empty. Bank is right next to it so one could just grab it from there.
---
I'm sure you're not as a maxed player but are you wearing anything metal that would stop the avas effect working?
---
Also try unequipping and reeeeequipping it
---
What happened with RoT? Sorry been out of the loop
---
Just figured it out, but thanks for the offer!
---
I've talked to 10+ people in the pk community who have all said the same thing to me: They send in ahk/pk script client usage evidence to Jagex and nobody ever gets banned for it. Fact of the matter is their bot detection system actually can't tell if you are using it or not which is why we are all basically fucked until they get their act together. It will start with the DMM tournys: anyone who is half decent and gets their hand on one of these clients will %100 mop the floor of the entire competition. Next will be PvM, players will have scripts that auto change prayers at inferno so anyone can just run around inside the caves and not take a single damage. 
---
Problem with that is then you have to pay for membership on two accounts. Unless you‚Äôre strictly dropping over money or f2p items. For example I have a load of duplicate items from treasure trails that are members items so my other account would have to be a member to pick them up.
---
Same boat. Wow got dry for me around wod. I switched to OSRS and seems to be getting better and better tbh! Maybe ill join back when classic comes out. (I was litterally dying for it to come out for 3 years). But now Idk if I even want to play less scape to play that when it comes out. :)
---
No I didnt because I wanted to keep my other skullcaps perks like crafting and construction, assuming it was collecting my arrows but just did a little test to see if it was and it isn't. I've used like 3k rune darts thinking it was working as a range skill vape aswell like ot says on rune wiki
---
It's not a repoll but could you change the smithing tutor's icon in lumbridge? I've seen a lot of new players confused about why they can't find an anvil in lumbridge.
---
I don't get who would believe the detection system works. Every profitable skilling area is still packed with bots. F2P is a nightmare.
---
Who the fuck believes you are banning millions of bots monthly when everytime i log into the game i see the same amount of bots if not more. I don't even want to imagine how much Zulrah/Vorkath scripters are making via RWT.
---
Q
---
I feel ya.. didn‚Äôt think it would come so soon to have feelings like that for wow :(
---
Cool
---
Ditched wow a few years ago, resubbed a couple times, never lasted more than a day. OSRS is so much better. The devs don't suck, with blizzard the worst part is that any meaningful discussion between players and developers is locked and gated behind a PR wall where they have to wait 3 weeks to even give a reply, and won't even tell you anything helpful.
---
They have to be made and replied. Either to be loved or hated. Just doing my duty
---
This is almost as bad as the fire cape ones
---
Hackerman comes to the rescue again! You've saved the day with your coding again! Why do you do it, Hackerman?
---
MA2 capes are only for people that can get out alive while completing the task. :)
---
Exactly. The profanity filter is better since it means people won't go out of their way to not trigger the censorship with things like "fu(k". Instead, they'd just say it properly and people with profanity filter will receive it as **** instead.
---
Complacent with rwt. This sub lol.
---
your time is so much more valuable than ours? 
---
If you must know, I had my reasons. 
---
First of all, when I played this game back in the day I was but a wee lad and I had parents that were afraid of putting credit card information into the computer. 
---
In fact they still are today. If they need something from amazon I get a phone call and I have to order it for them and have it shipped to their house. 
---
This was before they had the membership cards in stores too, so I couldn't even go spend my meager allowance on it. 
---
Thus the nostalgia factor of the game for me was rooted in the free to play world and it was the nostalgia factor that brought me back a couple years or so ago. 
---
From then till now I played very casually, at one point taking nearly a whole year off. 
---
It was really only recently in the last few months that I started playing more regularly and putting more time into it. Its something to do while I search for a new job. The company I'd worked for shut down rather suddenly last November. 
---
Three of those four are not integrity changes. Teleblock on F2P is a straight buff to F2P mage pvp. Death Mechanics is something that absolutely should be polled, as it fundamentally changes the game. The Gmaul change is just a nerf, that has nothing to do with game integrity, that‚Äôs just metta balance.
---
Oh, well i haven't entered the Guild but still, even at stuff like Barrows or Aerial fishing they have everything you need right there in case you forget and i just roll my eyes everytime i see design like that.
---
It's like the ONE essential item you shouldn't forget.
---
I tried to play WoW once, but all the microtransactions they shove in your face (Pets, mounts, recall animations I think?) made me quit before I even opened the inventory. Which by the way, I couldn't open because of a UI glitch.
---
Thanks for being so transparent about you not caring about me, Blozzurd.

---
You better be able to wear it with or without the hood attached or so help me....
---
Because there is no evidence they didn't win that tournament legit.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that as well, it‚Äôs such a foreign concept to see on this subreddit; actual devs talking to the players. So cool! 
---
I have multiple MA2 capes and have /never/ ran into PKers idk why I just really never have yet, and if one or two comes so be it they can get that beef, I just freeze, walk under, and talk my shit on the way to log out :P
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is instead of introducing gold sinks we should start introducing money trees. Because that plan would be adding a lot of GP in to the game that wasn‚Äôt there before the transaction. 
---
The f2p mining spots tend to be empty on p2p partially due to far fewer bots, but also due to there usually being MUCH better areas to mine as p2p.
---
You have a reaaaaally big dishwasher.

They don't show up for other games because they have no viable currency or too low of a viewerbase eg wow to be worth the time.

my guild fell apart just before we started mythic prog, so there wasn't much incentive to stick around for that either. kinda sucks, as BFA had some potential imo
---
So you're saying that you don't feel the same way, by saying you feel the same way?
---
Peanut brain.
---
Similar deal for me, raided cutting edge for a couple of years then suddenly it was like a switch flipped and I couldn't bring myself to care about the game anymore. Hard to pin it down to any one thing. I can name a lot - the bugs in BFA (invisible insta-death lasers on Mythic MOTHER tilted me off the face of the planet), the removal of master loot, the gear systems that somehow manage to get worse and worse every expansion, the staleness of world quests, the fact that I never loved Mythic+ to begin with, the atrocious story, the general feeling that BFA was designed by a C-team with no idea what they were doing... It all just added up, I guess.
---
OSRS had been my side game for quite a while. Now it's more of a main game alongside Monster Hunter World. It's amazing how good it feels to progress your character in these games compared to WoW.

I don't actually believe they can tell if someone is using an auto pray client or not, so they would get to keep the cape.

Yep bfa has killed it for me been working on 1500 total for the passed week.

Its only cringe if you're self conscious about the fact that you play runescape... not saying you'd wear this to a wedding but the vast majority of RS players these days are functioning adults, with hobbies, like rs. If you are worried about someone bullying you over a runescape sweater as an adult I would look at yourself and critique your own insecurities. 
---
Oof

I just lost the game. F U. 
---
&gt; cheap meal 
---
I'm sorry, $11 for a cheap meal?
---
over in england, a ***cheap*** meal is maybe, what, ¬£3 - ¬£4 over at the local chippy or chicken shop.
---
Adjusted for exchange rates, which at current is ¬£1 to $1.29, even the higher threshold is only $5.16.
---
A ***nice*** meal at the toby carvery is maybe ¬£7 per person, which is $9.03 in the states.
---
Over in england, membership is ¬£6.99 (which is a penny off of ¬£7).
---
England membership is equivalent to a nice meal out per month, not so much in the US.

Thankfully not :o

Everything I post/make is in good fun! I never intend to actually insult any group of players :(
---
If we dont expect a higher standard of them, then why isnt everyone a pmod?
---
Nobody says its the swearing, he put another user on blast and spread toxicity
---
It's hyperbole to drive the point home, they claim the detection system is doing a good job yet F2P has been a nightmare since release and the same spots that have been botted for years are still being destroyed by bots, even more than before.
---
It doesn't need to stand out in the drop down menu, the point is to stand out on the ground. And Runelite already uses orange as one of the default colors, for &gt;1mil price.
---
Barbarian assault was designed well over a decade ago, I think we can come up with something more fun
---
I chuckled once or twice while making it, wont lie!
---
That's a shit reason, especially considering it looked fine.
---
shit up fucknut
---
If they can dominate a fair environment like a 30v30 castle wars game then what's the problem? DMM is cancer because you can be in a clan of 1k people and simply outnumber everyone until the knockout phase.
---
They‚Äôd get griefed even more at bosses than they already do 
---
Yea it‚Äôs satire obviously all in good fun. There is no wrong way to play the game.
---
Outstanding move!
---
That shit is fire bro 
---
We don‚Äôt even know your stats.
---
That's how I've been doing it, but you still run into a lot of people there. I've had to world hop quite a bit to get it open
---
Dudes a real faggot
---
Not really... chaos altar is wildy only, black chins are wildy only, and doing only clues that don't go in the wilderness = 1 clue a year. Its unrealistic to say that people are *enticed* to wildy. They are made to go wildy because of wildy exclusive content.
---
I don't see the character though?!
---
That doesn't let you enjoy content together, it only existed because free trade removal prevented players from being able to trade something to another player for the sole purpose of using a skill to process it.
---
Fairy rings have 3 options: zanaris, choose-destination (enter code) and last-destination (takes you to the code you put in last). Third party clients can be used to choose which of the 3 is the left-click behaviour.
---
8 hours at Canifis boyzzzzz
---
Legends tell of a lone Clue Hunter wandering the wastes of the Wilderness, the keeper of the fabled Gilded Spade. 
---
Couldn't you move the Corsair's ship to the place where Veos was originally? Since you're sent to the boat via a quest that starts elsewhere it doesn't really matter if it's not openly visible, and it'd avoid changing the landscape around Rimmington.
---
And besides, the Corsairs wouldn't have to worry about drawing attention to themselves, since nobody could find the ship to Kourend there anyway.
---
Great job! Now we wait, I guess...
---
You can also world hop to a world where the wheel is fixed :P I refuse to fix the wheel
---
I‚Äôm sure they do ban a ton of bots every month but the bots they‚Äôre banning have a low barrier of entry so the gold farmers can replace the bot that was banned quite quickly which makes it look like nothing changed. 
---
The combat....its...evolving!
---
yeah sure if you want to do everything the game has to offer, but really clues aren't needed or you could drop it, black chins are the best you can get for training/profit but it's far from necessary, runecrafting has plenty of methods to stay out of the wildy, the only one that's even remotely close to necessary is MA2 for the cape which only takes like an hour for the bis mage cape which makes you fight unique bosses in an area that is already known to be sketchy (very rewarding imo).
---
cant a memeber just join a f2p world and go there
---
Yah I've played osrs on and off since release but always went back to wow. Blizzard can't get their head out of their asses so I came to a game with devs that actually care.
---
I'm in america. It is very much alive here
---
I'm so glad we get to share this planet with leopard geckos. What a cute little guy! I have one myself and they're so intelligent and fun to care for.
---
What wildy or pure update do you think is necessary?
---
Gear plays no part. Only those with the strongest wills may claim the spade.
---
If I'm understanding you correctly this is already a feature. Every standard fairy ring has a right click option to enter a code on the spot and go directly there instead of first going to Zanaris
---
Idk why but I always just assumed they weren't loaded.
---
Real reason: it was an unpolled change in a game that operates on polling changes, even small things like removing a green pixel. 
---
Check with the doctor it didnt give u cancer
---
Well no shit. It is piss easy to create a new account.
---
I mean given how the opinion was that the dock was worse than the pub in lumbridge, if people purely wanted outrage then they would've been equally lambasted.
---
It looks fine **in your opinion**
---
I'm talking out of my ass but I don't think it takes so long.
---
Change the location, change map, change few NPC's
---
It'd be a pointless nerf to a limited, but very strong weapon. It wouldn't be dead though. It'd still be BiS at Skotizo, and great for the demons in the catacombs
---
there were plenty of other ways of saying how you have a better solution but you went with "how about not dying to easy content".
---
I don‚Äôt want the game to cater to my pure account, jagex came up with the poll. It‚Äôs more of being able to take advantage of the opportunity given. Just like how they create content that benefits Ironmen accounts. 
---
It would still be bis at abyssal and black demons. I mean it would be dramatically less useful but not dead content. 
---
He's an ironman.
---
Ah you not being an ass wastes dev time? Does one of them have to take a day off to pull the cog out of your ass? Confused as to how it would waste dev time.
---
What about the poor house in Lumbridge??
---
Just make it so after your first recolor it's significantly cheaper to dye again. Or make it a gold sink 2nd time around. 
---
Ill celebrate when he hits 200m if lynx doesn't decide to do it first

- swirls wine in one hand and adjusts monocle with the other - 
---
I see that you too are a man of culture.
---
Only if the reward table is balanced around the expected value of 3 hespori seeds ;)
---
Saves time for high level players, but doesn't affect standard hespori much
---
That sounds good!
---
Whats the cc?
---
Right click the fairy ring and choose 'Configure'. Don't think it's a Runelite specific thing outside of being able to reorder the dropdown menus. 
---
chaos altar just saves you money and is far from needed, black chins are a good training method but it's a high risk high reward and far from needed when you have options like herbiboar, clues are basically free gold and is far from needed. All of what you listed is far from saying people are made to go into the wildy. higher xp rates and more profitable methods are EXACTLY what enticing means
---
D
---
Sadly item color stopped meaning anything in wow long ago, as you can get full epic items the first week of a new expansion
---
Thought you were gonna do a ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs cabbago‚Äù activity with this 
---
Going for all the requirements of each tier of achievement diaries is a great way to mix up what you're doing while also giving yourself a goal.
---
This shit has gone too far 
---
The wiki has a poll section also which is much more clear than the website in terms of pass/fail 
---
Maybe to not spoil stuff? 
---
Now, i'm not experienced enough to  properly comment on this , but i love every proposed idea.
---
This sounds like it comes from an experienced player, or a former jagex member.
---
Please let these ideas at least be polled, even better if the were added.
---
Congratulations, you threw a hissy fit over the placement of a boat.
---
Maybe ? Idk
---
Just put chat on Game when taking a screenshot, looks cleaner and you only have to crop out bottom line
---
Yeah, it's basically QoL &amp; Low effort changes.
---
Me, having never touched farming, wanting to try out farming guild content
---
(it's good now though, hit min level yesterday üòé)
---
No.
---
Well one in particular that was a let down for me was the blessed dhide requirements. I would‚Äôve been happy with just the chaps requirements being dropped. I truly believe it would‚Äôve been a plus for both sides of the community and I can‚Äôt wrap my head around why it was downvoted 75% 
---
It saved time teleporting to Draynor instead of having to run from there to Port Sarim. Plus the bank right there was convenient. Why go back on QoL just because people weren't used to it?
---
Oh fuck forgot. I'll probably do it later
---
Have a link? Don't think I've seen that page.

Stats bonus really only matter on monsters with defense. Crabs are so weak defensively that 'accuracy' doesn't really matter, go for highest str bonus
---
Fix the clan chat bug. Who gives an actual fuck about this. 
---
&gt;Wiley Clues are unavoidable topkek.
---
They are absolutely avoidable. Clue Scrolls aren't necessary to gameplay, many people don't even do them. Either way the majority are not in the wildy.
---
&gt;You can't get black chins outside of wildy.
---
This is the only valid point. But some forms of max xp should be dangerous. They've already made the game much easier than it used to be 
---
&gt;You literally can't avoid the wildy if you play osrs. Whether it be abyss runecrafting, mage arena or something else. 
---
Abyss is like 10 steps inside the wildly. Just don't wear gear lol.
---
&gt;This is why players get salty. If wildy was optional, people wouldn't complain anywhere near as much because it'd be optional content. But nah, required. Otherwise you're handicapping yourself.
---
It's pretty damn optional. You're being very dramatic. 
---
damn always scroll down to the bottom for comments to laugh at. you must hate pkers a lot to warp this suggestion to be about them lol
---
Maybe he just likes sweetcorn.
---
Why not put Veos back to his original place??????????
---
I'm baffled that Jagex hasn't ordered RL to take down the prayer reorder plugin.
---
Thanks a lot dude!
---
Why even bring this up? It was never suggested, is obviously a stupid idea, and what the fuck would happen to the weapon outside the catacombs?
---

Autistic screeching over nothing wins again!

- sorry for the shit write up im on my phone, but I would do all questing before worrying about CB stats bc getting barrows gloves and avas will greatly benefit your training load outs. 
---
- id focus on ranged as soon as all quests are done so you can obtain your inf or fire cape. Then focus melee stats followed by magic. 
---
Hope this helps!

youre crashing again FFS get your shit together
---
When I first started playing in the fall of 2016 they were like 700k even with the other books added. My only guess is more people are doing clues because of third party clients making the faster/easier

This would be great, I lost track of how many times I've been sitting in my portal room and thought "man, I wish I could just tele to my house without using a house tab."

Shit tasks as in bad xp or as in I'll have a terrible time doing them? I can deal with bad XP cause I really need the gp.

I mean, you phrase it like that's a bad thing, but it was a legitimate complaint. 
---
Can you poll if we should leave the eu again pls n thnx 
---
Shit talking Venezuelans has helped me learn a little Spanish.
---
But why? The internet is increasingly toxic, especially among online gamers. Evidently players can't resist the urge to tell each other to tell each other to fuck off or to commit suicide. It does nothing positive for the game and only raises the bar for personal attacks. I'm not personally offended by course language, but you can't seriously tell me the community is better now than it was on release.

Imagine having alkan‚Äôs face, lumbridge hans‚Äô hair, and nieves‚Äô tits.

It's his job to be a mature role model for the community
---
You know what, I've argued, you've argued, and I'm notoriously poor on my communications skills so we obviously aren't understanding what the other is saying. How about we just agree to disagree and leave it at that?
---
Well, it wasn't really that big of a deal. The memes and complaints only lasted 2 days, but I guess this is more of a principle change to show that you guys listen. Well done. Although I'm one of the many that would have voted to keep it there
---
The unfortunate reality is that the only way PvPers can make money is at the expense of someone else. No matter what, most players have to lose money doing PvP. Which means, no matter what, it will be an activity most people don't want to do, because for most of them it isn't really worth the time.
---
The only solution is to make the rewards from PvP come from somewhere else, which sort of defeats the style of "risk-it-all" PvP that OSRS is supposed to have.
---
They‚Äôre trash, don‚Äôt listen to the retards who don‚Äôt care about their time. Unlock the perk that blocks them all without wasting any block slots

Hide the poll results. Everyone wants it and you won't comment on it.

Buffoon.
---
literally the only thing you could say that you are forced into the wilderness for is bis mage cape, and that literally only takes an hour, everything else about the wilderness is optional. PERIOD. it is 100% not required to progress your account or do 'certain contet' that's fact
---
Lol, pvm content in the wild doesnt make life worse for pvmers. You dont have to go there

Bad bot

Where would the corsair ship be in Rimmington? I think the waters nearby Skippy would be too shallow. Maybe southwest of Melzar's Maze?

---
Proselyte, holy wrench, prayer pots. Ardy cloak if you really must
---
It was downvotes 75% because of your exact reasoning, PVMers are some assholes who willingly shit on PVPers because they died doing a clue when they don‚Äôt understand that us pkers have killed naked people before for bank loot. PVMers get all the updates while raking in bank doing very simple boss fights, all while being able to risk nothing (instances and 60 min loot timer LOL). The definition of having your cake and eating it too but still complaining 
---
Nice title

Ow!

There's still bots that go there, I reported like 4-5 directly to one of the anti-cheating mods on Twitter that had gotten to high 90's using hacked accounts.  when watch them could tell they were all using scripts.  Telltale pause when interacting with fallen rock or ladder.  Moving beside the ore sack on exactly same tile before interacting with it every time etc etc.

Oh dear

Magic is kinda expensive to train if I‚Äôm being honest, look up a guide on the best spells to use, I trained melee and collected tunes at the same time. 
---
Air tunes I‚Äôd recommend killing flesh crawler in the security stronghold. But basic tunes like water and mind are about 5 a piece, so it probably cost about 100k to train to 55 probably 
---
Somewhat haunted (Draynor Manor), somewhat magic (wizards tower), somewhat small town
---
Adding a dock to a town like that doesn‚Äôt ruin the cohesiveness of it.

Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
All I can say is thank you snape grass seeds...
---
Same but I would miss it when it is gone
---
Any reasonable poll/survey usually wants to avoid creating biases in the participants. Showing poll results only makes it more likely that a new voter will vote according to what they think is the popular choice. The result is that the first few voters on a poll can have a massive influence on how that poll goes.
---
I know you mean good but I‚Äôve always found it hilarious to see some sweaty chud talking down to a company as a whole, you speak to a team as if they‚Äôre a single person in baby-talk and actually think it‚Äôs going to get somewhere lol
---
And about the poll thing, I don‚Äôt have much information on jagex‚Äôs competence as I don‚Äôt much care or dig into it - I just play the game and lurk - but although I‚Äôve noticed some retarded things they‚Äôve done they are a team within a company that has managed to keep their jobs for this long - saying this don‚Äôt you think there is a greater reason for no hidden poll results besides ‚Äúlul we don‚Äôt know why we no hide results lul playerbase upset‚Äù???

I hadnt played RS in 9 years and then picked up the game again back in august after I picked up WoW again for about a year and then quit back towards the end of Legion and im glad I did. I definitely had fun playing for a good portion of Legion but definitely happy I didnt bother with BFA..shit looks awful and RS has gottenway better since I last played back in 2008.
---
ITT: people complaining about the boat, therefore making people complaining about other people complaining, making an endless cycle of REEEEEEEing

Those were two separate random events.
---
The ent would completely break the axe head and you would have to pay someone to fix it. The axe head flying off you could just pick it up and re-attach.

Wait until next year when Swampletics turns up.

We are broken bots! Hey! We are broken bots!

Holy shit you just described my entire 2006.
---
Then head to falla and insta sell way below market price just cause I couldn't be bothered to wait
---
There's a lot of them. You probably won't get much viewership until much later on. No one really wants to watch the 50th wintertodt---&gt;99 /Getting graceful again type stuff.
---
People will watch you when you reach bosses though. 
---
Your only real options then would have been by calling or mailing the money to them, which would both be a pain in the ass for a 10 year old (or younger).

I was lucky that our family friend's son had a membership to rs that his mom got for him, so my mom figured it was safe. I remember walking around in Kmart with him when we were like 8, he told me he had an obby maul and could wear it, I was jealous af when he showed me at home. 
---
I also remember watching my friend in 2nd grade casting ice rush in the wilderness on a level 50-something acc, I have no clue how a 7 year old did desert treasure with that low of stats but I was so amazed at the time.

You don't see how chasing someone, switching gears and prayers to kill them isn't more run than afk slayerscape?
---
&gt; it helped introduce new players to draynor
---
Idk why this quest specifically is needed to introduce new players to Draynor. It's already a pretty integral part of the game, with a lot of existing quests going there (Vampire Slayer, Prince Ali Rescue, and Dragon Slayer just off the top of my head).
---
While I agree that the screeching is annoying at times, this specific update is a strange hill to die on, and if you're really concerned about the screeching, I suggest waiting until it doesn't affect something as trivial as the placement of a dock, lest you not be taken as seriously. 
---
Black Chins are like 200k xp/hr while herbiboar gets you up to lik 155 xp/hr. It is quite a big difference but those rates are still wayyy higher than other skills that lose you profit. I have literally never used the chaos altar to train prayer and I'm at 80 prayer (nowhere near max and I'll prob use the altar if I decided to max) but I get how people feel the need with all the ehp focus these days. The argument that people are forced is bullshit and you know it. Plenty of people never set foot in the wildy 
---
You don't need those for p2p. In fact, a lot of those will be a pain in the ass to get in f2p but pretty easy in p2p. Mining in f2p, for example, is just a fight against bots. There are a lot less bots in p2p. I don't know why you'd need firemaking or woodcutting to go p2p.

[here's a magic training guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_Magic_training). It's pretty much just kill shit. Magic is very fast to train.
---
&gt;They created an awesome game
---
They do good work, nobody is denying this. But there has been many times when they've put out shit and thanks to this community it has been saved. 
---
&gt;senseless drivel coming from all of the players they work tirelessly to create a game for, whining needlessly about tiny details
---
I am sorry you aren't as passionate about this game than many of us on here. The devs frequently say it means a lot to them when we complain because it shows how much we care. We are quick to praise them too when they do good work. 
---
&gt; that players have no business getting their hands in.
---
This game was relaunched on the premise of the players deciding what happens to it. You must be new. 
---
&gt;It's not a more suitable position
---
Yes it is. PORT sarim is the most adequate location for a large ocean-going ship, not some small village. 
---
&gt;how all of the quests seem to end up there at one point or another
---
No I think most F2P quest don't end up in port sarim. 
---
I always assume the worst people IRL are all the elitist "LMAO Why don't you have have barrows gloves it's so easy?! Just got them it doesn't even take that long!" people on here.
---
If you play this game like a regular amount of time barrows gloves take a very fucking long time to get and you have to be full attention playing the entire time you grind for them. 
---
Wear d hide and a ranging weapon and always hit back when you can.
---
Make sure to switch your prayers according to the combat style being used against you.
---
Make sure to combo heal (shark+karambwan+brew) to survive if your opponent specs you to low hp.
---
If you have mage spells that can freeze, and are comfortable with quick gear switching, get a robe switch and freeze your target in place.
---
You are almost 100% able to escape if you follow these steps. 
---
Now...
---
**You can always fight back and get kills if you're good enough**, regardless of your opponents level/gear advantage. 
---
You can lure them into a false sense of security by pretending to sit on low hp, then as soon as you get unfrozen, make sure you're potted up and praying offense prayers, turn around and go in with your spec weapon.
---
I wish you great kills my friend. Stay on your toes in the wilderness, it's by far the most unpredictable and fun place the game has to offer.
---
Go time him for an hour.  There are 3 guys that do it in the same spot at different times of the day.  Each has their own speed.  The top guy easily pulls 12m an hour doing it

That's the wilderness....Killing other players is the point. Calling them sociopaths just makes you look retarded. And apparently since you can pk for shit, now you're going to /iamverybadass route. Lmao.

/thread.

The other comments are just bitching or are poor suggestions on fighting back.

Why ru being downvoted? For killing people in pvp areas? The hivemind of this subreddit is pathetic
---
sure why not?

I just came back two weeks ago after quitting in 2009 for good. Anyone else bored and want to join up on a discord or something though? There don't seem to be too many of those around.

Alch them all, and then yourself

Don't wanna risk getting killed don't go into wildy?

Dump, people want faster exp and dbones are better for that.

Ah I see. At least an honest mistake than a blatant repost.

If any jagex mods see this , lock the account king tubbs

Dude might as well delete his comment lmfao
---
Click intensive skilling always ends up being blast furnace, tick manipulating, minnows and similar things. There needs to be a balance between risk and reward for things in any game to work properly, combat is only rewarding because it is risky. Merging non-combat skills with combat activities is the only way I can think of that would justify them being rewarding, because combat is the only thing that is actually risky in this game.
---
Thank you for confirming what I said. The skills name is Runecraft. The fact that most people wrongly call it runecrafting is irrelevant and doesn't make it official. 
---
Just bring max melee, cannon, a few sharks and piety. Can do a whole trip without using 1 sip sup restore
---
You spend 20 hours training your stats and you want to have a chance against people who spend hundreds of hours on their stats lol
---
If using Runelite, mark the tile of the spawn of one of them, place 4 boxes around the spawn and shoot the chin if it runs away to get it to respawn back in between your boxes. This works better if you are tick manipulating. Bring swamp tar, a clean guam, and a pestle and mortar. Use the tar and guam on each other then quickly click to set the trap. Rinse repeat.
---
I see your comment. Hope that helps
---
Just train your slayer you will begin to turn profits around 50-60 slayer.

Why did you upload an image with only 2 pixels.

I walked around port sarim in circles like an idiot for quite a while yesterday asking everyone "where is Zeah boat?"
---
Western provinces hard diary opens up a private section, very few people there, normally an open world
---
If this were the case people would use a mith scimmy to level and a whip for actual damage, what's your point? 
---
I quit a few weeks before Christmas and started play rs on the side now I can‚Äôt stop playing it again. Pretty fun doing all the stuff I never got around to doing as a kid. 
---
Only... Obby konar assigns hydras brother 
---
So glad they added mobile, my mum fills the tub and i can keep playing without risking laptop (which is what i used to do)
---
It‚Äôs for the PKers, not the PVMers.    That‚Äôs incentive to get more people out there.   
---
My wife calls it (along with most other computer games I play) "that stupid game." I usually respond with a question about her 100 hours of recorded TV shows. 
---
How much did you have to save up for plastic surgery then?
---
They should just hide them till you have voted ban 3rd party clients from showing it. I am sure reddit mods will also make a rule against showing results. This should solve most of the "bias" without removing anything from anyone.
---
Niice,
---
It does, thank you! Wasnt sure if I was banned or muted or something. Dont really know how Reddit works honestly :s
---
agreed. 73 RC, never stepped into the abyss for runecrafting (except to get pouches ofc)
---
I have like 300 vork kc and the pet lol
---
92 mage and you can't kill them with Fire Wave or Iban Blast? Just buy anti-dragonfire pots. 
---
ever heard of rng? u baboon 
---
Who hurt you lol
---
Konar IS NOT ABOUT XP. It's about gp. 
---
Harpie bugswarm that is
---
lol, next it‚Äôll be squeal of fortune and then eoc
---
Summoning is bad because of Pak Yak and other Beast of Burdens to make you lolcamp everything. Literally bring 40+ sara brews on a pak yak.
---
Remove them, and it's pretty sweet.
---
I would like some of the pets introduced from Summoning tbh.
---
I wish I had my life that together. I‚Äôd take being lame over the fucking alcoholic piece of trash I am 
---
He's only buying alchables from the store.  Each kill is around 100k
---
This is not equivocal. Flax and sand is resource gathering whereas your newest example is resource processing. /u/killtasticfever is correct.
---
The proposed changes introduce a new method of resource gathering that is multiple times more efficient than current methods and also allows for the training of an additional skill at the same time (mining). That is untenable.
---
Protip, get an alt, while doing afk stuff with main progress alt and vice versa. Just hit 99 fishing with alt :D
---
I see how that can be frustrating but clues are literally just free gold for having to go around the world (the puzzle aspect is basically non existant with 3rd party clients). I don't actually consider that stopping your account from progressing no matter how badly you want that lucky 3rd age drop.
---
No pray pots needed with bonecrusher necklace it‚Äôs comfy to use and barely slower 
---
will vote no to every pvp poll
---
:)
---
Look at all those shaggies
---
I'm getting harry potter cards art vibes from it. Well done.
---
Have you even played Dark Souls?? Getting invaded and analed by min/maxed account was my whole first 40 hours of that game.. gtfo here with that ‚Äúother communities don‚Äôt do this‚Äù shit.
---
Monkey madness for d scim. The grand tree, Tree gnome village and fairy tale1 for transportation. You have to start fairy tale2 to get fairy rings, but you won‚Äôt need any of the skill reqs the quest says. 
---
I don't intend to give up sorry about that. However I am interested to know why it should not happen in your opinion. I genuinely am.
---
I can relate! LmaoüòÇ
---
How about stop letting memes and people that call other players autistic dictate what content you produce from a 3rd party website? 
---
This information should be posted on your actual website not here. 
---
The problem is that it is very hard for new players to get into pking because everyone has these min maxed accounts that take hundreds of hours to make, not to mention the millions of gp you will lose until you reach a certain level. So because new people aren't joining the pk scene (or at least not a lot) Jagex has decided to put pvm content in the wildy to entice pvmers to come into the wildy with gold, while at the same time give the pvpers something to kill.
---
The problem with this is that it leads to what we have now where there is so much hostility between the two communities. Pvmers just want the pkers to leave them alone so they can make more money, whereas the pkers just want to fight stuff in "their" area, so to try and give themselves the best chance as possible, pvmers vote down the pvp updates, because why would they vote for something that hurts them.
---
Its a tough situation to deal with, but IMO Jagex needs to find a way to reduce the entry into pvp and also encourage pvpers to fight other pvpers over pvmers. I'm not sure how this would be best done, but thats just my 2c.
---
Getchya google up

An preferably move it the Lunar Isles. 
---
Only McLovin could make a comment as great as this one.
---
So much this... Can't expect real updates to pass if the community loses their shit over a small thing like that
---
You're a lost cause. I've tried to explain to you how important the wildy is for the game but it goes into your eyes and out your ass.
---
Wildy is completely optional guys. The removal of the wildy had nothing to do with the fall of osrs. Let's just ignore all the other comments in the thread discussing how important the wildy is for the game. It's completely unnecessary.
---
Can't believe I wasted brain cells trying to penetrate your 30inch diameter skull with some info regarding the wildy and it's importance.
---
Get blocked.
---
The fuck are you going on about? I played wow since classic and never had any form of "microtransaction" shoved in my face. Well over 200 pets, like 60 mounts, and none of them payed for with irl cash.
---
The fuck is a recall animation? Hearthstones?
---
Leave the corsairs ship where it is. Veos doesn't need to be in front of his own ship because he's a shady little bitch anyway 
---
so torvesta multi logging on 3 accounts to pk people at mage bank should be bannable too?
---
Hmm, you can try the official client. Maybe it‚Äôs less resource intensive?
---
Awesome! GL on the zulrah grind!
---
Yeah, this is what I thought from the beginning as well. Would also put money on Jigglesex alt account fueling the fire to remove the dock and keep the bar.
---
I wrote that like it was a Youtube title or something, but thanks anyway.

We already have two teleports to POH

What‚Äôs jagex cup?
---
This is it chief 
---
It was Jan 2008, so like 6 months after OSRS.
---
I... I am grateful... but I don't even... why? 
---
Maybe I've misunderstood, but I genuinely thought that the main issue the community had that those two changes were **unpolled**. Okay, so you've got the communication down this time, which is a great improvement. It's just that... aren't we repeating the same thing as last week? I don't mean moving the dock back to Port Sarim, that is fine as it was an unpolled change. I mean moving the issue to the Corsairs' ship and creating a new **unpolled** dock near Rimmington...
---
I'm sorry, why does the Corsairs' ship need to be moved? You say something about making space. I thought that both Veos's ship as the Corsairs' ship were in Port Sarim previously.
---
In my opinion this whole "X Marks the Spot" was a mistake. It shouldn't have been aimed at F2P players that just completed Tutorial Island. Now we're all kind of weird and unnecessary changes for a small F2P quest to introduce and promote members content.
---
Now I realize that my personal opinion doesn't matter one bit, but **can we at the very least poll moving Corsairs' ship**? Let the entire community speak, don't repeat the same mistake. That's all I ask.
---
He came back. https://imgur.com/RP3CT9a

Can confirm, my wife and I both play RS and we are both virgins.
---
Summoning is bad if it can't be separated from pvp.  That shit was hella annoying.  Between raids, tob, and that new elf shit we basically have dungeoneering. 
---
Aren't 90% bots ?
---
Humor(?)
---
Never said any of that. 
---
You're going to lose a good chunk of dps not having the slayer helm (i) bonus, as you need to wear a facemask. I'm sure you'd still profit, but you'll get less gp/h and xp/h off task.
---
Waterfall quest and fight arena are some good experience
---
Chu say Bwana?
---
I don't believe you lol
---
Well I can't speak for all nerds but MTG nerds spend all their money on MTG. It's like Warhammer 40k but instead of having to be good at painting and knowing other nerds with 5,000 dollar collections of figurines the game hires artists to make sick shit and you just collect it.
---
Still just as expensive but half the effort needed. MTG Nerds allocate their money to cards, not unnecessary things like belts. A belt never helped you win a tournament.
---
Tree gnome village and grand tree are cool for unlocking fast travel options 
---
The guild thins and crafting analogy you made is fucking Ssiiiiickk i hope they add that.
---
Don't believe you whatsoever. You're calling pkers toxic, and then go on to be incredibly toxic? Ironic. 
---
I‚Äôll sit down. I‚Äôm sorry. 
---
I was gona say that gg
---
That actually looks awesome great work!

I might just burst mm2 caves then. I‚Äôve got some money to burn and I only want to get to 75 for now for DS2.

Just play RS3 on legacy you damn kids

I mean most poeple saying that the post 2007 updates are trash are also the ones screaming for a nerf to the blowpipe
---
\&gt;you can only cast Superglass make as fast as 500 times an hour with mousekeys.
---
Laughably false.
---
I actually agree with what you're getting at. I fucking hated cata and MoP. Strangely enough, I liked WoD and legion was one of my favorites. Bfa is just trash though.
---
Look at this point, you are just being a passive ass. Yes, I google searched, and reddit searched, for literally hours last night, and could not solve my issue within Runelite. My job is research based so I know how to find my own information. What you linked still does not solve the issue I am having.
---
If you do not have anything more to add then what has already been said in all these threads than kindly, fuck off.
---
You know ive always thought about it. I just dont want to pay another $11 a month for an alt, and f2p training just doesnt seem worth the time invested. I dont know any low-med level money making methods that can get you can pay for its bonds and make you some money just having a main would seem to make more money than the time invested in an alt before it starts becoming profitable, and just having to redo quests and such.
---
Now I really have an impulse to buy one,  wouldn't mind having a tapestry of the map to hang on my wall as well. Now im going to google...
---
&gt;Just drop the clues lmao
---
Is not acceptable. I have no impact on getting a wilderness step. Every skilling method is a conscious choice. This isn't. Every wilderness skilling method is either cheaper, more exp/hour or more gp/hour. You choose a higher reward at a higher risk. That's fair.
---
Getting a wilderness step is neither. It has no impact on the number of steps you have to do or the reward. If it did, it would be fair. If I could opt out of going to the wilderness, it would be fair. I can't do that.
---
There is no way around it: I am forced to go into the wilderness to complete my clue. A clue step in the wilderness is not comparable to skilling methods that you choose to do, accepting the risks in order to get higher profits.
---
Community Events have never been polled.
---
No your list of content that requires the wildy is good but it's far from account blocking. Those capes you mentioned are a way to show your mastery of the game, the wildy is important in that regard as it shows you have knowledge of the game as a whole. I get what you're saying but you seem to have a huge hate boner going on.
---
I like the idea of a quest point requirement but having votes count MORE than others? Scuffed ass American politics if you ask me .
---
Thank you so much!
---
i'm quitting :/
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone is opposed to a new skill, just one that is tedious and slow like RC. Warding looks like trash, cool concept but how they pitched training it looks dreadful. 
---
Probably losing his virginity 
---
naturally flavourer by daddy? hmmmmmmmmmmmm....
---
I mean believe what you want I only ever made my money on runescape post wildly and trade reversal and have only ever made pure/pking accounts since 2006 once wilderness came back I made about a bill mid tier pking at 73-76 and was part of a few clans such as tlp none of this hunting people down without items in a group of 4-8 people 
---
I forgot these existed. Now I miss it :/
---
i feel like skilling could really benifit from having more minigames in the game imo. its easy to work a rare drop into a minigame but the problem is if its not the best exp an hour its obsolite in the mind of most skillers, and if its the best exp AND gp an hour, then it breaks the meta, so theres really no easy answer. id personally like to see a construction minigame thats like, a castle defense against enemies cap \~80k con exp an hour 
---
The Jagex Clan Cup is an annual community event hosted by Jagex, and occasionally players on their behalf, that brings clans together to battle it out in a series of challenges.
---
The first Clan Cup to be held was the Jagex Clan Cup 2009, which included competitions based around combat, skilling, and experience. There was no prize for winning it, however prizes were included in the following years' competitions.
---
I grabbed this from the wiki.

I believe that you have a six figure job and a girlfriend, unfortunately Dr. Phil diagnosed you as being not alright, so I'd go with that Bob.

The fucking chicken
---
Haha nice
---
miss em too mate :3
---
Generally i try to. But some quests are not intuitive and the whole mindset of "QoL bad" around here makes it unlikely for that to change, so if i'm stuck i generally google it.
---
For example, how the hell was i supposed to know that the poison salesman in seer's village would sell me non-alcoholic beer during frem trials? No hints from any related npc's, not really intuitive to guess that either... Googled that one.
---
I'd personally recommend you also afk alch onyx bolts (e), if you're looking for an afk option.
---
You replied to me saying I probably can‚Äôt pk guess you didn‚Äôt say that my bad 
---
What a champion. Wearing a dfs to range a creature that doesn't need antifire protection.  
---
The post is not asking for QoL items. It's just asking for polls that have failed that the community is interested in re-polling. 
---
I opened it to see if this was just a sad meme. Even more sad, it wasn't. 
---
Yeah but someone else is going to do that, and I can just drop off and go back to mining. Or if it's broken when I'm collecting, I can still withdraw from the sack and deposit everything and it'll be fixed before I get back with my next load. 
---
Engine work though
---
lmao that's what I forgot to get when I started slaying again the other day...
---
So what is wrong with bringing the grindiest of OSRS in line with the grindiest of other MMORPGs, especially I OSRS could attract and retain more new players?
---
people are alching themselves
---
Bfa is just so bland imo. Nothing was immersive about the whole xpac. I found myself just racing to 120 so I could play the game just to remember that there was no 120 content at the beginning of the xpac lol.
---
Reddit is honestly not the place to poll the level of interest considering this is mostly pvmers and not the entirety of the playerbase. That would be like doing the same poll at sharkbrew and seeing it be damn near 100%. 
---
why shouldn't it?
---
all of the easy scape iron meme questions didn't pass, so let's repoll it. Nice. The majority of the questions from skilling QOL poll aren't even quality of life.
---
Dude are you new? The entire point of OSRS is that it's community driven. Jagex isn't to be trusted alone.
---
Probably bonds. Its a couple hours worth of pay for someone with a decent job.
---
Your crossbow and bolts are going to be the most important so worry about them. Rune crossbow will be your go to crossbow. I'm not sure however if a rune crossbow can use enchanted dragon bolts so you might have to just settle for standard enchanted ruby and diamond bolts if it cannot, if it can then go ahead and buy 300 of each. Full black dhide with glory and barrows gloves will be your best gear setup for that amount of cash since you'll need a bit of food and pots for attempts. 
---
Quest cape was going so well for me untill i needed 65 agility =/
---
I thought it only tracked your kills and drops since it came out? 
---
In F2P, there is so much competition for mining spots (mainly due to bots). Urinals = rocks and many people double even triple stack for a single rock to mine

Whatever Asian mmo you were playing definitely was not WoW. You have to click on a little button in the mini bar, then click down the ui that pops up for pets and mounts.

A lot of text to say nothing lmao

Why even bother if it's not bronze dagger mouse upside down karamja locked him?

I did it with 30hp, you‚Äôre good

Not really? Indeed stats are what? Like 70 melees? That quest isnt hard, just tedious. 
---
I used to be this way -- I am still liquidating my alt's crap. 
---
My main don't have a bank and I'm doing just fine. I think a lot of people don't realize how much clutter is in their bank. You guys have POH, STASHes and GE sets to condense things down. He's got so much low tier gear that it is eating up his slayer tab. I'd hate to see the rest of his bank.

Where would you put it, interests? Depending on who you talk to, you shouldn't even include an interests section. If you're applying for a field in which you should have publications you won't even have room for it.

I got a Galaxy 8 last november, and it's been my best phone in 10 years. I found out to much sadness however that what I really wanted was the Galaxy Note or whatever it's called. I swear to you I have tried everything including Jesus trying to get a stylus to work on the Galaxy 8 and for the life of me I can't get anything to work.
---
I still love my phone but I'd love it 1000% more if I could actually play runescape.
---
*Typed out by the My Fingers are too Fat  to enjoy OSRS Gang*
---
I play both, OSRS for the chill skilling, questing and WoW for the actual PvM and intensity.
---
Thank you man
---
You put an /s at the end but what you said sounds 100% great to me.
---
And ive seen way to many of my favorite games ruined by developers that are completely out of touch with their community to not believe if they made decisions they wouldnt ruin this one too.
---
Anyone that was around for RS3 knows exactly why we need polls. Jagex has a revolving door of mods that at any time could bring in bad ideas with them. Id rather not leave it to chance.
---
Yeah but the pet is so sick haha
---
You guys got mad at a port and they had to keep you whiny children happy. 
---
I like the tools they offer, but I‚Äôm not willing to be a part of something so destructive. The features coming in for PVP are shocking! Autoswitching crap... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Unless someone paid you to level an account nope. You were getting paid to do something else. Rather you did that job or not, you played a game on your phone throughout the day. You don't get paid to play mobile games lmao

Unless you have at least a mid level ironman i dont think you can really understand how much bankspace is a problem for us. BUT they are coming out with seed vault soon to store all seeds. Once they do that it will be a milllion times better

shit.. I started in 2015 and I don't even have full graceful
---
Looked dumb

Extremely crowded and people competing for the same rock

Because it's not PvM.
---
If they polled Slayer 2, which was just Slayer but again, it would probably pass.
---
Found the noob guys!
---
Depends how fucked you were to begin with
---
Please chill with the swampletics memes everytime I see one I think a new video is uploaded and I get very excited for nothing
---
It's February the no update month the tiny things matter.
---
I think it's telling that the favorite group activity my buddy and I have is doing Barrows together, not even a real multiplayer minigame. He's a much higher combat level than me, and in order to make things more entertaining for himself(and me) he has to play Dharok roulette. Personally, I love soloing Wintertodt but he just can't get into doing it at all. Like OP said there's no real variety to anything but Slayer and killing things.
---
Anyone who disagress with me is autistic!!!!!!

To me most of the sound effects are useless and annoying. A goblin isn't going to try and flank me so I don't really think I need sound like I would in a shooter

I thought it did fail, but they increased it to 5 with the last [update](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/x-marks-the-spot?oldschool=1):

&gt;The Serpentine Helm

&gt;The Strength bonus of the Serpentine helm has been increased from +3 to +5 to make it more viable relative to its cost.

For someone trying their hardest to project an air of indifference and superiority to minor issues, you sure seem bothered by the fact that other people did not like something.

You should be able to add skill capes to poh without the need of the hood, And please add a rack for achievement diary armour.

A poll with such obvious biases is inherently flawed.. You may not think it's a big deal but these are the polls that determine what goes into the game or not. I'd say that's pretty goddamn significant. 
---
Looked shit
---
Agree they should add EoC and MTX as game integrity
---
Yeah, I sure hope he does.
---
If by shitload you mean 2 because im not about to chop another 50 yews for a third
---
And then they yell at you for being on the same vein as you, ugh.
---
How is it not related... You want to weight votes based on time played and other things that would severely favor players who have simply been around for longer.
---
That's like saying "You can vote in elections at 18 but your vote will be worth 1/3rd of someone's vote who is 54 years old because theu have 3x the life experience compared to you." Which is obviously insane - so why would this be literally any different...

---
Sorry. The wildy is the wildy. Been that way since the start of RS.
---
Haha you are definately new if you trust OSRS devs. The community is the main reason the game is the way it is. If they have free reign we'd be in a shit spot right now.
---
Needs mega Ranis Drakan
---
Yeah I really wish you could get the styluses from the note series to work on the S series, the notes are too damn big to be comfortable to hold and use but the stylus is super nice
---
"Not like something"? That's one thing. Making a big theatre drama, spotlight and curtains included, that's another.
---
Not a noob, just not an EHP fanatic.
---
That's an oof.  Kinda sucks someone had tickets saved up.
---
OSRS has more players than it ever has. There's statistics out there that put it as the largest MMO right now. Dead game tho amirite
---
surely runemake is not as bad as you purport it to be
---
Cor blimey! I lost my boyfriend and my job and now my clan gets gwassed out for millions of money. It's time for me to sit in a channel for hours on end just to kick an innocent member. Luckily all my clan members are recruited based on their level of retardedness so they will not realize how shit we are at catching the spy. Guess I will just tell them it was lucky they randomly found us! Fuck me I need some d\*ck so bad :(
---
Pub is aiight
---
This is the 2nd best thing I have seen all week, his last ep being the 1st. 11/10
---
Why, so the contrarians can vote no to get their rocks off? Fuck that. It was moved originally no poll so it goes back no poll.
---
Just today I have done this quest
---
Oh okay thanks will note 
---
I don't think this is a good suggestion.
---
1- PP is in a good spot, the exp is good and Scepter is very valuable.
---
2- The minigame is boring indeed, but this change wouldn't really make it less so.
---
3- The reward is very self contained, it's a PP reward that makes it easier... to do PP? It doesn't affect the game outside of the minigame.
---
rock make &gt;:(
---
I went to the crafting guild and filled up on gold and walked back to east falador bank.

&gt; They can't do UI rescaling without actual engine work, that will literally never happen.

Are people really this clueless? You can do UI scaling on the official OSRS client **right now** with the **-Dsun.java2d.uiScale** flag. Don't need a special client for it, and it works on any OS.

r/approximately65%sureiswoosh
---
GM items, and artifacts/artifact weapons!
---
Heil yeah! 
---
The engine is in Java so it‚Äôd be Java - content for game elements is script based RuneScript but the engine itself is java which chat system is part of from my understanding
---
He is an ironman he must congratulate himself
---
Congrats again! :D
---
It takes it out of your prayer points tho. That's why it didn't pass.
---
 most osrs pvm prayer is waaaay more important than tanking the hits. It just doesn't ha e a use in osrs.
---
&gt;We both know that's not how things are done these days for regular accounts, if you want an item you go for the best gp per hour and buy it off the ge from people who know how to handle themselves in the wilderness.
---
That's pretty much exactly what I said. " A) receive that item themselves, or B) *buy it from someone who received it themselves*."
---
&gt; Combined they take an hour at best, maybe more if you get unlucky. Deal with it. 
---
Right, but the fact you have to go there for BiS gear proves my original point. Adding non-PvP BiS items and locking them behind content in the Wilderness makes life worse for non-PvPers who really don't want to participate in PvP.
---
The time spent is thankfully not very much, but updates that are for "PvP" almost make that brief time spent in the Wilderness worse. Non-PvPers will look at a change that makes it easier for them to be killed, and vote no.
---
PvPers see a change to Tele Block or Bind and see "Improvements to PvP", but non-PvPers see a change to Tele Block or Bind and see "more ways I'm going to get fucked in the Wilderness." They're not voting no out of spite; they're voting no because they don't want *their* experience to be made *even worse.*
---
No. Just no.
---
you can't literally AFK in NMZ without macroing, i have no clue what you're going on about
---
I guess the chat system might be in Java, with some API's in RuneScript, hmm
---
Torag would be good or any barrows platebody. Yes, go with just the tank platebody, you won't need the black d'hide body since you pray mage against Ahrim. 
---
 
---
Heard it spells out ‚Äúyou all are whiny little bitches about the draynor dock‚Äù when you unscramble it 
---
I mean... it takes two seconds to try it for yourself...
---
Black ibis?
---
Im in the exact same boat. Still hyped for classic tho!
---
insane value cost remain 10m?
---
Because the jmods don't like it when the community doesn't like their ideas. They know the polls will snowball and more often than not, pass. If they were hidden i think thered be a lot more variety in response
---
Op has shit gear and stats for tanking (no offence)
---
It's pretty simple. You guys didn't even poll this. It changed several iconic locations in the game overnight, as well as confusing people. Three reasons right there.
---
ME TOO!
---
True. I have full Veracs anyway. 
---
True but I think it would still be more useful than his pea shooter dps.
---
You literally called guth trash then compared its usage with that of a notoriously bad mainhand. May not have been the meaning you meant to imply, but it's absolutely the impression i got reading it. 
---
I didn't.
---
They offer membership, no different.
---
Played WotLK, Cata, and MoP. Raided quite a bit but got glad as feral in all 3 expansions. Took a break during WoD came back for legion to find PvP so dull. They pruned it so much. Played first month or so of BFA and PvP was even worse. Watched Dew win blizzcon, switched to OSRS and I‚Äôm never going back.
---
Don‚Äôt think removal was discussed, just nerfing xp rates and removing imbues. 
---
Okay it could indeed. But then it's copyright infringement as it is jagex's IP (coming from someone who made a rsps)
---
lol every1 knows serene is mrmole73 2.0 so leave alone
---
&gt; -Add Marks of Grace to all Agility Courses  
---
this would make my future agility pet grind so nice.
---
go off, i got one to use at shilo and realize now it doesn't even hold soft gems. its annoying as shit
---
Some kind of puzzle I would guess... 
---
I‚Äôd suggest looking online for some kind of osrs specific community and post this on a forum or something. You‚Äôd probably get some specific details on what you‚Äôre looking at, as opposed to these generic answers. 
---
Hill giants in the edgeville dungeon
---
And the lore breaking count check 
---
Runelite allows you to stretch the ui, it keeps it nice and clean too. 
---
Yeah possibly but then theres a whole team of dedicated devs so the payroll would be massive. Jagex clearly arent prepared to pay it.
---
I have played RS since ~2004. Been muted the whole time. I use most MMO's and ARPG's.
---
It's a fair argument for sure and a premise that soooo many other examples in the game set.
---
But in this case, it's a case of "more effort = laughably significantly increased reward". There's obviously many ways to argue what it "should" have been, but the extra reward for sandstone being more effort could easily be justified as the gained mining exp (which is a very moderate amount) and certainly not that exp in addition to being ~4-5x faster.
---
That's why some skills are so boring because if you cant do it most efficiently its not worth doing. But if it is better to do the actual skill for the resource would make it more profitable and enjoyable.
---
Those are brutals. You have to pray mage
---
Ah I figured if his friend tanked with bis melee gear they'd get more kills although maybe less per hours 
---
What I can say is that I'm glad I abused the draynor Dock to do client of kourend on my new account today
---
It won't. DDS spec will always be better than Abby spec since it doesn't have the 15% damage reduction (max 44-44 vs 40-40).
---
Pk them when they grab ores
---
&gt; You won't get full graceful by using xp lamps.
---
Not arguing it's efficacy with you, simply stating that im not a noob and you can stop being a dick. 
---
Where's that Patrick and Man Ray meme...
---
"Did you read the warning sign?" Yes.
---
"So you understand that other players can kill you here?" Yes.
---
"So I'm going to kill you" No come on man I'm just doing a clue
---
mep2 was released just a few months after abyss rc so it was definitely the same design process there I think
---
I mean... You can change those to be whatever you want.
---
do we really need 500 topics of the same shit... like jesus cant you guys just look before posting spam?
---
nothing in wow is engaging lol
---
so they purposely made the abyss to access the death altar easier...
---
GoodGuyZeeBtw
---
easyscape af. Lets have a portal in lumbridge that teles you to ge next?
---
That's very fair. At least you'll make a metric fuck-ton of gold off herby crystals? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

---
If you're talking long term, it's just inflation. Yes, money is easier to get now.
---
Short term, the free twitch/amazon prime membership trail is supposedly bringing in lots of bots. 
---
Holy shit
---
Because I sure as hell did 95 agility with xp lamps...... My 3k staminas are fake as well.
---
I'd be a lot more willing to participate in PvP if you didn't lose everything. I realize a lot of people love that risk, so I'm not really proposing it be taken away; it's just not for me, is all, especially in a game like OSRS where most of my success in PvP boils down to RNG. You quickly reach a point where you can't perform any better; you're just waiting for your good plays to actually deal lethal damage.
---
Use normal fuck offs
---
Probably christmas hype over. Generally in holiday time they hike the prices cause people have surplus real money. Why are you looking at the websites tho? ü§î
---
You were able to 6hour afk nix for years lol 
---
Why did I just get the email for this 5 minutes ago 
---
Soon as I read the word solo.
