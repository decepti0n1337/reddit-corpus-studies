Justiciar is incredibly shit at mage defence so idk why you gave em +8 mage def when the other items give negative bonuses.

World 344, never not gotten a game

Alright, was just a bit worried that the 3 d scims were just as rare as some other item, akin to the 3 cabbages being as rare as the 3rd age table. Thanks.
---
Guthans are a life saver. You dont have to worry about wasting and saving brews for the later waves. 70 pray you'll be good man just remember when jad does a tall stomp its mage and a quick stomp its range. Dont go by the sounds, it makes so much harder
---
Suicide to lumbridge then walk to GE
---
Yeah, I also stopped typing while trading and stuff. So all they did was see me type it a bit and muted me, wasn't reasonable by any means. It is kind of shady though that someone can shadow mute you, without reason, or notification.
---
Is it bugged though? I have done hundreds of runs on attas and I tend to get 9-12 herbs per seed. (99 farm, max Cape, and all herb-boosting diaries)
---
Oh shit. Fixed.

Restores restore more prayer and are cheaper until about 50 prayer and even after that they are just marginally more expensive.

We have chosen to run this giveaway as a give back to the users and subscribers of the website as a celebration for our 3 year anniversary, and as a thank you to those that have supported us.
---
We are not aware of this breaching RWT and we ensure that we, and by extension, our Discord community, do not break official game rules. If you can find an official post stating that this is against the rules, then we will remove the premium element of the giveaway, and refund users that have subbed and immediately entered into the raffle.

Killed over 4k goblins and all I got was like 50 begginer clues. Was trying to farm easy clues... I dont think they drop them anymore. Just one more way for jagex to waste hours of my life.

I like to use both sound and visual. It the sound starts when he lifts, it mage, if it’s quiet when he lifts its range.

I’d bring a few more range pots

    Real-world trading is the term used for activities which occur outside of the game environment which result in the real-world sale or purchase of items, GP or services with the intention of supplying or advancing a Jagex in-game character other than by the means that are incorporated into the game.  
---
  
---
It is clear that a real-world purchace of a subscription to ge-tracker results in advancing an in-game character, namely providing them with a large amount of in-game currency or an expensive item.  
---
The fact that the purchase only results in a chance at the item, and not the item itself, is not enough to get around this rule. For instance, what if a RWT site sold a 99% chance at getting 1m, for a 10% discount on their normal price? This would clearly still be against the rules.  
---
The fact that the giveaway can be accessed for free also does not bypass the rule. For instance, what if a RWT site gave away 1m to someone for every 100m they sold on their website? Or gave away 1m for free to a random person who signs up, but gave people 1000x the chance of winning for a small fee. This would clearly still be against the rules.

I forgot to re open the CC after a mass clear today. I apologize for this inconvenience.

CC mass clears happen multiple times on weekends. We do this to remove inactive members from the CC creating more room for others to join to find worlds.
---
Also, I don't have mental breakdowns lol its not hard to follow the CC rules of not being racist, sexist, or homophobic. If you consider banning everyone who violates those rules as having a mental breakdown then I guess I'm nuts.

Get 2 more construction levels and youll be base 60s! Maybe knock out another 99 try fletching its super quick and afk and itll get you your trimmed cape!

Well you don’t lose your status without dying lol so something happened where maybe you accidentally logged in after you put your phone away
---
troll post nice bait

With attas seed ?

The new one is the smaller one. The intent was to make something I can move.
---
How do i change my cursor to a Runescape item?
---
My point is jagex are not going to give f2p players more things because they are not benefiting monetarily
---
Easily
---
While drag imps may give ya faster elites when doing the efficiency Calc, at least for players where money is still relevant to them you also have to add in the time it takes to make back the money lost on dragon imps.  From what I’ve seen most people who know what they are doing are using the imps that drop meds for the chance at rangers and then doing the masters that drop as it isn’t as destructive to your cash stack as d imps.
---
This has been my experience on every MMO I've played. I don't give advice anymore unless asked. Sucks to see people do terrible methods like this but eh they'll learn eventually. Or quit.
---
exactly so no need for them to be similar when we dont have 10m different pots
---
RIP and all, but look at that fucking bear model lmao
---
My phone goes in my backpack and doesnt come out until my lunch. It's got a passcode and accidental touch protection. It's possible but highly unlikely.
---
Most players, at least most players that are on consistently, could afford to blow 10m if they wanted because that's a small percentage of their bank. Not all players can afford to blow 100m like it's nothing.
---
nmz isnt worth it until around 70 stats anyway.

after that you'll want to do it so you can imbue rings as well.

I thought the same thing.  Nothing in there.  But RIP to those implings.
---
5 doses is 1.25 guthix rest
---
Also of course you dont lose your status without dying. Hence the post trying to figure out if theres a way to actually see what happend because I most definitely was not playing when he died. I know for a fact Jagex would know what happened.

Time to crowdfund the purchase of Jagex, turn it out for an IPO like a cheap slut turning tricks, cash out and short the stock. When it finally bottoms out, buy it out, take it private with the money off the short, delete all MTX except bonds, remove subscription. Profit.

---
I'm 83/94/83 in my melees, with 88 range, so a little bit higher than yours, but not enough to make a huge difference. And as for the food, the faster your kills are, the less food you'll need, and in my experience there's been a lot of correlation between higher BGS specs and faster kills. When I only get 40-50 between my specs, then kills end up taking closer to 4 minutes and I have to use more of my food, but if I get up into the 100+ range then I may only have to eat once or twice and I'm much more likely to have a shot at a second kill that trip.
---
I’ve seen times like that before but those people are usually like mid 80s range using regular void and a blowpipe
---
Works like a charm, pm me if you want me to double your gold instead tho

Yeah, so how is it?

Sweet, my last question would be if you use rune darts for your kills? I tested it but it doesn't seem to make a large dent in my kill times as I was expecting for the large price increase. Thanks for your input and help mate, cheers!

My stats are way lower. Around 80s and I do raids 3 times a week. I have like 50 kc. You just have to find a team who is willing to take you. It also helps that I did a lot of research before my first learner raid. I only died once. So they took me to other ones cause they liked my personality and respected my effort.

thank you, Mod Ash
---
You do know that the game will prioritize the pet you get over the resource you are gathering, right? /u/TovarishGaming same question.
---
Yeah, it's a shame you don't get points for actually trying to defend your side, but still doing it actually makes the minigame a lot more fun for me. I don't stick around the insides, but rather I cut 4 logs beforehand so that I can assure that if someone left the doors open, I'll be the last one through to close them. I play offensively like normal until a ravager pops out, in which I immediately freeze in place with ZGS spec or until doors need defended or repaired. I also notice my teammates help me prioritize taking down the ravagers when they see them getting frozen, which is pretty cool.
---
Wow, thank you so much for this! I didn't realize I could build an altar already and am only a couple levels away from being able to boost for the lowest pool. Cheers mate, I just went and built an altar and going to grind out to 57 con this week.

farm runs haven't been worth doing for years since everyone and their brother does them now. in 2008 you could legitimately make bank doing farm runs, it was a straight up top tier money maker (per time spent doing it). not anymore though lol.

No barrage is the highest lvl spell. I can’t remember the exact words but it’s like rush burst blitz barrage I think. For sire specifically the higher lvl shadow spell you use on him the longer he will stay asleep
---
Thanks guys.
---
I’ve found a cheap i5-5200U laptop, I expect that’d run much better ? 4gb Ram too.

Seriously. Even the starter content of members is 100x better than F2P. I would prioritize finding a way to secure $11 a month to enjoy it.
---
ok but blitz and barrage are both 30 second sleeps. i guess ill just try the lower level ones on my own lol thnx for the reply though.
---
Haha ty dude. Honestly im glad - I feel like its been building up over a while :P im like 2.3k dry on a whip (2 whips at like 2800 kc) and ive got 5 zenytes now at about 1k kc. I love demonic gorillas though. But ive been getting the shittiest fucking weighted tasks dude for literally 2 weeks i believe since my last BD task. I finally got one today and it's a whopper 249 :D fucking 8 kills in..fucking zenyte. I was already happy and trip well worth it. But a 2nd 80 kills later? Holy shit man. 
---
I still got 164 left! Plus the black mask earlier. Feeling awesome with an extra 30m to the bank! Just bought and banked 83 con that ive been saying im gonna do forever lmao. Now I got a nice cash stack again and not sure what to buy. Prob gonna invest in some skilling. 
---
Seriously tho I'm amazed more people dont farm demonic gorillas. Theyre fucking great tasks dude. Even without a zenyte they're awesome money. But zenytes being 1/300 seems low honestly. Ive gotten like 5 ballista springs and 1 of the other ones but no tails or frames lol.
---
Better start flicking
---
imagine not teleporting when you get the pet. i get anxiety when im standing in ardougne with an uninsured pet let alone in a dangerous area
---
Blitz is not 30 seconds. Unless they changed it.
---
F2P iron man is a blast. You turn all the f2p stats into much more content than they would be otherwise. For example, getting the amulet of power (best in slot for neck) is a ~100 hour grind to 70 crafting. It's extremely satisfying, and kind of considered the first step any f2p iron man must accomplish to be a serious account.
---
Nice

About 6-8 months ago i made a joke in cc to someone i knew. Said "my dad works for jagex, give me your account info or ill ban you" then you kicked me for attempting to scam. half the cc flamed you because i was their splasher, and they knew i was joking.  When you couldnt take it anymore you made it so only ranks could talk in cc and left. i call that a mental breakdown if you ask me.

Not worth imo. Youll be targeted so much more for the ether. Also 76 range is low so you'll be killing slow anyways. Tbh I hate revs. I dont have the patience for the amount of clans that will spend the time to stack 20 people in a DD and log in under you to dbow spec you or ags w.e all for some black dhide. Its just to much aids for me. I did one wildy task there and never went back.

Settled in his latest, purely coincidentally 10 minutes long video:
---
 Swampletics has taken off really well and I bet could just release videos every week with very little progress made just to milk every penny out of it. But I am not going to do that. Release a 10 minute video with no content, just for money. Not my cup of tea.  But I bet I could do 10 minute videos without content yet I stick to what I know best making great videos! Quality over quantity... Have I repeated myself long enough to make this  a 10 min video? 
---
I thought that was hilarious.

So would you say I’d do better with the blowpipe until I had higher stats?

Im fine if it is a toggle, because it changes nothing, but id rather NOT have it than have it because I think it looks ugly, why would I ever want to see what style of weapon I use, u know what style of weapon ure using after ur first day of playing the game, why would I want that at all? Its not convenient, its stupid. You can literally see what type of weapon youre using by just equipping it.

Do you just spend your points when you get them? I got my task unlocks, herb sack and all that and now I'm just rolling in points. 1k is pretty inexpensive down the road.

Woman here. If it wasn't for the general standard of almost all dudes wanting it clean shaven, I wouldn't do it. Hell, you're looking at 9/10 women leaving it natural. Last boyfriend I had was the best, he didn't care what it looked like.

The money from mediums is actually pretty good in the long run. You lose a small amount doing eclectics without rangers, but once you get rangers it more than makes up for it. Even at a chance of 1/300, you can do about 20 meds an hour with focus. That means you make 30m every 15 hours. Numbers are probably closer to 1.2-1.5m profit an hour over time. Either way, it’s worth buying them, because you don’t make near that profit catching them. However, it only makes sense in the long run.
---
I’m laughing so hard at this

I always worry about getting a stone drop from a hellhound task.
---
Imagine if crabs dried out human corpses and attached model parts to them
---
LOL like the moal from ruinscape?
---
Its not that im upset over losing 8k lol - its just the annoyance of dealing with those thirsty pkers every other minute. Literally I couldnt go 3 min without being clanned. I dont have an issue with pkers who are pking either btw, people can play how they want. Its just not enjoyable to me imo and when i played heavy back in 02-07 all i did was PvP, but I just cant see how its fun to spend hours and resources killing pvmers for no loot lol.

Never was comparing the two. I RC a lot on a previous account before it was hacked. Once you do a few runs you know what's the effective route and where to click. I say Skilling isnt hard is because it doesnt require the focus (usually) or skill something like PVM, raids, and PVP do. Anyone can watch the fastest way to 99 and replicate it without much challenge. While something like combat will be more dependent on their skill and reflexes.
---
Restarting and getting these stats again wouldn't be that bad but you have to ask yourself if it's worth it. The time you invest into a new HC is time you could use to make this one better...and how long can you play DC man mode before this happens again.

I think we need a treasure vault for clue rewards. Would safe my iron a lot of space. Just keep the regular treasure chest for ultimates, and vault only for non UIM.
---
Question
---
How is that offensive.
---
Using the example of waking up and getting a 1 KC pet. 
---
If I was to go back in time and repeat this event over and over, waking up and getting 1 KC, each chance has an equal opportunity for getting the pet. Because there is no relationship between these chances, I am just as likely to get the pet drop when I wake up as I am right before I go to bed. If I do 1000 kills in a day without a pet, I have no better odds of getting the pet than when I started. 
---
If I chose not to wake up and go for a pet chance in the morning, instead waiting for bed, I did not miss out on the pet drop, only the same 1/x chance that I’ll get later.

A lot of people think when a crasher gets “their” item it was stolen from them, but in reality the crasher’s roll and the crashed player’s roll are independent of each other. It just means the crashed player was present for good RNG.

Your best bet would be to hit up a friend or clan mate.

If you don't have any of these... Your best bet would be to just pay the $11 for a month of membership (Or buy a bond with RL $$) and as a rule of thumb always keep a 4m+ cash stack in the bank for situations like this :P

yeah, i know how bots work, i run them. point is theres always failsafes. youd never kill them and even if you did they lose nothing, would telly back to fally and ckntinue. you're wasting your time.

Don't worry I did the same thing only took me 560 clues

If you were in a room of people who had exactly 7 boots from medium clues (such as yourself), the average person would have at least 2 of each kind. Only about 5% of people in this room would have zero of a specific type. But you are even unluckier than that, since you have all the same type. About 0.13% of people in that room are in the same boat as you.
---
You are joking, right?

You’re missing the point.

This happened to me once except I had strength pots instead of Sara brews :(

The number of 200m xp but no pet posts I've seen tells me your 26m number is pretty off.
---
First maxed guy I met was going for chin pet. Pet hunting for his goals. He spent 4 months primarily in red chin cave, I guessed 69m for xp he would get it at (most of his hunt xp was Chins as well) and he was at 65m or so. Fast forward 4 months and half a billion gp in chins later he got the pet around 114m xp.
---
Herbiboar took him 6.6k, just over the 6.5k kc.
---
Granted he got Kbd and mole in less than 600 ea.
---
Skiller pets are generally much more uncommon than pvm pets, in my experience.

Its definitely not an issue limited to this community.
---
Gaming communities get so entitled and toxic so fast..its crazy the world of consumerism that we live in. Like I kinda get it, you paid money [obligatory 11$] for something you feel like you have a say in it, but truly you're giving that in good faith to the people for their continued work and effort. If they dont prioritize what you want, or do what you like, simply stop giving them money.
---
In a game like OSRS where you can literally just play to pay membership, this mentality blows my mind.

Also something I missed. For the sake of saving prayer pots, don’t pot up when you go into the tunnels for the last brother. Use the pots when you actually see him. Otherwise you’ll be wasting loads due to the drain.

I mean, if anything it should weigh less as you always lose metal when you’re forging.

That said maybe the weight includes the straps, leatherwork that holds the plate together that magically appears.

If this is true, I hate you OP.
---
I work graveyard shifts, and as long as I get my work done early, my boss doesn't give a shit what I do because I have to wait for the morning crew to take over before I can leave.
---
But why tho
---
No customer service, the fact that Xbox live is cheaper and can afford a hot line to call but Jagex can’t it’s just unacceptable imo at this point.
---
Thank you Mod Ash.
---
Already been over 2 months
---
That's weird, I know it's not hard to spoof your email in outlook to appear as a legitimate Jagex email but all of the links seem to be legit. Regardless, I'd err on the side of caution.
---
If I were you I'd set up a gmail account for your Runescape account(s) and keep it completely private and separate then link all the rs accounts to that one email. Set up 2fa on the gmail account to your phone then change the password(s) on your rs account(s) as well as the gmail account to passwords you've never used before as well as having them all different.
---
If you have multiple accounts you could even take it a step further and make specific gmail's for your accounts.
---
What does jamflex mean?
---
What I always find amusing about these updates, is that when there's any proposal that would make PvP easier to get into, it's met with disapproval because PvP crowd wants PvP to be super skillful and require tons of practice to be good at. And that's fine in my opinion.
---
But then an icon gets moved and suddenly they're inept to relearn something minor, even if it affects everyone equally.
---
I guess you're right.  I think im taking my frustration of posts like [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bct0pd/suicidal_hcim/) out on guys who don't really deserve it.

Honestly, just train your stats up for now and you'll slowly collect money.

Get your attack &amp; defence to 40 for f2p and 60 for p2p. I always like to keep strength abit higher, about 10 lvls above but that's just me.

If you need a decent place to train in f2p, kill guards in al'kharid palace. Theres a kebab seller 30 seconds away that sells kebabs for 1gp each so its very cheap food.

Shut the fuck up

So what train there until level 40 in all stats?
---
&gt;150k 
---
That not possible. Assuming 0 dead herbs and a minimum of 5 herbs per patch (I think the min is 6 but lets be safe) you could sell the herbs for 
---
&gt;(6750 (herb price) \* 5(herbs) \* 6 (patches)) - (771 (ultracompost cost)\* 6 (patches)) = 197874gp
---
The cost of the seed is \~40k per. so, \~240k cost of seed.

That's a max loss of 198k - 240k \~= -42kgp, idk how you got -150k in a single run.

Hey well then in that case I see three main options for you my man. Your first would obviously be to restart and grind that challenge of a hcim for that aspect, the second would be to treat your now iron man still as a semi hc and try to keep deaths to 0 from now on and make it more of a personal challenge over anything. With that way you it would be a more mental game for you and could bring a new type of play style to your grind which could be fun for you depending on the type of person you are. Obviously this would make you off the hcim leader boards, but personally I've found the most enjoyment out of my ironman due to the fact that I can do stupid crap like killing things with items I normally wouldn't use because I'm an iron and it's just fun to be like "oh yeah i just finally got my first d square so I'm going to use that for a bit because it's fun and I can now". Really depends on what you find fun. The third option is to just be an iron and not worry about your deaths and just have fun as an iron. With that you would open some new doors for risk and could challenge yourself with doing risky activities you wouldn't normally do on an hcim like revs, wildy slay etc. You'll still get that risk of death, but my God is it satisfying taking out a pker as an ironman knowing you just made their shit go poof lol.
---
These are your three paths I see you taking and honestly do what your gut tells you. We're all just randos on the internet and I can't tell you what you're going to have the most fun doing. Whatever you do decide though I think you will have the most fun with it if it's your own personal choice and not us telling you you should or should not restart it because we're not you and only you will be able to have that judgment for yourself.
---
Regardless of your decision to make a new account or not you should shoot me an add in game :) my irons name is: the ironclad.

Points
---
My dude, my point is food ain't no substitute for love. My cat don't take food when he want sum pets.
---
That’s only minimum yield though. With ultra, secateurs, farming cape and resurrect crops the average is around 9 per patch. With only secateurs and ultra you’ll still average above 8.
---
Try mathing again with those numbers.
---
Bro, if you lose pid two duels in a row. ( highly probable) that's a disadvantage on each stake and you are cleaned. You won't make any money with that system.

honestly, he just needs to make more talking or little content videos, so we can watch while skilling. At this point, his voice is pure serotonin for me, just give me more non-agressive commentary (ie, more like swampletics, less like his older works) it doesnt matter what it is

I tried to replicate this. About 2% of participants ended up with more than they started with, after 100 stakes. Initial stake is 50% of 100 mil, so 50 mil to begin with.

Try dropping/selling all of your chaps and making another pair?

Well any tooltips in the combat style menu generally need a long press to show up making it slightly inconvenient is all. As I said originally, I like the idea but i feel like theres possibly a better way to do it.

Plus you can only do for around 2 hours without food

Hi,

Alch yourself.

I always imagine a giant wheel with 3k options. Each kill you get one spin and it starts at a random spot every spin.
---
Well theres more People doing bosses but also more People playing the game, so it wont Change that much imo
---
Rsmoments does the same?
---
whats a 2007scapers favourite repost
---
Ill try that.

if you know, you know

The hammer is only 0.907kg though. So even if it consumes the entire thing we're missing some

Thanks!

Not all heroes wear capes but yours should be trimmed.

Just search whatever monster you are fighting in the wiki and it will list its defenses
---
Dieting is tough on the mind I'm here for you brother
---
He plays a game for 80 hours a week.. Oh my the hard work ohhh myyy. In all seriousness I don't care what people do for work I respect it the same, what I don't respect is someone doing EXACTLY what they say they aren't going to do. If he had made a 2-3 minute video going "Hey guys it sucks but to keep the content quality A grade i'm gonna have to start releasing videos over a 1-2 week period, this sucks because I wanna give you content and make some money for my effort, if you'd like I've started a patreon so you can support me, much appreciated.".
---
Instead we go 10 minutes of him dribbling shit while doing EXACTLY what he said he didn't want to do which takes all credibility away from his words. He came across as greedy rather than someone who actually wants to produce quality content. I was a fan of his but his fan base and attitude recently have put me off him.
---
Respeccthe specc
---
I stopped watching when it became clear he was reaching for content to drag out his series.
---
every gold item in the game looks awful honestly and i would not want to see a bis item like slayer helm with an option for gold coloring
---
Are you paying with cash or are you using the membership trial/gp for bonds?
---
Playing Runescape for over 10 hours just once is fucking mind draining. Doing it every single day is definitely respectable.
---
Try killing them in the wilderness :)
---
Is this loss?
---
Wooow I totally forgot about AQ. Killed so much time on that game.
---
Okay but tbh I hate how you can just buy your way through quests rather than just doing them. Idk. Seems really unrewarding to me.
---
Do alted raids with people you trust (ideally in a clan) Ive gotten splits from 5 drops in the span of 4 hours doing 5+2s. And seen B2B2B loots before.
---
Hello sir, you should be careful. Showing the day your account was made can be used to steal it; this is why you often times are players who post the age of their account marking out the number of days you made the account ago.
---
I don't PvP but am considering it for in the (distant) future. Are there things you can do to prevent things like this from happening or is this solely a Jagex thing?
---
Fake
---
Why would someone do that? Just for the odd chance of somebody upvoting it?
---
How did you get defense XP when it was reset to attack style. . .

trying to get decent prayer skill and rune items from Lava Dragons.

Definitely not true the world ddosers obviously hit the world when either in 1 way combat to assure kill or welfare with no risk

if it's her first account she would be better served by making a regular account. She can then make an Ironman once she has some familiarity with the game.

contact jagex directly? This sounds weird.
---
Why are so many people assuming the inner dynamics of OP’s relationship? We have no idea what prompted this yet everybody is assuming he is completely neglecting his spouse.
---
There are plenty of heathier ways to deal with conflict other than destroying somebodies property. It is really inexcusable. I don’t really care what you say to justify it. If somebody you care about is addicted to something(like alcohol or drugs), simply throwing it away doesn’t solve the addiction. It doesn’t fix the underlying problems and that is my entire point.
---
There are better ways to solve shit, and the fact that the OSRS subreddit is bending over backwards to defend this fucking behavior is absurd. Everybody is making assumptions on OP’s relationship based off of one message that he’s a poor husband or that he’s addicted to the game when we really don’t know for sure what prompted this message. 
---
If your solution to an issue with your partner/wife/girlfriend/significant other is to destroy their shit you have an issue with them over using, then you probably shouldn’t be in a relationship.
---
550 for me
---
Lmao I came here to say that

Congrats on that 99 dough

Idk, just click it.
---
Male feminist virgin detected
---
My first comment was refuting the specific following claim, which is not true.
---
&gt; If there is an actual number its usually because someone asked a jmod and they went and looked at the game code 
---
This is simply not accurate, since the majority of numerical drop rates we have on the wiki are from this drop log project. You've decided to interpret that as me saying none of our drop rates from from JMod references, which is obviously ridiculous and not something anyone would ever claim.
---
The way we approximate drop rates is a little bit complicated (certainly more complicated than just dividing drops by kills putting in a percentage), but we've been very open about how it's done, both here on Reddit and on the wiki. Why would we ever want to keep that a secret?
---
Dragon defender is 1/100
---
Yes it's been over for weeks
---
Not jagex. Ddos. Every other non pvp world is fine.
---
This is a risky thread to comment in I already know it
---
Yeah, but it will mean that you cant "minimize" the tabs, they will always be open
---
This is poetry
---
It's not more convenient. It literally doesn't do anything. How can it possibly change any way you play the game?
---
It’s for the greater good
---
It's absurd to camp high risk high reward places in the wild to boost your early game, then complain when the risky portion kills you.
---
Yeah that’s what I want to do
---
its beginner, pretty common to get loot like this actually
---
shops have interfaces, its just literally a dude you talk to to get a cape.
---
I disconnected on wave 36 in the fight caves. First attempt too. 🙄
---
Yes you do. That's why I shave the fucking thing every week, you lying fucker.
---
Keep the grind going brother!
---
You really don't know how strong muscle memory can be. I'm not a pvper but at least i can empathize.
---
I've set my restores right next to my brews and my antipoisons on the opposite side of the tab for this exact reason lmao rip
---
Barbarian assault. Torso will be mine tonight.
---
My friend and i sit in the corner whilst he chins the melee and i smack keee with an ACB. With an invent of 15 brews and 5 restores plus all the food drops and b2p, we get around 20 kills a trip.
---
Wait you can change the spawn point?
---
Depending on the gear you got, you use 1 anti-venom+ dose for 1 or 2 Zulrah kills
---
True
---
Then they have a really weird superiority complex over their gaming addiction
---
Thank you man, I appreciate it!
---
hah gottem
---
Ideally you bring range and mage swithes for point farming anyways. A lot of the best point bosses are incredibly weak to mage, and some are much weaker to range than the other 2.
---
I started 1.5 weeks ago, up to 59 range, 55 magic and animal magnetism/prayer book completed on my pure. Its fun af ma man 👌🏼
---
This is why hiding poll results was a good idea: so we can actually discuss our choices on the forums and have the devs use them as information. Good stuff
---
When is the next bot busting stream? 
---
Suggestion: check wyverns.. its not hard to spot them.
---
Thoughts on clients implementing features that failed polls? This was answered on stream ages back as "watch this space" but we were never given an answer.
---
I only got beaver (200k off 99) and had (3 kc lol)
---
I got really lucky since Vorkath used his ranged attack almost the whole fight
---
but then I never hit ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Don’t forget you can do a little questing too and go to fossil island and kill the crabs there for pretty good do as well, there’s hardly every anyone there
---
What are your thoughts on putting essence mines inside Essence Altars?
---
Currently mining isn't a very relevant part of the RuneCrafting skill, even though it originally started as such. Even for ironmen, it is better to rely on monster drops for essence rather than mine it.
---
That's your way to look at it.
---
The way I see it is the only reason they're placed where they are is to offer PKers a buffet of easy targets so they don't whinge about only fighting maxed out characters, because let's face it pures don't want to fight other pures and max levels don't want to fight other max levels, they want easy targets they can kill in a few shots and then hop on to the next world.
---
The rewards could be equally high with fire geysers shooting up everywhere trying to kill you, lava walls spawning you have to dodge or a multitude of other things adding a high risk to going for them.
---
But the fact that it's in the wilderness is only for the PKers enjoyment of, as you say "free 10k".
---
Me my duo partner and our 3rd we first 200 raids i was 120 dry other was 200 and 3rd pulled 10 items 5 arcanes 4 harpoons 1 ancestral bottom or something like that until i pulled an arcane &amp; thrownaxes wassn't a fun start at all. Last 150 raids though so 200-350 i've made a good chunk of moneyes in decent drops. it changes
---
Most PKers pussy the fuck out the moment they see another Pure or someone who will give them a run for their money.
---
They don't drop clues
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hill_Giant

No to ornament kit. Maybe unlock for 10k slayer points and color slayer helmet with 10m coins
---

That made me laugh HAHA
---
Get base 60s as your next goal if you want to start getting treated with respect. Also, do RFD.
---
I'd assume it was more "put in the effort" yourself before asking to be taught. Otherwise you just find people wanting the hard carry.
---
You could just use your own inference to deduce the weapon type or just look up on wiki. This seems like a waste of dev time to me.
---
I actually had this happen too on my first btw! https://i.imgur.com/qI8HEGg.png

Teleporting, anywhere
---
Could you give a subtle hint about any quests following on from SotE?
---
It’s pretty populated, I doubt they close it any time soon
---
*sigh* bunch of pest control
---
It's quite hard to put in the effort if you can't find anyone to raid with because you're 0 kc.
---
Someone has to take one for the team.
---
To be fair though, you’re never going to get the same selling rates as the buying rates.
---
I assume im one of the few players who still plays with game sounds on, so my question is this, can fletching become a client only sound like high alchemy? Its almost always one of the most prominent sounds at any popular bank making it one if the loudest if their’s multiple players doing it.  Theres a host of other sounds that should become client only.  like why is plank make client only but humidify isn’t?
---
So... 43k each?
---
&gt;don't get muted 
---
How? Nanny state game can't say shit anymore
---
60-65k trios with 20k points per raid usually
---
In addition could we get some clarification on which mobs are intended to drop easy's which ones are intended to drop beginners, and which are intended to drop both?
---
Can you add easy clues to low level slayer monsters, such as Crawling Hands, Cave Crawlers and Rockslugs?
---
I always wonder who bothered to farm this sort of stuff when I buy it. Without noobs the economy would collapse I think.
---
Currently RS is on an upswing of player count thanks to the recent ad campaign! Jagex is still investing money into the game and it’s still paying off for them!
---
What's next for the Old School Team in relation to lore building and story telling. Following on from Song of the Elves which is being slated to release in the summer, has the team been in discussion about any questlines they want to continue on from? If we look at the world map, the desert has been left untouched for years.
---
That's not how it works at all... The price of RWT gold is controlled by the equivalent price of gold from bonds, RWT gold always must be significantly cheaper. Because otherwise, why would anyone risk their account buying gold when bonds are cheaper?
---
Yeah, record scratch sound. Iri-, iri- irit
---
Wait there's a slayer task that is get 35 fire capes? 
---
I assumed Jad tasks were to kill Jad once.
---
Is there a way to message them?  Any time I look up any place to contact player support it just pops up that player support center
---
Right now the slayer cape has one of the worst skill cape perks in the game for the amount of time it takes to achieve. The 10% chance of getting a back-to-back task is horrible. Can you make it similar to the Magic skill cape where you can skip X amount of times / day with the cape perk? 5 would be too many, but 3 would be more than fair.
---
Looks perfectly baked ma dude.
---
Idk why everyone is talking about longswords. Swords (shortswords) are the same speed as scimitars and are typically -1/-2 less stab and strength vs. a scimitar’s slash and strength. In other words, the difference is negligible. HOWEVER, many enemies have less stab defense than slash, making a sword a more effective weapon. I have a 60 Attack Zerker account but my main weapon is a Dragon sword instead of a Dragon scimitar and the reason is simple: in typical Zerker PKing gear, I have something like ~10 less stab defense than slash defense. In other words, on similarly-equipped Zerkers, I should hit more often on them with the sword than they will with their scimitar, setting me up for higher KO potential. At least that’s how it should work. Is the possible max hit lost worth the accuracy gained? I would say so.

Get fishing and magic up. Food is essential for combat training, and magic gives teleports. Kill hill giants with magic and harvest runes. Minds and airs are cheap at rune stores. Get money from killing hill giants. They almost pay for themselves.

Can you pls give us the exact ToB drop rates, ist been a year and theres still no detailed info
---
I think your right client is on resizable and your left client is on fixed. See those 2 monitor icons on your right screen? Click the left one. I think that does what you want.
---
Oosh nice kiss kiss
---
Nice.
---
&gt; Can you give some more insight on the issue with underwater swimming being much higher than they were polled at? How did this happen? is there a manipulation method that yields these rates or its just casually giving much higher rates than the proposed ones? Maybe if they understand the root of the discrepancy they can address it in the Q&amp;A.
---
It was simply that they buffed the method. But a buff shouldnt go from 30k/110k to a 47k/170k thats outrageous, a 15% buff had maybe been reasonable which would put it at 34.5k/126.5k. 
---
&gt; Do you think making ZMI area a trade restricted zone would solve the running "issue"? I'm having trouble thinking about a solution that applies to every altar and does not have silly restrictions like essences being untradeable or things like that. Do you have any solutions on mind?
---
So, first, let me start by saying that my issue with ZMI running isnt necessarily that "running is a thing" although I believe dependency on other characters in the game for maximum XP rates is stupid (its enough that alts treat money in the game as 0 time) but the problem specifically with ZMI altar is that IT IS OUT OF PROPORTION much better experience, it beat the former best method by 140%. Thats widely problematic.
---
I think there are many possible solutions to fixing it.
---
One could be that you cant trade if you have used the altar within xx amount of time.
---
Another could be a cooldown period if you have used the altar like 3 times within the last xx.
---
After all its not so far fetched or an artificial change, because ZMI altar unlike all other altars give random runes of random variants, it stands out to the rest, so it would make sense if "the energy" that the altar emits would be different.
---
Sounds like you should be an ironman, good sir!
---
Nice!
---
Will essence running ever be nerfed? It turns runecrafting into a "buyable" skill which it shouldn't be
---
Red:Nice.

Being a part of this community means understanding that one likes or cares about you @ face value. We only care about how you think. It’s relieving to some, scary to others. If you get downvoted it means you’ve got a shit question that you can probably just wiki check.

Either that or someone’s trolling which also common here.

Yeah integrity questions usually get ignored, sadly.

HAHA good meme post FOR SURE
---
That’s why you have feet*
---
Isn’t Attas the yield anima, not Iasor.  Pretty sure that’s just for disease.
---
Can we please poll giving both the Justiciar body +10 and the Justiciar legs +5 magic accuracy?
---
On a previous Q&amp;A Mod Ash said that he would be in favor of giving Justiciar a small mage buff given that its magic accuracy is so bad you can't even cast crumble undead at Vorkath while wearing it.
---
This still leaves their magic accuracy as the worst in the game, but you can at least cast spells (that will never hit anything but allow you to put out fire at Olm and cast cumble undead at Vorkath).
---
Well sir you are more experienced than me so happily tell me to do one :L
---
Dude just use mobile, why quit your job over the inability to play RS on your own laptop? I dont think the ability to  play RS would be a factor in whether or not to keep a job bit to each their own I guess.

He has one, he just doesn't want his account to be mysteriously drained tomorrow when he wakes up
---
I would be very interested in seeing your code. I just wrote a python script to test this and ended up with a 4% winrate across 100,000 trials of 100 stakes (3854 wins and 96146 losses.) This was testing with 25m starting cash. 
---
You may have forgotten to account for the fact that once you reach a low enough amount of money it would be a fail condition. I set it so that once the cash stack was below 250,000 it would count it as a loss as no one stakes that little.
---
So bonds are not rip off, they are good option for those who care about things
---
Can mage training arena please get some updates? This also goes for a lot of older mini games like Castle Wars, Barbarian Assault, Trouble Brewing, just to name a few.  Currently the grind involved in getting bones to peaches is very painful and also pretty uncommonly completed unless going for diaries. 
---
Basically can we get some focus on old content please?
---
What
---
I am 99% sure there's a bug with Attas + Bottomless Compost giving less yield which is why I am using Iasor.

Huh what was that noise!?

uhm they are going to poll a new slayer master in elf city so we getting a new big slayer change in summer already if it pass but it is highly likely it will

There are 23 skills. 8 skills have a pet (hunter has 2). Very simple average exp of common methods for skilling pets is ~187m exp. 8 x 13m = 104m. Just getting 13m exp doesn't get you that much of a chance for pet.
---
Try cannoning them. I've been doing that for range exp, got 45keys so far

It believe it’s just an anomaly, it doesn’t look like the amount traded has gone up. Some poor soul probably added an extra zero or something and it bought.

Ring is novelty. People buy then sell it. Also u cant wear it while moving or show it off while moving. It also deleted ur entire outfit.

I wrote a script to test this but used 10% as the initial value. 4% win rate across 100,000 trials with 25m starting cash.
---
I actually kinda like this idea, with the right balancing and whatnot it could give some nice variation to the skill
---
That would be pretty cool, can already see me spending all my money on runes lol
---
My girlfriend made an account a year or so ago. My recommendation is feel free to provide advice and help but let her try to figure things out on her own first. 
---
As to the other answer you received, just let her make an ironman. My girlfriend constantly plays her account in an ironman like way anyway.  Gathering her own supplies and things for skilling even though it would be better to just money make for it.
---
The one on the left is on resizeable too and it doesn’t have any issues.
---
From a financial point of view, they are still a rip off, rip offs are to do with money at the end of the day.

Instead of trying to follow in others footsteps, why don’t you come up with your own unique content.  There’s so many people doing these series what’s going to set you apart?

I personaly hate siege decks since its similar to hog cycle. Easy to pick up hard to master but terrible to play against. Sure earthquake is hard counter to buildings but against no building deck you play mostlikly with 7 cards against 8. Still dont think siege should get such a hsrdcounter for only 3elixier

Meet Actual2007letics, my official-client-only locked mainman.

Technically different companies. Two brothers own them. One brother owns TJ's and one owns ALDI, but they litterally have no connection to one another and are staunch competitors. My sister is a store manager at TJ's and my ex worked as a manager at ALDI.

I just stuck with copper and tin until I could mine silver, and I did that until rune pickaxe. Also, getting 29 combat for deaggro of al kharid scorpions to mine there is nice.

Is there any chance you guys could release current pet dry streaks again? I'm curious to see where everyone stands and the last one was released almost a year ago.

I stand corrected!

Yeah that's the sort of thing I was thinking, or possibly having to store empty vials in the room to use. Just so we're not devaluing vials.

I can't imagine this sentiment being shared by anyone outside this sub

Nah just don't forget

I was there for a few hours and I think I went through like 3 monkfish so it wasn’t too bad

This is not the dev q and a thread. This is the thread for questions for the community to answer.

You are talking about a BIS gear display for that monster?
---
I think that this would be possible to do since this data is already on the wiki and it can be "reused" from there I believe. I will defo consider this as an option :)

I must admit even though I haven’t played RS3 in years I still sometimes say rocktail and completely forget they are anglerfish.

Could hot cold steps for beginner clues work like talismans giving directions instead of hot/cold? Without knowing the solutions beforehand, they are very difficilt and time-consuming for what is supposed to be a very easy and quick clue step, and I think they will be a huge turn off for new players who get them.
---
Back in the days before the G.E. I was definitely something of an Ironman.
---
People probably sell them when going for a champions scroll
---
Not true for pures who are majority of people training there

What do you mean with an alt?

33 mins for \~1m pts hot damn. Good on you. I'm looking to do the same so I can imbue a slay helm recolour. I burnt all my pts.
---
Thanks! I wish I could call them right now..
---
Thammaron's scepter is still dead content.
---
It's worse than a trident for DPS, and also much more risk since it has no built in spell. That means you risk 1k ether AND all the runes you have to bring with you for LESS dps.
---
Craw's Bow and Viggora's chainmace just lose the 1k ether when you die.
---
In top of this, it's really only BIS at the archeologist - maybe scorpia, but that's in deep wild multi so it's not a good idea to bring a stack of runes there.
---
Can *some* positive change be made to this staff to make it somehow balanced?
---
Why pick flax when you can farm Zulrah for it?
---
And the timers, markers etc.

Ffs people stole my name! Posers!

If the other 100 downvotes werent telling enough. But your 5c is appreciated either way.
---
Because Zlurah wasn't around when I was 9 :D
---
Rigours is top priority. You don't really need to worry about leveling range, although it would help. Just level range by doing vorkath, it's around 60-90k xp/h.

Tedious Slay also has a guide on how to get slayer xp without combat xp on his Youtube channel. He decreases his crush bonus as much as possible to be more likely to roll a 0. He's also made it so that the account only has 3 possible tasks to alternate.
---
It's not that I'm frothing at the mouth waiting for an update, but completely disregarding it because "graceful exists" is a dumb way to look at it.  
---
That's like saying "I shouldn't wear a condom because plan B exists".

Congrats! Huge achievement

No. It's a loss to open them if you get UNLUCKY. Average luck nets you around 1m/hr+
---
An Agility course was mentioned for Prifddinas, but hasn't been mentioned recently. Are there any updates on this?
---
Mid-high level Agility desperately needs some variety.
---
Can we repoll coinshare? Nothing involving storing up loot points or anything like that. Just if you get a drop, it’s put into the GE at the current price someone has in for an offer and that’s split between the people in the cc. No insta sell at mid price or anything that can negatively affect the economy
---
Are there any updates on a Meiyerditch/Castle Drakan Agility course than you had mentioned in the past?
---
I don't think you are understanding what we are meaning - if it worked like this, there would be a huge influx of rare seeds coming into the game constantly. This would cause a huge decrease in seed prices, which would not be desirable
---
Name me one person who can balance a scimitar like that on their wrist.
---
Imagine ironing everyone instead
---
Um... why not just run the *same exact distance* to draynor and bank there?
---
Or, for even better expanding brain strats, run to draynor to pickpocket the master farmer there, to then sell the seeds you get to Olivia and use those coins to go back and buy the rake.
---
There is a lot of F2P content that will give you a feel for the game so you can decide if a membership is worth it.
---
You can make enough money even as a F2P to get a membership through bonds and keep it going. Of course that is going to cut into your profits substantially for a while, but it's more than possible.
---
You taking a Know-I'm-census?
---
As a UIM I would love this, and hate it at the same time it would make it so easy. The noted potions already made it easier to train Herbalore. I love the idea but it shouldn't be allowed for uims like the seed vault.
---
My eyes... :/
---
Could you allow beginner clues to be obtained from pickpocketing low leveled NPCs, the same way you can pickpocket easy clues from HAM members?
---
feet
---
Dragon hunter crossbow is your best bet. Sell/grind out 30m. Will give you the most consistent kills/hr over anything else and you’ll make the money back for other things way faster.

got a good lol from that, thanks chum
---
That's a shame then, I mean all I really care for is the wizard outfit and the halos but for other players it just seems absurd, but I guess at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal
---
I believe it's 50%, not 100%.
---
Using the algorithm provided by Kieren, I couldn't find an easy way to calculate the expected increase in runes from 66% to 88% but from anecdotal trials I haven't found a large increase profit per chest. I'm going to collect some more data using both methods but the added time and switches really seems not to be worth the added value, also considering chance of Barrows items and elite clues don't change.
---
Oh, so not really easier to get until a bit later on for ironmen?
---
oops meant to say 43 mins my bad. but yeah this method is still ridiculous point rates
---
Have you heard of the [oirania altar](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ourania_Altar).

Deep is a little optimistic, don't you think?

Thanks Dude!

Very helpful. Thank you. Is it worth getting DHCB without having dragonfire ward? Or should you be getting both at once?

They can be stored in your menagerie in your POH as an option as well
---
Are people so dumb nowadays that they consider any information "memes"
---
Senpai.. y..your hammer is too big!
---
Damn fire cape with those stats. How'd you get it?? Cool acc.
---
imagine you're trying to bake a cake
---
you have flour (code), eggs (artists), sugar (game balancing), and  other ingredients like that.
---
now, to put it all together, you need to understand the engine (oven). Wait, did I say oven? i meant engine. You have to bake the cake in a literal 6-cylinder sports car engine because that's the way your restaurant has always done it. You want to bake it in an oven? fuck you, the customers are here for engine cake and that's what you're going to cook. What's that, an engine isn't supposed to be cookware? You can't figure out how to cook a new recipe on a *block of roaring, grinding, gasoline-fucking-soaked steel*? Look, I'm sorry, but the engine has been with us from the beginning. It's what makes this restaurant what it is, we can't just \*replace* it. Why don't you figure out how to bake a cake inside it instead of whining about wanting an oven?
---
&gt; Twisted Bow instead of Zaryte Bow
---
I wouldn't really compare those two. Twisted is a Hexhunter, not a Zaryte. That said, it would make more sense for an upgraded Crystal Bow from Prif to fill the Zartye's role.

Gf kid ty for the loot, selling right now

---
The point still stands, though. It may not be a concern for you, and frankly it isn't that big of a concern for me either. I just noticed it and was like "wow, these are total bullshit..." and decided to make a post. But your line of thinking encourages laziness, and that's part of the overarching problem here.
---
But where did they come from?
---
Not sure your solution would really help. You'd just end up accumulating spare potions in your bank and having to go dump them in your house every couple days. That would take more effort then using the decanter at the GE.
---
Well at lava drags if it’s a 1v1 they’re going to fight to the death because there is no escaping. But if the other pure has a clan of course they’re going to run.
---
Thanks I think I'll go for mory legs into dueling ring. Also have proselyte already so I'll go with that. Would an ancient staff with freeze spells be better than iban blast?
---
Quit while you still have a life
---
I like the fact that you guys are revisiting old content such as LMS.
---
and that you polled something to make it start with less than 24.
---
could you also look into making another map or just a complete revamp? I believe it would get a lot of attention
---
Gingerbeardie is that you?
---
Shit I accidentally do sex on woman
---
I would agree, but this change isn’t really metabreaking or OP in the slightest. That’s most people’s fear of integrating it into POH’s. People bossing will still bring SCB’s or range pots, and those in hard to reach PVM areas/those who want to afk will bring a super set. 
---
Managing potions in this way (including have to refill barrels) seems like a neat way to consolidate and clear clutter to me.
---
Well, back when it was implemented in RS2, the tele literally took 30 seconds to implement, as it was just supposed to be a bailout measure.

That's ~60-70K profit?

Wish this had been a real thing in arcades in 2006. 11 year old me would have totally shelled out a few quarters to play on anything faster than my 28.8 mbps/s dial-up connection
---
Why would you EVER sit at max hp rofl? It causes your absorbs to disappear faster.
---
Sitting at 1 hp allows your absorbs to last for hours
---
&gt;Why is it such a struggle? Because this engine was made many many years ago, probably made incredibly poorly (inefficient). It was probably made with a lot of restrictions based on hardware -- honestly, it was probably made for computers with less processing power than our smartphones from like 5 years ago.
---
Yep. This engine was built to be extremely efficient on older machines and run on dial up. A lot of the players data is actually saved as raw binary even. Restoring something built so many years ago and trying to work with it is chaos.
---
Is the grotesque guardian drop table ever going to be changed? Around 3 minutes per kill when you’re maxed for an average drop of 40-50k doesn’t seem very rewarding.
---
How can you play a 20 year old browser game and act surprised when it doesn't work exactly like any modern game?
---
Especially since OSRS is still the 2nd game at Jagex in terms of support/staffing. Sure, they both make lots of money, but RS3 has the majority of manpower.
---
Should send all the guys who talk like it's easy to just modify a game engine on the fly to work with a decade plus of code by hundreds of people over to intern for a week.
---
Some of you guys just have awful luck loll. I went from Bronze to Dragon in like 4
---
I find your lack of weeb disturbing
---
Well, its 50/50 so I dunno, pretty unlucky
---
But anyone with two eyes can clearly see the difference between a short sword and a war hammer? Or a scimitar and a 2h sword? It is 100% unnecessary. There is no "prediction" needed because it spells out what attack style the weapon uses when you hover over the options. No one has ever had that problem
---
Hi
---
I’d just like to say in any normal subreddit your maths is spot on, and I’d congratulate you for explaining probability so well.
---
However, in this subreddit, you are wrong. 
---
The reasoning is this; it either happens, or it doesn’t. Therefore all odds are 50/50, and none of your fancy numerical witchcraft can change that.
---
This seems just like kind of an assumption based on how you would use it. If it was implemented well, people with PoH's over 80ish construction could benefit a lot from this for slayer runs and bossing
---
But I also think theres a better way to keep it as a part of your bank and not add clunky things that need extra loading in PoH
---
I'm sorry, I can't play with you, my combat level is too low. I an very interested in seeing where this goes though.
---
Lol, from experience I know that title may not even be a joke. Fuck having an existential crisis.
---
I think they're hesitant to buff drops on existing or new content, which I sort of agree.  I'd rather see granite dust have multiple uses, all untradable.
---
It’s a pretty bold assumption that anyone pays attention to or learns anything from the tutorial. 
---
I feel like they should either leave it the way it is or make a simple and PLAYABLE tutorial that at least teaches you the super basics like how to call. 
---
Because let’s be honest the people who chose to skip the tutorial would have just space barred / afked through otherwise.
---
My statement was in reference to this post, if op was an iron you can see he already has a blowpipe which would mean he already had zulrah on farm, sorry if I mislead you.
---
and 1 piece of candy takes up just as much space a 2.1 billion pieces of candy.
---
He meant going from -40 for the body to -30. Not from -40 to +10.
---
Whats there to explain? Some guy asked how Jay got it, devil gave the wrong answer.
---
I know, I'm just saying it needs a rework badly
---
\- location makes zero sense 
---
\- no actual lore behind it

\- you get punished for completing quests

\- completely unintuitive mechanics with the dreams and potions

I'm thankful for not having experienced this but I fat finger every single time I try to tele out of my house on mobile. I've had to home tele back from miscellania more times than I can count

I hunted imps in max ranged gear with a ballista together with a friend. Good times.

i mean you can be a zerker build but just have an extra 1-2 combats.

Real question, how does this make things more convenient? Do people really have a hard time figuring out that a long sword is not the same as a battle axe?
---
Justiciar body and legs should just have the same mage bonus as a normal plate + legs. -30 to body and -21 to legs. That would mean +10 to both top and legs.
---
Makes me want to get more involved in the clan I'm in. At the moment, nobody would really notice if I didn't login again :(
---
RIP fellow scaper.

I've dced a couple times on non pvp worlds in the past week.
---
&gt;"Just those heckin newfags -,-" 
---
Everything about that sentence and the way you presented it gave me cancer.
---
your only options is going for a 70-75 def build with rigour and piety, in that case i'd definetely stay 60 attack. There's no relevant build between 45-70 defence
---
If it gives you a +1 on hit use them. You weren't going to use holy boots over climbers or pray robes over dhide chaps were you?  They're prolly pretty pricy atm.
---
Happened to me even though I did everything securely and regularly laugh at dummies who click phishing links.

You and RuneScape moments posted this within 10 minutes of each other, but that kind of OC is none of my business

---
Moss giants in the varrock sewers, made my first mil there
---
Instead.... suggestion for you - find friends.
---
There's a QoL aspect to it. I'm not an ultimate but I'd enjoy not having to bother with doses. When you get your account to the point where you're running most of your content through your POH anyway this could be quite nice.
---
15 year old me would have too. Man that's scary, I've been playing for 13 years. Haha. I'm going to add a coin door on the side. I want to have custom tokens minted at some point, but for now the generic Amazon copper "no cash value" tokens work fine.
---
Barraging/bursting dust devils is so extremely quick so you shouldn't have to check the amount of NPCs to go.
---
You can't have pets for skills that can be bought according to the mods
---
Not a bad idea, but I would just rather see them work a way into adding it to the bank interface.
---
It would be interesting if they could add it to the menu of advanced banking options. Having a way to toggle how potions are stored and removed from bank. If potions were treated as single doses like in the NMZ barrels, you could just toggle on the dose option and take out 12 doses for 3 pots.
---
I am sure people have suggested something similar, so hopefully they figure out a new less clunky system soon
---
I'm gonna get the words "Your commitment to mathimatical accuracy fills me with determination" tattoo'd right above my asshole
---
Can you make Maces &amp; Warhammers the same speed as scimitars/longswords respectively?
---
Forever shall the login music loop. RIP friend.
---
You get downvoted because you are simply wrong. This cant be reliably used for combat 3 slayer training.
---
Those stats are extremely intimidating. I’m scared that you’ll just kill me if I joined you.
---
Never sharing your password doesn’t matter, if you use the same password across multiple platforms/websites. One of them has a database leak and now you’re shared password is out and about. 
---
Not saying you did that, but that’s the most common answer in this scenario.
---
The 0 combat xp method is entirely useless for slayer. You could get better rates cleaning finds at varrock museum. No level 3 has ever used the 0 combat xp method as a means to get slayer xp.
---
For DH 1HP method I like to use:
---
General Khazard
---
King Roald
---
Count Draynor
---
Tree Spirit
---
Those are pretty easy to get, all 1 tile bosses
---
At that point I just turn off 3DCG.
---
If you're just getting into pvp make a low-lvl baby pure. It's a good way to get better at pking while only risking 100k max (depending on build). Don't have to worry about dcing either cause of the low risk

Oh baby

---
I've been giving a lot of thought to this point and I was thinking. To go poh-&gt;bank, grab pots, tele out takes a handful of seconds. Especially with rapid clicks on bank items or withdraw-x. However, a potion room requires click on each barrel, entering the dose and then running to the next. Although this would save teleports and therefore inventorry spaces, which makes it incredibly powerful, it wouldn't increase xp/hour by very much.
---
I do agree that its something powerful locked behind the gp-paywall of construction, which is a problematic aspect of the skill itsself but I feel appropriate ballances can be made without completely devaluing the room.
---
That’s not how rare it is but ok
---
Oh fuck i don't play so i didn't know that. What about other pots or food?
---
Reddit also isn’t consistent, as certain people only respond to certain comments, people bandwagon, misunderstanding things over text, etc.
---
Everything you said is correct. However, I was only referring to the method that Kempq posted about which is the method mentioned by the OP. That method is completely irrelevant to slayer, but is an entirely different mechanic than the one used by Tedious. Tedious' method is legit.
---
maybe but you're not buying a civic to keep it in your garage as a collectors item are you?
---
That means having friends
---
I don't pk*
---
No food, pots, or consumables show up for other players in the wilderness.
---
damn.... RuneScape Injury :/

Except here your hp lvl is exactly how many hit points you have. It makes sense to leave it

Awesome quest idea, giant crab in the middle of the sea! Like a city on top of a giant crab, make it the fishing guild 2.0

You can bank from deep wild and get back out there in like 30-60 seconds, not sure why a mule would be necessary

This is easily one of the worst gaming subreddits on reddit. I absolutely love Runescape, but this sub is pretty unique. Where else is it common to post porn on the front page of the official community subreddit? Only 2% of Runescape players are below the age 18 (market data, not player given ages), and the average account age is 8 years old. So it's not an age thing. It's just the culture around here.

Owow that's kind of dumb.

&gt; they should make gmaul 75% spec so it can't be used twice, and then add a special item to the Gargoyle Boss (rare item 1/512 or something) as an add-on to e regular 30k gmaul to make it 50% spec again. That way the gmaul would probably cost like 5m+, making you have to risk it in order to do ags/dclaws to gmaul combo.
---
Hookers, cocaine, motel. Thats where your money should go
---
no, no it isnt. imagine trying to fight a clan in singles if they have 10000 people dropping them food.
---
i think people get around it by dropping raw fish  and building fires but still, that's way less effective.
---
I used to be like you, saying similar things. My HC (5m bank) was hacked and my main (300m bank) wasn't. Didn't lose anything due to my back pin. My email wasn't compromised, account had a unique password as well.  
---
Don't know how or why but it happens.
---
Smithing pet can be a hammer with small wings. An anvil that either hops or slides across the ground.
---
Really ? I was thinking 1-2mil. As a zerker pure do you think it’s worth getting it over rune boots ?
---
Sorry but why even bother with eternal boots?
---
He gave a potential answer to the question of “how did you get 68 slayer,” not a definite answer. For a potential answer, it is correct, you could get 68 slayer that way. If he did give a definite answer, which he didn’t, then he could be wrong.
---
You can also find these practical and reliable cars for 1000 or less. I bought my work beater civic for 900 running driving perfect engine compression, so there is quite a bit of room for depreciation. If you believe high volume econoboxes will ever appreciate then all your car knowledge comes from video games.
---
You have to take the minuscule risk of entering the wilderness to be rewarded with completing clue scrolls more frequently. You can be a coward and drop clues that make you go in the wilderness and complete them significantly less often. Hard clue scrolls were made with going into pvp areas on purpose, they weren't a 2009 hold over from when the wilderness was a safe zone. Get over it.
---
Yeah it would be nice to separate the players into 2 worlds or something to cut down the lag I support this :)
---
&gt; King Roald
---
Would you happen to know what quest specifically unlocks King Roald? Google is showing 4 quests that person is in.
---
Shield of Arrav, Priest in Peril, What Lies Below, Dragon Slayer II
---
I mean, you may not be wrong, but you do have a shitty attitude. "You couldn't be more wrong" is really patronizing; you could've gone about the topic in a more mature way.
---
And right now you're acting extremely self-righteous, which is what puts people off. On this thread, you could've pulled a "I wasn't aware of this particular method but I still believe it to be less efficient" or something along those lines, instead of "I'm not wrong, I'm not wrong." Like shit, ofc people will downvote, it's so whiny. Does your honor and life collapse if you're wrong or something?
---
Although I'll be fair, it is a little obscure in knowledge and practice, and OP should not have made a post about it, kind of dumb.
---
Well! We’re [waiting](https://imgur.com/gallery/8ARsWpJ)

But maybe he did and our account security really sucks. Lol idk I havent been hacked in like 10 years.
---
It’s all a matter of preference. If the other guy can do enough dps and you don’t mind putting out no damage, then go for it.  I would suggest using tank gear but continue with a tentacle, so long as you have guthans and an easy way to heal.
---
Between 2007 and 2013, RS3 basically rewrote many things, like how pathing and and combat work. Trying to translate RS3 into OSRS, not even considering EoC, is not going to happen
---
It's a damn shame, too. We'd get less colossal fuck-ups if they paid their employees market salary and used that higher salary to hire more experienced developers/QA.
---
Out of curiosity, what is the ballpark figure for Jagex's developer salary?
---
Oh thank god, and here I thought I'd hone 4x dry on the chin pet before I got it. Turns out i had the slightest touch of moisture on my tongue still at a sweet 97%. Thank you! Now I only want to bash my head in a little instead of a lot!
---
Thank you:)
---
Rune Scape Illness. Not as bad as it sounds, it means you have to keep playing Runescape every ten hours or you might die... Actually that sounds pretty bad, better get back on Runescape!
---
Some sort clan drama happened and they closed the clan. Just hop worlds until you find a good one.
---
I compromised and did steam runes. I clocked it at around 10-15k less xp/hr but you make alright profit.
---
I've just got members today and spent the last 3 hours grinding my crafting level for a bit of cash and to start the fairy rings quest
---
 Kills/hr is more of a problem than exp/hr.
---
A sec*

There is literally not porn though in 99.9% of posts. The only one I can think of is the zuhaar edit where the dude added a huge dick. Other than that there's risqué but not porn pics. Not to metnii nthe front page of reddit is full of straight up porn all the time.
---
Downvotes aren’t necessarily because they think you’re wrong. You just come off as a massive douche.
---
To be fair a 3rd party client could choose to record your login details as well as your bank pin.
---
You get an alt to partner slay and they do all the damage. You decrease your weapon stats to negative, to hit 0s and last hit the mobs for half exp. It works because "last hitting" doesn't require you to do damage, just to be the last to tag the monster. As soon as your alt does the final blow, you hit a 0 at the same time to steal the last hit and not get combat exp.
---
Nah it's just incorrect. In regards to getting high slayer on a level 3 the kempq method isn't at all useful. I mean, I see how it would be a decent guess, but it's a wrong guess at the end of the day.
---
Pot
---
It was to deal with more precise damage values. Actually they did it again, so someone with 99 constitution has max HP 9990. So, in RS3, it is possible to hit e.g 2234, which in osrs would be 22.34. so it simply allows for more precise damage
---
You think you found the perfect girl, but just before the big date she visits the Makeover Mage.
---
I'll try to remember! Hopefully they are still pushing ahead with them.
---
There are programs out there that will let you remind your keys if that helps.
---
yeah it is terribly laggy on 330, but at least if they made a second world it would reduce the lag overall as all the UK world would have people from the UK and reduce lag I would think? maybe i'm not sure but as midflowz said it would be nice if it was just seperated it so laggy playing on 330 and trying to slay or do bones etc.
---
If you stand there in the room, and you are into her, and she is into you. a hairy pussy is not going to be a deal breaker.

okkkkk :(
---
More like DULLetics!
---
you made me laugh idk why lol
---
I do the same thing. I got one guy who stayed until 8k. My finger hurt but he was happy, and strangely, I was too. I always start by showing a stack of 1m. I tell them "you can have this 1m. But I'll be adding 1 coin at a time." "The longer you stay, the more you'll get." "when you press accept, I'll stop adding coins and accept"
---
So I wonder, are they defining weights in their db as lbs and converting to kg for the ui?

Whar mental gymnastics do you have to do to even come to this conclusion? Lmao, if just the mere sight of the sand casino makes you want to go chuck your bank in a stake you likely were already at the sand casino on a daily basis anyways
---
Shouldn't expect to have a drop until 3x drop rate so have fun.
---
You're probably losing under 30k on death? What are you crying about. Wait till less players are online if you're getting attacked often or go do something else. If pking people like you is so easy then why dont you go do it your self and make some free gp. Again you're in the wildy you signed up to potential death.
---
Imagine playing Old School RuneScape Mobile on an Android device that isn't in the Samsung Galaxy Note™ family of phones and having to use your fingers to press things instead of using a stylus LMAO.
---
Mine works fine, except in Fossil Island. The Mushroom Forest is laggy as fuck.
---
What about tent whip vs hasta
---
I suppose if you ignore context that is one interpretation
---
The first time, I believe one of their reasons was for new players. The minimum damage they could take was 1/10th their health. After the update, I believe some low level creatures like Cows would hit below 10, so they were able to damage without it being as high.
---
imo almost all gaming subs attract toxic people.  I mean, just look at the internet in general and tell me there hasn't been toxicity notably popping up even irl from the internet.  A karma system, while it can help filter good posts and insightful or funny comments (just good in general), it is really easy for someone who disagrees to hit downvote, and the next guy to simply see the 0 and have a bias when reading the comment to also downvote it.  It's honestly why I don't think downvoting should ever be taken seriously and you should just form your own opinions on these matters.  Because actual helpful comments like OP's get swarmed by the hive mind and it gets buried in the controversial filter.
---
No, he PKs people at the wildly agility course
---
What about hasta vs tent whip. We are both 80s combat
---
I wouldn't say bitter, necessarily. Everyone is just stuck in their own social circles and doesn't use pub chat anymore
---
yea but that's because ironman limit themselves. otherwise u could just  buy addy boots
---
This couldn't be more wrong!
---
&gt;is acceptable

No, sir, it is not.

People shitting on Buicks but it's a comfy-ass ride
---

---
yea, this aint it.
---
It's so easy, just get it to 50. Make sure you got about 2mil to spare on training and building your house into a tele hub. Look up some of the most efficient layouts for a PoH and copy what you can do that's in your level.
---
Idk you could do it now but it wouldn't be efficient. I've never enjoyed it. Theyre slow and require a lot of banking  unless you have a looting bag and you can get pked. Others swear you can make bank. Honestly though if it's not peak hours you can probably do alright there. But even with good stats you can make more with fungi although I haven't done that in a long time so I'm not entirely sure if it's still that viable.

Have you been bringing your bank to do wilderness clues
---
I just got my bro into this game, but I am pretty far ahead level wose. Is there any good content we could do together for kicks?
---
Yes.
---
This was my favorite moment of his guides so far
---
Damn dude...
---
Lol the person commenting is from RoT what do you expect.
---
Need higher stats then the minimum generally to get max xp rate. The activities just generally get faster as your skills progress
---
Quality work my guy
---
Farm runs daily, easy to do on mobile every few hours.
---
No. It’s a joke but some people do bring valuables to the wilderness like idiots.
---
Wow! I just tested this because my Bullshitometer was beeping off the charts. This is 100% accurate.
---
Crawwwwwling innn my skiiiiiiiiiin
---
This sounds dry as fuck.
---
Wouldn’t recommend rapier for a while unless you’re potentially willing to lose a lot of money. The price is extremely unstable at the moment and has dropped almost 100m within the past week or so.
---
Ice burst till barrage
---
Imagine killing imps south of Falador in 2019
---
Yep
---
Unless you're rich as fuck, no. Keep Ice bursting. Look how much gp/cast the lower level barrages are. The rate increase won't be worth the cost increase.
---
There's never been an idea that I've seen that would be a RC game or update that isn't dry as fuck. 
---
Kinda the nature of the beast with that skill.
---
solo raids 2 is far from functional though, it's possible but never worth it.
---
I’m only 23 farming and I believe that’s all from quests 😔😭.  I’ll definitely look into it on the wiki right now though, thanks!
---
drier than it already is?
---
I can only imagine the betrayals and heartbreak. Life long friendships ruined by one high alchemy. Pure gold.

You have my hopes and dreams in that collection log...

I don’t know about olm flames, but you can splash on the undead spawn
---
I mean, they are synonymous and there are other tools with axe in the name... Not saying we should call them that, but if someone calls an axe "hatchet" I'd let it slid like with rocktail and angler.
---
There's a Barrows pet?
---
Tent will provide more dps, hasta more def. both viable. Depends if the tank/dps care about pet rolls.
---
Yeah I agree, just bring brews which are cheap and benefit from a higher hp lvl. It's not quite as powerful as cakes on a lvl 3 but 5 or 6 brews lasts me many games and takes up very little inv space.
---
So sorry for your loss. This is a wonderful tribute from a mother. &lt;3
---
Raw beef is in much higher demand because of the Player Owned Farms update, and it's easy to supply because of noobs in F2P. Rune plates on the other hand hit 15k due to the Mining and Smithing rework, making them smithable at level 50 Smithing instead of 99. They aren't BiS for F2P melee anymore either, that would be the Gud Raider chainbody from goblin raids since it gives strength bonus.
---
I love the skeleton.
---
Jokes on u bro, they just got 116gp.
---
But it has a pet though
---
Not lvl 3 combat.
---
You need a Hydra tail to make the necklace though
---
They tried doing this with the races in America and it didn't work out too well
---
PoH then rigour
---
I love how the only top level comment is super negative karma
---
Sorry for your loss, brother.
---
Ah thank you!
---
Mage attack bonus ain't bad.
---
Guess ill go with tent for more dps for faster kills
---
Not bad, just straight up useless.
---
Because a lot of people can't get blessing 4 yet. I have blessing 3 but it's limited teleports. 
---
But in the majority of cases when combat is involved (like this one), if you need to tele out it's typically going to include refreshing prayer and/or stats, so why not go ahead and do that in the process?
---
No more than 5. No less than 1m. Theyre better than wiz boots and holy sandals which are 400/750k comparitively.
---
Does your email service allow you to see a history of who logged into your email?
---
I never had to do it. But the idea is that you start punching an NPC, then xlog in combat with it. I believe that will log you out in 10 seconds or something like that. I can be wrong.
---
That's true, unless its a civic si I guess.
---
The reason for the change was to allow for mechanics where your max HP could be reduced via draining your constitution stat. Although I don't remember many bosses actually doing this, and it would be trivial as you could just sip a restore.
---
A recent comment mentioned this person was his cousin.
---
People could just...not go.
---
Jumping onto this question -I'm curious if killing the hill giant boss is possible without protection from range.
---
U need 100% and ROW(I) barely worth it. Definitely not as maxed.
---
How is he wrong? 1 dude asked "how did this specific person get their slayer exp" op responded with the incorrect method, and /u/askyoueverything said he was wrong. Now you could argue that he should have told him the correct method, but op is still wrong lmao.
---
He's hanging on to the point of "he was answering the question of "how did you get 68 slayer"" but he is not allowed to determine the intent of the reply, only the replyer is. 
---
The replyer might be just trying to add to discussion rather than giving a strict answer to the question.
---
This guy is being pitchforked because of the absolute stunning amount of stubbornness shown to avoid admitting a mistake, and the
---
moving of the goal posts.
---
Rune Darts aren't worth using except for maybe solo CoX and fast ToB runs (but then you might want to use Dragon Darts anyways)
---
No worries, no offence taken. Also depends on where you live, but here in Germany civics are very price stable and decent older ones or si are appreciating a little.
---
The chances of getting any to drops back to back is the product of the drop rates
---
If that’s the case, then it seriously needs a rework.
---
never too soon, i chuckled.
---
Ur not supposed to get them. Theyre literally addy armor. Its only for those who love castle wars. If u dont like it, dont play
---
yeah they can use the duel arena they just cant stake items
---
Lol thats iron

Besides the giant word BUICK 6 inches above the decal...

What’s up with runelite? Has it been hacked? 
---
Whenever I login it suddenly opens up a blank page in my browser and starts downloading something. (Also earlier someone had definitely been on my account as I logged in at a different place I logged out. Commented on this earlier) so I wonder if runelites been hacked.
---
i feel u dude
---
Wait 100% and ring of wealth? its not wildy so row does nothing and you sure as hell dont need 100% as only the brothers killed affect clue scroll drop chance
---
any shitty attitude is something you are projecting.
---
being right doesn't make you an asshole. he hasn't said anything pretentious, just that he stands by his assertions. fuck off with this lesson on manners.
---
That's not how the ring of wealth works
---
Welp, that's it. I'm going to change my password to some random fucking letters and numbers when I get home, and hope no one can guess my security questions.
---
I was backed before, years ago. And, I'm still not sure how they got into my account but I lost 120m. It was devastating then and made me quit for probably 2 years. I'm paranoid that its gonna happen again soon.
---
I think my shit was leaked on a database when the hack happened. I'm gonna create a new email and not use it for anything else but this account, while I'm at it.
---
Osrs SOA is for finding quest partners for shield of arrav and heroes
---
With out boot drop you don't break even if you have 'normal rng' and aren't completely lucky.
---
With current prices you will never ever break even, even with decent pages they are less than half the price now.
---
Gz
---
&gt;I have a reason to care about the herb sack
---
Bro, the herb sack is literally game changing, even for a regular account like me. Spectres, turoths, kurasks and any other herb dropping slayer task is my bitch now. 
---
I no longer worry about prayer potions because I have plenty of ranarrs. 
---
Just like in real life, an herb sack can change your entire game up.
---
I paid a dude 10k to deliver a chisel to me once, didn't even say I was going to pay them. Those people are saints.
---
You'll want a dragon crossbow and ruby/diamond dragon bolts to make it easier but it's definitely possible with rune crossbow and your gear
---
[Suggestion] Improve the chances of receiving this coordinate clue, and encourage people to go to the duel arena. This will cause people to buy bonds and thus stave off MTX for a bit longer
---
That's like hardly over minimum wage in some places.
---
We need this.

Too poor
---
It's meant for med level players, it isn't an endgame boss. Jagex said this in a previous Q&amp;A. If you more money do regular gargoyles lmao.
---
It's a double-edged sword, haha. But I like owning and driving a Buick, so I embrace it.
---
You don't. lol
---
“While alchs may be a come and go item, they're not always easy to immediately sell or alch, thus, an alch stash tab. It would be pretty difficult to determine what goes into this bank though, but it could definitely be broken up into different pieces. Eg. an armour storage box, and a magic weapon storage box, etc etc.”
---
This is when you have to make a sacrifice. You have the time to alch everything alchable if you want as well as sell it but it may not fit your schedule. Same thing irl your house is filled with lower tier clothes but you’ve upgraded. Sometimes you don’t find the time to sell everything so you have to “drop it”.  Same with food or resources do you really need to have an inv spot for shrimp or salmon if all you eat is sharks? Bank management is a skill on its own and jagex have done more than enough to accommodate people who can’t manage their bank.
---
Don't forget diamond dragon (e) bolts for the second half of the fight and ruby dragon bolts (e). Otherwise ur gonna have a bad time! Only use dragon if u have dragon c'bow or better, if u dont just downgrade. Other than that u should be more than fine!
---
And you don't even necessarily need to do those things unless going for diary rewards. I would probably say the only 2 "required" things are the 2 gang-related quests (as they unlock large chunks of content, including a few clue scroll spots/gear), and one of them can be done with a fresh/level 3 f2p throwaway alt.
---
I did read and it’s still not enough and should of been addressed way before it was imo keep in mind this is how I’m feeling after 3 years of paying and playing.
---
I'm all for this, as long as you can add a poiton bar as well. Always wanted a bar in my POH
---
Drug prices are outrageous,  can believe the pharmacies ask that much, 11 fuckin dollars, 8 might as well just delete my acc (akadie).
---
Ok, well you'll be fine with rune then. I think dragonhides will be a better option than void.
---
Don't worry about the dcb, but as long as you have Ruby bolts with diamond bolt switch you'll do fine
---
£30-35k gbp is like $40-52k USD. Doesn't seem that bad for an entry level programming job. That being said I don't live in the UK so I don't know how much things cost there.
---
Literally no one has called them hatchets ever.
---
I just  died on p3 because his ass did a fireball right where the opening was
---
Yeah, an ornament kit for Justiciar could stretch the limit of what's allowed in OSRS complexity-wise into unwanted territory. "WoW armor" is kind of an overstatement, but I agree with the principle.
---
You can blame that one on the community regardless, what happens when I'm in charge of designing armor looks more [like this](https://i.imgur.com/yG6aeFI.png).
---
Using runners is definitely buying it. Paying a premium for the fastest progression.
---
Not only that, but if you hate buyables, dont give that training the pet chance. Or just much much lower
---
For real. Beginner clues atm are a legitimate means of getting a F2p player into members, lets not make it easier for members to crash the market. Its bad enough beginner clues are on impling drop table.
---
I got downvoted to oblivion for replying to a post on here the other day about a guy who got a text from his wife how she was throwing his computer away because he played too much RuneScape. I made a comment saying something to the effect that that’s really no good reason to justify destroying somebodies property and you should just either talk out your problems or end the relationship. 
---
This subs weird
---
Who are all these people who have so little self control that they can't resist staking their bank in the middle of a clue scroll? It's really not that hard unless you have a real addiction.
---
Meh it's france
---
ohh i never knew that, thanks
---
Look at all the Runelite abusers in the comment section
---
It’s all of Reddit. They hate suggestions in general and everything that isn’t the usual hivemind material.
---
There is literally no point in using the rs client. Just use runelite. There is no reason not to and doing so gives you access to so many plugins that make the game much better
---
When was that update? I always remember you had 1 minute to pick it back up: the true assholes would barrage you so you'd lose it.
---
- Is it possible to change some of the German world labels into Dutch labels? Only change the label will be changed. We don't need an entire new world.
---
- What are your opinions about relocating Clan wars back into the Wilderness just how it was back in the day?
---
Oooh, that type of coke...
---
Sorry about your son. Hope you take some comfort in knowing he will of been loved and had many friends online in this community and the game.  May he RIP.
---
Or not your doing. Theres been tons of database breaches so if youve been on the net for over a decade your personal info is almost certainly out there by no fault of your own
---
**Can Viggora's master clue be reworked/deleted altogether?**
---
There are three locations where Viggora can be found:
---
•Paddewwa, Edgeville Dungeon, near the earth warriors.
---
•1st floor of the Rogues' Castle in the deep Wilderness.
---
•1st floor of the Canifis Slayer Tower, just before the Infernal Mage.
---
**The problem.** Some people are punished with extra risk having to go to deepest wilderness, while others can talk to Viggora in Slayer Tower - this is unfair. Basically, some people are **forced** to risk more just because they were out of luck during some insignificant miniquest.
---
well that just meant no one really brought them into pvp worlds or wildy, everyone used rune plate, team capes, and obby shields
---
Restriction induced innovation.
---
De-iron for 14m? yikes
---
Runelite
---
Target drop rate is 1/128
---
n=128 as per his equation
---
e=Euler's number constant (I'll use 2.718)
---
Your chance of NOT getting the drop after x kills based on his method is as follows:
---
After 128 (n) kills:
---
1/e^1 = 1/2.718 = 0.3679 = 36.79%
---
After 256 (2n) kills:
---
1/e^2 = 1/(2.718^2) = 0.1353 = 13.53%
---
After 384 (3n) kills:
---
1/e^3 = 1/(2.718^3) = 0.0498 = 4.98%
---
*may edit soon since I did this on mobile and no idea what format to expect*
---
LoL

Broken home nearly broke me!
---
not only do they believe that opinions are fact but they'll also regurgitate shit like "facts over feelings" as they throw around their shitty, emotional opinions
---
Thank you and I take a lot of comfort in knowing this!!!
---
All it does is save time. You can get all the info off the internet anyways from the wiki. It's literally the same thing except it is built in for convenience. Considering how long it takes to progress I dont think it's a big deal. Yes it will become second nature, however it's nice to have a reminder once in awhile for clues you dont run into often.
---
The lack of intelligent comments regarding level 3 slayer methods...
---
Yup 98 range dhcb/salve. Was using anti-dragon shield until my 1st visage (nice upgrade) then the 2nd drop got me my pegasians :) now bis for vorkath.
---
No not my slayermusiq

Till' we meet again in Lumbridge.

Why is it unflattering? My son passed from cancer? He loved playing Runescape and Diet Coke.. it is my wife’s way of keeping that part of him near our hearts?
---
I think it’s one of the least if not THE least popular series. No one plays Trouble Brewing, nobody visits Mos’ Le Harmless or Harmony either.
---
i dont think youre an idiot, i didnt know what it was fine either. its not exactly a popular acronym
---
I had to turn it off just because of the amount of birdhouse runs I do
---
Good thing he was drinking diet coke
---
You need to do one of the Myreque quests which has Nature Spirit as a pre-req which gives defense/HP xp
---
reminds me of those old randoms when ur axe head just flew away
---
Down voting is not an I disagree button, assholes.
---
This is his dad.. my wife made this for us
---
haha!
---
I tried to kill myself twice many years ago. Shit's still funny my dude. If you're not laughing, you're crying. Helps a lot of people cope.
---
Ive been playing the main game since 05 and still play rs3, everyone calls it hp not constitution lol.
---
With that logic, zulrah rotation picture and any guide should be banned as well. This is litterally injecting the solution into the game, defeating the whole purpose of clues
---
Reported.
---
How exactly? I tried the right-click option to duel and it disappeared after a line in the chat stated being an Ironman
---
I just gouge the price by an amount that I am willing to leave and come back for. If it is worth it to both of us its a win win
---
Being drunk isn't a good excuse to be a butthead, just fyi
---
The argument that you can't have buyable skill pets is so stupid me. You can adjust the drop rate of it to equal any number of hours that you want for any particular training method. they could make all the fast, meta training methods have a really low drop rate and the slower methods have a faster drop rate so it all evens out to "this pet is going to take x amount of hours to get on average" just like all of the other pets. At this point there's what, like 30 boss pets or something but we can't get the rest of the skills? I think it's outrageous and I haven't heard an actual good argument on why it shouldn't be a thing.
---
I’d take !
---
I'm pretty sure the chances of this happening are about 1/4k.
---
He's saying that you won't find much success at revs at all with 76 range. Many people at revs have 99 range + rigour on top of craw's bow, so you won't get any kills with your stats. Like the other dude said, you'll also be a big target for clans.
---
How are you making 1.5m/h at black chins. I have 94 hunter and I'm pushing for 99. Any advice? (Sorry I know this isn't on topic with your question)
---
Yeah there’d have to be a caveat in order to make sure you can’t use it for prayer and construction training, but it would be nice to have.
---
Just don't use the features you think are ezscape. I personally try to solve clues without the solver as a challenge, but still use it often. You can't change what other people use. This is like telling the UIMs that use vorkath/hespori/etc item banks to not do that.
---
If you don't like it, just don't use it
---
Using Ops Zulrah example of a 1/128 drop (n=128), the odds of not getting the drop after 128 kills is 1/e or 0.367. Meaning the odds of getting the drop is 1-0.367=0.633 or 63.3%, the probability given in the OP. 
---
Extending that, the odds of not getting it within 256 drops (2n) is 1/e^2 or 0.135 meaning you have a 86.5% chance of getting it.
---
Didn't know this rule honestly, but that's super useful. Does it extend to partial values of n or only integers, can I use e^1.5 for 194 kills?
---
make sure he gives full recovs and youre able to change the set + change email etc.
---
a lot of people just wait for the right time to hack it back
---
They're brand new with last weeks [treasure trail update](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/treasure-trails-expansion-and-easter-2019?oldschool=1#_ga=2.71768469.701073544.1555365467-1464246238.1542475047).

---
I feel this one
---
Its a bad ideology to have to babyproof anything that has negative impact to a small amount of people. I agree the clue is stupid, but if your alternative to getting people to stop staking is to take away a clue scroll step that reminds them of gambling.
---
This is sort of like if I were to ask for them to remove beer/ale/cocktails and even pubs from the game cuz I have a drinking problem. Needs of the many and all that. People can work on their personal demons outside of the game, Runescape has much more to offer than dueling.
---
Yeah I see that. My pin removal delay is set to 7 days I think. But it’s been so long that I’m just curious if you get a prompt in the chat box upon login that your pin is in the process of canceling. I can’t remember if that was a feature in rs2 or not
---
Do you know if there is a mathematical proof for this identity or ia it just something that was noticed?
---
I find that really strange, because the kills for sire are already pretty damn slow for a slayer boss, and its profitability isn't very competitive either.
---
Seems more accurate, had a triple into double into double back in 2010ish. With maybe one max two dry in between. Sadly removed all screenshots when RS2 died/EOC was announced to be launched
---
Had no one to share this with, but finally got my beans cape!@!@!
---
Will add a little bit of context here please up-vote this comment for FAQ answers on my post:
---
He had a mix of items in his inventory and i didn't think much of it. As soon as the duel started he done one whip hit and switched to the ham joint then ahrims staff then back to whip and somehow he was hitting 20+s on me before the first hit splat had disappeared on me (Confirming the hit speed buff glitch)
---
Not sure if this has already been noted by the player base..... This was a 500m stake and i still ended up winning as i 4 hit him.... Karmas a bitch ey. But look out for this one lads!
---
Watever afterlife is, i hope he is in a better place
---
I mean you need to get to kourend anyway, might as well use a house tab
---
I remember when I bought 12000 flax and spun it all. So much work.
---
His favorite thing to do was slayer, he was ranked top 100 in OSRS 30M+ slayer EXP
---
No they won’t.
---
Those were the days
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
Is it possible to add player bios? For instance if I could right click examine another player it could show in chat a short few hundred character message created by them?
---
Eh honestly I'd say I run into less toxicity now than I remember as a kid. I was scammed, name called and shamed for not knowing things about the game way more as a kid. 90% of the people I run into are genuinely willing to help and looking for members of the community to play with.
---
That's just my anecdotal evidence though, I'm sure you and others may have vastly different experiences.
---
Stay away from that place, you'll regret it forever. Gambling addiction is no joke and there's no way to know if you're vulnerable before you try it.
---
This is me right now lol my 3rd day in a row I feel the itch brewing
---
IMO definitly worth alching them if you dont have anything else to alch, they alch for 192 ea and you can get nats pretty easily for 180-200 ea especially if you buy from less popular shops like lunar isle. So it's basically free magic xp.
---
Keep in mind you should only be alching during other activities if you want to be efficient, but you'll get a ton of mage xp this way if you stick with it. I got the majority of my mage xp from 55 to 85 on my ironman just by alching maple longs during farm runs, quests,, agility etc.
---
ITT NEET virgins implying they wasted xp by getting a driver's license and knowing anything about cars
---
thank you! ive got gp to spare on my main, so i should be able to work this out!
---
Accurate is better in situations where you want to do more damage.
---
I'm cool with that.
---
Warding is really rubbing me the wrong way for some reason. I'd much prefer a dungeoneering-esque skill.
---
Not to mention, I would bet that a skill like that would generate more subs than warding, a skill that's bring brought into existence just because something doesn't exist there.
---
Sithe drak07 and p33bl3.

Why y'all joined my clan I ran as a 12 year old I'll never know.

Why have a clue anywhere?

What type of dog is this

Good bot

Shouldn't even be polled ffs just add it
---
*adderall*
---
it's very rarely if ever worth it for saving money. For example on a suqah task of 60 it would save you 2- 3 super restores depending on your prayer level if you consider the extra prayer bonus as well. At that point you're much better off simply using a torture ammy.
---
How else would you train construction if not for Larders in your? Building something in a workshop?? ^/s
---
N I C E
---
no its way too expensive, like you need 60 to feed them for 2 days, now imagine buying 1k of them thats like 1m
---
Yes I do. Stop whining about grinding and just do it.
---
I don't know the kill speed as a max but let's assume around 3.5min since I take about 5min at 85 all combats in prayer gear, that means 467 hours of barrows
---
No
---
SGB as well.
---
Wait is it really constitution in RS3?
---
Why is the lance and seemingly everything else drastically crashing
---
Underwater agillity is the most fun activity in the game!!!
---
what/where is that building
---
It does that because if you kill multiple dust devils in one tick runelite only registers it as one kill. You'll notice if you check your kills left towards the end of your task the runelite plugin will always jump from like 100 to 10.
---
Best wishes from all of us here, sad to see this especially so young. I hope you all the best.
---
I'm so sorry to hear about this, thinking of your family

loads of good tips ill definitely work on the others aswell

I honestly just voted for it cause it would make corp slightly more exciting. Can't think of a place where divine would be useful though lol
---
I really like it cause you still have to source everything you use, but you don't have to play all alone.
---
Yep sounds like that’s a legit thing. Insert spaghetti code explanation.  Dear fuck did Jagex really forget to balance check the new cosmetics.  If so ham joint might not be the only scam in game right now so watch out for shady shit with new clue items.
---
Rest in peace 😢
---
Eh? You just do a normal friendly duel with obstacles on. It's completely fine, I've done this clue step probably like a hundred times.
---
Make it part of a new 99 firemaking emote

Why are Konar lizardman tasks split into so many locations that are all right next to each other? Molch/settlement shamans aren't considered a part of the swamp, and neither are shamans in the slayer-only underground caves (where the old safespot was.) This is despite the entire area being called the "Kebos Swamp."
---
Basically, the lizardman Konar tasks are named badly and should be reconsidered and/or recategorized.
---
A Hosidius rework is on the way. Here's the [blog post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/kourend-rework-2-hosidius-house?oldschool=1) from October.

I know, I know, but it'd still be AWESOME to have a group, where other people know the group didn't cheat on their gear, just like official ironmen!
---
It's all about that helmet brudda!

Idk. I commented first.
---
get a fucking job
---
yeah I don't like the 'name but it's II' thing either

As a fellow 3rd bat guy 11-15 and scaper sorry for your loss

Depends on the day and what's going on but weekends around 10, weekdays around 3.

Well they need the hand free to hold their lacrosse stick

My buddy and I got members the same day. Picked enough flax to buy whips if we sold basically everything we had. It wasn't practical for anything, but man it felt good.
---
I don't think you've got it all right mate. It's literally a disadvantaged account, just in between Regular and Ironman in terms of restrictions.
---
Thankyou! 🙂
---
You both said mgsv2, and you both are talking about the same exact thing, it's just worded differently. What is going on?
---
Made more than me sitting at ogress warriors lol
---
Yes very simple apply to several places in your area and muster up about $11 then buy membership.
---
Next time u do membership do more quests

What an insult. Might as well just call him the B word at that point

I'll keep that in mind. I'm kinda hoping playing as a iron man will help me be more efficient and such on my main
---
You don’t understand science.

An opinion by definition can be neither good nor bad though that's the point of it. A belief or thought process may be good or bad but an opinion may not.

Yeah I had that card almost a decade ago, haven't heard that in a while...
---
So what formula did he use to get 1/54k? I know the drop rate for items goes up they more items u get per chest since u cant get dupes, but each additional item would only get like 5% rarer, so at the most its probably like 1/6k. I dont see where the 1/54k number comes from.
---
There's a subreddit for this, I forgot the name tho
---
I mean just coming from a long time player it’s close to summer rn so usually people seem to dump gear right around now (idk this shit hits me every year spring break somehow) and stock up on supplies for those bigger grinds to knock out.

New to raids 20 kc all done in teams either at 4 or huge teams ffas just wondering how I can increase my point average! I use void so I know it’s not the best but I’m still learning but I watch a ton of videos and see people getting 20-25k points in team raids by themselves and I can only manage max like 13-14k points on my best raids with no deaths I’ve started to get to where I don’t die unless I get stacked out to a mistake but either way just wondering how I can increase my personal points because all I can seem to find is ffas anyway so going to need more points to get a drop hopefully one day! Thanks in advance for the help!
---
How?

Hot maid out fit. I could use it on role playing world

I should probably do that too, iirc it might be a diary thing (or maybe its just something in the shop? either way will look it up)
