You can tick manipulate by eating food. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nzqM3t_O4 for an example. 
---

---
You can use this to boost your level, slightly increasing your chance of catching a fish, while also starting off a tick manipulation cycle.
---
If you looking for a method, try farming herbs, only have to login every now and then for 10 minutes
---
I just dropped the pyramid plunder emote step because it was the first one
---
I've never done it before, and I quite like the idea of at least knowing roughly how to do some of the bosses I've never done :)
---
I think you went a little over the droprate.
---
yeah so please find the nearest gun and suck start it
---
I'd feel a bit better if I could have case sensitive passwords at the very least.
---
I never understood how farming works and everything dies XD but i could look up a video. I made like 2.8m in mems before the bond died now im doing ogresses for the rest of the bond money
---
And if we are referring to race what would you call them
---
It aint much but its honest work
---
Fishing and woodcutting are decent money for being so afk. I afk monkfish often which require the quest Swan Song. I also afk magic trees and yew trees in woodcutting guild, but that sucks before ~80 woodcutting.
---
Thats irrelevant, a stupid person would still get assistance in account retrieval from a good support team.
---
Yeah I think that's definitely worse than me being a non-iron... I feel for you man!
---
Is it rude to refer to Christians as Christians? I literally don't get why it's bad to say Jew
---
Kit is probably the most entertaining, but Jim Browning does a lot more to actually stop them.
---
Personally I don't like watching the other guys who aggressively call the scammers retards after RATing their computer and deleting everything on a backed up virtual machine.
---
A Jew? I'm not offended. I don't care.
---
i would. get them out of the way and use member time for other things.
---
Lol he was arguing with the guy while he was running back with his loot, he didnt seek out the confrontation.
---
Even if he had, what does that have to do with spam bots at the GE? P mods are allowed to still play the game and do whatever they want, they're not just gonna sit and mute chat bots all day long.
---
I don't know. I don't make the rulebook for things people get offended by.
---
No, it was between vene and the skeleton boss (can't think of it atm). I remember running south passed someone doing vene and seeing them immediately chat "dude really??" as I was teleporting XD

DS2 is some of the best content I have played on a game in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyed it and MM2 isn't as bad as people would have you believe.
---
I was just saying that fighting with someone through chat that you're NH'ing is proportionally less useful than muting spam bots at the g/e, especially more so than posting it on reddit. I wouldn't want to mute people all day either.

I'd recommend training your magic a bit so you have access to teleports. Focus on attack and strength over defence since they'll help you hit more accurately and do more damage so the defence training will go more quickly. Keep them about even until you get 40 attack for rune scimitar and then train strength more as that determines your max hit.

I got half way through and said you know what? I don‚Äôt have time to sit through that fucking novel. Can someone PLEASE give us a quick synopsis of this essay?
---
You're right, the majority of hacked accounts are those without any additional security that have left themselves more vulnerable. 
---
But Jagex don't really do much to prompt or warn new players about setting up additional security either.
---
A new player with no previous knowledge or experience of the game could pay for membership for several months, spend a lot of real money on bonds for in game currency, and lose it all because they hadn't yet explored the Security Stronghold to even know about the 2 step authentication even existing. 
---
Since the launch on mobile, the amount of people who are in that situation has skyrocketed. There are a lot more legitimate cases now than there were before attracting all of these new and inexperienced pay to play players to the game. 
---
But regardless of how right, wrong, smart or stupid the player may be, Jagex really should be showing more respect and care for their community. If it wasn't for the loyal players who stuck with them, they would never have survived long enough to launch OSRS on mobile. RuneScape of all games should understand the true value of a loyal community more than any other game I've played, and their attitude when dealing with players should be a lot more reflective of that.
---
The victory message is so fitting
---
Wow yeah that model is ROUGH
---
I'm curious, what is the extent of your power as a P mod?  My understanding is you only have the power to levy temporary mutes.  What's the maximum length of time you can mute someone for, and also, are you able to customize the length of the mute?  Also, thanks for what you do every day!  Making runescape a better place.
---
Bro, I was just saying have a good day because I was going to stop replying to you since you're being overtly-aggressive towards me for having a different opinion. You're reading too far into it.
---
All I was saying was that it's probably better to be muting spam bots at the grand exchange instead of posting these pictures on reddit because it happens every day. I'm sorry to the OP if he found that aggressive, but now you're just being a dick for no reason. 
---
I get what you're trying to say, that's just not my opinion. And like you said, you're trying to change my opinion and it's just not happening, probably no thanks with how aggressive you're being. 
---
Stop attacking me with vulgar words because I have a different opinion than you. I accept the fact that downvoting my posts makes you feel like your own opinion is more validated, but please resort to that and that only, minus the namecalling and childish behavior. 
---
I'M leaving, and I hope I have a good day. Is that better? Bye!

Can anyone explain why Toy Horsey was even selling? As far as I know, it doesnt do anything and you can get it from Django? Curious why so many were successfully sold for such a big profit
---
Because there have been 0 PvM updates that require a dwh since january and there arent any on the horizon anytime soon either
---
That‚Äôs a solid suggestion, I still think from a profitability standpoint F2P getting full member LMS is silly 
---
FOG wasn‚Äôt like this and F2P players still really enjoyed it 
---
But the idea for the rewards is great

Also even 317 is bot / auto switch bot filled

[[harry's cutlass]] is closer to being cutlass than that eird thing.

---
 &gt;Harry's cutlass is a special weapon sold by Smith on the docks of the island of Mos Le'Harmless. It originally belonged to a pirate named Brass Hand Harry, who lost his right hand in a battle off the coast of Karamja. He had Smith create a cutlass with a gauntlet fixed to the hilt in order to continue fighting. Smith will sell one to the player for 1,040 coins. It requires an Attack level of 20 to wield.

For con I started at 81 like a few weeks ago and just played a couple hours here and there to knock it out. For some reason I couldn't focus on just doing con for more than like 2 hours.
---
if you don't care about the money at all, you could make arrowshafts or fish karambwanji
---
I can agree with the above statement anywho. Phase 1 max 2 vents Phase 2 dont spec near the hp threshhold or risk wasting your spec. Phase 3 watch ur hp and run energy
---
Per-kill rate is 1/381
---
So the likelihood of getting it at KC 195 is:
---
1 - (380 / 381) ^ 195
---
= roughly 40% chance of getting that drop on or before 195
---
*edit* before downvoting me, educate yourselves https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bdia29/quantifying_dryness/
---
In other words, if you made 100 accounts, and all 100 accounts got KC 195, roughly 40% of those accounts would have 1 tassets drop
---
I didnt even use any vulgar words in my last comment?  Please stop acting like such a victim lmao
---
I still dont understand your point.  Do you think OP should be spending all day at the GE muting spam bots?  You already said no, so what do you want from them?  If you dont expect them to be at the GE muting spam bots 24/7, why does it matter if he was NH pking and talking to the guy who was flaming him????
---
What was even the point of your original comment?
---
Also, generally a good way to get someone to stop replying to you is to *stop replying to them*, rather than condescendingly telling them to have a good day and then acting surprised when they tell you to fuck off

There's no such thing as luck. There is merely statistical chance of something happening, and your "streak" has zero influence on it
---
pedantic, but there are certain activities/animations where you don't regen run either
---
Let me clarify no one with brain gets hacked or recovered.  You know how hard it is to leak so much personal information to get recovered?  My friends are retards two of them clicked phishing links and one of them shared account details with multiple people.  People that hack and bot don't try and appeal after a ban on those accounts because they already RWT'd and made the money they want.  Sounds like the only one who needs sleep my friends had great CS two of them got free membership for the trouble, just because I was the one who recovered for them doesn't mean they didn't get good CS.  How fucking stupid are you to think they tried to recover before they asked me?  I've played runescape the longest so they asked me to do it as they are new to the game and didn't even know you could recover an account.
---
Same thing happened to me for 2b. But it was slightly different. I‚Äôm sure it was the same guy tho because he told me he got a 3a now earlier too
---
I got muted for calling someone a ‚Äúnoob‚Äù.  Then the same day I  got unmuted I got muted again for drawing boobs, I used to be so proud of my boobs too because I used ALT 0183 which is a dot (same exact one used for ‚Äúperiod‚Äù except it‚Äôs placed in the center of the text box, making ‚Äúperky nipples‚Äù instead of natural saggy ones.  I would also use a period and the alt code (one on each boob) and say it was a woman jogging.

Appreciate the reply, enjoy that awesome cape and house!

Man now all that combat exp you get from Slayer is gonna be wasted :(

if he literally just completed dragon slayer he didn‚Äôt do the quests to unlock nmz, my guy probably did sand crabs

why?

Mutagen is 1/13k
---
That's what I thought
---
Damnit I get this shit all the time. I did use Runelite, and did play around with some of the settings to see what they did. Unless my account was hacked, they used botting software and didn‚Äôt do ANYTHING (my bank was exactly the same and I was in the same spot. None of my levels had changed). I‚Äôm not saying Runelite for sure caused it, but probable cause would say it was. I still use Runelite, and haven‚Äôt had any other problems
---
Probably because he‚Äôd still murk your ass. You aren‚Äôt out there doing shit to begin with so keep your opinion to yourself.
---
You using way to many napkins.
---
Really hope for this I've tried to get more attention to it a few times rs is such a solo game sometimes
---
 i feel like anything to push social game play without requiring it is good. Would be easier to get friends to play if we could slay together easier its hard though the drastic level difference always makes it hard to partner slay

Interesting example - a Zulrah bot when they get banned means at the very least theyve lost a significant amount of levelling/questing time.  Its why theyre coming out of fashion.  Tell me, how much investment time does it take to make an LMS bot?  Want me to find you the tutorial island world record?

Thanks for helping me illustrate the difference to you, couldnt have done it without you giving that example.

I was muted for stating: "if someone knows your password, it isn't hacking"
---
Lay off the coke my friend .
---
"One guy getting the piss taken on him on Twitter doesn't equal bad CS you dumb fuck."
---
Someone getting the piss taken on them is exactly what equals bad CS you dumb fuck. Your idiot friends who arnt tech aware and share all their information with everybody could be the majority of their player base. 
---
Your idiot friends are exactly the kind of people who need to worry about being hacked, and if that does happen I hope they'll get a better response from Jagex than this guy did. 
---
Now go and take a breather, stop dribbling over your phone and calm down before you give yourself a brain hemorrhage. You haven't made a single bit of sense since you started commenting and I really don't care to hear any more about your retard friends or their local legend of RuneScape who saves everyone's account. Fortunately the rest of the community are mature enough to understand the basic expectations of customer service and business ethic. I doubt you'll ever progress to a point of understanding what the fuck your even saying yourself.

It's always hundreds of GP per cast at higher levels but the damage is lower and the accuracy isn't better than something like ranged. (Ranged is actually more accurate and higher damage at a lower cost)

---
He called it. You're at top of reddit
---
Believe it or not my live had actually been secured up till recently, I cannot recall why I took it off, or if I did, just a chain of unfortunate events I guess.
---
Firstly let's talk about context.  English isn't his native language and although I'm sure he understands what the words mean, the gravity of those slurs, especially in north american culture is something that many europeans underestimate.  I don't know for sure what Verf knows but I know a lot of foreigners think the f-t word or n word are on a similar level as "idiot" or "dumbass".
---
Secondly, I believe someone who intentionally uses those words regularly is pretty shitty, at least when it comes to respect for their fellow human beings.  That being said, we all say things we don't mean when we're extremely upset or frustrated.  It doesn't make it acceptable but I don't think defining people by the mistakes they make in their worst moments is appropriate.  
---
Most people, including you hold others to a way higher standard than they would for themselves.  I won't make excuses for Verf or justify his behavior, I merely choose to be open minded about what lead to Verf saying what he said instead of immediately assuming he's a racist homophobic biggot.  I can almost guarentee you'd judge just about everyone as a shitty person including yourself if you were given a no-context showcase of their worst moments in life.
---
  
---
The next time Verf gets caught using slurs I won't defend him.  I think it's important to condemn behaviour such as using those words so we can have fewer people using them in the future, but please save the judgement and demonization for people who consistently prove they deserve it.
---
I was already at 75 and figured I'd see if I could get a sceptre on the way, ended up with two.

---
The dragon full helm costs 40mil and doesn't have very good stats. The rest of his gear is suboptimal and this guy clearly has the stats and money to wear better stuff. So he probably bought the gold with real world money, and then bought the most expensive/ badass looking gear without really researching what is stronger
---
Oh ok, sorry for misinterpreting.
---
oh shit lol I had no clue
---
Sometimes you want to click 'history'
---
Look at the post you dull cunt, they already did reply to the appeal. My whole point is the language they use in that reply. So now after running out of irrelevant things to talk shit about, your scraping the bottom of the barrel with "are they meant to reply to everyone then?" To a post that's specifically about the reply the sent. 
---
It really is such a shame that you don't require an IQ level to breathe because you are hands down the dumbest cunt I've ever talked to.
---
Definitely down like 200 or so collectively. When I was nearing max combat (all 97s) after winning a few I thought I could actually win stakes 50/50,so I chucked my 150m in pieces til I was cleaned with just a blowpipe and like 20m in gear. Rebuilt with revs/vorkath till I had like a 70m bank. Cleaned again and only had a blowpipe and like 10m in gear. Made it back to a 70m bank largely due to grinding Hydra for a month. Got two hydra claws nearly back to back so went to 240m bank. Hit the duely again, lost a 25m, 25m, 50m, 70m, 30m in a row and only had a blowpipe and ags to my name. Rebuilt to 30m after winning a few ags/fury nh risk fights. Then made 250-280m from duely with 30m.
---
Lesson - Don't ever rage stake large amounts, rage stake 1ms till you get a streak to do a 2m. When I made all that money I would walk bank my original amount after winning, and then try to streak doing 5ers (5,10,20m would make me a lot of money).
---
Or just be my friend and win 8 stakes in a row doubling down each time and have a 2b bank starting from 16m.
---
The only situation that c bow beats blowpipe is when you need range, which acb is already better at (see zilyana). Cbow could fill a niche for a cheaper alternative while doing Slayer or something, but they'd have to make it better than msb (i). I personally have always used cbow for doing full rotations of DK's because staying out of Supremes range is very important, but I also don't struggle with dps there as I always kill prime fast enough that I don't have to worry about rex spawning mid-supreme kill.

Speaking from experience as someone who hopped back into the game in late March, I trained all f2p stats to be at least 50-70 before going membs and highly recommend it. Gave me a good base to start off of when I eventually bought and I didn‚Äôt have to spend money/time leveling up most grind skills; I just dove straight into the expanded quest and mini game content. 
---
Are there things in membs that can make that early leveling quicker and easier? Yes. However in 3 1/2 months as a casual player (1-2 hours a day average), I was ready to switch over with runecrafting being my lowest at 50.
---
On a btw account, yes. On regular, no. Herb is expensive, but you can get 450k xp/hr with brews.
---
Oops. Fixed it.

You can indeed, but Addy Full to Rune Med isn't much of an upgrade.

I think LMS is just viewed as a warmup or practice for hybrid pking isnt it

how so? i have a special account where i train most things with out hp xp? this guy is stopping me and 40+ people from having a good time.  i am a real player unlike more then half that play this game? where wasnt i relaxed? i yelled over reddit? im confused sir?  i was asking why this is allowed in game... the guy aint doin it for xp hes doing it for one reason to be an asshole which is disruptive
---
then it should disconnect every 3 minutes to fully simulate 2007.
---
Fek you're right
---
You can hit zuk on rapid for the whole kill with ACB whereas with DCB you need to switch to long ranged on the corners I think. You can also hit the Jad on the Zuk wave with ACB from the western corner if you use the long ranged option for 1 hit. Most healers are tagged using blood barrage I believe
---
It‚Äôs insane u 3 hit every dragon and the bow pays for itself in no time plus ez 99 range. Think it‚Äôs cheap rn. I also thought I was on a private server lol
---
Of course. I used the Trident of the Swamp for attacks, I had the Occult Necklace, Seers Ring, Dusk boots and Gloves, Ahrim's Robetop, hood, and robeskirt all to maximize mage damage. My Mage level was 75. 
---
For the inventory what ended up working best was 20 brews, 6 super restores, a 1-click teleport and mith darts. 
---
You'll pray missile and mystic might the whole fight, no need for flicking. 
---
The fragments normal attack is a 2 hit missile that will take between 0-3 hit points whilst praying protect, so you won't be taking much damage at all outside of the 98% or so spec attack. 
---
Phase 1 she teleports you next to her for a melee attack but it's easy to run or even walk away before she hits you. 
---
The second phase phantom versions of herself will spawn and all do her normal attack on you so you'll take a bit more damage this phase but not much. The phantoms disappear when you attack the actual Fragment, who emits a different colored light than the others. Also an easy phase because you can deal a hit to her when you tag her and immediately start attacking again. 
---
Phase 3 can cause problems later on, this is where the mith darts come in. She spawns healing pillars of light that don't heal much individually, but later in the fight she spawns 4 of them and can restore a good 60-80 HP if you aren't fast enough getting them. However, they're all 1-hit so you'll use the darts to quickly eliminate the pillars. 
---
As soon as you've gotten the last one, brew up to max health which shouldn't be that much, and the fragment will freeze you in place. At this point drink 1 or 2 brews to get above your max HP because her attack takes almost all of your max hitpoints away. Then brew up to about half or a little less than half of your health and drink (preferably) 2 but 3 if you need restore doses. Optimally only 2 if you've only used 6 Sara brews to overload then heal back up. 
---
Then basically rinse and repeat. Each phase gets more difficult as you move along I think her melee hits quicker, more phantoms spawn, and she spawns more healing pillars, and finally she deals another percent or 2 of your total HP with her final spec attack. 
---
But the phases always go in that order which makes it easy to keep straight what you need to do at any given point. 
---
I'd maximize DPS and focus on only offense until the healing pillars spawn, and then keep attacking after the pillars have been destroyed whole making sure you're overloaded for her spec. Then as soon as the spec hits start attacking again while rapidly brewing and restoring back. 
---
I'll tell you what got me the first 2 times. The first time I got her to around 350-400 but was being too slow or misclicking trying to destroy the healing pillars. This basically put the fight in limbo because they restored so much of her health every cycle I couldn't beat her before my supplies were out. 
---
Now that I'm recalling I think I failed 2 more times not 1. I actually died the second time tanking too much damage, what I think happened was if you stand too close she can melee you which got me since I would only brew back up to 35-40 HP (I'm 79 HP level) until I overloaded for her big spec attack again. So watch out for standing too close to her while running around trying to tag the pillars. And the 3rd attempt I over-breweed throughout the fight and ran out of supplies. This fight takes a little longer than Galvek and other quest bosses, I wanna say it will take 10-12 minutes if you're in my range of CB 99/75 mage. 
---
That being said, you only need to really heal up to 35% or so of your health to deal with phases 1-3, and try and not use more than 6 brews total in overloading and healing back up to maximize efficiency with the 2 doses of restore as well. 
---
Good luck, this was probably grossly excessive but I know detailed Reddit comments helped me learn different strats for bosses and other hard parts of quests so hopefully this can be of some help! It's definitely doable if you're prepared to take out the healing pillars quickly and efficiently and accurately handle her devastating spec attack

guys dumb question...but what is PING?
---
It sounds like you shared your account with some shady people. Sorry man
---
Tf dude. Every single lms pker uses the f2p worlds. And your good ping world should be filled for at least half the day (on peak)
---
Delay, so the time between something happening and you seeing it, along with you clicking and it actually happening. 
---
Lower ping means less delay, which is good.
---
literally everyone realizes this. the savings are just not that big a deal and runescape is a video game so people put off the un-fun thing. also 99 construction is expensive and even if you have the money it's useful to keep it liquid until you're ready to burn it maxing.
---
Thanks. i mean he just tried to feed his family
---
Dude i pk everyday on 300 to 500 in the real wild. You just switch a tick or 2 before and you can still 1 tick everything. I am australian and it honestly feela wei4d playing on good ping. Been on the f2p aussie lms world everyday and had no issues on the laggy us and really laggy eu worlds during aussie mornings.

Why has the Elysian Spirit Shield gone up so much? When I last played it was like 400-500m, now it's 700+? Will it stop rising any time soon? I've been considering selling mine for skilling, but if it's going to keep rising I might hang onto it...

Weiss is fine, it has a mining and a herb patch as well as a cool quest and an impact overall with the fores. Ice fishing or one more festure would be cool, and the town itself is lacking they could have used the cave and sneaky maze part around the city ¬´square¬ª for something after the quest as well

The comment you responded to said "Just magically wave his hand and he can scam you, basically out of pure will", and you said "It can happen", but then you outline that how it happened was most likely a mistake by the guy that got scammed, so definitely not "poof like magic".

Just sheer will of a hacker is not enough, to get hacked you need to have made a security mistake along the way and that was the argument, and you responded to that.

You weren't quoting at all, if you were at all close to what was being said that would be something but like 90% of that quote was entirely made up by you.

Have both sides of a particular shortcut have a shared storage. Alternatively it doesn't have to be a STASH unit, just a crossbow dispenser that you have to charge with mith grapples.

For your second question, the gauntlet is like dungeoneering lite. It has a few unique rewards including a pet and a ~150m (?) weapon.

80+ combats you could probably grind out within a couple days if you afk crabs/nmz all day for like 12 hours. Not as sweaty as it sounds because you only need to interact with the client once per 15-20 mins.

Maxing efficiently takes like 2k hours I think? More realistically 4-5k for your average player I think.
---
Quit RS probably ~2010, intermittently coming back to see how the game was going. Tried out OSRS again recently and got sucked back in. Probably have a few thousand hours accumulated since I came back. Please help
---
Can‚Äôt really give you an accurate answer for the first part, but you can for sure get back into it super easy. They added a lot of new stuff but the nostalgia is still there. My advice would be to use the OSRS Wiki a lot, YouTube videos, and join a cc that‚Äôll help answer questions.
---
Ooh, sounds very interesting!
---
Is the Gauntlet worth doing in terms of gp/hour at the moment? Or only for pet hunting?
---
I assume that means the Prif course is now better then rooftops unless you want marks of grace? I was doing Relekka until Ardy, but perhaps that might not be the best option anymore.
---
 I've heard a bit about these crystal shards and divine potions. Are there any other uses for the crystal shards, and where are the divine potions worth using? The wiki says the boosts only lasts 5 minutes, so i'm wondering if there might be places where inventory space is at a premium where preserve + regular potions might be better?

Well ahead of it all, changed just about everything.
---
Me and my friends used to run a pretty good con. Basically one person goes around offering to upgrade and "enchant" someone's armor/weapon by using a "special spell" for a fee. I would also have have multiple friends planted in the area.
---
So I go around offering to upgrade and enchant, and usually people were pretty skeptical about the whole thing. So one of my friends would come up to me and ask about my special upgrade spell. I would "sell" my friend on the idea and then we would trade, and I would take my friends armor, and then cast bananas to gold(so it looks like I'm using my special spell) and then trade back my friends armor. He would then have a second set of armor but made out of upgraded metal. So for example he gives me iron and when we trade back he puts on steel. 
---
If the mark was still skeptical I would "convince" another friend of mine to let me upgrade his armor as well. 
---
Usually after seeing multiple people have their shit upgraded by my spell they would fall for it and then pay me to take their stuff. It worked almost every time and I got a lot of good shit. I'm sure people fucking hated me haha.

Yeah. The post states, "we thought it would be beneficial to improve the Bind, Snare and Entangle spells by removing the duration limiting effect of Protect from Magic", so there's not a reduction anymore.

you can still look for a one or a small number as there aint that many in it

Engine doesn't support it properly. Ideally to me partner slayer = slightly larger tasks. Reduced experience per kill but you can contribute together.
---
So instead of both getting 200 tasks, and if you help eachother getting half XP, so instead you do it solo essentially. You get 250 task and you get 75% XP for every kill. That way the experience will work out the same and it won't shift the meta. But you can help eachother out.
---
People already alt lure for slayer meta. It's not like its unheard of to involve a second account. They'd only have to look at the burst tasks (nechs and dust devils) and make sure the meta doesn't shift to duo partner that.

you can do this with almost any item thats this low, its not a secret

Strange I'm very successful at what I do for work and it required lots of education.  Your only point so far has been wow CS used unfair, mean, or bad language.  How could they possibly do that.  You fell for this kids bait hook line and sinker and should feel like a fucking moron moon monkey.  NO ONE WHO STEALS AN ACCOUNT TO BOT IS GOING TO TRY AND APPEAL THE BAN THEY WILL JUST MOVE ON TO THE OTHER STOLEN ACCOUNTS THEY HAVE.  This kid likely botted himself failed a recovery and is trying to get another chance but you are  a brainlet retard who can't see that.  If he failed by going through the main source of account recovery the website, which here is a secret you won't understand cause you are a moron moon monkey it actually works.

I mean maybe. But someone with 20,000 Vorkath kills could just as easily be seen in game as a level 126 with some expensive gear and really high stats and someone would want to target him just as much

In rebuttal, i've been told that my pure is shit and I should go kill myself multiple times by passers by while skilling on my pure - just because i'm a pure. I had some guy at Zalcano crash my 4 man and start flaming my group because he got MVP and we didn't.  I don't believe it's a pker problem standalone - it's a manchild on Runescape problem, because apparently many people on this game have never grown up.
---
I disagree with you, because while it is not a great idea for the BIS pickaxe drop to be in the wilderness, there is no doubt that it has brought a lot of action to the wilderness, whether PVMers like that or not. It has also made the pick coveted and has brought upon a nice price tag because of the conflict. 
---
I don't understand your point on how it is killing pking by buffing a standard spellbook spell - how is it going to kill pking? If anything, it allows pkers who are using a standard spellbook setup to actually close out on kills **solo** rather than having to rely on their teammates. That's a good change.
---
The problem i'm seeing with your argument is that you're looking at it from a purely PVM perspective. I get that but with things like this it is important to see it from the other side of the pon

Really starting your reddit account off with a bang, eh?
---
But that is fine, voting system is to determine *what the players want*. Im a player just as much as any PKer and have every right to vote against anything that makes it easier to kill me, as thats what I want to use my vote on. There is zero problem with this
---
I think he has a hit points skill Cape
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
Agree, the pvmers that flame me are always the ones panicking.
---
To escape camp high HP, turn on augury and auto retaliate while frozen and you will lower their dps. If tb'd go to the nearest mobs to try and get a box or to pj off your attacker or run through trees if available.
---
Many people just commit to running south instead of trying to get gap or a pj
---
Oh I know but this one is the option C and all the options are quite bad and unfitting

Training cooking from 50-75 using Hosidius range and cooking gauntlets: should I cook lobsters or swordfish?
---
NB4 no parrots...
---
good bot.
---
I just hit base 80 combat stats. Should I train with whip on controlled from here on out on tasks or train str with dragon scimmy or sara sword to 90 or 95?
---
Will try, thank you :)
---
literally ad room :(
---
Wow slightly under drop rate! Incredible minor luck!

You mean worldwide football &gt; american handegg?

Leaked database is a thing... if your rs password was the same as other forums/websites they can easily get it of there was a breach...
---
Dont worry, happened to me too, i was stupid same rs password for like other forums and stuff....
---
You live and learn... dont be bummed out, youll soon forget it
---
This is like hcim bitching they cant safely do wildy bosses. Fuck sakes man you chose to play that account style - YOU made the decision to limit yourself. The game should never be balanced around something that isnt the "main" game "mode." 
---
And while i do agree with the polling system if their gonna use it then use it, but certain things SHOULD be done that dont pass, and I have no issue with that being done. But i understand why folks would be pissed since theyre the ones who implemented the vote system. 
---
Lastly, this isnt even that big of a deal.
---
Players will never vote against their own interests. Why would a PVMer vote to nerf their best defence in the wild? If the Dinh's made players literally invincible they still wouldn't vote against it even if it's for the betterment of the game.
---
These changes were needed but would have never passed a poll.
---
22 with gf here. Haha.  Can't play runescape anymore though.
---
cheers
---
Op: hey look at this quirky little thing I do
---
Brainlet redditors: ITS NOT EVEN HARD DUDE REEE
---
Who the fuck are you? Take a hike moron, nobody asked you to speak. Sucking off and trying to defend the whiny trolls makes you look desperate as fuck. Do something useful with your life you pathetic weasel of a human.
---
Hi, thanks for reporting this, this has quickly been fixed and now has the correct 50 Attack and Strength requirements :).
---
Dragon Spear spec nerf failed the poll 3 times but they did it in anyways. Certain things just need to be done for the health of the game even if the community is too dumb to realize it.
---
"Wah, I might get killed by a solo pker now."

FYI, salad robes still cost more than your dhide.

Exactly. Its boring. Its the same maxed builds fighting each other. I remember being able to pk in my 60 att/75 str/60 def acc with d long/dds and get kills because i was one of the first pkers who sort of went by the "no saying" code of honor. But this also baited people into being lower hp themselves.
---
&gt;	One possible alternative might be that somebody has had a long day at work dealing with horrible clients, hops on RS as a form of escapism (playing computer games is a common way of emotional regulation)...
---
Then he needs anger management. This is a game. A game with real people on the other side of that chat box.
---
Also, every single pker I‚Äôve seen must‚Äôve had a bad day at work because most speak this way lol
---
Old School RuneScape or Clan Wars?  
---
No.  
---
But we do it anyway because we're all masochistic.
---
Why didn't you just get the drop sooner?

Troll account, look at the name and flair.

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄJAGEX WONT RESPOND TO THIS POSTü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Yeah um, how about you just bleach my fucking eyes while you're at it please?
---
We just not going to acknowledge the composting unfilter change? That should have been the headline update imo. Not a huge fan of the dihns nerf but all great changes! Honestly just need to scrap the dragonstone armor, none of those alternatives look good or old school.
---
Nope
---
It was worse.  Standard should be worse then ancients.  How could anyone possibly think that standard mage should be just as good as ancients? What would be the point of doing Desert Treasure?
---
I can help Whats your wechat
---
Nice.
---
There‚Äôs two in mushroom meadow and two in verdant valley, your birdhouse run should incorporate all four given how close they are to the mushroom teleports.
---
I just use the wiki calc
---
Restart your modem
---
Yea pretty on leaked databases and lists so that wasn't an issue, I've changed all my passwords recently so wouldn't know where it came from, just bad luck ultimately.
---
Needs to be a fully charged one iirc. And you use it on the pedestal looking thing.
---
The pker‚Äôs decides cause they pk you if you go in, why complain even when the warning sign clearly states you can get killed? I‚Äôm not a pker, mainly PvM but even I think all these pvm crybabies need to chill out, go into wildy and you should expect to be killed, if it doesnt happen then woohoo for you.
---
Check how much it cost to make one and sell it after, see if you have more gp than you started with np
---
RIP your perspective levels
---
A) Why do y‚Äôall do so many PvP updates? There are plenty of things y‚Äôall could fix or update before jamming all of this PvP shit down our throats. I never PK, but now I can‚Äôt enjoy the granite maul anymore because some whiny bitches with level 1 defense complained about getting KO‚Äôd too much? That‚Äôs fair to y‚Äôall? 
---
B) Seriously, what is with all the PvP updates? Protect from Magic wont stop Entangle in PvP now? Thanks for YET ANOTHER REASON to not go into the wilderness.
---
C) Seriously, why are you making it easier for PKers to bully people that have to go into the wilderness? People will already camp the teleport spots with teleblock, but now I can‚Äôt even run away after someone attempts to spawn kill me because my prayer is 100% ineffective against their binds? That‚Äôs FAIR??
---
D) Did the community ask for ugly dragonstone armor, or are you guys just doing that yourselves?
---
Bird nests are not tradable, crushed ones are and should show the price
---
That's a good advice. I think I'll hold off on the jewellery box (I already have the fancy), settle for ancient alter, get the small gear pieces like zenytes and, then sell my bank for a big piece when I can! How is vorkath with dhcb compared to blowpipe+bgs?
---
You need to speak to Oziach
---
This is the reason why wildy is dying, shit players like you crying cause you die in a PvP zone where it should be dangerous, and no I‚Äôm not a pker, I PvM but all this fucking crying from PvMers and ironmen is so stupid...
---
Are all wielded ones unequipped from their shaky hands?
---
Mainly divine range potions and divine super combat potions. Divine magic potion isn't profitable.
---
 **Dragonstone Armour** looks gay.
---
I'm honestly not a fan of Dungeoneering in rs3. It should be a minigame not a skill. I'd vote yes to minigame but no to skill.
---
Man, feelsbad when i've gotta now check who i'm *splitting* with if I go pvming in a team...
---
How about just don‚Äôt go in the wildy if you don‚Äôt want to be killed, or does that only apply to pvmers?
---
I've seen more than one late-game player semi maxed wearing that kind of gear when bankstanding just to attention whore eficiently
---
Holy shit i laughed way too hard at this
---
They should totally be voted on, otherwise they‚Äôll eventually just do whatever the fuck they want and call it a quality update
---
And its still worse. Your point was that normals shouldnt be as good as ancients which is still true.
---
Not sure what your problem is? Just admit that you simply dont want to see pkers getting updates. 
---
Justifying spite votes by saying that it devalues dt lmao
---
Is that an anti-sea-bear circle?
---
That Unibrow holy fuck my dude fix that.
---
Attacking someone before giving them a chance to get ready lmao. Aka, trying to PK somebody.
---
Thank you. I know it's "right" to do it this way, but I just get jealous when I see a dhcb or rapier.
---
I had an extra on me and tried that. I saw a table labeled ‚Äústrange machine‚Äù with two indents I believe. Do I need two?
---
You can just comment on his nice performance instead :( I don't normally look for negative comments like yours but when I do, eye browse
---
Thanks fam, that was fun :) 
---
Maybe next time turn it into a web-page with a clickable 'map'. Either using javascript, or a php/node/ruby/perl/etc backend to process clicks :) (img type=sumit). Just if you get bored hehe :)

Pkers don't get to decide, only I get to decide whether I go into the wilderniss.
---
It represents the 4 shopping cart wheels
---
Gratz. Working on finishing Desert Treasure for my first barrows gloves too. Need a few more QPs though.
---
No only need one. Check the wiki page for the digsite pendant
---
Lmao true
---
Exilent client has a plug in

Like seriously why did you wait so long to train slayer, just get the black mask and train it
---
Kill the pures
---
Kill pking
---
Make the wilderness great again
---
GMaul BAD
---
I‚Äôve done the quest, but at 50 cooking, won‚Äôt I just end up burning most of them? Wiki says they don‚Äôt stop burning until level 93 (Hosidius range + cooking gauntlets).
---
I‚Äôd also prefer something that‚Äôs more AFK if possible. Are they still good xp even without 1-ticking? Again, I guess my only concern with them is the burn rate. IDK why it‚Äôs so much higher than other fish when they have such a low cooking requirement. I really don‚Äôt understand cooking, lol.
---
Imagine being called a dickhead because you enjoy a totally normal but different aspect of something.  This guy is a racist IRL confirmed.
---
you have to flip 100k to 100m in a month, but every time you hit 50m you have to give it all to me and start over. hmmm sounds ~~impossible~~I mean, challenging, I hope your not chicken!
---
When it came out on mobile
---
This is just a feature on mobile
---
Water staff, xerics robes and he splashed a tb on ke already before I teled.
---
the fuck you mean last chance? are you threatening a company for not releasing this virgin apparel?
---
The one big issue with moving that to hard is since we now have the Ornate Pool, there are no rewards for the Desert Diary. I have had them done since 2016, and I know KQ lair, noted desert goat horn (easy diary), trade in PP items noted (easy diary) and unlimited Nardah Teles (Elite). I don't even know that the medium has any rewards. 
---
Medium could have the No Desert Damage, and Hard get the Unlimited Nardah Teles, since it becomes dead content if you wait for the elite diaries. KQ staying Elite is fine - it is a huge benefit.
---
Once got crashed at rock crabs by the hcim of Alkan (number1 bass) somewhat like a year ago. He was picking up snape grass and he didn't intend to crash me. I told him not to worry and I just hopped to another world. He was streaming this moment and his chat was surprised I wasn't some salty pure and they wanted to reward me for that. He then went to the GE with his main account (Alkan) and collected items and money from his viewers for me. He added me on his hcim and talked to me for a while. Suddenly he showed up with his maxed main account and gave me like 40m worth of stuff. This including an AGS, Anguish necklace, torture, robin hood hat and some other stuff. 
---
When I later googled the name Alkan, I found his youtube channel and found out who he was.
---
I gave the robin hood hat to the first guy I saw after that to share the luck.
---
lol pussies here actually find it challenging to escape a guy on standards
---
If you don't want to be there long enough to buy an onyx eels are just okay.
---
It didn‚Äôt fail 3 times because it would make the standard spellbook overpowered, it failed 3 times because pvmers didn‚Äôt want to die more often. 
---
Right now the standard spellbook is literally unusable unless you are ridiculously far away from the border, have spellbook swaps, or have a clan with ancients. Maybe it will be overpowered, but let‚Äôs wait and see first before making any crazy assumptions. 
---
Plus, now solo pking will be much more viable, and pvmers are always complaining about getting 20-man teamed.
---
its obvious you dont go to the wildy
---
FETCH ME THEIR SOULS
---
Yes another item that for no apparent reason is banned from pvp
---
starting a sentence with imagine? yikes...
---
Right? Seercull has been dead content for ages.
---
Price is irrelevant. You aren't skulled so you don't risk anything.
---
Comparing it to an ancient staff is also a strange choice. An ancient staff has magic defence, because its a magic staff. The bulwark is a huge chunk of metal. It has good melee/range defence because of this. Arguing that it should have mage defence is like saying the staff should have +250 melee defence.
---
If anything the bulwark should have negative mage def, like pretty much all other heavy melee armours/shields.
---
no, no one fucked chose that
---
lol but really though it is better
---
Yes that's the answer he was looking for
---
B is the least bad, but they all look basically the same.
---
Mod Ash when asked about adding Dungeoneering to OSRS someday;
---
"It's been suggested, but recreating RS3's content on any scale tends to be unfeasible due to the vast number of GFX and animations needing to be remade from scratch. Even Corp took literally weeks despite being 2 NPCs and one projectile; that doesn't scale well to a skill."
---
The Tweet is 2 days old.
---
Actually buying obby cape is better gp/tokkul
---
There's been so many things that feel super weird lately... all the multicolor / fully-unicorn-themed bullshit really needs to end.
---
You don‚Äôt pk lol
---
Alts
---
This is what gets 3.8k ups? lordy.
---
They want to kill bh and pvp and make clans and nh the only pking. The gmaul nerf is the perfect way to kill them
---
This update is legit going to ruin sooo mamy things and make every time of pking more stale. 
---
It will likely cause a mass of people to quit and we dont need to loose any pkers right now.
---
Give me warding instead of this jigglyplex
---
And proud
---
I can see that.. According the cost break down the wiki, if you factor out the onyx you would be making roughly 175k/hr at infernal eels
---
Precisely
---
Right? Why the fuck we need bedazzled armour now?
---
The real problem is that blowpipe is too strong and they refuse to touch it
---
I understand where you are coming from and mostly agree but the g maul did need to be nerfed.  Now we just need more low attack spec weapons.
---
Hilarious to see people realize that poor customer support is a hallmark of almost every MMO now
---
I'm pretty sure you could if the person was running a "legit company".  There was a kid at my college that was caught doing this (he used money to go to vegas to gamble and party and he got sued.  Parents had to pay back all the money he used from investors.
---
I tried to do a rectangle :(
---
When do you sleep man?
---
There's 2 strange machines i think, you want to use it on the one that's more south I'm pretty sure
---
Hmmmm???? I am English therefore I split with Australians?????
---
yes they can say "rush" without looking stupid for saying "R-word"
---
I think the arms look a bit weird.  I feel like the trim color could be integrated better somehow, but I'm not a clothes designer.
---
Can I get it half off for $92?
---
Yeah I didn't plan on getting them all at the same time, I just want to have more gear/money to work with, because I always end up spending it on 'non-refundable' stuff. I'll work towards the dhcb for now I think, but it's a solid 50 hours of intense money making away.
---
yeah i cant stop laughing
---
im 12 and everything is cringy

Are all runelite plug ins already included in their base client and you just need to turn them on or do they have more plug ins available that you need to install? I mean specifically from runelite.
---
&gt; how many times have you heard someone tell A FUCKING NOOB MOBILE PLAYER to ‚Äújust look it up noob I can‚Äôt waste my time with explaining something simple‚Äù
---
I disagree with you on this one. I get enough "sorry on mobile" bullshit excuses here on reddit alone. Seeing it seep into OSRS actually in-game is stomach turning. It's not hard in 2019 to look something up real quick.
---
By main weapon I meant an ags or d claws which only use 50% allowing you to regain 10% giving you 60 don't know why folk are down voting a fucking question
---
It's what OSRS players crave.
---
please don't use entity hider
---
Seeing as thats a sizeable collection you could easily sell them for more than 4ea to a collector
---
Jagex give me the rights and ill do it and split you decent profits. I have the connectiona to meet the demand that these virgins would offer.
---

---
Twisted analysis of the gathered data. It was thematically and loot wise making sense to give GG a new drive to do it, since currently its nothing else but a nuisance to do even on task.

---
you can literally avoid death 9 times out of 10 if  you hover over the log out button from the moment you tele into the wild, plus nobody is forcing you to do the new wilderness content..
---
everything else in the game is getting updates, the wildy should too
---
Does it actually work? I'd rather not but if it's my only option...
---
No, I don't value other OSRS players who think they can take the easy way out and make bank for nothing. Whenever one of these creatures gets cleaned and quits, it can **ONLY** be a net positive for the greater community.
---
Hey it took me about 3500 kills as well on my ironman! I've gotten like 7 masks in the next 1000 kills though...

You can still dds to gmaul 1 tick. But only really decent on pures because chances are it won‚Äôt hit and your blowing you spec
---
Nah he's eating the caviar from cutting the fish and eating it to clear inventory space as opposed to dropping it. This works because the caviar are a byproduct of the activity he's doing meaning as long as he's fishing he'll keep getting caviar. You can't use the potions for this because you'll run out of doses like 50 fish in.
---
Will the first one you order come untrimmed?
---
Exactly (might need to bring her the seed to get the new bow I forget).  I merched the seeds from 17 to 24k, I thought I was smart until I looked at the price recently.  Also they were removed from Zulrah's drop table
---
I need this.
---
New welcome screen is really terrible and gives me RS3 vibes.
---
People really out here bent out of shape about ads on a screen they spend 1.3 seconds on once a day
---
yeah i don't think the new content was a great idea, but the wildy is still dead so it hasn't changed much
---
i think the best solutions is things like the chaos altar.. you get a more efficient/inexpensive training method but it comes with a risk
---
adding clue steps and slayer tasks for the sole purpose of luring pvmers out is a little fucked lmao
---
Blizz CS is great.
---
Ahh yes - the famous Construction(p++) skill

no troll it looks better than the tryhard 50 million shades of blue monstrosities they're offering us

Honestly if I were him would just max first, and get BiS gear before trying again.

Depending the actual layout of your stats and what else you have at your disposal. But if you got Ds2 done you could get just a bit more cash, buy a dragon Hunter crossbow and just smash vorkath a bunch and make that money back relatively fast.

I always tell people, learn from the chart, then use the plugin and once youve got it down go no plugin. Zulrah plugins are 100% safe, and the banable stuff was misinformation still lingering from ages ago.
---
Yea theres quite a market for it. I was buying seeds at 1gp each for a while and sold them to a collector for 15gp each. And that was seen as a steal from him. Turned 3m into 45m
---
New mauls look neato but that was a gigantic missed opportunity to spice up grotesque guardians. Seriously it was right there on a silver platter and the team chucked it out the window.
---
Dinh's nerf doesn't make a lot of sense to me considering how even without it players can become brick walls to range and melee while magic will still blow clean through; I was opposed to plan A but this is worse. Seriously, can barely break 140 mage def 3 iteming with hides now.
---
When a stack is too big on mobile - usually from barraging - you can't hold tap to pick up the loot. Best you can do is turn off attack options and tap the pile
---
When in the recent past has jagex given us more services or support as a result of increased profit, why would this be any different?
---
When mtx began? When we hit and maintained over 100k online? The closest thing was 'trading' mtx in osrs (bonds) for ftp but that was a made up pretense with supposed predictions on a graph with no scale that ended up being completely wrong, just to force mtx on us in order to get something we wanted.
---
Dress up like cap'n Izzy and scamming noobs 200 gp to access Brimhaven Agility Course huh? Yes!
---
Yes please. This would make up for the (in my opinion, compared to other capes) rather weak skillcape perk.
---
How did you lose pmod?
---
Ancestral is +35, bigger stat reqs (75's), yet only +35 magic bonus and costs about 5,000x as much.
---
Ok.
---
Stat reqs don't really factor into balancing here. Availability is. People complained about thevstat reqs of a TBow, but raising it's req to 99 range doesn't change its balance at all.
---
Can you even do sote with less than 50 agil
---
Fishing lv?
---
So the update simultaneously made dinhs "not insane vs mage" but also made "practically no difference"? If it made nearly no difference by going to 0 def than clearly it wasn't very strong vs mage
---
I am by no means an expert having only opened around 50 chests myself.
---
I only use prayer for Ahrim, Dharok and Karil.  Torag and Guthans hardly hit, and Verac hits through prayer anyway.

You may want to use your strongest melee armour, as the brother‚Äôs magic level is so low that you‚Äôll rarely splash on them.  Most people seem to use Iban‚Äôs Blast, but I found that Slayer Dart worked perfectly well.

Do what /u/no_thats_taken said but also have your character's name on the hoodie.  That way it's more personal and less valuable to anyone else.

And also less valuable to anyone who doesn't want the world to know they play Runescape.  But fuck that noise all in or all out!

I don't mind it as it just shows off the latest big update. No sponsorship, MTX, etc.

I agree with you there needs to be more support. The players shouldn't have to go to Twitter begging and pleading for help. My point is the ads aren't the end of the world, power creep or even an update to the game. We the players need to pick our battles because let's be real we aren't going to win everyone. There will be more and more "integrity" updates.
---
And I hope my posts aren't coming off as me trying to be an asshole to you. I'm legit just trying to understand. I just want Jagex and the game to grow. I want to see record number of players online

Defense and Quest looking stylish TBH

Death mechanics are fine.

I'd rather PVM in good gear and be alright if I DC, rather than risk black dhide because someone might DDOS the server.

Bob is black. Thus, he can‚Äôt be a racist

You mean the strongest spec weapon in the game isn‚Äôt the price of a rune 2h anymore??? Wow game ruined pking is dead
---
Defense and Quest cape
---
I would cop the defense one so quick
---
I don't care about people dying in the wildy, I'm just concerned that polls are becoming a formality and Jmods will do as they please.

I agree, I also think there should be a button that sets the ‚Äúquantity to buy‚Äù at the ge limit of the item.

It was an accident I swear

Ggs aren‚Äôt even that bad of gp/hr, it not great but it‚Äôs not terrible. People don‚Äôt like to kill it because of the poor fight design. You spend half the time killing it sitting there watching phase transition animations.

As someone who just grinded to 86 cons (because I didn't feel like fucking with spicy stews with 83), I would much prefer to train agility more than do cons. Agility is mindless clicking that I can easily semi-afk with youtube or netflix. Construction requires my constant attention and I hate training it.
---
That said, I'll probably grind out money for 99 soon just to have it over with.

Honestly chillis video's have been absolutely insane as of late, the effort and quality he puts into his videos is remarkable, praise the man and give him subscriptions.
---
Oh no!!!! One very small part of the content was purple. Even though  99.9 percent of the quest was blue, white, green, brown, white.... But NO! One part was purple. So fuck purple. Let's get rid of blue too then, there is too much of it.

Fuck you Jagex!

I have a question about Wintertodt mechanics. In a solo game, can you still be hit with wintertodt's 3x3 blizzard attack if you stand in the corner of a brazier and a wall? I'm not talking about when you are running to said location. Let's say you've been standing there for a couple minutes already.
---
Please do not quote the wiki, i need to know from someone who's personally experienced it several times. Video proof would solidify you as the greatest WT player of all time (in my mind). Thanks!
---
Damn i thought 1100kc was bad
---
Nice
---
You just said it yourself. If you safe spot. If you're safe spotting you're not in combat.
---
Death mechanics are the least OldSchool thing about OSRS. There is nothing fun about being able to PvM risk free. If you can‚Äôt kill a boss without dying maybe you shouldn‚Äôt kill hay boss until you have better stats or a better understanding of it. 
---
I have NEVER DCed due to a server DDOS. It‚Äôs a boogeyman that bad PvMers use as an excuse to have risk free money makers.
---
Just shut the fuck up edge lord.  No one thinks this edgy antisocial attitude is cool. It‚Äôs the way a child thinks.

---
They're all wearable outside. Video game merch is pretty mainstream, and it's not like OSRS is some obscure indie game. Wearing a RuneScape hoodie isn't going to turn you into some socially inept brainlet, so as long as you're a normal person and aren't embarrassed by the fact that you play a video game in 2019 you can pull it off reasonably well.
---
I doubt anybody who didn't play rs in the golden years would want to play it now, it's much too grindy. People want instant gratification nowadays, and the modern gaming landscape is just that.
---
I believe the day record is also refered to as the 30hr record for that reason yes. I wouldn't know how it works or whatever though
---
Omg plz
---
Defense is good too
---
I work in qa and this is exactly right.  The common theme in the IT world is called "continuous deployment", which basically ends up being frequent updates with the expectation that bugs will happen.  I have to admit I would rather have more frequent updates and a couple bugs than slower updates and fewer bugs.
---
Such a stupid reply lmfao, it's not about whether or not the spell book needed a buff.  It's about the fact that these changes were voted no to, but yet still made it into the game.  It's a worrying trend.
---
I love this game and I love the mods embracing the memes
---
Lol @ everyone saying REEE RS3 design. I just saw the rs3 dragonstone armour and... Oh mah gawd, it's like 100x uglier than this. The only thing they should is reworkd the stones to look smaller
---
Ya I just wanted to make it overly simple for people. also didn't even want to go into the fact that fire surge for it to be even half way decent requires you to have a tome/smoke bstaff/occult combo already.
---
Make it so it is heard all around runescape at max volume
---

---
Fire Strike with a staff of fire
---
Soo RCB and full black d hide has lower range attack bonus than full rune armor has range defense, which is 30 tiers lower. While ancient staff and full mystic has more magic attack than full rune has mage defense. Sounds like the triangle is working to me?
---
It's stupid to compare only DPS. Range has high consistent DPS because it's generally lacking in special attacks (compared to melee) or utility (compared to mage). You're ignoring that without switches mage generally wins against range due to the utility of freezes and outranging the ranger. All three combat styles have their niche in the wilderness.
---
Don't come to falador\*

Yes, that was the overwhelming feedback last time I posted it.

Would you say this if they raised memb prices to $22?
---
What about the crystal tree? or the new smithing area closest to a bank? Or the new bis skilling tools? or the best magic defence in game on the helmet? There‚Äôs a lot more good content locked behind song of the elves than there is with any other quest

The giant box that's as large as three boxes is too much of a contrast with the rest of the information below. While it is understandable that people should know about new updates, at a glance this new system is incredibly distracting.
---
While on it's own it isn't horrible it reminds me of Runescape 3's login in that it shows what they want you to see and the rest of the information that may actually be important to your account (such as messages from Jagex and days of membership left) are basically relegated to seem significantly less important, sorta like the ingredients on the back of processed food containers.
---
Likewise, I doubt people would appreciate advertisements for special offers being so large. Runescape 3 has the problem where 80% of the time the Login Screen shows MTX promotions for when you log in to the actual game world.
---
I would suggest at most making the new box no larger than the other boxes, keeping the 4 box structure and, if this is a replacement for the scroll at the bottom, adding account security tips and some trivia facts there instead.
---
Please fix Liliwen (the Lletya farmer) too, she looks terrible now :(
---
Virgin alert
---
I'm not against the idea,  I'm 100% for it because it thematically makes sense for the slayer boss of the npc that drops the weapon in the first place should drop the upgrade item.
---
No one wants big ass ads on the page fam. Players who care know about the new content.
---
curious as to what you think the ratio of successful to failed pks was before the change and what you think it is now.
---
Even people like Amenity, one of the best pkers in the game, basically never kill anyone at chins if they have a bulwark and hides. Realistically, this change probably increases the chance of someone like him successfully killing someone with dinhs from like 5% to 8%, with every single one of those deaths being avoidable if the "victim" pray switched better.
---

If you solo to 1k are you actually barely dry or sahara dry
---
You should've ended up in Jail like that other guy lol
---
having one item have amazing defense  for all three combat styles is just objectively bad design. If you want all-around defense, you should need to pick and choose different pieces of gear to cover the spectrum, not just equip one item and be super tanky. 
---
You've got all of the remaining equimpent slots to make up for the lack of mage defense, as it should be. This is definitely one of their better integrity changes
---
Also this change doesn't remove the niche. You're still super resistant to melee specs and getting bolted down, everyone at chaos temple and chins are still going to be using it
---
yeah ew &gt;.&gt;
---
Herbalore might get some attention from local law enforcement too
---
Paying membership for features in the game and looking at an ad for one second while logging in are completely different. And would I still be a member for $22 a month? Absolutely
---
I think you're getting confused about what is expected and what the probability actually means. In your coin example, the next flip can still be heads and so could every flip after that. Each flip has a 50% chance. You'd expect your results to mimic the 50/50 split but it isn't guaranteed because each flip does not affect the next. It's just as likely to get all tails for trillions of flips as it is to get all heads for trillions of flips.

Hmm that maul attachment seems like something that would be nice on, I don't know, the cancer that is the marble gargoyles.
---
Why have votes at all then? Make every patch an integrity change if you want to say you will never convince PvM to vote yes on a PvP poll.
---
Or you can actually take the time to create a good update. PvP armor was a few % off of passing wasn't it? Did the project just get abandoned?
---
If you have the same style as them (melee on melee, range on range), you can spam click them to get off a quick attack when they attack you during a walk under.

You're saying that a bow which consistently fires 2 arrows that can hit probably around 30-35 DMG each hit TWICE, WITHOUT using the spec while wearing the armor should be allowed in PvP when the BiS DMG is like already 70+ with a balista firing TWICE AS SLOW as this suggested weapon? Are you high?

Wrong thread. This is for help, not suggestions.

This so stupid. Why did Jmod do this?
---
Not at all comparing fucker did you even see what you wrote? "Ancient vs normal spell book **comparison**:"
---
You even proceed to include the damage thats how hard you're comparing.
---
You can hit them.  You just need more practice.  
---
To be specific, in order to guarantee a barrage you have to cast barrage on them once per game tick.  If you want to range or melee then you just have to spam click them.  The animation mechanics are a bit weird, so don't try to hit them going by the animation.  Count internally, mage and range are 3 second cycles (3.6 for ballista and morrigan javelins), melee is 2.4-3.6 seconds depending on the weapon
---
With rcb?. Any low risk gear recommends. 70 Def

Yea, I'm not sure what #14 means
---
Black d'hide is a 40 defense armor.

The chaps are a 1 defense armor.
---
The accuracy of black d'hide makes sense for a 70 ranged armor but the defenses do not make sense for a 40 defense armor.

Maybe instead of asking dumb questions go look him up? Takes two seconds lol. Hes a famous producer

Yeah...a veiny...bicep.

Because they poll the whole community. They realized PvPers were unhappy and the meta was stale. I've never PvP'd besides being skull tricked, but this is something for the PvP community to figure out

I know it can be very situational but just curious because I'm just learning to pk again on lms.

I'm Irish American as well. My friend group was kinda "one of everything" in terms of races, so racial jokes were our go-to jokes.

the zombie lumberjacks in temple trekking drop the lumberjack outfit. abyssal leaches drop essence pouches. I know these aren't really what you're looking for since they're kind of one and done drops. Brine rats are level 70 but they drop the 150k brine saber.

Bro what fucking year was this? Those last comments are like what edgy kids say today.
---
I'm super glad they didn't. We as a community want the granite maul deleted. If they gave it to the bosses the nerf would have changed absolutely nothing.
---
They didn‚Äôt want more pvp content locked behind pvm. Most good gear comes from boss drops or monster drops.

Who cares why it failed. It didn't pass the polls multiple times and now it's in the game. Fuck that.

Making money is rash?
---
How so? They've been doing this for years... I don't think as many would say it was a "dangerous precedent" when they fixed the D Spear specs so you couldn't stun-lock players or nerfed AFK Training (though that was a survey, not a proper poll). So just because this is something you personally disagree with doesn't mean it is suddenly a dangerous precedent; either it always has been or it still isn't.
---
You do lmao
---
It's like 1m/hr + dust which isn't bad for a pretty easy boss with only 75 slayer req.
---
Average kill time is 3 mins or lower which isn't too different from other bosses like sire or even zulrah with suboptimal stats and gear. If regular gargoyles were actually balanced (300-400k/hr instead of 800k+), grotesque guardians wouldn't seem so bad because they *would* be better for gp than normal gargoyles.
---
Of course, I wouldn't be opposed to making the boss weaker so it's more accessible for lower/med level players or reducing the length of the animations between each phase but I definitely don't think the drops were so bad that it needed another big ticket unique.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad really. And it is kind of the original purpose of a meme.

But if you are maxed what would it cost?

Well, you're not supposed to do risky and intense activities on a phone, so this is the punishment that jagex is serving. I don't see a reason to  waste time and change it
---
Yah, I found that a bit funny. "Doesn't Deal damage" *shows an image of spell dealing damage*
---
But I think they meant it as doesn't deal considerable damage like how Ice Barrage can hit 30+.

That type of traetment could've led to "noobs" becoming stigmatized, if it was executed better with tongue-in-cheek and less hostility.
---
Do you know what quotation marks mean? 
---
The fact that you quit in the face of what I can only call ‚Äúmild‚Äú criticism says a lot about you.
---
Torille?
---
Chinning isn‚Äôt risky though? And it‚Äôs certainly not an intensive activity. 
---
It‚Äôs actually one of the most boring activities I‚Äôve done in this game up there with wintertodt. 
---
It requires so little attention that you should be able to afk it, but the nature of the activity means you don‚Äôt afk it at all.
---
I‚Äôm unclear as to why playing on phone or iPad needs intentional punishments for no reason other than I prefer to play mobile over computer.

It‚Äôs a very large banner displaying well-detailed art. The welcome screen has historically always been minimalistic, with nothing more than some security details, membership and a brief explanation of recent updates with a couple of characteristically low-poly images of in-game items related to the update. 
---
Rs3 features a similar kind of banner with similar artwork in nearly every user interface screen in many of the options settings.
---
Yep, engine work. The vanilla client and mobile client don't have the tools to easily condense the item list.
---
the 3x3 attack will not happen if you are directly next to a wall or the brazier
---
Crystal items do no longer lose their stats when degrading so there is no need for imbues, since imbue was only to keep maximum stats while weapon degraded.
---
The feedback  would rightfully consist of "don't implement this design, don't spend devtime on unnecessary updates, and don't work on this type of proposal whatsover". That's enough.
---
This really sucks for me because I have an alt that pays for its own bonds by picking up all the fish at barbarian outpost and banking them all day

Unpopular opinion: Jagex did the right thing.  The PvM community will shit on PvP updates until this game is in the ground.  The right thing to do is ignore people who don‚Äôt even use the content
---
Fun fact: People downvoting don't actually have an argument against why the blowpipe should be nerfed.
---
I did it at combat 94, so I don't know about the feels man haha. You don't have to stress, follow a guide if you have to. I failed multiple times. You'll get there eventually if you do mess up.
---
Thanks! :D
---
I do t get it is the top part made by you and the part in red circled what you want it to be?? Ie it should be the same speed as magic shortbow on rapid? My personal opinion would be to lower the ranged strength of the initial blowpipe that's stacks with what darts you use, and leave the speed the same.
---
I'll probably put off Monkey Madness 2 for another 12 years hahaha

Are you ESL dude because I have no idea what you're trying to ask in the first part.

I haven't been member for most of the 12 years, and there has been a time where I didn't play anymore. At the same time, there was never a need for it.
---
It honestly doesn't look proportionate at all, and the colours don't look good whatsoever imo. Don't know how it could be made better though. I feel like the concept was doomed from the start.
---
I can feel the power of the Dragon Scim flow through me
---
If the number of people PKing was exactly 0 then the game still wouldn't be "in the ground"
---
PvMers outnumber PKers by a huge magin and their influence on game changes should be reflected appropriately
---
torags are better although they require extra gp to be fixed, in the end u will be saving food compared to dragon but they do have to pay to repair them when damaged
---
Disagree
---
What? No. Jagex doesn‚Äôt get paid enough to deal with these minor issues.
---
Thank you Bwana, very cool!
---
What do I need to learn from this essentially OP??
---
protip bois get the HTTPS Everywhere browser extension.. i have it for chrome but im sure firefox and other browsers have an equivalent
---
Hm. That makes sense, as when I googled the app on phone rather than going straight to app store, it showed 60k reviews, but when i tapped on it, it redirected me to the one in app store with 103 reviews. But I just looked at the reviews and they're all english, and they don't seem to be the same model either. I think I'll just add auth again from scratch and try again.
---
I‚Äôm at work, so sorry for the late reply.
---
Afaik it is almost always best to use Magic against the Barrows brothers because of their low Magic defence.  Your Magic level should be absolutely fine. 
---
Using Range will result in a longer kills which will mean using more prayer pots.  You can use Range or Melee in the tunnels against the monsters there to get your loot percentage score up. 
---
I‚Äôd at least give Magic a try.

.... wut buffs?

You have my vote

Warding added as an integrity change when?

I feel mixed when someone makes such a suggestion for Agility cape which gets Jmod's approval while I am currently working towards 99 Agility.

Am I the only one that sees the Etangle change as a buff for PvMers? It decreases the need to pk in a team and enforces people to solo PK. As someone who only enters the Wilderness for Clues and Bosses, I think this change helps me and others like me.
---
Gmaul was OP. Calling everyone who disagrees with you a ‚Äúsnowflake pker‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change the facts.
---
Also just because something hasn‚Äôt been changed in years doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt be fixed if possible.

The short answer is yes.

I mean I can see how both thinking it‚Äôd be as fast as msb or faster would make sense from the way it‚Äôs written.

However for the sake of variety it might need to be nerfed.

The blowpipe doesn't need to be made worse if we just make all the good content appropriately harder. The entire game doesn't need to be retrofitted for a weakened blowpipe, that's insane.

I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to call hypocrisy on a non-existent reaction to a situation you've imagined in your head.
---
There is a subsection of the group where players that continued benefited from said updates more then they lost from it. This could be changes from the runecrafting, or people whogenerally they just enjoyed it. Point being is I was accounting for why OSRS players dislike the game, rather then why RS3 players enjoy it, it is its own game in its own right.
---
It's all subjective to be honest. The view that I was sharing was from osrs players, and why personally they never suggest runescape 3, even though it is in the same family. To a new user, you would not even notice these changes, and would infact think its a great game without the history of what happened, and what was once was.

I would absolutely buy at least a few

Nah you'll get tired of it eventually. It's a quality game and it's a great pass time, especially when you're struggling irl. I almost maxed in the end and was just content with how far I got. For me you just hit a roof where it's like, I'm close to doing everything I could on the account, but that last 1/2% will take just as long as the 98% you've already done, whether it's just max, or pet hunting, achievements etc. I think if you quit in that moment you're quit for good

A youtuber named Internet Historian followed through with one of those as a joke using a dummy credit card, it is a game, but its...... very badly put together. Usually just still images with text, bad grammar, and surprise incest
---
How did i take their items? there was a lots of methods, jagex kept patching the symptoms and not the problem so theyd kill our method instead of killing the reason it was possible. The gist of it was youd stall damage to hit them after they left the house. It all ended when they reset stats when you get kicked. There were several teams doing it mine alone probably scooped 1-2b back when a phat was 100-200m, i was never on for the big scores but i was also the only one that wasnt RWT'ing their loot.

---
The proof is literally in the picture I posted.  Just because Woox knew doesn't mean every person who voted knew.  Those were all voted in after we already had the pipe. The strength of the ranged weapons had to be stronger if they wanted to be better than the blowpipe.  Scythe was kinda hard to gauge the power of because the weird way it works.  Not that it's particularly OP or anything.  Lance/Cbow are just niche weapons really good at dragons.  Blowpipe is still used over the crossbow at Hydra.  None of these weapons are anywhere as cheap and as accessible as the blowpipe is.  This tends to happen when you don't put them on a boss so accessible defense pures can farm it.
---
LOL holy shit it is, nice catch

ardougne cloak 3 has a higher prayer bonus than any trimmed skillcape and as a bonus requires engaging with actual game content beyond clicking bows or wintertodt for 50 hours. it also has offensive bonuses! if you're too low total for ardy cloak 3 because you spent your time getting useless 99 skills, don't worry; ardougne cloak 2 has +4 prayer, which is equal to trimmed skillcapes, and has offensive bonuses which skillcapes lack.

Truuuueeeee, kill first form to half, kill his two dogs, then get him down to second form. On second form half two more dogs before you can kill him fully. On top of that it‚Äôs 35-40 wilderness and right near some hot pk spots. So you get pkd a lot which makes it slow and frustrating.

---
The normal spellbook is super weak, besides the decreased amount of slots that you have to have on you (you need an approximate of 6 runes spaces) for tb/entangle/fire surge. You also need to risk more. You have to wear a tome of fire, and a rune pouch if you want to lessen the amount of rune slots on you (from 6 to 4). 
---
Entangles 1-2 dmg is neglible. And the max amount of root with mage pray is 7 seconds which is shit all. Overall, having the normal spellbook is a big nerf to the pker. He has a lot less food, a lot less dmg and even less time to do dmg when your root has 7 seconds.
---
So what's the end result? Well because solo pking with tb was so bad. You would usually bring a tber/ancient pker with you. And when you bring 2 people, might as well bring 2 more or so. ( that always happened with my buddies and me)
---
Now solo pking is way more viable. And solo pking is something that pvmers would also like way more. Am i wrong?

Yes there is, as they will quite literally use their items. You bring max gear to vorkath because you can't lose it. You don't bring max gear to the wilderness because you can lose it
---
Maybe try answering a valid question tho instead
---
what if i told u that u dont have to wear the armor if u dont like it, just dont buy it, dont use it
---
Remember how rune was originally purple? Why can‚Äôt dragonstone armor be like that? Just make it purple rune armor, kind of like that purple shadow armor but not transparent and maybe give it a black trim or something for aesthetic.

A long time ago in RS2/RSHD, I sold my bank to buy a santa hat for something like 16-18m.

It's a meme on the 07scape subreddit, based on a series of videos utilizing the music video for "Crab Rave" by Noisestorm.

Mostly they make fun of issues that the player base has with Jagex. Usually they revolve around a lack of authenticator delay, $11/month membership (because it used to be less), Jagex being powerless against a PvP clan, and just about any other mishaps. They aren't always the same but those are the common ones.

I recently got full elite void and it's honestly so much faster. I used to use full melee gear with trident and would get 10-12 minute chests, now I use elite void with a mage to range switch and I get 5 minute chests. Results will definitely vary, I am using a blowpipe which definitely makes Ahrim a lot faster.
---
Is ACB worth buying?

It does, and even better it preserves your settings and drops if you play on more than one computer
---
Just wait about an hour before you log in again on your IP address. I would also change your PW just in case, cause you never know.
---
Because they're already making record profits. They made more money last year than any other year theyve existed. They dont need to make more money per customer or risk closing down, that money isnt going to provide support or account security its lining the pocket of some investor.
---
Why are you eager to see ads, even for a second, not to get any new content but just to further line the pocket of some distant shareholder whos already making great money off you.
---
Too much shit passes already. Personally I would prefer more stuff failed. As you mentioned players always vote in their own interest, that's why every single easy scape update passes.
---
been more than an hour
---
To add to this, even if you don't think the changes were needed, you have to acknowledge that *if they were* they still wouldn't sniff 60%.
---
Most collectors have been playing a long time and have nothing else to spend money on. When you reach endgame content making money is a lot easier

I think hes getting at the fact that the original comment already answered the question you asked.

Nah something could fit the aesthetic and gameplay of OSRS but not have it‚Äôs spirit. 
---
Like imagine if a questline was released with Kung fu as a focus. It could look like OSRS, play like OSRS, but it‚Äôs content would not be in the spirit of OSRS. Because something like Kung fu doesn‚Äôt fit thematically in universe. Of course if it was done as a joke it might work, but I‚Äôm talking about if it was a serious questline about Kung fu.

I‚Äôm a different person btw

People in ancestral should literally be able to freeze me, they usually could once. Not more. I usually didn't even need to do anything to eat more as an anglerfish. Idk why you're now talking about being able to heal 59 hp every few ticks, that argument would only be more in favour of a bigger dinh nerf.

Also, if I want to go too 2.2k total world, let me be lol. I doubt you know how dead 2.2k total world is besides revs, maybe you're the one without the experience there.

Red chins, black chins, gargoyles. Otherwise, high combat for pvm and quests for vorkath. Rc is another big one for like 1m/hr with bloods assuming you have the high level shortcut. Ourania altar still makes good money until 77 rc. 
---
Think about it like this: do skills people don't like doing, and gather or craft resources that will always be undersupplied and overdemanded.

Well that way you won't have to make a new acc to stay low stats, I don't get it

Inventory space doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre fighting pvmers

Most of osrs is already single player, I don't think we should be removing elements of the game that make it an actual MMO. There are people who do enjoy that type of content. There is no core game progression locked behind pvp in osrs. You don't have to fight anyone to get an MA2 cape, you just have to avoid being killed for the 10-15 minutes you spend in the wilderness it takes to get the cape once per account. Personally I wouldn't call that mandatory pvp engagement. 
---
Serious question: If they removed player vs. player in the wilderness but added npc's that could at any time spawn and attack you in the wilderness and kill you the same a player would. They would use the same tools a player would. Teleblock, snare, clans etc. How does it being an actual player attacking you over an NPC attacking you change it from "chaotic game element" to "mandatory pvp engagement" in your eyes? What's the difference between running away from a player and running away from an NPC?
---
I have two near maxed rs3 accounts and two 1800s osrs :p I like both games. 
---
Leveled both at the same time.
---
It's the best but that doesn't make it good
---
The super majority vote required for updates to pass limits the variety of content down to what the majority of people benefit from. Minority groups such pvpers don't have any influence on game changes normally. Their influence on the game isn't reflected appropriately, it's not reflected at all. That's essentially why Jagex started doing integrity changes for pvp content.
---
Nah, the new version is peak FashionScape since we have no access to walking sticks.

do you all understand how RNG really works? i remember when i was watching some ironman series on youtube i heard a lot of ‚Äúoh i should have gotten it TWICE by now‚Äù etc when comparing kc to drop rate.
---
no you shouldn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs not how any this works. forget statistics since statistics are complete bull shit in real life and completely meaningless and serve no other purpose other than to be used in arguments when you are out of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù things to say.  in layman terms each time you kill it the computer tries rolling a random number between 0 and 512. each kill the number it needs to roll is different. forget ‚Äúaverage‚Äù here and your kc, and think of every kill as ‚Äúi just rolled something that wasn‚Äôt the specific number needed out of the 512 numbers.‚Äù even 3k kc isn‚Äôt enough for something which has this bad chances. repeating this action infinite times gives you the real 1/512 odds but you aren‚Äôt doing it anywhere close this
---
there‚Äôs no difference between 100 different people not getting it in 511 kills or you not getting it in 51,1k kills since you all are rolling 1 to 512 every time you kill it
---
What exactly is wrong in their response?  Telling them to delete the personal information they posted?  Or telling them the account had already been appealed and failed?  I see nothing wrong with it as the appeal was already screened by a CS employee higher up.  Ever the ex lead dev of OSRS for nearly it's entire lifespan said since you can't read "What generally happens is that when someone appeals an offence, who was in control of the account at the time of the offence is looked at. It doesn't matter whether it is the real person or a bot that appeals the offence, the same things are looked at."  The twitter CS doesn't have to suck his dick and do anything more CS already did it's job by running the appeal and proving the ban was correct you moron moon monkey.
---
Omg Harry Potter!!!
---
sure, but then comparing something like addy plates to blast furnace is moot, because you won't have time to sit and focus on blast furnace.
---
addy plates are more afk, and faster
---
your most afk option is dart tips, but xp is slower. there is often little/no cost doing dart tips since they're used for high-level fletching.
---
Yes, and someone with that gear isn't getting any kills. 0 profit for 20k risk. Throw your TBs around as much as you want in salad robes.
---
u/jagexgambit pls answer this, I see this get asked all the time and I think its a brilliant idea, it would solve the gmaul issue and grotesque guardians issue in one move. I would totally rather do this than nerf the strength of the boss itself. However I never saw it officially get acknowledged by jmods in any of the blogs y'all put out so it never felt like it was even an option. What was yalls reasoning for this? Is it too late to change it?
---
Not a pug brainlet
---
Aren‚Äôt the more expensive options (like the DHCB and TBow) already better than the blowpipe in a myriad of places? 
---
TBow is meta for tons of bossing, due to the way it calculates based on mage defense, correct? I know people bring blowpipe alongside it sometimes, but that‚Äôs just for the spec. 
---
DHCB is better than the blowpipe on all things dragon, as it should be. Also just easier to use a DHL instead of bringing a blowpipe to anything that can be melee‚Äôd. 
---
Only weapon I can think of that this applies to, as far as I‚Äôm aware, is the Armadyl crossbow, but even that has its place. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be too argumentative, just trying to understand the place you‚Äôre coming from.
---
first day of standing class
---
Im having this aswell
---
But I don't see what the actual argument is. Should standards be just as good at snaring as ancients? Better? Worse? How much better/worse?
---
Knowing that the only 4 spells ancients has are stun, heal self (not useful in wild,) poison (not useful in wild,) and reduce enemy attack (not useful in wild,) but standards has stun, teleblock, reduce stats (not useful in wild,) and fire spells which can be boosted 50% with tome of fire.
---
Should each spellbook have different intended uses or should they all be the same thing? It kind of seems like you're arguing that standard should be as good at stunning as ancients, despite that being the only useful thing ancients can do.
---
I think a better change would be to make the elemental magic better on standards, since standards require a ~500k item and extra inventory slots (mud, nature runes) to match the damage and utility of ancients.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted for not getting the reference. There's an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia where they make a flyer that's supposed to be a bicep, but it ends up looking like a dick.
---
Zzzzzzzzzzzz.
---
Fuckin-A, dude. You‚Äôve explained this more clearly than anyone I‚Äôve seen on the subreddit. 
---
Anti-PvP bias is completely justified in a game where the PvP mechanics are expressly *designed* to elicit that friction. ‚ÄúPlayer killing‚Äù is inherently antagonistic, Duel Arena/LMS/BH are not. To someone who personally hates PvP, the former absolutely makes for an appreciably worse experience. 
---
When you get down to it, *the Wilderness should not exist as it does*. The only counter arguments to this assume that it would just be wholesale plucked out of the game one day, in which case Wilderness rewards would be way out of tune balance wise. And they are right, which is why if such a change were to happen all Wildy content could/would be appropriately rebalanced, or new dangers and hazards introduced to keep the content similarly challenging. There are ways around it. 
---
The bottom line is that the anti-PvP poll bias is a natural reaction to the design of the game. It‚Äôs not the spite of the ‚Äòbrainlet PvMers‚Äô that makes them vote no, it‚Äôs the forced- pvp portion of the game truly and earnestly being a poor experience for those players. 
---
And before anybody says it, Wilderness content is not truly optional. There should be *no* content that is for strictly for PVMers yet involves PVP (Wildy bosses/Slayer, for example) or vice-versa.
---
Wow. They must have hated you, but I suppose that's still fair game. Should have rounded up 10 people after the update so you could still keep doing it.

Only because they had to be made stronger than the blowpipe.  These items are also expensive and far less accessible.  If Blowpipe is nerfed they should probably be adjusted to bring ranged power down as a whole.
---
Only if the last one says "k thx bye"
---
1 hour of usage costs around 370k when running the typical addy dart setup. 
---
It isn‚Äôt outrageous but it ain‚Äôt cheap. Adds up real fast when going for range/slayer levels.
---
I don't think they should be banned outright. But I do agree that those kinda alt usages is a bit against the spirit of the game. But I also don't really care because it doesn't affect my game and everyone is capable of doing it..it's not like an ironman got 200m slay ONLY because he had an alt with a tbow doing all the damage.
---
arma skirt plus dfire shield is reasonable more risk but ok. I am a bit tired to discuss in loops and rather focus on something else. You don't provide anything useful so I will not responding anymore. Have a nice day.

they can add things while keeping the nostalgic feel
---
So do a find-replace using ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù instead, I still stand by my point.
---
Furthermore, in case this is the road anyone wants to head down, no, of course my statements don‚Äôt apply to *all* Republicans or *all* PVPers. This is where the vague nature of these groups that you mentioned comes into play. There‚Äôs considerable ‚Äòfogginess‚Äô on an individual‚Äôs level, but *overall* you can still make certain assumptions about a population. 
---
For example, soccer fans are a vague group of people with broadly varying characteristics, and it‚Äôs true that you can‚Äôt make an assumption about *all soccer fans*. But if I said ‚ÄòSoccer fans would be sad if Cristiano Ronaldo was shot dead tonight‚Äô, and I‚Äôd be right. Maybe not every soccer fan, but *generally* this is likely true. 
---
Same thing with Republicans and a blocked Nominee.

Same thing with PVPers and and PVM changes.

IM and mostly PvMer here who also happens to have a ton of wildy content completed... This is a great change from Jagex. This make the default spellbook a lot better and as a result will make PvP a lot more varied since freezes will not be as necessary.
---
All the people saying that they would spite vote no to PvP balance changes are extremely childish and leading the game down a bad path.  Statements like   
---
&gt; There should be *no* content that is for strictly for PVMers yet involves PVP (Wildy bosses/Slayer, for example) or vice-versa. 
---
go against what originally made Runescape great in the first place. The Wilderness is one of the most interesting places in any multiplayer game EVER, and yet some people want to design it out of existence... It's really kind of sad. How hard is it to understand that if you go into the wilderness, there's a possibility that you will die? That's what makes it exciting! 
---
Then there's statements like  
---
&gt; Why would a PVMer vote to nerf their own defences? 
---
I would do this if it made PvP more fun and interesting as a whole, which I think this particular change will... It's not like getting pk'ed in my black d'hide with 10k risk is that big of a deal. Honestly, if you're a PvMer that whines about getting pk'ed in the wildy you're either a) bringing a ton of risk, which is beyond stupid (and you deserve to get killed) or b) upset that you lost a small amount of time while doing whatever it was you were doing... in which case I just can't take you seriously. Throw another set of black d'hide on and get back out there? 
---
It's a sad state of affairs when a good change must be made through an integrity update b/c one group of players is spiteful and selfish (and these people exist as both PvM'ers and PvP'ers), but that's what you get through any type of polling system. I just hope that Jagex can continue to isolate the good changes that need to be made with or without the support of the playerbase.
---

Well since GG drops so many potions and stuff, your only costs are blowpipe over time, but yeah thats still super expensive.
---
Jagex has a long time habit of fucking "fixing" things that are not broken. I consider my golden age runescape to be from 2008-2011. But even during this time, every month or two months jagex would just ruin something perfectly fine "just cause", like changing iconic attack animations to generic piss-fest, would change stuff like where overhead prayers would be placed, it used to be below hitpoints, then above hitpoints, and all hell broke lose. Then they release overloads which COMPLETELY throws any PVM balance out the window, then there's soutsplit which did that in further, and then soul wars, and then chaotics.
---
I feel OSRS is in a far better place, even though it definitely is much more ezscape right now than it was in the original 2007-2008. With runelite doing what it does and tbow/bp, there's a pandoras box that has been opened, but still, the voting system does help.

By the time rshd came out weren‚Äôt Santa‚Äôs already like 100mil?

I am dumb so I am not grasping this concept. Why does wildy bosses existing mean that pvp is not optional?
---
Agreed. No idea why they didnt just make it match... now it looks like youre a walking piece of hard candy
---
Gz! You can finally start rcing with all that pure ess!
---
Make it like the varied wendigo screeches from until dawn so I can jumpscare myself every few minutes
---
MystVoider is my ign.. why?
---
Scam? I got the drops son
---
Yeah the sweaters themselves are fine. 
---
The icons just don't look good at that scale imo
---
This is LITERALLY, how EoC came to pass and destroy runescape as we know it. People were heavily against, but there were the "prophets" like you, who said that jagex had to man up and just do what the "game needs".
---
The best part is this episode literally did play out like that lol, and I have experienced this pain for myself.
---
I remember when I got 70 attack I was still a pretty poor newbie member but I knew my net worth of all my decent items would be close to 2.6m and I needed like 3m. But I really wanted a whip because I knew once I had a whip I had the bis weapon at the time and I could worry about everything else later, but my weapon was second to none. So I sold all my armor, weapons, other valuables and  junk as well, including placeholders for herbs/pots/ores/bars/runes etc. and that amounted to like 80k or something. 
---
No one in World 2 Fally was selling a whip for less 3m. So getting desperate I just added this one guy selling at 3m and just started begging for him to lower the price by 300k. Now this dude was one of those dickhead merchants that has like 40 noted whips or something and flips them off people, which is why he straight up told me after a while that if he sold &lt; 2.9mil he'd lose money since that's what he paid for it. So being a typical 12 year old nerdy kid I started whinging and crying and he didn't have the heart to mute me, I think he must've been an adult because he had a lot of patience while he could've muted me and kept selling whips to others.
---
After 45min of this or so he sold it to me for 2.7m, everything I had. My bank was literally spotless, I sold everything possible at general store and valuables to actual players.
---
My dick was never so hard, I had a fucking WHIP. I remember print screening it and making it my display picture on MSN. 2 of my friends message me straight away going dude thats not you lol. Then I met them in game and theyre like OH SHIT NICE. For the record, my friends were noobier than me they didnt realise how bad it is to sell everything for 1 item. They just loved the abby whip as much as me.
---
Fuck it was a good day.
---
At first launch it was a tank and spank with no mechanics. It was updated to have mechanics that made it much easier as long you you figure them out/look them up
---
Hi, I‚Äôm a PC.
---
And I‚Äôm a **SCRAAAAAAAAAW**
---
As a pvmer, I 100% agree with this. I usually vote positively on the PVP changes because I know that a well geared pvmer will usually escape successfully from a pker.
---
I‚Äôve got about 70 combat stats in everything but defense and magic, and level 85 combat level.
---
I agree with you, but I feel like I need to get my prayer (52) higher and magic to at least 70. Smithing to 60
---
So I can use the Blast Furnace for free, and 70 mining for adamant. 
---
So in the mean time, I can try to grind out gp so maybe I don‚Äôt have to spend any actual money to get there. But if it keeps going like this I dunno.
---
In max ranged + rigour, not slayer helm or salve ei, with a blowpipe that has dragon darts, the standard max hit at 112 range is 30 (45 with spec). With a crystal bow, it's 32.
---
This attuned bow will likely have a higher max hit. Also, if it's hitting 2 shots every 3.6 seconds, then it is really counting dps as 1 hit every 1.3 seconds or roughly 2 ticks (pipe is 3tick:1.8 seconds). 
---
Not only would this attuned bow have a higher max hit than a dragon dart blowpipe, it would be faster DPS than the blowpipe.
---
So yeah, it would be fucking nuts.
---
Which is great as we'll see alot more variety. Dds, claws, anchor, d2h etc. I see this as an absolute win. We'll obviously still see gmaul aswell.
---
Not op but i got pmod back in 2011 for being a very high rank in the runehq cc and I lost the crown for quitting the game for about 2 years
---
Honestly man, buy a month of mems, grind out quests, and hit slayer or skilling, farming is a good passive money maker, other skills are valuable as well
---
Bossing will be more in-depth and we can curb powercreep if we somehow evolve our combat. Doesn't matter that PvMers would benefit, the game would be healthier overall.
---
It‚Äôs an actual place if you look at the map bruh relax
---
Lmfaoooooooo this is great üòÇ
---
Dude I remember buying my first purple phat for 6 mil. It must have been in 2003- 2004. Santa hats were like 200k at the time. I sold a few months later for 18 mil and bought a few mask sets, Easter eggs, and a half wine. God I wish I kept that stuff
---
Idk why your being downvoted. Your right
---
Legends

You should try it on a dragon
---
OSRS mobile introduced a fuckton of new players, they didn't play because of nostalgia.
---
give acb a metal scream haha
---
Jesus at 2500 kc I have pet, 11 tents, and 5 tridents
---
That's cool.  I don't remember saying that they did.
---
Gz man, hope I'll get the lil smokey boi soon too
---
-5900kc btw
---
$99 for the trimmed versions right?
---
Its a refreshing trade.
---
Is extra security a bad thing?
---
The actual problem is the Prayer so called Augury. It gives +25% defence bonuses as well as 25% MAGIC defence bonuses. Combine that with black d hide and its actually insane.
---
Sexes are equal - women are just as strong as men in every imaginable category. 
---
That‚Äôs why we need to balance the playing field.

ya imo this nerf isnt that horrible considering you pair it with dhide, serp, and magic defence boots with augury anyways.
---
Last chance?
---
Fm, qp, thieving. Thats 150 euros from me for jagex alone. They would be booming.
---
Because it has no uses anywhere in the pvm game. If it does please tell me lol.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs actually pretty smart. Might start doing that. üòÇ
---
You total can, it‚Äôs fine.
---
i've honestly wanted to rep some RS gear for a very long time. To be honest, the RS merch is super lackluster, embarrassing, or doesn't represent the game well. These are by far the most interesting merch item since the pins except I'd actually purchase one of these.
---
Nah if you read closely, apparently verac is a bandos brother
---
Why is Rosie O‚ÄôDonnel in the advertisement?
---
Yeah got too afk lmao. Figured it's not worth shitting my pants over and I'm glad the death is out of the way early.
---
Didn't care much about it from the beginning and I'd rather lose it now than in 6 months when I might actually be butthurt about it
---
I did it to reach 70 after I had already recolored my Graceful. It‚Äôs way better exp if you don‚Äôt hate doing it.
---
Just cause something that was badly designed/tedious survived to 2007 doesn't mean it needs to stay like that. If you want new players to come to the game and they see someone 3 ticking granite for 14 hours a day, you are probably not going attract that person.
---
I don't think the underground pass skips are necessary, but I sure wouldn't give a fuck if they were in the game or not. Saving someone like 10 minutes in a single quest line isn't going to effect anything in the grand scheme of things.
---
Number C
---
Or maybe the pvming/skilling community is a huge majority and will always vote no on anything that makes tanking harder for them (even though all this update does is help solo pkers fight off against other pkers using ancients).
---
I was and I wasn't. I meant a scenario in which Revenants would be just as dangerous as players and you would also lose your items if you died just like you would a player. In my scenario, i personally don't see a huge difference between running away from a player while skilling in the wilderness or running away from an NPC, you are still unpredictably interrupted. You aren't engaging in pvp by running away is my point.
---
The MMO aspect of the wilderness is that the danger is from other players, people. If People collectively decided not to attack each other in the wilderness it would no longer be dangerous. If people wanted they could create a clan called "defenders of spade" and vow to protect clue scroll hunters in the wilderness. And people could then create a clan dedicated to killing defenders of spade members, and so on. That type of gameplay cannot happen anywhere else in the game. 
---
I think it's strange one hand to say "the skill ceiling is incredibly high" in regards to pvp, and on the other hand say "I don't believe pvp should \[...\] grant non-cosmetic rewards" Why shouldn't a game reward players for being good at it?
---
EoC definitely didn't destroy runescape, MTX did.
---
Pretty dumb comment, now everyone knows you‚Äôre miserable
---
If you have the favor already it's not horrible. 1 full set is only 11 lovakite ore and 22 coal, GL I just had the same step lol.
---
Lol jk. Barrage and specs you with nerfed gmaul
---
amazing, thank you
---
Actually had a couple people attempt that today that didn‚Äôt read the update. Feelsbadman
---
Clearing my cache solved this for me before
---
It's not just that it's the slowest skill in the game by a large margin, it's that you can't even AFK it. 
---
I can train fishing to 99 on slow xp rates just fine because I can afk it super hard so it doesn't feel so taxing.
---
&gt;PvMers should not be able to dictate content that isnt relevant to them
---
And therein lies the problem: Jagex constantly puts PvM and skilling shit in the wildereness. Convince them to move all of that stuff and you'll probably see a drastic improvement in the quality of PvP polls. 
---
&gt;Especially given how much hatred and spite the PvM community holds towards PvP.
---
Which only exists because of PvM and skilling content being shoehorned in to the wild in order to create an artificial interest. 
---
&gt;PvMers would probably vote the wilderness out of existence. 
---
Sooner than they would vote in favor of updates that make killing them even easier? Yes, absolutely. 
---
&gt;You just want to be able to hold PvPers under your boot. 
---
No, I want to ignore you entirely. Unfortunately Jagex does not make that realistic when they put things like best in slot magic equipment, pets, and unique skilling/PvM items in the wildereness.
---
r/woosh
---
You found a new business venture
---
Same. F1-4 On my side panel.
---
Calling it orsr makes me think you don't really care anyway.
---
Uh oh. U got tiddies and u posting here. Hold the flood gates
---
Here for that Hunter hoodie, Thieving hoodie is pretty badass too
---
But can you buy it at that price sp you can get it without completing the objectives?
---
You still need them enchanted bolts. But yea you can buy those slowly
---
We're all always dying.
---
"How is this true to osrs"
---
Boy youre in for a shock, osrs is a build of runescape following the old school design not a exactly as it as in 2007 build.
---
Bold of you to assume they "missed" anything. 
---
Noobs with dumb ape brains and wads of cash to spend will want big, shiny, doofy looking garbage to make their accounts look amazing. Look at any MMO with P2P and you'll see it.
---
Haha, no it stops you if your cart is over a few thousand dollars.
---
Old Rune School Scape?
---
Is there a cc for zalcano. To form small groups better loot
---
Wowee
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
Alright I hope the time machine you're building to go back and properly school a child on tongue in cheek humor is going well, since this post left you so distraught
---
Stuffed crab is the best.
---
Woah, Verac is a popular guy. Guthan is my favorite though.
---
And also pass as an undercover furry
---
Also im jealous of the jacket. The slayer symbold is goofy but identifiable and the game has bad graphics so its blocky way kinda fits. That maroon tho.. i wouldnt pay for it from the jagex shop without the accurate red but i rather like the jacket as a whole. Jagex plz
---
This is why I love the idea of revenant caves, even if it's stupid broken for clans being able to lock down entire worlds to bot it endlessly.
---
Nothing in revenant caves is necessary for pvm. All the unique rewards are only useful in the wilderness, where they're farmed. The only reason you would be willing to risk going into a pvp zone is if you want the items to use in a pvp zone. This is an excellent way to design a feedback loop into player choice.
---
Theres a little animation you use in a few quests to hand items over to NPCs, it would be cool to use that in player interactions
---
Found the hacker trying to steal Ops name
---
Too much negative mage accuracy that vestments robes are worth it

I will get 99 agility for this.

Oh my god there are gloves too?? I HAVE TO GO BACK?

Will you be doing the inferno? If so it will be good for that

How will they make sure you can‚Äôt wear your quest cape hoodie if they release a new quest?
---
Yes it's good for pkers and less good for pvmers hence why i said overall
---
What I thought still made me giggle a little.
---
that option C dragonstone looks like it would actually fit very well.
---
Happy cake day
---
My bad, used very poor wording. I agree with you, but where are you getting 500k from? (just seems a bit lower than my calc)
---
Buying gold, so I suppose gold farmers
---
Video games cause violence too. Hes going to grow up to be a serial killer
---
The comparison to msb shouldn't have been there. If they just said explicitly that its a 3 tick range weapon, 2 on rapid, there would've been no problems. Not sure why they wouldn't clarify this fully at the time.
---
If you fish in draynor or at barbarian village in F2P you can run into some hilarious conversations.
---
I got the full set in 7 games. I didn‚Äôt realize that it was kind of rare.
---
dude if you‚Äôre dying literally every time you cross into the wilderness then you must be doing something wrong. i‚Äôve been PKd exactly once and it was while i was afking wildy slayer (ie, my own dumb fault), and yet i go there for a clue step at least once a week. just pay attention to the minimap and be ready to hop worlds if you really don‚Äôt wanna fight. it‚Äôs seriously not that big of a deal
---
They havent increased it the real dollar is inflated.
---
Also you can use the osrs highscores page to see your exact exp if you wanted it.
---
ROFL. Doesn't exactly give you more XP rates to begin with. What in the client makes skilling easier? Cannon overlay for slayer that should exist to begin with. Ground markers... Bank tags.. agility hotbox highlighting? What else that's truly "lazy"? Or are you just in the "3rd part client bad" group because ?
---
Option A is the least bad, but really need to change the helmet to a normal full helm. /u/MaximaxRS also had some good suggestions for a less purple version, which would be nice.
---
Of course you don't, but *if you do,* you should honor it.
---
Youre right, this was communicated poorly by me. I understand why this was down voted now, totally expressed something I didn't mean to. What I was indicating by unique is that we will see maul abused less after this nerf, but I like your word choice more. Sorry for that. For what it's worth, I totally support the maul change.
---
I just hopped worlds (the first time I made it to fossil island) until I found someone stood at it and asked them for a hammer
---
Just get hard diary done
---
Bot
---
I think the bigger problem is that the osrs team is a tiny percentage of Jagex and has no real power to do anything major without approval.
---
i don't really see a problem there because you wouldn't be able to level the skills anyway
---
