You are probably just too used to the timing and range of the rcb.  If you had rapid and 100% time on target BP should win every time.

you make teletabs on them
---
I see you, too, like Agility.
---
and its gonna be removed from raids table tommorow :P

Is using 3rd party clients such as OSBuddy or RuneLite safe? I‚Äôve heard people get banned sometimes for no reason while using them?
---
Monkfish, usually. 
---
rc is bad but honestly with zeah rc it actually isnt TOO bad.
---
Does that room count as lobby and after everything is cleared I can just run to that room? 
---
Is that okay /u/Chymistry ? 
---
You legit look like the kid from the MAD magazines.

I thought the giants log was a spell the champ was casting

A man of taste

&gt; Ironmen will cry harrasment even if the other person is oblivious. I didn't notice an Ironman one time and he instantly started going at me like that. I apologized, said I didn't notice because I was pretty afk, and he didn't care. I just reported, made sure he was on ignore, and left.
---

---
This is called bias. Just because you met someone that was bad isn't reason to extrapolate that experience onto others. 
---
&gt; There's absolutely zero reason to be a racist piece of shit because your jimmies got rustled, and to think you're hot shit because you have 190 viewers on twitch is just a massive power trip. Those are the kind of people we don't need, pretty much in general. 
---
100% agree. Guy should be perma banned and OP should be muted for anti-semitism. 
---
WDR senpai
---
trout since i safespot most of the monsters
---
Ahhh! He said it! 
---
unless you are a ironman it does not matter 
---
no its not.
---
It's not a runelite setting it's an ingame one. Not sure exactly which but just mess around with the settings/advanced settings.
---
Does a hooded box actually work for you? Maybe my cat is special.
---
You try shaving hundreds of wild boars without any accidents
---
how is it a shit minigame though? It's great combat xp. And before you say hurdur slayer will max my combat! No it won't. Slayer will max your mage and range maybe but never your melees.
---
Autobot wants to delete how do I tag? Thanks jamflextape
---
I don't know for skillets, but my friends fry daddy got his in 4 hours.
---
&gt;I actually want to play the game not afk
---
U picked the wrong game my friend.
---
One of my buddies guided me through an entire run while I shared my screen on Discord. He explained the mechanics, spawns, strategies, how to handle certain situation etc. That has helped me A TON (got the cape in only 7 attempts). So having an experienced friend willing to help you like that is very beneficial. Also, pause before Zuk (final boss) and start a timer so you know when the ranger+magers spawn.  
---
   
---
Short explanation of how the spawns work during Zuk:  
---
  
---
Timer starts at **0:00** at start of kill  
---
First set spawns at **0:45**  
---
Timer pauses when Zuk is **599** hp and unpauses when Zuk is **479** hp  
---
2nd set spawns at **6:00**  
---
3rd set spawns at **9:30**  
---
4th set spawns at **13:00**   
---
cheese potato
---
Imagine using Reddit enough to care about a suite for it :p
---
&gt; Does not excuse blatant racism and the inability to handle even the slightest bit of adversity.
---
100% agree. Crying when 1 mob gets hit is on the IM, crying on repeat crashes is on the guy crashing. Racism isn't okay at all. 
---
I mean, I didn't say all ironmen. I should probably edit it to say some ironmen. I've met plenty of totally fine and pleasant ironmen, but you can't deny that there is a vocal minority that likes to pull the targeted harrasment card.
---
Again, I used broad terms when I shouldn't have. 
---
I thought making party hats worthless was good thing
---
They actually removed it in rs3 cause it was so bad 
---
Jagex is aware of this issue, as it does seem lazily thrown in as a reward.
---
If Warding passes and eventually enters the game as a new skill, ring imbues will be moved to that. If it doesn't pass, I believe they said they'll still eventually move ring imbues to something more relevant.
---
Might depend on the monster you're fighting. I think the 3 times may be because of 3 different drop tables being called at once. It could happen from the regular drop table, clue scroll, and ensouled head triggering simultaneously.
---
The fuck
---
until like 75+ slayer i used potato with cheese from warriors guild for 12gp each
---
Whoah, that must be rare as fk :o

I‚Äôm in! What exactly is -4 GMT? For a North American

no

There's already zamorak banner, which can be bought from castle wars.

Thanks for the video, good summarization :) 
---
I'd be down for this! I'd like to try not to leech but I've only "done" one raid on my main for music cape, so I have some learning to do. I mostly want to see if my ironman has good enough gear for raids. Anyway, username: Reckless Lad
---
Max melee with 97 range and 95 magic, just a tad off 99 Slayer. Say again?
---
Thats adwaam im pretty sure thats insane
---
To fight Zulrah on mobile? Probably not if you haven‚Äôt gotten used to it on pc. Also try setting up your f keys so you can switch between your invent and prayer tab faster 
---
God i miss the days of going to the Telecenter in town after school in 2005 to play Runescape with my friends.
---
I skull tricked one of my friends for his Iron warhammer and he still hasn't forgiven me 14 years later. 
---
Oh you are right, I completely forgot about it. Thanks!
---
I haven't done fishing trawler yet so I can't comment on how necessary these buffs are, but I can say with absolute certainty that they are exactly that, buffs, not QoL.  This would make the mini game massively easier and literally double xp/hr on it.  This sub has a big problem with not understanding what QoL means, but this is one of the worst cases of it I've seen.
---
Manta
---
 And poh banners made on banner easel,  and you can have Sara zammy or guthix as your family crest
---
Not even fully 100% efficient, you need tick perfect clicks to get that
---
Depends on the subject too. I'm begging that, for example, computer science has a lot more rs players than art history.
---
Truth, preach it!
---
Hope it's like my cerb luck. Completed with 3 prims and smoldering stones, 2 jars in 750 kills. Will eventually go back for the pet.

There's no need for a RC buff. Just deal with it. It got buffed with RC on zeah

4206 huh. Nice pin.
---
Shut up serene
---
Bruh, wtf, that was what I dealt with back in high school. We literally studied old exams and quizzes and then got threatened with expulsion for cheating because the teacher was too lazy to change things up. That shit is fucking stupid. Hope you got out of it okay because it required multiple law suits for us to get our grade.
---
Shrimp and prawns are different creatures.
---
Monks, but since I'm working towards 99 cooking atm, I'll probably save some karambawans/sharks and use those.
---
I love the tone of the livestreams and the jmods in general. They really seem like a group of dedicated fans talking to the rest of the fans. 
---
I can't think of another game where there is such a thin barrier between commumity and devs. 
---
It's hard to describe correctly, but its like theres a deliberate lack of "PR Mentality" You've literally got the guys elbow deep in game code on stream taking suggestions. And they can answer directly. "X is a great idea but I've worked with X code before and it's such a mess it would take months. I'll see if theres a workaround, but if it comes down to it would you rather have X, or new content?"
---
Are you saying it's not open source or are you saying open source doesn't matter?

You could say it's a buff. I don't mind if the angler outfit becomes faster to obtain because that means i can get it over with and do other things. Look at the woodcutting and rogue outfit, they can obtained in roughly around a hour.

great minds etc etc I guess
---
Don‚Äôt shut up serene

HD would never pass as a replacement for what we have now. If it passes at all it will be as an optional thing
---
Something be ‚Äútied to alch value‚Äù means that their price on the GE is very close to it‚Äôs alch value.
---
A rune platebody alchs for 39k. It‚Äôs GE price never falls far below 39k. They are usually like 38.7k on the GE.
---
If you buy a Rune Platebody for say, 38.6k. It is **impossible** to lose money because you can alch it for a profit (don‚Äôt forget nature rune prices)
---
So a 100% safe way to merch items is to pick items like this which are ‚Äútied to alch value‚Äù because even if you can‚Äôt sell the items for a profit you can alch them for your money back plus a small profit
---
Ofc it would be small, the exp would be like 3 per patch nothing more.
---
Bold of you to assume I have the slayer level to kill them. Or if I could afford that gear.
---
Weird flex but okay...
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a free carrot mask
---
Usually you can either tweet them or submit an appeal, but I don't think they'll be able to help as they don't reimburse lost items/cash.
---
Not trying to be a dick but you said what everyone else was thinking lol
---
That's why I always appreciate the dude who writes out all the Q&amp;A transcripts
---
Nah because with trawler you get random fish some which are not worth keeping.
---
If he's getting RC xp through tears, then he's already got a higher agility level.

No type of brewing will save you from that.

To make profit from bows you need to string them. Yew longbows are currently around 130gp profit to string, Magic longbows are 80gp or so.

A non-clickable button probably wouldn't be very useful

Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
I mean yea I figured. Just meant when tears is no longer as useful for agility. The grind is always real.
---
wtf 5 zulra?
---
[Kinda but not really](https://youtu.be/CA3lIuN_zVE)
---
Thanks for your comment! I‚Äôm at 46 magic, is it worth getting this up ASAP so I can alch as well? Been lazy too even tho I‚Äôm 88 combat. What‚Äôs an easy way to level up magic at this level?
---
So wtf is neet matafaka
---
So Ive got 1100hrs in this game and have never price checked a dragon full lol. 
---
I assumed since I never see them, that they are outclassed by Serp/Neitz/Slayer helms in every scenario. Between that and a guess based on other dragon gear I didnt think the ptice was significant.
---
Why the fuck *is* the dragon full helm so expensive? Rarity and nostalgia?
---
5: Dropping salve ei before the raid even starts
---
I don‚Äôt think it belongs on the main interface like this
---
Ssssh ;p
---
Got 2 in the kc of maxing favor on lizardmen, then another 12 from getting a dwh at 2.5k kc on shamans.
---
My suggestion would be to just do shamans, at least then you'll make money while on the tali grind.
---
What did i wrong? :(
---
I'm a math teacher and that title kills me

There was some cunt who tried to snipe my password but I always typed it way too fast and would flail my fingers over other keys just to fuck with him. He knew I knew.

Not 100% sure where but its a prophecies ele for sure.
---
Oh god I forgot all about this game until now. Checked it out in middle school and was confused. Nearly 15 years later and I'm still not sure what to make of it. 
---
You realize I basically did the opposite of complaining right?  You can do whatever you want within the rules in wildy, and I'm free to judge you as a person if I want when you do stuff like rag PJ people who are 1v1ing for no reason.
---
Just like how I'm free to judge you for calling me a retard for making incorrect assumptions
---
Having an equivalent of a modding community is always beneficial and smart business sense. Many indie devs bank on a robust and determined modding community to fill in content gaps and add way more features to the game than would be possible by just the dev alone. In Jagex's case yeah it's a tad silly they "can't afford" it when they are by no means an indie dev, but from their end it makes sense to let volunteer modders do the work.
---
7 am ET/12 pm GMT tomorrow

Can't do herblore without druidic ritual unless you lamp the whole way I guess? And as pvp only that means you can't get exp so hope you like being lvl 3.
---
Do you know where to send an appeal?

If they don't reimburse, I'll probably just bot. It's stupid when they could easily look at the trade log and see where the gold went

As someone who hated mining alot, upper level and bigger sack makes it bearable 
---
&gt;If you want a riskier game, don't play Runescape.
---
Runescape always has been a game where your items are at risk when you die. It should continue to be that game.
---
&gt; Clearly your feelings on the matter aren't coinciding with the majority of the community. 
---
Yes they do. They absolutely do. They don't coincide with the *vocal minority of extremely hardcore players*.

---
Hello runelite shill
---
Thanks! You‚Äôre doing God‚Äôs work 
---
What happens if you change your gender after that quest... or do you never see her/him again after it? Haven't done it yet :p
---
Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure but I bet there is a YouTube video on how to do it fastest! Magic is useful so it‚Äôs always useful to get it up.

Probably has a switch for the bracelet of slaughter to extend tasks

Oh how awkward that will be.

Did you max prayer before magic?  Madman

Open the menu to redeem the bond and click the writing in the lower right corner of that menu relating to name change. It's all done in-game with a bond
---
Have they said what task will be required to kill it?
---
I dunno, it beats having to play pest control for 15 hours for full void.

thats why i have the god capes ;D

Going to post my obby cape drop now

As long as it doesn't break the game, then there's no reason for it to be taken down, even though it's an OP client to begin with.
---
May be a dumb quuestion, but i hadnt been keeping up with the kebo update and did not realize that konar was going to give more points per task than Duradel. 
---
So should i switch to just doing tasks for Konar or stick with Duradel and just do Konar tasks for every 10th, 50th etc.?

By clicking redeem name change will my old name be unlocked? I'm trying out new names but I want my old one back. When I type it out it just says it's already taken

What are you talking about? All I‚Äôm saying is someone that has never played RS sees an add saying double xp for runescape they are not sitting there going ‚Äúomfg that is to good to be true‚Äù, they probably think ‚Äúoh, this new game is doing a double xp for all new players, I might sign up‚Äù...

Arent saradomin monk robes just the regular brown monk robes

If you haven't got all 3 helms, then I would buy whichever one is remaining; helpful to for inventory space for switches if you ever decide to raid with the void setup
---
But otherwise, probably prayer as that's where money is at.

To be frank, Mac trackpads are leagues ahead of any trackpad on the market, Surface comes close but isn‚Äôt the same.

I have 3 videos of him 3 out of many I didn‚Äôt record, that he prot melee as I‚Äôm bout to kill him. He‚Äôs a shit cancerous pker. Wanted to expose him on reddit but to much work to compile clips. I play on mobile, don‚Äôt even touch the pc :)

Teaks will be the fastest XP until 99 so it depends on what you want out of the skill, money or xp

Triple Jads: not much really to say here. If you can get to them, you can do them easily, and I did them on my first try. The two times I died this wave were actually after I killed one of the Jads and stopped paying attention as closely for the last two...
---
Zuk: use the tile markers to mark each safe ranging spot, and then always move between those squares. Also keep timers so you know when to expect spawns (there's another comment detailing when exactly those happen).
---
use https://osrs.wiki

Did this yesterday..

You have to go to the site and change it after you redeem a bond then it will allow you to use your previous name.

Not sure why anyone would want to increase ballista risk when the wep already is expensive to use requiring over 1k per shot if using dragon javelin

Lol how to scout you mean!!

Unlikely

And I work off salary so I can spend my free time at work however the fuck I want. What's your point? 
---
Lmao
---
Not sure. I do know that the plug-in doesn't work if you don't have a graphics card though
---
Should have told her to get your cooking to 99.
---
Have a full inventory and talk to a random event. The item will go on the ground and it will stay there for an hour. I think it stays longer tbh I timed it once bc it happened so often while I went for 99 rc.
---
Reconsider? 
---
Oh, now I see that's a plump lady. At first I thought it was someone in a costume of that gross cartoon character who holds his eyeballs.
---
Yeah it could because without a dedicated graphics card your CPU is doing all the work, and if it doesn‚Äôt like that, it will blue screen.
---
people easily escape, some just get there etc. really doesnt seem worth to me

i have like 1.5m on bank, can someone explain how bonds work for me? also, whats the best way of making money in a week of membership? i play a lot of hours a day, and would play extra since i would have membership

God... yes?

or go actual pking for fun and experience

It's called having fun. Not everything is about max efficiency

&gt;not being NEET living in your parents attic in 2019

I believe the above info about the guardians is incorrect.  I think it's boots of stone, not guardian boots.
---
Use the shield and stick with the tank armor. Keep in mind using barrows armor will cut into your profits
---
Hes not in wildy tho
---
Much harder on mobile tbh lol

This happened to me on wave 35 or so once luckily. Never will let that happen again

About time, I thought we were going to go a week without seeing this reposted.

Just sold mine for 151.4, like 500K below active price. I bought it for 56M, so either way I made money, but I'm really hoping it sucks at Hydras tomorrow (compared to t-bow and BP) and ends up going back down.

tbh slayer master shouldn't give green drags unless you use the wildy one.

Do you have to complete the easier diaries to be able to complete this challenge?

They were no longer effective against bots, as bots could complete them. As a result, they were a hindrance to legitimate players. So they removed the penalty, but people wanted them to stay in game for nostalgia.

Yeah, I didn't even mean to do it, I genuinely had the question but just had this username so long I forgot it's even profane.

In my opinion, pets should be an achievement. They shouldn't be on a buyable skill. They should be rare. Cooking is such an easy skill. You do wines for 15 hours and boom 99

That's like dropping a 405lb barbell on your chest while bench pressing.

Look up the safe spot/flinch spot for the dragon. I just did it a few days ago. I was level 38, with att, str and def being around 35. It took forever but got it done.

Sorry, I'm just so used to the name I forgot it was even profane. Swear it wasn't on purpose. Thanks for being a good sport.

The Todt wasn't complete aids but I doped the fuck out of there as soon as I got my tome at 87 KC.

Don't worry lad, I understand you. Trouble Brewing is one of my favorite minigames.
---
You don't need magic accuracy, but magic strength(occult neck, mage arena 2 cape) is good. The rest should be tank armor(d chain is cheap, d legs, etc). Use highest defense you have. Also using barrows costs money since it degrade so if you have high defense level you don't even need it.

 Its almost impossible to get hacked just with a good password. Jagex's lack of special characters and the fact that the passwords aren't case sensitive is probably what caused the issue. Steam, Blizzard, GOG, guildwars 2, battlerite, etc.... No other account has been hacked and I only play on one computer.

I love Zanaris, its random shit like this that makes me love the game and justify the grind.

Thanks for the diary entry.

That is missing the point. I stated in my 2nd comment that a major goal of any business is to reach an appropriate level of income, this is how a company thrives and survives - that is easily understandable. The point I was trying to make, was summarized by the other person who replied to you. While making money is good, a company cannot put that on the highest pedestal alone and only focus on that. Doing so actually ends up decreasing the value of your company in the long-run, because you end up losing customers due to not providing them with proper levels of quality. Sure you may be able to ride on that monetary gain for so long, but unless things change, eventually that ride is going to end once people discover better alternatives. RL is that better alternative, because they have provided their customers with what they want, and have delivered it with proper quality, without force-charging people for certain features and/or bragging about their success. This ends up equaling happy customers. Happy customers results in more people using your product, and more people switching to your product after deeming it the most-valuable of all alternatives.
---
Time stamp?

This quest unnerved me as a kid and when I finally got the boss I was like (in kid speak) "jesus fucking christ".

If you're a member enchanting jewelry is almost always profitable between 20-100ish a cast.

1. There are grammatical errors, which are a dead giveaway that it's a scam. (IE, the use of 'games')

2. Any time you're dealing with account infractions, you can do it on the official website. Navigate to it the same way you always do (meaning, don't click any links in an email) then just log in and check your account status. If there aren't any outstanding infractions, you're good. If there are, deal with them **there**, not through the email.

Thank you. Looked into oak plank prices and they seem pretty low currently. Will be going with this

I think I remember a zulrah plugin that told you where to stand and what to pray that they had to take off? Could be wrong though

For me personally it's a combination of two things:
---
For one, I like playing the game how the developers intended it to be played. In other words, a lot of the features in runelite are pretty "EZScape". Now I know that these can all be disabled, but eh. It's a preference thing still.
---
And for two, it's been hammered into my head to never use a third party client for security reasons. I know that a lot of the community uses them anyway and they've been shown many times to be safe, but I still like being 110% secure with the official first party client.

funny you should mention that tho i killed 400 troll generals range safe spotting in the end didnt get one

Decided to try out the cyclopses got within 5 kills makes yah think haha

do you hate yourself and have 250-300 hours to spare?

yes, but only on the designated worlds

just drink some [choccy milk](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stamina_potion) then

That's how mafia works!
---
Zerker is probably more important.  It gives Max hit while archers only gives accuracy.
---
O-okay
---
no one likes a nagger
---
You have no idea man.
---
I agree just let ppl do what they want....as long I‚Äôm enjoying the game I don‚Äôt give a shit whether they RWTed or bought the account or whatever
---
Well I've done fishing to 99, and that took me 2 months. I was going to do Hunter to 99 but I kind of feel like doing Runecrafting because i can do it easily at break at work
---
Nice.
---
The afk part is the mining. You still gotta run to the alter and what not but it‚Äôs way less click intensive than normal runecrafting. The exp rates are still pretty bad it‚Äôs around 40k exp an hour but it‚Äôs nice to do while doing something else. 
---
I will literally pay someone to organize my bank like this

this guy memes

yeah but you'd be a learner not a leecher.

Hey I‚Äôm not the one who thought you could construct a dragon hunter crossbow.

Bro the fucking days!! My mates and I did the same stuff just all set up next to eachother and play! Unreal!!
---
what? no its free LOL i even split with learners we just got a twisted bow tonight
---
Yes, , 'reddit 07' and '2007 reddit', they're in the sidebar.
---
Damn, you got a steal. My cost me 20k and my rune scim. 
---
Its pretty clise to say but I started to pvm after setting goals of mine getting reguirements for stuff (usually stuff which gave a bit money) and did that for a while and moved to the next. Sounds easy enough but everything can be a bit time consuming in this game. Just have breaks when you feel bored and continue when you have motivation and time (atleast how i did it)
---
A few goals of mine which I had and gave money:
---
\- upper motherlodde and blast mine
---
\- Gear upgrades so when doing nmz its easier (fury avyssal whip etc.
---
\- Woodcutting magic
---
\- farming level for raids
---
\- minnow fishing
---
Too Smokey in your CC is v salty ;p

Thanks I‚Äôm a free to play scrub trying to beat all the quests first

Okay cool appreciate the response

It's ok guys, he hasn't unlocked the secret code of a master Hunter. The trap of all traps, the tried and true method of a master Hunter... Legendary...

Godswords didnt exist when I was a kid playing lol. Whip hit max or nothing and Dh was the only other high hitting setup

I'm pretty sure it lasts until you teleport or log out.

Well jebrim's actually insane so

Yeah I think I remember that being a big point of contention for Jagex so they killed that plugin.

I've been leveling construction and runecrafting by actually training them recently.

BA mini game is Alot of fun^^ to bad we got the torso leavers :/

Actually in RS3 this version of Tolna is related to a hydra-god named Loarnab. He was executed by Zaros in the area of Tolna‚Äôs rift. He left some power behind in the region, related to the last four feelings he had: anger, fear, confusion, and hopelessness. Tolna is implied to have somehow unintentionally siphoned what energy was left of Loarnab to become... this.

Do you seriously not see how moving this money around is easy enough to make tracking it impossible and render this entire system shit? It also would need to be automated since people claim this crap 100k times per day and it would be literally 100% impossible to do manually. 
---
There are valid gripes to have with jagex but item return isn't one of them. 
---
Also, before people mention rushers, realistically you‚Äôre still almost never going to kill a rusher even if they have to wait 6 seconds to teleport away.

Yeah except 10k with cowhides at 100gp each used to take literally 30 mins to 1 hour dude lol, I used to do cowhides to buy rune scimis to go pk on fresh accs I'd train there, so by the time I had 40 att I could pk with a rune scim
---
but yeah, 30 minutes. lol
---
I don't know why none of the guides mention it, but just do sanfew serum to literally 99.
---
It is a lot of clicks but it costs literally nothing.
---
yeah; can't stand this sub. Love the game, can't stomach the subreddit.
---
Still faster than runecrafting
---
Yup I keep seeing this too, super obnoxious.
---
Only requirement is level 5 in the role that you want to play as. Would recommend "Osrs ba" CC for learning and grabbing a torso 
---
How do you do this?

So this is random and probably useless. By the chaos druids in edgeville dungeon are fishing spots that you can't access, or even use it seems. Do you think there's some really hidden unique way of fishing there that no one has ever thought of?
---
You lost 20 mil. Shit sucks. Move on. As in get over it and regrind, or move along and find a different game.
---
P.S. no one ever gets hacked. Right wanna check your computer for a rat, or keylogger. Something along those lines. Good luck

We will get no new content for months and all future content will take twice as long to come out. They won‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt poll it.

Back to /r/t_d with you, trumplet.
---
Hitpoints: Always 1.33xp per 1 damage. afaik only exceptions to that is the Cannon, and certain niche quest enemies which give reduced or bonus XP.
---
Melee: 4xp per 1 damage in Accurate/Aggressive/Defensive, 1.33xp per 1 damage split between Att/Str/Def for Controlled.
---
Ranged: 4xp per 1 damage, long range gives 2xp in ranged and 2xp in defence.
---
Magic: Base cast xp + 2xp per 1 damage. Defensive gives 1.33xp in magic and 1xp in defensive (total 2.33xp compared to 2xp for accurate casting).

Yes, trynbot is a loyal viewer and split the item with my team. It was an 81m split each. 13 men were contributing and the rest were just there for the diary. 
---
No, you will not be receiving a split for leeching a raid. we don't need you to do anything other than stand still. We get a chance at a drop; you get your ONE killcount and the ability to finish your diary. My twitch is the same name as my reddit. hope to see you tomorrow.

---
Nats are very good profit but quite slow xp.
---
The ourania altar is a good option all the way to 99, especially if you have alts. Personally I'm not a big fan of it.
---
Lava runecrafting is the next best XP if you don't have alts, but its extremely click intensive.
---
Bloods / souls are a great relaxing option from 77 onwards.
---
Astrals and cosmics are another option for certain levels but they're never ideal.
---

I'd rather it not be a cape. I'm fine with it just being a list in the POH with no cosmetics. But I recall one of the J Mods had an idea for a cosmetic staff instead of a cape, which seems safer. The problem with a Cape is it is very easy to slowly creep perks onto it and turn it into a BiS Cape. But then if Comp is BiS, that causes a lot of problems; something RS3 is just starting to address. It is easy to say "just make it a cosmetic cape" but the Max Cape started cosmetic too so with how polls change stuff like that, I'm not sure if making a cape at all is wise.

Cons: NONE!

Don't forget there is a real world out there. Don't lose yourself, this game can be a cancer. Take care of yourself kid 
---
You can also do the raid now and it still counts
---
Yah, I have seen people express many of my same thoughts on mega threads about BH. And it doesn‚Äôt take very long at all to draw a lot of the same conclusions about problems and fixes. Jagex has addressed a few, but obviously the bulk of the development goes to PvM content and PvP is largely overlooked.

Are alchemical hydras a separate task or are they similar to Cerberus where a hellhound or hydra task does the trick?

Haha thanks man. The Zerker has been a ton of fun. Still wish I had learned the basics on a more cost effective account, and would urge others to do so, but it‚Äôs whatever. I‚Äôll add ya on my zerk when I get a chance.

I know there‚Äôs a real world out there and it‚Äôs always been me against the world from the beginning. Which is why I use this game as an escape from reality as of lately.

Anybody else realize how genius Jagex played Yelps? They introduce him out of nowhere, and everyone hates it when they realize it becomes a pay to win wheel.

Well what better to do than make a quest where you can kill him, then still keep the wheel but rename it to treasure hunter. Suddenly the complaints dried up and pay to win scape was solidified.

Things like him make me even more happy to have OSRS
---
Thanks! 
---
I do that with most programs and games, it is indeed a good idea! Just never thought of this use case.
---
Yes,  the grind pays off in the end, if you don‚Äôt have elite void yet either, might as well get those points too.
---
As an open racist, that offends me. 
---
Tears of guthix 
---
Nice. 
---
Much appreciated 
---
Sarcasm? Do you speak it?
---
use runelite. they even show u the route to the chest on the map lol 
---
wtf no this is so unrealistic, plants dont just make seeds to make new plants.
---
This is a great idea honestly. Makes me want to get the same tattoo lol
---
I can't fucking breathe LOL
---
You did that thing again, where you think out loud in the comments. I thought we talked about this.

Aye aye, sir.

This is kind of stuff is why im here.

Several times, yes. I even restarted my computer.

That FPS could surely be a bit better also ay
---
Thats my point, give the people what they want. THE OPTION to choose. I'm forced to use your favorite, you shouldn't be forced to use mine.

If youre losing money alching these days, youre doing it wrong

damn wtf, the dedication

Photo shop for sure
---
Not entirely useless,  new gloves are melee and give poor defensive bonuses.  So they are kind of like the torture necklace.  Really strong attack/str bonuses but bad Defense bonuses.  Barrows will still be good for things like tanking or tribridding.

Oak dungeon doors, which you can do with zero mouse movement using only left and right click and holding down '1'

Depends on how much you play; if not a lot then flipping on the grand exchange. If you can put the time in, then you can earn a bond during the one week free trial.
---
this man has built an awesome community and a nice streamer! much respect!
---
RuneLite as a third-party client is allowed, but I wouldn‚Äôt say all software is, as I imagine that could include botting scripts. So be careful, but you‚Äôre safe with runelite. 
---
Nayger?
---
No, it‚Äôs actually already begun. Midnight GMT on the 10th was ~8 hours ago.

As to why they're not on the G.E.. I don't know. Mine definitely doesn't seem soulbound after all..

Why did you not just reply to the post? There is no reason to create a post for this.

Where did you shove it tho? üåö

I‚Äôm disabled.

This is tav dungeon by the looks my dude

Thought so XD
---
Trying to grind out a bond when you start playing is brutal. If youre ever going to buy mems, the earlier the better. I paid for mems for a little bit and now am easily self-sufficient with bonds
---
In to this,  and also drop it instead of opening it.. they need to make it appear on top 
---
Thanks, awesome! Finally i won't miss any valuable seeds at dagannoths :D
---
That's a good call. I should set my thing to 200gp for stackables and go from there. The money stacks up. 
---
I'll alch myself now.
---
the vanilla client is so poorly maintained that it won't install on non english windows instances, they really don't give a shit about the game.
---
I work at a start-up that literally couldn't give less of a fuck what you do while you're working. Why should your employer care?
---
Just today I dropped 2mil on cons so I could get tears for rc
---
Looks good
---
RuneLite should be the official OSRS client already 
---
Hunter used to be one of my least favourite skills for some reason, but once I unlocked Herbiboars it became my favourite skill in this game. I might go for 99 soon. 
---
I'd say within the next 4-6 hours.  At least 2 hours.
---
Take a screenshot next time pls gz tho
---
I keep wondering when the game will just run out of things it can have

You would expect ripping the spine off an abyssal demon to be the Slayer cape emote but no we get a 3 second turoth stomp.
---
Where do the daggers come from though?

Badass! Love the look of the Abyssal Demon, looks like an Insect-Xenomorph Hybrid.

Don't spread misinformation.

I‚Äôve been playing Runescape since 07, still haven‚Äôt unlocked any friends.

This is the least funny osrs meme for sure. Let's make a list of memes we won't use anymore cause they're not funny.
---
Lol that‚Äôs a terrible take. Being in a trade union or owning your own business will get you 100x more respect in life than working in a grocery store. Unions put young people in a community of people that look out for each other &amp; develops character, gives you good benefits so you can take care of yourself and your family later in life. Stocking shelves will have you being taken advantage of by Walmart and your piece of shit boss with no insurance or retirement plans getting paid minimum wage.
---
yea i was kind of thinking of abstraction in this context as something that isn't really there but yea i guess that doesn't really fit how it is actually used
---
They are both very similar. There are some good youtube videos comparing it. Just do whichever one you enjoy more and the differences between them will be trivial.
---
I don't even pray any more. I just stand there and say "really?" 
---
It actually got one guy to stop cause I obviously had no loot
---
Nice, chances of that is .31%
---
They used RS3 graphics in the design, they're not real friends.
---
Mmm same as the gpu update. Hopefully one day.
---
I've done full obby since 70 combats. Just pick low hitting bosses. Probably 10-15k more xp than guthans. I would use about 800 absorption per 20min, probably less now at higher stats.
---
Unless you need nature runes... I imagine if you need nature runes then running anything else would be pretty pointless. 
---
No tome at 40m btw
---
Hol up, watchu say?

About an hour to an hour and a half from now

Like cerb but the alch hydra task exists as a boss task too, both only assigned by the new slayermaster.

I don't get it

You can

Oh so that‚Äôs where Settled moved to.

I wish they add an option to display new chat messages for a short while after they pop up and then make them disappear after a few seconds so the chat doesn't take up such a big area and you can't misclick and accidentally get the keyboard to appear.

Spoiler warning: It would be dead without rewards. And I say this as someone who loved playing stealing creation for fun back in the day

It‚Äôs the same content on the official wiki, but without cancerous ads and banners

Na, easy.

No 69 fps rip

That has to be intentional to include in the SS

What‚Äôs your favorite massive sword in dark souls?
---
Awesome, thanks buddy!
---
&gt; you got some necklaces worth like 20k xp you could use.
---
No, you got small, medium, and large/giant EXP lamps as well. Wasn't as OP as Treasure Hunter and the following promotions however (Prismania). TH mainly includes (or included, at least) bonus xp (sort of like the necklaces on SoF ~4-5 years ago), which is still insanely overpowered for the average high leveled player.
---
You deserved it bro, it's the least we could've given you. Glad you liked it and that you could put it into some use. When Jo√£o saw it he knew it was perfect ahaha
---
why did someone leech already now? Diary hasn't released yet?

Thanks for this! I'm planning on doing all of them tomorrow and this way won't have to keep re-visiting the same area. Well, all but the one where I have to wait for the seed to grow.

The blog post said the fishing style would be like using the falcon for hunter. My shoulder was not happy with that.
---
Libtards destroyed
---
Legitimately applies to so many users on this sub yep, not necessarily a bad thing just a factually accurate observation
---
Not everyone is a basement dwelling virgin like us on this subreddit. New players want a better looking game if they're going to invest time into it. I havent seen any statistics showing how long the average new player plays the game, but i guarantee it'd much longer if the game was more presentable.

It‚Äôs on its way up now. Won‚Äôt even buy for 155 right now.

This guy/princess gets it

---
You only hate him because people have told you to hate him for no reason. Bunch of rebellious bandwagoners lmao
---
I've been leveling up hunter so I can get to yew birdhouses. Falconry sucks massive ass. 1) You're not guaranteed success 2) You can't walk while the bird is flying 3) The kebbit can walk away from you while the bird is flying 4) You need to drop two items with each kill. Everything sums up to a sucky experience. 
---
Gl reaching anything noticeable if you only use tears. RC isn't even that bad.

Just enjoy it while you can dude, you‚Äôll land a job eventually and once you do you‚Äôll probably wish you were back to the freedom of just being able to play games and sleep in all day. We always want what we don‚Äôt have.
---
Zulrah prices are currently pretty low, and generally requires higher skill and stats to be efficient imo. That said if you don't like relying on RNG for your profit then stick to Vorkath as the regular drops are often double of what zulrah drops.
---
Also vorkath with DHCB is laughably easy and chill. Only times you really need to click is to dodge fireballs/poison and cast crumble.

The Kebos Lowlands
---
January 10 2019 The Kebos Lowlands
---
This week sees the release of the Kebos Lowlands expansion to the continent of Zeah!
---
 
---
Congratulations to J1mmy for winning the Kourend So Far video competition!
---
The Kebos Lowlands have finally come to Zeah: head to the far west of Kourend to try your hand at Aerial Fishing, receive a task set by the new Slayer Master, Konar quo Maten, and gain entry to the Farming Guild! Find a detailed guide on what to expect from the new content below, along with a map showing the various ways to get around Kebos. Before we delve in, a special thanks goes out to Mod Ian and Mod Surma for producing 18 amazing tracks to enjoy while exploring the Kebos Lowlands - more than any to ever accompany a previous update! 
---
Getting around Kebos
---
For those of you who haven't yet travelled to Zeah, you can do so by speaking to Veos (below) at the Port Sarim docks. He will take you to the Kingdom of Kourend which is made of five Houses on the continent of Zeah. After arriving in Kourend on his ship, you will find yourself in the Piscarilius house, on the Eastern side of Zeah. The Kebos Lowlands can be found on the far western side. 
---
Below is a map to help you find your way around the new areas, with a list of teleport and transportation locations and their requirements. 
---
1. The Farming Guild (entrance) - Farming Skillcape or Skills Necklace 
---
2. The Farming Guild (inside) - Spirit Tree (85 Farming) 
---
3. Fairy Ring - Start Fairytale Part II 
---
4. Mount Karuulm (Konar quo Maten) - Kourend Diary Blessing (Hard = 3 per day, Elite = Unlimited) 
---
5. Battlefront Teleport - the Arceuus Spellbook (60% Arceuus Favour 23 Magic) 
---
6. Lovakengj A - Xeric's Talisman (5% Shayzien favour)
---
7. Kharedst's Memoirs - Forsaken Tower Quest
---
8. Kourend Castle A - Xeric's Talisman (Architectural Alliance)
---
9. Kourend Castle B - Kourend Castle Teleport (Transportation Incantations)
---
10. Shayzien Cemetary - Kharedst's Memoirs (Tale of the Righteous Quest)
---
11. Fairy Ring - Start Fairytale Part II
---
12. Lake Molch - each dock allows transport to the others
---
13. Mount Quidamortem - Xeric's Talisman (Ancient Tablet) 
---
Examples 
---
Say a player wished to see Konar to receive a Slayer task but hadn't done the Kourend achievement Diary or started Fairytale Part II, the best route would to teleport to the Farming Guild via a Skills neckalace and run North East. Once at Mount Karuulm, they could climb up using the Agility shortcuts to reach Konar. Alternatively, players on the Arceeus spellbook could cast the Battlefront Teleport and run north west. 
---
Players looking to do a spot of Aerial Fishing may use the Fairy Ring south of the Lizardman Canyon or Kharedst's Memoirs then run west to catch a boat to the centre of Lake Molch. 
---
The Farming Guild
---
The land deep within the Kebos Lowlands is home to soil more fertile than anywhere else on Gielinor. Land this fertile is highly appealing to members of Hosidius house, even with the threat of the Lizardmen. Following an agreement between Lord Hosidius and Lord Shayzien, a detachment of Shayzien soldiers has been assigned to protect the area. This has allowed Hosidius house to build and maintain a guild where farmers can experiment and master their craft. 
---

---
Mount Karuulm
---
On the northern edge of the Kebos Lowlands lies the Sulphur Volcano of Mount Karuulm. Here, the Tasakaal, masters of life and death, make their home. Within the shadow of this volcano lies the home of the Kahlith. These beings were once human, but they have abandoned their previous lives in the name of the Tasakaal. Together, the Tasakaal and the Kahlith work together to maintain the balance between life and death. Assist them, and you might just be rewarded. 
---
Click here to read more about Mount Karuulm
---
Aerial Fishing
---
In the middle of Lake Molch is a small island home to Alry the Angler, a peculiar fisherman with a very different approach to catching fish. 
---
Alry uses birds, specifically Cormorants, to catch and return fish and salamanders that take residence in the nearby waters. Similar to Falconry when training Hunter, the player equips the bird on their arm. When clicking a fishing pool, the bird swoops down and returns to the player with the catch. If the player's inventory is full, the bird swallows the catch and doesn't award any experience to the player. The player must have both hands free to wield the bird. 
---

---
Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary
---
The Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary is a new diary that covers the regions of both Great Kourend and the Kebos Lowlands. It will work in the same way as other Achievement Diaries and full completion of this diary will be required for the Diary Cape. 
---
Elise, the taskmaster for this diary, will be found in the courtyard of Kourend Castle (a teleport to her will be added to the Diary Cape). 
---
Click here to read more about the Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary
---
The Forsaken Tower
---
For thousands of years, the Wintertodt has remained safely sealed behind the great Doors of Dinh. Alas, despite the best attempts of the Lovakengj smiths and the Arceuus mages, the doors are failing. Only Dinh himself knew the secrets behind the creation of these doors. Without his knowledge, there may be nothing to stop the Wintertodt escaping and bringing ruin upon Kourend. It is up to you to recover this knowledge. 
---
The Forsaken Tower is a brand-new novice quest that further develops on the story of the houses of Kourend. The quest can be started by speaking to Lady Vulcana Lovakengj in Lovakengj House. 
---

The Ascent of Arceuus
---
A long time ago, the citizens of Arceuus house gave up their human bodies and claimed immortality. This event was known as the Ascent of Arceuus and it marked the end of death within Arceuus house. Or so they believed. For the first time in a thousand years, a member of Arceuus house has fallen. You will need to solve the mystery of this death. However, time is of the essence and the fate of Arceuus house lies in your hands. 
---

Tweaks and Changes
---
As a result of playtesting efforts in preparation for the release of the Kebos Lowlands, we opted to make three changes to the content originally pitched. These are:
---
Protection from the burn effect in the Mount Karuulm dungeon without special boots was added as an Elite Diary reward
---
Redwood tree growth time at the Farming Guild was increased from 85 hours to 106.
---
The Shayzien helm effect will be added to the Slayer helmet upon request instead of the two items being combined. This is still done by talking to after completing the Hard Zeah Diary.
---
Competition Results

The competitions described in the Kebos Lowlands Progress Update post drew to a close late last week. The Old School team would like to thank everybody who submitted an entry - we've been impressed by your creative talents and original art styles! Here's a list of all the winners and their entries. Winners will be contacted about their prizes in the coming days.

Alongside the login screen competition, we challenged you guys to make a short video covering the story of Kourend so far. We received loads of fantastic entries and had a tough time whittling them down to three. However after drawing an impressive shortlist, we rated each one on their commentary and visuals. Congratulations to J1mmy whose winning entry is found at the top of this page! We also congratulate players John Jingler and Its Tab for placing second and third!

Other Changes

Here's a list of other changes taking place alongside the update:
---
The PvP rota is switching over to Period B.
---
Xeric's talisman no longer deducts charges when you attempt to teleport to a destination you've not unlocked.
---
An issue with the Hosidius Range where it was only burning the first fish has been fixed. The buff will now apply correctly.
---
Outside of Bounty Hunter worlds, killing a player with a Mysterious emblem of any tier will now reward the killer with a downgraded version of that emblem regardless of whether they have an emblem themselves.
---
The shade of green on the untrimmed Achievement diary cape has been adjusted to match the trimmed version.
---
A grammar error has been fixed in the Dragon Slayer II quest journal.
---
Unfeathered dragon bolts should now appear above dragonhide on the ground in Vorkath's lair.
---
A grammar error has been fixed in lazy cat dialogue.
---
The skill guide now reflects that ugthanki kebabs heal 19 rather than 18.
---
The name of the Zamorak spear has been corrected in the Attack skill-guide.
---
Attempting to teleport to one's POH when one's already inside it will 
---
Ha the first shield half I got I saved for ardy hard diary
---
No, I use the official client. Also, not an argument involved towards what I said. As always.
---
underrated comment imo
---
But what about the fairy ring that's closer than the Ecto tele and doesn't take an inv slot since you can equip the dramen staff?
---
there's the no quest iron man who seems pretty unknown. It might as well be an area limited iron man too bc there's so much shit u cant do without starting a quest first
---
:(
---
Impressive tbh. 
---
Also it's afk af at redwoods 
---
Attempting to teleport to one's POH when one's already inside it will now offer a warning in case this is an error.
---
Shayzien equipment crates now have a Destroy option when empty so that they don't clutter up the ground so much.
---
The name of the Anti-venom+ potion has been corrected in the Herblore skill-guide.
---
The Thermonuclear Smoke Devil now has a 1/96 chance of dropping hard clue scrolls.
---
The notifications about remaining charges on a Scythe of Vitur have been coloured to help them stand out.
---
The name of the Vanguard pet has been made more consistent as 'Vanguard' rather than 'Mini Vanguard'.
---
When Barrows kit degrades to its completely broken state, the notification now says this rather than merely saying it's degraded slightly.
---
Adding a rope to the Kalphite lair holes will now automatically trigger your character to descend the hole.
---
Guthix Rest tea now obeys the standard restrictions on healing items.

Aaaaand I'm getting ready for work. Too bad it wasn't last week when I was off still

Full Obsidian + Dagger + Berserker &gt; Strength gear and whip &gt; Dharoks
---
Once you've got higher combat stats (85+?) I believe dharoks is better than Obsidian.
---
Thanks chief
---
Well, what does he pray?
---
Honestly dude, 80 Range and 80 Mage is a solid starting point for Zulrah, and you get a ridiculous amount of money. 
---
It's insanely better than anything else people are telling you here, and you have enough Agility to use the shortcut as well. Get your Range + Mage up 3 levels each and you'll have a great time.
---
Convincing argument
---
No, bstaves are tied to alch price, they have a price floor.
---
[https://imgur.com/urClqfG](https://imgur.com/urClqfG)
---
Oddly satisfying
---
Zulrah is easier and more money at his stats.
---
Title lmfao.... unless you meant it then not so lmfao, ewww. 
---
And they changed their reputation in the course of several years, got Jmods (Jacmob etc) involved in the project. Jagex issued scrutiny and had close contacts with the OSB team. Not an argument.
---
Alarming how people believe anything they see at first sight, bunch of highschoolers.

You didn‚Äôt hide how much run you have left, prepare to be hacked bucko

Bloodthirsty pig!
---
I had to hold a single herb in my inventory for like 12 hours so he could give me the agility 4 potion I needed for the tai bwo trio. I'm pretty sure it's related.
---
Pathetic, should‚Äôve had 69 fps 
---
No, basically we'd get no content for 2 years.
---
And that isn't healthy for the game.
---
I'm an ironman
---
That intro video is so good, holy shit
---
&gt; How do you make every comment you write sound like a 300 pound autistic neck beard wrote it while smirking?
---
Simple, because you're biased and can't form an independent view of Serene.
---
What bait do you use for picking up traps?... Asking for a friend/research
---
Just put a simple H and you're good
---
My wireless (usb based) adapter. I literally just swapped out my adapter and then re-authed myself. Restarted the client like 5-10 times and it never asked for it again. Not really sure what happened but it seems to have fixed itself somehow? 
---
1850 kc to get that set in the first place lol :P
---
This pic genuinely pissed me off

noobs

Shut the fuck up serene.

Will this be the drama of the month?

A couple of seconds after Gambit expressed the name yeah, to derail the Q&amp;A into a discussion about the name..have you watched these streams the past couple of years..?
---
I like ya stockings ya dirty little trap x
---
From what i understand you need to wear stone boots to go into the hydras areas otherwise you take dmg every tick. When people are dying at hydras, they are running back to collect their items form the chest (like vorkath) without the boots and dying on their way back in, loosing everything in the chest
---
However they didn't indicate that dying would reset the loot in the chest.
---
I do know that that is an issue but for some reason that did not occur to me this time.
---
I guess its because its the first time the chest is in a dangerous place. rip lesson learned.
---
a terrible oversight from you lol
---
Natural selection.
---
People actually quests?
---
Clanmate just lost 90m due to this 
---
Item sink*
---
yes, but train on moss crabs. They have negative range def
---
You plant it in the farming guild and it lets you fight the Demi-Boss that has a chance at dropping the Bottomless compost bucket.
---
It doesn't insta kill you right? So why the hell do people not gtfo when they take damage lol.
---
Just don't die? 
---
Thinks every mod ever.

Jad task in inferno no but what about normal fight caves???
---
Ardy diaries are good for a free unlimited tele to an altar/fairy ring. (then free daily pure ess, tele to farm spot)
---
Lumby is good for a free energy refill a couple times a day.
---
(then tele to farm spot)
---
Varock is good for daily staves
---
(then tele to ge and more staves)
---
there's too many things to mention without any information on why you want to do them
---
How much you selling for?
---
Oh I see, you need them in the whole dungeon lmao
---
Jamflex at it again.
---
Meanwhile Woox is still trying to remember the fairy ring code
---
Oh fuck. What level is this boss do you know?
---
No. 
---
Would have probably worked yea, just warning about the bug
---
Also lost 250m

This was at first aided by the fact that the boots required to not take damage were constantly sold it.
---
where is this?

Untraceable? Like they are for hiding from the government? 
---
No, factually accurate information is what you just responded to with a bunch of insults. Low.
---
My herbs also got diseased in the farming guild patch. Unless I'm misinterpreting "There is a farmer there who will look after the patch for you.", then I think this is bugged. 
---
Holy shit
---
Kebos, lizardmen temple
---
They think they can reclaim it and then teleport out but the damage ticks are constant and they also don't bring any food. They underestimated the damage output prob. If they brought food it would be possible to do.
---
Do people not bring house tabs or something when recovering gear to get out afterwards? Just teleport when you hit 10hp instead of risking it :/

I feel for everyone who is being reminded of the death chest mechanics right now.

1. Why change a 'playstyle' (he didn't even mention anything about that, why do it yourself? that's off-topic) based on a storyline? He might like questing/dialogue/storylines. Are you insulting him by saying he's weak?

2. I never said you corrected him, but you're trying to take away from a meaningful and true comment by changing the subject to "average approach (efficient gameplay)" when it's not about that.

Since I always sustain a respectful tone and contribute with useful information or humorous takes in vast majority of cases. I'm contributing towards a healthy culture consisting of civility and high class. Calling out reprehensible users spouting insults for no reason and the people derailing every conversation because Serene initiated it, should be encouraged. 
---
Did they remove the one hour death timer? Haven't logged in for a few months. If you've still got an hour I don't understand why people are rushing in to the area without boots.

Go down into the dungeon and left

I don't know about you but a full time job and a life is better than a couple mill.

Died at hydra, went back but also lost my boots of stone. Thinking I could just run to chest and not die a second time but guess what, I died a second time. Lost 48m and my last dragon defender and fire cape. Totally deserved.
---
Don't go in WITHOUT the boots of stone. 
---
damn i need to do my runs quick!!
---
Sounds like you took that comment personally.

Panicked cause I got it after like 5 skips and was one of the first people inside. Wanted to get back to kill attempts and forgot about the damage.

It's not a glitch. The new Slayer master assigns you area specific tasks.

Theres no way 192 noted torstols is intentional.

The only drops I've seen that are that absurd are the herbs. Herbs from PvM is fine, but 150 noted Ranarrs seems a bit much.

These are obviously bugged though. No way they'd allow near 200 torstols in 1 drop.

Ah so I see. She tells you what to kill and where to kill. And killing the monsters that she tells you to, gives you a chance to get a drop from another table. Thats interesting.

Not sure if your still lvl 1 construction or not but I just focus on leveling up till you have 83 construction. Or at least till you can make some portals in your house for teles. I‚Äôm only lvl 60 construction and I have all the tele portals I need. As you get higher there are a bunch of benefits like the rejuvenation pool. 
---
Maybe they just got the formula wrong so they were too common. The quantity dropped might be correct but the rates might be too high.

Interesting... You maybe could do the fire caves, but the slayer helm would maybe only work for Jad itself, not for any of the other creatures. That would also mean that you wouldn't get the 25k xp, so there'd be little use in using it on 35 jads.
---
I doubt the above could work, but if it does then there might have been an oversight in the Inferno; maybe if the task works on jad alone it would work on Zuk alone as well. This would mean you'd have a decent DPS increase against Zuk without being on a 'zuk task' (which requires completion of the inferno in any case).

For an untradeable item? I think so, yes. But it's just cosmetic anyways so I suppose it depends on what you compare it to. Should you be comparing it to say Castle Wars armour? Or something like the master clue sack?

Honestly I think the golden tench is already enough of a way to show off your untradeables.

If bp really is better than dhcb then theres something seriously wrong

&gt;  Are you insulting him by saying he's weak?
---
Nop, you would never respond with these baseless assumptions if you weren't interacting with Serene.
---
&gt;Why change a 'playstyle'
---
Not attempting to "change" anything. I'm asking a genuine question of why he prioritizes the storyline over efficiency. And what in particular inspired him into that route. 
---
Oh yeah. I suppose so. 
---
Does it have a morph option
---
Serene I would very much appreciate it if you shut the fuck up. You're all over this thread and being very annoying
---
I'm guessing this is from the extra drop table and not wyrms themselves right?
---
Probably, but they did go to the effort to give each patch this qualifier which is why I thought it applied.
---
Thanks :)
---
It's an example of this classic experiment -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PvBo75PDo
---
Ah didn‚Äôt realize it was cosmetic
---
Yup, you can cannon the Drakes
---
People pking then after they die or something fear up for zulrah forgetting they are on pvp
---
Someone might have dropped it themselves or died
---
Hopefully. Balancing wise I don't expect it is actually an issue. But it is kinda like a 100 Dragon Platelegs thing; it may be 100x rarer than 1 Dragon Platelegs but it feels weird to drop such a bulk amount. So I'd much rather see the herb drops reduced to 1/5th or 1/10th and being made that much more common too if needed.
---
I agreed. I was expecting them to be at least 100-300m. They cheap but do require 80 defence to wear and Dragon Slayer 2 completed to make them.
---
I‚Äôve seen someone sell for 130m so far. So I‚Äôd say right around 100m currently. Just guessing. 
---
True, but a small part of me still wishes to experience these unique occasions; IMO there is more to it than just raw monetary gain
---
I really enjoyed the video! Way to go!

Heads up, there's a typo in the article:

&gt;In addition to being a useful stat-boosting food, 10 Dragonfruit can be squeezed into a vial which can be used on the vents in Mount Karuulm to beome bottled Dragon's breath. This can be used to **fully charge the Dragonfire shield and similar shields instantly**.

---
Had a lot of potential mechanics wise yeah
---
No, it has become slightly rarer to get a purple chest now, i.e. you need more points on average. 
---
These changes cancels out so the chance of getting a specific item is the same as before.
---
Dragonfruit saplings wouldnt humidify either.
---
Also it's not a bug but it annoys me on the geomancy page that i now have to scroll downwards to check the farming guild's status. If they could swap that with my arm's patch (protected) I would be very happy

That‚Äôs fucked up
---
Again, multiple baseless assumptions while ignoring my other points.
---
Step up your game, it's horrible at the moment. Saying that I'm the one trolling right now is pretty pathetic from you and uncalled for, because it's not an argument against my other points. Why even bother responding? I want to understand your point of view but you just backed yourself into a corner with that statement.
---
So people panic selling raids items are idiots then?
---
Preference I guess, I have about 1.5k Sire KC because I enjoyed the more complex fights.
---
Yeah I hope they crash even harder so I can afford one for vork lol
---
Yeah, see my chat, I hopped until I was kicked for too many login attempts.
---
OOF
---
Lost 500m doing the same :)
---
Yeah, I get that they‚Äôre limited to a certain player group/build, but we are talking bis here. If they were bis range gloves, probs would have been 100-300m lmao
---
Different nests man
---
If by many hours you mean 45 minutes then yes many hours
---
This is fresh
---
Yes, people are getting similar drops on other tasks from Konar as well.
---
Just got 15 Ely's from a black demon
---
Sire is definitely a clunky and annoying boss, but it doesn't take a huge amount of effort once you get the hang of it. The worst aspects of the boss to me is that it absorbs at least 2 hits every kill, and doesn't reward you with slayer xp equal to the amount of damage you have to deal because of the respiratory systems.
---
Every monster (IIRC) has access to what‚Äôs called the Rare drop table. It‚Äôs the same for every monster and usually the drops aren‚Äôt that good. If you ever see ‚ÄúX recieved a drop: uncut sapphire‚Äù that‚Äôs from the RDT. 
---
With konar tasks every monster you kill on tasks you have a chance at a new RDT with a lot of good drops on it. So people are getting 2m drops from kurasks and greater demons and shit 
---
Rip me.... stolll have in bank from 160m 
---
Is it really LOOOOOOOOOOOOL!! thought?
---
LOL sounds like a challenge 
---
This motivated me more than anything else game has to offer.
---
HAHAH this is pure greatness!
---
It wasn't that funny...
---
Tell the guy who go it on 3KC to alch himself 
---
Blowpipe is better with Rune darts or better than ruby dragon bolts on  DHCB
---
It's held by a npc. I think you have more than an hour with that mechanic. 
---
&gt;	Maybe the game generates what nest you get from the initial mole skin drop, not when you trade it in.
---
This is 100% not the case. The game generates the nest when the nest is obtained. There‚Äôs no way for the mole skin to ‚Äústore‚Äù a corresponding nest. 
---
What is 100% more likely is they forgot to give Wyson the new nests, they‚Äôre still the ‚Äúold‚Äù item ID. 
---
I haven't played RS3 since While Guthix Sleeps came out but from what I've heard the lore since then has been "and then Zaros threw hands".  Kinda makes me want to catch up the quests but it's RS3
---
According to Woox (the GOAT), no. Blowpipe with rune darts is better than DHCB.
---
Yikes, disgrace. You'd never be tolerated in any civilized society. 
---
Well really the only option to having Tbow not BIS would be decimating the monsters Magic level. So maybe a brid fight where the Hydra uses melee and range would make BP better than TB 
---
Lmao no you don't
---
noob
---
Never posted before guess cant use gyazo man dont have to be rude.
---
What did it sell for?
---
Anything with a npc or chest holding your stuff does that. Grotesque guardians do it too. 
---
Ok I liked this one
---
Yes.
---
Nooo I glanced and this photo and went kek then I'm like oh fuck that's Bomboy, well good thing classes started this morning I guess. Hope you get your shit back but I doubt jamflex will

For this to work passwords will have to be stored in plain text. I like the idea but it will be dangerous
---
You're on a monarch slayer task it's bugged
---
I think this would just hurt really bad, but wouldn‚Äôt cause any serious damage. She has way too much cushion (fat) on her body, so even though she carries a lot of weight, the time of collision would be very long, leading to a pretty low average force of impact.
---
no.
---
First 99 is an untrimmed skill cape, it automaticly becomes trimmed once you get a second 99 from that point on all capes will be trimmed.
---
There is a way to keep your orignal untrimmed cape by doing the drop telegrab trick
---
Go to the Molch dungeon.

Already hotfixed

Imagine not having Runescape mobile.

Just got 171 torstol from jelyes. 1,9 m.
---
It‚Äôs more so like 1-2mil sometimes. Especially rough considering most slayer tasks are 125 monsters long.
---
No problem meng :). Gl in Kebos
---
And you guys think I have enough... :)
---
No that dumb
---
Spent over a thousand points and didn't get a hydra task. Guess I won't be able to participate in this updates content for a while. Idk why it has to be luck dependent for the first day. Players shouldn't be barred from fighting the boss because of bad rng. It's such bullshit. I got 95 slayer yesterday specifically for this and now I have to go do possibly several more days of slayer before I even get the chance to have a hydra task. Is it just me, or is that not good game design for updates that just come out? Yeah, I get that task requirements keep a boss profitable over time, but for the first day, it's a little unfair for some players to have to waste all their points for nothing while others get it the first few tries. We should be able to pay like 100k to get a hydra task on the day of release.
---
Is it not stupid that, because of bad rng, I am not allowed to have fun with the new content and am forced to go do other slayer tasks for several days to get points again? Like wtf.
---
Maybe you should try to use a middleman?
---
Are you using the official Reddit app or some other shitty one? I'm on Reddit Sync and I can zoom in and see full resolution.
---
These drops are on the wiki for the global loot table. I don't think it's a bug...
---
I saw this a few days ago. This is repost?
---
Also, if you do enough damage to the red phase, he will skip flame walls entirely and go right to 4th. 
---
doubt anyone who just started pvp knows how to triple eat or even does it a lot, it might actually help the noobs
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
hydras are failed experiments when trying to create dragons
---
If it was easier to die wouldn‚Äôt that make it easier for a new player to kill? I get what you‚Äôre saying but think of the other side
---
Nope, way better than the kraken/smoke devil bosses that require minimal effort.
---
Coming from /r/all I can confidently say that I know about half of those words. 
---
That is the whole game. This is nothing new.
---
New slayer Master has a special drop table that randomly drops if you're doing the task. 
---
Because (hypothetically) if they did store a loot table variable, they wouldn‚Äôt stack in the bank. Remember unid herbs? They all had different item data because they corresponded to different clean versions. 
---
Fun fact, when you open a seed nest, that seed is determined when you open the nest, not when it‚Äôs obtained. 
---
Inb4 rollback and now you're out of a job. Not worth btw.
---
I heard woox squats over a mirror 
---
No1 cares ur iron 
---
Challenge accepted. I'll be waiting. 
---
I dunno... I sort of like that design, that you need to kill things in their original, intended, old school location.
---
I haven't played RS3 in a while, but on there mole nests are different from regular tree nests. Not sure how it works on osrs
---
Where can I see Konar‚Äôs drop table?
---
No one likes you
---
Seems to be a bit of progress before you got to mort tbh still cool though
---
yea vut u still have to use combat for the farmin boss
---
I'm glad to see the massive loss of gp
---
Aw cmon, why you gotta be like that? Let the plebs die. It's entertainment for the masses
---
Yeah they were, stone/granite boots and I think devout boots too. Not too sure on the last one though 
---
Copy and pasted my comment from a previous [thread:](https://np.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aeis78/quick_hydra_guide/edpmba3/)
---
Here's the stats with the Hydra's defensive bonuses as well. (260 magic attack/100 general defense, with 150 magical defense and 45 ranged defense)
---
[Blowpipe with rune darts](https://i.imgur.com/bf2LHOg.png) gets the edge over DHCB with ruby dragon bolts (e)
---
Blowpipe really shines when DHCB users switch to diamond bolts (e), where the [DPS is about 13% better.](https://i.imgur.com/EVa7O9C.png)
---
4 hours is above drop rate. 5 hours is average. Better plan for 12 hours in case one of you gets unlucky
---
Why would you not just go buy the boots? And then dropping the DWH?
---
Seriously, every time someone tries to have a respectful debate with you, you call them either call them stupid, a troll, or tell them they're objectively wrong by virtue of your own opinion. And then you wonder why most people just tell you to stfu, wake up to yourself.
---
Sounds like they need to work out the bot detection then, because OSHD graphics are tenfold better than graphic smoothing. JS
---
DHCB works against it, but it pretty meh tbh
---
Why do you orbit every female streamer especially new ones are you trying to groom them? 
---
Just add the heads as spikes on the Helmet, like you can see in my high effort edit.

I hate it lmao.

Hi Zoolander

The looks is a little clucky, I'll give you that... BUT, it's so much easier to click on everything.

I died too man the imbues for slayer helm and ring is gonna be boring af idc bout gp as much also lost recolour head lmao

New item sink lmao

You have as long as you want, hahaha

Thx :) on a Zulrah task from Konar rn and this could help me. 
---
G E K O L L O N I S E E R D
---
It may not even be a bug but the team forgetting about kraken boss.
---
Drops from monsters go on a square by them, kraken's drops are specifically coded to drop underneath the player. If you run to the entrance as it dies and note the drop spawn under where you are as the boss dies. You wouldn't be able to reach it otherwise, as shown here. Since this isn't drop the kraken's droptable it isn't having the same rules applied.
---
IIRC the same issue presented for supply drops in DMM.

What is doing ardy and how afk is it? Either way extremely dangerous. I get tempted in traffic I'll admit however you need to fight that. So many lives at risk over a game. Cmon people!!

Tbh I've just had insane rng on my acc lol

Otherwise I used to make my money by doing mindless grinds like blue drags.
---
A group is about to be triggered.
---
Blowpipe is better dps but the mechanics are easier with a dhcb. Dhcb is already BIS at vorkath, there‚Äôs no need to change the way it works at hydra because hydra seems like it‚Äôll be less gph than vorkath unless you have tbow.

I cheated in high school. I also graduated college and got a job in my field above average salary right after graduation. How exactly does cheating correlate to being a failure?

Sold it for 200m for all who were wondering

are you making fun of my high effort edit ???
---
If that's true, I think it's a bug. It was supposed to be 50 volcanic ash.
---
honestly nobody even cares about farming, PVMscape is what matters
---
Always appreciated ü§ì
---
Preach it, Serene.
---
No, you're right. After seeing these 2m drops at slayer, I kinda have become discouraged to use farming. 
---
The more that's added to slayer at this point, the more soulless other skills feel to me. 
---
You should make them pay you in GP to keep quiet about it. 
---
Nice you got some cash before the nerf
---
Wc guild. Everywhere else is obsolete.

Wish I listened, didn't take long at all to rebound wow

Wow i thought this would be fixed by now

I got this but I couldn't figure which boss to kill.  Tried mole, chaos ele and graardor none of them counted so i cancelled.
---
I'll check it now, got a load composting
---
Could just be rng but I got 4 more onyx bolt drops than you in 40 kills. I do agree with you though the gph seems like it‚Äôll be lacking at hydra 
---
Cry me a fucking river pal 
---
Same thing here 
---
Mechanic still the same. Also the same at GG's so so you might get the dick stain from abberant specters if you don't bring a nose peg.

Are the existing flowers a 100% reduction for allotments currently? I thought it was only partial. But yes, every herb patch disease free is too OP.

I feel like I‚Äôm playing DMM with these global drop table drops 
---
They‚Äôre fixing this right? 
---
Lost 70m but worst part is having to imbue slayer helm again fuck
---
Why did he drop his stamina pot and dwh?
---
Definitely could just be RNG, but even with 4 extra onyx bolt drops, still lower gp/h than afk tbow zulrah.
---
My problem isn't with Blowpipe being better dps, I understand that blowpipe is harder to use and should have better dps. I just think it shouldn't have better dps with Adamant Darts which are 2 tier lower than what you use with Twisted Bow or DHCB.

Kill takes around 2 minutes with best gear. 
---
I don't think there's any requirement to enter. Wyrms, drakes and hydras have 64, 84 and 95 Slayer respectfully but there are other monsters like sulphur lizards which only require 40ish. There's also fire giants and hell hounds there too. There's a load of other skilling things in the area too.

I havnt since I typically do my bird runs on mobile. I don't know if you do any kind of dev on runelite but if it would benefit you I could do some tests and report back on the results.

Lmao I love that first guys reaction. In real life he was probably hella confused.
---
Yeah I saw that, was really strange. Maybe his friends messing around?
---
Currently my block list is set up for XP gains not GP gains.
---
The harpoons are the only big thing. The Herbs and coal are from konar.

The issue is that you screwed yourself over by:
---
* not selling your member items before it ran out.
---
* not having a spare bond.
---
* not having enough cash.
---
* refusing to purchase membership with IRL money.
---
You motherfucker

wow so 100,000 catches for the fish sack?

Sometimes you just get unlucky. I went over 1m slayer xp without a single hellhound task while trying to do Cerberus.

I purchased membership with real money.

I have enough money to buy a bond.

I didnt want ro sell those items becoz i needed them for when I get membership again.
---
I think Jagex screwed me.
---
Man oh man, do you not remember waaay back when when the RDT got updated and 2000 Saradomin Brews was a possible drop?
---
And they went balls out on birds nests because "it was destroying their value"
---
ROFLMAO
---
I've easily played 100+ hours in the last week just grinding points and money. Managed yo get a dhcb for 107m for the great rebuild haha
---
f
---
i'd laugh for being stupid and go on the rebuild like I did last time I fucked up and lost my bank
---
Or we can make a boss that revolves around getting lucky on the uniques instead of shutting out constant gp/h. That would be cool. 
---
I had this happen too. Had to back fast and get telegrabs. Managed to get it though
---
Look at the north west corner of the kebos lowlands area (swamp bit). There‚Äôs a small area that looks like a magnifying glass - go there and dig
---
Did you mean vorkath? It is better money than zulrah
---
BiS for meele, but not for range / mage.
---
He panicked thinking he could save his items if he died with nothing on him.
---
Fucking hell, that was gonna be bomb for my grind to 86. Oh well, it's not like I'm getting 90 Slayer anytime soon.
---
Pretty sure there's like 18k possible combinations
---
I just got 200k worth of dragon dart tips from a fucking jelly so you tell me fam.
---
I've always thought the way drop tables are currently setup between slayer only bosses and not are kinda backwards. You'd think the bosses where you can only do them  limited amount of time would be the ones to have the consistently good drop table and the ones that you can farm should have drop tables like the current slayer bosses.
---
It was funny until he decided to quote the poster with the caption 'LMAOOO' like a fucking rock smashing caveman because his life is too sheltered to experience any sort of verbal comedy from his social circle/peers.

3 exams, 1 team project, 2 individual projects, thesis, work. Fuck us right?
---
Perhaps at the time, as someone who is still developing mentally. Is that point you want to make? Developing students who cheat at times lack integrity and have exhibited ethical failure?
---
Because Cerberus shared some of its D Bones with Hydra. But yah, they could probably change that.

is there a day for this yet?
---
Defo didn't make it
---
Well you're a cyclist so your opinion is irrelevant.
---
Because not everyone enjoys using it? Slapping down an auto kill machine cheapens the skill and the achievement IMO. 
---
i mean if you look at knife throwers in real life, often they hold the knife by the blade to throw.
---
Probably. 
---
The mechanics are pretty cool and it‚Äôs a very nice looking boss, but you aren‚Äôt missing anything other than the tiny chance at getting hydra claw while it‚Äôs still worth something 
---
Back when d med and d sq were BIS
---
I mean, if it is unintended or if it has negative effects on the market, they should nerf. But yah, a few posts for large herb drops alone isn't a reason to nerf.
---
It will stay around 120m-130m current price just like it was before the hydra was teased.
---
Thisüëè was üëè voted üëè for üëè in üëè the üëè poll
---
Many thanks!
---
im 91 slayer, about to be 92, so yes i can technically pie up to damage hydra. however i will be waiting for the hype to end and the items to stabilize and get 95 slayer in the process. 
---
If at least 20,000 players are doing slayer and 2 million monsters are being killed assuming there is 100 monsters per task, this is bound to happen, and to those who is commenting here that got a rare drop, at least provide a screenshot that you really got one.
---
I mean, this has been a known thing for a long time :p this isn't exactly an unknown issue at all. 
---
Lance is already below 120m and gloves Ive heard are 20m. The rest of the uniques are useless so are way below that. I don't expect better than Vorkath as 4m+ p/h is ridiculous but for the requirement of 95 slayer, the need to be on task plus a higher kill time compared to dhcb vork (will be lower as Lance is apparently BiS) Its fair to say the drop table is very under powered.
---
Ironman btw
---
It is a complete joke how the best way to get most resources is to PvM.
---
read that as you got 100k teak planks as i was like what the fuck is that.
---
If you claimed kingdom after todays update they can drop the new seeds. Got two dragonfruit and a redwood seed myself.
---
Cheapens the skill? I didn't know there was skill involved in clicking a Slayer monster lol.
---
And how does it devalue achievement, if the achievement has always been gauged by whether you have a cannon or not..? Slayer ehp has always been Cannon.
---
Foil hat theory:
---
They intended to kill farming to push people to vote yes on warding to make farming desirable again. 
---
It‚Äôs literally there to help with improvement of rates lol???? Complain back to 2010 when it was actually a issue. Go buy your broke ass a cannon
---
Not to mention zulrah takes way more practice and time to learn where as Vorkath is extremely braindead. At least in my experience.
---
I'd just like to point out that it'd be nice if we could have some more decent gp/h skilling methods... Skilling is low effort compared to a lot of PvM content, yes. But there's plenty of tedious skilling methods that's no gp/h where there are AFK PvM content that's way too much gp/h with almost no effort. Please, some balancing for us whom enjoy skilling!
---
the very definition of cope
---
What I asked was if she's also able to assign specific bosses or only the "pick the boss yourself" tasks.
---
shut the fuck up
---
I think she tells you to change back.
---
I wish I could give this comment the light and value it deserves.
---
I wonder how they'd feel knowing their own hubris cost them everything?
---
Not that I like them feeling bad, mind you. I'm not in it for the Shaudenfraude. I'm in it to see if anyone learns from their mistake and takes their time a little more. Their eagerness lead to the loss of _Tens, if not hundreds_ of Millions of GP and their personal time invested, all because of a bit of impatience.
---
That must be a new hiscore on the halliday score board 
---
thanks! will try this 
---
then you get a drop of 193 ranarrs while they die running back to the chest
---
Actually a fucking loser LMAO
---
yes, mining gems is indeed skilling
---
How so?
---
hopefully when he crashes he only kills himself and not any innocent bystanders
---
Why do people complain about GOOD things? Who cares if it "devalues skilling"? O.o
---
I don't get it, are there people who skill for profit? To do what with? PvM? Then just do slayer for the new RDT for profit, problem solved.
---
I personally don't think that skills need to be profitable. They should be a grind to get max cape and that's about it. At this point I'm worried that this new drop table will be nerfed before I even get home to experience it.
---
I think drops that feel cool to get are great from the game from the perspective of someone who plays it to max. I don't really give a fuck if my effortless herb/birdhouse runs or my WC or fishing exp is profitless... 
---
Ripperino
---
I don't really like that ranged is the best again. For all the end game bosses, range is either best or essential.
---
I don't understand why they should make new content more easily accessible for people who receiving it is RNG based. This game is literally all RNG, deal with it.
---
5 fires and 1 nat waiting for you, you know the drill.
---
When im pressingen look for uppdate it says its up to date yes.
---
Lucker noob
---
Barrage tasks are broken af and you profit even taking into account cost of cannonballs + runes.
---
Did you click on a dxpw stream?
---
Palm trees and magic trees held their price because they were meta for Farming EHP.
---
That is no longer the case.
---
Now farming will be one of the easiest, cheapest, and fastest 99s due to the cheap palm seeds.
---
It sell what for?
---
You're correct in that they went full retard with the resource drops, however the 2500 saradomin brew drop was confirmed by Mod Mark to be a hoax, and was never an available drop at any stage. One faked screenshot and suddenly everyone had a friend of a friend who got it.

Yeah no I wish lol. Then I would agree that it‚Äôs broken lol. It‚Äôs pretty well balanced now it terms of loot prices. I legit never thought I‚Äôd walk away from a hellhounds task with profit but her I am halfway through my task with 170k of rare noted crap from them
---
It coulda been much worse friend, think on the bright side it won‚Äôt happen again!
---
Still doesn't let me put back magic secateurs without unequipping them 0/10
---
no tick eating vorkath without losing attacks either
---
Not disease free 
---
No, im not stupid. Ive been in the tech/gaming world for a long time. I dont click stupid stuff. Only ever used Osbuddy or Runelite and Mobile. I think my computer was RAT‚Äôd. 
---
That's one expensive seed. I hope it doesn't get diseased and dies.
---
You don't have to kill the Alchemical Hydra for the diary task, you can just boost from 90 as usual and kill one of the regular hydras.
---
New rare drop table is good and very fun... =/ 
---
Why so much complaint over this.
---
So...exactly like the reaper in rs3
---
Yea. You can also tele out
---
Serves you right for saving them and trying to exploit it u casual trash
---
I meant cheapen the skill as in Slayer, this game is about a grind and if you have something that circumvents it by doing the whole task for you automatically then it's just not the same. 
---
I personally only use it sometimes where it makes sense which I think is the way it should be, a few tasks here and there require a cannon. I don't want to get to the point where I have to cannon everything though or it gets more OP than it already is.
---
140-150m
---
I sure hope that's just a bug.
---
idk, ive never done melee olm since i have DHCB. i just assumed you could hit it with melee. however if you cant even hit the head with melee then that just makes the weapon even more useless. 
---
So you‚Äôre the guy missing 300 gold ore from gargoyles task 
---
w t f
---
500 worlds are already a huge step up. What improvements do 750 ones offer on top?
---
25m feels too cheap. 
---
Jagex really needs to let me store 1k spades in that Leprechaun
---
And we get the new drop table while we do so! Overall amazing update for slayer, should really help with the overall GP to 99 slay.
---
For iron men, yeah. For most others nope! 
---
Sweet can't wait to check it out when I get home
---
If you set up your blocks right, they are a fairly high percentage chance.  Though I will admit I just got my first occult drop on my main at 98 slayer and I don't recall skipping any smoke devil tasks.  I wasn't doing the boss though.
---
Yeah because females have less muscles. Common sense.
---
wait it doesn't? wow no wonder I can't calculate my levels lol
---
Blowpipe could literally hold value at well over 100m if it came into the game slower. If zulrah drop table was heavily nerfed to the point where you profit pretty much only from the uniques like gwd then it could work. Obviously it would never happen though.
---
lmao
---
Oh god no
---
Yeah!!! I can‚Äôt believe they are cathering towards then
---
While I agree, 192 torstols is far too many. Idk how rare that actually is but it seems like 30 would still be a good amount to be happy about and making a larger more balanced drop table with fewer super rare drops would have been better design imo.
---
The reason skilling isn't as profitable is because loads of the items are given out in pvm, people won't do slower money makijg methods when easy things like Vorkath exist. 
---
I don't
---
???
---
cause they dont have the level requirements to get them
---
Ooh. Is there a new loot table posted. Looks op
---
yup!
---
this is for the new drop table end of game gn.....
---
Serene I think you bring valid points to a relevant post, don‚Äôt shut up
---
Is that changed for everyone?
---
I have gotten 2 drops in 2 tasks so far. 1 Bronze Dragon Task (33 iirc) and 1 Fire Giant Task (around 160).
---
66 Teak Planks and ~200 raw sharks
---
Contract?
---
Pming you? This is normal
---
You should really check the wiki, but generally speaking, the eye works as the first piece of three (much like a totem) to combine together and get a brimstone ring.
---
If we had more skilling methods similar to minnows and less resources from slayer/bossing I think we'd be on the right track
---
You use RuneLite and don't scale ur UI, wtf?
---
Boaty McBoatface is now a Runescape character :D
---
Isn't Yanielle the right place for this?
---
Yeah, Crafting cape is an apron and tele, but Farming cape only had a 5% yield bonus prior to this update. I just think teleporting us inside the guild rather than outside is something to consider.
---
spending hundreds of hours training a woodcutting skill with no actual wood to show for it but hey here's a cool cape
---
no thanks
---
Idk how rare that is. If it is once in 13m slayer xp sure for that massive amount but it seems like rdt is very common
---
Omfg sweet im 1 lvl off boosting for it then 
---
new Farming Contracts in the Farming Guild
---
Missed the new fairy ring 
---
I feel you. My first-ever farming guild harvest was a dead ranarr - using ultracompost to boot.
---
yes pre buff sorry
---
&gt;Some tasks need a cannon (dags, kalhpites, suqahs, scabarites)
---
&gt;Some tasks may be slightly better with a cannon for XP at the increase of cost (Fire giants, hellhounds, spectres)
---
&gt;Some tasks are uncannonable
---
This is literally how the game is right now. 
---
IK, but it doesn't have to be that way. People don't like skilling because it's in a bad state, if it weren't it would be enjoyed more.
---
 so far ive got this
---
lantadyme contract: 60k
---
poison ivy: 150k +1 hespori
---
The 2500 may have been a joke, but the hundreds of brews in a single drop wasn‚Äôt. I personally got a drop of 200-ish on a task once. 
---
Eh, no chance of barraging Nechraels and 50%(?) chance of not being able to barrage Dust Devils. If you're still trying to level I think Duradel/Neive is better still. 
---
I just got 90k from an easy contract, I'm guessing one of us got lucky/ unlucky.
---
Think he means RDT being good like it was in 2011.
---
Still not amazing imo but this is much better

How does it work

Source?
---
Easier to click on mobile
---
No get the favor it's fast as fuck
---
Can't wait to get this. Already got a farming contract going.
---
Yeah I haven't ever tried to hit it with melee but I'm fairly certain it's out of range. Really does make the Lance super niche 
---
Where else should they go? Most the time cyclists can hit speeds for 15-20 mph, which is very unsafe for anywhere but the road...
---
it shows how demasulised you are
---
No, but I've tried them out for other things. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Thanks 
---
So they take up most the road and sidewalk... How big are the bikes near you?
---
Presumably super compost, I doubt they'd make volcanic ash dead content that easily
---
You walk in and it attacks range or mage. it does 3 attacks of that then does a poison splat attack then swaps to the other style. There's 3 big 'vent' things on the ground that shoot out colored acid. For the first phase you lure it on the red square which lowers its defense. Then it swaps to a blue phase at 75% and you lure it onto the green square to lower its defenses. It keeps doing the 3 attacks alternating but then in blue it throws out 4 electric things that hone onto you kinda like rune dragons. Then at 50% it swaps to red phase and you lure it onto the big blue square. After 3 attacks it shoots a bunch of fire on the ground to trap you in a corner then it shoots 1 fire ball that travels on the ground towards you just like the fire at olm, so you just walk away from it. At 25% it turns into a black 'Jad' phase where it does range then mage alternating hurting you a lot, and after 3 attacks it does another poison attack like the first phase. I hope this explains it okay.
---
The Guildmaster gives you an assignment to grow something.
---
You grow the thing.
---
The Guildmaster gives you a seed box as a reward
---
From the bugfix section of update: "An issue with the Hosidius Range where it was only burning the first fish has been fixed. The buff will now apply correctly."
---
So if I had to guess, that is probably why you're burning more.
---
Its a shame they look like abselute shit
---
haha you already know 
---
Nice screenshot
---
Could you guys explain? Hydra drop table sucks imo
---
As someone who plays end game content and has everything except a TBow I find this equally frustrating. I agree with you too, every piece of content that comes out is op‚Äôs by TBow, would be nice to have a decent alternative.
---
sounds like blowpipe is the next best option so I guess we‚Äôre stuck with that until we get a lance..!
---
Probably I cba to think like a normie
---
Just get the favor...
---
"I don't want to do the requirements remove them I'm lazy"
---
&gt;No i dont fall for that stuff.
---
&gt; Believe it was a RAT or Keylogger
---
The only way to get a RAT or Keylogger is by falling for something you shouldn't have clicked on.
---
It‚Äôs not a solution but it could prevent some people from RS‚Äôing while driving, but they should have a message you have to click off of when you start playing confirming you‚Äôre not driving. It‚Äôll stop at least some
---
Make mage relevant? What? It‚Äôs required for raids 1 and 2, close to the best at zulrah, best at kraken...mage isn‚Äôt irrelevant at all
---
drakes are dogshit, the task takes way too long unless you use a cannon, it took sick nerd 3 hours to do the task while 1t flicking
---
Way less competition for combat or mining.  I remember the edgeville dungeon hillgiants being packed on the 500 worlds.
---
I still dont know what the fuck a birdhouse is
---
!remindme 12 hours 
---
They just ride in the middle of the road, swap to sidewalk, come back out into the road out of nowhere, etc. Use your head.
---
Balanced 
---
I wonder how much total exp this would equate too
---
Underrated comment. 
---
should be mobile only
---
I opened 800 fucking nests and not a single new seed :(
---
Pretty sure the uniques aren't priced correctly and are worth way more than they say
---
Has there been any post showing what's officially contained within the new table And what the chances are etc?
---
Gz, how much did it sell for?
---
Think we're starting to see it stabilize around that 135M price everyone was pointing to pre-Kebos.
---
There's some other tasks he can give, such as kill every boss, but no "kill any boss" as far as I remember.
---
As previously said before. Only thing it could of been from is Movies which ive done for years and always took the precautions. Trusted users. Verified Users. But what are the chances RS gets targeted from that.. 
---
Surprise! People like to play OSRS for different things. Some people like to skill. Some like to PK. Some, like you, like to PvM! There needs to be a balance because OSRS isn't an MMO *just* for players who like to PvM. That's not what makes OSRS stand out compared to the rest of the MMOs. OSRS is special because it can be played with so many playstyles.
---
The problem arises though when one playstyle is clearly and obviously better than the others. Especially if said playstyle has become completely self reliant, e.g it no longer needs support from the other playstyles. That's bad because said other playstyle will eventually starve off, leaving us with yet another cookie cutter basic bitch MMO that's only about PvMing.
---
Irritate your eye just long enough to make a convincing case of pink eye. It's my scumbag LPT
---
The community essentially accepts botting skills, whereas they typically do not bot pvm. Jagex has noticed this, but will not ever say so. You can't really blame them.
---
This is in fact the solution. You need to dig around the fire.
---
Hell yeah, I just don't get the hate. I'd be perfectly happy with 30, hell, even 10! I just like getting bonus stuff because it feels fun 
---
For those outoftheloop, no. That wouldn't really be OP. Jad doesn't grant that high of an experience rate in Slayer in comparison to what available if you barrage and generally slay in an efficient manner.
---
Also, the minimal combat xp from Jad tasks are terrible. Which devalues the whole idea as well. Wouldn't be worth it, if you'd be able to choose Jad in this instance.
---
Vorkath has as opposed to Zulrah end game requirements
---
It's part of konars drops. All his tasks have a seperate drop table added
---
Well that's fine, I was thinking they maybe made some new area where it's multi and has all the slayer mobs previously in singles which is what I was fearing. I definitely don't want Slayer to devolve to "you MUST cannon everything", that'd just make the skill boring. 
---
Personally, I like the activity. I wish it was a decent way to train WC or had some other redeeming qualities. But getting the Goat Tuber and even collecting the Trading Sticks is a pain.
---
Grotesque guardians also have a chest like this

Is there a better method for dodging the lightning. That‚Äôs the only thing costing me a lot of food at the moment and I just can seem to get the timing down for jt

[This is the Tweet you're referring to](https://twitter.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1083338777920262144) and if you have any reading comprehension, you'd know it doesn't even mention the drop table.
---
There‚Äôs a bug in the drop table with the new update so the new slayer monsters are dropping stupid amounts of herbs right now.  Like 150 noted herbs a kill.

shut up serene, you know nothing.
---
I think around 135m... missed the boat hard. 
---
Not at all false. I used to RAT people all the time when I was younger. I had YouTube videos with download links in the description. People would run the virus (which had a copy of RSBot binded to it) and I'd wait for them to log in and see what they had and if I'd take their items.
---
[One of my YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGRmK8ioiH4)
---
There is no reason to nerf the global drop table if it is actually exceedingly rare.
---
No. You'll need to irritate it enough to imitate your body's immune system response to eye infection. A minor irritation like getting dirt or sand in your eye is all it takes. 
---
What's the new ring do
---
Think hes on the main floor.
---
Of course I can 
---
When he did the calculations in thought I saw him do it on blue dragons. Not sure if that matters or not he was rushing the edits. To get back to killing hydra
---
Yeah no, Saradomin Brews are dropping because the boss is way easier than people expected and nobody needs brews to kill it.
---
We shouldnt know what butplugs look like...
---
Thought about it some more, I can't log on at the moment but maybe multiple pearls drop on the 1/100 roll.
---
Exactly. Calling it dead content would be a disservice to dead content everywhere else in the game.
---
The power went out

Hope you can forgive me &lt;3

You should be banned for preaching to the choir. Bold opinion bro

No worries just messin with ya :)

Indeed!

Update #3: Still locked out of my account. I just tried tweeting all the members of the help team. Maybe that will get something resolved? Who knows. 
---
Epic drop table 
---
Lots of Bloods/Astrals/Deaths.
---
This fashionscape is some of the best I‚Äôve seen in a really long time! Outstanding !
---
What have they tweeted?
---
Back in the day of RS3 the same shit happened when they updated the rarw drop table
---
? Ok?
---
The npc (can‚Äôt think of his name) in the shop next to the poh portal un-notes bones and other items for 5gp each, making this the best location for prayer.
---
Huh?
---
They could just click off the message and then start driving and playing though. I suggested to Mod Roq in his tweet about this earlier that the OSRS app should have an accelerometer installed on it and not allow people who are going over 20 miles an hour to play. Itll fuck over passengers and those who use it on trains but it seems like it has to be done with the amount of people who seem to not care at all about their's and others' safety.
---
One of the topcomments in an hour

Shut up serene.

You spend hundreds of hours less on it.

Thought it would sold for much more tbh.

Pop culture references are one of Runescape's pastimes, it's just this one is more contemporary

Did some calculations on gp per drop/hour too, this is without calculating supplies used though, which at a rough estimate would be like 600-800k an hour

&gt; Loot from 100 hydra kills, 5k each for bones too so with no unique drops it's around 120-130k per kill on average. If you get 25-30 kills per hour hydra is actually still like 3-3.5m per hour. Hydra tail sold for 1m xd

I cannoned most of my slayer (also did nechs, dust devils, and smoke devils by barraging).

I got most of my range xp from cannon, ~10-11m xp

Didn't keep track of my cannonball usage, but that much xp should be around 450-500k cannonballs

I'm sick of kids like you complaining about tbow being OP, it's the second most expensive item in the game.

So got this drop from gargoyles on a new slayer task from Konar quo Maten. Wiki says it goes up to 198 and nothing else drops this many torstels in the game O\_o [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar\_quo\_Maten#Konar%27s\_drop\_table](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten#Konar%27s_drop_table)
---
If you keep your health higher than its health then you'll eventually beat it
---
Theres a new herb patch and a global 10%(5?) buff as well 
---
These things tend to raise herb seed price and lower herb price
---
it briefly tanked below 100m today
---
ranarrs are down like +500gp last i checked too

Not really all that to be honest. This is like what, Zulrah level money? How difficult is the boss?

One of the saddest things about this is that the dude has two kids.
---
We are venom.
---
Naw its fine. 
---
clucky
---
It's a little extra temporary bonus before the (probable) nerf, but really nothing to stress over. It's not like you're getting repeated max cash drops here, just a minimal GP/h boost on the average slayer task which won't surpass the average decent money making method.
---
Should I keep leveling some of my stats up before or just jump right into it
---
Bro I‚Äôm literally behind my computer in the classroom right now. I just took over the classroom and it‚Äôs much easier. Kind of stressful making sure your procedures are good but other than that it‚Äôs chill.

I made 180k from picking a lantadyme . Farming got new stuff too

they are already coming up again

Hmm...how was that possible though?

Too relatable
---
I agree 100% with this, i want to freaking kill something with a spear and it being BIS for once in my dam life, but no. Twisted bow this and blowpipe that, hydra boss, can't melee well with that dumb fire mechanic. and range is overall bis for luring them, ffs jagex.
---
Good question 
---
A nice work around over this problem would be replacing herbs with alchables.
---
 A 
---
Was a rather terrible movie
---
shoulda did it last night. No competition 
---
For what it is worth, it seems the new creatures do mix it up some. Drakes seem weak to Magic and some of the others are weak to Melee. Also, the Lance may make Vorkath more Meleeable... But yah, more diversity in future bosses would be nice. I don't mind Hydra being single style or Ranged, but if the next boss is also Ranged meta that will be bit much.
---
I'm sick of kids like you who don't read the post and then comment something that isn't even linked with the post itself. Read the post, and when you have something constructive to say, comment, if not, go to the next post.

Wait, this just in?
---
Are you too dumb to read the wiki page that I even linked in my comment? Any monster on a slayer task from Konar can drop anything on this new drop table.
---
Edit: thanks for deleting your comment. Guessing you re read the wiki page?

They also spelt "Piscarilius" wrong in the diary.

They obviously release OP content so people would subscribe again to play.

They‚Äôre very rare Reddit is just highlights my guy. Did you happen to see the 10ish people with 1-5kc pets?

It‚Äôs based on the total sum of the noted drop

He lost more than a DWH and other people have lost tonnes too...

To be clear, just because you chose to use a different means of communication doesn't mean your underlining point isn't also stupid.

Can you list the items in this one?

Just received 205 raw shark from a black dragons task.
---
100k gp ought to do it
---
I do actually due some Dev, but I have virtual machines set up so I'm good on testing myself. Thanks though. 
---
That's ok because you can do a variety of other things that give better gp.
---
How would you know how rare the drops are, and how much gp can be obtained from them?

Didn't sell for 160m on GE, better try reddit!

Thank you!
---
She gives more points than Nieve or Steve it says with 18-20pts. She also givea access to some good mobs and gives you that sick drop table while only being at 75 combat req. That's pretty good IMO is she the new go-to slayer master?
---
Godspeed, bro. How do you plan on attacking him?

If Jagex could confirm this, that would be swell.
---
Not your lack of drops, but like, a relative relationship of seeing these go on. Because holy hell does it feel like the fucking sky is falling when they just lump that shit on this already unstable and weak in game economy.
---
What did he sell it for?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=jVNt9BcU_KI
---
Dang, that is kinda suss. They did mention the boots and how that mechanic was a thing. They never said anything about having to still have the boots to collect your items for 100k, it was stated ‚ÄúThe collection chest works just as other instanced boss chests, pay 100k and get your things back.‚Äù None or the other collection chests have a death enabling mechanic attached... yes it appears you should have ASSUMED you would need the boots to safely recollect, but on first release with no developers directly stating that...... I feel for you op. Rip 60m
---
Not him, but Good Fortune to You.
---
Yeah I would say so. I wouldn't be surprised if the drop table gets nerfed but it's definitely not a bug so milk it while you can! Gl
---
Yeah you can do that. But what if we brainstorm for a better sollution.
---
Raids it has to be, only natural to throw the whole book at things of that nature.
---
Zulrah + Kraken? Checked the date of release of those two?
---
Have you seen the price of blood runes? They will just keep on rising. We need more coming in to the game. I agree they were too cheap before, but there‚Äôs too many leaving the game now
---
Whats that thing in the lower left corner?
---
Just shut up Serene. Please.
---
Thanks! Pretty good! 
---
No shit.
---
4 more hourssss

them taking 18 years to release the smithing rework totally negates everything else in that "game"

get back in your cage rs3tard

Teleporting to the wrong location is strong with this one. 
---
Damn muscle memory
---
Don't nerf it yet Jamflex, I'm at work, and then after work I have to do the diaries so I can do my Lizardmen Shaman task (not going to skip that, especially with the "Slayzien Helm" reward), _then_ I can get Konar tasks.
---
i got the status bars part but like my inventory is all of the tabs across the bottom, not 7 on top 7 on the bottom like in the picture. I assume this one is an rs setting not a runelite setting, just havent been able to pin it down.  thanks for the tips on the scaling/stretched mode.
---
IS THIS WHY TORSTOLS ARE 8K EACH RIGHT NOW? WHAT THE FUCK?
---
please redesign the dragon hunter lance. Just rename it to dragon hunter hasta and make it look like a spear. It looks fucking disgusting currently. Also, redesign ferocious gloves, wtf are those.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
Hard to say. Konar does have a pretty nice task list and the bonus drops. But she does lose some tasks like Suqah, TzHaar, Spirituals, and some others I'm forgetting. And the area specific thing can be a hindrance. Being forced to kill Brutal Dragons or not being able to Burst Nechs can make tasks less profitable or slower exp.
---
I remember as a kid trying to take them out haha. RS3 has them as overrides, would be cool to have stuff like this for that FASHION 
---
or just quit the game and have no chance of dying at all :)
---
Yes, Konar gives 18 points per task, tasks are assigned with an area you have to slay them in. Has an additional drop table on task. So yeah it is indeed better than nieve, would even say duradel too
---
What‚Äôs the easiest teak tree location to get to?
---
Yeah I got magic tree too, was pretty blowed haha I was hoping to knock out a few herb ones to get hespori seed

No it‚Äôs just my girlfriends a guy named Ali. 
---
Jk it‚Äôs pronounced like Allie
---
What a loser 
---
No fuck off. 
---
My mistake, they said on the q and a stream it was task only and you couldn't boost to kill the hydra boss. 
---
Range with magic prayer and your Gucci. Or melee with prossy armour and bring food pray magic. 
---
With minerals you can buy different mining gloves. With gold nuggets you can unlock stuff @ MLM and buy mining xp boosting outfit (Prospector)
---
New drop table for PvM at the new place? why would that effect something so arbitrary as Gold Ore though?
---
FASHION!!!!!
---
Yeah but if you genuinely can't do the task then what other choice is there
---
Congratz you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
Use this rare thing called common sense for satans sake.
---
That person probably turned around and sold it for double that.
---
Hacked email
---
But thats including the Jad Exp boost. If jad was treated as a regular boss task in this case you'd only get the exp for Jad itself, and the bonus exp (like 5k ?) after completing 35 jads, which would be terrible exp.
---
Zulrah to go for a pb

My driving instructor never called crashes accidents unless it was caused by something out of the driver's control (i.e - mechanical failure not stemming from neglectfulness)

Everything you do while driving is a decision and that choosing to be negligent and not pay attention to the road and subsequently causing a collision is something that should not be labeled as an 'accident'.

Oh yeah my cash stack isn't a weird flex I was flipping when I was previously on (as you could see by the robin hood hat being sold).
---
I've had a kree and a zulrah task from her (skipped both looking for hydras)
---
Wouldn't the shortage and price climb result in (maybe) more people taking up RC? The more lucrative it is, the more I can see people gritting their way through it and getting to 77. 
---
I'd probably do zulrah since zulrah tasks cant go up to 35, and great money with slayer helm boost.
---
It's supposed to scale with the level of the monsters you're tasked to kill:
---
&gt; The chance of hitting this loot table is scaled by the combat level of the NPC you're fighting [...]
---
But judging by how many of these screenshots and messages are about people getting them from stuff like fire giants, turoths or trolls, perhaps the scaling is bugged or just wasn't properly balanced for low level mobs...

Discussion
---
You‚Äôre correct, but technology has advanced far enough that jagex knows, a lot of people use bots, and 95% of bots are skilling bots, they don‚Äôt want mass and mass amounts of GP being generated into the game because of profitable skilling. 
---
Where do I get this
---
he's probably really a f2p with 1 slayer
---
artisan would  further the issue of people doing skilling for the xp rather than the product. 
---
I really need to finish my KQ task when I get home so I can hop on this OP drop table till they nerf it. 
---
Nope, BP is still BIS at Vorkath. Ran DPS calcs plus Woox tested it 
---
I forgot about that.
---
~4k at the moment
---
I experimented with [reading about the topic](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten)..?
---
Why are you pretending to be retarded. 
---
lmao day in the life of an osrs player
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure the 'resources shouldn't come from PVM' mantra is a community thing, not a Jagex thing.
---
What about the recent integrity change which removed a bunch of resources from bosses? They've straight up stated that they believe resources should come from skilling and not PvM.
---
BIS for olm as in BIS on his melee hand. Right now scythe/rapier are BIS so this fills that niche. Will definitely be in demand for those that want absolute max raid 1 gear but otherwise not that useful.
---
Ur joking right? Rip bro.
---
GZ! Did you notice that it was different color in inventory or did it stop you from cutting it?  I am paranoid I am going to chop mine into chunks
---
Varrock tele to GE with diary. EZ
---
Verzik is melee but 
---
Boss 1, maiden = 100% range (tbow BIS)
---
Boss 2, bloat = 100% melee
---
Boss 3, nylocas = all 3
---
Boss 4, sotetseg = Scythe bis then Tbow (if neither then whip)
---
Boss 5, = xarpus = 100% range
---
Boss 6, = verzik = 100% range (mage p1 but doesn't rlly count since staff and whip meta)
---
Range is really really useful at TOB except for verzik and bloat. 
---
As somebody who lost half their bank, I strongly agree with this 
---
rs3 bad :rage:
---
Reclaim what item? What cave? What boots?
---
Make Zulrah task only

Didn‚Äôt know that the boss was intended to be this lvl of difficulty.

It's how a lot do it. You sell some thing random for a lot of cash, they buy it, giving you the gold you bought from them.
---
I'm not saying it is them, but it could be an unlikely coincidence that someone sold the seeds on there after being told to list the seed for 5mill by the gold sellers. The subsequently buy the seed, assuming its the purchaser, but it turns out to be OP.
---
I said it as a bit of a joke, but there could be some truth behind it. 
---
I don't think we know that for sure.  However, I would hazard a guess at not.
---
Weird Flex but okay.
---
I swear you guys wanted an updated rare drop table just a week ago.
---
Did this update change the look of the bonecrusher? I could've sworn that it looked different a week ago but I don't see anything about it in the update notes.
---
10m is like 4 bonds, so around ¬£16. Depends how big the YouTuber, if it's for only like 20k views then it's probably not so worth it.
---
You people make me so sad :( 
---
The information in the link you've provided only states that obtaining a Dragon Hasta is rare. Nothing else is determined rare. So, as the topic was concerning everything else but the Hasta, do you have evidence suggesting the drops in matter, in fact, are rare?

Ive been doing drakes for the last half hour, its fine. youre being a iron drama queen

Are these not as rare as they made them sound in the update ?

Thanks guys
---
You and your logic, get outta here

this but unironically

Good and nice
---
They updated rdt? FINALLY ITS ACTUALLY GOOD ONLY TOOK THEM 4 YRS
---
Oh relax they usually fix this shit quickly enough.
---
That‚Äôs 10 full work weeks dude how is that not a lot of time 
---
If you have a decent ranged level, it's not too bad. You might die a couple times but you can just pay to get your items back. I think I died twice on the last boss, but I was pretty drunk and once I got the hang of it he was pretty simple. 
---
If you want them off the road, support infrastructure plans that include dedicated bike lanes and paths.  Cyclists have just as much right to get where they're going as you do.
---
I drive and cycle, and when cycling I always try to take routes that keep me away from major roads.  Do you think I *want* to be on a road with cars whizzing by at 55+ mph?  Some times there's just no alternative route, but I still gotta get where I'm going.
---
Goteem
---
Eh, not sure about that. I remember pre-DHCB buff, Blowpipe was higher DPS at Brutals but DHCB was higher profit per hour due to lower ammo costs. Though DHCB will likely beat out Lance at Vorkath since it doesn't have too high of ammo costs, but Lance does seem like it will be a good option.
---
Konar drop table is wack OP

You're seriously such a slave to gluttony and instant gratification that you think it's ok to play while driving? Eating while driving is also stupid and dangerous. Grow up

I don't actually hate TBWC. There's plenty of things in the game I think are more dead or less fun than TBWC. Maybe I am crazy but I find it kind of relaxing. Totally agree on complaint based economy though. RNG always improves with more complaining.

I used to work in a kitchen. You had 2 options, either I would shit on your steak and it would be done in 5 mins or I would cook it perfect but it would take 3 hours. 
---
Did you not see the shitshow with the revenant resource drops?
---
Yeah expect it to be in the game for a week or so because "we gather data"
---
Why does getting something to make your life easier feel  bad? I don't understand that, I'm sorry.
---
Rough estimate, 50/50.
---
Focus on quests
---
I have an ironman (BTW) do you know how hard it is to get torstol? And last time I checked torstol wasnt on the paycheck
---
ye, but old death mechanics are very flawed though. You DC and lose hundreds hours of progress. Imo RS3 has a great death system. Pay a FEE to ''death'' to retrieve ur items (and not just 100k, but based on gear prices lost etc, in RS3 it gets up to mills paid fee)
---
High effort Skilling should equal high gp and/or xp. 
---
High cost Skilling should equal high cost at a loss. 
---
Low effort Skilling should be low xp and gp.

scroll down to Drop Table
---
Should have assumed.  Forehead 
---
I hope so, it looks amazing. Getting a 1m reward when Boss gear is 3b isn't really that impactful.
---
I like it. Me more money = me happy
---
yeah, cut the drops down to like 20% of current and just replace the RDT with Konar's (plus shield left half and d spear so they're still around). RDT needs an update and Konar's loot is absolutely nutty. I don't get why we first got bosses that provide both consistent and BiS gp/hr, and now we're getting regular slayer buffs as well. Why not just remove noncombat skills from osrs at this point because apparently they don't fuckin matter.
---
Have you ever thrown anything in your life?
---
So it evens out. Not everyone is getting a 200 herb drop. 
---
Also you can get Torstols  from other monsters, Skotizo, Cerb, CoX, Zulrah, KQ, Nature imps, sinister keys.

Growth is said to be 36 hours.

I wish I was still on tit island.

The monster models, terrain, and weapon models for this quest need to be recycled. They‚Äôre too sick to only have in a short and stand alone quest that unlocks pretty much nothing lol. 
---
Twitch Chat. West tried a few different eye colors, but Blue is what players wanted. The clipping thing was kinda unavoidable since BCP is abnormal. Personally, I like the earlier designs but... if the community wants it.
---
I got two RDT rolls in one task so IDK wtf is happening.
---
Lol imagine paying 400m for an item that went down to ~20m about 4 hours later 
---
They're also the world's most savage killer.
---
You may be logging out/logging in to much or world hopping and missing growth cycles. I grew two herbs there already for farming contracts with no issues.

Nope. Please enlighten me on how plugging up your rectum is of any benefit.

Lmao, its the same guy?

doesnt mean you couldnt still try to get that pixel in by configuring how the 2d image is generated

90+5 for spirit tree+fairy ring
---
Made 2.5m from 1 seed. I thank you sir
---
Demonic gorillas are already the best slayer money per hour they don‚Äôt need the extra rdt boost (as much as I‚Äôd like to see them get it) 
---
to my knowledge they make the pet models by just downscaling the full models nowadays, so they probably didn't want to bother remaking a model with all heads just for the pet.
---
Was this on task?
---
Got 2 of the battle staff to tree seeds from demonic gorillas, sold on ge for 2m each
---
THEY EAT DA POOPOO
---
Why fletch
---
infernal c-
---
To be fair, the only skilling loot on there ATM is Gold Ore, Coal, Iron Ore, Runite Ore, Raw Monkfish, Raw Sharks, and Yew Logs. So 7 of 29 items... Not that worst we've seen.
---
Yer holding it, but that's just blood meh friend.
---
This is why the general tirade/witch hunt against him is a bad idea.  He might have a low batting average but he can still hit the ball
---
Have you thought at all that maybe it's intentional as they can be killed off task here? Still makes the other ones the best spot, but with the req of having the task.
---
Set your long term goals as barrows gloves and a fire cape (assuming you‚Äôre buying a membership). Shorter term goals complete all the free to play quests. 
---
I dont think it has anything to do with stupid and lazy. People just oversee things.
---
I guess this goes to show the problem with basing item design on Twitch chat. Why not put out a design poll like they've done before through poll booths? 
---
I feel like both the color *and* the fact that they are vambraces instead of gloves makes no sense.
---
Blue = mage, usually
---
Vambraces = ranged, usually
---
Gloves = can be seen behind the BCP.

---
The name for the race is Taskaal, which means balance in Estonian so it's fitting. 
---
Or when Niles shows up to ask the retarded boy if it‚Äôs a fish or a sword
---
Sold for 103mil btw.
---
For Ironman definitely glassblowing.
---
Hence why I put "only" farming.
---
Skotizo was the only boss that commonly dropped 20 torstols, all the rest was rare and 10 torstols or 7? that cerb drops.
---
Like i've said I don't mind them being a rare drop but just not in quantitys of 100-200 you can nerf it down to 70-100 and it would still be a great drop
---
Thank you, serene, for the informative, entertaining, and thoroughly funny comment, as always
---
'Broken home', 'One piercing Note' and 'The needle skips' are pretty great RS3 examples of spooki/sad quests, would recommend.
---
that's a fair drop imo
---
It's the only way he'll learn.
---
Averaged about 2:30-3:00 minutes per alchemical hydra. The regular hydras die pretty quickly when using a cannon! Took me about 30 minutes for 50 of them? 
---
Way worse than Duradel because a lot of Konar‚Äôs tasks are shit xp it seems. The tasks being assigned in specific areas is a huge problem because if you get nechs in the slayer tower instead of catacombs you can‚Äôt barrage them so it turns one of the best tasks in the game to a worthless one. 
---
*loud screaming*
---
You forgot the REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE in chat. Congrats!
---
yeaaaaah sure now it's not intended
---
97 cb and 73 slayer. I'm so close to unlocking the final slayer master but with these drops I might just stick to Konar for a while even after I unlock Duradel. 
---
Maybe they‚Äôll rework magic if warding gets passed.
---
When skilling rather than pvm sets the economy, cheap bots flourish.  It is a sad reality.  Honestly if you enjoy the skilling or any gameplay that maybe is now considered "obsolete" due to not being top tier, join a friendly welcoming ironman community :)
---
That way poop dont come out when u fuckin her vag hard
---
you seem stressed, i can recomend a good massage and a drink 
---
I didn't claim because I'm wrong the boss is sloppy. I'm claiming the boss is sloppy because the meta is incredibly easy while also causing the pre-planned phases to cancel/stutter out. It doesn't look like a finished product when the 2 phases that require *some* level of avoidance blink out when you smack a 70 with a tbow.
---
I GET THAT REFERENCE 
---
You can get those drops from any monster during slayer task of the new master
---
It'll never crash! 
---
Too bad it's so ugly. :\
---
so tha poop dont come out, duh
---
Easier than cerb with a better drop table. You can camp range on it so TB &amp; BP are BiS for it. 
---
Jagex fucked up on this IMO. Killing the supplies market
---
Gay fish 
---
Some people thrive off of hate. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs trolling with at least half of what he says.
---
Dang.  
---
Well I am happy anyways :D
---
Funny thing is, it doesn't even drop any food. The closest it does is drop large amounts of noted raw fish
---
It's slayer bosses.
---
smh why doesn't he just bot?
---
Is there  way to reverse this?
---
Hydras are not dragons
---
0%&lt;any%
---
This pretty advanced though and I can go more in depth in a bit if you need me to.
---
Konar gives more points than Duradel so you'll likely never see him again.
---
That poor woman. 
---
shut up serene's alt
---
At least you can rest easy knowing that there was nothing that you could have done to avoid this.
---
it's mostly fine except for certain herb drops that should really have been scaled down
---
Brooks was here.
---
taking no damage in slayer caves isn't afkable friend
---
the drop is 1 in 5000 as you well know
---
there was not a single mention of there being a problem with the current slayer caves size/layout ever by anyone
---
No because those are uniques, meaning the droprate can be rare as fuck but still far from meaningless.
---
'*Komme gij uit Rotterdam..?*'
---
My Dearest Serene,

I'm actually conflicted on whether or not to tell you to bury your head in a jar of dirt today. 
---
Sincerely,
---
Your Most Enthusiastic Follower
---
I got mine two weeks ago when they crashed to 130m. Not even mad. 
---
That makes sense, tfti
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to devalue your drop, regardless of whether it‚Äôs the first or not, it looks sweet, especially with the orange outfit. I‚Äôd be happy too!
---
At the beginning the boots were on a really low stock for some reason which meant people were more impatient.
---
I got assigned zulrah from konar already so unfortunately it's not. But I think it's a cool idea.
---
Holy shit that made me laugh really hard
---
Actually there is, a kill several bosses task, and it requires you to carry crystals that are dropped which debuff you during the fight. no banking the crystals while you regear.
---
I just got 172 from a dags task, first task with the new master
---
It really does get easier with trial and error. I'm on my 5th try of Jad and compared to the first couple of times, it got a lot easier. My highest wave was 43, so hopefully, it shouldn't that much more. 
---
To be fair the wording of the blowpipe on the poll was misunderstood by most. It mentioned that the speed of the weapon would be the same as a shortbow on rapid, not accounting for the fact that putting the blowpipe on rapid itself would make it an extra tick faster. 
---
your scratchoff won $5
---
Combat level of the monster. Yes. 
---
He shows up once you go into the lab. He won't show on the mini map unless you actually go into the room.
---
Of course it is if one gets uniques lol, this was about the standard drops
---
Haha, yea. Was not remotely expecting it, just getting a pre-req for dig site. 
---
Nope. At least not exclusively. Herblore existing long before Farming and back then PvM was the source of Herbs. The addition of Farming made them a Skilling loot, but that doesn't mean they stop being a PvM loot. Same for Runes; PvM had them as loot before RC was a thing. With seeds, I think technically WC nests did come first but it is pretty split between the two these days.
---
Likewise.
---
For a second I thought someone just took a picture of the rat pole.

Rip

lol!

Afking in the new dungeon right now whilst studying for an exam tomorrow. I feel you :c

Yeah ok so looking at this we can be pretty confident that duradel is better, you spend much more of your time at nechs/smoke/dust devils in a barrage scenario. 
---
People are bitching before they even know the drop rates. The drop table seems to be relatively rare.
---
Nope. Just got a very similar drop
---
The herb drops and seeds need nerfed a little but it's a nice update.
---
As someone who just came back to RS after like 10 years away, people not dropping their items on death is probably my least favourite change by a mile.
---
Been checking it out... nope its just one pearl per drop. like an hour for 10 pearls likely is gonna be the average...
---
Exactly, I'm bout to call in sick to make bank loots today
---
You didn't :)  
---
Thanks!
---
About 200 mill including imbued slayer helm 
---
&gt;  The chance of hitting this loot table is scaled by the combat level of the NPC you're fighting, and the loot is granted in addition to any normal drop you would receive. 
---
Right there, plain as day in the news post: http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-kebos-lowlands?oldschool=1
---
Yeah, this is so much better. I'm actually having fun :)
---
Couldn‚Äôt he just go pick it up?
---
gunther the brave
---
Yeah; have your inventory full enough so when he delivers items to you he can‚Äôt give you every item. He‚Äôll patiently wait for you to talk to him again for the last of your items. So after you take the last items from him send him away (or else he‚Äôll start roaming)
---
wat makes u think they didnt, huh cause if they didnt they would have  fixed it as soon as the first person got that many, 
---
U right
---
shows how stupidly OP bp is
---

I do have demonic gorillas fairly well in hand. Learned them shortly after MM2. Usually I do simpler switches, though. Not super talented with the complicated ones. But the hard diaries I haven't finished yet are on the to-do list so Zulrah will be coming up fairly soon!
---
It‚Äôs a different kind of hot
---
I think it is worth noting this is more of an issue of how it feels than of balancing. Dropping 1000 Axes 1 in 1000, 100 Axes 1 in 100, or 1 Axe every kill averages the same amount coming into the game. But seeing massive drops of 1000 feel weird similar to how 100 noted D Legs at Revs felt weird. So I don't think this is going to crash the price or such, but I do wonder why they didn't stick with 100 being the max. TBH, if they were going to drop 1000, they probably could have left it in Raids.
---
Stupidly, yes I did, not gonna jump on the bandwagon of flaming jagex for my own mistake
---
Makes hellhounds more interesting tbh..
---
!remindme 2hr
---
I think in small quantities, yes PvM dropped herbs are fine. However, we are talking potential for 198 Torstols... If anything, they should have made the drops seeds.
---
Actually, I'm maxed and you clearly have no idea what you're talking about either. You're also responding to an argument I never made as well. I never said anything about ironmen not doing tob, I said they can skip getting a weapon with that high of a DPS scaling, which would usually be acquired at tob. A far longer grind than Hydra. Now irons have a quicker access to a olm near BIS and one that's actually better than the rapier, which already has very few places it's BIS. The effects of these dragon hunting weapons are also not balanced, but they necessarily need to be higher or comparable DPS to the incredibly overpowered blowpipe, otherwise they're dead content. You're a little dull aren't you
---
Do slayer. It will raise your combat stats and can make you money
---
yea there is a pretty big difference between "doing something you don't like" and doing something that is endangering the lives of innocent people so that he can get a few more hours of playtime in a fucking video game
---
Can't believe people will bitch about RS3 24/7, and then refuse to make the changes needed to avert that game's mistakes. Do you want two thirds of the skills in the game to be totally pointless outside of diaries? If not, we're going to deal with this problem eventually. That doesn't necessarily mean reverting to the old equilibrium of point-and-click-and-wait resource gathering, but Jagex does need to do *something*. For instance, much of the fossil island skilling content is high engagement for very solid xp and minimal profit. One can easily imagine the introduction of similarly high engagement content that focuses on profit over XP.
---
Even beyond the economic impacts, I would dramatically prefer to have (e.g.) huge quantities of logs entering the game from a woodcutting activity, rather than arbitrary slayer drops. It diversifies content, and generates  a more fully realized phenomenological sense of place and being. When I cut down a tree in this game, I feel like I just got some logs. When I get a huge noted log drop, I feel like I just got a cash-stack; since there's no logic behind the logs appearing, they don't 'feel' like logs, but rather an amount of abstract currency that I'm going to immediately liquidate at the GE. It's a subtle but important difference, and a crucial part of making sure the game feels like a 'world' and not just a mathematical input-output system. Objects need to have a certain degree of 'friction' ‚Äî there needs to be consistent guidelines that constrain their appearance in the world and guide the player's interactions with them, otherwise they devolve into pure arbitrary gamerules.
---
OSRS used to have a really fantastic sense of 'place' and 'friction', and I'm sad to see it slowly degenerate into SlayerScape2k19 (TM). 
---
If it's too good for pvp without nerfing the attack speed, it's too good for pvm as well. If it's going to stay as is, it really should be substantially rarer and more expensive to use than it is currently. 
---
I got 48 steel dragons on my ironman where I didn't have enough to block or cancel. I still don't know whether I should reset it or complete it. I would've loved to get brine rats.
---
Made 350k killing 150 hellhounds.. slayer will definitely be more entertaining now
---
How long did it take?
---
Believe it or not, RS3 actually implemented in a good solution to this with their Mining &amp; Smithing rework that came out the other day in the form of ore spirits. They're consumable PvM drops that double the amount of ore mined but only have one use.
---
Scout in varrock west bank (2009-2013) on one account, message on another. Look for level 75-115 with obviously rwt'ed armor. Use shortkeys that already have your script on them (ie ;;1 ;;2 ;;3 ;;4 ;;5) so the messages are very quick and make it look like you might be official to them using precanned scripts. Be on FUNORB servers sending PMs so it says your world says something like "Tetralink 1" so the naive won't know what that is and think you are a mod. Try 3-4 kids at a time, messaging them all at once. Basic webhosting of a scam site or even a botnet is easily done by any 13 year old with a background in computers. Average loot back then was 70-200m, for about 35-75 minutes of work (bulk rate was 0.35-0.4c a mil). Normally, when selling gold, you have people that you deal with on a regular basis that you trust and have a relationship with for large quantities. 
---
Do I need to go on? You ignorant idiot. And really now, calling someone a 'pathetic virgin', what is this, the 10th grade?
---
No one has killed it yet because it takes more than a day to grow, let's see tomorrow. Can't imagine it would be too difficult to kill, but without knowing any mechanics it's a bit scary anyway.
---
What's the orange ball at bottom?
---
Umm.... There's tons of low level content. 
---
* New slayer master only requires 75 combat. 
---
* New slayer monsters start at 44 slayer.
---
* Farming guild starts at 40 farming. 
---
* Aerial Fishing starts at 43 fishing and 35 hunter. 
---
* There are 2 new beginner quests. 
---
9 hours total with learning the boss right at release from watching Woox.

Can we stop acting like this needs a nerf? It doesnt
---
Why are noted planks on the table lol
---
In the grand scheme of things when it comes to just yourself, sure, but not when you multiply it by 10,000-20,000+ players
---
Literally have no idea about any serene drama. Glad to see osrs are still obsessively toxic over random players they don't like. 
---
Awh man that's fucking awful. Is it a big hit to you or will you get it back fairly quickly?
---
It isn't one of the easy ones brother, there's people with 200m xp that don't have it so.. And I belive it's the only skilling pet that you can have 200m xp and not have it 
---
If anything, as well, herb runs already bring in a ton of herbs daily. These new drops from slayer shouldn‚Äôt necessarily impact it all that much
---
Planted a Hespori about 30 mins after the update and it's not fully grown yet, quite a long cycle. 
---
Meaningless and not meaningless are precisely binary here, there's no middle ground. And both are bad in this context. So no.
---
thats not how its worked in a loooong time
---
They're doing something that risks others lives. I certainly wish minor car damage on anyone doing this. Something enough to deter even wholly selfish people from doing something so stupid. I don't want them to die or even get hurt, but what they're doing is not okay and it goes beyond "doing something you don't like"
---
They're going to be dead content within a month
---
Thank you for clearing up what I said, im not good at words
---
Bonds aren't any more "OP" than buying gold. It's twice the price from buying from 3rd party sites. Yeah it's "zero risk" but Jagex seldom bans gold buyers and most people have delivery to an alt. 
---

bought acc with 93 rc more like it

agreed. me no like
---
BIS gloves, why not? Just raise your defense level. 
---
Lave Runecrafting is the worst activity. 
---
remove the herb drops and we good
---
Vorkath is still better money than hydra by quite a bit so presumably they'll go back to pre-hydra discussion levels around like 120m. They were worth that just for vorkath before hydra was even announced. 
---
"The world is shit anyway so what does it matter if I'm a piece of shit"
---
If only these people would stop breeding
---
Happened with guardians release too
---
Yeah because that really explains how it's gonna drop 2m in fucking torstols lmfao
---
Thats so cool
---
Oh I will enjoy it, as soon as I get out of work..
---
For people, like me, who are trash at the game and can't to tasks like Cerb or Fight Caves, slayer doesn't really make much more than 70m from 85-99. What will we make with this? 80m? Big max?
---
Literally the photo shown is proof. It isn't in his inventory lol.
---
I was thinking about a Fremennik islands only ironman but then A Friend copied the idea straight out of my head.
---
You can prevent his melee attacks by keeping 1 square away and timing your attacks so he never gets the chance to melee. Kind of a hassle to do when you could just use a BP or DHCB though, in my opinion. 
---
Still not buying it m8
---
People are freaking out over nothing. They‚Äôre getting 200k drops every 5 tasks. It‚Äôs not game breaking at all and makes killing blood velds and hellhounds pretty cool because you might get something. this community is going to ruin a good thing crying to jagex. 
---
Vaya con d√≠os, mijo. At least the exit ops are good
---
Would you prefer it just said get good instead?
---
Sad and funny but true
---
Gratz, now get that cape trimmed :)
---
What figure have you seen to suggest that? I'm seeing average drop per kill of like 100k and kill times of around 2 minutes with tbow. Vorkath has lower kill times and like 35% higher average drop. 
---
Mah, there's probably 15-40,000 people doing the new slayer content. You're just seeing and hearing about the lucky ones.
---
The new slayer is more interesting than normal slayer though, since you're assigned a monster and a location to slay it.
---
Great update, even the Konar rdt is a good idea. But you are right it‚Äôs too op right now. I mean for god sakes they nerfed birdhouses, then come out with this shit!?
---
Think it would. But they have +20 Mage Def and +100 Range Def.
---
New content = prices are a mess for most items
---
Not trying to say it should be for pures, we chose to limit ourselves, it just doesn't make sense to me.
---
Congrats!
---
Well that's a garbage way of looking at runescape. Skilling resources should come from skilling and combat resources should come from combat. 
---
Lumbridge only ironman

Not really much you can do to make it more difficult. 1 attack style is boring af

It‚Äôs a cool ass sword man

So happy for this, hate doing quest.
---
Thank you Jagex &lt;3
---
Damn abos comin' in here rb-ing me at the hydra.
---
I think you missed my point which is that it isn't about just you. Yeah, 80M isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but when 10k-20k players are pulling in an additional 80m+ it's can completely shift the economy. 
---
I don't see the problem with this.
---
While i agree that the additional drop with the very rare chance of it being highly valuable is a good thing your reasoning is not. Its not like you can expect to get 600 torstols a slayer task, or even 1 drop in 1m slayer xp. We‚Äôre just seeing a lot of these drops because basically everyone is slaying right now
---
 Balancing the entire games economy on a game mode that consists of ~10% of the player base is not good game design.
---
You were expecting Bruno, weren‚Äôt you? But instead it was me, Dio!

It's like seeing the two people on the front page get Hydra pet before 5 KC and start thinking the pet is 1/10 lol
---
Your questioning the logic of a fantasy game..
---
Investigating a potential issue is not the same as saying there is definitely an issue. Don't assume, wait for confirmation. Frankly if there was an issue they would probably have announced what that issue is and fixed it by now, which they haven't, so...
---
I've got it 4 times since the update. Might need a little nerf.
---
U Mean the top post right now?

There's a lot of animosity in certain college towns towards cyclists because students on larger campuses develop negligence for all traffic laws as pedestrians "Please hit me so I can sue and legally miss my final", and when they bike instead they have the same mentality they did when they were a pedestrian and do obnoxious shit like weave between cars and run red lights.
---
Maybe it was just a Columbus thing but other student cyclists infuriated me. Biking on campus was already basically playing Frogger around pedestrians, then other cyclists doing the same shit makes it rather unsurprising when a student dies because they got hit by a truck
---
You didn't last long in that chat channel.
---
Oh man, you must have hundreds of KC by this point then. Screenshot of yours?
---
Simply just for the integrity of the game.  Might not fit 'lore' wise, but limiting these to high level mains is probably the best call. 
---
I agree the rates are poopoo. They should add the chance to get a pearl from cutting fish because that takes so much time compared to filling up your inventory.  A  pet idea would be a cool looking salamander thats also a failed creation of the dragonkin or whatever lore there using for the place. Point is it can change colors to. Really love the concept of this skilling method though!
---
I am seeing a lot of these, must be common drop rate
---
It's posts like this that lead to the current slayerscape state of the game. There's more than 1 skill in the game. 
---
You need to start watching Q &amp; A's or reading other posts before you ask the same thing that has been asked several times, new seeds nest for the new seed drop table from nests.

Remember the river that flows from Baxtorian Falls to Castle Wars? Make the drops related to being able to canoe on that river? That's just an idea from the top of my head. But I guess players wanna always make money when receiving their drops so.. I just hate the fact that drop tables are all about gp/gear, but yea maybe that's just how it is.

Surely that guy kept the dwh and lost the remainder of his chest due to a second death?
---
Thats not a reaper task though :p
---
Was pretty surprised to see this as well - this is a pretty big change to a commonly used item and makes it completely dead content. Do not appreciate this being unpolled and attached at the bottom of a giant changeset.
---
What does this mean? Do they now delay your attack when you drink them or does it effect using them as combo "food"
---
Wish RS3 had this. We have mage on everything and melee on just a few. Only 1 range boss that's high level and it's got the worst drops in GWD2

Yeah and they are nerfing anglers too without polls 
---
Thank you for the legit response... point taken. I'm not saying slayer will be better than Miscellania in the grand scheme of leveling up a skill... but at least the rare drops are good... instead of getting a sapphire or a tooth half key which is completely dead content. I like being happy when I get rare drops:
---
MAKE RDT GREAT AGAIN!!
---
So you're what is wrong with this community. 
---
Instead of aiming for good balanced content, you want what will eventually break the game for quick easy gain. 
---
Must the assigned seeds be planted inside the Farming Guild?
---
that's not why I didn't like it, it feels like a private server kind of drop. I don't have any problem with the value of the drops, just that the drops themselves don't feel like they fit the game.
---
No but it does deal damage. Clip : https://clips.twitch.tv/EagerFaintButterPraiseIt
---
There already is a fishing and a hunter pet they could just add the chance of getting either of these even at a very high drop rate than usual atleast the chance is there
---
Did you just steal a post?
---
It's way faster to do them separately... I think you missed the point. If you train hunter for 1 hr and fishing for 1hr and then Aerial Fish for 2 hrs. You're way further along in xp in both skills by doing the former. Plus pearls are so rare, there's no huge incentive to do Aerial Fishing, especially after getting the rods.
---
Ja som tu super clovek, nie ty 
---
Lol you're in for a wild ride in p2p

whats your fishing level? I've considered this at work too but I dont know if i want to invest that much time into fishing

Don't undock with something you can't afford to lose
---
Nerfed yet??
---
r/unexpectedouija
---
But we do have a need to downvote you
---
Lets say they removed the drops, apart from hydras what would be the point in the new slayer master? 3 extra points for some random tasks at dedicated areas doesnt seem like a good trade off. (although as slaying goes, it makes sense).
---
The exp i've had so far has been awful also. The herb drops are a bit much but if they mess with the rest of tehe drops, they need to give a new incentive to use her.
---
for anyone reading this comment, I've been doing slayer for 5 hours now and I've only gotten 5k air runes from the new drop table.
---
I believe it's

Scythe &gt; Tbow &gt; whip &gt; BP.

I saw you there, you told me that you got 2 whips in 2minutes or something

You can do one with weapons and armor.
---
Or you know any number lower than 100 noted herbs
---
I totally agree however everyone is going to do things different, it could help people for example that rely on a spec ko that might not even be 1t. Just to be clear I don‚Äôt agree with any nerf and thinking eating should stay as is

Okay I did and people were saying it there and I just assumed they were in on the meme. I feel like some are to get people winded up.

I wonder how it plays out at Vorkath since you have to deal with his melee attacks in this case. I guess you also gain the benefit of being able to wear good armor.

Question is, is there anything that the zammy hasta is useful for? Besides dragons?

Lol good to know. Thanks

You: I'm an ironman so I don't care about the economic impacts of this update.
---
Also you: bots are devaluing skilling resources!
---
Which is it? Regardless, shoe-horning every aspect of the game into slayer (and more recently, farming) is not good for the long term health of the game. It homogenises the game. Slayer is already completely overloaded, and ironmen don't need a way to circumvent the only truly challenging skill left through slayer. 
---
I care

Ah yeah I edited it. Meant xarpus
---
Ah for crush bonus?
---
&gt;The only time it is an issue is when PvM crashes the price of a resource, making it not worth skilling for
---
Which has happened for almost every single resource in the game? It was always faster to kill wyverns/zulrah for magic logs than it was to actually cut magic trees themselves. Nobody ever mines coal for smithing, it all comes from pvm. This has been the case for practically every resource in the game. I think the only resources that got away were raw fish but even that's not the case anymore. 
---
Yeah. I swear there was other stuff but nothing comes to mind right now.

IT IS A SICKNASS

That's honestly why I think I make the mistake all the time. Everyone generally says Should've and I live in the midwest, very lazy accents lol. Thanks for the tip though!

When someone grows one fully, they‚Äôll let you know.

Hence why I said give us a option to change it back. The new one is awful...
---
Personally I think they should have just made the attacks do damage on impact instead of when Hydra sends out the attack. Atleast then you have to pay attention to each attack to flick between the prayer.
---
Also let the attacks switch and be random instead of 3 attack switch.
---
It‚Äôll just become a runelite plugin where the boss is mindlessly done.

Alching yew longs it was only a loss of about 500k-600k per 10k alchs. It wasn‚Äôt that expensive. The prices fluctuated so it always varied. But was pretty much a 55k loss every 1k alchs.

We'd have to poll something like that. 
---
You dont even need food for hydra
---
Completely agree. They should buff pearls. leave exp as is
---
To explain it: You have the option of fletching logs at Wintertodt.  The reason to do it is for more points, but the trade off is less exp/hour.  Because you don't HAVE to do it, many people don't know that you can or why you would, so...
---
Why fletch?
---
The chance of extra dense essence was probably the design decision that equates to a certain % more crafted per hour
---
Ores and Logs have been at Alch Prices for years. It is stuff like Fish and Potion ingredients that are more at risk of crashing since they don't have something like Alch Price to hold them up.
---
Looks like a rodent
---
And so was Red
---
Didn't they say in the last Q&amp;A stream that the hydra was going to be more gp/hour than Vorkath? Doesn't seem to be the case (from other posts, not just this one lol), even with the twisted bow method.
---
Why is it fucking stupid to take RWT prices into account? Just because you don't like it? It happens whether you like it or not.
---
*Technically* this DM could be faked as well, but signs are pointing to the 2,500 Brew drop being real.

Yes, I wish Todt had of been focused towards small teams, meaning all worlds would have small teams, subduing the wintertodt with it requiring a bit more effort. I think they should make it that only the top 10 points get the bonus xp at the end of a 'kill'.
---
You can‚Äôt fix the amount of blowpipes in game because they aren‚Äôt consumable. Scales however, are. Just rack up scale usage and suddenly it‚Äôll be a costly weapon to use.
---
If you don't mess up anyway. I'm sure it is harder than it looks, but it would have been nice if there was some unavoidable damage.
---
But I don't think a ton of sara brews is the way to go.. it used to be only dropped by bosses  or made at lvl 81 herblore. Any ironman that gets an early brew drop now has a huuuuuge headstart
---
This speaks truth to me.
---
Faux asked a Jmod directly, on stream, confirmed it was real too. 
---
Thanks for making this post. Just got 2 off money monkeys and made a free 5m for no reason lol.
---
There will always be a BIS, why would you complain about this. In RS3 mage is BIS, here it's range, in RS2 it used to be melee. Nerf range and guess what, d claws /wh + whip meta will ensue.
---
Sold for 92m instantly on the GE
---
or you know, make a boss weak to magic or melee and high range def.
---
There are bots for barrows , slayer , zulrah etc. Those fuck up the economy more than a skilling bot with 100k gp h
---
Yeah, I was hedging my bets. I'll buy them back after they're done crashing to make some sort of profit back. Kind of salty I forgot to even look though. Might use some of the year end bonus to buy bonds :)
---
ive done a 160 blue dragon task and a 140 jelly task and a 11 black dragon task only hit the drop table once and i got like 200 addy unfinished bolts, i don't think its as crazy as everyone thinks, but hitting those herb drops is gonna be kinda nuts not gonna lie, they should scale back the numbers on those a bit i think
---
I think it is just a bit excessive in that a single drop can equate to around 10 times the normal amount gained through a single lower tier task.
---
And 50k other people got nothing. Thats like saying nerf the DWH drop rate because if half the game farms shamans then at least 10 people per kill will get a DWH. 
---
These drops seem wicked rare and therefore justified. 
---
You do realize that herb runs are worth it because it only takes a small time/effort investment at a time. So you can do them between other stuff and when you aren‚Äôt really playing. Also i don‚Äôt think we should funnel all efforts into the best moneymaking methods available. 
---
How you get a temporary marked square every time you left click? Or that the shift right clicking you are talking about?
---
Hey üÖ±eter
---
you got silly lucky tbh
---
I got 5k earth runes and 380 gold ore from all day of slayer 8)
---
No worries did the exact same thing. 
---
Is Konar now the best slayer master for profit or slayer xp? What combat or slayer level should I start getting tasks from her?
---
Twisted bow is fine. Blowpipe need the real treatment as its bis in more places than bow is
---
Way to completely miss the point and purposefully ignoring everything I said. Really making a strong case for yourself.
---
I'll wear my rainbow scarf twice as often and occasionally donate 100k to anyone else wearing one from now on because fuck you.
---
It was necessary when those items came out and it's necessary now. It will never happen though.
---
Its been confirmed by Jmods you brainlet.
---
Don't get me wrong, I do my daily farm run. It was one of my favorite skills to train to 99. I hate the update and how vastly it devalues skilling.
---
I don't care how rare the drops are. 2500 brews should not in any case be a drop in the game.
---
Welcome to EasyScape.
---
Would be a really nice item for magic, but not melee
---
hit the drop table 4 times in a nech task. getting a hit in the drop table every task.
---
[I gotchu fam](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/a=161/farming-timer-rework--skilling-qol?oldschool=1)
---
damn, that glance at the camera for the 4th wall break
---
Completely redundant...are you joking. Ok I‚Äôll give you a week to get me 200 torstol through slayer...didn‚Äôt think so. You could do it in a few hours farming. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter the rate. Why would they choose sara brews when that‚Äôs what they nerfed?? 2500 of any thing else with a similar go/ea would have made SO much more sense. 
---
They are not EHP.
---
You and everyone else who agrees with you is straight up retarded or delusional. Go find another game to play
---
Please add to the discussion:
---
Get your questcape
---
ya maybe they should be nerfed a bit, but if it's that rare then it's fine imo
---
&gt;TL;DR - Makes no sense for a non-iron to argue about acquiring resources when they don't acquire resources themselves.
---
I have an ironman account, and I'm perplexed as to why you put this here. It's not actually a valid tl;dr of anything said so far, or to your new message. 
---
&gt;Perhaps I made the secondary argument about bots so my opinion would be less unpopular. 
---
This is what I was getting at. If you're gonna have an "unpopular opinion", then at least man up and stand behind your slightly controversial ideals. 
---
&gt;I am arguing skilling sucks and slayer is better, and as for me, I prefer that. 
---
Slayerscape is bad. I'm not going to explain why here. It's been debated to death elsewhere by people who care a lot more than either of us.
---
To the rest of your ramble, OSRS is a game of achievements. If you make those achievements easier, then you remove the whole point of the game. It's the "reeee devalue" argument that mockingly gets thrown around here a lot, but there's a reason why that argument comes up in the first place. In two years time, you'll actually be proud your herblore cape. But not if you automatically get it while getting 99 slayer. 
---
I think you would contribute more to your cause by sucking off gay homeless men. 
---
What, how!
---
It‚Äôs not as common as you think. I‚Äôve been slaying for her for 4 hours and not one special drop table drop
---
The rate doesn't matter - the idea is that 192 torstols as a drop feels like an non-creative way of generating a high-value drop. Instead it should be high value unique items.
---
Hit ok great
---
What about the 3rd option my love?
---
But the average gp/hr for afk slayer is much more than doing herbs runs now so I can just buy them, especially with the herb prices crashing 
---
I doubt theyll go up, in fact i would imagine theyll drop pretty low. Marginally better than barrows gloves and mucchhh more niche, also require 80 def and 80 attack and dragon slayer 2
---
Take a seat, dear.
---
Q
---
B-but Faux confirmed that it was legit!! 
---
Guild only.
---
ye true wish it was 2500 magic seeds instead
---
you've tried hespori??? i have a seed and no clue what to do
---
/r/boneappletea
---
You really believe this? Holy fuck. 
---
That would be awesome! My name in game is QTGramps
---
I believe you can get them from Skotizo or something
---
You're right, it definitely do be like that sometimes. If you stay out of the wildy, you can't get slapped though. ^^^Skilling ftw
---
Must be done in the farming guild. 
---
It‚Äôs not meant to be Inferno hard. People do the same shit with Cerb. It‚Äôs just a boss for extra reward on-task but much slower XP/h. 
---
This is it chief 
---
As all things should be.

are those all accurate? like what makes what? thats fucking insane - the dagganoth rings combine.
---
Did you complain about the 10,000 coin drop from gargoyles?
---
Ah well there goes hunting out the window. RIP
---
So are we gonna get a stop to this? Its not really the first time jagex poops their pants bigtime and long term this is gonna completely ruin the game.
---
This post is laughable. 
---
Yup I just did
---
Fantastic, time to never do hunter again
---
I'm a lesbian, but okay.
---
Pretending like people don't do herb runs between slayer lmfao. 
---
The drops are extremely rare, expect one in 3 tasks ish. If you have a lot of points to skip the truly horrible tasks I'd say yes.
---
No....
---
[Indeed](https://i.imgur.com/Btd1JRc.png)
---
this must be a joke, a good one too
---
people it's the only way to exchange gold for any real value you fucking knob. Doesn't matter if it's disallowed. Bond prices only force a price ceiling to gold. RWTing happens whether or not you like it and because of this, there is a real cash value to gold. 
---
Any clips of this happening? I wanna see my favorite streamers getting shit on lol.
---
Should just make another account
---
I didn't say it wasn't.
---
Rick? You mean Rich?
---
How long did the task take?
---
I haven't tried msb yet however moth darts are better and cheaper than iron knives
---
I dont think it‚Äôll be a big problem, you can always attack, walk back and attack inbetween his attacks, and I think tanking it aint too bad with max def and max gear, the problem would be if it aint accurate enough, but if it does hit consistently on vorkath then it should be atleast 2 attacks per shot with the dhcb so I‚Äôd say it has potential, I have personally only done range before on him but my range is only 88 so I can see melee with lance working better for me.
---
It's called a guess. Why else would he have
---
Just ban bots lol
---
Yea looks just like the dragon butt plug I bought last month
---
You using Runelite?
---
How much did you sell the ferocious gloves for?
---
at higher levels sure, it simply doesn't compare to other methods at lower levels at all. 3t fishing at 60 fishing is 4x the xp rate and half the clicking required. Just doesnt seem balanced. I honestly wouldn't mind the xp rates if the pearl rate was increased slightly. 5 in an hour just doesn't feel very rewarding for a few cosmetics. 
---
We out hear grinding for our iron and steel bars br√∂ther 
---
&gt; You're saying it'll be a common drop because of excess herbs
---
No i'm not that's you applying your own meaning to my writings for nefarious purposes and I don't appreciate it. 
---
So many people do slayer that even though these drops are rare they are so OP they are still crashing the prices and making herb runs dead content. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! New content that kills other content on ARRIVAL? Ezscape fool, you don't care about game integrity and I won't stand for it. Meet me on the other side of the ditch with your entire bank. 
---
Yeeaah I'm pretty sure the wiki is right on this. The yield is noticeably bigger when I always forget to equip them and do it halfway through my farming run
---
r/badfaketexts 
---
they havent got their priorities right
---
Yea I‚Äôm just happy that I‚Äôm not LOSING money on slayer tasks anymore haha
---
Rsn W370
---
I don't think naming 4 out of a couple dozen bosses supports that well, but it is used in a lot of places. Still, we have several high level and endgame places were T Bow and even Ranged isn't the to go or best choice. While it is nice when each combat style gets a place to shine, I don't think we need them to be exactly even. Like Magic is used in like 1/5th the bosses as Ranged and that is notable, but Melee and Ranged are both really good at a lot of bosses.
---
Also, if it wasn't the T Bow, chances are it would be the Blowpipe. And you remove both of that, it would probably swap back to being MeleeScape... Anyway, T Bow and Ranged didn't need another place where it is useful but I don't think it is a mistake to add more places where Ranged is good.
---
I love the fact I can finally do something like hellhounds and get something outside of hard clues for once, they just need to fix the quantities a bit on drops. 
---
Again, explain what you meant by those two statements I listed. Stop redirecting the conversation.
---
dang, no wonder my 2 ranarr weeds aren't selling, the market is crashing out from under me
---
Osrs players don‚Äôt give a shit, they want everything but reworks to existing content. 
---
It'd be sweet if we could get The World Wakes but no EoC or Treasure Hunter.  Jamflex pls
---
Very juicy
---
I'd asked in a jokey manner expecting a funny responce about maybe one of his friends being a duche, not getting blocked :/
---
I think every slayer boss hits partially through prayer, except Cerberus and idk about Thermy or Hydra
---
doesnt seem like its getting old anytime soon when osrs has 3-4x the playerbase of rs3 lol
---
Ash mentioned it'll be fixed next update. What I've heard the cause is, is disabling spell filtering. Try it with / without as if it is actually broken that bad it should probably be fixed sooner
---
Though this is free.
---
I literally laughed at this post thinking of Auston Powers poking the mole hahah
---
right? took a sick day on monday and worked on desert treasure, should have held off til today
---
It was in rs3 and I never got the drop getting 99 slayer, so it's probably pretty rare.
---
What? It has little to do with weapons. If a boss has a huge ranged defense and is weak to mage then you would use mage. How does that make mage bis for the whole game
---
People point to tob and say ‚Äúoh look range isn‚Äôt bis there‚Äù. 
---
What... so we‚Äôve had one piece of non range content (which btw still uses range a lot) and now we go back to blowpipey boi content where a 3-4m weapon can wreck every boss much harder than bis melee or Mage??
---
The point is that dragons and drakes and such have always traditionally been weak to stab - they even teased someone using a rapier at hydra so why on release are did they just chuck all that out the window and revert back to camping tbow or blowpipe from a distance. 
---
Imo having melee as the focus of tob made it far more interesting than chambers as you can‚Äôt just safespot, it actually requires attention because being up close to a boss is more dangerous. Just compare a room like bloat to Shamans, it‚Äôs way more engaging and fun. 
---
I just wish we could of had more niche combat mechanics for this boss as the diversity is badly needed in pvm, Mage in particular could have some really neat mechanics if jagex tried but once again another piece of content where it‚Äôs not even used and range is meta.
---
Rant over.
---
&gt; Tbh, I don‚Äôt care how rare that is it should be removed:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;‚Äî&gt; Jagex nerf birdhouses due to the hoe cheap brews became.
---
&gt;‚Äî&gt; Jagex turn around and give large drops of brews to Slayer content + 200 noted herbs like Toadflax too.
---
It sounds like you're thinking with your heart, and while that is admirable, it might not lead to the best results. 
---
As long as the drop rates are rare enough, it will be a unique, balanced kind of novelty drop. 
---
The fact that they nerfed birdhouses doesn't really matter in that regard and makes it seem like you're more personally affronted by that nerf, and thus not thinking with a clear mind. 
---
Because everyone is such a baby about ‚Äúpower creep‚Äù 
---
nice try, Jagex.
---
Thats quite the hot take friend
---
If that were true, then we'd never have any new drop tables. There are tons of drop tables with resources that don't crash the price. Alchs are a common thing on most drop table and a large part of the value of the current RDT. And You can't say that uniques would be worthless in a month when we've seen tons of value uniques. Even the RDT uniques were worth millions for years; they didn't lose value because they were too common but because they were replaced by better items. If there was something useful as a Mega Rare RDT drop or consumable it could easily hold a reasonable value.
---
Konar has a general ‚Äúbosses‚Äù task, you should be able to do Vork for that, no?
---
I definitely agree
---
When RS3 comes out on mobile it will gain a huge surplus as well... if that‚Äôs still happening lol. Seams unlikely with how advanced the game is now. 
---
20 Torstols at 1/250 doesnt seem like much, but when theres thousands of people slaying at the same time the numbers add up.
---
They could've done that for this with each color/form being extremely tanky against two of the styles.
---
TBow is fine because of how absurdly expensive and rare it is.
---
Blowpipe is definitely too strong for how easy it is to get and it's not particularly expensive to maintain.
---
Getting a d spear at Zulrah feels rewarding. That's why. /s
---
Pretty sure its a max hit when overloaded at olm. Other than that they are just worse barrows gloves I think
---
Its a slayer boss. They are meant to be camped and killed hundreds of times and multiple times per trip. True tribrid boss would only leave a few spots for food and would be super click intensive making it not ideal for slayer
---
Because thered be no 'wow' factor.
---
u gotta tell us all what he said
---
PK‚Äôers will often kill people doing clue scrolls , who often have spades in their inventory. 
---
Beats the point of Konars drop table and given the tasks she gives generally are lower XP per hour would be no use going to her unless you specifically want the new content. 
---
Apart from that the idea would be good.
---
Probably keeping it the same, but with bout 10x less for the herbs. This is suposed to be a nice surprise, 100-200k would be a nice surprise drop without destroying herb runs
---
&gt;You're just too busy with Abilities to bother with stuff like flicking now
---
Soulsplit flicking is still very much a thing
---
Because when everyone thinks this, that‚Äôs how you get ‚Äúezscape / rs3 / etc‚Äù
---
You shouldn‚Äôt look just at what‚Äôs good for *you* but also what‚Äôs good for the health of the game. This is unhealthy for the game
---
lmao apparently you've never been anywhere someone crashes. 
---
nice counterpoint
---
that ~1/10k drop rate on the torstols is economy shattering, you're right.
---
Drakes aren't especially weak to magic. You still splash a fair amount in ancestral with trident/sotd due to their magic level despite low magic defense.
---
Even casting flames of zamorak at the start of a kill to lower magic defense and using the new Brimstone ring which has a magic defense piercing passive, in addition to augury ofc, I was splashing at least every fifth attack.
---
Blowpipe is far more practical both in cost and effort. DHCB is probably BIS.
---
Now I feel dumb :(
---
They are in every way better than barrows gloves for melee....
---
I remember doing this on release day. Actually a fun little quest, and the weapons were amazing looking.
---
idk why you got so many downvotes but I appreciate your existence

Toxic and annoying is 2 different things. Someone crashing calling you a idiot and a dumbfuck=toxic someone coming by and crashing=annoying 
---
Reddit is really over-hyping this.  You're not missing much.
---
I would rather not no need to spread his hate.
---
People babyrage if they aren't making money every kill.
---
Support, also make all the materials dropped by Slayer monsters in gigantic stacks
---
Hot take: I bet Jagex does this bullshit every update on purpose to get redditors to complain about OP drop tables, causing those who hear about it to rush to play the game before it gets patched out, thus making the release a "success" based on popularity. I can't comprehend that they would honestly think giving *200 noted herb drops* is good balance.
---
Maybe not 50/50 exactly, but I agree they should both be contributing. That said, it is probably 90/10 with the 90 being farming... Herb Runs bring in a ton of herbs compared to PvM and even a rare drop of 200 noted herbs likely won't sway that much. I mean it is not like every 50 kills players are getting 200 noted herbs; it seems to be one of the rare drops even if some got lucky with them. Still, I'd prefer it be a more common 20 herb drop or such or just less herbs in general since 200 does seem a bit much. But I don't think it is as damaging as the kneejerk reactions make it seem.
---
Their Defence is higher than their Magic so I figured that would probably have been close. Either way, Magic does seem like a good option and if it gets a Dragon Hunter weapon it would probably be undisputed best, but the existing Dragon Hunter weapons should rival it.
---
do u still chew ur shirt?

That's how ~~mafia~~ democracy works

Fairy ring CIR is closest. Just use the nearby shortcuts if you have 62 agility.
---
CIR fair ring then run north (check map if you get lost, not that hard) or use skills necklace to farming guild, and run north.
---
Understandable. Just really weird if someone messaged my asking about a tweet I deleted and they remembered it for some readon.
---
This is hydra boss right? I agree that's too many herbs but it's task only and only has 1 unique drop. We just don't have anything that really keeps its value unless its consumables or alchables. 
---
wow where did u come from
