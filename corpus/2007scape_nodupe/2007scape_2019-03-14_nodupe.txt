There's no defacto 'order' that things need to be accomplished in this game, that's the beauty of it. You can do what you want when you want. Set some goals for yourself and try to complete them, fuck around, bankstand and make some friends. It's your journey.
---
Given that you've got 70 combat stats and barrows gloves, you're in a solid starting position to so a whole lot of things. 
---
Do you enjoy bossing? Grind some Slayer and get your melees, ranged, and magic up. You could afk NMZ for this as well, but doing Slayer will unlock good bosses and tasks along the grind to higher stats. 
---
Do you enjoy questing? Start getting the stats for the QPC one quest at a time. QPC is extremely useful if you don't have the construction level for a fairy ring in your house - the legends guild has a fairy ring right next to it.
---
Want to try Raids 1? Aim for 80 combat stats, 78 herblore, a decent farming level, void and a few other items then check out We Do Raids - they host learner raids every Saturday morning at 11AM EST. Herblore and farming are not required for the learning raids, but they will help if you ever want to start a group of your own.
---
Do you enjoy Castlewars or some other minigame? Fuck it, go play that!

If you had a weapon that was a bit stronger than the Blowpipe that didn't consume scales, would you say that is higher level? Because that is what the Rapier is to the Tentacle Whip and it is honestly a dangerous thing as its current level. If we say the Rapier is what a Level 75 weapon is supposed to be, that means a Level 80 weapon should be even strong... But if we say the Rapier is what a Level 80 weapon should be, which is justified given its perks, then it leads to less powercreep in the progression.
---
Because at the end of the day 99% of the issues that will actually be seen by anyone at Jagex that we post here will never be seen by anyone who could actually change things, and if told they probably just don'r give a shit. Our JMods are competent 99% of the time, its really the higher ups in management and the other teams that fuck up regularly.

It would be kinda ironic if a third-party client hid poll results when once of the reasons against not hiding them is that third-party clients could track and show poll results...

The point i was making is that nobody who sells a tbow will put it in even on accident for less than 100m. And that if they really wanted this to work theyd have to go higher to get lucky

Any speech that does not have the ability to physically hurt another is allowed in the US.  Any speech that has the ability to emotionally hurt another is not allowed in the UK. You don't see the difference and that's because you're an actual mongoloid.

Devil's advocate.
---
Hiding poll results may cause a significant decrease in passing content. Personally I think all the content, save for a few specific examples, have been good updates. The things that were truly bad for the game have failed. 
---
I'd rather polls stay the way they are because the game as it is right now is the best Runescape has ever been.

Osrs streamer who draws on her face with a marker to make herself look like a cat.

Has faked cancer in order to get more donations/subs.  Thus causing this subreddit to hate her. (Rightfully so imo but I'll remain unbiased here)
---
Has been accused of viewbotting her streams and ppl have "proven" this accusation to be true. (Look this up if u actually care)
---
Somehow (dont recall how) a meme started where Mod Mat K had a huge crush on her. Believed it started bc he was always banning ppl in game for harassment bc they would find emily in game and make jokes about her faking cancer.
---
Her nudes have been leaked and are on the runescapegonewild subreddit.

TBH it doesn't help that much. While yeah really there's no reason for it to be allowed, it is a tiny issue compared to the other things people are using rampantly with no repercussions like AHK. 10/10 would rather this not be the hot new issue than the ones that are real problems.

I believe it originated when the dragon visage was first added to the game. Players didn't realize how rare the drop was and were wondering why they weren't getting it. Someone started the rumor that you have to talk to Oziach before you were able to get the drop and it snowballed from there. Just to be clear, there is no item in the game you need to talk to him before being able to get it as a drop.
---
Eh, don‚Äôt worry aboot it. I just noticed the ‚Äúcontest winners never get their prizes‚Äù in the hp/pray bubbles by the minimap. 
---
i dont think that's their way of thinking at all.
---
they're saying it's "game integrity" not because it's "oh come on we all want it anyway so just add it" but because it has a large affect on how content is proposed and added into the game. hiding results should, in theory, mean people vote because they have a strong feeling for/against something instead of voting with the majority. 
---
your comparison earlier with changing if from 75% to 70% is a preference vote, not in the same level as hiding poll results. they should be *very* careful about making changes which haven't been polled but they should also have the balls to make changes which they know will be best for the game.

I don't think they should have stats that make them at all worth using outside of fashionscape, but I think things like this have worked well in the past for rewards for holiday events.

I knew that much, but the end result is the same. If you have the stats for DS2, I'd just knock out the whole quest. Otherwise you have two options: either get the stats for the quest, or use a rock cake. Essentially the same, as you'll be using it to damage yourself just as often regardless of what you use. That is assuming you're using it whenever your hp goes above one. Again, maybe I don't understand why it's better, but this is just my opinion. For example, if it damages you and doesnt let your hp regenerate for a longer amount of time than maybe the orb is better. Spam left clicking isn't that bad imo. GL on DS2 either way, man :) not trying to be an ass so I'm sorry if I seem that way.

Why would you hide polls? ;p Do the belgian‚Äôs system, enforce voting. No vote? Can‚Äôt play.

"preserve the integrity" how exactly? The only way that it decreases integrity is by affecting the way people vote, which is exactly what I said it does. And if the community wants 6hr nmz, that doesn't make them stupid. They just disagree with your opinion. If the community voted for keeping poll results visible, then they should be kept visible. If you can make an argument, in EXACT terms, what form of integrity would be improved by hiding poll results, I'll listen. But I'm willing to bet : you learned the key phrase "integrity" from someone else talking about hiding poll results, and just kinda agreed and never questioned it for yourself. 
---
My argument is simple: 
---
People say visible poll results lead to people voting in a crowd mentality, or in other words, voting with the majority. 
---
A majority of people voted for hiding poll results, which was itself an open poll, and thereby, the exact kind of "integrity loss" you guys argue is happening, happened in YOUR favor, and the poll STILL DIDN'T PASS. 
---
This means, according to the logic of anyone who wants to hide poll results, that even more people would have voted no, had the results been hidden, because they wouldn't have been swayed to vote with the majority who voted yes.
---
The other people who responded to my comment were at least intelligent, pointing out that, perhaps they were voting for the "winning" side, rather than with majority, meaning that if 1/3 of people say no, and it won't pass, they'll vote with them.thats a fair argument. 
---
Just saying "game integrity" is not an argument, if you won't define what, specifically, about visible results is so bad, and how the exact issue you state wouldn't have led this very vote to have been approved. That's how intelligent arguments work. You have to be clear in both stating your own position and evidence, and clear in countering the points of the person you're talking to. You did neither of these.

I also really don't see why people care about cosmetics. I'll care when they add overrides or particle effects like RS3, but it's literally just a stupid boot hat. Treasure Hunter bonus XP and MTX in general killed RS3, not cosmetics. It's an item that a low level will get from a low/med clue then dump into the GE for some money to get started. The worst effect it would have on you is you see one, think "that's ugly" and move on. If they added it tomorrow you probably wouldn't even notice, but people act like it's game breaking lol.

If you want to implement that then proper posts should be man on official site and a few announcements on reddit/twitter etc. (doubt this will happen tbh)
---
Can someone explain the authenticator delay, PVP clan, and poll results controversies? I keep seeing this and do not understand.
---
magic is widely considered to be weaker than ranged when it has to compete against the twisted bow and the blowpipe.  
---
so unless a monster is specifically weak to magic and also really tanky to ranged e.g. barrows brothers, there's usually not a reason to use magic when ranged usually provides the same benefit or better - ranged weapons have higher dps, ranged armour has better defensive bonuses than mage gear, and both have the benefit of killing stuff safely from long range, so why use magic?

more proof here than jagex will ever show. More proof here than what jagex has shown to all the people who were banned.
---
Jagex doesn't need to show proof for bans, they can ban for whatever they want. They don't care about false bans or people wrongly banned, it's the cost of doing business. 
---
Not like people who have a runescape addiction are going to stop playing even if they get banned on an account

add an option to filter all chat based on total level.

Ghostmouse does count as macro major but so does auto clicking, AHK 2:1 and diagonals, and botting as well. It's an umbrella term for automatic input.

Fuck. I didn‚Äôt realize you could hack through my leprechaun. He‚Äôs a solid bro. He won‚Äôt give you any of my info

33% said no or 66% said no? Wake up your ideas pls

Well this is disappointing.

I would afk and stand still a few minutes and get one every lap.

Well that's fucking useless.

He is actually capable of showing poll results too. He is a very handy bro.

I don't think so. I'm not a doctor so maybe I'm wrong but it definitely didn't look like it was dying. Just a massive bubble of pus.

I'm pretty sure it was on his face for way too long if it would've been staph. Shit was there for like months.

Iirc he just had it frozen off or some shit and that was the end of that. No lasting infection or anything. I remember being surprised hearing that.

Judging from your comments on porn related subreddits and your posts on rick and morty subreddits, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is you.
---
why do you enter the wilderness with the expectation of not getting killed?
---
The argument for keeping them visible is that it was voted on and didn't pass. Simple as that. I agree hidden polls are better, objectively, but if it didn't pass the vote, then it didn't pass the vote. If jagex wants to make it an unpolled change they can. If they repoll it and the community votes to hide poll results, so be it. But to say "voting integrity is important" and then suggest if ignoring the results of this poll, or to put it more blatantly, ignoring the votes of people, is laughably hypocritical.

One does not simply quit Runescape... Literally, the only reason i would quit runescape is when it turns into something else than runescape, just like happened with EOC.

Wiki tells me that planting Marigolds protects potatoes from disease. Is that only when the Marigold is fully grown? Does that mean I don't have to give the gardener/farmer 2 buckets of compost?

If you actually think there are tons of false bans happening so they can sell more membership you are delusional. Also do you really think the people taking to reddit crying about being banned for botting really were falsely banned? Think about the thousands of players not botting and not getting banned then look at the handful of people claiming to be banned when they didnt bot. It is pretty cut and dry that the system works, I mean it doesnt catch all the bots bot it also doesnt randomly ban
---
Maybe not the place to ask..but how does one suggest an idea to have for free play...hell any one can suggest it if they want..I think they should add prayer pots to free play..pkers use prayer all the time and it would add more challenge to the fight

Thanks for the reply! Some of that's a little outside my price range but something to work towards!
---
Hey are we not getting an episode today? No problem if not, I just didn‚Äôt hear any update on it.
---
I did appeal, but I didnt see a chance to state a case. I merely had to fill out an information form.
---
I checked that website and my email did not show up.
---
Haven't played RS in about a year and OSRS in a few years, yet here I am, disappointed that I can't watch swampletics, the morytania locked UIM, after my 12 hour wednesday shift. It's honestly something I look forward to so much in the final two hours.

Bad rng, being on task only affects drops for the new slayer monsters recently added with konar, but even then, every drop is receivable off task 
---
He is weeks behind where his account is actually at :/
---
Reason why i disliked the picture is because it's fake. You have 1337 kills, but you did not get the mask in 1337 kills.
---
You should have included the chat ''drop'' in the picture while showing the log.
---
You can cook karambwans as fast as you can use them on the range. 
---
People got so caught up with efficiency they forgot to map the rest of the world
---
I'm sure most of Jagex employees enjoy their job enough to justify the lower pay

Good shit man I‚Äôll definitely look into all this more. Appreciate the help

Start the slayer grind so that you can afk gargoyles etc at higher levels.

This is a decent guide on how to get there with your alt -  https://pastebin.com/qhhk3rqu

What I mean to say is that the content has got better over time...

Must be why when I asked a P mod in game he just says he just ignores them lol

Only a perm ban if the account is new. If you‚Äôre  like 2k total and bot you will most likely get a week ban 
---
They won‚Äôt do it lol
---
Actually, with Jagex, you get neither
---
There's no wrong way to do it, but the xp reward from MM alone is worth it.
---
I don't get why you think there's fake comments but I'm interested to know why.

thats the whole point in my opinion is a giant scare tactic that is well publicized.

Two years worth of membership, or the equivalent in money?

I'm an invested player and I think the boot hat is hilarious. I want it.

Well, if you don‚Äôt want to ruin your zerk like the others suggested (piety/rune dragon alt) you could just use it to kill Zulrah or Vorkath while you afk on your main. If that‚Äôs too much you could make fish sacred eels on it, which is decent gp p/h.

Since you already have a main, I really wouldn‚Äôt break the zerker. Up to you though

Lmao, if only that was the reason rs3 went downhill

B0aty uses Runelite, he has a custom version for the emblem, he's said it himself.  He just turns all the features off so it is essentially the main client.

Questing. Do the Monkey Madness 1 quest path. Do Fairy 1 and start Fairy 2 to unlock Rings, they help SO much in transportation. If you use ranged, go do Animal Magnetism for Ava's.

Get your members skills up as high as you can, base 50s help a lot.

Wildy slayer for money can be a big help. Emblems sell for 160k each.

Right now what I'm doing is farming hard clues. It's a lot of fun and whenever a clue requires something I don't have yet, I go get that requirement. I got my first 1m clue today feels good.

why

I meant it only as in rolling back a total of like 500-1K exp maybe for people who have messed up an accounts build because of a small mistake. However skill prestige/resetting at 200M exp would be interesting for the maxed players.

Either that or try the runelite discord - I've always found it helpful.

Good lord. You farmed 1k mossy keys? I bet you made more than the boss loot in Ranarr Seeds alone.

I hope I'm real.

Petition to have tbow outside or farming guild instead. 
---
Yeah, that would make sense, you can only really identify that someone is a pmod if they speak. Therefore if they rock round with public off, no one will abuse them for not muting bots every 3 seconds. "this will never happen" but if the community as a whole stops using them the numbers will die down. I  could attempt to bring it up at a pmod meeting, however, like all integrity change requests id just be ignored. Might as well just keep slamming them about this issue on reddit till they revoke my status

How? Once cash maxes at 2147m how can it sell more items?

Flesh crawlers or chaos druids for herb drops. Bit harder but prob more profitable would be green drags (they are in wilderness tho) or blue drags but you would need to safe spot mage them. If you havnt gone for your dragon defender yet it is decent exp and you make a decent amount of cash from alchables by the time youve finished and its decent combat exp

It'd be cool if Jagex reworked the god armours to have a more unique appearance than just trimmed rune. Like add some features here and there to make them all slightly different in their own ways.

Everything is 50/50 man, you either get it or you don‚Äôt

Probably in Morytania.

in the poison/wooxwalk phase your damage is halved. so if your first shot after the scorpion is a tick too late, 6 attacks later when the acid starts, your 7th shot will be in the acid phase with halved damage. a tick earlier and it'd be before the acid phase, and therefore full damage.

Well, funny enough, dopamine would be the chemical released in anticipation for an event such as a new swampletics episode. But it would not be produced during so today we can have both :)

Nice idea. How about having an increase in catch rate provided you wear the correct outfit for the respective hunter area. Perhaps the wolf outfit could be universal w/ an increased catch rate. 
---
Can confirm
---
nope. you can straight up log into two accounts now and trade. alts are a known thing and jagex is cool with it. just can't use multiple accounts to fuck with minigames.

Seriously. It‚Äôs 5 minutes up to 15 minutes if you want to enjoy it. There is no excuse, it‚Äôs funny how they chose to ignore showers but tend to not forget to eat. Accumulating them lbs per hour like it‚Äôs xp. My cousin back when I was like 11 used to play a certain MMO, and these were the days of dial up and anyways, he was like medium build (overweight by like 30-40 pounds), he was gaming non stop and eventually became hella thin, he just forgot to eat plus wasn‚Äôt eating fast food/junk food. Usually it‚Äôs other way around. With great exp gains comes the great pound gains. I guess nature balancing it‚Äôs self out, lol

The Slayer skill is what i mea. As for defence: i always keep that skill as my highest combat skill. It helps with training as you need less food thus less bank trips to refill your inventory with food. Also helps survivability in the wildy

Wrong. It was originally Dragon Dagger (s) when poisoned with super poison
---
I understand where you're coming from, but bumps aren't as necessary on reddit as they were on more traditional forums.

66% is the majority, and you have to remember that botters and merchers and noobs are the people who  vote no

I did MEP2 at 55 agility this morning. Took me fucking hours. Fucking hours.

I did it on a level 3 account and it was fairly fast from what I remember. I had to constantly bank to get more food since I was constantly taking damage but even then it wasn't that big of a bother.

I had this same thing just now when logging in on mobile. The UI showed, and I could see HP bars (I was in the Catacombs and someone else was fighting), but the whole screen was black. Someone there said it was a cache issue. Closed the app completely out and relogged, problem gone. I think in my case, the app was still open in the background when an update came thru.

what do you mean? the results will only be hidden until you voted not forever. as soon as you vote you would see the results.
---
The reason this poll failed is because its worded so fucking terribly that people think like you do.
---
I got muted for saying you're welcome one time ... Because it had the word com in it which they associated with a website ending in .com
---
I was so pissed. Although it was super easy to appeal, it was absurd.
---
Totally agree we need to start punishing players for using bots. Even with a highly active and professional moderation team, these bots will just keep coming back with new iterations of throwaway accounts faster than you can ban just one. Whilst the demand for RNG bots exists, the bots will come to satisfy that demand. Only when we start attacking those who create the demand will we be able to kill the bots. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard either, just look at the trading history for these bots and ban away, next time follow the rules and actually play the fucking game properly. Or you know, fuck off back to Fortnite or whatever trash that kids play these days.
---
What path or methods did you use getting to 99
---
I always wonder what people will blame once poll results are hidden
---
what? do you even know what you're talking about or are you just making assumptions out of your ass about how humans work? There are studies done to prove that hiding the polls does help prevent cognitive bias.
---
Fuck up retard, he will upload it when it‚Äôs ready. He‚Äôs probably stressed enough getting an excellent video ready every week
---
That's some good time played for your first 99 I wish you luck, enjoy the journey :)

He said he did all but like 3 quests, that is actually a lot of work. More work than most people put into their accounts tbh.

Saw on their Q&amp;A post that someone is currently looking at the issue.

...wut. Drunks reek, dude. 
---
You have to change your name again then the original name you want will be available 
---
So what happens is once you change your name, your account has 2 ign associatedwith it. So people can add your previous name and still add you. If an account says ‚Äúpreviously known as ____‚Äù then that previous name is tied to that account.

But redwoods aren't the best xp. 1.5t teaks are, in fact there are three different kinds of teak tick manipulation that all give more xp/h than redwoods so you can choose the one that fits your autism tier.
---
In fact, teaks are about 50% better than redwoods even if you don't do tick manipulation. The benefit of redwoods is they have extremely long afk times, not that they give good xp.
---
Imagine being this ignorant about what happened and thinking you know anything lmao
---
Honestly, it should depend on combat level. almost all of these fucking things are sub-40 combat. Chances are if you're under 40 combat and get muted, you probably were doing something very wrong or very annoying on purpose.

But doesn't that mean that everyone would jump on clicking yes?

Sounds like hes addicted to video games/some other mental illness. Or he just has no hobbies, goals or ambitions in life.

As long as you have stats and gear for it, you'll be fine.  Fight is not instanced.

I fully agree with your suggestion. Unfortunately, many people seem to disagree too for whatever reason.

I made a post about this a few days ago:

They‚Äôll just do what all the RWT bots did and start putting random spaces and symbols in their text to get past the automatic filter.

Hey yeah let's do this. o/

I‚Äôm out of the loop here... I‚Äôve seen the crabs but what do they actually mean?

I believe there was code in the game that made you catch with a higher rate wearing those clothes, but it has been broken since the skill was launched.

I have a strong desire to post something in there about xp waste and/or authenticator delay but I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôd just get banned.

I would suggest donating the 500k towards the new exam center wing. I got my son to Warrior's guild by paying the cost for the basement. 
---
Once you start autoclicking with flying mouse movements levelling bank-standing skills that are invisible for other players, Jagex still detects that quite fast.
---
Probably something in the lines of:
---
"if (cursorMovement = flying &amp;&amp; autoClicking &gt; 50ClicksPerSecond &amp;&amp; errorsInClicking &lt; 1%):
---
     #monitor this player further
---
"
---
They could easily add the usingPrayers script and monitor all players like they currently do anyway.
---
That of course if the whole prayer reordering would be against the rules, which it probably isn't.
---
Just a thought.
---
Wow the women in that thread are so freaking needy. Whenever I feel lonely for a bit I read a topic like that and my desire for a relationship is cured very fast.
---
Mhm, perhaps. I guess it's like 1-2 weeks of playing? Could up it to 600 total, 50 hour ingame and 30 day old acc.
---
Stop
---
No. I said members should be viewed more favourably in votes i.e. more votes for a member vs a f2p. Plus they could just do a total skill lvl so for example. A f2p 500 skipl lvl would have 6 votes: 1 originally plus 1 for every 100 skill he has. Lets make that cap at 1000 skill lvl cause why not. Another example: a 200 skill lvl member could have 6 votes: two initally and 2 per 100 skill lvl

Hackers don't just "know" RS players' emails from the brain in their arse. You must've used your email or shown it somewhere RS related e.g. buying gold, signing up to RS services, signing up to giveaways, social media etc.

You‚Äôre getting downvoted because no one said it was overrated. 
---
F2P should not vote on P2P content, and skillers can easily get 300 total as well.
---
Thea idea of that disgusts me, I'm not condoning RWT by any means, but breaking a friendship for breaking an in-game rule is so slimy. 
---
sell them for 1,5m

I would advise to train some more before starting to pk. You are in a combat bracket that can be attack by mains and pures. Not a good position to be in while in the rev caves.

&gt;Edit: still no source, 1% of 100 is smaller than 1% of 10000 btw.
---
1) Why wouldn't you say this to me in a reply instead of editing your post? I only saw your edit because I was curious to see if anyone else responded to this
---
2) I don't really get what you mean by this. The source says that, of all the crimes the FBI considers to have been motivated by sexual-orientation bias, 2.8% were committed against straight people, with the remaining 97.2% being committed against LGBT people. Since there are more hate crimes being committed against gay people than straight people, and far fewer gay people than straight people, you can therefore determine that gay people are more likely to be the subject of hate crimes than straight people. There's really no other way to interpret this data.

You know not everyone who has cancer dies from it. Terminal implies you will. 
---
For me, I have a Dagannoth task as slayer, so I'm doing Rex. Even though my magic is 75, it's better to use slayer staff over Ibans as it has no extra cost (while Ibans has a charging cost), and mind runes are plentiful since I am currently farming Barrows as well (where Ibans is much better off-task).
---
Never said she didnt lie, the cancer she claimed to have simply does not have to be terminal. Its only terminal if you get it late in life.

I wouldn't be surprised if this dude's looking to swipe the next scythe or tbow drop to make up a little bit of what he spent buying the cape or something else slimy.

Obviously lied cause he knew what a slime ball his "friend" was. Was probably afraid to be reported/judged. This guy went to the extent of creating a Reddit post to "expose" a friend.

Hitting the "bad" option could be a good guess but the wiki is throwing me off. Its saying you can't get in there AT ALL, only view it.

if you're concerned about the high cost of ranaar seeds, toadflax seeds are pure profit even if one (or two) patch dies. Also, always use magic secauters (idk how to spell it) and use ultracompost.

I just don't get how they can't automate the detection &amp; banning of these bots. There is so much similarity in all their messages and behaviour, there must be a way, no?

why is everyone saying to keep it untrimmed? isn't it better stats/style if it gets trimmed?

Nice

So they would actually need to sell 2000 bows? Because if that‚Äôs how it works now (and idk not rich enough to know) this method wouldn‚Äôt work either.

---
A couple things on this post...
---
#1 Practice is not spelled with an 's' idk about the correct spelling in the U.K. though.
---
#2 The update to Hosidius is going to make the xeric talisman teleport shittier for herb runs as redirected Hosidius House tab will now be closer to the farming patch albeit being much easier to obtain. This devalues using xeric talisman even further.
---
Be a cool Cape to add to max cape

This sub does have a serious problem with complaining. Only recently got back into RS and everytime I come to this sub, its losing it's shit and insulting Jagex over something small. 
---
Pretty ungrateful/rude considering all Jagex interactions that I've personally seen have been positive or them sincerely asking for feedback on how to make the game better.
---
Was just about to say this. Probably wouldn't care too much if it was a mate than I spend time with outside of the game, but I'd ditch an RS friend without a second thought if he did something as slimy as bragged &amp; lied about a bought Infernal. There's zero respect left for people like that in the context of the game so why even bother?
---
Thanks man :)
---
Copypasta please?
---
I need to do 62-87 crafting soon, which is roughly 7000 seaweed and 55,000 buckets of sand.
---
At sandpits that would be just under 1mil in law runes, and at this new place it would be just under 2.8mil.
---
Really depends on the difference in speed, and if you have a heap of money to throw into the abyss. I can't afford to throw away that much money because I need it for other stuff, but maybe if you were higher level and doing 90-94 or something it would be more appealing.
---
The only thing they need to do to make rdt better is making it an additional drop like a clue scroll instead of replacing the normal drop.

Yeah, and you get massive profits from battlestaffs anyways.

So some back story and,  let me start by saying,   I'm a 30 year old guy been playing this game since , hell 2005, 2006 ? Always legit,   I'm not some max stat 14 cash stacks pro pvm/pvp/skiller hell my rs3 account still only has like lvl 60 farming. 07scape I'm like a level 60 combat  noob who does Skilling on mobile, 
---
The last time I played was February 24th , I was fishing in lumb, not 3 tick not even 2 tick .... just... fishing,  chatting with an old friend.
---
I dont really take my runescape time seriously anymore. mobile had allowed me to log on chat with old friends and do some simple Skilling and just get that nostalgia injection.
---
So ya I dont know if I was hacked or it was a glitch on their end but ... this kinda sucks 
---
Time for a rollback

Awesome job! Do you paint the print afterwards or during printing?

You're either going for the fury grind and have enough money to afford 50gp.. or you're low level and have other alternatives to get buckets of sand.

Same here, if I'm gonna sit at home all day I won't use deodorant. Or shower, likely. Thing is though, your lifestyle and probably genetics affects the smell a lot. Back when I was a slob I'd start reeking an hour after showering. Nowadays if I'm not gonna be doing any physically intensive stuff/walking a lot/sitting in a bus or similar horribly hot area I can go the whole day without deodorant and I don't even smell in the evening.

It is a good method. This subreddit is just furious they didn't get their 5x sand collections rates for free and completely afk.

This sub doesnt actually want to fix ironman crafting issues, they just wanted to be given 99 crafting for free. The biggest fucking complaint is "reeeee cost me 2 mil" as if they're going to be making a torture at 500 total level.

Gambling is a game, and just like any other game it has mechanics that can be manipulated to tailor the player experience.

People opt into this gameplay, and while the very nature of gambling enables patterns which can lead to addiction, it can be mitigated and offered in clean legal ways that allow people to partake in the activity.

I am also going for 99 rc. I purposefully left firemaking at 98. I'm only 68, so still got a while to go. Ironman btw.
---
Yep, it's fairly rare though. Only happened to me once in maybe 20hrs there
---
I've never used ancestral, but I've used ahrim's instead. I found that the extra mage bonus is unnecessary. You only need mage accuracy against nibblers, and they have negative mage defenses. You can still hit a majority of the time even wearing the bandos. The majority of the damage you take will come from the first 5-30 seconds of each wave where you have multiple attack styles attacking you. Bandos has the second BIS ranged defense bonus and that helps block alot of the damage while you kill off the monsters you're not prayed against. Bandos chest also does not interfere with ava's devices so you can range with it.
---
This game is visual garbage, so it fits.
---
Removal of max cape? What's going on?
---
What are you on about? The giant seaweed is still very useful.
---
Haha I should make some prayers to go with it

As a married person her going back to school has been amazing. Swear to God she assumes every waking moment needs to be spent together in some regard. I love her but personal time is needed too.
---
This doesnt seem to be the case for the one posted here just throwing it up as the reverse side.
---
I disagree,  we all know how the report abuse function works. Snap shots of in game activity and chat logs are often not even remotely effective at countering internal cape purchasers. I wish that I had a colder heart, i would have many high levels banned for all the rwt and botting.
---
I've done the long haul too, don't think you're a special flake here.
---
Nobody asked for mining XP along with it. It was requested that there was a lesser tedious way of obtaining sand instead of having to manually fill sand 1-by-1 in a pit.
---
Paying 50 gp for a bucket of sand is ridiculously expensive for a gamemode where it takes loads of effort to generate said gp. 
---
Of course you can be a high level Ironman and easily generate that money, but this shouldn't cater to just high levels or people that have stacks of cash.
---
Why?
---
Unpopular opinion: That cape looks cool. 
---
Youll need 70+ farming, at least mid 70s herblore. Mining is useful as well as thieving. Combats as high as possible. Solo gear void isnt amazing. Watch raid guides for solos :)
---
? Same for buying runes from wildy shop and ores at BF. You will hit the log in limit at some point, idk how you do it without but it must be slow af.
---
Only missed Mogres, thanks!
---
Nh pking is probably the most difficult content next to inferno in game.
---
You need quick switches, precise clicking, quick thinking and also getting in the mind of your opponent, by doing fakies and predicting his attack styles.
---
Really, gear up in NH gear and go brid, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get maybe 1/2 freezes off and you‚Äôll be dead in no time.
---
No one got a substantial amount from that, but w/e
---
I thought the game dwindled because there was no F2P, at least that is what I heard at the time. A few months for endgame is a pretty harsh judgement tho. People who started in 2013 had no intention to leave anyway, it was casual hop on and off players that are present just as much if not more today.
---
F2P player base is pretty big even today. And I have no doubts that it took quite a heavy toll on OSRS at the start since almost 500k people voted on the poll to release it. Most of them weren't even EOC players, since EOC had such a low player count at the time. 
---
Not 3-ticking teaks is also better exp
---
RNG is a bitch. 
---
Happens sometimes yeah. I've spend atleast 20 hours over there running in circles and usually it didn't happen at all. However, when it did happen it was usually every 10 - 20 minutes or so. 
---
Why would anyone upvote this
---
Definitely trolling, there's no way it's real.
---
woah 10k giant is huge! I haven't even tried farming seaweed because It seems really hard to get the spores :l
---
It looks like a cheap shower curtain
---
Kinda a bitch move, but I agree with keeping the cape more exclusive 
---
As it stands, charter ships w/ lens is 80k xp/hr
---
Giant seaweed + yanille buckets is around 45k
---
Even with your theoretical 30-40% increase this new method is very underwhelming.
---
Unless you have low slayer, it should for itself. 
---
But other than that I think it would be too difficult considering prices fluctuate and displaying a profitable money maker in real time seems near impossible (majority of people would gravitate towards the top earner ) 
---
Some money makers are staples in the community though. There are plenty of them in both F2P and P2P.
---
Mind sharing your stats or IGN? Pm me if you have any other questions
---
You can have a trimmed one too on the side. The reason to keep it untrimmed is for people to always know that RC was your first one. Other untrimmed capes could be emberessing, but not this one.

If you bring nature runes and fire runes you can just alch all the drops and make a profit.

I have 50 slayer and just got a blue dragons task, I made almost 200k from the hides and alching drops.

I don't want a time capsule. I want to continue where we left off.

But you can kill (some type of) dragons without the shield? Safespot/flinch.

And no reqs to access for all these dragons: green dragons in wildy, blue dragons in taverley dungeon (65/70 agil or dusty key), black dragons in wilderness, bronze/iron/steel/red dragons in brimhaven dungeon (33 agil).
---
I know you can unlock red dragons with Slayer points. 
---
But I think you indeed need Dragon slayer started or completed to get green/blue/black/bronze/iron/steel assigned, but I can't find a source.
---
You right, you right
---
Must suck to constantly die to "brainlets" 
---
I swear to god its like Jagex literally does not test their own shit or consider the idea of balancing things with their updates.
---
Well, actually when it comes to testing their shit I think we know for a FACT at this point they do very little if any testing with how often there are major bugs and problems, there simply wouldnt be anywhere near the frequency of large bugs if they did.
---
Yeah I was so hesitant to dl RSB because I got so many accts banned from 04-10 because of OSB and botting. When people talked about it I was like damn people are so open about botting now a days...
---
remindme! 1 day
---
I'm the same as somebody else posted. When I first came back I was very much against new content. When you've been playing for a couple of years though that nostaligia fades away and the burnout creeps in. I was anti mobile because of the massive increase of brainlets that came in (gotta admit that seeing Lumby Goblins rammed at launch was sick though) and the impact of lots more AFK'ing. My heart tends to be anti anything big that changes the game up too much, but my brain tells me that it's mostly for the good of the game.
---
Not related to my first paragraph, but just make an ironman. You get to completely ignore most of the issues of the game IMO.
---
Roll back would be nice üòÇ 4/10 brimstone keys were essence this morning.

Every time you post you do so like an angsty teen. It's pretty obvious you're a young'un, physically or mentally. You're too young to be angry at everything.

Do people really want poll results hidden until the poll ends? It was my impression that a lot of people just wanted them hidden until they had submitted their votes. 
---
1 billion percent this is someone on the inside making a crap ton of money 
---
What if you printed the poses as well? Would that be difficult?
---
How much for an painted sgs? With the ornement kit.
---
"Infiltrating" lmao. Like your public forum is some secret club. Also imagine unironically disparaging hentai on the fucking internet. 
---
See I‚Äôve been doing that. I yield maybe 7-8per patch on average (53 farming with ultra compost). Seeds are 41k and ranarrs  are selling at 6.6k. That‚Äôs like a 15k profit per patch. Is it true magic secretars help? (I‚Äôve had them sitting in my bank)
---
could you show them off aswell?
---
What do we do with them once caught?
---
Don‚Äôt know anything about pures, never played one, never played against one. Never stat inspect people either, if a dudes in black dhide chaps, thats just a dude in dhide chaps to me.
---
Clearly the issue is I voted on something I was unaware I had no knowledge over, hence my criticism of the wording of the poll. Even a simple ‚Äúclick here for an in depth explanation‚Äù or not wording it badly would have helped.
---
But yeah, stay angry over a small mistake
---
Would also love to get one. How big are they
---
Friendly reminder that this reddit represents a minority of players in OSRS and the campaign berating Jagex for not hiding poll results is a farce.  
---
Hiding poll results is a scapegoat for people not getting what they think is best for the game (or themselves).
---
Ok freak.

That maf took my name.

Here's the rates confirmed by mod wolf,

https://i.redd.it/gceahgbfo2m21.png

Seems high estimate though, I've been mining for 1h and only got 2.8k sand at 85 mining
---
Nah I was only able to find an ely spawn unfortunately. It‚Äôll have to do I guess...
---
&gt;99 crafting
---
Lmao yeah sure thing bro.
---
In reality most people just want their 90 crafting done as quickly and painlessly as possible.
---
This won't still remove ships since buying ash off charters will always be faster than farming giant seaweed. If you are going to do carters, might as well buy your buckets from there as well instead of using a more click intensive and slower method.
---
Beautiful art, I'd love to see more.
---
Doesn't this depend on mining level? But regardless: charters can only be done by a very limited number of accounts at the same time, after that competition makes it inefficient. So even if charters are (slightly) better than sandstone on balance the meta would include both.
---
Recently there's been this big push on reddit to make hating on Jagex the "cool" thing, and while they are constantly fucking things up, this is completely on you. They release dev blogs with every single poll to break down their reasoning for the subject being polled. Every single one. If you are misinformed or ignorant of a topic, vote anyway, then complain that you didn't know any better, that is 99% of the time on you. You're the one at fault here. Sorry. 
---
it wouldnt have just made the regular whip useless, with a str option it would have always had the same max hit a tent whip as well making it useless too
---
Sometimes people just play this game for fun.

---
Nope, mobile issue too. So it'll be official client problem. 
---
My bet this is exactly the case, if I recall correctly from the recent RuneScape birthday stream the gowers attended.. Andrew talked about his new project where he has created a ‚Äòstatically-typed programming language‚Äô for his new game and which will help with developing games of all kinds in the future, to me it sounded like this is something that jamflex are holding out for so they don‚Äôt have to put the work in to understand and de-spaghetti the engine code. 
---
Cringe

Can you make my in-game character looks awesome!

Maybe Jagex would like to invest in this...

That picture was fake though
---
You seem to not understand the wider psychological context of the issue 
---
I think they need a new weapon of some sort. What if they went with some kind of new javelin or spear, that game some defensive bonus as well, but had decent dps, maybe the DPS of the rune cross bow. This combined with the armor set affect would be decent. Their elves to me a spear or javelin fit the best! May not be as much dps as a blow pipe but could still be really useful and make range tank a thing, as well as decent for soloing.   
---
100% accidentally dropped it, back to rooftops you go. 
---
Leak that shit. 
---
Really? Worked fine on two accs on official client and when I switched to RL it was messed up
---
What's the thing with anime thighs?
---
Seeing as this has been how you train construction since it‚Äôs release in 2006, it‚Äôs definitely not going to be changed, and it doesn‚Äôt deserve to.
---
UwU
---
Also, you can set a minimum price for something to show up, so 30gp items and stuff like that are hidden automatically.
---
The entire reason the poll failed was because it was poorly worded, loads of people have said they had no idea about this basic, common aspect of the game your 200iq self has. 
---
Wether you like it or not, the vast majority of voters don‚Äôt read the blog in its entirety, having polls fail on this basis isn‚Äôt great now is it?
---
You accidentally dropped it. Go pick up some marks
---
It started out with a drop party basically, he was dropping standard items you'd expect to see in a drop party. There were a bunch of us there around 20. After a few drops someone said "hey you double too right?" And the scammer was like "sure yeah!" 
---
I was skeptical at first but after seeing him double five or six people I was like fuck it and put 5m up. He never traded back, a bunch of other people didn't get doubled either. Looks a clan operation with a few of them faking the doubles to convince the majority of us.
---
I stuck around an extra few minutes after the scammer logged and then this guy appeared who saw most of it and personally traded us what was left what we had lost. I declined at first but he insisted it was okay. I am very very grateful towards that player.
---
I feel like an absolute idiot as I avoid people doubling but was too easily convinced this time, lesson learned.
---
Reporting someone automatically puts them on your ignore list. 
---
90% lmao you'd be surprised
---
Currently doing the grind for fury. In my opinion update is underwhelming for me personally. 
---
Sandstone method is definitly faster, about 1.5-2x as fast as collecting sand through yanille. But comes at its price. 50gp per bucket. I needed 40k buckets to that makes 2million GP. The law runes cost would be between 300-400k for the same 40k buckets.
---
Also, sandstone is waaaaay more click intensive.
---
So basically, I'm collecting buckets through yanille mainly because it's far cheaper, and i can do other things like netflix on the side since its way more afk.
---
Or be stepped on by
---
Good cape

Only if you can save up enough welfare money to pay for it and be sober enough to walk to your mailbox
---
Back in the RS2 days when dicing was getting really bad (almost like what we have now but with real players scamming instead of bots) they updated the game so that if anyone said "hc x2" (or words to that effect) you were immediately muted for a day. 
---
Being efficient at charters also requires lunars and some people might want to grind out certain crafting levels before lunars, or have some kind of personally set restriction that prevents lunars
---
Lol I remember dancing for money, I never saw anyone get anything. 
---
One with 0 marks of grace but the best xp/hr
---
The coolest 3d print ive seen so far

Especially since the old method still exists.  No one's forcing you to use this one and pay the 6m for 99.

Karambwans are love + life. They give 190 xp each when cooked, and they can also be 1-tick cooked if you're looking to get the cooking done faster. They're a lot faster to catch than monkfish, so even with a higher burn-rate you're probably looking at more cooking xp/hr with Karambwans.

Haven't done minnows myself, so I can't comment. I'd rather claw my eyeballs out than spend that much time trying to get the outfit.

Most shows I'd play or even go to, unless they were metal shows, no one moshed. Ever. Really disappointed in that side of my state.

6m is ridiculously cheap for such an insane method. How is it only 6m? Should be 30m.

" Should the Defence requirement found on Blessed forms of D'hide Chaps be removed? Currently they require 40 Defence to equip. "
---
It's clear as day. This literally comes down to you, and the other people who don't know such a simple thing about one of the most iconic pieces of gear in the entirety of runescape. I don't know why you're being so defensive. Just own up to it, and promise yourself that you'll shy away from voting on stuff you don't know anything about. Either that, or spend 20 seconds googling "osrs black d'hide chaps". It's really that simple.
---
and spending the time filling the grinder with sandstone that you have to mine.

Ash said the sysadmins are working with the host provider to fix the issue

Yeah his UIM series were so far apart I would forget about it entirely until it showed up in my feed. And his episodes usually has these massive goals of like 90-95 prayer doing only pest control or some shit so it‚Äôs no wonder they took so long.
---
Yep this gave it away. 
---
Then explain it, i will always explain my train of thoughts so people can disprove it. It should be mandatory
---
Even as an Ironman I don't like this update, I feel the game is being catered for us. The point of ironman was to play to the limitations of the  previous game and work through them, but the game is being updated to suit our needs.
---
IMO, this specific update isn't QoL, QoL is the quest pane with the sub-sections or the Varrock museum findings, not an update that makes it significantly easier to get sand for the giant seaweed, which again was mainly an ironman only update.
---
Fully expecting to be downvoted to oblivion.
---
I did this for a while, too, but the cost per cast w/ the tome, as well as the battle staff investment, is just not worth it to me compared to Iban blast. That‚Äôs actually why I finally did UP in the first place, to save money on barrows.

Did you not acknowledge other items in runescape before you decided to suggest this. Items never had crazy detail and add this detail doesn't make it look better. It makes it unrecognizable and to totally ignore how items were created prior to 07 is a quick way to stray away from the original oldschool look and feel with its art style.

I'm happy to wait, more so if it's for quality reasons.
---
There is no "supposed to" method of farming. Because there are so many options you get to choose pretty much exactly how much gp/xp you want to spend and how quickly you want the levels. If you're content to get 99 in a year, papaya trees and calquats will get you there eventually. If you want 99 by the end of the month you can do snape grass in every allotment, torstol, and all the trees in the game.

Not really, no. It's a nice bonus to get but I'd rather go MLM for mining experience or even do charters + granite to save time.

Then don‚Äôt do it at low and mid tier?
---
The concept has always been 75% yes. This criteria was not met and therefore should be considered failed just like any other poll. Everyone is talking out of context "Well hurrdurr the majority wants it", but we're not just polling with the majority's intentions, but 75%'s intentions.
---
Better than mixing wines!

Oldschool wouldn't be half as big without 3rd party clients, no wonder they don't want to outright ban them.
---
Will we be getting any pvp updates this year? Bhv2 when? ;(
---
Very weird to see how much people on here consider this guy an awful human being just for buying an inferno cape.  I mean the guy deserves a ban if true, but its just a game chill out guys lmao.
---
&gt;how was anyone supposed to clue in that didn‚Äôt already know, that black d‚Äôhide chaps didn‚Äôt require defence?
---
The same way you know rune requires 40 defence without having to look it up. You completely dodged my question earlier on why you're voting for stuff you have zero knowledge in, but hey man, you keep living in victimhood. It's Jagex's fault you didn't know something so basic about the game, made a poor decision, and now the game has been affected due to your and many others' ignorance. That's all it comes down to. When an ex-Jmod is baffled by the stupidity of the community in this game openly, you know there's some truth to it. That's all.

this is fake

If you ever get bolts you're doing it wrong.

Reading this made me remember that the slayer task icon for Fire Giants once was a Fire staff, is this still a thing? 
---
No you're not. You're not forced to look at the results before voting, and even to put it at that stretch, you're only looking at a couple of the polls, not all of them, before you're able to click the "vote" button.
---
~~thankyou~~
---
Did you forget that Ironman isn't the default game mode and the fact that there are even updates specifically tailored to the minority of players that play Ironmen is incredibly generous of Jagex to begin with or is that too difficult of a concept to grasp while you're sitting over there crying about it
---
This works if you print in ABS, but it won't do anything if you're printing with PLA or others.
---
PVP doesn't need updates, it's fine as it is. 
---
It does that with all maple trees in patches. Not just the guild patch. 
---
Consider adding a low defense prayer armor for ranged. Similar to how initiate and prossy work for melee. Could have stats like studded or snakeskin with added prayer bonus.
---
Absolutely 
---
scandals with a florida uni, probably more i just specifically heard about a florida one, where parents would pay the schools off to let their kid in, sometimes would pay proctors of the sat and act to change answers/do it for their kid, sometimes it was 'as little' as $5k but sometimes as much as millions, according to what i heard last night. basically admissions scandals, the fbi did an investigation i think, but whos surprised with how many fucking idiots are in some prestigious schools.
---
You are gonna be stuck with 3 open GE slots forever my friend
---
I've tested it, whit trident and thamm, and have not noticed a difference, accept when you get pked you lost all the runes also
---
I liked it for a similar reason mod West liked them. I liked the pun equipment, but I do somewhat dread seeing how many would wear the boot...
---
if you say they have access to your bank pin and you have a fresh install of windows EACH TIME, you might be getting hacked from an IRL friend lol
---
What setting do you have on that tells you that a rare item dropped in your chat???
---
&gt; it's cheap for anyone that plays the game for more than a couple of months.
---
No, it's not.
---
There is like 2b+ of items that are used for combat that people buy. You're not going to drop 100m on construction when you can buy a new, better item instead.
---
&gt;introduction of GE absolutely ruined the game when it was implemented in the original RuneScape.
---
Are you sure the thing that ruined the game wasn't EOC, removal of free trade etc? 
---
&gt;It introduced flipping and most vile filth of all, the merching clans.
---
Flipping was, is and will always be a thing, regardless of whether or not there is a ge. 
---
&gt; Do I need to remind you of the climbing boots scandal?
---
Has nothing to do with GE?
---
Unsure if you're trolling or have an inability to think critically for 3 seconds. Goodbye.
---
So in your eyes Zeah looks totally in place with the rest of the Original Runescape map?
---
You made a very similar post a week ago and you're going to get very similar responses.
---
It's fine how it is and jmods are working to improve it.
---
Collecting sand in yanille and farming giant seaweed was already better than the shop meta. But its still nice to have another method that is somewhat faster and adds skilling xp.
---
Idk i like zeah, im happy theyre doing more content over there all the time
---
Fair enough. Keep fighting the good fight then. 
---
do you want it fixed or not? w335
---
Lol
---
No xp waste means splashing somehow comes out too be an okay training method.
---
 Sure it just burns money and doesn't result in anywhere near optimal xp rates, but you would be getting zero xp instead so suboptimal is still optimal.
---
It's fine by me. A little big, but the teles are fine.
---
So lets say you have a maxed in actual 2007, what would you then go do with it?
---
Did you seriously watermark a meme?
---
Amazes me how your being down voted.
---
These are really cool thanks!
---
Also these are my stats. Im thinking of training range to high level. Also i want to get thw spell books and so much more. 
---
They‚Äôre considering moving tbow, scythe, and rapier to higher tiers as they don‚Äôt really fit at 75
---
I.e increasing tbow ranged requirement to 90 or whatever
---
It‚Äôs all good for now. I‚Äôm mainly doing quests for awhile. I think 3 slots will be fine for if I need quest items.
---
I bet they could fix it if the world was going to explode if they didn‚Äôt

That‚Äôs it I want a OSRS chess set

go do quest grind for barrows gloves and so on 
---
I don‚Äôt even disagree with the lad above us, this shouldn‚Äôt have been put into the game. I‚Äôll probably log in and do it since I collected all that seaweed waiting in excitement. But after that runs out I‚Äôll be at charters.
---
My hair grows really quick 
---
&gt;Don't forget that mods aren't at work, they're just playing a game like you lol
---
That's where I gotta disagree with you man. If you're just playing a game like me, then stop being a player moderator. You're a MODERATOR. Why else would you have that status? I don't expect every player mod to hang around the G.E for hours to mute bots, but I do expect something more than "Yeah well it happens and I'm just trying to play the game". Every time I am at the G.E I report and mute (for myself) every bot that I see. That takes like 0 effort, why can't Pmods do the same then? Every little bit helps.
---
S A V A G E
---
Fishing in raids is dead content and would be after this too. 
---
I thought the playerbase was always against this? Those items are pretty op anyway, especially tbow.
---
Stop trying to be rsmoments lmfao
---
This is awesome but I can't kill him so I hate it.
---
&gt;elitist
---
Nah, it's just about following basic logic. Even my girlfriend I introduced to the game within the past few months and can't even wear black d'hide chaps understood the question because she understands basic logic. 
---
"Blessed d'hide chaps are having their defense level removed in the poll? Why would blessed chaps have their defense removed but not regular black d'hide chaps? That makes no sense. Unless regular black d'hide chaps don't already have a defense requirement? I better do a google search really quick, or skip the question altogether since I'm not certain and don't have the time to look things up."
---
Even if I agreed with you and admitted Jagex fucked up here, neither of us can change what Jagex does or doesn't do. You know what we can change? Being proactive and informing ourselves about the things we vote for, both IRL and in a silly little game like runescape. I know I was pretty rude to you, but it seriously annoys me to see people blame their ignorance on others. Hopefully from here on out, you take more time to vote on things for the betterment of the community. Not for me.
---
!friendme
---
I don‚Äôt feel quite as strongly as you, but I agree that Zeah has a MAJOR size and layout problem. The Hosidius rework looks fine, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 80%+ of buildings and NPCs on the continent serve no purpose whatsoever.
---
I also hate the fact that I need a stamina potion to get ANYWHERE on land without a teleport. With 75 agility and full graceful, I should be able to at least get from one house to its neighbor without running out of energy. 
---
Toadflax is good if you don't have access to secateurs+ultra compost; they're better than ranarrs and snapdragons if you get 7 or below herbs per patch. Considering the average with secateurs+ultra is 8-9, you should stick with rannarrs or snaps instead
---
Toadflax is kind of the low risk-mid reward kind of herb. If you like it you should swap to avantoes since they're similar but lil better profit and exp
---
"the customer support only works for those who wield social media power" HAHAHAHAHAH
---
Fuck yeah 
---
First thing you should do is train Agility to about 50 and get you some shortcuts unlocked and for quest requirements, then I would just do down the list for of what all you need to complete Lunar Diplomacy for the lunar spell book, doing so will also unlock quite a bit in the way of training resources for various skills and some armor such as helmets like the archer and berserker helmet from completing the Fremmy Trials/isles. 
---
I loved that from pre eoc. Should be added to the game by Jagex, it would definitely help new players knowing what to buy.
---
Sold.

Nice changes
---
I suggest starting with talking to Orlando Smith in the Varrock Museum to get 1k slayer and hunter experience and then go straight into training slayer. Later on that will be a great source of income in the game and it motivates to actually explore the game and see new places :D
---
To be fair a good percentage of the OSRS playerbase aren't as honest as you. Yes it's fucking terrible when innocents get caught up for the transgressions of the guilty, but at the end of the day the only who made this community as bad as it is regarding customer support is the community.
---
No other gaming community has the top 3 Twitch streams being phishing scams. GP is insanely valuable in regards to real world. People who stream their gameplay are targeted for their accounts. People in discord social engineer people's info. And worst of all they leave on Wave 9 of Barbarian Assualt.
---
So you can be upset at Jamflex, but also be upset at your fellow players for being complete dinks.
---
How do you turn off the daily reminders

Omg like babeeeee üíÅ

absolutely adorable how crafting gets a massive buff and gives passive mining xp, and reddit thinks its underpowered lmao
---
They were to my level 3 hcim trying to afk shrimps

Just use ibans for barrows. No need to grind to 75.
---
Picking flax is the one and only thing you will need 
---
Then why won't I just use fury then lol? 
---
You overestimate how much shit people give about a stupid cape
---
7 days of play time in 9 days of ownership is also something I would expect from a bottled account. *shrugs*
---
How much time away from your room did it take for you to notice? My hygiene is a paranoia to me. I always think I smell even though I try not to, because it's not like anybody will ever tell you to your face. 
---
Imagine losing your cash stack to somebody who still unironically says cool beans
---
Thank you for being a reasonable person, fren.
---
Is barrows possible to with my stats? Its 170 quest point away so its still far. 
---
It takes 30 seconds to post a reply on the swampletic thread yet far longer to follow up and reply to the gnome thread. Please stop dissuading jmods from community interaction otherwise there won't be any at all.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt be changing the stats of the items, tbow is way too powerful for tier 75 already
---
The community was against adding t90 weapons to avoid power creep. but then we got one anyway in the form of tbow, so if we have to have it, it‚Äôs better for it to require the level its stats imply rather than just keeping it lvl 75 to say ‚Äúno t90 weps here folks‚Äù
---
Thanks :D
---
Looks like it's straight out of RS3
---
Since mod wolf said this [https://imgur.com/h9rAphK](https://imgur.com/h9rAphK) I figured I would go ahead and calculate the rates and see if this really will be better than the existing method (using Oziris's numbers as a baseline like you did)  
---
5.2k buckets of sand in 1 hour at 99 with 3 tick (+75k mining xp per hour accounting for the time to put sand into the machine with this method  [https://twitter.com/vattirs/status/1106175123105726464](https://twitter.com/vattirs/status/1106175123105726464) )  
---
Time to farm 867 giant seaweed: 13 minutes (with 0 time spores and oziris farming rate)  
---
Time to turn 5.2k buckets of sand into glass: 31.2 minutes (+ 52k crafting xp)  
---
Time to blow: 208 minutes (+582,400 crafting xp)  
---
Time to get 260k gp for buckets: 8 minutes (vorkath)  
---
Overall time: 320.2 minutes / 5.33 hours  
---
Overall XP: 634.4 crafting xp + 75k mining xp  
---
Overall XP/H: 119 crafting xp/hour + 14k mining xp/hour  
---
So for crafting xp alone, this method is 25% better than the current crafting ehp rate of 95k/h (which requires completely stocked worlds). When you scale up the xp/hour to account for the 0.11 mining ehp you are also getting, the method is 35% better than the existing ehp method (nearly exactly what I predicted).
---
Crystal Hammer: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/azxhqy/crystal\_hammer\_suggestion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/azxhqy/crystal_hammer_suggestion/)
---
Crystal saw has a moderately easy quest to complete in addition it is free to charge. Secondly, the Saw allows players to max their houses with high 80's in the Construction skill.
---
The hammer on the otherhand will require Song of the Elves to complete, getting a Crystal Tool Seed from Zalcano as well as getting 120 shards and will require more shards to recharge. Also the Smithing skill is far less useful in terms of 1-time uses with the exception for the "other" category within the Smithing guide to make items such as Dragonfire Shield and Godsword Blades for instance, which is the main idea behind introducing the Crystal Hammer as it could semi-balance the level offset that Smithing has over other skills (think the Smithing level of 89 to smith rune dart tips over the level 81 Fletching to add feathers onto them).
---
Didn't even print the attacks smh
---
So am I missing something here? Drew and his machine got 66.9% yes votes but is in the game. Same with noted molten glass 69.8% and is in the game. The passing rate is 75% is it not?
---
Some guy on twitch picked flax for what like 10 or 30 hours. These people are insane. 
---
And I got downvoted for saying they have shitty customer service...
---
He is talking about the barrows gloves, they are a reward from the Recipe for Disaster quest. They are completely unrelated to barrows itself. They only got the name because of how they color matched the barrows equipment
---
Thank you for the attention on my first EVER post üòÉ/
---
So I started doing barrows for the first time last night was averaging 10 minute runs. How can I speed this up and still make a profit? Just hit 75 mage on my last run, using slayer staff and magic dart, full proselyte, occult, mages book, infinity boots. I have a b ring (i), whip, and dragon defender for tunnels, and blowpipe, archers ring (i), anguish, and dhide boots for ahrim. I noticed I splash a lot with magic dart, even though my attack bonus is +9. I know I could use trident, but I don't have mory hard done so I don't know that I would actually profit. Any suggestions? 
---
To prove Gielinor is spherical, unlike the heretics that think it's flat.
---
Bot and get banned lmao
---
The answer is no. They are supported by player moderators and are allowed to have free rain over unsuspecting or naive people making millions of coins a day, oh and probably to be sold for real actual dollars.
---
sounds like he expected to get banned and did so so to show how unreliable there 100% correct bans can be
---
Couldn't they just nerf all the shit when it's clearly op though? But keep it relevant.
---
The argument of it being too big for what it has to offer is irrelevant and the communities fault. Updates such as the inferno were meant to be there but the community asked for it to be moved. If you want to argue theres nothing to do in the elf lands aside from zulrah. Yes they are realizing priffandis just like they will release more into zeah just give it time. Also atlas they've done more with that then they have with the elf lands since their release
---
Yeah im interested in slayer as well. Its different from other skills. I still have to figure out how slayer points works tho. 
---
I always forget that the collection log is mad new. The other day someone posted 4.6k or something medium's done with very little. Everyone initially was like "wtf, not worth" until he clarified only the last 600 or so were done post collection log.
---
I see where they're coming from, but -n my opinion- Player Moderators shouldn't publicly say this. They're essentially discouraging other players from reporting rule-breakers, because they think it doesn't work. 
---
While yes, it seems ineffective bause these spambots will just switch accounts when muted (and use scripts to detect and avoid Pmods). However, not reporting these bots will only make matters worse. Not only won't Jagex be able to permanently mute/ban these accounts, they're also unable to create statistics. Statistics they could use to set their priorities for example. If it becomes a high priority with a lot of reports, there is a higher chance Jagex will spend time and effort into measures to auto-detect and mute those accounts. 
---
The best reason to report them of course is because they get automatically placed on your ignorelist, while also getting the satisfying feeling that you've contributed a little to solving the problem.
---
We all find these spambots annoying, but in all honesty I do have to say that I experienced far less in recent months. There were actually times that I logged in to F2P worlds at the GE (which I do every day) where I didn't had to report spammers upon logging in. Previously I had to mute at least 5 accounts that often spammed for up to 24 or even 48 hours. So Jagex is definitely working on it. 
---
Anyway, I'm going to tag /u/Mod_SteveW. Hopefully he or another JMod can comment on this dicing bot plague.
---
The early designs of Zeah were awful. If you think the current design is bad, you likely havent experienced Zeah on release. 
---
After /u/Mod_West redesigned Zeah it massively improved. He is still working on it and the Hosidius redesign is coming soon‚Ñ¢.
---
Then go NH, record it, and post it here.
---
I'll NH you and I'm not even that good. 
---
Flax is always a safe bet
---
Damn, slipping though the cracks my dude. Gz on the gp.
---
Yes it is. It is cheap. Just because you are not willing to invest the time, it doesn't mean it isn't. 
---
Not everyone likes PvM to the point where you want to invest 2b+ into it. I see you are a low tier PvMer tho, so this explains a couple of things.
---
Flipping was a thing but never on that scale.
---
No one could have so quickly sold so many boots without GE. Not a single person could have done that without it. That ruse was successful only because of GE. 
---
You need to learn to see the bigger picture. Not anyone that disagrees with you has no ability to think critically. Idk who taught you that but you are one of the people that probably votes yes on PvM polls while voting no on PVP ones. Makes sense
---
If I get a good spec I save the next spec for kill #2.

---
This armor would most certainly not kill the difficulty.
---
also rip aussies but still getting one 
---
Have you had a conversation about it? 
---
At LEAST a year, likely longer if they‚Äôre building their own engine. A lot of it depends on the team itself though and what methodology they use.
---
I think most people don‚Äôt really understand software development. 99% of products have ‚Äúspaghetti code.‚Äù Requirements get changed mid-development. Old features getting deprecated and new ones getting introduced may not fit with the spirit of the architecture. Tight deadlines and budgets favoring something that ‚Äújust works‚Äù cause design shortcuts.
---
The companies that overcome these realities are the ones with MASSIVE resources and access to the world‚Äôs best talent (like Google). Jagex is NOT that big and people vastly overestimate their size far too often.
---
Effectively? Never. They will always be extremely slow compared to other methods. Just get your fishing level as high as possible or enjoy the grind

I'd recommend, if you dont want to spend $ on membership that is, to grind out a bond generating method asap. There are plenty of quick money makers you can grind out to farm a bond in a couple of days to set you up nicely for when making gp for bonds because trivial via slayer/bosses later in your account progression. But until 70+ slayer you wont be making much, and if playing semi casual it wont be enough for a bond.
---
Skills like RC to 44 for nats, hunter to 63 for red chins, coal bag for steel bars at blast furnace (60 smith recommended but not required) etc are all pretty easy to unlock quickly that can easily earn you a bond in like 6-9 hours of gameplay, which over a 14 day period isnt too much time invested.
---
After awhile youll make enough gp passively just by playing mid-late game to not have to worry about membership but it will be hard early on :p
---
Feel like it would bring the community together. Something besides raids or a mini game you and your friends could build together.
---
If you have the Morytania Hard Diary done majority of the money you make will be from runes.
---
I highly suggest getting that done if you want to make a lot of money off of Barrows.
---
&gt; Crystal armour in its current state with that much range defence and no magic or range penalty will make inferno significantly easier
---
It won't. 
---
Anyone that thinks that clearly hasn't done the Inferno and is only looking at numbers and thinking "Woah, big!"
---
It's a far off continent so a different visual style should be expected. And it's really easy to get around the continent if you've unlocked the teleports/minecarts etc. I think it's great.

I was very disappointed when they said it wasn‚Äôt coming, my friends and I were gonna do it
---
Look up had on thingiverse you will find this exact stl.
---
Probably a better idea to work out which part is taking the longest (e.g. 1 of the brothers? The Crypt? Getting KC? Getting back?).
---
Switching to Fire Wave (With Tome of Fire and Smoke Battlestaff) or Trident (either normal or Swamp) is probably your next best bet, as the max hits will make the biggest change (At 75 Magic, 17 for Magic Dart, 36 for Fire Wave, 25~ for Trident of the Swamp).
---
If you have ibans blast I would use that, otherwise your gear looks solid 
---
Ayiza would have liked this.
---
I got to say, I love this. Mother lode mining, blast mining, or Iron ore in the guild was too new school, and this update kinda brings the old days of old school mining back. Mine, next ore, deposit, repeat - everything without AFK. So far - really not that bad.
---
Don‚Äôt let people finding one game more enjoyable bother you if you enjoy rs3 then go have fun with it. Don‚Äôt let others keep you down. But a meme poll in a washroom shouldn‚Äôt tell you what to do
---
Just login to the game and look at the poll booths.
---
They can do something like dead man mode but cannot do this?
---
This guys doesn't deserve pmod status, and it seems like he realizes that. Ban him
---
What the fuck do you mean hold back other aspects of the game? You are saying that the ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù between dhide top and legs is holding your gaming experience back? 
---
Or are you just trying to spite pures for the hell of it? 
---
I play the game. Of course you mute the ones you see but nobody can just go world hopping for hours. Plus the newer scripts add all known mods to a list and instantly stop or hop when one comes into a radius. If you get one you go on the list and it‚Äôs harder to get more. It‚Äôs fighting a losing battle. The best way to make the gambling bots and spammers stop are to get people to stop using them and if they lose profits they‚Äôll move on. They‚Äôre scripts will bot the process all the way from account creation to spamming at the Ge again. It‚Äôs hopeless.
---
If you have ornate pool I‚Äôd just spec both and do 1 kill trips 
---
2 skeletons and a bloodworm
---
So just Slayer, then? Once you acquire barrows armor and a whip at level 70 you'd be set for combat gear for the rest of your playthrough, which would be near exclusively Slayer. The only bosses are KBD, KQ, and the Chaos Ele, all three easily soloable with even mid-level gear. 
---
It goes back to the point you raised earlier: what is the end game in an actual 2007 version?
---
How likely is it that there'll be support for different-coloured unique **object markers and npc indicators?** Would this be relatively straight-forward now that we have tile-unique ground marker colours?
---
Asking for player mod LMFAO.

Is obsidian armor and obsidian sword better xp/hr at amonite crabs than full rune and a d scim? Or do I need the berserker necklace as well?

How about you feel my wrath rune down your chin
---
It‚Äôs because they way RL does it, it doesn‚Äôt actually change the engine. It just adds an overlay to the client, similar to any interface they add such as boss timers and what nit. If you were to do this engine-sided there‚Äôd be a LOT more work.

Yes on death in wildy you're going to lose the activation ether and charge ether. Honestly craws vs viggoras comes down to what you're doing. If you're looking to safest and cannon tasks use craws, also craws on chaos ele and venenatis. Viggoras for vetion and callisto 
---
Does changing tabs still interrupt actions such as cooking or fletching?
---
It's a 3 second action to mute a spam bot for everyone, they applied for the position to be helpful for the game they love. It's not really holding him to any height of standards to expect them to do the most minor things.  If he can't bare to do the minimum then he shouldn't be a pmod.
---
Granted, there might be more to this conversation with the dude bugging the pmod we might not be seeing, but as of now it looks poorly on the mod. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty obvious you know nothing about me from online text. 
---
That‚Äôs about the only thing thats obvious here. Oh that and your projections of ‚Äúangst‚Äù and ‚Äúcringe‚Äù. You‚Äôre the one that brought it up not me, you wanna talk about it bro? You don‚Äôt gotta project like that homie I got you. 
---
No. Building from a midway point is basically how current osrs came into existence.
---
vs john doeesssss

If they're poverty ironmemes they shouldn't be going for 99 crafting anyway. 50-85 which is a reasonable mid level goal is like 2.1m + the cost of buckets. That's not a whole lot at that point in the game. By the time you unlock zenytes the additional 2.5m isn't going to hurt the bank either. You can easily make that back in the 10+ hours saved at minimum from not collecting sand from Yanille, even as an ironman. Go burst nechs for a few hours and you'll get that back and a load of magic and HP XP.

And the amount of cool content YouTube‚Äôs and streamers could do would be pretty cool.
---
Thanks! Just tried air battlestaves and the work perfectly!
---
It still slow as absolute fuck though. It's only *barely* faster than the charter ship method, and that's with 99 mining.

Only people that have to step in the wild for d pick are irons.

Bad idea, Runecraft xp p/h is something that is basically fixed and shouldn‚Äôt be moved as it‚Äôs always been ‚Äúthat skill‚Äù that takes forever.

You‚Äôre absolutely right. They can‚Äôt say no unless you ask

Hello C engineer alt

Wholesome post. Your bringing back some good memories sunny boy. I remember the first time I got members. Most important thing to remember, don‚Äôt get overwhelmed and enjoy the game. Enjoy all that new content! Cheers!

Just add a loading message when a tab is loading. It won't look like lag and gives the user input about what's actually going on.

Thing was i might've made it an ironmeme and idk if i'm ready for that kind of autism in my life
---
good tip
---
I feel that, that thought definitely came up while thinking about this. People that have the RC cape that spent how many hours would be pissed that it became way easier later on I guess
---
Endgame would be maxing of course, obtain all barrows sets, you can PK at Max level or make a pure, everything you can do in OSRS today with the thought in mind that we do not want updates. I don't think I would ever get sick of it.
---
I can understand that you feel that this isn't enough content and I say, fair enough. However I can't see the harm of dedicating 1 or 2 servers on the world hoper towards this. 
---
Practice and decent gear. Memorize the rotations and know that he may start a different rotation once he finishes the first one. took me about 7-8 tries to do it for the diary (103 combat). 
---
Honestly I can't see any practical reason that a small list of text with 3 different colors at most takes any time other than mere milliseconds to load other than the possibility that the client has to query a server for the information every time the panel is opened. Wouldn't it benefit mobile players more if the information was cached on first access per login?
---
Seriously..if it was me the only time it'd be on me is if I'm doing something melee based...when I'm not using void I'm in graceful anyways...

nah I got a 2 day ban for botting agility on a fresh account from 1 to 65 in 2 days.
---
Wow that‚Äôs an awesome update. As a new player runelite has made osrs so much easier to play and a lot easier to understand item values. 
---
On another note, can somebody tell me why Jagex hasn‚Äôt implemented a way to change the price of an item you‚Äôre trying to buy/sell by simply altering the price then pressing a confirm button instead of having to cancel the whole transaction then either search for the item again or put the item back up for sell with a different price? 
---
I'd make her an athlete but I wouldn't want to start a row.

Chinning is faster than barraging/bursting iirc but costs a ton more.
---
With a number like that, he likely hit all-but-one gearing for whatever he's out there for, theres no cash to rebuild. I did the same thing once so I'm pretty confident it wasn't intentional and he'll be quitting for awhile
---
PMod can instant 48 hour mute. Thats longer than the lifespan of these bots.
---
Okay that's a plan I imagine, I will try those. Thanks for the tip
---
Oof. Java~~script~~
---
Took me 15-20 tries before I got a kill. Just keep using a visual aid of the rotations if you need to.
---
I did that until 300+ kc before I felt I really had it memorized. 
---
Mmmm fuck, tell me more.
---
I will surely try that

runelite is better in basically every way possible

Probably impossible. They would end up different than the game we have now. Like ticks could end up .5seconds or unforseen problems will occur they wont know how to fix.

Within 5 minutes you can have a fresh account sitting at G.E.

The goal is to set up so you have to rely on each other. I‚Äôd be willing to take that risk to be able to play the game more with my friends.

Become a top twitch streamer, hang out in Mod Mark's cc 24/7, push for authenticator delay.

They said there would be a delay before it was added

Level 3 irons with combat quests done? Can you explain, pretty sure overload expired upon leaving so I'm not seeing how this works
---
Tbh it sounds like the rat is still on your computer. You said you reformatted your drive and reinstalled windows, however unfortunately the rat can for example infect the recovery parts of the drive and still survive. Firstly if you haven't already done so, I would try reformatting the recovery partition as well. Failing that, to be 100% sure I would take it to a computer technician because depending on the sophistication of the rat it may have even infected multiple hardware components which would, to be removed, involve flashing the MBR/BIOS/BIOS of the GPU/etc. to erase any stored information where it could potentially be hiding (hopefully not). 
---
Gotta complete fremmenik trials in order to start isles so what ever the requirements are for both quests.

BGS a good enough replacement for DWH or no? 
---
Im slowly getting closer and closer to Raids reqs, but have a fair bit of gear left to get.
---
I'm not going to defend this guy (or any Pmod for that matter) but a huge amount of these bots will insta logoff or stop spamming as soon as a Pmod/Jmod logs in near them. 
---
They must have a list of player names and use some fancy plugin/bot to do it, kinda similar to those scouting bots in the wild.
---
Then again, if he said he sees it and still does nothing, then yeah, fuck that guy.
---
This is kind of hard to picture. Do you have a link to this method?
---
christ that sounds nasty
---
Let the circle jerk commence!
---
Do you have more? üòÑ

well honestly, what is the point of botting if you monitor it? might aswelll AFK the skills yourself then, same amount of effort honestly.

Regardless of whether someone is an ironman or not, a meta should never involve hopping worlds. Also, where did I say I was an ironman, kiddo?
---
The possibilities are either that you died and lost your stuff/weren't aware, or someone else was on it. One way people die without knowing is that closing the app is not the same as logging off. So if you close the app in range of something that might attack you, your character is still logged in and can be killed. That or yeah you got hacked. You should add authenticator to your account and a bank pin to improve account security. Also should add authenticator to your registered email to help protect that  
---
My melee stats made all of this impossible unless i got a DWH which is far more $$$ than I had. And blowpipe alone wasn‚Äôt enough accuracy at my range level :/ 
---
As long as Jagex was fine with the plugin and still is, I see no reason why it should be removed.
---
 I don't want to see a chilling effect where people actively *don't* want things to be polled because that will preclude the possibility of it being added by 3rd party clients or forcing 3rd party clients to remove features.

If you do everything to secure your account, you literally have nothing to worry about. Please stop being convinced by other people that your account isn't secure. If you're not downloading fake/bot clients, have account security and are frankly not an idiot, you're 99.9% in good hands.
---
The thing people genuinely fail to realise is that with posts claiming "oh no, I had 2fa, how on earth did I get hacked?!??" Is that a self-post on Reddit does not paint the full picture. Someone being hacked by 2fa does not discredit 2fa as a valuable security measure. 
---
For example, if a house is robbed and they have locked doors, but the burglar broke in through the window, it doesn't mean doors are no longer a viable security measure. It means lock your fucking windows. Conversely, if someone is hacked with 2fa in place, they may have also downloaded some dumb shit, or entered their details onto a phishing site, or had their email compromised. There are literally a plethora of reasons.
---
My point is this: there are 200,000+ players online each day, there are bound to be idiots among them who like to skip corners. Don't fall into the trap of being swayed by a couple of posts emerging on reddit which fail to paint the whole picture.
---
Calm down lol don‚Äôt rush a masterpiece

Yeah the new ironman meta for seaweed gathering is to farm seaweed spores into giant seaweed on fossil island. It gives you really a fuckload lol.

I thought I knew all the skills and that construction and farming were my least favorite.....until I started training thieving for Desert Treasure... holy f*** that skill is hell to train (for me).
---
Also, I have this irrational fear of Desert Treasure being a mammoth of a quest that, by the end, I'll hate myself. Is that accurate or am I crazy?
---
a lot of things runelite does involves just displaying data that is sent between the server and client, the overlays are like you say injecton, jagex could develop their own client to do these things without touching their game code in the same way, its not hard, and they could spin it off as a extra membership feature like a jagex gold membership where you pay an extra $1-2 a month for the extra client features but they rather let osbuddy have their own way and propose a deal with them to earn a fraction of what they could be potentially making. god bless runelite
---
Yeah the game isnt really easy for new players, clients like thesse help new players imensly. The wiki button or farm timres, price lookup. alot of stuff that 3rd party clients offer seem essential 
---
Recruit wingsofredemption
---
There isn't TOO much you guys could do. While OSRS is an MMORPG it's definitely pretty solo-play oriented. 
---
If you guys all had nice account and could Chambers of Xeric that'd be perfect. But if you're starting fresh ehhh
---
Pretty sure their mutes are just weaker these days. Nothing to do with rose tinted glasses for the past. Their mutes used to be a two day, then Jagex would verify/lengthen the mute under their discretion. I was told p mod mutes only last a few hours now, although it could be more or even less

If you really just want to grind out Wildy Slayer, you could use the Chainmace/Craws Bow on nearly every task. But as someone who isn't made of money and does it for profit, slow as it may be, and not just points I only use it on some tasks. According to my notes, I'd always use at Callisto and Vet'ion and generally use it at Black Demons. I'd use the Mace or Bow at Spiritual Creatures or Chaos Druids; though recently I have been using Whip at Spirituals instead to make more $. You could also use the mace at Greater Demons, Fire Giants, Magic Axes, or Ankous but I generally stick to Whip.
---
For the Bow, I'd use that at Chaos Elemental (Chainmace also works), Venenatis, and Chaos Fanatic. I use the Bow or Blowpipe for Aviansies and Ents and I use the Bow or DHCB, usually DHCB, for Black and Green Dragons. Overall the Bow is the stronger weapon and you could use it for a lot of the above tasks I listed as Mace too, but it depends on what you want out of Wilderness Slayer. If you want to grind Wildy Bosses, I'd actually say Chainmace since it works on more bosses (it is terrible at Ven), but if you really want to grind Wildy Bosses you'd want both so you can do Ven too. If you're just going for quick points, honestly both work fine but if you did have the $ for a Bow it may be a bit better; especially since you don't need to worry about defenders (I lost like 6 ddef to Callisto, not PKers, just the bear...).
---
As for what is the safer investment, no clue. Holy crap, Craw's dropped a ton since I got mine... Chainmace too... Well, I'd say Craw's still has more room to drop since the Chainmace can't get much lower... As for the Charges, you put in 1K Ether to make the weapons glow, then you put in additional ether so they can attack. The Chainmace can attack with just the glow and no additional ether, but it spams your chatbox saying it is out of ether and it won't get its wildy bonuses then; Craw's needs arrows if you don't use the Ether. If you die with the weapons, you lose all the Ether, so the 1K plus any you were using for attacks. I generally put in the 1K plus like 200~ for Wildy Bosses but for other tasks where you don't bank as often, you'd want more. And I've probably lost well over 10K Ether to PKers...
---
Damn no pet. Feels bad that thing is beautiful

Literally  unplayable.
---
Group iron is supposed to come out eventually (read: 2020-2022). Best you could do is unofficial group iron, but would be hard to prove no one is cheating.

???????????????

this game would be dead without 3rd party clients you retard

lumberjack literally takes 5-10minutes to get lol.

Just gonna sneak in the noted molten glass there? Thank you guys so much

Truth. Very nice post!

nope was asking for some clannie that just got cleaned lol

Make r/2007scape Settled and make that little guy in the corner us.
---
What do you want to play togheter?Mining and woodcutting you will compete against eachothe.
---
Other skills you can't help eachother but won't be activley fighting for reaources
---
Some bosses can be done as a team
---
You mean transparent?
---
Unmod him if he doesnt do anything with it. whats the point?
---
Mod might have had the days different due to time zones. 
---
Also, I don't think they would come out and completely bullshit you about something this easy to follow. 
---
Post your GE history on here and we will know  
---
jews lol
---
don't worry, you will never have this problem
---
cant be that rare if you got it 
---
Just from before the log update.
---
Surprised you can read at all tbh
---
To the top
---
How about adding some logic to your comments? :)
---
fairy rings are good, but they're not as good as you would think. Also you don't need the requirements for fairytale 2 to use them since you don't need to complete the entire quest
---
Lol pls 2147m offer, you guys have no chance 
---
I, for one, still use the original client. And although I don't actually care if anyone uses 3rd party clients, I dont think the game would be dead if we never had them. The problem now is that we DO have them and now people are spoiled by them, removing them would cause a huge chunk of players to quit that probably never would have quit if they never touched one.
---
This cant be real....
---
I just saved up
---
Yeah that is unfortunate. that would make it better
---
Did you vault over a poll booth?
---
How would they execute this? Add right-click option 'dig here' to every right-click thats not on interface?
---
Says the guy that thinks ANYTHING in runescape uses javascript.
---
Well, sorry man. Just had an idea but I knew that reddit hates opinions and ideas. I ain't going to bitch about it and I'll leave my comment up.
---
Take your own advice??
---
For april fools Jagex should post an update that says it is now possible to telegrab the ruby ring in the varrock west bank and see how many people fall for it.
---
I think it's awful but so are 90% of the cosmetic items in the game so it's pretty fitting.
---
These someone told me to post this posts are completely suspect. Who? Who told you to post? What's their u/? 
---
Oh, neato. But irrelevant now as i did check and saw i was a normieman
---
They could add stuff like that to their official client though, but they're just leaning on the unofficial clients while giving half answers as to if they're okay or not or if even specific features are okay or not. 
---
----
---
And as to that last point, the menu reordering thing on runelite seems to change fundamental things about the game. Left click on NPC being changed to pickpocket makes it so much less click intensive. 
---
Because of no timestamps my only scepticism is that your history might not go back far enough to see you sell the bond, as the Mod says you have. Idk dude sorry to hear about your loss if the op is legit, otherwise lmao GG no re
---
Aha, thank you for that one
---
people mainly use them on task for pet hunting or point farming. But the primary use is just for killing revs for more weapon drops
---
I'm the dumb one, but you think trolling deserves a ban lol? 
---
I think it's also that the engine is proprietary and outdated.
---
So the job posting is basically:
---
"Come learn monstrous ancient code that is non-transferable to any other job you'll have in the future, and get paid shit for doing it." 
---
Also, you can not use runelite, literally nobody is forcing you. 
---
Do that then
---
I'm surprised I even had any accidents, those things can be seen for miles 
---
Just git gud 4Head
---
It means that you will gain a bunch of magic xp passively over time, doing things such as high alching during agility. This would be especially true for ironmen, as you would have to cast a lot more spells from the Lunars spellbook to train different skills.
---
They explained this. You'd have to wait for the game to cancel the offer and resubmit it at the new price every time you go to change it because that's how the G.E. works so it's more.effort than it's.worth to implement. 
---
I did basically the same thing 10 years ago.

Author here, the link posted in this thread is a link to an old version of the guide from September.

---
Shit, well first of all sorry. It just seemed suspicious to me. Second, I added an edit to my og comment saying it was false and an idea. I won't delete it either. I don't want to cause any more issues so I'll stop bugging you as well.
---
can we please get on screen jewelry charges? People have been requesting it since like March last year and I've been putting off RC because of it lol. Great work bro.
---
Yeah it's really unfortunate. It's possible for them to look further back to see GE history. But instead of proofing it . They just closed the convo.. if they send me proof I have peace with it ;)
---
you too
---
nah, fake players like you would quit and a proper community would be built
---
less money for jagex tho
---
Yeah its kinda like would we rather Jagex spend all their man hours doing the exact same thing that the client that everyone is using already does or would we rather them spend the time working on content for the game
---
Isn‚Äôt this a task only boss? How did ya get so many points?
---
What's the probability that on the 15th minute of the 11th hour of any random given day that I receive a swordfish drop.

Like for real, this game is statistics. Every drop has a weighting, some weighted more than others. In full disclosure, it's kind of a demoralising thought but oh well, if people are having fun then I guess it doesn't really matter.

The quest itself isn't bad, but fuck the lockpicking section. Blew through almost 300 lockpicks on that part.

No, it wasn't rhetorical, thanks for your answer.

I get that pmods also play the game so they don't always want to bother with this.

However if it is that simple, I would've expected them to do this..

Another noob story, I sold 12 mith longs to the sword shop in Varrock and thought I money stolen because I didn‚Äôt realize the value drops the more you sell. Scammed.

I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre so expensive when snaps is dirt cheap. Cause they‚Äôre new?
---
This would have wasted so many afternoons of my time as a kid. 
---
Is there any official info on the situation and result of mod jeds involvement?

Just what I was looking for.
---
Have a chatroom for youtube and split the rest into 4-player chatrooms. Make time based competitions for quests and unlocks between the groups and shuffle up who is in every group daily.

Got scammed so many times looking for that key :(

---
This make me chuckle. It is so typical of some of these people. I genuinely feel bad for ironman players who DON'T act this way, because they get blanketed with judgement from us normies. 
---
Just put on your Ganodermic armor. You will be good.
---
I think Barrows would be the best money making strategy for OP. Sad to say, but PvMing blows most Skilling skills out of the water.
---
That's only if they have a "talk to" option. Where is this runelite feature anyway? I checked in menu entry swapper and all I can find about thieving is the "pickpocket on HAM" option.
---
Fake
---
All four are bots. 
---
This seems to contradict what the other comment said. Mystics you can stack void and salve, but the other comment said that void is "extremely bad against mystics"
---
Many...I honestly confused the crap out of my teachers with these, also have drawings on me in adamant gold armor üòÖ
---
Yes, I can confirm.
---
that was kinda the joke
---
r/wooosh 
---
So just follow each other and do the quests together? Whenever someone walks off on their own it makes it difficult for us to find each other. Are friends and clan mates marked on the world map at all?
---
You really came away with some gold from that one. 
---
Mods please ban this guy lmao
---
Are these marshmallows?
---
Integrity fix tbh.
---
Yeah not gonna lie, I have no idea who you are in the conversation but I agree with the ironman. Having shit restricted to the wildy is going to inevitably have outcomes like these. Besides, they'll never implement the removal of ironman for shit like that, if it's breaking game rules they'll just ban you instead.
---
Honestly you should go for ~58 agi. That's the point where you would collect enough marks of grace to unlock the full graceful armor set which will make everything else you ever do 10x better. 
---
Unlimited access to all the wilderness stuff? 
---
[I sure would exchange one more dollar for that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HOt0ZOcYk)
---
I make my living off of selling works of fan art for various movies so I can say that it can usually be a coin toss on whether or not a company will pursue you for IP issues, because even if a company doesn't have a legal leg to stand on it doesn't mean they won't try, as your average individual probably can't pay to go through a lawsuit.
---
I was told by the head of the legal department at Warner Brothers that it was legal for us to sell works of fan art of their movies and intellectual property as long as we were the copyright holders of the fan art we used and that we made no attempt to claim it was endorsed by Warner Brothers themselves, and we've never had a problem with them or most other movie studios, but some will go ahead and send cease and desists regardless.

Recently got into this game again after 5 years of not playing. Glad to see Runescape players are just as oddly entitled as before.

Odds of this happening are 99.99 (With 55 more 9's after this 9).

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's because log was added after his KC. 
---
Damn beat me to it! Either way we need this. 
---
Iron man most toxic part of community confirmed. 
---
Ill go ahead and second that.
---
Please Sir can we have some more?
---
It's not, so is there any way to get in contact with Jagex and do any mods look this reddit?

His loot was trash...but his words..priceless

Wow an actual cool idea instead of an ugly shitty ass cosmetic piece

Been checking all day! :(

literally no one says that

I'd go with Craws solely because of the range, which makes it easier to attack following a teleport. The Chainmace probably isn't too far behind on DPS, but having to run closer should slow it down a bit. Also, if you planned to flinch, you'd want the Chainmace. But both should be more effective than full Verac, but probably also more risk since you'll always lose the Ether and Chaos Ele area isn't the easiest escape.
---
You don't need a guide...end of discussion
---
there are some places where low accuracy but higher max hit &gt; high accuracy low max hit.
---
&gt;I did that for a while but recently bought the ancestral top/hat.. not sure if its worth the money?
---
what is worth the money? ances? depends on your other upgrades. 
---
&gt;Also how does this change in solos vs group raids
---
never ever void in solos. in solos you will always be tanking the vang/rope/muta.
---
Still got my untrimmed hp cape
---

---
Not out fuck you and your premature ejaculation 
---
Acorn is a cute grill
---
Nah, after questing to 37 you barb fish til 70.
---
It's not a bug:)
---
&gt; Chaos Elemental (Chainmace also works)
---
Works real well with the safespot near the resource area. 
---
&gt;Chaos Druids
---
I'd just use something that doesn't have charges as you are more likely to get pked here. 
---
I'm not too sure all I know is that I profited around 3.1b.  The only money I spent was on amethyst arrows, prayer pots, and sharks.
---
Perhaps you could try faxing @them?
---
inb4 classic Jagex excuse that accounts just get quickly replace.  For fucks sake try something you lazy assholes.
---
Yeah that give so much combat exp. 
---
That's what I was thinking, being told I've got 5.5 trillion gambian dollars in an offshore bank account is a little generic but evidently they know I'm a 'Scaper somehow!
---
LOL same I was super excited for mobile to come out then I actually played it and without runelite it was alot less enjoyable, pretty much never touch it on mobile now
---
You mean to tell me you think you got hacked and the only thing they took was an untrimmed HP cape??
---
thats the jagex mo release content then wait 2 years to change that content
---
Are you wearing it by any chance?
---
if you submitted a ticket for billing support then you just wait.
---
Should've put a picture of Armadyl's Crossbow next to it
---
Are you wearing it? 
---
Cool cool. Didn't mean to intrude I've just seen a lot of people fall apart because of no communicating. Good on y'all :). 
---
Nope 
---
Why is this clue vastly easier than the others 
---
Bro literally do Waterfall quest wtf else do you want to save time 
---
If you are a non iron and need a rune pouch I can sell you one.
---
Thurbjorn
---
Orasha
---
Wrong cape bro..
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I was wearing mine when the update happened? Not sure why it‚Äôs gone, sucks though :/
---
Delete this 
---
It's good to know you can read minds from your keyboard at home . Can I hire you for some more bulshit comments ? 
---
Feed me with more juicy stories
---
You can only afk splash for 10m now without cheating and using an autoclicker, which is a permaban offense.
---
Not sure if I was wearing it when I logged off, but I have nothing on my character at the moment 
---
&gt;the wiki is throwing me off. Its saying you can't get in there AT ALL, only view it.
---
No it doesn't say that at all. I don't know what you're talking about.
---
It astounds me how people just beat on Jagex regardless of the changes they make. Can't even believe Ash wastes his time responding to those people on Twitter.
---
Have you heard anything from Jagex? I also ruined mine because of this shit-glitch.... :( 
---
Fuck
---
They should have a Jagex podcast where we listen to God Ash talk about how he copes with all the bullshit he deals with on twitter.
---
Ah-hyuck, I‚Äôll help you find the next one!
---
No, no I did not. Makes more sense now.
---
Why not just play on a p2p world?
---
Meet Swaumpletics my Mauritania locked UIM
---
Inferno is the only content that gets significantly harder without a blow pipe. Everything else is still just as easy, but a bit slower.
---
Nothing else is 'balanced' around BP. BP shreds things and other weapons are fine, but not worth using in comparison. 
---
Not sure why 'mobile only' accounts are a thing, just seems like a PITA
---
As an absolutely new iron man, can you elaborate that first point on the herblore xp? Thanks!
---
Forgot name sounds like a real nice guy
---
Lmao are you serious.
---
Share I tied.

dang yeah, I feel. In all honesty my RNG is great but I'm tryna rebuild by GETTING the claw, makes sense I would fill the rest of the collection log first haha.

Too be fair c engineer just went like 160 dry on his ironman. Its possible

Projection is pretty pointless here when it's obvious. Just relax and move on

Wait... I just noticed the **plate_body** comment, but I initially thought you were referring to:
---
*Rune platebody in the colours of Ancient*
---
Ah yes, my favorite god,
---
#Mr. Ancient
---
&gt;implementing pvp restricted content with such high rewards.
---
I wouldn't call any of it restricted and you aren't forced to do any of it.  
---
DW bro, fire cape is HIGHLY overrated and actually pretty garbage in a lot of ways, stick to your skill/obby cape. 
---
Please make Ancient say Zaros too ;-;
---
I agree with the cameras! And in general, the cast just started to feel more and more like celebrities, which I feel really detracted from the ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù stylings of the ‚Äúmock‚Äù- umentary‚Äùformat they had going
---
This x1000, I legit think we would see an increase in bots if they didn't have to walk all the way up
---
Don‚Äôt you just love the community :) 
---
I feel like alchmate is almost always off their GE estimates tho. Or they suggest items with low trade volume/high cost which isn't necessarily a bad thing but most people are too poor or impatient.
---
r/woosh

You know you can go to the F2P areas in P2P right?

I like his work and think he‚Äôs done a great job keeping the look and feel of Oldschool.

---
Fantastic, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been doing it wrong for so many years 
---
Classic ironman
---
dhide bodies. low buy limit but they're always below alch value.
---
Next add combat levels needed to be assigned too
---
I'm thinkin it must be a jagec leak because the email they contacted me a was a university email that I dont use for anything except school. I only used it for scape because I made an iron Man recently and didn't have any other reliable emails left, but now I got this email? Jagex leak is my only theory
---
You can't put a price on promotion like this
---
Like I said Ironman are the most toxic part of the community.  
---
How does CtC work? Do you have to do something before you can find the pieces?
---
No. Bad suggestion.
---
5000 IQ
---
sure but the majority will mage their slayer-&gt;easily have high magic since you want that for zulrah barrows raids.
---
only pvpers are toxic. insert brainlet meme
---
Yikes how does it feel knowing you have to debate what an essay is to validate sending me entire paragraphs. Trolls don't typically need to write more than a couple sentences, I think you're just bad at it.
---
might not be as much engine work as you think, the ring of visibility does something similar.
---
Same except i found out one year ago. Theyre in the cave south of dorgeshun
---
God I'm glad I don't do things where I'm constantly around people like that in game. 
---
Font too modern fake post 
---
"It has been a very productive day"
---
I wish it was that easy for me to be satisfied with runescape 
---
Could've been a 10 year old that didn't know how the wilderness worked. poor kid i will pray for him.
---
That is true, but it doesn't change any models on entities, only ground objects, it might be possible or a small engine addition.
---
Why don‚Äôt you add a delay on authenticator? Why doesn‚Äôt any jagex mod respond at all?
---
&gt;no you won't. It'll be fun for the first few hours, after that it'll become  a chore and you'll stop doing it.
---
Nah i actually love this game and it holds a special place in my heart. It was a huge part of my childhood and combating negative influences like these gambling scammers will keep it alive longer. I would like to see that. 
---
No I wouldn't do it full time, but in random bursts I would absolutely go out of my way to do my part for the good of the game and the community
---
gratz alch yourself
---
The spacing is on point :D
---
Angry? no.
---
I'm just wondering why someone would come into a random thread about a Pmod not doing Pmod things, and actually spends money to guild the two random people defending the Pmod?
---
Seems bizarre no?
---
The eyes cannot see what the mind does not know. Carry on with your ignorance.
---
You alright? 
---
Honestly this is why I stopped playing most online games, mostly runescape/leauge cant go anywhere without someone assblasting you, downvote me I'd u want but my qol has increased in the last couple months
---
Try meta Yu-Gi-Oh, used to like that game a lot and tried getting back to it in last year only to deal with absolute cancer new mechanics and people taking 20 minute first turns to completely lock you out of doing anything. It's garbage.
---
So I picked up magic, bought a deck but haven't had the time to play irl cause of stupid school
---
Yea, it‚Äôs realy not that bad if you are smart about not doing a lot of the quests OP mentioned and have 1 def the (2-3?) tasks that req def all suck.  The reason I did it was nieve requires 85 cb and my account maxed at 78 cb.  Random fact:  until nieve was released/duradel was reworked, chaelder was the fastest master for 99 slay (about the first year or so of osrs iirc)
---
Maybe move to a real country. 
---
ITT OP doesn't realize F2P areas exist in P2P worlds, and that they are so full of cobwebs from lack of use that OP could literally claim parts of the world for his own and nobody would find out for weeks, maybe months. 
---
Oh no.
---
hmm, fair point, the weekly schedules memes on this sub did indeed help him.  Moving forward now though it's probably best to prioritize quality since he's already got a big audience's attention now.    
---
nice username btw.  bodybuilding &gt; crossfit haha
---
Your best bet is to just unequip everything at log out. As you can see they couldn't get into your bank since you had a pin.  Make sure they didn't try to deactivate it. Scan your comp and change your pass to something unique.  
---
they updated it. it wasn‚Äôt originally included in the patch notes
---
You really need to work on getting that marrige/pole vaulting ratio down buddy. 
---
The fuck does a non-hack/plugin way even mean? Just because it's client side doesn't mean it's inferior in any way.
---
Let him know, but explain why it has happened to help him learn.
---
they sign up for ironman then they complain about the grind
---
If you can't beat em, join em ;P
---
Haha, that's so Jagex.
---
Granted, there are some, like me, who compulsively shower twice a day, wash and exfoliate their face with Epsom salt at least two more times a day, and took acutane, and still manage to get acne in their twenties. I promise I try not to. But my genetics fucked me every which way including upside down. 
---
Is it possible to make a pearl oily fishing rod? I saw it passed the polls and then I can't find any mentions of it anywhere
---
I know, and I'm sure as I do more slayer (only 81 slayer) I'll get there, but there aren't many good mage training methods for irons outside of passive gains. 
---
 It's not a bad change tbh it's just upsetting that if I didn't go 600 dry at demonics I'd already have my anguish and not even care.
---
Not OP but having a hard time choosing what to block. 97cb, 67 slayer currently, doing nieve or konar depending on how I feel. Know of any good guides out there that can help out?
---
This is almost as bad as the Guthix Mitre distance unit.
---
lvl 3s have used this method to complete the feud, this allowed them to sell their blood/soul runes from 99 rc to the ali shop. this is a huge advantage for them now, as rc is prob the best way to get gp on a lvl 3 iron if you have the feud quest done
---
Oh boy this is a good one. 
---
The colours of ancient lmao 
---
I'd buy that
---
They 100% aren't, or at least the vast majority. They often show off the prizes on stream before presumably throwing it in a corner somewhere and never thinking about it again. 
---
"More"
---
Lmao nice.  Yea at that age I hadn‚Äôt tried anything yet.  I was almost 20 before I did. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely an intense experience and could fuck you up pretty easy if you aren‚Äôt prepared for it, but if you do it correctly it‚Äôs really safe in isolated use situations.  I found it to be an enlightening experience in terms of making me see how other people arrived at the places they have to be the people I know.

Super impressive stats for F2P.  Hope you have a wonderful adventure in Members!  First thing I'd suggest is get 30 Agi, and if you're up for it, keep going for full [Graceful](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_outfit), it'll be incredibly helpful for questing!
---
Memes are cultural sentiments and popularities. PKers=brainlets is meant to be humorous. It wouldn't be a meme if everyone were genuinely upset about it.

Is it still technically possible by using a spicy stew at 2 magic? Granted this would require shadow of the storm completion i.e killing lv100 agrith-naar. I don't know if this would impact what other quests you could do and still stay lv3. If you have lv1 all combat stats except 2 magic, you're a level 3.73
---
I wouldn't want to see it done, but it wouldn't take long at all. Just revert enchanted zenytes for anyone who has a magic level below current boostable level.

Honestly, when I do barrows I do at least 25 chests at a time and I went from like 59-75 mage almost strictly at barrows. So using ibans (especially if he mages stuff in the tunnels as well) can be pretty decent exp
---
Ugh, Please understand you only need 26% of the population to vote no and something won't pass.
---
So having the bandwagon effect active is what let things pass. 
---
Personally, I judge based on my own experiences. And I experience a whole lot of toxicity from ironmen.
---
i like to make them say "fuck donald trump" all the reactions are funny af
---
Yes thats why i said i had a hard time with Jad too, took me a couple of tries.
---
Also just noticed the person in the ad is wearing Barrows gloves to chop Maple trees lmao
---
Integrity issues should not be polled
---
If you don't want to farm for a Xeric's Talisman you can also just use the Tithe Farm minigame teleport which will place you *reasonably* close to the herb patch (this will still be true after the Hosidius update). In the long run, the talisman is definitely worth it, and will also help if you ever decide to max out other Zeah favours.
---
Kiddo? XD drop the adderral bud, you‚Äôre getting agitated. I think the meta for normal accounts is just the skill through dhides, so yes this update is mostly for ironmen.
---
I 100% agree, I think the update was good. I felt like I was wasting so much time gathering sand and not gaining xp, plus the logout timers at charters are a pain. A lot of people complain about new content before they actually take the time to try it out 
---
Agreed, luckily it's just a video game. 15mil also wasn't my a huge part of my bank so it wasn't as damning
---
No1careskid ;)
---
Post 70 attack, are godswords the best way to train strength? Worth it to use a D scim at all? 
---
It's a circular problem though, they added heavily botted resources to NMZ to remove the incentive to bot them. Removing them from NMZ will shift bots back to sand buckets which will then drive the price back down and make collecting sand buckets basically exclusively a bot activity.
---
Ahh the walk of shame 
---
my favorite rs god
---
huh, then I agree that its useless. 
---
Weird how bow and mace are great but staff was balanced poorly. (bow is equal if not better dps than tbow on chaos ele)
---
God damn it. How did I miss such an obvious karma income. 
---
"spawn" some healers next?
---
n of 4500 isnt small
---
‚ñ™_‚ñ™
---
Well guess I‚Äôm turning into and Ironman till this is fixed
---
not sure what the cost of ibans is to use but its def not worth maging the stuff in the crypts. just melee them and train mage in a  better way. barrows is extremely slow xp no matter how you spin it compared to other methods of training mage (hell fire strike splashing is the about the same xp/hr as barrows)
---
I don't get it, what's stopping you from selling your runes to literally any other shop
---
No jagex hasn't really said anything about it aside from getting the police involved, but it's pretty clear what happened when you put the pieces together. There's probably some youtube vids on it

I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. Their frustration causes their anger. Anyone rational person would get angry if they were crashed, some people are able to manage it and move on, others choose to center it into  flaming. This phenomenon is not exclusive to one part of the community.
---
&gt; How often are you on this sub

How long have you been on the internet? There will be toxicity present everywhere you go. Perhaps due to the anonymity, perhaps due to past injustices in people's lives. Everyone has a reason to be angry, some people are better at managing it than others.

Looks good to me. Don't like it? Don't go there, simple as that. This is a fantasy game, not everything needs to be realistic.
---
Hey Vsauce.. Michael here, so I've got a question for you, what high alchs for more a yew longbow or 8 yew logs? .... That's right, yew longbow because you only use 1 nature rune to alch it.
---
What do you mean? At fountain of rune or with explorer's ring 4 you don't use runes to alch so they alch for same. But... you have to click more... laughs I know... but the end result is same amount of gp. What? (Confused)

Doesn't that end your task streak tho? i want the hydra slayer helm eventually. Id rather not RIP those free streak points ya know?

Don‚Äôt worry man, congratulate him and know that things will turn around eventually. Think logically, if you go to the duel arena odds are you will lose money over time. Some people will make it, but more will lose it. So just don‚Äôt go there. Setting up a gambling site is stupid too, just work at your job and play rs for fun. Don‚Äôt worry about gp, just enjoy the game.

Parsing your retarded comment, it looks to me like you missed the point. Screeching about how a gaming company doesn't "do any fucking engine work" when they *just overhauled the entirety of the game to work on another platform*, just because they haven't done the "engine work" (whatever that means) that YOU want is peak entitlement.

I dont want to be that guy, but your account is probably already not properly built, which doesn't mean you can't pk or get kills, just you're not at your maximum efficiency.

Most people have exactly what they need to have done in terms of questing on pures so they can achieve mith gloves (Best in slot gloves for pures, 1 def requirement). 
---
If you search for 'mith gloves pure guide' you'll find plenty of guides that tell you every quest you need to get mith gloves (certain # of QPs needed in RFD) that will bring you to a nice attack level before you even train it to whatever attack you need/want. Hope that helps, once again, your account isnt ruined and you can still pk, but you're at a slight disadvantage,

My friend from middle school had the most disgusting home ever that was just so stanky I had to stop being friends with him. In a medium sized home, 9 people, 7 dogs, a cat, and a bird all lived there. Only 4 of the 7 dogs were potty trained, the others just went on those little pee pad things. The cat didn‚Äôt have a litter box, it was expected to go outside or use a pee pad (for anyone who‚Äôs ever smelled cat piss, it‚Äôs putrid) and the bird was fine until I realized they didn‚Äôt clean the shit from its cage. I shit you not I‚Äôd walk into their house to hang out and there was ALWAYS either a shit or piss stain from the dogs on the ground that they didn‚Äôt clean up yet, and it smelled so bad I conditioned myself to breath through my mouth. The final straw was when the pillow I was using to sleep got some dog piss on it, and they just fucking flipped it over to the ‚Äúclean‚Äù side and acted like that was fucking good.

They‚Äôve said before that they can‚Äôt do that.

Practice on the unrestricted world if you can. Don't waste supplies that way and you can set your stats to what you have on unrestricted and see what gear upgrades you need.

i would actually advise you to explore some money making methods and find one that excites you and makes atleast 300k/hr than make your self between 1-2mills and stack up on stamina poitions than train agility to atleast 35 the early lvls are the most crucial google mw on that and after that start doing quest while trying to not get owerwhelmed with the amout of grind you are facing now
---
Great pooping material. Thanks mate!
---
Not worth it at all. Despite how many people say they don't get banned for rwt, Jagex definitely do ban sellers regardless of who you are (speaking from experience) Some get away with it, but others don't. Its not worth the risk.
---
I sold 3b last year when prices were at 0.85 and while the 2.5k felt nice at the time, it really wasn't worth the effort i put into my account and i felt that way a few days after. Gp sell prices are 0.60 now, so absolutely no sense to sell unless you're in a poor country where that money would be life changing.

I feel a new period of bad word jokes rising

Nah you G brah, just sell in increments of 200M. Don't sell all at once.

If you're looking for AFK experience, your best bet is a normal customizable rumble with 5 low-defense bosses. I use full obsidian, berserker necklace, and obsidian sword. Bosses active are Count draynor, king roald, kendal, sand snake, and trapped soul (new arceuss quest). At 75/80/75 I'm currently getting \~65k exp per hour. I use either combat potions (for 15 mins of afk) or overloads (5 mins when I can pay more attention), with absorptions and rock cakes whenever i'm looking. You'll need to get some points to start with but it's pretty self-sustaining after that.
---
You'll likely want a different set-up for points, but its much less afk.

While I do agree with your overall comment, this isn‚Äôt a bug. The potions boost your magic level, as intended, allowing you to cast higher level spells. Rather, it‚Äôs an oversight that they didn‚Äôt predict ironman would use it for enchantment spells otherwise not available to them.

If you are an ironman that has access to a Zenyte, you had to have completed MM2. Which requires 69 Slayer. An account with 69 Slayer *most likely* already had high enough magic, at least 70+, to train a little more to 76. I don't see why the fuss.

How does the system even know this? What if my wife was watching on my account? It's like it just assumes.

This feels like a good old genuine bug, hopefully you get it sorted. If need be maybe reach out via twitter as we all know that can help at times.

Sounds like a really cool idea, but would probably be a seriously hefty amount of work for an item that will probably be rare *and* expensive, so it would only be used by a select few people in the game.

Terrible idea. They didn't abuse a bug or cheat. They used what was in the game. They shouldn't be punished for that

For me, it's because he wants to do the TOB which gives the series direction.  The Karamja only UIM series became way more interesting after he set the inferno as his goal

normies are way more toxic... i play mostly on my ironman now and i just get crashed all the time. im a casual player and i just hop whenever somerthing like that happens but its just a pain.. i get it though we chose this life other ironmen don't get that though.

Wow, yet another instance where Jagex needs a customer support phone line and a team to sort out the countless problems the rest of the company create.

I've gotten a bit lucky on my hespori, 3 buckets and 3 drops of white lily in 52 kills.

If they want to keep them as hespori drops only, maybe it could have a chance to drop in place of an anima seed as well?

I know that before I deironed, making zenytes required me to boost like +4 magic, and I know many people in my CC had to boost like 10+ magic levels. Now that option is gone for anyone who didn‚Äôt abuse it before they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it.

There's a method that lets you accumulate multiple steps and have it count towards the same "clue". So instead of having to roll 3-5 Mort steps in a row (super unlikely), he can kill vamps until they drop 3-5 Mort steps. See [UIM_Verf's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxiOwWJrBIU) for more detail.
---
depends on the account, the bracket, and the desired speed. I trained a 1def1pray gmaul pure to basic readiness in a couple weeks (can be done in a couple days i just don't play much) and it cost like....4-5m? but it's not really done yet and will require like 3-5m in cannonballs alone and none of my stats will be anywhere near 99. to start im going for 50att 60str 1def 1 pray 73rng 73mag 50-60hp.

Oh look, the same joke again.

Oooh I do like that idea of adding them to the anima seed table, as long as they're still rare on that table so that you don't loose out on too many anima seeds. Main's may not like that change though as lily seeds probably mean nothing to them.
---
Green lizards. Which means he can train up and catch imps barehanded and possibly get things off their table

Thanks! I thought it might be something like that. I definitely agree with him doing this for medium clues then.

What would be a good way to make about 4M every 2 weeks?

pls dont hate me... got 95 slayer, since then 5/9 tasks I've done are hydra and I've gotten 3 claws and pet in 465 kc. I'm sorry
---
The amount of steps completed will carry over between clues as long as they don't disappear. So if you have 3 medium clue scrolls on the ground and do one step from each, you'll technically have 3 steps completed and be eligible for a casket. That means he doesn't need to get super lucky and get 1 scroll that'll have 3 morytania steps in a row. He can just farm 3 separate scrolls with morytania steps and juggle them.

Holding alt will put a tiny + and - next to the name. You can quickly block certain items from displaying their names with these. The + will actually highlight items I think.

Is he going to let himself do Desert Treasure? Because without it I don't see inferno being possible. Even 1 ticking his entire way through it no way he'll be able to deal with nibblers consistently enough. Also the issue with healers with Karjama only gear. And the fact that without a 11 tile weapon he can't attack Zuk in half the time he normally would be able to.

---
If you're gonna spend 3m for a Malediction Ward, just spend 5m for a Mage's Book and get an extra +3 magic attack. However that could and should be better spent on upgrading range gear (pegs, anguish, assembler). Ring of Suffering(i) would help your tankiness. And as always, Rigour, while expensive, is the best boost to ranged DPS available.

He has to roll a morytania only clue scroll then ranger boots or something. That's extremely unrealistic.

I guess so. Now that I think about it, it would make more sense to hack accounts anyway. That will give the bots a base amount of gold to work with.

OSRS isn't a game I find myself wanting to watch videos about. Destiny, Warframe, Factorio, but not OSRS. I get all the info I need from the wiki and don't see the point in watching other people play it. Maybe that'll change when I start bothering with raids.

"bug", "oversight" whatever you want to call it, its something that seems so obvious if they actually scrutinize and evaluate their own updates at all. If this was something that happened rarely itd be no big deal but it seems like there are considerable "oversights" and significant bugs ALL the time and I cant help but think they either do a REALLY shitty/not thorough job or literally just dont check things at all before releasing them just to release them quicker.

What side?

There was a post not that long ago where someone got beaver from cutting down their farmed tree. Im not sure about the farming pet part though.

Dusty key is no longer required at 70* agility btw. 65 with a boost.
---
Also the real reward from agility is run energy use. You use much lower run energy at higher agility levels. Agility doesn't have to be like every other skill and have massive unlocks, gradually increasing energy is very nice. Shortcuts are also a reason to grind agility. Not sure I really understand your point.
---
One unlock you didn't mention is access to Saradomin GWD at 70 agility. You can't access this area without 70 agility. Sounds exactly  like what you're suggesting.

I did cb first to like 60 or 70 all stats att/str/def then I grinded out mining till like 75 straight for like a week, then I moved onto slayer for awhile to get mage and range.

This is how selective news control your mindset. They filter everything that doesn't fit the stereotype to further cement them.

Abberant Spectres, according to the wiki, don't drop Ranarr seeds. Could our boi Swampletics be farming Ranarr Seed drops from the Ferals in order to work on Prayer Potions? :O

---
Yeah... keep trying to flex buddy. Im sure mommy dearest will be down anytime now  with your hot pocket.
---
Same here. I just read the script for each Swampletics episode off the wiki instead of watching 
---
I'm just saying it looks very different from their RuneScript code which they have shown several times in the past. I'm saying your code looks nowhere near like what their RuneScript does and the way they did it would be much more verbose, I guarantee you on that.
---
For example, let's have a look at how they handle drops, very hard coded and far from best practices: https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/771695256261853184
---
Not gonna lie, Runescript is pretty gross.
---
So, my only point was, it would likely more than an insignificant amount of development time to create a system for detection of a plugin that hardly anyone would use if it was removed from official third party clients. The first step is Jagex getting it removed from official third party clients.

Very true. When it comes to stereotypes, people love to focus on only one thing, usually the most obvious visible thing.

No, DO feel stressed. Just don't feel anxious. You being nervous and stressed slightly to improve the quality is a really good thing, it means you really care. But if it's starting to bother you then just take a break, we can easily deal without swampletics for few months, while you might actually fuck up a huge portion of your potential

crab people crab people
---
I just started my grind, I'm 100 something KC.  Gratz on your drop!
---
You need about 3 more OSRS for the title to be catchy lmao. Also gratz 
---
Thank you and good luck! I wish the best for your early luck and  anyone dry, as the many people I spoke to there were far from over the grind.
---
I too did the night elf dance of shame in shady Stormwind inns to get a few gold back in '08
---
(Charlie heat version)
---
Read those first five words again.
---
God damn your comment is brutal as it gets haha, hope the mods read it
---
I'd play once they give unlimited prayer or make prayer disabled with more food
---
It's not about pretending it's a win-win.
---
It's not about it being a lose-lose.
---
It's about having fun rather than worrying about efficiency. 
---
ahh thats smart! I'm so slow with the spec! thank you man
---
How would this solve the bigger problem? It's not about ME that's getting annoyed, it's about the daily spam done by bots that promote dicing. They aren't controlled by anyone, hence the mute.
---
Good luck friend. 
---
I feel like the most logical way is to go case by case basis. When there stops being enough content for an episode in a week, make it 2 weeks. When that stops working, prolong it until you find a schedule you can usually stick with and is actually doable.
---
who even is #1?
---
I‚Äôm about 700 KC dry of any unique drop, guess I can‚Äôt complain because I‚Äôm not even close to drop rate, but... fuck you, OP.

Check if your email was compromised.
---
Boi if you get to endgame before getting a single complete set of clue equipment like wtf
---
bet he thinks a sample size of 1000 isnt enough üòÇ
---
I'm 3000 kc so far and I've gotten 2 shield left halves (1/6.7k) and I want to cry but I also understand that the examiners prefer my exams papers to be dry
---
So, the best information I can find is that there is a 45% chance to get the pet by lvl 99. If that is correct you have a~0.007% chance to get it at or before lvl 14
---
What tasks are burstable? I only have 75 slayer
---
Of course no J-Mods will reply to this OMEGALUL
---
The task can seem so rare if you are unlucky, i spent a week trying to get one, including all 500 points from hitting 700 task streak and every point earned from doing the tasks, had to have been 1800-2500 pts, eventually got it and got a claw and leather within 80kc, hopefully its worth it for you as well
---
That's Crazy! Do you kill them at the spot just south of the farming guild?
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hit 99 so I don‚Äôt have to keep checking the time to know what trees are ready, currently at 94.
---
Grind slayer for the long term payoff. 
---
Or maybe spend a few hours on hunter and semi-afk red chins. 
---
Oooor cook at hosidious house with cooking gloves (if you have both available). Not crazy money but it can be afk. 
---
Oh no nevermind.. Just found out that my GPU is a ati radeon hd 4300/ 4500 series.. 
---
2.4k kc 1 claw rip
---
Low xp and gp / hr
---
She says 83
---
That's an absolute lie. I'm constantly fighting bank space.
---
crack the clue cipher solving, specifically by using a program to try every possible cipher shift and see if you get anything that matches the names of items
---
Got assembler on 2 KC as well, but I thought that was happenstance as it is 1/50. Still, this is my first (probably only) stroke of RNG ever.
---
Welcome to sandbwanerletics, my desert only ironman
---
No but if you can‚Äôt afford buckets you haven‚Äôt done enough content for onyx and zenyte
---
:(
---
Smart man, really tho you dont have many options until you get your slayer up a little. Skeletal wyverns and gargoyles are gonna be your first real profitable monsters. Blue drags are your best bet before that I'm pretty sure
---
Yes first room of the temple
---
The net was placed after a different Morytania only UIM asked Mod Ash about it.

---
when sparc mac streams it, is the best time to try it out.
---
it's fun but it's barrier to entry is rough if you want to do well 
---
You‚Äôd be surprised
---
!remindme 7 days
---
Not too sure if that‚Äôs good or bad, but hopefully this helped
---
This for sure, the run wasn't that bad and if done right you can get a run in about a minute I think? But don't quote me on that. I just remember doing RC from 45-70 making cosmo runes
---
You suck at it then X D I‚Äôm citing the rates the mods claimed. Usually results are higher
---
Seems legit
---
Its like speedrunning, i love it.
---
If you play on Android you can download the osrs companion app. It's unofficial but requires no log in details.
---
It allows you to have a floating button that gives access to loads of tools such as clue scrolls or quest guides. I highly recommend it as it makes questions etc on the go SO much easier.
---
Honestly osrs mobile is pretty damn good, so much so that I don't even bother logging on a computer anymore. Yeah some thing are a pain but if we can get them to add a slider to alter the right click speed, it'll be pretty close to perfect imo.
---
nice
---
The developer who was working on it left Jagex, so it got delayed.
---
I like this 
---
I find that hard to believe if you actually organize and purge things that you don‚Äôt need.  I see a lot of people with placeholders for every charge of jewellery and for each dose of potions.  Also quest items that you don‚Äôt need post quest.
---
I was kidding :p
---
But it is objectively a lose lose. Both of you competing for the same resources makes the task at hand more difficult for both of you. You can ignore the fact that it's not a lose / lose, but it is.
---
Post one pic of you bursting please
---
2 Factor authentication on your account AND relevant emails.
---
Set up a bank pin.
---
Uninstall the rat and key logger.
---
Avoid phishers.
---
Not sure what else there is off the top of me head
---
Does my opinion need to be.....cooked? ü§îü§î
---
I haven't played RuneScape for about a decade, and he makes this stupid grindy horseshit seem fun and interesting
---
Well that what a 2 gen old GPU in 2011. Pretty bad haha, well no OSRS comeback for now. Have a good one.
---
repost bruh
---
Your GF plays RS with you?
---
You don't need thousands and thousands of vampires for a single clue completion. He's probably looking for a specific drop from the clues or sth else entirely different
---
brevity is the soul of wit
---
looks cool. lol
---
Get a delivery done did ya?
---
Not bp slaying when you can't afford it will help. 
---
My ex started to play because she wanted to "help me." The only thing she learned how to do though was cook so she'd just cook things and sell them anytime she was on. She would make enough for a bond then use it on herself and tell me she was gonna use the next one on me, lol.
---
get your range up! safespotting harder stuff will make things much easier for certain quests/slayer. 
---
I think every episode he tries to teach something, and that's what makes any content leave you wanting more.
---
What are you wearing? ;)
---
Do you know if dropping it and picking up one later on will save progress?
---
Just stake ur tbow
---
And I think it‚Äôs uses in the pure community since the start of the game kind of overrule that consistency? 
---
Or how about you need dslayer for greendhide top but not the chaps so that‚Äôs why you need defense? Or how about why you can wear blue red and black dhide tops without completing dslayer? 
---
You wanna fix inconsistency‚Äôs? Fine. Then fix actual inconsistency‚Äôs in the game and not your own twisted narration of it in order to spite a group of players that told you to park your posterior that one wildy clue step. 
---
Yeah, it has over 2k darts and scales in it currently.
---
You still have to craft it right? Which is somewhere between 89-98 crafting. I mean sure there are people who have a zenyte piece but you still need zenyte jewellry to make use of this "bug".
---
I comment harsh truths that people don't want to accept.
---
Can someone do like eli5 for the force random events? I would love to test it out but I didn't fully understand how it works.
---
Fuck people that play the game the way they enjoy instead of following a meta-sheep guide from the start right
---
Birdhouses 
---
Jokes aside, although they can spawn items in-game, they can't change droprates (individually).
---
Wow, it just keeps going downhill :(
---
I‚Äôve asked before, but most important upgrade (besides occult) for zulrah? i have basic bitch gear otherwise (ahrims, toxic trident, bp, god dhide) 
---
He might be going for the cut dragonstone or the dragon square shield. Both are best in slot.
---
Although he mentioned he would get access to power amulets soon, so I double he's going for a glory. The combat bracelet might be more useful.
---
Ok, then keep 4 doses and 1 doses
---
‚ÄúWhat is a thesaurus for 500 Alex‚Äù  
---
Not a fucking chance mate
---
I did the diary a couple weeks ago in the same exact scenario! There were 4 (I think a 5th joined really late) of us and we just ran around looking at everything and then would randomly meet up to talk about how none of us knew what we were doing
---
And I was at work with little time left on lunch so I did what I could to help someone but people like you have to be so edgey and btw about shit lmao chill out it's a screenshot oooh scary
---
Back to fishing we go lads!
---
Lol Jagex doesn‚Äôt have customer support. 
---
Yes, yes it was. :)
---
You‚Äôre breaking the sub rules so yes you will be silent. 
---
 !remindme 2 days
---
A while ago I asked CoolMatty about an OSRS speedrun making it in. He said it's unlikely because they avoid online games due to reliance on third party services/connections and the fact that other players could potentially do things that are against their rules(e.g. make a swastika out of fires).
---
People pie could just ask nearby players which answers are failing 
---
What a shit post
---
And 3 doses while your actually making the potions. 
---
I'd take a crystal shield/dfs/dragon sq over a book of darkness seeing as the extra attack isn't gonna do much because the brothers already have nearly nonexistent magic defense. 
---
Same for me, I find engaging (even if repetitive) content much more enjoyable. Three-ticking barb was awesome cause I would try to super concentrate and keep the streak going
---
Good to know. I hadn't been doing them on Entrana but since they aren't really armor I wasn't sure if that was the right move. 
---
I haven't trained smithing in forever because blast furnace fucks my hand up
---
Does dropping a collection log and getting a new one later on reset the progress, or will all collection logs keep track of progress starting with the first log you get?
---
Upper management obviously
---
Devalues that guy with 99 def and 10hp
---
i'm sorry but their is literally 0 chance you dont have it by 71 agility unless you are using the wrong courses, nothing to do with luck.
---
&gt; It has always been allowed
---
Well not quite. They almost shut them down last year.
---
FeelsGoodMan Clap
---
That doesnt make any sense. Your premises doesnt support your conclusion because your considering a different context. We're talking about your time specifically. My time is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand.
---
Wondering why he didn't get permed for RWT on that 1,5b transfer..
---
I dont think so.. he probably wants the flail or torag hammers untio he gets a whip. Hold. A rune kite till he gets a whip would waste inventory 
---
I dont disagree. Better to keep it in, just wish it wasn't like that.
---
Molten glass is the best way for ironmen to train crafting. 
---
For regular accounts the best ways are with items that are much harder to get in bulk, like dragonhide and battlestaves+orbs
---
Another disconnect death smh
---
Uhhh he made like 3 or 4. Nice try though kiddo
---
You're too naive bud, you're gonna keep getting hacked. Have fun though. :^)
---
Almost, yeah. They never told players to stop using it
---
Do you mean subjective? In that case yeah I guess
---
Yo that dude in the lower left has fashion scape on point
---
I mean, fashion is subjective. 
---
However you‚Äôre objectively fucking bad at it. 
---
So THAT'S how you use a semicolon
---
Hide poll results on that world.
