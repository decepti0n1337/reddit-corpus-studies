Honestly this

Lmfao
---
I hope they kill me next.
---
Ah thats makes sense. I just thought it was strange.
---
The sad truth is Jagex has never really cared about CW. The update they did on RS3 years ago by Asherz and Co. literally killed it even faster than normal. It's likely in the bug report queue but it'll be low (or zero) priority. Best of luck to you and the other legit players.

Do you think you'll lose it before you earn 1m cash?

Yeah, also running into people multiple times that you chatted with trying to grind out your twisted banshee task.

Wait what happened what are these relics?

I finally stopped fletching once I hit 60 for the task points. I have about 5 levels til max

You would have to be exceedingly unfamiliar with regular wt to think the twisted league xp rates are even close to "on par," this is such a ridiculous timing to say
---
technically you can save up stams from dr jekyll event, so there are stams just an incredibly limited number

Already knew it would be dead in less than a month smh

that isnt a thing really. you can try twitter, you can ask here, if its a common ish thing its been asked before.

generally theyre very explicit with bans. if you are automating actions its not okay, otherwise its fine.

I have no friends either :(

"No"

"No?"

"How do I get dog"

Had me in stitches

A good portion of us have been focused on the skilling aspect first but the same still applies. I made a friend because he offered to pm me when he was finished with the ploughs, then i payed it forward to another guy. I’ve seen them both atleast 5 times across the continent since. One of them was even rank 6 earlier today. Crazy

@JagexGambit while these awesome updates are happening can the lunar spell book be revisited? Certain spells, specifically the one that views another players stats, seem outdated.
---
He's still alive probably since they didn't even check the bodies DNA like they are suppose to.
---
It's boring af that's what it is
---
I can help, what gang are you in?
---
which is multiplied by x5 or even more so it means that xp rate are actually decent. And you don't really need 99 anyway unless you are going for top hiscores. 77 is enough if you are confident that you will clear raids.
---
Well, you also have to consider that they will add more items over time as well. Not every item from whatever the current league is and the old leagues will be obtainable in one to. So over time you will effectively end up with a more limited supply. Won’t be like the Phats but it will stay reasonably high.

Regretting not choosing endurance while at work

I said prayer flicking still drains your prayer.
---
ONLY 1 tick perfect prayer flicking DOES NOT drain your prayer.
---
Learn to read or go back to school you uneducated swine.
---
So a question sort of related about the option being able to receive the dark dagger and blurite sword. 
---
Ever thought of it being possible to take the rage weapons out of Tolna's Rift after the A Soul's Bane quest? Even just for fashionscape, I've always wanted to equip these again.
---
who cares? :D
---
Goeie
---
Maybe you should have picked a different one. This was not an oversight by jagex it was an oversight by you. It litterly gives a description of what it does but rather than thinking maybe you didn't want it you blindly picked it, that is on you.
---
Legit bug. Have seen
---
This is not about maxed mains. This is about literally anyone above level 40. If you started grinding 600 beginner clues for the emote at level 3, you'd probably outgrow beginner clue loot by the 50th clue lol. There is absolutely no point in grinding that many clues. Where in my comment do I talk about pandering to maxed mains? I'm not even close to maxing. I don't understand where you're coming from on this.
---
Ahh, only the main definition of prayer flicking doesn't drain prayer, how silly of me!
---
How's this whole thing going for you bud? Lazy flicking isn't prayer flicking.
---
Bullshit. You used a plugin from a 3rd party client. Have you tried doing it yourself instead of depending on a plugin because you're so bad?
---
It's impossible to perfectly prayer flick every single tick for so long unless you're using a plugin from a 3rd parry client that tells you exactly when to flick your prayer.
---
&gt;group ironman twisted league next time,
---
Hooooly shit this sounds amazing.
---
Start another account. You are the one who picked it before finishing fishing.
---
Does it work?
---
Exactly the same I have lmao
---
Really, we are all just looking for the fun we had in 2005..
---
You're a moron. There's 2 types of prayer flicking, and they're both of OSRS Wiki.
---
There's regular prayer flicking, and then there'a 1-tick prayer flicking.
---
ALL of the info I just talked about I found on OSRS Wiki.

This is the only acceptable way to watermark something: moved off into a corner with the transparency turned down. Thank you for not blaring it in our faces that ****THIS IS MY SITE LOOK AT MY STUFF****, it’s one of my pet peeves.

Does brimstone keys still award torstols? Otherwise, yes.

“Beginner clues are dead content for anyone past early game.”
---
are the league worlds new worlds or just using existing worlds and re-purposing them for leagues?
---
Nice.
---
They're designed to be a difficult choice. It gives you incentive to play in future iterations and take another route (or bond up a second account to give Jagex more money).

U fr?

Anyone ever told you you're a prick? I'm jw
---
Just make irons a separate room to mains or an instance etc.
---
perhaps if it cost some amount of league points?  If you completed all tasks you would gain **90,670** points so perhaps spending like 5k-10k points for a reroll seems fair?
---
A redesign of the portal nexus interface would be welcome. The current design has a lot of wasted space. Something more akin to the jewellery box would be lovely!

Wow, I've never read something that unironically translated to "reeeeeeee". Congratulations on being the first.

Yep. It's for sure now. I would definitely quit without Runelite.

Totally man
---
Tithe farm isn't instanced super well. I don't know how it will be in Twisted, but it definitely gets some overlap in the main game. A quick world hop fixes that, but considering how many people will do it in Twisted that may not work.
---
And Tithe was great! It lets you choose whether to grind farming slowly but easily or just burn through it in a couple weeks.
---
This, but forget about even restarting.

Either way 20% favor is only like 30 minutes work for any house, so you haven't wasted much time at all.

None of them are available in twisted league, what actually is the best cape in it? Is construction the only skillcape possible?

Someone get Lorne Michaels on the phone
---
Depends tbh.
---
Arcane Courier is most useless imo. The other two are just too good.
---
Hardcore Harvester shouldn't be activated right off the bat because it actually makes training things like fishing much more click intensive, but having lots of supplies is good.
---
Unnatural Selection is gonna be good for combat training if you get the 30% damage boost for slayer. Also if you're gonna Slayer Prod things like Hydra it'll be really good.

Dangerous for everyone else

I agree, I've just been subbed to WoW for a while and wanted to wait until my sub time fell off to really devote a lot more time to OSRS. Now that I am, I'll probably be getting membership next week.
---
I'm excited to waste precious sleep time playing everything OSRS has to offer.
---
This is the exact reason they gave the relic tiers out to the community before the game mode began, if you didn’t plan it out then you take your choice unfortunately. A relic reroll would be wayyy to op at any point in the game, even an hr in because I could get the run, do all the quests then have teleports and not need the infinite run anymore an hour into the game mode
---
What does this mean? Why is this so massively upvoted?
---
blessed d'hide/anti-fire shield/rcb should be enough. Dragonfire shield helps a lot defensively. If you need to, bring brews/restores for your food so you can carry more effective HP. Most of the Galvek fight is just dodging his attacks, there shouldn't be enough auto attack damage to kill you off
---
Settled, C Engineer and Torvesta are probably my favorite creators. Mr NoSleep has some cool content too. There are tons and tons of good OSRS content creators!

&gt;The update they did on RS3 years ago by Asherz and Co. literally killed it even faster than normal

Please elaborate, I am very intrigued.

What about the dude that collects your stuff?

Unless they changed it, you can reobtain Silverlight in a F2P world (which arguably makes it even dumber, but at least you can)

Are you able to choose to do the same task twice in a row?

Wait really? When did they confirm this
---
Is there any chance we could add magic secatures working whilst in inventory rather than equip. I don't do herb runs but I know many people do
---
If it's for fashionscape, then imo it would be nice if we could just craft gem-less silver jewelery, just like how we can craft gem-less gold jewelry. Make them require lower levels and give less crafting exp than tiaras, and it wouldn't really affect the game in any negative way.

Yeah, I just dream about finding out a hidden "gem" haha.. Would be so cool! Heyy I actually did that way back when I played, mage/2h. Only thing is that it lacks damage :/, they need to be a bit hurt, and you need to do some chip damage first.
---
Kind of yeah. You get 100 seeds and you have to turn in so many fully grown plants (I think it's 60 but dont quote me there; it's probably more). It's really only an issue of you try to plant a fuck ton at once and are too slow. They don't die if you do it right.

I was thinking a bit to try something like  
---
99 att, 99 str, 40 def, 34 prayer. That might be really fun. Not too original, but maybe viable?  
---
Also thought a bit about making some kind of anti-pure :P  
---
maybe using event rpg and going for stats like;  
---
1 att, 99str, 1/40/99 def, 1/31 prayer. :p
---
if you're in Leagues for the long haul, you should almost certainly barb fish until 60 agility, as there isn't any viable methods to train it before 60. Then feel free to pop harvester.
---
Damn. Doesn't that make dragon claws the only spec weapon?
---
&gt; Easier doesn't always mean better
---
And that doesn't mean that easier always means worse.
---
Could easily be abused. Start with prayer relic, kill dragons all day to immediately reach 70 prayer, then switch to endurance gang.
---
Yes I assumed, yes I was wrong, but a simple correction would’ve sufficed. But thank you.
---
Oh, whoops lol
---
I killed them in the edgeville dungeon back when I was new, simply because I didn't know there was any alternative, so it's hard for me to comment on it. I do remember getting attacked 5-10 times and getting killed several of those times. 
---
I remember getting frustrated and switching to blue dragons in the Taverley dungeon because of it, if you safespot them with range then you can have your whole inventory open for loot and it's super chill. But if your ranged is too low for that and you want to stick with chaos druids, my guess would be that Taverley is better, if you get killed a single time in Edgeville and lose a few 100k worth of herbs then the gp/hour of Edgeville is gonna be worse, and if you stay there long enough someone is bound to PK you eventually.
---
Love it, what arrows you using for this calc? Im assuming the supply of darrows wont be enough to maintain using them with endurance relic.

I plant wrong seeds when I'm doing herb runs often. Usually I'll be at the farming guild and need to plant a torstal or something but click my toadflaxs because I'm so use to it. I've actually been begging for the idea to dig up herbs mainly as well because it's possible with other plants so why not herbs?

first and foremost is the humor. if a meme is degraded by having a watermark on it then I just dont include it. otherwise you sneak it in subtly to where some reddit autists have to analyze the entire picture to see it. For everyone else casually scrolling through they don't even glimpse it, so it doesn't interfere. and then when it gets reposted I still get free publicity

3x pearl AND you get 3 golden tenches if you manage to catch one

i also included quite a few obby items when he doesn't have 60 def yet, yeah

kinda implied that those are for when he gets the appropriate stats/gear

It just leads to a weird situation where I'd prefer the Rack more than the infinite shaker but I'd prefer either to none. But I have to vote no to the infinite shaker to vote for my most preferred option.

Extra Note: I thought that some one might have made a guide on wiki about gaining the most points, the quickest.
---
Eh. There are enough gold sinks (construction etc.), and high alch in concert with the GE is actually a pretty elegant (if unintended) way of putting a price floor on non-BIS stuff to prevent it from collapsing.
---
Without high alch, stuff like rune med helms would go for 18 gp and drop tables would just be littered with total garbage.
---
I used to train mage with cammy teleport back in 04 and it was common to see a lot of people there.
---
Ok, so keep following that logic train.
---
"Perhaps they could reduce the cost of older rewards to try to offset the more diverse reward pool, but as long as they are obtainable I don't see it being a big issue."
---
That then devalues doing any season of League since you can just get the rewards of the previous League season at a discounted price. 
---
Let's say this is your first League you completed, but Leagues have existed for the past 6 years pumping out cosmetic rewards (whether it's 1 cosmetic per 3 months or 6 cosmetics per 2 months, the sheer number of cosmetics adds up over 6 years). Going by the lowest number of uniques that's 24 items by now.
---
Jagex is just going to piss off people who spent 6k points on a slayer helm for this season if they reduce it to 500-1k points next season. 
---
How is Jagex going to make it fair for the people grinding Leagues out every season that manage to get all the cosmetics while simultaneously appealing to casual players to get said cosmetics without it being unfair to either one?
---
I'm just trying to say Jagex is starting to form a shit storm of undesired consequences unless they clearly and thoroughly figure out how to balance these cosmetics.
---
GP swapping isn’t against the rules. Lmao.

That's a big reason we got the ge,(at first was gunna be the trading Post.)
---
Also there was a ton of scamming
---
On top of that people didn't want to have to have an alt eith an autotyper to sell or buy stuff for your main. If you didn't do this you were wasting massive amounts of time sitting around.
---
I feel theres better ways to simulate the community like this. Early osrs was special becux of rhe community. Early Dmm and twisted league are the only ones that have come closr so far.
---
If you 3t it doesn't matter anyway
---
You have 1,000 people playing League, but 10,000 people want the cosmetic. Demand our meets the supply of those cosmetics. Cosmetics surge in price, and now you have people playing league for gp purposes only, much like the beginning of dmm before they banned swapping.

He's the boring pet

I remember buying a dharoks set on the trading post the only time I used it.
---
Wow weird, they might need to change that icon tbh.
---
The chance of receiving skilling pets scales with levels, which are easier to obtain with 5x exp, you arrogant twat.
---
But Venusaur is the best out of those. The only competitively viable one.
---
It should have a "Yes, and don't ask again" option available after the second time you've taken a charter ship.
---
maybe don't cry about a natural death of a stale system in a 20 year old browser java based game, all day everyday - posting and deleting threads without actual content in them
---
Use 3rd party client = ban
---
Yes points from all leagues will be considered same currency in main game. But future leagues will have their own new rewards, people who grind then will have to choose between the new rewards or buying more of the old ones..
---
The supply will still be extremely limited.
---
kind of a neat idea.
---
I doubt it's because it's charged it's probably more about the supply of glories.
---
Sort of like a grand place to do exchanges you could say.
---
Its a little sad that he feels like he can't stream unless its on a hcim or some new game mode, I feel like most people would be cool watching him just play a standard iron
---
I remember them making it so big so they could say they doubled the map size
---
this'll do
---
Laws used to be 3k each normally.
---
Imagine thinking it was feasible to even grind solos without stamina pots. Accumulator gang people must not know how Olm head phase works.
---
" if he's not relevant to me he couldn't be relevant to anyone else "
---
Unfortunately that’s the highest iOS that model supports and osrs requires iOS 10.0 minimum.
---
Infinite prayer ? You could be on to something
---
Won't be able to use them in main game though.
---
The chance increase from 1-99 is infinitely small, my dude. It might as well not exist.
---
You could say that there's the chance increase at 200m exp, and you would have a good point, but that's easily fixable by them just disabling that 200m drop rate bonus on TL worlds.
---
I think they might have finally done it, Killed. Pvp the  last time I remember people being this disheartened about it was right after the wildy got removed.But the difference was that eventually the PvP scene grew and got better/ interesting updates shortly after.
---
Craters were interesting, abused but still fun.
---
The og pvp was insane hype and actually fun. Even with the 26k abusers.Bringing bh back to the wildy on specific worlds was actually super awesome and I remember it being active all the time.
---
Even the +1 worlds were interesting. Super fun  to Korasi people for bank even if you didn’t get their loot. It Started getting less fun when poly/staff of armadyl/ plants/bolas/ and 6 doses... bunch of other crap too.
---
But man it’s kind of unbelievable they haven’t been able to ever capture that magic.The last time wildy was hype was at the beginning of osrs for about 8-10 months and then for about 3-4 months after the inital release of bh1
---
The community wants good pvp updates; every time there is one the scene is brought back to life  again. Don’t let reddit fool you. They are a very vocal 20% of the game. If they can figure away to do it right again. people will always come back for this games pvp there is just something so unique about it that no other game has.
---
The g.e. spammers are now offering 300mill instead of 250mill to go to soandso youtube channel!

Yeah, he is some kind of noob pk'er who only pk's PvMers and clue hunters.

Dear king,
---
As you have might noticed yourself your comments are a little less positive lately. Are you getting enough sleep or is there something else on your mind that may require some help from the people around you? If there is anything I can assist you with that would make your days a little more positive, I would gladly help.
---
Yours faithfully,

Can confirm am the first pet that he got.
---
Lies. A couple of plugins no longer in any mainstream 3pc are not allowed

No

To put this into perspective, assume you're chopping maples. At 45 WC, your drop rate is 1/220,793 per log. At 99, your drop rate is 1/219,443 per log.
---
holy shit
---
I got a fucking heron pet on twisted league
---
Im so pissed
---
worth every bit of it
---
Just spouting shit. No source I bet?
---
I know exactly what you mean, I took a 6ish month break from most pvm content and focused probably 90% of my time playing on working my way towards max, then the basilisk jaw update came out which forced me to grind more slayer for ... a lot longer than I would have liked (4575 kc on task). But I had that runelite prayer reorder on for so long it really threw me for a loop when I had to relearn it all again. I'm also not going to play on my zerker account til either the new poll passes because I want to know if I actually need to practice switching prayers for the lower tier prays or if it'll be nice and smooth like I had it haha.
---
Please suggest this with like 50 worlds. Are you not reading all the discussion am creating on these threads.

Is that earl without a sweatshirt?
---
"Great"? Nostalgic, sure, but I don't think any sane person actually *enjoyed* that clusterfuck, lol.
---
Dude, you cant "waste rng". That clue on your other account wouldnt give what you got in twisted league jesus christ people need to understand
---
There might not even be future leagues. They are being very vague because this is still an experiment.
---
The weebs are taking over the rank 1 spots D:
---
This is also like 1/5k chance or 1/10k same droprate as third age so not THAT rare
---
Wasn't falador the main trading venue back in old rs2? I feel like this may just be a shitty jpeg from 2013-14 oars.

Jagex has become a master at segregating their players.

Used to sell mine on the forums!

the med helm kind of ruins it..

You are not alone brother.

I don't miss it either but the game just had more /tegridy back then...

Can confirm. I got 3 bruma torches and 2 other item stacks from 1 crate

Pegasians rely on getting ranger boots drop way more than cerb crystal, infinity boots are locked behind a nasty grind, and mage attack bonus isn't as important due to mage being broken. The real powerhouse for cerb is those primordials. The ge prices for the crystals speak for themselves.
---
I hope you don't want to run either because you won't be

it does if you use magic to charge it, but ye no crafting

Actually fuming lmao

No GE on Sundays!

the hunter is now the hunted

Why are you gaeh

This looks great and definitely should be considered
---
Thing is, the home teleport isn’t very “powerful” compared to the array of teleports that we have for any where else. 
---
It’s a useful aid for new players that have no access or bearings and it also helps out in those situations where you physically can’t leave i.e. stuck across an agility shortcut.

x 1/3 chance of getting 5 reward rolls = 1/168 quadrillion

Your design &gt;&gt; the other 3, but i don't get why we would add dragonstone armour? Not like we have armours from the other gems. I'm confused.

Why would you make this post some people get it in their 3rd try
---
Engine work
---
bought cape
---
yes I may sound, but thats because the number of attempts is very fishy looking. 10 attempts only and the guy gets the cape. I did everything all by myself.
---
Runelite is fine. What you been clicking? Quitting streams? Double xp? Get it from runelite.com?
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
Gg cape
---
Nope, I recon someone’s seen me standing in the GE on a low population world then just tried brute forcing my password
---
How can you get easy warm clothing?
---
it is. its not selling gold its advertising a website that sells gold. Ironman are allowed to talk.
---
Im all for this
---
My primary F2P money making method in 2008 was selling the runes for Varrock / Falador teleports in Lumby bank for 2k a pop, 1k on slower days. Surprising how many people needed that service.
---
I would personally recommend *not* being efficient and just playing the game and exploring the world. Take time with your quests and just get a feel for everything at first.
---
You must have been a broke little 2011 boi back in the day 😂

When you have a goal in mind you want to complete make sure you have a second goal after that so you have something to do once your main goal is done. Also join a clan! You will have so much more fun playing this game with a clan.
---
Agreed, don't let the game be just about getting a big bank to show off. Mess around! Games are supposed to be fun.
---
it's 2k19 fellas, give prostate stimulation a go.

The meme is that they are not insecure about themselves and therefore speak the way people should speak to each other. Kind of a projection of the insecurity that often comes from being young, feeling lacking in physical aspects or in other ways.

Hi, jagex here. no soz cant fix.

I remember selling charcoal for 50k in the very early days of osrs
---
Just checked. Nope :(

What
---
Closed on Sunday. You my chick fil a.
---
This reads like a bad author trying to imagine how they would have felt in the scenario. What is the point of this post, why would you type in chat, why did you buy your cape?
---
A guy on front page got double rangers on 1st clue in leagues lol. First pair I've ever gotten though across my main and ironman
---
I suppose you guys don't track what farmable the pet was received on but it would be cool to get a tangleroot skin corresponding to the plant you got the pet on instead of just free re-skins or something
---
you choose to limit yourself
---
I was always f2p back then but I would world hop flipping bbones and limps all day everyday. I remember when I hit 1m first time and bought full black(g). I thought I was the shit. I kept going until I had every f2p armor banked. I opened that acc in rs3 a few years later and was very disappointed that my once millions of armor were worth almost nothing.
---
fix your channel layout.
---
So at the smallest that'd work out to 100k an hour at 83, which isn't too bad.

Curious. I've never tried VR.. how much does a set up like this cost? Is it cool?

They got banned a few months ago strings went from 85-210. Noticed 2 weeks ago posts about them starting again price now 90-110 and crashing. Will be a good buy soon and hold until they get banned again in a few months.
---
filthy casual
---
What do you mean the only decent one? Unnatural selection is insanely good and arguably better than harvester.
---
It's probably a private script that someone wrote for themselves or paid someone to write.
---
The accounts are hand-trained (probably by a Venezuelan) and each of them runs on a different safe IP. 
---
That's the technique used to have accounts last that long. Some get randomly banned, but a lot survive for weeks if not months.

Honestly.. this would be amazing

all relics are so damn good, really good job on them to jagex tbh

if you pick devotion and the double prayer xp relic later on, you have 40x prayer xp, that is pretty nuts haha

Id say if it isnt in your message board on login screen i wouldnt trust it

The 420 group chat while listening to Flume, christ dude LUL

Yep I totally agree.

He only asked you how to train hunter, jeez. Maybe give him a response and he’ll leave you be

At the time I commented I didnt realise you got permanent in game rewards for the non twisted league worlds. I understand what you meant now
---
doesn't matter in what skill, competition is always hard when it's about getting n1 spot , so well done dude and gratz! :D
---
Wanna see me capture the flag?

Wanna see me do it again?

I am really far in unfortunately 😂 250k xp for lvl 99 mining

Ah, fair enough.

So he definitely can't do anything unless he gets in my email?

Is everybody on twisted league iron?

If so fine, if not, surely a new symbol?

with that logic, slayer shouldn't be allowed back-to-back either

What about the lore of "The sand crabs are going to become an endangered species!!"
---
Does anyone even care? Why are you posting this?
---
Can't with hp cape because you can't obtain it,though does stack with HP prayer, i tried that one at least , regen bracelet should work as well
---
If I reset via my email can they access it? How did they get it locked in the first place? I wonder if they know my email or password or even more?
---
SLAPP LIKE NOW
---
it's a good intro to playing ironman in the normal game as well i think which is even harder
---
Way way back I absolutely loved Rc'ing and could craft laws at a relatively low cb level. Being a crafter instead of a runner on the law world was one of my favorite things to do. Zammy robes and law talisman for life.
---
ez bank for years :D
---
Does this require BiS farming tools to do efficiently? I haven’t gotten theatric shovel from Fairytale 2 yet.
---
Yeah I had it sitting in my bank for years now and honestly it looks pretty cool, it would be sick if everyone can just get it back.
---
IPhone 6s it’s not that bad.. 64 GB. What’s that have to do with it?
---
What is so rare there?
---
Just repeating what J-Mods have said.
---
Hard disagree, most of the tier 2 relics looks horrible except the slayer one imo. Picking your own assignments is just so broken in context with the rest of the game, can easily farm whatever you want.
---
I also think endless endurance is a no brainer. Saving runes/ammos seems completely useless mid/end game and the prayer one is pretty meh too.
---
Just because you didn’t understand the title doesn’t mean it’s not relevant. He means a bot advertising the gold site, not selling actual gp in twisted league. Which is retarded to think in the first place so yeah
---
iPhone 6s.. shouldn’t be that bad
---
Yeah, cancelling my subscription as we speak.
---
What are the chances of receiving double rangers? I’ve seen this happen so many times in the past few months lately.
---
It’s on twisted league there is no normie.
---
Lol, I remember being on f2p and mining with my mithril pick at varrock east. This guy came up to me and said if I would take his iron ore to the bank and bring it back noted, he'd give me like 1k a trip!  Score!!  I did 35 trips for the guy and ran to varrock west, hopped to world one and got a Rune pick!  Best Saturday ever!
---
Another time someone saw me smelting an Al kahid. He traded me 100 iron and 200 coal and told me if I made these into steel bars for him, he would give me some amount of money my child brain thought was a good deal.  So any time I was bored or strapped for cash I'd whisper him for more work.

The problem is most of it is WAY too big &amp; irrelevant. Nearly every bank and building is empty.
---
Lovakenj is like the size of 2 Varrocks + 1 Lumbridge. Arceuus is 2 Faladors + 1 Draynor Village. Piscarilius has water and cooking in every building (it reminds me just of the Slug Menace offshore dock).  Shayzien is full of rectangles, nothing to do, and yet is still the size of 2 Faladors stacked on top of each other.

I think Hosidius is well designed because it's small and looks way more natural.

I get why it's not in artisan from a balance perspective: artisan would've been objectively the best relic, with only combat-focused accounts choosing the combat relic instead. Construction, Herblore, and RC falling all under one relic would've been rather imbalanced. But I think Agility should also have been placed under the Gathering relic as well, it's a really unfortunate skill in this League.
---
Where's rendi's no supplies inferno or no pillar inferno?

You can only have one of each clue, if you have one of every clue in your bank then you can't get another one to drop at all.
---
When OSRS had just been released and everyone was trying to get the super basic items was a great few months. Feel like the economy has gone haywire and even level 90s have 100m+ banks.

Would love a server with 5x exp with no GE that reset every 6-12 months. I'd play the shit out of that.

Nor did demonic gorillaz who shit out law runes, or good magic shops
---
He said there's a tax.  He's purposing a gold sink alongside an item sink, as both these days are inflated.  There's a reason the majority of items in terms of gear is driven by their high alchemy value.
---
they should have just put the two options in one poll question which wins by popular vote regardless of percentages
---
what the fuck even is your submitted history holy shit
---
I am not very happy with the way question #9 and #10 are polled.
---
I'd like both, but I prefer the POH Spice Rack. So now I basically have to vote "no" on #9 even though I do actually want it. Please reconsider how those polls work.
---
What about just adding a GE tax? It’s been talked about before.
---
You bank, you lose your spot...
---
I'd honestly like the Tyras helm one of it was "open face" but for the rarity the third option seems a bit lackluster
---
Yeah, the claw drop is replaced by the DHL in Leagues. Same goes for the hydra leather/Ferocious gloves
---
So you're telling me there's a chance?!
---
I think I understood, but item inflation is a problem that eventually remedies itself when an item hits HA value. At that point there could be infinite black dhide bodies in the game and their price would still be HA value.
---
Man in my mind charged glories are 60k, uncharged 55k. My how the nighty has fallen.

Guess I got myself too riled up by watching too many videos telling me way too many things, making me go crazy and doubting every single thing. You were right, I did everything on Rapid and I got the cape! :D Thanks!

Things being crowded are a part of the game. It balances things out and makes other methods viable. Jesus we dealt with this for a decade, i don't understand why everyone suddenly wants the best possible things for themselves without any downsides.

If it is crowded it might be worth doing other activities or changing ones strategies accordingly. Dealing with other players and downsides/upsides from them is supposed to be a part of an RPGMMO, this isn't Skyrim or some shit where everything exists for you only and isn't supposed to be a solo player game.
---
Agree rot man bad. But not sure how time spent at the gym is particularly relevant to moral character.

I made absolute bank from it. I was buying uncharged glories, and dragonstones/crystal keys for 90-100k each, had a friend who'd make me glories from the dragonstones for free, and I'd sell the charged for 110-115k each, or swap charged for uncharged + 10k. Absolute bank made.

I really want willow tangleroot
---
try an iron maybe. or, buy some justicar and run south so you stop dying pre-triples/zuk.
---
Back in the day I'd run law runes for hours then take my hard earned laws and spawn tp to camelot. 99 magic is the only 99 I have on what is now RS3 lol.

I believe you mean "98% of the Twitch chat emote soundboard's videos in 2019 have this image"
---
Might not be a bad idea to add a full suite of silver jewelry that is aimed at the F2P community.
---
if you arent paying an army of venezulans to skill on your account 247 are you even playing efficiently?
---
Is that w425 or the members world?
---
Id be risking about 1m unskulled which im fine with and will hopefully get me plenty of fights
---
Yeah barrows gloves, ancestral top + bottoms and fury will give over 100, I think that gives more incentive to bring other amulets/gloves than just max strength every time
---
Friend of mine said he is going for it. I wish his weird ass best of luck.
---
That's like the main real life skill that it teaches tbh. lol
---
I recommend doing all the quests, try doing them without a guide if you like puzzles and such
---
Niceeee
---
Agreed. 
---
Skillcapes with no perks, but current stats.
---
yea wtf OP, don't post shit like this with a title like that without trying it yourself.
---
if they did offer skill capes they should just disable all perks on them. but I don't personally think they should make an expection on skill capes.
---
Man I miss my copy.
---
We all just get high and share outdated SpongeBob memes with each others. It's great.
---
Kind of odd that they would let the turbo-spergs who find things like this take advantage of it and then immediately block off normal players.
---
Pizza delivery pro-tip: get a motorcycle license, buy a Japanese scooter for $800 off of craigslist (cheap maintenance, cheap insurance, 90+mpg, Chinese scooters likely won't last a year if bought used), weld a pizza carrying box onto the back, filter traffic when there's no police around, profit. 
---
Seriously, this turns pizza delivery into an actually decent entry level job. More $11 to spend on membership.
---
Or maybe just stop playing for a while. It’s a game not your family.
---
Wow they are making 20k an hour
---
Ah yes that tends to trigger fascists nowadays, I think I'm supposed to use the term "white identitarian ethno-nationalist"
---
40+ hours invested on an account that gets reset
---
or 
---
40+ hours pvming on your main game account making cash at 2m+ p/h and just buying them. 
---
Decision seems like a no brainer if you're just looking for a singular reward to purchase.

This is some damn fine bait my dude

I could see issue with how it makes farming a more active skill rather than passive, but we also have tithe farm, so idk what theyre on about lol
---
I might do it but my bonds wont pay for themselves.
---
Remember when wrong tagged posts got removed
---
I had this kind of moment in brimhaven dungeon yesterday. Figured leaf blades ace would work on vine.... WRONG
---
yeah but it's so immensely helpful during that time and allows them to do things like 0 wintertodt food, the shaman thieving method, etc that the other relics can't do as efficiently, in addition to already being probably the best like i said.  
---
adding a little early game strength to the other relics which are definitely not early game relics would make them much more appealing.
---
Oh.. oh no
---
Hello friends, recently Jagex published  this [NEWS REPORT](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1)  
---
I am using Runelite and using Menu Entry Swapper from my old setup, the plugin is still there, so either it's bannable and hasn't been changed yet on Runelite, OR it's safe to use. I don't wanna risk my account :(
---
Underwear
---
I threw up
---
Woot
---
The overall mindset has absolutely changed. I'd also argue a big reason is that most of the people on OSRS now are likely adults rather than a mixture of kids, teens, and adults.
---
Adults tend to try and min/max everything because they have other responsibilities to attend to, whereas kids are just doing what they want to do. There's nothing dictating that you need to maximize your in-game gains besides your personal goals and objectives.
---
I've literally never had anyone seriously tell me that I'm not good because I wasn't going for max xp/hr (and it's not as if I have any crazy stats, I have a very average account). Even if that was a prevalent occurrence, who actually cares what some random says about how efficient you are in a clicking game? Most of the community is capable of recognizing that for the vast majority a skill cape isn't worth carpal tunnel.
---
So are you saying the arcane courier would be better for afk mining and such?
---
Thanks!
---
U see woox play sometimes like his fucking route is determined by trees and shit hes got a talent or something
---
thank you
---
It's your choice, I agree with you the game is always grindy no matter how its released
---
But I dont think this mode is really designed for afkers...
---
Climate change is real
---
Jokes on u the metronome is embedded deep into my psyche
---
U see m2k fall asleep holding a game cube controller fam that's me with a mouse I click perfect 100bpm
---
There are no double xp weekends for osrs.
---
Did you finish it?
---
Theres no double xp weekend. Dont fall for it.
---
youll drown in gems from konar/todt
---
bloods you can pick slayer task and get as many as u want
---
Oof
---
You really got hurt by the imaginary numbers lol
---
I've uninstalled and redownload the game.. any ideas on what it could be? Because I was able to switch worlds before I just cant now, it's making it real hard to grind twisted league Haha
---
Adolf Hitler grew old in Cuba.
---
He said they would announce it 2-3 months ahead, buy the stuff you “need” before then. This is for nostalgia
---
Do people really not like A? I think it looks cool.
---
Well I don't play twisted League so maybe its a problem with twisted League players. You are trying to only switch to twisted league worlds right?
---
I'm pretty sure you could use long range on crystal bow and out distance cross bows and magic casts
---
I think theres no "help" for that, take a break and just play when you are motivated to do something. You are pretty much in the same situation where I was long time ago, but then I made ironman and been motivated to play since then, not saying you should do the same but thats what kept me interested in the game
---
Oh yeah, took me 2100 kills
---
I know the scams you’re referring to, but I was talking about the news on the official site. I misread and thought it was for osrs, but it’s just rs3. Thanks anyways though guys.
---
Drop it at WT and watch everyone freak out trying to grab them
---
You’re mistaken. Xp multipliers in their mode are 5x base xp, 2x xp for relic 3 (for skill group of your choice), and 2x xp from relic 5 (if you choose that specific relic).
---
Give me tangleroot first, please
---
He got that instant transmission
---
Gz! I find the best thing to do is watch a guide to get a gist of what you need to do and then just send it and make changes that suit you as you learn.
---
“Fun”
---
is Cerberus with blowpipe and d'hide more kills per hour than regular melee setup(barrows armour + cudgel ) and is it better profit too ?
---
No. You can obtain a construction cape on zeah and that's the bis cape, should reward players who decide on 99 construction during the league
---
Look, we can abstract my comment and argue that nothing means anything so the person who adds the most value to their life is the richest.
---
On the other hand, I - and the majority of people - really do not feel strong about their goals or achievements. Content machine? Sure, but even that depends on the content creator.
---
Vocal minority caring about their arbitrary achievements that are self inflated, shouldn't be allowed to have as much sway in the discussion sphere as they do.
---
I could have just as valid arguments about game design and mental health towards this video game, without sinking 2000 hours into it.
---
Just a heads up, you can’t get 2x xp for slayer or agility from relic 3, so divide your rates by 2.
---
Get this man a Nobel prize, we solved it boys.
---
I cant open the world switcher at all that's what makes me think it could be a client problem same with when I log out I cant oprn the world selection
---
how you guys staying alive in wintertodt with low healing food in twisted league? at 40 hp I just got killed at like 10% todt with no food. I have endless endurance.
---
Thanks for the post, I always welcome more buttholes in my life
---
I don't know then sorry. I'm not having the same problem so I couldn't tell ya.
---
can someone explain?
---
Jebaited
---
No worries man thanks for the reply anyway
---
screenshot is not me

Hurhur how u no sum1 is vegan???

He tell u!!!!! Bahahaasa

I still don't know...
---
Oh I see, I don't think your main will affect it but it might be worth tweeting a jmod to check it isn't a bug
---
Kind of like them unsarcastically bringing up nerfing NMZ still from time to time even though it's been the meta for over 5 years and would cause the biggest uproar in OSRS history?
---
Mot toch kinne rauke
---
Lol no
---
It's possible people can Smith them already and are selling them to that shop. If so you wont be able to purchase from the shop until it is down to just stock for the store
---
Yes I still have the poster inside but I was thinking of hanging it in my room
---
imo you shouldn't do slayer when youre low level cause low level tasks are so cancer, unless you like them :D I started slayer when I was 85 cb so I went straight to nieve for tasks, don't remember exactly how I got my combat stats up, I think most of the xp came from quests and various minigames. You could always do wintertodt, its really good for some early ironman stuff, I guess thats what most of the people do first on their ironman
---
is there any confirmation on this?  i had made posts and asked jmods about this before and got a brick wall for an answer, i’m pretty sure it doesn’t work?
---
1. Abyssal accumulator (All laws, natures, bloods, etc it saves is important to me)
---
2. Hardcore harvester (3x resources gathered and 1min farm ticks is like heaven to me)
---
3. Way of the warrior (They all seemed fine, but I enjoy combat the least, so I want to speed it up)
---
4. Konar's blessing (No slayer helm access, so that accuracy bonus is amazing)
---
5. Xeric's resilience (Prayer regen! I mean sure, prayer pots, but passive prayer regen lol.)
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Is it a world map?
---
Crystal bow long range is not longer range than its rapid cos its already max range
---
For sure.
---
if you want to do that remove the website from the comic.
---
Yes that would be a perfect idea. Just make them statless and perkless
---
im shocked. SHOCKED. to learn /r/2007scape is defending a nazi.... wait no im not...
---
Shit, I just flip shit on the GE and pull down 500k-2m a day. I don’t even have a ridiculous cash stack either, just like 20-30m usually

I’m glad I’m not alone in this opinion. As I was scrolling the images I was thinking *please be original rune style please me original rune sty— YESSSSS* option C
---
frick your speed is so high
---
I like the low level tasks more then i like sand crabs or something....
---
Yeah I remember the orders arriving and I was flicking through it in the car on the way home only to find that I already knew everything.
---
Right. But that point is irrelevant. Just like in the live game from 07, in the early days of OSRS not as many players had done heroes quest &amp; there wasn’t a fountain of rune
---
I recently made a UIM account and things like this bothers me like never before on that kind of account. Like why can't I cook trouts from the lumbridge river on the fire that the goblins got in their little cottage.
---
That's fair, the thing is, the other gold/item sink skills have an actual purpose, firemaking simply had no use in the game, which is why they brought wintertodt out.
---
y y y y y yikes
---
Is this only for twisted league?
---
For me what makes it feel not quite right is how the environment is how you know what house you're in, not the buildings. The map is practically color coded. It makes sense for some of them, but why's the ground blue for arceus other than to show it's a magical house?
---
What was your offense then? Third party software like AHK is a 2 day ban for first offense, not a perm.
---
Slap slap mfs
---
Yeah, I guess once you’ve built up a stack it would be tolerable.
---
Got it at 35 million, don't give up!
---
The PSA is for twisted league yeh but could be used in main game. Ive never done ironman so idk how useful it is
---
fucking rip
---
Was just curious, had no idea strange fruit were even obtainable outside of the random event
---
Haha, yes so PC! We are on the right side of history :]
---
Oh that's right. I always forget that stuff like the dagger need a quest to equip.
---
I love all these Woox clips, such a genuine and wholesome guy
---
No, part of the restriction is not having access to most capes
---
endurance, unnatural selection, artisan, konar, xeric's focus
---
Fool you are to perish by Zamorak, attempting to garner favor by this “quest” is laughable.
---
Your compatriots are running near infinitely. Meanwhile you show us this paltry display? 
---
Zaros would destroy you.
---
Excuse me?
---
30k and we have a deal

Consistent self improvement and always appearing on stream with a well kept appearance can say a lot about a person's character.

Ahh... thanks for keeping up to date with these memes.
---
The world I was in had people queing and others calling out when one opened. It was nice to see.
---
konar sells leaf bladed spears
---
Gee it's almost like they didn't know about it until someone found it, that someone being a turbo-sperg who plays enough to find shit like that. Are they supposed to just keep in every exploit that people find just because it's "unfair" to the people who didn't get to abuse it? Because that's not how you maintain a game.
---
You know what's going to be nice later on? Not getting metal &amp; brutal dragons! #SelectionGang
---
No, his comics are not great.
---
Yeah but it's two-handed and can't be poisoned.
---
infinite run, choose your own slayer tasks/contracts, 2x artisan exp, damage buff, attack speed buff
---
Proof? I don't follow everything on OSRS super closely. I remember that being a change that was very clear it was going to be polled. This is a change they're just saying is going to happen, and everyone seems to be moving forward as if it's going to happen. I also see no reason why it needs to be polled (except maybe the whole forcing people to make new accs to play it...).
---
what if youre barely going anywhere, im 17 agility and never really run out of energy except on clue scrolls and when getting a new slayer task
---
Alright. Am at work. Iron is just missing Eyes of Glouphrie - will post after work.

#DarkAltarGang
---
I got mine by prayer flicking
---
I mean yeah I'll drop in on bankstanding and fishing convos if I have something to say but most of the time my screen is as minimized as possible so I can watch vids or streams on the same screen.
---
But thats the problem isnt it... Most of us are trying to be efficient and get gains, and having fun interactions with others is one of the least efficient things you can do. That might sound autistic as fuck but to that I say welcome to osrs
---
You can read. I hope.
---
Nope they wont do ahit about it bud. Had my main jacked 2 times 1st for a few mill and this time a bit over 600m just gotta move on sadly.
---
I regretted Harvester yesterday as I picked it before my barbarian fishing grind for 60 agility. Huge mistake, but I finished the grind today and it's already back to being the best choice in my heart.
---
Wasn't this only in RS3?
---
where have you been ofc they have
---
And someone to give out collection logs would be cool too
---
Thanks for the recommendation, I went ahead and listened to you. Went from 1-40 ranged already!
---
They're pretty surface level and boring tbh. It's all just boomer humour
---
Only way would be to clean herbs and that is really click intensive with mediocre exp gains.
---
Talismans in the beginner clues is huge for low level btw's. I like a lot of these proposals.
---
You may find it hilarious, but a lot of us don't find casual anti-semitism funny.
---
You look awkward as fuck when half way through you realise it weren’t funny
---
So 1460 hours of playtime to max 23 skills?
---
That requires you to average over 200k xp an hour.
---
Ups mb. Corrected my previous comment, thanks for correction
---
If you could cook on this fire making would even be more useless.
---
Why even say that? It was a reasonable question and everyone is pretty certain you're just backpedaling.
---
25 golden gnomes for 25 buttholes. if you know what I mean ;)
---
literally shaking right now
---
Regardless of there being a humor tag some peoe would take it seriously. Their response was to the people who would take it seriously and not as a joke, obviously.
---
Hello, this is your friendly 2100-ish total iron with a nearly full bank constantly. :p
---
I can confirm the law runes, though. I have 21k and I've only done 600~ zulrah kills.
---
But if all the good task are over crowded then they won't be good tasks, and only ones with unnatural selection will be able to not choose them
---
Look at this next Twisted League they're sticking Us in the F2P
---
Pub west of pisc

Go use that endurance to run to the altar, while ill be chillin with 7 different prayers on in the catacombs while taking a shit #darkaltargang

You are forgetting something - this isn't the main game, this is an area restricted challenge where the simple stuff is supposed to be harder.

better get to smithing

I mean they are, but there definitely is more things to worry about.
---
i love you tysm there was no info on google/wiki about it at all
---
Certain groups have google alerts enabled to key words. so when a political topic comes up anywhere on the internet they get a notification and then pounce. I think the osrs community appreciates it without getting political lol.
---
What's better dps
---
Mith scim or a battlestaff
---
&gt; Take a look at fucking Priffdinas and count all the unpolled additions. Best place to pick flax and collect buckets of sand, best place to chop teaks/mahogany logs and turn them into planks, a store that stocks 250 cosmic runes when previously the best store sold 20 and required going through deep wilderness. It's bullshit catering to (ultimate) ironmen, plain and simple.
---
Let's go through these one by one.
---
&gt;Best place to pick flax
---
If you pick flax you're already making a mistake. Bowstrings are inefficient, and even if they were, Zulrah shits out more flax than you could ever want. If you can do SOTE, you can probably do Zulrah.
---
&gt;Best place to collect buckets of sand
---
Sandstone grinder. You could argue that shouldn't have been added either, and I would disagree with you, but the point is that the sand pit wasn't an "unpolled update that became the best method", since the best method was a polled sandstone grinder. And then for UIM it's still charter ship anyways.
---
I mean shit, I think it'd still just be charter ships for normal irons if grinder wasn't a thing.
---
&gt;Best place to make planks
---
Ape Atoll and Digsite are similar if not better. And the most efficient is, again, not priff - It's 0-time mahogany/teak from kingdom and pvm drops, then butler in poh.
---
&gt;Store
---
yeah ok fair enough for that one, although they weren't that hard to get before either, just a couple hours of runecrafting
---
Do you even play ironman?
---
WHAT THE FUCK
---
Sorry, I thought you were commenting on the xp waste aspect of leagues. My bad.
---
not the fastest. artifacts are faster by a lot
---
I believe they changed some shop stocks for the league, the fruit stall lady normally just sells fruit, no?
---
Hahahahaha brilliant
---
Leveling becomes faster as a member, the harvesting skills are the only ones that really don't until you're level 60+
---
(D pickaxe, d axe, better Barb fly fishing)
---
...this is woodcutting for farming pet recolor.
---
Yes, because I don't understand why he said what he said.
---
Goddamn Jagflex dude, I can’t do this no more.
---
Tell that to my wife
---
Barraging is enough to get 99 by the time you're 99 slayer, with the source being that I've done just that on my iron (94 slayer, 99 magic).
---
You do alch a bit, especially on iron, but the point is more that I wouldn't go out of my way to alch. Alching things as they drop (gargoyles) is another story.
---
Yes please. I played at least 16 hours on the first day, wish I knew how much I’m at now.
---
It's 2014, my friend.
---
It should yes, but it isn't.  
---
If you really want to get a ton of fossils though, drift net fishing or wyverns.
---
That is T5, yeah, so you'd be at 300k-ish at T5.
---
I wonder if there's a big right now
---
low hp and endless endurance i've never eaten a single piece of food
---
hp level/warm pieces?
---
at 12 hp i used a cake per kill for the first few until ~65fm and nothing since then
---
I do plan on doing 200m FM, but I'm honestly debating on just picking Dinh's at this point. Keep in mind you'd have to stay low hp for the regen to matter, so unless you want to save 200m fm until you have Xeric's Wisdom, the regen won't matter.
---
When civilisation is completely destroyed in 1500 years and is rebuilt down the line; someone will find this video and start a new religion.
---
Doesn't matter. There is a good chance this will get changed in today's world of perpetual outrage.
---
It's called "get scammed" day lol.
---
Maybe, I mean ~ it's really kind of unused content so it could've been messed up and no one would really notice/not enough concern to fix right away.
---
He's referring to twisted league I'm assuming, you can't just buy addy
---
Honestly my favorite world.
---
Most of the regulars are pretty chill, you get a solid mix of mid-high level players, and the GE is active(which is nice for total worlds) without tons of spamming bots/scammers.
---
It just says loading but doesn't do anything and when I try to switch before I log in it says loading for a second and then goes back to tap to switch but doesnt fo anything
---
1 warm piece, 10 hp. I still use food at 97 fm but it's more like 1 cake per 2-3 kills, and I occasionally take unnecessary damage (afking and getting hit by the brazier explosion)
---
Very easy points! And happy cake day!
---
I thought it was the dark altar that halved prayer drain?
---
Bloody awesome dude. One of my favourites personally, reminds me of my child hood.
---
I know it’s on topic to shit on Jagex but I think even the most rudimentary of companies would do this if it was a plausible. The reality is more likely that the effort going into ensuring someone is 99% botting far outweighs the effort a single person can expend.
---
Also don’t think you’ve got your head round the scale of the operation in terms of numbers of bots. There are probably 3-5k bots on at any one time, by the time you’ve swept a world up and moved onto the next the bot farm’s already making replacement accounts.
---
Yeah I’m trying to do some quests but I feel the game is kinda slow and a bit of a drag currently. Any general pointers on where to explore or where I should be heading. I acknowledge I am very much a big noob.
---
what the fuck
---
Or maybe if you just wanna enjoy the game like a normal person
---
I’m struggling to find the goal of the game. I don’t know where to sell, where to go, what to do, what to kill, what to get, how they get stuff. I basically just can’t figure out where to go with this game but I want to enjoy it.
---
Lost all his tegridy
---
40 hp
---
You could get started with something like 50 atk, 70+ str/range/mage (mage if you want to nh or rush etc) and slowly build up from that
---
I suggest checking out mintmadcow’s baby nh pure vid as itll guide you through starting the acc with the best route (quests for xp boosts) gl!
---
That is a terrible idea. What you’re asking for would require just as much dev time as a regular skill drop with the potential for it to just be rejected, all while ruining a popular new game mode
---
I figured it out. Took me a bit but I got it haha thanks
---
mom said it was my turn to post this
---
If it makes you feel any better, I don't get the joke and I still downvoted you.
---
Well, if you get Robinhood now you can leverage that over 250x and it’ll still be within your risk tolerance. Just ask the guys at r/WSB
---
Oh and since its a BH pure then it might be best to either keep 1 pray or get 13 max
---
Abyssal accumulator is a noob trap
---
Most bots are quick to get back up and running. Also there is gold farmefs farm that aren't botting, but actually playing to sell the gold. Jagex is doing quite a good job already, i just hope they can do better!
---
Xeric's Focus. You can see it in his game at the bottom left.
---
yes, jagex released an official statement that runelite is currently in full compliance with their rules. 
---
so nothing pn runelite carries any risk of ban. 
---
i mean false bans are always possible but u get my point, nothing you can do w runelite is breaking the rules.
---
Probably not, he's rather introverted
---
#he
---
Except my username ofc
---
Well, you could always safespot the head guards, until they drop one. I was thinking of doing that with some knives.
---
People think picking endurance is all fun and games until you gotta manually bury those bones
---
Litteraly
---
My apologies, I understand now a month later what you meant LOL
---
Herb isnt slow? You can get like 200k/ hour with potions. 
---
And tithe farm + anything else can be over 100k, so not horrible. Slayer and runecraft would be the slowest definitely. The hard part is I dont know of any runecrafting altars in zeah besides crafting blood and soul, which is level 77 dependent. So y we yeah
---
Downvotes don’t matter and don’t do shit... if you think this is nearly as good as what he usually produces then you’re delusional
---
In addition to what other people said he literally said himself that he is a nazi. He also used to have a different comic where he was even more anti semitic and so on.
---
I appreciate this.
---
i'm not doing other skills, that's the point
---
1/512 chance seems like it'd take a lot longer to get than other methods, good ranging xp tho I guess.
---
This editing looks like it came out of a 2006 runescape music video. None of this shit looks difficult to make - I could literally make this level of video. I have never thought that before about any of his previous edits; it’s bad.
---
I think that’s projection; that doesn’t seem like Woox’s scene.
---
You know how much money you can make doing herbs and battlestaves? Zulrah is what per kill with a pool. 80k per kill? Vorkath a little more? You can make a bond in a day easy with just those.
---
Wanna know too
---
❤️ Yeah it was my bad.
