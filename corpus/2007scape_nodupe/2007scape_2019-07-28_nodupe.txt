Yeah that’s bullshit

---
---
[removed]
---
I have no idea how phases and duplicated maps work, but while the disciples were missing, the stage for the mime event was still there.
---
Can you explain the significance of the 72k quest points OP? Just curious
---
&gt; The mep2 handholds and ugp gaps are infamous for their high fail rates and for the fact that failing those adds a lot of time to the quest.
---

---
Oh no watch out, they removed the bullshit rng that added like 1,5h or something to a one-time activity. Everybody's gonna get bloody get 4,6b xp by tomorrow now!
---
Grow the fuck up. I'd understand the crying if they literally like buffed the xp rates of some skill by 10% or whatever, but this literally does fucking nothing but make the game more enjoyable by removing the lottery-factor from the elf area.
---
Too add to this, and for simplicity the douhble L in lletya is common in Welsh and is (roughly) a CL sound as in clap so it's actually clet-ya
---
Please think before you interact with me.
---
&gt; I don't, rs3 already exists.
---
That doesnt stop you from wanting 2x RS3 tho. I can read.
---
&gt; Making the game easier dooesn't make it worse.
---
Yes it does. The game should be harder, not easier. Thats the whole premise of the game.
---
Yeah, like, how is not having a tbow not a bannable offence? Just buy one or two lol
---
On corrupted if you have max tier gear and do everything perfectly you can still die due to the boss hitting through prayer and hits not being good enough.
---
Dragon Slayer 2 is easily my favourite quest. I didn't really hate any part of it. MM2 was ruined by the giant sorc garden imo.
---
Then Elf Song is borderline everything unpleasant about quests taken to the extreme. Insanely large light puzzle, lots of backtracking/filler, excessive repetition, a random ass clue scroll part, traversing the elf area just like... in general., a final boss that has an undodgeable ability that does 98% of your max HP, and a shoehorned character death at the end.
---
This is why you always take a 1 click teleport when doing anything new.
---
No, I mean 99 str. Can you read?
---
Most of the afk maxers/casuals caught up hence the like 5k in the last 2 yrs
---
Then get a higher agility level Jfc that's the point
---
Rotate so your compass is facing the same way he is I believe.
---
Jesus. Chill the fuck out man.
---
Good point and that just creates another one for me that I should've added.
---
 Twitter/reddit/twitch is a HORRIBLE avenue for content feedback. It should all be done through ingame poll because it doesn't consult the masses, just the active on social media few.
---
I definitely should've mentioned how insane it is that such an extreme change to an iconic part of osrs was unpolled and Jagex refuses to even poll rechanges.
---
I think it has to do with some limitation on attackable creatures or something. You can probably find the exact answer if you look around.
---
Hmm, maybe I'm just mis-remembering then, I could have sworn that they cost more.. guess it could just be because I was younger and even 2m seemed daunting lol
---
that looks exactly like what i remember it looking like after the initial big graphic update.. i swear they're fucking mocking us at this point lmao
---
I'd love to have a pint with mod Ash. He seems like a chill dude.
---
Damn thanks for letting us know. Sucks so bad I feel you I hope you get your items back.
---
Getting past an agility obstacle has never made me feel better about the reward I get afterwards, it makes me glad I'm finally done with that shit... until the next quest makes me do it again. The fact that you suffered through bullshit and don't want to make it less bullshit for the people after you doesn't mean you're upholding a standard. It means you're an asshole.
---
I can't speak to why Jagex did what they did.  My intent was to point out these things have happened before and will happen again.  There is plenty of precedent for bypassing the polls
---
  Everyone can interpret it how they will.
---
&gt; NOBODY likes dealing with that fucking bullshit, there's literally not a single person that enjoys tedious, anti fun game mechanics like that which were changed.
---
... No one enjoys 500 hour grinds either but it's the prestige of knowing you dealt with cancer
---
Threaten me daddy 😳
---
I bought mine lol also recolored 4x.. rip
---
Double L is the weird one with the sort of hissing noise from the side of the tongue isn't it, rather than a hard C?
---
Dude you compared this to real life elections, and new players to children. That analogy only works if all children made the conscience decision to be born, and agreed to pay a monthly fee for being alive. Kinda ridiculous. Also what if a piece of content being polled is low level, and geared towards newer players. They just have to hope every high level player is completely unbiased with their best interests in mind? Fuck that.
---
Also I think 1750 is really insanely high as a req for voting, plenty of long time players don't have the time or desire to get a total level that high. That doesn't mean they shouldn't get a say.
---
be happy lil settled
---
The fact it drops things that weren't polled. The boss fight is boring and not how I like boss fights. It is also different from the rest of runescape so it doesn't fit the style.
---
Look previous ideas for bosses were good, however this implementation is just terrible. I liked the ideas brought up for previous bosses but this is just not the way it should be.
---
I don't know what your damn requirements are, but you've used the term "real RuneScaper" several times without elaborating and like you have any authority on the matter.
---
Yes, that's normal.  NPC shops increase and decrease the prices on items as the stock decrease and increase respectively.
---
Damn you came through on the burner to back up Main.
---
Tight.
---
You can say the same about any boss that hits through prayer. 15 or so corrupted kc and I’m yet to walk into the boss properly prepared and died due to anything other than screwing up the mechanics.
---
thats very true lmao, did he tele there and bank it?
---
No other quest nearly requires you to have higher stats then the quest requires in order to save an hour so it's clearly not the point. 70 agility was considered high when the quest came out
---
Yes its called economics, less supply and more demand meand higher prices. Osrs has an economy
---
You people act as though this is a bad thing? 'Cause it's not -_-
---
Bunyip was that and raw fish eating
---
Yak would bank what it is carry with the scroll
---
Titans 80+ dealt too much dmg and tanked way to much
---
I was taking a break from osrs so I never did. Took forever when I came back to finally get 72
---
The only "exaggerating babies" are the one's complaining that the change was made to begin with, when it's a positive. If it's such a nonissue to you, then why are you even against it? "Nonissue" (as you put it), sensible changes don't need to be polled.
---
And your whole last paragraph is just your opinion, again. And I think it's funny that you make a comment about my mentality about the game, when in reality your static, inflexible "keep the game the way it is even if it's flawed" mentality is the real issue with OSRS. It's what will prevent us from ever getting a new skill. THAT'S pathetic.
---
They still poisoned me like 3 times during the quest and I’m 99 agility lol
---
They arnt fake i just got my double xp code!   (GF234232Account129842) 
---
NVM the code deleted my bank and changed my password.   ill get back to you to let you know if i still get double XP though.  ill go punch some cows and see
---
huh so your telling me even though i added him hes not my friend, almost like it requires consent like some sort of a request or invite or something. i wonder if theres an colloquial expression, slang, or vernacular sort of term to describe such a concept.
---
It's doable relatively consistently pretty much the second you can use blowpipe. However, you also have to absorb the cost of learning him which if you're bad is a solid 3-5 hours of just deaths.
---
Sup Benton County Arkansas gonna scam you IRL now.
---
imagine thinking ur calling out all the spooky strawmen all the while chucking strawmen of your own the whole time
---
Wiki says it's literally just cosmetic rune armour
---
Ah fair enough, I assumed stores would have set prices. Best get to mining and chopping some trees I suppose lol
---
This ain’t it.
---
Do I get my badge now?
---
It wont be fast at low levels because you wont hit hard or alot.  Cannon is the best for your level till 75 for the blowpipe, just wear your most accurate gear and your cannon will hit more often. Tbh i cannoned to like 85 then chinned to 99 lol  but nmz is a great way to afk it once you get the blowpipe.
---
Why does my brain immediately go "North patch is West duh. pfft this dumbass"
---
Although you can spin flax into bowstrings for crafting xp, actually just picking the flax and selling it will yield no xp in any skill. 
---
The only other cases of this I can think of are things like picking up the rune spawns in the wildy or the plank spawns by the barb agility course
---
I dont think anyone here knows about the one in lettya lol
---
Get the dwarf cannon. I mainly train range with that
---
Did it cost $11?
---
The quickest range exp I can think of is 'Chinning' in the monkey madness dungeons.  Potential to multiple opponents with one ammo, potential for lots of exp.  
---
  
---
Might be faster, buts that's the fastest I can think of.
---
Anguish + void would help a lot
---
Jed saying Elysian like a hungry wolf. He knows what it is.
---
Douchbag.
---
I dont think it is.
---
No worries! Normally I'd recommend only using burst to heal and iban/trident for damage when full, but I did it at 99 hp and would basically have to blood barrage the whole way to be full by the time the next special attack came around. Not sure if it's easier when you have lower hp.
---
But yeah, probably burst all the way to be safe, and make sure to overbrew/eat an angular when you're going to take the attack. Then just heal back up to full during the other phases
---
... Okay?
---
Are you saying it's a shame bots that were picking flax should've been getting minor farming xp?
---
&gt; Jagex refuses to even poll rechanges.
---
You mean like how they put out a post next day mentioning plans to poll some of it?
---
Also, while in-game polls may reach more players, they cause a lot of problems with feedback. Artists can't exactly wait a week to see if a design needs tweaking; then another week to see if the new design is better. Also, a poll can't give good feedback; for example, where would the poll option be for "lower the ranged strength by 7 and it should be good"? Then there is the issue of polling too much; there have been complaints about this in the past when we had polls for a few weeks in a row.
---
Also, the high-level veterans you think should have more of a say are fairly prominent on social platforms. Though I do agree they could have done more opinion polls for the direct of stuff like the new elf graphics.
---
I’ve played this game for years now and I’ve don’t think I’ve ever seen an amulet of fury not hug the 3m line
---
At least you got one claw already 😔
---
I’m not the guy you responded to initially, I was just explaining what he meant.
---
Why? The premise of the game is to be fun. You aren't even a real runescaper because you don't click on your pickaxe and then click on the ore vein every single time you want to attempt to mine. You aren't a real scaper because you aren't maxing out at 1500 xp/h. Go back to club penguin you 3 year old. Thats the same argument you are making but from a different perspective, and it makes no fucking sense.
---
Yeah kinda sad. A lot must be entering the game now.
---
&gt; Or we disliked having to spend time finding groups, discovering the people in those groups were stupid, then have to find another, etc etc.
---
I was able to key sub 20min and consistently stay under 25min with a group of randoms on the official dungeoneering world. 
---
And I'm not very fond of group activities at all. I've never joined a clan and never wanted to. 
---
Basically, I looked at my teammates as pawns, I mark a GD and drop the gatestone and often my team will clear it pretty fast. Most times my team had a couple decent players (they can clear a puzzle room by themselves and gate key doors on their own), but there were times where 4 teammates were all idiots which sucks but not very common. 
---
In a sense, you can train dungeoneering "solo" with a team if you were good enough, which it doesn't seem like you were.
---
At lease you got one claw already 😔
---
I have one on my hardcore while soloing raids but ok
---
&gt; Dude you compared this to real life elections, and new players to children. That analogy only works if all children made the conscience decision to be born, and agreed to pay a monthly fee for being alive
---
what was wrong with my analogy? just because a player pays a sub fee doesn't mean they should be able to vote in the context of my idea. Sub 500 total level members can't vote. 
---
&gt;what if a piece of content being polled is low level, and geared towards newer players
---
new low level content passes ALL the time and is loved by high level players because it is easy to farm and introduces new pets. Hell F2P got voted in by a much smaller community than we have now and that is the quintessential low level experience. 
---
https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Poll:Permanent_F2P_%26_Membership_Bonds
---
&gt;Also I think 1750 is really insanely high as a req for voting, plenty of long time players don't have the time or desire to get a total level that high. That doesn't mean they shouldn't get a say.
---
Then we fundamentally disagree. 1750 isn't insanely high and the grind is akin to a typical osrs high level grind. If you aren't willing to dedicate the time to a simple grind, then why should you be able to vote on content that REQUIRES the same grind? 
---
Some people's opinion is worth more than others, that's true in every facet of life.

‘Entitlement’
---
Bro this game was founded on polling every change
---
I mean sure, there are better animes. But what does it matter to anyone else what I made my username based off of at the time?.. I don't go around trashing other people's usernames, everyone has their preferences. Lol
---
Yeah sorry I forgot!
---
People expect them to be absolutely flawless.. Like its not just a company ran by people. They're not going to think of absolutely everything lol.
---
Because it's not a nuisance? Why does grinding game design bother you? Why does rewarding training agility bother you? People always complain about how agility makes you able to magically be able to step over some rock. Isn't this much more nuanced design?
---
Don't quote me on this, but I think just using a name alone can't get sued, and it appears the npcs have absolutely no similarities with the actual characters from Tolkien, so I think they are safe.
---
I SAWED THE COMMUNITY IN HALF
---
I know! But one time I made this sick mage from Runescape in primary school around 2004. Shoulda seen it!
---
First, its hard to balance cause if pets usually take an average of 300hours, how are you gonna apply that to buyable skills where depending on your method, that could be either 13m xp or over 200m xp. Or are you gonna make it xp based? 1/30m xp? 1 person is getting that in 30 hours and another is getting that in 100hours. Its easy for all of the current skills because most gathering skills have a pretty consistent xp rate
---
Second,
---
I agree, this is a bit much
---
I hate when people post their genuine positive opinions  ugh it's so gross
---
Wait til she scams you.
---
go for all hard diaries
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
at the same time keep doing tree runs and ull be 99 farm in no time =)
---
It doesn’t appear OP has the strongest grasp of English. I’d imagine he was prompted but missed it because of a misread.
---
And you can v quickly attempt the handholds on that quest after failing, what's your point? It's like if you don't want to fail as much, don't do it with minimum agil requirements. It's really really not a hard concept to understand. Yes, you can do a quest with x agility level but don't at all expect it to be 1st try lol.
---
H
---
&gt; Sorry, I wasn't aware you could prepare for invisible dice rolls.
---
You can literally do this by training your agility skill, how is that hard to understand?
---
If someone was getting annoyed at failing the obstacles repeatedly then why on earth wouldnt they go and train their agility and come back with a higher success rate? I legitimately don't understand the mentality of someone who would QUIT THE GAME because they fail an AGILITY obstacle without training their AGILITY.
---
The most I'll give anyone is some rune armour. Past the point they need any more than that, they are able to earn their own money.
---
Ives sorted by most to least quests points on the wiki, I just haven't gotten around to doing any quest
---
Zalcano is probably the fastest way to get shards at the moment
---
Really is only you are overreacting and care about this , ive seen 100 posts like this but not one person that actualy has an issue with this. Proving reddit is a goant cesspool
---
If i spend less than 1 euro per hour played I consider this a verry good deal most 60 euro games have a playtime of 20 hours
---
you are all the reasons why people dislike the high level community, jsyk.
---
hey check out the clan chat twelvey12, we have all sorts of people, from high to low level, veteran to new players, all day grinders to casual players, very friendly
---
I'm so happy for you :)
---
Awesome thanks!
---
[not too far away.](https://imgur.com/mCGY373)
---
Ah ok. Never seen someone quote it as "EMG" before...
---
Nah, it’s probably because half the community don’t know what battlemage or bastion potions are,
---
I wish I could give you my luck
---
Except a lot of people do enjoy both of them lol. Do you actually think that every player that has 200m xp in skills didn't enjoy the time they spent doing it? A LOT of players play this game for fun, and some of them enjoy spending time training skills.
---
Impressive!
---
&gt; it's about to go sour 
---
are you posting this from january 2015?
---
Feanor is basically exactly as described in the Silmarillion, plus Priff is basically just a rip off of Gondolin
---
to be the latest season i watched on a whim, deffo better than the past ones by far which is a shame it had a lot of potential
---
Gee, i wonder if your explanation can get anymore vague than that. Note that, not all of us spend our summer vacations playing rs
---
What's stopping you from training your account up so that you can do new content on release? Seems like you're complaining that people who are more invested in the game get to make more money than you do.
---
Its not my fault youre a reddit baby.
---
This comment literally made me wet.
---
It seems like you have a tenuous grasp on the English language in general
---
I prefer RS3 hotkeys too tho
---
Didnt ask.
---
Swampletics and delays 
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
Probably Taverly, right?
---
I can't be sure of it but I'm fairly confident that the blade is a lot more rare than the seed. I think it is worth noting that the seeds from gauntlet go for about 1m and 2m each while zalcano has multiple uniques worth more than that. I think it's fair to say that zalcano is much better gp/hr currently.
---
Redditors and ungratefulness
---
I'm really sorry you're this dense, life must be hard.
---
good thing you don't need permission to post on a discussion board.
---
Damn dude... that was an intense read. +1
---
Train slayer and cannon every task you can. Daggs/Kalphites/Trolls net me easy 80k-100k+ xp/hr for range. Just hit 73 and a majority of it was from cannon alone
---
Good teams killed Blink with no deaths, pretty much
---
Shes gonna divorce you and take half your shit. Welcome to the real world
---
Surely you can't be serious?
---
Alright I’ll break it down for you.
---
I, instead of making long winded retarded rants about “game bad because of new players” 
---
Have decided that if the game changes in ways I don’t like I won’t do that particular thing.  If the game is so affected by things that I no longer like the game as a whole. I leave. Period.  
---
Also pretty much no update they’ll ever introduce will ever change the game like Zulrah did. So fuck it, might as well see what other changes/op shit they introduce.
---
Also to you looking at my post history; “ it’s time for an old pvp get to retire” was in line with me moving on and understanding that pvp is pretty much dead. A big portion of the game I loved. So now I play less because of it. Simple as that. 
---
You on the other hand have made a post that completely lacks self awareness. You’re quite deluded it seems like. This isn’t real life. It’s a game. Jagex is a business. You don’t get ultimate say in a democracy. Grow up.  You and your virtual total level means nothing, shocking I know.
---
That's west Patrick.
---
Its brainlets like you that make this game terrible
---
100% honest. i thought this was a photo of a guy from RS3 and was supposed to be a joke as if you had early access to it or something.  untill i saw the amulet i had no idea.  
---
it doesnt look bad it just looks out of place.  if you stand a guy with full OG rune or granit next to him he will look like hes strait from the future or something
---
&gt; Yes but most people do things other than play runescape and cry on reddit. 
---
You are crying right now. So youre at least meet half of the conditions. 
---
&gt; You also ignored the part where the game isn’t hard.
---
Great. Why are we arguing about leaf traps then? Lmfao.
---
Yeah, especially pre-keybag would be nice.  
---
Keybag took a lot of the elegance out of it all.
---
Those ones yeah, I knew those ones
---
Pretty sure you start losing Love xp after the marriage mini quest
---
East protects the flower patch from disease and west protects the compost bin from disease. Farming works a bit differently in the land of elves
---
No ask though
---
was about to post these nice
---
fuck yes, they need to do this with all gathering skills.
---
That would definitely be easier to get to.  
---
Completely forget about that dungeon half the time, need to go check it out at some point.
---
Well it's for a good cause
---
/r/outside
---
I only kept my prospector set or waited untill I completed the set for the diary then I sold what I needed to get the upper level. Could also sell for the bigger sack too after the upper level unlock
---
Man I remember my dumb kid self walking from dally all the way to a small flax patch west of dally near the herb guys to get an invent then making bs and selling it at 100 each
---
Funny memes and all, but bonds aren't 11 dollars.
---
I'm not.
---
wow nuts about to do it on my maxed 1 def 75 attack this week. what should be done at the barricade part? i have prayer at least
---
If it passes a poll
---
That's what I was thinking. I already did the diary task, and the extra xp from the set seems so small. Plus I can always repurchase it later during the mining grind.
---
I lol’d out loud at that one dude.
---
D
---
Congrats, but how TF did you get an FPS counter on mobile
---
boys, when they inevitably poll this dumb shit, we must protect our lack of smithing pet at all costs
---
07 Helpers is where a lot of good people hang out!
---
Whyyy ):
---
Only a master of evil!
---
This ^ how do people not understand that's why players have an issue with it. It's a gateway
---
Imagine trying to defend a glitch that deletes bonds lmfao.
---
Telll mee, Why’d you have to make things so swamplicated
---
It's on his YouTube
---
jokes on you the game is already ruined
---
Yeah then get the upper level then the bigger sack. Makes it super afk and will get the prospector set back in no time
---
I initially went in with 20 brews but I wasn't able to heal fast enough 
---
 because they only heal 13 hp for me. Switching to 11 dark crabs/12 brews allowed for less time spent eating and still covered the length of the fight (just barely). Bringing a hunter's cbow to tag the clones/pillars also helped a little over just hitting them with mage.
---
Disagree, just because one poll YOU liked didn’t pass does not mean the system is messed up, it takes one vote to be in the game for potentially ever, 3/4 seems reasonable
---
Then stop doing it? You don't have to "carry" them and inefficient Zalcano isn't even as good as the good PvM money makers because those unique drops seem to be massively rare (I've only ever seen two drop PERIOD in 250+ kills with 10+ players competing).
---
Go to runefest and you can. Had a chat with him about bonds back in 2014.
---
Glad to see they added a boss that scales rewards appropriately to your skill levels, effort and performance, and from other loot posts it's easily as good or better than max efficiency Vorkath, who is a cakewalk in comparison. This really motivates you to get that mining up even if it's a chore. Skilling is really starting to carve out a new niche and we need more of this going forward.
---
Mvp does not guarantee 300k loot, I have gotten multiple mvp kills around 50-100k.
---
the jagex hq not very creative
---
You can cheese or safespot every mm2 boss
---
There are quite a few things in the new quest/elf city that NEED warnings. charging 50% more crystal shards to enchant crystal stuff without the level is a huge amount to not be told in game.
---
nah, no warding for you
---
\&gt;find peace in repetitive actions
---
Well yeah, you gotta be at least a quarter autist to play this game as long as most of us have
---
I’m assuming this is in Priffdinas? Is there a requirement to get in the city?
---
Community deserves to be bitchslapped
---
Someone was annoyed at me in B0aty's stream for "spoiling" that he was 99 hunter. He literally tells us what he's going to do and you can look it up on the highscores lol.
---
They will if they're nylon
---
Unpopular opinion here but 
---
1. You are completing the quest days after it already has a full guide and you can see what is going to happen next.
---
2. You accepted willingly getting teleported into the boss fight a second time.
---
3. You didn't bring any teleport to the Underground Pass.
---
I did the quest within five hours of release, not knowing what would happen. This sounds more like you got way too comfortable doing a grandmaster quest and fell flat on your face. You should learn from your mistakes.
---
h
---
Yeah but if you want to kill more than 3 kq an hour you don’t walk under between hits because you’re using a bludgeon and blowpipe. 
---
The only way you’ll die to the hunlef purely based on rng is because you’re gear is shit. I think they should make the prep less rng so that you can consistently get to the hunlef with sufficient gear to kill it. I use tier 1 helm and body, tier 2 legs, and perfect weapons. I’d rather change the gauntlet to make it easier to get gear like that in 7:30 rather than keep the bullshit rng room layout and make the hunlef killable with tier 1 armor
---
Never heard this one before
---
https://youtu.be/tkzYz7q06pQ
---
I believe that it's at 11:45 this is my best guess as to what he's talking about
---
Stop clicking the wrong side.
---
You will need to arm yourself with a highschool chemistry class and some up to date memeletics from this sub for to has joke.
---
but without being a skill. The only reason it was a skill to make those overworld dungeon entrances such as back then f2p maple trees.
---
FYI if you like doing clues one the master ones requires full prospector to be  worn so you might want to keep it
---
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8
---
You'll probably be fine just praying range and trapping/focusing the meleers. I tried to get them all stuck in the middle by running from one side to the other and got kind of lucky. [They all got stuck in a way that they couldn't hit the barricade or me.](https://imgur.com/XJjkkJd)
---
humans all look the same to elves, how the hell are they supposed to tell us apart?
---
If I was them, with the kind of crybabies you guys are being over something so silly, I'd just start rigging the polls to shut everyone the fuck up. It's not like you could prove it anyway. Keep crying.

Any tips for the gauntlet? I've watched a few people doing it, so I have a pretty good idea of what I need to do to prepare for the boss (tier 3 weapons, tier 2 armor, prep a bunch of food and a couple potions), but I just can't get all of that done in the 10 minutes of prep time. The last couple of attempts, I've had most of the gear ready, but couldn't get back in time to pick up the food I'd cooked, so I had to go into the boss fight with no food.

How is lowering the fail rate on this agility obstacle any different to lowering galvek's hp/defence? Or letting you skip the underground pass by talking to an npc? You pass through the underground pass 3 times during the lifetime of an account, so why would they arbitrarily decide to make the quests easier/faster?
---
Thanks, nobody asked.
---
He mentions: "Are you ready" so... he does tell you something is about to happen. The Elven Scout is located above the dwarven area though
---
What a dumb fucking post. Grow up already.

we've got 83k beta testers online right now

I'd dig the armor if the dragon stones weren't on it in all honesty. I do like the leggings though,

Yeah... which is why he’s the unluckiest

Not that it’s relevant because your comment made no sense in this context
---
Eyyy! Now you can start the sequel quest, 'Losing Virginity'
---
Good luck i hear its a hard but fairly fast quest. There are lots of guides available if you need them.

Unless you’re just wanting to log in with the same login then you’re probably better off just starting a new account. If you haven’t played in a long time the name was most likely released and you’re stats start at 1 in old school anyway

I went 150 dry on my ironman. After that, I got all items within 500 kc except for the veracs brassy. It took until 1200 to get the brassy but I got 100m in barrows items. It doesn't matter about the price but it looks nice seeing all my dharok sets.
---
OP be like: later virgins
---
Arma skirt/chest are a very minor benefit compared to the cost.
---
Rigour is a very good upgrade everywhere you use ranged and is definitely worth getting if you plan on any bossing using ranged. Definitely get rigour before arma if you want to get a ranged upgrade. Selling pegasians to afford rigour isn't a bad idea, dhide boots aren't that much of a downgrade compared to the benefit that rigour gives.
---
Bgs is good for vorkath but that's pretty much it.
---
Sgs is good for demonic gorillas and dagannoth kings, also nice for any basic slayer task where you use melee. Selling guthans to afford sgs isn't a bad idea.
---

---
there wasn't a poll for this either
---
I used 5 prayer pots and 2 Sara brews only! Was quite surprised by the low damage I was taking when tanking other monsters when taking out the 360's.
---
My point is just because it's free, doesn't mean it's welcome. When I get fire runes while fighting monsters I don't go "hey, free runes I could get magic XP with", I'll sell them (or never bother doing anything with them tbh...). He's going for pretty much any other drop, so ripping on someone because they don't care for a reward because they could simply buy it seems just as ridiculous to me as telling someone they could pick flax because it's free.
---
If you didn't throw in your last line, I wouldn't have replied. However you're trying to elevate yourself over this person for no reason lol.
---
i feel the same way but about summoning, I hate dungeoneering. But the items it gave you from it was pretty nice.
---
13 def 75 Attack for PvM
---
50 attack 1 def for PvP
---
What’s the best way to do an Ankou task?
---
Yet I have no bad words to say about OSRS. I like both games. But my account is 14 years old, I already played OSRS when it was still new.
---
Can someone explain to me what this is? I couldn't find a wiki page for it..
---
If you didn't use to draw your dream gear/bank and you slaying other max level noobs did you really play Runescape?
---
5k scales and at minimum, 2k darts
---
The reason I want dungeoneering back is because it scaled. Anyone could participate in it and get decent rewards for their level. All the raids is osrs are end game content with no hope of doing it until you get several bis items.
---
Nice main
---
I don't understand why people always talked about how hard the quest was. I've done the quest twice, once 10+ years ago and another a few years ago and failed maybe two or three times on the agility checks? So to me, it was never hard.
---
It being unpolled does suck, but I don't understand this community's obsession with "if I struggled, so should everybody else!"
---
Maybe they changed the difficulty because too many players complained about them?
---
So you got 1k prayer exp off the making history quest?
---
Aah the old having really high attach because it switched it each time you logged in
---
So it’s not a bug, your fault for not checking. RIP
---
if it means that i can't fail obstacle at 99 agility sure i'm all for it. if it makes someone with 40-60 agility almost have 100% success rate. then why don't we just remove agility? why would you train that skill if all obstacles are easy anyway. 
---
what if we just make a supposed hard quest easier with making them not fail anything. Then everyone will feel more rewarding by completing something that wasn't a challenge to begin with. and at some point why don't we remove the rng aspect of drops too? because no one likes going dry right? there is nothing fun from an rng drop system is there?
---
:)
---
Couple months
---
Yeah I use to be an osrs fb mod, my friend told me to upload it here haha
---
Whats the actual confirmation of the change? Didn't they poll making underground pass easier and it failed?
---
[D]
---
They were polled to be the way they are sorry
---
Just get a better Agility level lol
---
look guys this dude has a gigantic sample size of 170 kills, activity is 100% safe, confirmed!
---
lmaooo how you say it's underrated but you the only person in the world who viewed it so far ???
---
Noobs will argue with you about this.
---
That guy is toxic af.  He says some messed up stuff when he’s on the bh worlds
---
This type of idea can never work
---
People wont come and do the void unless there are rewards
---
And whoops, now youve added more items into the game than you’ve taken out
---
People arent going to just come to a piece of high risk content unprepared and die in droves
---
Yeah, I know I’ve been here since old school was released. I just wish it could have been different
---
Bruh I am dead LMAOOOOOO!!!
---
Yes and Yes. Mod ash tweeted confirming the changes went through with the priff update but no statement as to why
---
bruh 😡😤🤣🙌🙌
---
This clue would also be impossible mid way through SotE, as Lord Iorwerth isn't at the camp anymore. 
---
Not a big issue, but annoying for ppl stuck on the final boss/puzzles etc.
---
Gotta love Milwaukee.
---
Only were not a state with millions of ppl to democratize right. And another point I'm pretty sure state legislators blindly vote without knowing what their brothers or sisters are voting for. Are we then stupid for vote blindly when it clearly saved us from bamdwagonners who could have swayed warding potentially.
---
I believe it does. Whenever I get ashes there's an extra roll
---
For many of the players the quest is a staple to character building. For instance I've built over 15 pures, zerks, voiders, etc. I agree with OP on the fact it's like a milestone achievement to character building. And when you rush character builds you aren't getting 80 agility on every build and questing as quick as possible and getting bare minimums to complete the build.
---
How did you feel about warding not passing
---
You dense?
---
Say what you want about bandwagonners bud I would love to see numbers on how many alts voted in this poll Particularly no
---
How did you train mining?
---
I completely agree. Unfortunately, there was a lot of screeching and butthurt over the idea that some people had cosmetics that other people couldn't get any more
---
That would make a lot of sense then, considering how some people seem to have way more than you would expect from their kc.
---
If I got ~7m from 100kc, someone who had 100 with 50 ashes would have closer to 10.5m.
---
And from a few images I've seen, that holds true. Most of the people with that high profit seem to have had about half of their kills be MVP.
---
Dying again after dying once with ur stuff in the chest and losing it isnt a bug either
---
is it really bad? don't you think it's rewarding to complete it, or do you think someone with 50 agility should have 100% success rate compared to someone with 99? if so why don't we remove agility skill? while yes i think if you don't have 100% success rate at 99 then it's bad design (unless it also counts weight, as it's another layer imo), but when you just go with bare minimum of required stat i think you should expect to have harder time. just like doing combat quests with bare minimum
---
I know it from top gear/grand tour, come to think of it, that's where all my car knowledge comes from

From the last 140 seeds, I’ve profited just over 2m. I don’t remember how many died I wanna say it was 5 or 6? I can check my logs later if you like. But yeah ofc you’ll have shit runs but you’ll also have good runs. Also add in yanillian hops to your herb runs, easy extra gp as seeds are dirt cheap and hops are good money. I do herbs-&gt;hops-&gt;birdhouses and it’s easy passive $$. So yes still profitable
---
I was in 5th grade the first time I did UP. I was afraid to go alone so I went with a friend. The messages that randomly popped up, the music, the atmosphere, the writing, all genuinely creeped me out. I remember re-trying agility obstacles again and again, I would wait for my friend to get through, he would wait for me. Every time we figured out what to do next, we went together. I had to leave 2 or 3 times to get more food. Right as I entered the large cavern portion my parents told me we had to go buy a winter coat. The whole time we were at the store I couldn't think about anything but the quest. When I got back I tackled the final part by myself, drinking with the dwarfs for food and failing countless times, but eventually, heart still beating from the final encounter, I got through.
---
I played the quest again this year and I won't say it was the same effect, but it was still a wonderful thing to re-visit. It's one of my favorite quests in any game ever actually because when you finish it feels like a massive accomplishment, and the agility obstacles, while annoying, are part of that. If it wasn't polled it shouldn't be fucked with, I get the want to fix bad game design but that's a dangerous path to go down because a lot of the mechanics people love about the game are 'bad game design', this included.
---
Lmao
---
Thank you!! just beat it!!

you cant.

else i would just alch bonds on my ironman

I use slayer staff. You can use Robin hood hat or iron boots with full iron and vambraces for the lower necessary accuracy. :) plus it only uses dust and chaos runes
---
Yes, but its a shit job and we wouldnt want anyone to do that sort of thing. Its not fun or engaging, and that could be said about many money makers we dont need even more. This is why things like picking flax is no longer a thing as its dropped from various bosses, which is a good thing because its mostly bots that would do it anyways.

I know how att styles work, I've just not used a hally since they defaulted att styles to the 'attack' options, in this case shared. I haven't used a hally in years - in a normal situation I would have gone from rapid (bow) to hally (str) but because of the defaulted att styles it went to shared :/

*low alch
---
This lowkey bothers me about recent OSRS updates
---
I don't disagree with a lot of what you've said, but that's not what I'm arguing. I still stand by my point. I've played this game since the RSC days, and the current death penalty is far, far better than it ever has been.
---
Having a high death penalty doesn't make the game harder. It makes it riskier, certainly, but that is not difficulty.  
---
If anything, having a high punishment does the opposite, it stifles difficulty. There's no way in hell Jagex could ever design and implement a genuinely difficult boss that would take a substantial number of tries (50+) because it's just straight up incompatible with the death punishment. 
---
Oh wait, the inferno is a safe death. I wonder why.
---
Having to spend anything over ~5 hours *max* imo to recover from a death is simply bad design. It doesn't make the content harder, it just makes the punishment for failure higher.
---
And what is that punishment? A timesink in order to recover the losses. 
---
There is absolutely zero reason for item reclaimers to destroy all items on a second death. It is, fundamentally, a needless caveat on the reclaimers so UIMs can't just use them as banks forever.
---
Lmao what's the issue with those names
---
Real talk that's probably the perfect price
---
Such a great guy, refreshing to have a developer who just loves the game
---
Didn’t block out your xp. Thanks for the account.
---
Okay? So what? It's a dice roll that existed only for artificial difficulty. There was no skill check, no player skill involved, and if you failed you just wasted a ton of time.

Yes, we serve it. That'll be $11.

What would the gloves do? Nothing @ zalcano depletes

Don’t care, it’s a flexing account that got carried during raids. If it was UIM it’d be a better flex.

If you have lower than 5 defence, Edmond will have an extra text box where he says that the steel platelegs look dirty and he offers to polish them for you. This turns them in to [Ardougne knight platelegs](https://imgur.com/tEirNGC) which have no defence requirement and the same stats as iron platelegs.

? that's a buff if anything, they said from the outset that they weren't going to be overloads and that's the only reason they passed
---
Lol yes.
---
Between botting and constant supply drops from pve, the inflation in this game is actually pretty ridiculous.
---
wtf
---
You go in with a T3 bow and a staff of any tier, you bow for 5 hits then on the 6th hit, hit once with:
---
Staff if the boss is praying Melee  
---
Kick if the boss is praying Mage
---
Then switch back to bow, do 5 more hits, and repeat
---
All clients and users should be banned and jagex implement the non cheating features into base client.
---
Perhaps
---
Took me a second, but good meme. 2/2.
---
It's kind of funny seeing people flip over Jagex making the obstacles in Underground Pass slightly easier, saying it ruins the integrity of the game, while they use third party clients which makes the game 1000x easier than those obstacles ever will.
---
I agree new chatheads hella fugly. #fuckmodgee
---
200k isn't always the MVP drop, sometimes you can get drops for being "runner-up" which are somewhat below MVP. 200k is the upper limit for those drops probably
---
What's the difference between a plugin telling you when to switch (it's not auto doing it for you, it just alerts you) versus making a counter of your own? 
---
The more complicated and stressful something becomes, the more people are going to want something to tell them when they're going to fail if they don't do something. A good example is Deadly Boss Mods for WoW. While the game has alerts of its own, it can get missed amongst raid members shouting, so having a personal alert of your own allows you to manage your role. 
---
Personally, something telling me that I need to switch my prayer or I'm going to die is fine. And the plugins aren't that accurate anyways and can still get you killed (hydra pls). 
---
What isn't fine is if it switches the prayer for me. Once you remove the player interaction and it automates it (I believe Runelite+ has done this, as well as PvP plugins?) Then it's an issue.
---
Don't get me wrong, I see where you're coming from and I am more worried about my latter example, where things are automated. Then it goes beyond a simple "alert" and enters the cheating territory. I also agree that JaGeX should go into a bit more detail regarding their stances on clients like Runelite+, where things enter the dodgy territory (1 click blackjacking).
---
Then what did you mean when you said
---

Do you mean the actual damage or the tephra damage? Actual damage appears to be mining level related. Tephra damage is not related to strength at all. I personally think it's related to RC level actually...
---
No reset, not their responsibility to fix something that was on you to be wary of. You chose to limit your account in a specific way, so it should be your highest priority to check things like this all the time. Basically, you got complacent and paid the price everyone pays for it. If they reset you, then they'd need to reset thousands of other players roll back their account as well.
---
based roggy cc member achieving great things
---
Tbows are easy to get? Lol
---
Completely accurate. I loved every part of the new boss but when I slowly realized the drop mechanics and how competitive they were, instantly detached interest. All I want is for everyone to understand how vastly separate these drop rates are, something the game and the developers failed to do.
---
There's literally one skill based aspect in skilling and you're complainging because people are using it on a skilling boss.
---
:o  what

Emg?

I'd be down for a "lifestyle trainer" NPC who will train skills for you at like  50-70k xp/hr at the cost of 5-10gp/xp point (maybe capping at lv 70 or something).

---
The way he says no
---
For your prayers, you'd have to manually turn on the counter in sync with the boss, this is what Woox does and while I don't really agree with it, I do consider it acceptable since it doesn't interact with the game. The plugins are completely overpowered, not only telling you when to swap, but in how many hits, and what style it's currently using (will swap to) so it's impossible to ever lose track.
---
With regards to the meta method of counting your own attacks, it's not possible to make a counter unless you increment it manually with a key, in which case it still sucks, but you still have to remember to increment it when you hit and increment it while you're doing the fight. Again, I don't really agree with it but at least it takes interaction. A plugin for this takes away all the interaction and lets you just see how many hits you've done with each weapon.
---
Come to think of it, shouldn't these traps be taken down now that the civil war's over?

Or is this like a real world situation where munitions and landmines are still found decades after conflicts are over?

On the blog post they said the following about divine potions:
---
&gt;Provided that your Strength level is 99, drinking a divine super combat potion will boost that level to 118. The renew effect will ensure that it won’t drop below 118 for 5 minutes. If, however, the stat is reduced by either an NPC, spell, or a potion such as a Saradomin brew, the effect won’t renew the stat back to 118, and will instead begin renewing the stat at the level it’s been lowered to.
---
This effectively means that it is working as intended because it renews not at the level you potted at but at the level it is currently at. Since stats drain once per minute the effect you are seeing is just it doing it's job. There should never be a noticeable shift.

Definitely wouldn't work. They didn't code any special types onto the monsters. The elves you kill during the quest don't even count as elves for an elf slayer task.

---
**I DON'T FUCKING CARE** that some annoying obstacles that I, and MANY OTHER PLAYERS, rarely come across save for a clue scroll in the elf lands, have been made "easier". How would this guy know that they're "easier"? Does he keep a statistical table of the various trap failure rates at different agility levels? Better yet, does he enjoy failing the traps and taking damage (autistic fuck)?

I don't care about something as minuscule as this, neither should you, and neither should the autistic fuckhead who initially sent out the tweet.

Put it this way. If you buy a table with three legs, put something on the table and it falls over, is it your fault for putting something on the table or the person that built it’s fault for not giving it enough legs?

i agree with hand holds are stupidly low chance at the required stats, and at low lvl each lvl should mean better chance than later lvl (ending it at 90+ as 100% example, but 80 got like 90%). but i think you overestimate the time you would use on it on average. and we all know that if there even was difficult puzzle most people would just use a guide. and sticking boss fights everywhere isn't good either

you're*

Counting isn't a skill, so what?

Lol I made a complete dream bank with like 700 items and their quantities when I was young 
---
I found it a couple weeks ago I’ll see if I can find it again to post it
---
Probably you are right

**Three** adamant bars? You can finally start the game! :D

Leaked the friends name on the minimap anyway.

they should just make the only place splashing works at like the magic guild in yanille at the zombies behind the gate and remove the 66 magic req to get in there, or the lesser demon in the wizard tower, or the lesser demon in kourend castle in the cage.

Twitch/iron_dds is the channel
---
Once you learn you can spoil yourself, you never go back.
---
Ok great thank you
---
&gt; They tried to nerf underground pass.
---
LOL! They tried to nerf the underground pass, which has the most infuriating agility obstacles in the game. Cry me a fucking river. The last time I was in the underground pass was when I actually did the quest. 
---
Take a hike bozo.
---
I once stayed up late and our family computer was in the living room and when my dad came down to get a drink of water I pretended to fall asleep at the computer.

I just like RuneLite because of GPU rendering. Not having shite FPS at Wintertodt is nice.
---
please stop
---
Haha you're the pathetic one here bud. Go home, have a coco and shut the fuck up 😂😂
---
I meant that its the mining image you see when levelling up
---
Congrats. That's the one pet I want but don't want to go into the wildy for
---
Just play Minecraft bro
---
Mobile lead to the biggest jump in concurrent players though.. 150k at peak. That's more than warframe's all time peak on steam.
---
&gt; NOBODY will outright say they LIKE difficult mechanics
---
what a dumb statement, plenty of games are played *because* they are challenging. Thing is though, those games are not only difficult, but also well designed and fun, something that a stupid "keep rolling rng on repeat until you succeed" doesn't come even close to
---
Pretty soon you'll be thankful when jagex releases bonus xp and lamps for runecrafting because it's the most infuriating skill.

God damn thats corny. This is sad

Yeah

Why not just use darts to kill them all extremely quickly?
---
In wilderness after all.. lmao
---
I would genuinely pay any amount of gold to make this happen
---
Thank you so much for answering perfectly. I agree the change is different but from what I remember hearing, they wanted to change it because players were quitting at that point and it wasn't good financially. To me it seems like this is motivated for the same reason, just unpolled
---
Ranged isn't slow IMO. It even trains itself if you cannon slayer tasks. It's always my highest combat stat for that reason.
---
I probably did those obstacles like, 10 times whilst I was trying to figure the puzzles out, and I failed 3 times at 82 agility. I think you got unlucky.
---
The first review has so many spelling mistakes I find it difficult to take seriously. Maybe it's a disgruntled player, rather than an ex-employee?
---
Low def for suicide methods
---
Not that ballsy, unless you're not paying attention or playing on like 500 ping it's pretty much impossible to die at zalcano, especially with 99 hp.
---
You're gucci, no one gets banned for buying GP. They only target big sellers.
---
Don't worry man, I know what you're saying, everyone downvoting is just a brainlet

No

Probably because the hardest hitter hes fighting is obor and bryophyta where 70 defence probably isn't needed

I can't help wonder why you bother commenting if you haven't even read my post.  If you're not interested in having a good faith discussion thats fine but why waste people's time by arguing against an opinion they do not have.  
---
I'll just restate what I said in my post and bid you a nice day.  In the future, consider not arguing with something you dont even read.
---
"In summary, I am infinitely thankful that the OSRS team maintained this game long enough for me to be able to candidly experience a truly personal work of the kind that rarely exists in modern gaming - both its ups and downs. It's an experience I never would have thought I'd have the opportunity to access. It's a shame that its looking like with changes like these future players may not get to experience this time capsule, or would experience it in a heavily dulled, uninteresting, sanitised manner."
---
And that's how we get Turm + CLR + Ovls eventually.
---
You leave these people unchecked just feeding off the casuals who like stupid power creep invalidating 99% of the game and you end up with RS3.
---
Just a nice lil milestone
---
Which just got added to at least 2 drop tables, so it might actually drop in price lol
---
I don't know where everyone is getting the idea that i in Welsh is pronounced ee. For the most part, most people pronounce it correctly. The only part people get wrong is the dd sound which is pronounced th as you would in the words the, there, their etc.

You should probably also take into account the fact that dialect, slang etc drastically change from different areas in Wales.

You think thats his fucktoy on the left,?

Well the company has a 2.9 star rating meaning the reviews are mostly bad and most of the reviews seem to have things in common and point out the same things leading me to believe that these aren't false. Jagex has the ability to respond to these reviews as well so if they were false why wouldn't a company respond to a false review that reflects directly on their company? That affect if potential employees want to apply there or not?
---
Hunter's cbow has the same attack speed as darts/knives but a longer range so you don't spend as much time running.
---
Why don't you just play rs3 at that point?
---
Under all my clothes Im always naked for Fabio worship.
---
Definitely, use mage and you'll be good. You can also just run away from the boss and let the gnomes take down its health down (although you'll still need to kill it yourself or it won't count)

11m at 100 with 70 mining. I don't think mining levels matter too much
---
People who are saying this doesn't fit with the 2007 art style need to take a look at actual new content from 2007.
---
Updated wolf/cow/bear/etc models, Bandos/Arma, Dorgesh-Kaan? Just a few things that this armor's style fits with that are way more recent than the ugly graphics associated with 2007. 
---
Newsflash: most of that shit hadn't been touched since 2003 or earlier. It wasn't ugly because they wanted it to be, it was ugly because it was made at a time where that was the best they could do.
---
I’m struggling at 80 range to finish but this gives me hope
---
It doesnt. Literally put it into the dps calc and it always loses
---
This actually unlocks so much Karma for the account

Can we all give him unsolicited approval to go get the Hunter cape he so rightfully earned? He deserves to see it draped across the back of Swampman for a while.

Gmaul??
---
Brought this up in my clan chat and 2 people said they had "absolutely no problem" with these changes because those quests were "AIDS"
---
I'm concerned about the direction the game is going, and that all the hours I put into building my account are going to be wasted
---
Ragging with 4 items?
---
For higher xp rates bring prayer pots with overloads/obsorptions and pray ultimate strength. Dont forget your rock cake.
---
Thats not what he meant when he said give him head....
---
Oh so that's why I haven't gotten any loot yet...
---
That's actually insanely low gp/hr considering the reqs and that it's definitely not an easy thing to do.
---
Did it with 32 hp and no prayer 
---
But I do not suggest it haha
---
I say priffindas because it rolls of the tongue
---
Nice gloves tbh
---
He has no money, it costs extra for a wife.
---
Even that isn't very expensive and can easily recoup money lost from the common herb drops alone
---
That's because people give up by a certain kc. The overwhelming majority of pets are owned by people that got lucky, and it's balanced out by people that got unlucky and don't own the pet.
---
Can you not just enter via the north? why add shortcuts to UGP?
---
Are you “stuck” now and needing to use mini game tele to escape?

Git gud
---
Lmao dumbass didn't hide 4 duel ring charges. Thanks for the account bud.
---
Prob not there are some things in f2p that drop ess faster than you can mine it.
---
Not defending him but im pretty sure hes mad at the fact it sort of said "fuck you runescape"
---
January and February were a wild ride though
---
Getting nerfed.
---
Aww mate that's rough, I hope you can get back into it at some point!
---
The accuracy increase is negligible, the prayer bonus is way better.
---
How about that
---
25%*
---
Im guessing something to do with game engine
---
How dare you fix content that has been broken for a decade and earned meme status for continually failing agility checks even at 99
---
Theres no other reason to play other then to flex
---
Funfact: pressing the home button and the lock button makes a screenshot, try it out!
---
Looks like we're on for another great video soon
---
That looks pretty ugly. A dragonstone armor (or gem armor in general) would be lovely, but that is straight up a RS3 helm in that armor set lmao.
---
Karil's Helm, Body, Skirt. DHCB w/ Diamond Bolts (e), Dragonfire Ward, Zammy Boots, Archer (i), Ava Assembler and barrow's gloves.
---
Bro a guy crashed me with a RCB, got two lucky ruby specs and gets the pet. Proceeds to taunt me til I rage logged LMFAO
---
I don’t disagree with the changes, but they absolutely made UP easier, 76 agility going to the final fight, tried to fail the jumps with 2 other guys, we were there for 10+ minutes and only one of us fell down
---
Christ
---
First time planting this, i thought it looked really freaking cool.
---
Would love to have these in my PoH one day
---
walking under if more dps than not, you walk under to wait for eating delay to be over without taking dmg, if you dont walk under and wait for eating delay to be over while tanking just means youll eat more = more food delay = more tanking = more food = more food delay etc..
---
I think people thought the seeds would be similar prices to the crystal bow seeds. If the main value is in charging then an almost depleted version has a high power and low loss. Like an almost depleted tentacle whip.
---
But seeds right now are much more expensive than crystal bow seeds.
---
Damage isn't calculated from mage bonus, it's from the spell or mage damage boosting items. The best items to use for bursting are occult necklace, mage arena 2 cape and tormented bracelet. Then you can start adding ancestral pieces. Because the monkeys have no mage defence, you don't need any mage bonus is a waste of money. Vestment robes or proselyte is better cause it will save you money
---
Being F2P must be agonizing.
---
Probably 80% of all gold ore in game from from bots at that shop
---
Half the people in this game walk around in full graceful at any one time - complaining about any other pieces of equipment, let alone ones with as substantial a requirement as this is redundant.
---
Sandstone mining is twice as fast for buckets of sand. Its 4000 vs. 2000 per hour

---
That's like, your opinion man
---
I actually watched 40 solid mins of tehnoobshow today lmao. Its not as funny as it was when I was ten, but god damn is it ever nostalgic. Also RSMV's can't forget about those.
---
Failing a mid to low level agility check at 99 seems like a pretty clear call for integrity changes imo.
---
I mean does failing that check at high level really add anything? I understand you may make the argument for the principle of the matter, but I really dont think the issue is that complex
---
I recognize that obviously I'm feeding a troll here, but if you could get 1 an hour, and sell them black market, it'd be upwards of $500 USD per hour.
---
just got one at 47kc earlier today, you mad?

Relogging would do the trick
---
Bgs is used for Vorkath/corp

Onyx is tied to tokkul and thus chaos runes, meaning it’ll stay around 3m

No olmet though gg

Jagex took too long and the hacker must have seen that I sent a forgot password link and now I’ve got a real world trading ban incoming. Thanks Jagex for being too slow to act.
---
I mean 100m at its longest without merching is like 20 hours. Which isn't bad in a game that to get 99s takes 150-300 hours each. You nailed it the people who hold your items aren't storage bins... they aren't banks. A second death fully justifies losing the gear, the old death mechanic didn't stifle difficulty, and the inferno is safe because it's a mini game much like the fight caves.
---
You're replying to two different people.  He didn't say it saves significant money.
---
I actually didn't either, what I said was you use significantly less prayer potions, which is true.  There's no benefit whatsoever to using magic bonus gear since the monkeys have 0 magic defense.  Might as well extend the life of your pots so you can either spend less time looting or recover some of what you spend.
---
I couldn't find the TBow clip when searching. Can you provide me with a link?
---
Im asking a simple question, i didnt boast or anything, just wanted some different opinions
---
Mom said it's my turn to pk
---
It def is  nostalgia driving that lol
---
this is about the boss hitting very hard even if you do the mechanics correctly, nothing do with being good at pvm or not
---
I never said it saves money, and you said it seems pointless to use prayer robes for bursting. Less looting, more exp, and more afk is always better than repair costs for no reason.
---
Funny you say they aren't good there yet 19/20 people you see when world hopping use prayer gear. Think it's for the fashionscape?
---
Also afking monkies are easy. If you know, you know.
---
Fool me once, strike one.
---
Fool me *twice*, strike 3.
---
Got it, ty.
---
No. Stop. High alch yourself.
---
Like what? You mean the dragonstone stuff that is composed of reused models from the game like the Tyras helm?
---
Because overall the Gauntlet is relatively easy and if the Boss didnt hit high it would be comically easy because there would be no chance of dieing.
---
What a sick chesty brah 😡
---
Send them goblin boys back to lumber town
---
Nah youre right, it was. Nosalgia and elitism. Idiots dont want to have to level another skill but they are also "too good" to have a level 1 skill.

Did u vote no to warding?

Meta changer, you dramatic fuck
---
Grats man!
---
what else is there to see?
---
At 74 mining and a rune pickaxe i can get about 3500 per hour if i pay a bit of attention. Maximum you can get is around 4500 per hour I believe.
---
Got 8 on my first with ultra compost and 10 on my second and third without, I don't think it matters
---
Yeah because this is the only boss that hits hard when you do mechanics properly lordy.
---
never heard of it, sounds kinda lame
---
Don't forget shit loot announces to everyone there that you died
---
no
---
Sure, like I said I understand why the boss hits through prayer. I however think that if a player is able to do all the mechanics, they should be rewarded for doing so. Currently it feels really bad if you have shit rng even if you do all the mechanics of the boss correctly.
---
They were 20m around slayer release, i remember plenty of people trading them in fally.
---
Imagine not immediately seeing it
---
I was thinking about this. Since I can't even beat the endboss with blood blitz, idk how he would do it with iban's blast as his best spell.
---
5.4k - 3000 = 500?
---
you need 70 smithing and you need to do an extremely long and difficult quest that has a shit ton of other quest requirements so it's kind of an earned spot
---
Do MLM until you can afford a coal bag and then do power mining.

Nice man! I’m in your same shoes with the fishing pet. Feels unachievable lol

If you use the Runelite client (Which I highly recommend), you can go into the settings in the Login Screen plugin in the configuration side menu and enable pasting of password
---
It's probably a setting within the Runelite "plugin" menu. Check that.

Theres bothing wrong with Merching. But a Tax would only be the beginning of a solution.

Seems like I need to get more sara brews then, I can't make them yet. I used anglerfish, but could only get her hp down to 300 without running out of food. Also my best mage gear is mystics.

[the pet is not mvp only fuck off with your mvp bullshit](https://i.redd.it/n15enye0rlc31.jpg)

Double loot is "not only mvp" either, neither are the uniques I got the zalcano shard with 31 rune bars when i barely did shit that round, I had 2 xp drops in the entirety of the kill.
---
Stop spreading bullshit about this entire mvp garbage till we actually have confirmation on how it works
---
pulic chat off. runelite entity hider on. never do content that requires more than 1 person. never get your heart broken again :'(

yes merwerth or something. should be at the teleportation spot at Lletya

Bone yard in wilderness. Around 10k xp/HR 😂

---
Gz for 99 hunter
---
Entirely incorrect, but good try! The only things I reused were: modified bandos chestplate shoulders, vestas chain skirt and ornamental boots. The rest is all new. I did base the helmet on a slightly fancier version of the tyres helm though, given the location.
---
I’m seeing a lot of complaints that it’s too ‘RS3’ which is peculiar, given the assets it’s made from. Also, the colours are of rune and dragonstone. I made sure to walk about with it with other rune items, to make sure you could mix and match. But hey ho, you’ll never please everyone!
---
detached from the main game, yeah. bot scripts that people write could be used to QA test the game.
---
I would prefer to see a greater reward for following the right mechanics, with much more severe punishments for making mistakes. Hell, give him a deflection prayer for when you use the wrong attack style or summin
---
Not my entire personality, but it's nice to game with guys who have similar experiences
---
J1mmy's content is all about the skits, adding to the RPG element this game is sorely lacking. Saying you like J1mmy without skits is like saying you like Hawaiian Pizza without Pineapple.
---
So? clans can hoard any item in game now and force the price to rise with demand. your argument is invalid. nothing will change with rares.
---
Considering Seren is the Goddess of the elves and we're fighting her/a part of her you would expect it to be somewhat of a challenge in my opinion. So far it seems the elven diety can be bested easily by anyone with a trident. So the elves worship something that's weaker than anyone with 50k and some runes... right.
---
Also for your comparison. It would depend on the story of the quest. If it's like the previous 2 ofcourse it wouldn't make sense for there to be a big boss. However if we're digging into a vault containing some mythical-end of the world- creature that was locked up for years it would make sense to fight something along the lines of 3 jads.
---
I just stick to Skilling.
---
&gt;imagine having a max cape and fletching while doing zalcano. unreal.
---
you have a mental disability clearly
---
Are you saying I can’t just make a new account and have access to everything in the game within 10 minutes?! That’s ridiculous!

we could put them to work in that new flax field

&gt; This really has been a horrible quest experience and there should be further prompts prior to losing so many hours of my time and also wealth.

I walked in once with a bow and and the scepter instead of my perfect mage weapon which I had dropped on the floor in the prep room
---
Yes, to the best of my knowledge that is correct. But your plants will be done growing well before the Iasor dies. Anima plants last for over 3 days where most crops are done within a few hours. I only bother with the Attas plant and just replace it constantly. The other two are ok but with Ultracompost disease is rarely an issue anyway and unless you are on all the time and paying very close attention to farming growth cycles the time boost will end up being less overall harvests than if you just stick with Attas. In my experience anyway

divine ranging potion, keeps ur range on max boost for 5 mins

I bought my first one around that time for 3,3m

Has anyone figured out what you have to do to actually get MVP? Is most damage during the mining phases? Or does the armour phase damage count as well?

do you watch it in spanish with subs? i tried watching the first episode but the dub was so bad i couldn't make it 10 minutes in

off-topic, how did you get your interfaces like that? when you right click?

I legit can't leave bank without a method of getting back from wherever I end up at. Usually it's a stack of house tabs/cons or max cape
---
That depressing, huh
---
Just got karils top and bottom from Barrows. I'm a med level and not really doing any bossing atm except for barrows if you even count that as bossing. Should I keep both?? I could use the cash for selling them but not sure how useful they are for my account at the moment.
---
Someone's a masochist...
---
I saw one of your comments saying you’re unsure of what rs3 even means when people say that about designs and idk what they mean but to me its about being too detailed in a game like oldschool runescape. At this point in time I’d honestly call this game a version of rs3 without evolution of combat, there are some  ideas (bis boots, scythe, 3 item boss drops build into one item) that just to me are a copy paste with a different texture and name. I do not wanna see something like granite armour in endgame scenes but when you compare the old stuff with the new stuff there’s a transition, and it makes me wonder if in the future will the old designs ever change to “keep up with the times”
---
I did the quest day one on mobile lol
---
Idk what runelite+ has but I know there was a PvP script that basically played the game for you floating about. I do however know runelite+ offers 1 click blackjacking, which is pretty sketchy but no comment has been made on it nor would I personally use it. But if it's your thing, you do you.

If you click options and the house icon, there's a "Leave House" button.

What's the point of getting high levels and doing quests if there is no reward? There's plenty of content for all levels so stop complaining because they've released something for high levels.
---
FYI other than afk nmz, at least 90% of my play time is mobile, I've only got as far as completing regicide in the elf quest line and don't meet the requirements for the new quest. When I want to unlock prif then I'll put the time in to meet the requirements for it
---
How is it shit? Because it lacks Runelite's features?
---
Sounds like you don’t have the stats, don’t want to work towards unlocking the city and want everything brought down to your level.
---
Not really, only the Helmet, and even that is more like a tyras helm

Damn thanks for the testing. Guess I know what I'll try to get to kill Zulrah on my Ironman.

Died at zalcano, probably 10x easier. Absolute mad lad for trying gauntlet on UIM
---
Very Noble of you to make this meme
---
Lol, imagine trying to make someone feel bad about enjoying different things than you
---
I have tested nothing, but it could be bad pathing. If you run 2 squares a tick, and half the time it runs you to the sq that lets you attempt it, and the other half it runs you into the pit, then you could expect this result. The public opinion on it would still be right, and you would be partially correct. Half the time it wouldn't make a difference.
---
This just doesn’t feel right. Plenty of Mods have left and spoke their minds about Jagex (Ayiza and MMK) but have not mentioned anything of this sort.
---
What do you mean they tossed you g maul rework? That’s the last nail in the coffin on bh lul.

ok

Just don't give them any items unless you have known them for a long time and trust them.

i have 90 mining and crystal pick, my friend with 99 and dpick  gets 200k-500k mvp loot all the time while i get my 10k loot lmao

What a fucking chad holy shit lmfao

whats that on? couldn't find anything on osrs

I disagree. Clans ruined the wilderness along with pvm'ers being put in unfair situations in the wild. So many spots are multi for no reason. Chaos Elemental? Calisto? The only safe thing to do in the wild anymore is to run around with a clan and that seriously limits half of the game. Telly blocking and constant freezing is also trash. Jagex keeps trying to buff it too with the weakening of the bulwark and dhide. It's way too one sided and is built now for people to grief other people. Since this is the case now very few people do pvm in the wild. It's just not worth it.
---
They don’t mean you lose the reward points. When you use absorption potions, you can drink multiple to get up to 1000 absorption points to your character, blocking that much damage. It says in the chat box how much damage is blocked. If you die or leave, you lose all of that, so it’s something to keep in mind if you are afking. I never drink all the doses possible while AFKing at work, since I don’t want to lose all those absorption doses if I need to log out suddenly.
---
Any quests?
---
Staff is lowest dps. 
---
But in this case he had the tier 3 upgrade for the hally. Players dont usually farm/keep a third weapon frame. 
---
So if you accidentally make the wrong second weapon you’re stuck with a tier two for the boss fight.
---
Weast
---
Fucking b0nk right there
---
I was hoping that would open the door for new types of combo weapons in the future and also bring some newer player into the wild... but who are we kidding you’re probably right.
---
Why fletch
---
Yea any dub will be annoying, I also speak Spanish thankfully
---
I usually get a t2 bow ASAP then upgrade whatever other weapon I find along the way so a t2 and t3. Is this ideal or should I get two t3?
---
Pretty sure West said that isn't the case.
---
Of course that's how quests are meant to be done. You think they spend all that time writing a plot, dialogue etc if you're just meant to hold space bar while listening to slayermusic?
---
I watched 1 through 20 this weekend....yes.....
---
Isn’t someone trying to flame you for having an accumulator more neck beard-ish than having an accumulator lol
---
Howmuch are the potions actually going for?
---
Who?
---
It is, but the rapier doesn’t degrade.
---
I didn't realize how familiar it felt since I haven't had cable in awhile.
---
In my experience it's a much better chance at decent loot, beyond just 2 rolls.
---
I think there’s an optional one to get the teleport there. Do some digging on the wiki. It’s not a bad quest at all
---
nice
---
Max main fights is still good
---
I tried it back in the day, even got my friend to get back into osrs cause "there was a cool mew dungeon skill" and it just felt stale to me, i was bored with it shortly after release. i remember being pretty hyped summoning aswell then once i started lvling it I hated it. Im not opposed to every new skill i just want a good one, I voted yes for warding so im not just "muh nostalgia!" I wamt the game to vhange and evolve but i dont think dungeoneering is the answer. And yes i played it before the eoc was released
---
Howmuch is the pickaxe?
---
You mean for yourself?
---
"this guy"
---
Do you mean you?
---
Your name is in the image.

Is this the new power rangers?

It was a Birb

I usually make a t2 bow right away to go hunting for the t3s. So in that case I have a t2/3 bow, t2 staff, and no more weapon frames

&gt;At drop rate, you have a 63.4% chance to get the item.
---
could you explain how you calculate this please? genuinely interested
---
New skills alter the base foundation of the game. It offsets level locks, and such.
---
Dungeoneering and summoning ruined true old school. It brought out extremely OP gear and content and it completely altered the dynamic of the combat system. You said "somewhat eoc" is what ruined old school. You realize the introduction of a new skill which completely imbalanced the game (dungeoneering) is what started eoc right? They completely had to rework the combat system in order to attempt to regain balance. Then it went further and further.
---
Now you be like blah blah blah Dont introduce a combat rewarded/upgraded based skill... They tried that too with summoning. It created a skill which completely demolished the economy within several months.
---
The only way to introduce a skill that doesn't alter the combat triangle or alter the economy generally will mean another useless skill like firemaking. Which it would be such a pointless skill that it, as well, would be shot down because there is no point.
---
This is why new skills will not likely ever pass a poll.
---
Also micro transactions did not become a problem until the eoc started to take effect because they lost so many active players and their income from members plumetted.
---
Priffddinus , the new area that came out with the update
---
Why even make the staff in the first place. That’s what I’m confused with. Make the bow and just hold a frame until you see one of the t3 piece droppers
---
People vote while only thinking of themselves, too, not what's best for the game. It's how it's always been and always will be.
---
Yeah but the people who *do* want to train it make up like 2% of the osrs community. Go to any cc, any body of players at any time and ask “opinions on rc?”, almost every response will be “It’s cancer”. I know many high level players, with base 70-80s but only rc level in the 50s. More or less no one wants to train it 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
My god what a terrible card.
---
You will be able to play F2P normally after. However you won't be able to use any of the members items you got during the trial.
---
So?
---
Is everyone supposed to know every item from every game?
---
Pretty sure you need min 11 pray for the quest :)
---
I made them myself, but ge average says 18.8k
---
Not defending the guy but my hc was a higher level than my main ever was by a lot
---
Looks like shit
---
Ah i used mithril seed flowers for that. Didn't know irit worked
---
Gotten 8 twice with 99 farming and supercompost. Don't think any of it matters and it's just RNG between 8 and 10 shards.
---
I like to think ex Mod Jed spends his spare time writing all of these bad reviews.
---
Exactly :3!
---
I feel like people would benefit from the extra rune pouches more than this.
---
The madlad has 99 hunter now
---
That's actually a pretty picture of Caracas, I like it

---
I'd rather get pk'd and called things I should not repeat on this forum than get another elite casket containing a D mace, 54 firelighters and 9 pest control teleports.
---
These skill were released in like 2008 and 2009, they didn't kill the game.
---
You can :)
---
The wilderness was designed for one purpose, a dead wasteland where anything goes. If you would have read the old dev blogs you would know that clans where 95% of the wilderness and jagex and the players loved it. Andrew Gower had more plans on expanding the wilerness with more activitys like black salamanders, wilderness agility course, King black dragon and so on...
---
And to answer your question, probably about 50/50 and thats how it should be.
---
heres an example of clans fighing since you seem to have never witnessed it

I only had a few brews in all my Slayer because I got 2 zenytes from my first demonic task and haven’t gone back since. You people are retarded. The point is that effectively requiring brews for a boss is bad design. Either way i killed the boss already without them so Il done arguing with you clowns.
---
No fucking idea what the significance of this 'World Record' is but I'm up-voting because it's Woox doing Woox things.
---
Am not 100% on the why, but it has something to do with cancelling the initial delay when beginning mining. So instead of the wind up time, you instantly get the ore.

Oh how exciting.

---
Yep, that's who. Thanks
---
Still waiting on slayermusiq
---
First you calculate the odds of it not happening. To do that the equation is: ((x-1)/x)^n 
---
Here x is the drop rate, and n is the number of kills. Filled in that looks like (2999/3000)^3000=P. 
---
This represents the odds of going 3k kills dry at the boss. Now to flip it to see the odds of getting the pet, you do 1-P. Then you multiply this by 100 to get it as a percentage.
---
3 times now i walked in with raw food...
---
EMG?
---
Since I just unlocked prif, what drops the seeds?
---
I wish there was an activity threshold so more than one person could get the mvp loot as long as they contribute enough like maybe top three or something
---
The average is the average, it includes everything. Cost in supplies will vary a lot depending how fast your kills are and what weapon you use, but even if it's only 5% that's 40M off 800.
---
I don't have a question, just wanted to say that jad is a whore. He did about 10 range attacks in a row so when he finally switched to mage I forgot to change prayer. Bitch.
---
Comparable to tbow only zulrah?
---
I think he's saying it improves it the same amount that elite void does.
---
You complete the challenge in a short amount of time. Also given the ridiculous amount of RNG the Corrupted Gauntlet you need to kill the boss with additional factors of panic, eating and wasting ticks for attack and running around the room, it makes it all the more amazing that WOOXWON!
---
Back in 06 I had a steel longsword and an anti dragon shield and thought I was some god.
---
'Looks like RS3' is a poor cop-out widely used on this subreddit. The Runescape 3 version of dragonstone armour doesn't resemble this version. 
---
Not to mention it's *supposed* to look ornate. It's anmed after a gemstone and exceedingly rare. There should be detail and embedded gems. I'm not seeing a divide in art style between this and any of the other cosmetic-oriented sets.
---
I just wanna see how it would work at the abyssal sire during the respiratory phase
---
Hard.
---
Now you added egocentric as a replacement for ungrateful
---
My point was I can understand not getting the MVP reward, but I’m struggling to get any reward at all sometimes. Seems a bit out of touch with a minigame.
---
Nice try at patronising me though ya douchebag
---
Thanks will try it out
---
wintertodt is more afk than conventional firemaking....
---
Found the edgeyville boi's
---
Ouch
---
For some of the "dumber" monsters like giants, my headcanon is that they ate some adventurer without emptying his pockets, and the runes, gold, and other stuff that they drop was in their stomachs before they died.
---
Ok thanks guys, didn't know their Magic defence was non-existent! That saves me over 4.5m.
---
Say sike right now
---
That's like saying it's not fair for someone to use claw specs on a boss because you forgot to recharge your spec bar before starting

The one who holds record after week 2 gets the gaming chair.
---
Yes you’ll get teled to lumbridge you’ll still have p2p gear on but itl say members item and it won’t give you any stats
---
Oooh sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit, sounds big then!
---
Except its gonna make the normal Skilling stuff crash even harder than pvm does, and takes less skill
---
Ur account is dog shit
---
Basic features like gpu,ground items, skybox, yea it's missing essentials
---
Imagine burying big bones to 87 prayed
---
That's a fair point, although I didn't think they eat humans
---
I used to think 2h swords standed for "2 hour sword" so I had a bank full of rune 2h's wondering why they never disintegrated
---
I had no clue about tick manipulation at zalcano. What I do know is I managed to get 12 mvps out of 52 kills on 2k world earlier today just doing normal mining.
---
Well, you can say that about all the people that play efficiently, doing the same efficient methods for hours and hours on end. It's just different playstyles.
---
They weren't worth as much back in the days.
---
I got a whole set and also traded the red one to my brother for his rune legs. Kept the blue all the way up into RS2 though.
---
Not OP but i’m going for max and all pets. How do you pick a boss to do? SLAYER! All of my tasks are boss tasks for pets loll. It shakes things up a bit.
---
Nothing. It was a rumor back in the day you were unable to receive a visage from dragons unless you talked to Oziach after dragon slayer so now people use it as a meme for other unrelated items.
---
I don't think you can remove it if it's full
---
Good fucking luck getting 3 armor seeds on an Ironman
---
Time to restart your account. Rip
---
That's firm millennial, like most of the reddit population
---
I got the shard with 31 rune bars, I didn't get the ash drop there from whats going around of the people with pets i've talked to so far they all got their pet without the ash drop so some people now claim that the ash drop gives you an extra roll for the pet but thats about it.
---
You have half the apes here claiming ash drops = mvp drop I got my shard with 31 rune bars like I said not with ashes does that make it a mvp drop?
---
He is not asking for contribution he is making a SUGGESTION without knowing how the fucking system works he is making multiple statements that uniques and pet is "mvp" only when there are times I got the ash drop and someone ran out with a onyx.
---
I don't know how the system works and neither does any of us unless jagex tells us the only thing I know for a fact is that you don't need to get the ash drop or "mvp" drop to obtain a unique or the pet.
---
Yeah they sold for ~8 on release but spiked due to zalcono being such good gp/hr
---
I remember some dude died to a varrock guard and he dropped full iron, some food, and like 10k. I thought I was so wealthy I splurged on an air staff lmao. So naive back then.
---
Hence why we are playing 07scape now BEFORE the skills
---
Hop Counter logged me for 10+ minutes the other day, I’ve noticed a change as well.
---
Love it.
---
1.5m/h without ever getting mvp just isn't enough smh
---
Lmao my friends kept telling me how stupid it looked, but I didnt care
---
Doubt it affects your hits since there are no attack bonuses on the armor, likely just good RNG. I just know the defense bonus is very noticeable.
---
It'd be cool to see a potential world that has no GE and you have to make an account and it's locked to that world only..sorta like DMM?
---
Thanks for the advice and motivation!
---
I think it has to do more with the shading and contrast than the style of the armor. Newer assets do tend to use a smoother shading style that may not conflict with older assets like armors, but it can stand out if you are used to the old ones. The other thing that stands out is the vibrant purple jewels, often with black trimming to make it contrast even more. Not sure how else to do it where it would look better, but perhaps flatter gems (like with amulets) without the outline; also the same shade of dragonstone as a glory if it isn't.
---
That said, are you open to modifying the design at all? Aside from potentially tweaking the gems like mentioned, the only two parts that I'd say could do with any changes are the body and the helmet. Shoulders on the body, while they may be based on Bandos, do seem a bit much and it might look better without that second layer below the one with the dragonstone. The helm is harder to advise on since it just looks off and I'm not sure how to fix it; perhaps a rune version of the Ornate Helm with a Dragonstone on the top to fall closer to a Rune Full Helm?
---
Probably a scammer playing the long con tbh
---
It took me about 6K to get my kbd pet also.  I understand how you feel :)
---
Damn that was beautifully written and said. Well done.
---
+1 for elf tiddies reference. ;)
---
I miss the old seasons. Gods the writing was strong then
---
Lol where do you get these pictures man
---
Whats up with this cartoony style anyways?
---
You don't need the color wheel for the quest, it was the same with me.
---
Yes spot on, i told him as soon as he sent me the screenshot!
---
Kind of wish that there was a sort of "Ironman-lite" mode that simply just disabled the use of the GE and only allowed you to trade with other Litemen (to avoid just having other people buy stuff off the GE for you)
---
It's ~600k per hour with a chance at a huge payout. It's the new barrows. It's fine.
---
It seems they did Zalcano a bit better than I first thought. Still, at other bosses like GWD, if you do a mass you are likely to get nothing while at Zalcano you'd still get some rewards. I wonder if we will see teams for Zalcano like with GWD and splits and such or if it will just be a FFA.
---
with t2 armour and 1 perfect weap, how will be the supplies? 2 pots and full fish using up all the prep time?
---
What do you mean before the skills? Real Rs2 didn´t have hunter, Construction, farming btw
---
If you get divorced do you have to split your banks 50/50?
---
Imo Jagex completely killed the art style with this new elf quest... Please never do this again.
---
Well he does need another for his gigantic balls of steel
---
Haha OP is a stupid retard get whooshed on bitch!
---
Nice
---
Giving a certain eye-candy mod something to do.
---
Wow this has never been posted before ................. ................. ................. .................
---
I honestly wish "removing ge" to some capacity became viable. Or we could go back in time and just go about it differently.
---
GE is kind of like the "Trade limit/ kill wilderness" nuclear equivalent to solving all problems related to trading. There are a lot more elegant solutions that don't involve gutting the rest of the game.
---
 [Screenshot of collection log/current barrows items.](https://i.gyazo.com/ffdc36554f525b972e8cdcd07f9d2676.png) Like the first half of my items were pre-collection log.
---
Got this a couple weeks ago, and have slowly been realizing how insanely lucky I was.
---
I remember being a noob at 11 years old and seeing "2h sword" thinking you would have one sword in each hand.
---
I thought dual wielding swords would be awesome! so i spent my whole cash stack on an iron 2h and when I equiped it I was very disappointed. 
---
Also I'll never forget how I used a bronze longsword to train to like 30 attack and strength, had no idea there were better weapons and I remember finally getting an adamant longsword, hittin a 7 and thinking I was super powerful.
---
Thanks for clarifying! I was so confused.
---
Yea ok. My head just exploded from the mind blowing irony.
---
I get that the scam is preying on the people who don’t know, but the grail isn’t a quest item :P
---
A
---
that number isn't accurate at all lol
---
People keep saying that but I saw one that wasnt yd. Wasnt mine though
---
LMAO. I still will learn new things about RS after playing for so long
---
Lmao jagex really cant win with this community it seems
---
Can you link a guide or something about this? I've tried this method once, and it takes like 10+ barrages to actually hit one. Constant splashes. And it's so expensive. Doesn't seem worth it to me at all. Are you supposed to damage graardor with blood barrage after he's frozen? Because that's also constant splashes. Like I might actually do 0 damage for a full freeze because all I get is splashes.
---
Instancing was the worst thing to happen to osrs. Old school by the way.
---
F2p efficient prayer burries bone spawns in wilderness. This guy probably did most of it with giants since he has 1.2k obor jc, but thats not the meta.

A different kind of grind ayy

What the actual fuck did they do to the chat heads?
---
I did that for my first hundred or so teles then I noticed people not being in zanaris after I just followed them into a ring

Why not?

guys got the three peat

Well he is God incarnate

We think it is bad because Jagex made everything else op

I'm a sick dude I like a short clue

Everybody out, he's pullin' his horn!

Majority of the playerbase wanted those which is why it failed the polls to be removed.

It was terrible for the game. It was so easy to bypass the early magic levels.

remember cook the fish buddy

I felt your pain. 7778 KC pet here
---
This shit was the absolute worst at previous jobs, and is a leading factor in the high as fuck turnover rate every time I see it. Getting a job that didnt give a shit if I went to the bathroom as long as my shit gets done was one of the best ways to improve how I actually viewed working.
---
What’s your ehp
---
Imagine putting 100 hours into osrs 😱
---
I think the main issue that most people think is tick manipulating isn't going to help as much at a lower level. So not only do players at 99 have a warranted advantage for their stats, but it scales exponentially compared to those that are focusing just as hard at a lower level. 
---
I did some calculations and they may be wrong, but I'm interested to see if other people come to the same conclusion so please let me know.
---
For example.
---
 Let's say at Max mining you have an 80% chance of getting ore per attempt. With a default attempt at 1 attempt every 5 ticks 
---
1÷.80=1.25, then 1.25×5= an average of 1 ore per 6 ticks.
---
Reducing this to 3 tics= 
---
1.25x3= average of 1 ore every 3.75 ticks
---
Dropping the average time per ore by 2.25 ticks, or 37.5%
---
Now let's look at what it would be at a lower level, using 60% as a base chance.
---
1÷.6= 1.667. 1.667×5= avg of one ore every 8.335 seconds
---
Vs 3 ticks:
---
1.667×3 =5.001
---
 
---
This reduces the avg time of ore by 3.334 seconds, or by 60.007%
---
So if this logic is true, tick manipulation actually benefits you MORE at a lower level, lowering the gap of avg ore per tic between both ends of the skill range. Effectively making it MORE noob friendly.
---
Going into these calculations, I also believed that tick manipulation would widen the gap even further, but now I'm starting to think that it's actually helping. Interesting to say the least if I'm correct, which I may very well not be.
---
I just want to hit the drop table once zz
---
One big thing that helped me was playing with game sounds turned up because jads attacks have different noises so you can anticipate a little easier
---
No, are you?
---
This is dope, what kinda phone?? Would make any skill on mobile pretty chill
---
It has to do with the new quest, yes. Stuff was converted in bank.
---
I love when low level gear is cool. There's something special about the feeling of making just a few gold closer to a really cool sword that you didn't even know was pretty basic. Making 20M or however much for some high end weapon doesn't have the same feel as scrounging for every piece of gold just to get by day to day
---
suicide methods are faster with low defence
---
thanks for your input
---
*ding ding*
---
It's so simple yet so genius
---
Is that a book that keeps teleport scrolls?
---
Is this reddit going to keep circle jerking to mod ash and how "badass" he is for blatantly ignoring polls?
---
69 defense. Nice.

Probably the crystal armor and sword that look like SoF rewards

Desert treasure coming out the next week...

60 melees, trout/salmon for food, 40 pray (prot ranged)

It wasn't "no poll."  It was polled and they chose to ignore the results.

Yes, it's called the Master Scroll Book. It's a unique from clues
---

I never said it didn't save money...
---
Wondering the exact same thing!
---
You're saying that Ash did this?
---
yeah, i always heard that osbuddy manipulates the website to profit merching, cant trust anyone those days
---
It is a lot of fun for me
---
This right here, it literally doesn't effect your combat at all. I guess some people make pures for weird OCD reasons instead of for PKing so they think 2def "ruins" the account. It doesn't, I was 3def before EoC and I repped that shit. If anything you're slightly better than a maxed 1def build. Also, 53 pray is what's up.
---
tbh you can do a reasonable attempt right now
---
A lot of phones can do this.
---
People can recover ur account with that kind of info
---
I feel like people would use alts to grind out a sick fashionscape pet lmao, would be pretty cool though
---
It's every 12 seconds. I use a timer like this myself.
---
I didn't pull that number out my ass. Went through every single screenshot of zolcano loot I could find on Twitter and did 50kc intentionally missing MVP by a good margin.
---
i was joking, jeez
---
btw, i know people wrongly banned
---
2k slayer points for a 8m drop, not sure if I'd say that is worth it
---
In our casual games we play house rules that coinflips have to end with a result. We would re flip until either result happens. Makes cards like Big Win and this more fun
---
What do you mean, reddit has been circlejerking over these chatheads since quest release lol, how about we appreciate all the great work that went into this quest instead rather than everyone bitch about a minor graphical change?
---
The dragonstone armor is whack
---
Hahah yeah i onky got 4 ashes in 100kc, how much did you sell your tool seed for?
---
Idk if anyone remembers 1itemdbow(he might still have some videos up on youtube). But he used to be a runescape pvp YouTuber. Idk if he was hacked or payed to upload a keylogger/rat video or if he did it himself. But the video was an advertisement for a private server. I was heavily into the private server scene at the time since EOC was coming in the near future. 1itemdbow was a massive youtuber at the time so I trusted the file. Well I ended up downloading the file and was hacked the next day. This was before EOC and I was close to maxed combat, had overloads, turmoil, chaotics etc... a very desirable account. Well they cleaned the account and changed the password. Luckily I was able to recover it. Definitely my dumbest runescape moment.
---
Once I was bursting these for a task. When I’m done I to to the ge. About 2 minutes later I get a loot drop notification for one of these so I rush back, but someone took the chain. Was so sad rip 3m, would have been a solid chunk at the time
---
Normally 6, but logged halfway
---
Well Kodai and ancestral wasn't a thing before, so it definitely wasn't a popular meta since those items buffed magic substantially.  Hope you have more luck this time around bro!

I'm not OP lol, I didn't get a tool seed
---
And litterly every other boss (except for Jad, Inferno and maybe some wildy bosses)
---
Not even in the top 5 of slowest or worst skills to train.
---
😭😭😭😭😭
---
Don't burn yourself out, do something else in life that you enjoy
---
Exercise, play other games/consoles, play tabletop/card games (I'd recommend MtG!)
---
It's 12 seconds. I made one myself. Boss isn't 4 tick, it's 5.
---
Dwarf propaganda btw
---
Yeah its somthing about that runite colour, screams bank :P
---
Yes. For 5 years people have been pushing the goalpost further when it comes to reasons why they "would quit" rather than use official client. Literally the biggest reason is because the official client doesn't borderline play the game for you, and that is it. 
---
Everything else mentioned for years as things that would make them use official client instead if added (exp counter, world map, spec orb, drop notifications etc) were merely excuses. Now this gpu thing and infinite zoom shit is yet another.
---
Dude, here is what you do: get 70 attack, ranged and magic on F2P. Get members trial and do barrows for a day using black salamander (ultra cheap), then get a bond and have fun!
---
Tbh, I wouldn't really value slaying points to GP. Each hydra task excluding uniques is a guaranteed 5m at least. Start including uniques and that can shoot up to 15m
---
The proposed chat head looks really good actually fits the theme of OSRS very well I hope that's what they go with.
---
If he is bored, grinding zulrah or vork will only make it worse
---
will they ever learn..
---
Shut up sweaty
---
You say my reading comprehension is poor yet here you are maki things out of thin air! Literally quote me where I said you’re a neckbeard, despite the fact you clearly are one. 
---
I implied you don’t shower, because you used the phrase “imagine missing a game tick” which, as I’m sure you’ll know, is roughly 0.6~ seconds. 
---
Now, just to even further clarify: I am inferring you are smelly because losing 0.6 seconds isn’t a big deal to people who a) Shower regularly b) have seen the sun this month. 
---
If you need more explaining about you being a troglodyte (it’s okay go google it) I’d be more than happy to break it down for you.
---
Recolors crown
---
Is this an oversight or what?
---
It's the end of the series and this isn't an item... Why?
---
Do karamja elite last so that you can use all the other lamp rewards on rc o.o will saves lots of time
---
i guess you right, i oversaw that its 5*4 ticks not 4*4 ticks cus attacks doesnt change before the 4th attack but after so my mistake.
---
Then I have to worry about being an asshole when I don't respond though.
---
So they can be sparkly
---
These quest references are getting more nieche by the update
---
Just a year ago it was like 3M
---
Insane
---
"Yeah this is my 99/99/99 maxed pure"
---
What does pure even mean anymore?
---
Thanks. I use the farming guild but these sound like they might be more out of the way.
---
With the current prices of divine potions each shard is worth around 18-20k after making the 2.5 potions, the upgraded chest requires 10 shards (180-200k) to open in addition to the key which generally makes it not worthwhile. also the sudden drop might be from investors dumping their supplies after the update.
---
Mage for rune pouch too
---
One of many reasons third party ge tracking shouldn't be allowed.
---
Maybe work harder at the game if you want more out of it. Otherwise stfu.
---
I would give you mine if I could
---
AHK is illegal so lavas are out...and crafting bloods/souls leads to homosexuality
---
The only real options are nats/astrals but they’re like 20k xp/h
---
It failed the yes % was 60 something.
---
Leave it to Jagex to give a better loot table to the brainless afkable skilling boss than the timed/focus-requiring PvM challenge that takes 3-4 times as long to complete
---
Yeah but it's made from oldschool models. It looks bad but it's oldschool imo. And in that comment I was talking about crystal armour.
---
Also if anyone is interested a video I just discovered uploaded around the same time frame -
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuRJA5jt8Os
---
Done 51 chests and my average time is probably 10 min and made 2.65m so yeah
---
I think the problem is some of those mechanics were basically game design errors. The goal of a quest isn't for it to be tedious, or rely on an RNG chance for success. It's about puzzle solving, storyline, and rewards! I don't think these changes are gonna even be noticably for most players.
---
Gauntlet BAD, Zalcano GOOD
---
watch out guys we have a detective on the case hes exposing all our jokes on reddit
---
Yeah apparently sword drop is 1/1000 in normal mode, making it less than 1m gp per hour on drop rate...
---
Boomers and not understanding jokes, NAMID
---
I am so jealous almost at 1400 KC. No pet.
---
Santa hats were 15k-45k in the first day or two.
---
For me it's entirely EOC and nostalgia. With EOC, RS3 combat reminds me/is the same as WoW's combat. Which is fine, I like that combat style...IN WoW. I cant put the 2 together and have fun. It's like, I like ketchup, and I like pancakes. But I do not like ketchup on my pancakes.
---
I didn’t downvote you, my dude. I was just saying what I do. Why would I downvote someone else who is trying to be helpful? Just trying to give my two cents. Have a great day.
---
It's not the game that most of us grew up on. My personal opinion is if I wanted a combat style like that, I would be playing a different game. I like RuneScape because of the way the combat and skilling mechanics are, and because I grew up on this game I heavily prefer OSRS.
---
MTX ruins the integrity of the game. Where's the fun in the game if you can throw a few hundred dollars in and get free XP and GP? OSRS you have to actually put in work to level your account.
---
A man's gotta eat, Julian.
---
Someone got 61 trout
---
This game only exists because people did fucking hate EOC and the shit that lead up to it.
---
But hey, let them take that path again because "you aren't a neckbeard".
---
I know you're still mad about warding not passing. But just remember to take a look back at some of the stupid item rewards they've attempted to poll/blog in the past.
---
It shows how little they understand their own game.
---
Just log in both accounts and trade them?
---
AROO, CRANK YER HOG BROTHERR!
---
They're literally from bandos...
---
Not fitting in the game my ass
---
Yea but it further reduces the amount of people in one spot, you can even argue it's more exclusive than the "private" spot. Furthermore, the new anvil is now the best spot regardless. The 2m/hr won't decrease since it's just mining runite which is secured by high alch value you know? Plus Blast Furnace peeps need it.
---
Stonks
---
At least 7
---
Haha, only mid. Yep, that's meeeee
---
Well, for one, Dark Beasts are no longer in the catacombs
---
Play whichever game you enjoy. OSRS is just OSRS with some new content.
---
I play manual.
---
The only part that looks even remotely similar to rs3 is the helm and that still looks far better than the rs3 helm
---
I don't think this is real.
---
Crystal wand with its own spell please.
---
TBH, I don't think it matters too much. Even at 27, you likely wouldn't bother to do another craft just for 1 extra ess. Maybe for Lavas since less delay, but it still seems like it would lose more time than it is worth. But 26 with 90 RC req seems like a fair tradeoff from 30 Ess between 4 pouches. I'd even be fine if they did 25... But I also do like it degrading back into 4 pouches and needing some material or such to repair it back together than just normal degrading; though perhaps as compensation it could also degrade slower than other pouches (e.g. every 2 hours you need to repair but it is harder/slower than just npc contact).
---
Raids 2 is newer and harder.
---
What seeds did you trade for your crystal acorns?
---
Just make it look like you’re trapped in an ice barrage
---
Yeah gonna get all my alts to vote no on this. Wouldn't want it devaluing my achievements, even though I know other people would like it.
---
Probably because there was a whole discord dedicated to solving it and they did the majority of the work, this guy just found the very last part
---
Or be faced with 10000 slaps and 10000 chops from my savage army. HahahahahaHA wow!
---
Can confirm that agility gives them. Afk woodcutting the yew trees by the bank also gives a small chance to recover shards
---
 The fact this stupid shit gets upvoted is the reason you dumb cunts complain about shit all the time.
---
Zero reasonable feedback is given and all you morons do is post memes all day and suck each other off, literally the most pathetic subreddit on this garbage site.
---
Sweet post, I'll check these out when I get home.
---
I never get to watch him stream because of the time zone but it's great he does YouTube too.
---
Hahaha poop man hahaha I fucking shat myself. My parents disowned me
---
Lol man thinks looting and potting 4 times less often is pointless... am i missing something.
---
even though it failed a poll in the past they changed the fail rate of the traps with the release of Song of the Elves...so it's not really that dangerous any more :/
---
Thank you! I was there for over 16 hours and got as much as I could while watching!
---
I like this definition the best, or a stricter one: only accounts with level 1 in combat stats are pures because they do not benefit from that aspect of combat.
---
They’re both right hand drive soooo
---
I use a Huawei p20 pro and my point was I can usually use split screen I know I can use YouTube or other apps at the same time but it's better to see both :D
---
Trash talking is normal in the wilderness.
---
The big motivator for most is likely a strong dislike of something in RS3, whether it is the combat, microtransactions, the overall direction of the game, or such. RS3 is decent if you like the RS3 style of game, but it can be a pretty drastic difference from the old style of RuneScape. OSRS isn't always perfect there either, but as the name suggests, it is much closer to the "Old School" RuneScape than RS3.
---
Much better. That's one thing about sports cars I dont understand. People who buy v6 versions and people who buy automatics if its offered in a manual.
---
Head changes is cosmetic. Changing the difficulty of a staple quest is literally game changing lol.
---
Nope doesn't ring a bell
---
this game definitely needs more tabards.
---
We need to make RSMVs great again and OSRS content
---
And my reason for saying no to this is that if the community wanted these items, they would have voted in the new skill. If you want rewards from the skill, add the skill. Community said no, these things go away.
---
Seer's Village was definitely where all the money was, close to pretty much everything, as well as the old party room. And it just so happened to be right there after White Wolf Mountain... So yeah it was pretty great.
---
Not sure if you're like 10 or just extremely immature, but either way I'd rather not talk to you.
---
I wouldn’t look at it like that. I trained my str to 99 in nazar and yes I have 9m points with all my rings imbued and Slayer helm imbued. I buy herb boxes every day and they make a lot of money but you can only buy 15 a day so the money is made back over months. If I had to guess I’d say I spent about 5m gold at nmz from 75-99 str between the coffer and gear repair and I’d say it’ll take me about 4 months or so to use all my points and would bring me at least like 15m. So theoretically like 10m profit but nmz should never be looked at for profit besides the small boost herb boxes give you daily.
---
Yeah for each one
---
 TWO WON
---
Relatable 
---
95 def. Lvl 125 99 everything else. 28m ranged. 15m str. 
---
Im gettin there just train whatever i get thru slayer. But obviously the most efficient way.  Hydra and vork have been my def training lately.
---
your username is jackbdick and im the immature one?
---
There was a CTC 2?
---
What I’m saying is nmz is fuckin awesome for afk combat xp but the nmz points are just a cool bonus once you have all your imbues
---
That's a shame. It looks really awesome and I bet it would change the game a little and would be pretty popular. I hope it gets noticed, it deserves another chance.  
---
Just a quick question on programming, how often does it get broken by new patches? Do you just pull new changes every thursday and it's good to go?
---
I've read some posts from a few years ago that say no. Just Google it. In my experience, it's also no.
---
Did this for awhile too. Dont blame ya dude its not like the game tells you literally anything.
---
Thanks I'll give t a try and let you know
---
already friends before hiring in?
---
30/hr is for the 302-tier worlds with a huge mass for players which 100% always have 1.5T people. I've timed my runs with 10-20 people and it's usually 20/hr. Granted sometimes we "miss" a barrier cycle (aka people don't mine enough tephra) but 20/hr is realistic for people not doing the huge worlds.
---
Some might. I've seen a few newer 90-100 cb that started with mobile release and don't know the old scams
---
Old meme
---
You never know, bonds are a thing that people can buy and sell ingame
---
Good sir.
---
Dont worry I didn't know you could alch notes til just recently...
---
Meh, you could of done better man. I am curious what happens when you dont get your daily dose of karma? Does your ego die?
---
That makes no sense... Zalcano is a boss, not a training method; it is supposed to be bad exp and good profit.
---
This issue is going around.
---
This! I love helping first timers. They run around al confused and lost and naked. I set them up with armor and some training spots and a couple of axes for mining and wood cutting.
---
Bouncer finna' get BOUNCED
---
whhhaat! I had no idea

When are you usually on? Curious if I’ll be able to find them when you’re on
---
God damn those faces though
---
Wow!
---
Can’t you just get it again?
---
Whats wrong with you.
---
While I generally agree, that's not always true in terms of technological advances. Computers today can be cheaper, lower-cost, and more powerful than computers 20 years ago, for instance.
---
Mod West did environment.
---
Tell that to prayer reordering, just to name one example. The clients are more than capable of doing things like adding options to fairy rings my dude.
---
Nostalgia mainly. I started osrs late last year and my account is now better than from rs2, or even how it is in rs3 after 2 brief returns to the game.
---
Sure you have to start again but then you can use your knowledge of the game to be far more efficient from the start. And with mobile you can drop in at almost time.

Why not just go and play properly?

Most americans dont, in europe most cars are manual and no one learns to drive in an automatic because that will be put on your license and you cant drive manuals
---
I'm sure he'd love to talk to you about how straight white guys are really the most oppressed group.
---
Makes perfect sense. People are manipulating ticks to get mvp for zalcano. It discourages teamwork. Make it work like winterdobt, maybe not too op xp and provides a decent way to earn avg profit and decent xp. 
---
Gauntlet on the other hand is shit and the only reason why you do it is for that 1/1k drop and pet. The loot is horrible...
---
It's a cute art crossover of 2 different games, dont get so butthurt.

I'm jealous that OP is a better artist than me too, but it's going to be okay. We will get through this.

Rust is still around? Oh you're talking about rs.
---
You didn't Google it, did you. You'd realize you're wrong. Maybe you did and you got upset which is why you're trying your best to sound smug.
---
I vividly remember 10 year old me getting my attack and strength up to go kill Hero’s in East Ardougne because I thought they dropped full rune. Man was I disappointed after the first few kills
---
Its better to not go by level and just always count down from 13m. So when i have 6m im like just 7m to go. Idk helps this way.
---
It's a meme
---
This, make loot better, and increase crystal shard drops (by a lot) to make the boss good.
---
No GE-man mode when? You can only trade with other No GE-man mode players.
---
the mourner's are all dead after SotE, FYI :)
---
and also you could always just tele down to the dark beasts without needing mourner before
---
Prayer reordering doesn't change the game lol. It wasn't in the code to configure fairy rings outside zanaris . U dumb?
---
1/3 is not over ruled by 2/3 unless the majority is great enough, which it isn't right now and it rarely is. It isn't as simple as a 51% majority.
---
Do.. I not have to bring my trees and stuff unnoted?
---
Hey, fixed!
---
These are +1 str, +1 range, and +1 mage over regen brace. Regen brace is also content that would naturally be polled nowadays, stats and all, so I dont see why gloves that are objectively better than them (minus the 40 def req) shouldnt be polled as well.
---
early 20s, thank you very much
---
I would only do it if it said angry things to you, and it could repeat the last thing the player said to you before you got it
---
I’ve finally got a system that I can beat it consistently unless I derp, but the rewards are definitely underwhelming. 107 combat, but just gotta get the right setup. That being said I had a run where I was prepped in 5 minutes except second weapon frame, then spent 5 minutes hunting frame with no success. That tilted me pretty good!
---
That guy in the inn says that Runescape is just an online game but you character doesnt beleive him.
---
Casual newbie playerbase that dont understand why polls are important in the first place letting things like this slide.
---
Yessssss
---
Doing Jad on that interface would be a great challenge
---
Half the time I run a full lap before I find 2 monsters for T3 weps, and end up not having time to get the food I need, the other half of the time I just hit so many fucking 0s on the boss that I run out of food from taking 19s through prayer for 5 mins
---
The answer is pretty obvious if you just try driving a manual some time. I enjoy driving because I feel like the car is an extension of myself. This is exacerbated when you have to shift the car yourself as well. 
---
But I grew up on automatics and I prefer them for the practicality, especially since mine lets me shift manually pretty quickly and simultaneously doesn’t let me do anything to the gearbox which would make it explode. Win win.
---
Regen bracelet is a corollary for addy gloves. These have the stats of rune gloves.
---
I would agree if it was a new unpolled bis item but it isnt a bis item in any sense so it has no actually effect. You can't expect them to poll every single tiny insignificant thing in a large update.
---
For a comparison this is like raids or something passing a poll and the new bis stuff also being polled but you can't expect them to poll every single insignificant item on the drop table separately and asking if they should add it and how many it should drop and what the drop rate should be.
---
While I am not saying do new random bis items or major changes without polling at some people the insignificant changes can't all be polled
---
Yeah if you're shifting all the time in traffic then you need to keep the car in a higher power gear for longer. I've been driving stick as my primary care transmission since I was 17 (25 now) and I don't even think about it. It's nice because you can downshift and have the power to pass someone right at your foot compared to having to gas it and allow transmission to decide that I want to accelerate. That's quite a lag when you have traffic coming at you.
---
I brought the black long sword from the same shop, I made all the money from killing men in Varrock just up the road from the shop. It took me ages, and was so inefficient, but I was thrilled the whole time lmao
---
This makes me wanna use the official client.
---
Yeah, happened to me today also. Tryed to hunt for the rabbit, but well.. I tryed.
---
Wait those actually look fucking good
---
Did we get to vote on them?
---
Considering all of the other unpolled additions in this update I think its more than fair to be concerned with unpolled changes becoming a larger trend.
---
proof or didnt heppen
---
Based on how this picture was taken, you're still a noob irl
---
Nieve might be descent. Or Zilyana.
---
Bob is the only option
---
Jesus Christ if this isnt me idk what is
---
Do you think corrupted is worth doing?
---
Let’s be honest with ourselves: those days were the best days
---
/d
---
Then why did spiked manacles pass a poll then? Those have no defence req when they have same STR bonus as dragon boots which require 60 defence to wear.  
---
Why did fremennik kilt pass the poll? Gives +1 STR just like obsidian platelegs except again, fremennik kilt doesn't have defence requirement while obsidian platelegs requires 60 defence.
---
In most cases people care about DPS over defence.  
---
Why wouldn't they pass a poll?
---
Looks right
---
That a whole fucking year. 8k+ hours. I have a bit less than 1k. That's some dedication to the game. (Or brutal addiction)

But the kills are extremely long and your fire making level has no direct effect on your ability to get loot.

Did that all my rune armor

Wondered why it dissapeared

Im high sue me 😂

Snelm is still my fashionscape. Pointed blood and tar, black priest robes, crab claw, Skillcape.

All my friends swore by the skimmy but that shit was ass to me. I remember switching from world to world at the baxe shop in Port Sarim trying to find one world that had a rune in stock. Must have refreshed for over an hour before I finally found one.

Manual is puss easy in traffic, put it in first, and basically use the glitch like an accelerator. No extra work.

After returning to osrs a year ago I started with, and still use, the official client. The only other person I’m aware of who uses it is MrNoSleep.
---
I suppose I am a purist, I would like to keep playing the game as designed by the creators but there are several things that keep tempting me toward Runelite. In order of most frustrating:
---
• **people saying !kcsomething**  you have to awkwardly ask them to say it normally
---
•**scouting raids** Maybe I don’t understand the map shape enough but I have no idea how Runelite is able to tell you the raid, and feel the scouter borders on cheating
---
•**Ice barrage timer** I try to judge it myself but knowing the exact second you’re unfrozen in the wilderness is a massive advantage
---
•**emojis 🦀** not essential but would be nice
---
I think Jagex should consider adding the !kc feature if possible, and perhaps a subtle visual cue for being/about to be unfrozen
---
All the other features like tile markers and respawn timers (eg at DKs) take me out of the immersion; it feels like i’m playing a spreadsheet, not running round a medieval world
---
but the is all just like, my opinion
---
wat
---
I've exclusively driven manual shifting cars as long as I've had a license (about 6 years) and to be completely honest it's not a pain in the ass at all if it's what you've gotten used to. I don't have to concentrate on any of my shifts at all it's all written down into my muscle memory.
---
Driving automatic cars feels weird as fuck for me.
---
Elunded
---
You need the saplings unnoted but what OP means is that, for example, you use 15 papayas as payment. You can pay with those noted.
---
iPad
---
The fact this stupid shit gets upvoted is the reason you dumb cunts complain about shit all the time.
---
virgin
---
Ohhh lmao
---
The things you plant need to be unnoted, but the payment can be noted
---
&gt;I would agree if it was a new unpolled bis item but it isnt a bis item in any sense so it has no actually effect.
---
*Technically* this isn't true. Assuming it requires 40 def, it's BiS for 40 def/zerker pures that haven't done RFD. People are bringing up the existence of regen brace a lot ITT, but given that regen brace would absolutely be polled according to our current precedent, it really just doesn't make sense that gloves that are objectively better minus their def requirement aren't.
---
&gt;For a comparison this is like raids or something passing a poll and the new bis stuff also being polled but you can't expect them to poll every single insignificant item on the drop table separately
---
You can, and you should. This is how OSRS has worked for almost all of its history. You're correct about the actual droptables of mobs not being polled (always), but they should have been. The worst updates in this game's history have been overpowered droptables a la Vorkath, Zulrah, and Wyverns that ruined the meta for mains and set the precedent of every mob needing to be 1m per hour.
---
&gt;While I am not saying do new random bis items or major changes without polling at some people the insignificant changes can't all be polled
---
Who gets to decide what's "insignificant"? What's significant is highly subjective, not only on an individual level, but also in terms of how you play the game. Pures being able to get barrows gloves would be insignificant to a main or an ironman but one of the biggest changes to account creation and the overarching meta of the game for pures. 
---
So who should decide whats 'significant' or not? Jagex? Or the players? Ill give you a hint - the entire reason this game exists is because we let the former decide in the past.
---
Evil Dave

1 Def pures can't equip these gloves. It doesn't matter.

Used 30% battery for the whole movie which was little over 2 hours. Was honestly pretty surprised.

Kids go to school, have activities, do other things and aren’t glued to their parents 100% of the time you know.  Some people watch game of thrones after putting the kids to bed, maybe homeboy clicked on trees instead.

Oh man the general store was like a pawnshop and lottery all rolled in one. I remember back in rs1 in the early days, I would sit in world 1 varrock general store seeing what would people would sell. It was usually full of junk and most of the time it was too full and to even sell anything new but things moved so fast, but occasionally you would see someone sell something semi valuable only for it to be bought a second or two later. Right after santas came out I remember waiting in there randomly while bored seeing if there was anything cool I could snag and for awhile it was all junk, maybe a few gems or ammys but nothing great. But then someone sold a santa hat and I almost shit my pants, back then holiday items were worth next to nothing in the general store so if someone was stupid enough to sell one you would be getting the deal of the century. Right as I went to click on it, it was already gone. But then someone sells another one, and then another. I miss all of the them to faster people and am about to throw my mouse but then right where my mouse is hovering I see a pink p hat pop up. I immediately click on it and click buy at the bottom of the screen and I couldn't believe it when I saw it in my invent. Still one of the happiest memories of my childhood, I used it to merchant my way to fortune and it set me up for years on RS.

Ouch dude.... why you gotta hit me with that

I can't see any typo here. What are you referring to exactly?
---
My crystal shield was removed from my bank completely and replaced with two crystal seeds
---
Ooo grats!
---
Did it never occur to you that it's weird to have to bank after every tree or herb patch?
---
I wish the icon was the same as regular pots but with a different color cork, the new designs are so small and makes it hard to tell how many doses are left.
---
I mean, you already have 3 game modes centered around not trading. It'd be weird if a new popular one was added that blocked you from a feature in the game that was essentially a mild modification of those existing 3 modes.
---
Making it a mode would kind of be admitting "Ge is kinda the problem"- and at that point why not just address the GE
---
Less than 7k for mage pot

I think the best part of this meme is that none of us are balking at the concept of calling the front desk for a wake up call. I know atleast two teens that did know this was even an option -- they just used their phones for alarms. Really speaks to Runescape's general age group (or, atleast, /r/2007scape's)
---
Yeah mostly I just wanted to get a bond to give members a shot without paying before I know if I enjoy this new/old version of the game and mobile before paying. Not in much of a hurry I travel a lot for work.
---
Ok. What does this have to do with RS?
---
Just turned 30 a few days ago. Been playing runescape on and off since 2001 I feel you brother

This is a very underrated post and something Jagex should seriously be thinking about. Jagex uses Glassdoor to post job postings looking for developers. It's not like someone just randomly registered Jagex onto GlassDoor and the employees found it, no, Jagex has control of their Glassdoor account and uses it for job postings. Their companies working environment is being detailed as depressing, toxic and micro-managed for future developers to see. No developer wants to work in that type of environment unless they do not have a choice. Most developers who do not have a choice are developers who are either bad or very new to the industry and Jagex will probably be their first job. Either way- this is not the type of developer I would want creating content for the only game that makes my company money.
---
Yes fucking please, the new models look comical and do not fit with the whole oldschool aesthetic that we all love.
---
Cast this spoiler ridden post into the depths of hell.
---
Ok. Can they be safe spot ranged?
---
Prefer to drink and wc. Fishing is just wc without profit. Plus fishing is just afk enough to be boring but too afk to turn your back because next thing you know youre at the login scree
---
Ouch.
---
Says more about you than me fam, that's not what I meant.
---
Every hit above 50 is rolled between 45 and 50. Either way tbow is way better ofc
---
People are consistently getting mvp 1.5ticking with a crystal pick so I think it's safe to assume the mining portion has a very large weighting.
---
The problem is when achievements get diminished so much that they're no longer achievements. Not neccassarily the case with this item but I deffinatly would rather runescape stay grindy personally. That's what I have always enjoyed about the game. Meaningful slow progression. Then again people enjoy different things. I just don't want the game to cater too much to people who can't play a lot cause that's how you end up with dailies and high exp skill training.
---
Finding random good items in general stores was the absolute shit. Even sometimes normally stocked items for some shops.  I remember back in like 2006 the scimitar shop in Al kharid had a mithril scimitar I think as the highest tier they had and it was always sold out.
---
One day I went there and saw a single mithril scimitar there I freaked out and I too wanted to jump from my chair lmao
---
Even that Addy med helm in barbarian village was exciting as shit to finally get ahold of
---
Ha! Jokes on you! I turned 30 a few days ago!!!!!!
---
whats ironic
---
They aren't going to make two storage modes based on a non trading account. Rs3 went on for ages with hard content without item reclaimers, also sorry if you can't make 5m/hr that's just slow raids that any 2-5 man team can hit. You can make 3-4m/hr at vorkath, you can make 2-3m/hr at zulrah, and you can make more than 5m/hr at raids 2.  Not losing gear is boring, is risk less, and doesn't allow players to actively think about what they are doing.
---
why.... why is Mod Ash a goat?
---
I mean black d hide, glory, barrows gloves etc, isn't great risk, but isn't that just the nature of pvp? Minimizing your own risk while maximizing potential returns?
---
still a noob
---
Hey thanks for stopping by! In regards to tick eating and prayer flicking, I feel like they’re hard enough to do that it justifies using them in pvm challenges. Also they keep adding more and more gold sinks into the game so that’s something that’s already being implemented in the game (duel arena task, gold sink events, crystal crown)
---
That's cool. In America more black families are torn apart by the criminal justice system than were torn apart by slavery and blacks are prosecuted more than whites even when controlling for poverty disparities and crime rates.
---
try to be smart and look more foolish
---
Well obviously if he said it like that he’s not where you’re from lmao.
---
Hey man I’m not trying to dampen your experience but it might be best to remove yourself from the game. Since release of osrs you’ve spent 1/6 of your life online and although it can make you happy, there’s very few things in life worth spending 1/6th of it on.
---
I’m sure what you’ve accomplished in the game is absolutely amazing but eventually man nobody but you will remember the grind you put in.
---
Always wondered why jagex never made it so you could change your dominant hand for weapons can’t imagine it being hard kinda pisses me off being right handed in game
---
Patch it so it's too far left
---
Runelite is cheesing. @me.
---
I know it's satire but you don't really need to spend that much money to enjoy audio. HD 650s + Schiit Jotunheim sounds great to me. Massdrop HD 6XX and a cheap amp/DAC like a Fiio E10K sounds pretty good too and can be had for less than I paid for my Jotunheim.

Bruh, all you sweaty ass motherfuckers are voting for your own selfish interests with no regard for game integrity too lmao, don't get it twisted

You have a lot to learn about the world, my friend. Most 20s-30s are lucky to be making that. The rest are educated.

The RS3 one looks nicer.
---
When have we EVER voted in our own selfish interests? It sounds like a lot of the people on reddit are just trying to get themselves the maximum reward for minimum effort. Us elitists at least put in the work to deserve what we earn.

The average player isn't sitting there grinding raids or Vorkath. Plus, in a situation where you're cleaned, you're not going to be farming ToB or Vork.

For the average player, it's 2m/hr.

GUYS swampletic just got 99 hunter!! [😎](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-sunglasses/)
---
Yeah I agree. My point is that people who want the game to be easier/ to hand them "the difficult achievements" don't understand what kind of game Runescape is at heart.
---
"I'm not a neckbeard goblin who wastes 10 hours a day on this game"

The thing is though, a huge portion of players are exactly those goblins, and flexing how big of a goblin you are is part of the fun
---
What? No matter how bad the room layout is you can easily get T1 armor, 2 T3 weapons and ~15 pieces of food by 8 mins max, which is all you need to comfortably kill the boss. In over 100 clears I have died to the boss maybe 4-5 times and those have all been because of my own mistakes. 
---
I'm talking about the regular Gauntlet, not the corrupted version.

imagine going to a subreddit where a tv show is really popular in the community, then before the next episode is released someone spoils the climax of the next episode.
---
Is this not obvious?
---
I like how they were relegated to nezzyland. Too many of them in close proximity looks like I'm playing a Disney game
---
Isn't that the whole point of voting? To get a consensus of what people want for their own personal experience?
---
Remember when raids 1 armor failed and everyone on reddit said the game was going to die? People love the game how it is and dont want it to change, if a third of the community doesnt want it, then it's for the best to leave it out. The type of people who voted no will probably be playing longer than the rest of you anyways. Stop acting like the polling system which has worked since day 1 is broken because you didnt get what you want.
---
&gt; cheeky
---
&gt; on the shitter 
---
Ha
---
I believe so. Really not worth doing though, imo
---
Probably not, which sucks because they absolutely butchered a few NPCs. The models on the elf warriors/iorwerth with the glowing armor are especially terrible, completely ruined the aesthetic of lletya with the unnatural colors and models that look like they came straight out of rs3.
---
If I knew they were going to model the NPCs and Priffdinas off the rs3 version I would've voted no to the quest, despite the fact I enjoyed the story and the gameplay. It starts - well, really, continues - a bad precedent of just lazily copying over rs3 content without adapting it to oldschool.
---
Can you please not compare a good youtuber to pineapple pizza? 🤮🤮🤮

Jokes on you, I'm in my late 20s
---
What's your melee armor? If you've got fighter torso and obby legs (or obby chest if you absolutely refuse to do BA), then I'd work on saving for zenytes. Personally, I'd go anguish, torture, tormented, then suffering, unless you're planning on doing Zulrah, in which case I'd bump suffering up to first or second on that list. After that, if you're at 70 def by that point, I'd upgrade the mystics to Ahrim's.
---
I was thinking about this yesterday. I recently started a combat account again after 12 years off and on exclusively Skilling. I'm at 85 combat after a month and a half w/ 188 qp, which back in the day took me 1.5-2 years to obtain. It will never be the same :(
---
1) Jagex is a game studio that only has only created 2 successful games. OSRS and RS3. They have failed to ever create a game that was not Runescape. This is very bad. Meaning if OSRS or RS3 fails then the company fails. They should be looking to create other games as well but it seems like they either do not have the talent to do it or they have decided putting all their eggs in the Runescape basket and hope it never fails. It seems they have went with the latter. If that's the case then Jagex needs to put more focus on developing the game long term and not so short term. That includes developing a good work/life balance for the devs and less micro-managing. Start hiring better people. Start listening to the GlassDoor reviews. 
---
2) Devs/Designers need to stand up against management and let them know this is not a good environment for them to work in. 
---
3) The community needs to stand behind the devs and let Jagex know we love the game but we do not love the way the company is treating the people who create it for us.
---
I hope this gets more attention, thanks for the links

What’s more sad is you don’t know how to spell borrow.

Actually for 1 out of 1000 people the drop rate is indeed 1/1. Apparently you were that person.

Why Humor flair? Shouldn't it be Bug?

Not really. It sounds like budget tbow arma which is braindead as hell even with dbow and venge. Not having to swap every phase change is relaxing.

That's exactly what happened for the first one though. And the guy tried to milk it by becoming a steamer and everyone realised he was an asshole lol
---
What a stupid fucking comment.
---
I tried to kill it but all the furries are protecting it
---
Why would they think that is a good idea? That’s actually horrible that a “Skilling” boss pet can only be got by the max players on every world who are tick manipulating.
---
29. I feel personally attacked right now
---
ah, nihilism
---
I just did pyramid plunder, just go to the highest level room you can, take everything, do the gold chest last, repeat until desired level. Blackjacking is supposed to be way faster but like you, I could not stand it.
---
until you start raiding
---
same, imo mod gee did just fine
---
If you're gonna get this angry over something like that I think it's time for some self-reflection fam
---
Its not about nostalgia, it's about being consistent with the rest of the games artstyle.
---
Tbh if the game was from 2010-2011 I would of loved that. Or even if the brought most updates from then too i wouldn't be mad.
---
Hey at least that's two more quests out of the way now

Dam bro i remember the welovecorp days

Awww Tysm!!! And yes I do! [My twitter be right here! c:](https://twitter.com/NYChannelRS)
---
They were taking feedbacks from what I heard
---
Mind just ***BLOWN***
---
And?
---
Throws dont do anything for loot potential, only mining the boss.
---
Pretty sure its almost always social engineering
---
Trained with that until I could wear granite
---
how dare you disrespect zyzz, you motherfucker
---
yes it is, that and the fact so much loot drops when you are cannoning and you miss which items dropped where because they're on the same pile. why the elitism ? it's a simple quality of life
---
The tick stuff is questionable, but I can't say I mind the pet being MVP only. It is not unreasonable for a Skilling boss to behave like a boss and with most bosses, the player who does the most damage gets the loot, which includes the pet chance. If the tick manipulation is addressed and the initial hype dies down, I think this would be far less of an issue than it is right now.
---
Surprised but happy to see Zulu is against being able to 1.5t on Zalcano.
---
Why did you initial it?
---
You got to get more patches. I make more than 40k a run doing snapdragons, unless I have a crazy amount of deaths
---
Is RuneScape still for kids anymore that's the real wake up call.
---
lol $21 is shit. Interns I knew made $35 an hour
---
How did you get your screen that clean? The size is perfect
---
Clearly you don't have kids, if you are uneducated you're probably better just keeping your mouth shut next time.
---
Seems unintended. Maybe tweet one of the mods to see if it was an integrity change or not?
---
? what do you mean

I think ur awesome :)

It looks like the mods have been watching YouTube makeup tutorials and tried to sneak that in.

Until now the only people I had seen who hated the 1.5tick mechanics where those who just couldn't do it

This is actually awesome, since I am an avid Doom player! I've played it for 24-25 years, starting with Doom (1993) and Doom 2!
---
Rip and tear until it's done!
---
Oh shit, I've been misled elsewhere. I guess that technically makes OP's situation even better though. Thanks for the info though, the mechanics behind this boss's loot are pretty interesting.
---
The lunar staff requires you pay for another one on death, so there is precedent here. But having to do another run is a bit much, there should just be another fee to get another one as it is with the lunar staff.
---
...D'arby?
---
You can stick to cows if you like as they’re very weak and decent to train on. What I would recommend however is that you train your strength up to around the same level as your attack as quickly as possible! 
---
Higher strength allows you to hit larger numbers of damage which in turn gives you quicker xp when you’re training melee stats - it would speed up your training significantly. But yeah, overall cows should do fine for you for now.
---
This is speculation FYI, but there have been numerous times I've gotten MVP by just waiting next to the boss to mine while everyone else was running to get more ore to throw.
---
Yea. I'm currently on 5. There is 7 max correct?
---
I also have the hosidius favor protect.
---
Well I grinded all 99's except Fishing and Hunter before I quit and was 126 before Slayer but still got 99 Slayer right away lol. Maybe 1 other non 99 too I can't remember. So I'm no stranger to the grind. 
---
I'll definitely look into that chronicle though. But I did notice energy potions are free to play now, and I got 37 Magic like straight away. Definitely missing 99 Agility though. Thanks for the tip.
---
It's just with 5 patches I seem to do better with toadflax.

She is hostile towards ANY comment she gets. Even suggestions from level headed commenters. 
---
Fuck her and the horse she rode in on.
---
There's like 10 patches lol
---
If my end goal for now is 30 attack, should I just stick to attack? Or would it be any faster if I start training up strength right now? I do plan on building those up, but for now I want to improve my ability to afk my other stats.
---
Yep I have a little one as well and osrs is the easiest to play.  For the first time in years I dont play anything other than rs because I'm constantly needed at random moments.  Love the game for its ease of access and things to do!

This is true, but the event is so unexpected and sudden and none of it is really explained at all. It doesnt let on much.

---
"valuable drops" somewhere in your tools menu, it's got a lightbulb icon
---
&gt; You need to define WHAT oldschool is.
---
I think it's a lot of small details that are added which make it look out of place. If you look at all older models, you won't see eyebrows unless it's on a chathead, chathead eyelids were never a thing and the shading is a bit over the top on newer models too.
---
It's understandable that an artist would habitually try to make something look good, but the reality of OSRS is that it doesn't look "good" per se, it looks old. Adding shading, eyelids, eyebrows, all these small details make it look "new" and therefore *not oldschool enough*. I'd probably argue that if she stopped designing the elf half way through the process it would have probably fit better.
---
Move to an oilfield city and bang out a job at McDonald's.
---
Got a goal in mind or just kinda going for it?
---
Sold my crystal tool seed for 31m. Would not be surprised if uniques required MVP as well and don't see that staying the case for long.
---
There's public documents for that kinda thing. I'd link but I'm on mobile.

Since when has construction been tedious? It's super fast, it just costs alot. Runecrafting on the other hand... Ugh it's terrible! But yeah, do it in smaller chunks. Decide "I'll do x amount of xp and then I'll reward myself with sth fun"
---
But you kinda just have to do it. Agility can be done on a second monitor while you watch a movies or sth. Same w/ construction, you just have to put the client always on top and keep 1 pressed while doing oak dungeon doors, easy 450-550k xp/ hour so you'll get that 99 within like 10 movies.
---
I've been driving manuals all my life. I'm just objectively comparing the amount of work one is to the other. I agree you get a sort of memory for doing it, but that doesn't change the fact that in traffic, manual is far more work
---
Checkmate, im 19
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake. 
---
If it didnt negatively affect the others in your game, then 1.5ting the boss wouldnt be a problem. It would only impact your own, personal rewards and rates. Which is how really any activity in this game scales, with effort and engagement.
---
crystal chest if u dont wanna trade items
---
I miss the huge social element this game used to have
---
What city
---
Runecrafting should be higher imo
---
RuneCraft for sure. What better way to memorialize a depressing slow grind to death than RC.
---
RC BAD
---
I guess they should change that clue scroll to say "in the centre of the iorwerth camp" instead.
---
How does runelite use of resources more efficiently?
---
About 16 years ago, somebody gave me probably 500k worth of rune equipment when I was a low lvl f2p. They were all bank notes, I thought it was trash and worthless, like little notes that tell you what the price of those items was worth. Had no idea I could exchange them for items, so I dropped them on the ground after the guy logged lol.
---
If you're in one of the major cities sure. But not all of California is expensive.
---
Fakin aussies
---
*PC
---
Just watch TV or something on your other monitor
---
Why pay gee if she does such shitty job?
---
I mean, that is how most other bosses work... And I'd expect it would encourage more soloing than massing.
---
That's highly questionable. I'm at 78kc now, I'm maxed but play without tick manipulation. I've gotten MVP 7 of those 78 times, so unless the drop rate is ~10x more common then a 'regular' 1/3000 -1/5000 boss pet rate I just don't see how Jagex can justify this. Obviously we don't know the drop rates, but still. Also, I have only managed to get MVP on worlds where I'm the only maxed player or there's only one other. For those with lower stats I would be entirely unsurprised if they wren't able to get MVP consistently at all.
---
Probably even lower than that. I make just over $40/hour and I'm salaried.
---
Metropolis
---
why ?
---
For con the best way is to do 2 teak park benches at once. Build &gt; build &gt; remove &gt; remove
---
Settings &gt; 3rd tab from the top where you change display name &gt; lightbulb (loot options)
---
That's the issue. It needs to be fixed for this update then for future updates as well. I'm scared that since they already did the work for this they will ignore it and continue on with this as their "oopsie". I don't want this permanent sore in the game.

Compared to other [iconic OSRS capes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/d/d8/Fletching_cape%28t%29_detail.png/37px-Fletching_cape%28t%29_detail.png?b6df6), it doesn't fit in at all.
---
I could go on, and on, showing all the new things added to OSRS that don't fit. That do not keep to the same art style. I could go into NPCs and mobs too, but there are far too many examples I could bring forward. I think the few I have are enough to prove my point:
---
Having new content look *better* or *different* than the "oldschool" art style is not a new concept. Things "not fitting in" happen all the time. Look at ore rocks. Half of the ore rocks in the game use a plain, single-color model consisting of four prisms. The other half are rocks with veins of ore embedded into the rock. They both look just fine because we're used to seeing it. They are both "oldschool" because they've been like that for as long as we can remember.
---
I am not saying that you cannot criticize it, however, I am saying that if you give it time, you'll get used to it. It doesn't mean you'll like it, just like I don't like how inconsistent the ore rocks are, but you will get over it, and it won't bother you as much anymore.
---
My biggest and only complaint about the new elves is that they're purple. Not because purple is overused, but because it clearly tries to paint them as "different". Typical tribalism mentality. Different skin color = bad.
---
Why can't we keep it ambiguous? Why not keep the elves just called "elves", and their color and models looking similar to their "enemies", but with a purple symbol, or trimming to their armor as a way for them to tell who is friend or foe?
---
I agree, but would argue the current top rates are way too high.
---
Just got back to playing after a long time away. I have no idea what to do. I have absoutely 0 money, but I have good enough armour (fighter torso and rune) and a dragon scimitar to at least fight things. 66 combat and other skills in the 40-50 range. I have a months worth of members after selling all my stuff on rs3. What should I do to get myself back in the game?
---
Sorry I know this gets asked a lot.
---
I'm 80 mage and got out with 1 sara dose left, that fight was nerv-racking
---
I never did, however I also saw you advocating for a nerf so I wanted to counter it as I don't believe it needs one and when people said otherwise you went back onto it being on principle which I can understand. I just wanted to clarify for people in your topic as well as in general that the content doesn't have anything wrong with it and if anything it's underpowered but I didn't intend to take away from your topic that it should have been polled.
---
Average Runelite user over here...

I miss this &lt;/3

People like you are going to kill the game.

its been confirmed mvp gets pet
---
When you're creeping in an automatic, you're in gear, and as soon as you apply accelerator you start moving. Being in gear ready to respond if somebody comes flying up on your ass is an important safety precaution. So that either means you're feathering and/or holding in the clutch to prevent the engine from stalling out, or you're switching to neutral, which removes that extra degree of control that being in gear provides
---
been confirmed now
---
it is

Not very! It doesn't take long to learn to take no damage during parts of the kill where no minions have spawned. The hard part is the minions, if they aren't killed quickly they will start to mess you up. In most cases, as long as you're praying against the proper boss attacks, sharks are enough to out-eat the minion damage.
---
I use Viggora's Chainmace along with my best melee gear possible. There are no great crush spec weapons to use so I just use a dds (and it helps me get to the boss to slash webs).
---
Nice try Jiggleflox but we see you trying to RS3 us all over again.
---
It’s quite obvious by the title, the chat and my comments here though lol.
---
If you're, say, 80 mining, the people you're doing the activity with can completely change the level of loot you get without you changing a thing. Your loot is, essentially, relative to those in the game with you.
---
Cool, not bad.
---
I am going for first cape myself, so thats why I asked.
---
I only have 45 def tho, same range level, but less prayer.
---
Hopefully doesnt take me too many more tries!
---
What was the hardest part? Did you watch a lot of guides?
---
Less is more
---
Lol
---
I heard you can use Android on the switch, so you can play os mobile. However, I also heard you cannot use the joysticks with it.

I think doing tiaras is faster if you haven't ruined your account.

Thanks, I guess I will get started as I am 75/77/75 and 80 hp.
---
Another question if you don't mind: is the berserker necklace recommended or essential to this obsidian setup (is the bonus dmg much better than the lowering of accuracy?)
---
Also does this mean I need absorbtions and overloads?
---
Thanks man, appreciate it.
---
how is ragging against the rules? dude is playing the game within the boundaries of what is allowed regardless if he’s risking much or not.
---
Why you gotta do this bro?
---
Twitter only feedback is an argument for another time (but an important one). The fact is that they didn't poll these changes and they are so drastic that it puts the integrity of the polling system and the game into question. Many players didn't know such a major rework was in the making and when they did it was too late to change because the art team had already spent so much time on it they didn't care for legitimate feedback.
---
Now we are here, trying to compromise something that should have never been an issue if they just followed the polling system or had a feedback system to reach all the small communities that make up the osrs community.
---
I want a mailbox pet xD xD pls joglexx

---
i would bet the vast majority of people that drive don't care about driving, they just want to get where they want to go.
---
Just riffin' on the idea of a red panda pet and taking it five steps too far to give some peeps laughs if i can :)
---
Same, rewards my laziness
---
Naturally.
---
The one on the right is better. Sue me.
---
&gt;The only factors that could seemingly contribute are that im using a rune pick,
---
rune pick is same as dragon if you are 1.5t
---
&gt;Having a points system or participation counter similar to wintertodt or pest control would be extremely nice to be able to actually gauge performance and have a concrete number to compare my loot towards. As for now, all you can do is count boss mines/throws and even that does not seem to be an accurate representation.
---
sure agree,
---
&gt;so that we're literally not just taking shots in the dark for random amounts of loot.
---
i mean its not hard, you just 1.5t the rock and throw a few of the things at the boss depending on teamsize. if you do this properly you get mvp.
---
Yeah most people here haven’t even done the quest so I’m not going to listen to their baseless opinions on the chat heads being the worst part about it. There’s 4 battles and 2 boss fights all of which are more fun than moving mirrors around an enormous room for literally 2 hours at a minimum if you’re not using a guide in my opinion. If you really like solving puzzles I guess it could be your favorite part but most people will just follow a guide which makes it even more boring (still takes like an hour and a half at least with a guide probably). People saying they couldn’t enjoy the quest because of the chatheads is beyond ridiculous though, like the chatheads could be better but everything else in the quest was incredible, even the light puzzle which was imo the worst part about it.
---
Haha
---
They had us in the first half not gunna lie
---
Touché ironmeme. Touché

Well for me the hardest part was when the healers spawned. I watched one guide, i think it was by evscape just do get an idea of what gear to use, but after you know what monsters come when, its a breeze up until jad. My clanmates gave me really good advice. When the healers spawn, right after you flick for jad, start attacking one. Then watch jad and keep flicking till its dead. If you have to move, dont try and run around, just click once and get back to your prayers. As long as jad doesnt get back to full health, youre golden.
---
Iron or steel gloves as well
---
It is the best, for a obby mauler pure with no membership.
---
Holy shit. Thanks for the tip.
---
Mobile disagrees with you
---
Hell even the people that played 2008+ would still hate oldschool as the graphics are a big downgrade to what they were used too
---
the worst one I had was the final 4 unopened rooms had both the beast I needed
---
The beauty of osrs.
---
AFAIK, corrupted has nothing to do with crack the clue.
---
So obviously the loot table is pretty strong. At the same time, the xp isnt great. It'd be nice if they balanced it out a bit more. I'm actually fine that the mvp is rewarded with more loot, but like I said, I think the loot table is too strong currently.    
---
    
---
Another change I'd like to see is that the pet is rolled for everyone who gets loot instead of just the mvp. Just feels like a waste of time to do it if your not 1.5 ticking it.     
---
All in all, I like the boss. I would just weaken the loot table, up the xp a little, give everyone who gets loot a pet roll, and still give the mvp better loot (from the weakened table obviously).
---
It's not that the head is tiny, they've given it those exaggerated body proportions (huge v-shaped torso, broad shoulders, tiny waist) that you see in other games like WoW, or RS3. Doesn't belong in oldschool
---
Yes I do! It just came out the other day.
---
Runelite doesn't have freeze timers anymore as far as I'm aware. 
---
Tile marker (the thing that shows the tile you're running to, not the plugin that permanently marks tiles) should 100% be a toggle on the official client though. It's almost required for some pvm where you have to be tick perfect combined with all the animation delay.
---
Lolll
---
i really liked doing some diaries to get back into things! start from the bottom and work your way up, the diaries typically involve every skill so you get a bit of it all
---
dont force ironman mode on non irons imo.
---
i like that my divine pots are untradable because i choose to play ironman mode. some people dont want to, thats fine.
---
To be fair, I watched someone kill it yesterday and then I followed them to the GE where they told me it sold for 2.5m. 
---
People are making a quick buck, it's just not AS much as people think.
---
Cool, that sounds smart to put clicks together, less chance of fucking up.
---
Someone said using chins on the healers is really good.
---
Understanding the different monsters and safespots seems like the hard part to me, honestly jad doesnt seem to bad, the healers part seem tough tho.
---
Thanks
---
God I remember getting 1,500gp and I bought a staff in Varrock not really knowing what it was, I thought I was balling
---
obv dat off is nfs :P
---
So frost dragons and bonfire?
---
Uh oh
---
yeah maybe, i did about 10 attempts getting the t2 armor and was not able to find enough time to get the t3 weapons
---
with the t1 i always get 2 t3 weps and i usually have a little bit of time before the boss to kind of cool off and shake off the rushing feeling
---
tradeble pls and droprate of 3rd age
---
Fucking agree, this is exactly my gripe. They looked like wood-elves before and I had no idea they were the bad guys at first.
---
Very nice, are you keeping track of your loot since the beginning? If so, how much have you made?
---
IT'S PERFECT!
---
Hmmmm, sounds like they gave a monkey a keyboard and let it run wild in java. 
---
"Lets make a boss where you can have 300 KC but 0 chance for pet, and 1.5Ting lowers everyone elses rewards pool."
---
"Yeah good idea, I really like giving everyone a drop but none of those roll for the pet!"
---
Mobile just brought back people that don't have time to sit at a computer. The second statement is just an opinion. The majority of my playtime with membership was the 2008-2009 high detail era. It's basically the same.
---
Yea, the purple skin really ruins the model for me. Hell, at this rate, RS3 Iorwerth elves look more oldschool simply because they don't have that damn purple skin
---
V
---
Those exaggerated WoW-like proportions don't belong in this game
---
Fuck sake man he even bought a warrior helm, absolute man of the match performance from this guy
---
It's enjoyable, it just takes too long. More fun than 30+ mass.
---
In that case the answer is "Yes, it happened in 2014"
---
Lol I know. That’s the joke.
---
The red October’s vs new balances was a nice touch.
---
I'd argue that they're meant to look abnormal and otherworldly, as they are elves, not humans. They even come from Tarddiad, not Gielinor, as said in the quest so it's actually and improvement to make them look different I'd say. Just because it looks like it was shoved through ms pain doesn't mean it's "preserving the old school style". Not once did I say the old school "style" was so ugly but it'd be silly to say that they new design doesn't look better without using your nostalgia goggles.
---
Why do so many people call it 'zulcano'? I see this everywhere, and it doesn't make sense to me. It's zalcano with an A, and it's not even like the word volcano has a U in it. Where does the U come from?!
---
Took me 4 tries. But my excuse is that I was one of the people doing it on release and i had no guide to go off of. between not knowing what to pray, what to attack with and the 1 hit mechanic i was shook.
---
Stats affect how high you hit both when throwing and when mining.  Of course that makes a huge difference when it comes to damage and mvp.
---
&gt; i mean its not hard, you just 1.5t the rock and throw a few of the things at the boss depending on teamsize. if you do this properly you get mvp.
---
Thats not guaranteed anymore when multiple are tick manipulating on pretty much every world. Most people tick manipulating are already trying to find a world where they're the only one tick manipulating so that they can farm MVPs.
---
Either way, I don't really care too much about MVP. If that fucks me out of pet rolls, fine, I'll sweat later for it when the boss dies down. I shouldn't have to tick manipulate for not shit loot when almost nobody else is.
---
wtf why are they reworking oldschool npcs?????? this is fucked, why are they changing oldschool monsters and npcs and changing their graphics? wtf?
---
Saw a meme earlier, thought it was RS3 rune
---
That's some rs3 shit
---
Imagine thinking that most of the features of Runelite are fair.
---
Haxclient
---
Agree but the casual player shouldnt be punished for not 3-ticking.
---
People on this sub just recently learned with the chat heads that complaining about stuff not looking oldschool is something they can do, so they're trying to explore that new complaining territory as much as possible, even when it doesn't fit. It's like learning a new word and over using it or learning some psych 101 and over analyzing.
---
i just dont understand the logic
---
He he
---
Do you have any idea how expensive game development is? And how hard it is to compete. Show some respect to the hard work people are doing. Every programmer gets underpaid but they do the job anyway because they have a passion. And if you can't pay 11 euro a month you can't afford to waste any minute on this game
---
I need this..
---
Wholesome as heck. I always find it funny how I have friends my age who genuinely are like "wow waste your time more" but spend every weeknight going home, scrolling social media and watching Netflix or reality tv shows for hours. We all have our leisure time and we spend it to relax 
---
I don't get endlessly scrolling Instagram or Facebook, but I also totally see how it's just "switch off" time for them. Runescape is that for me, it's a destressing tool.
---
I'll just let our debate over who's voting selfishly go. I think we each have our biases and there are selfish voters in each groups.
---
And I fucking love when retarded skillers think PKers don't skill. Some of them are downright mentally deficient imo. They have that obnoxiously strong bias which is why they think 2k worlds are free of PKers. That's why clans camping the skill total worlds on release of revs uniques was the best.
---
I don't care about PvP since I'm a PvMer, but I hate how everyone spite votes against it.

One thing I've realized getting older is that the sooner you stop judging yourself for *doing things you enjoy* the happier you are. I went through that shit at 30, but remember to do what makes you happy.

It should be .50 for every million donation. Not just by rank 1!
---
Don't delete this comment. I'm willing to bet more than a few people here need to see this. The hugboxing affirmation that "it's not a waste of time if you're enjoying what you're doing" (while mostly correct) can mask genuinely unhealthy habits and keep people from realizing that they need to make a change. 
---
It's not even a matter of playing "too much" in many cases, but what brings you back. The allusion of progress is addictive.

Ya you may see people pop up at the bank to grab some more brews and stam pots but thats about it. I hate myself for losing my graceful a while back so ive been back at the agility courses recently to get that stuff back lol!

Completely without defense above 20 or 42/45 could also be argued as “pure” in that case.
---
If you skill a lot, you can finish Song of the Elves and do Zalcano. If you have 43 prayer, you can do Zulrah. Those are my 2 money makers (also don't have a main).

Pretty interesting actually. Thanks for the post!
---
You shouldn’t have a problem with those stats and that gear as long as you understand the mechanics and aren’t afraid to give it a few tries. Just make sure you’re using a salve ei. If you don’t have it just spend the time in NMZ now and get it. It’s huge for vorkath now and post quest for getting your assembler and camping for money.
---
The quest version already has 50 less defense levels than post quest so DWH and BGS aren’t super important for the quest if you can’t afford them.
---
Use the DPS calc to see if you should be using d hide or regular void.

Early 20s for the win

I'm not a developer so I don't know the stats. But many people have reported better performance from 3rd party clients than from  the official one. Best to Google search it yourself.

I miss this too. D bones were only 1.5k too. The days
---
Disagree. It gets borinng if you binge. But if you occasionally get on its a release, relaxing, and fun
---
I agree with Zxv975, and imo having the different skin colours make it much easier to follow along. Its hard to differentiate between who is who when most of the models previously looked so similar (though I understand from your pov it makes sense to have them look the same).  Maybe a simpler change like different outfits would be a nice inbetween?
---
Doods no like
---
I lived with car fanatics for a whole year and they would constantly argue which is better lol
---
What else are you supposed to do on a long flight or at work?
---
Castle Wars was better when nobody really knew what they were doing, in like 2006 or so
---
No it's not. In both those scenarios you listed, the player has died multiple times, therefore is playing poorly and deserves to be punished. In the actual example being discussed, the player's playstyle is not actually relevant, because they are consistently be doing the same thing but getting different rewards based on the presence (or lack thereof) of neighbouring players. The player is essentially getting getting soft-crashed, because a player with better gear / levels / skill *lowers* the player's loot simply with their presence. 
---
This is fundamentally different to CoX, where the presence of other players does not affect your long term loot *at all*. It's similar to ToB MVP system where stronger players taking MVP from you lowers your loot, but whether that's a good system and should be the norm for group content moving forward is exactly the debate being had. I'm personally not a fan of MVPs and believe there are healthier ways to promote engagement.
---
Real talk though did he make 80 or 90k in loot?
---
You disagree that the person who doesn't get bored of the game after a couple weeks does NOT like the game more than the person who does?
---
