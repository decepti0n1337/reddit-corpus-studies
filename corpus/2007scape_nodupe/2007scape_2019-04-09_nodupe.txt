Arceuus teleport to salve river, you can make teletabs for them its what I used before qp cape teleport.
---
---
---
Lmfao
---
I was ready for the flip over to dozens of orange foil crabs
---
Wouldn't even make it over 25% yes as a skill. A majority of players hate PvP would never want to have to level it to get a max cape so no way it would ever pass.
---
How many kills did you already have when switching to rigour? 
---
It‚Äôs possible what your seeing is just getting better at the boss ?
---
You probably buy gold.
---
collect stuff for cook's assistant and do that and sheep sheerer for 2qp.
---

---
kill some cows (maybe a dozen each?) for cowhides to sell.
---
Do romeo and juliet for 5qp. You need 7qp to sell cowhides.
---
Buy iron armor set and scimitar and some trout.
---
Do stronghold
---
This is exactly what I mean :) thanks pal
---
Salve river teleport on the necromancy book. Can make teletabs of them too.
---
Have you tried watching every settled video again?

It's a valid comment, as someone with a 2k+ total uim

Nah.

That doesn't answer the question at all
---
I transitioned ingame thanks to the makeover mage. Then irl I transitioned a few months ago. RS helped me discover myself in a way I never knew was possible.
---
Im not super involved in runescape, but wasn't that stuff mostly a joke? Like I can't imagine the Majority of people doing it weren't just trolling
---
I normally don‚Äôt have a problem with dialogue, but so much of it on osrs is just silly banter that doesn‚Äôt add to the lore of the quest in any way.
---
I'd LOVE to have the runes. As well as a character dressed with flowers, a beret, villager sandles, etc.. that skiller look üòç
---
I incrementally run around like a nut job killing imps for their champion scroll. I have a few in the bank but my philosophy is if I can't get an imp one, I'm not farming the rest of them. 5000 imp kills is just F'd. I wonder what people think when they see a dude running around in full bandos smacking imps with an abyssal bludgeon.
---
Nice
---
this is me currently. I am in the early parts of the game, most stats are around 40 base and I am having so much fun, I know once i get further down the road
---
I‚Äôm another guy, I feel like you keep going back to damage. Like you‚Äôre treating all 3 corners of the triangle the same. Magic is particularly strong compared to the other corners due to utility. It stuns and it teleblocks. To make up for this obviously it‚Äôs harder to hit with and the good gear for it is pricey. There is a reason the mage prayers have mage defense as an added benefit. Jagex didn‚Äôt just drool and throw that it for fun. You‚Äôre supposed to splash quite a bit.

&gt;I workout around 10-12 hours a week
---
&gt;I barely worked your minimum when I was (just) on test.
---
&gt;Wtf does I barely worked your minimum when I was on test mean? That's 40-50 hours a week
---
You understand that I mean testosterone when I say test. You somehow do not understand what working your minimum while on performance enchancers could possibly mean? You'd even remotely think that it means working a job? Are you truly that dumb? Well, of fucking course you are, wasting your time training and not getting the results you could be getting. And lmao for assuming I train for mass for some reason!
---
Post a fit, you dyel! Although I can already imagine your weak, insectoid body; I don't even need the actual proof to know.

You have to get it back yourself

It hurts
---
Yeah, I typed that because I hear the same thing from retards constantly. Hardly anyone buys gold in this game, but the amount of people who accuse each other of doing so (even though you can make unlimited money with zero talent in this game) is truly staggering. Tell me about me mum's credit card m8.

im linking your vid to friends of mine so we can help you make that dislike bar bigger

&gt;Ballista spec -&gt; dragon thrownaxe spec can absolutely stack near 90 damage

Have fun trying that once a fight. Do you spec tab lmao? Still lower than what's possible from mage.

Msb into a melee doesn't have nearly the ko potential, which is, you know, what stacking is for.

To clarify for people who don't know about it: cleaning specimen in Varrock museum has a slim chance of yielding a xp lamp. Not sure what the exact rates are, but you barely get a few 1000 xp/h.

Raiding you're doomed to going shadow bolt spec and pressing your shadow bolt key until the boss is dead I'm afraid. Same as mages. I've never raided much though and am more looking forward to all the world PvP :)

Teleport to PoH. Always keep home close with a pin.

How much gold would I have made from Barb Fishing to 99?

Are you actually stupid you dont even understand what I said.

&amp;#x200B;

you need 75 defense and 75 attack for dhins. You ALSO need 75 range for blowpipe at revenants. putting you at a level where maxed mains can sneak your shit. 
---
You are just angry somebody called you out for being toxic on reddit and are justifying your horrifying behavior with DHINS OP THO LOL.

Same reason why an Obby cape you can get from the GE cheaply is better than a Legend's Cape that has way harder requirements; nobody important enough cares about stat balancing...

(but on an unrelated note, RS3 actually buffed the Legend's Cape with a recent update for combat integrity)

Damage itself isn't the issue, it's the actual design of encounters that hinders Magic.

Don‚Äôt forget to trim their first set of armor for them in a week or so.

A YouTube video about it got popular and now it‚Äôs nearly always close to full

Thats a nice chest. Gratz!

We are not increasing damage, only accuracy by prayers.

Nothing else changes but that.

Youre an actual retard and I'd like you to post a video of these many trips with no deaths since you're such a pro at revs, maybe make a tutorial so everyone everywhere can just farm freely and never ever die!!

Alright but even still if i'm wrong, i don't get why playing a mini-game for a small amounts of xp is worse than effigies

Is full only+obby neck and the dagger thing better? I've heard it's super strong for afk because of the % bonus and the inclusion of offhand
---
I mean I'm fine now. But I'll keep that in mind for later.
---
Did that a couple weeks ago, it still stings.
---
you literally described a situation pking at revs, you literally framed this conversation, then moved the goalpost with "but you need more lvls to be attacked by max with dhins".
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts
---
you then moved it again by saying THIS ISN'T ABOUT BLOWPIPE but you are specifically referring to an event of SPECIFIC description BY YOURSELF of YOUR OWN CHOOSING in which BLOWPIPE AND DHINS are both a common pairing, both of which raise total level to about 77, above the threshold to be attacked by max mains.
---
you are a big liar. get the fuck out.

You should area lock this account

I have no idea what's good for pures, I just drew a guy I saw there :P

is there something impressive by this? not an ironman with both of the most OP weapons on you..?

Awesome, I'd really like to catch one when you do. Before I order, the sharks are dual posted right?

2k total is the sweaty af worlds, then you have the dreaded ‚Äúthey who should not be named‚Äù worlds.....the 2.2k worlds.....

Do you use trident for general slayer? Blowpipe? They are all expensive to run. They become worthwhile bossing because the increase in dps makes it worthwhile for the gp/hr

You gave your gear away, entirely your fault.

It‚Äôs not as bad as BA because while you‚Äôre all on a team it‚Äôs just face rolling portals and mobs. No real coordination needed.

That‚Äôs kind of reassuring. Maybe I should start on it tonight.

Thanks for the info!

That's why the item would be inert god essence. Only that gods representatives would be able to make it do anything.

lmao shapiro would shit on you faster 1v1 in the wildy than trump did the liberals in the us
---
Thanks!! You print out your design, apply the foil over it and pass it through a what can be a laminator and the heat bonds the foil to the design so not that complex!

Maybe add a log rack next to the fireplace to keep it lit

LOL

Supposedly there's an impling out there that changes everything...

That's because half the community dwells in the past...around the time that faggot was an appropriate term

Barely with anchovy pizzas. Id just get like 50 melees and use swords if you are a reg. If you are a f2p ironman you can just get 60 melees and use trout/salmon. Make sure you pray range too

Shady. Curious. etc. Must be a regional term if you've never heard it before lol

Kodai wand would be the only meaningful (noticeable) increase in slayer xp and hour for you

it sounded like you were supporting implementing EOC full on into OSRS

not buffing mage armor, if thats all you're saying why bring up EoC?

That sounds like something I might actually be able to do. üòÇ I‚Äôm not a good artist, so maybe I should try it out. Thank you for the explanation!

Oh ok. Is it from bosses or minions

im going to ignore everything you say because of your flair. stick to killing 3000 cave horrors

That sounds like nonsense. I have left runelite running for longer than any person should without any issues. Nvidia card as well.

Oh it's my fault, but I can't think of a good reason why there is no warning on placing valuable items on a surface like you would get for dropping. I lost 30mil for miss clicking a countertop

---
It appears I was somewhat wrong. The accuracy is there but the damage isn't. So it's a matter of dps-calcing whether at your ranged level it's best to use your best ranged armour or void. At higher ranged levels i'd reckon that you'd do better with better armour, and would benefit more from the accuracy boost at lower levels.
---
I mean if that‚Äôs where you first learn it, it sticks. After that you just see it in other contexts as something from runescape

you think its a bad sign?

Yeah bro, lend me 2b in gear bro, i need to get my infernal cape bro. I promise ill give it back. I'm sorry but also not sorry that you got "scammed" you're probably a nice person but you're too nice for your own good.
---
Because time and time again the majority gets what they want and the 25% or less get nothing. That‚Äôs a problem that exists in these polls and all democratic systems. Again, it‚Äôs called tyranny of the majority. It‚Äôs selfish because in a direct vote like this there is no compromise, it‚Äôs all or nothing, and the minority walks away with nothing every time. It‚Äôs selfish because this is a suggestion for that takes a minority of content development time, maybe 3 man hours at the modt, and you say it‚Äôs not worth it because it doesn‚Äôt benefit most people.
---
The problem is you have majority rule but you dont have protection of minority rights (sounds like politics but think in the terms of osrs). Consider someone who only plays runescape because he likes BA. How does ANY update that doesn‚Äôt affect BA benefit him? You have to make compromises in order to keep the integrity of the system.
---
Better to duo/trio Sara or bandos gwd? We are all looking to learn it. What would be easier and how would we going about it. I tried looking around for info. Didn't find anything super helpful. Thx bb in advance

Yeah definitely no vote manipulation going on here
---
Not to mention magic is the easiest to get up.
---
You can literally splash with 0 effort for hours on end with 1 click every 20 minutes (nmz is far more effort) or alch. Then you unlock bursting.

Magic shouldn't be equal in power to melee and range precisely bc it's so easy to get to 95+

exactly that is all thank you.

Can anyone tell me the best F2P gear?

Roughly how much magic xp does one get from getting bones to peaches?

OK just do the above on your phone with mobile RS, it was mainly made for pre-mobile (and if you want to do other things with your phone since it only needs 1 click every 20 minutes).

Rip the suspense of Swampletics.  ToB would've been such a huge payoff for the series not knowing whether or not they would succeed and how many tries it would take.  
---
Congrats for you and your team, but I feel like you kind of spoiled Settleds entire idea behind Swampletics.
---
This sounds scary. Come back to the good life of adblock
---
IMO that‚Äôs a slight change and I still think the person ranging would do more damage in that situation because of the combat triangle. Range beats mage regardless simply due to how they‚Äôre deigned
---
Well, his casts take 3 seconds, your bow is 1.8 seconds and in terms of pure fighting your bow is more accurate too. He has zero ko potential ever and you have a range/2h stack

Are they scams? I thought they were just gambling dice bots? I've seen some of them draw pretty big crowds that were definitely not "in on it"
---
To be fair, this run isn't 100% according to my restrictions. I won't be using super combat potions, they're unrealistic. Space has to be sacrificed for things like herblore secondaries, medallion, coins, ghostspeak amulet, which was not accounted for in this run. Along with this, they traded runes between each other throughout the run. It's really cool to see don't get me wrong, but it's not the real thing.

The Ectofuntus has no quest requirements.

The more people you have the faster the kills will go so its better to trio. Only slight issue with that is if you manage to get a drop its a lower split. I would suggest you guys do Bandos using this [guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilhjoPIove0)

I remember the first time I learned about pest control years and years ago and thinking "wow wtf there's a ton of different monsters and portals and different color portals and they open at different times what a mess this is too complicated" and then I finally tried it and I was like "oh it was all a ruse and it's just an AFK slapfest"
---
For real, people gotta get thrown in
---
Exactly. A lot of people keep saying I think it's impossible, but I specifically stated that at the end of the video.
---
Lock wins against both unless rogue has vanish + preparation off cd and a good opener. Dots and fears are OP. Warriors basically get kited and rekt by everything without a pocket healer. 
---
It's another story if you're fighting undead because they basically have a second trinket against locks. For that reason 90% of locks that even semi-seriously PVP will go Horde.
---
&gt;but it's not the real thing.
---
Or is it...?
---
I dont think you have enough DPS for phase 3 Verzik to complete it with a full inventory of brews and infinite purple sweets.
---
lol dont hack me.
---
I was reading that generally karils is better with lower range. Void should only be used with 90+. That's what I remember reading on this sub a couple weeks back. Also, I don't have void :(
---
I've been afking nmz since yesterday and I'm nearing the 650k points for imbuing the ring :)
---
Shhh wait for the next epi
---
So still no actual arguments as to why this should remain. You tried, at least. I'd understand if I was asking for higher XP rates or lowering the skill requirement but you're just being a twat for the sake of it.
---
Like Crumb's harmless trick or treat bot, publicizing something like this is basically encouraging botting. I mean, this post doesn't go as far as Crumb's (i.e. showing some of the code or whatever), and OP isn't as famous. But I wouldn't be surprised.

I mean, I disagree with Jagex, but it is what it is.

I had my main banned once for something similar last year, although they did miss an alt account lol... Be careful

From what I know this used to be a rule way back in the day, but is no longer against the rules.

It's probably faster considering all the cutting time, then burning time, then waiting for burn out and collecting then cutting again

Well in that case shouldnt jagex just add mtx and make it a clone of rs3? I mean you dont have to use spin tickets but dont remove them- because that makes it worse for everyone. This is flawed logic, and self imposing challenge simply makes achievements seem null if undocumented
---
You can get talismans from essence implings

I think he said all accounts, even ones not involved with the bots or anything, were banned.
---
I‚Äôd have to rewatch the video but I‚Äôm very sure he lost... everything
---
It's not really worth the effort switching. Just use whatever combat style you want to gain xp in. 
---
Unless you need regular void now, I would wait until 100 combat so you can use the veteran boat for more points.

Best gear for melee: Full rune god armour, rune scimitar, amulet of power, green d'hide vambraces, and the boots you get from the stronghold of security.
---
Best gear for ranged: Full green d'hide, maple shortbow (with best arrows you can afford), amulet of power and leather boots

Doesn't matter how well you drive when a jmod hacks your car.

Tysm, I'll take your advice and wait a bit. PC seems less daunting now that I've learned switching is not really needed.

You will when the baby/mom sleeps. I get most of my RS in at work/night
---
I meant for what type of attack? Full rune with leather gloves and fighter boots are bis melee for example
---
Fascinating stuff, looks like [my hypothesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3p3cup/loot_from_100_lantadyme_seeds/cw30hdo/) 3 years ago was slightly off!
---
If you don‚Äôt want to recoil the tree spirit for lost city to get to Zanaris, you can just hop around the wheat fields until a crop circle appears and enter the puro puro field that way and just get all the talisman you need in one go. Also earth implings give an earth talisman too. Don‚Äôt remember all the ones I got from essences. Could buy a bunch on main and open them to see a better drop table than what wiki has. Usually the lower tier implings aren‚Äôt that accurate.

If you play often enough its bound to happen every once in a while.

During our theory crafting we thought about several items he may have access to, grotesque guardian rewards are not possible for him as he is locked out of slayer seeing as he has a task that cannot currently be completed in morytania
---
A lot more parents on here than I would‚Äôve imagined, we should start a CC

Xp rates would be controlled by other players.

Super combat potions can be made in morytania though.

We are all playing RuneScape so

There is no double exp weekends on oldschool runescape.
---
Phishing attacks are usually made with the promise of double exp weekend "come read about it here". It will prompt you to log into their fake website and enter your in game bank pin for verification.
---
That person logs onto runescape the next day excited for double exp and finds that his bank has been completely emptied by the hacker.
---
I used to be like that, but I recently took the plunge and put a couple zenyte drops towards my POH and I love it so much. No more typing, no more w330 servers. I spent about as much on that as I did going from d boots to prims, for example. As much as I love my fancy red boots, the house is so much more worth it in my opinion.
---
Also, it can be done much cheaper than that if you're a little more patient than I am.
---
&gt; Fucking jagex doesn‚Äôt allow special characters or anything else to be in passwords.
---
Lmao; you got phished. How the fuck are special characters going to help here if you would have just typed them into the phishing site anyway?
---
I definitely see loot as a much bigger part of PvP and I think a lot of existing pvpers do too. I‚Äôm not sure how much an elo system would work.
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
Probably third age, because lucky imps. But that definition of "possible" is up for debate
---
please tell Statistically Challenged as well. The blue text hurts my brain
---
I like it so far. Keep doing what you love :)
---
We got nothing till now, maybe our community don't speak enough, you know?
---
That one straight up pissed me off. I could understand a slap on the wrist because I get they don't want to encourage botting for any reason, but for what it was, permabanning all of his accounts was insanely heavy handed.
---
Still use video guides lmao idiot
---
I just set clone hero back up after a couple years. I turned that on for the controller polling rate but forgot to turn it off lol
---
Let's take 1 incident and generalize it for every one after.
---
No, be has a team of morytania iron men
---
theoretically possible would be the stuff they had there, plus some clue items from lucky implings e.g. 3a kite, ranger boots, maybe obby cape (r) though i doubt that's better than the vestment cloak.
---
Well, now I have 2 different answers. I am confusion
---
Even with ectofunctus, what are the best bones he can access in morytania? Normal bones on ectofunctus would undoubtedly be slower exp/hr than just burying them normally.
---
Can't forget about cannibalize either, which is pretty convenient for levelling, or the occasionally convenient infinite breath underwater for non-locks
---
Hmm, seems like a pretty even tossup, really matchup dependant. I guess the question is whether having an edge on pallies, warriors, and rogues beats out QOL and a more significant advantage over locks and spriests. I'm guessing the latter is more worth it for the consistency?
---
Looks like a Dwebble
---
ghasts might be faster xp for him anyways, the best bones he has regular access to are probably big bones from bloodvelds (occasionally dragon bones from implings but meh)
---
February 15, 2004 was a good day.
---
I have a hard clue scroll making me go to Tirannwn for the 4th or 5th step, but I don‚Äôt want to do regicide and other quests(don‚Äôt judge me). I am about to alch or drop it, but I just want to know what that will cause? More steps, keeps me on the same step, ect
---
Just trade him lol
---
Http://Osrs.wiki
---
$11 btw
---
Also, if youre wondering why i dont have elite void on in second pic its because under 96 range dhide/karils is better dps than void.
---
Do you have any recommendations for good zulrah guides? I've tried it before but got clapped during my first three or so attempts trying to learn the phases. Thanks for the recommendations! Will have to go back to Barrows soon after doing the hard mory diary.
---
Dude your knowledge of the game inspires me
---
If you scrape the bottom of the barrel and launch a team from there, you're setting yourself up for failure, and most doing BA from a cursory glance clearly don't look up the basics.  The sea of melee players is damning.
---
Look like somebody that belongs and seems knowledgeable of what to do and try to gather a team of actual decent peeps and you won't have major problems.
---
The massive irony is the more fashionscape they wear, the more likely you want to pair with them.  Second best is finding Elite Voiders with MSBs because gear matters.  When I do runs, I literally would take the ironman with a maple short and crap ranged gear than a guy in full Bandos and a whip.
---
Sure, the good players they tend to go to their "own", but you can find yourself being a straggler to a good team.  Just don't be completely ass yourself; they aren't exactly expecting you to Attack with a bunch of spec weapons on hand or expect you to finish early as a Healer often (because you won't even in good teams), but people expect you pull your weight reasonably.
---
Best come be a part of teams running "funs" and be receptive to asking for help in small doses, mostly advice to improve.
---
If you aren't dumb then that's pretty much the only way you're getting hacked so it fits.
---
I‚Äôm forced to do this rn since I have no good money makers unlocked haha.
---
I see you're on runelite. Hold alt and you can move the UI to wherever you please.
---
Well, I think the way you put it is the simplest way possible to say it, thanks. Question answered, thanks to everyone who posted, I read all your comments but I'm kinda lazy to answer to all.
---
Oh yeah, but that's just the quest that locks the entire *region*. Obviously an account locked to that region is going to need to have completed the quest.
---
there aren't really many 3a items that are even useful for him
---
Jagex will ban you before them which is a shame because this is hilarious.
---
It's definitely more prevalent as a mem than f2p for rune running. Haven't seen any clans that do it atm.
---
BA is garbage.
---
Can you explain? I'm only 93 range and I've been using elite void.
---
I see, that makes a lot more sense. I was just going off a youtube video where some person used adhesive.
---
Perhaps lore-wise this is feesable if the blessed proselyte degraded?
---
Wow.  10/10 info.  The world needs to know this
---
You were definitely right! I can always find a spot now after paying the 10k. I guess people aren‚Äôt willing to shell out the money for it, but thanks for the info!
---
No, once it's fully grown it will stay like that until you harvest it.
---
Dont trades have a second window where you check all the items before clicking accept?
---
No, if the herb survives the growth cycle and becomes ready to harvest, it'll just stay like that forever. I've had the same herbs ready to harvest for like 2 months, since I started doing tree runs I haven't bothered with herbs.
---
Will you make more? Looks great!
---
\&gt;Not risking bank

You're welcome

Just FYI but BH worlds almost always have hosts as well! Before I had a maxed house I used bh worlds because they were less laggy for me.

Maybe you should understand the context of what happened before commenting you fucking moron.

Why do you take two sips of super attack. One caps you out.
---
What does alts mean?
---
i mean he doesnt even have to go into some rooms, its team content that can be effectively duod with a straight leech in the raid.

Torags legs? What are those good for? I always though guthans were better

As a f2p only uim, idk why you would ever have over 100k cash stack on you. So easy to deposit at lms coffer and way safer uncase someone gets access to your account. (Granted my entire bank on that account is 2m tops)
---
&gt;Be kinda weird to just log in, get first cape ever, then log out right after, only to log in shortly after and start playing as normal.
---
And from 2 different IP addresses from two very distant locations, nothing less.
---
Because it would destroy the economy. People would hoard skilling items and the prices would skyrocket during double XP weekends.
---
jfc this is too relatable
---
bludgeon has good attack speed?
---
Pretty sure it does!
---
that's what I figured but for some reason people are just dieing for it to be a scam, as then it would probably make them less popular. Why make them scams when the odds are so stacked against the better anyways? Your gonna make waaay more money making them legit. Its just like a casino, its a pretty easy and accurate comparison to make.
---
If they were actually scams they wouldn't be growing in popularity as much as they are. Theres one on every world where-as 6 months ago they were only on super populated worlds. Obviously they are doing something right. Granted I will never play them, but I don't think they are scams either.
---
Catherby

This changes everything
---
he's getting downvoted because eoc has nothing to do with the current stats of the ranged armor providing good bonuses towards all 3 combat styles.  it is literally not even remotely relevant.
---
Criticism is allowed, but if they get called stuck up for rejecting to implement suggestions like this, that benefits exactly zero people (like who the hell goes back to check if they composted their patch???) then I'm allowed to criticize that "criticism".
---
at the moment taking gold ore and turning it into gold bars is a massive loss. with this people would actually buy gold bars.
---
Bring a bgs for spec on vorkath, switch to that when you use crumble undead. Easiest way to lower your negative magic bonus quickly. This does not apply if you are on a slayer task and can use the imbued slayer helm.

Using his main to cheese parts with enemies.

While we're talking about shitty, pointless quests, let's talk about Monk's Friend.

Thank you for the response. When I click 'Log in', the page refreshes and nothing happens.

Exactly so.

If we had voiced dialogue, every quest would become a "Bearer- seek- seek- lest-" situation.
---
Have you tried turning your mobile device off, and then turning it back on?

Ditch the Karils, use Dharoks instead.

Hit the nail on the head there.

at least your first pet wasnt rex
---
I'm experiencing the same thing. The wiki guide sucks, and I don't know what to do.
---
Not as epic as the first because you peeled that one in one go.
---
90% of my clues have a step with the 3 wilderness volcano things as the picture. So sick of having to bank my graceful to go there
---
Feeling so cool they inconvenienced someone for a 600 gp gain.
---
There are some people in this game with fucking bank. If you get a person like this to bet against a bot then this person would clean the bot every single time(it would just take a little patience).The difference between this and staking with a person is that nobody would let you do some Martingale shit to them, with low enough initial bets to where you could afford to double or nothing to the point of having your gain guaranteed.
---
That guy, and a few others, are on Swampletic's friend list if that you can see in his vids.
---
I laughed wayyyyyyyyy harder at this than I should have.
---
Thanks
---
but why would he use any piece of 3a except maybe the wand, the way he described it he would be one of the 3 rangers in full karils, ammy of the dammed, ranger boots, ??? necklace ??? gloves ??? cape.
---
if he was going to melee for the thicc lady wouldn't he still be wearing karils with a whip?
---
It works on the app fine, I'm playing right now. The issue is getting on the actual site (through google chrome or a mobile internet browser). I'll restart my phone anyways though just in case, I don't think it'll do anything though.
---
Yeah its basically the same gp but better XP/hr!
---
He wears little hats. No likey
---
U can‚Äôt
---
Probably because that's literally RWT from Jagex perspective
---
Well the thing is the risk on recently became low enough to express it at all, that is in fact what lgbt people literally had to do in the past and still have to do in certain areas of the world.
---
Walking is xp waste stams are meta.

Without knowing the full impact this would have on the economy... I'm fine with that

Why would you have an altar?

What's the best afk fishing money maker between karambwan, infernal eels, and sacred eels? I would have to work towards quests/other requirements to start fishing any of them and would like to know which would be the best to unlock (85 fishing currently).

just go to the sand casino...
---
On the contrary, osrs has more worlds than ever and the average number per will is still higher than it used to be
---
Atleast scroll down a little before you post. It's already been posted.
---
\&gt; this isnt dawntained    
---
hence why dawntainted has an active and growing PvP community while it's crumbling on the real game.  
---
deep wild isn't supposed to be nice, PvP worlds and -5 BH however shouldn't be so cancer that no one wants to play it, which is the current situation.
---
You've been playing over 12 years and haven't figured out how to slowly cruise through the trade windows and triple check everything to make sure you're not getting fucked? You're either

A. A complete idiot

B. Lazy
---
That's pretty cool. I'm never gonne use it in my life, but its pretty cool nonetheless.
---
I have 150 kc and died ~2 times. Just be quick to glory out and you're fine
---
No they dress up as the NPC so they look like one and the person doesn't realise. I'm not OP, just explaining the situation. Got M2A cape ages ago
---
I thought they had to be uim too, not region locked but still.
---
Not their fault you cant remember your own login details tbh
---
I highly doubt this unless they were doing hundreds or thousands of accounts. I've watched a guy trade 100's of bonds to his bot accounts from his main, and the main has gone untouched with thousands of bans on the other accounts.
---
I forget that the average age of the game is 22 sometimes. I make new friends in game expecting them to be my age like most other games. Then the conversation will eventually turn to kids, wife‚Äôs and 9-5 jobs. I don‚Äôt mind it though, I like that the average player is older, means you get less toxicity.
---
Region-locked is nothing new
---
It's just the first time a series has reach this level of popularity
---
Only true master farmers know how to do the what flick technique. GZ btw!
---
No need for an altar if you're not going to host. You can build one and move the tiles around later if you do decide to host.
---
Forgive any weird formatting, it looks good on my screen.
---
A _B _  C
---
D _**E** _ F
---
J _ K _ L
---
B is north, D is west, F is East, K is south.
---
A is a random portal room for portals I already had up and didn't feel like paying to add to my nexus.
---
B is my portal nexus with the teleports jewelry along the southern wall
---
C is my altar (unnecessary)
---
D is my Superior Garden with a pool and fairy ring. The pool is in the northeastern corner. (No tree because low farming)
---
E is the entrance portal (I use a formal garden because the grass is mowed and the flowers that you can plant are pretty).
---
F is my quest hall (unnecessary once you have the ornate jewelry box) with the glory spot on the western wall.
---
J is my workshop with the armor repair stand on the eastern wall.
---
K is my Achievement Gallery with the jewelry box as far north as possible (and altar along the western wall).
---
Not sure what L is. Probably my study or something. I don't use it. The only thing that I use that's farther than 1 square from my entrance portal is the portal chamber (that could be combined into my nexus).
---
If you are using my set up, once you upgrade to the ornate jewelry box (that has a glory), you can swap the extra portal chamber with the quest hall.
---
The most important thing is not adding a fence or bushes around either of your gardens. It's faster to portal in, use the pool, and run to B than it is to portal in, use the pool, and run to A.  This is not true if you have a fence. It wastes an extra 1.2 seconds each time (2 ticks).
---
You can customize however you want, but put your most-used room directly north of your portal. That's the room you zone in the closest to. I don't claim that this is the most efficient layout, but it seems to be for my uses (I use my portal nexus nexus all the time).
---
Mazchna doesn't have Gargoyles on his task list. Brittle Key only drops on task.

Not possible.

All these suggestions are great! I'd like to add a "wall of trophies" option for your POH monster heads. Currently we can only mount one per skill hall.  Would be a cool cosmetic completionist goal to show off in the same vein as champions' cape

It was the Golden Age!

He needs the cash to fix his barrows gear and the herb secondaries to make new potions after failed attempts, so he can't drop those unless he wants to spend ages rebuilding after every try.
---
He's probably not dropping the ghostspeak amulet because he still needs it for something and he can't get it back in mory, not sure why exactly though. And same for the medallion.

---
What gear and method u use to kill venenatis?
---
Do it! It's super worth it, and 10x more as an ironman.
---
How it works:
---
After the quest, you can sort of rule the island. You have to gain 100% favor (make the people like you) by helping them out. Once done that, go to the dude next to the king and deposit a bunch of money (preferably more than 500/750k). This money will be used by the people to collect resources. The more they like you (favor), the more they collect. You can choose what they collect. As a normal player, mining and cooked fish is the most profitable afaik. 
---
There is a second quest u can do to have more ppl work for u. Check the wiki.
---
Also, favor drops each day by a few %, so just visit them, rake some patches and its 100 again.
---
or 80 agility
---
Tbh everything that fortnite has is someone elses, all the dances and stuff so..
---
Thanks man!!
---
It isn‚Äôt on RS3 at all, I think it was just to show there are emotes
---
Just chalk It upto a lesson learned and bring some salad robes next time you go to finish your cape. Don‚Äôt worry about it, you‚Äôll have it back in no time.
---
I flipped my 4K 27 inch screen into portrait to play osrs for a bit and it was really enjoyable
---
For me not a lot, but as some said fishing is great ago, so like currently, while I play my main I currently have my iron catching minnows, trying to fish til 99. The minnows are so nice for instance because although you gotta click every 10 seconds or so, there's no banking or dropping, so even raiding is a piece of cake as o just have to click once and I'm right back to it. Very easy. When I cook them I'll probably afk a all on the main.
---
the runecrafting grind is not going to be an easy one for settled
---
Some people can afford them. Dont be mad about it.

For anyone that may be less tech savvy, simply adding -wikia to your Google search will exclude the fandom wiki from your results! Example: "osrs rune scimitar -wikia"

Search the OSRS homepage for the blog regarding it. It's been mentioned a few times, they have an official process for getting your stat reset.
---
You'd have to use -fandom, since it's not actually wikia any more.
---
Having said that, this is purely for the lazy arse/perfect ehp players who are useless and can't be bothered to type 7 extra characters, or scroll down the google search results slightly to click the right one =p
---
I'm with everyone else on this one, they have counteracted this problem with the big red flashing of an item change and 2 trade screens. Your ignorance and trying to anti-scam is what got you screwed over.
---
This exists, but apparently he accidentally used them on a table, which has no such protection
---
Im sure you did! As did your numerous 7 day old alts trying to sell this crap
---
Mage isn't broken when majority of TBers you see, run cabbage robes and water staves, because they KNOW that it's enough to get a tb on someone, usually on 1st or 2nd try. Barrage holds for 20 seconds, with no way to mitigate it by half. 20 seconds is almost always enough to get pummeled by a clan and get a ticket to lumby. It's the 10v1 mentality in wild that's broken, not mage.
---
You got me gz
---
Why 60 defence? Not worth it. 1 defence and you can pwn any pure for T10's
---
&gt; Bandos is lacklusting agaisnt high level pvm monster where defence is needed
---
That is what Justiciar is for. 
---
&gt; they released t75 rapier which is upgrade from tentacle and whip. When will they release t75 power armour
---
It would have to pass a poll, which I don't know that it would.
---
I totally agree but at the same time you gotta admit using a bot for any reason as someone who's a youtube entity, that was kinda silly. Good intentions or not they've made their rules on botting pretty clear. Say they let people do bots like that, where would they draw the line? Either way I didnt wanna see him banned :\

Can the Thammaron's sceptre be buffed? Having its own built in spell(only usable in the wild) and giving it a special effect that gives a chance to ignore magic defence are a few ideas.

You logged in on your client took a screenshot and claimed you made a bot...

Steps used to be saved after dropping clues. There was an update that changed that though.

torso is 33m for regular leech, 44m for premium, as of last night, in the BA Services CC
---
More crystal weapons to add variety in the pool of items would be great
---
What happened to serene?
---
does for me
---
is it the best for defense too?
---
This phenomenon is even worst on mains where fucking full black d'hide is the best God damn armor in the game.
---
neither does jagex
---
I read that littarly like how he speaks it out lmao
---
There are some inconsistent mechanics in the game when it comes to bosses becoming invincible. Most bosses that can become invincible also become untargetable or unattackable, but there are some that don't, even though they probably should.
---
The grotesque guardians become completely untargetable when they do their coloured light phase change, but dusk is clickable during the phases where you need to kill dawn, even though dusk can never be dealt damage during these phases. **Could you make dusk unattackable during the first and third phase of the grotesque guardians fight?** This would help especially during the third phase when dawn throws out her energy spheres, since it is very difficult to pick up the spheres if they land underneath dusk.
---
When vorkath uses his ice breath to freeze players before he sends out his zombie spawn, vorkath becomes completely immune to damage, but players that were attacking him before he uses his ice breath will keep attacking vorkath even though there is no reason they would want to. This can be detrimental when using a crossbow since sometimes your ruby bolt special attack can trigger, hurting you but dealing no damage to vorkath. Also, because of the slow attack speed of crossbows, accidentally attacking vorkath while he's invincible can make it unreasonably difficult to cast crumble undead on the undead spawn in time, causing you to take unnecessary damage in a way that does not feel fair. **Could you make it so players stop attacking vorkath when he becomes invincible?** There was a poll near the start of QoL month which asked if players should stop attacking when frozen by vorkath's ice breath, but this wouldn't fix the issue of the invincibility being inconsistent, or with ruby bolts triggering while vorkath's ice breath is in mid-air. That poll question also had a very high rate of players voting to skip the question, which should indicate that many players didn't understand what benefit the change would have for players. If the change (that makes players stop attacking) was based on vorkath becoming invincible, then it would be much easier for players to understand the purpose of the change.
---
Considering the nature of the interactions, I don't think a fix for isses like these should need to be polled. Please note that my reason for discussing this topic is because of the inconsistency in mechanics, not for "easyscape".

No I don't play osrs, just wondering the name

DV like Divine Valor? Who goes there, unmask yourself

Okay but dark bow is better than tbow for that. I don't even take my tbow to zulrah unless I really want to chill out.

This is a terrible argument when range gear worth 15k is enough to tank 10M in magic gear.

Any chance of Perils of Ice Mountain (and with it smithable pickaxes) making it's way to osrs? Or a modified version of the quest.

Your name is go fist yourself your opinion is now irellevant

can normal accounts be able to go into ironmen's houses? few things disabled and there's no problems, also the hydra pet would be way nicer if its heads didn't get cut off when you metamorphed it, also also, why is it muted outside of when it's wandering in your poh? it has a unique walk sound but now nobody can hear it

"HahAH luk guys this dude wears non-BiS gear"

Lmfao, paranoid much.

You ever get shafted by having all ge slots filled with buys and membership running out? Can‚Äôt even cancel to grab the cash besides the first 3 slots, also doing the walk of shame to ge because all your runess are in pouch for varrck tele ugh
---
Fair enough
---
Riddle me this then, the hacker took some items that were 1.1b like tbows some that were few hundred k but left 800k on him? Whats the reasoning behind that? Obvious rwt
---
I'm completely out of the loop. Who's Serene and why do we hate them?
---
what? you can't reliably win with 55:45 or whatever odds stacked against you, even if the bots are legit. Quite opposite actually, you're reliably losing in the long run due to law of large numbers. FFS you don't see rich irl people trying to clean casinos (who are regulated and not scamming), do you?
---
Just googled "osrs price check", I never knew that was possible. I sold some of it already, but I might be able to work it out.

It's a YouTube series

I don't really know man, you prob have better options at lvl 85?

Can you explain why? They were not crazy rewarding and added something that wasn‚Äôt a solo antisocial method to train mining

Literally go watch Torvestas latest PKing in 2200 world videos where he puts up a counter of how many times in a row he splashes in Ahrims with Staff of Light on full black d'hide.

Spoilers: it's fucking 14.

I started there, then went to Varrock and only killed the lvl 7 ones. Running around that Willow tree was doing my head in.

I was thinking glory at 1300 total was pretty damn good :p

I'm not sure whether to go for imps or just sweat out crafting as I'll want it up for fury etc.

At least they risk. Id rather that than a pure who protects their granite maul...

Ayy thanks!

make america optimal again

plank make is a really good spell, back in the day i made ~40m getting 99 mage getting 120k+ xp/hr
---
There once was one nazi who was kind to everyone, so all nazi‚Äôs are good people.
---
And you can open it in combat, remove it or hide it.
---
It might be good, but if you misclick a overhead, youre done for.
---
Imagine being 1500 total and still wearing an untrimmed cooking cape
---
People who write that they are 100% trusted, normally are not.
---
The store button is too close to spec orb. I smell alot of frustration if its not moved.
---
Good luck either way! Got lucky and had one of each lol.
---
Yea, realized that after I posted my comment :P
---
Avoid communicating with the pineapple son ever again
---
It was like 120ish hours once he gets to swamp lizards. So maybe 2 1/2 weeks if he wants to grind it asap. But nothing compared to the slayer or prayer grind.
---
Why not wintertodt and burst for better effiency
---
I got crashed more at ammonite crabs by hcim then pkers. Did it to max range and melee, also used chaos gauntlet for 99 mage there so decent sample size. Oh well
---
Can't you just remove it lol?
---
Needs more upvotes, 
---
Bump!
---
I play with ‚Äúenvironmental sound‚Äù on when im training in the background to hear the monster react. Dont have to hear myself attacking. When he stops reacting i know i have to tab back in
---
Sounds more like denial.
---
Underwater is higher ehp and brimhaven is higher do
---
You can remove it in settings, p sure the button is identical
---
no, just stay away from the poison clouds and you'll be fine
---
I use it to recharge my prayer all the time, super useful. Gilded altar only costs a mil?
---
I‚Äôm doing it now, do I need to use ice gloves and then switch back to goldsmith to get the cap drop?
---
ogresses can be killed in corsair cove, requires the pirate's treasure quest. I think people usually safespot the warriors with range but not 100% sure. 
---
2.2mil is alright i guess, you can buy mithril/adamant/rune armour pieces to alch for a small profit usually. 
---
A better method is to go to smithing worlds and buy rune 2hs, but you probably want to have 10m+ to do that.
---
Ikr. Trying to run away from a clue killer *ends up pressing it* TFFFFFF
---
I'd get the original whip, shark, and possibly an agil cape kitty.
---
Well roughly about 40k magic exp per hr but with firemaking it really does depend on the log that your firemaking with yews I can push out 65k xp per hr doing this method
---
Speak to Nulodion at Dwarwen mine/Ice Mountain, and he will recover it for you.
---
To be fair mage has a 15 second root
---
I hope that you've finished Kandarin hard for that bank teleport. Makes the Camelot course worth doing until level 90.
---
Lot of times you can walk away and restart the dialogue interaction

I really wanted one of the little icons to just be ‚Äò$11‚Äô
---
Title doesnt say "all pkers are good" it just says that they're not all bad. Not saying anything about nazis haha
---
well cloak and kiteshield will be bis, but apart from those I don't think anything else will be useful. Maybe wand but he probably can't spare the inv slot.
---
Hey Vargorond - we answered this on stream a few weeks ago. In short, we're open to the idea but would like to complete the current expansion first!
---
Thanks brother &lt;3
---
That rs3 thing youve described is usually due to undownloaded cache, if you sit in the lobby there'll be a % that tells you how much of the cache youve downloaded.
---
Once its done animations and such should play properly.
---
"It's great being an adult because the price is equal to eating at a crappy restaurant once a month. The difference is that OSRS is one of the top restaurants in the whole world!"  - This rang sooooo true with me.  
---
Getting 25 magic is really handy for teleport to Varrock, the Grand Exchange (trading system) is just north west of the teleport.
---
In the tab with quest tab there is a red tab called minigames, if you select the game an option at the bottom comes up for most to teleport to it.  It is worth having a look at where each takes you to as these are free, helpful but only can be used once/20 minute, whether logged in or not. 
---
Fairy rings are awesome as there are loads and again are free to use, you only have to have started Fairy Tale Part 2 (so ignore the req's listed on the wiki).
---
&gt;rumble? Or would your absorbs run out too quickly? 
---
With high def, you wouldn't run out of 1k pts in tank gear in 5 mins. But you would use a lot.
---
80 minutes first kill not bad

Who said that

Nice account you started last month

Thats why you dont miss it silly

Unlimited elf teleport seed from song of the elf‚Äôs?
---
When will the overpoweredness of 3rd party clients be addressed?
---
Using the official client puts you at an objective disadvantage to other players in a large amount of content.
---
1. Treasure trails - this one is insane. The clients literally solve the clue scrolls for the player, taking any remote idea of challenge (puzzle/lightboxes, hot/cold steps) out of them.
---
2. Chambers of Xeric - raids scouting is something that a large majority of players would be sad to see go, but the fact that you need to use a 3rd party client to do raids even semi-efficiently is ridiculous. 
---
3. RuneLite's menu entry swapper - allows abuse of the shift-drop feature of the game to make 3t skilling laughably easier, allows left click teleports on items like skillcapes and jewellery, just all around making the game easier for no good reason.
---
4. Implementing failed polls - the ability to reorder the spellbook/prayerbook after having failed a poll is stupid. What's the point in even polling this kind of thing if clients can and will just do it anyway.
---
Not to mention all of the other features like removing zoom caps, disabling item drag, Arceuus library, demonic gorillas etc.
---
It's painfully apparent that Jagex are using 3rd party clients to avoid a client overhaul. 
---
My main question is; when will the official client recieve a meaningful overhaul. There are so many updates that would make the use of the client so much nicer like making it load in the size of the fixed window/remember the size it was last in, adding the GPU renderer that was already developed for mobile.
---
Thank you this is very helpful! :)
---
Incredibly shit take, foxinsideabox.
---
Wintertodt isnt efficient fm training.
---
Most efficient fm training is to run 2 spaces east of ge, make 2 fires, then run 4 spaces east, then repeat that way you dont waste ticks running. 
---
Theres people that did this, while fletching darts/casting magic imbue. None of which interrupted the consistent 4 ticks from firemaking
---
Oh are you a different guy? Sorry didn't see.
---
But since the obvious isn't obvious, the obvious counterpoint to "bosses being designed around blowpipe in last 4 years" is "bosses before that who are fucked because of blowpipe.
---
That and hydra, which obviously wasn't designed around blowpipe considering how ridiculous it is there. Jagex have literally said theyre looking into making melee more viable there, purely because of blowpipe.
---
Thanks for the 3gp
---
I don't know a few hundred team and solo raids

Can you add Death Rune Packs on the magic shops so we don‚Äôt have to world hop a thousand times to buy runes?

Just use an autotyper, helped me so much when i got my 99

BH Bloody keys
---
It works like this:
---
For each and every kill above level 5 wilderness, you get a very small chance for a bloody key - works only in BH worlds.
---
However, the chance on getting a bloody key is dependent on the wilderness level (the higher the wilderness level, the higher chance on a key), the amount of risk &amp; items you are holding and also your combat level and the risk of your opponent. Once you use the bloody key in Edgeville on a chest, you get pking supplies and gear (500k to 5m loot). No unique items to not incentivize farming.
---
However there are many dangers to holding the key:
---
- Everyone in the wilderness &amp; Edgeville gets a message that you received a bloody key in a certain level of wildy (Elvemage has received a bloody key in level 45 wilderness!)
---
- Key hunters can grab a gem in Edgeville to locate the bloody key (‚Äúthe key is north west in level 38‚Äù)
---
- Everyone can attack you regardless of combat level
---
- You will be a multi target - meaning everyone can attack you, despite being in singles for example
---
- You will be instantly teleblocked while holding the key for 150 seconds
---
- logging out will make the key disappear 
---
- killing the same person on the same IP will not work, you can only kill the same person (or his multiple accounts) of a particular IP once every 30 minutes for a chance on a bloody key. And your target has to carry pking supplies to increase the chance for a bloody key, making this not farmable or abuse-able. Including the fact that the chance on a key is very small.
---
This will cause that many pkers and hunters will chase the key! Causing lots of activity and excitement :)
---
This would make sire so much better. It‚Äôs bad enough you need a maxed house to make the boss worth doing, it just sucks when you get jewed out of 100 damage per kill during phase changes. An exp buff, and damage between phases would probably make this fella decent exp for a boss and a lot more fun to kill.
---
Give me a question, dont want anything, just want to see what the questions are like.
---
In reality the opposite point: if you are youtuber etc then common sense policy goes out the window and you are held to a higher standard.
---
I wouldnt say its MOSTLY skill, it just has more skill involved than veng pking.
---
The problem even with NHing is that the current meta/gameplay is just VERY unrewarding for someone being in much better gear/much higher skill and not nearly punishing enough for people who do the wrong things and are in 300k of gear. It ultimately comes down to RNG and that ruins rewarding gameplay.
---
You can literally sit in dhide top, tank legs and bolt with melee pray up and pretty much never die unless the person gets insane RNG on you or they out last you (which, if youre in that setup probably isnt that likely). Doesnt require much gear and youre essentially purposely doing the "wrong" things, yet you arent really punished for it. Part of this also boils down to how shit mage is but thats a different story.
---
(using this as an example because its the most clear one if you watch his streams) If you watch Amenity stream at all, the biggest glaring problems are shown pretty clearly on a regular basis because he vastly out skills most of the people he fights and is usually in extremely good gear. However, watching him hit a 0 or a 1 on 1 def pure in essentially robes/chaps with a Elder Maul or DCB off pray simply makes absolutely zero sense and thats something that should be changed. Or the biggest problem, being in max mage setups for a pure or zerk (in void and max gear which is max mage dps and bonus for a zerk, and 2nd best for a med outside of ancestral) and watching the ABSURD amount of times hell either straight up splash or put out terrible DPS with mage on a pure or even worse on a guy in rune/torso is just disgustingly broken. When there are things like this tht go on and people who are severely out geared and outskilled can fairly easily live even missing prayers and doing the wrong things it shows how shit the current system is.
---
There needs to be most consistency and there needs to be a MUCH better rewarding of gear/skill and punishing of poor gear and skill before an ELO system gets put in place otherwise nothing will actually change besides more people fighting more people closer to their skill level which does nothing to change the huge problems with the gameplay.
---
Why do we have to have a whole event celebrating gay people? Why does this have to infect a kids video game?
---
I have no problem with gay people. My issue is that people like you take your sexual orientation, and feel the need to force it on the rest of us. 
---
Do I get a parade for being straight? No. If I was offered one, would I ask for it to be put into a video game, where the context is not at all relevant? 
---
No.
---
Cool, gay kids play this game. So do black kids. Are they asking for a black panther style parade through varrock? No, they‚Äôre not. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand what issues you‚Äôve had in your life to make you demand more LGTB stuff in a kids video game, but whatever they were this is an issue for your psychiatrist. 
---
TLDR: RuneScape is not a place for parades or events around sexual orientation.
---
Well I mean there were brews on the ground, and brews left over in inventory. So yes lol
---
Stupid question:
---
When doing a boss in a multi combat area (like KBD), how does the game see who gets the drop? Is it by damage given? Is it who gets the last hit?
---
344
---
To be fair there were tons of brews left over
---
But the later rounds give way more points and nobody would want to start from the beginning if you can start half way
---
World 344 is the pest control world
---
Ger worlds are offline atm, and the typical pc world is 344 (which happens to be Ger)
---
You could try joining the CC in the minigame section, maybe there's an unofficial world running.
---
I think the only PC world is a German world and they're down for maintenance or something
---
I already pointed this out and I think it is very worth noting that the poll asked if players should stop attacking when they get frozen, not when vorkath becomes invincible. My suggestion has always been to make players stop attacking when vorkath becomes invincible, and I think it is important because that is how other monster invincibility mechanics work.
---
Join and invest in this ICO do not miss this wonderful opportunity and be a great supporter.
---
344 is one of the German worlds that are offline atm.

"Wtf am I even doing here... where the hell am I!?"

Me not reading any lore or dialogue as I pass through the underground pass for the 3rd time

But I think you lose the items if you die again... So dying in ToB would trigger the items from the outside death to be quickly visible and despawn again

Yes, ghostspeak amulet, from goblin town.

there's a zulrah task?

they will specifically target people to make an example out of them, a good example of this would be when zulrah helper was a thing

they would ban anyone related to using it

Can we rest next to fires to restore run energy faster?

Pretty much. You'd be much better off doing ensouled heads (and get magic XP too) or doing better bones at the wildy altar (Similar xp/h, but uses less bones since there's a 50% chance to get the xp but not use the bone).

I want a FT so bad but I'm too scared to ask for a group for BA

You want to restrict 23 worlds to having a 99 or 92 for all server locations?

Ill give you that, didnt realise jekyll gave all 3 super atk def str, gotta wait for farming torstol though :/
---
Not sure if its too big but one about the lore of runecrafting might be cool, from the bits ive read in various quests it seems almost inconsistent and I dont have a clear picture in my head of how the RC altars came to be or how knowlage of RC was lost ect...

Dont have time to read just wanna get my torso

Yeah SCB is pretty unrealistic, but technically he can get them so we used them, we are thinking of doing another run with the true restrictions

You PVM goldfarming ratboys just don't understand. It's not for the gp

I dont have friends and have no idea how to do BA
---
and also for the love of all that is good, buff the fucking loot table. average loot for a boss like sire with multiple phases where it is easy to die if you dont know what youre doing should not be 45k. 
---
even grotesque guardians, which is arguably easier, has better average loot. and that boss is also in serious need of a rework.
---

I feel like I'm missing something.  I keep hearing OSRS and double xp in the same sentence lately even though I know Jagex would never do that and I've been playing as regular every day and not noticed anything. Going to look this up now.
---
3a items aren't too helpful, the biggest thing imo that he can get from a lucky impling is a rune crossbow, because that opens up ruby bolts for him
---
You can do combat stats whenever you want. Or anything whenever you want, honestly, there's really next to no "right" or "wrong" way to do it.
---
One thing I always, always recommend for anybody who is unsure of direction is the [optimal quest guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) for a general idea. The first part of it tells you quests that are great to have done, and then the next portion is a great order to accomplish quests in to dish out some steady and varied xp gains to various skills.
---
As you progress down the quests, you'll start to get a general sense for what it is that you want to do, and you'll find yourself referring to it less and less, while kind of accomplishing and setting up your own goals more often. It's just good guidance to get yourself on a path and get the ball rolling.

Thank you for the replies, Bandos seems to take the lead in this case, despite being arguably hard to obtain.

That kid holding the plant to the sun has been reeeeeeeposted more than #freetorvesta

That doesn't change the argument in the slightest. A toddler could get full void for you, it's stupidly easy and just takes a long time.
---
My thought exactly... Magics and palms being lower than ever. So many newbie players not understanding opportunity cost. I fully believe the reason I've been able to make a fair amount of money is I don't cut corners on training or supplies. Generally the best or at most one step down in best method has the best cost to time investment ratio.

what about missing those sweet marks of grace from 80-90 tho

You can pay 25k for an instance at kraken and it is totally worth it.... Items stay o nthe ground for 30 minutes in an instance so juggling food is super easy.

‚ÄúIn theory‚Äù

Ofc there is always a minimal chance of u losing 10 stakes in a row.
---
What you're missing is the point. The point is that there is no point in pk'ing those players cause you get nothing out of them, you have literally nothing to gain from those players yet you go and kill them because you can't handle an actual challenge.
---
You prey on the weak because they are weak, and you're holding on to this disillusion that it's part of the game. Of course it's part of the game, but you don't see me cutting oak logs at 90 woodcutting. It's stupid and inefficient, and that's exactly what you're doing by hunting players that have zero desire in pvp'ing.
---
You are a parasite in the wilderness with nothing to offer but griefing, and that's pretty sad.

Go pick up feathers near the cow pen, you'll probably earn more gp/h this way.

cant weight votes, you either open the vote to everyone or no one.

---
you can juggle clue
---
hard clue can be 4-6 steps long  
---
So if you just done 4 or 5 steps. then try juggle it  
---
How? well you will need drop 1 more hard clue.  
---
Done 1-2 steps on new clue then get reward chest.
---
But you can have only 1 hard clue in inventory/bank. So you have to redrop it every 2-3min till get another hard clue
---
Anyway hard clue is pretty common. I offten did juggle with master clue. Drop master clue before open clue reward chest ;)
---
I will next time.

Members is 1000% worth it IMO, it unlocks a crazy amount of content that makes the early game of your account much less of a chore, and the late game something actually worth striving for. If you know you'll probably get membership eventually, and you have room in your budget for the membership fees ($11 btw), there's really no good reason to delay getting it.

I mean talk is cheap. If you'd like to gear up I'd be happy to risk something. It's not just preying on the weak. I'm always up for a challenge, but hiding behind the idea of the fact nobody risks anything is stupid. Get a logical reason for someone not to kill you in the wilderness.
---
Ye if we are assuming everyon has 62 crafting.. does every moss giant farmer have that?
---
Also, the staff is just as rare...
---
That's why it's a short term strategy. In the short term the chance of losing everything is small, but the longer you continue the higher the chance of hitting a streak. (Either way, but the low winnings don't make up for the high losses)

Teleports come from jewelry, Teleports tabs (and spells), various quest equipment / rewards, achievement diary rewards.... Fairy tale pt 2 gives you access to those rings and you only have to start the quest, you do not need the farming requirement. I'd check out the wikis optimal quest guide. If you search that you'll find a list of the best order to do all the quests and following that should last you a solid 3 to 4 months and get you to 1500 total assuming you play semi casually

Considering that pvm meta only really changes when new gear is added, I doubt it would change literally anything if black d'hide was buffed for whatever reason. It's still a pvp-only discussion.

I really need to learn this.  Sold most of my bank for a tbow to fight Zulrah with and barely made it through one kill before getting frustrated and switched to Vorkath.

Use blessed dhide until 90+ range. Your times till drip down to around 3 mins.
---
Can the Hydra Tail get a buff/rework? It's currently a useless T80 item locked behind a Morytania Hard Diary, 80 Prayer, a lvl 95 Slayer boss unique and a Dragon Slayer 2 boss unique.  Yet it's dead content and has been since release.
---
Ammy slot is the most important slot so it can't be wasted on subpar items, making this item dead content.  Please lower the requirements to use this item, give it the stats of a glory, or give it a complete rework.
---
That's a slightly different issue, albeit an important one. Streamers have way too much influence on Jagex unfortunately.

This is a good way of cashing in your RNG lol. Grats!

I appreciate that it looks ugly.

I would say torture and prims

I agree with him unironically. I'm 100% certain people could link my rsn to my reddit name and I would still be completely safe.
---
Can we raise the bar for polling? Personally id like to see a significantly higher total level or XP requirement as I believe you should have to have spent more time with the game to understand the effects of what you are voting for. In the beginning, people kept the longevity of the game in mind while voting, and now a days that doesnt seem to happen. Also, an amazing suggestion ive seen would be to add a way to vote to the website as well, instead of just in game.
---
There is a difference between adding and altering
---
What‚Äôs with these lazy ass photoshops, it literally takes 30 seconds
---
Your not missing anything if your looking for the nostalgia of playing runescape, maby if you liked wow then rs3 might be worth a shot

Thank you c:
---
Salamander pet would be cute as heck.
---
How do you know these people do not watch high end content videos and streams?   Is their experience invalid, and if so why?  Honestly this sounds like arbitrary gatekeeping.  
---
But moving on, your argument makes no sense.  Every new content poll is technically something players have no experience with by definition, and by your own logic should therefore not be voted on.
---
OP said it's 65k exp/h
---
I love it! Very nostalgic, really hits home with the F2P restricted ironmen of today
---
Google OSRS construction calc!
---
They are getting opinions from streamers who are involved in pvp and want the best changes for the game

You‚Äôre in the fucking wilderness. You‚Äôre the entitled child for assuming you have safe passage mate.
---
How is this even an issue?
---
With my recent purchased DHCB, I want to farm Vork as well as KBD. However I am pretty afraid of taking it into the wilderness.  If I turn attack player to hidden, auto retaliate off and just run straight for the entrance, is there anything else I can do to take precaution?  
---
Also what bolts do people usually use for KBD with the dhcb? I dont think dragon diamond and ruby would be worth it but maybe regular? 
---
Thanks!
---
Never stand in gas if you can avoid it.    
---
You don‚Äôt need to step into gas to avoid his attacks. Jiggling between the edges of the safe spot is your best bet
---
Does anyone know what they actually talked about?
---
Im almost 2k total. I vote yes to almost ALL content (no to all PVP polls that will negatively impact me in ANY way, but occasionally to a content/pvm poll that might be op or devalue something in a ridiculous way, almost never happens), even if its sub total 300 type content.
---
I wonder how elections would go if people could vote more than once. Just a thought.
---
If I have 1 single vote and another guy has 3 accounts. It would take 3 of me to cancel out his 1 vote.  And then we gotta get up to 75% for anything to pass. So if I vote yes and that same guy votes no,  my vote didn‚Äôt even matter.  This is why no 1 votes on polls. My opinion gets devalued by people with multiple accounts
---
We know they‚Äôre all there to plan how to rig the next DMM
---
There was a double exp ?
---
Fut the wuck
---
Not bad, just a dick.
---
I‚Äôd say maybe 1000 total and up at least understands the mechanics of the game enough to have an opinion on endgame content
---
No it‚Äôs karks
---
Watching a documentary on cancer doesn't make you an Oncologist does it ?
---
And as I stated in earlier comment, adding and altering are 2 different things.
---
You heard it here first lol
---
A big problem is the 80 prayer requirement.  Most players with 80 prayer don't have a use for the tail and most players with 80+ prayer are max combat.  Also makes it useless for any restricted combat accounts, where it could have served as an alternative training method.
---
The amulet slot is also the most important slot concerning dps, outside of melee where the most important is the glove slot.  Think of anguish and occult necklaces.  Torture is also quite valuable.  Most players with 80+ prayer can afford these, so why use this necklace.
---
Suggestion: Lower the prayer req, give it the stats of a glory or between glory/fury.  Would make it a useful item  instead of dead content.
---
What the fuck
---
Except he's right. Crumb got all his accounts banned over a harmless not he created. Even his accounts he didn't use it on got banned.
---
O lol I thought u was being serious for a second
---
Its perfectly fine to bitch about game devs not listening to their communities, but you picked a poor hill to die on with OSRS. They have been pretty good at polling interesting content to be added into the game. 
---
Hiding poll results would be nice, but that's an issue for another day.
---

---
Yes, police? This comment right here.
---
You can clearly see that the two blank ones are completely different.
---
At the tip of Archie's pen on this one there's a weird inconsistent smudge/divot thing.
---
OP's is even and more like you'd expect from that sort of paper.
---
How do people run bots on world 330 advertising House hosting/Guilded alters without being banned?
---
They type at like 1000 words per minute for hours, clearly they are bots. Are these Necessary bots over looked?

Is Blast Furnace viable for ironmen? I feel like 76k/hr is aggressive until you have a consistent cashflow.
---
Tbh, ba is a pretty simple minigame. The in game guide describes everything pretty well, and when you get to the queen everyone has their own role and there's a book at wave 10 that explains each role. None of it is hard if you make the right calls and pay attention to the person calling for you. There's also a timer that lets you know when the next call is. It's really not that bad, until you get to wave 7+ and someone leaves with literally no remorse and you have to start all over because you have nobody to fill their role. That's the real reason ba is aids.
---
And they can vote on those characters just fine.

Saw a clue hunter in lvl 50 wildy with FULL GRACEFUL on (the dig spot by 3 little volcanos)

Fortunately for him I was also clue hunting but only brought 3 items like the cautious fuckface I am

And spent like 12 hours just to cross the bridges to even reach the demons lol.

Yeah, honestly mobile brought me back because it's hard to squeeze in the grind time required without it. Plus I can afford memberships, like I couldn't do when I was 13. Honestly just made this post trying to get involved in the community, because every game is more fun that way. But, it made somebody bad because they downvoted every post of mine. Lol, back to lurking I guess

Yasss we need something different for Proselytes. I'm tired of looking so ugly.

This is the classic if it's not reproducible in dev env then the bug must not be there... 
---
It's not even that difficult to reproduce. There is a very noticeable drop in yield when you switch over to the Attas plant. The biggest kicker is that it produces yield BELOW the minimum you should be getting. This should be an immediate red flag. 
---
I can't bring myself to plant another Attas seed but once I run out of Iasor, I will start planting Attas again and record all my runs.
---
Yeah, I do get it, but other people might have overlooked that person's username and thus be missing out on some good joke. YoUaReSoHiLaRiOuS, please be mindful of the people who might have a good laugh thanks to this comment. Do not ruin their fun.

How angry would you be when you have near end game gear and then you lose access to the account?  Or you log in to find your bank empty?  You are rowing a canoe with a gaping home in it.

When DMM comes back and inevitably fails again, we know exactly who to blame.
---
Ignore the plebs of the subreddit, you do you and if posting content makes you happy carry on my dude
---
It's not more known because it's absolutely incorrect lol.
---
You're right I'ma just start over !
---
The number 1 rule is to ALWAYS use what is called for your role in the top right corner and to ALWAYS call out what the other roles need to use as soon as the calls change. This is done using the horn you receive upon entering the BA arena. You'll get the hang of calling quite quickly. Always prioritize calling out over anything else.
---
Then, there are 4 roles:
---
Healer - your job is to kill the penance healers with the correct poisoned food called out for you. At the start of a round grab your items from the green dispenser. Make sure you know what penance healers look like. Use your poisoned food on the healers to poison them. Generally you won't be healing your teammates until the last wave, so don't worry about that for now. REMEMBER TO CALL FOR OTHERS AND TO WATCH WHAT IS CALLED FOR YOU.
---
Attacker - your job is to kill the penance fighters and the penance rangers using the correct attack style called out for you. I would recommend you use ranged - bring in a magic shortbow and grab your arrows from the red dispenser when you're inside the minigame. Make sure you know what penance rangers and penance fighters look like. REMEMBER TO CALL FOR OTHERS AND TO WATCH WHAT IS CALLED FOR YOU.
---
Collector - your job is to pick up the correct colour egg called out for you. Once your inventory is starting to get full you can run to the dispensers in the middle of the map to deposit the eggs. I'd advise you not to shoot your eggs - it gives no points and is mostly a nuisance to your team. You get your points by picking up alone. REMEMBER TO CALL FOR OTHERS AND TO WATCH WHAT IS CALLED FOR YOU.
---
Defender (TO BE ADDED) - your job is to kill the penance runners using the correct bait called out for you. There is a very easy and foolproof way of doing this involving simply marking the 3 only tiles you'll have to use on the Runelite client but I don't have the time to explain that at the moment (at work). Will update later.
---
After surviving waves 1-9, the final wave will spawn the penance queen. Will update later too.
---
Only thing is most people keep their mems on their alts and sometimes their main, with bonds
---
You never quit!
---
Just because you're 300 total doesn't mean you, as a person, are ignorant or unqualified to make those decisions.
---
Then should we also get6 Ancestral Recolors to match all the new capes? BiS Gear shouldn't be expected to have a bunch of recolors; especially when color options already exist. Also, the colors aren't just for recolor's sake; they have a function and mixing recolors with function and recolor for cosmetics muddles the game.
---
It ain‚Äôt that deep.
---
Can you draw an Incestral Wizard next?
---
I‚Äôd say after, that‚Äôs when the thrill of that spade appearing really hits me ü•∞
---
Last week on the Q&amp;A Mod Tide mentioned that various impling jars would have a chance to reward beginner clues. With the update coming this week, could you reveal which ones and their respective rates?
---
I've since been done with my BA runs, and I was fortunate enough to group with a bunch of other noobs who were learning. We all helped each other learn and by wave 10 we were getting queen kills. We all played through and did each role to get enough points for torso, and stocked up on queen kills.
---
Because while EOC fixed a few problems it made the game unplayable for over half the community
---
Holy straw-man...
---
When I used to have a main I had this feeling. But then I decided to create an ironman and everything has changed. All grinds seem to have a reason/meaning
---
I strongly believe it's actually karks
---
I could see it being useful if it had the stats of a glory, people who couldn't afford a fury or zenyte jewelry would use it while training
---

i hate getting pked, mainly only go into the wildy for clues so its just inconvenient, but its when they start their diarrhea of the mouth is when i get salty. i just give them a nice report, and depending on what they say, remove them from my ignore list and report them again for real life threats/breaking real world laws lol

Why would you even respond to that?

I said he can keep just the money and regather supplies. It's defeatist to even think he'll need to try again, and it settles him back by removing precious inventory space. Also, when he dies, he'll lose his cash stack anyway, so he'll need to gather another 100k from scratch just to reclaim his stufd

Ammonite crabs work until high 90s melee and max range.  The 3 crab spots you almost never have downtime.  I personally prefer crabs to nmz

There could also be a cave where the remaining traitorous elves are located.

Can noted Xerician fabric from Lizardmen be added to the Hard Kebos/Kourend diary rewards? This would make Shamans slightly better drops-wise aside from DWH and may possibly be useful for warding in the future.
---
I mean this is everything I've ever wanted let's call it a day. Well done boys.
---
How is that different than just having a level requirement?
---
Most people here are having fun with you (but not in a mean way) because they think you're a cute noob. Since most discussions are between veteran players, any relatively new player who isn't as familiar with the game and doesn't 'skip' early game content, instead deciding to enjoy the journey, is considered endearing.
---
Do people who breathe more get more say? Or is it all equal . Asking for a game
---
Idk I think it's too limiting without it. Uim would basically be like that one99atatime guy. Uim already heavily discourages going back n forth on activities,but atleast with just looting bag, you have some ability to stop some activity without going all the way to 99. 
---
And atleast zulrah/vork/Hydra banking is dangerous since it's lost permanently on death. Meaning you can't use them to easily get a completely maxed combat set up for something. (other than chambers of xerics since dying there doesn't reset zulrah banks iirc)
---
Resource drops from PvM - big topic here, big topic in RS3 too. With the arrival of crystal tools, will the amount of logs, ore &amp; fish be slashed from drop tables?

You end game guys will always vote for end game content, likewise us low tier will have to work up to that point and start an even longer grind for those quests/content. 
---
Everyone‚Äôs entitled to opinions, this is mine.

I‚Äôve done experiments till 91 str so far , need a change up. I‚Äôll try to do bone voyage tonight and try em out thanks !

People who're maxed shouldn't be able to decide changes to end game content because they'll be biased into wanting it and will also not vote yes to mid to lower level content.

I would never recommend using low alch, it casts at half the speed, gives less than half the xp, and will result in a huge loss of money with High alch giving 150% more gp, and is still usually a loss.

People who called for the ardy knight nerf after 99 are scum, there is no other way of saying it. But also constantly buffing xp rates, for example with RC, just made the whole skill not feel as high level as it used to be.
---
You look whipped, man.
---
Reply "Im perfectly happy" if you need help.
---
Who says that people that have more accounts, or even more playtime(higher skill total) are better at game design? None of these skills correlate to the content being voted on.
---
Well yes but if you remove the prayer requirement or make it very low it'd be useful with those stats.  The passive prayer exp/prayer points being restored would make it worth using as well, given you wouldn't lose out on so many stats.
---
Yep!  They're a lot less click intensive, but it's a bit competitive so you'd need to hop worlds to find a spot most likely.  I trained to 96 str there since I personally value afk training I can do on mobile
---
lol basically make the game easier and these bosses just easier to grind? Scorpia also is not safe spottable at all unless you mean freezing it. 
---
"This is not a positive player experience" lolol wtf? It's in the wild if you want something from the wild you need to understand other people can attack you. smh these posts are why this game is slowly going to shit
---
Please stop while you‚Äôre ahead.
---
Should be 99 rc

Alice. They have mutual instagram. archie and alice.

Sounds good to me lul, combine all items into one

Here‚Äôs a little story. It was a log grind until money hydra. Once there I can‚Äôt be bothered to grind out 150 arch hydra kills.

That's already a thing.

Put prot item on before u tele up. Then even if u skull, u keep it.
---
Can you allow skillcapes on Entrana? I would like to use my farming skillcape effect on the hops patch. The only skillcape that could be useful other than farming is the fletching skillcape which allows you to take out a bronze crossbow but this can already be done by taking in logs/knife and fletching the crossbow.
---
LMAO
---
Its like, you Americans think that the whole world works just like US. It doesnt.
---
Voting age is a thing because people realise that a 15 year old has no concept of how the real world works. 300 total is considered in OSRS to be "underaged".
---
Everyone who pays in their 401k(did i get this right?) have a chance to vote on it.
---
So senior citizens shouldnt be able to vote? Like age 60 is the limit and then go fuck yourself?
---
We stockholders we cockholders
---
He's dumb
---
slap on some d hides and suddenly mage gets shit on by melee lol, you'd think mage armor would give good melee def (though at this stage I don't think you can fix this without shitting on the triangle even more)
---
Super lucky! but also Super unlucky!

wheres ep 3 man, ive been very patient lol.

pearl fishing rod is unreal. support for equipable  fly fishing rod.
---
I was at where you are for a long time, I took a break because I thought I didn't enjoy the game anymore. But the thing is whenever I'd be bored I'd wished I was still playing OSRS, and was wasting my time playing private servers and other games just to fill that free time I had.
---
Think of why you play Runescape, and why it's fun for you, and what your goals are. Perhaps join a clan or find a group of people to play with
---
Change it to PKers and ya got it
---
I‚Äôd hope so
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying but I think it‚Äôs a bad comparison of relativity. Plus as a rule of thumb I like to keep politics and beliefs away from gaming
---
I bet there's better places to fletch in between actions, so 150k-300k fm exp/h is definitely more efficient
---
Fucked
---
Gatekeeping definitely exists lol Look at /r/gatekeeping for more examples of what I'm talking about.
---
It's about putting somewhat arbitrary restrictions on something, i.e "real men wear leather boots" or those angry twitter posts that have a clap emote in between every word saying don't do X if you aren't Y.
---
Like a paradise, you and i will never see.
---
If it was like 5 bucks to add an extra character to your acc, Jagex would actually make bank
---
A big no to this.
---
if i cared that much about graphics id just play a newer mmo, not a reskinned worse version of one that exists lmao
---
How is it stupid? It makes for interesting gameplay. If you were 100% safe from losing your +1 while skulled that would be extremely dumb. 
---
You‚Äôre already 100% safe from losing your items literally everywhere except the wilderness these days, how much more EZscape do you want?
---
Who said that that is the correct way to do things? I never defended that. 
---
OSRS is a bussiness, which means if i suddenly donated 50M ‚Ç¨ to Jagex i would be made a JMod in 10 minutes. All that matters is ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ no matter how much you cry about it.
---
Thanks for the bank
---
What makes you say that?
---
Someone: "Can you name all 3 branches of the U.S. Government?"
---
Voter: "No."

Zammy on task ew.

Sad and confused rn
---
**Will there ever be any expansion or upgrades to zogres in the future?** Literally and metaphorically dead content ;)
---
- Allow us to re-fight the boss with a very rare key drop from zogres (Easy repeatable new content)
---
- Rebalance the coffin rewards to be more rewarding (old zogre keys will remain unchanged so hoarders don't profit)
---
- Introduce newer and more powerful zogres which would also call for new brutal arrows (Can you say dragon brutal arrows and dragon nails?)
---
- Newer anti-disease potions that are very potent and last significantly longer and cure instantly. (new herblore content)
---
- New **tradable** zogre composite bow with high ranged requirement that fires brutal dragon arrows? (New niche ranged weapon that doesn't contradict existing powerful weapons)
---
- Chance to introduce more lore. Mini-quest? Full on quest? 
---
- Chance to add an even more **powerful zogre flesh eating boss** accompanied with very exquisite bones and chance of dropping dragon nails; elder achey tree log (drop or access to new tree after quest) for the new powerful composite zogre bow; among other worthwhile drops.
---
**Can something be actually done with Thammaron's sceptre already?**
---
Thammaron's sceptre is currently useless and in need of a buff in comparison to the other wilderness weapons. The **core problem** remains the same though, which is that there's very **few monsters in the wilderness you can actually use magic against.** This can be addressed by fixing the many safe spots by either putting the bosses into caves or enclosed areas and making magic actually a possibility instead of being entirely disallowed by the ridiculous +500 magic defense bonus that Callisto has. Originally it was possible to use magic against Callisto but they decided on a lazy fix (now gone jmod) to just fix safe spotting at the time by making it impossible to use magic.
---
So to sum it up:
---
1) Fix wilderness safe spots (callisto, venanatis, vet'tion, etc)
---
2) Make magic great again by allowing us to use it (**greater pool of npcs not immune to magic preferably**)
---
3) Make more npcs weak to magic and perhaps resistant to other styles within the wilderness (**At the very least allow all 3 styles to be equally used instead of limiting others**)
---
4) Fix Thammaron's sceptre so it's actually on par with craw's bow and vigorra's chainmace in terms of **DPS and similar cost** to use per hour.
---
5) Another possibility is to allow the sceptre to ignore all magic defense of npcs in the wilderness. This allows a competitive edge against all other magic weapons in the wilderness and gives way to being able to use magic against Callisto once again without being able to safespot abuse with ice barrage's freezing. **Callisto can remain immune to all binding and freezes.**
---
Where's the fucking full video
---
It's the only game I can say I've consistently played for over a decade. My playstyle has changed radically since when I first started, but its ability to scale is one of the coolest things about it. 14 year old me would think current day me was a good, but we both enjoy playing equally. One of us kills Hill Giants for hundreds of hours, finding enjoyment in attacking two Giants simultaneously with a maple shortbow from his safespot, and the other is tick manipulating skills and soloing GWD bosses.
---
I totally agree. I liked watching the guy.
---
In my experience, the only time I encounter a pker is when doing an activity that requires prolonged trips inside the wildy like green drags farming, dark crab fishing, chaos altar notes bone runs, etc. Thats where people will have noted items worth millions, so the chance of encountering a bored player waiting to attack you for cheap spare equipment after you burning necklace is practically none (not to mention its a very short run to the ladder/lever). Even at dark crabs I barely get pkers and when I do, the 4 sara brews I bring are always enough to sustain the minute or so run (including ice barage) to safety.
---
Tldr: dont be afraid of boogeymen in the wildy, you'll rarely die to them and the one time you might (I haven't died at dark crabs yet and I'm at 95 fishing from there), you'll offset the loss with the huge amount of profit the other runs brought in.
---
As for skulling, just remove the  attack options for players and you'll never skull. Auto retaliate isn't an issue for skulling unless your weapon/autocast somehow has aoe and you're in a multi combat zone.
---
So I botted rc and r trying to cover it up?
---
Oh boy, here we go...
---
I'm all for this idea because I love tower defense games. 
---
All towers would need to be constructed/upgraded (giving construction xp) 
---
Allow players to build traps and barricades to damage/slow enemy forces
---
the type of tower built could also give xp to that skill, 
---
* magic tower, slow and strong attack
---
* Range tower, fast low dmg
---
* Rune tower, gives buffs to nearby towers
---
* Melee tower, start with shared xp but can be upgraded for specific skills
---
All of this being said, I can see a lot of engine work needed to actually get this to work. Between structures attacking enemies, enemy pathing, building items. But I'm not much of a programmer so it might be an easy task for all I know.
---
Oh man that‚Äôs hilarious ty for the link

Go and get yourself a torso
---
Niece is an actual irl person. I get the memes but this is too far
---
Not really, dumbass pvmers think the wildy shouldn't be risky. A glory has 0 requirements and costs 10k which allows you to tele from 30 wildy. Getting rid of TB is outright stupid
---
awesome, thanks bro!
---
yes theres songs for both games on various streaming platforms.
---
just not all of them.
---
they said they migth do more in the future like a bossing collection.
---
Your fine but it would be best for you to be the tank
---
One share (subscription) = one vote. I dont think there is a better way to do it.
---
In the initial thread and then basically the first comment in every shitpost after it, there were people who genuinely believed it. Some people were joking but some people were angry that jagex could call a game where the average user had 8 years of play time "not addictive"
---
I had one in the original RuneScape, I prefer the d chain
---
So if Jagex artificially inflated the cost of black dhide to 500k they wouldn't have an issue? 
---
Yeah, ok.
---
I've definitely been told to kill myself more times by the people I kill than hearing it from any of my friends or whatever, but maybe this is some odd exception. I know pk'ers can be a toxic bunch, but iits not like pvm'ers tend to die silently either lmao.
---
I will admit to getting frustrated sometimes after like 3 deaths in a row, and going out of my way to find someone easy to rush real quick. You've clearly never had the thrill of stacking over 100 damage on a helpless runecrafter for that sweet, sweet 12k glory. Sometimes we just wanna have some fun.

Frankly, you've just got to get smacked about 20 times before you finally get it. Very very few people get it their first few tries.

If you want you can plant willow trees wait for them to grow, check them, then come back half an hour later and cut the 5-6 branches off using the scissors(forget the name) those are about 1.2k each and can get you another willow seed+ some

Why did this meme become a thing
---
Yes.
---
Gear that has more prayer bonus than Proselyte should either give negative attack bonuses (a lot like flowers, so its only good for skilling where prayer is needed)... then you could also have a new prayer book for skilling.
---
Use bank pin........

I never understood that change. A minigame notorious for being full of people who have no idea what they're doing, and they remove the requirement to do a tutorial...
---
What are the teams thoughts on adding in a way to check your slayer streak when talking to a master before you complete a task or in the in-between time of tasks. There is currently no way to check your slayer streak other then when you complete a task. This creates a situation where I often don‚Äôt go to the correct master on my big point tasks.
---
I don't use any :(. I don't trust them.
---
I'm sorry if it came across as rude. I just dont see people farming it having 62 crafting. 
---
Thanks for the insights
---
Not unmatched
---
lol people have wanted black hides to have negative melee attack bonuses for over a decade, it'll never happen
---
they tried it with armadyl and forced it into being pvm only gear
---
Is nobody original anymore? SMH we see one meme hit the top and 50 follow it doing essentially the exact same fucking thing...
---
/Rant
---
Nah just proving a point that the poll system doesn‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs broken because people think $$$ = more and better say. Hitler has a huge following too, does it make what he said/done right? No. But you can‚Äôt see past the concept that the ratio of 1:1 voting is the problem because people with more accounts get more votes which is utterly stupid. But whatever man, we can even get a poll situation fixed and y‚Äôall think the game is gonna be something
---
Because the original client does the job. No point becoming dependent on a client which runs a risk of compromising classified info and personal details
---
I mean it's simple. If you don't want to get pked get better, bring gear, or don't go into the wilderness. It's simply part of the game.
---
How have you done that?
---
people who use bgs at vorkath should not be giving advice on how to kill vorkath
---
Still not swampletics restrictions. See settled‚Äôs comments
---
dude honestly i have my grinds but you gotta stop and goof around with friends sometimes haha because its a game and your supposed to have fun! like when was the last time you played castle wars just for fun?  
---
 if you want join my FC "Noble Bros" come mob around with us and have some fun.  
---
Speaking of castle wars might do a little when i get off work =D
---
Fair enough if you got the money for it
---
I accept your point that end-game players have experienced early-game content, but the reverse isn't true. Your argument is that end-game players know what is good for the game, whereas new players won't know what is good for end-game content that they haven't experienced. This is a very fair point and is certainly true, but it can be nuanced by the point I made that end-game players tend to (or at least are portrayed as tending to) vote down early-game content.
---
Set up? I'm high 70s range and thinking about going for it

Back when there was no ditch, and a fence used to be there. Those days were the best. Every world was jam packed.

---
How were they able to do xarpus without hammers or bgs's?????
---
then how do you not see the issue with the above statements? if you're limited to only voting on content the account is in the correct level range for, you couldn't vote on your other accounts that are not in that range, only giving you the one vote.
---
I was hoping someone would get the reference. I always thought the east side of Lumbridge looked similar to a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte so I tried to recreate it in a Runescape style. The dog is actually directly copied from the piece, just changed to a kitten. So is the bank of the river. Everything else is just clustered the same, give or take a couple characters.
---
At least you didn‚Äôt get a seercul
---
It's hard to say, you'll get supply drops fairly often but it's all RNG. I usually trio with two maxed players and we can pretty much stay forever if we want to so you should be alright for quite a few kills
---
Yeah I mean.. that's kind of why the minimum voting age exists too isnt it? Maybe like a certain combination of QP, total level, and hours played?   
---
Idk, it's understandably hard to argue with "we pay we say", but it makes logical sense that there be a certain understanding of the game before voting
---
Yeah I‚Äôd love for Jagex to release stats on that based on IP, but it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. My guess is few people care enough about the game to multibox and it‚Äôs actually a small minority. Who knows, though
---
From your comment I don't think it's the pkers that are butt hurt.
---
What even was the original intention of this lmao
---
The we do raids admins are liars and frauds.
---
How can the spiders at Callisto poison through protect prayers?
---
With a floating youtube app.
---
I was pretty new at it since it was my first task yesterday. I wasn't too sure about the mechanics, i thought it was some crazy endgame boss with tons of prayer switches like demonics or zulrah. Turns out its pretty easy and that food juggling idea is great ill have to do it next task
---
Are you under 99 farming? I haven't really noticed this issue myself aside from occasionally mistiming a compost. Wondering if the skillcape bonus is why I'm not really seeing this myself.
---
I assume you have something better along the lines of merching/pking/scamming etc. and ye theres probably better untraditional moneymakers there. But compared to traditional gameplay few things beat leeching, especially if you enjoy playing ba :p
---
Best way to get Hespori seeds? I get one every couple of days from fruit trees but I only have around 15 kc so I want to get more

But that‚Äôs osbuddy
---
some people in this sub are very fragile lol.. i like seeing people post their achievements, but very often when people post them there will be a few other people who will tell you to 'stfu' 'trash acc' 'who even cares lmao thats not an accomplishment'

good thing we all start with lvl 1 prayer tho cause youre gonna need that thick skin
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs the point. I think the problem sorts itself out.
---
If you have two very high level accounts, you have two votes on high level content. If you have one high level account and one low level account, you have one vote for high level content, and one vote for low level content. 
---
Do you not think that it‚Äôs fair?
---
They could also release some updated elves in Prif with an updated drop table. I think in RS3, you don't actually kill them, you just "duel" them (and then they throw your reward on the floor like assholes.)
---
Fighter torso is better

Theatre of Blood raid was released. This brought in the avernic defender,  Ghrazi rapier,  Sanguinesti staff, Scythe of vitur, and Justiciar armor. 
---
Dragon Slayer 2 was released which unlocks one of the top GP p/h bosses called Vorkath. He's a blue dragon and a drop of his head can be used to get an Ava's assembler. He also drops a skeletal visage as well as normal. He's just consistently good GP.
---
Not long ago a new slayer master was released called Konor. A new area/dungeon was added with the new lvl 95 slayer boss Alchemical Hydra. Its drops allows for the new brimstone ring, drops to make bonecrusher necklace, hydra leather to make the new BIS melee gloves called ferocious gloves. It also drops an item to make the new dragon hunter lance.

If soloing WT you can use it. Basically no one does that though.

Ok now go kill zulrah lul

Whenever I need to cook food I go there since a range and bank are so close to each other. But the fastest way there is a skills necklace which is why is I thought, hey what if the cooking cape had it's own teleport here? 
---
And yeah I was thinking it would de-value the crafting cape teleport, which is why I was thinking 1-5 teleports would be a good balance.
---
But at the same time the farming, fishing and strength capes all have unlimited teleports to guilds with a bank. The crafting cape is the closest which is why it's used, and with the cooking guild you'd still have to run through two doors which would be enough for people not to use it.

No barrows doesn't need pets, a mini spirit walking around makes no sense
---
People coming back from not playing for years don‚Äôt understand the current game. Your example isn‚Äôt even good, 2300 total on RS3 is low.
---
How many times have you gotten the pet?
---
If memory serves, the sailing skill was only introduced as a April fools joke. It wasn't polled. I also do not think Artisan was ever brought to the table as a real option, I don't think Jagex was able to come up with interesting enough content related to it to actually propose the skill. They are still working on Warding, I'd imagine we will see a poll for it this summer.
---
My guess is it will pass. People have been playing long enough now and exhausting old content that they might be more inclined to introduce something totally new.
---
and in a couple months jagex will turn osrs jnto rs3 by adding a ton of horrible updates (with the same good intentions they had in 2013)
---
Can someone explain the whole wiki situation.
---
Which one we should and shouldn‚Äôt use and why?
---
Maybe the danger isn't supposed to be in fighting the bosses themselves but in being hunted down by other players? If that safespot mechanic was any other boss (outside of PvP) it would've been hotfixed right away.
---
Look bro you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
---
2004 balancing.

Clueless pvmer spotted
---
profit varies as prices are constantly shifting, but if you're doing it at max efficiency you should be getting around those rates.  
---
max efficiency requires stamina potions, coal bag, 60 smithing and ice gloves.  
---
ice gloves either saves an inventory slot that would be used on a bucket of water or saves time from not having to wait for the bars to cool down.
---
if you don't have coal bag that almost halves your efficiency as you can only take 28 ores per inventory while someone with a coal bag can take 54.  
---
also having 60 smithing is helpful because if your 10 minutes runs out on the way to the belt then you need to go back and pay the foreman which wastes time.  
---
it's not just about saving 15k an hour but also the inconvenience of having to either carry coins all the time or having to go back to bank if you don't which could have been an extra inventory of ores in the furnace.
---
this looks like a bunch of bullshit
---
That's the level where you can max your house and build things like ornate rejuvenation pool and ornate jewellery box
---
*Deathnote*
---
Not too fussed about profit, I think I actually lost money during this little grind. - Did I get unlucky on the amount of clues I got, I thought it was around 1/25?
---
* 1k Eclectic imps.
---
* 35 med clues.
---
* 2 masters (was only able to complete 1)
---
* Took around 6-7 hours to do.
---
The wise old man: he can remove junk from your bank of you ask him to.
---
I was on a roll for about 2 months. Getting in roughly 10+ hours of play time each day and more on the weekends (work at home and have a fairly free schedule so played from the time I got up until bedtime, typically in the A.M.). It takes a toll after while. Now I'm on my third month and have played roughly for an hour or two every other day only. The game can become boring if you really don't have any friends in-game or in real life friends who play. Goals are great and it's not uncommon that after setting so many goals, you get burnt out (it's the same grind for everything). Content becomes dead when you do the same thing over and over again. 
---
I'd suggest to switch it up. Do something you normally don't do, example: PvP if you don't normally PvP. I understand that PvP is fairly dead (especially in the P2P aspect but F2P still has a fair amount of PKers and is still somewhat fun if you have the patience to make another dedicated account for it). Change it up and if you still find lack of motivation, just take a good long break and log in when you are actually willing to make time for it.
---
Welp, I'll see you in 2 days after you're done doing agility again buddy. Latta graceful.

Take that bad boy to the duel arena and with just a measly 10 consecutive wins you can have max gear

Afking black demons in graceful? Was it equipped? Most cases you don‚Äôt automatically take off untradable gear you died wearing, is it still equipped? Did you deposit it in your bank while grabbing a teleport method to your corpse?
---
I recently just got 99 farming but I haven't planted any Attas seeds since 99. The times I planted it were in the mid-high 90s and I've gone from averaging around 8.5/patch to low to mid 7s.  I also only buy the amount of Ultracompost to match the number of seeds I have and I did not have any composts left over so I doubt I missed any. 
---
I thought it was just bad RNG like a lot of people but on the last Attas seed I planted I legitimately only got 5 herbs from one patch. It's that point onward I stopped planting it all together, Googled the issue, and found many other players were experiencing the same thing.
---
Are you planting Attas at 99 farming? If so do you know what your average yield is?
---
The official wiki is https://oldschool.runescape.wiki, or https://osrs.wiki for short.

Both more expensive than d hide hence the problem. Also abyss and manked are complaining and they rock ancestral 90% of the time they pk.

Rip graceful F
---
&gt; No game breaking bugs
---
That's just because we claim almost all bugs to be features. You can't tell me it was intended to be able to flick prayers on and off essentially giving you 100% damage reduction for as long as you want. 
---
It completely contradicts the idea of gear reducing the rate of your prayer depleting.

I'm maxed combat, almost 2k total and dont have 99 FM yet. Feels bad man
---
I was wanting to work on Herblore but going from 63 to 66 costs 7m so now I dont know what to do with it
---
with all the stuff I've listed, you're losing 9+ inventory spaces. That's more than a couple brews
---
You can easily do all pvm at 45 def. it will be harder and less efficient sure, but 100% possible and perfectly fine.
---
I had it backpacked..
---
If you're shaking, that means your skeleton is ready to hatch.
---
Because you make more money from longer videos
---
Ahh, makes sense. I'm not an iron man, so I kinda forget cooking food is actually something people do!
---
Eh. D chain is the same armor type and color as the d legs, I personally like the look better than torso and d legs
---
Facts.
---
No I'm saying to do them because of the higher exp rates, and that the costs being low are further reason to do them. I would do them even if it was still 200K/seed. Because the time saved means more money and time elsewhere.
---
Oh, didn't know about the sailing one being an april fools joke.
---
I don't think anyone would mind!
---
But completely outside of Wilderness it's also lost? Doesn't make much sense..
---
If it was equipped and the inventory was full... maybe that's why it was lost?
---
I'm now worried too! I supposed all untradables are kept on death if not in the Wildy or an instance. And a couple of times I died in graceful items (not full though) - they were kept. But some items got unequipped into my inv - I dont remember exactly which ones....
---
you arent saving time
---
Once, got it at 4081
---
Yeah let‚Äôs ignore that you literally have to rape your finger and mental state for extended periods of time to benefit from it.
---
But fighter gives you sick abs
---
&gt; this is how you sound, what's the difference?
---
One is a country and one is a java-based 2007 medieval fantasy game?
---
Then do you want stats to be based on cost?
---
Because a 500k torags set will tank 90% of AGS hits too.
---
It really isn‚Äôt worth waiting.
---
Long neck gang
---
ayeeee, that‚Äôs whats up. I came back like 3 or 4 days ago. You a member? They offer you a little 7 day free trial if you sign in on mobile.
---
Wow that‚Äôs very ‚Äòsnakey‚Äô indeed, thanks for the info haha good luck on your hunt :)
---
What are the expected xp rates for 2tick teaks at 81 wc? I'm getting \~130k/hr, not sure if im doing something wrong.
---
Hmm... all of these high levels would rather people whove actually played the game vote rather than people whove never runecrafted complaining about runecrafting. Hmmm...
---
Suppose if you don't care about profit just use pray melee, otherwise flick piety. Are you using a super combat pot?
---
Lol I'm not an iron man I just like to afk cook food from drops/brimstone chests.
---
doing the lords work
---
Yea f2p cant vote
---
üôà
---
That's just how democratic voting works. Vast swathes of stupid people voting on things that they have no idea about. But the solution, stopping people from voting based on some arbitrary standards, is much harder to swallow, and potentially massively unfair
---
Yeah it's because I read slow not because some quests have absolute shit tons of dialogue I don't care about. Fucking idiot
---
This post is so toxic I thought I was on r/runescape for a second.
---
Nah I just pay with a card. 
---
At most I'll make like 3m an hour so a bond takes roughly an hour 20 minutes.
---
I can make significantly more than that irl and just pay for membs out of pocket.
---
Plus then I don't have to grind zulrah or hydra for hours on end.
---
mw2
---
Why stop there, every level should give one vote since they're a higher level their opinion obviously matters more
---
I thought blessed d'hide shared the stats other than prayer bonus?
---
You could try F2P pking at first to get a hang of the tick mechanics and all that
---
Are they fucking retarded? Or is this some kind of joke that I'm missing?
---
I remember trying to play WoW with my friends back in the day and being blown away that you had to install it

The list of things more important than the next swampletics episode

they WILL touch the content though dude, because of the aforementioned alts many high level players have. am I intentionally missing something here as well? I'm being genuine
---
Having fun playing a game without worrying about efficiency.
---
300 total?
---
Someone explain what this means please
---
I mean.. a lot of people here have accounts 5+ years old. A good number 10+ years old I'd bet.
---
Can't fault people for having bad privacy habits from when they were kids, which can still affect them now.
---
I dont get it honestly. Not trying to sound like a know it all cause I honestly haven't done the math.
---
But I dont tele. Doesnt it take you to Camelot anyways?
---
I swear I've seen someone tele after finish the course and I'm on it again before they are. Or if they're ahead it's by like 2 ticks. So when they inevitably go afk for a second I pass them.
---
Seems like a meme to me at this point.
---
Say content some more
---
Exactly üòÇ
---
Lmao too accurate
---
Would it be possible to add a reward to Tithe Farm that lets us fill compost bins instantly and also remove it, but removing the exp gained through it?
---
Read what I‚Äôm saying. Yes you are. I‚Äôm not saying they CANT vote. They just need to vote on the account that the content would effect. Two totally different things.
---
No, you just read slow. It's ok, I'm sure they're very long words for someone like you. I work a full time job that I commute to but I can find the time to read those big mean words. Some day, if you become literate enough, you might be able to do the same.
---
That cutscene felt quite tensional.
---
weird flex but ok
---
I prefer the second one
---
I think prayers will be the hardest for me. Thanks for the tips!
---
How to get 200m you skinny scrub
---
Lol the one guy looking down should be laballed as a casual or something.
---
Actually funny every dude in there is gawking hard except the dude who looks like he knows this was becoming a meme and didnt want his mom disappointed.
---
No,
---
The calculation for percentage change between two points is:
---
P= [(New Value - Original Value) / (Original Value)] * 100
---
So for attack this would be:
---
P = [(124-94) / (94)] * 100 = 31.91% increase
---
It does currently, but if black d'hide was buffed then blessed would be worse except for the prayer bonus.
---
Rendi is a fucking riot
---
I played a round of attacker knowing that all I had to do was use dscim and make calls accordingly, then I went and watched what felt like at least an hour of guides to make sure I didn't fuck over my team as healer/collector(which now seemed impossible)/trapper
---
People with 300 total pay the same price, so they get the same voice.
---
The point is you had a dscim that had all 4 attack styles, where the whip does not
---
Are you 200m?
---
&gt;!* Fishing pass

It doesn't start until 4:24, which is _way too long_ of an intro, [but there is a comment with timestamps now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPpkfm3VK0&amp;lc=UgyRA9NEYDHn6vaDOjV4AaABAg)

4 shards, 1 ballista limb, 1 light frame and 2 spirit seeds in 300kc
---
This is way easier to show and understand with visuals, for which ill recommend Lord Shayne's defender guide. The spots shown there or some version of the setup are used by every defender that knows what theyre doing.
---
That timer isn't in the base game, only in unofficial clients.
---
Personally, I used the "Mr Yogurt" clan chat and they were awesome. I got maxed levels with them fairly quickly.

Make them all require 99 runecrafting

Head to "Ba Services" cc, theyll tell you the prices are 32m for regular torso and 44m for premium torso. The price you chose gets you the exact same service, but the 44m option makes your wait time considerably less in the queue. So 32m for torso, 44m if you dont wanna wait a couple hours/days
---
True your right but it is pretty shite to do something like that
---
When I logged out during a rooftop agility course it didn‚Äôt let me log back in until I got members
---
Welcome back!
---
There are a bunch of low level quest that give you a ton of xp in skills. You should first complete waterfall quest, fight arena, tree gnome stronghold and tree gnome village. Once you complete those you should work towards unlocking fairy rings. For that you need to complete fairytale part 1 and start part 2. Once you have fairy rings I would recommend working towards monkey madness one. 
---
At that point you will have fairy good stats in a variety of skills. There‚Äôs a bunch more easy / fast quests that give you a good amount of xp in different skills. Use the old school runescape wiki to find out some more information.
---
Best of luck!
---
Dhide. Void is sub-optimal prior to like 93 range or something like that.
---
True pretty shite though to not get credit
---
Yeah but you have to run slightly longer back to AL kharid that way. The only thing it makes even marginally faster is banking from varrock.
---
Digsite teleport is the only thing this makes sense for, which I don't think was a thing when this was made
---
Change Poll requirements to 2000 totals and a minimum of 50 kc on all bosses.
---
Can you increase the 200m experience cap to 1bill?
---
It was for personal gain why do you think he made a video of it? Sweet ad $$
---
barrows is even better than before in my opinion now. There are so many strategies to doing it, and even though the items arent worth what they used to be, you can get so many kills per hour now vs before it makes it alot more enjoyable getting items so much more frequently. 
---
Look into completing the morytania hard diaries, not only do you get infinite free teleports right near barrows, but it also increases the runes you get from barrows by 50% increasing your gp/hr by quite a bit!
---
Could the Seed box automatically store seeds you pick up, if they are already present in the Seed box? Similarly to the Rune Pouch for example.
---
What does this have to do with runescape tho
---
Thanks man
---
Supply is low but so is demand therefore there isn‚Äôt a market force driving the price up.
---
You... I... What?
---
It depends on the role you do and your team. The points you get per wave are affected by the amount of eggs collected, how much your healer heals you teammates, how many attacks your attackers do with wrong style and how many runners your defender lets through. With this said you can expect 350-400 pts in c/h and 390-450 in d/a per round. If you have kandarin hard diary done youll get 10% more points per wave as well.
---
i mean... customer support... auth delay... all have fallen on deaf ears. just because he refused to receive their complaints doesnt mean he still didnt hear them yelling it at him, much like how we tell jagex about those things and more yet they hear it but dont do anything.
---
Please add a word with Y so the acronym can be Mr.GAY
---
If you know, you need only ask.
---
Wtf.. hibernophobia strikes again
---
If you take a step back from efficiency-centered mindset you could argue that it's useful for when you're finished mining and don't need to go to a bank, just need to leave to go to Varrock or wherever
---
Camelot Teleport takes you outside Seers Bank if you want it to after hard diary
---
This doesn't belong here.
---
Ya its a great way to force myself out of the afk slay grind
---
Its worth mentioning that 4081 is the highest recorded drystreak for the penance pet by far. Droprate is 1/1k :p
---
Or have the account registered pre eoc... I don‚Äôt want new players changing my 07 experience
---
Maybe start by brushing your teeth.
---
You can quest to 33, so it has to be 34.
---
"Problem" in the sense of a joke
---
People stating popular opinions shouldn't be allowed to use this meme.
---
Change my mind.
---
Loll
---
I don't wanna, u right. Should it works vice versa though? I note that in RS3, higher levels will vote against early game content because it means that only 20 bosses come out in a year instead of 21
---
Oooh my friend would hate you even more than me  with his 800+ kc no shard
---
Thanks for the quest list! I'll start working on it.
---
Higher. I have like double that and dont feel experienced enough to be able to vote.
---
Are you being intentionally dense?
---
1) Farming is fast, farming overall takes significantly less time w/ Magic trees vs Willows
---
-- 10 x Willows Per Day = 14,815 exp per Day
---
-- 10 x Magics Per Day = 139,130 exp per Day
---
Even just in the case being discussed here the difference is absolutely massive and to say you aren't saving time is assinine. To make the same amount of exp you'd get with 1 day, 2 runs, or 10 minutes worth of farming with Magics it would take you 10 days, 20 runs, or 100 minutes worth of time to do that with willows. So yes. You are saving a massive amount of time. And thats without factoring in better fruit trees as well.
---
2) The price difference isn't massive between seeds. Then why the hell would you NOT buy the best seeds money could buy. It's literally a counter to your own arguement.
---
3) You lose money on farming. Yeah, you're right. However when you can make more money in the amount of time you spend farming, than you are best off doing whatever makes you spend the least amount of time.
---
Currently I am averaging 11.2m/hr @ TOB. However when I was doing my farming grind I didn't even own a Tbow yet. While paying for farming I was also building my bank up rather quickly @ Chambers of Xeric. Even if we assume you are doing 30 minutes 4+1 chambers runs. You would be making roughly 6m/hr.
---
So in the 10 minutes a day where you spend we'll estimate 1M GP, you can make that money back in a very mediocre group doing chambers of xeric. Obviously I don't mean that every 10 minutes spent doing Chambers is a million gold. What I mean is that over the course of 300+ raids not only will you get faster and better geared, but you will make at the very least 6m gp/hr as long as you are doing two raids an hour in that time span. In the other case you are spending less, but you are also spending almost 9M gp worth of 'time' planting/managing willows for the same amount of gains. 
---
The entire point of what I was saying is that your time should be valued at whatever rate you can make money. For me, I put that number at 8M/hr. If the cost of something works out so that it would be more beneficial for me to just raid for an additional hour to make the money to do the next best method, than I will do that because it will save me time long term.
---
No rebuttal because it's not possible
---
Thanks for the reply. I do have Kandarin hard (and a few residual points from earlier). It doesn't look like BA will be that arduous of a grind. I remember enjoying it last time, although I had a good group.
---
People who consitantley use socisl media shouldnt be able to vote. Half of your votes are influenced by 1 or 2 people and you hype it lmaoo.
---
You are mistaking understanding mechanics for being advanced/efficient. Not everyone is tryna 3 tick Godzilla in record timing, doesn‚Äôt mean their vote shouldn‚Äôt count. 
---
We were all that unaware noob with 600 total at some point, we still cared for the game.
---
I wonder how many of those 300 total level players are genuine new players, bots, or veteran players just playing an alt.
---
Clarification: it was literally a bot client, but had the automation features removed.
---
Roughly, if you're efficient.
---
Check out my insta @studio.rmgz for info :)
---
Regular should be fine if you want to just use it to learn. When you want to start actually grinding out kc for money, then I‚Äôd bring a mage switch (ahrims/ancestral) and elite void range. One thing though; with void, you‚Äôll take more damage than if you were using ahrims/blessed dhide/arma, so watch your health and recoils!
---
No he said 13-17
---
Commenting because curious
---
But you stand alone.  This seems like a complete waste of programming time and resources.
---
The previous base price was $9.49, so only a $1.50 increase.
---
Surely the entire point in this is that the dudes are supposed to be looking up her skirt? Hence the original title of the original image bei G "tight place right time", until it was pointed out that she's wearing shorts not skirts.
---
Unless you get that excited over an arse in clothes.
---
I made 16m bankstanding once
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense really to be honest
---
I don't think she's interested bro
---
Haha I only just started and didn‚Äôt want to go crazy with getting lots in one go but a lot more colours are coming soon ;)
---
One of the reasons I never play minigames. I'm smart enough to know it's an absolute investment of time and trial and error.
---
Yeah, I think the sitewide self promotion ratio is still a thing though.
---
Its the associating an ign with other social media that if a user has poorly secured info can be an issue. Reddit name is another tool to search for for related data leaks and possible associated email addresses.
---
Nah. The wiki says 2 see which is weird. I swear I've failed the polevault
---
for just melee, fury and ferocious gloves then look towards torture
---
What are your current goals/what do you want to do?
---
I don't think you're ready for Dark Wizards, it's not viable until you're at least lvl 30.
---
I could get a 300 total in a day
---
yeah
---
No, I'm 100% you can't fail the polevault... Fuck Runescape.
---
If you put your gem bag and marks in your inventory you can put one extra load in your inventory
---
Having 70 defense isn't the worst to pk with either.
---
But the thread is saying to restrict that from lower levels... its like you didnt read the post at all.
---
The mobile release was fucking fantastic too, exactly what was needed, how many games in the world exist where you can log out on your PC and log in to the same world on mobile within 10 seconds.
---
If you want to consistently farm Zulrah then yes the Ring of Suffering is worth it to keep snakelings off you. Other gear upgrades aren't really as expensive besides the tormented bracelet which is more of an improvement to your overall run as opposed to the ring which I would deem a necessity. 
---
If you are doing magic only you will want an occult necklace for +10% magic damage, tormented bracelet down the road for +5% magic damage, and your eternal/infinity boots. Best rotation to start learning is the third one IMO. Again, if you are doing magic only, just hide behind the pillars when he is in Tanzanite form.
---
Splashing is really bad Magic XP per hour. Stick to bursting on ancient spellbook for fastest XP at your level.
---
It can be charged with rings of recoil, the QoL you get from that is priceless.
---
That is an interesting mathematical quandary. Does 0/0 = 1 or 0?
---
Imo its the best one to get first, cuz then you can easily grind prime and supreme while someone else does rex. It does look the lamest though
---
Please be an iron
---
The fact that you talk like this just shows you're some 14 year old kids trying to look cool by pking people in a video game to feel superior.
---
I think I'd rather be a virgin than think like your dumbass.
---
he rwtd 100%
---
Upvoted bc unsure if this a high input meme.
---
Yeah but he gets around that with the regular juggling process anyway, I dont understand why its different now
---
$2.5k..its a shit excuse he rwtd
---
Oh shit, that makes sense.  Been lucky lately with no one fighting the one by the south most safe spot but I‚Äôll keep this in mind
---
Yeah, never going to happen when Jagex knows they can milk an extra subscription for each extra hardcore/ironman/pure/etc. from people.
---
You can get 300 total levels in a few hours... if you actually play the game you‚Äôll have 1k total in like a week or two... you‚Äôre not thinking ahead. If you have a noob account then get its stats up. It won‚Äôt take long.
---
Real world trading
---
Best investment you'll ever make, trust me. Cons was the first thing I blew my money into and the convenience you get from a maxed house is insaneeeeee.
---
Ty for the methods. I'll try some. :D
---
The desert? Though it feels like everything is explained in the 5 or so quests you do there and nothing else is there.
---
Yanille? I feel like I know nothing about it other than the watchtower and ogres south.
---
I'd like to have a lore video on a race maybe, like ogres or goblins or Giants.
---
Fucking same
---
Boi you're the one who has nothing better to do with his life than to REEEE about the way people vote in a 20 year old game. It honestly sounds like you're the one who's not achieving anything in life.
---
Achieving stuff in Runescape is not the same thing as achieving stuff in life. I'm a high level player and it saddens me to see people be so obsessed with efficiency and stuff like that that they can't even chill and treat casual players with respect rather than acting like they're inferior brainlets who're too clueless to vote on new content.
---
Played RS for 15 years and only ever had one account
---
Thanks for the insight, hadn't realized how terrible karils set effect was before the ammy. Would love to see someone use this in dmm to foil a shortcut escape though.
---
Free money for who finds it
---
Haha Im so glad I got those cause I have shit luck everywhere else in the game...although I did get a 3rd age range coif from a hard clue ..which is lucky but also unlucky. Haha
---
Not really
---
Yeah but if there is any way it can be linked to your main, it will be banned, too.
---
That doesn't mean they won't add more content to it with the quest tho.
---
The area isn't locked off by quests, so I could see there being some potential
---
Say you complete a hard clue step
---
And you juggle that clue till you get another hard clue
---
If you complete the first step of the second clue itll count as having 2 steps done rather than 1 each
---
His goal was to get his step count to 3 or higher because yhats the best chance of getting a casket
---
&gt;Since this is all done behind the scenes it makes it tougher to vote manipulate
---
I see the point you're making here, but that raises entirely new concerns
---
Waste of marks if not UIM
---
Got it, thank you!

End game, your house is going to be your base. By 82 ish construction you can make things such as: fairy rings or A pool that restores all stats/HP/Pray/Spec, jewelry box with unlimited teleports, and a teleport nexus that can take you anywhere you want it to, even change your spellbook from ancient to lunar to standard. All from your house! It‚Äôs expensive but don‚Äôt forget about construction! It will make your life easier later down the line.
---
IronB---BTW not to hard to find out. Gz tho!
---
He said rwt is all but required.
---
That's not true at all...
---
I mean yeah but the only time that rules ever enforced is on people who sell gp. Gold Buyers and account sharers never get hit with it.
---
It's not wrong OP but really surely there's better ways to spend your money than paying someone to play a game for you. If you dont like the content, dont do it. Whats the point of paying someone?
---
I don't get it
---
Its not about thinking ahead, its about restrictions set on polls. 1k total in 2 weeks? Maybe if you play all the time.
---
So now he has 3 steps done, why does he not juggle that clue until he gets another drop, do step 1 on the new clue and therefore have 4 steps done?
---
Small autistic nitpicking: you don‚Äôt necessarily need to OWN 51% of the company, you just need to control 51% of the voting shares. For publicly traded companies, people who buy shares on the open market have a very small voting power which they usually exercise by proxy, which means signing off to have one of the people on the board of directors vote on their behalf. If you own 5% of the shares and you give your voting power to a board member who owns 20%, He now has 25% voting power because you‚Äôve allowed him to vote using your shares as well as his own. He still only owns 20% of the company, and you still own 5%.
---
No the issue is with runescape not your google account.
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=accountappeal/passwordrecovery
---
I messaged them hoping to keep my password for rs too, but they redirected me here. You can't change your password on the website, but this sends an automated email to you from jagex with just your username entered allowing you to change your password. Way easier than doing a full recovery. 
---
In the case you don't want to click a link, you an just google "runescape password recovery" and click the one that looks like that.
---
Marketed, it's marketed to people that are between the ages of 13-18, people that have the free time to play a game that devours so much free time. Everything from the style of the game, the general content and the E rated quests and adventures in the game are very lighthearted and kid friendly. It is and always has been a great game to play for people in middle school-high school. 
---
A lot of people that were kids when the game was released still play in their 20's-30's, but that doesn't change who the game's original audience was nor does it change who the game was made around, kids.
---
Nope sorry haha
---
Amen
---
It'd cause an increase in Ironmen, I bet.
---
What's the point tbh? Paying someone to play a game for you seems like a massive waste of money, what do you even get from it if you didn't do it yourself?
---
Just don't do the content you find boring instead of paying someone lol
---
That makes sense! Thanks for sharing that!
---
Would be dope
---
If you're paying someone? Yeah, it's Real World Trading. And you can probably be banned if they look for the logs of you trading gp and such. If you're sharing your account with a friend, then you're fine. The account sharing rule WAS abolished some time ago... and even now people loan their PVP accounts to certain content creators for videos and such.
---
Nobody has an altar in their house
---
Serp is basically a degrading item though.
---
W330 usually has unbearable lag, and the time saved from not having to hop worlds and find another house adds up to extra kills per hour
---
Is it feasible to tele up to chaos altar for one inv at a time? I really have no interest in manual offering so I imagine I'd be spending too much time there for bringing a significant stack to be worth it.
---

---
No you have it the wrong way. 88% percent gives you more runes and no bolt racks.
---
Yeah, never thought I'd see RS related pixel art again. I'm getting 2009 nostalgia right now.

They made everything look bland and the same. I honestly could hardly tell the difference between regular leather armor and dharoks.

They took everything that made osrs unique/iconic and changed it to look lackluster. It felt like sabotage at the time and I'm still not convinced it wasn't.

Yeah, portal nexus is something imo is a status symbol more than anything.  Teak portals are definetely the way to go, lunar isles and maybe waterbirth are the only real tele's you'd constantly need, 99 con is significantly more useful than a portal nex

Nice, whose playing?

This is meme is 2 panel format only. Fight me.

Yeah but a full run takes 13 minutes. So even if you are on Queen, and they bail you still get points re doing wave 1-9
---
&gt; Just like how people don't pk often at air obelisk
---
wot. loads do because people bring large stacks of runes.  Most people do get it and like I explained to you earlier today one a similar whiny bitchy comment. Pkers kill everyone in the wild geard or not. If you have a problem with that then stay out of the wilderness.
---
Oh my god. This one is a fucking disaster. What could have been a FANTASTIC meme is just being destroyed by you guys.
---
Imagine forgetting items half-way into a quest when not using a video guide
---
I don't mean to be rude but tell me that guys neck in the back is photoshopped
---
Personally it makes sense leave an area to complete quests/clues otherwise the content will be locked for so long. Nothing else outside of that quest line or clue line. Imagine rolling for one small favor for example.....
---
Hint it's enlightened journey
---
I‚Äôm not sure how easy this was to make because of the animation. It‚Äôs impressive. (I know nothing about this kind of stuff).
---
This community is so ruthless sometimes
---
Not in bh but from wildy slayer yes
---
It was a few weeks back, but Atlanta United vs Cincinnati - we tied.
---
Fair play man. Different strokes, different folks. Ngl I just get a kind of thrill from being forced into the wild. Like it makes those times you go to the wildy and finish clues hassle-free, feel so much more satisfying than your standard clue step lol.
---
Yeah. The stats on black d hide arent game breaking. Karils has the same stats almost and people arent complaining about that. Its just that it costs fucking 13k for almost BIS magic def gear and Almost BIS range atk gear.
---
Not sure if you're aware but talking to the mage and range tutor in lumbridge let's you automatically pickup runes to rune pouch and equips arrows/bolts to ammo slot or directly into a blowpipe. There are a few other things in this vein that you might be able to find that are convenient.
---
if you think template memes can be fantastic then thats your problem
---
yes officer, this comment right here
---
&gt; Okay but this doesn‚Äôt change the fact that gay kids exist an understands concepts of feeling different than others. A lot of people as early as 8. Literally nothing wrong with having a message that it‚Äôs okay to be different.
---
&gt; (I think implying you‚Äôre alt-right was kinda funny. It‚Äôs a comedic sentence.)
---
Yes, there are children that are gay or may become gay later in life. However it is illegal for them to act on sexual impulse at their current stage of development. Sexual activity is an adult activity, therefore a game that is marketed at kids who are legally prohibited from having sex shouldn't have sexual themes or discuss topics that these kids may not even be familiar with, at least to most sane adults.

They regrow on berry patches that are super close to a Tele tho

---
just because its a merch doesnt mean its not a good suggestion though.
---
like everyone who suggests sceptre buffs obviously is merching them, however thats because OBVIOUSLY the damn thing needs a buff- it's supposed to at a minimum be bis at crazy arch/lavas/scorpia and it's absolute dog there, both dps wise and due to the much higher risk required.

Yeah so the skillets that have put 1000 hours in are out, high level pures are gone. Lol what a joke
---
Consider that the point of the voting system is not to ensure that it is the "Best OSRS" possible, but rather that it ensures the majority of people who pay Jagex money get what they want. This is likely the reality of it. When money is on the line Jagex has the most incentive to cater to the majority to maximize their subscription retention. Like plenty of others in the thread have stated, people with sub 300 total level might have aspirations and ideas and want to vote for content they may one day do. 
---
Nowhere am I saying this is the best for the game quality wise. But the game is in a tricky spot where Jagex is very limited in releasing content because if they do they will piss off the crystalmathlab elitist portion of the community
---
Should I have gone with something more profound like "$11" or "Hide poll results"?
---
Is this a legit quote from someone? It's not that I don't believe it, but would love to see a source.
---
I've been at the air obelisk for 3 days straight and not one pk has occurred. Even when skulls world hop in the just climb down that ladder and don't pk any of us.
---
Also, you'd have to be an idiot to bring loads of runes to an obelisk, and that's why 99% of people don't bring more than needed, so pking them for 1k gold is NOT worth it.
---
Justify it however you want man, byoure not changing my mind and I'm not changing yours.
---
Could it be possible to have a warning on paying the gardener to cut down the Celastrus tree? I've found myself accidentally paying the gardener to cut it down before I've harvested the battlestaves.
---
Yeah I suppose I can see that, but I'd rather finish a clue asap so I can get back to what I was doing, and wildy steps are just an inconvenient step that takes about triple the time of a normal step.  I prefer doing black chins if I'm looking for danger-but-not-really thrills lol.
---
I think they just require elite void/anguish/suffering/Msb/dark bow/chally/Bulwark nowadays. Not sure if you need any of the super expensive stuff.  But you need to know when and where to use which spec weapon.
---
No. The game is about progression to you. Runescape has so much more to offer than just virtual achievements. 
---
In many people‚Äôs mindset, they enjoy late game pvm or pvp. They know they enjoy it because of pre eoc. So they are skipping the unfun part to have fun. There is nothing wrong with that. 
---
Tho yes, u can get banned for it because it is against rules.
---
Or a stuck up poker, nor just a person defending the stuck up pkers who doesn't even pk, who knows. But you support the rude people therefore you're rude.
---
I've played both games extensively, and it seems like the osrs demographic would be about 16-24 while RS3 would be about 20-30. Not a bad thing, and not trying to turn this into an osrs vs rs3 thing (I only play osrs now anyway) just telling it how it is.
---
Prices would go all over the place, But i like the idea of bringing back item trades rather than items for cash. Also bargaining would be nice. The GE would still have it‚Äôs prices which would serve as a guide anyways
---
&gt; you'd have to be an idiot to bring loads of runes to an obelisk
---
Not arguing with that point because there are tons of dumb skillers/pvmers that bring rune stacks, d picks to wildy rc, 1k+ bones to altar, cash stacks for clues, etc.
---
The few pkers that reddit post pictures of it.  You see it in streamer videos.  Imagine how many kills of this nature don't get posted.  The answer is high.  
---
Pkers will attack anyone and everyone in the wild.  You keep pushing some false meme about how they only target nonpkers.
---
If I change my characters name, will that reset the account age date when checking from the guy in Lumbridge?

---
River Lum East Bank*
---
Most pures have a main anyway, and you kinda choose to limit yourself. My point being everyone has a choice what levels they want to level, being a pure you only miss out on 1 skill that helps you get to 1500. I dont like jagex bending over for certain accounts
---
They've said before that there are some serious technical issues with this. The code for BA is a nightmare, so making it so you could play with 4 people would more or less require that they rebuild the minigame entirely. If they did that, a lot of the quirks of the game that experience teams rely on would change; and given that BA is pretty much the only minigame people actually play just because they like it these days they don't want to take the chance.
---
I would rather drag my nutsack through the desert than play on a UIM.
---
damn this sounds awesome, I am excited to jump back into BA! what positions are you most looking for?
---
Nope.

Honestly I'd talk shit to anyone wearing a regen bracelet unless they happened to have farmed and crafted it themselves.

This is not botting. Botting is to gain xp or gp.

If a bot is not used for those two uses then I don‚Äôt even consider them a bot.
---
Omg
---
Can really vary, but probably around 45min for 1 pet roll? Its definitely not something you would want to do all the way, but its a nice place to start imo
---
Let me put it bluntly: I don't believe you.
---
This is a question for jagex the company, I don't think the devs would be able to adequately answer this question.
---
So you are limiting voting powers to people that are at ~mid/late game. So PKing polls, Skilling polls, F2P polls, none of these things will be priority anymore. Votes become better when more people do it, not less.  
---
The larger the sample size, the better the result.
---
I tell a lot of my friends early on in their PVM careers. The earlier you get con done the better. Personally though I just go for 85/86(nexus @ 86).... because I would rather die than stew boost.
---
Max worlds when!!?
---
I hope u didnt make the rookie mistake of thinking u only need the quests required for the  rfd subquests. And are aware of the 175qp requirement.

---
Only 10-15% of the playerbase votes in the polls. 
---
Skewing that even more in the direction of higher levelled players (who are naturally more invested in the game and so more likely to vote) is stupid.
---
Yep, "OSRS SoA" has a guy that will just hand out cert's when you get to the point. People also use it for Hero's Quest as well.
---
Pretty sure if they tried to fuck up it would be the smoothest deadman mode yet.
---
kind of defeats the point, doesn't it? :P
---
I have 2100+ total but they want more voters not less. They already say not a lot of people vote .
---
I can guarantee skilling/pvp polls will still be there, f2p would really be the only one affected. F2p isnt suppose to have that many updates anyhow considering it incentivizes people to buy membership and supporting the game.
---
What i dont want happening is people who are weaponizing the poll booth and are like 900-1200 total who spite vote because they are a pvper/skiller. The community shouldnt be divided in 2 we should be together, the way we have it right now can be massively manipulated by someone making a ton of 200-300 total accounts and they can literally decide the games future. Its a broken system

90% of them are just as legit as a real casino. Odds are always in favor of you losing, but you can still win.

Require 20 bounty hunter kills to vote on pvp polls. Require 20 kc of raids/bosses to vote on pvm. Require 100 qp to vote on quest changes. No requirements for general or skill changes. Easy fix to a complex problem.

In a game that is based all about doing the same shit million of time, i dont see how pre GE was so unwelcomed..

I can see it being a pain in the ass for Defender, you have to be fast and precise with where you put your bait
---
Not to rub salt in the wound but  you didn't notice anything fishy when they ask for your BANK PIN AND AUTHENTICATOR TO LOGIN TO THE FORUMS?
---
what do you mean explain
---
This has come up before, and while it seems like a fun idea there is a pretty significant problem.  If you were to die to a monster, someone could camp your grave to prevent you from getting your stuff back. If they end up reworking the death mechanics then this might stop being a problem, which point the idea could be revisited.
---
I considered setting up a bot of my own to record this, instead of doing it myself like an idiot, but I didn't feel like risking my account for this shitpost.
---
Why would they do that?
---
Also curious. Mm2 runnels?
---
Can you elaborate on that last part? Why do you need the other boxes?
---
Oooh thanks for the reminder!!
---
dont you want prot item for b necklace?
---
This is a problem?

did you read the whole thing?
---
Wasn't trying to call out anyone for being salty, all In saying is I don't think they're wrong for killing someone in the wildy regardless of if they're doing it for loot or just for the "thrill of the hunt" kind of thing. Again, I don't PK, so I don't really know.

So when you get to 83 and able to boost to 91, you would think you could build the last box. But in reality you have to upgrade the previous 2 boxes before you can make the ornate box. You can‚Äôt just outright build it, you need the previous ones as well to make the final one. Hope that makes sense

Any opinion on removing the required seasonal musics (the holiday events) to unlock the music cape?

May I ask how often you get hydra task? I'm about 1000 skip points in and 50 konar task completed and have yet to get one at 98 slayer
---
Small bets are usually paid out, large bets are not. It‚Äôs not truly random dude. It‚Äôs incentivized to make you think you have a chance to win. If you really believe that dice bots are legit then you are a brain dead gambler that fell for the carrot on the stick.

This was answered a month or two back, I think the answer was that they aren‚Äôt keen. Beyond joining a friends clan chat to see if you are a smiley, or messaging them when they‚Äôre online it could be a bit intrusive to people. 
---
The answer would then be to toggle it (or make it optional for the ‚Äòunknown friend‚Äô but then it looses any effectiveness.

So. Much. Incestporn.
---
It doesn‚Äôt count as a splash or something?

Heroes and legends?

---
A lot.
---
They get the exp that they‚Äôd get as if they were splashing it. So fire strike will always be 11.5 exp or whatever even if you hit an 8
---
That‚Äôs the plan
---
I had 92 ranged starting vork with a dhcb,rigour and 80 pray as well. I've never had a problem using 3 pray pots and getting 5 kill trips. I don't think 5 ranged levels make all the difference. 
---
Are you woox walking with the dhcb/bp switch. I didn't woox walk because it wasn't worth with a dhcb but having rigour on during woox walk could be eating ur prayer faster than without.
---
How do those boots taste?
---
Yeah range and use maul as spec weapon.
---
yeah its good, you could train range and gain a few hp levels since your in the area of max obby maulers that can hit 40+
---
Actually the bot just announces what people bet and what the roll was. I just had to read chat.

The amount of times I‚Äôve done this when going for ez low prayer is so relatable

Got a warrior ring at 140 ish kc.. was so pissed. Killed rex one more time because I hated him. Dropped a fucking berserker ring I laughed until I cried

I did appreciate how the RS3 redesigns made bronze through rune look distinct, rather than simple recolors. I just hate how the characters' elbows are parallel with their waists like some kind of monkey, so even the best armor designs tend to look "off."
---
I've been involved with this game longer than most active Jagex employees have worked there. I'd imagine.
---
How interesting would it be if you could adjust the skill total requirement to join your cc?
---
Me too! Should add me. I want to get the longest and gridiest ones out the way first so the endgame is a breeze!
---
It makes the game balanced ie better
---
Plant death rate is confirmed by Jagex to be 1/10 with Ultracompost. Doesn't change too much about the video but telling people to expect 1/20 (5/100) is not accurate.
---
Please
---
If you want, you can use super combats instead of overloads so that you only have to check every 15-20 minutes. You get slightly less xp per hour, but it's literally afk. You can also use a remote desktop app to click on potions, so you don't need to be at the computer at all.
---
Everybody uses the ignore list, because there's a constant flow of spammers on every world. Otherwise the chat would be unreadable. If Jagex really cared about community integrity and representing their game and practice, they would implement an auto-mute system to prevent spammers, gamblers, and phishers.
---
Tears of Guthix or quest rewards can get you some immediate farming. Natural history exam too. Besides those I'd probably fish until you can fly fish and do that for a while

Can do a few relatively quick quests to boost Farming up to 30ish, then start doing daily tree runs.
---
Sea Slug quest will bring you up to around 30 Fishing, fly-fishing trout/salmon is pretty quick up until barb fishing and then if you want to keep fishing, barb fishing will get you strength/agility exp as well (although not much, 99 fishing gets you to like 75 str/agility from 1)
---
Crafting and Herblore and Smithing and Construction are all fast, just depends on how much money you have to waste.
---
Thieving is pretty quick as well.
---
Get the mining level for MLM and afk there if you need to afk, or woodcutting
---
It's acually super afk with a dual screen setup. Spent most of my time watching movies and TV shows.

That's why I skipped Pollnivneach because I really didn't like it and also found I had to pay attention far too much.

The cancer is love, the cancer is life.
---
So it takes 10 minutes to load up the cache for walking or an Easter Carrot Whack? Wow. Doesn't RuneScape have vector-based animations anyways? Why would there be a delay in loading a basic walking animation on LOW graphics? Faulty game engine I suppose. Shouldn't the cache be loaded based upon local map chunk and player item resources? Guess not. The cache is probably downloading fucking priffidinas character models and such while sat at the GE in f2p LUL.

Any chance at all of adding the vine-sweeper minigame or something similar?

Are there any plans to finish the Elemental Workshop quest line?

With mobile release its been great. I play while watching tv and wouldnt be a member if not for mobile
---
It could easily be changed to require certain skills for polls that will effect said skill. Ex. A change to redwoods can only be polled for those with 92 wc, a change to the mining guild requires 60 mining, etc. Would it be the best idea? Maybe not. We could see, however. Unfortunately for that to take effect it would probably be polled first.
---
It doesn't change
---
Ni**a wat?
---
Can you go in depth as to why you cant and wont add God Wars instances?
---
 if it is an issue with items coming into the game, make the instances only able to hold 1 person, and if possible, even make the items account bound? as I'm sure iron men don't want to drop their Bandos items after going to the effort of getting them. 
---
This would literally solve the problems of being able to even do God Wars not in a team on a low ping world       (aussie btw), I shouldn't be locked out of content because there aren't physically enough worlds for me to do said content on. AND when I am lucky to find a world, 9/10 time I get crashed and its never worth the supplies to try and fight back as its a lose lose for everyone.
---
Please for the love of god jagex I‚Äôve been asking since day 1 of hydra release, my ex girlfriend doesn‚Äôt even ignore me this much.
---
Anyways,
---
With hydra currently only way for it to be damaged by chemicals if it‚Äôs standing right on it before it comes, is there a chance to change it so it can be damaged if it‚Äôs walking into it as well?
---
Also, possible to sync up in game kill count and what it says on the slay helm? I‚Äôve died at a few bosses and they died from last hit or poison or whatever but the numbers don‚Äôt add up and it‚Äôs driving me CRAZY
---
What about people with alt accounts trying to stack votes?
---
This idea often gets rejected because there are players who actively keep their untrimmed skillcapes and feel their cape would be devalued if every future player gets to keep their untrimmed skillcape. There are also players who didn‚Äôt know they could keep their untrimmed skillcape by telegrabbing and don‚Äôt want newer players to be able to keep their untrimmed skillcape (I can‚Äôt have it, so they can‚Äôt have it).
---
There‚Äôs got to be a compromise. My idea should help keep the rarity of untrimmed skillcapes as newer players may not care for the untrimmed version, may prefer the trimmed version or may not be able to afford the cost, and should that player decide to pay the cost, hey, it‚Äôs a gold sink and may get that player to grind out the cost ($$$ membership for jagex).
---
By other accidents, you could die and forget to telegrab the cape from your item stack, or you could accidentally drop the cape and pick it back up again for whatever reason.
